        "text": "The very weird bias in today’s world; the general idea that black is bad. Typically, with things… we think and see that blacker is worse. ￼\n\nCultural norms￼\n\nFor example, purity is typically seen as white. But if you think about the yin and yang, technically… the black and the white are equal and one and the same, a co-part of one another. ￼\n\nFor example, man and woman. Technically, there is no real reason why men should be superior to women and vice versa.\n\nMan needs woman, woman needs man.\n\nEven on a very very basic perspective… you modern day fools; don’t you know that in order to beget children, we need both man and woman? ￼\n\nJust get rid of the dogs￼\n\nI think honestly, both sides are at fault here. I think there are some men who think that they could live without women, and just jerk off to their internet porn girlfriends instead, and also similar speaking… women who think that they have no need for men either. And both sides see companionship through a dog? Very weird. ￼\n\nAnyways, we could just ignore them, because honestly… the Earth and the planet will be fine. Regardless of all these weird anti-trends towards kids, and pro dog trends… sooner or later people will wake up, and want to have kids. I think it just happens a lot later.\n\nFor example, here in Culver City… It seems like the average age of a new father looks like mid 50s? And for women… late 30s or maybe early 40s?\n\nIt’s really really bizarre to me because whenever I see new fathers, kids who are younger than Seneca, maybe the kid is two years old or one years old… The dad looks like he has maybe 55 or 56? Super weird.\n\nAnyways, what this means is don’t hate or spite anybody or any side– each side needs the other.\n\nThe red white and blue ￼\n\nEven Democrats and Republicans… if you think about the unit and Yang theory, let us say that we took the Yang and Yang, and we just made it red and blue instead… Don’t we know that we are one in the same? You cannot have an American flag without the red, nor the blue. You need both.\n\nIt looks like the Republicans have taken red as their color motto, Donald Trump is always wearing a red neck tie. And the Democrats have taken the blue. But once again… The red white and blue flag is all united. ￼\n\nWhat if we started thinking that we were in fact the same thing?\n\nI think this is a pretty radical idea. ￼￼￼The idea that we are just the same, just different sides of the same coin. ￼\n\nEven the notion of masculine vs feminine… maybe this is not a really good idea. ￼\n\nFor example, I think every man has a little bit of feminine in him, and every woman has a little bit of masculine in her.\n\nPink is the best color on men￼\n\nFor example, even when I was in high school, the guy who had the best dance moves would often do the more “feminine“ dance moves like the booty bump, backing it up etc. And also, the guys were the most stylish wore pink; the pink polo and the Louis Vuitton backpack, like Kanye West. ￼￼\n\nAnd also, it is very sexy when a woman is very strong, and could deadlift over two plates. Even Cindy‘s record for deadlift is 265 pounds. ￼\n\nAnd now, Seneca‘s favorite color is pink, and I love pink too! Even in my wardrobe, this random cable knit brooks brothers pink sweater that I got, from a free pile of clothes, is the article of clothing I get the most compliments on! And also this really cool matte pink bomber jacket, from this Korean American brand ￼”IISE” (this means second generation in Korean￼)– I also got for free.\n\nThe semen and the egg\n\nAnyways, it’s kind of weird how there is a bifurcation between men and woman, woman and man.\n\nFor example… even if you are a gay woman, or lesbian or something, who wants to have kids… obviously biologically you need to get a male sperm donor. I don’t think it is possible to take the DNA straight out of another woman, and injected into the uterus of another woman, to beget a child. I don’t think…?\n\nGeorge Clooney is a loser￼\n\nAnd also there is this weird thing for men to desire not to have children? That they want to just keep ejaculating in or on beautiful women, indefinitely, forever? ￼\n\nBut once again, you fools… don’t you know that the purpose is to have kids? Ideally strong sons, to carry on you?\n\nHow to raise a child\n\nSomething that I am having so much fun with is raising Seneca. All things considered, I consider it my crowning glory. I value Seneca his life and the way I’m raising him and the time spent to him as 1 trillion times more important than anything else I have done in my life.\n\nAnyways, I think each and every philosopher should have children, because first and foremost, if you have a strong opinion on how the world should be, it is very simple… you just instill these values into your kids! ￼￼\n\nAlso, philosophically, if you’re curious about how humans learn, human nature or whatever… Certainly the easiest way to learn this is through your kids!\n\nDon’t trust the French￼\n\nYou have a bunch of these constipated methamphetamine addicted French philosophers who have all these high and mighty theories about human nature, but I think most of them didn’t have kids?\n\nI find this really bizarre, how can you have an opinion on how humans exist, without having your own child?\n\nI think perhaps my theory on why most philosophers didn’t have kids is because most philosopher men simply couldn’t spit enough game, to get a beautiful woman or wife! Even Nietzsche, I think he was madly in love with this one woman, who rejected him many times, there’s even funny stories ￼￼￼￼that a lot of women would actually be frightened by Nietzsche and his imposing mustache.\n\nPerhaps the reason why so many philosophers are sexist is because they simply couldn’t get the woman Of their dreams?\n\n“I hate you because you refuse to sleep with me.” – has any man ever admitted this?\n\nDon’t uglify yourself ￼\n\nAlso in today’s world, I see zero reason for men to have facial hair or mustaches or beards or whatever. Honestly I think the only reason that men grow facial hair or beards is to make themselves look uglier, to make themselves look more ironic, or to hide their ugliness, their double chin, etc. ￼\n\nI even see this, dude sitting in their brand new Porsche cars, and I peer into them, and then they are very very skinny fat, they look lean, but if you look at them closely, you see their little belly fat bulging out?\n\nAlso, other skinny fat dudes with the little iconic Hitler mustache, if you look at them really closely, they too also have a double chin? ￼\n\nDouble chins are bad. Excess body fat adipose tissue is bad. ￼\n\nNever judge somebody until you have seen them butt naked.\n\nIt is my personal believe that humans are the most beautiful when they are in the nude, naked without clothes on. Also think that is possible for a beautiful woman to be in the nude, that is not pornographic, not even erotic… kind of like when you see the Venus de Milo nude Greek art stattues. Nobody looks at a marble statue of a Greek woman and gets a boner. ￼￼￼\n\nWhy this matters\n\nLet us say that we are all black and white photographers; ￼￼￼then the funny thought… we don’t call it black on black photographer — we call it black and white.\n\nThat is why when it comes to tragedy, we also need comedy! And sort of concept which is all misery no comedy… is bad. This is where I love the LEGO Batman movie; it is insanely humorous, for what we consider a dark gloomy figure!\n\nDisney is bad￼\n\nAnd also… I think the greatest films also do have a touch of comedy. I think this is where Robert Downey Jr. was such a great Iron Man character… certainly Robert Downey Jr. has his inner demons, he makes it lighthearted with humor! My personal thought is that the only good Marvel films were the ones that were produced before they were bought out by Disney. ￼\n\nMaybe this is where Disney is bad; when you “Disney-fy” something, it becomes too generic, and maybe even too family oriented?\n\nFamily friendly is bad￼\n\nAlso, something I’ve discovered… when something is “family friendly“, it is typically boring, and actually not that family friendly.￼￼￼￼ ￼Even Seneca, at the age of three years four months old, has more fun talking to adults and Apple security guards rather than other basic kids his age, a little younger than him or a little older than him?\n\nThe parents are basic￼\n\nCertainly everyone has the right to raise their child however they want, but man… these modern day kids are made so basic by their parents. They all watch the same generic stuff on YouTube, Disney+, they like the same superheroes, think alike, talk alike, they are also boring.\n\nHow much muscle mass does your kid have?￼\n\nNowadays when we go to the park or in public places and I meet other kids around Seneca‘s age… ￼these kids are so wimpy! The other day I saw a kid, who I haven’t seen in about six months, and the kid is tiny! I think the mom is maybe vegetarian or vegan and the kid doesn’t eat any meat? Seneca looks at least four times buffer than the other kid, and about a head taller. ￼￼￼\n\nSomething that they don’t do when measuring your kid is measuring their muscle mass. They only measure weight and height, but if your kid is 90% body fat? This is probably a bad thing.\n\n***￼￼\n\nShould we compare?\n\nI remember as a kid, the thing I hated the most was when my parents would compare me to my cousin, or to other kids in the random Korean newspaper, comparing my grades with other kids, etc. I always had the American notion “Don’t compare me with other kids! Just judge me for myself!”￼￼\n\nI think this is wise. Certainly there will always be some sociological biases, ￼ in which we in advertently do compare ourselves and our kids with other kids and families etc. That being said, I think we can still try to make a conscious effort to try to curb it a bit.\n\nIf you don’t have anything good to say, don’t say it\n\n￼￼￼Similarly speaking… Maybe the corollary exists, which is don’t sing the praises of other kids either?\n\nWhat that then means is to just ignore other kids? To just raise your kid however you personally see fit? ￼￼\n\nBecause let us critically consider this… all of this is bad:\n\nComparing your kids to other kids, whether they are better or worse\n\nHating or critiquing other kids\n\nPraising or saying good things about other kids\n\nMy simply idea is just keep your mouth shut, smile and nod, be friendly, engage and entertain other kids and play with them. Certainly acknowledge them and smile at them!\n\nBut beyond this… Don’t say evil, see evil, and be evil.￼￼￼￼\n\nBecause when you brag, while comparing your superiority or the superior of your kid versus other kids, what you are doing is actually debasing them. ￼\n\nFor example, if you could lift over 10 plates, are you going to brag about how you are so much stronger than the guy who could only lift two plates? No! They’re not even on your radar. ￼\n\nPerhaps nobody is on your radar? Nobody is on equal footing?\n\nWhy weigh yourself in comparison to others? ￼\n\nSomething I stopped doing about 7-8 years ago was weighing myself on a scale. Why? Many reasons.\n\n￼￼First, to weigh yourself is a very arbitrary measure of anything. ￼ it doesn’t tell you anything. No scale, irregardless of how expensive or advanced it is accurately break down your muscle percentage versus your body fat percentage. Even those modern inventions where you could grip the handles or you can stand on the barefoot… None of these things work.\n\nThe only really empirical thing to see is look at the mirror, and pinch your belly fat. Even Arnold said it well; “if it jiggles, it is fat”.-￼\n\nOr a better measure or not for men:\n\nDo you have a six pack or not? ￼\n\nTo get a six pack of super simple; you don’t even have to do crunches or whatever. The simple thing is intermittent fasting, no breakfast no lunch, only one massive dinner a day. 100% carnivore diet. The only non-meat item to eat is maybe arugula or kale.\n\nQuit alcohol, all alcohol is bad for you, even the “good alcohol“, “reservatrol” is a scam — I did a deep dive on this and essentially, all this fake ass studies on red wine being good for you is funded by alcohol and wine corporations, or other insidious corporations trying to peddle “reservatrol” pills.\n\nQuit smoking weed. It makes you fat lazy and dumb. And also it gives you the munchies, which will mean that after smoking weed, very easy to order McDonald’s when you’re high, and eat everything, all that high fructose corn syrup.\n\nDon’t eat out. Besides maybe Fogo de Chão and all you can eat Korean barbecue, everything sneakily has sugar added to it. Even something I’ve discovered is a lot of Korean restaurants, even a lot of all you can eat Korean barbecue places add corn syrup or sugar to the kimchi?\n\nCreate a new culture: no cake, no desserts, no birthday cake. If you want a birthday present, tell people to just buy you meat instead.\n\n￼Go opposite\n\nI’m starting to think… The next time I need to upgrade my iPhone, I’ll just get a white iPhone. Why? First, less prone to overheating, especially in the strong Los Angeles sun. And also, The big issue here is it seems that everyone is just going for the all black look. And it is pretty boring for the most part.\n\nAll white everything is a better flex; go to the wedding with an all white suit, white shoes, white pants. And even if it gets dirty, no big deal! You’re rich enough.\n\nCar aesthetics?￼￼￼￼\n\nWhy have I not yet seen all white Porsche 911, with all white solid rims? ￼\n\nBring back the solid white rims! Also the upside, better contrast against the black tires.\n\nHow and why colors matter\n\nYour color preferences signal and show who you are.\n\nAlso, pragmatic one; then if you’re living in Los Angeles and it hits the mid 90s, or the hundreds, do you want an all black car, even if it is fully tinted? No! I wouldn’t wish this upon my worst enemy.\n\nThere’s a reason why if you live in Southern California to have an all white house makes sense; to keep out the heat! ￼￼￼￼￼￼\n\nOr, if you’re in the middle of the Sahara desert, the reason why it makes sense to wear white linen clothes, to reflect the heat!\n\nUltimately, when shit hits the fan, the pragmatics will supersede the style and the fashion. ￼\n\nWhen it is hot, just wear white. ￼\n\nThis is also the reason why the French colonists would wear all white linen clothing and suits.\n\nWhere did the notion of all white tennis shoes come from?\n\nI wonder if it is a material thing; back in the days when you play tennis on the courts, maybe if you had dark shoes or sneakers, it would leave a mark on the courts? White was less likely to leave marks? Still… Thinking about my all white K SWISS tennis shoes back in high school, size 10 and a half.￼￼￼\n\nWhite people, black cars?\n\nIn America, it seems that if one wants to reach the apex of privilege, one must be “white“. ￼￼￼But the problems here:\n\nFirst, the hierarchy issue with race. I think when people talk about white people didn’t mean to say white protestant Anglo-Saxon Caucasian. For example, if you’re Irish, or if you have a “Mc” in your last name, don’t forget that Irish was not considered white for a very long time. Even now.\n\n￼￼￼￼ For example, Russian people are not considered white, or people from the Slavic regions. Polish people are not seen as white, people from Ukraine are not seen as white, even though they are “white passing“. ￼Jewish people are not white — as long as Jewish people have to keep changing their last names, and as long as there are internals… Unfortunately, Jewish, anti-Semitism… Almost as bad as black racism. But not as bad because in Hollywood and media, because a lot of eastern European Jewish Ashkenazi folks are “white passing“– like John Stewart and the like they are mostly off of the radar of the typical person. Same thing with Scarlett Johansson, etc.\n\nRacial politics\n\nAll human beings, irregardless of their ethnicity or race, look far more beautiful and healthy with a tan, rather than being pale and emaciated looking. I think this is where class privilege was a thing. In Korea, ￼￼￼￼ whiteness was equated with royalty, because if you were royalty, you did not have to go into the fields until the land. You could be indoors, or in the shade all day.\n\nBut now, opposite holds true. If you have the privilege of having a full body tan, an upper thigh tan, it is a signal that you are rich enough to spend all day at the beach! Typically beach bums or surfer bros are actually quite affluent. ￼Either their family comes from money, so they have a trust fund or something, or they are rich and successful and retired enough to just go surfing all day. This is why whenever I meet men with a beautiful body full body tan, I know that they’re successful. Because if you’re a construction worker or something, you might just have a Farmer’s tan or something?\n\nBlacken and tan your skin not your car ￼￼\n\nRather than doing a loser mat black murdered outlook on your car, just get a full body tan!\n\nSpend maximum time in the sun, Put on tons of sun spray, contain your body to the maximum, within common sense limits. For example, even if you had SPF 300 sun spray, it would probably not be very effective if you were butt naked all day in the Sahara desert.\n\nOpposites are the same\n\nYou know the idea that opposites attract? Very true!\n\nI think regardless of what people say… We are not attracted to people like us. Also from a pragmatic perspective, if you end up marrying somebody who is so similar to you… There is no dynamic range or diversity here. ￼\n\nFor example, I would have zero interest in marrying anybody or having a kid with anybody who was exactly like me, in personality scope and appearance.\n\nI’m all for LGBTQ rights, but one thing that I am very grateful is that I was born super straight. I feel bad for all these kids who end up growing up deal so confused about their sexual preferences or whatever.\n\nFor my perspective, I think biologically, it makes sense that some people are born gay lesbian, queer or whatever. There seems to be enough genetic diversity here, whether you are bisexual, whatever.\n\nI think then the secret and the goal is to discover what you are, and to not be ashamed of it. For example, if you’re a man and you’re attracted sexually to other men, vice versa etc., all good! Same goes with women etc. ￼\n\nAnd whatever your gender whatever, all good.\n\nBe proud of what you are, don’t hide or feel bad about it. But I think the nuance is we should not become tyrants here. ￼￼\n\nInnovations\n\nBe the first techie who buys an all silver MacBook Pro, or be that next person who actually buys an iPhone Pro in white. Or the natural titanium color.\n\nDon’t be another clone and loser driving an all black range rover, murdered out, whatever. Don’t be another clone with an all black Dodge charger, super boring. I find it more interesting to see guys with white muscle cars, rather than a typical black one. Why have I never seen an all white dodge hellcat?\n\nGet a tan! Just put on some SPF 60 sunblock, take off your shirt and get your tan on! If you’re a woman, sports bra bikini whatever.\n\nFormal attire, wear as much wide as possible. Buy some skinny white denim jeans. Just get some cheap ones at Old Navy, Zara, H&M, or Uniqlo. And also the goal is to not hide dirt; it is cooler to wear all white, and have it dirty, rather than being an insecure person who thinks everyone is looking at the stain on your clothes, but nobody notices.\n\nDirtier is better?\n\nMore joyful to see a kid who is all dirty from playing in the sand rather than one of these Netflix YouTube zombie kids, super puny and eating Cheerios.\n\niPad is not the issue\n\niPad tablets, cheap Amazon tablets are not the issue here. The issue is the media; the issue is Netflix, YouTube, YouTube kids, Disney+ etc.\n\nMy personal suggestion is I think an iPad is good for kids, in terms of creativity. The nuance is never download any free apps. There is always some sort of gotcha somewhere.\n\nGive them procreate, nomad sculpt, GarageBand. These are virtuous applications.\n\nMy suggestion is avoid Minecraft, it seems really good, but it is almost too good. ￼Maybe better to buy play dough instead.\n\n***￼￼￼￼\n\nThe very weird bias in today’s world; the general idea that black is bad. Typically, with things… we think and see that blacker is worse. ￼\n\nFor example, purity is typically seen as white. But if you think about the yin and yang, technically… the black and the white are equal and one and the same, a co-part of one another. ￼\n\nFor example, man and woman. Technically, there is no real reason why men should be superior to women and vice versa.\n\nMan needs woman, woman needs man.\n\nEven on a very very basic perspective… you modern day fools; don’t you know that in order to beget children, we need both man and woman? ￼\n\nI think honestly, both sides are at fault here.

And both sides see companionship through a dog? Very weird. ￼\n\nAnyways, we could just ignore them, because honestly… The Earth and the planet will be fine. Regardless of all these weird anti-trend kids, and pro dog trends… Sooner or later people will wake up, and want to have kids. I think it just happens a lot later.\n\nFor example, here in Culver City… It seems like the average age of a new father looks like mid 50s? And for women… Late 30s or maybe early 40s?\n\nIt’s really really bizarre to me because whenever I see new fathers, kids who are younger than Seneca, maybe the kid is two years old or one years old… The dad looks like he has maybe 55 or 56? Super weird.\n\nAnyways, what this means is don’t hate or spite anybody or any side. ￼\n\nEven Democrats and Republicans… If you think about the unit and Yang theory, let us say that we took the Yang and Yang, and we just made it red and blue instead… Don’t we know that we are one in the same? You cannot have an American flag without the red, nor the blue. You need both.\n\nIt looks like the Republicans have taken red as their color motto, Donald Trump is always wearing a red neck tie. And the Democrats have taken the blue. But once again… The red white and blue flag is all united. ￼\n\nWhat if we started thinking that we were in fact the same thing?\n\nI think this is a pretty radical idea. ￼￼￼The idea that we are just the same, just different sides of the same coin. ￼\n\nEven the notion of masculine vs feminine… maybe this is not a really good idea. ￼\n\nFor example, I think every man has a little bit of feminine in him, and every woman has a little bit of masculine in her.\n\nFor example, even when I was in high school, the guy who had the best dance moves would often do the more “feminine“ dance moves like the booty bump, backing it up etc. And also, the guys were the most stylish wore pink; the pink polo and the Louis Vuitton backpack, like Kanye West. ￼￼\n\nAnd also, it is very sexy when a woman is very strong, and could deadlift over two plates. Even Cindy‘s record for deadlift is 265 pounds. ￼\n\nAnd now, Seneca‘s favorite color is pink, and I love pink too! Even in my wardrobe, this random cable knit brooks brothers pink sweater that I got, from a free pile of clothes, is the article of clothing I get the most compliments on! And also this really cool matte pink bomber jacket, from this Korean American brand ￼”IISE” (this means second generation in Korean￼)– I also got for free.\n\nAnyways, it’s kind of weird how there is a bifurcation between men and woman, woman and man.\n\nFor example… Even if you are a gay woman, Or lesbian or something, who wants to have kids… Obviously biologically you need to get a male sperm donor. I don’t think it is possible to take the DNA straight out of another woman, and injected into the uterus of another woman, to beget a child. I don’t think…?\n\nAnd also there is this weird thing for men to desire not to have children? That they want to just keep ejaculating in or on beautiful women, indefinitely, forever? ￼\n\nBut once again, you fools… Don’t you know that the purpose is to have kids? Ideally strong sons, to carry on you?\n\nHow to raise a child\n\nSomething that I am having so much fun with is raising Seneca. All things considered, I consider it my crowning glory. I value Seneca his life and the way I’m raising him and the time spent to him as 1 trillion times more important than anything else I have done in my life.\n\nAnyways, I think each and every philosopher should have children, because first and foremost, if you have a strong opinion on how the world should be, it is very simple… You just instill these values into your kids! ￼￼\n\nAlso, philosophically, if you’re curious about how kids learn, human nature or whatever… Certainly the easiest way to learn this is through your kids!\n\nDo you have a bunch of these constipated methamphetamine addicted to French philosophers who have all these high and mighty theories about human nature, but I think most of them didn’t have kids?\n\nI find this really bizarre, how can you have an opinion on how humans exist, without having your own child?\n\nI think perhaps my theory is most philosopher men simply couldn’t spit enough game, to get a beautiful woman or wife! Even Nietzsche, I think he was madly in love with this one woman, who rejected him many times, there’s even funny stories ￼￼￼￼ that a lot of women would actually be frightened by Nietzsche and his imposing mustache.\n\nAlso in today’s world, I see zero reason for men to have facial hair or mustaches or beards or whatever. Honestly I think the only reason that men grow facial hair or beards is to make themselves look uglier, to make themselves look more ironic, or to hide Their ugliness, their double chin, etc. ￼￼\n\nI even see this, dude sitting in their brand new Porsche cars, and I pure into them, and then they are very very skinny fat, they look lean, but if you look at them closely, you see their little belly fat bulging out?\n\nAlso, other skinny fat dudes with the little iconic Hitler mustache, if you look at them really closely, they too also have a double chin? ￼\n\nDouble chins are bad. Excess body fat adipose tissue is bad. ￼\n\nNever judge somebody until you have seen them butt naked.\n\nIt is my personal believe that humans are the most beautiful when they are in the nude, naked without clothes. Also think that is possible for a beautiful men to be in the nude, that is not pornographic, not even erotic… kind of like when you see the Venus de Milo nude Greek art stattues. Nobody looks at a marble statue of a Greek woman and gets a boner. ￼￼￼\n\nWhy this matters\n\nLet us say that we are all black and white photographers; ￼￼￼ then the funny thought… we don’t call it black on black photographer — we call it black and white.\n\nThat is why when it comes to tragedy, we also need comedy! And sort of concept which is all misery no comedy… Is bad. This is where I love the Lego Batman movie; it is insanely humorous, for what we consider a dark gloomy figure!\n\nAnd also… I think the greatest films also do have a touch of comedy. I think this is where Robert Downey Jr. was such a great Iron Man character… Certainly Robert Downey Jr. has his inner demons, he makes it lighthearted with humor!\n\nMaybe this is where Disney is bad; when you “Disney-fy” something, it becomes too generic, and maybe even family oriented?\n\nAlso, something I’ve discovered… when something is “family friendly“, it is typically boring, and actually not that family friendly.￼￼￼￼ ￼ Even Seneca, at the age of three years four months old, has more fun talking to adults and Apple security guards rather than other basic kids his age, a little younger than him or a little older than him?\n\nCertainly everyone has the right to raise their child however they want, but man… These modern day kids are made so basic by their parents. They all watch the same generic stuff on YouTube, Disney+, they like the same superheroes, think alike, talk alike, they are also boring.\n\nAnd also, these kids are so wimpy! The other day I saw a kid, who I haven’t seen in about six months, and the kid is tiny! I think the mom is maybe vegetarian or vegan and the kid doesn’t eat any meat? Seneca looks at least four times buffer than the other kid, and about a head taller. ￼￼￼\n\nShould we compare?\n\nI remember as a kid, the thing I hated the most was when my parents would compare me to my cousin, or to other kids in the random Korean newspaper, comparing my grades with other kids, etc. I always had the American notion “Don’t compare me with other kids! Just judge me for myself!”￼￼\n\nI think this is wise. Certainly there will always be some sociological biases, ￼ in which we in advertently do compare ourselves and our kids with other kids and families etc. That being said, I think we can still try to make a conscious effort to try to curb it a bit.\n\nIf you don’t have anything good to say, don’t say it\n\n￼￼￼Similarly speaking… Maybe the corollary exists, which is don’t sing the praises of other kids either?\n\nWhat that then means is to just ignore other kids? To just raise your kid however you personally see fit? ￼￼\n\nBecause let us critically consider this… all of this is bad:\n\nComparing your kids to other kids, whether they are better or worse\n\nHating or critiquing other kids\n\nPraising or saying good things about other kids\n\nMy simply idea is just keep your mouth shut, smile and nod, be friendly, engage and entertain other kids and play with them. Certainly acknowledge them and smile at them!\n\nBut beyond this… Don’t say evil, see evil, and be evil.￼￼￼￼\n\nBecause when you brag, while comparing your superiority or the superior of your kid versus other kids, what you are doing is actually debasing them. ￼\n\nFor example, if you could lift over 10 plates, are you going to brag about how you are so much stronger than the guy who could only lift two plates? No! They’re not even on your radar. ￼\n\nPerhaps nobody is on your radar? Nobody is on equal footing?\n\nWhy weigh yourself in comparison to others? ￼\n\nSomething I stopped doing about 7-8 years ago was weighing myself on a scale. Why? Many reasons.\n\n￼￼First, to weigh yourself is a very arbitrary measure of anything. ￼ it doesn’t tell you anything. No scale, irregardless of how expensive or advanced it is accurately break down your muscle percentage versus your body fat percentage. Even those modern inventions where you could grip the handles or you can stand on the barefoot… None of these things work.\n\nThe only really empirical thing to see is look at the mirror, and pinch your belly fat. Even Arnold said it well; “if it jiggles, it is fat”.-￼\n\nOr a better measure or not for men:\n\nDo you have a six pack or not? ￼\n\nTo get a six pack of super simple; you don’t even have to do crunches or whatever. The simple thing is intermittent fasting, no breakfast no lunch, only one massive dinner a day. 100% carnivore diet. The only non-meat item to eat is maybe arugula or kale.\n\nQuit alcohol, all alcohol is bad for you, even the “good alcohol“, “reservatrol” is a scam — I did a deep dive on this and essentially, all this fake ass studies on red wine being good for you is funded by alcohol and wine corporations, or other insidious corporations trying to peddle “reservatrol” pills.\n\nQuit smoking weed. It makes you fat lazy and dumb. And also it gives you the munchies, which will mean that after smoking weed, very easy to order McDonald’s when you’re high, and eat everything, all that high fructose corn syrup.\n\nDon’t eat out. Besides maybe Fogo de Chão and all you can eat Korean barbecue, everything sneakily has sugar added to it. Even something I’ve discovered is a lot of Korean restaurants, even a lot of all you can eat Korean barbecue places add corn syrup or sugar to the kimchi?\n\nCreate a new culture: no cake, no desserts, no birthday cake. If you want a birthday present, tell people to just buy you meat instead.\n\n￼Go opposite\n\nI’m starting to think… The next time I need to upgrade my iPhone, I’ll just get a white iPhone. Why? First, less prone to overheating, especially in the strong Los Angeles sun. And also, The big issue here is it seems that everyone is just going for the all black look. And it is pretty boring for the most part.\n\nAll white everything is a better flex; go to the wedding with an all white suit, white shoes, white pants. And even if it gets dirty, no big deal! You’re rich enough.\n\nCar aesthetics?￼￼￼￼\n\nWhy have I not yet seen all white Porsche 911, with all white solid rims? ￼\n\nBring back the solid white rims! Also the upside, better contrast against the black tires.\n\nHow and why colors matter\n\nYour color preferences signal and show who you are.\n\nAlso, pragmatic one; then if you’re living in Los Angeles and it hits the mid 90s, or the hundreds, do you want an all black car, even if it is fully tinted? No! I wouldn’t wish this upon my worst enemy.\n\nThere’s a reason why if you live in Southern California to have an all white house makes sense; to keep out the heat! ￼￼￼￼￼￼\n\nOr, if you’re in the middle of the Sahara desert, the reason why it makes sense to wear white linen clothes, to reflect the heat!\n\nUltimately, when shit hits the fan, the pragmatics will supersede the style and the fashion. ￼\n\nWhen it is hot, just wear white. ￼\n\nThis is also the reason why the French colonists would wear all white linen clothing and suits.\n\nWhere did the notion of all white tennis shoes come from?\n\nI wonder if it is a material thing; back in the days when you play tennis on the courts, maybe if you had dark shoes or sneakers, it would leave a mark on the courts? White was less likely to leave marks? Still… Thinking about my all white K SWISS tennis shoes back in high school, size 10 and a half.￼￼￼\n\nWhite people, black cars?\n\nIn America, it seems that if one wants to reach the apex of privilege, one must be “white“. ￼￼￼But the problems here:\n\nFirst, the hierarchy issue with race. I think when people talk about white people didn’t mean to say white protestant Anglo-Saxon Caucasian. For example, if you’re Irish, or if you have a “Mc” in your last name, don’t forget that Irish was not considered white for a very long time. Even now.\n\n￼￼￼￼ For example, Russian people are not considered white, or people from the Slavic regions. Polish people are not seen as white, people from Ukraine are not seen as white, even though they are “white passing“. ￼Jewish people are not white — as long as Jewish people have to keep changing their last names, and as long as there are internals… Unfortunately, Jewish, anti-Semitism… Almost as bad as black racism. But not as bad because in Hollywood and media, because a lot of eastern European Jewish Ashkenazi folks are “white passing“– like John Stewart and the like they are mostly off of the radar of the typical person. Same thing with Scarlett Johansson, etc.\n\nRacial politics\n\nAll human beings, irregardless of their ethnicity or race, look far more beautiful and healthy with a tan, rather than being pale and emaciated looking. I think this is where class privilege was a thing. In Korea, ￼￼￼￼ whiteness was equated with royalty, because if you were royalty, you did not have to go into the fields until the land. You could be indoors, or in the shade all day.\n\nBut now, opposite holds true. If you have the privilege of having a full body tan, an upper thigh tan, it is a signal that you are rich enough to spend all day at the beach! Typically beach bums or surfer bros are actually quite affluent. ￼Either their family comes from money, so they have a trust fund or something, or they are rich and successful and retired enough to just go surfing all day. This is why whenever I meet men with a beautiful body full body tan, I know that they’re successful. Because if you’re a construction worker or something, you might just have a Farmer’s tan or something?\n\nBlacken and tan your skin not your car ￼￼\n\nRather than doing a loser mat black murdered outlook on your car, just get a full body tan!\n\nSpend maximum time in the sun, Put on tons of sun spray, contain your body to the maximum, within common sense limits. For example, even if you had SPF 300 sun spray, it would probably not be very effective if you were butt naked all day in the Sahara desert.\n\nOpposites are the same\n\nYou know the idea that opposites attract? Very true!\n\nI think regardless of what people say… We are not attracted to people like us. Also from a pragmatic perspective, if you end up marrying somebody who is so similar to you… There is no dynamic range or diversity here. ￼\n\nFor example, I would have zero interest in marrying anybody or having a kid with anybody who was exactly like me, in personality scope and appearance.\n\nI’m all for LGBTQ rights, but one thing that I am very grateful is that I was born super straight. I feel bad for all these kids who end up growing up deal so confused about their sexual preferences or whatever.\n\nFor my perspective, I think biologically, it makes sense that some people are born gay lesbian, queer or whatever. There seems to be enough genetic diversity here, whether you are bisexual, whatever.\n\nI think then the secret and the goal is to discover what you are, and to not be ashamed of it. For example, if you’re a man and you’re attracted sexually to other men, vice versa etc., all good! Same goes with women etc. ￼\n\nAnd whatever your gender whatever, all good.\n\nBe proud of what you are, don’t hide or feel bad about it. But I think the nuance is we should not become tyrants here. ￼￼\n\nInnovations\n\nBe the first techie who buys an all silver MacBook Pro, or be that next person who actually buys an iPhone Pro in white. Or the natural titanium color.\n\nDon’t be another clone and loser driving an all black range rover, murdered out, whatever. Don’t be another clone with an all black Dodge charger, super boring. I find it more interesting to see guys with white muscle cars, rather than a typical black one. Why have I never seen an all white dodge hellcat?\n\nGet a tan! Just put on some SPF 60 sunblock, take off your shirt and get your tan on! If you’re a woman, sports bra bikini whatever.\n\nFormal attire, wear as much wide as possible. Buy some skinny white denim jeans. Just get some cheap ones at Old Navy, Zara, H&M, or Uniqlo. And also the goal is to not hide dirt; it is cooler to wear all white, and have it dirty, rather than being an insecure person who thinks everyone is looking at the stain on your clothes, but nobody notices.\n\nDirtier is better?\n\nMore joyful to see a kid who is all dirty from playing in the sand rather than one of these Netflix YouTube zombie kids, super puny and eating Cheerios.\n\niPad is not the issue\n\niPad tablets, cheap Amazon tablets are not the issue here. The issue is the media; the issue is Netflix, YouTube, YouTube kids, Disney+ etc.\n\nMy personal suggestion is I think an iPad is good for kids, in terms of creativity. The nuance is never download any free apps. There is always some sort of gotcha somewhere.\n\nGive them procreate, nomad sculpt, GarageBand. These are virtuous applications.\n\nMy suggestion is avoid Minecraft, it seems really good, but it is almost too good. ￼Maybe better to buy play dough instead.\n\n***￼￼￼￼\n\nVideo podcast\n\nAudio\n\nRECOVER\n\nRecover, how to recover time, life?￼\n\nSo a new luck experiment; within reason, never jumping into a car, even if it is good.\n\nSome points of rationale:\n\nFirst, it seems that the primary issue here is when it comes to these asshole drivers on the road, road rage etc., the logical approach is to not just expose yourself to these assholes. The simplest thing is to just not jump into a car!\n\nWhy? I see eyewitness a lot of these big ass tough guys, we tried to bully me on the road with their anemic cars. People do this in many ways, they do with trucks, lifted trucks, over landing vehicles etc., the door with loser range rovers, loser AMG G wagons, ￼￼￼ loser portion 911’s, you name it. Fortunately it seems that the best drivers on the road are Tesla drivers; I think because it has the Tesla AI behind it, the good thing is that it discourages asshole behavior or asshole driving.\n\nBecome the change in which you wish to see in￼ the world\n\nThis Gandhi quote has stuck with me for a very long time, ever since I first heard it in high school, in fact I use this “for my UCLA admission letter, which I guess got me into UCLA as an undergrad. And also, pretty impressive that first I applied for biology, which is actually very competitive… And even with subpar grades, I think my total weighted GPA at the time was only a 3.98, I still got in! I credit being a Boy Scout Eagle Scout and doing a bunch of community service to get in. Definitely not my grades.\n\nAnyways, I think the primary issue at hand is you have a lot of these passive aggressive assholes, who hide and mighty in there vehicles will try to bully you with their loser cars. But, if you see them in the street… They would never dare to honk or bark at you if you saw them face-to-face.\n\nFor example, let us just imagine… Let us say that you are on the sidewalk, and you have a person right behind you, and the crosswalk turns green. If you do not move within half a second, would the person behind you ￼￼￼￼ honk at you, yell at you to get moving, whatever? Certainly not.\n\nAlso, I think if you do things in the flesh, if somebody from behind yelled at you or honked at you, but you were just walking in the flesh… You could do a simple thing like turn around, and then assess them, judge them, and Measure them up.\n\nThe big issue of being in car is this asymmetry; if you are driving, somebody honked at you from behind, first you cannot really see who is honking at you, sometimes even I am confused whether I am being hung from the person at behind, or if it is somebody else on the road.\n\nSecond, let us say there’s a loser in the Range Rover who honked at you from behind, because you did not go on the green in the split millisecond; I have no idea who is the human being who honked at me. Is it a man, a woman? Is it 80 year old man, or a 36 year old punk? ￼￼￼Is it a 4 foot tall man, or is it a 400 pound obese man?\n\nThese things matter. Nobody would dare to punk me on the streets, because I am 6 foot tall, weight vest on, super jacked and swole, and I am probably the nicest guy, but I could also be the most aggressive person, if shit hits the fan.\n\nAnd this is the truth, real men, real men with high testosterone, real fighters, MMA fighters, UFC fighters in the flesh… In real life these men are actually insanely friendly, polite, jovial! It is only these low testosterone man who are antisocial, ￼￼￼ are sizing you up behind their cowardly fully tinted sunglasses baseball cap and beard, but pretending like they are not… A real man doesn’t wear sunglasses, doesn’t have tint in the front of their car, nor did they have tint in there sunglasses, the real man doesn’t use AirPods, and even this whole facial hair trend I think a bad one; the reason why a lot of men grow out their facial hair is to hide their double chin, or their fat. ￼￼\n\nEven an insanely bizarre new modern day trend is these skinny fat loser guys once again, sunglasses, baseball hat, growing out a Hitler mustache? I find it objectively ugly and offensive to look at.\n\nAnyways, I think the first thought about recovering time, recovering life is maximum time walking, outside! We could be on the sidewalk, you could be in public, it could be a hiking spot, a national park trail etc. For example, whenever I see people hiking on a trail… People are in a very good mood! Even better than the beach!\n\nI love both, but still for me maybe the mountains are more interesting because typically when you’re hiking on the mountain, which just means walking on uneven surfaces, we feel more connected to nature, like to see elevation, we see plant life wilderness trees etc., All of this time I spent in Boy Scouts as a kid going on hikes and doing camping and summer camp was actually very good for me! I didn’t really think about him much as a kid, I think I took it for granted, I would prefer to just be at home playing video games, but now as an adult looking back, I am so insanely grateful to my scoutmasters, my troop, Troop 11 from Alameda! ￼￼￼￼Maybe once Seneca gets old enough, I’ll also put him in scouts? Maybe one day I’ll become a scoutmaster? ￼\n\nThe sociological issue here\n\nWhether I like to admit it or not, I think ultimately, perhaps my primary interest is sociology; Social physics, being human, being in human in public spaces etc.\n\nWhy does this matter? It is 1 trillion times more important than you think. When it comes down to it, almost everything modern day life, is a sociological phenomenon. ￼￼\n\nFor example, the sociology of money, the sociology of capitalism, the sociology of consumerism etc. Also the sociology of being on the streets, being in public, and also, the sociology of driving a vehicle or being on the road!\n\nIn fact, I don’t think anyone has actually done a comprehensive analysis or critique or line of critical thinking in regards to the politics of driving, especially in LA.\n\nOne thing I learned from my neighbor Jim, who always walked his dogs outdoors in Orange County, in a neighborhood where there is literally no sidewalks, when there would be crazy cars speeding down 50 miles an hour down a 25 mph ￼residential neighborhood, she would make eye contact and yell into his hands gesture to tell them to “slow down”. I am starting to do the same hand gesture, which is just taking out your palm outside of your driver side window, putting your hand flat like a palm, gesturing “calm down”. I’ve already had a guy throw the middle finger out at me, ￼ and another skinny fat loser with a beard honked at me from behind, now that I am no longer allowing these wimps to bully me, people are shocked.\n\nNever tolerate no disrespect. Become the change which you wish to see in the world. Even if it exposes you to danger.\n\nGuns\n\nI’ve been on a rampage telling people to not smoke in public, or to please not smoke in public.\n\nApparently I was talking to my friend Ray, and he said that once, he told her guy in Venice to not smoke in public, and a guy pulled out a gun on him. Another time he saw some kids graffiti and he asked him to stop graffiti, and once again the kids pulled out a gun, and then he just threw up his hands and said “OK OK I’m sorry let me go”.\n\nNo the response is not to just get a gun yourself, and do some sort of John Wick pistol fighting match.\n\nMaybe the first thought is just always be armored up, always have a bulletproof vest on you, or at least a 60 pound weight vest. If cops could do it all day long, can’t you? ￼￼ I’m pretty sure you could Amazon prime yourself a bulletproof vest.\n\nIn America, there are lots of laws regarding legality or illegality of owning a gun, but, no laws or illegal edict which prevent you from owning a bulletproof vest.\n\nIn fact, I think the law should be rewritten, not the right to bear arms, but the right to defense. Defense is armor.\n\nI also think and believe that the reason why bitcoin is such a great innovation is that it is the ultimate cyber defense, the ultimate cyber armor. Let us consider that the bitcoin work is the ultimate un hack Abel thing on the planet, because there is just too much energy and money invested in it.\n\nEven if you took $100 trillion, you try to take the bitcoin network, you can’t. In regards to the volatility of bitcoin, it is a feature not a bug. ￼￼ my personal thought is with any asset which has more extreme volatility, has the momentum and the monetary physics and economic physics to fly ever higher?\n\nOr another thought, without extreme highs and lows and dips and swings, it would be impossible for bitcoin to hit $21 million a bitcoin. ￼\n\nEthics?\n\nI’m starting to think more more about ethics, this is important. For example, once again it comes down to this notion; “first do no harm unto others” (Primum, no nocere)– Hippocrates.\n\nI think the big issue nowadays is there’s too much of a financial incentive for a lot of of these doctors. Or trying to cover their ass from being made liable or being sued.\n\nFor example, the reason why you have all these doctors peddling all these cholesterol lowering drugs is they just want to avoid a lawsuit! For example, let us say you have a 400 pound obese man, who pops into your clinic, ￼ who is certainly an extremely poor health, might get a heart attack soon. What is the first thing you do? Your prescribe him all these pills you tell him the basics of trying to eat healthier and exercise whatever, and ultimately the doctor doesn’t really care… The doctor simply doesn’t want to get sued a year or two later, if the guy ends up having a heart attack, and he was not prescribed these cholesterol lowering drugs.\n\nBut, what if you take an extremely healthy 36 year old man, 6 foot tall, highly muscular a six pack, ￼￼ obviously in supreme health, and you do a blood test and you see that his cholesterol is “high“? Do you tell him to start taking these cholesterol lowering pills, so he doesn’t have a heart attack? Of course not! But this is how doctors will think, once again the issue here is they apply a one pill fits all solution, and honestly… These doctors are tired. Cram 30 appointments a day, quick 15 minute Appointments with each patient, in order to maximize the revenue because they are still paying off medical school debt. I don’t blame them.\n\nThen the solution is for us to become critical ourselves; think for ourselves, to think wisely.\n\nAnybody who swallows traditional knowledge, is a fool. The worst thing is when a doctor tells you to do something, or when somebody changes their behavior or thinks they should change their behavior because the doctor told them to.\n\nThe dirty secret; a lot of these doctors themselves are unwell. A lot of them are highly anxious, depressed, out of shape miserable, stressed, they themselves don’t eat healthy or exercise, in fact, I know a lot of doctors who actually smoke cigarettes and secret as well? I’ve also met dentist, pediatricians who actually let their kids eat candy?\n\nTrust no dentist who allows their kids to eat candy.\n\n￼Parents\n\nObviously we are all fallible human beings at the end of the day. The notion of perfection is ridiculous one, often centered around this Jesus savior Messiah notion of supreme moral rectitude, the supreme court of ethics, the ultimate nice guy who ￼￼￼ only eat carbon neutral vegetables and plants grow in his own garden, maybe he doesn’t own a car, and only rides a bike, he is not subscribed to Amazon prime, doesn’t have an iPhone, etc.\n\nLet us not forget, Jesus was a badass. Don’t you remember that scene which she goes into the temple, and he sees all these people selling stuff in the temple, and he busted out some whips, and he overturns the tables, ￼￼ whips out the kettle saying “don’t sell merchandise inside my father‘s house!”\n\nCan you imagine a modern day human doing the same thing? Probably not.\n\nPacified ethics.\n\nI think sociologically when think about this critically, ￼ what is the role of society, modern day society and society? To pacify the individual. It would not be very productive if you had a bunch of dragons or monsters, a bunch of gay monsters simply rampaging around town, doing as they pleased, with no concern about the well-being of others.\n\nYou see this especially in Tokyo and Asia; the social physics and the human bodies are important here; if you have 10 million people taking the subway every single day, it is probably wise from a social perspective to have everyone be quiet, polite and orderly. If you had a bunch of kids, or American travelers talking super loud, taking up space, etc.… The whole thing will not work. ￼￼\n\nAmerica becomes an interesting case, because the truth is America is super super big. Certainly it is more desirable to live in the coastal areas, especially now that the weather patterns in the states in Los Angeles is starting to get super weird; but if you think about farmland in the middle of America, there is still so much space left available!\n\nTo all these people who complain about rent prices, don’t you know you could just move to Boise Idaho, probably only spent $300 a month in rent? Certainly people don’t want to do this, because we humans are no fools; we like to be around other people, and we also like to be close to bodies of water. This is where Los Angeles may be the most ultimate place to live– easy access to the beach, to body of water the ocean to mountains, beautiful people etc.\n\nMaybe Manhattan also comes close, but the downside of Manhattan is there is no trails or places to hike.\n\nThe Bay Area East Bay is good, but… I don’t think we have any beaches in the Bay Area or the east Bay? Even in Alameda where I grew up… The beach was a dump. Super dirty.\n\nPerhaps it is a good idea to become a social justice warrior\n\nSo I think the right tends to make fun of liberals who are social justice warriors. I’m starting to think that perhaps to be a social justice warrior is a virtue, assuming that you’re not a coward hiding behind your iPhone, your laptop etc.\n\nAnd also, once again the asymmetry here; ￼ you could talk all high and mighty, you could try to punk me around, and let her say that you have a gun, obviously I am no match for you. Because I have zero intention of ever owning a gun or pistol, because guns are for pussies. ￼\n\nAnd this is where the right is just as dumb as the far left. You call them “lib-tards”￼ … you are also “flag-tards”– I will assume that the average conservative who waves a flag in their Tacoma truck which is Japanese, probably doesn’t know how to properly fold an American flag, like we did in Boy Scouts.\n\nIn fact, there is a funny heuristic I have; ￼ if you stick a flag an American flag sticker on your car, or your truck, or whatever… You are not a true patriot. Why? It is kind of like an overcompensation thing here — kind of like how really short guys drive these really really tall and big trucks.\n\nIf you really really wanted to show your patriotism, you don’t post things to Facebook or Twitter or put things on your truck, you just enroll in military service! Simple and done. Well at least do some sort of partial reserve Navy officer training? I’m even thinking about doing this myself.\n\nYou are not your car\n\nThe number one thing we learned from our best friend Tyler Durden is that you are not your car, and let us also look at Brad Pitt, the apex of manliness and texting us, who tells Edward Norton “I don’t own a car”.￼￼￼\n\nTell me what you drive and I’ll tell you who you are\n\nI think one of the best ways to really understand somebody, it sounds insanely superficial, but ask them what car they drive. Especially when you meet an economist.\n\nA true economist will drive an economy car, this is why when I first read that Dan Ariel’s purchased and drove an Audi car, the writing was on the wall; he was a fake economist. ￼￼ a true economist would only drive a Toyota or a Prius, anybody who drives an Audi is trying to seem elegant stylish and smart? Even though that everyone knows that Audis are not good cars. ￼\n\nPutting your money where your mouth is\n\nThis is where money is good; true skin in the game. You only know what you truly value on the planet based on how use money or how you do not use money. ￼￼\n\nAnd it is fine; everyone has the right to use their money however they would like. I think this is good! But, even that one dude who had that blog getting rich slowly, when he wrote that his dream was to purchase a BMW mini car, which is a terrible car ￼– and then he actually purchased it, once again, the man seemed like a fool.\n\nWhat ideas do you desire to promote?\n\nI suppose the question at hand is in regards to your ideas, what ideas do you want to promote? Which ideas do you not want to promote?\n\nFor example, there is no ultimate right and wrong in ethics. It is all gamed.\n\nFor example, I would easily sacrifice the life of 1000 degenerates for the sake of one beautiful child. Also, if for some reason a guy was trying to attack me or Seneca whatever, assuming I had a gun, I would have zero hesitation shooting him in the balls and making him a eunuch etc. ￼￼￼￼￼\n\nIn fact, this seems harsh, but also ethically, let us assume that a man is a child predator, pedophile, convicted and caught, the solution is super simple! Just castrate him! Cut off his balls, or force sterilize him. ￼Boom — easy and done.\n\nHow to deal with homeless people?\n\nCurrently Culver City is doing a great job with their mobile crisis team, which is essentially a van which provides services to homeless people, to recuperate them back into society. Ultimately, simple things, like providing them some new clothes, helping them get clean off of their addictions, Giving them a shower and a shave, and also giving them training to become productive members of Society again.\n\nExample, something I’m not sure; is there truly a point of no return? I don’t think so… The human mind is far more malleable than we give it credit, so even if you have a cracked out homeless guy, in theory, if you invest in money and time and human resources to rehabilitate him, you could! And just get him a job at Shake shack or McDonald’s flipping burgers, or even a custodian picking up trash etc.\n\nThe ideal city?\n\nSeneca Cindy and I watch this really great film at the California science Center, titled cities of the future. The future is right here. ￼￼ in Culver City, it is very common place to see those self driving Waymo Google cars, without a driver in the front seat! Every time I see this, it is pure magic.\n\nSo truth be told, let us assume you live in Culver City, your architect job, or you could work as long as you have Wi-Fi… There is zero reason to actually drive a car, unless you want to go on a hike, see friends and family etc. And also because we are close to the metro line, you could easily go to Santa Monica and the beach and the pier, or you could easily go to the California science center and I suppose the new incoming George Lucas Museum of the narrative arts.\n\nSo then, if you think about this critically, a vehicle just becomes a superficial vanity object, a trophy asset.\n\nI think we all know that trophies are ridiculous. The moment I realize that you could actually go to a trophy store, and buy yourself a gold trophy is when I realize the whole thing was a scam.\n\nEven the Academy Awards, all of these Grammy awards… I think these awards are just plated in nickel or some fake gold foil, thing is plastic inside.\n\nTrue wealth?\n\nWealth is the health of your family, you and your wife your kids I think Kanye said “A happy family is heaven on earth”.￼￼￼￼￼ I agree.\n\nAnd happiness is not based around money, but rather, through health, social life, friendliness, physical health and vigor, and walking around a lot! I’ve never met anybody who walks 40,000 steps a day who is depressed.\n\nDIFFICULT TO MONETIZE WALKING ￼\n\nLet us￼ consider this critically… Perhaps the reason why running is so heavily marketed through that loser Nike corporation, which tells you that running is good for you or whatever. In order to peddle there loser $300 running shoes. ￼\n\nThe simple way to fix everything is to just walk barefoot. But it is difficult to monetize being barefoot, because you cannot really purchase a product to become barefoot. In fact I met this one entrepreneur in SF, Who had a super interesting idea, which was putting these disposable sticker things on the bottom of your feet, which gave you all the upsides of barefoot walking, while still giving you a little bit of protection from the dirty San Francisco streets.\n\nA much simpler solution is to purchase Vibram five finger shoes; honestly ￼￼￼ the only reason people don’t want to wear them is that they look weird. But I’m starting to wonder… Foot shame, foot shaming is a thing? I actually think it is more beautiful to see people walking around barefoot at the beach, then them wearing those loser Hoka shoes or even worse… Brooks shoes, are reserved for prediabetic elderly people.\n\nEven I think about the insidious effects of middle school and high school; trying to be cool you have to purchase a Nike shoe? ￼ I think Nike might be the most evil corporation in terms of lowering the self-esteem of the youth, especially young boys… Do you know that on Amazon prime you could purchase $10 water shoes, instead of a loser $700 Balenciagas sneaker? I’m starting to think more and more… The purpose of fashion is to do functional things, but not to feel ashamed about it. For example all these losers supreme people, They refuse to wear a fanny pack unless it has supreme logo on it? Or they refuse to wear a sun hat which makes you look like an old Asian lady, supreme logo Embedded in it?\n\nEven reformation, the new hot female clothing brand, even they say that the best outfit is being naked, but that they are number two.\n\nDifficult to market people being naked. Maybe also illegal?\n\nShame in capitalism and consumerism\n\nHow do you know whether somebody is self owned or not? Whether they could walk around in public topless, with booty shorts, not concerned about how other people look at them.\n\nThe other day I was in Santa Monica Ocean Park, and I saw a dude, great full body tan, muscular, on the phone talking to somebody… Wearing full on booty shorts, pretty much the closest thing you could get to wearing a speedo, with a full body tan, and he looks so glorious and successful! ￼￼\n\nEven the more impressive thing… All of his legs, even the upper thighs were also well tanned! To me this was a signal that this guy was super insanely successful; because he has the privilege of just walking around all day, and his booty shorts, getting the full on tan?\n\nHow do you know whether somebody is homeless or not?\n\nMy friend Sebastian Calvo said; “the reason I know that you’re not homeless is that you’re too buff and muscular”. Typically homeless people are not muscular. Although a lot of them do walk around without clothes on. ￼￼￼\n\nSo this is where I’m starting to think, the modern day successful or at least human being, if you’re a man, is centered around being topless in public, and also highly muscular.\n\nNowadays if you’re super muscular with a six pack… It is a sign that you’re super successful. Why? You have the time the leisure to work out, and also, a signal of intelligence; if you have a six pack, you are no dummy. it is the signal that you have the intelligence of not eating stupid stuff which makes you fat.\n\nAnd this is where I trust no bodybuilder who is fat, or on steroids… It is super obvious. ￼\n\nVote for me!\n\n￼ERIC KIM for mayor!\n\nTrue power is political power?\n\nI think the truth of the matter is true power is political power. Why? The politicians have the power to print the money, and assuming that money and economic power is centered ultimately — then who has the park? The guy who controls the (money) printing press, ￼￼or the guy who stacks his cotton candy paper fiat currency? ￼\n\nProof of work\n\nThe reason why proof of work makes sense from a physics or a common sense perspective is that proof of work is true. Based on physics. Proof of stake, you can indefinitely print more air tokens, or cotton candy tokens, forever.\n\nFor example, if Vitalik, and Ethereum foundation ￼￼￼ overnight, decided that it was a good idea to produce more Ethereum gas tokens, 1 billion more, they could.\n\nEven if there’s a .01% risk, or chance for valuable human beings to make that mistake, they can. ￼\n\nAlso, you remember the great Ethereum hack, and they did the hard Fork? Any protocol which could be hacked, is a bad one. Bitcoin and the bitcoin network is unhackable.￼\n\nUnkillable\n\nThe reason why wolverine and Deadpool are everyone’s favorite anti-heroes is that they are both unk kill Abel. They can feel pain but you can’t kill them.\n\nDeadpool, if you just chop off his body into a stump, With enough time he could regenerate his whole body. This is the ultimate superpower.\n\nI suppose even the downside of Superman is that you could have a jealous Batman invent a kryptonite gun, and kill Superman. Superman is flawed.\n\nWith Wolverine, can you actually kill wolverine? Maybe not? Because his exoskeleton and his body is made of adamantine, ￼￼ you can’t?\n\nIs Wolverine the apex hero? ￼\n\nIn fact, besides Spider-Man, in terms of who I desired to emulate or be as a kid was actually wolverine! I love how ferocious he was, strong he was, and the adamantine steel claws notion is super cool to me, wolverine doesn’t use a gun. ￼\n\nAlso, the thing that is insanely impressive with Hugh Jackman; he has aged so incredibly well! If you look at his space, he looks like a fresh 38-year-old, even though he is maybe 56?\n\nIt seems certain or highly likely that she took steroids and weird testosterone enhancing drugs when he was playing the wolverine part. But if you look at his face, right now in 2024… Why does his face look so healthy?\n\nUltimately, you can modify your body through all of these drugs, but you can’t modify the face.\n\nThink by the time you’re 56\n\nMy new goal is to be like Hugh Jackman, when I am 56. I’m 34 right now, which means for the next 22 years… Time for me to become even more jacked, more ripped, more healthy and youthful for Hugh Jackman?\n\nWhy does Brad Pitt look so old? ￼￼￼\n\nEven compared to Tom Cruise, I think Tom is in his 60s? Besides all the Scientology and maybe the Botox surgery… Tom Cruise still looks great!\n\nI think this is where longevity, the longevity of being a man is critical. Even George Clooney, nobody cares about him anymore.\n\nHaving kids\n\nIf there was a John Wick spin off, I would love a concept where John Wick has a kid, a son, and he trains his son to become the next John Wick.\n\nThis would be great!\n\nEK IDEAS\n\nNever miss a single idea: EK NEWSLETTER >\n\n￼What’s on my mind right now?￼\n\nEssentially the number one idea is this really revolutionary idea of being able to live a whole day, without ever jumping into a car. Isn’t this true freedom?\n\nERIC\n\nPHILOSOPHY BY KIM\n\nLifestyle, zen, ethics.\n\nAlso\n\nSTART HERE\n\nBullet Summary: #RECOVER\n\nRecovering Time and Life:\n\nAvoiding Car Dependency:\n\nExperiment with not using cars as a strategy to avoid road rage and aggressive drivers.\n\nObservation that certain drivers use their vehicles to project power or aggression, which wouldn’t occur in face-to-face interactions.\n\nSociological Observations:\n\nDiscusses the social dynamics and passive-aggressive behavior often hidden behind the anonymity of driving.\n\nNotes the difference in public behavior when walking versus driving.\n\nEmbracing Change:\n\nDrawing from Gandhi’s quote, “Become the change you wish to see in the world,” by altering personal behavior to promote a more peaceful and respectful society.\n\nWalking as an Ideal Activity:\n\nAdvocates for walking as a primary mode of transport, noting its benefits for mental health and community engagement.\n\nReflects on past experiences, such as hiking in Boy Scouts, which fostered a connection with nature and personal growth.\n\nSocial Justice and Ethics:\n\nConsiders the role of ethics in modern society, advocating for active, public, and non-violent engagement in social justice.\n\nHighlights the importance of self-defense and armor, both physical and digital, as seen in the advocacy for bulletproof vests and the security of Bitcoin.\n\nCritique of Consumerism:\n\nCriticizes the commercialization of walking and fashion, suggesting that true freedom comes from rejecting societal pressures to conform to consumer trends.\n\nReflections on Wealth and Success:\n\nRedefines wealth as health, family well-being, and the ability to live freely without material constraints.\n\nEmphasizes the value of walking and physical fitness as indicators of true success.\n\nFuture Cities and Technology:\n\nImagines an ideal city where car dependency is reduced, and technology like self-driving cars enhances freedom rather than restricting it.\n\nPolitical Power and Proof of Work:\n\nDiscusses the importance of political power and financial systems based on proof of work, such as Bitcoin, as true forms of value and security.\n\nAging and Longevity:\n\nReflects on aging, using examples like Hugh Jackman and Tom Cruise to highlight the importance of maintaining health and vitality over time.\n\nPersonal Aspirations:\n\nSets a goal to maintain health and fitness as a lifelong pursuit, inspired by figures like Hugh Jackman.\n\nCultural and Ethical Commentary:\n\nCritiques modern cultural trends, such as consumerism and the superficial nature of societal values.\n\nAdvocates for living authentically, with a focus on personal ethics and societal contributions.\n\nPhilosophy of Living:\n\nPromotes a lifestyle centered around simplicity, ethics, and mindful living, aiming for a balance of physical health, social responsibility, and personal freedom.\n\nThis summary encapsulates your ideas on recovering time and life through lifestyle changes, ethical living, and personal growth, while critiquing modern societal trends.\n\nRecover, how to recover time, life?￼\n\nSo a new luck experiment; within reason, never jumping into a car, even if it is good.\n\nSome points of rationale:\n\nFirst, it seems that the primary issue here is when it comes to these asshole drivers on the road, road rage etc., the logical approach is to not just expose yourself to these assholes. The simplest thing is to just not jump into a car!\n\nWhy? I see eyewitness a lot of these big ass tough guys, we tried to bully me on the road with their anemic cars. People do this in many ways, they do with trucks, lifted trucks, over landing vehicles etc., the door with loser range rovers, loser AMG G wagons, ￼￼￼ loser portion 911’s, you name it. Fortunately it seems that the best drivers on the road are Tesla drivers; I think because it has the Tesla AI behind it, the good thing is that it discourages asshole behavior or asshole driving.\n\nBecome the change in which you wish to see in￼ the world\n\nThis Gandhi quote has stuck with me for a very long time, ever since I first heard it in high school, in fact I use this “for my UCLA admission letter, which I guess got me into UCLA as an undergrad. And also, pretty impressive that first I applied for biology, which is actually very competitive… And even with subpar grades, I think my total weighted GPA at the time was only a 3.98, I still got in! I credit being a Boy Scout Eagle Scout and doing a bunch of community service to get in. Definitely not my grades.\n\nAnyways, I think the primary issue at hand is you have a lot of these passive aggressive assholes, who hide and mighty in there vehicles will try to bully you with their loser cars. But, if you see them in the street… They would never dare to honk or bark at you if you saw them face-to-face.\n\nFor example, let us just imagine… Let us say that you are on the sidewalk, and you have a person right behind you, and the crosswalk turns green. If you do not move within half a second, would the person behind you ￼￼￼￼ honk at you, yell at you to get moving, whatever? Certainly not.\n\nAlso, I think if you do things in the flesh, if somebody from behind yelled at you or honked at you, but you were just walking in the flesh… You could do a simple thing like turn around, and then assess them, judge them, and Measure them up.\n\nThe big issue of being in car is this asymmetry; if you are driving, somebody honked at you from behind, first you cannot really see who is honking at you, sometimes even I am confused whether I am being hung from the person at behind, or if it is somebody else on the road.\n\nSecond, let us say there’s a loser in the Range Rover who honked at you from behind, because you did not go on the green in the split millisecond; I have no idea who is the human being who honked at me. Is it a man, a woman? Is it 80 year old man, or a 36 year old punk? ￼￼￼Is it a 4 foot tall man, or is it a 400 pound obese man?\n\nThese things matter. Nobody would dare to punk me on the streets, because I am 6 foot tall, weight vest on, super jacked and swole, and I am probably the nicest guy, but I could also be the most aggressive person, if shit hits the fan.\n\nAnd this is the truth, real men, real men with high testosterone, real fighters, MMA fighters, UFC fighters in the flesh… In real life these men are actually insanely friendly, polite, jovial! It is only these low testosterone man who are antisocial, ￼￼￼ are sizing you up behind their cowardly fully tinted sunglasses baseball cap and beard, but pretending like they are not… A real man doesn’t wear sunglasses, doesn’t have tint in the front of their car, nor did they have tint in there sunglasses, the real man doesn’t use AirPods, and even this whole facial hair trend I think a bad one; the reason why a lot of men grow out their facial hair is to hide their double chin, or their fat. ￼￼\n\nEven an insanely bizarre new modern day trend is these skinny fat loser guys once again, sunglasses, baseball hat, growing out a Hitler mustache? I find it objectively ugly and offensive to look at.\n\nAnyways, I think the first thought about recovering time, recovering life is maximum time walking, outside! We could be on the sidewalk, you could be in public, it could be a hiking spot, a national park trail etc. For example, whenever I see people hiking on a trail… People are in a very good mood! Even better than the beach!\n\nI love both, but still for me maybe the mountains are more interesting because typically when you’re hiking on the mountain, which just means walking on uneven surfaces, we feel more connected to nature, like to see elevation, we see plant life wilderness trees etc., All of this time I spent in Boy Scouts as a kid going on hikes and doing camping and summer camp was actually very good for me! I didn’t really think about him much as a kid, I think I took it for granted, I would prefer to just be at home playing video games, but now as an adult looking back, I am so insanely grateful to my scoutmasters, my troop, Troop 11 from Alameda! ￼￼￼￼Maybe once Seneca gets old enough, I’ll also put him in scouts? Maybe one day I’ll become a scoutmaster? ￼\n\nThe sociological issue here\n\nWhether I like to admit it or not, I think ultimately, perhaps my primary interest is sociology; Social physics, being human, being in human in public spaces etc.\n\nWhy does this matter? It is 1 trillion times more important than you think. When it comes down to it, almost everything modern day life, is a sociological phenomenon. ￼￼\n\nFor example, the sociology of money, the sociology of capitalism, the sociology of consumerism etc. Also the sociology of being on the streets, being in public, and also, the sociology of driving a vehicle or being on the road!\n\nIn fact, I don’t think anyone has actually done a comprehensive analysis or critique or line of critical thinking in regards to the politics of driving, especially in LA.\n\nOne thing I learned from my neighbor Jim, who always walked his dogs outdoors in Orange County, in a neighborhood where there is literally no sidewalks, when there would be crazy cars speeding down 50 miles an hour down a 25 mph ￼residential neighborhood, she would make eye contact and yell into his hands gesture to tell them to “slow down”. I am starting to do the same hand gesture, which is just taking out your palm outside of your driver side window, putting your hand flat like a palm, gesturing “calm down”. I’ve already had a guy throw the middle finger out at me, ￼ and another skinny fat loser with a beard honked at me from behind, now that I am no longer allowing these wimps to bully me, people are shocked.\n\nNever tolerate no disrespect. Become the change which you wish to see in the world. Even if it exposes you to danger.\n\nGuns\n\nI’ve been on a rampage telling people to not smoke in public, or to please not smoke in public.\n\nApparently I was talking to my friend Ray, and he said that once, he told her guy in Venice to not smoke in public, and a guy pulled out a gun on him. Another time he saw some kids graffiti and he asked him to stop graffiti, and once again the kids pulled out a gun, and then he just threw up his hands and said “OK OK I’m sorry let me go”.\n\nNo the response is not to just get a gun yourself, and do some sort of John Wick pistol fighting match.\n\nMaybe the first thought is just always be armored up, always have a bulletproof vest on you, or at least a 60 pound weight vest. If cops could do it all day long, can’t you? ￼￼ I’m pretty sure you could Amazon prime yourself a bulletproof vest.\n\nIn America, there are lots of laws regarding legality or illegality of owning a gun, but, no laws or illegal edict which prevent you from owning a bulletproof vest.\n\nIn fact, I think the law should be rewritten, not the right to bear arms, but the right to defense. Defense is armor.\n\nI also think and believe that the reason why bitcoin is such a great innovation is that it is the ultimate cyber defense, the ultimate cyber armor. Let us consider that the bitcoin work is the ultimate un hack Abel thing on the planet, because there is just too much energy and money invested in it.\n\nEven if you took $100 trillion, you try to take the bitcoin network, you can’t. In regards to the volatility of bitcoin, it is a feature not a bug. ￼￼ my personal thought is with any asset which has more extreme volatility, has the momentum and the monetary physics and economic physics to fly ever higher?\n\nOr another thought, without extreme highs and lows and dips and swings, it would be impossible for bitcoin to hit $21 million a bitcoin. ￼\n\nEthics?\n\nI’m starting to think more more about ethics, this is important. For example, once again it comes down to this notion; “first do no harm unto others” (Primum, no nocere)– Hippocrates.\n\nI think the big issue nowadays is there’s too much of a financial incentive for a lot of of these doctors. Or trying to cover their ass from being made liable or being sued.\n\nFor example, the reason why you have all these doctors peddling all these cholesterol lowering drugs is they just want to avoid a lawsuit! For example, let us say you have a 400 pound obese man, who pops into your clinic, ￼ who is certainly an extremely poor health, might get a heart attack soon. What is the first thing you do? Your prescribe him all these pills you tell him the basics of trying to eat healthier and exercise whatever, and ultimately the doctor doesn’t really care… The doctor simply doesn’t want to get sued a year or two later, if the guy ends up having a heart attack, and he was not prescribed these cholesterol lowering drugs.\n\nBut, what if you take an extremely healthy 36 year old man, 6 foot tall, highly muscular a six pack, ￼￼ obviously in supreme health, and you do a blood test and you see that his cholesterol is “high“? Do you tell him to start taking these cholesterol lowering pills, so he doesn’t have a heart attack? Of course not! But this is how doctors will think, once again the issue here is they apply a one pill fits all solution, and honestly… These doctors are tired. Cram 30 appointments a day, quick 15 minute Appointments with each patient, in order to maximize the revenue because they are still paying off medical school debt. I don’t blame them.\n\nThen the solution is for us to become critical ourselves; think for ourselves, to think wisely.\n\nAnybody who swallows traditional knowledge, is a fool. The worst thing is when a doctor tells you to do something, or when somebody changes their behavior or thinks they should change their behavior because the doctor told them to.\n\nThe dirty secret; a lot of these doctors themselves are unwell. A lot of them are highly anxious, depressed, out of shape miserable, stressed, they themselves don’t eat healthy or exercise, in fact, I know a lot of doctors who actually smoke cigarettes and secret as well? I’ve also met dentist, pediatricians who actually let their kids eat candy?\n\nTrust no dentist who allows their kids to eat candy.\n\n￼Parents\n\nObviously we are all fallible human beings at the end of the day. The notion of perfection is ridiculous one, often centered around this Jesus savior Messiah notion of supreme moral rectitude, the supreme court of ethics, the ultimate nice guy who ￼￼￼ only eat carbon neutral vegetables and plants grow in his own garden, maybe he doesn’t own a car, and only rides a bike, he is not subscribed to Amazon prime, doesn’t have an iPhone, etc.\n\nLet us not forget, Jesus was a badass. Don’t you remember that scene which she goes into the temple, and he sees all these people selling stuff in the temple, and he busted out some whips, and he overturns the tables, ￼￼ whips out the kettle saying “don’t sell merchandise inside my father‘s house!”\n\nCan you imagine a modern day human doing the same thing? Probably not.\n\nPacified ethics.\n\nI think sociologically when think about this critically, ￼ what is the role of society, modern day society and society? To pacify the individual. It would not be very productive if you had a bunch of dragons or monsters, a bunch of gay monsters simply rampaging around town, doing as they pleased, with no concern about the well-being of others.\n\nYou see this especially in Tokyo and Asia; the social physics and the human bodies are important here; if you have 10 million people taking the subway every single day, it is probably wise from a social perspective to have everyone be quiet, polite and orderly. If you had a bunch of kids, or American travelers talking super loud, taking up space, etc.… The whole thing will not work. ￼￼\n\nAmerica becomes an interesting case, because the truth is America is super super big. Certainly it is more desirable to live in the coastal areas, especially now that the weather patterns in the states in Los Angeles is starting to get super weird; but if you think about farmland in the middle of America, there is still so much space left available!\n\nTo all these people who complain about rent prices, don’t you know you could just move to Boise Idaho, probably only spent $300 a month in rent? Certainly people don’t want to do this, because we humans are no fools; we like to be around other people, and we also like to be close to bodies of water. This is where Los Angeles may be the most ultimate place to live– easy access to the beach, to body of water the ocean to mountains, beautiful people etc.\n\nMaybe Manhattan also comes close, but the downside of Manhattan is there is no trails or places to hike.\n\nThe Bay Area East Bay is good, but… I don’t think we have any beaches in the Bay Area or the east Bay? Even in Alameda where I grew up… The beach was a dump. Super dirty.\n\nPerhaps it is a good idea to become a social justice warrior\n\nSo I think the right tends to make fun of liberals who are social justice warriors. I’m starting to think that perhaps to be a social justice warrior is a virtue, assuming that you’re not a coward hiding behind your iPhone, your laptop etc.\n\nAnd also, once again the asymmetry here; ￼ you could talk all high and mighty, you could try to punk me around, and let her say that you have a gun, obviously I am no match for you. Because I have zero intention of ever owning a gun or pistol, because guns are for pussies. ￼\n\nAnd this is where the right is just as dumb as the far left. You call them “lib-tards”￼ … you are also “flag-tards”– I will assume that the average conservative who waves a flag in their Tacoma truck which is Japanese, probably doesn’t know how to properly fold an American flag, like we did in Boy Scouts.\n\nIn fact, there is a funny heuristic I have; ￼ if you stick a flag an American flag sticker on your car, or your truck, or whatever… You are not a true patriot. Why? It is kind of like an overcompensation thing here — kind of like how really short guys drive these really really tall and big trucks.\n\nIf you really really wanted to show your patriotism, you don’t post things to Facebook or Twitter or put things on your truck, you just enroll in military service! Simple and done. Well at least do some sort of partial reserve Navy officer training? I’m even thinking about doing this myself.\n\nYou are not your car\n\nThe number one thing we learned from our best friend Tyler Durden is that you are not your car, and let us also look at Brad Pitt, the apex of manliness and texting us, who tells Edward Norton “I don’t own a car”.￼￼￼\n\nTell me what you drive and I’ll tell you who you are\n\nI think one of the best ways to really understand somebody, it sounds insanely superficial, but ask them what car they drive. Especially when you meet an economist.\n\nA true economist will drive an economy car, this is why when I first read that Dan Ariel’s purchased and drove an Audi car, the writing was on the wall; he was a fake economist. ￼￼ a true economist would only drive a Toyota or a Prius, anybody who drives an Audi is trying to seem elegant stylish and smart? Even though that everyone knows that Audis are not good cars. ￼\n\nPutting your money where your mouth is\n\nThis is where money is good; true skin in the game. You only know what you truly value on the planet based on how use money or how you do not use money. ￼￼\n\nAnd it is fine; everyone has the right to use their money however they would like. I think this is good! But, even that one dude who had that blog getting rich slowly, when he wrote that his dream was to purchase a BMW mini car, which is a terrible car ￼– and then he actually purchased it, once again, the man seemed like a fool.\n\nWhat ideas do you desire to promote?\n\nI suppose the question at hand is in regards to your ideas, what ideas do you want to promote? Which ideas do you not want to promote?\n\nFor example, there is no ultimate right and wrong in ethics. It is all gamed.\n\nFor example, I would easily sacrifice the life of 1000 degenerates for the sake of one beautiful child. Also, if for some reason a guy was trying to attack me or Seneca whatever, assuming I had a gun, I would have zero hesitation shooting him in the balls and making him a eunuch etc. ￼￼￼￼￼\n\nIn fact, this seems harsh, but also ethically, let us assume that a man is a child predator, pedophile, convicted and caught, the solution is super simple! Just castrate him! Cut off his balls, or force sterilize him. ￼Boom — easy and done.\n\nHow to deal with homeless people?\n\nCurrently Culver City is doing a great job with their mobile crisis team, which is essentially a van which provides services to homeless people, to recuperate them back into society. Ultimately, simple things, like providing them some new clothes, helping them get clean off of their addictions, Giving them a shower and a shave, and also giving them training to become productive members of Society again.\n\nExample, something I’m not sure; is there truly a point of no return? I don’t think so… The human mind is far more malleable than we give it credit, so even if you have a cracked out homeless guy, in theory, if you invest in money and time and human resources to rehabilitate him, you could! And just get him a job at Shake shack or McDonald’s flipping burgers, or even a custodian picking up trash etc.\n\nThe ideal city?\n\nSeneca Cindy and I watch this really great film at the California science Center, titled cities of the future. The future is right here. ￼￼ in Culver City, it is very common place to see those self driving Waymo Google cars, without a driver in the front seat! Every time I see this, it is pure magic.\n\nSo truth be told, let us assume you live in Culver City, your architect job, or you could work as long as you have Wi-Fi… There is zero reason to actually drive a car, unless you want to go on a hike, see friends and family etc. And also because we are close to the metro line, you could easily go to Santa Monica and the beach and the pier, or you could easily go to the California science center and I suppose the new incoming George Lucas Museum of the narrative arts.\n\nSo then, if you think about this critically, a vehicle just becomes a superficial vanity object, a trophy asset.\n\nI think we all know that trophies are ridiculous. The moment I realize that you could actually go to a trophy store, and buy yourself a gold trophy is when I realize the whole thing was a scam.\n\nEven the Academy Awards, all of these Grammy awards… I think these awards are just plated in nickel or some fake gold foil, thing is plastic inside.\n\nTrue wealth?\n\nWealth is the health of your family, you and your wife your kids I think Kanye said “A happy family is heaven on earth”.￼￼￼￼￼ I agree.\n\nAnd happiness is not based around money, but rather, through health, social life, friendliness, physical health and vigor, and walking around a lot! I’ve never met anybody who walks 40,000 steps a day who is depressed.\n\nDIFFICULT TO MONETIZE WALKING ￼\n\nLet us￼ consider this critically… Perhaps the reason why running is so heavily marketed through that loser Nike corporation, which tells you that running is good for you or whatever. In order to peddle there loser $300 running shoes. ￼\n\nThe simple way to fix everything is to just walk barefoot. But it is difficult to monetize being barefoot, because you cannot really purchase a product to become barefoot. In fact I met this one entrepreneur in SF, Who had a super interesting idea, which was putting these disposable sticker things on the bottom of your feet, which gave you all the upsides of barefoot walking, while still giving you a little bit of protection from the dirty San Francisco streets.\n\nA much simpler solution is to purchase Vibram five finger shoes; honestly ￼￼￼ the only reason people don’t want to wear them is that they look weird. But I’m starting to wonder… Foot shame, foot shaming is a thing? I actually think it is more beautiful to see people walking around barefoot at the beach, then them wearing those loser Hoka shoes or even worse… Brooks shoes, are reserved for prediabetic elderly people.\n\nEven I think about the insidious effects of middle school and high school; trying to be cool you have to purchase a Nike shoe? ￼ I think Nike might be the most evil corporation in terms of lowering the self-esteem of the youth, especially young boys… Do you know that on Amazon prime you could purchase $10 water shoes, instead of a loser $700 Balenciagas sneaker? I’m starting to think more and more… The purpose of fashion is to do functional things, but not to feel ashamed about it. For example all these losers supreme people, They refuse to wear a fanny pack unless it has supreme logo on it? Or they refuse to wear a sun hat which makes you look like an old Asian lady, supreme logo Embedded in it?\n\nEven reformation, the new hot female clothing brand, even they say that the best outfit is being naked, but that they are number two.\n\nDifficult to market people being naked. Maybe also illegal?\n\nShame in capitalism and consumerism\n\nHow do you know whether somebody is self owned or not? Whether they could walk around in public topless, with booty shorts, not concerned about how other people look at them.\n\nThe other day I was in Santa Monica Ocean Park, and I saw a dude, great full body tan, muscular, on the phone talking to somebody… Wearing full on booty shorts, pretty much the closest thing you could get to wearing a speedo, with a full body tan, and he looks so glorious and successful! ￼￼\n\nEven the more impressive thing… All of his legs, even the upper thighs were also well tanned! To me this was a signal that this guy was super insanely successful; because he has the privilege of just walking around all day, and his booty shorts, getting the full on tan?\n\nHow do you know whether somebody is homeless or not?\n\nMy friend Sebastian Calvo said; “the reason I know that you’re not homeless is that you’re too buff and muscular”. Typically homeless people are not muscular. Although a lot of them do walk around without clothes on. ￼￼￼\n\nSo this is where I’m starting to think, the modern day successful or at least human being, if you’re a man, is centered around being topless in public, and also highly muscular.\n\nNowadays if you’re super muscular with a six pack… It is a sign that you’re super successful. Why? You have the time the leisure to work out, and also, a signal of intelligence; if you have a six pack, you are no dummy. it is the signal that you have the intelligence of not eating stupid stuff which makes you fat.\n\nAnd this is where I trust no bodybuilder who is fat, or on steroids… It is super obvious. ￼\n\nVote for me!\n\n￼ERIC KIM for mayor!\n\nTrue power is political power?\n\nI think the truth of the matter is true power is political power. Why? The politicians have the power to print the money, and assuming that money and economic power is centered ultimately — then who has the park? The guy who controls the (money) printing press, ￼￼or the guy who stacks his cotton candy paper fiat currency? ￼\n\nProof of work\n\nThe reason why proof of work makes sense from a physics or a common sense perspective is that proof of work is true. Based on physics. Proof of stake, you can indefinitely print more air tokens, or cotton candy tokens, forever.\n\nFor example, if Vitalik, and Ethereum foundation ￼￼￼ overnight, decided that it was a good idea to produce more Ethereum gas tokens, 1 billion more, they could.\n\nEven if there’s a .01% risk, or chance for valuable human beings to make that mistake, they can. ￼\n\nAlso, you remember the great Ethereum hack, and they did the hard Fork? Any protocol which could be hacked, is a bad one. Bitcoin and the bitcoin network is unhackable.￼\n\nUnkillable\n\nThe reason why wolverine and Deadpool are everyone’s favorite anti-heroes is that they are both unk kill Abel. They can feel pain but you can’t kill them.\n\nDeadpool, if you just chop off his body into a stump, With enough time he could regenerate his whole body. This is the ultimate superpower.\n\nI suppose even the downside of Superman is that you could have a jealous Batman invent a kryptonite gun, and kill Superman. Superman is flawed.\n\nWith Wolverine, can you actually kill wolverine? Maybe not? Because his exoskeleton and his body is made of adamantine, ￼￼ you can’t?\n\nIs Wolverine the apex hero? ￼\n\nIn fact, besides Spider-Man, in terms of who I desired to emulate or be as a kid was actually wolverine! I love how ferocious he was, strong he was, and the adamantine steel claws notion is super cool to me, wolverine doesn’t use a gun. ￼\n\nAlso, the thing that is insanely impressive with Hugh Jackman; he has aged so incredibly well! If you look at his space, he looks like a fresh 38-year-old, even though he is maybe 56?\n\nIt seems certain or highly likely that she took steroids and weird testosterone enhancing drugs when he was playing the wolverine part. But if you look at his face, right now in 2024… Why does his face look so healthy?\n\nUltimately, you can modify your body through all of these drugs, but you can’t modify the face.\n\nThink by the time you’re 56\n\nMy new goal is to be like Hugh Jackman, when I am 56. I’m 34 right now, which means for the next 22 years… Time for me to become even more jacked, more ripped, more healthy and youthful for Hugh Jackman?\n\nWhy does Brad Pitt look so old? ￼￼￼\n\nEven compared to Tom Cruise, I think Tom is in his 60s? Besides all the Scientology and maybe the Botox surgery… Tom Cruise still looks great!\n\nI think this is where longevity, the longevity of being a man is critical. Even George Clooney, nobody cares about him anymore.\n\nHaving kids\n\nIf there was a John Wick spin off, I would love a concept where John Wick has a kid, a son, and he trains his son to become the next John Wick.\n\nThis would be great!\n\nEK IDEAS\n\nNever miss a single idea: EK NEWSLETTER >\n\n￼What’s on my mind right now?￼\n\nEssentially the number one idea is this really revolutionary idea of being able to live a whole day, without ever jumping into a car. Isn’t this true freedom?\n\nERIC\n\nPHILOSOPHY BY KIM\n\nLifestyle, zen, ethics.\n\nAlso\n\nSTART HERE\n\nWhat is a streetcar for? A street guitar for is a force on the streets, beyond the road, beyond the pavement.\n\nThe critical issue of being in a car, in an automobile, in a truck, whatever… Is that it puts you on equal putting with all of these other cowards.\n\nFor example, being here in LA… Now here in Culver City, I am the GOAT of the streets. ￼￼ Everybody knows me; they know me and my iconic 60 pound weight vest, how I am always walking around in public with Seneca, and also walking around with my iPad Pro.\n\nNow as a consequence, I feel a sense of ownership of the road. Or the streets. ￼\n\nFor example, any skinny fat loser in a car, especially when behind you, could honk at you, for not driving immediately half a second after the light turns green, or, throw you the middle finger because you stuck at your arm to know them to calm down.\n\nAssuming that street Fatar fee is truly your prime passion, I think then the simple goal is dual: first, never drive a vehicle to get anywhere, and also don’t ride a bicycle. I’m all about bikes in general, but the truth is when you ride a bicycle, it is very dangerous, especially with these crazy distracted drivers in LA.\n\nAnd also, the downside of a bicycle is that walking is at least 10,000 times superior to even riding a bike. ￼￼￼ Why? When you walk, it is far superior for your legs, your back, your hips, your shoulders your tendons etc. ￼\n\nAnd also, once again… It is very common to get road rage, if you are in a car, or in a bicycle, or a motorcycle or a moped etc.\n\nHowever, when you are naked in the streets, without your 5000 pound metal vehicle encasing you, ￼then, you really do put people at a position of true valor. ￼\n\nBeing naked on the streets.\n\nSo I think the first issue here is that most people when they’re walking in public, are a bunch of cowards. What the typical loser millennial does is they try to in case themselves with a shroud of cowardice; they do this with walking any opportunity of interaction with strangers;, Pros, Hitler mustache, or facial hair, ￼￼ focus on their dog or pet, busting out their iPhone, wearing heavily tinted sunglasses, wearing a baseball cap, and frumpy clothing etc.\n\nA very simple thing you could do is for an entire day, within limits of reason, ￼ is for the entire day, never step into a car a vehicle… Just do 100% pedestrian walking day! And the assignment is anytime you cross paths with a stranger, or somebody on the road, wave high to them, give them a peace sign, a thumbs up, a simple head, or say hello!\n\nI think the issue in today’s world most people are always in their cars, it is easy to vilify or dehumanize other human beings on the road.\n\nHowever when you’re on the streets, it is very very easy to judge people. You could judge their height, their sex and gender, their body mass percentage, their clothing choices etc.\n\nFor example, any pre-diabetic old man, and a loser portion 911 convertible could honk at you from behind, because you did not go on the green light and half a millisecond. But if you saw the man on the street, would he dare to do this face-to-face, especially if he is only 5 foot four, old and fat, and you are 6 foot tall, tall dark and handsome? of course not.\n\nBuilding social courage\n\nHonestly nowadays, I’m sorry I think that street photography is almost 100% courage. ￼￼￼￼ my bread and butter workshop for the last 15+ years has been my conqueror your fears of shooting street photography workshop, because it is resistant to all technology, media, platforms etc. I think any normal human being, in modern day times, and also in the past present and future will have to deal with Social anxiety, cowardice, courage, risk and reward etc.\n\nFor example… Now walking around town with my 60 pound weight vest, I command a sense of dominance. Even police officers are impressed by me, because I think their bulletproof vest may only weigh 10 or 20 pounds, whereas mine is 60. And I’m also starting to see… When I see police officers up and close in the flesh, without sunglasses on… A lot of these guys are actually not that fi"
