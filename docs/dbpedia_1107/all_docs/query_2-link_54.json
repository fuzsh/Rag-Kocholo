        "text": "Randy Blythe has been to hell and back. During the past four years, he has seen his massive metal band Lamb of God go from Grammy winners to questionable in the wake of his trial for manslaughter in the Czech Republic. And while this sort of thing could break an average man, Blythe has emerged on top, quite possibly because of things like his camera, moments alone in the still night of Prague, and his own creative drive. We talked to Randy Blythe about his forthcoming book and love of photography, so famously exhibited on Instagram, and how it helped him cope with the tribulations of the past few years.\n\nNoisey: How did you get into photography?\n\nRandy Blythe: It was entirely accidental. My dad when I was little got me a super easy, I mean this is pre-digital, a dummy camera for kids. Only a complete moron could screw it up, and of course I did. (laughs) I wanted to do it, but I wasn‚Äôt any good at it.\n\nFast forward to 39 years old, about four years ago, I decided I had enough of being on the internet, and mobile phones and all that stuff in general. So I decided I was gonna take a year off from the internet and mobile phones, and I mean totally. Not allow myself to use it at all. I would use a computer to make music, but no telecommunication skills other than a telephone line. If anyone wanted to interview me, they had to do it on tour or from a hotel phone, I was just not going to carry a phone with me. So I was telling my friend Jamey Jasta, the singer of Hatebreed, about this while we were on a plane, that I was going to completely unplug for a year and write a book about it. So I tell him the whole deal, asking him what he thinks about the angle, and at the end he goes ‚Äúokay, here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre gonna do the movie.‚Äù So he takes my book idea, threw it out, and ‚Äúyou‚Äôll do a documentary.‚Äù So I was like, okay cool. So I figured I could film a lot of it myself, and I asked a lot of film guys I know ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a cheap but not too cheap digital camera that can do high-def video‚Äù and they told me Canon ELS-60D which is a prosumer camera, not quite the pro level.\n\nAll of the sudden one day, I was in my kitchen and I was looking at my french press, which has kind of a domed chrome top, and I saw my reflection in it. I happened to be playing with the camera and said ‚Äúwell let me try and use this what it was actually made for, not video, let‚Äôs see how it works.‚Äù I put it on automatic, I pointed the lens at it, looked through the viewfinder, press click, and then I looked in the back of it at the picture and was like ‚Äúthat is fucking cool.‚Äù (laughs) And that was the end. Unplugging from the documentary, which I‚Äôd still love to do, was delayed when I was forcibly unplugged and spent a little time in a gated community in Europe a little while ago. I got arrested and had to keep my internet and learn to keep up with lawyers and crap.\n\nBut photography was totally accidental, my first picture was of my coffeepot and I was like ‚Äúwow that looks cool.‚Äù Unlike film, and I‚Äôm starting to get into film, I don‚Äôt have to wait to develop. I think it‚Äôs a really good learning tool in a monetary sense, you can suck a long long time as a photographer, and I think especially with film it can get really expensive while you learn just how to frame things and exposure, developing film is expensive. I‚Äôm not downing film at all, it just makes it economically feasible to shoot way more photos than I would have by now. I forgot who said it but someone said ‚Äúyour first 10,000 photos are your worst.‚Äù But now it‚Äôs like with digital your first 100,000 are your worst! (laughs)\n\nAbsolutely. What kinds of cameras have you been messing with? Have you been going all out with light kits and wide lenses and all that kind of stuff?\n\nI have an old Fuji, I can‚Äôt even remember what it is, I wish I had it with me right now. I‚Äôve been shooting mostly 400 speed black and white film, which I‚Äôve been told is pretty forgiving. Our publicist, Maria Ferraro, her uncle was a big time photographer dating back to WWII. He‚Äôs passed on, but he had a Rolleiflex, one of the square format ones. Maria has loaned me that, and I‚Äôve shot several rolls of that film, haven‚Äôt developed them yet. That‚Äôs all a really new process to me. But the Rolleiflex, it‚Äôs crazy. You pop the top and you look in and it‚Äôs a mirror. It shows a reverse image, and after the holidays I‚Äôm really looking to get the film rolls developed and see what I got.\n\nA fascinating idea to me is almost an ouroboros, the idea of a photographer taking a picture of you and you being inspired to take a photo yourself. Are there like certain photographers that you liked their work?\n\nI know what my aesthetic is instinctually, so I started researching a lot of the french guys like Cartier-Bresson and Brassai who is actually Hungarian. But they worked large format stuff in Paris a lot in the 30‚Äôs. Particularly Brassai stuff he did that book Paris by Night, and it‚Äôs just incredible that he captured this stuff in the 30s, like prostitutes and all that stuff. I‚Äôm a big fan of that stuff, I‚Äôm a big fan of Cartier-Bresson because from what I understand, he‚Äôs the father of photojournalism and really street photography. I‚Äôm really into that slice of life stuff he did.\n\nI also have a literary fascination with Paris of the 20‚Äôs, the ex-patriots and Hemingway and all them. And shortly after that era, I‚Äôm just fascinated by Paris of that time. So I‚Äôve learned a bit about them and bought some photo books around them.\n\nIs there a camera that you‚Äôd like to explore?\n\nWhat I really want is a Leica Monochrome M. It‚Äôs digital, but it‚Äôs the only one that shoots true black and white RAW files, because when you shoot RAW you get everything, and if you edit in black and white you have to convert. But apparently the grey scale on the Lyca Monochrome M is dialed in incredibly. I‚Äôm lusting after that but it‚Äôs like $7000 for a body and $4000 for a lens and I‚Äôm in Lamb of God not Led Zeppelin (laughs). Right now, I shoot primarily with a Canon 5D mark 3, the full frame stuff. For street photography I use a Fuji XE2, and it‚Äôs quiet and small and for capturing stuff on the street it‚Äôs good to be as unobtrusive as possible. Sorry, I got excited talking about the Leica and got off topic.\n\nAs far as other photographers I like, there‚Äôs Paolo Pellegrin, he‚Äôs Italian I think and I like his stuff, I have one of his books. I don‚Äôt know much about professional photographers, but I like to shoot with professional photographers and because I‚Äôm in a band I‚Äôm lucky enough to work with them quite a bit. I bug the shit out of them when they‚Äôre shooting me. I carry my camera and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhat does this do? What does that do?‚Äù\n\nFor instance a guy named Travis Shinn, who came and shot me for the past two days for Metal Hammer, I carried my camera and did a lot of shooting with him, we‚Äôre friends. I like Scott Uchida out of LA, he‚Äôs another photographer that works with Slash and all these rock guys. But when I‚Äôm anywhere near him, even if he has to shoot me he‚Äôs like ‚Äúokay bring your camera, I‚Äôm gonna bring my light rig and show you how to light a model.‚Äù There‚Äôs a guy in Dublin, Ireland named Dara McDonagh, he shot Lamb of God. All these guys I‚Äôve met because they‚Äôve shot my band, and now when I see them I pick their brains. They‚Äôve taught me so much.\n\nI‚Äôm still learning about photography, and I was shooting with my buddy Travis and I was picking his brain and he said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt learn too much. I like your photography. It has this innocence that might get lost if you learn too much.‚Äù\n\nWould you say the reason your shots are the way they are because you didn‚Äôt learn it out of a textbook?\n\nYeah. I‚Äôve learned a few things from pro photographers who follow my Instagram. Early on when I was posting stuff, one of them was like ‚Äúdo you know the rule of thirds?‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúno, what is that?‚Äù (laughs) And so they were like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre kind of instinctually doing it. and it made total sense. But I do pay attention to it now and that‚Äôs about it. I do like things that look fucked up sometimes too, so like really there‚Äôs no such thing as a perfect exposure. I like things to look messy or real. Once again over-editing can kill that or smooth out. Sometimes it‚Äôs fun to overedit for super bizarre shit. I prefer shooting in black and white, there‚Äôs no pretty window dressing to take away from it. The strength of a photo‚Äôs composition is really displayed in black and white.\n\nTwo things really changed the way I perceive the world around me, at least in the urban enviornment. One is skateboarding, because once I started skateboarding as a kid I started perceiving everything from a skater‚Äôs eye. Then when I started shooting, I look at everything from a photographer‚Äôs eye. I‚Äôm constantly framing things whether I have a camera or not. Which can be problematic at times.\n\nWhen did you start skating?\n\nHmm, I‚Äôm 43 and I started seriously when I was 12 I think?\n\nI‚Äôve always thought this, and it‚Äôs funny you stumbled on it. Guys around your age that grew up in that era of skateboarding popularity, how much those Powell Peralta videos and the music in skate culture, how much that made people take a left turn in life in general.\n\nIt completely did. American hardcore came to me from skateboarding. I didn‚Äôt know anything about American punk rock, I thought it only came from England because somebody gave me a Never Mind the Bollocks tape when I was eleven. So I was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs punk rock! Punk rock is from England and it‚Äôs an English thing!‚Äù I started skateboarding about a year later pretty seriously, I had a banana board in the 70‚Äôs like everyone, but I started skating with real skaters and they got me into Black Flag and Bad Brains and all that stuff. And Thrasher Skate Rock Vol 3 had The Accused, COC, The Faction, all these crazy bands on it. Skate rock, that‚Äôs what it was and brought me into the American hardcore scene with skateboarding.\n\nAnd I bet those Thrasher and TransWorld Skateboarding mags probably influenced your eyes coming up, I‚Äôd imagine?\n\nAbsolutely man. I used to read every Thrasher. Pushead had a column every issue called ‚ÄúFrantic Scribblings‚Äù or something like that, and I would check out Pushead‚Äôs art. And they‚Äôd have interviews with bands like Samhain, who I shot recently. They did a reunion and Glenn is famously not too into photographers, but he‚Äôs my buddy and I sent him an email through London, Samhain‚Äôs drummer. ‚ÄúGlenn, you‚Äôre doing these Samhain shows, you need to let me to photograph these just to document it because it‚Äôs probably the last time it will happen.‚Äù He gave me the word back ‚Äúit‚Äôs cool.‚Äù I sent him a bunch of my photos first to show him my style, and was like ‚Äúlook, this is what I do, this is my style check it out.‚Äù So I went out and shot four shows with him. Halloween in DC was just mindblowing, so I got a whole bunch of Samhain photos I need to edit and get to him.\n\nWhat‚Äôs going on in Lamb of God now, and how are you adjusting now that it seems like the nightmare is in the rearview?\n\nLamb of God is playing a bunch of big gigs this year, and sooner or later we‚Äôll write an album. What the guys have been writing sounds pretty monstrous thus far. In the immediate we‚Äôre going to Soundwave in Australia in February, which will be warm and awesome. It‚Äôll be our third Soundwave. Going to Indonesia after that for a few days, hopefully I‚Äôll get some time to surf. We‚Äôll be doing some bigger gigs in the summer too. We had to take some time off because the tour cycle took about three years, like writing recording touring, and then I got arrested. The whole legal thing took over a year of my life, during which we toured in the states and afterwards we finished up the touring cycle. It was a rough, rough year so thank god it‚Äôs behind me. So we got done touring South Africa in January and I started working on my book, which should come out sometime in 2015, it‚Äôs being edited now. It‚Äôs a book called ‚ÄúDark Days,‚Äù which is basically about what happened over in the Czech Republic. My editor sent me back the manuscript, so I have to approve edit that by January. So that should be out sometime in the summer maybe, not sure how long it‚Äôs gonna take.\n\nWhat else is going on with you?\n\nI have a gallery exhibit photo show in New York on May 2nd at Sacred Art Gallery in Soho. So I‚Äôm gonna be showing there, gonna be busy between now and then with printing, making everything print ready which is something I haven‚Äôt worked with a lot. I‚Äôm composing a new piece for the Richmond Ballet, last year a friend of mine choreographed a piece for the Richmond Ballet, and I did the music. Had Alex from Testament add some guitar parts, because he‚Äôs really great. It‚Äôs really cool to do music for the ballet because they don‚Äôt fucking know who Lamb of God is, they don‚Äôt give a fuck about heavy metal, but they dig the stuff I did. My buddy is choreographing another piece, and he wanted to use me again and they were totally stoked. Creativity is in overdrive."
