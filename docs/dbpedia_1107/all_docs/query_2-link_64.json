        "text": "From the marketing, it was hard to know exactly what to make of Hardcore Henry. The name sounded pornographic, the concept sounded like a gimmick that would likely cause motion sickness, and it seemed like a somewhat cheap ploy to trick the millions of FPS gamers around the world into setting down their controllers and paying $13.50 for a movie ticket.\n\nFor a movie that seemed aimed squarely at someone like me, I had to practically drag myself to the theater to see it. Reviews were less than stellar, and the promos hadn’t wowed me. But I gave it a shot all the same.\n\nBoy, am I glad I did.\n\nTechnically, my title is cheating. This isn’t a “video game movie” in the sense that it’s adapting an existing game like Resident Evil or Silent Hill, or upcoming features like Warcraft or Asssassin’s Creed. And yet, to not call it a video game movie is also disingenuous, as that’s clearly where it draws its entire inspiration. It is now not without some irony that the best video game movie ever was not based on a video game at all. But there’s really no other way to describe Hardcore Henry.\n\nHow you feel about the film will be based on your personal preferences much more than usual. It seems like a hard thing to judge objectively, given how the concept will resonate (or won’t) with certain crowds. As it turned out, this movie felt aimed squarely at me because…it was exactly the type of thing I like. I’m the type of guy who wrote AEQUITAS and VERITAS in sharpie on my fingers for a week after seeing Boondock Saints in high school. I’m the type of guy who used to enthusiastically watch 300 as a drinking pre-game before I headed out to a frat party in college.\n\nAnd today, I still have a bit of “bro” in me, as lame as that may be to admit. And that part of me was floored by Hardcore Henry, a movie I would have loved when I was 17, but I still actually loved today. Some things never change, I suppose.\n\nThe concept is deceptively simplistic. Henry is our mute protagonist who has a Go-Pro strapped to his head for the duration of the film. Only in this context, we’re viewing his “ocular feed” as Henry is actually an injured soldier put back together Robocop style for a secret weapons project. Problem is, the man who funded Henry’s resurrection, Akan (Dania Kozlovsky) wants him under his thumb, so he kidnaps his scientist wife (Haley Bennett, who you will swear is a clone of Jennifer Lawrence) and Henry must punch and kick and stab and shoot his way through his goons in order to get her back. Aiding him is the seemingly immortal Jerry (Sharlto Copely) who is so omnipresent throughout the film he’s practically its star, given the FPS view and Henry’s inability to say even a single word for the duration.\n\nIt’s hard to even know what to compare Hardcore Henry to, because I’ve quite honestly never seen anything like it, other than a few similar YouTube short films that shared this “Go-Pro action movie” concept.\n\nThe film it’s probably most like is Crank, given how relentlessly non-stop the action is. If the pace ever slows down for a second, it’s because Henry’s heart-battery charge is dying (wasn’t that literally the plot of Crank 2?) but otherwise there is always a head to be shot, a throat to be slit, an ass to be kicked. It’s a ninety minute film, but if it was any longer, the audience’s hearts might give out.\n\nThe game it emulates the most isn’t Call of Duty the way you might imagine (though there is a sequence where Henry trails a sniping ally in a Ghile suit that will certainly remind you of a certain famous mission from that series), but rather Hardcore Henry is like an AO-rated version of Mirror’s Edge. That’s how the movement and action feels, where you can see Henry’s hands and feet frequently, and he’s always ramping off ledges and disarming enemies up close. Far and away, the film channels Mirror’s Edge much more than any other game, just with the violence amplified a thousand percent.\n\nThe end result is actually quite a bit more exciting than most FPS video games. Call of Duty is the gold standard for this sort of thing, but in practice it’s really a lot of leisurely jogging and hiding behind walls waiting for your health to regen. Enemies die from two bullets, usually from quite a ways off. Not so in Hardcore Henry, which absolutely bathes in its up-close-and-personal violence in a way that few games and almost no movies manage to emulate.\n\nTo answer a common question, no the film did not make me motion sick, though I will admit a few of the higher jumps made my stomach rise a bit in my chest, if only for a moment. I cannot say that it will make no one else sick, because some people are just more sensitive to that sort of thing, but for me it was fine. And another concern, that the action would be muddled, didn’t ring true for me at all. Quite the opposite, actually. Using this constant, fixed first-person camera, it’s actually a lot easier to follow these fight sequences than it is in the kind of shaky-cam Bourne-style fights we see all across action movies these days. It’s John Wick-level fluid, but in first-person view.\n\nI actually really appreciate what they did with the entire concept of the film as well. The mute protagonist isn’t 100% necessary for something like this, but it definitely worked here, as it planted the audience front and center as the main character in a way that’s even more effective than when games do the same thing. But what elevates the film from good to great is its use of sci-fi, not just in Henry’s robo-rebuilding, but taking the crazy all the way to eleven with an infinitely multiplying Sharlto Copely and a villain who is an insane albino with telekinetic powers they never bother to be explain (some sort of bionic implant, I assume). And surprisingly, it’s a very funny movie. Not a comedy, obviously, but there are more than a few laugh-out-loud moments drawn from simply how ridiculous the film is comfortable being.\n\nThough the movie is clearly aimed at the gamer crowd, it is one of the most kid-unfriendly movies I have ever seen, and by the end I was genuinely horrified there were eight year-olds in the front row in front of me. Like, forget the topless prostitutes, this movie features some of the most brutally violent kills I have ever seen in a film, like someone locked a dozen serial killers in a room and wouldn’t let them out until they had written down 1,000 shocking ways to kill people for use in this movie. I do not wince often when it comes to media violence at this point, but Henry is brutal in a way unlike many other films, in part because of its FPS concept. It’s like when Grand Theft Auto V suddenly felt ten times more sickening when the first-person camera was introduced in the re-release. Once you are there, plunging the knife into the neck or pulling the trigger to blow a skull wide open, it takes things to an entirely new level. This is not a criticism, as I thought the over-the-top gore was perfect for a movie like this, but it is a warning to potential viewers.\n\nMy question is why no other video game film ever tried something like this before a non-game film made the idea work for itself. There’s that one sequence in the DOOM movie where the camera switches to first person to emulate the game, but most video game movies are trying to adapt first or third-person games into traditional films. It would have been kind of great if Call of Duty or Halo or Far Cry was able to make this work before some no-name came and swiped the concept, but props to Hardcore Henry for doing so.\n\nObviously this kind of concept is not necessarily going to work great in every context. Like, The Matrix or The Raid probably wouldn’t have been made better by this filming style, and there are some things it doesn’t do great. It works well for gunplay, but not so much for hand-to-hand combat where the camera veers around a bit too much out of necessity. But, in this pending age of VR, it’s hard not to imagine we’re going to start to see a lot more movies like Henry to fill that need either in theaters, or in at-home headsets.\n\nHardcore Henry does cinematic action better than most movies, and makes FPS violence more enthralling than most video games. It’s the best of both worlds, and while it might not be for everyone, it certainly was for me. And it may very well be for you too, so give it a chance if you were thinking about letting it pass you by.\n\nFollow me on Twitter and on Facebook.
