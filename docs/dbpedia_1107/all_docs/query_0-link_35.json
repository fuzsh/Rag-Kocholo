        "text": "MichaelGubi says:\n\nA recent sentence of the Austrian Supreme Court changed the legal situation of Streetphotography in Austria drastically. Till now photographing other people was allowed in public, even without asking them before. Only the publication of a photo was limited by various conditions. Respecting these conditions and their exclusions even allowed the publication of Streetphotos.\n\nThe new sentence now commits the photographer to ask persons for their permission before photographing them.\n\nI am curious how Streetphotographers in Austria will react in future to the new legal situation. Personally I just work on my photos from this weekend, which are now the last photos I took without an impending lawsuit.\n\nSorry, links only in German.\n\ndiepresse.com/home/recht/rechtallgemein/1385755/Persoenli...\n\nwww.ogh.gv.at/de/entscheidungen/weitere/foto-nur-mit-einw...\n\nOriginally posted at 1:50PM, 7 April 2013 PDT\n\nMichaelGubi edited this topic ages ago.\n\n_barb_ says:\n\nI think this would become a legal issue only if someone gets taken to court for photographing without permission and refusing to delete, as happened in the case that lead to this ruling.\n\nNo police force would be bothered with telling every tourist and casual shooter to not point their camera and smart phone at people in public, this is clearly unenforceable. Images of crowds at concerts, public gatherings and the like are not included in this ruling, as long as no individual was made the main focus of the image. (can of worms here.)\n\nThere are implications for publishing on photo sharing sites where people are able to identify themselves in pictures. Presumably, they could insist on deletion of the images.\n\nI tried to find a source in English for this case but there don't seem to be any available.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\n_barb_ edited this topic ages ago.\n\ncedrus` says:\n\nThis is one weird case...\n\nTo summarize (someone correct me here):\n\n- A man who owns a residential building was being sued for wage payments by contractors who did work on the building. The contractors' lawyer was meeting with the owner in that building for some work inspection. The owner pulls out a camera out of the blue and takes a picture of the lawyer. Lawyer asks why his picture was taken. Owner says \"for fun.\" He's asked to delete the photo, but after asking his own attorneys, refuses. Lawyer decides to sue.\n\nBoth the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals sided with the defendant, saying it's incomprehensible why a man cannot take pictures of people present in his own home, which was the case the here.\n\nBut then the Supreme Court sidestepped the homeowner's legal right into his 'intent.' He admitted that he took the picture 'for fun.' And they saw that this could extend into him altering the image (basically photoshop) to his own benefit, and in that case, a person's right to their own image (Recht am eigenen Bild) would apply.\n\nThis is still fine until you go to the consequence. As there is no difference between a public space and a privace space over there, the ruling extended to public spaces. And to other media forms as well (you can't video tape or do an audio recording of other people.)\n\nOn a more positive note, someone would still have to prove 'intent.' Meaning, they would need to prove that you aimed to take their picture specifically. (and they're not just passerbys in the shot)\n\nIf they ask you to delete the shot, there's little leeway to it. You'd just have to do it.\n\nages ago\n\nSteve {{--}} says:\n\nInteresting point Mark, also, what about film - could they ask for a full roll of Tri-X to be binned?\n\nI only hope that the whole thing can be wrapped in common sense. For example, whilst it is my legal right in the UK NOT to delete a photo, if I was asked I would.\n\nLikewise, in Australia it would be nice to think that you didn't feel threatened by taking pictures in public spaces, but if you did get questioned in an official capacity, that there would be a sensible outcome...\n\nI guess only time and an extreme, blown-out-of-proportion case will tell??\n\nages ago\n\nMichaelGubi says:\n\n@cedrus hiatus, thanks for your summary. And yes, the case is weird.\n\nThe main problem is that till now a photographer in Austria had 100% security that taking photos in public would not cause legal problems. That some people still regarded it as their holy right not being photographed, even if they haven´t been photographed, caused minor but regular problems. Now these sort of people can mix their importunity with the knowledge about this rather unclear sentence resulting in bigger and more annoying situations for photographers.\n\nThis sentence is one more step deteriorating civil rights in many european countries. I am sure that only individuals will be confronted by this sentence with stricter regulations, while camera surveillance of public places by large companies and government agencies will still increase.\n\nages ago\n\ncedrus` says:\n\n^ Absolutely.\n\nMark, I don't know really. I guess you'd be sued if it was uncovered that you didn't 'really' delete the picture. And for film, you'd have to burn the roll?\n\nA few more (boring) details about this:\n\n- There was no Austrian law against taking someone's picture without authorization. The absurd part (for me) is that the plaintiffs were citing a German law, the 'German Copyright Act' off all things, which both lower courts rejected. Yet the Austrian Supreme Court decided to adopt it and make a precedent. What the hell's that about? Imagine the outcry if Canada convicts someone based on a US law because they didn't have that specific law passed themselves...\n\nPlus, the Germans aren't required to take permission before shooting, if there's no intent to publish. So how did a German law get reinterpreted, let alone applied, in Austria so that it restricts the latter but not the former? Either the concept of 'Equal Protection Clause' doesn't have a European equivalent, or Germany might reassess its own law to fit the Austrian interpretation?\n\n- As for surveillance camers, they are allowed because they are not aimed at a 'specific' person (as opposed to the case in court) and they're just recording data with no intention to broadcast. (This is crazy!)\n\n- The one exception to the above, but that's not in the legal case here, is Google Street View. It was left to individual people to request from Google to not show their home in GSV. So far, about 250,000 households in Germany have done that and Google was forced to blur the images.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\ncedrus` edited this topic ages ago.\n\ncedrus` says:\n\nI don't get how the subject being old has anything to do with it. And this is completely different from Doisneau's case. He was an established photographer in a country where the law against taking candid shots of strangers had already passed.\n\nThis is about Austria where the law didn't exist but it now has a precedent with the court. And no one's picture got published. And no pro or amateur photographer was involved... It's about the 'behavior' more than the result.\n\nAnd I agree with Poagao. You're right that it's subjective to have solid statistics. But putting quality on the saide, as an estimate, how many more Germans (SP allowed) are on Flickr compared to French (not allowed)? Or how many more Canadians (allowed) compared to French Canadians (not allowed)?...\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\ncedrus` edited this topic ages ago.\n\n[theoria] says:\n\nFor all I know, there is the principle of the freedom of expression, which is enshrined in all the the constitutions of all cvilized countries, protecting the rights of the press and the artistic creation. Someone should invoke that principle at some point to stop the activity of photographers being arbitrarely restricted by regulations and newly created jurisprudence. I think this issue should be taken to one of the chief NGOs protecting freedom of speech or civil rights in general, that could effectively champion the rights of photographers. Otherwise in a few years time we will have the tabloid type bimbo and corrupt politicians interested in hiding their luxurious lifestyle perfectly protected and, on the other hand, no body of work like that produced by the 20th cent street and documentary photographers. It would be cataclismic. I mean imagine that our governments decide to destroy all the photographic archives because the pictures weren't properly taken. That would be the scale of the loss incurred by such injunctions. I don't want to live in some sort of photographic dark ages.\n\nages ago\n\nFredLM says:\n\nFreedom of speech is not absolute and was never intented to be absolute (in the declaration of the right of man, art 11 : \"The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.\"); That's the same in any european constitution. Freedom of speech may be restricted.\n\nIn France, former case law opposed for example respect of private life (art. 9 of the \"code civil\" from which is derived the image rights).\n\nIn the 90's, courts were more favorable to image rights. But, it has changed. Now, they are more favorable to freedom of speech.\n\nThe person who sues must prove there's a severe prejudice caused by the image publication else there's no way to win a trial.\n\nBut one must have in mind that commercial advertising is not included in the freedom of speech area. You can't use the image of a person in an advertising material without his consent.\n\nFreedom of speech concerns artistic, sociologic or photojournalistic work. For example, no problem to have an image in an exhibition (with the sole restriction there's no severe prejudice). But you can't use the same image to promote your stuff (e.g. business card, leaflet) without consent.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nFredLM (a group admin) edited this topic ages ago.\n\n[theoria] says:\n\nFredLM:\n\nOf course, freedom of speech isn't unlimited. For instance it doesn't include the right to slander someone and so on.\n\nNevertheless the lower level regulations (such as the \"civil code\"), it could be argued, might clash with the principles stipulated in constitutions, international treatises and so on. Sure, the contradiction isn't always obvious and views might change over time about how much one piece of legislation is at odds with the constitution and international treatises. What I am disposed to hold is that there is a case here, that can be argued for, namely that such legal provisions and decisions restrict some legitimate manifestations of the freedom of expression. As long as society deems street photography a journalistic/artistic activity that should be fostered rather than curtailed, the civil code should be amended because its provisions lead to situations where higher principles are violated. Our high esteem for the many of the photographic masterpieces which manifestly don't conform to the privacy regulations currently in force is sufficient ground for the conclusion that such artistic manifestations should not be thus restricted. On the practical side, there are courts of cassation, constitutional courts or the European Court of Human rights for challenging the said decisions and regulations. I'm not a lawyer, but I keep wondering why nobody went that way.\n\nages ago\n\nabundant mandible [deleted] says:\n\nsame law in Germany since a recent case in January 2015... before that there where many rules like\" if there are more than 5 people on the picture you don't have to ask them\" and later it was \"if there are more than 15 people...\" and so on and so on,\n\nnow even the pure shooting without asking is and illegal act.\n\nwe tried to discuss this at university in SP class, but just came to the conclusion, as long as we are students and do stuff for university we are aloud to do anything, as long we do not publish it somewhere else.\n\nI am not sure whether I want to give privacy to everybody on the streets or if I want to make nice pictures....\n\n112 months ago\n\n'Juanjo' says:\n\njustinsdisgustin:\n\nIt is a disgrace, really. This is coming after some police behavior was exposed in last year demonstrations, doing the rounds in twitter, facebook and half of the TV spectrum.\n\nThe law is supposed to protect police and other security forces agents when in duty, but it is just pure and plain censorship to allow current goverment to be re-elected again. There are some media campaigning for a change of goverment and in 2015 there are still many people in Spain which vote gets heavily influenced for whoever polititian is allowed to get TV time, so this came handy for the current goverment to try to counter attack media exposure by oppositors.\n\nMy guess is that it will be modified or even rolled back after the general elections at the end of the year, whoever wins.\n\n109 months ago"
