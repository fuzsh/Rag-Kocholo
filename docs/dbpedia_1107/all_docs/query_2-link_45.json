        "text": "weakmassive says:\n\nHere's an article from The Guardian in 2007. Trent Parke talks about his bus image from Dream/Life.\n\n(Ben Roberts was looking for this, let's see... 19 months ago, haha. Here you go.)\n\n-----\n\nLight is magical: it changes everything. A scene can look incredible when it's lit up, and then 10 minutes later it's completely changed. It's the searing sun that defines Australia and Sydney. You get an incredibly sharp, harsh light.\n\nThis bus image came about because I'd started to slow the shutter speed down while photographing Martin Place, the main business district in Sydney. In the corner of one of my pictures was a white van , and you could see someone's shadow cast onto the side of the vehicle. I couldn't work out how it had happened, so I kept going back to the same spot.\n\nI went each evening, for about 15 minutes, when the light came in between two buildings. It happens only at a certain time of the year: you've just got that little window of opportunity. I was relying so much on chance - on the number of people coming out of the offices, on the sun being in the right spot, and on a bus coming along at the right time to get that long, blurred streak of movement. If I didn't get the picture, then I was back again the next day. I stood there probably three or four times a week for about a month. I used an old Nikon press camera that you could pull the top off and look straight down into, because I was shooting from a tiny tripod that was only about 8cm high. I had tried to lie on the ground, but people wouldn't stand anywhere near me. I finally got this picture after about three or four attempts. I shot a hundred rolls of film, but once I'd got that image I just couldn't get anywhere near it again. That's always a good sign: you know you've got something special.\n\nThe fact that the images of the people on the bus have stayed sharp, and that you can see through them, is something that still baffles me. People can't understand what the image is, or how I was able to obtain it, and I can't work it out myself. It's something that the eye can't see when you're walking along. It's something that only photography can capture.\n\nInterview by Leo Benedictus.\n\nCurriculum vitae\n\nBorn: Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, 1971\n\nStudied: \"I didn't. I just picked up stuff from magazines.\"\n\nInspirations: \"Josef Koudelka, William Eggleston, all the masters.\"\n\nHigh point: \"Winning the Eugene Smith award.\"\n\nLow point: \"When Australian newspapers lost their sense of being great picture papers.\"\n\nDream subject: \"Having done one in black and white, my big dream now is to do a big road trip around Australia in colour.\"\n\nOriginally posted at 11:49AM, 8 May 2009 PDT\n\nweakmassive edited this topic ages ago.\n\nregular mailbox [deleted] says:\n\nWaxy, why is everyone labelled a troll if they have an argument that goes against the grain??? That is such an internet cliche, troll - using this word basically means shows me that you have nothing intelligent to offer to the debate at hand. Also, what is this name dropping, Ben etc\n\nAlso, using the bold type TOP, well you've just basically admitted that you are one of those stereotypical magnum fans who fawn attention over there every move . Jeez, get over it. Besides, there are better shooters than Magnum people anyway. Have you even heard of someone like Stieglitz? There are also other TOP photographers in other agencies in France in case you weren't aware.\n\nYes, I am new to flickr, I haven't been here long, but you have to get the flickr portfolio established at sometime. So what if I came onto HCSP late in the game, and so what if I am bringing some valid points from my past experience. It has always been a toss up for me whether to join flickr as I was aware that people are so politically sensitive to any comments that go against general consensus.\n\nCriticism is healthy, as it can keep your photo skills sharp, instead of resting on your laurels. Take it or leave it!\n\nages ago\n\nregular mailbox [deleted] says:\n\nKing Mason, that Parke article didn't offend me, just wished that the HCSP member who posted it, would have followed it up with some worthy critique. Dropping names of famous photogs doesn't get one street cred. unless there are some worthy comments to accompany the article. Sure I have met two hardcore magnum guys at a workshop, but does that make me a better photographer. No, it doesn't, but it is what you take away from it at the end of the day that counts.\n\nJinju, instead of thinly veiled sarcasm which doesn't achieve anything, at least have the manner to lay down your counter-arguments in an effective manner. Sarcasm is pointless and the least form of intelligence.\n\nAfter I get my photos posted, you will see that my point of view is justified. It is entertaining to listen to people talk as if they know Trent Parke in person. So what if someone saw his work in Photofusion, does that make there work better? At the end of the day, NO it doesn't!\n\nPeople in the HCSP flickr group just don't like someone who is prepared to form a different opinion. Being a dissident will make my work stand out from the rest.\n\nages ago\n\nJohn Goldsmith says:\n\nAfter I get my photos posted, you will see that my point of view is justified.\n\nWaiting.\n\nBeing a dissident will make my work stand out from the rest.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nYou sure are setting the bar high. I hope you don't disappoint. You come here being argumentative and with no identity and no photos. That is why you are a troll -- and for no other reason.\n\nNot every posted article has to have a point. Sometimes people just wish to share something they have read. Weakmassive added Ben's name in parenthesis because he remembered that post from 19 months ago and was following up. It isn't name dropping any more than you mentioning Stieglitz. And yes, we all know Stieglitz. Adding Ben's his name was a courtesy and a mark of a good memory. Sorry that irks you.\n\nMaybe you should just add your wonderful photos and then we can discuss them instead of that crappy one from Parke, attention seeker.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nJohn Goldsmith edited this topic ages ago.\n\nweakmassive says:\n\nDrew,\n\nSo many of these threads end up in mudslinging, and I was hoping this one wouldn't end up that way and you would just get over it.\n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with me just posting an article about street photography to a street photography group. It surely didn't warrant you making assumptions about where I'm at with my photography. No, I don't think this is his best shot. Happy?\n\nYes, I like Magnum and Trent Parke. I also like many other photographers. So what. In the above article, Parke \"name drops\" Koudelka as an influence. Should he \"get out more\"? What a Magnum fanboy! You say \"get out more\", then you drop Stieglitz. Seriously?\n\nAnd what about \"referring to magnum members for guidance\". You went to a workshop with them. I posted a freaking article.\n\nSorry, but this is getting ridiculous.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nweakmassive edited this topic ages ago.\n\nthechrisproject says:\n\nDrew - Your claim of constant adulation is hyperbolic. The initial post was someone sharing information without adulation. WAXY pointed out that the technique isn't all that crazy. There were a few \"neats\" and some thanks for the information sharing. Hughes basically found the same technique. Some people really liked it, but I don't see anyone holding the shot or Parke up as a shining beacon of photographic exploration. And then you bitch about people holding using Magnum members for guidance but at no point do you explain why this is bad. In the other thread you then use a Magnum member's guidance to prove your point.\n\nI'm sensitive to good counterarguments in the sense that a good argument will actually make me change my mind. I'm not pigheaded; you just haven't provided anything of substance yet! I also like how you deride name dropping and then drop names.\n\nOkay, you went to a cool workshop. I'm sincerely jealous (really). I think you're pumped up on your photography, and that's cool. I think you want to see yourself as a dissident, and that my posting this will actually only help you be the photographer you want to be, which is the only reason I'm about to hit the \"post now\" button.\n\nYou want to actually converse? Then let's talk about who are better photographers. Let's talk about why you don't think Parke's work is all that great. Let's talk about why you aren't big on Magnum... and about the fucking photographs. If your only reason for disliking them is that other people like them, well, that's bullshit.\n\nages ago"
