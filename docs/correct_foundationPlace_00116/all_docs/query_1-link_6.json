While business enterprises are pushing hard to enable complete intelligence, consumers are also eagerly willing to benefit from it. AI has the capability to influence all areas of business like improving customer experience by providing personalized content, chiselling out new ‘revenue’ opportunities for retailers, and most importantly - Digging out never seen before insights! After all, revenue is what matters the most for any business and AI is evolutionary for online retailers. Learn all this in 30 mins in this webinar.\n\nDistributed Development\n\nDistributed DevelopmentTechExcel\n\nDistributed development is not only a fact of life for many teams but it is a growing segment of the agile community. This is despite the fact that the very idea of physically distributing teams seems to conflict with agile communication practices. Teams using agile tend to rely heavily on face-to-face communication as a replacement for lengthy and often tedious documentation. Being geographically separated will of course interfere with this form of communication.\n\nAgile Project Management\n\nAgile Project ManagementTechExcel\n\nIn recent years there has been a drastic increase in the growth rate of technology. Software complexity and CPU processing speeds have risen at a rate much closer to exponential than linear. This increased rate of change has caused a chain reaction of increased market volatility that in turn requires organizations to be able to quickly adapt to consumer demands. Slow moving dinosaurs are generally considered less competitive and at greater risk of shipping features that are “old news” or obsolete.\n\nA Practical Guide to Implementing SLAs\n\nA Practical Guide to Implementing SLAsTechExcel\n\nIf you are reading this, then you’ve probably decided or been asked to implement a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Questions are starting to run through your head like “What’s all the fuss about? How is this going to help the company, our employees, and our team? Realistically, what are the downsides and how do we avoid them?” Well, you’re in luck. This whitepaper lays out everything you need to know about SLAs. By the time you finish reading this, you will be able to successfully plan, implement, report, improve on your SLAs, and reap the associated benefits.\n\nOptimizing CRM Processes\n\nOptimizing CRM ProcessesTechExcel\n\nThe Internet has fundamentally changed the way we do business, and it has created huge opportunities for entirely new business models, from Web portals to e-commerce. Many of these new companies have succeeded, and many have failed, but this first wave of the Internet economy has set the stage for even more innovation and success throughout all sectors of business. As exciting as the dot-com revolution was, the Internet continues to provide an even greater opportunity for more traditional businesses.\n\nApplication Lifecycle Management\n\nApplication Lifecycle ManagementTechExcel\n\nTo truly optimize the management and development processes, distributed teams require a more knowledge-centric ALM approach that will bridge the gaps between teams and smooth the transitions during each phase of the development lifecycle. TechExcel’s DevSuite was designed with this concept in mind. Every team within a development organization should interact with, and contribute to the ALM knowledge cycle. The end result is a collaborative environment that saves significant time and resources and enables the enterprise to bring better products to market faster.\n\nChange Management Best Practices\n\nChange Management Best PracticesTechExcel\n\nMany IT organizations are familiar with the Monday Morning Crisis. Most IT problems are realized on Monday mornings because a change was implemented over the weekend and no formal process was followed. The organization is sent into reactive mode as IT struggles to resolve the issue and get everything back up and running. Change Management was created to handle situations just like this. A good change management process acts like a traffic controller at an airport. It will make certain that everything flows smoothly and that there are limited communication gaps.\n\nITIL Process Guide\n\nITIL Process GuideTechExcel\n\n1. The document provides descriptions for the key processes in Incident Management, Change Management, and Problem Management as configured in sample projects in the TechExcel ServiceWise ITSM solution. 2.

Weaving looms are pivotal in textile production, enabling the interlacing of warp and weft threads to create diverse fabrics. Our exploration begins with traditional handlooms, which have been in use since ancient times, preserving artisanal craftsmanship. We then move to frame and pit looms, simple yet effective tools for small-scale and traditional weaving. Advancing to modern industrial applications, we discuss power looms, the backbone of high-speed textile manufacturing. These looms, integral to LD Texsol's product range, offer unmatched productivity and consistent quality, essential for large-scale apparel, home textiles, and technical fabrics. Rapier looms, another modern marvel, use rapier rods for versatile and rapid weaving of complex patterns. Next, we explore air and water jet looms, known for their efficiency in lightweight fabric production. LD Texsol's state-of-the-art electronic Jacquard machines exemplify technological advancements, enabling intricate designs and patterns with precision control. Lastly, we examine dobby looms, ideal for medium-complexity patterns and versatile fabric production. This presentation will deepen your understanding of weaving looms, their applications, and the innovations LD Texsol brings to the textile industry. Join us as we weave through the history, technology, and future of textile production.
