        "text": "See other formats\n\n-4 www.n-gage.com/developers www.gdconf.com WELCOME Dear Friends and Colleagues, As I'm sure you've noticed, the theme for the Game Developers Conference in 2004 is \"Evolve.\" Evolution occurs all around us, usually in slow and gradual steps. It seems, however, that evolution in the game industry occurs at an exponentially more rapid pace, year over year, generation over generation. This year's conference program features some of our industry's most critical and creative thinkers. They'll examine the evolutionary trends in game development both in specificity and granularity and lend a contextual framework for the larger issues affecting our industry. In keeping with this year's \"Evolve\" theme, I'd like to point out two notable additions to the GDC this year: ► In conjunction with TNC Network, I encourage you to participate in the first Gamehotel fd GDC (Thursday, March 25th, 6-8pm, Civic Auditorium] to see how game culture drives today's popular culture. Guests joining the dialogue include award winning music video directors from Europe and action figure and urban vinyl artists from Hong Kong. ►■ The GDC is proud to host many speakers from Japan each and every year. This year, every session will be simultaneously translated from Japanese to English. Of course, the 4th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards (Wednesday, March 24th, 6:30pm, Civic Auditorium] is the highlight of the GDC. Celebrate at the ceremony and congratulate your peers at the reception afterwards. GDC 2004 is a gravity point for the industry's evolution and I thank you for being a part of it.

While there is no question that studios are in this business to make great games, be competitive and prosper, there are meta-level business issues that effect us day-to-day that we need to come together as a community and deal with - or at least explore - on the whole. This \"Think-Tank\" provides a rare opportunity for studio heads, publishing executives and other industry leaders to come together in a neutral forum, roll up their sleeves and work out solutions to some of the biggest issues facing game development studios today.

Experimental Gameplay Workshop Jonathan Blow 3-6pm • J2, Convention Center Traditional art forms like music, film, and literature have established mechanisms for encouraging experimental works, and for bringing these new ideas into the mainstream creative process. These mechanisms prevent an art form from iterating endlessly on proven successes and ultimately stagnating creatively. The Experimental Gameplay Workshop aims to: provide a platform for game designers to showcase risky new work and discuss it with their peers, legitimize gameplay research, and development and create a community of experimental game designers. The Experimental Gameplay Workshop is a gathering of game developers interested in new and risky game designs. It consists of several presentations by experimental game authors, followed by peer discussion. Presentations are formal 20- minute sessions where an experimenter demonstrates a game and gives a short lecture about the game's experimental aspects. Each presentation will focus on the new gameplay, tradeoffs and decisions made, difficulties overcome, and problems remaining in the design. A short discussion session and O&A follow each presentation.

Your visions are the future of videogames, but those visions are often held prisoner to limiting technologies, timelines, techniques, tradeoffs and price tags. Came players' skyrocketing expectations, though, will not be abated. You're demanding ways to make better games, faster. Better ways to break new ground, faster. Better ways to design around fun, not around discontinuous technologies. Is there a faster path to Game of the Year accolades and to the hearts of the mass market? How can you spend less time plumbing and more time playing with your game designs? What roles do new software tools, services, and support play in your future? We'll talk about how we can help you finally attain your mind-blowing visions. We'll talk about reaching another level of mass-market greatness. J Allard: As one of The Hollywood Reporter's \"Top 35 Under 35,\" J Allard was recognized in 2003 as being one of the most promising young executives to lead the entertainment industry. As corporate vice president of the Xbox Platform, Allard drives digital entertainment initiatives by overseeing operating systems, hardware and online strategies and ensuring that Xbox Live continues to be the world's largest and most innovative, all- broadband gaming service. In 1993, Allard, with his memo to top executives, \"Windows: The Killer Application for the Internet,\" led the charge to get Microsoft involved online. But Allard's real claim-to-fame was his ability to expand the company's commitment to the promise of digital entertainment. His role in the creation of the Xbox led Business 2.0 to call Allard a \"Baby Bill,\" one of a handful of young Microsoft executives driving the company into the future. Before joining Xbox, Allard and his team developed an FTP and Web server for the Windows NT® operating system and started the company's Web server initiative- Internet Information Server, which has become one of the most widespread commercial Internet server products available for businesses on the Internet. Joining the company out of college in 1991, Allard began his career by laying out the company's TCP/IP networking strategy and defining the Windows Sockets API, the key API for Internet computing. Allard has participated in the Internet Engineering Task Force, served on the Internet Architecture Board and consulted on future Internet protocols, to be deployed in Internet. Allard has a bachelor's degree in computer science from Boston University. Robert J. Bach: As senior vice president of the Home and Entertainment division at Microsoft Corp. and chief Xbox officer (CXO), Robbie Bach directs a global division that is committed to delivering consumer hardware and software products and the most realistic, intense and action-packed game experiences to gamers around the world. As CXO, Bach manages the entire Microsoft Xbox video game system effort, including the teams that oversee hardware, third-party game development, games published under the Microsoft Game Studios label, Xbox operations, marketing, research, sales and support. He also manages the large group of engineers making Xbox Live, the world's largest all-broadband gaming service. Under Bach's leadership, Xbox has been enthusias- tically embraced by the games industry and gamers alike. The world's top game companies have committed to Xbox, including more than 200 worldwide third-party publishers and developers. In his 14 years at Microsoft, Bach has been responsible for everything from small business marketing and OEM programs, to major product launches and marketing for Microsoft's family of productivity applications, including Microsoft Office, Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Outlook, Publisher, the FrontPage and Works., Before joining the HED team in 1998, Bach was vice president of the Learning, Entertainment and Productivity Division at Microsoft, which developed and marketed home productivity, education, reference and games software. Before coming to Microsoft, Bach was a financial analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co. He holds a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of North Carolina, where his love of basketball was nurtured by fellow UNC student, Michael Jordan. Bach received a master's degree in business administration from Stanford University.

Why do we seek new experiences, the latest software, the newest gadgets? Why should game playing be any different? Should game developers care about innovation? As game development costs rise, taking a risk with the design of your game becomes an increasingly difficult decision to make. By reproducing the gameplay of a previously- successful title, common wisdom goes, you can maximize the chances that your title will also be a success. But new and exciting experiences are what keep game players interested; creating something unique is absolutely fundamental if you are to truly maximize your possibility for success. However, this is a delicate balance - certainly we all know of games which have gone too far \"out there\", which were unique and interesting experiences, but failures in the marketplace. One of the key factors to the success of PlayStation has been a clear focus on the experience of the player. Providing new and innovative experiences for the player to enjoy is fundamental to the success of the platform. Further, innovation in the platform hardware can encourage broader acceptance in the marketplace; innovation via unique peripherals can encourage developers to create unique games; and innovation through first-party software can attract new game players and forge new gameplay styles for other titles to explore further.

An encounter with a Apple II Computer software \"Kaleidoscope\" at age nineteen changed his life dramatically. The images were mesmerizing, but he felt something was missing. He added music to it, his very first experience as a producer of computer entertainment. In April 1983 Masaya formed the band PYS'S (pronounced \"Size\") with female vocalist Chaka.The band pushed the frontiers of computer music, but the state of digital media at the time wasn't enough to satisfy Masaya 's creativity. After ten albums and several hit songs, PSY'S disbanded in August 1996. In 1993 Masaya explored new ground by combining music and multimedia with the release of The Seven Colors. It was the first CD-ROM from a Japanese musician and went on to win the Multimedia Grand Prix of 1993. The Seven Colors was followed byTOOL-X in 1994 and Tunin' Glue in 1996, both multimedia music titles that offered completely new ways to enjoy music. December 1996 saw the release of Parappa the Rapper in Japan. It was like no other game that came before it, and it took Japan by storm. Parappa the Rapper went on to win the 1996 CECA Award, the Japan Software Award, and was named Japan Game of the Year 1997 by the readers of eighteen domestic game magazines. In 1999 Masaya crossed over from rap to hard rock with Um Jammer Lammy, and the game won an SCEI Gold disc after just two months. Masaya 's imagination doesn't end with music games. Vib-Ribbon, released in Japan and Europe in 1999, is another game revolution that creates gameplay from the player's own favorite music CD. Parappa the Rapper 2 was released in Japan in 2001 and is now available worldwide. In 2003, Masaya produced and composed sounds for the new Aibo,\"ERS-7\", which was very experimental and exciting work for him. Now in November 2003, Masaya releases mojibribbon for PS2 in Japan. This is a network title that has very unique style of blending rhythm and Japanese calligraphy using speech synthesis technology to convert text into rap sound.

In this book, Andrew Glassner provides a solid foundation in the fundamentals of classical story and game structure and addresses the challenges in bringing these two activities together. Interactive Storytelling: Provides solid foundations in classical story and game structure Clearly articulates the issues of interactive storytelling Discusses past and present approaches Presents a wide range of new ideas and techniques Offers a large number of experiments and new directions for the future \"I found this book both enlightening and a good tool to test and temper my own beliefs on the subject. It combines solid foundational material with clear insights into current problems along with possible solutions, all in a readable style.\" —Eric Haines, co-author of Real-Time Rendering, 2nd Edition \"Glassner's book shows remarkable insight into the problems of game design, combined with a powerful analytical approach to the problems of insinuating storytelling elements into games. He rejects the concept of interactive storytelling and offers instead his notion of 'participatory' storytelling.

As a new addition to GDC, GAMEHOTEL (a highly successful event series launched in Paris in 2003) spotlights the intense desire of industry players as well as a growing audience, for a rich and diverse future of interactive entertainment. Expect a refreshing and exuberant show chock full of highlights, screenings, talks and showcases - as well as a whole lot of fun. You'll walk away from GAMEHOTEL with your brain bursting with fresh ideas and a deeper understanding of games as a driving force of today's pop culture. The stellar lineup of the two-hour show: The desire to constantly expand the horizon of video games has lead visionary Tetsuya Mizuguchi (Space Channel 5, Sega Rally Championship) to design the mind-blowing musical shooter Rez. Check in at GAMEHOTEL to find out what's currently on his radar. Directors Ludovic Houplain, Herve de Crecy, and Francois Alaux, from French studio H5, have crafted some of the most beautiful clips of past few years. Prepare to be surprised by their ever-expanding adventures in music video, like their twisted CG homage to a roster of dance icons (from Prince and James Brown to Michael Jackson and Jamiroquai). With a keen eye on the future of games, SCEE's Executive Vice President, Development, Phil Harrison played a critical role in the successful launch of Sony's EyeToy. To him, this was only a guidepost for things to come in the near future, as novel interfaces open up new gameplay possibilities, paving the way for mass acceptance of gaming. From PaRappathe Rapper to Vib Ribbon all the way to his latest tour de force Mojibribon, Masaya Matsuura, master of eccentric excellence, stretches the elastic boundaries of the games medium, and provides inspiration well beyond the confines of the industry. Miho & Ryosuke Tei from hyper-active designer collective FuriFuri Company relentlessly redefine Toyko's pop culture continuum with their visual madness. Their Manga-style characters move virally through the many levels of toys, videogames, TV or fashion brands. CEO of up-and-coming development studio Newtgames, Mathieu Castelli knows how to seduce women. His ambition was to develop a location-based wireless game as exciting as the massively multiplayer games targeted at hardcore gamers. And guess what? It turns out the vast majority of the subscribers to this stylish Tokyo-based game are women. A dazzling selection of outstanding Urban Vinyls from the likes of Michael Lau, Brothersfree, Eric So, Koji Takeuchi, and many more, will be on display at GAMEHOTEL's infamous Designer Toy Showcase, set up in collaboration with KIDROBOT. An absolute must for action figure aficionados and novices alike, where you may very well discover some of tomorrow's game heroes.

Presented by: EXPO PASS SESSIONS Panel - All Came Design Challenge: The Love Story Raph Koster, Warren Spector, Will Wright, Eric Zimmerman See pages nj-i4ifor bios Thursday, March 25 • 9-ioam A3, Convention Center What would happen if commercial constrains were removed the from the game design process? What if developers were free to create games that were radically experi- mental? How would designers react if they were confronted with some of the great unsolved game design problems? In the Game Design Challenge, you get to see how game design veterans answer these questions. A few months before the GDC, the panelists in the Game Design Challenge were given a design problem: come up with a concept for a game that tells a love story. At the Game Design Challenge session, they each present their solution. Each love story game concept offers a very different approach to this particular game design challenge, and each has been conceived for different gaming platform. In addition to presenting their game concepts, the panelists are able to critique each others' work and the audience is also be encouraged to join in the critical discussion as well. More than just a design exercise, the Game Design Challenge asks expert game designers to think on their feet as they address important game design problems. Their answers to the challenge just might contain the seeds of gaming's future. Expect an unpredictable session of innovative and unusual game design ideas along with free- wheeling dialogue and debate. Takeaway: Each game concept that the panelists present is a \"snapshot\" of the early game design process. In this way, the audience get a glimpse of how game designers formulate game concepts and begin to sketch them out into a full-fledged design. Critique, discussion, and debate is also an important part of concept development, and there is plenty of critical feedback among the panelists as well. Attendees will get a glimpse into some very original thinking about how to solve difficult game design problems. Intended Audience: This session is intended for game designers, project leaders, and others involved in the conceptual aspects of game design and game development. Anyone interested in new ideas and out-of-the- ordinary game designs is encouraged to attend. Bring an open mind and an interest in hearing unusual approaches to game design from some of the most established designers in the industry. Lecture - All Make Better Criticism: A Mature Form of Cultural Analysis Matteo Bittanti See page 118 for bio Wednesday, March 24 • 5:306:30pm Salon IV, Marriott \"If a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, does the tree make a noise? Does it even exist?\" What does this classic philosophical dilemma have to do with videogames? Everything. In this lecture, Matteo Bittanti argues that what the game industry really needs today is not only better games, but rather, better criticism. Whereas the production of games has made staggering advances in the last thirty years, the so-called professional game analysis has not really evolved. Rather, it regressed. Even today, the vast majority of videogame magazines are simply \"magalogs,\" consumer guides that talk about games in terms of their technical aspects, often relying on unintelligible, esoteric, and self-referential argot. Professional game criticism does not really explain why games work, how games work, and what effect they have on people. Will game criticism ever become a mature form of cultural analysis? Will it develop concise, systematic yet accessible concepts that apply to games, or will it remain a form of juvenile pastime? More importantly, can it become interesting for people who play games and for people who don't play (but always wanted to)? Takeaway: The GDC categorical imperative is \"make better games. \"It's time for an update: \"make better criticism.\" Why? Because if you can't explain if, why, how, and when the tree fell in the forest, nobody is going to care about the tree. This lecture provides some hints and tips on becoming better park rangers. Lecture - All Pitching an Original IP: Notes from the Field Chris Charla See page no for bio Thursday, March 25 • 3-4pm Salon III, Marriott Getting the chance to develop an original IP into a game is the holy grail for the independent developer, as well as for many teams inside larger companies. Taking an original IP to market is the riskiest play a publisher can make, but the one with the greatest potential rewards. How can an independent developer, or a team inside a larger company successfully pitch an original IP, or totally new game style? Digital Eclipse has gained considerable experience since it first started showing an original game, and engine, behind closed doors, at last year's GDC. This one hour session shares some of the successes and failures the company has experienced over the past year, and in the process helps other developers, whether independent or part of a larger organization, understand what it takes to attempt to get funding for their original projects. Takeaway: Attendees leave with a better understanding of both the general things that they need to successfully present an original game idea, as well as the specific things that the top tier (and second tier) publishers are looking for today when evaluating an original IP (or, to a lesser extent, an original engine). Additionally, attendees leave with a good understanding of where their work pitching and developing an original IP will lead, even if their game doesn't get made, there could be beneficial outcomes (as there already have been for Digital Eclipse).

But they all have limitations, some of them work on some platforms and not others, each is appropriate for different situations. This lecture introduces each method and briefly discusses their major features and limitations. It then explores how to mix and match the various methods in a practical large-world engine on real console hardware. The lecture is mainly about the tricks and tips, where corners can be cut, when to use each technique, and the efficiency and scalability of each. The emphasis is using these methods in a practical game with large, complex and unconstrained scenes, rather than simply writing a technology demo. Takeaway: The lecture introduces the audience to the variety of shadowing algorithms available, and discusses when each is appropriate for the type of scene, the desired effect, and the available hardware. Lecture - Intermediate User-testing in a Hostile Environment: Overcoming Apathy and Resistance in Came Companies Bill Fulton & Ramon Romero See pages 123 & 135 for bios Friday, March 26 • io:30-ii:3oam J3, Convention Center The importance of formal user-testing methods (i.e., methods developed by psychologists and HCI/Usability researchers for testing products with consumers) as a means of improving games in development has been a growing topic of interest among game developers in the past few years. However, mere anecdotes and examples of the value of these methods are unlikely to get a game company or publisher to \"dip a toe in\" and even investigate these formal methods; getting them to 'take the plunge' and make large changes to the standard game development process that increase costs can be seemingly impossible and take years. The primary goal of this talk is to share some insight in ways to advocate user-testing in a company where important staff may be apathetic or resistant to changing from the usual development process. The secondary goal is to share some guidelines for how to create user-testing processes that raise the likelihood that user-testing will 'catch on' and eventually become integrated in the standard development cycle. This talk is the third in series on user-testing and games, and is designed for an audience that understands the basic concepts of user-testing, believes that they are valuable, and wants to begin 'evangelizing' user- testing to a company that is apathetic or even hostile to the idea. This talk does NOT make the case that user-testing is useful, go into detail on specific user-testing methods or show anecdotes from real gamers, because that was covered in two previous GDC talks. Both talks can be downloaded at www.microsoft.com/playtest/publications.htm. This talk is a case study from two of the four founding members of the Games User-testing Group at Microsoft Game Studios, which does user- testing on all titles that Microsoft develops or publishes. They have help grow the group from one researcher in 1997 to 37 in 2003. Takeaway: Members of the audience take away opinions and insight for how to overcome significant apathy or resistance about the idea of doing user-testing in a game company. The audience will also get principles for how to increase the likelihood that early user-testing efforts are successful, and prove their value. Intended Audience: The intended audience for this talk is anyone who is already convinced of the value of user-testing and is looking to \"evangelize\" it and have it play a greater role in a game development company or publisher. Designers, producers, and managers trying to advocate user-testing in their company, and HCI/usability professionals trying to break into the games business should find it useful. Having at least a conceptual understanding of the value of user-testing is necessary for this talk to be informative. -27- MEDIA SPONSORS Gamasutra.com Camasutra is the largest independent web site devoted to the art and science of making games.

Casey Wardynski, Doug Whatley, Michael Zyda See pages 117-141 for bios ioam-6pm • A6, Convention Center The Serious Games Summit is a two-day event covering the intersection of games, learning, policy and management. Today, major corporations, government and military institutions, foundations, educators and non- profits are turning to games and commercial entertainment technologies as an exciting new approach to solving problems. The result is a new field where computer and video games are applied to \"serious\" purposes other than entertainment that represents a growing financial outlet for game developers, where projects can produce social return in addition to an economic one. To help share current knowledge, expand communication among peers and advance emergent best practices, the Summit brings together a number of speakers, presentations and panels that will appeal to customers, developers and evangelizers of serious games. Intended Audience: The Serious Games Summit agenda is designed to address shared and specific areas of concern to several key groups interested in this topic. This includes professional developers who want to understand how to develop new business in this emerging market, educators and gaming advocates looking at new ways to utilize interactive game technologies, and represen- tatives from corporate, government and non- government organizations who are looking to fund and utilize game projects to advance specific needs, and organizational agendas. Content at the summit addresses all of these issues and more relevant to each key constituency. Takeaway: Attendees of the Serious Games Summit learn how extensive the application of games and game technology is and can be outside of the traditional use of entertainment. Attendees also gain considerable hands-on insight on how to successfully launch new serious game projects and advance things beyond the experiments and pioneering endeavors that have taken place so far. This includes developers learning how to attack new markets, and potential users obtaining a much deeper level of understanding on how to make their present and future projects much more successful. ► (351) • Developer Business Summit: An IGDAThink-Tank Jason Delia Rocca, Michael Gartenberg, Bing Gordon, Robert Huebner, Karl Jeffery, Ray Muzyka.Tamra Nestler Fionda, Kathy Schoback, Greg Richardson, Eric Zimmerman See pages 117-141 for bios ioam-6pm • A"
