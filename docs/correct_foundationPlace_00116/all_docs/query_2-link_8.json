        "text": "The Ivy Tech Nursing program can be a challenging, yet rewarding, program. Before you apply, review the following requirements and expectations for nursing students.\n\nTime Commitment\n\nThe Associate of Science in Nursing and Practical Nursing programs require a major commitment of time and energy. Nursing courses are typically scheduled over 3-4 days per week. Students may also need to schedule additional general education courses as needed each semester. It is essential that you plan for the same amount of study time as class time per week. Nursing course schedules and assignment due dates will not be adjusted to accommodate individual work schedules.\n\nYou can expect to spend the following hours each week in active contact for your courses (based on 8-week courses):\n\nLecture classes: 1 classroom contact hours per credit hour (so if a class is worth 3 credit hours, expect 6 contact hours)\n\nLab classes: 2 lab contact hours per credit hour\n\nClinical courses: 3 clinical contact hours per credit hour\n\nAttendance\n\nStudents are expected to attend all class meetings, or other activities assigned as a part of a course of instruction. Attendance is necessary to maximize student-learning opportunities. Students who are absent are responsible for missed material. Clinical courses require that the student be present to effectively evaluate successful achievement of clinical course objectives and concepts, as clinical course objectives cannot be accomplished or evaluated outside the clinical setting. There are no make-up sessions for missed clinical hours; therefore, regular clinical attendance is mandatory for successful clinical course and program completion. These clinical locations may be up to one hour drive in any direction of the Ivy Tech full-service campus where you are enrolled.\n\nThe online application system allows students to apply to any nursing program and any location within the statewide system. Carefully consider the implications of being accepted to a campus requiring extended driving distances.\n\nMandatory Drug Testing and Criminal Background Screening\n\nAll nursing program clinical affiliates require mandatory drug testing and criminal background screening before allowing students to participate in clinical courses at their facilities. Results of these tests could impact your ability to complete nursing clinical courses and therefore, your ability to meet nursing program requirements for completion. Requiring criminal background and drug screenings ensures students meet the same standards as health care facility employees. Annual criminal background and drug screenings are required for all nursing students.\n\nEligibility for Licensure\n\nSuccessful program completion provides students eligibility to apply to a state board of nursing to take the licensure examination (NCLEX-RN for Associate of Science in Nursing and NCLEX-PN for Practical Nursing). The Indiana State Board of Nursing (ISBN) application for licensure includes questions about criminal history, substance abuse problems, malpractice judgments, and disciplinary action on previous licenses and certifications. Students are encouraged to review the questions located on the ISBN application for examination. Similar questions are found on other state board of nursing applications.\n\nIf an applicant answers yes to any of the questions located on the ISBN application for examination they will be required to submit a sworn affidavit. It is possible that an applicant would not be eligible for licensure or face license restrictions after completing the nursing program. Read more about the licensure application\n\nIn addition, the state of Indiana will not authorize a graduate to take a National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX®) without a social security number. This is a mandatory Indiana State Board of Nursing (ISBN) requirement and applications to test cannot be processed without it. The United States Immigration and Nationality Act identifies that all candidates applying to take the NCLEX exam are required to be a U.S. citizen or be identified as a “Qualified Alien.” The U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act is found in the Federal Regulation 8 of the U.S.C.; Section 1641. In response to this federal legislation, Indiana Senate Bill SB419 became law in 2018 and provides for potential licensing of DACA and F1 in the state of Indiana. Students should seek their own legal counsel for concerns regarding these matters.\n\nNursing Program Student Requirements\n\nThe following are required for participation in clinical activities:\n\nAnnual criminal background and sex offender registry screening\n\nAnnual drug screening\n\nPhysical examination and verification of essential functions\n\nAnnual flu vaccination\n\nUp-to-date immunizations including Hepatitis B series, MMR, Varicella, Tdap, Diphtheria, Pertussis, and COVID-19\n\nAnnual TB skin testing or other documentation for positive tests per CDC guidelines\n\nDocumentation of current CPR Certification in Basic Life Support (BLS) for Health Care Providers from AHA or American Red Cross\n\nProof of ongoing unencumbered Indiana licenses or certifications for Licensed Practical Nurses, Medical Assistants, Military Medics,or Paramedics for the Transition to ASN track\n\nStudents interested in applying for admission to a nursing program should begin locating childhood immunization records early to ensure complete vaccination and physicals are submitted by established deadlines.\n\nStudents with disabilities are required to contact the college Disabilities Support Staff at the campus of interest for assistance in requesting accommodations (if applicable).\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nConnect with the Financial Aid team at your home campus to find out if you can receive financial aid for the program of your choice. Make sure that you have completed the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) by the established deadlines to be considered for financial aid assistance.\n\nREQUEST MORE INFO APPLY NOW\n\nPrerequisite Courses for Nursing\n\nCompletion of the following required prerequisite courses with a grade of “C” or higher is required for admission to the Associate of Science in Nursing:\n\nAPHY 101 Anatomy and Physiology I\n\nAPHY 102 Anatomy and Physiology II\n\nENGL 111 English Composition\n\nPSYC 101 Introduction to Psychology\n\nGen Ed Prerequisites\n\nIn order for prerequisite general education courses to count toward your program admission decision score, the course grades must be posted to Banner by the time the application site closes and auto-selection begins.

It is the applicant’s responsibility to ensure that transfer credit has been awarded and that TR grades are updated to transfer letter grades (TA, TB, TC) on their Ivy Tech transcript.\n\nIt is recommended that college transcripts be submitted to the Registrar’s office for evaluation and transfer credit at least 4 weeks prior to the program application deadline to ensure adequate time for processing.\n\nInformation Sessions\n\nProspective students must participate in a Nursing Information Session or complete an online Nursing Information Session within 3 months prior to applying. The completion of one Information Session fulfills the requirement for all Ivy Tech locations. No reservation is required.\n\nView Nursing Information Session Presentation Slide Deck\n\nContact your local campus to learn about upcoming Nursing Information Sessions\n\nRequired Testing and Documentation\n\nThe ASN and Practical Nursing programs at Ivy Tech have more specific admission criteria than Ivy Tech as a whole. Prospective students must:\n\nComplete the Knowledge Assessment if they do not have previous college credit, ACT, SAT, or PSAT scores on file in the Registrar’s Office\n\nComplete all required remedial courses (OXX) and any required co-requisites to those courses, prior to admission to the program (the first semester of nursing “NSGA” and “NSGP” courses).\n\nScore at the PROFICIENT level or higher on the ATI TEAS Test.\n\nSubmit a copy of their high school transcript or High School Equivalency Exam (GED or TASC) test scores.

High school transcripts must include date of graduation.\n\nCurrent high school students who will be graduating after the close of applications, but before the start of classes, are allowed to apply without a high school transcript and should submit a letter including anticipated graduation date and acknowledgment that the student will submit their high school transcript to the campus nursing dean by the indicated deadline.\n\nInternational students will need to provide official credential evaluation from a NACES-approved organization showing the equivalence of a U.S. high school diploma. Official evaluation must be sent directly from the credential evaluator to the Ivy Tech campus registrar. A copy of the original high school transcript and the NACES evaluation must be submitted with the nursing program admission application. The NACES process takes some time and includes an associated fee, so please contact NACES early.\n\nPrerequisite Transfer Credit\n\nStudents seeking transfer credit for prerequisite courses completed at other colleges desiring must submit transcripts from other colleges to the Registrar Hub for evaluation. Submit external college transcripts at least one month prior to the application deadline to allow for adequate time for evaluation and processing so that prerequisite course grades can be counted for points toward admission.\n\nThe email address students should relay to their colleges/universities for official transcripts to Ivy Tech is: transcripts@ivytech.edu\n\nThe mailing address students should relay to their colleges/universities for hard (paper) copies of official transcripts to Ivy Tech is:\n\nTranscript Processing\n\n9301 E 59th Street\n\nIndianapolis, IN 46216\n\nAPPLY NOW\n\nThe Assessment Technologies Institute’s (ATI) Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) is used as part of the admissions process by the Ivy Tech School of Nursing programs.\n\nSchedule Your TEAS Test Appointment Now\n\nTest Components\n\nThe ATI TEAS test measures your ability in four categories: Reading, English, Math, and Science. Your TEAS test must include all four test components to be considered valid; partial tests will not be accepted. Applicants must score at the PROFICIENT level or higher to be considered for admission. ATI TEAS sub-category scores will be used in the selection point system.\n\nPreparing for the TEAS Test\n\nA good time for a high school student to take the ATI TEAS test is during the last semester of high school or upon graduation. If an interested student graduated from high school a year or more ago, the test should be taken after review of high school content and after you’ve completed at least a portion of the prerequisite courses for nursing. All candidates must attend an Ivy Tech online Nursing information session prior to taking the TEAS exam.\n\nTEAS Deadlines & Timing\n\nThese dates will not change and will be consistent from year to year:\n\nSemester\n\nTEAS Deadline Date\n\nApplication Date\n\nFall April 30 May 15 Spring September 30 October 15 Summer January 15 February 1\n\nIvy Tech Testing Services does not offer the TEAS exam during the months of May or June, between the TEAS deadline date and the application date, and during peak weeks (weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 each semester). Also note, TEAS exams taken after the TEAS deadline date will count toward the next application cycle.\n\nTEAS testing must be completed within the published application deadlines (see table above) in order to be considered for the corresponding application period. Due to processing time for the ATI TEAS to appear in the student’s application, it is recommended that testing times be scheduled 2 to 4 weeks prior to the posted TEAS test deadline date. ATI TEAS scores not available by the deadlines will not be considered.\n\nApplicants who take the ATI TEAS at schools other than Ivy Tech must contact Assessment Technologies Institute (ATI) to have an official copy electronically submitted directly to Ivy Tech.\n\nThe TEAS total score will be used in the selection point system, with no weighting\n\nThe TEAS may be taken up to 3 times in a 1-year period\n\n14 day wait period between TEAS attempts (day of initial testing is day 0)\n\nTEAS score must be within 2 years of application deadline\n\nATI TEAS tests that expire prior to the application deadline will be ineligible for consideration towards program admission, even if the student applies prior to the application deadline.\n\nAllied Health vs. Nursing TEAS Tests\n\nThe ATI Allied Health and ATI Nursing TEAS tests are the same test; they are just scored differently. Taking the Allied Health TEAS will count the same as taking the ATI nursing TEAS test. When ATI Allied Health TEAS test scores are present on the ATI transcript, the applicant will need to contact ATI to request reporting of Nursing TEAS test scores. There may be an associated fee for requests such as these.\n\nTaking the Test & Costs\n\nThe test takes approximately 3 1/2 hours to complete. You will need your valid (non-expired) government-issued photo ID. All TEAS exam appointments must be made and paid for online through our self-serve site. The TEAS exam fee for Ivy Tech students is $77 ($137 for non-students, not available at all Testing Services locations).\n\nHow to Schedule Your TEAS Admission Test\n\nClick here for a printable version of these steps\n\nCreate an ATI account at atitesting.com (if you already have an account at atitesting.com you can skip this step).

You can select up to 3 different programs and 3 different campuses.\n\nYou must meet all of the prerequisites for a program in order to submit your application. If you receive a message indicating that you do not meet the prerequisites, then please remove that program selection in order to proceed with the application.\n\nUpload any necessary documents.\n\nMake sure grades and pre-admission exam scores in the system are accurate.

Use the navigation pane at the side of the page to navigate.\n\nApply Now\n\nOffers of Admission\n\nStudents can select up to 3 program types and 3 campuses each on the application, and rank them in order of preference. Offers of acceptance are for a specific nursing program and a specific campus. The offers are determined through the point selection process.\n\nIf you are accepted, you will receive an email from the online application system to your Ivy Tech email account offering you a seat in the program you selected. Offers are emailed beginning within 1 week of the application close date and continue until program capacity is met or one week before the start of semester classes.\n\nDepending on their points and campus ranking, a student could potentially receive multiple offers.\n\nOnce you accept one offer, you are immediately withdrawn from all other offers and you will be contacted by the chair or dean of the program with information about the program orientation date, time, and location.\n\nIf a student fails to respond, then the offer expires. If a student rejects an offer three (3) times, the application is removed from the auto-selection application pool but will then be available for manual selection rounds that occur later in the process.\n\nWhat If I Don’t Get Admitted?\n\nThe Nursing program does not maintain a waitlist. Non-admitted applicants can reapply in the next semester’s application cycle. You may also want to meet with your advisor. Advisors can assist students in exploring other programs of interest in Ivy Tech’s School of Health Sciences if they have applied several times and have not been accepted into the nursing programs. Ivy Tech offers many programs similar to nursing that lead to high-demand jobs that may be new to you, but fit your passion to help others.\n\nApplication Help Video: Step-by-step instructions for how to submit the online application for Ivy Tech's nursing program. (6:20)\n\nSelective Admissions\n\nAdmission to the nursing programs at Ivy Tech is highly competitive. The program has a selective admissions process, which means not all students who apply to the program will be accepted. Selective admission processes are needed because there are more people interested in taking courses in our nursing programs than there are seats available.\n\nPreference Ranking and Point System Application Selection Process\n\nApplicants are now able to rank their program selections in their application as first choice, second choice, and third choice of program and campus.\n\nApplicants will rank their campus and program choices as first, second, and third choice, with up to nine campus and program options.\n\nAt the close of the application cycle, the system will rank all applications by overall application score, from the highest score to the lowest score, and by each applicant’s first ranked campus and program.\n\nPoints are evaluated from course grades, pre-admission testing, and certifications as applicable to the program.\n\nWeighted Point System\n\nTotal Points Possible: 190 + 5 optional Certification points\n\nGeneral Education Course Points: 90 points possible. Points are awarded based on prerequisite course grades.\n\nATI TEAS points: 100 points possible, utilizing the adjusted individual total score.\n\nCNA Certification points: 5 optional points possible with approved CNA documentation for applicants to ASN and PN programs.
