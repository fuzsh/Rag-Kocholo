        "text": "The 1990s had a lot of great things: the beginning of Friends, unbelievably stylish ensembles, and the birth of iconic “It” couple Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. They were everywhere, and everyone wanted to know every detail about the shocking couple. Cruise was already one of Hollywood’s elites when they tied the knot in 1990, but everyone wanted to know, who was this gorgeous Australian actress who stole his heart?\n\nThey met on the set of the hit film Days of Thunder and tied the knot a year later on Christmas Eve in 1990. Before Kidman became the superstar she is today, she told Marie Claire per Goalcast that she felt like a trophy at the beginning of their marriage. “I thought, I don’t deserve to be here. We would go to the Oscars, and I would think, I’m here to support [Tom]. I felt it was my job to put on a beautiful dress and to be seen and not heard.”\n\nThen came kids, more films, and a lot of red carpet-appearances. They would frequently say how much they loved one another in interviews, with Cruise calling Kidman his “soulmate.”\n\nThey were the faces of ’90s love, and their sudden divorce in 2001 shocked everyone, along with Kidman being the reported reason Cruise skipped the 2023 Oscars over 20 years later.\n\nSo let’s throw it back to the 1990s and take a look at Kidman and Cruise’s life in photos.\n\nA version of this article was originally published on Dec 2021."
