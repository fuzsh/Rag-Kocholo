        "text": "No, he wasn't really \"Born on the Fourth of July.\" Tom Cruise turns 52 today, and he doesn't look like he's aged a bit in 30 years.\n\nThe famous actor was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV in Syracuse, N.Y. on July 3, 1962. He and three sisters were born to Thomas Mapother III, an electrical engineer who died in 1984, and Mary Lee Pfeiffer, a special education teacher.\n\nThe Mapother (rhymes with \"may bother\") family didn't stay in Central New York long, moving around a lot when Cruise was a child. He lived in places like Ottawa and Cincinnati before eventually graduating high school in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.\n\nToday, there's not much people don't know about Cruise. Nominated for three Oscars and People's \"Sexiest Man Alive\" in 1990, he's frequently listed as one of the biggest stars of all time with movies like \"Top Gun,\" \"Minority Report,\" \"Rain Man\" and \"Mission: Impossible.\" He's also impossible to miss in celebrity magazines, thanks to his many high-profile relationships and controversial religious beliefs.\n\nBut how much do you really know? Here are five things you (probably) didn't know about the man who's played everyone from Frank \"T.J.\" Mackey and Cole Trickle to Joel Goodsen and Les Grossman:\n\nThe former Central New Yorker is said to have been baptized Catholic at St. Joseph the Worker Church in Liverpool, and originally planned to become a priest before finding success as an actor. He attended a Franciscan seminary school at age 14 in Cincinnati, but a classmate\n\nsays\n\n\"Tommy\" was asked to leave for stealing booze in 1976. But it's there that Cruise reportedly fell in love with acting at the school's drama club, 15 years before his big screen debut in \"Endless Love.\" Cruise later became a Scientologist after his first wife, Mimi Rodgers, introduced him to the religion that he once\n\nclaimed\n\nhelped cure him of his dyslexia.\n\nThough sprinting on screen has become one of Cruise's trademarks, not every scene is appropriate for it. \"You had me at hello\" was ranked one of AFI's top 100 movie quotes of all time, but\n\nscript notes\n\nfrom Cruise to writer-director Cameron Crowe show he wanted Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) to say \"You're the awesomest runner ever.\" Cruise allegedly wanted to run into the living room, then chase her out of the house while making his famous \"you complete me\" speech. \"Note: Tell Renee she's not allowed to run faster than me,\" T.C. wrote on the script.\n\nThe actor received a\n\ncertificate\n\nof Irish heritage from Ireland's government last year after genealogists traced his family tree back 840 years to Anglo-Normans who invaded Ireland between 1169 and 1176. His ancestry\n\nreportedly\n\nincludes barons, knights, rebels and \"hero landlord\" Patrick Russell Cruise. (Yes, \"Cruise\" is a real family name.) But amazingly, the actor has never played a knight (his name wasn't even Knight in \"Knight and Day\"), though he has played a current or former soldier in 8 different movies: \"Taps,\" \"Top Gun,\" \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"A Few Good Men,\" \"The Last Samurai,\" \"Valkyrie,\" \"Jack Reacher\" and \"Edge of Tomorrow.\"\n\nMimi Rogers was born in 1956, Nicole Kidman was born in 1967 and Katie Holmes was born in 1978. Cruise has been previously romantically linked with everyone from Rebecca De Mornay and Cher to his \"Vanilla Sky\" co-star Penelope Cruz, but is reportedly single now (until he meets the right lady who was born in 1989). He has two adopted children with Kidman -- Isabella and Connor -- and an 8-year-old daughter, Suri, with Holmes.\n\nIt's hard to imagine anyone but Keanu Reeves as \"the one,\" but IMDb reports Nicolas Cage, Leonardo DiCaprio and Cruise were all considered for the lead role of Neo in the Wachowskis' 1999 sci-fi film. A year before that, Cruise was supposed to star in \"Enemy of the State,\" but his scheduling conflicts with \"Eyes Wide Shut\" forced him out and the part eventually went to Will Smith."
