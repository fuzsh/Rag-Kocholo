        "text": "There's no doubt that Tom Cruise is one of the hardest-working actors in Hollywood.\n\nThe 61-year-old star has appeared in over 50 movies since he first rose to fame in the eighties and the actor shows no signs of slowing down. He recently wrapped up filming for both the 7th Mission Impossible instalment and the hotly-anticipated Top Gun sequel.\n\nBut what do you know about Tom's life away from the cameras? From his net worth to his love life, keep reading for everything you need to know about the star...\n\nWhat is Tom Cruise's net worth?\n\nThanks to his decades of work both in front of and behind the camera, Tom has amassed quite the personal fortune. He landed his breakout role in the coming-of-age comedy Risky Business in 1983 and worked non-stop throughout the eighties and nineties before turning his hand to producing.\n\nThese days, he's known for both starring in and producing the blockbuster Mission Impossible franchise.\n\nHis current net worth is estimated to be $600 million, making him one of the richest actors in the world. It is believed that he makes around $50 million a year.\n\nHow tall is Tom Cruise?\n\nTom is 1.7m tall â€“ or 5\" 7 in feet and inches. In 2011, the actor revealed that he is \"very sensitive\" about his height after it was announced he would be bringing the character of Jack Reacher from page to screen.\n\nAt the time, fans pointed out that he was a whole ten inches shorter than the towering hero of Lee Child's thriller series and caused him to speak out about his insecurities.\n\nIs Tom Cruise married?\n\nThe actor has been married and divorced three times. He first tied the knot in 1987 when he was just 24 years old to actress Mimi Rogers.\n\nIt is believed that Mimi, who starred in the likes of The X-Files and Ginger Snaps, introduced Tom to Scientology. In 1990, after three years together, the pair went their separate ways.\n\nThe same year, Tom began a romance with his Days of Thunder co-star Nicole Kidman and after just a few months of dating the two married in a Christmas Eve ceremony. Tom and Nicole were together for over a decade but called it quits in 2001.\n\nThe star found love again four years later with Dawson's Creek star Katie Holmes. As with Tom's other marriages, they enjoyed a relatively short period of dating before he popped the question.\n\nTheir nuptials, which were held in Italy in 2006, were attended by many Hollywood stars and covered exclusively by HELLO! Sadly for Tom, it wasn't meant to be and they split in 2012.\n\nDoes Tom Cruise have children?\n\nTom Cruise is a proud father of three. With his second wife, Nicole, Tom is the adoptive father of Bella, 30, and Connor, 28. Like their father, they are both members of the Church of Scientology.\n\nMORE: Nicole Kidman's son Connor Cruise welcomes new 'family member'\n\nTom also welcomed a daughter Suri, 17, during his six-year marriage to Katie Holmes.\n\nHas Tom Cruise ever won an Oscar?\n\nDespite being in so many iconic and memorable films, Tom has never won himself an Academy Award. During his 40-year screen career, he has earned himself two Best Actor nominations - the first being for Born on the Fourth of July in 1990 and the second for Jerry Maguire in 1997.\n\nHe also received a Supporting Actor nod for his part in Magnolia."
