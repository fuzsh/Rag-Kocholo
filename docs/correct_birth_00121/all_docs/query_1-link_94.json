        "text": "Suri Cruise has been spotted out in New York City after apparently ditching her famous dad’s last name.\n\nThe 18-year-old daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes was dressed casually as she walked down the street, with headphones covering her ears, on Tuesday.\n\nIt comes after Hello! magazine revealed that Suri had taken on a new moniker, which was displayed in the playbill of her school production of Head Over Heels.\n\nThe teen, who played Princess Philoclea in The Go-Go’s jukebox musical, was credited as “Suri Noelle” - using the middle name of her mother.\n\nThe telling move follows the revelation in recent months that Suri is completely estranged from her Top Gun star father, with a source telling the Daily Mail last month that if he called, “she would not answer.”\n\n“He does not exist to Katie or Suri, and his daughter does not want to rely on him for anything,” the insider claimed.\n\nDetails of the pair’s strained relationship first emerged last year, when it was reported that Suri had begun applying for colleges without any input from Cruise.\n\n“Suri is applying to schools all over the place. [Katie] really does want her to stay in New York so they can be close to each other. Katie takes great pride in her but is also extremely overprotective,” a source told the publication.\n\nThey added that Cruise has offered no input as he “has no part” in his child’s life.\n\nCruise, 61, and Holmes, 45, were one of the most high-profile couples of the early 2000s, with their romance generating endless headlines.\n\nDuring a now infamous appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, Cruise jumped on the talk show host’s sofa to declare his feelings for Holmes.\n\n“I’m in love! I’m in love,” he yelled while fist pumping the air. “I can’t be cool. I can’t be laid-back. It’s something that has happened, and I feel I want to celebrate it. I want to celebrate her. She’s a very special woman.”\n\nThe couple welcomed Suri in April 2006, and married in November that year.\n\nHowever, the marriage crumbled just six years later when Holmes filed for divorce, and Cruise has reportedly been estranged from his daughter since 2013."
