        "text": "(born 1962). Few Hollywood stars have been able to make the transition from teen idol to mature leading man as gracefully as U.S. actor Tom Cruise. Though his clean-cut good looks have contributed to him being one of the largest box-office draws of all time, Cruise also has received substantial critical acclaim for his acting skills and the overall quality of his films.\n\nThomas Cruise Mapother IV was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York. His childhood was complicated by dyslexia and his family’s frequent moves, but he used sports as a way to fit in with his peers. When an injury forced him to give up wrestling during his senior year in high school, he tried out for a school musical, and his newfound love of acting soon turned into a full-time pursuit.\n\nCruise landed minor roles in the films Endless Love (1981), Taps (1981), and The Outsiders (1983) as well as a featured part in Losin’ It (1983) before his career took off by portraying a good-looking, boy-next-door type who turns his parents’ house into a temporary brothel in Risky Business (1983). He solidified his new status as teen heartthrob in All the Right Moves (1983), playing a high school football star striving to leave his blue-collar town.\n\nBeginning with his role as a cocky fighter pilot in Top Gun, the highest-grossing film of 1986, Cruise portrayed a series of likable but immature young men, including a pool hustler in The Color of Money (1986) and a suave bartender in Cocktail (1988). Critical opinion of his work soared when he starred with Dustin Hoffman in the Oscar-winning film Rain Man (1988), and he followed with a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award nomination as best actor for his portrayal of real-life antiwar activist Ron Kovic in director Oliver Stone’s Born on the Fourth of July (1989). In the 1990s, Cruise continued to work with some of Hollywood’s most respected actors and directors, notably with Jack Nicholson in Rob Reiner’s A Few Good Men (1992) and with Gene Hackman in Sydney Pollack’s The Firm (1993).\n\nDespite initial objection from author Anne Rice, Cruise was selected to play the seductive vampire Lestat in the screen version of Interview with the Vampire (1994); Rice later praised his work in the film. Cruise took on the dual role of star and coproducer for Mission: Impossible (1996), an action-packed special-effects blockbusters based on the 1960s television show of the same name.\n\nCruise’s success continued with Jerry Maguire (1996), in which he portrayed a sports agent with a conscience. The National Board of Review named him the year’s best actor, and he also earned a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination for his performance in the film. He claimed another Golden Globe and his first Oscar nomination in the supporting actor category for Magnolia (1999).\n\nCruise starred in a number of action films in the 2000s, including Steven Spielberg’s science-fiction thriller Minority Report (2002), the epic drama The Last Samurai (2003), and the crime thriller Collateral (2004). Cruise reteamed with Spielberg on War of the Worlds (2005), an adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel of the same name. In 2008 Cruise earned laughs as an abrasive movie executive in the comedy Tropic Thunder, and he portrayed a German army officer who organized an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler in Valkyrie. Cruise subsequently starred in the action-thriller Knight and Day (2010) and as a 1980s rock idol in the musical Rock of Ages (2012). In some of his later films, including the Mission: Impossible sequels (2000, 2006, 2011), Cruise served as a producer as well as an actor."
