        "text": "Tom Cruise (born July 3, 1962) is an American actor, producer and one of the highest-paid stars in Hollywood. His films, such as the popular \"Mission: Impossible,\" \"Top Gun\" and Jack Reacher\" action franchises, have grossed over $4 billion in North America and over $11.5 billion worldwide. Best known for performing his own death-defying stunts, Cruise has been nominated for four Academy Awards, eight Golden Globes (with two wins), an honorary Palme d'Or from the Cannes Film Festival and more. Cruise began his acting career in the 1980s, and his first major roles came in the 1983 comedy \"Risky Business,\" Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Outsiders\" and the sports drama \"All the Right Moves.\" His big breakout was the 1986 military drama \"Top Gun,\" where he starred as U.S. pilot Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell. In 2022, 36 years after \"Top Gun,\" he revisited the role with \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" It picked up six Academy Award nominations, including best picture, adapted screenplay, original song, film editing, visual effects and won for best sound. In 1990, Cruise earned his first Academy Award nomination for best actor with \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" followed by another in 1997 for \"Jerry Maguire\" and a supporting actor nod in 2000 for \"Magnolia.\" In 1996, Cruise launched his most iconic franchise and debuted as special agent Ethan Hunt in the first \"Mission: Impossible\" film. The series wraps up with a two part finale, \"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning\" in 2023 and 2024. His other major films include \"Rain Man\" (1988), \"A Few Good Men\" (1992), \"Interview With the Vampire\" (1994), \"Minority Report\" (2002) and \"War of the Worlds\" (2005)."
