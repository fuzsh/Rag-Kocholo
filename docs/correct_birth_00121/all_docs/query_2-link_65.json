        "text": "Tom's children:\n\nIsabella Jane born 22nd December 1992, adopted by Tom Cruise and former wife Nicole Kidman\n\nConnor Antony, born 17 January 1995, adopted by Tom Cruise and former wife Nicole Kidman\n\n1987 - 2001\n\nTom was previously married to Nicole Kidman from December 1990 to August 2001. The couple adopted daughter Isabella in 1992 and son Connor in 1995.\n\nHe was also married to Mimi Rogers, from May 1987 until February 1990.\n\n2004 - 2011\n\nAfter Tom Cruise famously declared his love for Dawson's Creek actress Katie Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s chat show sofa, the couple got engaged 2 months after they met in 2005.\n\nTheir whirlwind romance was cemented when Katie announced that her and Tom were going to welcoming an addition to the Cruise family - a baby girl!\n\n\"I feel great being pregnant. It's so beautiful and I've never been so happy. I'm beaming!\" Katie said about her pregnancy at the time. However, Katie's pregnancy news wasn't well received with everyone, with vicious rumours spreading across the world that Katie's pregnancy was actually fake and that she'd been forced to wear a pregnancy suit to fool everyone that she was expecting!\n\nMore like this\n\nThese bizarre rumours stem from Tom's Church of Scientology background - the religion of which he is one the highest-ranking figures.\n\nDuring Katie's pregnancy, it was believed that she was converting to the Scientology faith and that she would have a 'silent birth' - a practice brought in by leading Scientologist L. Ron Hubbard, where the woman stays silent throughout the entire birth, without pain relief.\n\nAlthough the rumours were deemed as untrue, just before Katie's due date, photos of people carrying large placards into Katie and Tom's home with the message, 'Be silent and make all physical movements slow and understandable' surfaced.\n\nIt's never been confirmed whether Katie had a 'silent birth' but it's a rumour that dogged for years to come.\n\nPutting the rumours behind them, Tom and Katie welcomed their first child together, a 7lb 7oz daughter named Suri in April 2006. Suri was born at the St. John's Health Centre in Santa Monica, California.\n\n4 months after Suri's birth, Tom and Katie (dubbed 'TomKat'), married in a lavish, star-studded wedding, which took place in Bracciano, Italy.\n\nMore rumours about the couple emerged after Tom and Katie remained quiet about their daughter and refused to release any pictures of Suri. Speculation that Scientologist parents aren't allowed to talk to their babies 7 days after birth circulated and some even suggested that Suri didn't even exist! Photographers even scooped as low as trying to take pictures of Katie's stomach to prove she had given birth. They eventually got the picture they wanted - a shot of Katie emerged with what looked like tiny stretch marks on her stomach.\n\n5 months after Suri was born, the couple decided to release snaps of their baby to the world with a family portrait on the front cover of Vanity Fair magazine.\n\n\"After much speculation as to why she's been undercover for so long, here is proof positive. Yes - Suri. She does exist!\" the magazine coverlines proclaimed, alongside intimate snaps of Tom, Katie and baby Suri.\n\nIn the interview, Katie admitted that the rumours that Suri was fake, “eats away at her”. The Suri Cruise cover was the magazine's 2nd best-selling issue of all time.\n\nSince being unveiled to the world, TomKat’s daughter Suri Cruise has become something of a celebrity in her own right. Often seen jet setting around the world, Suri had clocked up 65,000 air miles and was already on her 2nd passport by the age of 4.\n\nSuri's also become something of a fashion icon - and not just admirers from fellow parents or children at school. Suri has been voted the worlds most stylish celebrity child on numerous occasions, but also on prestigious fashion polls, like the Worlds Best Dressed Woman, where she came in at number 21. Suri also has a fashion blog dedicated to her and her multi-million pound wardrobe choices\n\nWe can't say we're surprised - Suri has got a designer wardrobe worth a rumoured £2 million and is hardly ever photographed in an outfit twice! Suri's even got a high heel collection to rival any adult celebrity and started wearing them early - at aged 3 to be exact! Tom and Katie might have a mini fashion designer on their hands as she's been picking out her clothes since she turned 18 months. Suri is also already styling mum Katie and dad Tom for the red carpet!\n\nAside from her fashion expertise, Suri also isn't shy on using her charm on her famous parents. Aside from stealing the limelight from her dad whilst on his movie set, she also demanded the perfect nanny - Mary Poppins, no less.\n\nDespite Katie insisting that Suri isn't a spoilt brat, Suri's £19,000 toy car sitting in her garden and her bespoke Christian Louboutin shoes in her shoe closet sure make her one very fortunate little girl.\n\nKatie later found herself in the headlines again with rumours that she was gaining weight to conceive and then followed by speculation that she was pregnant with her 2nd child. However, she denied the rumours were true.\n\n2012 - 2017\n\nIn June 2012, Katie filed for divorce from Tom. It's been reported that the reason for their split was Katie's growing concern for Suri becoming involved in her father's religion, Scientology.\n\nThanks to an iron-clad pre-nuptial agreement, Katie and Tom officially divorced 11 days after the filing. Katie gained primary custody of Suri.\n\nIn August 2012, Tom was spotted holidaying with Suri at Disney's Typhoon Lagoon Water Park in Florida. This is the last time Tom and Suri were seen in public together.\n\nIn 2013, Tom settled a lawsuit with Bauer Publishing in the US over magazine claims that he had 'abandoned' his daughter Suri following his divorce from Katie. The details of the settlement were never disclosed - and he maintained that he had contacted Suri during that period of time.\n\nIn June 2016, InTouch Weekly reported that Tom has not seen Suri in 1000 days (almost 3 years). The magazine claimed he had not seen his daughter since she was 7, and the reason was because mum Katie was labelled a 'suppressive person' - someone who has 'spoken out' against Scientology and as a result is not to be contacted by Scientologists.\n\nIn June 2016, it was also confirmed that Katie Holmes is dating actor Jamie Foxx by Jamie's friend, Real Housewives of Atlanta star Claudia Jordan. It's been reported that the couple 'kept their relationship under wraps' for 3 years. Neither Katie nor Jamie have officially divulged their relationship status to the press.\n\nIn August 2016, US Weekly reported claims that echoed InTouch Weekly's - that Tom has not seen Suri for nearly 3 years.\n\nIn December 2016, Katie confirmed that she had NOT secretly married rumoured beau Jamie Foxx, despite persistent rumours.\n\nAs of January 2017, Katie Holmes maintains primary custody of now 10-year-old Suri. The mum-daughter duo live in New York.\n\nImages: Instagram/Katie Holmes, Twitter/Tom Cruise\n\nRead more:"
