        "text": "Tom Cruise made a strong impression in the teen comedy Risky Business (1983) and then had his first box-office smash as the fighter jock Maverick in Top Gun (1986). Cruise and his cocky grin were propelled higher onto Hollywood's A-list thanks to a string of successful movies: Rain Man (1988, with Dustin Hoffman), The Color of Money (1986, with Paul Newman), A Few Good Men (1992, with Jack Nicholson) and Jerry Maguire (1996, with Cuba Gooding, Jr. saying \"Show me the money!\"). Cruise has remained one of Hollywood's busiest actors, taking on blockbuster franchises such as Mission: Impossible (Cruise played superspy Ethan Hunt in the original and two sequels in 1996, 2000 and 2006) as well as more diverse dramas such as Magnolia (1999), Vanilla Sky (2001) and the Steven Spielberg movies Minority Report (2002, co-starring Samantha Morton) and War of the Worlds (2005). His most recent movie Knight and Day will be released on June 23rd, 2010.\n\nCruise was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV on July 3, 1962 in Syracuse, New York to Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. Cruise's surname originates from his great-grandfather, Thomas Cruise O'Mara, who was adopted by a Welsh immigrant and renamed \"Thomas Cruise Mapother\". Cruise is of German, Irish, and English ancestry. His oldest sister, Lee Anne, was born in his parents' native Louisville, Kentucky, while his older sister Marian was born in Syracuse, as were Tom and his younger sister, Cass.\n\nHe has been married three times. His first marriage was to actress Mimi Rogers, a fellow Scientologist, from 1986-1990. While filming one of Days of Thunder (1990), he met his second wife Nicole Kidman. He and Kidman were married in 1990. They adopted two children: Isabella (in 1993) and Connor (in 1995). In 2000, Cruise and Kidman separated. Their divorce was finalized in 2001. He began dating actress Katie Holmes in 2005 and proposed to Holmes at the Eiffel Tower after a highly-publicized whirlwind romance. He came in for a ribbing from pundits after he hopped up and down on the talk-show couch of Oprah Winfrey while proclaiming his love for Holmes. Dubbed \"TomKat\" by the tabloids, they had a daughter, Suri, on 18 April 2006, and were married in Italy on 18 November 2006.\n\nCruise is a prominent member of the Church of Scientology.\n\nTom Cruise discovers his Irish roots on a visit to Dublin by Irish Abroad on 05 April 2013 18:04PM\n\nThis week Tom Cruise discovered the truth of his Irish family history and that his Irish ancestors have been identified as knights, rebels and heroes in a family history that stretches back an incredible 800 years. The Hollywood actor and producer visited Dublin on the European leg of his tour to promote his new film 'Oblivion'.\n\nResearch commissioned by Tourism Ireland for Cruise’s visit, and completed by genealogy researchers Eneclann, has unveiled the amazing history of a family that contained knights in the 12th century, rebels in the 17th century and a hero – Patrick Russell-Cruise – who reinstated tenants on his lands in the 19th century, following their eviction against his wishes by an unscrupulous land agent. Tom Cruise is a fifth generation direct descendant of Patrick Russell-Cruise.\n\nPrior to the red carpet première of 'Oblivion' in Dublin, Cruise was presented with a Certificate of Irish Heritage by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore. The Certificate is an official recognition by the Irish Government of those who are proud of their Irish ancestry and heritage.\n\nWhen presented with his Certificate of Irish Heritage, Cruise said: “It’s a great honour for me and for my whole family – I can’t wait to bring it back to them and enlighten them on their history.” Cruise continued: “I’m very proud to be Irish. There’s a pride in America of being Irish. I can’t wait to come back and I want to visit the land of my ancestors and the castle that they had.”\n\nAs this is the year of The Gathering Ireland 2013, with a programme of over 300 clan gatherings and local history talks taking place throughout the year, Tourism Ireland has christened 2013 Ireland’s “Family History Year”. Tourism Ireland is encouraging those with Irish connections throughout the world to follow in Cruise’s footsteps and to visit in 2013 to learn more about their heritage and explore the places their ancestors came from.\n\n· The Certificate of Irish Heritage provides official recognition of Irish descent.

Full details of the amazing family history of Tom Cruise can be found online at www.eneclann.ie/exhibitions/tomcruise. A summary is provided below.\n\nTom Cruise's Irish Roots Research Overview\n\nTom Cruise's Irish roots can be traced back 840 years to the arrival of Strongbow in Ireland. Tom was christened Thomas Cruise Mapother IV and the story of his Irish ancestors - the Cruises, the Russells and the Mapothers – is one of knights, rebels and heroes.\n\nThe knights in Tom's family were among the first wave of Anglo-Normans to invade Ireland between 1169 and 1176. In 1176, Augustino de Cruce, one of Strongbow's knights, acted as a legal witness to a grant by Strongbow (Richard de Clare, Earl of Pembroke) of lands in Dublin. The Cruise family established themselves in Ireland and held lands in Dublin and Meath, including Naul in north Co Dublin (which included the townland of ‘Hollywood’) and the civil parish of Cruicetown in Co Meath, to which the family gave their name. Like other \"old English\" families, they continued in the Catholic faith even after the Reformation. In 1641, the Cruise family of the Naul took up arms in defence of the King but they lost out to the English Parliamentary army under Oliver Cromwell and forfeited their lands in north Co Dublin. In 1686, after the Restoration, they were restored to the lands of Cruicetown in Co Meath but their status and their land base was much reduced.\n\nThe rebellious streak in Tom's family was also evident amongst the Russell family who were also “old English” settlers, visible in the records from the 1200s. Their main seat was Seatown, situated in present day Malahide in north Co Dublin. In the 15th, 16th and early 17th centuries the Russell family lived in Seatown Castle, fragments of which survive today as part of a modern dwelling. It is highly probable that the Russells engaged in cross-channel trade as the family had amassed significant wealth by the early 1600s and in 1627 they completed a substantial new residence, Drynam House. Like the Cruises, the Russells held fast to their Catholicism and took up arms in the 1641 Rebellion. They consequently lost their lands at Seatown but retained Drynam House and 421 acres surrounding it and it passed by descent in the family until it was sold in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1766, the marriage of Bridget Russell “only child and heir at law of Robert Russell of Drynam” to Andrew Cruise united these two families and the children of all subsequent generations adopted the double-surname ‘Russell-Cruise’.\n\nTom's family history also contains wonderful stories of heroism. Patrick Russell Cruise was born ca. 1799 in Drynam and in 1825 he married Teresa Johnson in Co Meath. The young couple determined that their future was in the USA and they settled in Haverstraw, New York. As a younger son, Patrick Russell Cruise had not inherited the family ancestral seat of Drynam House; however, he had inherited a half share in approximately 500 acres of land in Co Westmeath, comprising the townlands of Paristown and Dardistown. The tenants' leases on these lands were due to expire in 1843. Patrick had promised the sitting tenants that he would ensure they had a preference in renewal “because he felt he was bound in honour and conscience to look to the tenants in possession” but his Dublin-based land agent John Smith evicted the tenants regardless. When news of the evictions reached Patrick Russell-Cruise in America he set sail for Ireland and personally restored his former tenants to the lands. As a vote of thanks, a public dinner was given in his honour in the town of Clonmellon in November 1844. Patrick Russell Cruise died in Dublin in March 1849 without returning to America and he was buried in Donabate in north Dublin.\n\nHow Tom came to be known as Tom Cruise Maphother is a story of family tragedy. Tom's great-great-grandmother, Mary Pauline Russell-Cruise, was the youngest known child of Patrick Russell-Cruise, born ca. 1832 in New Jersey. Mary Pauline married Dillon Henry Mapother, the second son of Henry Mapother Esq. of Annadale Lodge, Co Dublin, in September 1858 in the RC Cathedral in Detroit. The Mapother family originated in Dorset in England but were in Ireland by 1588 when Richard Mapother was the Sheriff of Roscommon. By the early 1600s, the Mapothers established their main residence in Kilteevan in Co Roscommon, where descendants remained down to the early 20th century. Dillon Henry Mapother held a degree in civil engineering and had immigrated to New York in 1850 before settling in Louisville, Kentucky, where he established a successful printing business. However, Dillon Henry died between 1873 and 1875 and Mary Pauline remarried, to Thomas O’Mara in 1876. There was only one known child of this second marriage: Thomas O’Mara Jr. born on 29 December, 1876. Sadly, Thomas O’Mara Sr. also died sometime before 1900 and Thomas O’Mara Jr. assumed the combined maiden name of his mother and the surname of his half-brother, becoming Thomas Cruise Mapother. This man was the great-grandfather of the actor Tom Cruise who was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV.\n\nTom Cruise made a strong impression in the teen comedy Risky Business (1983) and then had his first box-office smash as the fighter jock Maverick in Top Gun (1986). Cruise and his cocky grin were propelled higher onto Hollywood's A-list thanks to a string of successful movies: Rain Man (1988, with Dustin Hoffman), The Color of Money (1986, with Paul Newman), A Few Good Men (1992, with Jack Nicholson) and Jerry Maguire (1996, with Cuba Gooding, Jr. saying \"Show me the money!\").

Like other \"old English\" families, they continued in the Catholic faith even after the Reformation. In 1641, the Cruise family of the Naul took up arms in defence of the King but they lost out to the English Parliamentary army under Oliver Cromwell and forfeited their lands in north Co Dublin. In 1686, after the Restoration, they were restored to the lands of Cruicetown in Co Meath but their status and their land base was much reduced.\n\nThe rebellious streak in Tom's family was also evident amongst the Russell family who were also “old English” settlers, visible in the records from the 1200s. Their main seat was Seatown, situated in present day Malahide in north Co Dublin. In the 15th, 16th and early 17th centuries the Russell family lived in Seatown Castle, fragments of which survive today as part of a modern dwelling. It is highly probable that the Russells engaged in cross-channel trade as the family had amassed significant wealth by the early 1600s and in 1627 they completed a substantial new residence, Drynam House. Like the Cruises, the Russells held fast to their Catholicism and took up arms in the 1641 Rebellion. They consequently lost their lands at Seatown but retained Drynam House and 421 acres surrounding it and it passed by descent in the family until it was sold in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1766, the marriage of Bridget Russell “only child and heir at law of Robert Russell of Drynam” to Andrew Cruise united these two families and the children of all subsequent generations adopted the double-surname ‘Russell-Cruise’.\n\nTom's family history also contains wonderful stories of heroism. Patrick Russell Cruise was born ca. 1799 in Drynam and in 1825 he married Teresa Johnson in Co Meath. The young couple determined that their future was in the USA and they settled in Haverstraw, New York. As a younger son, Patrick Russell Cruise had not inherited the family ancestral seat of Drynam House; however, he had inherited a half share in approximately 500 acres of land in Co Westmeath, comprising the townlands of Paristown and Dardistown. The tenants' leases on these lands were due to expire in 1843. Patrick had promised the sitting tenants that he would ensure they had a preference in renewal “because he felt he was bound in honour and conscience to look to the tenants in possession” but his Dublin-based land agent John Smith evicted the tenants regardless. When news of the evictions reached Patrick Russell-Cruise in America he set sail for Ireland and personally restored his former tenants to the lands. As a vote of thanks, a public dinner was given in his honour in the town of Clonmellon in November 1844. Patrick Russell Cruise died in Dublin in March 1849 without returning to America and he was buried in Donabate in north Dublin.\n\nHow Tom came to be known as Tom Cruise Maphother is a story of family tragedy. Tom's great-great-grandmother, Mary Pauline Russell-Cruise, was the youngest known child of Patrick Russell-Cruise, born ca. 1832 in New Jersey. Mary Pauline married Dillon Henry Mapother, the second son of Henry Mapother Esq. of Annadale Lodge, Co Dublin, in September 1858 in the RC Cathedral in Detroit. The Mapother family originated in Dorset in England but were in Ireland by 1588 when Richard Mapother was the Sheriff of Roscommon. By the early 1600s, the Mapothers established their main residence in Kilteevan in Co Roscommon, where descendants remained down to the early 20th century. Dillon Henry Mapother held a degree in civil engineering and had immigrated to New York in 1850 before settling in Louisville, Kentucky, where he established a successful printing business. However, Dillon Henry died between 1873 and 1875 and Mary Pauline remarried, to Thomas O’Mara in 1876. There was only one known child of this second marriage: Thomas O’Mara Jr. born on 29 December, 1876. Sadly, Thomas O’Mara Sr. also died sometime before 1900 and Thomas O’Mara Jr. assumed the combined maiden name of his mother and the surname of his half-brother, becoming Thomas Cruise Mapother. This man was the great-grandfather of the actor Tom Cruise who was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV."
