        "text": "Tom Cruise, Mary Lee South\n\nTom Cruise arrives with his mother, Mary South, for the 61st Annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, Calif. Sunday, Jan. 25, 2004.\n\n(Mark J. Terrill | AP)\n\nSyracuse native Tom Cruise's mother Mary Lee South is dead, according to multiple reports. She was 80.\n\nA rep for Cruise told ET that South died peacefully in her sleep last week after battling recent health issues. The 54-year-old actor attended a memorial service at her local Church of Scientology over the weekend with his sisters, Lee Ann DeVette, 57, Cass Mapother, 55, and Marian Henry, 52, and other family members and friends.\n\nSouth reportedly moved from Los Angeles last year to Clearwater, Florida, closer to the Church of Scientology headquarters. Cruise is the world's most famous Scientologist and his mother is also a member of the religion.\n\nAccording to People, South was born Mary Lee Pfeiffer in Louisville, Kentucky. She was a special education teacher who helped foster Cruise's love of acting.\n\n\"I was always interested in theater, but I never did anything with it,\" she told Rolling Stone in 1986. \"When I was growing up, if you went to Hollywood, that was really risque.\"\n\nCruise was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV in Syracuse, New York, in 1962 to South and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. The family grew up near poverty and moved around several times; Cruise spent some of his formative years in Canada.\n\nSouth divorced Mapother in 1974 amid allegations of abuse; Cruise, who was 11 at the time, later told Parade his father was a \"bully\" who beat him. Cruise didn't see Mapother again until about a decade later, shortly before he died of cancer.\n\nSouth remarried in 1978 to Jack South in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.\n\n\"People can create their own lives,\" Cruise told Parade in 2006. \"I saw how my mother created hers and so made it possible for us to survive. My mother was the one who rose to the occasion. She held three jobs. She said, 'We're going to get through this.'\n\n\"And I decided that I'm going to create, for myself, who I am, not what other people say I should be. I'm entitled to that.\"\n\nCruise initially pursued sports, but a knee injury sidelined him from soccer and wrestling. According to People, his mother encouraged him to try out for a production of \"Guys and Dolls\" at Glen Ridge High School, and the rest is history.\n\nA year after graduation, Cruise landed roles in \"Endless Love\" and \"Taps.\" By 1986, he became a blockbuster star behind films like \"Top Gun\" and \"Risky Business,\" and remains one of the world's most recognized actors.\n\nCruise remained close with his mother through the years. He brought South to the Oscars and the Golden Globes, as well as movie premieres for \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Magnolia.\"\n\nHis upcoming films include \"Mission: Impossible 6\" and \"The Mummy\" reboot."
