        "text": "Tom Cruise is an award-winning American actor and filmmaker best known for movies in the ‘Mission: Impossible’ film series in which he plays secret agent Ethan Hunt. He is considered to be one of the biggest movie stars in the United States and was Hollywood's highest-paid actor in 2012. Born in New York to an abusive father and brought up in near-poverty, there was nothing in his early life to suggest that one day he would become one of the most famous actors in the world. Even as a teenager Cruise dreamed of becoming a priest, not an actor. However, destiny had other plans in store for him and he found himself playing a small role in a film ‘Endless Love’ as a 19 year old. He realized that acting came naturally to him and decided to seriously pursue acting as a career. Over the next few years he appeared in a lot of supporting roles before bagging his first major role in the romantic comedy ‘Risky Business’. Strikingly handsome and blessed with boyish charms, it did not take him long to take Hollywood by storm and soon he established himself as a much sought after A-list star. His popularity reached new heights when he bagged the role of secret agent Ethan Hunt in the ‘Mission: Impossible’ film series."
