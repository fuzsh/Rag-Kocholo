        "text": "Actors often work regular jobs before their big break, including A-listers like Tom Cruise.\n\nBefore he landed his role in \"Taps\" in 1981, Fox News Digital confirmed that Cruise lived in and was the superintendent for a building on the Upper West Side of New York City which is now on the market for $14,995,000.\n\nLocated at 50 West 86th St., the building has five stories and hosts eight units, plus commercial space and a pool. It’s also just steps away from Central Park and the Museum of Natural History, with the MET across the park.\n\nAccording to the building’s listing, it maintains many original features from its construction in 1907, such as a limestone entrance with ornate carvings, including detailed lion figures, and the original balustrades.\n\n'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE': WHAT HAS THE TOM CRUISE-LED FRANCHISE BROUGHT IN AT THE BOX OFFICE?\n\nThe eight units all feature high ceilings, fireplaces and either a balcony or terrace outdoor space.\n\nRex Gonsalves of Brown Harris Stevens holds the listing for the Renaissance Revival building, known as the \"Good Luck Manhattan Mansion,\" due to its celebrity-studded past.\n\nA New York real estate blog called Active Rain shared some insider details about Cruise's time there.\n\nMitchell J Hall claims on the blog that he lived in the building at the same time as Cruise, who rented a studio above his for $300 a month and took out the trash and vacuumed the halls to help pay his rent before landing his role in \"Taps.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nRepresentatives for the realtor also confirmed some other famous names who passed through the building’s doors.\n\nIn the 1980s, Robert Downey, Jr. lived in the then newly-built penthouse with his girlfriend at the time, Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nEarlier, in the 1960s and '70s, the home was owned by King Curtis, Aretha Franklin’s musical director and bandleader.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nCurtis also worked with Andy Williams, Bobby Darin and Nat King Cole, and it has been noted, according to the real estate agent’s representatives, that Curtis worked with John Lennon on his \"Imagine\" album in the first floor pool area of the townhouse, which Curtis used as a soundstage for the acoustics.\n\nThe band director was sadly stabbed in front of the building in 1971 and later died at Roosevelt Hospital. His funeral was attended by such musicians as Franklin and Stevie Wonder, and Rev. Jesse Jackson administered services."
