        "text": "Tom Cruise, an incredible actor and producer, rose to fame as one of Hollywood’s best-known male actors after his debut in the 1980s. Winning audience’s hearts with great movies like Top Gun, Mission: Impossible, and Jack reacher; Today, he is one of the world’s highest-paid actors with a total net worth of more than $500 million. Leading a wealthy lifestyle, Tom Cruise is known to have a keen interest in bikes, cars, and real estate. He has brought various mansions and apartments to date without shying away from a luxurious lifestyle and investments. Tom Cruise house that piqued the audience’s interest are the renowned Beverly Hills Mansion, the magnificent west Sussex estate, the extravagant Hollywood hills villa, the stunning Colorado Ranch, the opulent Florida Penthouse, and the New York City apartment. Each of his homes has distinct architectural details and components that enhance the beauty and functionality of the house. Let’s draw a parallel between his previous and present homes and discuss their distinguishing characteristics– all from an architect’s perspective.\n\nHeart in Hollywood Hills | Tom Cruise House\n\nThe country estates in Tuscany, Italy, inspired the Hollywood Hills House’s striking Old World charm. With seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, and light-filled living areas with vaulted ceilings, European-style decor, and wide-plank hardwood flooring, the entire house was remodelled in 2006, most likely by Cruise. In addition, there are multiple outdoor dining terraces, a stunning chef’s kitchen, and a three-acre garden with a lagoon-style pool. This stunning home is ideal for Hollywood royalty since it offers breathtaking 180-degree views of Los Angeles from its private gardens.\n\nCosy in Colorado\n\nThe stunning 320-acre Colorado ranch provided him with privacy, serenity, and breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. The 930 sq. m house includes vaulted ceilings, floor-to-ceiling fireplaces, and spectacular views of the mountains. The stunning residence has four bedrooms and was constructed from native stone and bleached cedar timbers. The spacious lower level houses a formal dining room, den, and game area with wood pillars and exposed beam ceilings. The apartment, packed with high-end home amenities, has a fitness centre, a cutting-edge security system, a snowmelt system, a wet bar, and underfloor heating. This house was indeed an escape away from reality for Cruise.\n\nArchitects of Grandeur | Tom Cruise House\n\nAn average family of 2-4 people requires 140-240 sq. m of space to lead a comfortable life. Tom Cruise’s houses have a main structure that is 930 sq. m on average, which is over 4-5 times the size of the typical home. While the size of a typical garden is approximately half an acre, Tom Cruise’s Colorado Ranch was a whopping 230 acres!\n\nWhat makes the area of his houses so grand? The size of the house ultimately increases as more spacious areas like bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and various spaces for entertainment and comfort are added. Anthropometrically speaking, designing large spaces is in itself a challenge, too– making sure the distance between two points is convenient yet grand, practical yet impressive, and in the end, user-friendly. For example– the working triangle of the kitchen is not disrupted due to larger spaces, and the distance between a bedroom, bathroom, and a walk-in closet is reasonable.\n\nReal Estate as an Investment\n\nTom Cruise purchased several houses in order to live comfortably, but he also sold them for a profit when he no longer required the property, demonstrating his investment in real estate as a source of revenue. He paid $30.5 million for his Beverly Hills property, which he then sold for $38 million nearly a decade later. Furthermore, he purchased his west Sussex mansion for $4.2 million and sold it for $6.2 million. Additionally, he sold off his Colorado ranch and Hollywood Hills villa for sums of $39.5 million and $11.4 million, respectively. This shows that the real estate market has the potential for high returns on investments in the long run.\n\nLush, Lavish, and Luxurious | Tom Cruise House\n\nBuilt with a gorgeous classical European facade– the Beverly Hills mansion is spread over a land of 1.3 acres offering a living space of 930 sq.m –consisting of seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms. It also has a spacious backyard, pool, tennis and basketball courts, multiple guest houses, and a large playground for children. There is a lovely connection to nature evident across the exteriors. A beautiful facade is displayed by the simplicity and blend of green, white, and grey colours. This house undoubtedly offered the privacy Tom needed due to its lush surroundings and high walls.\n\nPrivacy is Power\n\nWhen you look at Tom Cruise’s houses, you’ll see that they all share the trait of being incredibly secluded and having few neighbours. After having their entire life talked about, celebrities prefer their isolation and the freedom from dealing with their neighbours. For instance, the Colorado Ranch is tucked away among mountains in a rural area, and Beverly Hills Mansion is situated in a quiet area far from the limelight, giving the actor a relaxing environment to enjoy with his family and/or on his own.\n\nAnother question is whether this has an impact on the site’s accessibility. It sure does. In reality, anyone who can afford a million-dollar home is likely to afford a driver and a vehicle for their convenience– accessibility being the least of their concerns.\n\n(Accessed: January 11, 2023).\n\nSpatial Arrangement\n\nA lovely arrangement of spaces can be seen in Tom Cruise’s houses. All of his homes feature spacious gardens and backyards, tennis and basketball courts, a fitness centre, a home theatre, a game room, a hot tub, numerous bedrooms and baths, a chef’s kitchen, guest rooms, and numerous terraces, which not only make a beautiful place to live in but also offer a wonderful connect to nature.\n\nTraditional Meets Modern: A beautiful blend | Tom Cruise House\n\nThe 14-acre mega-mansion known as Rede Place (the West Sussex estate) boasts beautiful interiors of 1050 square meters. It displays a blend of traditional and modern design, displaying dramatic patterns, gabled roofs, and large windows. The home perfectly combines the best features of both worlds, from coffered ceilings to natural timber accents, from zoned dramatic lighting to integrated sound systems. The vast area is split between the main home and a guest pavilion, with 8 bedrooms and five bathrooms. A large dance studio, a movie theatre, and other amenities can be found in the basement, while the master suite and a separate sitting area are on the top floor. There is a tennis court, a hot tub, and a pool in the exteriors.\n\nLife in the Big Apple\n\nSome of Cruise’s earlier properties were purchased in New York City, his birthplace. Tom resided in a 200 sq.m unit in an apartment building, which is quite the opposite of his now enormous and secluded home. This must be Tom Cruise’s simplest house, with only two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a gym.\n\nFabulous Florida | Tom Cruise House\n\nHis most recent and current residence is that of a multimillion-dollar penthouse in Florida. This 10-story structure, also known as the “Sky View” building, offers approximately 36 residences, with Tom Cruise residing on the top 2 floors– offering stunning views at all times. The residence features four bedrooms, a gym, a game room, a home cinema, a roof deck with an infinity pool, a hot tub, gardens, and a bar. This building, which is not far from the Church of Scientology headquarters, was created by fellow Scientologist Moises Agami. Cruise has also been a proud member of this Church.\n\nOver the years, Tom Cruise has had a number of gorgeous properties, some with stunning architectural characteristics that range from classical to modern. Tom Cruise’s houses have it all, with gorgeous interiors and exteriors and a brilliant connection to nature. In the end, what everyone wants to do is go home to a comfortable and relaxing place because, after all there’s no place like home.\n\nOver the years, Tom Cruise has had a number of gorgeous properties, some with stunning architectural characteristics that range from classical to modern.
