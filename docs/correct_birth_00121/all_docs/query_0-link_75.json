        "text": "Top 100 celebrities with CNY connections (1-20)\n\nView the Slideshow >>\n\n(Gallery by syracuse.com | The Post-Standard)\n\n\"Do you think your name will be on that plaque?\" Viper asks Maverick in the 1986 movie \"Top Gun.\"\n\nTom Cruise replies to Tom Skerritt: \"Yes sir, I do.\"\n\n\"That's pretty arrogant, considering the company you're in,\" Skerritt replies as Viper. \"I like that in a pilot.\"\n\nIndeed, if there's a plaque that the man born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV in Syracuse, New York, deserves to be on, it's a star on the sidewalk in front of the Landmark Theatre. Cruise has been nominated for three Oscars (\"Jerry Maguire,\" \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"Magnolia\") and was Hollywood's highest-paid actor in 2012, not to mention countless other honors, but has yet to be memorialized in his city of birth.\n\nIn fact, Tom Cruise was the first name Syracuse Walk of Stars founder Frank Malfitano said he'd like to see added to the list of honorees if the event is ever brought back.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1996, the red carpet ceremony brought celebrities with ties to Onondaga County back to the Salt City to be honored with a \"star\" much like Hollywood's Walk of Fame. The \"company\" that Cruise could be in includes previously honored stars Bobcat Goldthwait, Jerry Stiller, Grace Jones and Rod Serling.\n\nCruise's fame is not without controversy, though, as his couch-jumping antics with now ex-wife Katie Holmes and frequent tabloid reports about Scientology have affected some fans' opinions of him. But there's no denying his star power as he produces hit movie after hit movie -- he currently stars in \"Oblivion\" and next has \"All You Need is Kill,\" a \"Van Helsing\" remake, a \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" reboot and a rumored \"Mission: Impossible 5\" movie on the way.\n\nWe're counting down a list of the top 100 celebrities with Syracuse-area connections that deserve recognition for their achievements in the entertainment industry, and Cruise has been named No. 1.\n\nStaff at syracuse.com and The Post-Standard helped compile the list with the following criteria: Stars must have lived, worked or went to school within 50 miles of Syracuse; must have achieved national fame or success in TV, film, music, writing, comedy or other arts; no athletes or sports figures are included unless they also have entertainment credits.\n\nFinally, we ranked them by the strength of their connection to the area (i.e. born in Syracuse is stronger than attending SUNY Cortland for two years) and the level of their star power or influence in their field.\n\nThe bottom 20 (Nos. 81 through 100) appeared on syracuse.com Thursday, featuring Grammy-winning singer Joanne Shenandoah. The following 20 (Nos. 61-80) appeared Friday and included the Broadway-pioneering Shubert brothers. The middle 20 (Nos. 41-60) included Aaron Sorkin when it went up Saturday, and the next 20 (Nos. 21-40) appeared Sunday with names like Vanessa Williams and Ted Koppel.\n\nThe top 20 (Nos. 1-20) appear online today, and the entire list of 100 will also appear in The Post-Standard print edition on Sunday, May 12.\n\nLeave your comments with who should and shouldn't be on the list, as well as whether certain celebrities should appear higher or lower. Enjoy!\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n20. Ronnie James Dio\n\nLate rocker Ronnie James Dio grew up in Cortland and graduated from Cortland City School in 1960. The heavy metal singer performed with bands Heaven & Hell, Dio, Elf and Rainbow, plus replaced Ozzy Osbourne in Black Sabbath in 1979 and sang on the hits \"Die Young,\" \"Neon Knights\" and \"Turn Up the Night.\"\n\n19. L. Frank Baum\n\nChittenango's most famous son L. Frank Baum wrote \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\" which has inspired countless adaptations including Victor Fleming's 1939 classic \"The Wizard of Oz\" and the most recent \"Oz: The Great and Powerful.\" Baum's life is still celebrated annually with the Oz-Stravaganza! festival, which takes place this year from May 31 to June 2.\n\n18. Jimmy Van Heusen\n\nSongwriter Jimmy Van Heusen has a spot on the Syracuse Walk of Stars and earlier this year received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Syracuse Area Music Awards, but he's also earned national accolades, too. The four-time Oscar winner penned some of Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby's biggest hits (\"Come Fly with Me,\" \"Love and Marriage\" to name a few) and also has one Emmy award, three Tony nominations and one Grammy nod.\n\n17. Jon Fishman\n\nJamesville-DeWitt graduate Jon Fishman is not only the drummer for Phish, but the band Trey Anastasio-fronted band is named after him. Over 30 years, the jam rock band has released more than a dozen albums and built a devoted following through their live shows.\n\n16. Rod Serling\n\n\"You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind....\" Born Rodman Edward Serling in Syracuse, Rod Serling is best known as the Emmy-winning creator and host of \"The Twilight Zone.\" He was posthumously inducted into the Television Hall of Fame and the Science Fiction Hall of Fame and his daughter Anne recently published a memoir titled \"As I Knew Him: My Dad, Rod Serling.\"\n\n15. Thom Filicia\n\nSyracuse native Thom Filicia rose to fame on the reality series \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,\" but still makes frequent TV appearances as a well-respected interior designer. Last year, he published \"American Beauty: Renovating and Decorating a Beloved Retreat,\" a memoir with tips on decorating about a fixer-upper he purchased in Skaneateles.\n\n14. moe.\n\nAll the members of moe. have ties to Central New York, including lead singer Al Schnier who still lives in the Utica area. The seminal jam rock band puts on its own annual upstate New York event known as moe.down (this year's event is Aug. 9-11 in Turin, N.Y.) and has performed at festivals like Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Woodstock '99.\n\n13. Tom Kenny\n\nEast Syracuse native Tom Kenny went to Bishop Grimes High School with filmmaker-comedian Bobcat Goldthwait but made a name for himself as the voice of the title character on the long-running cartoon series \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\" Kenny also dabbled in music with the bands The Tearjerkers and The Trend, appeared in the Smashing Pumpkins music video for \"Tonight, Tonight\" and has also voiced characters for \"Scooby Doo! Mystery Incorporated,\" \"The Powerpuff Girls,\" \"Futurama\" and Michael Bay's \"Transformers\" movies.\n\n12. David Muir\n\nOnondaga Central High School and Ithaca College graduate David Muir got his start in broadcasting on WTVH-5 in Syracuse before becoming TV's most-used network correspondent. He currently hosts the weekend edition of ABC's \"World News\" and became co-anchor of the long-running series \"20/20\" earlier this year.\n\n11. Kevin James\n\nComedian Kevin James attended SUNY Cortland before he became the well-known star of \"King of Queens\" and movies like \"Hitch,\" \"Grown-Ups\" and \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop.\"\n\n10. Jim Boeheim\n\nBelieve it or not, Syracuse basketball coach Jim Boeheim has an IMDb page. The hall-of-famer appeared in Spike Lee's \"He Got Game\" and had a speaking role opposite Nick Nolte in Shaq's 1994 movie debut \"Blue Chips.\"\n\n9. John Walsh\n\nAuburn, N.Y. native John Walsh was the creator and host of long-running TV series \"America's Most Wanted.\" The real-life criminal investigator and anti-crime advocate is also part owner of the Museum of Crime & Punishment in Washington, D.C.\n\n8. Jerry Seinfeld\n\nComedian Jerry Seinfeld went to SUNY Oswego for two years before transferring to Queens College and starting his career in New York City. Today he's still best known for the iconic television series \"Seinfeld,\" but his recent works include the animated \"Bee Movie,\" \"The Marriage Ref,\" web series \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" and is collaborating with rapper Wale on the upcoming \"The Album About Nothing.\"\n\n7. Jim Brown\n\nNFL legend Jim Brown could be famous for his athletic accomplishments alone, including lettering in football, lacrosse, track & field and basketball at Syracuse University in the 1950s. However, the man born James Nathaniel Brown also has a prolific acting career, starring in movies like \"The Dirty Dozen,\" \"The Running Man,\" \"Any Given Sunday,\" and Tim Burton's \"Mars Attacks.\"\n\n6. Alec Baldwin (and the Baldwin brothers)\n\nCarol M. Baldwin lives in Camillus and runs her own breast cancer foundation, which brings her famous sons to Central New York at least once a year. Oscar and Tony-nominated actor Alec Baldwin won two Emmys for his role on NBC's \"30 Rock,\" while his brothers William, Stephen and Daniel have all had varying success in TV and film.\n\n5. Dick Clark\n\nSyracuse University alumnus Dick Clark got his start in television and radio at stations in Utica and Syracuse, eventually going on to iconic shows like \"American Bandstand,\" \"Rockin' New Year's Eve\" while his company produced the Golden Globes, the American Music Awards and series like \"So You Think You Can Dance.\" Clark continues to give back even after his death -- his estate donated $1 million towards scholarships to members of his fraternity at SU, Delta Kappa Epsilon, earlier this year.\n\n4. Richard Gere\n\nNorth Syracuse Central High School graduate Richard Gere played the trumpet and did gymnastics when he was living in CNY, but today is known as the star of movies like \"Pretty Woman,\" \"Chicago\" and \"An Officer and a Gentleman.\" The Golden Globe winner and human rights activist was also named People's \"Sexiest Man Alive\" in 1999.\n\n3. Carmelo Anthony\n\nNew York Knicks superstar Carmelo Anthony played basketball at Syracuse University for just one year, but he helped Jim Boeheim win his only NCAA Championship, built the Melo Center and gives back to the city through the Courts 4 Kids program. The Olympic gold medal winner is also married to TV personality La La Vazquez and has appeared on numerous shows himself, including \"Punk'd,\" \"Law & Order: SVU\" and \"Nurse Jackie.\"\n\n2. Al Roker\n\n\"Today\" show weatherman Al Roker got his first big break at WHEN-TV in Syracuse while he was a student at Oswego State. Now he's one of the most recognizable TV personalities, has his own show \"Wake Up with Al\" on The Weather Channel, owns the production company Al Roker Entertainment, and has written several cookbooks and New York Times bestsellers.\n\n1. Tom Cruise\n\nDespite constant media scrutiny, actor Tom Cruise was Hollywood's highest-paid actor in 2012 thanks to blockbusters like \"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol.\" The three-time Academy Award nominee's long career includes movies like \"Top Gun,\" \"Jerry Maguire,\" \"Minority Report\" and \"Risky Business.\" Though his family moved quite a bit when he was a child, the international superstar was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV in Syracuse, N.Y. on July 3, 1962, and will thus be forever tied to Central New York. (Fun fact: In \"All the Right Moves,\" Cruise's character is asked about whether he's heard from Syracuse University as a possible college destination.)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n100-81:\n\nSheldon Leonard, Jimmy Cavallo, Johnny Messner, more\n\n80-61:\n\nRon O'Neal, Betsey Johnson, Gary Holland, Chris Wedge, more\n\n60-41:\n\nFrank Langella, Eric Carle, Vera Farmiga, more\n\n40-21:\n\nGrace Jones, Jerry Stiller, Taye Diggs, Lou Reed, more\n\n20-1:"
