Syracuse native Tom Cruise smiles at the mention of his hometown -- even when he's on a marathon media blitz.

The "Edge of Tomorrow" star attended three premieres of his new film in three cities (in three countries) in one day last week. At an afterparty, Cruise signed autographs and posed for pictures with fans around 1 a.m. after the third movie screening in New York City.

Videos show one exchange where the 51-year-old actor was asked about the recent passing of Maya Angelou and one man told Cruise he was also born in the Salt City.

"Oh, is that right?" Cruise responds with his movie star grin.

The three-time Oscar nominee, Hollywood's highest-paid actor in 2012, was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV in Syracuse, N.Y. on July 3, 1962. His family moved around several times when he was a child, but his birthplace will always tie him to Central New York.

He remained at the NYC event until 3:30 a.m., wrapping up his 24-hour world tour that included stops in London and Paris.

"Edge of Tomorrow," originally titled "All You Need Is Kill," stars Cruise as military PR man Maj. William Cage, who goes into battle against an alien invasion and dies -- but then comes back to live his final day over and over again in a futuristic, action-heavy twist on "Groundhog Day." Emily Blunt co-stars as a highly-trained Army soldier who helps Cage.

It's the latest blockbuster adventure for "our last real movie star," whose credits include "Top Gun," "Mission: Impossible," "Jerry Maguire" and "Born on the Fourth of July." However, a new book titled "Tom Cruise: Anatomy of an Actor," claims the Internet and a certain couch-jumping incident hurt his star power more than scrutiny of his personal life, relationships and Scientology beliefs.

"Edge of Tomorrow" opens Friday, June 6.
