NAKED MASSACRE (1976): A solitary American soldier stops in Belfast on his way home from Vietnam. Already traumatized by the horrors of war, he is driven to madness by the IRA bombings shaking the city. With no money to complete his journey, he becomes fixated on eight young nurses living together in a boarding house. His mind snapping, the soldier invades the girls' home, subjecting them to a horrific night of rape, terror, and murder...Loosely based on the real-life Richard Speck murders, Naked Massacre is a brutal, uncompromising portrayal of madness and violence. Also released as Born for Hell, it is a West German-Canadian-French-Italian co-production (extremely loose tax shelter laws were in place during the late 1970s for international co-productions, reducing the financial risk for unusual movies such as Naked Massacre.) Director Denis HÃ©roux also made the British horror anthology film The Uncanny (1977) with Peter Cushing and Ray Milland.
