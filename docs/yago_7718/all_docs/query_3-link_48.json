        "text": "New month, new horror recommendations from Deep Cuts Rising. This installment features selections reflecting the month of April 2024.\n\nRegardless of how they came to be here, or what they’re about, these past movies can generally be considered overlooked, forgotten or unknown.\n\nThis month’s offerings include telepathic plants, ecological horrors, and a lot of killer cats.\n\nThe Uncanny (1977)\n\nDirected by Denis Héroux.\n\nThe Uncanny is a two-for kind of deal: it works for both National Pet Day (April 11) and Tell a Story Day (April 27). Here we have Peter Cushing‘s character talking at length about the evils of cats, with his three examples fleshing out this singular anthology. And while this film is often mistaken for an Amicus production, it was, in fact, made by The Rank Organisation. However, Amicus co-founder Milton Subotsky was also a co-producer.\n\nThe Uncanny has a tendency to be one-note in its execution and story styles; vengeful felines come up more than once in the film. Even so, these macabre, cat-centric segments told in EC Comics fashion are more entertaining than not.\n\nWatch The Uncanny at streaming sites such as SCREAMBOX.\n\nThe Kirlian Witness (1979)\n\nDirected by Jonathan Sarno.\n\nThe Kirlian Witness (also known as The Plants are Watching) fits the bill when looking for something to watch on International Plant Appreciation Day (April 13). Similar to Eyes of Laura Mars, this film’s story is built on pseudoscience. More specifically, Kirlian photography. Nancy Snyder‘s character Rilla hopes to use this technique — revealing the energy field, or aura, of people and other animate things — to solve her sister’s murder. However, the only witness to the sister’s death, apart from the mysterious killer, is a plant. Rilla’s bizarre investigation eventually leads her to a startling discovery.\n\nJonathan Sarno’s film is a certified slow-burn, but it’s also intriguing and good-looking. This oddball of crime-solving horror is, at the very least, unique.\n\nThe Kirlian Witness is available for rental/purchase (under its alias) at digital retailers like Apple TV.\n\nScream for Help (1984)\n\nDirected by Michael Winner.\n\nFor Scream Day this year (April 24), why not visit Scream for Help? In this teenage thriller filtered through Death Wish, a Nancy Drew type suspects her stepfather is up to no good. And when her suspicions are proven right, she and her mother have to fight for their lives.\n\nScream for Help had the makings of a standard ’80s teen-slasher, but this turned out to be more like an “afterschool special meets home invasion” flick. And a hilarious one at that. It was likely not Michael Winner’s intention for this film to be so laugh-a-minute — star Lolita Lorre, bless her heart, has the funniest deliveries — however, trying to keep a straight face during his cinematic hot mess is impossible. Tom Holland‘s script was straight up murdered. Still and all, this is an entertaining disasterpiece that would have been an entirely different film had the original director, Richard Franklin, stayed on (rather than going off to direct Link).\n\nThe HD restoration of Scream for Help is available on Blu-ray from Scream Factory, but the digital version is standard-def.\n\nPenumbra (2012)\n\nDirected by Ramiro García Bogliano & Adrián García Bogliano.\n\nWhile it’s advised not to stare at the sun during the solar eclipse on April 8, fans of satirical horror are encouraged to give Penumbra, an Argentinian-Mexican film featuring an imminent solar eclipse, a watch. The unsubtle artwork suggests a straightforward survival story, however, the actual product is quite different and twisty. Cristina Brondo plays a prickly businesswoman who may have made her last sale; her new client has ulterior motives.\n\nSurely some viewers will be put off by the protagonist of Penumbra, whose behavior in anticipation of the ominous eclipse is problematic. Yet, strangely enough, her being an imperfect victim adds something to the film, whereas a more pristine character would have made the whole experience less gripping.\n\nPenumbra is currently available on AMC+.\n\nStrange Nature (2018)\n\nDirected by James Ojala.\n\nFor a less known eco-horror film to watch this Earth Day (April 22), Strange Nature tells its story with both urgency and force. Here, the late Lisa Sheridan (of FreakyLinks) played a struggling single mother looking into a local anomaly: mutated frogs. Soon enough, the cause of this abnormality extends beyond the water and creates other threats for the town’s human residents.\n\nThis truly indie production has its obvious limitations, yet the story — one based on a real life incident in Minnesota — and characters compensate for any visual flaws. The practical effects for the mutant beast are also admirable, given the meager resources available.\n\nStrange Nature is currently streaming on Tubi.\n\nNo genre is as prolific as horror, so it’s understandable that movies fall through the cracks all the time. That is where this recurring column, Deep Cuts Rising, comes in. Each installment of this series will spotlight several unsung or obscure movies from the past — some from way back when, and others from not so long ago — that could use more attention.\n\nI think part of our collective fascination with serial killers comes from an empathetic desire to uncover exactly what needs to go wrong for a human being to snap and turn into a murderer. That’s why it makes sense that this form of morbid curiosity lies at the heart of so many successful horror stories, with countless genre filmmakers trying their best to explore the minds of predators.\n\nAnd in honor of M. Night Shyamalan’s latest thriller expertly allowing us to see through the eyes of a cold-blooded murderer, we’ve decided to come up with a list highlighting six other serial killer movies told from the killer’s perspective. After all, there are plenty of interesting cinematic killers out there, and not all of them are as charming as Josh Hartnett in Trap.\n\nAs usual, don’t forget to comment below with your own murderous favorites if you think we missed a particularly thrilling one. And while we won’t be including it on the list, I’d also like to give a shout-out to Chris Nash’s avant-garde slasher In a Violent Nature, which follows a Jason-Voorhees-inspired murderer as he embarks on a vengeful rampage.\n\nWith that out of the way, onto the list…\n\n6. Mr. Brooks (2007)\n\nI can’t be the only one who wishes Kevin Costner did more horror movies. While Bruce A. Evans’ deep dive into the mind of a fractured man is more of a psychological thriller than a proper scary movie, it’s still proof that Costner can be legitimately terrifying when he chooses to be.\n\nTelling the story of a seemingly normal man who secretly struggles to keep his murderous alter ego under control, Mr. Brooks doesn’t exactly re-invent the serial killer wheel with its ruminations on addiction, but you can’t help but sympathize with Costner as his double life spirals out of control.\n\nAnd if you like this one, don’t forget to check out our interview with the director as he explores the film’s unmade sequels!\n\n5. Maniac (1980)\n\nIt’s rare that both a horror film and its remake are equally good explorations of their respective subject matter, but since we already included Franck Khalfoun’s Maniac on our list recommending six experimental slashers, today I’d like to highlight the grimy thrills of William Lustig’s 1980 original. It may not feature the same POV gimmick as its 2012 successor, but Maniac still does a phenomenal job of putting viewers in the shoes of a deeply disturbed individual.\n\nFollowing a murderous landlord as he slays (and scalps) his way through New York City, this brutal character study is only enhanced by its low production value and seedy Manhattan backdrop. Lustig makes the most of eerie street corners and dark alleyways here, making this film a memorable portrait of urban chaos – as well as one hell of a disturbing gore-fest.\n\n4. The House that Jack Built (2018)\n\nEven Lars von Trier’s more conventional films tend to tackle controversial subject matter, but The House that Jack Built takes the director’s penchant for dark stories to the next level with its portrayal of a deeply malevolent man that embodies all the worst traits of famous serial killers. Feeling a lot like an art-house companion piece to American Psycho, this mean-spirited romp is so gruesome that you often forget it’s meant to be satirical.\n\nFrom animal cruelty to the disturbingly realistic slaughter of innocent women, this is one of the most uncomfortable movies on this list, but it also features a mesmerizing performance by the incredibly talented Matt Dillon. That alone already makes it worth the price of admission. I wouldn’t recommend this one to duck lovers, though.\n\n3. Peeping Tom (1960)\n\nMoral panics are nothing new, especially when it comes to media depicting grisly acts of murder. And while some desensitized viewers might not understand why this 1960 thriller nearly ruined its director’s career, I think Peeping Tom still holds up as one of the UK’s earliest example of schlocky exploitation.\n\nA surprisingly meta story about the thrills of watching others die on celluloid, Peeping Tom introduces us to an aspiring filmmaker who secretly murders women and produces snuff films about their dying moments – a decidedly modern premise for a movie produced decades before the slasher craze.\n\n2. Man Bites Dog (1992)\n\nOne of the most shocking examples of Found Footage/mockumentary filmmaking that doesn’t involve the paranormal, this pioneer Belgian flick is way more influential than most genre fans give it credit for. Inspiring everything from Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon to What We Do in the Shadows, Man Bites Dog is another case of storytellers using serial killing as an excuse to explore our fascination with violent media.\n\nAnd while the film is presented as a serious documentary about a charming murderer who slowly recruits the filmmakers to his cause, it’s the satirical undertones that make it so effective. That being said, you’ll likely forget the humorous elements when Ben commits some of the most heinous acts ever put on film.\n\n1. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986)\n\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is loosely inspired by claims made by real life murderer Henry Lee Lucas (as well as his partner in crime Otis Toole), and while most of the supposed 600 deaths once attributed to Henry have since been proven to be false confessions, John McNaughton’s low budget character study escapes its sensationalist True Crime origins due to its honest and unflinching portrayal of antisocial behavior.\n\nFrom the gritty 16mm photography to the frighteningly realistic death scenes, there’s plenty to love about this controversial indie flick. However, the film’s greatest asset is a young Michael Rooker in a career-making role as our disturbed main character.\n\nJust make sure you don’t choose this one for family movie night."
