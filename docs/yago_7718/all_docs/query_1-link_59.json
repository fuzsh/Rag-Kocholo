        "text": "This movie has everything. Naked girls. Torture. A fancy nightclub on a boat. Doomsday preacher banging on trash can lids. A giant cop dangling a tiny gangster out of a window. Slap fights on the beach.\n\nThis movie is kinda long but a lot happens. So much happens that as I think back on it I find myself wondering if I'm sandwiching a few movies together into one in my brain but I'm not. This movie goes from gangsters on a murdering spree to focusing on the police trying to catch them and not a single minute is wasted film.\n\nI can't even properly put it into words. Just watch the movie. You won't regret it.\n\nTip-toes on the balance beam between trash and art before slipping and landing so far on the former side that you wonder if it will ever be able to walk again, let alone get on a balance beam. And like an actual gymnast falling off of a balance beam, it's more entertaining than many more competent performances. I don't know where the balance beam analogy came from, there are no gymnasts in the movie.\n\nThe action scenes are somehow more awkward than the ones in The Life Aquatic, which were of course awkward on purpose.\n\nSo was the fat guy on that boat or not?\n\nThis movie is completely, wonderfully incredible. If anyone tells you different, please remove them from your life with all due haste. A man talks to a woman's shoe as if it were a phone, a bearded gentleman clangs a trash can lid while screaming about impending doom, and a lot of sex (and a smidge of violence) happens both on and off a boat (which is also a sexy nightclub). Directed by Jean-Pierre Bastid in disguise as \"Jean-Loup Grosdard.\"\n\nHypnotic, pictorially beautiful, and hilarious is not a combo that gets struck very often, so it's appropriate that it's been struck completely by accident here. Has a similar pulp-inflected dream vibe to Jess Franco, but I wouldn't want to march into battle armed only with that comparison, since this is really in a universe of its own. Happy to have joined the loose-knit fraternity of people who have watched this more than once."
