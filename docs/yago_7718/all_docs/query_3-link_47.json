        "text": "Right, so, before we move forward with the review I feel like I just have to point out that this movie was released the same year as Star Wars. Not that that should suggest in any way that I’m throwing some kinda shade at Canadian film director Denis Héroux’s 1977 horror anthology, The Uncanny, for not matching Star Wars’ glossy glitz and groundbreaking special effects — for one, they’re substantially different movies, and secondly, the budgets are hardly comparable (not that Star Wars was ‘big budget’ necessarily, but compared to The Rank Organization's output, it might as well have cost a billion dollars) — rather my point is that iconic British actor Peter Cushing had five movies released that year, including The Uncanny, and three of them were horror movies, one of them a war drama, and then George Lucas’ space-opera, and, like… look, I get the impact Star Wars had on audiences, and on movies in general. Hell, I guess I’m even a fan; at least, I certainly was when I was a kid… I’m an adult now, so while they have nostalgia value, I don’t tend to treat kids movies like they’re the fucking Holy Grail! But, as you’re settling in for a night of watching the 1,968th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or you’re desperately clambering to find out which bald lump of muscle is gonna win Fast & Furious 723, it doesn’t seem like much of a stretch, to me at least, to wonder if maybe we all backed the wrong horse. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t curious to see what the state of Hollywood cinema might look like now, had it been Héroux’s absurdly feline obsessed horror that had somehow smashed its way into popular culture, and not that movie with the space wizards and a gold butler with a trashcan for a friend (lol).\n\nOkay, so enough Star Wars bashing. The Uncanny is a horror anthology, as I mentioned earlier, in a similar vein to the omnibus films of British horror studio Amicus Productions. However, despite there being several notable comparisons to the likes of Tales from the Crypt, The Vault of Horror, and Asylum — The Uncanny features a wraparound segment, and proudly boasts a performance from Amicus alumni Cushing, as well as an hilarious turn from Donald Pleasance as a pompous Hollywood actor — the movie is actually a production of The Rank Organization (which also, interestingly enough, financed Ealing’s iconic 1945 horror portmanteau, Dead of Night), although Amicus’ Milton Subotsky does act as co-producer. The wraparound sees Cushing’s Wilbur Gray, an author, visiting his publisher, Frank Richards (played by The Lost Weekend’s Ray Milland) to discuss his new book, which is, er… all about cats! You see, Gray believes cats are actually supernatural creatures and in cahoots with the Devil, and in order to illustrate his point, he recounts three feline-centric tales of terror. Now, if that sounds just a tad ridiculous, well… buckle up, buster! You ain’t seen nothing yet. The bulk of the flick is, of course, made up of the tales themselves, and each one is as batshit as you might expect based on that set-up.\n\nSo, full disclosure, I’m a sucker for this particular era of British horror. From the big hitters, like Hammer or Amicus, to the smaller output, there’s just something about the style and aesthetic of it all that I’m drawn to. They’re never all that inventive in terms of shot design or camera movement, but within the frame — the mise-en-scène, the lighting, the performances, the music — there’s always so much to love. Sure, they’re often sorta cheesy and goofy, but then that’s all part of the charm. Plus, there’s just something about the beautiful blend of pulpy, schlocky nonsense and British cinematic prestige that I can’t help but fall for (seriously, it is an absolute travesty that this country doesn’t have a solid and active film industry in the way it once did… we may not be able to rival Hollywood in terms of scale, but when it comes to the horror genre, there ain’t no one does it better, hun). Perhaps what I love the most about these kinds of flicks, though, is just how devilishly mean-spirited they can be. Almost every single one of them, dating right the way back to Dead of Night, have their tongue firmly in their cheek. There is a sort of knowing humor running throughout, and yet in almost every British anthology I can think of, each story usually has a rather nasty or unexpectedly vicious conclusion. Even when the shorts themselves don’t necessarily hold up, you can pretty much place money on the ending being blackly ironic or surprisingly grisly in some form or another. The Uncanny is not an exception, and, actually, I think I’d go so far as to say it’s nastier than most. Each of the three tales recounted by Cushing’s Gray feature some kind of shockingly gruesome moment, and while the film itself does suffer from that age old anthology problem (some segments are better than others, etc.) I will say that here, at least all three are enjoyable."
