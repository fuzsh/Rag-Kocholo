Bruno Mourral\n\nTwo bumbling kidnappers take on more than they can handle when plans for their political hostage go straight to hell in the streets of Haiti. Grit and day-glo colors of the Caribbean propel director Bruno Mourral’s pastiche of your favorite crime capers and real-life events (his crew was kidnapped while making the film), creating something unique to represent this troubled nation’s societal trials, with classism, colorism, and corruption touching every segment of society.\n\nIn KIDNAPPING INC., Mourral presents these issues in a snappy, brutally comedic debut feature, centering around the most prominent crime in Haiti. Official Selection: Sundance 2024. Canadian Premiere.\n\nTHE KILLERS (South Korea) – dirs.

There is a wild energy to RATS! that can only be described as evil SpongeBob flash animation bad tripping off Xanax… just the sort of madness you used to watch on NewGrounds while your parents weren’t paying attention!\n\nChanneling the filth of films like STREET TRASH and THE GREASY STRANGLER, co-directors Nalevansky and Fry prove they have the chops to stand tall amongst the legends of absurdist comedy.

Canadian Premiere.\n\nTIMESTALKER (UK) – dir. Alice Lowe\n\nAlice Lowe (PREVENGE) returns with an ingenious, Python-esque time-jumping/reincarnation anti-rom-com unlike anything audiences have ever seen, wherein a woman continuously seeks out the presumed love of her life across time. Co-starring Jacob Anderson (HBO’s Game of Thrones), Nick Frost (SHAUN OF THE DEAD, THE WORLD’S END), and Aneurin Barnard (DUNKIRK), this bloody brilliant – and brilliantly bloody – film impales the heart of the romantic comedy on the sharpest sword imaginable, proving some lessons are just too hard to learn in one lifetime. Official Selection: SXSW 2024. Canadian Premiere.\n\nTWILIGHT OF THE WARRIORS: WALLED IN (Hong Kong) – dir. Soi Cheang\n\nThe Hong Kong box office sensation that caused a wild reaction at the Cannes Film Festival arrives in its first Canadian stop over before going wide across North America. Award winning director Soi Cheang (MAD FATE) directs this period neo noir actioner set in Hong Kong’s Kowloon Walled City, a dangerous, densely populated monolith, demolished in 1995, where fists and blades would settle scores and no law enforcement dared to enter.\n\nWALLED IN features some of cinema’s most jaw-breaking and audacious fight scenes, recalling the glory 1980s and 90s kung fu cinema.

Joel Potrykus\n\nTwo friends trudge through a Michigan forest with the intention of following through on a disturbing pact.

Sean MacGregor\n\nA group of catty adults in a remote chalet become the “toys” of murderous children in this prime slice of offbeat ‘70s cinema. A drive-in favorite and cult classic, co-starring Sorrell Booke (The Dukes of Hazzard’s Boss Hogg) and teen-heartthrob-to-be Leif Garrett, opposite his real-life mom Carolyn Stellar and little sister Dawn Lyn. World Premiere of Vinegar Syndrome’s new 4K restoration.\n\nHOLLYWOOD 90028 (USA, 1974) – dir. Christina Hornisher\n\nHOLLYWOOD 90028 is an existential serial-killer story that explores themes of pornography, fame, hopes, and fears filmed in 1970s Los Angeles. Unavailable for decades and once thought lost, this rarely seen cult classic has recently been rediscovered and hailed as a masterpiece by the likes of Arkasha Stevenson (THE FIRST OMEN), Anna Biller (THE LOVE WITCH), and Ti West (MAXXXINE), highlighting its significance as both a critique of the exploitation industry and a historical snapshot of 1970s Los Angeles.\n\nCanadian Premiere of Grindhouse Releasing’s new 4K restoration, presented as a special book launch event for Heidi Honeycutt’s “I Spit on Your Celluloid” (Headpress Books).\n\nKILLER CONSTABLE (Hong Kong, 1980) – dir. Kuei Chih-Hung\n\nImagine, if you will, a wuxia version of Judge Dredd in old China from Kuei Chih-Hung, the controversial director of BOXER’S OMEN. Here, Kuei unleashes his only wuxia film, widely considered a profound martial-arts masterpiece that brilliantly subvers the genre with its unique dark horror and bleak undertones, while offering incredible action set pieces. Rarely seen in North America for 30 years. World Premiere of the killer new restoration from Arrow Films.\n\nLA LOI DU COCHON (Quebec, 2001) – dir. Érik Canuel\n\nStéphane Brousseau, 27, is a compulsive gambler. Faced with an ultimatum from the bank, which is about to seize the pig farm she inherited from her father, she tries to make a quick buck by selling a crop of pot that two city criminals are growing on her land. Behind this seemingly simple framework, the film boasts a complex script with a thousand twists and turns, and inventive direction from the late director Érik Canuel.\n\nA remarkable feature debut for the artist, a man of many talents and extraordinary energy, who would go on to make some of Quebec’s most important genre works, including LE DERNIER TUNNEL (2004), THE OUTLANDER (2005), CADAVRES (2009) and LAC MYSTÈRE (2013). His biggest hit was BON COP, BAD COP (2006), which world premiered at Fantasia and went on to become one of the highest grossing Canadian films of all time domestically. Archival 35mm Print Memorial Screening with a posthumous Denis-Héroux award for the beloved Érik Canuel, who passed away on June 15 of this year. Cast in attendance.\n\nThroughout a highly productive career that included numerous feature films, commercials, music videos, and episodes of major television series, Érik Canuel was always proud of his status as a genre director. He was not only a director of fantastic cinema, but of all genres – and an artist who broke down doors, making way for younger generations of artists, all while legitimizing genre film in Quebec. The festival is proud to present a Denis-Héroux Award posthumously to Érik Canuel, signaling an exceptional contribution to the development and dissemination of Quebec genre cinema.\n\nLOVE AND POP (Japan, 1998) – dir. Hideaki Anno\n\nMade in 1998, not long after the success of NEON GENESIS EVANGELION, LOVE AND POP was director Hideaki Anno’s first live-action feature film. Despite already being established as a filmmaker, Anno embraced new technologies and unconventional stylistic choices to tell the story of Hiromi (Asumi Miwa) and her schoolgirl friends as they engage in enjo kosai, or “compensated dating,” where older men pay young girls for dates.\n\nUsing new digital cameras, Anno seemed limited by only his imagination as he shot the film. The resulting experience is a transgressive examination of transactional desire with a style that embodies the full creative range of the underground spirit. Underground section. Presented in a new restoration from King Record Co., Ltd.\n\nTHE RUBBER GUN (Canada, 1977) – dir. Allan Moyle\n\nA young Stephen Lack (SCANNERS) co-wrote and stars in this gritty directorial debut of Quebec filmmaker Allan Moyle (TIMES SQUARE, PUMP UP THE VOLUME, EMPIRE RECORDS), set against Montréal’s 70s drug scene. Before this, Moyle notably collaborated with Frank Vitale on the indie classics MONTRÉAL MAIN and EAST END HUSTLE. An exploitation film in the form of experimental cinéma verité, this radical 70s classic evokes the work of Canadians Robin Spry and Ted Kotcheff, as well as the early films of John Cassavetes and Jim McBride. North American Premiere of Canadian International Pictures’ new 4K restoration.\n\nTIKI TIKI (Canada, 1971) – dir. Gerald Potterton\n\nA genuine lost gem of adult-oriented animation, 1971’s strange and hilarious hybrid production TIKI TIKI—the story of an easy-riding, film-directing ape and a multimillion-dollar contraption called the FMM 70, the world’s first all-purpose, rocket-propelled, flying movie machine—is among the titles resurrected under Telefilm’s Canadian Cinema Reignited program.\n\nDirected by HEAVY METAL’s Gerald Potterton, it combines animation in the filmmaker’s pop-psychedelic style – so recognizable from YELLOW SUBMARINE – with repurposed live-action footage from AYBOLIT-66, a Soviet children’s fantasy film. A sassy satire of Hollywood, it’s a weird and wonderful slice of Canadian countercultural cool. World Premiere of Canadian International Pictures’ new 4K restoration.\n\nA PLETHORA OF SPECIAL LIVE EVENTS\n\nFantasia is proud to reveal the following exciting array of special live events occurring throughout its 2024 edition, the majority of which will be presented free-of-charge.\n\nFilm screening and lecture\n\nEVERY FRAME A PAINTING PRESENTS THE SECOND\n\nModerated by Vincenzo Nappi\n\nFree admission\n\nSaturday July 20, 4:00PM, Cinéma du Musée\n\nTaylor Ramos and Tony Zhou, Vancouver-based creators of the wildly popular YouTube video essay series “Every Frame a Painting” – which has amassed 2 million subscribers – are coming to Fantasia!
