My mother bought herself an album in 1979, I claimed ownership that same day and have been in love with Dolly Parton every single day since. At 6 “Nine To Five” came out and it’s been my favorite movie since. I charmed all kinds of aunts/uncles, family friends to bring me. I for sure saw it more times in the cinema than all previous cinema visits combined, I was 6 of course LOL. Is it the best movie made in 1980? No. I gave Scorsese director based on that. I didn’t even nominate Colin Higgins even though it’s my favorite movie ever. The chemistry between the cast, the underdog triumph and of course Dolly seal the deal for best picture though. Dolly also wins my lead actress. She gives a wonderful, natural unstudied performance. Look up Roger Ebert’s review, 90% of it is a love letter to Parton. I like the rest of the film better than he does though. I considered Tomlin as well, but there wasn’t room. Of the Oscar nominees Burstyn & Spacek are neck n neck for the top spot, I rank Spacek higher only bc Burstyn gets my top spot from Oscar nominees more often.\n\nBesides all that, there are arguments to place Sutherland, Moore, Duvall & Sarandon in opposing acting categories. I’m good with placing them where I did. I also love the chance to include 2 silly ass performances from Murray & Nielsen in supporting actor.\n\nPicture: “Nine To Five”, “Breaker Morant”, “The Elephant Man”, “Raging Bull”. “The Shining”\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese -“Raging Bull”, Stanley Kubrick -“The Shining”, Akira Kurosawa -“Kagemusha”, David Lynch -“The Elephant Man”, François Truffaut -“The Last Metro”\n\nLeading Actor: John Hurt -“The Elephant Man”, Robert DeNiro -“Raging Bull”, Anthony Hopkins -“The Elephant Man”, Jack Nicholson -“The Shining”, Donald Sutherland -“Ordinary People”\n\nLeading Actress: Dolly Parton -“Nine To Five”, Ellen Burstyn -“Resurrection”, Goldie Hawn -“Private Benjamin”, Mary Tyler Moore -“Ordinary People”, Sissy Spacek -“Coal Miner’s Daughter”\n\nSupporting Actor: Bill Murray -“Caddyshack”, Bryan Brown -“Breaker Morant”, Leslie Nielsen -“Airplane!”, Joe Pesci -“Raging Bull”, Jason Robards -“Melvin and Howard”\n\nSupporting Actress: Eileen Brennan -“Private Benjamin”, Shelley Duvall -“The Shining”, Barbara Hershey -“The Stunt Man”, Wendy Hiller -“The Elephant Man”, Susan Sarandon -“Atlantic City”\n\n1980 –\n\nOK, so a little bit about my childhood on.
