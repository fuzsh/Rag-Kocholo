        "text": "Hypnotic in the way that it pulverizes any lasting sense of innocence or decency, Born For Hell submerges you in a disturbing nightmare of depravity. A slow building wall of dread that gradually suffocates you into it's terrifying trance. Loosely based on the Chicago mass murderer Richard Speck, we follow a Vietnam vet drifter who terrorizes a dorm of nursing students in a grisly display of bloodshed and debauchery.\n\nAlso known as the \"Naked Massacre\" it's a film that easily lives up to it's controversial reputation. Ultra bleak and mean spirtited there's no shortage of graphic visuals and disturbing violence. When I was younger I would endlessly seek out films that would push the boundaries. My friends and I would…\n\nStep right up folks, chisel out a place to sit in this giant block of ice and pour yourself a glass of warm milk!\n\nThis is the cinema of the ultra-bleak, a slasher film where the kills are shrouded in a fog and the fog is an all encompassing frequency of pure agonizing terror.\n\nSet in Belfast during the \"Troubles\" and loosely based on the murders of Richard Speck, we follow a Vietnam vet drifting through this city in turmoil, eyeing a house of young nurses that after a good 30 minutes of world-building he descends upon like a filthy monster.\n\nIt feels like Last House on the Left invading and tormenting Black Christmas, except this villain is no David…\n\nScavenger Hunt 37/Film 15/watch a film that is streaming at The Internet Archive.\n\nA film based on the Richard Speck murders in 1966. Only this is not in Chicago but in Belfast and we have a Vietnam vet about to cause havoc and distress to a house full of nurses.\n\nThe film is exploitive with nudity, kills and shock value at the forefront but it really succeeds in its terror aspect. I actually felt glued to my seat throughout and Mathieu Carriere's facial expressions alone provide the fear as we really are seeing someone on the edge.\n\nThe film while dubbed I assume (doesn't sound over the top or bad) is a mixture of French, Italian and German involvement while…\n\nVietnam vet Cain finds himself delayed in Belfast on his way back to the USA, and being the mid-70s it's a city filled with soldiers, guns, tanks, huge public information billboards and the occasional terrorist bomb. Almost penniless, he bums around for a bit, hangs out at the smoky pub, has an encounter with a rough old prostitute... I wonder if this West German co-production was an influence on the recent Hamburg-set grimefest The Golden Glove. Having said that, both films are based on shocking real-life events, and the inspiration are the true stories, though this is by far the looser adaptation.\n\nIt's when Cain spots the eight student nurses living together over the road that true crime buffs will…\n\nMaybe if the killer learned the names and personalities of these nurses instead of counting heads, he'd have a 100% success rate. Very nice work on that subtle strong point.\n\nA very underrated, very thoughtful, grim work of exploitation horror that would pair well with 1981's Love Massacre for tied-up soon-to-be victims in the last third. Cinematic and artistic, Born For Hell may be too much for some, too cruel or nihilistic to enjoy. For others, maybe the lack of insert stab shots will tune them out, but it really has that Maniac or Angst filth to it. A running theme between correlation or causation telling people they are doomed to sin, violence between two religious factions (bombs and terrorism…"
