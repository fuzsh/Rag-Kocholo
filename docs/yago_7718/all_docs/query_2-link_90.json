        "text": "(AUSTIN, TX) — The Austin Film Society announced today the opening programs of the new AFS Cinema, the organization’s first ever two-screen arthouse theater. With the opening of the new theater in late May, AFS returns with its classic programming, including repertory series, new restorations, documentaries, independent films and premieres. Additionally, AFS has added a program of new releases, and will be offering full-schedule runs of the best in international and independent films that are new in theaters.\n\nAFS previously operated the space as a single screen art house before closing for renovations in November. Since then, AFS has hired a new General Manager for the space and a head chef, renovated the kitchen and lobby, and added a second screen in one of the building’s vacant event halls. On Monday, AFS announced a first look at their menu. The announcement of the program comes several weeks before the anticipated opening of the doors to the public on May 26th.\n\nRebecca Campbell, CEO of the Austin Film Society, remarked:\n\n“Opening the AFS Cinema is an enormous accomplishment involving a large, committed team of professionals and volunteers. This move allows AFS to vastly increase our signature film programming, add a much-needed program of new releases, and claim total control over our space, including a lobby that will become Austin’s living room for cinema lovers. Like with our artist services programs and Austin Studios, the Austin Film Society is setting a tone nationally and demonstrating what can happen for a community when it really gets behind the culture and production of film. We are so excited and grateful that this moment has finally come.”\n\nThe program, which is put together by AFS Head of Film & Creative Media Holly Herrick and Lead Programmer Lars Nilsen, sees a return of AFS’ beloved long-running repertory programs such as Essential Cinema and Doc Nights, in addition to some new monthly programs, new guest programmers, programming partnerships with archives and local organizations, and filmmakers in person for special event screenings. The AFS Programmers will be at the cinema for a free, in-person “Ask Me Anything” Q&A on Monday, June 5th at 7:30PM, an opportunity to discuss the films and AFS Cinema programming in general.\n\nThe first series at the new theater will appropriately be a “Texas Film Christening,” five classic films that show the depth and breadth of Texas film culture and history. The series includes 35mm screenings of RIO BRAVO, TENDER MERCIES, AUGUST EVENING (AFS Grant supported) and SUGARLAND EXPRESS, as well as a screening of the Director’s Cut of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW (digital restoration), which will be introduced by Richard Linklater at the May 27th screening.\n\nOther highlights of the opening repertory program include the Essential Cinema series “Comedy, Italian Style” a 6-film review of the vibrant 1960s Italian comedies that provided equal amounts hilarity and social critique, and featured brilliant actors of the period such as Marcello Mastroianni (DIVORCE, ITALIAN STYLE), Vittorio Gassman (IL SORPASSO), Sophia Loren and Anita Ekberg (BOCCACCIO ’70) and Alberto Sordi (MAFIOSO, THE WITCHES).\n\n“The Noir Canon” repertory series will present four films from the classic period of American Film Noir, and will include all 35mm screenings of ANGEL FACE, DETOUR, THE BLUE DAHLIA and KISS ME DEADLY.\n\nAFS will also present several new DCP (digital) restorations, including the Japanese masterpiece, UGETSU, Guillermo del Toro’s PAN’S LABYRINTH, and mod/avant garde feature, FUNERAL PARADE OF ROSES.\n\nJohn Pierson and special guests will present an evening of “Split Screen,” Pierson’s 90s “magazine-style” show about the era’s American independent filmmakers, also recently restored by the Criterion Collection.\n\nSeveral exciting new releases are already scheduled, and more will be announced each week after the cinema opens. Director Onur Tukel will come to Austin in person for the Austin premiere of his black comedy, CATFIGHT, starring Sandra Oh and Anne Heche.\n\nOther announced new releases include Ken Loach’s Palme D’Or Winning feature, I, DANIEL BLAKE, which will open for a full run on June 2nd, and the Moroccan western MIMOSAS, winner of Cannes Critic’s Week.\n\nAFS is introducing several new monthly series beginning in June, including an all ages program for families, taking place on select Sundays, entitled “Sunday School”. The program aims to introduce children and youth to great works of global cinema that the adults in their lives will want to see, too. The first title in “Sunday School” is LITTLE FUGITIVE (1953). The series is guest programmed by Stacy Brick.\n\n“Cinema of Resistance” is a monthly program that pairs important films about community organizing and social movements with informative post-screening discussions. The first selection of the series is HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE, followed by a discussion led by AFS Founding Board Member Chale Nafus and former ACT UP NYC activist, Brian Zabcik.\n\nDeep End is a new art-cult screening series, guest programmed by Jazmyne Moreno and featuring a pre-show musical performance at each event. The inaugural title ON THE SILVER GLOBE, the jaw-droppingly strange and beautiful — and banned — sci-fi epic by POSSESSION director Andrzej Żuławski. DJ Adult Themes will spin an all-vinyl sci-fi-inspired set of 70s-80s kosmische electronic music before the show.\n\nAdditionally, AFS released several of its custom video trailers:\n\nComedy Italian Style >>\n\nFilm Noir Canon >>\n\nRio Bravo (part of the Texas Film Christening) >>\n\nBelow is the full program announcement."
