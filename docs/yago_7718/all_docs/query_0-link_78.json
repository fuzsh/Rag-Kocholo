        "text": "French actress (born 1956)\n\nChristine Boisson (born 8 April 1956) is a French actress.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter she registered in a model agency, Just Jaeckin liked her photo, and she got a part in the film Emmanuelle starring Sylvia Kristel, in which she played a lollipop-sucking teenager who masturbates over a picture of Paul Newman. Then she got some more film roles, but she also continued to study acting.\n\nIn 1977, she made her stage debut in Chekhov's The Seagull directed by Bruno Bayen.\n\nIn 1984, she received the Prix Romy Schneider (most promising actress awards) for Rue Barbare.\n\nIn 2005, she was starring in the stage play Viol by Botho Strauß (based on Titus Andronicus), directed by Luc Bondy.\n\nIn 2010. it was widely reported that she had attempted suicide after she climbed over the parapet of her 5th floor apartment and was stopped by firefighters. In a later interview, she said she had done this after an argument with her boyfriend at the time as an act of psychological manipulation, an action she was not proud of. She also described growing up with an abusive mother who constantly reminded her that she had almost died giving birth to her, and sexually abused both her and her brother.[1]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nStage\n\n[edit]\n\n1977-1978: La mouette by Anton Chekhov (directed by Bruno Bayen)\n\n1978: La mouette reprise at Théâtre Nanterre-Amandiers\n\n1978: Etre vidé (directed by Remo Girones)\n\n1978: Et pourtant ce silence ne pouvait by Magnan\n\n1978: Antoine et Cléopâtre by William Shakespeare\n\n1978: Périples, prince de Tyr by Shakespeare (directed by Roger Planchon) - T.N.P.
