A descendant, John Krollfeiffer, who has written a biography of Edward, provides many of the details about Edward’s personal and business life that are included in this entry. Edward attended an academy in Versailles, France, and was also educated at the Department of Public Education in Brooklyn where he was issued a report card stating that he was “A Good Boy.” A letter from Krollpfeiffer to his parents from an unnamed university states, “My studies here at the university are arduous, and I look forward to visiting home in the coming springtime.” Krollpfeiffer was fluent in German, French, Italian and Spanish. The descendant has pamphlets and theater tickets from performances that Edward attended in Rome and Venice.\n\nKrollpfeiffer’s pension record indicates service in the 71st New York State Militia. As per John Krollpfeiffer, Edward enlisted on April 19, 1861, in Company A of the 71st New York State Militia, for a period of three years. His descendant relates that the uniform chevrons suggest that he was a sergeant major in the 71st National Guard; it is not known whether the promotion occurred during or after the Civil War. According to his obituary in the New York Herald, he was with the 9th Regiment at the Battle of Bull Run. His descendant notes that Edward was a private business agent during 1862 and that he possesses a pass dated December 19, 1863, noting that Edward accompanied Mlle. Felicita de Vestvali, an actress and opera singer, to the front lines.\n\nIntriguingly, during 1862 through 1865, while performing his military service, Krollpfeiffer was also working as a private business agent and public relations person for several prominent people including Julia Raymond, a stage actress; Francis Bang, a lawyer; and Charles D. Fredericks, a photographer.\n\nIn 1866, Edward married Anna Hodges Work at the Plymouth Church in Brooklyn; the officiant at the ceremony was Henry Ward Beecher (see). The couple had two daughters, Grace, born in 1868 and Edna, born in 1889. In 1867, Edward filed for bankruptcy, as per an unnamed source.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Krollpfeiffer had many jobs. His descendant indicates that he joined his father’s brokerage at 42 Pine Street on May 1, 1871; the firm was then renamed E. Krollpfeiffer & Son. That enterprise bought and sold commercial paper. By March 1, 1875, Edward was the sole proprietor and merged or operated out of Hiram Pool’s bank and commercial paper brokerage at 2 Nassau Street, New York City. Among other business ventures, his descendant notes that Krollpfeiffer was a coal merchant, notary, and partner of the Wells Company Photographers at 26 West 14th Street in New York City. The descendant possesses business cards from the last named company and Edward’s notary seal.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Edward served in the 9th Regiment of the New York State Militia. He was discharged from the 9th Regiment of the New York State National Guard on June 25, 1877, as a sergeant. At the time of his discharge, he was 5′ 6¾” tall with a prominent nose, dark brown eyes and hair, a round chin, small mouth and dark complexion.\n\nAfter 26 years of marriage, Krollpfeiffer divorced his wife. His descendant notes that the divorce affected him emotionally and financially. He states that Edward’s net worth in 1888 was about $100,000, the equivalent of $3 million in 2022. As per the divorce papers, which John Knollpfeiffer possesses, Edward was a partner in the firm of Martin Rothbarth, a hops brokerage at 76 Broad Street and also in London. (At some point after 1908, Rothbarth was accused of bank fraud.) According to the Brooklyn Directory of 1888, Edward was employed as a clerk. He filed for bankruptcy after the divorce.\n\nSoon after his divorce, he married Caroline (Carolyn) Ledoux Garby in Brooklyn. They had a son, Raymond Marchaise Knollfpeiffer, in 1895. John Knollfpeiffer relates that his ancestor was active in social circles, traveled frequently to Liverpool on the White Star Line and owned real estate. Among his properties in Brooklyn were 329 and 407 Clinton Avenue; 829 State Street and a summer home in Bath Beach.\n\nHis last residence was 73 Grove Street in Brooklyn.

(1824-1887). Brigadier general by brevet; brigadier general, Second Brigade, Division 3; colonel, 58th New York Infantry. Krzyzanowski was originally interred at Green-Wood. On October 9, 1937, (or October 13, 1937, according to another source), his remains were moved with military honors to Arlington National Cemetery at which time President Franklin D. Roosevelt praised Krzyzanowski’s devotion to his adopted land. Born July 8, 1824, in Raznova, Poland, his ancestry included noble parents and first cousin Frederick Chopin. Forced to flee Poland after participating in a failed insurrection, he came to the United States from Hamburg, Germany. He learned the language, became a civil engineer before the Civil War and was instrumental in the westward expansion of the railroads.\n\nAfter raising a militia in the Washington, D.C., area (Turner’s Rifles), Krzyzanowski came to New York and raised the 58th Infantry known first as Morgan’s Rifles and later, as the “Polish Legion.” He was promoted to brigadier general on November 29, 1862, and led the Second Brigade from June 26, 1862-September 25, 1863, commanding the Army of Virginia and the Army of the Potomac. Among the battles in which he participated were Cross Keys in the Shenandoah Valley, and Second Bull Run and Chancellorsville in Virginia. During the Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, he was injured when his horse was killed in battle, but he refused to leave the battlefield. Jack D. Welsh, M.D., in Medical Histories of Union Generals (1996, p. 197), states that Krzyzanowski suffered from occasional pulmonary hemorrhages and asthma attacks after this injury. He subsequently commanded the Army and Department of the Cumberland from September 25, 1863-January 8, 1864, and from March 7, 1864-April 16, 1864. From July 15, 1864-March 15, 1865, he commanded the defenses of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroads in Tennessee. On March 13, 1865, he was brevetted to brigadier general when his earlier appointment expired without confirmation.\n\nAfter the War, Krzyzanowski was given duties in the governing of Alabama, and was appointed governor in Florida, Georgia, and Virginia. Although some attribute his name as the first governor of Alaska, Alaskan researchers claim that this is a myth that is widespread but untrue and undocumented. He then worked for the United States Treasury Department in Panama and as a customs agent in New York in 1883, serving there until poor health caused him to transfer to the drier climate in Tucson, Arizona, in 1886. (Ultimately, he was too frail to take the transfer.) As per his obituary in the New York Tribune, that detailed his Civil War service, Krzyzanowki organized the Adolph Von Steinwehr Post #192 of the G.A.R. and was an active Republican. On the 50th anniversary of his death, a special memorial ceremony was organized by Polish patriotic groups on January 31, 1937, that included a military escort to the 69th Regiment Armory in Manhattan. His portrait was presented two years later to the New-York Historical Society.\n\nKUHLMAN (or KUHLMANN), WILLIAM F. (1823-1863). Corporal, 20th New York Infantry, Company H.

He served on that ship and then was a marine at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The New York State census of 1855 shows that he was head of the household, lived in Brooklyn and worked as an apothecary. A receipt from the Brooklyn Navy Yard, dated in 1855, shows that he still was active in the Marine Corps.\n\nDuring the Civil War, La Barte enlisted as a landsman in the United States Navy at New York City for one year on August 9, 1861. As per his papers, he was an apothecary, and had previous Naval service of three and a half years. He described himself as 5′ 7½ tall with blue eyes, bald and light hair. Although that enlistment data shows a birth year of 1831, that is incorrect; other biographies and census records show that he was born in 1826.\n\nAt the time of the 1865 New York State census, he was married and lived in Brooklyn. The 1870 census, which spells his surname as La Barter, reports that was married, lived in Brooklyn, worked as a druggist and had a personal estate valued at $10,000. According to the 1880 census, he still worked as a druggist and lived in Brooklyn with his wife, Adelaide.

Three months later, he mustered into Company I of the New York 7th Heavy Artillery on August 18, 1863. At some point in his service, he was reduced in ranks to private. On February 15, 1865, he was promoted to corporal, and was transferred into Company D of his regiment on June 30. He mustered out on August 1, 1865, at Baltimore, Maryland.

The 1870 census reports that Lane was a physician in Philadelphia. He owned his own home, valued at $4,500, was married and had one child.\n\nLane’s interests turned to life insurance and his obituary reports that in December 1872, was appointed to a special office in the Manhattan Life Insurance Company of New York. In 1887, he became manager of agents, then rose to second vice president of the company in 1901. Lane became vice president of the company in 1905 and held that position until 1910, when he resigned because of health reasons.

That obituary concluded, “Dr. Lane was a man of sterling integrity, uprightness of purpose and beloved by all who knew him.” He was survived by two children from his marriage to Sarah Ward and one daughter from his second marriage to Sarah Thorne Wiley of Utica, New York. His death certificate states that he last lived in Brooklyn and was a physician. Lane’s last residence was at 395 Washington Avenue where he succumbed after a prolonged illness.

Section 135, lot 27263, grave 2004.\n\nLANIER, JAMES FRANKLIN DOUGHTY (1800-1881). Financier. Lanier was born in Beaufort County, North Carolina. As per his biography in the Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, edited by William S. Powell, his paternal ancestry traced a common ancestor with George Washington. That source also reports that his grandfather, James Lanier, was a captain in a light cavalry regiment in the American Revolution and later served under General Anthony Wayne in a campaign against Indians in the Northwest Territory. That article also notes that James’s father, Alexander Lanier, emancipated his two enslaved people in 1807 when the family moved to Ohio. The family then moved to Madison, Indiana, in 1817, where Alexander owned a dry goods store; in 1820, Alexander died, leaving debts that James eventually repaid. In 1819, James married Elizabeth Gardner in Madison, Indiana; they had eight children.\n\nJames Lanier studied law at Transylvania University, then served as the assistant clerk and later chief clerk of the Kentucky House of Representatives. He was the first president of the Madison, Kentucky, branch of the Indiana State Bank, and a federal pension agent for the Northwest. He represented Indiana at a meeting with European creditors and helped negotiate a deal that saved the state from bankruptcy. His first wife died in 1846; he then married Mary McClure in 1848; they had three children.\n\nIn 1849 he came to New York City, where he lived at 16 West 10th Street, and founded Winslow, Lanier & Company, which specialized in railroad bond issues. It was not uncommon for his firm to handle $1 million per day in these securities. He later successfully managed the Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne, & Chicago Railroad. His financial skills allowed him to repeatedly save the state of Indiana from bankruptcy, particularly during the Civil War.\n\nWhen the Civil War began, Lanier loaned the governor of Indiana $400,000, which allowed that state to equip its troops and send them off to fight for the Union. In 1862, when Indiana again faced a financial crisis, Lanier advanced $640,000 to save the day; the state repaid him in 1870. His Greek Revival mansion, completed in 1844 in Madison, Indiana, overlooking the Ohio River, survives and is open to the public as the James F.D. Lanier State Historic Site. As per Wikipedia, the state of Indiana preserved his residence in gratitude for his financial help. Section 98, lot 7131.\n\nLANKENAU (or LANKENAN), WILLIAM (1825?-1896). Second lieutenant, 158th New York Infantry, Companies G and I. Lankenau was born in Germany. The 1855 New York State census reports that he was living in Brooklyn with his wife Margaret, an infant daughter, his mother and his 17-year-old sister. That census suggests a birth year of about 1825 which is what his soldier records confirm; the Green-Wood database suggests that he was born in 1837. Being that there is only one soldier with his name in the entire Union Army of over three million, the man interred at Green-Wood is likely the soldier. As per the 1862 Brooklyn Directory, Lankenau was a merchant. The 1863 Brooklyn Directory notes that he was living at 431 West 82nd Street in New York City.\n\nHis soldier record, which uses the name Lankenan, shows that he enlisted as a corporal at Brooklyn on August 22, 1862, and mustered into Company G of the 158th New York Infantry six days later. He was promoted to sergeant on January 13, 1863, and then to second lieutenant on February 25, 1865, with rank from February 18.

He was discharged with his company on June 30, 1865, at Richmond, Virginia.\n\nAt the time of the 1872 New York City Directory, Lankenau was living at 108 Greenwich Street and working as a carpenter. The 1891 New York City Directory indicates that was living at 533 West 30th Street and was employed as a grocer. He last lived at 529 West 30th Street in New York City. His death was attributed to cancer. Section 203, lot 25925, grave 3.\n\nLANNING, RALPH AUGUSTUS (1835-1893). Captain, 83rd New York Infantry, Company D.

During the Civil War, he served with Morgan’s Cavalry Brigade, familiarly known as Morgan’s Raiders, a Confederate Regiment. As per his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, he enlisted with Morgan’s raiders at the onset of the Civil War and remained with that outfit throughout the conflict. His obituary notes that he had a saber scar on his left arm received while saving Morgan’s life during a skirmish with Federal Cavalry.\n\nAfter the War, Larcombe hiked across the country to California, took to sea and made several trips around the world before settling in New York. He then became manager of Alfred D. Beeken, Inc., a printing concern at 122 Chambers Street in Manhattan, and served with that firm for more than 20 years. In 1925, he and his wife, Florence, celebrated their golden (fifty years) wedding anniversary.

Large was captured at Fredericksburg, Virginia, on September 13, 1862, and paroled at Blue Ridge, Mountain, Virginia, the next day. The expiration of his service is uncertain. Although one record notes that Large mustered out on January 1, 1864, at Charlestown, Virginia, another record indicates that he deserted on that date. The 1890 Veterans Schedule, which confirms his Civil War service, indicates that he served for one year and four months, an unusual deployment, and further states that he was held at Libby Prison and that his papers had been “mislaid.”\n\nThe 1870 census shows that Large lived in Manhattan and was a stage driver. Large mustered into the James S. Wadsworth Post #77 of the G.A.R. on May 25, 1878; he listed his occupation as driver. As per his death certificate, he was a widower who worked as a driver. He last lived at 432 East 66th Street in Manhattan. His death was attributed to pneumonia. Section 15, lot 17263, grave 1856.\n\nLARK, PETER D. (1840-1899).

He re-enlisted on July 11, 1864 (re-enlistment credited to Boston, Massachusetts), and was discharged at West Point on July 11, 1867. He received a pension although there are no details. In 1893, he became a stableman at Green-Wood Cemetery and subsequently became a member of the Green-Wood police force which was dedicated to preventing crime and keeping order on the cemetery grounds. He was the captain of the twelve man force, a position that paid $70 a month and came with a small cottage on the grounds at 23rd Street and Seventh Avenue and free coal and gas.\n\nAccording to an article in the Brooklyn Brownstoner, Lark lived in the house with his much younger second wife, the daughter of a Green-Wood stableman, James Snell. The article went on to state that Peter Lark drank heavily and abused his young bride at which time she would leave and go to her mother’s nearby home before returning to live with him. After her mother died in February 1899, she would run to her brother’s house when she was beaten but again, would not let her family interfere in her domestic troubles. On the morning of March 5, 1899, Peter Lark failed to report on his nightly tour of the cemetery, a daily routine that he always handled. After his son summoned him to the kitchen for breakfast, all he heard was a single gunshot. Charles Lark ran to summon his step-uncle who refused to come with him to the house, then ran to another nearby relative who, upon reaching the cottage, found that Peter Lark had committed suicide with a gunshot to the head above his right ear.
