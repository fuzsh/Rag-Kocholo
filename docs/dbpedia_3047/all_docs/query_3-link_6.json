StubbsDeputy DirectorMG Joseph R. BaldwinCommand Chief Warrant OfficerCW5 Brian SearcyCommand Sergeant MajorCSM John T. Raines III\n\nMilitary unit\n\nThe Army National Guard (ARNG) is an organized militia force and a federal military reserve force of the United States Army. It is simultaneously part of two different organizations: the Militia of the United States (consisting of the ARNG of each state, most territories, and the District of Columbia), as well as the federal ARNG, as part of the National Guard as a whole (which includes the Air National Guard). It is divided into subordinate units stationed in each state or insular area, responsible to their respective governors or other head-of-government.[2]\n\nThe Guard's origins are usually traced to the city of Salem, Massachusetts, in 1636. That year a regiment of militia drilled for the first time to defend a multi-community area within what is now the United States.[3][a]\n\nActivation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ARNG operates under Title 10 of the United States Code when under federal control, and Title 32 of the United States Code and applicable state laws when under state control. It may be called up for active duty by the state or territorial governors to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, as well as civil disorder.[2] The District of Columbia Army National Guard is a federal militia, controlled by the President of the United States with authority delegated to the Secretary of Defense, and through him to the Secretary of the Army.[5]\n\nMembers or units of the ARNG may be ordered, temporarily or indefinitely, into United States service.[6][7] If mobilized for federal service, the member or unit becomes part of the U.S. ARNG, which is a reserve component of the U.S. Army.[8][9][10] Individuals volunteering for active federal service may do so subject to the consent of their governors.[11] Largely on the basis of a 1990 U.S. Supreme Court decision, governors generally cannot veto involuntary activations of individuals or units for federal service, either for training or national emergency.[12]\n\nThe President may also call up members and units of the ARNG, in its status as the militia of the several states, to repel invasion, suppress rebellion, or enforce federal laws.[13] The Army National Guard is one of two organizations administered by the National Guard Bureau, the other being the Air National Guard. The Director of the ARNG is the head of the organization, and reports to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. Because the ARNG is both the militia of the several states and a federal reserve component of the Army, neither the Chief of the National Guard Bureau nor the Director of the ARNG \"commands\" it. This operational command authority is performed in each state or territory by the State Adjutant General, and in the District of Columbia by the Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard when a unit is in its militia status. While under federal activation, the operational command authority is transferred to the commanders of the unified combatant commands, who command all U.S. forces within their area of responsibility. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau and the Director of the ARNG serve as the channel of communications between the Department of the Army and the ARNG in each state and territory, and administer federal programs, policies, and resources for the National Guard.[14]\n\nThe ARNG's portion of the president's proposed federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018 is approximately $16.2 billion to support an end strength of 343,000, including appropriations for personnel pay and allowance, facilities maintenance, construction, equipment maintenance and other activities.[15]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Militia (United States)\n\nUnits and formations\n\n[edit]\n\nDeployable Army units are organized as Table of organization and equipment (TOE) organizations or modified table of organization and equipment (MTOE) organizations. Non-deployable units, such as a state's joint force headquarters or regional training institutes are administered as Table of distribution and allowance (TDA) units.[16]\n\nCommands\n\n[edit]\n\n46th Military Police Command (MI ARNG)\n\n135th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) (AL ARNG)\n\n167th Sustainment Command (Theater) (AL ARNG)\n\n184th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) (MS ARNG)\n\n263rd Army Air and Missile Defense Command (SC ARNG)\n\nDivisions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to many deployable units which are non-divisional, the Army National Guard's deployable units include eight infantry divisions.[17] These divisions, their subordinate brigades or brigades with which the divisions have a training oversight relationship, and the states represented by the largest units include:[18]\n\nArmy Aviation Magazine wrote on 31 March 2021 that \"The ARNG is pressing forward with the Division Alignment for Training (DIV AFT) effort. The DIV AFT intent is to enhance leader development and training readiness through codified relationships across echelons and states to develop combat capable division formations for large scale combat operations. The Director, ARNG.. recently convened a DIV AFT Initial Planning Conference to clarify unit alignments for all eight ARNG Division Headquarters and synchronize activities that will facilitate unity of effort between Division Headquarters and aligned for training States.\"[19]\n\n28th Infantry Division (PA ARNG)\n\n2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (PA ARNG)\n\n56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team (PA

began a training and readiness initiative that aligned some Army brigades with National Guard division headquarters, and some National Guard brigades with Army division headquarters. Among others, this program included the National Guard's 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team becoming affiliated with the Army's 10th Mountain Division[21] and the National Guard's 1st Battalion, 143rd Infantry Regiment affiliating with the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team.[22] In addition, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division began an affiliation with the National Guard's 36th Infantry Division.[23]\n\n48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (GA ARNG), associated with 3rd Infantry Division\n\n1st Battalion (Airborne), 143rd Infantry Regiment (TX ARNG), associated with 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team\n\n1st Battalion, 151st Infantry Regiment (IN ARNG), associated with 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division\n\n840th Engineer Company (TX ARNG), associated with 36th Engineer Brigade\n\n249th Transportation Company (TX ARNG), associated with 1st Cavalry Division Sustainment Brigade\n\n1176th Transportation Company (TN ARNG), associated with 101st Sustainment Brigade\n\n1245th Transportation Company (OK ARNG), associated with 1st Cavalry Division Sustainment Brigade\n\n2123rd Transportation Company (KY ARNG), associated with 101st Sustainment Brigade\n\nArmy units partnering with Army National Guard headquarters include:\n\n5th Engineer Battalion, associated with 35th Engineer Brigade (MO ARNG).\n\nBy state\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: State Adjutant General\n\nThe Army and Air National Guard in each state are headed by the State Adjutant General. The Adjutant General (TAG) is the de facto commander of a state's military forces, and reports to the state governor.[24]\n\nLegacy units and formations\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral units have been affected by Army National Guard reorganizations. Some have been renamed or inactivated. Some have had subordinate units reallocated to other commands. A partial list of inactivated major units includes:\n\n26th Infantry Division, inactivated 1 September 1993.[25]\n\n27th Infantry Division, reorganized as 27th Armored Division, 1 February 1955. (See below.)[26]\n\n27th Armored Division, inactivated 1 February 1968.[27]\n\n30th Armored Division, inactivated 1 December 1973. (See below.)[28]\n\n30th Infantry Division, inactivated 4 January 1974.[29]\n\n31st Infantry Division, inactivated 14 January 1968. Units allocated to 30th Armored Division.[30]\n\n32nd Infantry Division, inactivated 1 December 1967.[31]\n\n33rd Infantry Division, inactivated 1 February 1968.[32]\n\n37th Infantry Division, inactivated 15 February 1968.[33]\n\n39th Infantry Division, inactivated 1 December 1967.[34]\n\n40th Armored Division, inactivated 29 January 1968.[35]\n\n41st Infantry Division, inactivated 1 January 1968.[36][37]\n\n43rd Infantry Division, inactivated 16 December 1967.[38]\n\n44th Infantry Division, inactivated 10 October 1954.[39]\n\n45th Infantry Division, inactivated 1 February 1968.[40]\n\n46th Infantry Division, inactivated 1 February 1968.[41]\n\n47th Infantry Division, inactivated 10 February 1991.[42]\n\n48th Armored Division, inactivated 29 January 1968.[43]\n\n49th Armored Division, inactivated 1 May 2004; reflagged as the 36th Infantry Division.[44][45]\n\n50th Armored Division, inactivated 1 September 1993.[46]\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nUpon the creation of the United States Air Force in 1947, the National Guard Bureau was organized into two divisions; Army National Guard and Air National Guard. Each were headed by a major general who reported to the chief of the National Guard Bureau. The head of the Army National Guard was originally established as the chief of the Army Division at the National Guard Bureau. The position was downgraded to brigadier general in 1962 due to force reduction. It was renamed to Director of the Army National Guard and elevated back to major general in 1970. The position was later elevated to the rank of lieutenant general in 2001. The Army National Guard is also authorized a deputy director which was originally established as a brigadier general office in 1970. It was elevated to the rank of major general in 2006.\n\nThe director of the Army National Guard oversees a staff which aids in planning and day-to-day organization and management. In addition to a chief of staff, the Director's staff includes several special staff members, including a chaplain and protocol and awards specialists. It also includes a primary staff, which is organized as directorates, divisions, and branches. The directorates of the Army National Guard staff are arranged along the lines of a typical American military staff: G-1 for personnel; G-2 for intelligence; G-3 for plans, operations and training; G-4 for logistics; G-5 for strategic plans, policy and communications; G-6 for communications; and G-8 for budgets and financial management.\n\nList of chiefs and directors\n\n[edit]\n\nNo. Commander Term Portrait Name Took office Left office Term length Chiefs of the Army Division at the National Guard Bureau 1Major General\n\nRaymond H.
