He reminds the readership of Military Images that smaller magazines like these provide a more substantial glimpse into topics and issues and that the continuation of small subject magazines requires the financial support of those who enjoy and read them. The editor also announces a new feature called “Uniforms and History” by Mike McAfee, West Point Museum curator and frequent contributor to Military Images.\n\nMail Call (p. 3)\n\nReaders send in letters commending the magazine for past issues, contribute observations, and make some corrections. For example, Don Troiani (noted Civil War artist) identifies an image identified as a Confederate in the May/June 1988 issue as a French officer of the line between 1852 and 1867.\n\nPassing in Review (pp. 4-5)\n\nSeven different publications are presented for review by the readership, beginning with Gray Victory by Robert Skimkin, who wrote a novel changing the result of one battle which leads to a change in the end of the war. Next is Flags of the Confederacy: An Illustrated History by Devereaux D. Cannon, Jr. provides background on the development of the colors used by the Confederacy, including those that were eventually not adopted, as well as flags used by different states and major service branches. A Creek Warrior for the Confederacy: the Autobiography of Chief G.W. Grayson, edited by W. David Baird, was originally a family memoir which also provides insight into the Creek engagements in Indian Territory after his posting there as a Confederate officer in 1862. They Fought for the Union by Francis Lord is a reprint of the 1960 Stackpole book that summarized all aspects of the Federal army in a single volume. Next is Danger Beneath the Waves: A History of the Confederate Submarine H.L. Hunley by James E. Kloeppel, which provides some clarity to the myths surrounding the clash between the Hunley and the U.S.S. Housatonic, the first submarine to sink a surface vessel. War So Terrible: Sherman and Atlanta by James Lee McDonough and James Pickett Jones provides interesting analysis on the fighting and the leadership of both sides of this major campaign; the appendix provides insight into Margaret Mitchell’s depiction of the fighting in Atlanta, and the authors agree she did due diligence to the historical record. The edited and translated reprint of We Were the Ninth, prepared by Frederick Trautman, provides insight into the German-speaking 9th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment. It is not a traditional unit history based on official reports, but recollections of many of the men who fought in that unit through the end of their enlistment in 1864, when they decided to return home.\n\nChasseur, Zouave, Marine: The Incredible Career of John Rapier of Louisiana vignette by David M. Sullivan (pp. 6-7)\n\nJohn L. Rapier, who enlisted as part of the Louisiana Foot Rifles in April 1861 at the age of 18, had indeed an incredible military career. He began as a chasseur-a-pied, being sent to Richmond after the fighting at First Manassas in September 1861, spending the winter in Fairfax Court House, before moving to the Peninsula and taking part in the fighting at Seven Pines where he was promoted to sergeant major. After being injured at Frayser’s Farm, his unit was reorganized as Coppen’s Zouaves and went on to fight at Second Manassas, Harper’s Ferry, and Sharpsburg; they were renamed the Confederate States Zouave Battalion and Rapier earned a promotion to first lieutenant of Company B. But as the unit went into a defensive position around Richmond, Rapier requested and was given permission to join the Confederate States Marine Corps with the rank of second lieutenant with Company A at Drewry’s Bluff, eventually transferring to Company D, CSMC, at Mobile, Alabama. He was captured when Farragut’s fleet sailed into Mobile Bay, but was able to escape and return to Confederate territory by returning to his family home in Union-held New Orleans. Rapier was given command of the C.S.S. Morgan, which he held until the end of the war.\n\nThe Tennessee Bugle Boy: Nathan Dozier of Dibrell’s Brigade vignette by Mike Miner (p. 8)\n\nThe images here of Nathan Dozier, Private in the 4th Tennessee Cavalry in a ninth-plate tintype, and George Dibrell, General in the Army of the Tennessee in the only known carte de visite of him in uniform were connected by their paths in war. Originally part of the horse artillery under Nathan Bedford Forrest, by the end of the war, Dozier was bugler for Dibrell and part of the party accompanying President Jefferson Davis in his flight from Richmond.\n\nA Watery Grave at Ball’s Bluff: A Tale of Two Massachusetts Officers vignette by Brian Pohanka (p. 9)\n\nReinhold Wesselhoeft and Alois Babo were both German-speaking immigrants to the United States, settling in New England. When the Civil War began, 1st Lieutenant Babo and 2nd Wesselhoeft had their images taken in a set of three cartes de visite showing them each individually and one of the two officers together. Both were attached to the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, and in October of 1861, found themselves under heavy Rebel fire during the Battle of Ball’s Bluff. Heavy losses of about 150 men included many who drowned; Babo appeared to be shot in the waters of the Potomac and was never recovered, while Wesselhoeft was seen to try and help Babo, his body was recovered downstream a few days later. The inscription on Wesselhoeft’s grave marker in Oak Hill Cemetery includes words to honor his friend who joined him in death.\n\nWhat’s Wrong with This Picture? photo analysis by Richard K. Tibbals (pp. 10-13)\n\nSometimes it’s the way uniforms were distributed. Sometimes it’s the photographer who puts an incorrect era prop in a soldier’s hands to enhance an image. Sometimes it’s an individualist, who is making his own statement by how he wears his uniform. And sometimes it’s total misinterpretation by today’s collectors. The nine images presented here are examples of some of these examples for readers to learn from.\n\nCaptain Mathew Nunnaly: Letters from the 11th Georgia Infantry vignette by Keith Bohannon (pp. 14-15)\n\nAfter having spent about one semester at West Point, Cadet Mat Nunnaly returned home to Monroe, Georgia, taking his place as Captain in the “Walton Infantry” commanded by George T. Anderson. The vignette traces his service from arriving at Strasburg, Virginia, to be part of Jackson’s Army of the Shenandoah, to his writing home to his sister about the devastation he found on the battlefield the day after First Manassas, his unit having missed the battle due to a train accident. Mat was a popular captain, and after falling ill during the first winter of the war in Fairfax Court House, his recovery saw him back with the 11th Georgia in camp at Centreville. They fought their first fight at Dam No. 1, where they remained until called back to Richmond. It was then on to Second Manassas, which Mat missed due to illness, a small role in Fredericksburg as pickets, and then on to the siege of Suffolk, where Mat appeared to attract the ire of General John Bell Hood when his unit retreated under heavy Federal fire. There was no court of enquiry, as the 11th moved out again, towards the second invasion of the North. Captain Mat Nunnaly was killed during the fighting at the Rose Woods and the Wheatfield at Gettysburg, and his remains were brought home to Monroe. The family used an image of Capt. Nunnaly to have a marble monument made; the only difference between the two is the belt buckle, which is of unknown type in the photograph.\n\nScoundrels from New York and Philadelphia: A Look at New Jersey’s Zouave Regiments unit history by Joseph G. Bilby (pp. 16-24)\n\nSixteen different photographic images and one engraving accompany this article that traces the two Zouave regiments from New Jersey that had long-term service during the Civil War. The 33rd (Mindill’s Zouaves) and the 35th (Cladek’s Zouaves) were both made up of toughs from New York and Philadelphia who were after the $300 bounty offered before the Federal draft was set in place in New Jersey during the summer and fall of 1863. Competent officers mixed with some hard-to-control troops made for a colorful history of each unit. Both took part in Sherman’s March on Atlanta, with the 33rd coming from XX Corps and the 35th coming from XVI Corps, consistently following Joe Johnston’s Confederates through Georgia, and then taking on John Bell Hood’s soldiers as well. The 33rd New Jersey was one of the first units to enter Savannah, while the 35th New Jersey were sent to Port Royal, South Carolina. The article provides some excerpts from some of the men, giving insight on how these rough men tried to get out of their service, what kind of private property they confiscated on their way from “Atlanta to the Sea,” and how they saw themselves as they marched victorious through the streets of the nation’s capital.\n\nUniforms and History (p. 25)\n\nThis first installment of “Uniforms and History” features the 9th New York Volunteer Infantry (Hawkins’ Zouaves) who served from 1861 to 1863, when they were reorganized as the 17th for the remainder of the war. Like many Zouave units, they were heavily influenced by Elmer Ellsworth’s traveling Zouave Cadets who came to New York in 1860. They did not wear red pants, but narrower blue Zouave pants and sparsely trimmed jackets without tambeaux, as shown in the image that accompanies the article; a detailed description of the Hawkins’ Zouave uniform is provided. Many of their officers had military experience, which gave the unit a favorable edge. They first fought at Forts Hatteras and Clark, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and became the provost guard at Fortress Monroe.\n\nStragglers (pp. 27-31)\n\nChildren dressed in the garb of the Zouave, complete with rifles, in a cabinet card image is one of several different submissions that make up the “Stragglers” feature. Others include a carte de visite that features an excellent view of the M1855 pistol-carbine, two different ninth-plate tintype of Joseph and James Cochrane, brothers who served on the U.S.S. Wabash during the Civil War, as well as two very clear sixth-plate tintypes of unidentified soldiers are some of the other images, including a carte de visite image of a sailor with some Burnside-type sideburns.\n\nBack Image\n\nA fine half-plate tintype of a soldier in the 127th New York Infantry shows he is prepared for winter duty.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. XXVII, No. 6\n\n(40 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover image\n\nAn image from the Roy Mantle collection pictures a youthful federal gunner posed next to a cannon.\n\nTable of Contents (p. 1)\n\nEditor’s Desk and Mail Call (p. 2)\n\nThe editor welcomes back to contributors to the pages of the magazine, Donald Bates Sr. and Ted Karle, and shares plans for the remaining issues of the year. A letter from Mike Fitzpatrick suggests that the soldier identified as Elzi Benson on page 34 of the March/April 2006 issue may be Eli Benson of the 7th Georgia Infantry.\n\nPassing in Review (pp. 3-4)\n\nTwo books are recommended: Burning Rails As We Pleased: The Civil War Letters of William Garrigues Bentley, 104th Ohio Volunteer Infantry (McFarland & Company), edited by Barbara Bentley Smith and Nina Bentley Baker, and The Civil War In Maryland: An Exhibit of Rare Photographs (Toomey Press), by Ross J. Kelbaugh.\n\nThey Were at Gettysburg: Images From the Collection of Donald Bates Sr. (pp. 5-11)\n\nA total of seven identified Union tintypes are pictured, and each includes a sketch of the soldier’s military service. They include Maj. Gardner Walker of the 1st Massachusetts Infantry, 1st Lt. Moses Lyman Jr. of the 15th Vermont Infantry, Col. Elijah Walker of the 4th Maine Infantry, Pvt. Francis Quinn of the 40th New York Infantry, Corp. Henry G. Taylor of the 146th New York Infantry, Sgt. Ezra Brown of the 4th Michigan Infantry and Pvt. William Marshall of the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry,\n\nThree Years with the Eighty-Third Pennsylvania by Theodore J. Karle (pp. 12-13)\n\nWilliam Lawrence hoped for some action when he enlisted in the 83rd Pennsylvania Infantry in 1861. He may have got more than he bargained when he was wounded at the Battle of Gaines’ Mill in June 1862 and again at Little Round Top during the July 1863 Battle of Gettysburg. He survived the war, became successful in business and died in 1919.\n\nPistol Packers by Mike Fitzpatrick (pp. 14-20)\n\nThe author surveys seven guns, each illustrated with a modern photograph of the weapon and a corresponding image of a soldier with a gun of the same make and model. Included is the Colt 1860 Navy and William Henry Harrison Hussey of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry, the Colt 1860 Army and a cavalry trooper, the Colt 1851 1st Model and an infantry corporal, the Colt 3rd Model and John Smith of an unidentified regiment likely connect to Leavenworth, Kan., a Whitney 2nd Model Navy and a cavalry trooper, a Remington Beals Army and a Union soldier and an Allen and Wheelock Sidehammer .31 Caliber Belt Model and a federal infantryman.\n\nShirt Tales by Mike Fitzpatrick (p. 21)\n\nA short history of the army shirt includes basic information about the essential garment. Three portraits of Union soldiers illustrate the text.\n\n“Straight Shooters:” U.S. Army & National Guard Marksmen of the Post Civil War Era 1880-1900 by Donald W. Harpold (pp. 22-27)\n\nA survey of 17 images from the author’s collection begins with an overview that explains, “The last twenty years of the 19th century saw the United States Army and the state National Guard formations place a considerable emphasis on marksmanship. This ushered in an era of shooting competitions pitting the best army marksmen against one another in ‘shoots’ designed to crown the best of the best.” What follows is portraits of some of the marksmen, almost all wearing medals that mark their individual achievements.\n\nPainted Backdrops and More (pp. 28-29)\n\nA survey of seven real photo post cards from the Brent Musser Jr. collection feature a variety of backdrops with soldiers that include Robert C. Shappell, Frank B. Haines, Brice Abner and Herman McGovern.\n\nUniforms & History by Michael J. McAfee (pp. 30-31)\n\nIn the “Boston Light Artillery,” McAfee provides a short history of this artillery unit, also known as Cook’s Battery. The text is illustrated with four images including an 1861 stereoview of the officers and men, a sixth-plate ambrotype of Maj. Asa M. Cook, Ormand F. Sims and Robert L. Sawin.\n\nStragglers (pp. 32-36)\n\nA total of 8 portraits include Pvt. John T. Ellis of the 2nd Indiana Cavalry, Col. Alexander Pennington of the 3rd New Jersey Cavalry, Capt. Charles S. Reisinger of the 150th Pennsylvania Infantry, a Confederate volunteer with the letters J and G on his cap and an outdoor image that owner Bruce Bonfield believes could be a band of Confederate guerrillas. Also pictured are photos of Pvt. Paul Zink, who served in the 58th Ohio Infantry during the Civil War and his son, Pvt. Charles E.

Tuttle of the “Hibriten Guards” of Company F, 26th Regiment North Carolina Troops, who was killed at Bristoe Station in October 1863.\n\nEditor’s Desk (p. 1)\n\nThe editor introduces the tenth year of publication of Military Images, provides a hint of the content of upcoming issues, and discusses his effort to protect the “MonsterMaul” proposed at Manassas by returning his wife’s credit cards with a letter of explanation to the main retailers involved.\n\nMail Call (p. 3)\n\nLetters of congratulations abound in this edition, with some readers providing bits of additional information about some past images, and with one reader providing a detailed explanation of why the publication resonates with her, such as the personal touches provided by vignettes, letters, and images that show the grit and resolve of the soldiers’ images.\n\nPassing in Review (p. 4)\n\nSix different publications are given rather short reviews; one is given longer treatment, beginning with Gettysburg Battlefield Commanders; A Photographic Guide by Blake Magner and Michael Cavanaugh. Although many people interested in the Civil War are aware of what the major commanders looked like, this book provides images of lesser-known and lower-ranking officers in a format this “illustrated organizational chart.” Catalogue of Civil War Photographers: a Listing of Civil War Photographer’s Imprints was compiled by George F. Witham; this first edition included over 1700 listings of photographers and the backmarks they used in their work organized by name and location. Following editions are anticipated as Witham had collected many more after publication. Next is the lengthier review of Joe Brown’s Army: the Georgia State Line, 1862-1865 by William Harris Bragg. He investigates the contradiction between centralized Confederate government as pursued by Jefferson Davis and the grip on individual states’ rights held by Georgia’s governor Joseph Brown. Bragg’s book tells the story of the military units organized to protect the railroad lines in northern Georgia, known as the Georgia State Line, which provides great detail about the men involved in the units involved. Next is Battle Cry of Freedom, the Civil War Era by James McPherson, which is part of a larger series of ten volumes. McPherson takes all the available assessments of the Civil War and provides insightful and original analysis that needs to be part of every Civil War enthusiast’s collection. Author Walter A. Clark originally wrote Under the Stars and Bars: Service with the Oglethorpe Infantry of Augusta, Georgia in 1900; this reprint is significant as this unit fought with the Army of the Tennessee, not the Army of Northern Virginia. The Civil War Campaign Medal was edited by John M. Carroll, describes the Congressional medal that was authorized in 1907, many years after the end of the war, which might explain why only 554 medals were issued after soldiers would apply. Finally, Custer and His Times: Book Three was edited by G.J.W. Urwin and Roberta Fagan who compiled fifteen articles by academics about Custer and his era, including an extensive bibliography of sources written between 1983 and 1985.\n\n“Tha Kill So meny of us”: the 26th North Carolina Regiment at Gettysburg unit history by Greg Mast (pp. 5-11)\n\nBeginning with a brief background of the 26th North Carolina covering its formation and eventual integration into the brigade of Henry Heth, the article traces the action that involved the regiment during the Battle of Gettysburg. The author uses excerpts from several soldier memoirs as well as nine images of members of the 26th (with short biographies), and one map illustrating the assault by Pettigrew and Brockenbrough on July 1. At the end of the day, the 26th North Carolina Regiment could only muster 216 men. The next day, the band of the regiment played to cheer the remaining soldiers, but on July 3, the 26th was led by Brigadier General J. Johnston Pettigrew as part of Pickett’s Charge. Three officers and 67 “muskets” returned.\n\nThe Blue Springs Images photo analysis by Scott Cross (pp. 12-15)\n\nThe author ties five different outdoor images showing scenes such as “Division of IV Corps, Blue Springs, Tenn.,” which shows the division of Grose’s Brigade set in order of battle, to a photographer named Sweeney from Cleveland, Tennessee, who was in that area in April, 1864. Images include Companies B and C of the 184th Illinois Infantry and the 9th and 36th Indiana.\n\nThe Marine Finds a Mate or, “Ain’t Love Grand” humor by John Stacey (pp. 16-17)\n\nA series of postcards copyrighted in 1909 by Theodor Eismann of New York show the progression of a romance between a Marine and a young lady. Beginning with “The First-Meeting” and ending with “After the Ceremony,” the five cards shown are possibly only part of the tinted series printed in Germany. The cards were addressed to a Miss Ada Y. Miller by J.P.M., but were never mailed.\n\nThe Well-Accoutered Soldier: Army Uniforms of the Civil War, Part IX by Michael J. McAfee (pp. 18-24)\n\nTwenty-one different images illustrate the accoutrements required by various types of soldiers in different roles as described in the introduction. Waist belts and shoulder belts that held the cartridge and cap boxes needed to fire weapons, bayonets, side arms, haversacks, knapsacks, and canteens were all among the equipment that frequently was not adequately imaged in total by photographers of the era, unless they happened to be near a camp. Officers had waist belts for their side arms and sabers. The images include the accoutrements required by musicians, including cavalry buglers, and other “quasi-military” groups. Each image includes a caption that highlights unique details and provides identification of the soldier or at least his unit.\n\nHistory, Photography & the Civil War: a critical bibliography of books for buffs by Book Review Editor Philip Katcher (pp. 25-27)\n\nFrom the advent of the daguerreotype in 1839, people have invested in having their images reproduced, usually for personal reasons. It was not until much later that the photograph in its many forms became to be considered an important form of primary documentation. When considering the Civil War image, having a reliable source to reference when trying to date or place an image is important for collectors, historians, and others. This article outlines and critiques the several essential volumes that those interested in Civil War photography should consider. Some are more specific (such as Cities Under the Gun: Images of Nashville and Chattanooga by James A. Hoobler) while others attempt to cover the entirety of the era (The Photographic History of the Civil War edited in volumes by Francis T. Miller). This comprehensive bibliography should assist readers in finding the best source of information to meet their needs.\n\nStragglers (pp. 29-30)\n\nThe first page of contributed images focuses on horses: one “riding” his cavalryman, while the other shows a National Guard officer mounted on his steed in about 1881 with his servant rides a donkey. Other images include a “Wide-Awake” boy, who campaigned for Abraham Lincoln in 1860 with a distinctive uniform consisting of rain cape, pole with whale oil lamp and flag, and a small kepi-type cap. Crowds appearing upon the news of Lee’s surrender at Appomattox are shown in a carte de visite by J.B. Hazelton of Montrose, Pennsylvania. One contributor asks for help in identifying garrison troops in his quarter-plate tintype that appears to be of the Civil War era, however the hats worn appear to be from the 1870s.\n\nBack Image\n\nThree different images are presented: two Philadelphians in an albumen print, two first lieutenants from about 1855 in a quarter-plate daguerreotype, and five men in a quarter-plate ruby ambrotype, some in uniform, some not, but all with cigars.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. IX, No. 6\n\n(32 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover image\n\nThe image of “Capt. Sam. J. Richardson” from the Independent Company of Texas Cavalry, complete with jaguar skin trousers with “conchos” (ball buttons) down the seams and matching holsters greets the reader of this issue of Military Images.\n\nEditor’s Desk (p. 1)\n\nThe editor introduces the issue as the first “all Confederate” issue of the magazine, thanks to the many submissions of Rebel images by readers of MI. He also warns about another attempt to reduce the Manassas battlefield and encourages readers to contribute to the fund being raised to fight commercial encroachment of the battle site.\n\nMail Call (p. 3)\n\nLetters to the editor include identifications of soldiers in images from past issues, including more information on Private Edwin F. Jemison, whose image is often used to embody the youth of the soldiery in the Civil War. The collection of images belonging to Michael McAfee in the previous issue is also lauded.\n\nPassing in Review (pp. 4-5)\n\nThis issue features five reviews of new publications and alerts readers to recent reprints of older works they may be interested in acquiring. The first review is Forts Henry and Donelson: the Key to the Confederate Heartland by Benjamin Franklin Cooling. The author looks at the battles in their larger context of the whole war, critiques the first losses for the Confederacy as being due to lackluster generalship, and looks at the aftermath of the battles as well. Second is Gettysburg: The Second Day by Harry W. Pfanz. Lauded as a major work, the reviewer’s only complaint is that the book focuses only on the southern portion of the fighting under Longstreet and does not consider any of Ewell’s contributions. However the contribution to understanding of Gettysburg by this work is significant. Third is Judah P. Benjamin, the Jewish Confederate by Eli N. Evans; while the reviewer admits that a biography of Benjamin is a difficult task as he destroyed much of the documentation of his work for the Confederacy and did not write or discuss the war afterwards, he also outlines a number of factual errors that make this biography less than complete. The fourth book reviewed is A Generation on the March: the Union Army at Gettysburg by Edmund J. Raus, who provides a profile of all Federal units, identification of corps, commanders, origin, strength and losses, and the location of the unit monument on the Gettysburg field. The last new publication is entitled Lee’s Tarnished Lieutenant: James Longstreet and His Place in Southern History by William Garrett Piston, who attempts to analyze how Longstreet’s image declined in the years following Lee’s death and why it is unlikely to be resurrected by scholarship. The two reprintings noted are Yankee Blitzkrieg: Wilson’s Raid Through Alabama and Georgia by James Pickett Jones (1976) and Confederate Navy Chief: Stephen R. Mallory by Joseph T. Durkin as part of the “Classics in Maritime History” series published by the University of South Carolina Press.\n\nThe Whole World was Full of Smoke: Letters of J.A. Byers, 17th Mississippi Infantry edited by Hartman McIntosh (pp. 6-11)\n\nBorn in Alabama, the soldier in the ambrotype is a handsome man with a bit of a blonde cowlick, and a prolific writer of letters, many of which are printed in this feature. Including one copy showing a cross-hatched letter (where paper was saved by writing over again at 90 degrees), Private John Alemeth Byers left for Virginia with his “Panola Vindicators” from Mississippi at the age of 25. The eleven letters he wrote as a member of Company H of the 17th Mississippi Infantry were written to Sister, Father, and Uncle, and trace his journey through the war from First Manassas (when he was too ill to fight), to Balls Bluff, to the Peninsula, where he starts requesting that the family send him Gilbert (a slave) to be a body servant for him. Wounded in the hand at Second Manassas, he writes again during the February after Fredericksburg, and tells the family that he and Gilbert are doing alright in the cold. The next letter is from a year after Gettysburg, where Byers took part in fighting with Barksdale’s Brigade in the Peach Orchard, being left behind severely wounded when the Confederates returned to Virginia; he was eventually sent home on furlough once returned to the Confederacy. He sees Gilbert at this time, who seems to be working on his own as a camp cook. The letters continue from around Petersburg and then on to the Shenandoah Valley, when Byers’ unit is moved in the fall of 1864. His letters provide an interesting glimpse into the life of a Confederate soldier, as he makes comments on people known to his family, requests specific types of clothing in almost each letter, and wishes for food from home as well as more letters. The last letter is from one of his commanding officers, Capt. Jesse C. Wright, who talks about “Almuth” as a valued member of the company and describes his death as quick; his belongings were to be forwarded with Gilbert as “soon as the opportunity presents itself.”\n\nRebels in Halifax: Rare Images of Confederates in Canada from the collection of Al Fleming (p. 12)\n\nThey are not identified, but the men posing before the second Confederate national flag had two cartes de visite with backmarks identifying them as being made by W. Chase in Halifax. They may be escaped prisoners of war or perhaps the St. Alban’s attackers? More information would need to be found to know for certain.\n\nVignette: Battery Guidon Bearer, Pvt. Louis Sherfesee, Hart’s South Carolina Artillery by John Bigham (pp. 13-14)\n\nNot many guidon bearers, North or South, survived the entirety of the war, but the subject of this vignette is an exception. With the words “Hampton’s Legion” and “Washington Artillery” sewn on it, the banner that Private Sherfesee carried as well as his photographic image from June 1861 are presented along with a brief history of his Civil War record. He was part of Hart’s Battery and described being sent out to attract the fire of Federal troops at Freestone Point on the Potomac. When Hampton’s Legion was broken up, Sherfesee was with Hampton’s cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart; the damage to the guidon was sustained at the cavalry battle at Brandy Station in 1863. His service ended with the Battle of Bentonville in 1865.\n\nWounded & Captured at Gettysburg: An account by Sgt. William Jones, 50th Georgia Infantry edited by Keith Bohannon (p. 15)\n\nThe vignette begins with a description of the wounded soldier arriving at his home plantation, not being recognized by his own mother. Sgt. William Moore Jones was missing a leg and spent four months of incarceration by the Union at Point Lookout. The households of two plantations, his and his uncles, turn out to welcome him home, and after recounting his service at Second Manassas, South Mountain, Antietam, and Chancellorsville, the article begin with the soldier’s own words describing the action of Semmes’ brigade, probably fighting with Kershaw’s South Carolinians on the Second Day at Gettysburg. He describes his original wound, how he insisted on surgeons from his own regiment to be the ones to remove his foot, and the fact that he was captured when it was decided that his portion of the ambulance train on the way to Williamsport would not be able to sustain a crossing of the Potomac. His description of how the Union physician who eventually came to his assistance dealt with gangrenous wounds is horrific but spellbinding, and it was this one dedicated Union surgeon who saved his life. After his exchange, Sgt. Jones was hospitalized at Chimborazo in Richmond before making his way home, arriving in mid-April of 1864.\n\nSoldiers of the Southland compiled by Daniel Brogan (pp. 16-27)\n\nA total of forty different images of Confederates makes up this pictorial article, from a rare antebellum daguerreotype of a South Carolina firefighter to before-and-after-the-war images of the same Confederate officer. Coming from a number of different collectors, this compilation shows the wide variety of men and uniforms that represented the South in the Civil War. One soldier is identified as “E. Cunningham, May 1861, aged 14,” showing some of the youth involved in the war. Another image is of Florida Captain Robert Knickmeyr and his wife, presenting the impact the war had on families as well as the two ambrotypes of Louisiana brothers “Uncle Jimmy Harris” and “Uncle T. Harris” who were both identified as “brothers of Grandma Finley” in the inscription on the reverse. Many of the soldiers are identified, but just as many are not, leaving the reader to wonder about the fates of the men presented in these images.\n\nVignettes: Five Tarheels by Greg Mast (pp. 28-31)\n\nEach of the images in this feature includes a brief biography of each soldier, only one of which appears to have survived the Civil War. Included are a quarter-plate ambrotype of Pvt. George Washington Lyon (killed July 1, 1863 at Gettysburg), a ninth-plate ambrotype of Pvt. James Wilkerson (killed at Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863), a sixth-plate ambrotype of Pvt. William T. Blanton (died of typhoid fever on June 30, 1862), a ninth-plate ambrotype of possibly Maberry Marvin Miller (paroled at Petersburg on June 26, 1865), and a carte de visite image of Pvt. Robert Jones (died of smallpox on October 20, 1863), the image of which may be a copy of a hard photographic image.\n\nBack Image\n\nA Rebel looks out from under his forage cap in a ninth-plate ambrotype found in Galveston, Texas.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. XXIX, No. 1\n\n(48 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover image\n\nA half-plate ambrotype from the Guy DeMasi collection pictures Surg.

Vaughan.\n\nMedical Images of the Civil War Period by Dr. Gordon E. Dammann, D.D.S., F.I.C.D., F.A.C.D. (pp. 3-34)\n\nSubtitled “A Leading Collector Reminisces About Collecting Medical Images,” the author explains how photographs were originally not big on his list to acquire and how that changed when he became interested in these “capsules of history.” He continues to discuss some of the most memorable images in his collection. What follows Dammann’s introduction is 116 photographs gleaned from the author’s collection and others.

As chaplain of the 5th New York Infantry (Duryee’s Zouaves), Winslow saw much of the war. In 1863 he left the regiment to become Sanitary Inspector of the Army of the Potomac under the auspices if the United States Sanitary Commission.

McAfee. These include a member of the 146th New York Volunteer Infantry with its distinctive uniform, a member from the 3rd Massachusetts Cavalry, a ship’s boy with his mascot, an unidentified Rhode Islander, and a New York Zouave.\n\nEditor’s Desk (p. 1)\n\nThe editor lets the readership know that the Visitor Center at Gettysburg National Military Park is looking for images to be included in a mural entitled “Wall of Faces.” He also lets the readers know that the lawsuit Katz v. Gladstone that stemmed from a book review in “Passing in Review,” Vol. VII, No. 2 was settled as being without merit. The format of this special issue is introduced, and the editor lets the readers know that more Confederate images are on the way in future issues.\n\nMail Call (p. 2)\n\nLetters to the editor include a detailed drawing and description of a Minie ball medal similar to the “Massachusetts Mystery Medal” and the identification of an assumed foreign musket in “Stragglers” as an American model. There were also identifications of two Vermonters and a correction of the name of the drummer boy killed at Antietam (Charles E. King). One letter provided a rationale for why an image may show A.P. Hill in a naval type uniform in 1858.\n\nInterview with Mike McAfee (pp. 3-4)\n\nBeginning with a general interest as a child in things military to happening to find a job at the West Point Museum, the interview discusses how McAfee got interested in the collection of images. As he also works professionally as a museum curator, he has some advice for collectors who are looking for images now as opposed to when he began collecting in the 1960s. For example, he has very few if any Confederates in his collection as they have become rare and expensive, so he has focused more on Federal images. He also collects more general images as opposed to specific subjects and highly suggests protecting these “little bits of history” by using archival sleeves. While the images in this issue of MI are not necessarily his best, McAfee has provide a wide range of images for the enjoyment of the readership.\n\nPre-War Images (pp. 5-7)\n\nFour stereographic images, including an enlargement of one showing mounted New York Hussars in a parade begin this section of Mike McAfee’s collection of images. These outdoor scenes include the North Dock at West Point and a militia picnic. The ambrotypes included in this section include a member of a New York drill company, a militiaman who did not eventually serve in the Civil War, a New York militiaman wearing the regulation 1858 uniform and two militiamen in the Continental uniforms worn by some militia of the antebellum era.\n\nThe First Volunteers (pp. 8-11)\n\nTwenty images from McAfee’s collection show the different uniforms worn by those who were among the first to volunteer in the Civil War. This would include an image of the large blouse worn by Rhode Island light artillery units and the uniforms of the Collis and Rush Hawkins Zouave regiments. Many of the image subjects are identified, such as Brigadier General Benjamin Butler in the uniform of the Massachusetts militia unit he led. Another carte de visite from the collection is of Francis Brownell of the 11th New York (the “Ellsworth Zouaves”), who avenged the death of Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth in Virginia in 1861.\n\nCamp Life (pp. 12-15)\n\nMany of the fourteen images presented in this section of the issue are a combination of stereographs and cartes de visite that show the defenses outside of Washington, at Harper’s Ferry, and other camp sites. A few show different leaders outside of their own personal camps, such as the 1861 images of Captain Thomas Francis Meagher and Colonel Adolph von Steinwehr prior to Bull Run. The formal and informal posing of these images provide a glimpse into the early years of a Civil War camp.\n\nThe Troops (pp. 16-20)\n\nTwenty-four different images from the famous young drummer boy John Clem (who retired as a Brigadier General in 1916) to the bugler from the 1st New York Cavalry show something of the life of the Civil War enlisted man. There are variations in uniform, weaponry, types of service, and state of origin as well as in format of the images themselves.\n\nThe Officers (pp. 21-24)\n\nAll but one of the twenty officers presented in this collection of cartes de visite also show many different variations, from the lieutenant wearing all of his gear for his portrait and the cavalryman wearing Mexican spurs, to the clergyman wearing his simple black frock coat that typified his vocation. Two images are of European aristocracy, one of whom returned to his home country of Sweden once his service in the Federal army was at an end. Some of the officers survived, but some did not, as indicated in the image captions.\n\nStragglers (pp. 25-28)\n\nA number of unidentified soldiers are among the “Stragglers” with some wearing identifiable uniforms while others are completely unknown. One image is of a chasseur from the 83rd Pennsylvania Infantry, so identified on the back of the image by noted Civil War artist A.R. Waud. A few of the men, such as Hospital Steward George H. Thompson are unique images that do not easily fall into a category. Any information regarding these men would be appreciated by Mike McAfee.\n\nPassing in Review (pp. 29-31)\n\nTen different publications are included in this issue, with many of them being concise and to-the-point. First is a review of Brief History of the 30th Georgia Regiment by Augustus Adamson, an exact reprint of the 1912 publication of the same title. It includes some biographical information written later in their lives. Next is The Heavens Are Weeping: The Diaries of George R. Browder 1852-1866 edited by Richard Troutman. The reviewer warns that the cover of the book, which features the battleflag of the Army of Northern Virginia and two Union soldiers, is misleading as very little of the diary entries have anything to do with the Civil War directly. That being said, it does provide some insight into everyday life of the era. Third is Cities Under the Gun by James A Hoobler, and provides readers with images of Chattanooga and Nashville, Tennessee. The book makes some “then and now” comparisons and includes Corps of Engineers drawings or blueprints of some buildings. Similarly, Portraits of Conflict: a Photo History of Arkansas in the Civil War by Bobby Roberts and Carl Moneyhon provide a detailed regional history of the war in Arkansas, with many previously unpublished images. Confederate General Service Accoutrement Plates by Lon W. Keim, M.D. is an excellent volume for those collectors who would appreciate the detailed images and information about plates and buckles worn by Confederates, including some images of soldiers wearing the items. The next item for review is a film entitled The Civil War Soldier: The Infantryman, written and directed by Steve Tilson. A 24-minute videotape, it is an attempt to capture some of the work of living historians in VCR format, and provides basic background on Federal and Confederate soldiers; the reviewer provides some suggestions for future improvement to this relatively new way of imparting this kind of information. The Drums Would Roll by Thomas C. Railsback and John P. Langellier is an attempt to provide a pictorial history of U.S. Army bands on the frontier. The reviewer suggests that more attention to the selection and presentation of the images would greatly improve this work. Next is Illustrations of U.S. Military Arms 1776-1903 and Their Inspector’s Marks is a reproduction of the 1949 Bannerman’s Catalog and provides information relevant to arms collectors. The Art of Warfare in the Western World by Archer Jones begins with the Greeks and moves up to modern times, outlining the evolution of weapons systems, focusing on heavy and light infantry and heavy and light cavalry as well as a small section on naval development. A major work, the reviewer feels it is a significant research tool, although the treatment on the Civil War is brief and focuses on transportation methods. Finally, is Peter Newark’s work Sabre & Lance: An Illustrated History of Cavalry which the reviewer feels falls far short of the mark the title implies.\n\nBack Image\n\nFive additional images from the McAfee collection are included on the back cover as well. This includes a woman who may be a vivandiere, a Zouave, an unidentified soldier, and two unidentified couples.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. XXIX, No. 3\n\n(40 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover image\n\nA carte de visite of A.P.
