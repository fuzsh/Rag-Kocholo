        "text": "In addition, he was the major in command of the 5th at Antietam, Maryland. Promoted to colonel in 1862, he led the 5th at Groveton (as part of the Battle of Second Bull Run, Virginia). It was there that his regiment, in ten minutes, lost 297 men, including 124 killed, the greatest number of fatalities of any regiment during the Civil War. At times he commanded Sykes’ Division and a brigade. He was known as a flamboyant leader and a stern disciplinarian. On February 1, 1863, he wrote this report that is a history of the regiment:\n\nSir –\n\nIn compliance with circular from General Head Quarters, State of New York, Adjutant Generals Office, December 2nd, 1862 requesting a concise statement of the leading facts in the Military history of this Regiment since its entry into the service. The actions which it has taken part and the names of Officers and Privates who have particularly distinguished themselves, I have the honor to report as follows –\n\nI – the 5th regiment New York State Volunteers was organized in NYC under the auspices of Col. Abram Duryée in April 1861 – was sworn into the State Service and transported to Fort Schuyler, NY on the 23rd of April 1861. Recruiting for the regiment was conducted by Major Davies in NY – and the ranks were rapidly filled. On the 9th of May 1861 the regiment was mustered into the service of the US for two years – by Capt. Seymour U.S. Army.\n\nOn the 23rd of May having been recruited to nearly 800 strong, and having had considerable practice in drill under competent officers the regiment left Ft. Schuyler, NY in steamboats and landed at the foot of 14th St. East River marching from thence to the foot of North Moore St. embarking same day on board the Steamship Alabama for Fortress Monroe arriving there the 26th day of May 1861 landed the troops and went into bivouack (sic) on the farm of Col Segar. Established camp next day called Camp Butler and subsequently changed to Camp Hamilton.\n\nII- The regiment was employed making reconnaissances, scouting, etc, until the night of June 9th, 1861 when we marched from Camp at 10 o’clock p.m. on the road to Big Bethel reaching Little Bethel before daybreak driving in the Picket of the enemy and capturing the officer in command of the Rebel Picket Guard. In consequence of heavy firing in the rear marched back five miles __________the cause to be two of our own Regiments 3rd and 7th NY Vols. who were firing into each other by mistake – marched back to Big Bethel and engaged the enemy in front of their works, after being exposed to a hot fire for about two hours with but little opportunity from our position to return it effectively, losing 7 enlisted men killed, 12 wounded and 2 officers wounded, marched back to Camp, arriving there early in the evening of same day, for the ______loss of the first Battle of the War, the names of the officers and privates distinguishing themselves, etc. – I respectfully refer you to the Official report furnished you by Col Duryee when in command (as the report is stored with many other papers of the regiment in Baltimore, I cannot furnish you with a copy) –\n\nIII- The regiment remained at Camp Hamilton until July 1861 then embarked from Fortress Monroe on board the steamer Adelaide for Baltimore, arriving there next day, relieving the 18th regiment Penn. Vols. then on duty at Federal Hill.\n\nAt that time our position was not considered a sufficiently strong one as the element of Secession was not ___eminent throughout the City of Baltimore it was therefore suggested by Lt. Col. G.K. Warren (also Lt. for Engineers U.S. Army) that our camp should be fortified. The proposition was favorably received the War Dept. and the work was begun under the direction of Col. Warren on the 25th day of August 1861 which resulted in the structure of one of the strongest and handsomest earthworks built during the war. – The work stands upon a mound near the Centre of Baltimore and near the water, 82 feet high from tide water and enclose an area of seven acres, it comprises five Bastion, four elevated and one with subterranean passage with three bomb proof magazines. The parapet are mounted by six 8 inch Columbiads-fifteen 42 pounder smooth bore – twenty 32 pounder smooth bore and five 24 pounder flank howitzers, also two light 6 pound field guns and five 10 inch mortars were mounted within the Bastions. These guns range upon every point on the compass, completely commanding the City. A well was dug within the enclosure supplying good water, sufficient for a garrison of a thousand men. Almost the entire works was performed by the men of this regt. and under charge of the Company Officers, the bastions and curtains enclosing the fort was completed and the interior graded and drained by the 29th day of October-after which the guns and flank howitzers were put in position and the ammunition placed in the magazines.\n\nCol. Abram Duryée was promoted Brig. General of Volunteers Sept 4, 1861 and was succeeded by Lt Col. G.K. Warren to the command of the Regiment. The regiment remained in tents until the 5th day of January at which time the Barracks were completed and the Fort named Fort Federal Hill. On the 12th day of November 1861, six companies, A, B, C, E, F, I, under command of Col. G.K. Warren embarked on the steamboat Pocahontas and landed at Newtown on the eastern shore of Maryland, joined the troops under the command of General Lockwood, marched from Newtown to Oak Hall 16 miles. Encamped until the 20th at Mappsville 8 miles and next day marched to near Drummondstown 24 miles. Nov 22nd marched 16 miles and encamped hear Hadlocktown. Nov 24th marched to near Eastville 12 miles and encamped until December 3rd, marched to Pongateague 30 miles. Embarked next day on steamer Starr and arrived at Fort Federal Hill December 5th. During this campaign the enemy numbering about 6 or 7,000 evacuated their bastions as our troops advanced – General ______ and a quantity of large guns and small arms were captured by the 5th regiment. No attempt was made to arrest the progress of our march with the exception of placing obstructions in the roads &c.\n\nThe four companies remaining at the Fort under command of Major Hull began the carpenter work on the Officer’s quarters and men’s barracks which consisted of three buildings, one 195 Ft long 24 feet wide with Piazza 3 ft wide along the front, two stories high divided into 3 rooms, one on each floor, each 65ft long, the Building accommodating 600 men – One 181 ft long 24 ft wide two stories high, piazza along the front divided into eight rooms – two on each floor 65 feet long and two rooms on each end -25 ft long for kitchens and Band, the building accommodating 400 men. One building 195 ft long 20 ft wide and two stories high divided into 10 rooms on each floor. Each 16 x 20 ft long for officers’ quarters. These buildings were of the most substantial kind being of wood filled in with brick. Stables, QM store house, guard house, Tool House and ordinance Building were also built. Their work was done entirely by the men of the Regiment and completed in the early part of February. The regiment was made perfectly conversant with the light and heavy artillery drill, the manufacture of fixed ammunition, the care of siege and field guns, Light Infantry Rifle drill and the perfect use of Bayonet. A school was established for the instruction of Officers and non-commissioned officers and recitations were had daily in Infantry, Heavy and Light Artillery tactics, Bayonet exercise, discipline of troops, duty in garrison and revised army regulations. Company & battalion drills were had daily and at the time of the departure of the regiment for the Peninsula no troops could be better disciplined or more fully prepared for an active campaign. On the 19th of February 1862 four companies B, C, G & H were stationed at Fort Marshall, opposite Fort McHenry where they remained until the 26th day of March – then returning to Federal Hill.\n\nOn the 30th of March 1862, the regiment embarked on board the steamship “S.R. Spaulding” for the Peninsula, Va. arrived at Fortress Monroe on the morning of the 31st, disembarked and joined the Brigade of Regular Infantry under the command of General Sykes – Marched up the Peninsula and went into camp near Yorktown, Va. the 11th April 1862, a distance of 31 miles. The regiment was prominently engaged at the Siege of Yorktown and was assigned duty as siege artillerists erecting batteries, unloading transports and transporting and mounting the siege guns and mortars, manning and working the batteries for which service and coolness under heavy fire of the rebel guns, the regiment was complimented in orders by General Barry, Chief of artillery.\n\nAfter the evacuation of Yorktown, marched on May 9th, 1862 with the army towards Richmond and on 24th May 1862 encamped at old Church, Va. a distance 82 miles. May 26th Companies A, H G & I left camp and marched 8 miles to the Pamunkey River, destroyed the bridge over the river and thus cutting the communication of the enemy.\n\nMay 27th the regiment marched at 6 a.m. 12 miles to Hanover Court House, Va. Participating in that engagement, occupied the next day following the enemy and capturing a number of prisoners, arms, & c. May 29th made a reconnaissance under Colonel Warren to Ashland capturing a number of prisoners and returned to camp at Old Church same night. May 31st marched to camp near New Bridge, Va.\n\nLeft camp on the 13th June in pursuit of the rebel General Stewart who was reported as making a raid in our rear, marching to near Old Church bivouacked until 4th o’clock a.m. continued the march Tunstall Station arriving there a few hours after the enemy but too late to capture or prevent the burning and destroying of the road and buildings. The weather was exceedingly hot, the thermometer standing at 108 degrees and as it is impossible for Infantry to overtake Cavalry by following after them and on the same road, the men became completely exhausted as the march of 41 miles had been a forced one and very little water could be found, consequently the suffering was very severe.\n\nReturning to camp at New bridge the regiment was occupied in picket duty on the Chickahominey and working on the different bridges and batteries, until the 26th June when we marched towards Mechanicsville and remained in line of battle all night. June 27th fell back to Gaines Mills, Va. and remained in position until attacked by the enemy at noon. The Regiment was on the field and engaged with enemy until 8 o’clock p.m. who were successfully repulsed and driven from the field three different times at the point of the bayonet which honor I am sorry to see by the papers has been claimed by troops who were not within sight of battle. Our loss in killed was one officer and 37 enlisted men. – Wounded, 4 officers and 106 enlisted men. 14 missing nearly all of whom were supposed to be wounded and taken prisoner. The officers and men all behaved with coolness and bravery – I will not incorporate in this a repetition of Lt. Col. Duryea’s official report (see report attached). Crossed the Chickahominey same night and remained on guard at the river until 6 p.m. the following day, the marching all night passing through White Oak Swamp and at daylight reaching Charles City Cross Roads, taking up position in line of battle holding possession of the road to enable our army to complete the crossing of the swamp. When relieved by General Kearney’s Division next morning marched to Malvern Hill and posted the regiment on picket on the river road guarding the approach from Richmond. – Next day July 1st, 1862 the regt. was engaged in the battle of Malvern Hill, maintaining our picket at night. July 2nd withdrew from picket and covered the rear of the army. – On the march to Harrison’s Landing which place we reached in the afternoon same day. The Officers and men behaved with wonderful presence of mind under the heavy fire to which they had been exposed for so many days and considering the excitement, want of rest and food, of which they had been deprived for five days and nights, making long and forced marches of 30 miles through heavy and crowded roads and in a heavy rain storm, still a spirit of cheerfulness and perfect confidence was felt by all and to this I attribute the comparatively few cases of sickness after reaching our camp at Harrison’s Landing.\n\nWhile encamped at Harrison’s Landing continued to drill the Battalion and instruct those officers promoted from the ranks in place of those killed and resigned. Lt. Col. Duryea having returned North on sick leave and Major Hull having been ordered on recruiting service the command of the regt. was left to Captain Winslow. August 14th moved our position to Harrison’s Landing and marched to Newport News, Va., a distance of 64 miles.\n\nAugust 20th embarked on Steamship “Cahawba” for Aquia Creek, arriving there proceeded by railroad to Falmouth Station and bivouacked. August 23rd commenced the march towards Manassas proceeding along the Rappahannock, reached Warrenton junction on the 24th of August 1862 thence to Manassas Junction. The regiment numbered at this time 490 effective men. August 30th at daylight marched to Bull Run and participated in the engagement at one p.m. losing officers killed 3, wounded 7, enlisted men killed 75, wounded 152, and missing 63, nearly all of whom were supposed to be wounded and taken prisoner as we wee obliged to abandon the field.\n\nAt this battle the regiment was supporting three field batteries all of which were safely taken off the field before the regt. retired. Both Color Sergeant and the entire guard were killed in protecting the Color which were safely brought off (attached see Captain Winslow’s Official report) at dark marched to Centreville and bivouacked, remained at Centreville till 12 p.m. Sept. 1st leaving with the rear guard. – Sept. 2nd marched all day until 11 p.m. encamped at Halls hill in front of Washington – Sept.6th marched at 9 o’clock p.m. Tenallytown, Md. And proceeded with the army of the Potomac pursuing the enemy to Antietam Creek reaching that place in the evening of Sept. 15th – Sept.17th, at the battle of Antietam the regiment was engaged in supporting different batteries in the action. Sept. 19th followed the retreating rebel army to the Potomac when we remained on picket all night guarding Blackford’s Ford. Sept. 20th crossed the Potomac in line of battle as the enemy were in large force, recrossed immediately losing one sergeant wounded. Remained on picket on the North bank of the river until the morning of Sept.22 when I moved the regt. back half a mile and encamped near Sharpsburg, Md.- at this camp the recruits enlisted to take the places of those lost in battle and died of disease, were subjected to a thorough course of drill, the new men were of a superior class to those generally enlisting in the army. Sept. 30th, 1862 Colonel Warren was promoted to Brigadier General of Vols. and Lt. Col. Duryea promoted Colonel vice Warren.\n\nOn the 30th Oct. 1862, the regiment marched with the division to Harper’s Ferry, crossing into Loundon Valley and reaching Snicker’s Gap on Nov. 2, 1862. remained there on picket until the morning of Nov. 6th when we marched to Warrenton, encamped there 7 days and continued the march to near Falmouth, Va. encamped there Dec.11th.\n\nOn the 13th Dec. moved out of Camp going into position opposite Fredericksburg, remained in line of battle until the next day, then crossed the river passing through the city, formed in line of battle on the outskirts in front of the enemy’s works, remained in line of battle all night, most of the time under the fire of artillery and sharpshooters, losing two men wounded, at daylight moved into the city and placed the men under cover, remained under arms all day. That night and the next day going at night to the front on picket guard, posting two companies within 50 feet of the enemy’s works, the balance of the regt. worked all night building rifle pits to protect themselves from the shell of the enemy. Remained in there pits until 8 a.m. being among the last troops left on that side of the river, the balance of the army having crossed during the night. The entire regt. crossed without loss of a man and without the knowledge of the enemy, who continued fire at the objects we have placed in the rifle pits, until after the regt. had recrossed and the bridges removed, the 17th returned near Falmouth at which place the regt. was encamped. On Dec 4th, 1862, Col. Abram Duryée resigned by reason of sickness and Major Winslow promoted to fill the vacancy. The efficiency and discipline of both officers and men of this regt. is due to the untiring efforts and constant attention of Col. G.K. Warren.\n\nThroughout the entire campaign of the Peninsula and in Maryland he has proved himself to be an officer of superior military talent, his coolness and bravery on the different battle fields has won for him perfect confidence of his officers and men. All promotions have been made for gallant conduct under fire, therefore prefer not particularly mentioning the names of officers or soldiers who may have distinguished themselves, as with few exceptions all have acted in the parts assigned them with honor to themselves and credit to their Regt.\n\nGeneral George Sykes said of the 5th New York, also known as Duryée’s Zouaves (for the famed French legion), “I doubt whether it had an equal, and certainly no superior among all the regiments of the Army of the Potomac.”\n\nWinslow was appointed colonel of the 5th Veterans on May 25, 1863, and worked tirelessly to raise the Veterans regiment. While he was recruiting in New York City, the Draft Riots broke out. Winslow issued a call in newspapers for his veterans and citizen volunteers, organized them the next morning with some soldiers and took on the mob with howitzers and artillery firing canister. One veteran, a member of the mob wearing a 5th fez and carrying a Sharps rifle, tried to shoot Winslow off of his horse; he missed and hit Winslow’s horse, and was then shot down by a sergeant. Winslow repeatedly ordered canister and rifle volleys after his men were surrounded by the mob. Upon organizing the 5th Veterans, he enrolled himself on October 25 and mustered in as lieutenant colonel that date. Severely wounded in the left shoulder on June 2, 1864, at Bethesda Church, Virginia, Winslow had surgeons clean his wound and place his arm in a sling, then returned to the battle. As he grew weaker from loss of blood, he was ordered to the rear. His father, Gordon Winslow Sr. (see), who served as a chaplain with the 5th and 5th New York Veterans, found his son in the cellar of a house that was being shelled and accompanied him until they found a hospital, eventually staying overnight at the 6th Corps Hospital.\n\nGordon Winslow wrote, “…the wound was much inflamed by his return to the field. He passed the night comfortably; I slept on the floor under the same fly.” Traveling together on the transport ship Mary Ripley, Gordon Winslow threw a bucket overboard to get water for his horse. He apparently was pulled into the Potomac River, never to be seen again. Cleveland Winslow died of his wound on July 7, 1864, at Mansion House Hospital, Alexandria, Virginia, and was interred in Green-Wood on July 10. His brother, Gordon Jr. (see), also served in the 5th New York Veterans. Cleveland Winslow last resided in Staten Island. Section 11, lot 3909.\n\nWINSLOW, GEORGE C. (1844-1864). Sergeant, 139th New York Infantry, Company C. A New York City resident, he enlisted as a sergeant on August 21, 1862, at Brooklyn, mustered in the next day, was promoted to first sergeant at some point, and was killed in battle at Petersburg, Virginia, on June 25, 1864. Interment at Green-Wood took place on December 25, 1864. Section 115, lot 13536 (Soldiers’ Lot), grave 96.\n\nWINSLOW, GORDON (1804-1864). Chaplain, 5th New York Infantry; 5th New York Veterans. Born in Williston, Vermont, he was the father of Cleveland (see) and Gordon Jr. (see). He was a student at Phillips Academy from 1823 to 1826, graduated from Yale in 1830 and received a master’s degree from Yale in 1833. A student of theology, he was licensed to preach in 1833 and turned to the Episcopal ministry. He was rector of a church in Troy, New York, and Annapolis, Maryland, where he formed many friendships at the Naval Academy there. During those ministries, he developed an interest in minerals and soon amassed a fine collection for display. Bronchial troubles led to a need for a change of lifestyle and he purchased land and built a cottage when he became the rector of St. Paul’s Church in Staten Island. Prior to the Civil War, he received a doctorate of medicine from New York University.\n\nAt age 58, Winslow was an Episcopal minister and resident of Staten Island when he enlisted as a chaplain at Falmouth, Virginia, on May 9, 1861, and immediately mustered into the Field and Staff of the 5th New York. According to Alfred Davenport in “Camp and Field Life of the Fifth New York Volunteer Infantry (1879),” Winslow had an iron constitution, was energetic, able to endure any hardship, and had a strong love of his country. After the Battle of Big Bethel, Virginia, in June 1861, he remained behind to tend the wounded. He was praised by the officer in command, “The noble conduct of Chaplain Winslow and the generous-hearted men who remained to help the wounded, deserves the highest praise; and the toilsome task which they accomplished, of dragging the crude vehicles filled with their helpless comrades, over a weary road of nine miles in their exhausted condition, with the prospect of an attack every minute, bespeaks a goodness of heart and a bravery never excelled.”\n\nWinslow was at the Battle of First Bull Run, Virginia, on July 21, 1861, when he narrowly escaped injury when balls passed through his hair and beard and his horse was wounded under him. He was appointed sanitary inspector on August 14, 1861. When he mistakenly found himself among Confederates after the Battle of Antietam, Maryland, on September 17, 1862, he pretended to be one of their officers tending the wounded and escaped under the cover of darkness. He wrote to his brother after the Battle of Fredericksburg, Virginia, in December 1862:\n\nAs for myself, I am ready for anything that turns up in the way of helping on the cause for which we are in the field. I am chaplain of the Fifth, but act more or less for the whole division. Then, as volunteer aid to General Warren, I am under orders, and attend with him in the surveys and mapping of the country, establishing lines of pickets, locating hospitals, and looking after the sick and wounded in the Division, Brigades, and Regiments. After the battle I selected the site for the general hospital at Fredericksburg, and saw the wounded transported across the river and properly provided for.\n\nHe mustered out on May 14, 1863, at New York City, and then served with the Sanitary Commission at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, after that battle. Subsequently, Winslow became an inspector for the Army of the Potomac. He was praised for taking “the best measures of improving hospitals for the wounded, or means of comfort and solace, which at such times of trial cannot be too highly valued.” Winslow later joined his son Cleveland in the field with the 5th Veterans. On June 2, 1864, he found his wounded son, whose arm was in a sling, at the rear of the battlefield at Bethesda Church, Virginia, and wrote in his diary, “Cleve was wounded.” The next day, he wrote, “Went over to find Cleve; found him in a cellar of a house, which was being shelled, on our right….Rode all day to the several hospitals…brought Cleve to the 6th corps hospital and stayed with him overnight.” He wrote about his son’s injury as a “wound in the left shoulder, minie ball, making exit from the back….The wound was much inflamed by his return to the field, after being dressed. He passed the night comfortably….I slept on the ground under the same fly.” Dr. Winslow brought his son to a hospital boat and “his tenderness for his child equaled that of a mother.” Gordon Winslow died on June 7, 1864, when he drowned in the Potomac River while escorting his wounded son on the hospital transport boat, Mary Ripley after throwing a bucket overboard to get water for his horse; the drag from the bucket in the water apparently pulled him overboard. His body was never found. Cleveland died on June 7, 1864, at the Mansion House Hospital in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nA. Hendricks of the New York Herald said of Gordon Winslow, “A more popular and useful chaplain has not been in the service…A mind finely cultivated, manners dignified and refined, a rare fund of anecdote at command, and an underlying vein of delicate richness, served to make him a most genial as well as an agreeable and instructive companion….No cast of an ancient Grecian or Roman hero presented a more finely molded head than that of Dr. Winslow, and his long flowing gray beard, dark gray eyes of tender but penetrative expression, and straight and well-built frame, although sixty years of age, suggested him as a type, in these days of effeminate degeneracy rarely seen, of those great old philosophers who once walked the streets of Carthage and Rome.”\n\nAn obituary in the Christian Times said of Winslow, “His intellectual nature was characterized by life, earnestness, comprehensiveness, liberality of views, a special love for certain pursuits, and considerable genius. He was unambitious and made no display of his abilities. He often declined honors tended him…His business talent and executive abilities were remarkable. These gave him prominence and influence in every undertaking and employment. His accomplishments were of high order….” That obituary notes that he was a member of the Smithsonian Institute and contributed frequently to periodicals and encyclopedias. A craftsman, he had a patent related to the construction of locomotive wheels. That obituary concluded, “His memory we will keep with us, and his influence will live after him like the influence of the good, a source of blessing to many generations.” His wife and sons are buried at Green-Wood and he would have been interred there had his body been recovered. As a part of Green-Wood’s Civil War Project, a cenotaph was applied for at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was received, and was installed by Green-Wood staff in his family’s lot.

The first is from a camp in Prince Charles County, Maryland, on November 17, 1861. Excerpts from the letter follow with the original spelling; punctuation was added to make it clear to the reader. In the first excerpt, he describes his guard duty:\n\n…We were there nine days before we got to this camp and I was somewhat scared as there were some balls fired at us from across the river but they were fired over us so of course there was no damage done to us and while we was there the captain out of fun told the men that I was taken by the rebels and murdered so that when I got to the new camp they were quarraling (sic) who should have my boots and clothes to the laughable fun of the Captain….\n\nThe nearer we approach our enemy the more duty we have to perform. We have to be on guard night and day to keep them from crossing the river. We can see there picket and they can see ours. The river is about as wide as it is from Fulton Ferry to New York. We can hear holler and calling us a pack of cowardly sons of bitches and of course they get the same for an answer.\n\nWe have got five men of war lying there off there and they blockade there vessels from going up the river. They have got a battery above us on the opposite of the river and they fire at our vessels. This is an everyday occurrence but so far they have not hit one of our vessels. Now this Sunday while I am writing there is no less than six of our vessels passed them without being hit with there balls which they commence firing as soon as there is a vessel in sight….\n\nNothing more to say about the war at present only we do not know how soon they may attack us but I think they will have a hot time of it as there is no less than ten regiments of us, ours and General—are combined together in a division.\n\nNow I want and your mother to send me my New Years and I will tell you what I want. I want you to make me some nice crullers and some cake and likewise half gallon of Old Jamaica run. You must put them in a candle box and direct it to Captain Murphey on the outside of the box and not to me. On the inside put it who it is for and let Sam carry it to Adams Express office and it will come safe…\n\nNothing more at present\n\nThis from your father\n\nMiles Wood\n\nBelow is a letter from a camp near Liverpool Point. Paragraphs and some punctuation have been added to make the letter’s contents clearer to the reader. It was written on January 13, 1862.\n\nDear Maggie,\n\nI am enjoying myself these few idol (sic) moments in writing to you informing you that I am well. At present hoping these few lines may find you all the same. I received your welcome letter and likewise that long coming box at the same time that was on the 9th January. It was too late for New Year’s Day but it answered the same purpose. Both me and my tent mates had a jolly spree over the cake and the likewise had some whiskey to wrench it down with. We had to pay 12 shillings for one quart of rye whiskey and one did not have the desired effect so we went for the second. Likewise the third. So you can easy judge the condition of myself and my five mates.\n\nIn your letter you speak of your New Year sports. It is not to be compared with ours on New Year’s Day. We commenced with a greased pig to catch by the tail while running and likewise climbing a greased pole. In the afternoon a great ball match that ended the day’s sport. Evening a brake down dance by the Negro slaves here that we have taken while marching. There was a great many boxes sent here on New Year’s for the soldiers with liquor and the Colonel ordered the boxes to be broken open and the liquor spilt in the presence of the owners which you may judge caused some swearing. So in the course of four days we raised a large poll (sic) and on it hoisted the stars and stripes and for the occasion the Colonel ordered a barrel of whiskey to be opened for the soldiers to drink but to his utter astonishment few of them drank any saying they had spilt theirs and they might do the same with that….\n\n…I received a letter from home on Christmas Eve wrote by Sammy and he does not write as good as he did when I left home. I am afraid he does not attend to his school regular. I reckon he has to (sic) many Holidays. When I write home again I am going to scold your Mother about it. I got Sam and Cassy’s likeness in the box and I think that Cassy was rather out of humor when taken but you must not tell her that. If you do then I will get it.\n\nThe Assistant Adjutant General has got himself in a big scrape. He has turned traitor. He has been guilty of sending dispatches to the Secession Armies by his daughter of all our army proceedings. She was caught with the letters in her hair. But her and her father is locked up in Fort Warren Prison.\n\nI think you would laugh to have a bird’s eye view of our tents. When we are all in and see our fancy fireplaces made of clay. We last summer was the color of copper with the heat. Now we are a very dark drab with the smoke. I will conclude my letter by wishing your (sic) all a Happy New Year. This from your sincere and affectionate Father,\n\nMiles Wood\n\nPaper is plenty here\n\nAs per his soldier records, he was captured at Fair Oaks, Virginia, on July 1, 1862; a notation on his record indicates that he was wounded at that time.

On November 2, 1896, Wood was made quartermaster sergeant of Company H, a position held until he received a brevet commission as a second lieutenant, effective February 13, 1906, upon his retirement from the 23rd after 40 years. Wood never missed the annual inspection of his regiment although during his last inspection in January 1906, he took ill and had to be taken to the armory in a carriage. Because of his long and faithful service in the regiment, he was known as “the Old Campaigner,” a motto which his company also adopted.\n\nIn 1908, Wood moved to Cranford, New Jersey, from Greene Avenue (near Nostrand Avenue) in Brooklyn, and, as per the 1910 census, lived there on Orchard Street. That census also reports that he been married for fifteen years, worked as a salesman in the wholesale paint industry, and could read and write. The 1915 New Jersey State census and the 1920 census note that he still lived on Orchard Street, was married and worked as a paint salesman. As per his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, which confirms his Civil War service as a charter member of Company H of the 23rd Regiment, he was a “clever” marksman and was held in high esteem by his comrades in the Veterans’ Association of his regiment. At the time of his death, he was a widower with one surviving son. He last lived at 401 Orchard Street in Cranford, New Jersey. Section 164, lot, 16094.\n\nWOOD, VAN RENSSELAER (1832-1871).

Private, 139th New York Infantry, Company C. Woods was born in Massachusetts; his grandfather was a manufacturer of woolens in Leicester, Massachusetts. During the Civil War, he enlisted at Brooklyn as a private on September 3, 1862, and mustered into the 139th New York six days later. Thirteen months after his enlistment, he wrote this letter to his younger sister, Caroline, who was visiting her grandfather. At the time he wrote the letter, he was convalescing at Williamsburg, Virginia, and expected to be transferred to the Invalid Corps.\n\nCamp near Williamsburg, [Va.] October 15, 1863\n\nMy Dear Sister,\n\nYours of the 10th was received last night and I hasten to answer it that you may receive it before you leave Northampton. Mother’s letter has been read and answered. I did send some money but I suppose it did not reach Worcester before you left as I did not send until the 27th and think it may be in Worcester if Mother has not already got it. Did Minerva say anything about writing to me? Have not received a letter from Cornelia yet but received one from Lois which I intend to answer today if possible. Did Fannie go to Northampton with you? I think you will have a nice time and hope you will stay away from home long enough to get rested as there is no necessity for being in haste to get home. I am glad you like Emma so well and trust Ed has got a good wife.\n\nThe regiment has been building winter quarters but I have not done anything yet as I still expect to go away to the Invalid Corps. The Surgeon has returned and I suppose we shall know e’re long when we shall go if we go at all. It has been so long since I was examined that it seems as though I might not go but I would like to know one way or the other soon.\n\nI hope Mother will not be attending company all the time she is away but get a chance to rest as she must need it. Mrs. Wallace seems to be sorely afflicted and I am sorry that L. is so sick.\n\nWe do not have services in camp now as we have no place where we can hold services but we have a log chapel in process of construction and suppose those that are here this winter will have good sermons & enjoy many a winter evening in the rude structure. The chaplain has been home on a sick furlough and is now much improved in health and hope he will be able to do a great deal of good.\n\nOur Provost Marshal [Lt. William Wilkins Disosway] was shot yesterday by one of the guard [Pvt. William Boyle]. It seems the guard had been arrested and imprisoned for some offense and upon being released he went to his camp and got some liquor and then up to the town to the Provo’s Office and told him that he had been imprisoned and that he had something to do about it and at the same time presented a pistol. When the Marshal said, “are you aware that pistol is cocked?” he answered that he was. When the Marshal jumped to take the pistol away from him, the guard fired—the ball entering the mouth and passed out the back of his head, killing him almost instantly. The Provost Marshal was a captain in the 1st New York Mounted Rifles and about 20 years of age—much beloved by all his men and had been promoted from the ranks. He had just resumed his duties after being home on a furlough. The Provost Guard was sent to the fort followed by two men with pistols cocked and with orders to fire if he attempted to escape.\n\nI hope I shall have a cleaner sheet next time when I write and be able to write better. I received a letter from Aunt Harriet yesterday and a picture of Henry which was taken from an Ambrotype [photograph on glass]. Tell Fannie I shall not long be a stranger to her after the war closes as I intend to make a visit all around after I have got through this fighting business and shall see her then but should like to hear from her but she must not wait for me to write first. Perhaps I will send her a Waberly.\n\nGive my regards to all where you go. Aunts, Uncles & Cousins. Write again soon to your affectionate brother, — Frank\n\nAs per Manufacturers’ and Farmers’ Journal of March 7, 1864, the above incident had an ironic ending. Private Boyle, who was convicted of murder and sentenced to be shot, had his sentence commuted by President Abraham Lincoln and sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor. However, Private Thomas L. Abraham of Company G of the 139th New York, allowed Boyle to escape to the enemy, where allegedly he betrayed the movements of General Benjamin Butler to release the captives at Libby and Belle Isle Prisons in Richmond, thwarting that plan. For his treasonous action, Abraham was tried and sentenced to be shot at Yorktown on March 7, 1864, a measure approved by President Lincoln.\n\nThe transfer that Woods expected never happened. As per his muster roll, he was wounded in action on October 27, 1864, at Fair Oaks, Virginia, and was discharged for disability from Dale Hospital in Worchester, Massachusetts, on May 24, 1865. On June 12, 1865, he applied for and received an invalid pension, certificate 45,772.\n\nWoods married Caroline Evarts in Brooklyn in 1866. The 1870 census reports that he lived in Brooklyn with his wife and two children and was employed as a life insurance agent. The 1875 New York State census notes that he lived in Brooklyn with his wife and children at 102 Hamilton Street, a brick house valued at $6,000, and was a house painter. The 1880 census shows that the family lived at 82 Waverley Avenue in Brooklyn; Woods was still employed as a painter. The 1890 Veterans Census confirms Woods’s service in the Civil War. His last address was 82 Waverley Avenue in Brooklyn. Caroline Woods, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension, certificate 657,956. As per papers filed with his will by his widow, his personal estate did not exceed $3,200 in value. Section 80, lot 4246.\n\nWOODS, ROBERT (1840-1872). Corporal, 48th New York Infantry, Company B. Woods, who was born in Canada, enlisted as a private at Jamaica, New York, on February 20, 1865, and immediately mustered into the 48th New York. He was promoted to corporal at some point before he deserted on June 28, 1865, at Raleigh, North Carolina. His last residence was 107 Eldridge Street in Manhattan. Section 115, lot 11193, grave 73.\n\nWOODS, WILLIAM S. (or C.) (1842-1864). Captain, 5th New York Veterans Infantry, Company K; second lieutenant, 12th New York Infantry, Companies D and E. Born in Ireland, he enlisted on November 19, 1861, and mustered into Company D of the 12th New York that day. He was promoted to second lieutenant on June 27, 1862, and was placed in command of Company E on November 21, 1862. On February 16, 1864, he transferred back to Company D. He transferred into the 5th Veterans on June 2, 1864, was commissioned captain on July 12, and mustered into Company K on July 25, 1864.\n\nWoods was killed in action at Weldon Railroad, Virginia, on August 18, 1864, and his body was left on the field, along with eight other dead Zouaves, as the 5th retreated. It was recovered soon thereafter. General Frederic Winthrop wrote to his brother five days later, “But I cannot but linger for one moment over the name of Capt. W. S. Woods, who was killed in the action of the 18th, while nobly & bravely fighting the Company. A soldier of some promise—young-dashing—brilliant and manly.” He was also borne on the rolls as William C. Woods. Section 176, lot 21852.\n\nWOODWARD, ALFRED (1837-1916). Sergeant, 79th New York Infantry, Company A.

In 1890, his application for an invalid pension was granted, certificate 685,628. His last address was 1227 Sterling Place in Brooklyn. Rosina Woodward applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1916, certificate 811,109. Section 11, lot 5663.\n\nWOODWARD, JOHN BLACKBURNE (1836-1896). Colonel, 13th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company G. A Brooklyn native and brother of Robert (see), he started out in the leather business and had a long career in trade with South America, specializing in wool and hides. As per his obituary in The New York Times, he became a member of the Brooklyn City Guard in 1854, then a company of the 13th Regiment. He was also a member of the Brooklyn Excelsiors baseball team. According to Henry Chadwick, the “Father of Baseball,” the Excelsiors sent close to 90 men to fight in the Civil War. Woodward became second lieutenant of Company G of the 13th New York State Militia at the onset of the War, enlisting at Brooklyn on April 23, 1861, and commissioning in on May 14.\n\nOn May 11, he wrote to his father about the changes in men’s lives as they accommodated to the conditions at camp in Annapolis, Maryland. An excerpt follows:\n\n…Then for our meals-Those who have been accustomed to life at hotels, or the best boarding homes, where the dropping of a spoon on the clean carpet, or the presence of a speck on plate or glass, would consign them to be washed before fit to be placed before them for use, are now to be seen with tin plate, spoon & cup, in one hand a half rusty knife and food in the other, marching up in a single file to a place at a table where a man is stationed at a tin pail from which he ladles to each in his turn a portion of soup or rice, or slice of beef or what our commissary may provide for us as they may choose. They having received their share, they retire to such a point, as they may choose, and sitting down a la Turk (for our room is destitute of chairs) eat with as much relish as if they were at Delmonico’s or Welling’s [New York’s top restaurants]….As our friends home keep sending us luxuries which will shortly arrive we hope we long to be supplied with many good things. Last evening I received a can of Fresh Peaches which were eaten with much gusto, by we officers for supper – though they hardly harmonized with the balance of our bill of fare-…\n\nOn June 19, he wrote to his father from Camp Brooklyn near Baltimore about that city:\n\n…There is no doubt that two-thirds of the inhabitants are Secessionists and make no bones of saying so. The police are disloyal to a man. It is therefore impossible to get a decent reply from them. I asked one yesterday where Baltimore Street was, knowing at the time it was only a block off. His answer was “Just fifty-nine blocks up street.”…A great number of troops passed through here yesterday and to-day. Some big movement is on foot. Don’t know whether we are to be counted in or sent home.\n\nHe mustered out on August 6 of that year at Brooklyn. On May 28, 1862, he was commissioned as lieutenant colonel in the 13th Regiment, now part of the New York State National Guard, and mustered out on September 12, 1862, at Brooklyn. On June 20, 1863, he was commissioned as colonel of the 13th, mustering out on July 21, 1863. During that 30-day period, he wrote from camp in Caveton on July 12 of the hardships faced by his men:\n\n…We have all sorts of rumors in camp about the place where Lee and the rebs are located. I know that they cannot be far away, for they have just left everywhere we have marched in. All the Brooklyn regiments except the Forty-seventh are here, and we are all growling about our treatment, but I suppose the “darned militia” are not worth anything anyhow. However, it does seem hard to make as many sacrifices as we have and then, when here, to be snubbed and maltreated. The three-years’ troops who are here have everything they need. We have not a single wagon. Our men are obliged to carry along, between them, their cooking utensils, mess-pans, etc. I pack my horse’s back full in order to transport what is necessary for myself, yet I have not a single change of clothes. All this I could stand if we had rations for the men. I can’t and won’t give them a single particle of extra work. In consequence we have no camp guard, and the men come and go as suits their own pleasure, but they behave well and I have no complaints to make about them. We have here a certain General Knipe, who was formerly a clerk at Harrisburg, a very gross sort of fellow, who appears to have a grudge against us Yorkers. He threatened in Harrisburg to give us —. We think he has succeeded. He says he will put us in a fight to see whether we have any pluck. Perhaps he will succeed in that. He struck one of our darkies yesterday with his riding-whip for being a little slow in entering the ford…\n\nWoodward remained a colonel of the 13th Regiment until 1868 when he became a major general of Brooklyn’s Second Division of the New York National Guard. In 1879, Woodward was appointed state adjutant general, and retired from the National Guard the following year. In civilian life, he was president of the Third National Bank, and director of several insurance companies. He was appointed state inspector general by Governor Samuel Tilden in 1875 and in the same year was president of the Board of City Works. He ran for mayor of Brooklyn as an Independent in 1885, but lost to Daniel Whitney. A member of the Board of Park Commissioners and president of that body when it was legislated out of office in 1888, he was appointed Park Commissioner later that year. He was president of the Brooklyn City Guard Veterans’ Association and of the Art Association of the Brooklyn Institute (now the Brooklyn Museum of Art). In addition, he belonged to the Hamilton and Brooklyn Clubs and the Brooklyn Riding and Driving Club. He last lived at 259 Henry Street in Brooklyn. Section 72, lot 10915.\n\nWOODWARD, ROBERT B.

Woodward (see), also served in the Civil War. He last lived at 118 Pierrepont Street in Brooklyn but died in Cooperstown, New York. Section 72, lot 10915.\n\nWOODWARD, WILLIAM ROSWELL (1840-1890).

He also took part in Virginia at actions at Malvern Hill and on the retreat to Harrison’s Landing in July 1862. In May 1863, after returning from a leave issued so that he could recover from a serious illness, he was appointed acting assistant paymaster, and assigned to the Ethan Allen.

A Brooklyn native, 4’8″ in height and described as a hunchback, he enlisted May 31, 1861, at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Despite his physical limitations he served on board the USS North Carolina, a receiving ship for new naval recruits stationed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

After spending ten months and ten days in Libby Prison, he was exchanged on June 2, 1862, at Washington, D.C. According to his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, he then volunteered for the Navy in a response to a call for men. No details of his Navy service are known.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Woolstencroft established a retail hat store in a basement on lower Fulton Street, Brooklyn, under the name James Turnbull, eventually expanding the business into 37, 39 and 41 Fulton Street. He used the name James Turnbull in civilian life, too. His obituary noted his unusual business practice of keeping no books, using only cash transactions and making purchases only when he had money to replenish his stock. He became a naturalized citizen in 1880. His last residence was 41 Fulton Street, Brooklyn. Section 198, lot 27203.\n\nWOOSTER, CHARLES F. (1837-1883).

His obituaries in the Brooklyn Standard Union and in The New York Times provide further details on his service but not on his rank. The New York Times, which indicates his rank as first lieutenant, reports that he was captured at the Battle of First Bull Run, Virginia, and incarcerated at Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia; that imprisonment is verified by the Regimental Honor Roll which also states that he was wounded there. The Brooklyn Standard Union, which notes that he rose to captain, reports that he was also wounded at the Battle of Antietam, Maryland, and imprisoned at both Libby and Salisbury, and released in June 1862. Another record shows that he re-enlisted as a captain on June 17, 1863, was commissioned into Company E of the 71st Regiment on June 30, and mustered out with his company on July 22, 1863, at New York City. His pension index card indicates that he last served in Company H of the 71st Regiment. There is apparent confusion about his rank; although some sources report that he was a captain, it appears that he first enlisted as a corporal and may have been promoted to sergeant.\n\nProminent in the railroad business, Worchester was at one point treasurer of the Manhattan Elevated Railway Company and then connected with the West Shore road.

As per the 1850 census, which spells the family surname as “Barrall,” he was a 15-year-old living in New York City with his parents, six siblings, maternal grandfather and a servant. The 1855 New York State census reports that Henry was still living in New York City with his parents, six siblings and a servant.\n\nOn November 16, 1858, Worrall applied for a passport. He described himself as 5′ 3″ tall with gray eyes, large nose, high forehead, large mouth, sharp chin, brown hair, sallow complexion and oval face. At the time of his enlistment, as per a researcher of the 5th Regiment, he resided at 60 Beach Street in New York City and in Morristown, New Jersey, where he worked with his brother-in-law in the dry goods trade.

After Worrall returned to civilian life, he was an accountant in the family business, a tool and iron foundry. The 1870 census shows that Worrall and his 26-year-old brother were living with their parents in New York City; his brother and father were listed as iron founders but no occupation is listed for him. The 1876 Brooklyn Directory shows that Worrall was living at 90 1st Place in Brooklyn.
