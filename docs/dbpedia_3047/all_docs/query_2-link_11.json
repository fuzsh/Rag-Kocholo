        "text": "Summary:\n\nCol. John H. Stover commanded the 184th Pennsylvania Infantry of the Army of the Potomac. Stover reports that the regiment played a small role in the engagement at Hatcher's Run.\n\nCapt. WILL GILDER,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-Gen., First Brigade.\n\nFebruary 12, 1865.\n\nSIR\n\nI have the honor to report that, in obedience to orders, my command was reported on the brigade parade ground at 6 a.m. February 5. The regiment marched with the brigade until we reached the picket-line on the Vaughan road. The One hundred and eighty-fourth was then assigned to the right of the brigade, and, after several maneuvers, was formed in line immediately west of the Riddle house. Here fortifications were erected and skirmishers thrown in front. I remained in this position until the morning of the 11th instant, when, after destroying all the fortifications of the brigade, I withdrew the regiment to the lines it now occupies. The regiment was not heavily engaged with the enemy, and consequently I lost but two men wounded, viz, Joseph Jenkins, sergeant, Company B, wounded, and John Adams, private, Company K, wounded in hand. I have every reason to be proud of the deportment of the officers and men during this campaign. No special opportunity was presented for unusual gallantry, except on the night of the 5th, when a portion of the picket-line was driven in by the enemy. Lieut. Col. Charles Kleckner promptly re-established the line, driving the enemy from the pits he had captured. I accordingly recommend him to the favorable notice of the Col. commanding the brigade.\n\nRespectfully, &c.,\n\nJOHN H. STOVER,\n\nCol., Cmdg. Regt."
