        "text": "Tag Archives: Union\n\nBook Review: Charley – The True Story of the Youngest Soldier to Die in the American Civil War.\n\nAuthor Brendan J. Lyons, the Boy Scouts of America, and Charles “Charley” Edwin King\n\nAs a young man, Charley author Brendan J. Lyons of West Chester, Pennsylvania was a Boy Scout. He’d earned the rank of Life and began working on earning the Eagle rank, the highest and most prestigious rank in Scouting. The Eagle rank requires the Scout to complete a community service project and Lyons needed to find just such a project. These projects are not always easy to find. Lyon’s interest in history helped him to find his community service project.\n\nLyons learned from his scout leader, who was a member of the Sons of Union Veterans, about Charley King, he was a twelve-year-old drummer boy from West Chester who went off to fight and die in the Civil War.\n\nCharley King’s story intrigued Lyons, especially the part about how no one knew for sure where the young Civil War drummer boy was buried. For his Eagle Scout community service project, Lyons decided he would raise money (along with help from the Sons of Union Veterans and others who had an interest in history) for a monument to honor Charley King that would be placed in the Green Mount Cemetery, where members of the King family are buried.\n\nBrendan J. Lyons completed his Eagle Scout community service project and earned the rank of Eagle. But for many years afterward, Lyons now an adult, felt like his work with Charley King was incomplete.\n\nLyons wanted to tell the story of the Civil War drummer boy. The trouble was, there was that not much known of Charley’s actual history. After all, Charley died when he was only thirteen years old, he did not have the chance to make much life history. What is known is the factual history of Company F of the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteers, the company in which Charley King served. Brendan J. Lyons began researching and writing.\n\nCharley is a novel that combines historical fact and creative fiction to tell a story as accurately as possible about Charley King. It’s a convincing effort. Lyons’ Eagle Scout community service project became one of his life’s works with his book: Charley – The True Story of the Youngest Soldier to Die in the American Civil War.\n\nCharley King’s Early Life Before the Civil War\n\nI have chosen some excerpts from Charley to introduce you to Lyons’ story about Charley King and how the young lad became a drummer in the Civil War. Included too, I have added some explanatory comments of my own. Note that April 3, 1861, was a Wednesday.\n\nMy Comments:\n\nCharles “Charley” Edwin King was born on April 3, 1849.\n\nCharley died on September 20, 1862.\n\nCharley’s father was Pennell, he was a tailor.\n\nHis mother’s name was Adaline.\n\nHis brother Lewis, was two years younger than Charley.\n\n“On this Wednesday in April, one month after the inauguration of President Abraham Lincoln, the nation stood on the brink of conflict.”\n\n“On this Wednesday in April, as the country was coming apart at the seams because of the growing tide of secession, unprecedented animosity divided the nation that first brought the concepts of free and equal representation to the world.”\n\n“On this Wednesday in April 1861, Charley King was turning twelve years old.”\n\n“At this time, when America faced its greatest test since the very revolution that created it, Charley had reached the age that – by his judgment – qualified him to stand and fight for his nation. Whether his father would agree remained to be seen, but in Charley’s mind, he could lift a rifle as well as anyone and his home needed stout defenders.”\n\nYoung Charley King Is a Drummer\n\n“Charley could see himself quite easily, decked in Union blue and marching beside his countrymen. He was already accomplished at keeping time, by virtue of his skill on the drum. His father often claimed Charley had been drumming perfect military cadence since before he could walk. Whether or not that was true, Charley couldn’t say, but he certainly loved to play his drum.”\n\n“Apparently, he loved to play it a tad too much and had just recently drummed right through the head of his snare. It happened two weeks earlier and since then, he’d had to make do with whatever he could get away with drumming on.”\n\n“With the drum beat in his mind, however, he was able to mark time perfectly around his room and, as he did. Envision a future where his deeds brought glory to his family and his nation. One day–and Charley felt that day would come soon–he would find himself marching into Richmond alongside his fellow Union soldiers as streams of confetti and other colorful paper rained down on them. They would be celebrated as liberators from the wicked grasp of traitors and the people would love them for it.”\n\n“The celebration would be even greater when he returned home a hero. His parents would hug him tight and say how proud they were of him. All of West Chester would come out to celebrate. Perhaps all of Chester County!”\n\n“Now boy, I must say–eleven, twelve, or even fifteen, I think it not wise for you to wish to go to war. Truthfully, I will not allow it. Your passion is commendable, but it would be far too dangerous. You are much too young, and besides quite slight for your age. I think you are perhaps the smallest boy in your class. Charley you cannot go to war.”\n\nMy Comments:\n\nCharley was caught up in enthusiasm about going off to war and to “See the Elephant,” which means to experience battle. However, his wise father was against young Charley going off to war.\n\nCharley Gets a New and Special Drum On His Birthday\n\n“By the time the day’s ends came, Charley could barely keep his feet from tapping. He was prepared to leap out of his chair and sprint home to see what news may have come while lessons were being taught, but he was stopped by a group of friends before he could.\n\n“‘Where are you headed Charley?’ one of them asked.\n\n“‘Oh, just going home. I thought I’d stop by the telegraph office and see if there was any war news on the way.’\n\n“‘Are you marching down?’ asked another.\n\n“‘I… guess I can…’ Charley wasn’t sure where this line of questions was going. The other kids were his friends, but they rarely showed interest in his marching about anymore. It was odd that they would ask him now.\n\n“‘Why don’t you lead us?’ The first classmate asked. ‘We figured if the war is gonna happen maybe we ought to get the top shape, right?’\n\n“Charley frowned.\n\n“‘I guess only I can’t really lead you guys. My drum is broken.’\n\n“‘Well, I guess you’ll need a new drum!’ A voice behind him made Charley jump.\n\n“Charley whirled around to see his parents standing there side by side, huge smiles on their faces. His father held out a large cylindrical package.\n\n“‘Happy birthday, Charley,’ he said.\n\n“‘We hope you like it,’ his mother added.\n\n“Without hesitating, Charley took the package and tore off the paper. Inside, was a large blue snare drum with red trim on the top and bottom. Around the middle, it was emblazoned with a soaring bald eagle on opposite sides of the drum.\n\n“‘This is amazing,’ Charley gasped. ‘It’s perfect… the eagle, is this…?’\n\n“‘The very drum that the musicians in the Army of the Potomac play,’ Pennell confirmed.\n\n“‘Your father had the Sweney boy send one in,’ Adeline said. ‘He made such a show about having all that extra work so you wouldn’t think anything odd if you saw him rushing about. I told him you wouldn’t notice, but he does so like to play games.’\n\nMy Comments:\n\nNow on his birthday, young Charley King has an actual drum used by the military. It’s a dream come true for the now twelve-year-old musician. The “Sweney boy” was no longer a boy, he was a neighbor and friend of the King family who would have a great influence on Charley’s future.\n\nCharley Wants To Be A Drummer In The Civil War\n\n“The family said Grace and they began to dish out dinner, starting with the youngest children.\n\n“‘So you like the drum.’ Pennell said, as he distributed chunks of cornbread.\n\n“‘I love it,’ Charley answered. ‘I led practically the whole school around town, and they all marched in line. well sort of a line…’\n\n“‘Oh, we heard,’ Adeline said.\n\n“‘People were talking about it?’ Charley asked.\n\n“‘No, your mother means we actually heard it,’ Pennell clarified. ‘That is quite the loud drum. Necessarily so, of course, as it must be heard over the sounds of battle.’\n\n“‘Hey yeah.’ Charley said, a thought forming in his mind. He looked over at his drum and thought about what a thrill it had been to lead his peers. And he was a good drummer – everyone said so.\n\n“‘What if I was a Drummer Boy?’ he blurted out.\n\n“‘I would say you already are.’ his mother replied.\n\n“‘No, I mean, when the war starts. The army needs drummers don’t they, to help with a March and all sorts of things? But drummers don’t carry guns.‘\n\n“Charley watched as his father drew a long breath, lying down his silverware beside his plate.\n\n“‘Son, we already talked about this. You’re too young. Whether you’re carrying a gun or not, you would still be in danger.’\n\n“‘But they wouldn’t fire on a drummer boy, would they?’\n\n“‘The drummer marches in line with the rest of his company, Charley. Side-by-side. When one line fires on another, they are rarely discerning when it comes to their target. You are only 12 years old.’”\n\nMy Comments:\n\nA fire is lit in Charley’s mind to become a drummer in the Civil War. Pennell and Adaline now have a challenge to discourage Charley from having such a dream.\n\nCaptain Sweney Needs a Drummer For Company F of the 49th Pennsylvania\n\nMy Comments:\n\nAs Charley is marching about West Chester and playing his new drum, practicing as if he is a drummer in the Civil War. He encounters a man in a blue uniform with the insignia of a captain riding on a horse. Charley’s drumming had spooked the horse. The uniform caused Charley to not immediately recognize the man, but he looked familiar. But then Charley knew who the man on the horse was.\n\nHe is Benjamin Sweney, the next-door neighbor of the King family, now to be the captain of Company F of the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteers. At Charley’s father’s request, it was Sweney who had arranged for Charley to have a new drum as a birthday present. This chance meeting on a West Chester, Pennsylvania street would change Charley’s life.\n\n“‘So, tell me, Charley, how long have you been drumming?’\n\n“‘Forever, I guess,’ Charley shrugged. ‘I don’t really remember a time when I wasn’t playing in some way. I just like keeping time, I suppose.’\n\n“‘Well you are skilled at it. I have a deep love of music and I greatly appreciate a kindred spirit..’\n\n“Charley forced a smile.\n\n“‘Thank you… sir, would you mind if I asked you a question?’\n\n“‘Go ahead.’\n\n“‘Well, if you’re a captain in the army, what are you doing in West Chester? Shouldn’t you be with your regiment?’\n\n“‘Well,‘ Captain Sweney said. ‘I suppose I should, but at the moment I don’t have one. I’m here because Mr. Lincoln is looking for 300,000 men for three years of service. I’m to be captain of Company F in the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteers, but as of now, the 49th doesn’t exist. it will soon, though.’\n\nMy comments:\n\nCaptain Sweney and Charley begin to discuss about men volunteering to join the army. In particular Charley’s father and Charley himself.\n\n“‘Oh, he sees it that way when it comes to his own duty, should his country need him,’ Charley explained, ‘just not when it comes to me. I love this country too, but I cannot go fight. I cannot even carry a drum.’\n\n“Captain Sweney frowned.\n\n“‘It sounds as if he wants to keep you safe. I don’t believe there is anything wrong with a father thinking that way.’\n\n“‘Of course,’ Charley replied. ‘I understand that. I just… sorry, sir. I don’t mean to be rude.’\n\n“‘Not at all. listen, your father wants you to be safe, and I understand that. My father wants me and my brother to be safe too, no matter how old we’ve gotten.’\n\n“‘But I also understand your deep desire to come to the aid of your country. So… well, I can make no promises, Charley, but I will be head of a company… and a company needs a drummer. Perhaps I can speak with your father.’\n\n“Charley tried to contain his excitement. He knew his father was serious about keeping him safe and he had no chance of changing his mind on his own. But maybe with the help of a captain in the army, Pennell might just see things differently.\n\n“‘You would you do that for me?’ Charley said. ‘What if he doesn’t change his mind?’\n\n“‘It cannot hurt to try,’ Captain Sweney replied. ’I’ll come by tomorrow morning and speak to him.’\n\n“They did not have to wait long at all before Captain Sweney appeared on the block, making his way toward the King’s home. He was still in his uniform, riding his horse toward them. He stopped and tied the beast to the porch before walking to the door and knocking. Charley moved to answer it but his father gestured for him to sit back down and wait. A moment later, Captain Sweney was inside.\n\n“‘I’ve not seen you for some time, Benjamin,’ his father said. ‘You’ve done quite well for yourself, I see.’\n\n“‘As you as have you.’ Captain Sweney replied. ‘You have a fine home. It almost makes a man jealous to see such a fine picture of domestic life. A military tent is a little comfort.’\n\n“‘Indeed, Pennell said. You, of course, know my son Charley. The other children are still upstairs, and my wife Adeline is in the kitchen. Would you like to come sit down and have breakfast?’\n\n“‘That is very kind of you Pennell, I accept. Do you have any coffee?’\n\n“‘I am certain we can brew some up for you,’ Pennell replied.\n\n“‘So,’ his father said, ‘I understand you’ve spoken to my boy about being a drummer for your company.’\n\n“‘Yes, Mr. King. I apologize if I overstep my boundaries. The boy nearly crashed into me while I was riding through town, and I happened to notice his considerable skill with the instrument.’\n\n“‘I understand your company is to be part of the 49th Pennsylvania, organizing in September. Is that correct?’\n\n“‘It is,’ Captain Sweney said. ‘Before you give me your thoughts on the matter of Charley’s joining, I do want to say that I am very understanding of your feelings on the matter. This is no small thing to be undertaken lightly. War is a dangerous proposition, for all involved. That said, precision is paramount when moving and positioning troops, and I have heard your son play. I venture to say he understands the importance of precision.’\n\n“‘In music, certainly,” Pennell allowed, ‘but the streets of West Chester are not the fields of Virginia, Ben. And cannonballs do not discriminate between musket and drum.’\n\n“‘That is true, but your boy will not be in the thick of it. When battle commences, he would be behind the company. I will make sure of that, he will stay safe.’\n\n“‘How can you promise that?’ Charley heard his mother ask. ‘You have no control over what the other side will do. The Rebels will fire upon anyone in blue. They have no regard for age.’\n\n“‘I will see to it myself,’ Captain Sweney replied. ‘As long as I stand – as long as I hold my command – I promise to ensure your son’s safety. He will not be hurt under my watch.’\n\n“‘You’ll make it part of your duty to protect him?’ his father asked. ‘You give me your word?’\n\n“‘On my honor,’ Captain Sweney said, ‘he will not come to harm.’\n\n“Charley let out a long breath. They rose to their feet and walked out of the kitchen to where Charley was waiting. Behind them, he could see his mother standing with a hand over her mouth. The look on her face pained him deeply, but nothing could turn him back now.\n\n“‘Well,’ the captain said, ” ‘I suppose you could hear all that from here. Enjoy the rest of your summer, Charley. come September, we muster.’”\n\nMy Comments:\n\nCaptain Sweney has made an unreasonable promise to Charley’s father and mother that he will keep Charley safe in battle. Perhaps Captain Sweney is naive. With this, twelve-year-old Charley King’s life takes a dramatic turn. He will be going off to fight in Mr. Lincoln’s Army as a drummer in Company F in the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteers. His drummer dream is to come true. Charley will train to become a soldier and he will participate in many Civil War battles. Charley will “See The Elephant,” and he will experience the horror of war firsthand.\n\nThe foundation of Lyon’s story about Charley King has been laid and from forward on the reader can enjoy Lyon’s blending of factual history and his storytelling fiction that weaves a believable story about Charley King, a mere twelve-year-old boy who became a drummer in the Civil War. Charley goes to war and “Sees the Elephant.”\n\nFactual History of Company F of the 49th Pennsylvania\n\nMy comments:\n\nFrom September 14, 1861 and on, the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Unit was very active in the Civil War. The unit would suffer casualties as it fought in many battles, 361 men would be lost.

Lyon’s novel Charley is a book that combines historical facts and creative fiction to tell a story as accurately as possible about Charley King. It’s a convincing effort. In Charley, Lyons blends factual history with believable and imaginative storytelling. Lyons is not unlike Michael and Jeff Shaara in this talent.\n\nAs I read Charley, I began to think that Lyons had discovered a diary of Charley’s, a diary where Charley kept a detailed record of his short life and times. He gets the history right and fills in the unknown story about Charley King with his own imagination. The result is an intriguing, entertaining, and informative book.\n\nI found Charley to be a page-turner and I’m sure you will too. I wholeheartedly recommend Brendan J. Lyons’ book, Charley – The True Story of the Youngest Soldier to Die in the American Civil War to you.\n\nCharley will help you to Learn Civil War History.\n\nBook Information From Amazon:\n\nProduct details\n\nPublisher ‏ : ‎ Brookline Books (July 15, 2023)\n\nLanguage ‏ : ‎ English\n\nPaperback ‏ : ‎ 160 pages\n\nISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 1955041067\n\nISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-1955041065\n\nReading age ‏ : ‎ 12 – 18 years\n\nGrade level ‏ : ‎ 7 – 9\n\nItem Weight ‏ : ‎ 3.2 ounces\n\nDimensions ‏ : ‎ 5.8 x 0.6 x 8.9 inches\n\nBest Sellers Rank: #763,430 in Books (See Top 100 in Books)\n\n#19 in Teen & Young Adult United States Civil War Period History\n\n#151 in Teen & Young Adult Historical Biographies\n\n#4,477 in Military Leader Biographies\n\nCustomer Reviews: 5.0 5.0 out of 5 stars 7 ratings\n\nWords, Slang, Nicknames, and Terms Used During the Civil War\n\nWords, Slang, Nicknames, and Terms of Civil War Times\n\nThere are hundreds and hundreds of words, slang, nicknames, and terms that were used by the soldiers and civilians of the North and South. These words are often descriptive, unique, inventive, clever, and sometimes humorous.\n\nCivil War soldiers and civilians had an interesting way of speaking. Their words might seem odd to us today, just as our language of today would sound strange to them. They regarded their language as normal and we think the same of how we speak today. Some of their words are still used today while others are seldom, if ever heard. Vernacular does change as time goes on and as society’s trends change.\n\nHere is a sampling of language used during Civil War times:\n\nTOP\n\n| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | Y | Z\n\nA\n\nAbatis – An abatis is a simple but effective defensive line obstacle made by felling trees so their sharpened branches faced outward toward the enemy. The abatis would provide cover, and give soldiers time to make an offensive effort by slowing an enemy charge. It was easily constructed with axes or saws, and trees were plentiful.\n\nAbolitionist – An abolitionist was someone who wanted slavery to end, they wanted slavery to be abolished. They were usually Northern white Christians who thought slavery was morally wrong, that it was an evil thing. Prominent abolitionists included; Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Angelina Grimké, Wendell Phillips, John Greenleaf Whittier, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Harriet Tubman, and the radical and violent John Brown.\n\nAide-de-Camp – An officer who works as an assistant to a high ranking officer from whom he took orders. An aide-de-camp wrote out orders and knew troop positions. His trustworthiness of keeping confidential information secret was mandatory.\n\nAntebellum – Refers to the time before the Civil War began. Note: Postbellum refers to the time after the Civil War ended.\n\nArmy Organization – An army is the largest organization of soldiers and they were divided into companies, regiments, brigades, divisions, and corps. Union Armies were named after rivers. The Army of the Potomac was a noted Union Army. Confederate armies were commonly named for states or regions. The Army of Northern Virginia is such an example.\n\nArtillery (Field) – A branch of an army made up of cannons, men, and equipment. Cannons are large-caliber guns used on land to support the infantry and cavalry. There was also siege artillery, artillery used in fortifications, and naval artillery. Artillery might be either smoothbore or rifled. There were many kinds of cannons of various sizes. Some artillery cannons were; Napoleons, Howitzers, Whitworth, and Parrots.\n\nTOP\n\nB\n\nBattery – A battery was the basic unit of artillery just as a company was the basic unit of infantry. Five or six batteries would make up an artillery brigade. When at ideal fullness, a battery usually was made up of 6 cannon, 155 men, horses, ammunition, other equipment, a captain, two buglers, carriages, caissons, limbers and drivers, and seventy cannoneers. Horses were very important because they were needed to move the heavy artillery but they required many men to manage them. These numbers of a battery varied as the Civil War progressed and battle attrition took its toll on men, horses, and equipment. Overall, the North with its industrial strength had more artillery than the South.\n\nBivouac – To bivouac was to have a temporary camp during a march, a movement, or perhaps even a battle. It was a place in the open where sleep and food could be had, but not a place or facility meant for a long time. It usually did not involve a two-man tent but was a shelter made up of branches with leaves, wood, plants, or whatever could be gathered to give weary soldiers protection from the weather for a short time. The soldiers made up this shelter themselves without supplies from the army.\n\nBorder States – The four Border States of Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri were slave states that did not secede from the Union. West Virginia became the fifth and a new Border State when it joined the Union on June 20, 1863.\n\nBreastworks – Breastworks were for defensive purposes and made of anything and everything soldiers could gather together. A breastwork could possibly be made of dirt, bricks, stones, logs, or whatever might be found, to form a pile reaching up to breast-high to provide cover and protection.\n\nNow, let’s recognize that both the Billy Yanks and Johnny Rebs were most likely young men. During their casual and relaxing times, they might in their discussions refer to another type of “breastworks,” as young men are sometimes apt to do. However, this is beyond the scope of the military description of breastworks. The reader is welcome to speculate about what this other kind of breastwork might be.\n\nBrevet Rank – The brevet rank was honorary. Although it had no authority nor brought the pay of an actual rank, it was a promotion awarded for actions that were gallant or meritorious. The brevet rank brought esteem and recognition to an individual.\n\nBrigade – Brigades were made up of regiments, the number of regiments in a brigade’s total strength varied but usually it was two to seven regiments and the number of soldiers would be only a few hundred all the way up to 4,000. A brigadier general commanded a brigade, but sometimes colonels or lieutenant colonels led a brigade.\n\nBuck and Ball – This was a paper cartridge for a muzzle-loading gun with a deadly combination of three to six buckshot behind a musket ball. Musket balls of .50 to .75 caliber were commonly used in Buck and Ball. Early in the Civil War, this ammunition was used mostly for defensive fire. Buck and Ball turned the inaccurate smoothbore musket into a more efficient shotgun-like weapon. The spreading of the buckshot and ball made it lethal at short range against close together enemies. Buck and Ball was used throughout the Civil War, but less and less later on in the war when rifled muskets became the main weapon of use.\n\nButternut – A slang name for a Confederate soldier. This slang name came from the substitute fabric sometimes used for Confederate uniforms when gray cloth was scarce. This fabric was a yellowish/brown color. The home-made dye used for this fabric came from butternut and walnut trees. The leaves, bark, and roots of these trees are what created the yellowish/brown color of the dye. The color was called “butternut.”\n\nTOP\n\nC\n\nCaissons – Caissons were used by artillery units to pull cannons, ammunition chests, tools, and even a spare wheel. They were two-wheeled carts moved by a team of horses.\n\nCaliber – Caliber was the measurement of the inside circumference of a gun barrel in thousandths of an inch. Bullets had to match a gun’s caliber. The many different calibers of bullets and guns used in the Civil War could sometimes make it difficult to have the proper ammunition available.\n\nCanister or Case Shot – Canister or Case shot ammunition made a cannon like a giant shotgun. It was very effective at ripping bodies apart. This container-like artillery round was packed full with 30-40 musket balls of iron or lead. But sometimes anything handy might be used, like nails, screws, or small stones. Sawdust was used as filler between the iron or lead balls. When fired it would break apart with the effect of a giant shotgun shell. Canister was like a big tin can or a metal coffee can while Case Shot was a cannonball.\n\nCap – A cap was needed to fire a Civil War percussion weapon such as a rifle-musket. It was a small container with the volatile and explosive chemical fulminate of mercury inside of it. A soldier would put a cap on his loaded rifle and pull the trigger. The gun’s hammer would strike the cap and the pressure would ignite the fulminate of mercury, then the gunpowder would ignite and the bullet blasted out of the barrel.\n\nCarbine – A carbine was a short-barreled breech-loading repeating rifle used by cavalry. Breech-loading means it was loaded at the rear of the barrel. The carbine’s light weight and shorter barrel made it easier to manage when its user was on a horse.\n\nCasualty – A Civil War casualty was a soldier who was either wounded, killed, captured, deserted, became sick, was discharged, or missing in action. Casualties are a loss of numerical strength. The Battle of Antietam was the most bloody and deadly one day battle of the Civil War.\n\nAt the Battle of Antietam, according to the NPS Antietam National Battlefield website, the approximate total number of Union casualties was: killed – 2,100, wounded – 9,550, and missing or captured – 750, for a total of 12,400. For the Confederates the number of casualties was: killed – 1,550, wounded – 7,750, and missing or captured – 1,020, for a total of 10,320.\n\nChevaux-de-Frise – This was a large horizontal log or beam with diagonal rows of sharp wooden spikes sticking out of it. A Chevaux-de-Frise was used as a defensive barrier for troops, roads, or fortifications to hinder or stop the enemy from advancing. They would be attached together to increase effectiveness. (Pronounced sheh-VOH-de-freez.)\n\nCommutation – A draftee could avoid serving in the military by paying a fee. Both the Union and the Confederacy offered commutation. This fee was so high that only the wealthiest could afford to pay it. For the less wealthy common workers, the commutation fee might be more than their yearly earnings. It was nearly impossible for them to pay for a commutation and avoid being drafted. This high fee angered those who did not want to fight in the war.\n\nContraband – A slang name for an escaped slave who came into Union lines for safety from owners and slave catchers. General Ben Butler refused to return slaves to their owner in May 1861 and in a report he called them, “contraband of war.”\n\nCopperheads – Northern Democrats who were opposed to the Union’s war policy and wanted a negotiated peace were called Copperheads. They were also called Peace Democrats. President Lincoln used his executive powers, in controversial ways some argue, to suppress the Copperheads. Lincoln’s methods included arrests, censorship, limitations on the press, and the suspension of habeas corpus. Representative Clement Vallandigham of Ohio, a prominent Copperhead/Peace Democrat, was arrested.\n\nCottonclad – A Cottonclad was a Confederate States Navy gunboat with bales of cotton attached to its sides. The cotton bales were to absorb and protect the gunboats from the enemy fire of Union warships, of which they were usually outgunned.\n\nTOP\n\nD\n\nDefeat in Detail/Attack In Detail – This was an effective tactic used to conquer smaller enemy units that were not able to support or protect one another, perhaps because of distance or lack of coordination. By concentration of strength, a larger force could defeat the smaller enemy units one by one. This tactic would expose the attacking larger unit to less risk. Imagine it as like three big guys together singling out one small guy to beat up, then they move on and find a friend of the small guy to wallop. The small guys always have the odds against them.\n\nDemonstration – A deceptive and crafty movement or action made in order to fool and gain the enemy’s attention. To trick, distract, or confuse the enemy and gain an advantage so an attack can be made at another place. When performed on the battlefields of the Civil War, it was like what we would call today a Fake Out or a sleight of hand, to make someone believe something that isn’t true. See: Feint.\n\nDropsy – This was the word used in Civil War times for what we call edema. Edema is the swelling of limbs, mostly in the legs and feet, caused by the inside build up of fluid.\n\nDysentery – The same as diarrhea but also with blood. Disease in the Civil War killed many, many soldiers, it was responsible for over two-thirds of total deaths in the war. Dysentery, typhoid, and cholera were the leading causes of death in the Civil War. Dysentery was a common malady and killer for the soldiers.\n\nTOP\n\nE\n\nEarthworks/Entrenchments – Moving earth around to form defensive barriers or fortifications such as mounds or trenches was a common practice on the battlefield. Typically, a long trench would be dug and the dirt piled up to make a mound in front of the trench. Earthworks and Entrenchments provided protection for the troops behind or in them and they slowed the advancing enemy.\n\nEmancipation– Emancipation was being freed from slavery, the “Peculiar Institution.” It meant liberty, manumission, and release, from being enslaved. Freed slaves were no longer someone’s property.\n\nEnfilade – To fire straight on upon the length and from end to end of the enemy’s facing battle line.\n\nTOP\n\nF\n\nFeint – A feint is a fake attack made in one place or direction to mislead the enemy, while the actual attack is made at another place or direction. See: Demonstration.\n\nFlank – A flank is the end of a line of battle and is a weak place in the line. It is a place where few troops are positioned and is vulnerable to enemy attack. The troops in the line, the long row of men facing toward the enemy, have a stronger position to meet enemy attacks as compared to the flanks.\n\nFlying Battery – A Flying Battery was a clever way of fooling the enemy into thinking that you had more artillery than you actually did. Several artillery batteries would fire from one spot along the front of the battle, then quickly move the horse-drawn batteries to another location and fire again. This maneuver would be repeated and if done with skill and could not be seen, then the enemy could be duped.\n\nForaging – When soldiers lived off the land, by gathering, eating, stealing, and using whatever they could for their use, they were foraging. It was an act of looting and plundering.\n\nFortification – Anything that would help to make a defensive position more secure from the enemy. A Fortification might be man-made earthen mounds. Natural obstacles such as rivers, creeks, swamps, marshes, hills, and mountains could be fortifications too.\n\nFox Holes – There were no fox holes in the Civil War. During the Civil War, what today is called a “fox hole” was called a “rifle pit.” Actually, there were fox holes in the Civil War, but real foxes lived in them.\n\nFurlough – A Furlough was when a soldier was allowed to take a leave from his duty for a certain time before he had to return. It was like a vacation from the war, a time-out. Perhaps the soldier would return home, or maybe spend his furlough in a town. A furloughed soldier carried papers with him to identify him and to confirm that he was on furlough. If a soldier did not return from his furlough on time, then he would be considered a deserter.\n\nTOP\n\nG\n\nGabions – These were field fortifications used to protect gun emplacements and soldiers. Gabions were round cylinder containers made of wicker and filled with wood, rocks, and dirt. Gabions could be quite large depending on what their fortification purpose was.\n\nGoober Peas – Southern slang for peanuts.\n\nGraybacks – Slang for lice. The parasites of lice, ticks, fleas, and mites were a bane of Civil War soldiers. These pests feasted on them and spread typhus, fevers, malaria, and infections that could kill. “Graybacks” was also a derogatory name Yankee soldiers used for Johnny Rebs.\n\nGreen Troops – New soldiers who had not yet been in battle. Raw recruits.\n\nTOP\n\nH\n\nHard Backsides – Union General George Armstrong Custer’s nickname.\n\nHardtack – Hardtack was a typical item in the diet of both Billy Yanks and Johnny Rebs. Hardtack was a quarter-inch thick square of baked unleavened flour. salt, and water. Its official name was “hard bread.” It was a hard cracker that was often stale and rancid due to poor storage. The soldiers often joked about hardtack. One joke the soldiers told was that the only protein in their diet came from the worms found in the hardtack and called hardtack a “castle for worms.”\n\nHaversack – Civil War soldiers used a canvas bag to carry their food. A Haversack was typically one foot square and covered with black tar on the outside for waterproofing.\n\nHay Foot! Straw Foot! – While training new recruits, sergeants could become frustrated as they drilled the men in movements. Many of these men came to military service from farms and other rural areas. The new soldiers would become a confused mess by turning or marching the wrong way to commands. They seemed not to know the difference between left and right.\n\nTo help solve this problem a wisp of hay was tied around the left leg just below the knee and a wisp of straw was tied around the right leg just below the knee. Then the sergeant would use “Hay Foot! Straw Foot!” in his commands and the men would not be confused about left and right. They knew what hay and straw were and which direction to move.\n\nHish and Hash – This was a meal made of whatever edible food was available. It would be like us putting together a dinner of leftovers that have been hanging around, but are still good to eat.\n\nHog and Hominy – What Southern food was called and often referring to plain, simple food. Hominy is ground corn that was boiled in milk or water to make grits.\n\nHousewife – The roughness and conditions of life for the soldiers fighting in the Civil War took a toll on their uniforms and other clothing. There might not be immediate replacements for this garb. The soldiers would have a small sewing kit with them so they could repair their clothing. Often before leaving home to go off to fight, mothers, wives, sisters, or girlfriends would put together a sewing kit for their soldier. The sewing kit was called a “Housewife.” A simple but necessary item.\n\nHow come you so – This was booze made at home. The term also means being drunk, intoxicated, three sheets to the wind. An example usage, “I saw your momma at the church and she’s in a state of how come you so. She needs to go home and sleep it off. Have coffee and throw some hish hash together for when she wakes up.”\n\nHowitzer – A howitzer was a cannon that was lighter and had a shorter tube than other Civil War cannons. It shot a hollow exploding shell filled with balls. It used a smaller powder charge and threw its exploding shells with an arcing trajectory. Howitzers were usually made of bronze and came in three sizes in regards to shell size. There were 12, 24, and 34 pound howitzers. Howitzers were able to fire 12 pound anti-personnel shells up to 1,000 yards.\n\nTOP\n\nI\n\nIce Calks – These were small pieces of metal of various designs with pegs that were fastened to the bottom of horseshoes to help keep horses and mules from slipping in snow or ice. Consider Ice Calks as a Civil War version of the snow tires we use on our cars and trucks. They were meant to improve traction and grip for the animals in freezing weather.\n\nIllinois Baboon – A name used mockingly and derisively to describe President Abraham Lincoln who was from Springfield, Illinois.\n\nInflammation of the Lungs – This was pneumonia. Pneumonia killed many soldiers in the Civil War, it was the third most killing disease after typhoid and dysentery. Disease could spread like wildfire in the Civil War. Crowded living conditions or lack of protection from the elements, bad food, improper clothing, and unsanitary conditions all led to the spread of disease.\n\nInstant – This term was used in correspondence such as letters or reports, to refer to a day of the current month. An example would be that if a soldier wrote back home on September 20, 1862, after the Battle of Antietam which was fought on September 17:\n\n“Dear Maw and Paw,\n\nI was in a big battle near Sharpsburg, Maryland on the 17th instant. The battlefield was flooded with blood, so many were wounded or killed.”\n\nInsult – An offensive battle move. It was a fast, unhidden, and surprise attack on an enemy fortification in order to overwhelm, defeat, and capture the defenders before they could respond.\n\nInsurrection – President Abraham Lincoln used this term for the Civil War. Lincoln did not call the Civil War a “war” because he thought it would mean that he recognized the Confederacy as a separate country.\n\nInterior Lines – In a battle, the side having Interior Lines had an advantage because it could move its men and materiel around faster than the enemy could.\n\nPicture a common everyday round paper plate and you are on a picnic. While you are busy playing badminton there are two ants on your plate, one is at the outside top perimeter edge of the plate, he’s at 12:00. The other ant is on the inside middle of the plate where the clock hands are attached. Both ants want to get to your tater salad located on the right side edge of the paper plate at 4:00. The ants head off for your tater salad, each wants to take it for his own.\n\nWhich ant gets to the tater salad first? The ant on the inside middle where the clock hands are attached because it has a shorter distance to go. The ant on the outside top perimeter edge at 12:00 has a longer distance to go because he has the exterior or outside lines. He lost the race to the tater salad because the other ant had the Interior Lines.\n\nGeneral George G. Meade had an advantage over General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg because he had the Interior Lines.\n\nIronclad – An ironclad was a wooden ship protected on the outside with iron or steel plates. A wood ship was particularly vulnerable to explosive or incendiary shells fired from enemy ships. With the development and innovation of ironclads, the age of wooden warships was over. The era of modern day warships began with the Civil War ironclads.\n\nThe Battle of the Ironclads where the U.S.S.Monitor and the C.S.S. Virginia fought to a draw on March 9, 1862, off Hampton Roads, Virginia is the most famous Ironclad battle of the Civil War.\n\nTOP\n\nJ\n\nJackass Gun and the Jackass Regiment – This was a Howitzer pulled by mules over hard and rough mountainous land. Mules were preferred over horses for this hard work. The 1st Indiana Heavy Artillery was called the Jackass Regiment because its cannons were pulled by mules.\n\nJayhawkers and Border Ruffians – The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 added a very large area of territory which was now open for settlement in the United States. Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas created a bill that divided this area into two territories, namely Kansas and Nebraska.\n\nDouglas also came up with the idea of Popular Sovereignty. This meant that the people of these two new territories would decide whether or not to allow slavery in them when they eventually became states. This overturned the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and set the stage for Bleeding Kansas.\n\nPro-slavery Border Ruffians from Missouri and anti-slavery Kansas Territory Jayhawkers violently fought each other in a territorial civil war in order to gain the Popular Sovereignty majority advantage. Bleeding Kansas foreshadowed the Civil War.\n\nJefferson Davis – Jefferson Davis was the name of the Confederate president, but here the name is referring to a practice target used by the 4th Illinois Cavalry. This Jefferson Davis was a target made of wood with a life-size image of the real President Jefferson Davis painted on it.\n\nJoe Brown’s Pikes – Joseph E. Brown was the governor of Georgia. At the beginning of the Civil War the Confederacy was short of weapons. Joe Brown improvised by providing Georgia state troops without firearms with long poles that had a lance, a bayonet, or a knife fastened to them. These weapons were called “Joe Brown’s Pikes.”\n\nJohnny Shiloh – In June 1861, a small lad in Newark, Ohio gazed at Union troops marching through his town. Despite his too young age, he wanted to join up and fight in the Civil War. The boy’s name was John Joseph Klem, but the spelling of his name would change to Johnny Clem. Earlier, Clem had tried to enlist in the 3rd Ohio Infantry, but because of his age and small size he was turned away. Now Johnny trailed along with the 22nd Massachusetts as it marched through Newark.\n\nThe 22nd Massachusetts made Clem its mascot and drummer boy. A sawed-off rifle and a small uniform were provided to him, and officers of the Massachusetts unit pooled together to pay Johnny the regular soldier’s pay of thirteen dollars a month. Johnny was not yet even 10-years-old, but now he was a drummer (but, not necessarily a good one!), unofficially fighting for the Union. Two years later, Johnny Clem would be allowed to enlist. On May 1, 1863 Johnny officially became a musician in Company C, 22nd Michigan.\n\nJohnny Clem became known as “Johnny Shiloh” when, as a story goes, that young Clem was at the 1862 Shiloh battle and his drum was broken by an artillery projectile. Johnny then picked up a gun and joined in the fight as a combatant. This story was very popular and eventually a poem, a play, and a song were all named “The Drummer Boy of Shiloh.” Johnny Clem actually being at Shiloh however, is questionable history. History is a bit foggy here. There were others who claimed to be the actual “Drummer Boy of Shiloh.”\n\nJosh – A slang name for a Confederate soldier who was from Arkansas.\n\nJunk – Beef that was preserved by using very heavy salting. It may not have rotted, but it was awful to eat so soldiers called it “Junk.”\n\nTOP\n\nK\n\nKangaroo – Kangaroo was a horse left on the Shiloh battlefield by the Confederates. This scraggly looking horse was described as ugly and raw-boned. However, Union General Ulysses S. Grant, having an eye for horses, knew that Kangaroo was a thoroughbred. After becoming a Yankee horse, Kangaroo got rest and care, and became a fine horse for General Grant. Other horses Grant had in the Civil War besides Kangaroo were; Jack, Fox, and Cincinnati. Cincinnati was Grant’s favorite horse.\n\nKatydids – Katydids were men who had not yet experienced battle. For example, new cadets from the Virginia Military Institute were called Katydids.

This bullet was invented by Claude-Étienne Minié. It is often called the Minié ball, but it was not ball-shaped, it was in the shape of a bullet. The bottom base of the Minié bullet was hollowed out inside. When the gun fired, the gunpowder explosion would push gasses into the hollowed-out base of the Minié bullet, the pressure of the gas would expand the lead Minié bullet’s outer side into the rifling grooves of the gun barrel. This expansion caused the Minié bullet to “grip” the rifling grooves, thus creating spin. The Minié bullet increased the accuracy and distance of Civil War rifles.\n\nMinié bullets were lethal in the Civil War. Their soft lead would flatten out when it struck a human, bones would be shattered in ghastly ways, often splintering, and leading to amputation of an arm or leg. Minié bullets would mangle and destroy great areas of soft flesh and organs as they ripped through a human body.\n\nMinié bullets are often found for sale as souvenirs in shops located near Civil War battlefields.
