        "text": "Reference to the Goldener Adler\n\nKing Ludwig I. was very often in Innsbruck and several times a guest at the Goldener Adler, historians report:\n\n24-26.11.1804 arrival and presence of the Chur prince of Bavaria Ludwig Karl on his journey to Italy, he stayed at the Goldener Adler, Archduchess Maria Elisabeth of Austria had him invited to the Hofburg.\n\nAfter the dinner, the prince went to the city Hall in Tyrol to see the salt pans and the mint, on the following days he visited the theatre and Ambras Castle. In the evenings he enjoyed dancing at the Casino Ball, and on November 26 he left early in the morning.\n\nComing from Italy, Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria arrived on May 15, 1815. He disembarked at the Goldener Adler and went to Hötting and Weiherburg, and then continued his journey to Munich.\n\nHe also visited us three more times in 1829,1833 and 1841.\n\nHis second son Otto I. of Greece also stayed at the Goldener Adler in 1832.\n\nAnother guest of the Goldener Adler, famous Heinrich Heine, was not so well-disposed towards Ludwig. Ludwig tended to eccentricity, one expression of which was his poetry, for which the king was even teased by Heinrich Heine.\n\nAfter Ludwig had not awarded him the professorship, he had already thought certain of, Heine later covered the monarch with a whole series of mocking verses, one of them:\n\n“Mister Ludwig is a great poet, and when he sings, Apollo falls on his knees before him and begs and pleads, Stop! I’ll go mad otherwise, o!”\n\nToday’s excursion tip takes you to the town of Hall in Tyrol, 10 kilometres away, which King Ludwig I discovered for himself as early as 1804.\n\nHall was first mentioned in a document in 1232, and since the 13th century the salt mine in the Hall Valley formed the central industry of the town and the surrounding area.\n\nIn 1477, Archduke Sigmund moved the sovereign mint from Merano to Hall, and the town soon became one of the most important of the Habsburg dominions.\n\nToday you will find many sights there: the old town on the upper town square in a medieval ambience with the Gothic parish church of St. Nikolaus, as well as a mining museum with a walk-through gallery.\n\nIn the lower town, Hasegg Castle awaits you with the Mint Museum and the Mint Tower, here you can still mint your own coin.\n\nLife and facts\n\nLudwig I., born in Strasbourg, was the son of Maximilian I. Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Auguste Wilhelmine Maria of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nLudwig’s childhood and adolescence were defined by political instability (French Revolution, Coalition Wars) and flight.\n\nHe studied Spanish, French and Italian literature at the University of Landshut and in Göttingen. On October 12, 1810, he married the Protestant Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen (Prinzenhochzeit), thus also sealing the beginning of the Munich Octoberfest.\n\nIt was held for the first time on October 17, 1810. On their wedding, Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese held a large horse race on a meadow outside the city walls of Munich. The venue was named after the Princess “Theresienwiese”, which is where the dialectal name “Wiesn” for the Octoberfest comes from.\n\nIn 1811, the first child born was the heir to the throne, Maximilian, and the marriage produced a total of nine children. After the death of his father Maximilian I. Joseph on October 13, 1825, Ludwig was enthroned as Bavarian king.\n\nThe spelling of the country’s name Bayern (Bavaria) with “y”, which is the only one used today, goes back to an order by King Ludwig on October 20, 1825, with which the spelling “Baiern”, which had been the most common before, was replaced because of his ardent veneration of ancient Greece (philhellenism).\n\nUnder Ludwig, Munich became a widely respected city of art. In 1826 he had the Ludwig Maximilian University moved from Landshut to Munich.\n\nLudwig lived the last 20 years after his abdication as a private citizen and continued to support the arts from private funds. He died in a villa in Nice on February 29, 1868, at the age of 81.\n\nIn accordance with his wishes, he is buried in the Basilica of St. Boniface in Munich. His heart was buried separately and is in the Chapel of Grace in Altötting."
