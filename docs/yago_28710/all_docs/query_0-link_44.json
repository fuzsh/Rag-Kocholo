        "text": "A visit to the Wiesn in Munich is not complete without the right Oktoberfest hotel. Round off your Wiesn visit with a stay at the Platzl Hotel. As a 4-star superior hotel in the heart of Munich’s old district, the Platzl Hotel is perfect for a visit to the Oktoberfest. Local stylistic elements are combined with modern technology in 167 guest rooms and suites at the Platzl Hotel, providing an authentic feel-good environment for your stay.\n\nYou will also find the Platzl at the Oktoberfest itself: as well as being the owner of the Platzl, Peter Inselkammer is also the spokesman for the Wiesn hosts as well as a host in the traditional Armbrustschützenzelt. In short, the Platzl offers the most authentic Oktoberfest atmosphere you could wish for during your visit to the Oktoberfest.\n\nIn addition, the hotel’s central location makes it perfect for those who want to see more of the city during Oktoberfest. In the direct vicinity is the famous Hofbräuhaus, which will offer you a special form of hospitality. The Marienplatz, the Bavarian State Opera, Maximilianstraße and the Viktualienmarkt are all also within easy reach.\n\nFind more sights in Munich on our homepage.\n\nBook Oktoberfest Hotel\n\nFind your way to our Armbrustschützenzelt quickly and know where you are at all times!\n\nThe traditional Armbrustschützenzelt, with its total of 7,450 seats, is one of the biggest tents on the Theresienwiese in the heart of Munich. Inside, the tent is dominated by green and white cloths. While the tent’s facade resembles an alpine house, the tower is a reminder of its origins as a beer castle.\n\nThe tent of the “Winzerer Fähndl” guild has existed since 1895. The traditional German crossbow championships continue to take place here every year at Oktoberfest time. The tent has already possessed its own crossbow shooting range for 110 years.\n\nExperience the traditional ambiance in the Armbrustschützenzelt and celebrate with smooth Paulaner Wiesn beer, pork hocks and other treats. You will find the Armbrustschützenzelt to the north, directly between the Marstall-Festzelt and the Hofbräu-Festzelt.\n\nArmbrustschützenzelt\n\nDelicacies & German Championships\n\nSince 1895, the German Crossbow Shooting Championships have been held there during the Wiesn. The traditional Armbrustschützenzelt is designed in the style of a huge pre-Alpine house. The individual boxes are labelled with local animal names, such as Gams- or Wildsaubox.\n\nAugustiner Festhalle\n\nCordiality, family & tradition\n\nWiesn visitors are thrilled: sweet Augustiner beer from traditional wooden barrels! Families with children are welcome in the Augustiner tent.\n\nPschorr-Festzelt Bräurosl\n\nLet's go to the beautiful Rosi!\n\nDirectly in front of the main entrance, two 20-metre high maypoles tower into the sky - making the search for the Bräurosl a piece of cake. The festival hall is named after the daughter of the former Pschorr innkeeper and brewery owner - the beautiful Bräurosl, who was already the reason for one or two visitors back then.\n\nZur Fischer-Vroni\n\nSteckerlfisch and pink Monday\n\nIn addition to the usual Wiesn delicacies, there are numerous fresh fish dishes. The tent is easily recognisable by its familiar feature: a stork's nest on the roof gable. The Fischer-Vroni tent is not quite as noisy as the big beer tents. It also has a rustic, cosy atmosphere. An insider tip is the second Monday of the Wiesn, when the Bavarian lesbian and gay scene mingles there.\n\nHacker Festzelt\n\nWith the heaven of the Bavarians!\n\nWelcome to the Bavarian heaven! The tent is all in white and blue and decorated with a starry sky. Every year the Hacker Festzelt becomes a favourite of the people of Munich and attracts many young Wiesn visitors. The tent is also known for the most romantic grand final (“Kehraus”).\n\nHofbräu Festzelt\n\nInternational flair in the heart of Bavaria\n\nThe world-famous Munich Hofbräuhaus is also the second-largest Wiesn tent on the Theresienwiese at Oktoberfest time. The Hofbräu Festzelt is particularly popular with visitors from abroad. It offers space for more than 10,000 guests including a standing area in front of the music podium - all under the watchful eye of the angel Aloisuis, a larger-than-life figure who watches over the hustle and bustle.\n\nKäfer Wiesn-Schänke\n\nHome of the celebrities and the “chic” crowd\n\nThe Käfer Wiesn-Schänke is reminiscent of a Bavarian farm or even a mountain hut - cosy, rustic & quaint. Many prominent Wiesn guests come here every year. International high society is also a regular here. Fine delicacies from Feinkost Käfer are served and the famous Käfer Wiesn-Haferl is available as a souvenir.\n\nLöwenbräu Festzelt\n\nWhere the \"”Sechzger” meet tourists\n\nRight next to the famous tower is a 4.5-metre-tall roaring lion. Every minute he roars “Löööwenbräu” loudly, attracting a lot of attention. So you cannot miss the tent - neither visually nor acoustically.\n\nFestzelt Marstall\n\nThe youngest of the Wiesn tents, yet with tradition.\n\nSince 2014, the Marstall festival tent has been present on the Theresienwiese in place of the Hippodrom. The Able family welcomes its guests with a mixture of Bavarian cosiness and exuberant party atmosphere. Culinary delicacies, Spaten and Franziskaner beer make the tent a lasting Wiesn experience.\n\nOchsenbraterei\n\nNo ox remains anonymous\n\nA very special delicacy is served here! Right in front of the front of the Spatenbräu tent, a huge ox turns on a spit - a real invitation for hungry Wiesn visitors. All the oxen are personally selected from the Gut Karlshof by the host, and each ox is immortalised with its name on a plaque.\n\nSchotthammel-Festhalle\n\nThe traditional tapping - O'zapft is!\n\nThe Schottenhamel Festhalle has been at the Oktoberfest since 1867. It is therefore the oldest and most traditional festival tent at the Wiesn! This is where the official tapping takes place every year with the mayor and where by far the youngest audience celebrates.\n\nSchützenfestzelt\n\nWith the most beautiful view\n\nThe famous Schützenfest tent is located at the foot of the Bavaria. With a view of the Bavaria and the famous Ferris wheel from its magnificent balconies, it is the tent with the best view. The tent may be one of the smallest, but it still holds a lot of tradition: integrated into the tent are shooting stands where the Bavarian Sports Shooting Association holds a traditional Oktoberfest shooting competition every year.\n\nKuffler's Weinzelt\n\nSparkling wine, champagne & partying until 1 am. Wine lovers will also get their money's worth here: the best wines, sparkling wine and champagne en masse! There is no lager here, but Weissbier and the rustic wooden panelling is reminiscent of a Franconian vineyard. Instead of beer benches, you will find corner benches in separate wooden boxes. And you can even party here until 1am, so it is a welcome location when the rest of the tents close at 11.30pm.\n\nPaulaner Festzelt\n\nThe fastest beer dispenser at the Wiesn\n\nThe giant beer stein on top of the tent tower is the unmistakable landmark of the Paulaner Festzelt. Thanks to the south-facing sun terrace, you can sit comfortably and enjoy the most modern beer tapping system at the Wiesn, which serves up to 15 beers per minute."
