        "text": "A member of one of Europe's royal families has married in a lavish wedding ceremony fit for a King.\n\nWhile Prince Ludwig of Bavaria will never actually take the top job, due to Germany's monarchy being dissolved after World War One, the nuptials were a grand affair with all the trappings of a royal wedding.\n\nThe religious ceremony took place on Saturday in Munich at the Theatine Church before the reception inside the Nymphenburg Palace, the family's ancestral home.\n\nWatch the video above.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince William returns to schoolboy sport as he joins rowing team\n\nPrince Ludwig, 40, married his Dutch-Canadian fiancée, Sophie Evekink, 33, who wore the Bavarian sapphire tiara.\n\nThe headpiece has been in the groom's family for decades and has been worn by other women linked to the royal house.\n\nThe bridal gown was designed by Reem Acra while the veil was created by Ukrainian label WONÁ Concept, with integrated Bavarian, Canadian, and Dutch elements.\n\nEvekink – now known as Princess Sophie while in Bavaria – later changed into a light blue gown designed WONÁ Concept.\n\nIn lieu of gifts the couple asked their guests, which included royals from across Europe, to donate to humanitarian causes instead.\n\nREAD MORE: Harry's rep denies claims of 'escape place' for time away from Meghan\n\nHundreds of people lined the streets to see the bride and groom, who announced their engagement in August last year.\n\nPrince Ludwig will one day become the Duke of Bavaria and Head of the House of Wittelsbach.\n\nHe is the great-great grandson of the last King of Bavaria. His ancestor, King Ludwig III, ruled from 1913 to 1918 but lost his throne at the end of the first world war as the German Empire was dissolved.\n\nToday, descendants are only 'pretenders' to the defunct throne.\n\nREAD MORE: 'The coronation \"gaffes\" and rumours that need to be put to rest'\n\nPrince Ludwig's father, Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, is a first cousin of the ruling Franz, Duke of Bavaria, 89.\n\nBut Franz has never fathered children so will be succeeded by his brother, Prince Max of Bavaria, 86.\n\nPrince Max has five daughters but no sons and due to the law of male-preference primogeniture, the title will then pass to Prince Luitpold and his descendants, including Prince Ludwig and any future male heirs.\n\nThe groom has founded several non-profit organisations in Kenya and has also been trained in estate management at Nymphenburg Palace, as he will one day inherit it.\n\nAs for the bride, Princess Sophie previously worked for the United Nations on health and human rights.\n\nShe is currently researching for her doctorate at the Law Faculty at Oxford University.\n\nWhen the couple announced their engagement last year, Prince Ludwig's father said of the bride to be: \"Ludwig made a good choice. My future daughter-in-law is a very intelligent and educated woman\".\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here"
