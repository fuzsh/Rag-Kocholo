        "text": "For this year’s annual celebration in the fall, we are going to celebrate the first Oktoberfest, the wedding of Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen in 1810. The two were married on October 12th and we will be hosting our wedding party on Wed Sept 30th to Sat Oct 3rd.\n\nTickets will include Admission, on-site parking, and Entertainment. We will have live music each of the three nights. Oktoberfest is a major fundraiser for the Club as it helps cover expenses through the year and provides support through the Winter. Now this support is needed more than ever as we continue our recovery from being closed for three months and need to look at the rest of 2020.\n\nThur 10/1, & Sat 10/3 - $40.00 pp\n\nFri 10/2 - $50.00 pp\n\n(Ticket prices are for music-only admission and begin after 6:30 PM. Please note Wed 9/30’s event has been canceled)\n\nThese events are for members and their guest but tickets are available to the General Public. All non-members will receive a membership for the remainder of 2020. (Please fill out the Membership form after you have purchased your tickets. We hope you decide to join our Club once you visit for Wedding Feast!)\n\nAll current CDC / State / County and Social Distancing Guidelines will be followed. Masks are required for entry to the Grove and must be worn when not seated. (See more details below)\n\nWith the current restriction to 250 people for outdoor events, we have to set ticket prices to cover expenses to put on this year’s celebration in October. We will be limiting tickets to around 200 for each night and we ask all visitors to be over 21. These club hosted events will be similar to going out on a date with dinner, drinks, parking, and entertainment (Movies, Theater, or Concert).\n\nGet crazy and come dressed up in your favorite Oktoberfest character. Trachten wear is welcome or take it up a notch and come as wedding guest of the early 19th Century. We will have our own Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese and are planning re-enactments to go along with our schedule and theme!\n\nThur 10/1 - Their Engagement - Our second night will highlight their engagement. Ludwig’s father, King Maximilian I Joseph, had to request permission from Emperor Napoleon for his son to marry Therese. This proved not to be a problem as the King was one of Napoleon’s closest allies. Ludwig, on the other hand, detested Napoleon. Their engagement was announced on February 12th 1810 and was celebrated in Bavaria. Our Dinner options for Thursday will be either Goulashl w/ Noodles and Potato Salad or 1/2 Rotisserie Chicken w/ Potato Salad and Corn on the Cob.\n\nFri 10/2 - Their Wedding - Friday Night is going to be our version of October 12th 1810. Their engagement was only 10 months long and was a little earlier then Ludwig had wanted. He would liked to have waited until the beginning of the following year but feared Napoleon would marry him to a French candidate. This prompted him to marry in October. It proved to be a good choice as his bride’s and father-in-law’s birthdays were around the same time and it allowed the party to be a long one. Our Dinner options for Friday will be either Roast Pork w/ Potato Salad and Red Cabbage or 1/2 Rotisserie Chicken w/ Potato Salad and Corn on the Cob.\n\nSat 10/3 The Banquet - Our last night will be a feast to remember. Before and after the Wedding, the people of Bavaria celebrated the union of Ludwig and Therese outside the gates of Munich. The celebration was organized and partially funded by the 3rd Class of the Bavarian National Guard. There were balls, performances, parties, and the famous horse race created by Franz Baumgartner and Andreas Michael Dall’Armi. This turned out to be a huge success and helped Bavaria and King Joseph welcome their new acquisitions in Swabia and Franconia from Napoleon as well as recently annexed territory in Tyrol. Our Dinner options for Saturday will be either Brat Platter (Brat and Krainer) w/ Potato Salad and Sauerkraut or 1/2 Rotisserie Chicken w/ Potato Salad and Corn on the Cob."
