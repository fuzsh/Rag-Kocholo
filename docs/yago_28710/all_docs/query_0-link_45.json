        "text": "For Ludwig, art and politics were inseparably linked. As he once remarked in a speech, \"The works of the statesman will have long since passed, when those of the excellent artist are still uplifting.\" The monarch quickly realized that the small kingdom of Bavaria could not compete with world powers like England or France in terms of military might or economic strength. However, as a passionate art collector and patron, Ludwig transformed Munich into a city of the arts—an \"Athens on the Isar,\" as he liked to call it—that would stand unrivaled throughout Europe.\n\nBeyond expanding Munich into a royal capital, which required the urgent and prestigious remodeling of the residence, Ludwig saw his royal duty in patronage. He supported many young artists of his time with commissions and brought the expertise of established masters to Bavaria by offering them lucrative positions. Among others, he secured Leo von Klenze as court architect and Peter von Cornelius as director of the Akademie der Bildenden Künste (Academy of Fine Arts). These artistic leaders, in turn, attracted more artists and students to the city, leading to a flourishing cultural scene in Munich under Ludwig's consistent patronage.\n\nWhen it came to collecting art, Ludwig's motto was quality over quantity. Rather than amassing an abundance of second- and third-rate works, he focused on building a high-caliber, world-class collection—preferably at an affordable price. After all, he didn’t have the financial resources of Napoleon Bonaparte or Queen Victoria. Over the course of more than 50 years, Ludwig spent more than half of his private fortune on art, often making savings elsewhere, such as by cutting his wife's funds.\n\nHe also drove his art agents, especially Johann Martin von Wagner, to despair with his thriftiness. Nevertheless, Wagner went to great lengths for the monarchThanks to Wagner, Bavaria acquired antique treasures such as the sculpture Boy with a Goose and the Greek Aeginetes. The negotiations for the purchase of the Barberini Faun even dragged on for over 10 years due to the challenging political situation. Most of the antiquities Wagner secured were destined for the Glyptothek, Ludwig's museum dedicated to ancient art\n\nHis thriftiness often frustrated his art agents, especially Johann Martin von Wagner, yet Wagner still went to great lengths for the monarch. Thanks to Wagner, Bavaria acquired antique treasures such as the sculpture Boy with a Goose and the Greek Aeginetes. , which was the first of its kind in the West.\n\nUnlike his sister Auguste, Ludwig narrowly escaped a political marriage in accordance with Napoleon's wishes. He chose his bride Therese from the small Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen. The whole of Munich celebrated their wedding on October 12th 1810 with a lavish party - after all, it was the first royal wedding of the kingdom! The five-day celebrations ended with a horse race on a meadow outside the city, which was henceforth to be called \"Theresienwiese\" after the young bride. In the following years the public celebration of the wedding anniversary developed into the world-famous Oktoberfest.\n\nTherese and Ludwig were close, as the numerous letters between the two lovers prove. They had nine children together, including the future kings Maximilian II. Joseph of Bavaria and Otto I of Greece. However, Ludwig not only appreciated art, but also beautiful women. Throughout his life, the king indulged in numerous affairs, which repeatedly put his marriage to the test. In particular, a set of 38 paintings of the \"fairest of the fair sex\", which Joseph Karl Stieler was commissioned for Ludwig's Gallery of Beauty (you can take a look for yourself at Nymphenburg Palace), were the subject of numerous rumours about the king's dalliances.\n\nOnly one of his many rumoured affairs has been confirmed by historians. But this one ultimately became his undoing: Ludwig's love affair with the provocative dancer Lola Montez made Munich's blood boil. Lola, whose real name was Elizabeth Rosanna Gilbert, was the daughter of an Irish officer. She made waves by posing as aristocratic lady from Seville and performing provocative made-up Spanish folk dances throughout European Cities. Scandals followed her at every turn. Her exotic beauty cast a spell over the 60-year-old king. It is said that he even kept a marble replica of her foot on his private desk. From then on, he did everything he could to please his mistress: Whether it was arranged dance performances at the Munich court theatre, a palace of her own complete with staff and personal protection, her naturalization as a Bavarian citizen or her elevation to the nobility - Ludwig tended to each and every of Lola's desires against the council of his ministers and spent a whole lot of money along the way. Queen Therese also protested resolutely, albeit in vain. The false Spaniard was hated by the royal subjects: Ludwig's irrational behaviour and Lola's interference in Bavarian politics were criticised in numerous caricatures and lampoons.\n\nRevolutionary ideas had been simmering in Munich for quite some time. In January 1848, there was a clash between the student fraternity \"Allemannen\", which was closely associated with Lola and provided her unofficial bodyguard, and other students. As a result, the king felt compelled to close the university, which triggered further riots. The citizens' hatred was particularly directed at Lola, who fled to Switzerland in February. When the March Revolution broke out, Lola Montez was probably just the last straw that broke the camel's back. Among other things, the liberal revolutionaries demanded freedom of the press and a constitutional amendment giving ministers more powers. Ludwig was forced to agree. This severely curtailed his power as king - he had previously ruled autocratically. In the same month, he abdicated in favour of his son Maximilian Joseph. Ludwig spent the last twenty years as a private citizen until he died in his winter residence in Nice on February 29th 1868 at the age of 81."
