        "text": "By Ben Mackin\n\nPublished June 28, 2024\n\nThe fall is quickly approaching. The sun is going down earlier, the temperature is starting to cool, and all over Kentucky people are getting their lederhosen and beer steins ready for Oktoberfest.\n\nOriginating in Munich, Germany in the early 1800s, Oktoberfest started as a celebration of the wedding between Ludwig I of Bavaria and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. In the two centuries since, the fest has transformed into a world-famous celebration of culture and community and is attended by thousands every year.\n\nThanks to droves of Germans immigrating to the United States over the years, German-American communities all over the nation have put on their own Oktoberfests. Here are some of the Oktoberfests held in Kentucky that you don’t want to miss.\n\nLouisville:\n\nGerman American Club Oktoberfest | First weekend in September\n\nThis annual family-friendly event is the biggest of the year for the German American Club, which is dedicated to promoting German culture and sociability. The festival features a variety of traditional foods and beverages for sale, including German potato salad, green beans, sauerkraut balls, schweinshaxe (roasted pork knuckle), pretzels, spätzle (a mac-n-cheese vegetarian dish) and schnitzel (breaded pork chops), along with things like grilled bratwurst with sauerkraut and red cabbage.\n\nGermantown Oktoberfest | Last Friday in September\n\nWith a name like Germantown, how could this neighborhood in southeast Louisville not have an Oktoberfest? This celebration has all the trappings of a great German fest, beer, traditional food, music, and, competitions like stein hoisting and wiener dog races.\n\nSteins on Main | Last Saturday in September\n\nLouisville Downtown Partnership, Louisville Ale Trail, and Against the Grain Brewery put their steins together to transform a block on Main Street into an all-new Oktoberfest to celebrate Louisville’s rich German heritage. This party is free and family-friendly and it features beers from several local breweries.\n\nNorthern Kentucky:\n\nCovington Oktoberfest | September 13-15\n\nHeld annually since 1979 in Goebel Park, this fest is three days full of incredible amazing local food and craft vendors, live music, interactive activities, competitions, and locally brewed beers.\n\nNewport Oktoberfest | Last Saturday in September\n\nNewport Oktoberfest is designed to match the one in Munich with large fest tents full of food, drinks, and music. Festival revelers can also enjoy shopping wares in the Bluegrass Marketplace and partake in a beer-stein-holding competition or yodeling contest.\n\nCentral Kentucky\n\nMaysville Oktoberfest | First weekend in August\n\nFamilies of all kinds can enjoy a variety of children and adult events. Come dressed in traditional German and Bavarian costumes are encouraged as you surround yourself in a mix of German and Kentucky culture. There will be traditional fare as well as German music, dancing and a wiener dog race. On top of all that, if you play your cards right you may end up being a part of the Royal Court.\n\nHarrodsburg Oktoberfest| Last weekend in September\n\nHarrodsburg’s Oktoberfest is on the biggest in central Kentucky, drawing crowds of up to 15,000 in recent years. Hosted in the city’s historic downtown area festival-goers can expect three days of free concerts as well as local beers, specialty foods, and family fun."
