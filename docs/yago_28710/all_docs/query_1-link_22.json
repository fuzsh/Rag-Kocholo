        "text": "Political Involvement\n\nDuring her husband's reign as king of Bavaria, Therese showed interest in state affairs and was considered a political companion to her husband.[5] Whenever Ludwig was away from Munich, she would inform him about court and country events. In March of 1830, she collected newspaper articles from both the French Journal de DÃ©bats and various German newspapers in order to bring Ludwig's attention to the emerging July Revolution. She believed that the king should know everything that was going on in his country. She also kept their son Otto, who was in Greece, informed about political events going on back home. When Otto was elected King of Greece in 1832, she urged her husband to consult and listen to Otto on the matter. Further, she warned Ludwig I about the scholar Friedrich Thiersch whom she considered too liberal, and the painter Karl Wilhelm von Heydeck, whom she considered unpopular in Greece.[6]\n\nThere are many political letters written from the Queen to Ludwig I stored in the house archives of the Wittelbachs, the content of which has yet to be evaluated.[7]\n\nCharity and Social Work\n\nOn the anniversary of the Battle of the Leipzig in 1814, Therese von Saxen-Hildburghausen organized a feeding for the poor and thereby became a patron of the Salzburg Women's Association.[8] In 1827, Therese founded Theresienorden, a distinguished order for women of Bavaria, whose aim was to provide for the poor .[9]\n\nShe was also heavily involved in the Women's Association for Day Nurseries[10] and was quite close with one of the founders, Auguste Escherisch.[11] She described her as a simple woman of the people.Therese had to obtain the Kings permission to interact with her, and during a visit to Auguste Escherisch's house, the Queen confessed to having never seen a kitchen before and was consequently instructed on how to use pots and pans.[12]"
