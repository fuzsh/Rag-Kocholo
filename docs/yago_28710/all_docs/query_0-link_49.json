        "text": "The recently opened hotel introduces five unique Houses, setting a new standard for luxury accommodations in the destination.\n\nRosewood Munich is redefining the luxury hotel experience in Munich with the introduction of five extraordinary Houses: König Maximilian I House, Prinzessin Augusta House, Prinzregent Luitpold House, König Ludwig I House, and Prinzessin Ferdinande House. The names of each House pay homage to the illustrious history of the Bavarian royal family, infusing the hotel’s ambiance with a touch of regional charm and cultural heritage while offering exclusive spaces for overnight experiences, private occasions, and intimate events.\n\nTara Bernerd & Partners reimagined the interior design of the rooms, suites, houses, lobby lounge, Palaishof, and Asaya Spa at Rosewood Munich with a harmonious blend of Bavarian tradition and modern flair through the skillful combination of contemporary forms, eccentric furniture, and vibrant color palettes of velvet, tweed, and leather. The spaces captivate the contrasting character of old and new Munich in a fascinating manner.\n\nEach House features personalized butler service, exquisite furnishings, and select works by local artists such as Olaf Hajek. A curated assortment of furniture and classical architectural elements charmingly evoke the inviting character of a traditional Bavarian home, with unique elements including traditional Nymphenburg porcelain, adding sophistication and artistic flair to the décor while reflecting the overarching idea of the brand’s guiding A Sense of Place® philosophy. The suites are adorned with a curated selection of historical literature on the namesakes of the Houses to provide guests with further insight into the destination and history of Wittelsbach. At Rosewood Munich, tradition and modern luxury intertwine in a unique manner, and the spacious accommodations and high-end amenities offer the feel of an urban oasis in a bustling metropolis.\n\nThe König Maximilian I. House is named for King Maximilian I. Joseph, the first king of Bavaria in 1806, and is the largest suite at Rosewood Munich. The signature suite features a bright, wood-paneled living area, fully equipped kitchen, inviting courtyard balcony, and large dining table that can accommodate up to 12 pax. The House can integrate three additional suites, welcoming up to eight guests to fully enjoy the accommodations and its spacious facilities.\n\nPrincess Augusta Wilhelmine Marie of Hesse-Darmstadt, to whom the second-largest Prinzessin Augusta House is dedicated, was married to King Maximilian I and is one-of-a-kind accommodation at Rosewood Munich. The elegant bedroom, Italian marble-adorned bathroom, and private rooftop terrace that showcases a spectacular view over the beautiful old town of Munich and the imposing Frauenkirche offer a unique sanctuary for the senses, a place of relaxation and indulgence. The spacious living and dining area, along with a cozy fireplace, sets the stage for unforgettable gatherings. With space for up to ten guests at the dining table, the House also provides a stylish ambiance for smaller events, making every visit an unparalleled experience.\n\nPrince Regent Luitpold, son of King Ludwig I and Princess Therese, was born during a time of great cultural flourishing in Munich. In this elegant Prinzregent Luitpold House, tailored design and a beautiful outdoor terrace merge into a harmonious concept, elevating luxury to a new level. The House features an elegant bedroom, spacious walk-in closet, and stylish marble bathroom, all of which contribute to create a sophisticated retreat. A fully equipped kitchenette allows a residential feel, making guests feel right at home, with an intimate living area and dining table that fits up to eight people.\n\nKönig Ludwig I. House offers unparalleled style and elegance, paying homage to the start of the iconic Oktoberfest tradition with the marriage of King Ludwig I of Bavaria and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen in 1810. The exquisite accommodation occupies the top floor of Rosewood Munich, featuring high ceilings and large windows, along with a spacious bedroom and marble-adorned bathroom with a double sink and inviting bathtub for guests to enjoy. The generous living area invites guests to linger and offers space for convivial evenings or relaxed moments in front of the cozy fireplace. A focal point of the House includes the expansive outdoor terrace, which offers an impressive view of the city and some of Munich's most famous landmarks. Adorning the terrace are two spectacular statues, three meters in height, originating from the building's original façade. Each sculpture embodies an allegorical representation of Bavaria: the feminine figure with a gear symbolizes the dynamism of industry, while the one with the spindle and beehive embodies the fundamental values of virtue and diligence.\n\nThe Prinzessin Ferdinande House pays homage to Augusta Ferdinande of Austria, the Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Tuscany. She married Prince Regent Luitpold on April 15, 1844, despite his father initially opposing his son's marriage plans, and enjoyed a harmonious marriage. The House offers the ultimate in luxurious living, with each space of residence embodying a harmonious blend of modern elegance and urban luxury. The comfortable bedroom is complemented by a spacious walk-in closet that meets the highest standards of style and functionality. A key focal point of the House is an impressive floating glass bridge, offering a one-of-a-kind design and breathtaking view of Salvatorstraße. The light-filled glass bridge, which was once connected to the Salvatore parking lot, spotlights the encaptivating story of the historic hotel, and makes the accommodation a truly special place for guests to visit and enjoy.\n\nWith the introduction of extraordinary Houses, Rosewood Munich sets new standards for exclusive living in the Bavarian capital, welcoming guests into a world of refined elegance and historic charm.\n\nAll Houses can be connected with additional suites.
