        "text": "Duchess Helene in Bavaria (April 4, 1834 – May 16, 1890), nicknamed Néné, was the Hereditary Princess of Thurn and Taxis as the wife of Prince Maximilian of Thurn and Taxis.\n\nShe was a Duchess in Bavaria by birth as the daughter of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria and his wife Princess Ludovika of Bavaria.\n\nFamily\n\nDuchess Helene in Bavaria’s father, Duke Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria (4 December 4, 1808 – November 15, 1888), known informally as Max in Bayern, was a member of a junior branch of the royal House of Wittelsbach who were Kings of Bavaria. He is most famous today as the father of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (“Sisi”) and great-grandfather of King Leopold III of the Belgians.\n\nDuke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria was born at Bamberg, the only son of Duke Pius August in Bavaria (1786–1837) and his wife, Princess Amélie Louise of Arenberg (1789–1823). On September 9, 1828, at Tegernsee, Duke Maximilian Joseph married Princess Ludovika of Bavaria, the sixth daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, his father’s cousin. They had ten children.\n\nPrincess Amélie Louise of Arenberg was the only daughter of Prince Louis of Arenberg (1757–1795) and his first wife, Marie Adélaïde Julie de Mailly-Nesle, Dame d’Ivry-sur-Seine (1766–1789).\n\nPrincess Ludovika of Bavaria was born to King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Caroline of Baden as their fifth child. The birth of Princess Ludovika was known to be difficult. Ludovika was christened one day after her birth as Ludovika Wilhelmine.\n\nLudovika and her sisters received many lessons in literature as well as geography and history. They both spoke German and French.\n\nPrincess Caroline of Baden was the eldest child of Prince Charles Ludwig, Hereditary Prince of Baden, and his wife Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt. She was born 13 July 1776, twin sister of Katharina Amalie Christiane Luise.\n\nPrincess Caroline was considered as a bride for Louis Antoine Henri de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien, but the fear of attracting opposition from France made her family hesitate.\n\nMarriage prospects\n\nIn 1853 Princess Helene in Bavaria traveled with her mother, Ludovika, and her younger sister Elisabeth to Bad Ischl, Upper Austria for the birthday of her cousin, Franz Joseph I, then the Emperor of Austria. During this visit, Franz Joseph asked for Elisabeth’s hand in marriage.\n\nHistorical accounts often contain the assertion that according to a plan by the two mothers, Franz Joseph was to be engaged to Helene instead. However, recent source investigations have shown that there is no written evidence to support this claim. Neither in the correspondence of Archduchess Sophie nor in the surviving correspondence of Duchess Ludovika are there indications of a planned engagement in Bad Ischl.\n\nBy 22 years old, Helene was not yet married, and Ludovika became concerned that her incredibly pious daughter would take the veil and join a convent. Therefore, Ludovika arranged for her to meet the wealthy Maximilian Anton, Hereditary Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Duke Maximillian Joseph, Helene’s father, invited the Thurn and Taxis family to Possenhofen for a hunting party, at which Prince Maximilian was introduced to Helene.\n\nMaximilian was born on 28 September 1831 in Regensburg, Kingdom of Bavaria to Maximilian Karl, 6th Prince of Thurn and Taxis and Baroness Wilhelmine of Dörnberg.\n\nWhile the prince was vacationing at Possenhofen, he brought his marriage plans to his parents, who immediately agreed. The only difficulty involved was that, although the Thurn and Taxis family were counted among the richest in the land, they were not considered social equals for a princess of royal blood and a member of the House of Wittelsbach. Because of this, King Maximilian II of Bavaria, who was a cousin of Helene, did not at first agree to a marriage between the two, but through Elisabeth’s influence on the king, the marriage took place nevertheless.\n\nMarriage (1858)\n\nThe wedding ceremony was held on August 24, 1858 at Possenhofen Castle. To mark the occasion, the in-laws gave the bride a necklace worth 160,000 Gulden.[citation needed] In spite of the earlier objections to the match, Helene is considered to have had the only happy marriage among the five Wittelsbach sisters.\n\nCaroline of Baden (July 13, 1776 – November 13, 1841) was by marriage an Electress of Bavaria and later the first Queen consort of Bavaria by marriage to Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria.\n\nEarly life\n\nCaroline of Baden was the eldest child of Charles Ludwig, Hereditary Prince of Baden, and his wife Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt, the daughter of Ludwig IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Henriette Caroline of Palatine-Zweibrücken. Caroline was born July 13, 1776, twin sister of Catharina Amalie Christiane Luise of Baden.\n\nCaroline of Baden, Queen of Bavaria\n\nCaroline was considered as a bride for Louis Antoine Henri de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien, but the fear of attracting opposition from France made her family hesitate.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn March 9, 1797, in Karlsruhe, she became the second spouse of Maximilian, Duke of Palatine-Zweibrücken from 1795 to 1799. Two years later would inherit the Electorate of Bavaria and became Prince-Elector as Maximilian IV Joseph from 1799 to 1806. He was a member of the House of Palatinate-Birkenfeld-Zweibrücken, a branch of the House of Wittelsbach.\n\nMaximilian’s first wife was Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt, daughter of Prince Georg Wilhelm of Hesse-Darmstadt. They were married on September 30, 1785 in Darmstadt. In March 1796 Augusta Wilhelmine, who had always had delicate lungs, finally succumbed and died at Rohrbach. She was buried in the Schlosskirche in Darmstadt.\n\nAs a result of the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the rank of Elector became obsolete, and the ruler of Bavaria was promoted to the rank of King. As a result, Caroline became Queen of Bavaria. Caroline had seven children with her husband, including two pairs of twins, an interesting occurrence considering Caroline was also a twin herself.\n\nCaroline was allowed to keep her Protestant religion and had her own Protestant pastor, which was unique for a Bavarian queen. She was described as a very dignified consort and hostess of the Bavarian court and raised her daughters to have a strong sense of duty.\n\nDeath and funeral\n\nCaroline of Baden died November 13, 1841, outliving her husband by sixteen years and one month. Due to her Protestant religion, her funeral was conducted with so little royal dignity that there were public protests.\n\nBy order of the Catholic archbishop of Munich, Lothar Anselm von Gebsattel, all participating Catholic clergy were dressed in ordinary clothes instead of church vestments. The Protestant clergy were halted at the church door and not allowed to proceed inside for the service, so Ludwig Friedrich Schmidt gave the funeral sermon there.\n\nAfterward, the funeral procession dissipated, and the coffin was placed in the burial crypt without ceremony. This treatment of his beloved stepmother permanently softened the attitude of Caroline’s stepson King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who up until that time had been a strong opponent of Protestantism despite his marriage to the Protestant Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen.\n\nOne of Caroline’s daughters was Princess Sophie of Bavaria (January 27, 1805 – May 28, 1872) Sophie was the identical twin sister of Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria, Queen of Saxony as wife of Friedrich August II of Saxony.\n\nSophie was said to be her father’s favorite daughter although she was more attached to her mother, Caroline, whom she loved dearly. Sophie adored her twin sister Maria Anna and was very close to all her sisters.\n\nOn November 4, 1824, Sophie married Archduke Franz Charles of Austria. Her paternal half-sister, Caroline Augusta of Bavaria, had married the groom’s widowed father, the last Holy Roman Emperor, Franz II, in 1816. Sophie and Franz Charles had six children, among them were, her eldest son Franz Joseph who reigned as Emperor of Austria, and King of Hungary; her second son was Maximilian briefly reigned as Emperor of Mexico.\n\nThe Crown of the King of Bavaria is a part of the Bavarian Crown Jewels and was ordered and designed between 1804–1807 for Maximilian I after Napoleon had raised Bavaria to kingdom status.\n\nThe Crown of Bavaria\n\nMaximilian I Joseph (May 27, 1756 – October 13, 1825) was Duke of Zweibrücken from 1795 to 1799, Prince-Elector of Bavaria (as Maximilian IV Joseph) from 1799 to 1806, then King of Bavaria (as Maximilian I Joseph) from 1806 to 1825. He was a member of the House of Palatinate-Birkenfeld-Zweibrücken, a branch of the House of Wittelsbach.\n\nOn April 1, 1795, Maximilian succeeded his brother Duke Charles II August as Duke of Zweibrücken, however his duchy was entirely occupied by revolutionary France at the time.\n\nMaximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria, Elector of Bavaria, Count Palatine of the Rhine\n\nOn February 16, 1799, he became Elector of Bavaria and Count Palatine of the Rhine, Arch-Steward of the Empire, and Duke of Berg upon the extinction of the Palatinate-Sulzbach line at the death of Elector Charles IV Theodore of Bavaria.\n\nThe new elector Maximilian IV Joseph found the Bavarian army in abject condition on his accession to the throne: Hardly any of the units were at full strength, the Rumford uniforms were unpopular and impractical, and the troops were badly-trained. The young Prince-Elector, who had served under the Ancien Régime in France as a colonel in the Royal Deux-Ponts regiment, made the reconstruction of the army a priority.\n\nMaximilian’s sympathy with France and the ideas of enlightenment at once manifested itself when he acceded to the throne of Bavaria. In the newly organized ministry, Count Max Josef von Montgelas, who, after falling into disfavour with Charles IV Theodore, had acted for a time as Maximilian IV Joseph’s private secretary, was the most potent influence, wholly “enlightened” and French.\n\nElector Charles IV Theodore of Bavaria, Count Palatine of the Rhine\n\nCreation of the Kingdom of Bavaria\n\nOn December 30, 1777, the main line of the Bavarian Wittelsbachs became extinct, and the succession to the Electorate of Bavaria passed to Charles IV Theodore, the Elector Palatine of the Rhine. After a separation of four and a half centuries, the Palatinate, to which the duchies of Jülich and Berg had been added, was thus reunited with Bavaria.\n\nUpon the succession of Charles IV Theodore, now both the Electorate of Bavaria and the Palatine of the Rhine, the title and authority of the two Electorates were combined, with Charles IV Theodore and his heirs retaining only the one vote and precedence as the Bavarian elector, although subsequent monarchs continued to use the title ‘Count Palatine of the Rhine.’\n\nIn 1792, French revolutionary armies overran the Palatinate; in 1795, the French, under Moreau, invaded Bavaria itself, advanced to Munich—where they were received with joy by the long-suppressed Liberals—and laid siege to Ingolstadt.\n\nCharles IV Theodore, who had done nothing to prevent wars or to resist the invasion, fled to Saxony, leaving a regency, the members of which signed a convention with Moreau, by which he granted an armistice in return for a heavy contribution on September 7, 1796. Between the French and the Austrians, Bavaria was now in a bad situation. Before the death of Charles IV Theodore (16 February 1799), the Austrians had again occupied the country, in preparation for renewing the war with France.\n\nMaximilian IV Joseph, the new elector, succeeded to a difficult inheritance. Though his own sympathies, and those of his all-powerful minister, Maximilian von Montgelas, were, if anything, French rather than Austrian, the state of the Bavarian finances, and the fact that the Bavarian troops were scattered and disorganized, placed him helpless in the hands of Austria.\n\nMaximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria\n\nOn December 2, 1800, the Bavarian armies were involved in the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden, and Moreau once more occupied Munich. By the Treaty of Lunéville (February 9 1801), Bavaria lost the Palatinate and the duchies of Zweibrücken and Jülich. In view of the scarcely disguised ambitions and intrigues of the Austrian court, Montgelas now believed that the interests of Bavaria lay in a frank alliance with the French Republic; he succeeded in overcoming the reluctance of Maximilian IV Joseph; and, on August 24, a separate treaty of peace and alliance with France was signed at Paris.\n\nIn foreign affairs, Maximilian IV Joseph’s attitude was, from the German point of view, less commendable. He never had any sympathy with the growing sentiment of German nationality, and his attitude was dictated by wholly dynastic, or at least Bavarian, considerations. His reward came with the Treaty of Pressburg (26 December 1805), by the terms of which he was to receive the royal title and important territorial acquisitions in Swabia and Franconia to round off his kingdom. He assumed the title of king on 1 January 1806. On March 15, he ceded the Duchy of Berg to Napoleon’s brother-in-law Joachim Murat.\n\nThe King still served as an Elector until Bavaria seceded from the Holy Roman Empire on August 1, 1806. The Duchy of Berg was ceded to Napoleon only in 1806. The new kingdom faced challenges from the outset of its creation, relying on the support of Napoleonic France.\n\nUntil 1813, he was the most faithful of Napoleon’s German allies, the relationship cemented by the marriage of his eldest daughter, Princess Augusta of Bavaria, to Eugène de Beauharnais, Napoleon’s stepson.\n\nThe new King of Bavaria was the most important of the princes belonging to the Confederation of the Rhine, and remained Napoleon’s ally until the eve of the Battle of Leipzig, when by the Treaty of Ried (October 8, 1813) he made the guarantee of the integrity of his kingdom the price of his joining the Allies. On 14 October, Bavaria made a formal declaration of war against Napoleonic France.\n\nCrown of Bavaria\n\nThe Crown of Bavaria was commissioned to the French goldsmith Jean-Baptiste de Lasne, who drew inspiration from the crown of Louis XV of France. Maximilian’s alliance with Emperor Napoleon earned him the royal title and vast territorial increases at the Treaty of Pressburg (1805). This made him one of the chief members of the Confederation of the Rhine.\n\nMaximilian I ordered the regalia which can be seen today in the Treasury at the Residenz in Munich. Made by Biennais, the most famous French goldsmith of the day, the Royal Crown of Bavaria is set with rubies, diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and pearls. The Wittelsbach Diamond was removed and sold in 1931 by the Wittelsbach family.\n\nLike other royal insignia, the crown was not worn by the sovereign. It was placed on a cushion during official ceremonies.\n\nLinderhof Palace (German: Schloss Linderhof) is a Schloss in Germany, in southwest Bavaria near Ettal Abbey. It is the smallest of the three palaces built by King Ludwig II of Bavaria and the only one which he lived to see completed.\n\nLudwig II (August 25, 1845 – 13 June 1886) was King of Bavaria from 1864 until his death in 1886. He is sometimes called the Swan King or der Märchenkönig (“the Fairy Tale King”). He also held the titles of Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria, Duke of Franconia, and Duke in Swabia.\n\nBorn at Nymphenburg Palace, he was the elder son of the then Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Bavaria, who became King Maximilian II of Bavaria Queen Marie in 1848 after the abdication of the former’s father, Ludwig I, during the German Revolution.\n\nLudwig’s mother, Marie of Prussia, was a daughter of Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, (a younger brother of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia) and his wife Landgravine Marie Anna of Hesse-Homburg.\n\nHis parents intended to name him Otto, but his grandfather insisted that his grandson be named after him, since their common birthday, August 25, is the feast day of Saint Louis IX of France, patron saint of Bavaria (with “Ludwig” being the German form of “Louis”). His younger brother, born three years later, was named Otto.\n\nLudwig II commissioned the construction of two lavish palaces and Neuschwanstein Castle, and he was a devoted patron of the composer Richard Wagner. Ludwig spent all his royal revenues (although not state funds as is commonly thought) on these projects, borrowed extensively, and defied all attempts by his ministers to restrain him. This extravagance was used against him to declare him insane, an accusation which has since come under scrutiny. Today, his architectural and artistic legacy includes many of Bavaria’s most important tourist attractions.\n\nDevelopment of the building\n\nLudwig already knew the area around Linderhof from his youth when he had accompanied his father King Maximilian II on his hunting trips in the Bavarian Alps. When Ludwig II became King in 1864, he inherited the so-called Königshäuschen from his father, and in 1869 began enlarging the building. In 1874, he decided to tear down the Königshäuschen and rebuild it on its present-day location in the park. At the same time three new rooms and the staircase were added to the remaining U-shaped complex, and the previous wooden exterior was clad with stone façades. The building was designed in the style of the second rococo-period. Between 1863 and 1886, a total of 8,460,937 marks was spent constructing Linderhof.\n\nSymbolic background\n\nAlthough Linderhof is much smaller than Versailles, it is evident that the palace of the French Sun-King Louis XIV (who was an idol for Ludwig) was its inspiration. The staircase, for example, is a reduction of the famous Ambassador’s staircase in Versailles, which would be copied in full in Herrenchiemsee. Stylistically, however, the building and its decor take their cues from the mid-18th century Rococo of Louis XV, and the small palace in the Graswang was more directly based on that king’s Petit Trianon on the Versailles grounds.\n\nThe symbol of the sun that can be found everywhere in the decoration of the rooms represents the French notion of absolutism that, for Ludwig, was the perfect incorporation of his ideal of a God-given monarchy with total royal power. Such a monarchy could no longer be realised in Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century. The bedroom was important to the ceremonial life of an absolute monarch; Louis XIV of France used to give his first (lever) and last audience (coucher) of the day in his bedchamber. In imitation of Versailles, the bedroom is the largest chamber of Linderhof Palace. By facing north, however, the Linderhof bedroom inverts the symbolism of its Versailles counterpart, showing Ludwig’s self-image as a “Night-King.”\n\nThe location of the palace near Ettal Abbey again presents another interesting point. Because of its architecture Ludwig saw the church of the monastery as the room where the holy grail was preserved. This fact connects the idea of a baroque palace to the one of a “medieval” castle such as Neuschwanstein and reminds of the operas of Richard Wagner whose patron Ludwig was. Ludwig was also not unaware that the abbey had been founded by his ancestor and namesake, Holy Roman Emperor Ludwig IV.\n\nIn 1878, construction was completed on Ludwig’s Schloss Linderhof. The grounds contained a Venus grotto lit by electricity, where Ludwig was rowed in a boat shaped like a shell. Ludwig saw himself as the “Moon King”, a romantic shadow of the earlier “Sun King”, Louis XIV of France. From Linderhof, Ludwig enjoyed moonlit sleigh rides in an elaborate eighteenth-century sleigh, complete with footmen in eighteenth century livery.\n\nUnlike the majority of German Monarchs that abdicated at the end of World War I, Ludwig III of Bavaria was deposed.\n\nIn 1917, when Germany’s situation had gradually worsened due to World War I, Bavarian Prime Minister Georg von Hertling became German Chancellor and Prime Minister of Prussia and Otto Ritter von Dandl was made Minister of State of the Royal Household and of the Exterior and President of the Council of Ministers on 11 November 1917, a title equivalent to Prime Minister of Bavaria. Accused of showing blind loyalty to Prussia, King Ludwig III became increasingly unpopular during the war. As the war drew to a close, the German Revolution broke out in Bavaria.\n\nOn November 2, 1918, an extensive constitutional reform was established by an agreement between the royal government and all parliamentary groups, which, among other things, envisaged the introduction of proportional representation. Ludwig III, approved on the same day the transformation of the constitution into a parliamentary monarchy. For the first time on November 3, 1918, initiated by the USPD, a thousand people gathered to protest on the Theresienwiese for peace and demanded the release of detained leaders.\n\nOn November 7, 1918, Ludwig III fled from the Residenz Palace in Munich with his family and took up residence in Schloss Anif, near Salzburg Austria for what he hoped would be a temporary stay. He was the first of the monarchs in the German Empire to be deposed. The next day, the People’s State of Bavaria was proclaimed.\n\nOn November 12, 1918, a day after the Armistice, Prime Minister Dandl went to Schloss Anif to see the King. Ludwig gave Dandl the Anif declaration (Anifer Erklärung) in which he released all government officials, soldiers and civil officers from their oath of loyalty to him. He also stated that as a result of recent events, he was “no longer in a position to lead the government.” The declaration was published by the newly formed republican government of Kurt Eisner when Dandl returned to Munich the next day.\n\nLudwig III’s declaration was not a statement of abdication, as Dandl had demanded. However, Eisner’s government interpreted it as such and added a statement that Ludwig and his family were welcome to return to Bavaria as private citizens as long as they did not act against the “people’s state.” This statement effectively dethroned the Wittelsbachs and ended the family’s 738-year rule over Bavaria.\n\nFinal years\n\nLudwig III returned to Bavaria. His wife, Maria Theresia, died 3 February 1919 at Wildenwart Castle/Chiemgau. In February 1919, Eisner was assassinated; fearing that he might be the victim of a counter-assassination, Ludwig fled to Hungary, later moving on to Liechtenstein and Switzerland. He returned to Bavaria in April 1920 and lived at Wildenwart Castle again. There he remained until September 1921 when he took a trip to his castle Nádasdy in Sárvár in Hungary. He died there on October 18.\n\nOn November 5, 1921, Ludwig’s body was returned to Munich together with that of his wife. In spite of fears a state funeral might spark a move to restore the monarchy, the pair were honored with one in front of the royal family, Bavarian government, military personnel, and an estimated 100,000 spectators. Burial was in the crypt of the Munich Frauenkirche alongside their royal ancestors. Prince Rupprecht did not wish to use the occasion of the passing of his father to reestablish the monarchy by force, preferring to do so by legal means. Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich, in his funeral speech, made a clear commitment to the monarchy while Rupprecht only declared that he had stepped into his birthright.\n\nLudwig III (Ludwig Luitpold Josef Maria Aloys Alfried; January 7, 1845 – October 18, 1921) was the last king of Bavaria, reigning from 1913 to 1918.\n\nLudwig was born in Munich, the eldest son of Prince Luitpold of Bavaria and his wife, Archduchess Augusta of Austria (daughter of Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany and Princess Maria Anna of Saxony). He was a descendant of both King Louis XIV of France and Navarre and King William I “the Conqueror” of England. King Ludwig III was named after his grandfather, King Ludwig I of Bavaria. Because his mother was raised in Florence, Archduchess Augusta always spoke in Italian to Leopold and his three siblings.\n\nLudwig III, King of Bavaria\n\nIn June 1867, Ludwig visited Vienna to attend the funeral of his cousin, Archduchess Mathilde of Austria (daughter of his father’s sister Princess Hildegarde of Bavaria, the seventh child and fourth daughter of Ludwig I of Bavaria and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen). While there, Ludwig met Mathilde’s eighteen-year-old step-cousin Maria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este, the only daughter of the late Archduke Ferdinand Karl Viktor of Austria-Este (1821–1849) and of his wife Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria (1831–1903).\n\nMaria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este\n\nThe couple had fallen in love during this visit and their decision to marry initially angered Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungry who had wished for her to marry Ferdinand IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Once permission to wed was obtained Ludwig married Maria Theresa on February 20, 1868, at St. Augustine’s Church in Vienna.\n\nMaria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este\n\nThe couple shared common descent from Holy Roman Emperor Franz I and Empress Maria Theresa of Austria (daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Karl VI and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel). Leopold III and Maria Theresa had thirteen children. The family mostly lived on their farms at Leutstetten south of Munich, where Maria Theresa cultivated rose gardens.\n\nSuccession\n\nTo begin the story of how Ludwig became the King of Bavaria we must begin with the deposition and death of his kinsman, King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Ludwig II was heavily in debt due to his extravagant spending on the construction of two lavish palaces, Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee, along with the resplendent Neuschwanstein Castle.\n\nLudwig II, King of Bavaria\n\nLudwig was also a devoted patron of the composer Richard Wagner. Ludwig spent all his royal revenues (although not state funds as is commonly thought) on these projects, borrowed extensively, and defied all attempts by his ministers to restrain him. This extravagance was used against him to declare him insane, an accusation which has since come under scrutiny.\n\nFeeling harassed and irritated by his ministers, Ludwig considered dismissing the entire cabinet and replacing them with fresh faces. The cabinet decided to act first. Seeking a cause to depose Ludwig by constitutional means, the rebelling ministers decided on the rationale that he was mentally ill, and unable to rule. They asked Ludwig’s uncle, Prince Luitpold, to step into the royal vacancy once Ludwig was deposed. Luitpold agreed, on condition the conspirators produced reliable proof that the king was in fact helplessly insane.\n\nA team of doctors had Ludwig had and his only brother and successor, Prince Otto, declared insane, providing a convenient basis for the claim of hereditary insanity. At 4 a.m. on June 10, 1886, a government commission including Drs Holnstein and Gudden arrived at Neuschwanstein to deliver the document of deposition to the king formally and to place him in custody. That same day, the Government under Minister-President Johann von Lutz publicly proclaimed Luitpold as Prince Regent.\n\nOn the afternoon of June 23, 1886, Dr. Gudden accompanied Ludwig on a stroll in the grounds of Berg Castle. They were escorted by two attendants. The two men were last seen at about 6:30 PM; they were due back at 8 PM but never returned. After searches were made for more than two hours by the entire castle staff in a gale with heavy rain, at 10:30 PM that night, the bodies of both the King and von Gudden were found, head and shoulders above the shallow water near the shore. (I will be doing a blog entry on the mysterious death of Ludwig II in the near future).\n\nThe King was succeeded by his brother Otto, but since Otto was considered incapacitated by mental illness due to a diagnosis by Dr. Gudden, the king’s uncle Luitpold remained regent. Luitpold maintained the regency until his own death in 1912 at the age of 91. He was succeeded as regent by his eldest son, Ludwig.\n\nKing of Bavaria\n\nAlmost immediately after becoming Regent, certain elements in the press and other groups in society called for Ludwig to take the throne himself. The Bavarian Legislature was not, however, currently in session, and did not meet until September 29, 1913. On November 4, 1913, the Legislature amended the constitution of Bavaria to include a clause specifying that if a regency for reasons of incapacity had lasted for ten years with no prospect of the king ever being able to reign, the regent could proclaim the end of the regency and assume the crown himself, with such action to be ratified by the Legislature.\n\nThe amendment received broad party support in the Lower Chamber where it was carried by a vote of 122 in favour, and 27 against. In the Senate there were only six votes against the amendment. The next day, November 5, 1913, Ludwig proclaimed the end of the regency, deposed his cousin and proclaimed his own reign as Ludwig III. The Legislature duly ratified this action, and Ludwig took his oath on November 8.\n\nMore on Ludwig III of Bavaria this Thursday."
