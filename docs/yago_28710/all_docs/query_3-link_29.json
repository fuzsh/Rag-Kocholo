        "text": "Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and Sophie-Alexandra Evekink have announced they are looking forward to welcoming their first child this summer.\n\nAccording to the German newspaper, Augsburger Allgemeine, Princess Sophie revealed her pregnancy during a lecture on the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals last week.\n\nThe Princess was giving the lecture in Landsberg am Lech when she divulged the joyous news. Sophie has also indicated that she will not be taking place in the Lion March, a fundraising run organised by Prince Ludwig in September, because of her due date.\n\nThe speaker of the House of Bavaria, Carmen Schramka has said that congratulations and further information would come in due course.\n\nThe news comes after one of the most lavish royal weddings in recent memory saw the couple tie the knot in May 2023.\n\nThey exchanged vows in a ceremony at the Theatine Church, before a reception, hosted by Franz, Duke of Bavaria, took place at the breathtaking Nymphenburg Palace. Prince Ludwig is the great-great-grandson of the last King of Bavaria, his namesake, King Ludwig III, who ruled from 1913 to 1918. Ludwig III lost his throne in 1918 at the end of the First World War, as the German Empire was dissolved and the Weimar Republic inaugurated, with all German state monarchies abolished in the process. Today, descendants remain mere ceremonial figureheads of royal houses, rather than enthroned ‘rulers’.\n\nSophie is a Dutch-Canadian national, who has been researching for her PhD at the Faculty of Law at Oxford. She has previously worked for the UN on health and human rights policy, alongside having taught on transnational justice at Oxford’s Criminology Centre. Of all the world’s Princesses, Sophie can certainly be said to have her finger on the pulse of global issues and current affairs.\n\nUpon the announcement of their wedding, the couple made a very considered statement regarding gifts: ‘The bridal couple are […] mindful of the number of global crises which have taken place in the recent period […] As a result, for the wedding the fiancées have, instead of presents, encouraged a call for donations towards such humanitarian initiatives.’\n\nRead More\n\nNumber one couple: Rishi and Akshata Sunak reveal the inner-workings of their home life\n\nThe most powerful couple in the country have shared what happens inside Number Ten at the end of the workday. Who's the stricter parent? Who plans the meals? The pair have some surprising answers…and some less surprising ones\n\nUntil he was snapped up by Sophie, Ludwig was considered one of the world’s most eligible royal bachelors. Also a man with a global outlook, he studied law at Göttingen, where he specialised in human rights and international humanitarian law.\n\nHe is the son of Prince Luitpold and Katrin Beatrix Wiegand. Because the ruling Duke of Bavaria, Franz – who is aged 89 – has never fathered any children, he will be succeeded by his brother, Prince Max, 86. Prince Max has five daughters but no sons and so, owing to male-preference primogeniture, the title will then passed to Prince Luitpold and his offspring, including Prince Ludwig and potentially a baby boy!\n\nAt the request of Franz, the Duke of Bavaria, Ludwig has taken on a large number of ceremonial roles in the territory. He looks likely to become a truly modern head to the House of Wittlesbach and an influential figure in German society."
