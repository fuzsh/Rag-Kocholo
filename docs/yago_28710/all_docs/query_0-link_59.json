        "text": "Oktoberfest, an annual festival held in Munich, Bavaria, Germany, originated from a party celebrating the royal marriage between Kronprinz Ludwig (later King Ludwig I of Bavaria) and the Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen in October of 1810. In modern Germany, Oktoberfest is a traditional folk festival for the entire family with roller-coaster rides, bumper cars, dozens of side-shows, a Ferris wheel, and of course, food and beer honoring Bavarian culture.\n\nWhile attending brewery school in Germany, Blackbird Brewery co-owner and brewmaster, Ian VanGundy, developed a deep appreciation for Bavarian culture. We have made it our mission to share that culture with Wake Forest, NC and we couldnâ€™t be more excited to celebrate our very first Oktoberfest with all of you!\n\nMark your calendars now for Saturday, September 30th from 12:00-10:00 PM.
