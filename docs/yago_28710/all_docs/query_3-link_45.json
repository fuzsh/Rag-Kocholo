Her splendid dress and sumptuous jewelry reflect her royal status. Her white gown is embellished with gold embroidery, and an ermine cape or shawl is loosely draped over her left shoulder. The large rectangular buckle of her gold mesh belt is adorned with brilliant-cut diamonds arranged around a large central sapphire. Her extravagant headdress combines a crown and a large diamond tiara with floral decoration in the front. The crown, set with diamonds, gemstones, and pearls, surmounted by a diamond cross, was made for her in 1806 by the goldsmith Martin-Guillaume Biennais (1746-1843) in Paris. Large pearl girandole earrings and an impressive pearl necklace complete her regal appearance.",
