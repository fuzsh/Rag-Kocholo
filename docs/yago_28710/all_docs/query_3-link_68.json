        "text": "On Saturday, May 20, Prince of Ludwig of Bavaria – a member of the House of Wittlesbach which ruled Bavaria until the end of the monarchy in 1918 – married fiancée Sophie-Alexandra Evekink in a stunning royal wedding. The ceremony took place at St Kajetan in Munich, Germany followed by a lavish reception at Nymphenburg Palace, the ancestral home of the family.\n\nThe 33-year-old bride, who was born in Singapore to Dutch-Canadian parents, walked down the aisle in a timeless white bridal gown made by Lebanese designer Reem Acra and pulled together by local seamstress Serine Touaiti. An Instagram post from the House Wittlesbach stated that the dress was created “to fit the bride’s style by incorporating elements of nature, such as lace with leaves, vines, and various flowers. The bride was grateful for a dress which balanced the traditional occasion with being a modern bride.”\n\nEvekink chose to accessorize her lace gown with light drop earrings and a simple cross necklace that highlighted the sweeping neckline of her dress – the jewelry belonged to one of her cousins and represents her ‘something borrowed’. A cousin of the groom, Catarina von Lerchenfeld, designed a bespoke blue handkerchief as the ‘something blue’ from fabric once owned by the bride’s grandmother. Ukrainian designer Wona wove hidden Dutch, Canadian, and Bavarian elements into the veil which featured botanical elements similar to the Reem Acra creation.\n\nThis is not the first time that Reem Acra has created a memorable bridal look for a notable wedding. Just last year when Naomi Biden, the granddaughter of US President Joe Biden married Peter Neal, she opted for a Reem Acra gown for her reception at the White House. The strapless ivory silk Mikado gown was not a testament to the designer’s craftsmanship but it also featured an intimate touch – Naomi’s grandmother Roberta Buhle’s pearls were sewn into the sweeping six-foot train."
