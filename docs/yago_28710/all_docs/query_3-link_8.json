        "text": "Munich was abuzz with the excitement of a royal wedding over the weekend as the dashing Prince Ludwig of Bavaria married his Dutch-Canadian fiancée, Sophie Evekink. The couple exchanged vows in a religious ceremony at the Theatine Church on Saturday 20 May 2023, followed by a reception hosted by his cousin, Franz, Duke of Bavaria, at the breathtaking Nymphenburg Palace.\n\nRead More\n\nAs Tatler reveals the cover of the 2024 wedding guide was taken at Waddesdon Manor, uncover the secrets of the Rothschilds\n\nThe family name is synonymous with wealth, power and glamour, but the Rothschild women have remained something of a mystery – until now. Natalie Livingstone discovers the secrets of one of the world’s most famous families in the October 2021 issue\n\nWell-heeled guests arrived at the church alongside delegates wearing traditional dress, in keeping with the couple’s desire for the rich local culture to be reflected in the day’s events. The bride looked radiant as she stepped out of the car on her father’s arm, wearing Reem Acra gown with a veil designed by Ukrainian label WONÁ Concept, with elements representing Bavaria, Canada, and the Netherlands. The finishing touch was the Bavarian Sapphire Floral Tiara, which was borrowed from her husband’s family.\n\nThe couple, who announced their engagement in August 2022, were the picture of wedded bliss as they exchanged vows in front of the congregation. As they emerged from the church, a beaming Prince Ludwig planted a kiss on his new wife’s cheek. The service was followed by a spectacular royal garden reception before a white tie ball later in the evening. For the nighttime engagement, the bride swapped her long-sleeved lace gown for an equally enchanting off-the shoulder A-line creation made with layers of soft tulle.\n\nRead More\n\nMove over Paris, 2024 is the year of the Wedding Olympics – and it’s only just getting started\n\nWith the Ambanis for India, Prince Abdul Mateen for Brunei and the Duke of Westminster for Great Britain – who will claim gold? It’s a heated contest for the medal that really counts\n\nPrince Ludwig, 41, is the great-great grandson of the last King of Bavaria. His namesake ancestor, King Ludwig III, ruled from 1913 to 1918. He lost his throne at the end of the First World War, as the German Empire was dissolved and the Weimar Republic created, with all the German state monarchies abolished in the process. Today, descendants are only ‘pretenders’ to the defunct throne, with the job of representing its history.\n\nRead More\n\nTatler’s Wedding Guide 2024 is here - and it has all the cutting-edge inspiration from the new frontiers of luxury planning\n\nThere’s nowhere chicer or more dependably fresh and unique to turn than to the latest issue of Tatler for all the wedding inspiration you could possibly need\n\nLudwig is expected to one day become head of this influential family. His father, Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, is a first cousin of the ruling Franz, Duke of Bavaria, 89. As Franz has never fathered children, he will be succeeded by his brother, Prince Max of Bavaria, 86. Prince Max has five daughters but no sons and so, owing to the rules of male-preference primogeniture, the title will then pass to Prince Luitpold and his descendants, including Prince Ludwig and any future male heirs.\n\nAll the men Princess Diana was ever romantically linked to\n\nRead More\n\nPrince Ludwig of Bavaria, considered one of the world’s most eligible royal bachelors, grew up at Schloss Kaltenberg and attended the Rhabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium St. Ottilien in Eresing. He went on to study law in Göttingen, where he specialised in human rights and international humanitarian law. At the request of the Duke of Bavaria, Ludwig took on a large number of representative and honorary tasks in Bavaria. Since 2011 he has been, among other positions, a board member of the Nymphenburg Aid Association and overseen its projects in Africa.\n\nSince 2014, Ludwig has spent much of his time in rural Kenya, where he has founded several non-profit organisations with partners, the Learning Lions and the Start Up Lions and other local charities. He has also been trained in estate management at the family seat of Nymphenburg Palace, as he will one day inherit it.\n\nRead More\n\nMeet the fresh face of Monaco: Alexandre Grimaldi, Prince Albert’s eldest son, gives his first solo interview exclusively in the December issue of Tatler\n\nHe’s the grandson of Grace Kelly, the eldest son of Prince Albert II of Monaco, and for 20 years he has kept his life private. Now, Alexandre Grimaldi is ready to talk. He tells Eilidh Hargreaves how he really feels about his royal roots, growing up in Knightsbridge and finally going public\n\nSophie, born in 1989, previously worked for the United Nations on health and human rights and is currently researching for her doctorate at the Law Faculty at Oxford University, where she also has taught on transitional justice at the Criminology Centre. Alongside her research, she has worked in various development, political, and diplomatic roles. Most recently in Geneva at the World Health Organisation and in London at the Wellcome Trust, leading Global Government Relations, which included engagement in multilateral fora such as G7/G20, COP26 Climate Summit, and the World Economic Forum. On the news of the engagement, the groom’s father praised his future daughter-in-law, saying: ‘Ludwig made a good choice. My future daughter-in-law is a very intelligent and educated woman.’\n\nSharing news of the wedding plans ahead of the event, spokesperson Herve Verhoosel said: ‘The couple’s wedding arrangements will reflect the family’s strong desire to include regional elements throughout the celebration, including through traditional delegations across Bavaria taking part in the ceremony and the church, as well as through incorporating local food and drinks.\n\nRead More\n\nShe's electric and now she is returning to TV screens as she fronts Channel 4's election coverage: inside the world of Emily Maitlis\n\nRevisit Emily Maitlis’s exclusive interview with Tatler, first published in the September 2020 issue\n\n‘Duke Franz and the bridal couple are also mindful of the number of global crises which have taken place in the recent period. In particular, they are aware that the cruel war of aggression against Ukraine is likely to continue into the summer of 2023. As a result, for the wedding the fiancées have, instead of presents, encouraged a call for donations towards such humanitarian initiatives. Details on the purpose of the donations will be announced soon on the Nymphenburg Foundation website.’\n\nTatler.com exclusive: All the previously unseen pictures from Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s lavish pre-wedding weekend\n\nRead More"
