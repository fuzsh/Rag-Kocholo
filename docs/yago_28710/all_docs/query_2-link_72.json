In the seven hundred and thirty-eight-year history of her reign there were political rides to Spain, France, Sweden, Italy, Greece, Holland, Austria, Hungary. But few are likely to have strayed as far from the Bavarian heartlands as Ludwig Heinrich, Prince of Bavaria, the great-great-grandson of the last Bavarian King Ludwig III, born in 1982.\n\n(..)\n\nI submitted the translation in full length yesterday but discovered today that it didn't work , therefore the link of the article here\n\nhttps://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuille...phie-alexandra-evekink-heiraten-18898380.html\n\nSophie-Alexandra Evekink and Prince Ludwig of Bavaria gave an interview to the German channel BR. Here's an excerpt.\n\nhttps://www.br.de/br-fernsehen/sendungen/abendschau/as-interview-brautpaar-100.html\n\nWonderful little snippet from the interview! Thanks Blog Real!\n\nThe Bavarian of Sophie-Alexandra is better than mine and her German already excellent!\n\nAnd she is making a \"Doktor\", her PhD in Oxford now! Yep, that fits! She is obviously a very bright woman.\n\nI haven't seen any Dutch news reports about the wedding of this Dutch-Canadian wife of the future head of this prestigious royal house. We'll see whether it somehow will receive any attention tomorrow.\n\nIt's fun hearing her speak in German - with a clearly Dutch accent. They seem like a great couple. Hopefully their wish to start a family soon (which makes sense given that the groom is turning 41 next month; he is one week older than the prince of Wales) comes true.\n\nVideo of the bride's arrival.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CsdSvzJsbgD/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CsdUspOosne/\n\nGuests:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CsdVm9Ho4GR/\n\nMore photos:\n\nhttps://royalwatcherblog.com/2023/05/20/wedding-of-prince-ludwig-of-bavaria-1/\n\nhttps://www.hola.com/realeza/galeri...viera-boda-sophie-alexandra-evekink-munich/1/\n\nRoyal and noble guests and relatives included The Duke of Bavaria, Crown Prince Alois and Hereditary Princess Sophie of Liechtenstein, Prince Louis of Luxembourg, Margareta, Crown Guardian of Romania and Prince Radu, The Duke and Duchess of Bragan√ßa, The Duke of Bavaria and Princess Elisabeth, Duchess in Bavaria, and members of the Royal Families of Baden, Hanover, Hesse, Austria, Saxony and Prussia.\n\nAccording to ChristineZ on twitter, the bride fainted during the service. After some sips of water all was fine and things could continue.\n\nIsn't there an Arco wedding as well today? I imagine some of the guests were invited to both. Prince and Princess Napoleon f.e. are not on todays pictures. There seems to be a lot of Bavarian politicians attending the wedding. All CSU?\n\nThe bride looks absolutely lovely, imho. Even though the hair is half down, it's nicely styled and suits her. I really like her wedding gown, and the tiara looks stunning on her!\n\nThe guest-list looks impressive, but that was to be expected, I think. I wonder, will the wedding ball give us more tiaras? The Wittelsbachs seem like the kind of family who would put on w white tie ball for the wedding of the heir.\n\nAccording to ChristineZ on twitter, the bride fainted during the service.

Prince and Princess Napoleon f.e. are not on todays pictures. There seems to be a lot of Bavarian politicians attending the wedding. All CSU?\n\nHer wedding dress seems at least one size too small (if not two), I wonder whether that contributed to the fainting.\n\nOther than that it's a lovely soft look for the bride.\n\nAccording to ChristineZ on twitter, the bride fainted during the service.

Prince and Princess Napoleon f.e. are not on todays pictures. There seems to be a lot of Bavarian politicians attending the wedding. All CSU?\n\nNo. At least one other was mentioned beyond the three CSU-members, Vice.Ministerpresident Hubert Aiwanger who is a member of the (co-ruling) party of Free voters. And surely there were others.\n\nThe Arco-wedding between Countess Maximiliana von Arco-Zinneberg and Andr√© Byron Houdayer was on wednesday in Moos LK Deggendorf.\n\nHer wedding dress seems at least one size too small (if not two), I wonder whether that contributed to the fainting.\n\nOther than that it's a lovely soft look for the bride.\n\noh, i'd never thought of that, i thought she looked lovely, really pretty gown and not overshadowing her at all (for some brides you just see the dress and nothing else)l, but i hope it didn't contribute to her fainting\n\nI don't like the dress, I've seen it many times already. My hopes have gone down for the blue dress she's supposed to wear for the reception. Love to see the Bavarian Sapphire Floral Tiara, though.\n\nThe ceremony was impressive, long live Bavarian traditions! All the guards in Lederhosen:\n\nNevertheless, congratulations to the newlyweds!\n\noh, i'd never thought of that, i thought she looked lovely, really pretty gown and not overshadowing her at all (for some brides you just see the dress and nothing else)l, but i hope it didn't contribute to her fainting\n\nSee for example this picture. A lovely bride but her dress was a bit too tight: https://robinutrecht.photoshelter.c...unchen-2023/G0000BnsCeymxSYE/I0000iUPfTSw1MSU\n\nPrince Louis of Luxembourg was also among the guests: https://robinutrecht.photoshelter.c...unchen-2023/G0000BnsCeymxSYE/I0000Ah57JiH2q6w\n\nBeautiful picture of the bridal couple leaving the church - but what is the groom wearing around his wrist?\n\nhttps://robinutrecht.photoshelter.c...unchen-2023/G0000BnsCeymxSYE/I00008E_mg4MsCpE\n\nAnd the kiss: https://robinutrecht.photoshelter.c...unchen-2023/G0000BnsCeymxSYE/I0000zHH8KKzjLw4\n\nBeautiful picture of the bridal couple leaving the church - but what is the groom wearing around his wrist?\n\nhttps://robinutrecht.photoshelter.c...unchen-2023/G0000BnsCeymxSYE/I00008E_mg4MsCpE\n\nGiven Prince Ludwig's longterm engagement in Kenyan causes my guess is that the bracelet is from that country. I've also seen photos of some of the guests (among them Prince Louis and his date) wearing the same bracelet so it might've been a gift to the wedding guests.\n\nReem Acra redeems herself with a successful (non-reigning) royal wedding gown. The gown probably is one of the best lace wedding gown of any royal wedding gown of recent decades, despite being too small on the bride. Lovely hair, tidy and neat, not covering anything and let her beautiful tiara shine.\n\nBeautiful bride and she wore the tiara perfectly. I cannot believe she fainted! She must have been so embarrased.\n\nThe gown is very beautiful and the patterns and embroidery are beautiful. I hope she has a second dress to dance and enjoy the reception is as that dress will positively rip if she plans on dancing.\n\nPrince Louis of Luxembourg was accompanied by a date. Anyone know anything about her?"
