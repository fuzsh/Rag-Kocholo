        "text": "A weekend in Umbria: 10 unmissable places to visit The only region of central Italy not to be bathed by the sea, Umbria is a jewel that makes up for the lack of salt water with the landscapes and medieval villages that cross it. Famous for jazz (here every year there is the Umbria Jazz Festival), the production of chocolate, specialties such as truffles and game and the natural wealth that, among lakes, olive trees and vineyards, gifts it with of the most important food and wine traditions of the country. But what are the places to visit during a weekend in Umbria? https://lnkd.in/dsNs3mHj\n\nNiagara-on-the-Lake (NOTL) had several different names during its early years. From 1792-1797 it was called Newark, and during this time it was the first capital of Upper Canada. Due to the town’s proximity to Fort Niagara, across the river in the US, the capital was then moved to York (now Toronto). Many battles took place in the NOTL and the surrounding area during the War of 1812, during which the British and their First Nations allies fought to prevent American expansion into their territory. Fort George was occupied by American forces in 1813, and they burned the town when they left at the end of the year. A few buildings survived, and NOTL was rebuilt after the war. The layout of the Old Town is from that era, and many buildings on Queen Street and the blocks on either side of it have been preserved as homes and businesses. Once a farm town, NOTL’s rise as a cultural center began with the establishment of the Shaw Festival in 1962. It features plays by George Bernard Shaw, other playwrights of his era, and plays set in his era. NOTL is now home to many artists and hosts a variety of festivals from music to food, and of course the wine for which it has become famous. The rich soils of the Niagara region below the Escarpment have long been a fruit-growing area, and NOTL was no exception. Nowadays many of the orchards, which once produced large quantities of peaches, cherries, and plums, have been converted into vineyards for wine grapes. Since the 1970s, the quality of the wine has steadily improved with the introduction of grape varietals more suited to wine-making than eating. The microclimates of the Niagara Peninsula are influenced not only by soil differences, but also by elevation and breezes from Lake Ontario, leading to many distinct terroirs among the many wineries.

While France features diverse landscapes such as the Mediterranean coast and the Alps, Poland is characterized by expansive plains, dense forests, and the scenic Carpathian Mountains, each contributing to distinct cultural and environmental identities. France 🇫🇷: Cheese love: France is home to over 1,200 different types of cheese, making it the country with the largest variety of cheeses in the world. It is said that tasting all the French cheeses would take a year if you tried one every day! 🧀 Baguette law: In France, the term “baguette tradition” is protected by law. It requires bakeries to make their baguette on site using traditional ingredients and processes. This regulation ensures that the traditional French bread culture is preserved. 🥖 Different time zones: France has overseas territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean that belong to different time zones. For example French Polynesia has a time zone that is 10 hours ahead of Paris time. ⏱ Poland 🇵🇱: Pierogi power: Poland is the land of pierogi - delicious dumplings filled with everything from potatoes to sweet fruit. There are so many variations that you could eat a different type of pierogi almost every day and never get tired of them (or maybe you would, but it would be a delicious tiredness). 🥟 Vodka variety: Poland takes great pride in its rich tradition of vodka production. With a wide array of types and brands available, Polish vodka caters to various tastes and occasions – from festive celebrations like weddings to everyday moments. 🍸 Salt Mine spectacular: Poland is home to one of the oldest salt mines in the world, the Wieliczka Salt Mine. The mine is so impressive - it even has an underground chapel, built entirely out of salt. 🧂 How do you think each country will represent themselves through their team? 🌎⚽ #globalmobility #hrconsulting #championship #france #poland #culturehackers #culture\n\nAn Opportunity to Boost Wine Sales in Hong Kong? Last week, I had the pleasure of attending my first Hong Kong Sevens, a three-day spectacle that delighted rugby enthusiasts and even captivated those who were unfamiliar with the sport. The event was filled with entertainment both inside and outside the stands, featuring concerts, various activities organized by the event coordinators, and passionate supporters in costumes and regular attire. (The South Stand, in particular, is renowned worldwide for its lively atmosphere.) To top it off, as a French person living in Hong Kong, I was thrilled that both our teams made it to the final four, and the Hong Kong men's team emerged victorious, winning the Claymore. With such a successful outcome, expectations are already high for the next edition, which will be hosted in a brand-new stadium with a larger capacity. However, it is worth considering areas for improvement. As a wine enthusiast, I was disappointed by the limited availability of wine options. Wine, served with no detail regarding its quality and origin, was relegated to the bottom of the list of beverages offered at the stadium bars. Some may argue that rugby supporters prefer beer. However, when you take into account that among the competing teams, we have countries renowned for wine production such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, the United States, not to mention China and even Japan, there are ample opportunities to leverage the event and promote wine in a lighthearted manner that aligns with the lively atmosphere. Given the diverse profiles of the supporters, it is highly likely that there are wine enthusiasts among the audience. Therefore, there is little risk in trying something new. Furthermore, at a time when the wine industry is concerned about declining interest and its perceived lack of appeal to millennials or genZ, the Sevens presents an opportunity to bridge the image gap, reach a wider audience, and challenge certain norms. What are your thoughts on this? #BoostWineSales #WineExperience @HKSevens\n\nIn our ongoing series on the European Championship 2024 we look at similarities and differences of the countries playing. ⚽ Both Belgium and Romania have a rich history and are members of the European Union. Both countries have a vibrant cultural scene, evident in their architecture, festivals and culinary traditions. Belgium, a small country with a flat landscape and a multicultural capital, contrasts with Romania, which is characterized by its larger size, and beautiful, mountainous landscapes. Belgium 🇧🇪: French fry paradise: Belgium claims to have invented French fries and takes them very seriously. You can buy fries on almost every street corner in “friteries” or “fritkots”, often with a variety of sauces. Belgian fries are so popular that there is even a museum dedicated to them - the Frietmuseum in Bruges. 🍟 Beer bonanza: Belgium is famous for its beer culture and has over 1,500 different types of beer. Some beers are brewed in monasteries by monks using secret recipes that have been handed down over the centuries. Belgian beer lovers claim that there is a beer for every occasion - even for the breakfast table! 🍺 Tri-Cultural tapestry: Belgium is uniquely divided into three cultural regions, each with its own distinct culture, traditions, and even language. This diversity contributes to Belgium's rich cultural and culinary tapestry. 🌍🌎🌏 Romania 🇷🇴: Sarmale delights: Romanians love their traditional dish of sarmale, stuffed cabbage rolls, so much that it is served on almost every public holiday. They hold a significant place in Romanian culinary traditions and are enjoyed by people of all ages throughout the country. 🤤🎊 Salt Palace: Romania is home to the impressive Salina Turda, a huge salt mine that has been converted into an underground leisure and health center. Visitors can slide down giant slides, ride an underground Ferris wheel or go boating in a salt lake. 🧂🚣♀️ Lucky charms: Martisor is an ancient tradition observed on March 1st and involves exchanging small tokens, typically red and white strings with decorative charms or small trinkets attached. These Martisor tokens are believed to bring good luck, health, and prosperity for the coming year. A joyful and colorful tradition. 🍀 How do you think each country will represent themselves through their team? 🌎⚽ #globalmobility #hrconsulting #championship #belgium #romania #culturehackers #culture"
