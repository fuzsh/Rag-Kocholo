At 18 years old, Therese was wed to the future king.\n\nThe festivities that followed their marriage in Munich on October 12th, 1810, went down as the very first Oktoberfest. While her new husband stated he could not wish for a better woman, he did make it known that he “married without passion as it’s more profitable for the future.” Charming."
