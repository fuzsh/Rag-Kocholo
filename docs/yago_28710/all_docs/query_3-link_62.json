        "text": "On 13th June 1886, King Ludwig II of Bavaria and his personal physician, Dr Bernard von Gudden, went for a walk in the grounds of Castle Berg. Neither of them returned. When their bodies were found in nearby Lake Starnburg they had been dead for six hours.\n\nThree days earlier, Ludwig had been declared unfit to rule, to be succeeded by his brother Otto, who spent his entire 27-year reign in confinement, being every bit as insane as Ludwig, if not more so.\n\nObsessive Pride\n\nLudwig was born in 1845 and became Crown Prince of Bavaria before he was three years old. This planted in his young mind an obsessive pride and a feeling of superiority. This was reinforced when servants in the royal household were ordered to bow in reverence to the young Ludwig.\n\nLudwig always had to come first, whether it was in games with his brother Otto, who was three years younger, or in the order of precedence when entering a room in company. This extended to anywhere the boys might be."
