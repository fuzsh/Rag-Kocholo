The festival originates with a party held in celebration of a royal marriage. On October 12, 1810, Kronprinz Ludwig (later King Ludwig I of Bavaria) married the Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen in Munich. Typically Oktoberfest is celebrated with steins of beer, pretzels and other german foods.\n\nThis template takes the best of Oktoberfest and celebrates it in a retro format! Looking at what happened in the closing sprint as well as what risks and issues the team foresees in its future.\n\nThe template also features my usual temp checks and activity, in the form of a virtual pub! Feel free to have your team members bring a beverage and enjoy a happy hour after the retro to get the full Oktoberfest feel!\n\n‚ú®Facilitator notes: There is no prep work needed for this template. Just open and go! ‚ú®\n\nUsed it? Loved it?\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback on this template or any others I've published. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn below.\n\nHappy Retro-ing!\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/k88mills/\n\nü•®üç∫üå≠ü•®üç∫üå≠"
