        "text": "Context\n\nThe order was founded in 1725 and the KCB was first awarded to a Canadian in 1815. The Most Honourable and Ancient Order of The Bath was presented for service of the highest caliber.\n\nEligibility and Criteria\n\nThe order has a civil and a military division with three levels in each division: Knight Grand Cross (GCB); Knight Commander (KCB); and Companion (CB).The first two levels confer knighthood, and since 1935, have not been available to anyone retaining Canadian Citizenship. The Companion level was presented to the military for service in the Second World War and one was presented to a Canadian in Korea.\n\nDescription\n\nMilitary Companions (CB) wear only the neck badge (1.5 inches wide). The badge is a gold Maltese cross of eight points, enameled white, each point tipped with a gold ball, and in each angle between the arms of the cross, a gold lion. The central device consists of the rose, thistle and shamrock issuing from a sceptre and three crowns. Surrounding the central device is a red enameled bandlet with TRIA JUNCTA IN UNO in gold. Around this circle are two branches of laurel, enameled green, and below this is a blue enamel scroll with ICH DIEN in gold. For mounting the Maltese crosses are worn from a ribbon passing through a large gold ring linked to the ring attached to the top of the crown (between the top two points of the star). The badge of a Civil Companion is worn from a ribbon passing through a large gold ring linked to the gold scroll-work at the top of the badge.\n\nCivil Companions (CB) wear only the badge (1 inch wide x 1.5 inches high). The civil badge is oval with gold filigree work and consists of the motto in a bandlet around the edge and, in the centre, the rose, thistle and shamrock issuing from a sceptre and the three crowns. At the top is an ornate gold scroll with a ring attached, through which a larger gold ring passes. A GCB or KCB civil companion wears this badge in a larger size rather than the military badge.\n\nEach of the badges has a reverse that is similar in appearance to its obverse.\n\nThe crimson ribbon is 1.5 inches wide.\n\nHistorical Notes"
