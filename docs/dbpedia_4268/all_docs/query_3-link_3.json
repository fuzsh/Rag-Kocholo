        "text": "Military Companions (CB) wear only the neck badge (1.5 inches wide). The badge is a gold Maltese cross of eight points, enameled white, each point tipped with a gold ball, and in each angle between the arms of the cross, a gold lion. The central device consists of the rose, thistle and shamrock issuing from a sceptre and three crowns. Surrounding the central device is a red enameled bandlet with TRIA JUNCTA IN UNO in gold. Around this circle are two branches of laurel, enameled green, and below this is a blue enamel scroll with ICH DIEN in gold. For mounting the Maltese crosses are worn from a ribbon passing through a large gold ring linked to the ring attached to the top of the crown (between the top two points of the star). The badge of a Civil Companion is worn from a ribbon passing through a large gold ring linked to the gold scroll-work at the top of the badge.\n\nCivil Companions (CB) wear only the badge (1 inch wide x 1.5 inches high). The civil badge is oval with gold filigree work and consists of the motto in a bandlet around the edge and, in the centre, the rose, thistle and shamrock issuing from a sceptre and the three crowns. At the top is an ornate gold scroll with a ring attached, through which a larger gold ring passes. A GCB or KCB civil companion wears this badge in a larger size rather than the military badge.\n\nEach of the badges has a reverse that is similar in appearance to its obverse.\n\nThe crimson ribbon is 1.5 inches wide."
