        "text": "The Reformation of the sixteenth-century is commonly seen as the transitional period between the medieval and the modern worlds. This study examines the political thought of England during its period of religious reform from the reign of Edward VI to the death of Elizabeth I. The political thought of Tudor ecclesiastics was heavily informed by the institutional and intellectual upheavals in England and on the continent, producing tensions between traditional ways of conceptualising politics and new religious and political realities. This book offers a study of natural law, providentialism, cosmic order, political authority, and government by consent in Protestant political thought during a transitional period in English history. It shows how the Reformation was central to the birth of modern political thought.\n\nThe early modern period was in many aspects an epoch coined by capriciousness and arbitrariness. Misfortunes were understood as God’s way of expressing his anger towards the people. It is easily comprehensible that the population suffered from a sense of disempowerment and therefore sought remedy in alternative sources, which the Church often disparagingly called ‘superstition’. Thus they were desperately trying to redirect the common people’s enthusiasm for magic into more religious activities; a process which Peter Burke entitled as a systematic “reform of the common culture”. Hence this dissertation examines to what extent those reforms were successful, whether the reformation led to a disenchantment of the people or whether magic and superstition survived secretly in the common people’s world. When I first started working on this project I wanted to analyse churchwarden accounts from the 1530s in order to draw conclusions about the impact of the Reformation on the popular culture. I was hoping to come across the accounts of one single village and then adopting a micro historical approach by applying the circumstances reported there into a greater than local context. Unfortunately, after having done some research I had to discover that there are hardly any documents like those I would have needed to implement my idea. However, it became apparent that there was enough of useful information hidden within a plethora of different types of primary. Instead of having to prove to what extend a single village could be considered as being representative for the whole society, I can use my assembled data from all over the country as jigsaw pieces indicating supra-regional trends and patterns. It became apparent that the Reformation does not represent a clean fundamental break with the old traditions, it us much rather a compromise between those and the new religious proceedings."
