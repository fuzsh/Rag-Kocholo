        "text": "The annual honours list will soon be published by The Gazette, as it is every year.\n\nThe list aims to recognise the achievements and services of people from across the UK and from all walks of life with various forms of titles.\n\nHonours have been bestowed by monarchs in some form since the Middle Ages, and are now announced twice a year – at new year and in June on the date of the late Queen’s official birthday.\n\nLast year Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer (CMO), and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam both received honours, as did Scotland’s CMO Dr Gregor Smith and Wales’ Frank Atherton.\n\nWhat is the difference between the honours?\n\nHonours lists typically comprise knights and dames, appointments to the Order of the British Empire and gallantry awards.\n\nHere are the ranks in descending order:\n\nCompanions of Honour (CH)\n\nThe Order of the Companions of Honour was founded on 4 June, 1917 by George V and it limited to just 65 members at any one time. Appointments go to those who have made a long-standing contribution to arts, science, medicine or government.\n\nOrder of the Bath (DCB/KCB/CB)\n\nThis recognises the work of senior military officials and civil servants.\n\nEngland’s CMO Chris Whitty (KCB) and chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance (KCB), were honoured in last year’s New Year Honours list.\n\nOrder of St Michael and St George (Knight/GCMG/KCMG/DCMG/CMG)\n\nThis recognises service in a foreign country, or in relation to foreign and Commonwealth affairs, such as the work of diplomats overseas.\n\nLast year, James Bond star Daniel Craig was made a Companion of the Order, which is equivalent to a CBE and means he can use the post-nominals CMG, following his final outing as 007 in No Time To Die.\n\nKnighthood and damehood (Knight/DBE)\n\nThese are usually bestowed on people who have made a major contribution at national level, who can use the titles Dame and Sir.\n\nEngland’s deputy CMO, Jonathan Van-Tam, Wales’ CMO Frank Atherton and Scotland’s CMO Dr Gregor Smith were made knights in 2022.\n\nCommanders of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)\n\nPeople are recognised under this honour if they have have a prominent but lesser role at national level, or a leading role at regional level.\n\nIt also goes to those who make a distinguished, innovative contribution to any area.\n\nOfficer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)\n\nPeople are made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire if they have a major local role in any activity, including people whose work has made them known nationally.\n\nAmong the 253 who were honoured in this way in 2022 were Olympians Adam Peaty and Tom Daley.\n\nMember of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)\n\nThis rank recognises outstanding achievements or service to the community which have had a long-term significant impact.\n\nBritish Empire Medal (BEM)\n\nThe BEM was reintroduced in 2012 by then prime minister David Cameron as part of his attempt to make the honours system “classless”, saying too few people making a difference in their areas were made MBEs.\n\nThe medal went to 361 people in the 2022 New Year Honours."
