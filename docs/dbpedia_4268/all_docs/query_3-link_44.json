        "text": "Post-nominal entitlements\n\nMany awards carry an entitlement for recipients to use indicative letters after their name - for example, ‘OAM’ for the Medal of the Order of Australia. These indicative letters are known as post-nominals.\n\nPost-nominals may be used from the date on which the award is gazetted.\n\nIf a recipient is entitled to post-nominals for more than one award, the sequence of the post-nominals is indicated by the Order of Wearing for Australian honours and awards. Please note that within the Order of Australia, the highest award is the only post-nominal used. For example, Mr John Citizen who has received the OAM, the AM and the AC, will be addressed as Mr John Citizen AC.\n\nThere are established post-nominal entitlements for Australian honours and Imperial honours listed in the table below. Please note this list is in alphabetical order (and not in the order of wearing of awards – which can be found under Wearing Awards).\n\nAwards marked with an asterisk * have no post-nominal entitlement."
