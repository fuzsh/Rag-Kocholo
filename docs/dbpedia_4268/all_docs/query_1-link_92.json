It was his fourth winter trapped in the ice. Yet Ross and his long-suffering men refused to abandon hope. As the winter snows melted for a brief moment, later in August 1833, they took to their boats in a ﬁnal bid for freedom and were at last rescued by a ship in Bafﬁn’s Bay. Returning home as a ‘hero’, embraced by the nation, it didn’t take Ross long to pick up his pen again. In the course of researching this book the going got tough a few times but I was fortunate to enjoy the support of friends and family. Offering advice, criticism, and encouragement throughout, they all improved my work immeasurably. Fearing for his life in the Arctic, Ross wasn’t so lucky as to have friends around him. Snug in my armchair, I begin to wonder why I made such a fuss. Naval explorers had many people to thank when they managed to make it home – Admiralty ofﬁcials, sponsors, suppliers, sweethearts and wives – and they repaid them as best they could. Nelson, his biographers would have us believe, tried to secure a polar bear skin for his father, and generations of Arctic men hoped to follow his example. Some inked newly-discovered features on their charts for their supporters, others delivered rousing speeches, whilst most presented gifts as a way of thanks: walrus tusks, collections of rocks, seal-skin trousers, carefully crafted watercolours, an ofﬁcial narrative bound in white silk, perhaps a free ticket to a popular magic lantern show. Ross\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nnamed what he thought was a new continent after his patron, the gindistiller Felix Booth, and optimistically chalked up the name of the new King on his map of the Magnetic North Pole. I have no grand gesture. It is impossible for me to repay the kindness of all those who have accompanied the passage of my research. At best I can offer my sincere thanks. This book is as much yours as mine, though of course any faults or omissions are, quite reasonably, entirely my own. I should like to acknowledge, in particular, Anthony Cross, for welcoming me into the Nelson Room at the Warwick Leadlay Gallery in Greenwich; Professor Russell Potter, for sharing his expertise on all aspects of the visual culture of exploration; and Dr Beau Riffenburgh, for his guidance and sound editorial.

I should also like to thank David Stonestreet and the team at I.B.Tauris who have enabled some of my work to ﬁnally see the light of day. My postgraduate research was supported with a scholarship from the States of Guernsey Education Council. Extended work across North America – ﬁrst as Visiting Fellow at Harvard University, and later as a wandering scholar in all manner of wonderful libraries – was made possible by funding from various sources: St John’s College, the British Association for Canadian Studies, Cambridge University and the Scott Polar Research Institute. I must also acknowledge the ongoing ﬁnancial support of my family, particularly my stepfather Dr Alan Boyle. For this, as with so much else, I’m deeply grateful. Early versions of Chapter 2 appeared as ‘Nelson and the Bear’ in The Trafalgar Chronicle, the annual yearbook of the 1805 Club, and Polar Record, published by Cambridge University Press. Forms of Chapter 5 featured as ‘Heroism Displayed’ in Polar Record and many of its hagiographic themes were discussed as ‘Displaying Nelson’ in the International Journal of Maritime History. With impresario Horatio Blood, the true delinquent of juvenile drama, I was delighted to restage Captain Ross in all its toy theatre glory and I’ve also been lucky to collaborate with Jeremy Bristow and the BBC Natural History Unit developing much of my PhD thinking into the documentary ﬁlm Wilderness Explored. Some more than most have long endured my odd fascination with Victorian explorer-heroes. I owe a great deal to my mother who has x\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nalways offered her unquestioning support. When this work is published she will be the ﬁrst to get a copy and, I suspect, be one of the few who will actually read it. I should like to thank Daisy Ginsberg for her help all those years ago and for her patience, which could also be described as heroic. Kari Herbert and Nell now bring sunshine to every day, even when the Cornish storms threaten to blow the house into the sea. And lastly, to my grandfather, who opened my eyes to the polar world. A decade on from beginning this work I’ve now travelled across the Arctic in the footsteps of many of these explorers, sailing northwest passages and also exploring the remote coasts of Antarctica. Still challenge and delight is everywhere to be found; and hardship too, if that’s what ﬂoats your boat.\n\nxi\n\nIn pleasing dreams the blissful age renew, And call Britannia’s glories back to view.2 Samuel Johnson, 1749 Pause on the footprints of heroic men, Making a garden of the desert wide Where PARRY conquer’d death and FRANKLIN died.3 Charles Dickens, 1857 No schoolboy’s task have ye in view, ‘Tis no child’s play a path to hew Where brave men strove, and fought, and fell, Beneath the Monarch’s icy spell.

This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes . . . I try in vain to be persuaded that the Pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight . . . I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.1\n\nOn 29 May 1875 the beach at Portsmouth was crowded. It was a public holiday, Queen Victoria’s Birthday, and special trains from London were bringing people south in their thousands. As the dockyard clock struck four Her Majesty’s Ships Alert and Discovery cast off their lines. Bands got up a rousing tune and piers swelled with the rush of people hoping to wave a ﬁnal farewell. Five thousand soldiers from the town’s garrison paraded through the throng, their jackets a ribbon of scarlet lining the foreshore as they offered their own gesture of support. Paddle steamers and Solent ferries panted alongside the ships to give eager punters a closer view of the explorers, and every ironclad in the harbour ﬁred the royal salute. Such a cheer rang out ‘as Portsmouth had never heard before’, reported The Times, and ‘the multitudes who assembled to witness the sailing of Captain Nares and his brave companions indicate pretty clearly that a true chord has been struck, and that the sympathies of all, from the Queen downwards, go with them’. The crowds ‘sensed that the crews were about to enter upon a\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nbattle with Nature in her sternest aspects’, another correspondent agreed, ‘and that it was for the honour of the country that this should be so’. Hearts and minds were united in expectant celebration. The North Pole, it was said, was just ‘waiting to be won’.2 These men were the Navy’s best and they carried the hopes of their service northward with a conﬁdence inspired by memories of the past. Yet the British Arctic Expedition was not to be the ‘glorious crusade’ that the crowds on the beach that day imagined. Weakened by scurvy and overwhelmed by severe conditions, the ‘gallant band’ failed to reach their goal; the prize of the Pole remaining invisible behind a seemingly impassable chaos of broken ice. The explorers arrived back in England the following year and though many were disappointed by their early return they were embraced as heroes. ‘Overworked, overtired, borne down by the weight of a dreadful and depressing malady, cold, hungry, they struggled on’, narrated one journal, ‘and individual heroism stepped in to save the honour of the day! There are some defeats that are more glorious than victories; some failures which are grander than the most brilliant success. The charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava was a useless waste of life; yet we doubt if any feat of arms in modern times ever had so ﬁne a moral effect as that piece of heroic stupidity. In like manner, these gallant seamen have failed to reach the Pole; but they have won a proud place in their country’s annals. They have done Englishmen good’.3 Some were less impressed by the very real failure of the voyage, for there was to be no ‘hoisting the Union Jack upon the Pole’: ‘Verily the expedition of 1875 –76 has but little of which to boast. It went out like a rocket, and has come back like the stick’.4\n\nEXPLORING HEROISM\n\nThis is a book about the making of heroes. It describes how and why a cult of polar exploration was constructed and developed in the nineteenth century, examining the diverse ways that naval ofﬁcers were imagined. There are countless stories, numerous expeditions, a few real successes and frequent setbacks. It’s also a story of how the boundaries of the known world were pushed back as blanks were ﬁlled 2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\non the charts of the north. And, as we shall see, in some ways it all begins with a boy and a bear. This study seeks to make a contribution to what is now a well established and growing literature on the politics and culture of the heroic.5 A ﬂeet of works have offered new light on topics such as Christian hagiography, nationalism and chivalry, and concepts of genius in science and the arts.6 Recent accounts – by a range of scholars with backgrounds in history, sociology, art history, literary and media studies – have explored the evolving reputations, shifting images, and varied uses of a succession of historical ﬁgures, from William Wallace to George Washington, Joan of Arc to Mary Queen of Scots, Columbus to General Custer, Shakespeare to Churchill.7 A bewildering array of iconography has been examined, from Renaissance texts, military portraiture, Islamic art, to American cinema.8 Changing concepts of the heroic may be read in the lives of revolutionaries and missionaries, poets and statesmen, Cossacks and cowboys, even footballers and ﬁlm stars.9 Others have examined the heroic cultures of British Imperialism, Communism, the French Revolution, or have explored the gender dimensions of heroic reputations.10 This book draws upon this literature and hopes to develop some of its insights whilst suggesting new possibilities for the writing of naval and polar history. Though a good deal has been written about the wide-ranging meanings of the term ‘hero’, and the type of men that the public accepted as such, nineteenth-century myths of the sea have attracted only intermittent academic attention.11 There is much to be gained by looking at the lives and reputations of naval heroes and lionised polar explorers. At it simplest, this study will explore changes in the general understanding of the idea of heroism and what type of individuals and actions could be considered heroic. Though the word hero cannot be easily deﬁned, we can trace those characteristics that were regarded as being ‘admirable’ throughout the century. A range of meanings, articulated in languages of patriotism, duty, service, and morality, could satisfy the images of great men that people made for themselves. A hero is any man or woman whose existence is endowed by others, not merely with fame or ‘celebrity’, but with a special allocation of imputed meaning and symbolic signiﬁcance; raised above others in public esteem whilst also being 3\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nthe object of some kind of collective emotional investment. The concept of reputation is therefore central to an analysis of the heroic, and reputations are understood here not as ‘the vapour trails of natural glory that the great and the good leave behind them’, but as cultural constructions reﬂecting the values and ideologies of the societies in which they are produced. What resonates is not merely the life as lived, but the life made sense of, the life imaginatively reconstructed and rendered signiﬁcant upon a broad canvas of ‘imaginings’.12 Heroes may also be seen as the products of publishing and spectacle, whose images are made and mediated by individuals, by organisations, and by the demands of the market; the heroic image as sites through which a range of imagined communities are capable of expression. I want to consider more closely the value of the heroic image and how it could be put to work, by whom, and why. Sir Charles Brenton might still emphasise the lowly aspect of the word: ‘a mere hero is a despicable creature’, he wrote in 1855, ‘and what many understand by heroism is but a reﬁned intoxication’.13 Yet for so many others the word hero was being used in an overwhelmingly positive sense, describing a type of ‘English virtue’, Charles Kingsley would suggest, ‘at once manful and Godly, practical and enthusiastic, prudent and self-sacriﬁcing’.14 I want to understand the cultural machinery that sustained this layered heroic ideal and explore the aesthetic and ideological proclivities that helped a narrative of duty to be imprinted in impressionable minds. This ethos of service was celebrated above all in naval heroes. Before expanding more fully on my objectives, it may be easier to say what this book is not. This is neither a deﬁnitive history of nineteenth-century polar exploration, a biographical account of major explorers, nor an uncritical hagiography. Rather, it is to the changing nature of polar imaginations that I’ve directed my efforts. This is not a traditional art history or a literary study, although neglected texts and a range of rediscovered iconographies are examined throughout, as I attempt to better understand exploration’s culture. I don’t present a seamless sequence of celebrated voyages, uninterrupted within a story of progress and endeavour, nor would I want to write this type of history. Chronologically encyclopaedic accounts of expeditions are undoubtedly useful but they are\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nunsatisfying. They present narrative histories akin to sailing a coastline, ticking or noting the headlands but not taking the time to go into the bays, let alone make much progress ashore. Two major limitations have been made in order to produce a manageable result. In the ﬁrst place, appealing though it would have been to examine the complicated hagiographies of eighteenthcentury naval men like James Cook, or early twentieth-century polar ofﬁcers such as Robert Falcon Scott, my story is largely devoted to the nineteenth century. Secondly, my research was focussed on the reception and popular meaning of explorers in the British Isles. As the range of audiences for exploration, even within a single town, is so obviously diverse it seemed unnecessary at this stage to expand my explorations too far into Europe, North America, or even further aﬁeld. Support for polar voyages ﬂuctuated in the space of weeks, let alone over the course of a few years. For some it became an obsession; for many others it was all just humbug. So, it is rewarding then to attempt to trace the geography of public support for explorers and their exploits. A balanced proﬁle reﬂective of the range of opinions has yet to be offered and so one can easily justify the desire to stay, for now, ﬁrmly at home. This book will engage dynamic naval hagiographies and a range of representations. Within six chapters I have chosen to examine nautical biography and children’s literature, the making of a polar celebrity, an early history of Arctic ballooning, an imperial naval exhibition, and the recent discovery of a shipwreck. At ﬁrst sight this is an unusual mix, however each chapter shares a common theme: to recapture the ways that explorers were imagined and ask why. In each part I have chosen to examine aspects of the culture of polar exploration that have never before been considered. This approach essays to raise questions, to open up new areas of enquiry, to remind historians of the intriguing stories that exist in histories of exploration, and, not least, the useful materials that can still be discovered in museums and archives if you’re willing to work hard to get to them. Instead of leaving explorers and their legacies to popular biography and conventional narrative accounts, this study will demonstrate the interdisciplinary merits of asking questions about the culture of exploration, its changing dynamic, and its continuing relevance.\n\n5\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nATTRACTIVE PERFORMANCES\n\nA comet races across the sky, its tail a mosaic of those people and events, noteworthy and trivial, that attract the attentions of the ‘great British public’. The year is 1853. Queen Victoria and her consort Albert preside over a potpourri of contemporary scandals and curiosities, all rendered by George Cruikshank at his Lilliputian best. Heroes of the Peace Conference and Chinese battles share the public gaze with feasts and festivals, politics and pantomime. The glittering roofs of great exhibitions rise above the fog of war, whilst an eager public crowds to the Derby Day, to London spectacles, or the ‘glorious’ naval review at Portsmouth. And, at a distance removed, trailing in the wake of this blaze of show business, far off in the top corner of the image, Captain Robert McClure enacts the discovery of ‘the long-looked-for, longdisputed North West Passage’.15 It is tempting to declare polar exploration the bright sensation which storms across the page of the nineteenth century, as many histories have done, over-exaggerating its importance. A concentrated study of exploration’s imaginative reach inevitably tends to make it loom too large. So, its useful to remember from the outset that polar exploration was, for the most part, of marginal importance to the national attention, just one of many appealing pageants in the year’s cycle of spectacle and performance. Another tendency of hagiographic\n\n2. ‘Passing Events; or, The Tail of the Comet of 1853’, etched and designed by George Cruikshank.\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\npolar histories has been to think of exploration as something that was universally popular, which of course it wasn’t. Though polar explorers were generally received with kind feelings, particularly if they managed to bring their crews safely home, hearty congratulations were tempered at almost every moment with mixed reviews in the press; both reasonable criticism and, at times, bitter condemnation. Changing public ideas of the value of exploration require further consideration. Men like Sir John Barrow and Sir Clements Markham, among others who we meet in this book, went to great lengths to convince the British people of the merits of polar exploration as an appropriate peacetime project. Had exploration been universally popular during the century then its prime advocates would not have had to lobby so vigorously on its behalf. A variety of individuals and institutions promoted invented traditions of polar heroics that could chime with public sympathies. They constructed imaginary goals – a ‘Northwest Passage’, a ‘Farthest North’, to ‘conquer the Pole’ – that could capture attentions, motivate servicemen, persuade governments to ﬁnance their ambitious proposals, maybe even to sell their products or advertise the latest polar show. Narratives shaped public understanding, narratives circumscribed the actions of explorers at home and in the ﬁeld, and narratives informed the responses of exploration’s considerable audience. Exploration was theatre and its representation a series of performances. Exploration results, and the idea of whether an expedition was successful or not, depended as much upon what happened as what was represented, or what was imagined to have happened.16 Perception was as important as fact. Polar exploration and discovery are inherently ‘performative’; images of achievement and success are often created out of invisible accomplishments, and depend almost entirely upon the way they are re-enacted back at home.17 To reach the North Pole is, perhaps, the ultimate gesture of performance, a ‘conquest’ in the absence of any obvious features, a total whiteness, the remarkable ambition to replace a space on the chart with a few lines and yet another blankness. Within a barrage of narratives – of progress, patriotism, science, and discovery – the image of exploration in the nineteenth century was freighted with multiple and contested meanings, and sustained by a rapidly expanding visual culture. In theatres, in art, in verse and song, the achievements of explorers were performed before the public gaze, 7\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\n3. John Franklin recalled as ‘polar hero’ in the Pictorial Chronicles of the Mighty Deep, published by Warne, 1880.\n\ncirculated, promoted, justiﬁed, debated, scrutinised, celebrated, and manipulated, whilst explorers themselves became, willingly or otherwise, the subjects of signiﬁcant attention, often idolised and admired, sometimes ridiculed, even viliﬁed. Visions of exploration could be packaged into positive and potent iconographies: in ofﬁcial narratives, in the display of artefacts and relics, polar spectacles and panoramas, or in grandiloquent oils on canvas. 8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs Chapter 1 demonstrates, the Arctic became a new theatre of war in which the Navy could refashion a role for itself. Voyages were calculated to renew the image of the Admiralty, an opportunity for restoring naval prestige in the eyes of a weary nation. Sustained by hagiography and sailing with a stiff wind of maritime idealism, polar exploration became, to borrow a modern term, an expedient ‘PR exercise’ for a service looking to maintain its post-war public proﬁle. Some regarded exploration as a campaign that approached military combat in the virtues it demanded of its participants, while most applauded Arctic service as a substitute for the experience of combat at sea. Here was a form of ‘colonial warfare’ that appeared to be about heroic action, which could afford the luxury of chivalric codes, in theory if not in practice, and which lent itself to art and literature. Managed and manipulated in this way, Arctic campaigns ﬁtted perfectly a number of cultural and literary traditions of the period: the adventure ideal testing bravery and character, the enthusiasm for knightly virtues, heightened moral absolutism, and a fascination with individual action in the service of the state. Four ships left British waters in 1818 with the combined prestige of the service and the nation resting on their shoulders. As the century progressed naval explorers met the challenges and dangers of the Arctic wilderness in the name of Queen and Country, and became living (and dying) symbols of national and heroic idealism. By the end of the century, in a speech to mark the half-centenary of Sir John Franklin’s fateful expedition, the naval explorer Sir Leopold McClintock would declare: In laying down their lives at the call of duty our countrymen bequeathed to us a rich gift – another of those noble examples not yet rare in our history, and of which we are all so justly proud, one more beacon light to guide our sons to deeds of heroism in the future. These examples of unﬂinching courage, devotion to duty, and endurance of hardships are as life-blood to naval enterprise.18\n\nIn rhetorical ﬂourishes such as this, Arctic exploits assumed the dimensions of an allegory of good versus evil, a testing ground for British hardihood that could provide uplifting examples. But this ﬂorid language of heroism was not merely a tool for the orator, the lecturing 9\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\n4. ‘The Arctic Regions, showing the North-West Passage of Captain McClure and other Arctic Voyagers’, compiled by Hugh Johnson, 1865.\n\n10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nexplorer, or city showman, but was a widely cherished nineteenthcentury ideal, genuinely supported across all levels of society. As Chapter 1 shows, in the light of immediate naval requirements, the ways in which exploration was spoken about, represented and reinterpreted is revealing. Moving away from a historiographical focus on exploration as just a ﬁeld-based pursuit, we can make new discoveries. It becomes clear that polar voyaging was a complex cultural activity and it is only by engaging the relationships between actors, institutions, and a range of audiences that exploration can be fully understood.\n\nA HAGIOGRAPHY OF ACTION\n\nThe earth is a stage and though it may be an advantage, even to the right comprehension of the play, to know its exact conﬁguration, it is always the drama of human endeavour that will be the thing, with a ruling passion expressed by outward action marching perhaps blindly to success or failure, which themselves are often undistinguishable from each other at ﬁrst.19\n\nIn recent years historians have paid attention to the intellectual contexts in which projects of exploration were conducted, emphasising in particular the relationships between expeditions and imperial ambitions.20 In this new historiography an equally taxing question has been how to deal with explorers themselves. Recent work on geographical traditions has remedied this to a great degree, though the problem has shifted to the placing of explorers back into a revised history of empire.21 It has also been difﬁcult to position the ﬁeld itself as a location of culture, a space that will be thought of here as both a material and an imaginative landscape. Exploration may be understood as a set of cultural practices which involve the ‘mobilization of people and resources especially equipment, publicity and authority’ – an idea best expressed as cultures of exploration – which enables us to situate the travel and narratives of individual explorers within a wider context. Geographical exploration did not merely overcome distance, as Felix Driver has demonstrated so ably; it helped create a range of ‘imaginative geographies’.22 Joseph Conrad, we remember, once 11\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\ndescribed explorers as ‘conquerors of truth’, not because they exposed the inner secrets of distant regions, but rather because they established particular ways of reading unknown landscapes.23 Some scholars have focussed more explicitly on narrative as a form of ﬁeld practice itself and as a vital element of the traveller’s weaponry. Narrative, deﬁned as a ‘technology of travel’, can embody storytelling to orientate a traveller, to justify an individual’s actions, to create achievements and embellish discoveries, or to give credence to a scientiﬁc discipline.24 It is equally useful to appreciate the role of narrative in creating the image of the heroic explorer, and the role of narrative as a sequence of strategic practices aimed at legitimising exploration itself. We have the opportunity now to bring polar explorers within an academic gaze that is examining the reception of geographical knowledge in context, and to do so in ways attentive to textual and visual culture, narrative and depiction. We realise the situated nature of knowledge.25 To cite McNeil, now is a good time to explore ‘the autonomous generation of meanings . . . in a variety of sites’.26 Whilst developments in Paciﬁc and African exploration historiography have opened up rewarding new areas of academic research, it is only relatively recently that the polar regions have been approached with a new scrutiny.27 Though traditional histories of the Arctic have tended to be dominated by general accounts, narrowly focussed biographies or bare chronologies, new aspects of Arctic history are being recovered. Cawood’s early studies of the Victorian ‘Magnetic Crusade’ for example, placed Arctic exploration ‘squarely within the compass of international networks of Humboldtian science’.28 Levere’s Science and the Canadian Arctic demonstrated the range and quantity of nineteenth-century polar science conducted under the banner of British exploration.29 Some have looked at the aesthetic contexts of Arctic exploration, describing ways that the sublime polar space could be a source of both exultation and terror, and improving our understanding of contemporary imaginations considerably.30 The search for an elusive ‘Northwest Passage’, and for the missing Franklin expedition, became icon-forming tests of the prowess of English virtue in a place of monstrous icebergs and inhuman coldness. Naval heroism, discovery and progress, the superiority of western technologies, were all narratives predicated on a hostile and empty Arctic periphery. For most audiences Arctic exploration was, above all, a human drama. 12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5. ‘Return of the Arctic Expedition’, The Pictorial World, 4 November 1876.\n\n13\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\n6. Advertising handbill for Rignold’s ‘Panorama of the Arctic Regions’, 1883.\n\n14\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n‘Explorations’, wrote Carl Sauer, ‘have been the dramatic reconnaissances of geography’, a natural theatre in which the actions of individuals predominate. The Arctic offered an appealing blank stage, a distant space of adventure for reﬂecting and redeﬁning one’s sense of self.31 Some scholars have considered how polar exploration provided a stage for national fantasy – in penetrating studies of polar myth in the former Soviet Union, and within Nazi propaganda – though, remarkably, British Arctic exploration has received only limited academic attention.32 Fewer still have attempted to understand the machinery of mythmaking that made heroes of its naval ofﬁcers. The experience of explorers in the Arctic, what they did and how they acted, were subject to a heterogeneous mix of pressures and socio-political mores: nationalist designs, the ideals of heroic personae, the demands of science, the needs of their own individual career advancement, and military and governmental requirements. There would be a delicate bargain between all of these imperatives and expectations. Polar endeavour existed as a complex cultural construction within the public domain, represented in various forms, re-enacted before a range of audiences, and remembered in changing, and often surprising, ways. Reception theory has thus far been chieﬂy concerned with textual meaning and with the history of political ideas, but we can look to the history of exploration and to its enduring iconographies to offer new avenues of research across disciplines.33 Understanding how explorers have been thought about and publicly commemorated over time and space demands the relinquishing of essentialist claims to the nature of geographical knowledge; shifting from an excessive focus on ofﬁcial texts and travel narratives to popular engagements with exploration, and with explorers themselves. In revisiting the lives, and afterlives, of some nineteenth-century explorer-heroes we can consider a range of new sources. This is a wide realm of representation that complements and enriches what we know about geography’s diverse histories.\n\nREALMS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nWith this challenge set, Chapter 2 examines the imaginative legacy of the most famous naval hero of all, Admiral Lord Nelson. A necessary 15\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nstage in the assessment of any historical ﬁgure is the identiﬁcation of the legendary aspects that shape their reputation, and recent biographers have begun the job of attempting to differentiate the man from the myth. The tale of the young Nelson engaging a huge polar bear on an ice ﬂoe off Spitsbergen in 1773 has been met with varying degrees of delight and dismissal through the years, yet examining its evolution can improve our understanding of the way Nelson has been remembered. This chapter engages the machinery of naval mythmaking to look at the variety of texts and iconographies that sustained the image of the hero in the public eye. This approach also enables us to track changing enthusiasms for the Arctic in the nineteenth century and to make an entry into the visual and written culture of exploration. In a broader sense, examining the literary and visual manifestations of Nelson’s encounter with the bear is a useful historiographical exercise into the genesis of heroic myth. At a simple, denotative level we have an image of a midshipman engaging a bear. At a connotative level the image carries associations with young Nelson’s ‘youthful intrepidity’, and the hostile conditions of the Arctic more generally. At a mythic level there are multiple meanings, allegorical, imaginative and ideological: it is a metaphor of man conquering nature; a vision laden with the historical connections of Britain, her Navy and the polar regions; a formative experience in the making of a maritime hero. This chapter attempts to explain the deep-rooted British attraction to the spirit of exploration and the ways that this interest brings forward multiple images. In providing an insight in the iconography of Nelson, my analysis attempts to understand the symbols associated with the encounter episode, and to learn more about the aesthetic and imaginative conditions that sustained these images. Examining just one small part of the Nelson mythology enables us to consider the commemorative trajectory of the hero, to follow the art of biography, and to enjoy a canvas of appealing iconographies. It is clear that much of heroic imagining rests upon falsehood and part truths, a web of idealised narratives and romanticisms. Work by historians such as Lynn Hunt and James Epstein, inﬂuenced by the cultural anthropology of Clifford Geertz and others, has led to an emphasis on the importance of ‘symbolic practice’ – ﬂags, processions, rituals, and potent images – in the negotiation of political and social meaning.34 This kind of approach has redeﬁned our perceptions of 16\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwhat realms of representation constitute, extending beyond written and verbal discourse to the ‘languages’ of costume, gesture, and the performative act. If there is a problem in this kind of cultural history, it lies in a tendency to overcompensate for previous neglect of these languages by underestimating the signiﬁcance of the written discourses in which they are embedded. We only have access to such symbolic practices through the mediation of a text, whether in the form of an ofﬁcial narrative, newspaper accounts, or works of imaginative literature. My analysis assumes the impossibility of ever being able to retrieve what ‘really’ happened in a particular event. Like a game of Chinese whispers, truths are distorted away from the ﬁeld as they are retold and refashioned. What we can be sure of is that some texts are more privileged than others, and it is certainly useful therefore to try to understand how and why particular types of representation dominate. We can also try to translate the cultural language of exploration, notably the rhetoric and iconography of discovery. For acts of exploration, it soon becomes clear that ‘truth’ existed, in so much, in its ability to be represented and reenacted in appealing forms that could capture public interest, and in languages that could satisfy diverse audiences. Each of my chapters examines the various ways that Arctic news was presented at different moments in the century, considering what sort of information people might have had access to, informing the judgements they made about exploration’s ongoing value and future success. That there were mixed opinions suggests Barrow’s need for a totalising rhetoric of national and naval achievement. In the face of ambivalence, and sometimes a real hostility to continuing with the polar project, his energy in constantly creating and promoting a dominant narrative is impressive. Nelson’s polar engagement provided an iconography that was circulated, reused, and long cherished, yet as the century progressed there would be many new images of the Navy amongst the ice – whether Parry’s crews over-wintering, the imagined memory of Franklin’s noble death, or the ‘ennobling toil’ of men hauling sledges to a new ‘Farthest North’. Some images of the Navy, despite failure, could be source for great celebration: at other moments the naval explorer could equally be exposed to criticism, even sharp satire. I chose Nelson, the most conspicuous naval hero whose image as an explorer was manipulated after his death, because this story had never 17\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nbeen analysed. In Chapter 3 I will look at another naval ﬁgure imagined as a hero, a man who has been the subject of a good deal of popular attention yet, thus far, no academic scrutiny.\n\nPOLAR CELEBRITY\n\nStill attending to visual culture and popular literature, the next stage of this study considers a succession of heroic images drawn from a focussed period: the years 1833 – 5. John Barrow was clearly responsible for cultivating an enduring myth of the naval explorer-hero, yet extending the story beyond him we see that there were many individuals that played their part in inventing appealing histories and shaping the public imagining. And sometimes, much to Barrow’s annoyance, an explorer made his own stage and went off script. In a move that foreshadowed other explorers much later in the century, John Ross took a remarkably active role in promoting his own exploits. As a performative act it can be said there was no absolute truth, merely accounts borne back as baggage, and explorers could shape their own truths.35 Escaping from the Arctic in 1833 after an absence of four years, Ross was widely celebrated in Britain and quickly became one of the most well-known ﬁgures of the day. Having courted controversy throughout his career, his providential return to London was in many ways a passage of redemption and the public responded eagerly to news of his successes. He orchestrated his homecoming by energetically constructing, and defending, his image as an explorer. He commissioned heroic portraits to be sold as engraved souvenirs, he arranged exhibitions of his equipment and polar artefacts, he provided his own watercolours and sketches for public display, and in other ways oversaw a ﬁxed-circle panorama in Leicester Square, provincial theatrical performances, a touring show of dioramic paintings, and a massive outdoor entertainment with papier-maˆche´ icebergs seventy feet tall. His impact on the visual culture of Arctic representations was considerable and inﬂuenced many later productions. Tracking the ups and downs of Ross’s contemporary reputation, Chapter 3 springs again from an extensive study of primary and secondary materials: original manuscripts and correspondence, 18\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nnewspapers and periodical reviews, theatre playbills, illustrated souvenirs and pamphlets, and a selection of adult and juvenile literature. Scrutinising these sources also helps us to think more about the nature of celebrity in the 1830s, and the central role of theatre and spectacle in this process, redrawing a proﬁle of popular opinions surrounding exploration itself. Sensitive to the production and consumption of knowledge, this kind of contextual approach can bring exploration scholarship far beyond the conventional narrative history. From the columns of leading editorials in metropolitan newspapers, through a range of popular journals, among debates in the House of Commons, to picking up the tunes of the bawdy songs of quayside drinking dens, we can follow a variety of contrasting accounts. By reclaiming a range of contemporary voices the history of exploration comes alive.\n\nNEWFANGLED TECHNOLOGY\n\nIf Chapter 3 is essentially all about a homecoming, then Chapter 4 has the aim of learning more about the intense period of lobbying that foreshadowed a new departure. We can consider an expedition that never managed to win public or governmental support and ask why this was the case? Gaining an insight into the culture of technological change, we discover the difﬁcult domestic terrain in which polar explorers had to promote themselves, an infrastructure of exclusion that disabled individuals from advancing their polar ambitions. Turning our attention away from Ross, we recover the polar career of another naval ofﬁcer gripped by the appeal of exploration. Commander John P. Cheyne is a forgotten actor in the history of nineteenth-century polar voyages yet, like Ross, for a short moment he became a renowned public ﬁgure. Until this work there has been no biographical treatment and no image had been republished. You can see Cheyne for the ﬁrst time here. A veteran of three expeditions in search of the missing Franklin party, his retirement was unusual to say the least. He ﬁrst announced his grand plans to discover the North Pole by balloon late in 1876, after the disappointing return of the Nares expedition, and embarked on a transatlantic lecture tour in an effort to raise funds. It was a novel proposal that captured public 19\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nimaginations but also drew criticism and ridicule. Though Cheyne was for many years a bright personality in the ﬁeld of exploration, both aeronautical pioneer and itinerant showman, he was increasingly maligned as a charlatan and lunatic and his innovative visions for polar ﬂight were abandoned. Writing a chapter on an expedition that never happened may seem an odd way to think about exploration, but it can be revealing. As I’ve already suggested, a history of polar endeavour can be written just as proﬁtably about the ways expeditions were imagined at home, as it can by writing an account of action in the ﬁeld. We are able to get a sense of the currents of public feeling about the value of exploration; we can listen to debates over new techniques of polar travel; and we can witness the changing image of the explorer. Appetites for news of the latest Arctic discoveries were satisﬁed by a vibrant public culture of performance, a swirl of exhibitions, spectacles and panorama, and we see much of this in the present world of adventure too. Though he failed to ﬂy to the Pole, Cheyne was a pioneer of sorts, as the ﬁrst polar explorer to become a professional lecturer.\n\nSPECTACLES AND SHOWMEN\n\nDespite the obvious popularity of the polar shows, not to mention their national coverage, very little is known about the new breed of itinerant lecturers. So, I attempt to follow Cheyne on his travels – offering the ﬁrst geography of polar lecturing – which is a difﬁcult task as you have to trawl an almost limitless array of local newspapers, playbills, and print ephemera. This chapter should demonstrate though that with a little patience we might achieve a comparable depth of analysis for other explorers, and in the process begin to understand far more about the many ways that audiences came to see the Arctic regions. As the returning-hero, Ross’s principal stage was the panorama and a lavish outdoor spectacle. As the aspirant-hero, Cheyne became the master of the magic lantern and public lecture, in hoping to persuade the nation to join his leap of faith and back a pioneering balloon attempt. Modern adventurers continue to resurrect the myths of the past and they utilise all manner of media to advance their reputations in the hope of 20\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsecuring funding, public recognition, or coverage for their expeditions – whether in photography, ﬁlm, exhibition displays, online blogs, or in extravagant publicity stunts. Paying equal attention to the visual culture of polar expeditions before, during, and after, helps us to better contextualise exploration and its hand on the public imagination. Extending this analysis of the Victorian business of exploration, in Chapter 5 we make a visit to the century’s most signiﬁcant polar show. Overlooked by historians, the Royal Naval Exhibition of 1891 offers many entry points to this discussion of exploration’s culture. We can think more about the machinery of naval mythmaking and reconsider the ideology of polar exploration in the context of political debate surrounding naval reforms. Again, this chapter draws upon an extensive study of diverse primary source materials and highlights the continuing imaginative potential of the Arctic as a resource for imperial visions. In particular, I examine the role of the RNE in displaying the ‘heroic martyrdom’ of John Franklin and shaping his posthumous reputation, a tentative foray into a fascinating ﬁeld; an exercise in the ideology of reputation and, at least by implication, the relationships between the creation of reputation and the writing of history. Reconsidering the largest polar exhibition ever mounted we can recover an unparalleled material record of the reinvented cult of exploration. The chief organiser of this Arctic spectacle, Clements Markham, hoped that displaying the polar heroes of the past would bolster his ambitions for future exploration.36 It is intriguing to look more closely at Markham’s role as a polar lobbyist in this period. It was a ‘Heroic Age’ captured in texts and images that sustained a renaissance of maritime romanticism and polar imagining, and which swept Captain Scott to the edges of the map at the beginning of a new century. Today the Arctic remains a region of challenge and a focus of heart’s desire: a contested space where individuals and nations imprint their fantasies. In cities far to the south narratives are still being scripted about this remarkable place and Chapter 6 will reﬂect on this by considering some modern incarnations of Arctic activity. Our new sources are photocalls and press releases, online blogs and news feeds, old ships and yet more expeditions; it’s a time of celebrated discoveries and renewed dreams. No longer Nelson and his bear, of course, but the curious power of imaginative geography continues.\n\n21\n\n7. ‘Markham Reaches the Highest Latitude’, in Prescott Holmes, The Story of Exploration and Adventure in the Frozen Seas, published by Altemus, 1896.\n\n1\n\nOn Naval Heroes\n\nTo what purpose could a portion of our naval force be, at any time, but more especially in time of profound peace, more honourably or more usefully employed than in completing those details of geographical and hydrographical science of which the grand outlines have been boldly and broadly sketched by Cook, Vancouver and Flinders, and others of our countrymen?1\n\nIn 1818 the Arctic geography of North America, the existence of a navigable northwest passage, even the insularity of Greenland were problems yet resolved, blanks on the polar map. In John Barrow’s Chronological History of Voyages into the Arctic Regions the coast of northern Siberia winds away for thousands of miles. In comparison there is nothing of the northern coastline of Canada save two widely separate points: points set down by Samuel Hearne and Alexander Mackenzie where each had explored a river to its junction with the polar sea.2 The incomplete map of the Arctic region cried out for reﬁnement and completion, and these points beckoned out of the encompassing emptiness, inspiring imaginations, summoning men to further exploration. Over the course of the century in an unprecedented spate of treks, expeditions, disasters and triumphs, the secrets of this coastline would be unravelled, a passage in all its tortuous complexity revealed. The North Pole would remain hidden beyond ramparts of ice for the whole century, an elusive prize waiting to be won. As an introduction to polar and naval hagiography, and to the context of naval reform, this chapter examines the representation of explorers and naval ofﬁcers in literature and art to consider multiple, and varying, deﬁnitions of heroism throughout the nineteenth century. The scientiﬁc challenge of the Arctic mostly came second to the\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\n8. ‘A Tribute to the Memory of the late Vice Admiral Lord Viscount Nelson’, commemorative print after John Hopkins, 1 January 1806.

This chapter also develops the new historiography of the heroic reputation, evaluating the ways that personalities have been constructed and embellished, both during and after their lifetimes. Nelson clearly looms large in this pantheon of service. 24\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\nNAVY AND NATION\n\nThe arrival of peace brought massive disarmament, social unrest, and severe economic retrenchment to a war-weary nation. Whereas exploration as an activity has been traditionally translated as an expression of imperialist power, Arctic voyages in the immediate years after Waterloo took place at a time of ﬁscal restriction and national unease. At the height of the Napoleonic Wars in 1809 the British Navy was the most powerful in history and had swelled to proportions that would not be equalled for a century: 773 ships, 4,444 ofﬁcers and some 140,000 sailors. By 1817 the ﬁgure had fallen to thirteen ships of the line and some 23,000 seamen. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, forty years later, the manpower was a meagre 45,000, and even in 1900 it had only risen to 112,000.3 Whilst regular sailors were discharged relatively easily, ofﬁcers were career men; they had political clout and they could not be dismissed so freely. In fact their numbers increased until the Navy, in 1818, had one ofﬁcer for every four men. But ninety percent of these ofﬁcers had nothing to do; of 1,151 ofﬁcers on the lists in 1846 only 172 were in full employment. Exploration and survey can be regarded as a useful employment for a peacetime navy, a suitable outlet for the skills of trained ofﬁcers. Taking the lead in renewing attentions to polar exploration, during the ﬁrst sixty years of the nineteenth century no fewer than 190 Admiralty ships were employed on missions of discovery. Before John Franklin’s last expedition in 1845 the Admiralty had been responsible for ten expeditions to ‘battle’ to ﬁnd a northwest passage or to ‘lay siege’ to the North Pole.4 In an inﬂuential essay published anonymously in The Quarterly Review in 1817, John Barrow, Second Secretary to the Admiralty, spelt out his convictions for Arctic discovery. He warned that the Russians were ‘strongly impressed with the idea of an open passage around America’, declaring that ‘it would be mortifying if a naval power but of yesterday could complete a discovery in the nineteenth century, which was so happily commenced by Englishmen in the sixteenth’.5 Barrow grew impatient with those who thought the exploration of the Arctic to be a useless project, and for the whole of his life he remained convinced of the broad beneﬁts of discovery voyages.6 But this is perhaps not enough to explain how the Admiralty was able to 25\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\n9. The cartographic temptation of the unknown, the alluringly empty chart from John Barrow’s Chronological History of Voyages into the Arctic Regions, 1818.\n\nmobilise government and popular support for the ventures. Barrow submitted expedition proposals as ‘worthy of research . . . no less interesting to humanity than to the advancement of science and the probable extension of commerce . . . and the facility it offers of correcting the very defective geography of the Arctic regions in our western hemisphere’.7 With an unrivalled passion, Barrow envisaged the Navy as an untapped resource for the advance of geography and hydrography. He identiﬁed more abstract scientiﬁc problems that might be resolved with valuable information gleaned from high latitudes. That the aims 26\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\nof science and empire were complementary was recognised quickly by Barrow and under his direction the Admiralty succeeded in forming an alliance with the Royal Society. Throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth century ‘science’ and the Navy were unhappy bedfellows – institutionally and practically disparate – yet Barrow was able to bring the two together, offering a variety of justiﬁcations for exploration that would have appealed and resonated with different interest groups, whilst the alliance itself was consecrated by reforms to the Board of Longitude. The Royal Society and the Admiralty would operate together under the banner of a ‘disinterested’ science, whilst at the same time the idea of exploration could also meet national and naval prestige concerns. Through the acceptance of this rationale, Barrow’s Arctic exploration programme became a matter of national imperative and moral obligation. ‘If left to be performed by some other power’, he announced many times, ‘England by her neglect of it after having opened the East and West doors should be laughed at by all the world for having hesitated to cross the threshold’. The contradictions inherent in his vision of progress and discovery were sustained by social hierarchies and controlled by the Navy with the support of the Geographical Society of London, the Royal Society, the King and Parliament. In a career devoted to lobbying and promoting exploration, Barrow cultivated the public image of explorers, endowing exploration with value, to counter the great many critics who questioned the usefulness of these voyages. Barrow’s historiography of exploration, a personally constructed Arctic myth, predominated throughout the century. Evaluating the merits of polar voyages by 1845, unsurprisingly, Barrow remained committed to their beneﬁts. Beyond the long list of scientiﬁc justiﬁcations, exploration’s fundamental value lay in its instructive potential. He summarised his life’s labours as a polar publicist: a career devoted to ‘the instruction of a class of readers in the record of achievements of their countrymen’, and to ‘popularise the fame of gallant and enduring men’.8 Moral achievement, perilous danger, and individual action were key components of this vision. Deliberately cultivating a myth of piety, fortitude, and duty, Barrow invented a tradition of national enterprise that could be robust even through failure.9 Barrow’s efforts drew praise from Francis Egerton, Lord Ellesmere, who saw in exploration the potential to 27\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nvivify the public’s impression of their Navy: ‘a more enviable position on the record of human achievement we can hardly conceive than that which will be enjoyed by the leaders of these various expeditions by sea and land . . . adorning our history with exhibitions of stern resolution coupled with the purest humanity’.10 Explorers took the stage as ‘heroes in a long and varied Saga of northern adventure’, prime examples raised for emulation for those within the service and those who could enjoy reading about their deeds, ‘for nothing is more remarkable than that wonderful pertinacity in enterprise which maritime pursuits have the power to generate’. His narrative imagining of naval engagement was a romanticised ideal, yet it was one that could be of beneﬁt to everyone concerned, particularly so for the Navy. The post-war naval ‘crisis’ was not only one of size, but also one of identity.\n\nA CENTURY OF CHANGE\n\nInterest in Arctic exploration may be justiﬁed in the context of Admiralty weakness. After the cessation of war with France, domestic interests soon marginalised the Navy, which proved painfully slow to adjust to a different, increasingly commercial, world and reassess its relevance to a post-war society that had fewer pressing martial preoccupations.11 For the Navy, as with the nation, it was an age of reform and technological revolution. In this context of change it is no surprise that heroic images, a construction of an imagined chivalrous past, found a receptive audience. Projected in an appealing light, polar exploration was an expedient national advertisement for the Navy, for its ongoing vitality and the spirit of its seamen, and the Admiralty seized its potential to generate positive publicity. In the absence of any major crisis abroad the Navy was highly vulnerable to spending cutbacks and demands for retrenchment were insistent: more than twenty-ﬁve percent of all reports about the Navy appearing in The Times between 1815 – 25 related to calls for greater economy in the service to relieve the huge burden of national tax. Scores of ships were ‘laid up in ordinary’ and hundreds of ofﬁcers sought active employment. As the imminent reduction in manpower 28\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\nthreatened capability and its, up till now, die-cast reputation, the image of the explorer was press-ganged into service. This period was a time of profound changes in the nation’s Navy: witnessed in new uniforms, a ‘continuous service scheme’ which dispensed with impressments, the increased respectability of life at sea and the movement to humanise punishments, the restriction of grog, and, most important, far-reaching reforms of the Admiralty itself. But the naval changes that attracted most speculation and ridicule in the press, and in the increasingly popular journal Punch for example, were those of technology. However nostalgic the image of a naval supremacy secured ‘by glorious sail’ might seem – with the image of Nelson central to this imaginative makeup – it remained a key component of the service’s collective consciousness during the long Victorian period despite the fact that ‘Nelson’s Navy’ was soon but a distant memory.\n\n10. Satirising naval reform: ‘Britannia and the Admiralty’, Punch, 15 December 1849.\n\n29\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nChange was heralded by the decline of the wooden ship-of-theline, the advent of the ironclad, and the highly contested adoption of new methods of steam propulsion. The main lines along which the modern battleship evolved are now easily distinguishable: from sail to steam; from wood to iron; from guns mounted broadside to guns mounted in turrets. Yet it was not, of course, an effortless process and the public were frequently confused by the costs and the merits of this ‘progress’. And, unsurprisingly, all of these developments were chronicled and commented on in the pages of the metropolitan newspapers, journals like Punch and the rapidly expanding illustrated press. Whilst there is no space here to expand more fully on the introduction of steam propulsion into the Victorian Fleet, sufﬁce it to say, it was a trial of protracted contests and negotiations, technical difﬁculties, and, not least, considerable expense.12 Though the last battle between sailing ships was fought at Navarino in 1827, the last line-of-battle ship under sail was Sanspareil, laid down in 1851. The ﬁrst to be designed as a steamship, instead of just having auxiliary engines installed, was Agamemnon of 1852. As late as 1847, John Barrow was ridiculing the idea ‘of a ﬂeet of iron steam vessels, altogether useless, it would seem, as ships of war’.13 The ﬁrst ﬁve iron frigates built in 1845 were found to be totally inadequate. Waves of concern about the combat readiness of the British Fleet swept Westminster. Newspapers and journals ran articles on parlous armoury and the inadequacy of domestic manpower. Uneasy relations with France were exacerbated by her adventurism in Morocco, political sabre-rattling, and the channel-crossing bellicosity of Parisian commentators. In January 1848 The Times and other papers printed what, under the circumstances, could only be called a ‘bombshell’: a letter from the Duke of Wellington to Sir John Burgoyne, the inspector-general of defences, expressing his concern over the nation’s vulnerability to a continental invasion, as well as the unaddressed problems attending the Navy’s slow conversion to steam. Reaction was divided: some shared the alarm whilst others were quick to mock the idea of an invasion. The following year Rear Admiral Sir Charles Napier, commander of the Channel Fleet, wrote a series of letters on the steam ﬂeet to The Times, questioning its size, combat effectiveness, and escalating 30\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\n11. The Navy’s changing face: ‘The “British Tar” of the Future’, Punch, 12 April 1862.\n\ncosts. The Navy, he warned, was dangerously under the strength it had possessed at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. The policy of breaking up oaken warships, ‘the wooden walls’ of England, and replacing them with untried iron ones or, alternatively, ‘modernising’ dilapidated old hulks by converting them into leaky new tubs was, according to Sir Charles, misguided – even suicidal.14 Journals echoed his concerns over Admiralty retrenchment with satirical broadsides. ‘The public is aware that there is something very rotten in the state of our Navy in general’, Punch declared, ‘and a large number of screws are loose in the steam portion of it in particular’.15 Recent additions to the Fleet were described as ‘marvels of uselessness and inefﬁciency’, boilers were unprotected from the enemy’s shot, and main-deck ports were too low for their guns. For the Retribution ‘with her main-deck unarmed, utterly incapable of any retributory act’, Punch suggested the new name Tolerance, and for other ships of the line, the Hash, the Mistake, the Mess, the Bungle, the Awkward and the Clumsy.16 31\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nReacting to proposals to replace all wooden ships with ironclads, an ‘Old Salt’ would lament: Now Farewell, my trim three-decker, / Sails and spars and all farewell: Iron’s proved of wood a wrecker, / Where ’twill steer us who can tell? In glorious Nelson’s days, d’ye mind them, / Our tars were sailors every inch: Stout hearts, with pigtails stout behind them, / And ne’er a man to skulk or ﬂinch. But now – my dear eyes! British sailors / Half soldiers and half stokers are; And if we manned the ﬂeet with tailors, / ’Twould in a month be ﬁt for war.17\n\nPunch presented the new breed of mechanised British mariner, catching the public mood as technology overwhelmed the service. Songsters piped hearty ballads decrying the Navy’s changing face; the baritone Herbert Campbell earned concert-hall plaudits with The Iron-Clad Tar.18 The future promised new ships and new seamen, the ‘glorious’ age of Nelson and his ‘hearts of oak’ retreating on the horizon. In this context it is no surprise that the Navy turned to exploration to offer a rousing image of the bravery and spirit of its seaman and the capability and honour of its ofﬁcers; not mechanised and anonymous, but rugged, individual, and inspiring.\n\nTARS OF THE FUTURE\n\nWith so many changes occurring in the 1860s and 1870s it would be impossible to catalogue all of the developments in naval architecture. For our purposes, a few are enough here. The last to be built of wood were Defence and Collingwood in 1861; the ironclad Warrior, launched into a frozen Thames in 1860, was impressive with her twenty-eight guns set broadside and a speed of fourteen knots; the ﬁrst to deserve the name of a modern battleship was the Devastation of 1873, incorporating all the new developments, iron hull, screw propulsion, twenty-ﬁve-ton turrets, a ram and short signal mast;\n\n32\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\nculminating in Fisher’s revolutionary big-gun battleship Dreadnought, launched in 1906. Yet technological reform continued to injure the Navy’s domestic reputation, as public trials became embarrassing failures, all played out before an attentive, and overwhelmingly sceptical, press and relayed across the country by telegraph. On the return of the Conservatives to power in 1874 the newly appointed Admiralty First Lord George Ward Hunt produced something of a naval scare by charging his Liberal predecessors of creating a ‘mere paper navy’. Newspapers were full of shocked letters and strident editorial; engineers defended their designs in pamphlets, whilst satirists took great delight in mocking the naval leadership.19 John Tenniel, that stalwart of Punch cartooning, provided a series of illustrations that further fanned the ﬂames of debate.20 Even so, in a decade in which the service image was scrutinised as never before, Hunt was intent on expansion and campaigned vigorously for increased naval estimates. Yet at the same time he also had to account for a series of naval catastrophes, including the loss of Vanguard in a collision in 1875 and the sinking of Thunderer after a dramatic explosion in 1876, which followed so soon after the Captain tragedy had shaken the Navy’s domestic reputation.21 Cowper Coles’s controversial masted turret ship, designed with a deliberately low freeboard, was caught in a gale during trials in the Bay of Biscay on 7 September 1870, just a few months after commissioning. Her stability was insufﬁcient; she rolled and then sank without trace. Just eighteen of the ship’s complement of ﬁve hundred survived. These disasters did little to bolster public conﬁdence in the Navy or help assuage criticism over the spiralling costs of developing the Fleet.22 So, for a Navy under pressure polar heroics had great currency. In 1875 the Admiralty ﬁtted out a polar voyage in order to provide a more appealing narration of the state of the nation’s Navy.23 Lobbyists within the RGS were certain that a new polar expedition would reﬂect well on its metropolitan standing and attract new memberships too. The new Prime Minister Disraeli also supported the idea, recognising its potential to appeal to the electorate, its spirit keenly ﬁtting with imperially minded popular politics. It is clear that Disraeli turned to foreign adventurism and imperial expansion to side-step potential social unrest, and exploration promised diverting entertainment. 33\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nA new polar voyage was a perfect expression of his new vision for Britain, energetic, self-conﬁdent, and patriotic. ‘Her Majesty’s Government have determined to lose no time in organizing a suitable expedition’, he would write, because of ‘the importance of encouraging that spirit of maritime enterprise which has ever distinguished the English people’.24 Most of all though it was a naval affair. A series of lavish banquets made heroes of the ofﬁcers even before they had departed; poets and composers hoped to proﬁt, offering eulogia to their bravery; an onboard Arctic exhibition allowed visitors to meet the crew and gaze at the well-stocked ships; and a number of Admiraltyendorsed lecturers toured the country with their magic lanterns circulating positive histories of Arctic exploration which further cultivated the naval image: Thank God for noble spirits! Thank God for swelling hearts! Thank God for that bright heavenly spark through hero-souls which darts, And ﬁres them with high enterprise, and faith to bear it through; He gave them this in olden times, He gives it in the new! Stand forth ye Arctic heroes! In glorious manhood stand, And plant upon the Northern Pole the ﬂag of Eng-land.25\n\nThe Nares expedition, as we have seen, returned early from the North; its crews weakened by scurvy, and having failed to win the Pole, the main objective.26 Yet the explorers were warmly received when they struggled home and in the immediate afterglow of ‘victory’ their achievements were reconstructed and eulogised. A ‘New Farthest North’ had been reached – bettering a ﬁfty year old record set by Edward Parry back in 1827 – and this was ﬂagged as the expedition’s primary success. It was imagined in heroic oils on canvas, allegorical images of the conquest ﬁlled illustrated journals and popular lectures, and stirring descriptions of the journey, provided by the Admiralty, appeared in almost every newspaper in the country. ‘So long as our naval ofﬁcers and ﬁrst-class seamen are made of such stuff’, wrote The Times, ‘we may conﬁdently trust them with the honour and interests of the country, whether it be their duty to ﬁght with men or the elements’.27 The Queen sent her congratulations. An Arctic Medal was struck and given to each member of the expedition, whilst Nares 34\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\n12. ‘A Cold Reception and A Warm Welcome’, Punch, 11 November 1876.\n\nlectured in St James’s Hall before the Prince of Wales and was honoured with the RGS Founders Gold Medal. With an eager Ward Hunt in tow, he dined with the Queen at Windsor Castle, and would return there in December to collect a knighthood. The poet Thomas Lee Smith praised the expedition – ‘the venturous toil, of the Sons of British soil’ – and others rushed to offer their own tributes: Gallant band! We give you welcome! Honour, credit and renown Are yours. To Endless ages shall your noble names go down! You have storm’d the Arctic fortress – you have braved the Frozen Sea; In the grateful Heart of England your memorial you see! Hail! ‘Discovery’ – we greet you! Hail! ‘Alert’ – we give you joy! Every English man and maiden, every English girl and boy Dwells with patriotic fervour on the bright historic page Which narrates how British seamen solved the riddle of the age!28\n\nAs an expedition that, as the facts stand, could be equally described as an embarrassing and disappointing failure (it was to be the last naval voyage sent in search of the Pole), the Navy nevertheless looked to the expedition to provide a rousing narrative of competence and 35\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nhardihood. The expedition’s failures were re-scripted into a sequence of exploits from which value could be derived: Albert Markham and his team had shown their mettle by sledging to that ‘Farthest North’; new coastlines had been charted by a succession of other sledge teams, their chivalric pennants trailing behind them as they ventured courageously into the unknown; and throughout, the crews had struggled on with ‘honour’, ‘vigour’, and an ‘admirable piety’ that was supposed ﬁtting for the new make-up of the late-Victorian sailor. As Nares himself said many times, his men had ‘done their Christian duty’. Following many more years of difﬁcult reform and technological transformation, by 1891 the Navy was again in need of a new national imagining. Soon all talk in London was of the Royal Naval Exhibition, which would go on to impress over two million visitors during the short summer season. We will look more closely at this show in Chapter 5. Sufﬁce to say, it was a resoundingly popular pageant of naval heritage and new industrial capabilities. ‘Monster’ munitions of war, torpedo boats, and submarine technologies were celebrated alongside a sweeping narrative history of British maritime supremacy. It reintroduced the Nelson story to a generation who had never known of the necessities of war.29 In the exhibition grounds were a full-sized replica of his ﬂagship and a panorama of Trafalgar ‘gloriously displaying the decisive moment at which victory was secured for the nation’. It was all keenly timed too, in a period of unprecedented political, economic and diplomatic competition from other nations. In the hands of lobbyists calling for increased public commitment and governmental investment to expand the Fleet, the image of Nelson had great rallying utility. In the 1890s his memory was reinvigorated as the embodiment of the ‘maritime heritage’ of the nation; an historical and imaginative link to a glorious past and a comforting ideal of British seamanship and resolve for a troubling future, in a world grinding on its axis inexorably toward war. Punch responded in kind by dedicating its one-hundredth volume to the memory of Nelson, ‘tutelary deity of the Naval Exhibition’ and ‘Father’ of the peace enjoyed, for now at least, by the maturing Empire. But what did this all mean? How and why were these images recalled, and what exactly was this ideal that naval lobbyists were so quick to evoke? How was it that naval ofﬁcers, as heroes, could continue to inspire public imaginations? 36\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\n13. The sufferings and success of a new generation of Arctic heroes provided ample material for a special edition of The Graphic in November 1876.\n\n37\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nCHIVALRY OF THE SEA\n\nOver the warring waters, beneath the wandering skies, The heart of Britain roameth, the Chivalry of the Sea . . .

Benbow, Collingwood, Byron, Blake, Hail to the Kings of the Sea! Admirals all, for England’s sake, Honour be yours and fame! And honour, as long as waves shall break, To Nelson’s peerless name!31\n\nSaved by the hand of an admirer, heroes join ranks in a rich historical canvas of naval achievement. Nelson is pre-eminent, surrounded by the familiar faces of illustrious comrades and those ‘Admiral Worthies’ that would be immortalised in Henry Newbolt’s eulogy to the maritime past. Polar explorers take their place in this pantheon too: directly behind Nelson is Leopold McClintock; far to their right William Parry and John Ross; and up at the top, the image of James Cook shoulders John Franklin, the cherished ‘polar knight’.32 The Poet Laureate Robert Bridges shared Newbolt’s admiration for naval heroes, also quoted above. He turned his pen to a subject that had captured the minds of many people throughout the nineteenth century. This ‘grand style’ of heroic action, to borrow Reynolds’s conception in Discourse on Art, came directly from Scott’s recreations of the feudal past; from Byron’s Childe Harold, where the ‘aspirations of the mind after greatness and true glory’ were stoked by a portrait gallery of great men, ancient and modern; and, most of all, from the Napoleonic Wars.33 The evocation of Britain’s seaborne legacy was a maritime romanticism shaped by great poets before him – Robert Southey, Wordsworth, Tennyson – and which sustained an ideal of national service that found active articulation in the expanding Empire. Naval ofﬁcers provided inspirational examples and their 38\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\nmemories were cherished by generations brought up on the victories of the past. ‘The Victorians’, wrote Edmund Gosse, ‘carried admiration to the highest pitch. They marshalled it, they deﬁned it, they turned it from a virtue into a religion, and called it Hero-Worship’.34 Though one may think of hero-worship as a peculiarly nineteenth-century phenomenon, recent studies have shown how heroic representation has, of course, a much longer history than this. For example, some historians have become increasingly attentive to anniversaries, thanksgivings, processions, and parades – and the realms of symbolism and ritual – that were very much a part of Georgian society. This cultural perspective has revised our notion of the ‘popular’, which can no longer be consigned unproblematically to the actions and aspirations of the subaltern classes, but instead to the complex interplay of all groups that had a stake in the domestic terrain. Our notion of popular and political representation has broadened too, beyond the conﬁnes of Parliament or inaccessible literary tomes, and even the press, to include the ﬂuid cycle of city spectacle, the theatre of the street and the marketplace with their balladry, pageantry and iconography, both solemn and satiric, austere and ribald. From military painting, grand funerals, civic sculpture, metropolitan memorials, to panorama, adventure novels, and public-house songs, one is able to begin to understand the ways in which imagery that pantheonised national heroes could be built into the popular experience, part of the ‘web of cultural events that ebbed and ﬂowed through the country’.35 Whilst the ‘contours of support’ for admiral-heroes like Edward Vernon and Augustus Keppel have been mapped in a number of excellent studies, the details of nineteenth-century naval pageants, symbols, and narratives, have thus far eluded us.36 Work by Kathleen Wilson, Timothy Jenks, Nicholas Rogers and Gerald Jordan make us aware of the degree to which naval ofﬁcers became patriotic icons that articulated distinct political and ideological aspirations for the crowds that acclaimed them. These studies have also brought into focus the question of ‘audience’, for at almost every level there were competing interpretations, and individuals were free to make images of their heroes for themselves. The concept of heroism is dynamic, responsive to the culture and context in which imaginations ﬂourish, and it is 39\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\n14. A collage ‘Gallery of Naval Worthies’, 1890.\n\nneither necessary, nor possible in fact to provide a deﬁnitive account. But an attempt can be made to decode some of the many performances and striking iconographies that sustained the ever-changing idea of heroism throughout the nineteenth century. This section explores some of the dimensions of various identiﬁcations with perhaps the greatest ‘Admiral Hero’ of all: Horatio Nelson. 40\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\nI WILL BE A HERO\n\nFor a generation embroiled in what seemed like an endless war, imaginations cried out for a conjuring, wise, and triumphant leader. Nelson ﬁlled some of these expectations, and his high conception of his destiny in life inspired his contemporaries. In mid-1776, as a seventeen year old on Dolphin, weakened and desperately thin, having just emerged from a life-threatening attack of malaria, we are to believe he experienced an extraordinary visitation, a moment of heroic clarity: My mind was staggered with a view of the difﬁculties I had to surmount . . . I could discover no means of reaching the object of my ambition. After a long and gloomy reverie, in which I almost wished myself overboard, a sudden glow of patriotism was kindled within me, and presented my king and country as my patron. My mind exulted in the idea. ‘Well then’, I exclaimed, ‘I will be a Hero, and conﬁding in Providence I will brave every danger’.37\n\nAs if a religious conversion, the young Nelson was seized by an idea of patriotism, and he embraced it gladly in return. Within the layers of motivation, belief, expectation, self-aggrandisement, and self-possession, Nelson fulﬁlled the expectation of an archetype. His sense of daring and the totality of his style of battle; his understanding of the need for destruction as a route to creation; the acceptance of selfsacriﬁce; his portrayal of his enemy as corrupt and profoundly wicked; his ideal of England as a place of goodness and beauty: all of that fuelled his immense popularity at home. Yet by 1805 it is perfectly clear that heroism had acquired another layer. Many ofﬁcers of the Navy saw themselves as heirs, strange as this might sound, to the knights of the Middle Ages. Their sense of honour was stoked by the rich, antiquarian fuel of chivalry and the imagined and unhistorical idea that the English were, above all nations, its champions. It was to chivalry that Edmund Burke most famously appealed after the French Revolution – ‘the fresh ruins . . . which shock our feelings wherever we can turn our eyes’ – saddened by the arrival of the sterile realities of mechanistic and rational government: 41\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\n. . . the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, oeconomists, and calculators, has succeeded and the glory of Europe is extinguished for ever. Never, never more, shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submission, that digniﬁed obedience, that subordination of the heart, which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted freedom. The unbought grace of life, the chief defence of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise is gone!38\n\nHis words implied, of course, that in Britain these dignities survived. England was not the rapacious villain of the oceans, nor the usurper of nations on land; it was a ‘scept’red isle’, a ‘throne of kings’, Arthurian in its purity. ‘This England’ was still, in Lancaster’s familiar call, renowned for deeds ‘far from home, for Christian service and true chivalry’.39 It was a vision of a country that thrived on companionship, nobility, and manliness, the name not of the increasingly efﬁcient, ruthless modern state which paid for the Fleet at Trafalgar, but of a preexistent kingdom, unfettered by commercial ambitions, straining to a higher ideal. In the place of a corrupt government and an uninspiring royalty, the Navy would take the lead in nursing the nation’s youth in a renewed culture of service and hardihood. Away from the disenchantment of life in the nation’s overcrowded towns, the Fleet at sea became a place where chivalric ideals could be re-enacted, its heroes untarnished. Burke’s fantasy of the imagined nature of Englishness found a receptive audience in a country already turning toward the reassurance of the medieval, and poets, artists and authors sustained this invisible throne of self-imagining. As the national attention became consumed in war, Nelson gave birth to a ‘chivalry of the sea’, and his deeds captured the combined imaginations of his country. The ideas represented by ‘England’, ‘expectation’, ‘honour’, and ‘duty’ would sustain a ﬂeet in the horror and grief that would surround them that fateful morning on 21 October. Nelson’s status as England’s greatest modern hero was forged at the Battle of the Nile in 1798, and consecrated in the bittersweet triumph of Trafalgar. In life, his popular celebrity was unprecedented: in death, his image was romanticised, embellished, and endlessly re-imagined, assuming mythic proportions. It became 42\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\nincreasingly difﬁcult to discern the real Nelson and his deeds behind the massive and diverse forms of hero-worship that enveloped him. An iconic hero, venerated in poetry, eulogies, in art and on stage, his status soared to that of a demi-god, saintly, revered, a national ﬁgure, a sacred symbol.40 Though Trafalgar conﬁrmed Nelson’s place in the pantheon of national heroes, his life remained something of an enigma. That posterity would honour his achievements was certain, but precisely how his reputation would be remembered was less clear. His unwillingness to subordinate to the authority of his superiors, his naive but deep disdain for politicians, and his very public desertion of his wife Fanny for the tempting Emma, Lady Hamilton, all reinforced this tension between his public career, the values of polite society, and the image of what the nation wanted in its heroes. Though his undoubted courage was forever tainted by rebelliousness, vanity, and a distastefully naked ambition, Nelson’s image confronted admirers and critics alike in many forms, which could satisfy even the most sceptical. Various sectors of Georgian society competed with one another in their effort to commemorate him – and in so doing brought to the forefront cultural tensions that alternately sought to distance or bind themselves to aspects of the developing sense of national identity. At a time when war was mostly experienced through representation, the idea of the nation’s greatest battle, and with it Nelson’s dramatic death, was mediated by a barrage of written and spoken texts, sermons, biographies, monumental sculpture, popular ballads, and public spectacles, from military plays, aquatic and equestrian drama, shiplaunches, victory processions, and by imagery – portraits, prints, textiles, souvenir collectibles – and a ﬂood of emotionally charged ‘commemorabilia’.41 The rush to celebrate the hero-departed illustrates the friction to be expected from a cultural phenomenon partly motivated by consumerism, commodiﬁcation, sincere patriotism, plays for associative popularity, and outright propagandising. The lavish funeral, the spectacles and the memorials that would hold his image before the public eye and inscribe his achievements for later generations were served by a complex web of interests material, political and spiritual. If these rituals created anything for certain for British national identity, 43\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\n15. Nelson’s death inspired a cult of hero-worship. ‘The Apotheosis of Nelson’, a concept for a monument to the ‘Immortal Hero’ by Benjamin West, 1807.\n\n44\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\nthey did so on the level of equating Britons with success, British arms with triumph and British heroes with national service.42 At times Nelson would be acclaimed by radicals as well as by loyalists, and by none in more illusory and rousing terms than by his most enduring hagiographer, the future Poet Laureate Robert Southey.\n\nA NEW PATRIOTISM\n\nSouthey’s prime intention in writing his Life of Nelson was to celebrate the Admiral as a national hero – a hero of a particular kind of nation – and in doing so to reclaim him for the Establishment. In Southey’s account, Nelson’s heroism helped deﬁne English nationhood.43 If politicians may have balked at the manner of his victories, at their unorthodoxy, and his willingness to question the judgement of his superiors, the people by contrast wholly approved because they perceived Nelson’s deep and impassioned patriotism.44 In the overtly nationalistic struggle with revolutionary and imperial France, the language of patriotism was increasingly sustained by discourses of civic duty and effective action, and within the common crisis robust evocations of a national ideal provided a substantial basis for this popular patriotism. Expressions of a new benevolent paternalism, which in a larger political context might be called conservative populism, found many forms, in print and in spoken word. It was entirely predictable that loyalist groups should invoke the long-standing heritage of British naval supremacy for conservative purposes and appropriate naval victories for the cause of King and Country; a process that became commonplace from the 1790s onwards. News of naval victories were frequently accompanied by bumper celebrations that allowed loyalists to trumpet the beneﬁts of British constitutional rule and the follies of radicalism. Theatres staged impromptu re-enactments of the glorious events to the refrains of ‘God Save the King’, ‘Rule Britannia’, and ‘Britons Strike Home’. In pageantry and ritual performances even monarchs had now to court – and to ﬂatter – the people. George III and his advisers worked hard at this, seeking to erase the memory of the terrifying 1797 mutinies by holding a grand victory parade in London (at the risk of 45\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\nbeing criticised for aping the public spectacles of the French Revolution), and hiring the theatrical impresario Charles Dibdin to compose patriotic songs about brave sailor lads. ‘Long live our Seamen’, ran the opening line of one Covent Garden song, ‘Our Nation’s true Defenders’. Nor were such sentiments held only by conservatives. Britannia’s sons were championed by Major John Cartwright in 1802 as enthusiastically as any Pittite. In the Trident he advocated the building of a naval temple to celebrate ‘a thousand years of naval prowess’ and ‘heaven-born Liberty: the Guardian Genius of Britain’.45 It became increasingly clear, as the war neared its end, that late eighteenthcentury patriotism was more populist than royalist, as ‘reverential and sentimental of the plucky British tar as of the Lear-like head of state’. As The Gentleman’s Magazine noted in 1803, ‘the anchor of Great Britain’ was ‘the constitutional courage of her seamen, among whom Nelson stood highest in the pantheon of naval heroes’.46 Though the Conservative’s increasing monopoly of the patriotic language in the period between the Nile and Trafalgar was also a consequence of the eclipse of radicalism more generally, its increasing effectiveness as discourse relied on the construction of appealing and increasingly populist images, heroes ﬁghting for the national cause. It is clear that positive images of ofﬁcers, in its most obvious manifestation the Nelson-worship, served the war effort. Southey drew particular attention to three ﬁgures who came to constitute essential pillars of his new vision of patriotic history: Nelson, Wellington, and the Duke of Marlborough. In such names, he would declare, ‘nations have much of their permanent glory, and no small part of their strength’.47 Southey’s Nelson was a patriot whose instinctive sense of the nation’s interest was more authentic than the diplomatic manoeuvrings of politicians and more edifying than petty and lamentable interparty squabbling.48 Romantic portraits of the Navy could provide moral exemplars for the domestic and imperial spheres, promoting the chivalry of the sea when the chivalry of the land was in doubt. Whilst the governing aristocracy became, during the Regency, notorious for its dissolution and corruption, naval ofﬁcers presented new examples of breeding that could relocate and reassert meanings of conduct and gentlemanly behaviour. Southey’s literary idealisation of naval heroes, 46\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\nlike others who followed him, would play a signiﬁcant factor in this redeﬁnition of the social and political order. Romantics like Campbell, Bowles, and Scott would celebrate Nelson as a ‘saviour of Britain and Britishness’. Wordsworth called Nelson ‘England’s pride and treasure / Her bulwark and her tower of strength’.49 Yet Southey’s Nelson had more depth than the basic image projected in these paeans to valour. His Nelson was the model naval captain whose paternal care for those under his command was unrivalled, whilst also a man imbued with a Christian patriotism that assumed the moral primacy of a Christian public culture. He had left ‘a name and an example’, Southey wrote, ‘which are at this hour inspiring thousands of the youth of England – a name which is our pride, and an example which will continue to be our strength and shield’.50 His narrative style, an intricate weaving of naval history and patriotic rhetoric that revelled in a new loyalist vocabulary, captured the public mood and his Life of Nelson sold in great numbers. The work had ﬁrst appeared at a moment when the war with France was not yet over and Southey presented Nelson as the hero whose example and memory could inspire others. His preface urged young men to carry the Life of Nelson ‘till he has treasured up the example in his memory and in his heart’.51 ‘Ennobled beyond all addition of nobility’, as Southey would have it, Nelson’s status as the pre-eminent national hero had been conﬁrmed in the apotheosis of Trafalgar: The death of Nelson was felt in England as something more than a public calamity: men started at the intelligence, and turned pale; as if they had heard of the loss of a dear friend. An object of our admiration and affection, of our pride and our hopes, was suddenly taken from us; and it seemed as if we had never, till then, known how deeply we had loved and reverenced him. What the country had lost in its great hero – the greatest of our own and of all former times – was scarcely taken into the account of grief.52\n\nDuring the remaining years of the war this evocation of Nelson as popular hero was designed to bolster the nation in crisis, and to varying degrees throughout the rest of the century this language of patriotism found renewed articulation as a more self-conscious English nationalism, a self-imagining chivalric ideal. Generations of 47\n\nIMAGINING THE ARCTIC\n\npoets, artists, and authors took up this beating drum, and through an admiration of Nelson, and the array of idealised qualities that he had come to embody, Englishmen could identify with the national spirit: ‘England has had many heroes but never one who so entirely possessed of the love of his fellow-countrymen as Nelson. All men knew that . . . with perfect and entire devotion, he served his country with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his strength; and, therefore, they loved him as truly and as fervently as he loved England’.53 It was Southey, above all others, who was responsible for shaping this idea of the chivalry of the sea, a myth of a somehow-ingrained ‘national spirit’. His patriotic ideal, constructed around national heroes, history, and institutions, would provide the aesthetic context for much of the century, and beyond. By 1900 there had been more than one hundred editions, the most successful naval biography ever written. In Chapter 2 I examine the making of Southey’s biography in greater depth, which justiﬁes too why I’ve devoted so much space here to Nelson. Whether one may love, or loathe, his dominance in naval histories, one cannot ignore the fact that he was the century’s most enduring hero. He provided the example by which all others were judged. In the dangers and daring that characterised his career, and in the lengthy eulogies of his biographers, his memory would provide the heroic image that a great number of naval ofﬁcers – not to mention generations of ardent boys, a queue of jobbing authors, and a succession of populist politicians – were keen to follow and imagine for themselves.\n\nMUSCULAR CHRISTIANITY\n\nFrom Southey, the task of stirring the nation’s imaginations passed to others, and among the makers of Victorian culture none saw history in grander terms than Thomas Carlyle. Carlyle’s history had purpose, it was ‘poetry, prophecy, biography and social criticism – all in one’, and he played an important part in adapting the concept of chivalry to Victorian life.54 A gloomy, puritanical, self-opinionated mason’s son from the Scottish lowlands – at ﬁrst sight not the stuff of a narrative of 48\n\nON NAVAL HEROES\n\nchivalry and romance – Carlyle became one of the most signiﬁcant messengers of this new ideal. His heroes, in fact, were a product of his profound disappointment with the Britain in which he lived. He made his reputation with Sartor Resartus, ﬁrst published in instalments in 1831, but it was his Past and Present of 1843 that grabbed the attention of his contemporaries. In an extraordinary mixture of growls, indignation, slapstick and sarcasm he took aim at the times, mercilessly attacking the aristocrats, millowners, landlords, politicians and clergymen, the advertisements, the fashions, the smoke-belching industries, and the endless shop-rows and work-houses of an England heading for destruction; a nation full of ‘Puffery, Falsity, Mammon-worship’ and ‘Phantasms riding with huge clatter along the streets’.55 This was a radical portrayal of a nation in decline, far removed from Lancaster’s ‘Eden’, yet it echoed the disdain for the state of his country that had given form to Southey’s heroic ideal, twenty years before. Carlyle was radical in so far was he felt that society was in need of radical reform, and his ideal was a governing hero, or heroes, or at least a governing class near enough to heroism, to rise above self-interest and dedicate itself to governing justly. He saw the ethic of such a governing class in terms of chivalry, and it was incumbent on them to provide examples that could lead the nation. Carlyle admired two qualities above all; toughness and idealism, which combined to typify a muscular Christianity that he saw lacking in the ruling classes, which shirked their duty, and neglected by the new wealthy middle-classes – manufacturers and merchants – who were worried more about the health of proﬁts than the state of their workforce. Strong in body, of heart, and of soul, dispensing mercy and justice with one hand, whilst ready for vital action when it was necessary with the other, Carlyle’s deﬁnition of the heroic in"
