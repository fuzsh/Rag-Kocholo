As such, it has become a by-word for the assumption of various, often contradictory habits of thought, belief, behaviour and perceptions. Victorian studies and studies in nineteenth-century literature and culture have, from their institutional inception, questioned narrowness of presumption, pushed at the limits of the nominal definition, and have sought to question the very grounds on which the unreflective perception of the so-called Victorian has been built; and so they continue to do. Victorian and nineteenth-century studies of literature and culture maintain a breadth and diversity of interest, of focus and inquiry, in an interrogative and intellectually openminded and challenging manner, which are equal to the exploration and inquisitiveness of its subjects. Many of the questions asked by scholars and researchers of the innumerable productions of nineteenth-century society actively put into suspension the clichés and stereotypes of ‘Victorianism’, whether the approach has been sustained by historical, scientific, philosophical, empirical, ideological or theoretical concerns; indeed, it would be incorrect to assume that each of these approaches to the idea of the Victorian has been, or has remained, in the main exclusive, sealed off from the interests and engagements of other approaches. A vital interdisciplinarity has been pursued and embraced, for the most part, even as there has been contest and debate amongst Victorianists, pursued with as much fervour as the affirmative exploration between different disciplines and differing epistemologies put to work in the service of reading the nineteenth century. Edinburgh Critical Studies in Victorian Culture aims to take up both the debates and the inventive approaches and departures from\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd ix\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nx\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nconvention that studies in the nineteenth century have witnessed for the last half century at least. Aiming to maintain a ‘Victorian’ (in the most positive sense of that motif) spirit of inquiry, the series’ purpose is to continue and augment the cross-fertilization of interdisciplinary approaches, and to offer, in addition, a number of timely and untimely revisions of Victorian literature, culture, history and identity. At the same time, the series will ask questions concerning what has been missed or improperly received, misread, or not read at all, in order to present a multi-faceted and heterogeneous kaleidoscope of representations. Drawing on the most provocative, thoughtful and original research, the series will seek to prod at the notion of the ‘Victorian’, and in so doing, principally through theoretically and epistemologically sophisticated close readings of the historicity of literature and culture in the nineteenth century, to offer the reader provocative insights into a world that is at once overly familiar, and irreducibly different, other and strange. Working from original sources, primary documents and recent interdisciplinary theoretical models, Edinburgh Critical Studies in Victorian Culture seeks not simply to push at the boundaries of research in the nineteenth century, but also to inaugurate the persistent erasure and provisional, strategic redrawing of those borders. Julian Wolfreys\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd x\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI have incurred a number of debts in the writing of this study and would like to record my thanks to the following people and organisations. Julian Wolfreys, the editor of this series, encouraged my original idea and provided much appreciated support throughout. At Edinburgh University Press, Jackie Jones showed why academics hold her in such esteem – I am particularly grateful for her patience concerning word counts and picture rights. Loughborough University’s Research Leave Scheme provided a semester of vital teaching relief, without which the book would not have been finished. The Department of English and Drama at Loughborough made a much appreciated contribution to image reproduction expenses; Phil Wilson and Jagjit Samra of the university’s Design and Print Services worked wonders with my mouldy old magazines. The university’s library staff provided invaluable support in tracking down errant volumes. Outside the East Midlands, I would like to thank Stephen Homer and Frances Pond, the archivists at Birmingham City University, for their help in guiding me through John Lane’s papers. Julia Carver, Collections Officer of Bristol City Museums and Art Gallery, was far more helpful and courteous than the barristers in W.F. Yeames’ Defendant and Counsel. Further gratitude is due to librarians at the British Library, Birmingham University, Bristol City Reference Library, Bristol University, Bath Spa University, the Brotherton Library Leeds University, and the University of the West of England. For permission to quote from the Lane papers, I would like to thank the Harry Ransom Center, Texas.

In May 1992, Miroslav Holub told the TLS that an author is only an author when actually creating ‘his small artistic performance’. The rest of the time, he added, ‘he only pretends to be an artist, or displays certain associated artistic characteristics such as restlessness, hypochondria, sloppy dress, unbridled temperament, clumsiness and sentimentality.’ I have been guilty of all of these and more, and so am especially grateful to the friends, colleagues, family and students who put up with me during the project. They include: Alan Bairner, Anne-Marie Beller, Abi Bendall, Carol Bolton, Borka (the Featherless Goose), Bob Brocklehurst, Roger Clarke, Lucy Dawkins, Gowan Dawson, Jan Elliot, Kerry Featherstone, Duncan Ferguson, Caroline Flynn-Ryan, Anne and Norman Freeman, Holly Furneaux, Lisa Gledhill, Bill Greenslade, Michelle Greet, Elaine Hall, Tom Hibbert, Elaine Hobby, William Hughes, Rachel Jackson, Neil Jagger, Stephen James, Brian Jarvis, Sally Ledger, Catherine Maxwell, Lina Minou, Deborah Murden, Peter Rawlings, Catherine Rees, Kelly Reid, Helen Relf, Carrie Rhys-Davies, Ruth Robbins, Ruth Salt, Carolyn Scott-Jeffs, Kerri Sharp, Marion Shaw, Gillian Spraggs, Victoria Stewart, John Stokes, Lizzie White, Janet Walwyn, Dan Watt, Nigel Wood, and Helen Wright.

Rudyard Kipling to Charles Eliot Norton, [8] February 1895 (Kipling 1990: 173–4) I can never forget 1895. To lie awake night after night, staring wide awake, hopeless of sleep, tormented in nerves, like a disembodied spirit, to watch one’s own corpse, as it were, day after day, is an experience which no sane man with a conscience would wish to repeat. Lord Rosebery, 30 September 1903 (McKinstry 2005: 347)\n\nöõ In Lewis Carroll’s Sylvie and Bruno, Concluded (1893), the mysterious ‘Mein Herr’ tells how, in his country, maps are no longer drawn to scale: each mile on a map is a mile long. Jorge Luis Borges’s parable, ‘On Exactitude in Science’ (1960) relates a similar story, explaining how the Cartographers Guilds of an ancient civilisation surveyed their empire in such detail that the map they produced was the same size as the terrain it covered. The fate of these hapless geographers is a salutary one, and I was mindful of it throughout my work on this book. During the 1890s, the British Isles had around thirty million inhabitants, each of whom lived through a different version of their period. This is not to say that there were no moments of shared experience – the ferocious winter of 1894–5, for example – but a Dundee sailor hunting whales off Greenland, a Cardiff alderman mired in committee meetings, the female proprietor of a Norfolk lodging house, and an Irish Nationalist newspaper editor covering the General Election and its aftermath lived through significantly different 1895s. All are equally worthy of record, and in what follows I am not suggesting that the famous (and infamous) are any more deserving of examination than their fellow citizens. However, with so many stories to be told, and so many voices to be heard, a\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 1\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n2\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nchronicler has to make editorial as well as intellectual decisions about the most convincing ways to engage with historical realities. Henry James memorably observed that ‘The historian, essentially, wants more documents than he can really use; the dramatist only wants more liberties than he can really take’ (H. James 1934: 161–2), but while this is a neat polarisation, it ignores the historian who desires liberties just as much as she or he needs source data. There are as many histories as there are historians, and the relationship between them is symbiotic. While this book’s core is the front page news of the day, its margins reflect my particular interests in literature and culture, from the theatre reviews of George Bernard Shaw to the advertising column of the Illustrated Police News and the football reports of the Birmingham Daily Post. I have not taken liberties with verifiable detail, but each scholar who reviews the year will construct a different version of it, adding to the list of ‘lived’ 1895s an infinite plurality of reinterpretations. This book is therefore a subjective composite of a year that took millions of subtly distinct forms even as clocks and calendars divided it into the shared units of hours, weeks and months. In some ways, it is a Venn diagram, with vast numbers of individual sets (or lives) intersecting at moments of national significance; in others it is more akin to the notion of the multiverse advanced by William James in The Will to Believe (1895). Seventy years later, Michel Foucault coined the term ‘heterotopia’ to describe the simultaneous juxtaposition of apparently incompatible events in the same space. Juxtaposition is a crucial structural, dramatic and analytical principle in what follows, not least because it also reflects the miscellaneous content of a late-Victorian newspaper, with its important lead story and editorial rubbing up against the ‘Gleanings’ column and the racing results. I am far from the first scholar to trace Wilde’s trajectory from theatrical success to solitary confinement, Lord Rosebery’s calamitous final year as Prime Minister, or the critical reception of Jude the Obscure, but when revisiting these events, I hope to show how they overlap other, less familiar happenings and circumstances and thus reveal something of the year’s multifarious unfoldings. The details of sport and meteorology are therefore no less important than those of literature and politics. The result oscillates between the public record and more private sources such as letters and diaries, as well as identifying those moments when the private was made public in court and in the media. I have tried to let the people of 1895 speak for themselves as much as possible, without overlaying them with material from more recent critical or historical works. This is, after all, a study of a year rather than a detailed consideration of The Importance of Being Earnest or the intricacies of life in 10 Downing Street.\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 2\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nInto the Past: A Brief Foreword\n\n3\n\nA single frame of film can be memorable or revealing, but it remains only a part of something larger. By the same token, it would be disingenuous to claim that the events of 1895 always speak for the fin de siècle as a whole. What this book tries to show instead is how certain events were unique while others belong to currents that flow through the era. Certain aspects of British life were unchanged from much earlier in the century, but elsewhere, daily existence was altering at an increasingly rapid pace, with new technology unsettling those who favoured the horse over the bicycle, the fountain pen over the typewriter or the needle over the sewing machine. Debates about the sexual content of fiction, or the question of whether children are corrupted by what they read (or see), are clearly not confined to the late-Victorian period, but they are significant aspects of 1895. Similarly, the complex interconnection of ‘high’ and more popular art, or the discussions of the likely consequences of professionalising sport are characteristic of both the 1890s and a more general ‘modernity’. Detaching a year from those around it does permit concentration on its detail, but it rarely allows narrative or argumentative closure. It is all too easy to examine the past with a teleological conclusion in mind, a tendency that mars a number of otherwise valuable studies of Wilde. Even a subtle and politicised sexual campaigner such as George Ives did not, in 1895 at least, see Wilde’s conviction as significant in the formation of later conceptions of homosexual identity: he wished to kill himself in despair. Moments of change are rarely recognised as such immediately and their significance may only become clear much later. We may now read Wilde’s downfall as a collision between the dissident modern and the brutally reactionary, and as a contribution to a wider debate about the policing (in all senses) of private life. However, we should not co-opt Virginia Woolf’s rash claims about December 1910 and argue that ‘on or about May 1895, understandings of human sexuality changed’. Wilde’s trials, and the media furore that surrounded them, are extraordinarily revealing, but quite what they reveal varies according to the perspective from which they are viewed. The ways in which the newspapers of the day discussed Wilde and ‘vice’ are a case in point, for here Wilde’s conviction quickly became part of a much broader discussion about the ways in which criminal(ised) sexualities were formed by the very culture that condemned them. The letters pages of Reynolds’s Newspaper ally ‘immorality’ with the ‘unnatural’ conditions of public schools, suggesting that class and education are more significant in nurturing same-sex desire than any inbuilt tendency: the working class homosexual, rather than the male prostitute whose behaviour is motivated by material need (or greed), is almost a contradiction\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 3\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n4\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nin terms. The Daily Telegraph meanwhile wields the blunt instrument of popular prejudice in caricaturing Wilde as a cancerous social menace. In its reading of the case, it is not the public school but radical literature and art, and the unapologetic intellectual iconoclasm that accompanies them which endanger the public at large, a public who could hardly be at risk when the Yellow Book was selling only 5,000 copies an issue. An Irishman informed by contemporary French thought and the pagan teachings of the classics, Wilde represented a rootless contagion instead of a set of acceptable and fixed attitudes. For the Telegraph, his ‘deviant’ sexuality clothed ‘deviant’ thought and taste, but papers across the social and educational spectrum, from the Telegraph to the Illustrated Police News thought Wilde needed cutting down to size long before any hint of his sexual transgressions became public knowledge. Few analysts of the 1890s have considered the ways in which an ever-growing reading public treated newspaper accounts of his trials as lurid entertainment that titillated and evoked mild schadenfreude before being relegated to use as kindling and lavatory paper. Inconvenient as it may be for those who would see Wilde’s fate as a decisive moment in sexual taxonomy, millions of Britons cared little about him or his nocturnal adventures. Few outside London had seen his plays, none of his books had come close to rivalling the sales of Rider Haggard, Marie Corelli or Hall Caine, and though one of his plays could fill the Theatre Royal, such popularity was dwarfed by Everton Football Club’s ability to sell 16,000 tickets a week to people who would stand for a couple of hours in rain, sleet and snow for unpredictable and on occasion minimal reward. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. We can now see that the Labour party was going to displace the Liberals as the primary opposition to the Conservatives in the twentieth century, even if Punch was sure Keir Hardie was a spent force after the 1895 Election. It is clear that pensions are a more humane and socially productive measure of alleviating poverty among the elderly than the workhouse ever was; that agitation for Irish independence or reform of the House of Lords did not end with Rosebery’s electoral defeat; that cycling was not a mere fad; that Arnold Bennett and Joseph Conrad were going to become major figures in early twentieth-century literature whatever their initial struggles. Punch may have felt that the New Woman was a thing of the past by the end of 1895, but that was because her ‘newness’ was becoming ever more socially assimilated; the term ‘New Woman’, coined by Sarah Grand in March 1894, post-dated the realities of socio-political change. Although it became a useful means of self-identification as well as pejorative dismissal, its use and life-span were limited. Talk of the ‘New Woman’ soon began to give way to that of suffrage agitation, while other campaigners\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 4\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nInto the Past: A Brief Foreword\n\n5\n\nfor women’s rights (or sexual equality in general) started to be described as ‘feminist’, a term the OED records as first appearing in the Daily News of 12 October 1894. Another French import, ‘feminism’, quickly joined it in the lexicon of ‘advanced’ opinion, cropping up in the Athenaeum of 27 April 1895. That young women can still provoke debate about the ‘decency’ of their dress, or that a woman writer can turn heads with a sexually explicit novel, demonstrates continuity with our late-Victorian forebears, but only the most optimistic, pessimistic or visionary predicted the endurance of such things a century ago. In 1895, few Britons imagined that ‘skirmishes’ on the North-West frontier would ever be anything but a distraction for the Great Powers, though the military and economic rise of Japan was being studied in Whitehall and elsewhere. I have tried to resist the seductions of hindsight, but I have not always managed to stop my ears to the equally beguiling sirens of retrospective irony. Parallels between ages and historical figures can be analogous to the ‘false friends’ that traditionally bedevil the lives of language students. For instance, Laura Ormiston Chant’s attempts to ‘clean up’ music hall entertainment are in some ways suggestive of the efforts of Mary Whitehouse to do the same to theatre, film and television during the 1960s and 1970s, but despite superficial similarities, Chant emerged from more specifically Victorian concerns with ‘purity’ and moral vigilance, belonged to a much more widespread and significant reforming constituency, and also performed a great deal of valuable work in the causes of sexual equality and humanitarianism. Nevertheless, readers of this book will notice that a great deal of 1895 is familiar to them today. Consciously or otherwise, the historian often reshapes the past in the light of the present’s preoccupations, but even allowing for this, it is notable that the 1895 budget struck some now very familiar chords concerning public spending and taxation. The role of the House of Lords continues to be debated. Politicians and reformers tussle with the brewing industry over the regulation and pricing of alcohol. Britain is little better at coping with snow or drought or outbreaks of disease than it was a century ago. People still queue to view London from a giant Ferris wheel; literary critics struggle to explain the overwhelming popular success of certain novels, whether they are by George Du Maurier or Dan Brown. In the twenty-first century, the government of London remains a controversial topic. Debates about juvenile crime and social inequality are as agonised as ever. An increasingly intrusive and hypocritically moralistic tabloid press delights in dramatising (rather than simply reporting) high profile cases of sexual scandal. In an undeclared war in Afghanistan, mounting British losses in no\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 5\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n6\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nway presage ultimate victory. Conservative commentators worry that women are becoming less ‘lady-like’ and all-too-willing to claim the ‘traditionally’ masculine right of promiscuity without reputational taint. Popular entertainment (chiefly singing), and professional sport (chiefly football and boxing) remain recurrent foci of working class aspiration and achievement. Pornography is still advertised in newspapers which excoriate its appearances elsewhere. Writing this book from 2009 to 2011, I saw football results that were eerily similar to those found in the sports pages of the 1890s. The First Division was now the Premier League, but the same teams played each other: Aston Villa, Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle, Sunderland, West Bromich Albion, Wolves and others pursued their ancient rivalries, even if my preferred team failed to recapture the successes of yore. In 1894–5, an English cricket team captained by the Middlesex batsman Andrew Stoddart defeated the Australians 3–2 in a five match series; in 2010–11, an English team led by the Middlesex batsman Andrew Strauss led England to a 3–1 win. While the relation between ‘Gentlemen’ and ‘Players’ has changed, and the composition of the modern team represents shifts in the post-imperial landscape, the sporting struggle remains equally keen, though after Gallipoli and Bodyline, the Australian crowds no longer cheer the victorious English from the field. In 1895, men rushed to telegraph offices for updates on the match scores. Today, fans consult websites, but the principle remains. Pondering his failure to produce an encyclopaedic account of city life in London: A Pilgrimage (1872) Douglas Jerrold quoted Emerson’s ‘we touch and go, and sip the foam of many lives.’ ‘Ours is a touch and go chronicle,’ he said (Doré 1872: 16). The phrase now has unwelcome associations of the unconvincing and tenuous, but the notion of the ‘touch and go chronicle’ remains a useful one and certainly more empowering than the fate of Borges’s map-makers.\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 6\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\nThunder in November indicates a fertile year to come.

The high temperatures prompted thunderstorms, with the south-west seeing its heaviest rain since 1882. On 14\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 7\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n8\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nNovember, George Gissing noted the ‘Newspapers are full of floods and wrecks’ (Gissing 1978: 353), and a deluge in the Thames Valley meant ‘Eton was flooded out, and the school had to be broken up’ (Hamilton 1986: 190). Oscar Wilde received an intimation of changes in the moral climate a few days earlier. The first night of Haddon Chambers’s John O’Dreams, starring Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Mrs Patrick Campbell (Beatrice Stella Tanner), attracted an ‘exceedingly brilliant audience’ of ‘well known “first-nighters”’ (Leeds Mercury 9/11/94), but ‘the lower orders who thronged the stalls’ (WCL 622) were less starstruck than they might have been, and Wilde was coldly received. He retired to a box with the Home Secretary, Herbert Asquith. The incident was minor in itself, but Wilde’s relationship with senior government figures would soon become controversial. While Asquith did his best to enjoy a play Wilde felt was ‘not bad, but oh! so badly written,’ Lord Rosebery’s Liberal government tottered from crisis to crisis. Gladstone had won the 1892 election with a majority of only forty, one that left little room for manoeuvre and was dependent on support from Irish Nationalists. Taking office for the fourth time, Gladstone was, at the age of eighty-two, the oldest PM in electoral history and his increasingly poor health led to his resignation in the spring of 1894. The ‘Grand Old Man’ had been the undisputed Liberal leader since the late 1860s, but Rosebery was a vexed successor. The office of Premier was but one of many he initially declined during a frustrating career ‘rooted in a genuine fear of inadequacy and of failure’ (J. Davis ODNB). Exemplifying William James’s belief that ‘there is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision’ (W. James 1890: 122), the vacillating Rosebery was politically and personally besieged, and was, said the Times, ‘a reed painted to look like iron’ (29/10/94). The Liberals had become notably factionalised since Gladstone embraced Home Rule in 1880, and the internecine warfare accompanying this and a movement towards social radicalism intensified after he retired. The new PM was twenty years younger than his Chancellor, Sir William Harcourt, and the latter, reinforced by his venomous son, Lewis (known as ‘Loulou’), felt he was far more suited to high office than a peer who had never been a constituency MP, a charge Rosebery countered by pointing out Harcourt’s inexperience of international diplomacy. The two fought over the 1894 Budget, which alarmed Rosebery by introducing death duties and an increase in income tax that hit the party’s wealthy supporters, but even when they lacked an obvious bone of contention, their incompatible personalities made it difficult for them to work together for the common good. Rosebery showed political\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 8\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n9\n\nintelligence and diplomatic skill as Foreign Secretary and the Chairman of the newly formed LCC, but he lacked Harcourt’s parliamentary ringcraft and his aristocratic politesse could be overwhelmed by the older man’s ‘blustering manner and hectoring insensitivity’ (McKinstry 2005: 213). Rosebery’s personal charm won him widespread (and cross-party) popularity, but Harcourt had a firmer grasp of everyday affairs and procedure, and considered Rosebery’s persistent attempts to reform the House of Lords an electoral irrelevance. Even his friends struggled to grasp his schemes for constitutional change, and his cause was weakened further by strong opposition from the Queen, who could not understand why an aristocrat should seek to undermine the traditional order. The Times found his radicalism repugnant too. ‘It is a reproduction of the evil traditions of Jacobinism [. . .] a fanatical folly,’ it said of the mooted Lords abolition (29/10/94). John Morley, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, was a further complication. Rosebery, Harcourt and Morley should have been a formidable triumvirate, but their differences of policy and focus were emblematic of the fission within Liberal ranks: the parodist Owen Seaman called them ‘Allies in Blunderland’ (Seaman 1895: 28). Cabinet meetings were fiery and frosty affairs, not helped by further divisions between Asquith, Joseph Chamberlain, Edward Grey and R.B. Haldane. Rosebery was not a militant imperialist or ‘Jingoist’ like Chamberlain, but he was more enthusiastic about Empire than Harcourt or Morley. Rosebery and Morley supported Home Rule; Harcourt opposed it. The best part of fifty Liberal Unionists, notably Chamberlain, added to the confusion. Harcourt balanced increases in income tax with a corresponding rise in tax allowances, which appealed to the party’s bourgeois supporters as well as those at the upper end of the working class who might otherwise flirt with socialism, but Rosebery disliked his targeting of the aristocracy. Indeed, death duties proved a serious matter for his own heirs when he died in 1929.1 Rosebery’s enthusiasm for the turf upset Nonconformists, a major constituency of the Liberals’ support. Harcourt antagonised brewing (and Irish) interests by raising duty on beer and spirits, and by suggesting local controls on the sale and distribution of liquor. Morley sided with Rosebery on the issue of ‘ending or mending’ the Lords, but disagreed with Harcourt over women’s suffrage, which Morley favoured, and over the introduction of an eight hour working day, which Harcourt saw as against the national interest. Morley had been a journalist and newspaper editor, and his experience of the world beyond Parliament gave him useful electoral insights, but ‘his fondness for intrigue sometimes got the better of him’ (Hamer ODNB). Regarding Harcourt as an opportunist, Morley supported Rosebery’s claim for the\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 9\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n10\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nLiberal leadership. That Harcourt blamed Rosebery for popularising his unflattering nickname, ‘Jumbo’, based on his apparent resemblance to a celebrated circus elephant, made relations between them increasingly fraught. In late January 1895, the PMG wryly observed of a brief Cabinet concord, ‘this unanimity is touching, especially because it is so rare nowadays’ (31/1/95). The formation of the National Old Age Pensions League in November 1894, an occasion on which the sociologist, Charles Booth, suggested that 9 per cent of Londoners died in the workhouse, helped intensify a division between the left and right wings of the party, with Chamberlain criticising government policy on 6 December at a pensions conference in Birmingham, a city where 39 per cent of the elderly were paupers (IPN 3/11/94). Rosebery’s leadership problems were well nigh insurmountable, particularly for a man of his temperament. In October, the Spectator suggested Rosebery was ‘a bundle of seven aliases’ rather than a creature of flesh and blood: the Home Ruler, the Unionist, the Democratic Socialist, the Political Boss, the Man above Party, the Sphinx and the Man of the Turf (McKinstry 2005: 4). Riven by self-contradictions, Rosebery’s oratorical flair, his greatest political asset, began to evaporate. On 30 October, he unveiled a statue of Edmund Burke in Bristol and received the freedom of the city, but his flippant address upset local worthies. The following month, the SR noted his speeches’ ‘remarkable poverty of ideas’ and condemned his ‘vulgar love of jocularity and colloquial style [. . .] even when dealing with the most serious affairs of State.’ His behaviour, it went on, ‘scarcely approximates to the ideal of a First Minister of the British Empire’ (17/11/94: 523), a view Punch supported in ‘The Perils of a Jesting Premier’ (22/12/94: 298). Such comments drew attention to Rosebery’s masculinity, his aristocratic high-handedness, humour’s place in parliamentary discourse, and the relationship between public and private selves. The no-nonsense editorial was astute. Rosebery’s ‘place in the Cabinet is anything but a bed of roses,’ it continued, ‘and his position in the country is still worse.’ He was ‘riding for a fall’, and the Liberals had little chance of avoiding electoral disaster. Rosebery’s personal life was equally troubled. The death of his wife, the heiress Hannah de Rothschild, in November 1890 left him inconsolable. His hair began greying; he lost much of his conversational sparkle and from then on, wrote only on black-bordered notepaper. Harcourt’s one-upmanship was an occupational hazard, but since Hannah’s death Rosebery had made a still more dangerous foe, a man with a limitless capacity for personal grievance. If Rosebery was, in the words of the Foreign Office’s Esme Howard, a ‘highly polished eighteenth-century\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 10\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n11\n\nsnuff-box [. . .] filled with perfumed snuff, which would be opened on special occasions’ (McKinstry 2005: 188), his antagonist was a rabid bulldog whose jaws frothed and slavered as they clamped upon their victim. John Sholto Douglas, the eighth Marquess of Queensberry, was a menace. ‘Impetuous, reckless, combative and temperamental,’ mountaineer, pugilist, equestrian, gambler, philanderer and eccentric secularist, he had four sons, and was more or less estranged from all of them (Roberts 1981: 25). ‘His principal preoccupations were sport and atheism,’ says Montgomery Hyde, ‘and he knew much more about his horses and dogs than about the human members of his family’ (Hyde 1948: 21). His volcanic temper led Wilde to nickname him ‘the Scarlet Marquis’ (WCL 632).\n\nPunching the Pimp In 1894, Queensberry briefly allowed familial concerns to override sporting ones, though in many respects, he simply swapped foxes for lions. He was especially concerned about his eldest and youngest children, Francis, Viscount Drumlanrig and Lord Alfred, known to all but his father as Bosie, a variant on ‘Boysie’, his mother’s childhood pet name for him. Rosebery made Drumlanrig his assistant private secretary when he left the LCC for the Foreign Office in 1892, despite his lack of experience, and deemed him successful enough in his new role to persuade Gladstone to promote him to one of the Queen’s Lords-in-Waiting. This in turn led him to be made an English peer, an honour denied to Queensberry who had been a Scottish elective peer but who had not been re-elected to the Lords in 1880, ostensibly because of his secularist sympathies. Drumlanrig became Lord Kelhead in June 1893. Initially acquiescent, Queensberry soon objected to the honour, complaining to Victoria about Rosebery’s ‘bad influence’ on his son and writing repeatedly to Gladstone criticising the appointment. Rosebery ignored this provocation, even when an abusive letter was read out at a Cabinet meeting, but he had a frightening experience in August 1893 when, having gone to Homburg at his doctor’s suggestion, he was followed by Queensberry, armed with a dog-whip. Rosebery received threatening mail before leaving for Germany, but Queensberry’s anti-Semitic and homophobic aggression reached new depths in his message of 6 August. ‘Cher fat boy,’ it began: Oh fat boy, keep yourself fit. Use a skipping rope mightily, man of valour. You will find it good for your fat carcass. I have a punching ball here on\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 11\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n12\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nwhich I am having inscribed in black letters, ‘The Jew Pimp’. I shall daily punch it to keep my hand in until we meet once more. (McKinstry 2005: 359)\n\nRosebery joked about the Marquess in a letter to the Queen, observing that one of his more onerous duties as Foreign Secretary was ‘to be pursued by a pugilist of unsound mind’ (R. James 1995: 287), but the German authorities took Queensberry’s threats very seriously, and forced him to leave the country. Queensberry denounced Rosebery in the foreign press where he was beyond the reach of British libel laws, but his fury was chiefly reserved for Wilde, whom he saw as leading Bosie ever deeper into the moral mire. Like Rosebery, Wilde underestimated the Marquess, but by the winter of 1894 he had realised that while Queensberry had given his name to the rules of boxing, he disdained all forms of etiquette and social regulation. Earlier that year, Bosie had been in Florence, being ‘taken up by a coterie of expatriate homosexuals’ and, as the art historian Bernard Berenson recalled in 1949, becoming ‘dissipated, batty, a fucked out whore’ (Cadden and Jensen 1995: 64). During his absence, Wilde faced an intimidating visit from the Marquess, who burst into his house in Tite Street, Chelsea, and threatened to thrash him and Bosie if he caught them together in public. ‘I don’t know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot at sight,’ Wilde purportedly replied, characterising his uninvited guest as ‘the most infamous brute in London’ (Roberts 1981: 197). Queensberry hoped to provoke Wilde into suing him for libel, and almost managed to do so, since Wilde’s solicitors wrote to him on 11 July demanding he retract his allegations. Queensberry refused, but his plan to lure Wilde into the courtroom was stymied by Sybil Montgomery, Bosie’s mother, who helped by her cousin, the Conservative MP George Wyndham, talked Wilde out of legal action. The situation remained tense, not least because Queensberry was convinced Wilde was a ‘damned cur and coward of the Rosebery type’ who was causing a ‘hideous scandal’ (Roberts 1981: 199). Queensberry changed tack in October. Drumlanrig was to marry Alix Ellis, the daughter of one of the Prince of Wales’s equerries, and the couple, her parents and brother, went to Somerset to stay with the Conservative MP for Bridgewater, Edward Stanley. During a shooting party on 18 October, Drumlanrig was found dead in a bramble patch with a gunshot wound to the forehead. What Brian Roberts terms a ‘perfunctory inquest’ (1981: 183) – the Times gave it less than a column on 22 October – delivered a verdict of Accidental Death, positing he was killed while unwisely clambering over a hedge with a loaded gun in\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 12\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n13\n\nsearch of a winged pheasant. The swift if not wholly convincing verdict limited but did not quash the rumours circulating in the wake of the tragedy that Drumlanrig had shot himself because he feared the exposure of a relationship with Rosebery, or because he was torn between the PM and Alix. Queensberry lashed out in a letter to Alfred Montgomery, his former father-in-law. ‘Now the first flush of this catastrophe and grief is passed,’ he wrote on 1 November, ‘I write to tell you that this is a judgement on the whole lot of you. Montgomerys, The Snob Queers like Rosebery [. . .] I smell a Tragedy behind all this and have already got Wind of a more startling one’ (Ellmann 1987: 402). Queensberry had begun to fear that a monstrous conspiracy was destroying his clan, and he redoubled his attacks on Rosebery and his attempts to reclaim Bosie. In Ellmann’s words, ‘he had begun to see homosexuals everywhere’ (381). Rosebery’s sexuality was a topic of scurrilous interest for society gossips. However, it might be observed that while homosexuality had yet to be articulated in the bourgeois consciousness, and late-Victorian perceptions of it had not crystallised into the fatally neat syllogism, ‘he is not “manly” therefore he may be an “invert”’, Rosebery’s departure from conventionally understood signifiers of aristocratic masculinity was significant enough to be commented on by friend and foe alike. He was clean-shaven, an accomplished linguist who read French literature for pleasure, a former pupil of the notorious Eton master William Johnson and a close friend of Johnson’s acolyte, ‘Regy’ Brett (M. Kaplan 2005: 113–65). He shrouded himself with an ‘air of mystery and reserve’ that ‘provok[ed] others to think he was permanently engaged in dubious activities’ (McKinstry 2005: 152), and insisted on opening his own mail despite the many calls upon his time. A preening wit, a widower whose pose of perpetual mourning – sanctioned by regal example – served as an impenetrable disguise, it was muttered, for all manner of deviant activities, a misogynist: all of these encouraged wagging tongues. Queensberry was hardly a rational judge of sexual questions, but he was not alone in harbouring suspicions concerning Rosebery’s appearance, behaviour and character.\n\nArtificial Flowers and Strange Perfumes Queensberry’s view of his son’s relationship with Wilde was not improved by the appearance of a satire, published anonymously on 15 September. Filled with ‘smartly written impertinences’ (GH 20/9/94) and ‘smartly-perverted aphorisms’ (MP 20/9/94), and taking its title\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 13\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n14\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nfrom the dyed flower Wilde wore in his buttonhole to demonstrate the superiority of art over nature, The Green Carnation depicted the relationship between Lord Reggie Hastings, whose ‘pale gilt hair’, blue eyes and ‘mouth like the mouth of Narcissus’ (Hichens [1894] 1949: 2), made him an all-too-recognisable caricature of Bosie, and his mentor, Esmé Amarinth, turner of paradoxes, admirer of Walter Pater and smoker of gold-tipped cigarettes. ‘Let us sin while we may,’ he says, asking ‘Why, why do the young neglect their passionate pulsating opportunities?’ (106). In the conclusion to The Renaissance (1873) Pater maintained that the secret of life was devotion to ‘art and song’ and ‘getting as many pulsations as possible into the given time’ (Pater [1893] 1986: 153), but fearful that it ‘might possibly mislead some of those young men into whose hands it might fall,’ he withdrew the essay until 1888. On the evidence of The Green Carnation, his fears were well-founded. Dying on 30 July, Pater was spared further controversy, but Wilde encouraged it even as he sought to distance himself from the novel. ‘I invented that magnificent flower,’ he told the PMG, ‘But with the middle-class and mediocre book that usurps its strangely beautiful name I have, I need hardly say, nothing whatsoever to do. The Flower is a work of art. The book is not’ (WCL 617). Such correspondence only stimulated public interest in the novel, and encouraged speculation about its authorship (Kingston 2008: 138–47). By late October, the perpetrator of the skit was unmasked as Robert Hichens, a friend and travelling companion of Bosie, but not before such unlikely suspects as Alfred Austin, Marie Corelli and even the manufacturers of Bovril had been considered. Wilde himself initially suspected Ada Leverson, though he later told her that the book was ‘the false gospel’ of a ‘doubting disciple’ whose talent was ‘unrelieved by any flashes of physical beauty’ (WCL 615). The Green Carnation ‘pretended to be a parody, but was more like a documentary’ (Ellmann 1987: 400), its satire ‘tripped up by Hichens’s obvious fascination, even admiration, for his subject’ (Danson 1989: 49) as it shimmered between ridicule and homage. Wilde hovered over proceedings, alluded to but unseen. ‘I am dining out with Oscar Wilde,’ says Esmé, ‘and that is only to be done with prayer and fasting’ (Hichens [1894] 1949: 27). Comments such as ‘People teach in order to conceal their ignorance’ (167) or ‘To know how to be disobedient is to know how to live’ (168) surely owe much to Hichens’s encounters with Wilde and Bosie. The exceptionally close relationship between the book’s content and real life troubled reviewers, with the SR arguing: It goes without saying that allusions, thinly veiled, to various disgusting sins are freely scattered throughout the book [. . .]. There is no use in spreading\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 14\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n15\n\nunpleasantness by holding it up to reprobation; otherwise it might almost be thought that some of these remarks on living people exceed even the bounds of extreme bad taste, and render the book [. . .] open to an action for libel. (10/11/94: 517)\n\nHichens’s novel forges damaging associations between certain types of self-presentation, humour, attitude and sexuality, and sailed close to the wind when depicting Reggie and Esmé preaching their gospel of pleasure and sin to the village choirboys, and offering a green carnation to a nine-year-old child. Neil McKenna sums up the pair as ‘proselytising, politicised sodomites’, adding that if this was not ‘damaging and dangerous enough’, portraying Reggie as a ‘predatory pederast’ was an ‘appalling indictment’ of Bosie’s behaviour ([2003] 2004: 411). Fearing legal action, not least because the book reprinted as Reggie’s a telegram sent by Bosie to his father, William Heinemann had the manuscript of the novel read by Wilde’s solicitor, Sir George Lewis. Reviews were mixed, but the Bookman reported it was selling well across the country by mid-November, alongside Hall Caine’s The Manxman, Anthony Hope’s The Prisoner of Zenda, and Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Ebb Tide (11/94: 41). The most perceptive response came from Max Beerbohm in the ILN. Wit, dandy and caricaturist par excellence, Beerbohm was a friend of all concerned (Hall 2002: 34–40), and ideally placed to review the book as a literary critic and social insider: he had apparently ‘been through it carefully’ with Hichens (Cecil [1964] 1985: 108). Fifteen years younger than Wilde, Beerbohm was, like his friend and contemporary Aubrey Beardsley, his senior by all of three days, keen to break with earlier aestheticism. ‘Mr Wilde, had he not always been received with titters, would perhaps not have been tolerated here,’ he wrote, suggesting he ‘would have had to fly the country, like Byron and many another who has been ecstatic in life and thought.’ ‘The portrait drawn of him is certainly offensive,’ Beerbohm continued, depicting a man with Wilde’s walk and smile, ‘a man of genius, who lacks the formal capacity for production, whose mind has become as a garden of rank and tropical luxuriance.’ Wilde once claimed that ‘it is only the Philistine who seeks to estimate a personality by the vulgar test of production’ (WCW 1095). Now Beerbohm paraphrased his ‘Pen, Pencil and Poison’ (1889) in a shrewd assessment. ‘The caricature is capital,’ he wrote, before anticipating the refrain of Wilde’s last major work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), ‘And surely the highest kind of satire is that which is done with a loving hand. You cannot betray but with a kiss’. As far as Beerbohm was concerned, Hichens’s satire was ‘full of fun and humour’ despite its offensiveness (Beerbohm 1894: 406). It was therefore\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 15\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n16\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\ndestined for popular success, even if it ventured into unwholesome territory. Like the SR’s assessment of Rosebery’s speeches, the piece raises fascinating questions about the cultural and sexual currents of the time. Hichens elides endorsement and derision; the 800 word review praises Hichens and faintly praises Wilde while yet consigning ‘Flamboyant Oscar!’ to history. Beerbohm implies Wilde’s sexual unconventionality, and underscores his own modernity and detachment in passing judgement on the novel, its author, its subject, and its representation of decadence. The review fuses analysis with self-advertisement. To link Wilde to Byron was a provocative move, clearly not made on the basis of shared heterosexual promiscuity, the writing of regularly anthologised love poems or self-sacrifice in the cause of Greek independence. Beerbohm’s parallel slyly evoked the ‘bad’ Lord Byron, the reckless libertine around whose name gathered all manner of unsavoury rumours. That the details of Byron’s sexual life were not widely known and certainly not discussed by the average reader of the ILN made the allusion all the craftier. At the same time, the notion of ‘ecstasy’ recalled Pater’s dangerous counsel, ‘To burn always with this hard, gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life’ (Pater [1893] 1986: 152). And was the allusion to Byron prophetic, a coded warning that Wilde’s life of romantic and sexual transgression would lead to exile and an evil reputation? The Green Carnation traded on its topicality, Arthur Symons telling readers of the Athenaeum it was a book, like Iota’s A Yellow Aster ‘which glitter[s] in the buttonhole for an evening with painful conspicuousness, and [is] forgotten before [it is] thrown away’ (5/1/95: 10). Punch depicted ‘Lord Raggie Tattersall’ and his friend ‘Fustian Flitters’ as ‘The Decadent Guys’, subtitled ‘A Colour-Study in Green Carnations’. Earnestly discussing their preparations for Bonfire Night, the scruffy yet dandified duo, whose buttonholes are adorned with purple cabbages, reprise several key jokes and incidents. Alluding to Wilde’s habit of reheating his wittiest asides, Fustian quips ‘The true impromptu is invariably premeditated’ and observes, ‘Does not consistency solely consist in contradicting oneself?’ (10/11/94: 225). With parodies of parodies in circulation, it was difficult to tell whether Wilde or Amarinth was responsible for ‘A Few Maxims for the Instruction of the Over-Educated’, an unsigned collection of epigrams published in the SR on 17 November. ‘Our proverbs want re-writing,’ said Lord Henry in Dorian Gray, and his creator set about his mission with gusto. ‘Education is an admirable thing,’ the list began, ‘but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.’\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 16\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n17\n\nFigure 1. ‘Decadent Guys’ Lord Raggie Tattersall and Fustian Flitters ponder the dandyism of Guy Fawkes. Punch, 10 November 1894.\n\nAnother maxim advanced the claim ‘The criminal classes are so close to us that even the policeman can see them. They are so far away from us that only the poet can understand them’ (17/11/94: 533–4). By late 1894, Wilde had almost abandoned poetry but his knowledge of crime increased by the day. He was well aware of the risks of ‘feasting with panthers’ (WCL 758), but they were reiterated in a news report of 24 November. Major William Parkinson, aged forty-five, committed suicide in Holloway Prison while on remand charged with ‘indecently assaulting and attempting to procure for illegal purposes two boys on Tower-hill.’ In a letter to his housemate, a retired major named Aylmer, Parkinson pleaded with him to come to Southwark police court bringing ‘a smart solicitor’. ‘I am accused of indecent behaviour to two boys,’ Parkinson wrote. ‘I need not say that it is a regular case of blackmail.’ Before the case came to trial, Parkinson slit his throat with a broken mirror in his cell, the Coroner recording a verdict of ‘suicide while\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 17\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n18\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\ntemporarily insane’ (IPN 24/11/94). Whether Parkinson assaulted the boys, or whether he was the victim of a blackmail plot – the criminalising of consenting homosexual acts, even in private, by Henry Labouchere’s Amendment to the Section 11 of the CLAA 1885 led to the act being termed the ‘blackmailer’s charter’ – his position was a desperate one, with the humiliation of a trial looming and a possibly severe sentence of two years hard labour and concomitant social ruin if found guilty. He was far from the only man in such an invidious position to resolve it through suicide. The SR was about to enter its golden age under the dynamic editorship of Frank Harris. It would boast drama criticism from George Bernard Shaw, literary criticism by H.G. Wells (who reviewed 285 books between November 1894 and April 1897), and an impressive roster of freelance contributors including Beerbohm, Symons and Ada Leverson. The appearance of Wilde’s ‘Maxims’ attracted little comment, but the same could not be said of a superior selection of them, ‘Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young’, originally intended for the SR but published instead in a new and extremely subversive Oxford University magazine, the Chameleon, on 1 December. The editor was John Francis Bloxam, a school friend of Bosie’s and an undergraduate at Exeter College whom Wilde said possessed a ‘strange beauty’ (WCL 625). Bloxam perhaps inspired the Bloxham of The Importance of Being Earnest, but in 1894 the would-be priest had literary ambitions of his own. Bloxam’s title was apparently suggested by Wilde’s eccentric friend, George Ives, criminologist, cricketer and campaigner for penal reform, in the autumn of 1894. It was inspired by an earlier Oxford magazine, the Spirit Lamp, edited by Bosie in 1892–3, which in May 1893 printed a French poetic paraphrase by Pierre Louÿs of a letter from Wilde to Bosie, Wilde’s vignette, ‘The Disciple’, and verse by Lionel Johnson. Lord Henry Somerset, an aristocratic writer of sentimental songs, contributed ‘T’amo’, a lyric whose subject was obvious to those who knew that his wife had left him in the late 1870s because of his homosexual inclinations. Lord Henry now lived in Florence, and Bosie may have met him when visiting the city in early 1894. The most outspoken contribution was, however, the editor’s ‘Sicilian Love Song’, which as Timothy d’Arch Smith remarks, could ‘hardly have failed to shock the vulgar and impress the initiate’ with its open declaration of same-sex passion (d’Arch Smith 53). The next issue, Bosie’s last, was far less ‘Uranian’ in content, perhaps, as d’Arch Smith suggests, the authorities had warned him about repeating May’s performance. The new magazine sported a green morocco cover (hinting, like the\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 18\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n19\n\ngreen carnation, at homosexual connotations), and the subtitle, A Bazaar of Dangerous and Smiling Chances, a quotation from Stevenson’s More New Arabian Nights: The Dynamiter (1885). Stevenson’s phrase refers to the London streets’ rich capacity for prompting adventure, but as McKenna comments, in this setting it suggests ‘the eye contact used by men in dangerous street pick-ups’ (2004: 432), the more so since the novel involves a character named Somerset and a secret society committing crimes in the capital. The Chameleon solicited those able to decipher its allusions; by the time it appeared, the name ‘Somerset’ had been further linked with homosexuality because of the role played in the so-called Cleveland Street Scandal of 1889–90 by Lord Arthur Somerset. By contrast, those expecting a typical undergraduate journal found it even more alarming than the Spirit Lamp had been. Wilde cancelled one of his more provocative maxims, ‘Manliness has become quite effeminate’, but his others were nonetheless unsettling. ‘The first duty in life is to be as artificial as possible,’ he began. ‘What the second duty is no one has yet discovered.’ Such a claim could have come from Dorian Gray: the surprising apothegm, ‘No crime is vulgar, but all vulgarity is crime. Vulgarity is the conduct of others,’ reused in An Ideal Husband, began life there, though it originally claimed ‘all crime is vulgar’ and that it belonged ‘exclusively to the lower orders’. ‘The well-bred contradict other people. The wise contradict themselves’ was an observation similar to those of Intentions (1891) or his early comedies, but elsewhere, Wilde’s assertions hinted at more personal revelations. ‘If one tells the truth, one is sure, sooner or later, to be found out’ followed the glorification of style over sincerity. ‘Any preoccupation with ideas of what is right and wrong in conduct shows an arrested intellectual development,’ he continued, moving from the defence of artistic freedom in Dorian Gray’s preface, ‘No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style’ (WCW 17), to an altogether amoral position. That this seemingly extended to encouraging prostitution (‘If the poor only had profiles there would be no difficulty in solving the problem of poverty’) and consequence-free hedonism (‘Pleasure is the only thing one should live for’), made his contribution a provocative read. Its subversive impact was enhanced by other contributions, ‘Judicial Wit of Recent Times’, Bloxam’s ‘The Priest and the Acolyte’ (signed ‘X’), which recounted a homosexual suicide with poisoned communion wine, and his pseudonymous poem of boy-love, ‘At Dawn’ (credited to ‘Bertram Lawrence’). Bosie’s ‘Two Loves’ (dedicated to Leverson), and ‘In Praise of Shame’, appeared unashamedly as the work of ‘Lord Alfred Douglas’. The latter’s notorious closing line, ‘I am the Love that dare not speak its name’, would attract particular opprobrium.\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 19\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n20\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nWhile Bloxam worked on the Chameleon, Constance Wilde was assembling another collection of her husband’s witticisms, printed privately as Oscariana in January 1895 (Guy and Small 2000: 178–83). Here Wilde was read on his own terms, but in the Chameleon, words and phrases resounded in an echo chamber of esoteric meaning and allusions. Jerome K. Jerome was appalled, using his editorial in To-day to draw a distinction between the private ‘dirty stories in the club smokingroom’ and the public issuing of a magazine which ‘any immature youth, or foolish New Young Woman’ might buy. The Chameleon, he bawled, ‘appears to be nothing more nor less than an advocacy for indulgence in the cravings of an unnatural disease’, and his conclusion was as sombre as it was denunciatory. ‘It can serve no purpose but that of evil [. . .] this is unbridled licence [. . .] garbage and offal’ (29/12/94: 241). Perhaps he recalled The Green Carnation’s words on colour-changing reptiles. ‘Lord Reggie,’ wrote Hichens, ‘is one of the most utterly vicious young men of the day. Why? Because, like the chameleon, he takes his colour from whatever he rests upon, or is put near. And he has been put near scarlet instead of white’ ([1894] 1949: 70).\n\nOn the Prowl Jerome was outraged by the Chameleon, but one wonders how he encountered it. With a print run of only 100 copies, and a high price of 15s, the result of paying for it on subscription (three numbers were planned per volume), its influence was limited. Even the controversial YB did well to sell more than 5,000 copies an issue after its sensational debut in April 1894. The two publications are seen as agents of what Gissing termed ‘sexual anarchy’, the dissolution of traditional constructions of masculinity and femininity often regarded as a keynote of the fin de siècle, but they were only part of a more complex dispute about sexuality, gender, morals and the relationship between the state and the individual. In late 1894, the press was less preoccupied with the corrupting effects of undergraduate journalism than with a prolonged argument over prostitution in London’s music halls, specifically the Empire and Alhambra Theatres in Leicester Square. As E.S. Turner observes, it now seems remarkable that when prostitution was all but unanimously regarded as a social evil, so many commentators defended ‘the highly-scented houris and attendant harpies whose only interest was in emptying the pocket books of a raffish male clientele’ (Turner [1950] 1966: 229). Young male prostitutes also frequented the theatre (T. Davis 1992: 124). Nevertheless, those who sought to curb the theatres’\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 20\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n21\n\nexcesses were subjected to remarkable levels of ridicule and abuse. The Empire was notorious for the revealing costumes of its dancers, its titillating ‘living pictures’ (which intrigued Shaw, OT 79–86) and the expensive prostitutes who congregated in its promenade. They were, said W. MacQueen-Pope, ‘wonderful women wonderfully dressed, noiseless on the rich carpet, overwhelmingly alluring in their “known haughtiness,”’ who ‘floated – none of them seemed to walk’ in ‘an atmosphere of rich blue cigar smoke, frangipani, patchouli and the heady scent of champagne’ as an orchestra played in the background (Turner [1950] 1966: 232–3). The spectacle was recorded in poetry by ‘decadent’ poets such as Symons and Theodore Wratislaw, and in the naturalist fiction of Hubert Crackanthorpe and others who adopted Wilde’s view that ‘vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art’ (WCW 17) and attempted to represent theatre scenes without passing moral judgement upon them (Stokes 1989: 53–94; Beckson 1992: 110–28). The Empire promenade was a moral anomaly, its clientele permitted to engage in activities which would have risked arrest if pursued outside. When two American tourists visited the Empire to hear, they hoped, the coster songs of Albert Chevalier, they were shocked by the dancers and by the prostitutes thronging the theatre’s interior. Their horrified hostess, Laura Ormiston Chant, a temperance and vigilance campaigner who belonged to the NVA, took her friend Lady Henry Somerset (sometime wife of the Spirit Lamp lyricist) and went to see for herself. What resulted from this and subsequent visits was Chant’s determination to go before the LCC’s Theatres and Music Halls Committee and oppose the renewal of the Empire’s licence. When she did so on 19 October her stand led to considerable publicity, with her becoming ‘the most popular effigy on Guy Fawkes night’ (Turner [1950] 1966: 235). There followed an increasingly ill-tempered correspondence in the DT initiated by ‘Englishman’, whose letter, headed ‘Prudes on the Prowl’ inspired a music hall song and ‘released a riptide of ridicule’ against Chant and her supporters (238). ‘How long are we patiently to endure the shrill shriek of the emancipated female[?]’ ‘Englishman’ asked: How long must we listen to the impudent piety of these provincial pedlars in social purity who come red-hot from their Chicago platforms and tinpot tabernacles [Chant was often mistaken for an American] to tell this London of ours how she is to amuse herself and how she is to dispose of and harass and drive from pillar to post these unfortunate outcasts whom we have always had and always shall have amongst us? (Turner [1950] 1966: 238)\n\nChant’s protests, and the restrictions on the Empire that followed, sparked demonstrations in London halls, protests from cab drivers and\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 21\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n22\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\ntheatre employees, and a legal challenge from George Edwardes, the Empire’s owner: the embattled Edwardes and his moralistic persecutors were pictured as ‘George and the Dragons’ in satirical cartoons. Punch charged the hawk-nosed, lorgnetted frump, Mrs Prowlina Pry, with ‘intruding’ upon the theatre and ruining the livelihoods of 3,000 employees (27/10/94: 194).2 Yet Chant did not seek to close the theatre, only, as she explained in her pamphlet, ‘Why We Attacked the Empire’ (1895) to prevent it from being ‘a haunt of vice’ (Ledger and Luckhurst 2000: 70) to which the authorities turned a blind eye. Declaring war on drink, vice and gambling, she argued in person and print that theatres should be venues for legitimate entertainment rather than fleshpots or fronts for the sale of alcohol, yet her views were travestied in the press, with the IPN’s ‘The Mummer’ protesting that ‘a few busy bodies’ are ‘wrecking the amusements’ of ‘London’s pleasure-seeking public’ (3/11/94). Radical newspapers such as RN supported her up to a point in order to attack the rich for ‘the cynical indulgence of their lusts’ (Turner [1950] 1966: 246), though their help alienated conservatives. Chant won a partial victory when the LCC forced the Empire to screen off its bars and promenade, but it was short-lived. The flimsy partitions were torn down by a mob, prominent among whom was the young Winston Churchill, then a Sandhurst cadet, who fondly recalled the incident in My Early Life (1930). The theatre’s licence was renewed unconditionally, after its management protested it had been unfairly singled out by vigilance campaigners. The Empire’s promenade remained open until 1916, although theatres which did not have promenades were not allowed to install them. Chant, meanwhile, organised relief for Armenians persecuted in Turkey. In March 1896, she told the NYT she had no wish to lead further agitation in London since ‘nothing could be worse for a reform movement than for it to be constantly associated with the name of a single person’ (14/3/96). Chant’s campaign demonstrated the deep-seated resistance of the establishment to women who ‘interfered’ in male domains – her mastery of cross examination and legal procedure had taken Edwardes, as well as the Empire’s barrister, C.F. Gill, by surprise during the LCC hearing. It showed the continued hypocrisy of the authorities and, as the radical press made clear, foregrounded inequalities between ‘toffs’ in evening dress, who could seemingly behave as they wished, and London’s less privileged citizens, who could not (a private box cost as much as three guineas, while box stalls were 7s 6d). As Barry Faulk shows, Chant also problematised the role and status of the charity worker by visiting the theatre in disguise and by attacking the ‘pleasures’ of privileged men rather than primarily ministering to their victims (2004: 75–110). Like\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 22\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n23\n\nFigure 2.

Finally, the Empire affair showed the might of the press when its firepower was directed at a single issue or person. Those caught in its fusillade were unlikely to emerge unscathed, and it says much for Chant’s courage and personal resilience that she managed to brave the broadsides. Chant’s enemies argued that although the Empire was a venue for prostitution, the women involved were better off safe inside the theatre than the Hogarthian derelicts walking Whitechapel’s streets. Life beyond the haze of gas-light and cigar smoke was often dangerous.3 The CLAA had raised the age of consent for girls to sixteen, and had created in its wake the NVA, a group which combined the Society for the Suppression of Vice, the Minors’ Protection Society, the Belgian Traffic Committee (which dealt with British girls abducted for the European sex trade), and the Central Vigilance Society. As Trevor Fisher shows, it encouraged a more assertive response to prostitution from the police, and the result was a marked rise in prosecutions against brothel keepers, pimps and dealers in pornographic literature and goods (Fisher 1997: 137). The NVA’s efforts increased the number of cases coming to court, which in turn filled the columns of newspapers such as the IPN, a penny weekly founded in 1864 whose circulation had blossomed with the increasing literacy brought about by the educational reforms of the 1870s and 1880s, and which grew from four to eight pages in 1895. Hypocritical and sensational in equal measure – a typical headline was ‘Terrible Panic Amongst Schoolchildren – Exciting Details’ (15/12/94) – and voted ‘the worst newspaper in England’ by readers of the PMG in November 1886, the IPN delighted in stories of sexual misconduct and violence (PMG 23/11/86). Its success showed the public appetite for such journalism, and gave dramatic glimpses of crime and vice throughout the land.\n\nDeath in Kensington On 10 November, the IPN reported the arrest of an ‘artist’, Walter Schultz, who was charged with ‘being a suspected person and loitering in a woman’s dress for an unlawful purpose.’ Police observed him accosting men in Whitechapel High Street between midnight and one o’clock in the morning wearing ‘a black dress, light jacket and cape, black and gold bonnet with large scarlet flowers, a veil, earrings [and] rings’. They soon discovered he wore corsets and ‘padding’ too. Schultz told them\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 24\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n25\n\nhe was ‘a man right enough’ and a medical examination to prove such was unnecessary. ‘A gentleman brought me down from Piccadilly,’ he added. ‘I have done this since I came over [from Germany].’ As Charles van Onselen has shown, sex-trafficking was rife in the East End despite the efforts of the NVA, while the research of H.G. Cocks (98–105) and Matt Cook (42–72) gives some idea of the number of cross-dressed male prostitutes at work in the capital during the 1890s: Schultz lived with a woman who dressed as a man. Two constables testified to having seen Schultz in Whitechapel before, in the company of another ‘lady’ and with men on either arm. When he asked in court why he had not been arrested, the police replied they thought he was female. In May 1871, Ernest Boulton and Frederick Park, cross-dressing theatrical artistes known as Fanny and Stella, had been the subject of a remarkable trial when, following a long period of surveillance, they were arrested leaving the Strand Theatre in drag. Suspected of sexual misdemeanours, and charged with conspiring to commit a felony, the pair claimed they were simply playing a high-spirited prank. Found innocent by the jury after less than an hour’s deliberation, they disappeared into obscurity (M. Kaplan 2005: 19–101). The case was a ninedays’ wonder, ‘Experto Crede’, a contributor to RN, later recalled that though the trial was a ‘fiasco’, it did reduce the ‘swarms’ of ‘sexless youngsters, painted and powdered, sometimes in male dress and sometimes, in female, accosting passers, and becoming daily more brazen and impudent’ (RN 26/5/95). A defence of innocent fun was impossible for Schultz. Judge Robert Biron had no doubt the German loitered ‘with intent to commit a felony’. He sentenced him to three months hard labour.4 ‘The defendant attempted to speak, but was gently lifted out of the dock by the assistant gaoler,’ the report concludes. ‘And I, my Lord, may I say nothing?’ Abuse, assault, rape and even murder were daily realities in Whitechapel, but more prosperous districts of the city were not necessarily safer for lone women at night. On 20 November, a woman lost an eye after her face was slashed by a ‘female fiend’ in Stanhope Gardens, Kensington (IPN 8/12/94). Late on the night of 25 November, the body of Augusta Dawes, also known as Margaret Dawes and Gussie Dudley, a ‘member of the “unfortunate” class’ was found in Holland Park Road outside the house of the artist, Valentine Prinsep (IPN 8/12/94). Her throat had been cut, and a sharp knife and a cherry-wood walking stick were found nearby. Herbert Schmaltz, a painter, who, like Prinsep, was working on a picture for the forthcoming RA exhibition, witnessed the crime. He gave chase but lost the attacker in Kensington High Street. ‘The Kensington Murder’ horrified West London, not simply because\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 25\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n26\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nit was a brutal crime but because of where it had occurred, the gentrified (if poorly lit) suburb which was home to the likes of Lord Leighton, President of the RA; Schmaltz reported he first saw Dawes and her assailant near Leighton’s house (T 11 and 17/12/94). Alarm increased when a letter describing the murder in detail arrived at Kensington police station on 28 November. It bore a Dublin postmark and was signed ‘On the job. From Jack the Ripper’ (T 10 and 11/12/94). On 1 December, another woman was attacked in Stanhope Gardens. Kensington police were now on full alert, seeking a veiled woman ‘who is expected to turn out to be a lunatic with murderous instincts’ (T 4/12/94). She was never found, but on 4 December, ‘Jack the Ripper’ was arrested in Belfast. Four days later, William Hicks was arrested following a chase through Holland Park, having apparently stabbed a woman ‘between the eyes’ (PMG 10/12/94). Those who suspected the Whitechapel Murderer of being a ‘toff’ in 1888 may have felt vindicated by the capture of Reginald Treherne Bassett Saunderson, the son of an Irish JP and Lady Rachel Saunderson, a daughter of the Third Earl of Clonmel. Saunderson’s uncle was Colonel E.J. Saunderson, the Unionist MP for North Armagh, and one of his sisters was married to another MP, H.L. Mulholland (North Derry). Unfortunately, as Reginald Saunderson only celebrated his twenty-first birthday on 23 November, he could not have been responsible for the earlier killings, even if he had stabbed Augusta Dawes. The knife and stick found near the murder scene were recognised, and his handwriting was identified by Dr Langdon-Down, who had cared for the young man at a private school-cum-asylum in Hampton Wick since December 1888. ‘Boyish’, ‘pallid’, and ‘fatigued’, the chain-smoking Saunderson was brought to London for questioning, charged with wilful murder and taken to Holloway Prison (IPN 11/12/94). Langdon-Down’s establishment cared for those who were ‘exceptionally backward or addicted to eccentric habits’ by offering ‘physical, moral, and intellectual training under medical supervision’ (T 4 and 29/12/94). Security was minimal. Saunderson was not kept under restraint, and absconded on several occasions, even enlisting in the Surrey Militia in August 1892. Discharged when his identity was discovered, he was not considered dangerous. His murderous inclinations were apparently triggered by reading news reports of another sensational crime. On 1 December 1894, the IPN reported nine men were awaiting execution in England. Most had murdered their wives or partners in the course of domestic disputes; one, John William Newell, of Loughborough, had beaten his wife Isabella to death with a coal pick in\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 26\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n27\n\nfront of their young son, believing she had been unfaithful (IPN 1 and 15/12/94; Leicester Chronicle 15/12/94). Such tragedies received only passing mention in the national press, but occasionally, murders seized the public imagination, forming a pantheon of ‘classic crimes’. One such case was the murder of the pregnant 23-year-old Florence Dennis, found shot dead in the almost dried-up Prittlewell Brook, near Southend, in June 1894. What gave Dennis’s murder particular interest was the tangled domestic life of the accused, 39-year-old James Canham Read, a cashier at the Royal Albert Dock. Seemingly a model employee and loyal husband who lived in Stepney with his wife and eight children and earned £150 per year, Read was a reckless sexual adventurer who, together with his brother, Harry, exploited the full potential of southeast England’s railway network. In a quadrille that made remarkable demands on his stamina, his income and his capacity for deceit, Read was involved with his wife, Florence Dennis, and Beatrice Kempton, a woman in Upper Mitcham with whom he had a child and with whom he lived occasionally as ‘Mr and Mrs Edgar Benson’, posing as a commercial traveller. He had also pursued an affair with Florence’s older sister, Bertha. Utilising aliases, telegrams and post office boxes, Read ran two separate households as well as visiting the Dennis sisters. When Florence became pregnant, Read’s house of cards collapsed. Absconding with £160 from the Docks, he killed her and fled to Upper Mitcham, where an alias and a new moustache failed to prevent his arrest in early July. He sent his wife £20; despite her parlous domestic state, she returned it to the dockyard, which awarded her a gratuity of £23 the following year. A police search of Read’s home revealed many blank marriage certificate forms. Read’s private life had been uncovered before Southend magistrates in a sensational hearing. Such was the local prejudice against him that November that his trial had to be held in Chelmsford. Large crowds gathered. Robert Coombes, a thirteen-year-old Londoner, was so fascinated by the case that he walked to the trial from Plaistow dressed in his cricket whites. Prosecuted by the Solicitor-General, Sir Frank Lockwood, Read maintained his innocence, but until 1898, the accused was not allowed to testify in their defence in murder trials. Read therefore relied on his brother, who sported a heliotrope tie and a white chrysanthemum buttonhole. His foppish demeanour failed to impress the jury, who swiftly reached a guilty verdict. Despite Harry petitioning the Home Office for clemency, Read was hanged on 4 December. A few days after releasing his brother’s final letter, which pleaded his innocence, Harry Read drowned himself in the Thames (IPN 8 and 15/12/94). Quite how Read’s case inspired Saunderson to emulate Jack the\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 27\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n28\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nRipper only he knew, since the Stepney Lothario and the Whitechapel murderer shared neither motive nor method. Nevertheless, it was apparently reports of the Southend hearing that caused Saunderson to take a knife, send out a servant to get it sharpened, and embark on his murderous mission. The relationship between crime, sensational literature and journalism was of growing concern. Before the murder, Saunderson’s parents had planned to train him as a gardener and ship him off to Canada. Now they sought to use their wealth and influence to rescue him from the Old Bailey, hiring C.F. Gill, the Belfast-born barrister who had one of the capital’s largest practices, as defence counsel. ‘Every effort will be made [. . .] to avoid the publicity of a murder trial,’ the Times reported (7/12/94). At the inquest on 10 December, Saunderson’s father proffered an account of his son’s mental history, only to be told by the Coroner his sanity was not yet an issue. At the remand hearing on 21 December, Gill argued that trying Saunderson would simply waste public money. The police now had a detailed account of his movements on the night of the killing, and Mrs Langdon-Down admitted that although he had ‘never shown any violence, she had heard that he had threatened to put a knife into a lady’ (T 29/12/94). Saunderson had also attacked an assistant gaoler and attempted to escape from the West London police court. His condition deteriorated in Holloway, and he was placed in a straitjacket and padded cell. His trial was due to open at the Old Bailey on 30 January before Mr Justice Wills, but although the jury was sworn in, Saunderson was deemed unfit to plead by reason of insanity and ordered to be detained at Her Majesty’s Pleasure (T 31/1/95).5 He was obviously disturbed, but the murder seemed premeditated, and this merited further investigation. Whether or not family pressure had any bearing on the trial’s abandonment, the affair was not well publicised; the Times devoted only a brief paragraph to the insanity ruling, and Saunderson was quickly forgotten. One final crime to make the headlines in 1894 occurred at Wilde’s beloved Café Royal in Regent Street. Early on 6 December, the night porter, Marius Martin, was struck with a blunt instrument, dying in Charing Cross hospital without regaining consciousness (T 7/12/94). An inquest decided he had probably disturbed burglars tempted by £450 in the restaurant’s cash box, and ruled he was murdered by person or persons unknown. The case was never solved.\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 28\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n29\n\nChristmas Lists and Resolutions As the police hunted the Kensington Murderer, publishers, theatre managers and music hall performers turned their attentions towards Christmas and the pantomime season. Having treated London audiences to her new song, the ‘very saucy’ ‘He Knows a Good Thing when He Sees It’, Marie Lloyd was at Liverpool’s Shakespeare theatre in Pretty Bo-Peep, Little Boy Blue, and the Merry Old Woman who lived in a Shoe, a role which called for tight breeches, singing, acting and dancing. ‘No one else is so clever in suggesting a sous-entendre,’ said the SR. ‘No phrase was ever so innocent that she would not pass it on to you as an insinuation’ (24/11/94: 557). The cross-dressing Vesta Tilley delighted audiences as Dick Whittington at Birmingham’s Prince of Wales theatre. Cross-dressing helped criminalise Walter Schultz; it also played a key role in Brandon Thomas’s farce, Charley’s Aunt (1892), which was enjoying phenomenal popularity at London’s Globe – it celebrated the second year of its run on 21 December, eventually clocking up 1,466 performances in the capital, to say nothing of its success in the provinces and abroad. The doyenne of pantomime dames, Dan Leno, returning in November from a residency in Manchester, was not however called upon to don drag this year, since he was Idle Jack in Drury Lane’s Dick Whittington. Such performers earned considerable sums – though they could not match the great operatic divas such as Nellie Melba, who sang at Covent Garden for £400 a night, and Adelina Patti, who could earn as much as £800 for a single performance in one of the larger provincial cities, the likes of Marie Lloyd and Bessie Bellwood, ‘hearty, British, sympathetically vulgar, full of dash and bounce’ and capable of silencing the rowdiest heckler, still drew £100 per week (SR 24/11/94:557). With such success came the pressure to demonstrate star status offstage. In early December, the comedian Charles Bignell was declared bankrupt with liabilities of £909, ruined by ill health, gambling and moneylenders’ crippling interest rates. The obligation to act ‘swell’ devoured his assets, despite an average income of £750 in the years 1892–4 (IPN 8/12/94). Life in the halls was physically and emotionally demanding. At the end of October, a ‘music hall artiste’ playing the Golden Fleece in Grimsby was committed to the Bracebridge asylum after roaming the streets in her nightdress (IPN 3/11/94). In November, Ben Fuller, a highboard diver at the London Aquarium, was killed attempting a daredevil leap from Tower Bridge (IPN 24/11/94). On Boxing Night, Kittie Tyrell, ‘The Rat’ (‘a rattling demonstrative demon’ according to the programme) in the Elephant and Castle theatre’s production of Dick Whittington and His Cat left the stage feeling faint after\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 29\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n30\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nsinging ‘His road to fortune he’ll pave o’er my corpse’. Within minutes, she died from heart disease in her dressing room, leaving her husband, who was also in the production and contracted for the entire season, to go on with the show (IPN 5/1/95). Even a star of Bellwood’s magnitude was worn out by the demands of her profession. Having gone from being a fur dresser in a Bermondsey clothing factory to the darling of the halls, she died in 1896 aged only thirty-nine. Lloyd may have been the star of Little Bo Peep, but its scenic artist ‘was called to take a bow three times during the course of the show’ (Gillies [1999] 2001: 95). Expensive to stage and with a short seasonal lifespan, pantomimes required financial prudence from theatre managers as well as crowd-pleasing storylines and performers. The same rules applied in the more elevated theatrical world, where productions aspired to higher levels of artistic worth but were equally dependent upon audience approval. In 1894, claimed ‘The Mummer’, almost 500 new plays debuted in London and the provinces, and such plenitude made it very difficult for any new work to succeed. With one theatre for every 145,000 Londoners, playgoers had plenty of choice, and while provincial cities could not match London in this regard, most had several theatres and halls (IPN 29/12/94). Larger venues spent heavily on advertising and gimmicks. Collins’ Music Hall had a 4 ft by 3 ft iron-framed sign made of coloured glass illuminated by gas jets: the profusion of such devices led to the London Sky Signs Act 1891 to control their use. Failure in such surroundings was as public as it was costly. As 1895 drew near, Arthur Wing Pinero, Oscar Wilde and Henry James were looking to have new plays on the London stage, with Wilde’s An Ideal Husband due to open on 3 January at the Haymarket’s Theatre Royal, James’s Guy Domville opening two days later at the St James’s and Pinero’s The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith, the follow-up to The Second Mrs Tanqueray (1894) due to be performed at the Garrick in March. The supreme actor of the day, Henry Irving was meanwhile rehearsing for the title role in J. Comyns Carr’s lavish King Arthur, scheduled to open at the Lyceum on 12 January. Dearly wishing to write for the stage yet eternally unsuccessful, James was anxious about the forthcoming production. His friend Rudyard Kipling in far-away Vermont attempted to calm him by prophesying ‘This year is going to bring you luck and you’ll have a play that goes’ (Kipling 1990: 163), but James still complained of the ‘nervousness and the exhaustion’ of rehearsals (James 1980: 496). He was, he told one of his many correspondents, ‘too preoccupied, too terrified, too fundamentally distracted, to be fit for human intercourse’ (496). As the opening night approached, he told Edmund Gosse ‘I am more or less,\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 30\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n31\n\nalready under chloroform’ (504). In the preface to the second series of Theatricals, a collection of his unperformed plays published in late 1894, James wrote, ‘There is no room in a play for the play itself until everything (including the play, the distracted neophyte pantingly ascertains) has been completely eliminated. Then the fun, as the vulgar phrase is, begins.’ Such beliefs did not bode well for Guy Domville, especially when espoused by a man of negligible dramatic pedigree. Although James had written a number of plays and dramatic scenarios, only The American had made it to the stage, managing sixty-nine performances at the Opera Comique in 1891. The NYT felt James’s plays exhibited ‘a lack of theatrical “perspective,”’ regretting ‘there is not a theatre in the whole English-speaking world where such plays can be properly tried for the benefit of the few who would like to see them’ (15/12/94). Wilde had enjoyed notable successes with his society comedies Lady Windermere’s Fan (1892) and A Woman of No Importance (1893). His understanding of theatrical time and space was far superior to James’s, but he lacked Pinero’s practical experience as an actor and director and became irritating in rehearsals, chain-smoking his way through observations and asides of questionable utility. He caused particular ill feeling by summoning the cast of An Ideal Husband to a meeting on Christmas morning, antagonising Charles Brookfield who played Lord Goring’s valet. In May 1892, Brookfield had written and starred in The Poet and the Puppets, with Charles Hawtrey, Lord Goring in An Ideal Husband, playing ‘A Poet’ in an obvious caricature of Wilde.6 Brookfield’s squib which, as Beerbohm said, depicted Wilde as ‘a fat man with a taste for dyed flowers and epigramme’ (ILN 15/9/94: 406), was an attempt at revenge; according to Ellmann, he had never forgiven Wilde for highlighting his faux pas in keeping gloves on at a tea party. Educated at Westminster and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won the Winchester Reading Prize in 1878, Brookfield came from an illustrious artistic family (his mother was a niece of Henry Hallam and friend of Thackeray) and aspired to be known as a wit. Resenting Wilde’s success, he did not appreciate his patronising manner, and their relationship deteriorated quickly. The damaging consequences of their rivalry would soon become obvious. The Christmas book market was buoyant, not least because 1894 was a decisive year in Britain’s shift from being primarily a bookborrowing nation to becoming a book-owning one. Before that June, many novels initially appeared in three volume form, with each volume available from Mudie’s or other subscription libraries. Annual membership cost a guinea, allowing members to borrow one volume at a time, a fair bargain when a three-decker cost 31s 6d. Variable levels of\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 31\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\n32\n\n1895: Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain\n\nsubscription up to one hundred guineas allowed for increased borrowing; it was normally months before a 6s edition of a novel appeared. The system encouraged novelists to spin out a story into three volumes – as with mid-Victorian ladies’ fashion, the original form became invisible beneath layers of padding. It also allowed libraries to police the content of fiction by refusing to stock works they deemed unsuitable for family reading. Unofficial censorship had angered progressively-minded novelists since the 1870s, but it remained in place despite the growing success of writers such as Stevenson and Rider Haggard who wrote affordable single volume adventure fiction, and publishers such as John Lane who issued single volume collections of controversial short stories; his edition of George Egerton’s Keynotes (1893) quickly sold over 6,000 copies. Such writers sidestepped the library system altogether, with Lane ‘introducing the publishing principle that all authors should always get a royalty’ (Lambert and Ratcliffe 1987: 51), even if his payments to them were often embarrassingly delayed. On 27 June, Mudie’s signed an historic agreement with W.H. Smith, the firm which monopolised railway bookstalls and specialised in single volume reprints of older fiction. Despite selling on their three-deckers once cheap editions had appeared, the libraries were becoming overwhelmed by storage problems, and this finally forced them to take action, reducing the fees paid to publishers for new books in an attempt to slim down the size of individual novels and the numbers of them in circulation. They also sought, less successfully, to retard further the appearance of cheap editions of single volume works. The impact, combined with the declining cost of paper, was immediate. Publication of three-deckers fell from 184 in 1894 to fifty-two in 1895, twenty-five in 1896 and a mere four in 1897 (Keating [1898] 1991: 26). The ending of the libraries’ virtual monopoly had important consequences for the content as well as the sales and distribution of novels, since although books were still borrowed from Mudie’s, it could no longer easily control their content. Transgressive subject matter and radical technical innovation increased for, as Arthur Morrison lamented, the library system had placed literature under ‘irresponsible’, ‘arbitrary’ and ‘intolerable censorship’ (A 27/4/95: 536–7). Children’s books were usually single volumes and tended to bypass the library system. They were an especially popular Christmas present for middle class children, and the market for them was expanding yearly. Kipling’s The Jungle Book, which Wilde bought for his son Vyvyan, sold 8,000 copies in the weeks before Christmas (Bookman 3/95: 167). The veteran G.A. Henty offered Wulf the Saxon, When London Burned, In Freedom’s Cause: A Story of Wallace and Bruce and In the\n\nFREEMAN PRINT.indd 32\n\n22/08/2011 12:10\n\nWinter: 15 September 1894 – 28 February 1895\n\n33\n\nHeart of the Rockies; his even more prolific female counterpart, L.T. Meade Betty, a Schoolgirl and Red Rose and Tiger Lily alongside adult novels A Life for a Love, the two volume In an Iron Grip and the three decker, A Soldier of Fortune.7 E.A. Lemann’s illustrated edition of Hans Christian Anderson’s The Snow Queen was widely commended. Boys’ books celebrated British martial triumphs on land and sea, frequently dramatising episodes from the Indian Mutiny or the naval battles of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. A typical example, Commander C.N. Robinson and John Leyland’s To the Honour of the Flag: A Story of Our Sea-Fights with the Dutch was a book ‘every boy should read’ (PMG 15/12/94). That only a fraction of the nation’s children were at public school did not prevent tales of public school life being extremely popular. One of the more imaginative examples was Robert Overton’s Lights Out!, which adapted the narrative structure of the Decameron to the dormitory of Dr Audlem’s college. Adults meanwhile shuddered round the fire with Mrs J.H. Riddell’s ghost stories, The Banshee’s Warning and Other Tales, Conan "
