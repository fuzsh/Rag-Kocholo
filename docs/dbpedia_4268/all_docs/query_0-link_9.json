        "text": "Citation preview\n\nTHE BUSINESS OF ARMAMENTS\n\nHow did Britain’s most prominent armaments firms, Armstrongs and Vickers, build their businesses and sell armaments in Britain and overseas from 1855 to 1955? Joanna Spear presents a comparative analysis of these firms and considers the relationships they built with the British Government and foreign states. She reveals how the firms developed and utilized independent domestic strategies and foreign policies against the backdrop of imperial expansion and the two world wars. Using extensive new research, this study examines the challenges the two firms faced in making domestic and international sales including the British Government’s commitment to laissez faire policies, prejudices within the British elite against those in trade, and departmental resistance to dealing with private firms. It shows the suite of strategies and tactics that the firms developed to overcome these obstacles to selling arms at home and abroad and how they built enduring relationships with states in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. Joanna Spear is Research Professor of International Affairs at George Washington University. She works on armaments, arms sales and arms control issues and is the author of Carter and Arms Sales (1995).\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nTHE BUSINESS OF ARMAMENTS Armstrongs, Vickers and the International Arms Trade, 1855–1955\n\nJOANNA SPEAR George Washington University\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nShaftesbury Road, Cambridge CB2 8EA, United Kingdom One Liberty Plaza, 20th Floor, New York, NY 10006, USA 477 Williamstown Road, Port Melbourne, VIC 3207, Australia 314–321, 3rd Floor, Plot 3, Splendor Forum, Jasola District Centre, New Delhi – 110025, India 103 Penang Road, #05–06/07, Visioncrest Commercial, Singapore 238467 Cambridge University Press is part of Cambridge University Press & Assessment, a department of the University of Cambridge.

Armstrongs and Vickers invented, manufactured and marketed armaments, and built relationships with the British Government and with other states. The book argues that Armstrongs and Vickers developed and utilized independent domestic strategies and foreign policies. These were initially necessitated by the British Government’s indifference to their existence, attempts to exploit them and resistance to helping them sell abroad. Even as their relationships with the British Government grew, the firms maintained their own interests, strategies and foreign policies. They were independent actors. Throughout the century considered here, the British Government consistently worked in its own interests. The firms’ most prominent customer disregarded contracts and canceled orders, disputed royalties, brought in new firms to invigorate competition, worked to reduce firms’ profits and assumed no responsibility for keeping them in business. The firms strategized in response. Relationships with the British Government were therefore a wary dance for Armstrongs, Vickers and other armament firms.\n\nSelection of Firms The first firm is commonly known as “Armstrongs,” after its founder, William Armstrong of Newcastle upon Tyne. He was a Victorian inventor interested in problem-solving and engineering, with a good understanding of business and finance. From the early 1860s, when “Armstrong Guns” were first produced at the Elswick Ordnance Works in Newcastle, until around 1900, Armstrongs was the most prominent British armament firm and enjoyed buoyant overseas sales. After 1900 there was more competition in the domestic and international armaments markets and the firm became less successful. In the interwar period Armstrongs struggled to adapt to the depressed market and its efforts to diversify into civilian markets were disastrous, leading to their amalgamation as a junior partner with our second firm. This firm, colloquially called “Vickers,” was a family business in Yorkshire engaged in milling before moving into steel production. An entrepreneurial 1\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nfirm, they moved into armor manufacture in 1888. Vickers was particularly adept at bringing in talented managers and salespeople. The firm grew significantly around the turn of the century via inspired mergers, acquisitions and licensing deals. In the Edwardian period Vickers grew as Armstrongs struggled. In 1927 Vickers cherrypicked the best of Armstrongs, amalgamating into Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd., thereby becoming the premier British armament firm. Although Armstrongs and Vickers faced the same markets, their responses to them were somewhat different. The firms emphasized different strategies, reflecting their varying strengths, and developed distinct organizational cultures. Both firms faced significant peaks and troughs in orders over the century covered in this book, so there are many opportunities to see their domestic strategies and foreign policies in operation and to assess their success. The centrality of these two firms to British armaments production, their distinct strategies, their subtly different relationships with the British state and their approaches to exports make them important subjects for analysis. Both firms left extensive archives. The Armstrongs papers are available at the Tyne and Wear Archive housed in the Discovery Museum, Newcastle upon Tyne. The Vickers Archive is housed in the Department of Manuscripts and University Archives, Cambridge University Library, Cambridge. These archives are invaluable for understanding how Armstrongs and Vickers assessed their situations, developed their strategies and responded to the many crises they faced. Documents held by regional archives and local newspapers also reveal insights into the firms. British National Archive documents show how Armstrongs and Vickers’ most prominent customer, the British Government, perceived them and what British Embassy staff observed of the firms’ behaviors abroad. Together these sources provide an excellent basis for examining the domestic strategies and foreign policies of Armstrongs and Vickers, and for assessing the degrees of independence and power they held in their relationships with the British Government. These relationships evolved over time, the increasing reach of the state gradually bringing them closer together. However, the catalysts for major changes in the relationship were the two world wars, as is now briefly illustrated.\n\nThe Arc of the State–Firm Relationship When Armstrongs and Vickers were founded, there were well-established Royal Arsenals and Dockyards serving the state, so the firms were – necessarily – completely independent. The British Government initially used the firms instrumentally, employing Armstrongs to create and manufacture a new gun (then casting them aside) and Vickers to create domestic competition in armor production (before casting them aside too). This set the pattern. Early on the government stole armament firms’ patents and refused to pay royalties.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nIndeed, the War Office consistently regarded private firms as unwelcome competition to the Royal Arsenals and first sought to exclude them from the British market, before moving to treating them as producers of last resort. Initially the British Government was committed to laissez-faire (the principle that government should not control business) and provided neither subsidies nor export help. Armament firms therefore had distant relationships with the British Government. This contrasted with the situations in Germany and France, where armament firms received domestic subsidies and help to sell abroad. The British firms often complained about the disparity. For example, in 1888 the Armstrongs agent in Turkey protested that “any German subject who has business with or claim upon the Turkish government gets the most powerful support from his ambassador here. We get absolutely None.”1 However, because the firms were independent, they did not need to align with British strategic interests, giving them great freedom. The lack of British secrecy laws until 1889, and the weakness of those enacted, gave Armstrongs and Vickers a relatively free hand in foreign markets. The armament firms sometimes undertook exports that the British Government opposed but was powerless to prevent. The 1870 Foreign Enlistment Act was the first legislation enabling the British Government to restrict private firms’ exports, and then only to states at war. In peacetime the firms had the freedom to pursue their own foreign policies. This sometimes resulted in the Admiralty buying products destined for export as this was the only way to prevent the recipients from acquiring more sophisticated warships than Britain. The government incrementally instituted export controls. While initially indifferent to the impact of armament firms’ exports – unless they affected British neutrality or reserves for war – after 1886 the British Government realized the economic advantages of sales and began to edge into providing sporadic and limited help in marketing armaments abroad. Laissez-faire ruled the British Government’s approach to armament firms for many decades. Consonant with that, Armstrongs and Vickers pursued their own domestic strategies and foreign policies. However, the government’s approach changed completely during the Great War because the armament firms were vital to the war effort. Now the government strongly regulated production. As Armstrongs’ Chairman John Meade Falkner sorrowfully told shareholders in 1915, “instead of private enterprise we have become a Government arsenal under Government control.”2 The firms now built exclusively for the British Government, thereby sacrificing many foreign policy goals and longterm relationships. While government domination of production and trade ended in 1918, regulation never retreated to prewar levels. Laissez-faire in the 1 2\n\nLeak to Elswick, October 20, 1888. TWA, 31/4187.

Armstrongs and Vickers had expanded their capacities enormously for the war effort but in 1918 British orders were immediately canceled and armament firms were cast adrift into a depressed market. Subsequently, the British Government’s commitment to naval arms control severely limited both domestic production and exports. After trying to diversify into civilian fields, many armament firms went out of business during the interwar years. Our two firms became Vickers-Armstrongs. While the Admiralty and Air Ministry drip-fed domestic ship and aircraft contracts to keep the surviving firms afloat, the War Office did not. By the 1930s, influenced by rising unemployment and the Great Depression, the British Government began to give more assistance to firms to market their wares abroad. Nevertheless, in 1935, under pressure from negative public opinion, there was a Royal Commission investigation into the profits and behavior of armament firms. With German revanchism casting a long shadow, the British Government and Vickers-Armstrongs worked in parallel – but, crucially, not in collaboration – to oppose the demand for the nationalization of all weapons production. They were successful. As war loomed once again and rearmament began, Vickers-Armstrongs asked to be allowed to maintain some level of exports to countries such as Portugal and Turkey because it would be hard to restart such relationships after a complete hiatus. The government agreed. The relationship between armament firms and the British state further deepened during World War Two. The firms again freely loaned senior personnel to the government for the war effort. The state gave armament firms subsidies to increase capacity and develop new weapons systems; it gave them responsibility over many “Shadow Factories” and closely supervised all armament production and export. Once again, regulation receded postwar, but not to prewar levels. In the early 1950s Britain adopted industrial strategies for key sectors such as military production. This clipped the wings of British armament firms, a process further accelerated by the nationalization of Vickers-Armstrongs’ English Steel Corporation, something they had strongly resisted. Nationalization changed the firm–state relationship quite dramatically. Vickers-Armstrongs had lost an innovation hub and was now reliant on the products of the British Steel Corporation. The government nevertheless still prioritized national strategic interests over industrial concerns. Luckily, the export interests of VickersArmstrongs now often coincided with the state’s interests in retaining a share of international markets and sustaining strategic influence in key areas of the globe in the face of strong international competition and the burgeoning Cold War. Now the British Government actively supported arms exports to markets such as Latin America and the Middle East. Hence, by 1955, where this book closes, the arc of the relationship between armament firms and the state had evolved from independence to interdependence.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nA Military–Industrial Complex? This book’s focus on the power and independence of Armstrongs and Vickers casts light on debates over relations between armament firms and states. Considering armament firms as independent actors is a rather different framing from many works in history and political science. These disciplines have traditionally assumed a dependent relationship between all types of firms and sovereign states, with the latter by far the dominant actors, making firms unnecessary for analysis.3 In 1961 a different paradigm of the armament firm– state relationship emerged, something that President Dwight D. Eisenhower termed a “Military Industrial Complex.”4 This important concept reflected the Cold War reality that the United States now needed to consistently innovate and manufacture armaments, rather than just turning to production when war loomed. This shift created a cadre of permanent armament firms constantly interacting with the military services and the legislative committees charged with appropriating defense funds and building strong relationships; this sometimes created “Iron Triangles” which the executive branch struggled to control.5 While this concept was initially used to explain the contemporary situation, there has developed an interesting body of scholarship tracing the roots of the United States’ military–industrial complex back to the nineteenth century.6 Importantly, as Maurice Pearton astutely noted, the military–industrial complex is a peculiarly American phenomenon, and therefore “The term fails to explain with any degree of precision what takes place elsewhere, where values and practices differ.”7 Moreover, the relationship between armament firms and the state “depends upon the political culture in which they are experienced. They work out differently in different societies.”8 The British parliamentary system, with executive branch dominance, strong and disciplined political parties and a legislature with a minimal role in defense budgeting, does not easily lend itself to the classical military–­industrial complex paradigm. However, that does not in itself mean that there was no ­military–industrial complex in Britain during the period 1855–1955. What did contemporary critics say? There were two phases when British armament firms were under sustained fire, first around 1906–08 and, more acutely, in the 1930s. In each case, though, the criticism was not that there was a military–­industrial complex, but rather that armament firms were independent “­merchants of death” fomenting wars to reap profits, acting in their own interests, colluding with international firms and disregarding the interests of their home states. 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nA notable exception was the British East India Company.

As Christopher Miller has noted, the idea of a military–industrial complex and the concerns in the 1930s about the merchants of death “do not sit well with each other. One asserts that the state and industry had an uncomfortably close relationship, while the other argues that arms manufacturers caused wars by playing nations against one another.”9 In the 1930s the critics’ preferred solution was the nationalization of armament firms. Clearly the state was not perceived as part of the problem – indeed, it was the solution – whereas the independence of armament firms was the issue. During both phases of public criticism, the British Government was largely silent, refusing to engage with critics in the House of Commons, until its hand was forced by various peace ballots. At the subsequent 1935–36 Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of and Trading in Arms (Bankes Commission), important government figures arose to defend the armament firms. They were regarded as critical if the country was to survive any future conflict with Germany. Katherine Epstein’s book Torpedo does claim to have identified a military–­ industrial complex in Britain. This is particularly relevant as in 1906 both Armstrongs and Vickers took shares in Whiteheads, the firm at the center of her British case study. Epstein follows the development of torpedoes in the United States and Britain from their origins in the 1860s to their deployment in the Great War. She argues that torpedo technology led to a “new procurement paradigm” because “Industrial naval technology was so sophisticated and expensive that traditional methods of building weapons in public-owned ­factories or purchasing them as finished products from private contractors did not suffice. Instead, governments had to invest in private-sector technology during the experimental phase.”10 She sees this as indicating the emergence of military–­industrial complexes in both countries.11 However, the evidence suggests that this interpretation fits the United States better than Great Britain. Regarding Epstein’s claim of a new procurement model with state investment in research and development, this is not how the government behaved in the cases of Armstrongs and Vickers, two of Britain’s most important suppliers. In fact, the omnipotent Treasury ensured that laissez-faire always prevailed. There was complete unwillingness to subsidize research and development until the point at which an armament firm had already developed an innovative product; the government would then “reward” the firm with a contract for a limited number of experimental models. Indeed, this is what happened with the Whitehead torpedo and later with Whitehead’s experimental gyroscopes – four of these 9 10 11\n\nMiller, Planning, p. 6. Epstein, Torpedo, p. 2. The assertion is in the introduction and in the last paragraph of the book. Epstein, Torpedo, p. 229.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nwere tested and then a large order placed.12 Rather than the British procurement model showing the existence of a military–industrial complex, it showed the government having a limited relationship with firms, one that shifted the risks onto them, only rewarding successes with contracts. In turn, armament firms sought to price their products to include profits that would compensate them for their up-front investments in research and development. To this author, Epstein’s detailed account of the long negotiations between the Whitehead Company and the Admiralty shows something other than a military–industrial complex. The relationship was defined by extremely defensive behavior on both sides and constant disputes over prices, royalties and even patents. Two examples from 1896 illustrate the difficult relationship. Six years after Whiteheads had established a factory at Weymouth with Admiralty encouragement, the Admiralty brought in Greenwood and Batley to make torpedoes too, ending Whitehead’s monopoly and ability to set prices.13 The same year, a Whitehead tender for a contract to produce 220 torpedoes to a Royal Gun Factory design raised the proposed price per torpedo on the grounds that it had tendered the previous time without being informed of the accuracies required. The firm also complained about earlier delays in getting drawings and specifications from the Admiralty and “having to incorporate ‘glaring errors in design’ in the RGF [Royal Gun Factory]-pattern torpedoes.”14 Although Admiralty officials had themselves been critical of the Royal Gun Factory designs, they now banded together to criticize the firm. In these interactions over torpedoes spanning three decades, the state and the firm were jockeying for position, disputing over money and rights, and not behaving as though there was a strong confluence of interests between them. Epstein’s claim that there was a British military–industrial complex prior to 1918 are not proven. Jon Sumida recounts the conflictual relationship between Arthur Hungerford Pollen, inventor of a fire-control system, and the Royal Navy. In his dealings with the Admiralty between 1900 and 1914, Pollen encountered conservatism, bureaucratic inertia, administrative rigidity, financial restrictions and difficult personalities. These combined to inhibit the evaluation and acceptance of his important new technology, which was ultimately rejected in 1910. It was only after the failures of Royal Naval gunnery in battles such as Jutland that the service was finally prodded to adopt Pollen’s fire-control system in the mid-1920s.15 More broadly, the fact that the Admiralty kept lists of approved suppliers does not indicate per se a military–industrial complex.16 The content of those relationships must be considered.

The interests of the state and firms differed, especially over money and risk, and they constantly struggled for advantage. There is another strand of literature that abuts on discussions of a British military–industrial complex. It debates the question of British military strength between the wars, pitting “declinists” such as Corelli Barnett against academics such as David Edgerton and Edward Packard, who argue that the British state (and by extension British armament firms) was not left fundamentally weak by the interwar years but was what Edgerton terms a “Warfare State.”17 Edgerton shows how, during the interwar period, the British state, particularly the military, became dominant in research and development, after a long period where the armament firms were major initiators.18 The major theme of Edgerton’s impressive oeuvre is correcting the standard view of Britain as a declining, anti-militarist state between the wars, and defeating the historical tropes that have resulted from that (in his view, incorrect) solely “welfarist” interpretation of British history.19 Edgerton’s task is much broader than the one taken on in this book – no less than revising the historiography of twentieth-century Britain – but his views of the period 1920–70 must be considered as he explicitly makes arguments about, and uses the language of, a British military–industrial complex. The condition of British armament manufacturers, including VickersArmstrongs, is important to this debate over British strength and preparedness prior to World War Two.20 Edgerton assumes that British armament firms (broadly defined) were fully at the disposal of the British state and that there was therefore a military–industrial complex. However, as this book shows, Vickers-Armstrongs always maintained some interests distinct from those of the British Government, and even at this point of interdependence in the 1930s, still clashed with the state. For his analysis of the strength of the armaments industry, Edgerton relies on a mix of official histories (though critical of their coverage and analysis21), an authorized history, J. D. Scott’s Vickers: A History, and other works covering Armstrongs and Vickers and an array of British firms.22 Edgerton notes dismissively that these “Specialist inquiries into each armed service and the arms industry have habitually presented detailed accounts and explanations to match 17 18 19 20 21\n\n22\n\nBarnett, The Audit of War; Edgerton, Warfare.

Many firms went out of business and there were major amalgamations and subsequent rationalizations of production. Consequently, overall British armaments production capacity was reduced and remained largely unmodernized. The problems were most pronounced in artillery and land systems since the War Office penchant for favoring the Royal Arsenals left the remaining producers – including Vickers-Armstrongs – in poor shape. The Admiralty and Air Ministry had kept their remaining producers on contractual life support, so they were in a somewhat better position. Packard’s work is important because he broadly follows Edgerton’s line, but his research utilizes the archives of Vickers and Vickers-Armstrongs. It is an elegant piece of scholarship. Packard argues – contra the declinists – that Vickers-Armstrongs had great strength during the interwar period, but that the British Government thought otherwise, and those assumptions guided state policies.25 However, this analysis prompts a vital question: If there was a British military–industrial complex, would the state so misunderstand the strength of the premier British armament firm? The major works on Armstrongs and Vickers do not allude to a military– industrial complex.26 However, many of these studies focus only on business history. Work by Clive Trebilcock seeks to rehabilitate the image of British armament firms from the “merchants of death” formulation, particularly concerning the use of domestic and international and armament trusts (rings).27 His important book on Vickers is framed by examining structural relations between the firm and the state, specifically the consequences of oligopoly and monopsony.28 However, this focus on economic explanations minimizes the role of politics and relationships in the story of the British Government and Vickers. His works nevertheless show that the British Government was constantly seeking to rein in the armament firms by introducing new suppliers to keep competition keen and innovations flowing, using the Royal Arsenals and Dockyards as benchmarks for pricing, and using contracting to restrain expenditure and profits. In turn, the firms were seeking to maximize profits from government work, minimize state intervention in their activities and 23 24 25 26 27 28\n\nEdgerton, Warfare, p. 16. Edgerton, Warfare, p. 334.

There is less evidence of confluence than there is of the two sides seeking to outsmart the other. For a military–industrial complex to occur there would need to be a record of a significant, consistent confluence of interests between the British state and the firms. As this book will demonstrate, initially there was no such overlap of interests, and it grew only episodically over the century considered here. By 1955, when this study ends, the relationship between armament firms and the state was interdependent and close because of the state’s dominance of industrial planning and regulation, provision of subsidies for research and development, and support for exports. However, collaboration did not equal harmony. Armament firms and the state still retained distinct and incompatible interests: over domestic procurement and spending restraint; over profit levels; over levels of subsidies; over research and development expenditures; over exports; and over regulation. They were two actors in a relationship that were constantly sparring over a range of issues, albeit now with the deck stacked in the state’s favor. This was not a seamless military–industrial complex.\n\nAssessing the Independence and Power of Armstrongs and Vickers If Armstrongs and Vickers were creating independent relationships and running their own foreign policies, there should be evidence of this in their archives. Further, if they were truly independent, there should be areas where the foreign policies the two firms pursued were significantly different to those of the British Government, and this should be reflected in official records. Two propositions are derived from this: • If armament firms were independent actors, there will be evidence of them selling to whomever they wanted; and • If British armament firms had independent foreign policies, there will be examples of them doing things that the British Government did not approve of, especially in terms of exports. There should also be evidence of divergent opinions between them and the British Government, reflecting their different goals and interests. To test these propositions, the book uses extensive case studies to explore the firms’ foreign relations with Latin America, Asia and Turkey. The armaments trade is oligopolistic. That is, there were always a limited number of armaments producers, domestically and internationally. This was because of the very high costs of becoming, the escalating costs of remaining and the financial risks associated with being an armaments manufacturer. Those costs limited the number of suppliers, particularly at the technologically innovative end of the market. This had implications for power relationships. The oligopolistic structure of the market meant that the British Government did not have many alternative suppliers and would have faced extremely steep\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nreentry costs if it decided to bring sophisticated armament production inhouse. This gave armament firms some power in their relationship with the state. However, while oligopoly handed some power to firms, monopsony handed some back to the government. As the major recipient of the armament firms’ products, the British Government had significant power in those relationships. The armament firms depended on government business, so were obliged to accommodate the wishes of the state in terms of pricing, profits, exports, and so on, while also developing strategies and tactics designed to curb the British Government’s power as a monopsonist. The domestic independence of the firms prompts a bigger question: Did this independence reflect or give them any power in their relationships with the British Government? Also, as the relationship between armament firms and the British Government changed over the century covered in this book, how did the power of the firms in relation to the government evolve over time? To answer these questions, it is helpful to briefly unpack ideas from political science about what power is and how it can be used. As Britain is a democracy, it is appropriate to begin from the classic pluralist stance which sees power as dispersed and not just lying with the state.29 It is important to see where, beyond the government, power lies and how it is wielded. This investigation has been helpfully done through various iterations of democratic theory by considering different dimensions, or “faces,” of power. These dimensions reflect a hierarchy, with each face representing a more “powerful” version; the more powerful an actor, the less power it needs to expend to achieve a desired outcome. Moreover, in creating their own taxonomy of power, Michael Barnett and Raymond Duvall make the important point that these conceptions of power are not competing but are connected (indeed, this author would say cumulative).30 Considering these “faces” of power provides a framework for analyzing the degree of power that the armament firms were able to wield – or not – in their relationships with the British Government. The “first face of power” is the most straightforward. Power is used by one actor to influence the behavior of another. This is relational power. It exists in the relationship of one actor to another actor, and the ratio of power varies depending on the actors involved. Our concern is the British Government’s relationships with the armament firms, and vice versa. Most obvious was the power of the British Government to structure the regulatory environment in which armament firms operated, for example, directly through restrictions on exports, rules on secrecy, ceilings on profits and so on. The state also shaped the economy in which armament firms operated through policies on infrastructure, regulation, education, production and so on. This is often called “authority”; it signals the legitimacy of the government to exercise that power. 29 30\n\nDerived from the classic work by Dahl, Who Governs. Barnett and Duval, “Power.”\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe British Government was initially slow to use that direct authority but over time exercised more of it over the armament firms through regulation. Ironically, though, in parallel the government became more invested in the armament firms’ success, reflected in the growth in contracts awarded to Armstrongs and Vickers and increasing government support for research and armaments exports. Growing interdependence saw the firms retain some power and leverage in their relationship with the state even as they lost some independence. In the British democratic pluralist system, actors such as armament firms potentially have some power, essentially derived from their positions in the economy. Their economic heft and the employment they provide can create political support for armament firms, which might enable them to: influence the government’s selection of one weapon over another; gain permission to export an armament; win a subsidy; or prevent something bad from happening to them – such as contracts going to a rival, a tax being imposed on their profits or nationalization being pursued. Where an armament firm sought to make something happen – or to prevent something from happening – and was successful, they would have shown they had relational power and exercised the “first face” of power in relation to the government. Indeed, even a negotiation between an armament firm and the government over an issue such as subsidies, weapons choices, exports or industry structure is a signal that a firm (or firms in concert) had some power in that relationship. Two propositions can be derived from this: • If Armstrongs and Vickers had relational power in relation to the British Government, there will be evidence of interactions in the records of the firms and the state, for example, showing the firms successfully negotiating over relevant issues. • Armstrongs and Vickers will have been shown to have strong relational power if they have influenced the British Government to act in their favor. The firms should win victories or concessions on issues such as subsidies, costs, profits, competition, penalty clauses in procurement contracts, export controls, patent rules, taxation levels and so on. The “second face of power” is defined as an actor being able to set the agenda. It is a more effective form of wielding power because not as many resources need to be expended to achieve the desired ends. While agenda-setting power might be expected to lie with the government, if a firm has more than relational power, it should be able to set the agenda on issues it cares about. Agenda-setting can be both positive – for example, support for building more warships – or ­negative (a “nondecision”) – for example, preventing substantive discussions of the profits or behavior of armament firms.31 This can be formulated as: 31\n\nFor a discussion of power as the ability to structure the environment or “mobilize bias” to put issues on or keep issues off the agenda, see Bacharach and Baratz, “Two Faces.”\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\n• In Armstrongs and Vickers’ relationships with the British Government, the second face of power will be in evidence if the two firms were able to put favorable issues such as more military spending or generous profit levels on the agenda and to keep negative issues – such as investigations into their behavior or limits on their profits – off the agenda. Finally, the “third face of power” is what Steven Lukes calls “ideological power,” that is, effectively structuring the political environment so that alternatives are completely excluded and actors do not realize that other possibilities exist. This ideological power is described as the ultimate form of power as the holders do not need to expend any of it to achieve their ends because they have so successfully structured the realm of possibilities.32 This can be formulated into the following proposition: • In the relationship between Armstrongs, Vickers and the British Government, the firms will show ideological power if there is evidence of the British Government unquestioningly adopting the interests of the firms in terms of issues such as military spending, armaments sales at home and abroad, profit levels and subsidies. Considering this three-level framework, this book uses process-tracing techniques to examine the behaviors of Armstrongs and Vickers in relation to the British Government and key foreign governments. The book proceeds as follows. Part One covers selling weapons at home. Chapter 1 lays out the challenges the two firms faced in making sales, specifically, the British Government’s commitment to laissez-faire policies, prejudices within the British elite against those in trade, and departmental resistance to dealing with private firms. It then establishes the suite of strategies and tactics that the firms developed to overcome these obstacles to selling arms at home and abroad. Chapters 2–5 provide a chronology of the firms’ experiences of dealing with the British Government and the many peaks and troughs in that central relationship. Chapter 2 covers the Victorian era, when Armstrongs rose to prominence. Chapter 3 discusses the Edwardian era, which saw Vickers successfully challenging Armstrongs’ dominance. Chapter 4 examines the difficult interwar period when both firms struggled to survive, but Armstrongs failed. Chapter 5 charts Vickers-Armstrongs responses to the challenges of rearmament, World War Two and postwar nationalization. Part Two considers selling weapons abroad. Armstrongs and Vickers built surprisingly enduring relationships with recipient states over the century considered here. Chapters 6–8 are case studies of armament exports to Latin America, Asia and Turkey, respectively. These relationships endured despite royal successions, abrupt changes of leadership, coups and – importantly – changes in the strategic interests of the British state. To create and maintain 32\n\nLukes, Power.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nthose relationships, Armstrongs and Vickers developed a suite of independent foreign policy strategies and tactics, while always leading with their technologically sophisticated armament products. In each case, Armstrongs was the pioneer in the foreign market, but by the beginning of the twentieth century Vickers was a strong competitor and they often colluded against foreign firms. Chapter 9 returns to the conceptual framework laid out here to assess the domestic strategies and foreign policies of the two firms and reflect upon the power and independence that Armstrongs and Vickers exhibited in their relationships with the British state.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPART I Selling at Home\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1 Armstrongs and Vickers Become Armament Firms The Challenges They Faced and the Strategies They Developed The Industrial Revolution began in Europe and emanated outwards. A key feature of the era was the rapid pace and continuous cycle of military technological change. As David Stevenson recounted, in the century and a half prior to the 1840s naval and land armaments had scarcely changed, but from then on industrialization had a transformative effect on destructive capabilities.1 The technological and industrial capacities needed to manufacture modern weapons demanded major changes in the way that the British state procured weaponry, with the government turning to private firms to create armaments that had proved beyond their technological – and financial – capabilities and for wartime production surges.2 Innovations came especially fast in the naval sphere, with important and costly technological advances in gunnery, speed and torpedoes. Constantly improving seaborne artillery meant that ships needed ever heavier armor, leading to a dependence on private suppliers.3 As Lord George Hamilton noted, “After 1860 each subsequent decade outdid its predecessor in the improvements and development of power – so much so that fighting ships were almost obsolete before they had completed their first commission.”4 The Admiralty still led in ship design, but even here private firms created designs to catch the eye of the First Sea Lord and to sell abroad.5 Determined British entrepreneurs such as William Armstrong, Joseph Whitworth, William Beardmore, Charles Cammell, John Brown, Thomas Vickers and Albert Vickers – and the competition between them – propelled armament developments from 1855 onwards.6 An incentive for many entrepreneurs (except Armstrong) to begin armaments production was the intense\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nStevenson, Armaments, p. 15.

They are now discussed in turn.\n\nThe Armstrongs Origin Story William Armstrong’s shift into armaments manufacture has been recounted several times.8 He was “the son of a Cumberland yeoman and born in Newcastle in 1810.”9 Although Armstrong initially trained for the law, his heart was in engineering and in 1847 with friends he formed W. G. Armstrong & Co., with a site at Elswick, to manufacture his innovative hydraulic engines and cranes.10 The first ever hydraulic crane was installed at the Albert Dock in Liverpool in May 1848, earning the firm £1,000. That year, while the crane business was growing, the firm sought to diversify into locomotive production, but this was a failure.11 At the 1851 Great Exhibition, Armstrong demonstrated his hydraulic cranes and hydraulic engines (though it was the German firm Krupp’s sixpound cannon that won the gold medal).12 By the 1850s Armstrongs products were transforming docksides. In 1854, during the Crimean War, the War Office asked Armstrong to design a submarine mine capable of blowing up the Russian ships that had been sunk and were blocking Sevastopol harbor.13 This he did, and although the War Office did not deploy the mines, “what was important about the incident was that Armstrong had been taught to think about military matters, and had been provided with acquaintances in the War Office.”14 By November Armstrong was turning his mind to guns. As his longtime associate Stuart Rendel later recounted, William Armstrong’s real shift into armaments came out of a combination of problem solving and patriotism. Armstrong and James Rendel, Stuart’s father, were animated by newspaper accounts of the problems that British soldiers experienced in moving and firing guns at the 1854 Battle of Inkerman. James Rendel set Armstrong the task of designing a better gun, which Armstrong did quickly and with good effect. “[B]y the following month he had designed a gun on entirely new 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n\nGrant, Rulers, pp. 4–5.

The Armstrong Gun, utilizing a build-up method of construction, was trialed by a commission against models designed by others, including Joseph Whitworth (igniting a bitter rivalry). As the Secretary of War informed Parliament in 1859, “The Report of the Commission was that, after giving the fullest attention to the subject, they considered Sir William Armstrong’s invention superior to all others.” He explained: The great advantages of this gun were its extreme lightness, the extent of its range, and its accuracy. An Armstrong gun throwing a projectile of 18 lb. weighed one-third as much as the guns now in use discharging shot of that weight. The range of a 32 lb. gun, fired with a charge of 5 lb. of powder, was a little more than five miles and a quarter. … The precision of the gun was still more extraordinary than its range. The accuracy of the Armstrong gun at 3,000 yards was as seven to one compared with that of the common gun at 1,000 yards; while at 1,000 yards it would hit an object every time which was struck by the common guns only once in fifty-seven times; therefore, at equal distances, the Armstrong gun was fifty-seven times as accurate as our common artillery. Its destructive effect, also, exceeded anything which had hitherto been witnessed.19\n\nUnfortunately, the Crimean War was over before the War Office accepted the Armstrong Gun in 1859. With reports of the gun’s success, the Royal Navy requested “in the strongest manner” that the War Office supply them with a “large number” of 70- and 110-pounders.20 In 1859 Armstrongs’ 7-inch, 110pound, rifled breechloaders were fitted to the Isaac Watts designed HMS Warrior without having undergone naval trials. Ultimately the cast iron guns 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\nFairbairn, Elswick, p. 50; William Armstrong, “Report on the Construction of Wrought Iron Field Guns,” July 14, 1855. TNA, WO 33/11.

According to the firm’s historian, patriotism dominated Armstrong’s motives: He “had not patented his new inventions and furthermore he had declined the £20,000 reward which was offered him, so the Government took out patents in his name for the guns and their complete outfit, and by an Act of Parliament, withheld publication of the patents.”22 Marshall Bastable also sees Armstrong’s actions as an astute political move because “[i]n return he demanded a guarantee that the capital investment in the new company would not be lost if the government decided to build all the guns at Woolwich or contract them out to others.”23 In 1859 Armstrong was given a ten-year contract (backdated to April 1, 1856 so as to cover the expenses that he incurred in developing his gun) as Engineer for Rifled Ordnance to the War Office, a knighthood and an annual salary of £2,000, plus payment for the “draughtsmen employed by him” and his travel expenses. His contract specified he was to “give his best attention to the maturing and perfecting of his system of rifled ordnance.” It gave him “authority to direct the methods to be adopted and the conditions to be observed in the construction of such articles” at Woolwich Arsenal.24 As Bastable notes, in addition to training Army engineers to make his guns, Armstrong would use his position to “develop his build-up method for larger guns at government expense.”25 With Sir William in government service, his former associates in Newcastle formed a new department at Elswick, named The Elswick Ordnance Company, financed with public capital.26 The Partners … were Mr. Cruddas, Mr. Lambert and Mr. George Rendel, while the capital guaranteed by the Government was £50,000, afterwards increased to £85,000. The new Company engaged to work solely for the British Government, and their charges were to be checked by Government auditors … The beginning of this Company can be dated as January, 1859, the date of a formal agreement between the three above-mentioned partners and General Peel, Secretary of State for War.27 21 22 23 24\n\n25 26 27\n\nBastable, “Breechloaders,” p. 225; Armstrong testimony at the Select Committee on Ordnance, 1863.

This started a tradition of the firm’s management becoming members of that gentlemen’s club.32 Despite this handy connection to the elite, things were hard for Sir William: “[H]e was assailed by inventors over whom he had obtained preference.”33 There was continuing conflict with the indefatigable Whitworth, who complained that “to place him in office at the War Department was to prejudice the fair consideration of all new ideas not emanating from himself” and still refused to accept that Whitworth guns were inferior.34 Moreover, despite the appearance of advantage, Sir William’s experience of government service was frustrating because Woolwich Arsenal was outmoded and – like the War Office – was stacked with conservative figures hostile to innovation. There was also parliamentary concern that Armstrong was now the inspector of the guns made by his former partners at Elswick.35 Regardless, in three years Sir William had rebuilt Woolwich to independently manufacture Armstrong Guns, leading the government to terminate Elswick’s contract. Sir William returned to Newcastle and the new combined company of Sir W. G. Armstrong was formed. With the Armstrongs firm thus established, this chapter now turns to the birth of the firm that became its major rival, Vickers.\n\nThe Vickers Origin Story There are fewer published accounts of the origins of Vickers, partly because it is more a story of managerial competence, hard work and the search for profits 28 29\n\n30 31 32 33 34 35\n\nHouse of Commons, “Minutes of Evidence Taken Before the Select Committee on Ordnance,” July 2, 1862.

Anne was the daughter of George Naylor, who, along with his son William, was a partner in a local steel melting firm. William Naylor also independently had a rolling mill.38 In 1828 George Naylor and his new son-in-law, Edward Vickers, founded Messrs. Naylor, Vickers and Company, to produce steel for objects such as cutlery, tools and files, operating two works, the River Don works at Wadsley and the Sheffield Millsands works.39 Naylor Vickers had an agency in the United States selling steel products, where German émigré Ernst Benzon went to work and flourished.40 After George Naylor senior retired in 1829, Naylor, Hutchinson & Vickers was formed by his son George Portus Naylor, Edward Vickers and John Hutchinson. The firm operated the Millsands and River Don works, a file manufacturer in Orchard Street and a forge at Wadsley Bridge, and had representation in New York.41 Edward Vickers saw the potential of the railways for the nation, as new business for Naylor, Hutchinson & Vickers, and for improving the firm’s supply chain. During the 1830s he was involved in committees for the Sheffield and Manchester Railway, the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway, the North Midland Railway and the Doncaster, North Midland and Goole Railway.42 By the 1840s Edward was an established figure in Sheffield and was continuously active in local politics. Over time his political affiliations moved to the right, in parallel with those of most members of the Sheffield merchant and manufacturing class.43 He unsuccessfully stood for Alderman in 1843.44 Edward was the elected mayor of Sheffield in 1847–8 and the 1851 census recorded the merchant and steel manufacturer as being an Alderman and Borough Magistrate.45 Successive members of the family and managers of Vickers were members of the Sheffield Club, established in 1843, which “acted as a centre for information on political and financial developments 36\n\n37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45\n\nThe classic published accounts are Scott, Vickers and Trebilcock, Vickers Brothers.

In 1854 Edward Vickers was involved in the creation of a “Sheffield Exchange and News Room,” where the businessmen of the city could meet and receive their telegrams. On March 2, 1857 he became president of the new Sheffield Chamber of Commerce: “[I]ts aims were to further the interests of Sheffield trade, and to provide a conduit for effective lobbying of Government.”47 In the same year Edward supported a local Tory candidate and signed a petition in favor of the pro-trade government of the Whig Lord Palmerston and, as president of the Chamber of Commerce, personally presented it to the prime minister.48 Two of Edward Vickers’ sons, Thomas Edward (1833–1915) and Albert (1838–1919), finished their technical schooling in the 1840s with spells in Germany.49 Thomas studied in Neuwied-on-the-Rhine and Albert in Hameinon-the-Weser.50 In 1854 these talented young men joined the family firm. Thomas was an excellent metallurgist and engineer, who by the age of twentyeight had patents to his name.51 Albert was an effective manager and salesman for the firm. The firm was flourishing and in the mid-1850s Vickers brought German “melters” to Sheffield to introduce pioneering crucible processes for making complex steel castings, and by 1860 the firm was successfully producing steel bells, steel castings and steel railway tires.52 Thomas managed the Sheffield plants from about 1855, and Albert “spent a considerable portion of his life in the United States, representing the Firm.”53 It would be a further two decades before Vickers entered the armaments market. With our two firms now established, this chapter turns to the three main challenges that private firms faced in selling armaments to the British Government and around the world.\n\nChallenge One: Laissez-faire and Free Trade Policies When Armstrongs and Vickers emerged, the British Government was strongly committed to laissez-faire, the principle that governments should not control business, and to free trade. Consequently, the government would not help 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53\n\nWhite, Formation, pp. 36–37. White, Formation, pp. 204, 200. White, Formation, pp. 199, 204 and 209.

Firms were independent actors and sank or swam by their own efforts. The bastion of laissez-faire thinking within the government was the extremely powerful Treasury, though the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service also strongly upheld the doctrine. The Treasury exercised an iron grip on spending and had no qualms about disciplining a department that might want to stray from the approved line. The commitment to laissez-faire and free trade also empowered the government to give short shrift to the rights of firms. Firms were regarded as something to be used in the interests of the state. For example, in the early part of this era patents seem to have been ignored as often as they were acknowledged. This favored Armstrongs when it was accused of stealing the inventions of Theophilus Blakely. The government’s commitment to Armstrongs was absolute and it would not hear the patent complaint or allow competition, leading Blakely to leave Britain in 1863.54 In the 1880s the government’s commitment to laissez-faire was challenged by the Long Depression and resulting mass unemployment. Lord Salisbury appointed a Royal Commission to investigate the causes and consequences of the depression, at which Thomas Vickers appeared as a witness.55 However, the Commission’s eventual report did not stray from laissez-faire.56 The government also investigated Britain’s overseas trade, resulting in the “Bryce Memorandum” of July 17, 1886, designed to boost exports.57 James Bryce suggested “stimulating the interest of our present diplomatic and consular officers in commercial affairs and … giving them both a stronger motive and better facilities for activity in this department of their duties.”58 However, even after this political recognition that exports helped the state, the strong commitment to laissez-faire and free trade remained a “formidable” inhibitor to change within the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service.59 As a result, armament firms needed to conduct their own foreign policies.\n\nChallenge Two: Class Prejudices All firms faced a barrier to working with the government: class prejudice. As David McLean reported, in the 1880s there was a “social gulf which still divided the world of business and of British officialdom.”60 The resulting snobbery included distain for anyone who had to accumulate wealth through active 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\n\nBastable, Arms, p. 36.

Indeed, the term “trade” was used pejoratively. While social class was a barrier to trade generally, it was doubly so for “dirty” industries such as steel, armaments and warship production. Exacerbating this perception was the fact that many of the armament firms were begun by northern entrepreneurs in Newcastle, Glasgow, Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool, meaning that most had northern accents, another point counting against them for the southern elite that dominated government and the civil service.61 Nevertheless, different attitudes toward Armstrongs and Vickers can be detected in British Government documents and secondary materials spanning this period, with Armstrongs generally more favored. Armstrong had clear patriotic motives for becoming engaged in armaments production, and this was appreciated.62 His record of government service and his role as a prolific inventor all recommended him to the state. His support for local charities, his innovations at the home he built at Cragside, Northumberland, his connections to Liberal politics and his role in public life all increased his favor with Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales. Reflecting this burgeoning relationship with the elite was his elevation to a baronetcy in 1887. As J. D. Scott reports, Lord Armstrong “had the gift, so important in British public life, of not seeming to try too hard, and this contributed to the position which the Armstrong firm enjoyed of being something more than a commercial organization, something more like a national institution.”63 The subsequent elevation of Armstrongs’ Stuart Rendel to a peerage, the rotation of warship designers between the firm and the Admiralty (see Chapters 2 and 3) and the increasing prominence of the firm meant Armstrongs earned a degree of acceptance from government officials, enhanced by Sir William’s courtly manner in all his dealings with the state. By contrast, Vickers, while earning admiration for its industrial prowess and business savvy, was viewed differently. The firm built its reputation as an innovative steel and armament firm, not as an adjunct to the elite. The Vickers family did not build fancy houses or integrate into the British national elite.64 Although Vickers supported some local charities this was not done to the same extent or with the panache of Sir William or fellow steelmaker Mark Firth of Sheffield, so did not lead to royal attention or invitations to Court. 61\n\n62 63 64\n\nThe southern English aristocracy’s failure to compete with northern industrialists led those “gentlemanly capitalists” to focus on advancing imperialism. Cain and Hopkins, British Imperialism. Bastable, Arms, p. 109. Scott, Vickers, p. 89. Some fellow Sheffielders did pursue these routes: George Wostenholm built Kenwood House, Sir John Brown became a friend of Palmerston and Mark Firth hosted the Prince and Princess of Wales at Oakbrook in 1875 when they opened Firth Park to the public. Tweedale, Steel City, pp. 155–56 and 73; Wilson Middle-Class, p. 66.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009297516.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n26\n\npart I: selling at home\n\nThe Vickers family played roles in local society as members of the Sheffield Club, the Chamber of Commerce, the Cutlers’ Company and the Sheffield Exchange and News Room, all of which furthered their business interests and reflected their status as part of the local urban elite (or upper middle class). According to the Daily Telegraph, Albert “did not allow his energies to be frittered or his spirits to be disturbed by other pursuits: there were only two things in the world that interested him – his business and his shooting.”65 Albert Vickers’ excellent moorlands may have helped cement relations with important foreign customers, and shooting and hunting were also increasingly fashionable among British industrialists.66 Thomas Vickers was a local Justice of the Peace and a founder of the Hallamshire Rifles, in which by 1861 he and Albert were both Captains; the firm also provided Ensigns Natrop and Mitchell.67 Tom was made a Colonel in 1884 after twenty-five years of service.68 He was made a prestigious Sheffield Master Cutler in 1872. He and Albert were described by Scott as “very handsome men, and they had style. They were natural aristocrats, and looked it.”69 This may have been the perception in Yorkshire, but it did not carry to London. After the turn of the century more of Vickers’ management had been in government employment, but they tended to have been in technical, rather than political, positions. Locally Douglas Vickers was made a Master Cutler 1908 and was a Conservative Member of Parliament for Sheffield Hallam in 1918–22, though he “was one of the most silent” MPs.70 Overall, the family did not interact with the southern elite in the way that Armstrongs’ directors did. Moreover, the businessmen of Vickers were at least as interested in keeping strong connections with financiers and bankers as they were in building relations with the British Government.71 While the directors of the firm were patriotic, they were also strategic in that patriotism and government officials understood that. This perception of Vickers lingered late into the 1920s and the firm had to consistently strategize to overcome these prejudices.\n\nChallenge Three: Departmental Resistance The final challenge that armament firms faced in dealing with the British Government was the resistance of some departments. Bastable has perceptively 65 66\n\n67 68 69 70 71\n\nTweedale, Steel City, p. 143. Citing Daily Telegraph, July 16, 1919. Letter Book 12, May 16, 1904, January 4, 1910.

Interestingly, the initial relationship established between armament firms and a military service set up an enduring path dependency for future relationships, and there was considerable variation in paths between the services. From the first the relationship between Armstrongs and Vickers and the Admiralty was broadly positive – though not necessarily intimate – because armament firms were the only sources for resilient armor, heavy guns and mountings, and an increasingly important source for ships’ hulls and design personnel. As former First Naval Lord Sir Richard Hamilton made clear in 1896: “It is highly important … for the country that happy relations should be preserved with contractors. Upon this depends the ability to increase upon emergency our constructive means.”73 The Admiralty’s needs drove generally positive relationships, particularly with Armstrongs, who supplied it with a succession of directors of naval construction. Around the turn of the century “relations between Vickers and the Admiralty remained formal and cool. Vickers might have hoped for a more sympathetic attitude from the Board, but their representations of matters directly affecting them were often rejected; as were those of Armstrongs.”74 The Admiralty made a move early in the era designed to give itself more control over armament firms: It split all armor and ship contracts, even if the firm manufactured both, making delays “less easy to conceal than if they were hidden in the departments of one large firm.”75 This was frustrating to the major firms, who wanted to profit from whole deals. The distance the Admiralty sought from even key suppliers was justified, though, because the private firms had their own agendas; for example, Armstrongs and Vickers had a secret price fixing agreement between 1906 and 1913.76 Additionally, sometimes firms sought to manipulate the Admiralty: “Not all tenders were genuine, since firms would occasionally tender at absurdly high prices solely for the purpose of gaining insight into the latest Admiralty designs in order to make use of them in their work for foreign navies.”77 This was effectively espionage, the hallmark of an armament firm thinking as a completely independent actor. In turn, the Admiralty sometimes undertook its own espionage, calling for firms to submit designs, ostensibly for production, but in reality to ascertain what innovations 72 73 74 75 76 77\n\nBastable, Arms, p. 14.

Overall, working with the Admiralty was a reasonably constructive experience for armament firms. By contrast, as Armstrongs found, producing Army artillery was a tortuous affair. The War Office fundamentally wanted to use products from the Royal Arsenals and disliked having to deal with private firms. Moreover, the procurement system was staffed by “fiscally and technically conservative officers and officials.”79 A major feature of the system from 1855 was the Ordnance Select Committee, which was tasked with both developing weapons indigenously and evaluating armament firms’ gun designs, so “Woolwich was now in direct competition with the trade and yet had access to their secrets.”80 They were perfectly willing to harvest the best technologies from the private firms but unwilling to acknowledge ownership of these ideas or pay royalties. “The accusations made in the 1850s that the War Office stole designs from private inventors, were confirmed in the 1860s. After rejecting the designs of private inventors, the War Office and Admiralty coolly used them to build their own mix-and-match versions.”81 In response to these outrages, the armament firms eventually turned to politics and to the courts to gain redress. Moreover, “as Whitworth discovered in 1863–64, even a definitely superior product might not be accepted by procurement officials”.82 The relationship clearly posed dilemmas for firms: In putting forward design proposals to the War Office they risked them being stolen for the Arsenals, but the firms did not want to ignore potential sales opportunities. As Richard Davenport-Hines puts it: “Relations between these privileged manufacturers and their client were a strained mixture of wary collaboration and mutual exploitation.”83 The relationships the Admiralty and War Office’s air branches established with the emerging private aircraft producers shows path dependency from their existing relationships with armament firms. The Army controlled production, with the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough playing a dominant role in Army aircraft design and manufacture. Armstrongs and Vickers only produced for the Army using designs from the factory.84 For the Army, the 78\n\n79 80 81 82 83 84\n\nBetween 1859 and 1880 the Admiralty called for ship designs on five occasions. From all these competitions, the Admiralty approved only one design, and then reluctantly, the Lairds-built Captain designed by Cowper Coles, which unfortunately sank on her maiden voyage, taking her inventor with it.

By contrast, the Admiralty’s more positive view of private industry endured. Keith Hayward records: “The Admiralty … tended to look both to private industry and to the Royal Aircraft Factory for aircraft for the Royal Naval Air Service.”85 The challenges that Armstrongs and Vickers experienced with the services were only magnified in their dealings with the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic Service, which were institutionally disinclined to help firms trade internationally thanks to a difficult combination of ideology, snobbery and organizational culture. Their strong commitment to laissez-faire and free trade was a significant barrier to their providing any trade assistance. The most diplomats would do was to try and ensure equal treatment for British firms in foreign competitions and to speak out against the imposition of tariffs on imports. Of course, laissez-faire was also a convenient excuse for diplomats disinclined to act for firms. The Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service were bastions of snobbery. Martin Horn highlighted the Foreign Office’s “dominant aristocratic ethos,” which denigrated finance and trade.86 The Foreign Office recruited mainly from the upper classes. The 1914 Royal Commission on the Civil Service found that the Foreign Office was the second most expensive in the world – and the most snobbish. As late as 1919 half of the clerks on the Foreign Office list had been to Eton, though Sir John Tilley commented defensively that “the critics have been too ready to assume that the Service suffered in consequence.”87 Zara Steiner reported: “The Diplomatic Service, an entirely separate service, was even worse, more exclusive than the Foreign Office in social background and education. Diplomats spent almost all of their professional lives abroad, moved only in restricted social circles and took little or no interest in commercial affairs.”88 Until 1919, men without a minimum private income of £400 a year were barred from joining the Service. Candidates were also expected to know at least two languages, which generally meant having spent several years studying abroad, limiting the pool to the rich and well-connected. Diplomats were also expected to personally pay for any losses incurred on Diplomatic Allowances due to currency fluctuations. This was only changed, with some difficulty, during the Great War.89 Francis Hirst, editor of the Economist, gave a “violently critical account” of the Diplomatic Service in testimony before the 1914 Royal Commission, claiming that the “only commercial agents received at the Embassies abroad were the agents – normally aristocrats, ex-officers, or officials – of the great armament companies” and that other branches of trade were not afforded such Embassy 85 86 87 88 89\n\nHayward, British, p. 9.

The Foreign Office and the Diplomatic Service organizational cultures emphasized the practice of “high” politics, shunning commercial diplomacy. Substantive evidence of this had been gathered by Bryce and influenced his 1886 memorandum to Embassies.91 The Foreign Office delegated trade issues down to the Consular and Commercial Attaché Services and there was no sympathy between them; retired Consul-General Sir Roger Casement bemoaned that “nobody in the Foreign Office has ever been a consul, or knows anything about the duties of a consul.”92 The Consular Service provided retrospective compilations of trade statistics, which, Bryce had noted, were not produced sufficiently regularly and were likely out of date before they were published.93 The Service also avoided dealing with individuals or firms.94 Rather, the armament firms relied mainly on their own intelligence gathering and local networks in their search for sales and consistently complained that the governments of other countries – such as Italy, Germany and the United States – gave their armament firms much more help. It was not until the early twentieth century that “the Foreign Office was willing … to put traders in touch with possible markets by means of introductions through consular officials.”95 Intervention on behalf of individual firms therefore fell to the – extremely reluctant – Diplomatic Service. In 1907 Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey asked all British missions overseas to delegate one person to assist British businesses. This had little impact.96 David McLean has suggested that the Foreign Office operated on two levels during the nineteenth century, the “official” and the “unofficial,” arguing that while it was hard to move the Foreign Office officially, diplomats did more unofficially to aid British trade in China.97 There is some evidence of Armstrongs and Vickers getting some unofficial help, but usually the firms were completely autonomous. Prior to 1914 any government help abroad was unsystematic; it depended on the willingness of individual diplomats to informally act for firms and on the ability of the firms’ representatives to find those amenable diplomats. According to DavenportHines, “The relations of a company like Vickers with the Foreign Office were always those of a government supplier dealing with a department of its main 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97\n\nPlatt, Finance, p.

There was deference, and the Foreign Office always dictated the pace and direction of events.”98 After the turn of the century the “the ripples of government circled ever wider.”99 Now in addition to maintaining relations with the military services and the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service, the armament firms had to build relationships with a wider range of departments, including those in charge of factory inspections and taxation. This expansion of government involvement was somewhat eased for manufacturers by the growing presence of a new generation of civil servants, one drawn from a broader swath of British society and less susceptible to the class prejudices of their predecessors.\n\nArmament Firms’ Strategies and Tactics To deal with these perennial challenges and other issues that arose, Armstrongs and Vickers developed a suite of strategies and tactics.\n\nStrategy One: Building and Maintaining Relationships in Britain Cultivating relationships with the British state was vital for both firms. A benign – but ideally favorable – relationship with the British Government was necessary not only for facilitating domestic purchases and for official legitimation of their products, but also, once regulation of armaments exports began, for permission to sell abroad. Two types of relationships in Britain were important for armament firms. First, the relationships with elites, such as senior politicians, members of the aristocracy and the royal family; and second, the relationships with civil servants and the military, including the members of the services who oversaw trials and competitions, dealt with procurement and increasingly visited factories. These latter relationships were significant as civil servants held a lot of power in procurement decisions and their behavior toward armament firms early in the era reflected official distain for firms’ profits, patent rights and survival. Armstrongs excelled at elite relations. Vickers would have liked to pursue an elite strategy, but impermeable upper-class resistance and institutional snobbery initially made that impossible. Instead, they built relations with key civil servants and military officials. From their unique experiences the two firms developed the following appropriate tactics: Tactic 1: Relationship Enhancement through Interchanges of High-Level Personnel Armstrongs focused on developing relations with the elite, enhancing those relationships through a tactic of interchanging high-level personnel, particularly with the Admiralty. Chapters 2 and 3 show Armstrongs’ implementation of that strategy and Vickers’ attempts to emulate it. 98 99\n\nDavenport-Hines, “British,” p. 168.

Instead, Vickers tried to be useful as a substitute for being acceptable and sought to earn government respect by providing intelligence. Chapters 2–5 show this tactic in action.\n\nStrategy Two: Building and Maintaining Relationships with Elites in Other States Building relationships with elites in other countries was considered vital for securing foreign sales. Armstrongs and Vickers constantly conducted international diplomacy, aiming to build consistent relationships with foreign governments.100 They had to be attuned to shifting politics in buyer countries. Following local politics was particularly important in the coup-prone countries of South America (see Chapter 6), in China (Chapter 7) and in Turkey (Chapter 8), all places where politics could change fast. In international markets Armstrongs and Vickers needed extra tools to build these relationships, especially given international competition. Two tactics were normal practice and considered vital by Armstrongs and Vickers: Tactic 1: Using Agents for International Diplomacy The firms relied on agents to cultivate relationships with well-placed figures within foreign military and political establishments to gain consideration of their products. Successful “traveling ambassadors” for the firms were effective communicators; they were usually cosmopolitan by nature and credible to foreign governments thanks to either prior military service, technical expertise or connections. The firms also used lawyers who understood local laws – and the actual practices – in the countries where they were selling armaments.101 Tactic 2: Commissions and Bribery Providing bribes and commissions in markets where they were a normal part of business was routine for Armstrongs and Vickers.102 All types of firms paid bribes and commissions. These business methods looked unsavory from the vantage point of well-regulated democratic systems, and certainly damaged the reputation of Vickers-Armstrongs during the 1930s. However, the British Government never cut ties with the firms over bribery and in the case of Venezuela in 1950 endorsed Vickers-Armstrongs’ payment of bribes to the military junta (see Chapter 6). 100\n\n101 102\n\nKrupp of Germany had a similar strategy for exports, involving agencies, representatives, bribes and presents, “though their success was mostly limited. Like its British rivals, Krupp could thus neither create demand nor decisively influence governmental decisions about armament contracts.” Epkenhans, “Military-Industrial,” p. 17.

Ideally, Armstrongs wanted to keep Vickers out of the domestic market and limit the firm’s impact on the international market. However, that proved impossible. By the early twentieth century the two firms had pragmatically set aside many areas of competition and now worked together to try to exclude other firms from the domestic market. This strategy was in Armstrongs and Vickers’ interests but was directly opposed to those of the British Government, which wanted to keep the oligopoly loose, as competition kept prices down and encouraged innovation.\n\nStrategy Four: Cooperating and Colluding with Other Firms While Armstrongs and Vickers initially competed fiercely with each other and with other domestic and foreign firms, at times there was cooperation, and even collusion. While many of these secret alliances were domestic, some were international. Domestically, these alliances were usually to keep prices comparable (for example, for armor plate) and were regarded as a defensive strategy against British Government attempts to play firms off against each other in procurement competitions. In lean times, the arrangements sometimes included creating “rings” or “trusts” for setting high prices and splittin"
