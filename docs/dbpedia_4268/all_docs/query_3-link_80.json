The Order of the Bath is a British order of chivalry founded in 1725 by King George I. It originally involved elaborate medieval ceremonies for knighting individuals, including bathing as a symbol of purification. The Order consists of three classes - Knight/Dame Grand Cross, Knight/Dame Commander, and Companion. Members belong to either the Civil or Military Division. The Order of the Bath is the fourth most senior order of chivalry in Britain and is awarded for service to the Crown.",
