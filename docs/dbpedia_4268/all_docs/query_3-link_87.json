        "text": "The Most Honourable Order of the Bath (formally the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath) is a British order of chivalry founded by George I on 18 May 1725. The name derives from the elaborate medieval ceremony for appointing a knight, which involved bathing (as a symbol of purification) as one of its elements. The knights so created were known as \"Knights of the Bath\". George I \"erected the Knights of the Bath into a regular Military Order\". He did not (as is commonly believed) revive the Order of the Bath, since it had never previously existed as an Order, in the sense of a body of knights who were governed by a set of statutes and whose numbers were replenished when vacancies occurred.\n\nAs of 2020, the Order consists of the Sovereign (currently Queen Elizabeth II), the Great Master (currently Charles, Prince of Wales) and three Classes of members:\n\nKnight Grand Cross (GCB) or Dame Grand Cross (GCB)\n\nKnight Commander (KCB) or Dame Commander (DCB)\n\nCompanion (CB).\n\nMembers belong to either the Civil or the Military Division. Prior to 1815, the order had only a single class, Knight Companion (KB), which no longer exists. Recipients of the Order are now usually senior military officers or senior civil servants. Commonwealth citizens who are not subjects of the Queen and foreign nationals may be made Honorary Members."
