A great historical portrait print for a genealogy buff looking for family heritage or royalty type prints. This antique english portrait depicts Wentworth in a medieval renaissance era suit of armor. Thomas Wentworth, 1st earl of Strafford (1593 1641), English statesman. Regularly elected to Parliament from 1614 on, he became one of the critics of George Villiers, 1st duke of Buckingham, and of the war with Spain. Charles I made him sheriff of Yorkshire in order to exclude him from the Parliament of 1626, but Wentworth continued his opposition and was imprisoned (1627) for refusing to pay the forced loan. In the Parliament of 1628 he advocated a moderate version of the Petition of Right, but when Sir John Eliot and Sir Edward Coke succeeded in carrying their more severe form of the petition, he lost influence. At this point Charles sought his adherence by creating him baron and viscount and president of the council of the north (1628), and Wentworth realigned himself as a firm supporter of royal prerogative. With William Laud , Wentworth evolved the policy known as Thorough to achieve an absolutist but just and efficient regime. As lord deputy of Ireland (1632-40) he systematically applied this policy. He cleared the sea of pirates, bolstered trade and industry (always with an eye to England's interest), began a reorganization of the church in Ireland, and enforced reforms in financial administration that doubled the state's revenue. However, his methods were ruthlessly despotic, and he aroused even more fear and hatred. After Charles I's humiliation by the Scots in the first Bishops' War, Wentworth was recalled (1639) to England to become the king's chief adviser. Created earl of Strafford in 1640, he obtained money from the Irish Parliament to raise Irish troops to fight the Scots, but he was unable to get a similar grant of supplies from the Short Parliament (summoned on his advice) in England. An English army of sorts was mustered and placed under Strafford's command, but it was easily defeated by the Scots in a second war. When the Long Parliament assembled (1640), it suspected that Strafford had intended to use Irish troops against the king's English opponents (although in fact the Irish army had never materialized). Impeachment proceedings were begun, but Strafford defended himself so ably that the opposition changed its tactics and introduced a legislative enactment of guilt, a bill of attainder, against him. The bill was finally passed in the panic following the discovery of the so-called army plot, by which the king had hoped to rescue Strafford and dissolve the Parliament. After anguished hesitation, Charles signed the bill, and Strafford was beheaded. CONDITION: Very Good Condition.

In the 1770s he invested heavily in privateers working against the British, and sustained heavy losses; he later petitioned, unsuccessfully, the US Congress for redress in the form of land. In 1790 he fled the French Revolution for England, where he published a number of works, including some proposals for a French loyalist colony in Canada, and a History of Mauritius (1801). The present Receuil d'Essais (and verse) is very miscellaneous, covering the 'origin of things', universal peace, politics, fire, advice for émigrés, his proposed Canadian colony, &c. The subscribers' list at the end comprises mainly Scots, including Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo. ESTC shows five copies: BL, NLS; Boston Public, NYPL, and Queen's (Ontario). A second part, through with different printers and publishers, followed in 1794 (BL and NYPL only). The obstetrician James Hamilton, junior, joined his father Alexander Hamilton's practice at the age of twenty-one and eventual succeeded him in the chair of midwifery at Edinburgh University in 1800; a powerful and popular lecturer he nevertheless did not succeed in making midwifery a compulsory part of the curriculum until 1830. In 1792-3 both Hamilton and his father became embroiled in controversy after the publication of a pseudonymous Guide for Gentlemen studying Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, which highly praised the Hamiltons and denigrated their colleagues, notably Dr James Gregory (six copies in ESTC). Gregory alleged that Hamilton senior was actually the author, but when he was cleared by the Senate, Gregory turned his fire on the son. James Hamilton published some short letters in his defence early in 1793, to which Gregory gave a lengthy Answer to Dr. James Hamilton, Junior, laying out his reasons for believing 'J. Johnson' to be Hamilton; the present copy is a presentation copy to Sir William Forbes, as a man of influence in Edinburgh. Hamilton's own point-by-point confutation appeared in his Reply to Dr. Gregory a reply that angered Gregory so much he sought Hamilton out and thrashed him. Hamilton brought a suit and won damages of £100. Language: French."
