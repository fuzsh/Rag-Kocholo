This legislation came into force in 1980 and remained in force until the Constitution Act 1990. The President of the Legislative Council was elected from within the Legislative Council.\n\n1980 John Allen Cowell Kennedy Nivison CBE JP CP\n\n1987 Robert John Gurney Anderson\n\nBy virtue of the Constitution Act 1990 the role was amalgamated with that of the President of Tynwald.\n\nChairmen and Speakers of the House of Keys\n\nUntil 1867 the Speaker of the House of Keys was a role which only became vacant upon the death of the incumbent.

Ministers Act 1990[11] and the Interpretation Act 1976[12] had arisen and a Deputy Speaker, once elected to that position, would automatically vacate their departmental office.\n\nThe Presiding
