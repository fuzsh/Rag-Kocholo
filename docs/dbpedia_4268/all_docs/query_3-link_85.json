        "text": "Home health is a wide range of health care services that you can get in your home for an illness or injury. Home health care is usually less expensive, more convenient, and just as effective as care you get in a hospital or skilled nursing facility (SNF) .\n\nMedicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and/or Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) cover eligible home health services as long as you need part-time or intermittent skilled services and you’re “homebound,” which means:\n\nYou have trouble leaving your home without help (like using a cane, wheelchair, walker, or crutches; special transportation; or help from another person) because of an illness or injury.\n\nLeaving your home isn’t recommended because of your condition.\n\nYou’re normally unable to leave your home because it’s a major effort.\n\nCovered home health services include:\n\nMedically necessary part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care, like:\n\nWound care for pressure sores or a surgical wound\n\nPatient and caregiver education\n\nIntravenous or nutrition therapy\n\nInjections\n\nMonitoring serious illness and unstable health status\n\nPhysical therapy\n\nOccupational therapy\n\nSpeech-language pathology services\n\nMedical social services\n\nPart-time or intermittent home health aide care (only if you’re also getting skilled nursing care, physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, or occupational therapy at the same time), like:\n\nHelp with walking\n\nBathing or grooming\n\nChanging bed linens\n\nFeeding\n\nInjectable osteoporosis drugs for women\n\nDurable medical equipment\n\nMedical supplies for use at home\n\nDisposable negative pressure wound therapy devices\n\nA doctor or other health care provider (like a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant) must have a face-to-face visit with you before certifying that you need home health services. A doctor or other provider must order your care, and a Medicare-certified home health agency must provide it.\n\nIf your provider decides you need home health care, they should give you a list of agencies that serve your area. They must tell you if their organization has a financial interest in any agency listed.\n\nIn most cases, \"part-time or intermittent\" means you may be able to get skilled nursing care and home health aide services up to 8 hours a day (combined), for a maximum of 28 hours per week. You may be able to get more frequent care for a short time (less than 8 hours each day and no more than 35 hours each week) if your provider determines it's necessary.\n\nMedicare doesn't pay for:\n\n24-hour-a-day care at your home\n\nHome meal delivery\n\nHomemaker services (like shopping and cleaning) unrelated to your care plan\n\nCustodial or personal care that helps you with daily living activities (like bathing, dressing, or using the bathroom), when this is the only care you need\n\nYou won't qualify for the home health benefit if you need more than part-time or \"intermittent\" skilled care. You may leave home for medical treatment or short, infrequent absences for non-medical reasons, like attending religious services. You can still get home health care if you attend adult day care."
