The Lost World is a British TV movie produced by BBC released on 25 december 2001 starring Bob Hoskins as Professor Challenger. 145 minutes.

The movie is an adaptation of the Conan Doyle's novel: The Lost World (1912).

The movie is the most faithful adaptation of the original novel so far, with only a few differences:

Maple White is replaced by Luis Mendoza (1649).

More characters are added to the expedition, Agnes Cluny and Rev. Theo Kerr, to bring an opposition between theology and darwinism.

Rev. Theo Kerr destroys the bridge trunk (instead of Gomez).

Life with the indian natives is developed (not in the original story).

Lord Roxton fell in love with a native (Maree) and stayed on the Plateau.

Mr. Potts is renamed by Mr. Hare.

After his return to London, Challenger announced that The Lost World doesn't exist, to preserve it.
