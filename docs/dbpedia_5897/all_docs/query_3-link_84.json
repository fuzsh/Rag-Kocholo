        "text": "Hardy History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nFrance\n\nScotland\n\nFrom the historical and enchanting region of France emerged a multitude of notable family names, including that of the distinguished Hardy family. Originally, the people in this region went by one (personal) name. Surnames evolved during the Middle Ages when people began to assume an extra name to avoid confusion and to further identify themselves. These names then began to become \"fixed\" or hereditary between the generations. One of the types of names adopted as surnames were those derived from nicknames. Nicknames, or \"eke-names,\" were an added name that generally reflected some physical characteristics or other attribute of the person that used the name. The Hardy surname derives from the Old French word \"hardi,\" which came from the Germanic word \"hard,\" which meant \"strong\", and therefore was a nickname for a courageous or strong person.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Hardy family\n\nThe surname Hardy was first found in Guyenne, where the family was established in a village of Soustons, in Landes.\n\nThe members of this illustrious family also settled in other regions, where several of them distinguished themselves. Alexandre Hardy (1572-1632) was a playwright in Paris. Claude Hardy (1604-1678) was a mathematician. Sébastien Hardy, a financier in Paris, was married around 1650. Antoine-François Hardy, a deputy, was born in Caen in 1748 and died in Paris in 1823. He was also a doctor in Rouen. Félix Hardy (1762-1802), a brigade general, married Marie-Joseph-Louise-Galliste Huty de Brusnel in 1797.\n\nThe name was first found in Canada with Jean Hardy of Le Havre in the 17th century. 1 Jean, born in 1642, son of Pierre and Isabelle (née Mehoux), travelled from Normandy to Canada in the 17th century. After settling in Quebec he married Marie Poire, born in 1641, daughter of Toussaint and Catherine (née Chatou), at Pointe-aux-Trembles on 21st October 1669. 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Hardy family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Hardy research.

By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 20\n\nHardy Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMr. Robert Hardy, (b. 1617), aged 18, British settler travelling from London, England aboard the ship \"Alexander\" arriving in Barbados in 1635 21\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Hardy (post 1700) +\n\nThomas Hardy (1840-1928), English novelist, short story writer, and poet of the naturalist movement\n\nFrançoise Madeleine Hardy (1944-2024), French singer-songwriter and actress\n\nFrancis Hardy (1923-2021), French politician, Deputy in the French National Assembly (1973-1981), (1986-1988)\n\nJean Hardy, French Divisional General during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars from 1789 to 1815 22\n\nLinda Lucas Hardy (b. 1973), French actress and model\n\nMichael Hardy (1955-2024), American civil rights lawyer and confidant, best known for having defended Rev.
