        "text": "Since the 1961 film “The Parent Trap” with Hayley Mills, we’ve come a long way in depicting one person playing twins on screen. Or have we? Digital technology now allows for much more elaborate depictions of the screen double, but even the latest films still rely on some simple visual sleights of hand.\n\n“Legend,” the new film from Brian Helgeland (opening Friday, Nov. 20), depicts the life of the identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, notorious in the London crime scene of the 1960s. Rather than casting similar-looking actors or real-life twins, the film has Tom Hardy playing both brothers.\n\n“I was a little leery of it at first,” Mr. Helgeland said in September during an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival. “There’s a tradition of casting one actor to play twins in movies, but usually in those movies, I just can’t get into it. I keep looking at it and not thinking about the movie.”\n\nBut Mr. Helgeland was persuaded by the fact that the Krays’ physical characteristics and mannerisms were different enough to tell them apart. Mr. Hardy’s approach to each brother is so distinct that it feels like two actors playing the roles.\n\nThe film employs tricks both classic (the split screen) and contemporary to show the characters in the same shot. In “The Parent Trap,” the split-screen method involved locking the camera down in a fixed spot and shooting the scene twice with Ms. Mills in one spot and an actress double in another. The filmmakers would then shoot the image to appear on the other half of the screen, with the positions of the two reversed. The film would be processed in an optical printer, first exposing the left side of the frame with a matte over the right side; then that same film would be run through again, now exposing the right side. The splits in the center would be hidden by background elements in the shot, like a door frame.\n\nToday’s software eliminates the need for those cover-ups, but a camera shot that stays consistent from take to take is still essential. In “Legend,” when the camera needed to follow the characters, it would be motion-controlled, a process in which a computerized camera’s movement is programmed in advance, enabling its path to be repeated exactly. That made the process of adding doubles to the frame much smoother.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
