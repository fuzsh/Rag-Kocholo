        "text": "Movies Novels Games\n\nDr. Sarah Harding is an animal behaviorist who specialized in animal behavior which also included the dinosaurs. In both canons, she joined the Research Team led by Ian Malcolm, with whom she has a relationship in the film, to Isla Sorna.\n\nWhile she is confirmed to be the daughter of Dr. Gerry Harding in the film canon, and has a half sister named Jessica Harding, both of whom were involved in the Jurassic Park Incident and its aftermath, her relationship with Gerry Harding is only implied in The Lost World.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Lost World: Jurassic Park[]\n\nIn The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Sarah joined a small team of researchers on Isla Sorna on John Hammond's request. She displayed an array of knowledge in both living animals, having researched at the San Diego Zoo, and dinosaurs, understanding the anatomy of the leg muscles of the infant Tyrannosaur she successfully treated. She was joined later in the expedition by Ian Malcolm, with whom she had an ongoing relationship, and his other team members as soon as they could. Despite their rivalry, she endured Burke's behavior and even tried to save Burke when he was panicked into the Tyrannosaur's mouth after he saw a snake slithering into his shirt. The Tyrannosaurs stalked the group for a time, because Harding's jacket was covered in blood from when her and Nick Van Owen set the infant's leg. She and Malcolm survive the expedition.\n\nShe was also present at the San Diego Incident and tranquilized the male adult Tyrannosaur before it could be killed by large animal control. She was last shown in the film asleep with Malcolm on his couch while Hammond commented on the Incident on television.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nSarah has generally been portrayed as an intelligent and adventurous character with a free spirit and a strong sense of independence. She has repeatedly shown no fear of wandering into the habitats of animals and dinosaurs alone and interacting with them directly, and has also been shown to be willing to stand up for her beliefs, as shown in the film by her insistence to Robert Burke that Tyrannosaurs do not abandon their young. Despite of that, Sarah can sometimes be a bona fide ingrate of a woman, as seen when she told Ian to shut up after he came to warn them about the paired rexes coming for their young, when she and Nick were responsible for the parenting dinosaurs coming for them in the first place.\n\nIn both versions of the character, she is dependable and capable as well as very compassionate, heroically rescuing other characters and trying to ensure their safety, only endangering the lives of her human companions when trying to help the life of an animal, such as when she assisted the baby Tyrannosaur's injury. In the film, her most notable achievement was tranquilizing a bull Tyrannosaurus in San Diego before the Animal Control unit could kill it, ensuring the Tyrannosaur family's survival.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn the film, particularly in her introductory sequence, Sarah Harding exhibits traits from the character Richard Levine, who was removed from the film.\n\nClaire Dearing of the Jurassic World Trilogy bares several similarities to Sarah Harding as a character:\n\nBoth are redheaded women who work with and try and save dinosaurs from antagonistic or malicious groups\n\nBoth primarily wear primarily green clothes (trousers and tops plus jungle-suited boots).\n\nBoth characters' surnames end in \"ing\".\n\nShe went looking for Malcolm at a hospital in Costa Rica after he was injured in the Isla Nublar incident in 1993.[1]\n\nDr. Frances White from the comics Jurassic Park: Dangerous Games also bears a resemblance and role to Sarah Harding.\n\nSarah's status after The Lost World: Jurassic Park is unknown as she is neither seen nor mentioned in Jurassic World: Dominion. However, Ian Malcolm mentions that he now has five children which is two more than he was stated to have in Jurassic Park, suggesting that he had further children with Sarah or someone else following his adventures on Isla Sorna.\n\nAlthough not considered a human antagonist, her actions on Isla Sorna and San Diego indirectly resulted in the deaths of multiple people, on the island, S.S. Venture, and San Diego. Therefore, she's considered one of the most controversial protagonists of the franchise.\n\nReferences[]"
