Taylor claims, the Great War ‘cut deep into the consciousness of modern man’ (1966: 11). The guns fell silent on the Western Front in November 1918, but the memories have neither died nor faded away. As the worldwide commemorations for the centenary of the First World War unfold, the massive outpouring of print, television and film responses seems to be increasingly on the rise. The centenary has in fact provided an opportunity to continue reflecting on the magnitude of a conflict that profoundly moulded the course of the twentieth century and, in all probability, of the decades to come. However, while the effects of the war on society and politics are more noticeable; its presence in literature and culture is much more intangible and complex to analyse. Far from being eclipsed in memory by succeeding wars, the war to end all wars maintains a tenacious hold on popular imagination, being repeatedly thought over and transformed in the minds of those born long after the 1918 Armistice. Indeed, this war has become many things to many people: the end of the long nineteenth century; the painful birth pangs of a new world order; the nightmarish consolidation of Modernism; a full dress rehearsal for the killing fields of the twentieth century. Among the manifold aspects of the conflict was the demise of a relationship that had been vitally necessary to most warlike undertakings up to that time (mercenaries apart), which is that shared between the combatants themselves and their mother country or culture. For many soldiers in the Great War, this relationship went desperately awry, to the extent that—for them—the true enemy was not the one sniping at them from the opposing trenches but instead the society that sent them there in the first place, and from which they had become cut off, alienated and estranged. The need to explain and articulate the meaning of this experience has opened up a territory of dispute and negotiation, encouraging the study of war as a multifaceted phenomenon whose complexity resists easy classification. Writing about it is not only a way to retain rational human control over one of the greatest calamities to befall Western civilization, but also the means through which destruction can be turned into constructive channels by verbalising, organising and transforming the resources of meaning available to men. Philip Larkin famously refers to a halcyon period of calm that preceded the war and that was irretrievably lost when conflict broke out; never such innocence again was his melancholic summing up of the world that vanished into\n\n© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi 10.1163/9789004314924_002\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nchaos and destruction. Our collection of essays1 borrows from Larkin’s idea of lost social innocence and applies it to the disenchantment of the soldiers, whose innocent faith and loyalty to Home is shattered by the cataclysmic events of war. Through the prism of the literature produced or otherwise pressed into service at the time (by which we also mean those periods that are immediately previous and subsequent to the war), we trace—on the one hand—what is effectively the gradual disassociation of these soldiers from their society and from its values, demands and aspirations, and—on the other—the means by which the home culture attempted to (re)claim its sons and consolidate their loyalty and belief in the cause for which they were fighting. However, whilst this dichotomy is central to our analysis, we also incorporate into our discussion recent critical challenges to the assumption that the truth about the war stems from the testimony of the canonical soldier poets and thus gives space to other voices such as women—traditionally excluded in such accounts—and the Home Front. Although closer readings of these sources result in conclusions that defy easy categorisation and that often transcend the conventional framework of understanding that forwards a conformity or dissonance interpretation, this collection nevertheless points to what is, in effect, a discourse of two very distinct narratives. One of these is largely of inducement and compliance, reflecting not only the toils to sustain and promote the celebration of war as adventure and noble sacrifice, but also employing a manly rhetoric of character and heroic transcendence, with its values and eloquence, as a way of encouraging the continued allegiance both of soldiers and civilians. Although tracing any significant path leading directly from Homer to Great War narratives would be much too ambitious for the scope of this work, there is evidence to show that the epic and romance traditions do form the basis upon which the language of persuasion was built. Such heroic and romantic representations offered a patriotic interpretation of the war that was passed on to Victorian society and kept on rising in popularity as the nineteenth century progressed, even withstanding the impact of modern warfare. This militarist mystique had lingered in the minds of those who felt that, in Hibberd’s words, they ‘had to speak for the nation and steel its heart for battle’ (1987: 12). The survival of the exciting images of war, and of patriotic sentiment that the language of conformity aroused, suggests that perhaps idealism did not perish at the Somme, or that maybe some of the responses to the Great War simply failed to capture the reality of the trenches and the disappointment and isolation that many soldiers felt. 1 As our title indicates, we have restricted ourselves for reasons of scope and length primarily to a consideration of British writing. Nevertheless, see Chapters 3, 8, 10, 11 and 15 for discussion of non-British perspectives.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nThis need to set the record straight takes us to the narrative of dissonance and autonomy, which not only attempts to portray life in the trenches without any trace of patriotic sentiment, casting aside ‘the generals and the plumes, the high abstractions, the images of heroism and glory that made war itself a valueterm’ (Hynes 1992: 166), but emphasising the shattering of identity with place, with culture, with family that the combatants came to feel. Cynicism and anger inexorably replace the patriotic fervour of conformity. This dissonant, realistic approach to war revolves around the ethos of Owen’s Dulce Et Decorum Est and ‘the pity of War’ (Owen 1921: ix) and around the idea of a split between ‘first of all a naïve enthusiasm for war and then, after the shock of battle experience, an overwhelming sense of disillusion, anger and pity, culminating in pacifism and protest’ (Rutherford 1978: 65). Although its roots lie in the events and opinions surrounding the war, the narrative grew with time, incorporating throughout these years what is meaningful and functional to its beliefs and becoming ‘a sacred national text’ (Motion 2004: xi), ‘the story of war that has evolved, and has come to be accepted as true’ (Hynes: 1992 ix). The clear gap between past and present, between combatant and civilian, between the older generations and the youth that fought the war, has reopened the debate around the representation of war. In this context, the literature of disillusionment has destabilised the dominant heroic discourse and has operated as a counter-text, in this way becoming a centrifugal force. Though clearly separated from one another, however, these two dominant narratives cannot be described as entirely oppositional as they tend to transgress their representational borders to converge and evoke similar, or even overlapping, responses to war. Charged with the task of making sense of the experience, literary representations of the Great War acknowledge considerable ambivalence towards the possibility, if not the actual appropriateness, of reproducing the reality of the trenches and the view taken from the Home Front in its entirety, not only because of its elusiveness but also because of the influence of prevailing cultural discourses on personal interpretations. Despite the difficulties encountered, however, the main urge, both for writers and literary scholars, has been to tell the truth, to set the record straight. Yet the endorsement of truth has not excluded imagination as the mediator between the seen and the unseen, shaping and moulding the reality of war into something new, examined from a spatial and temporal distance and from different angles. And so the re-writing of war has revealed the difficulty of representing war but, at the same time, has also confirmed the power of men to ascribe meaning and pattern to this experience, even when that experience has continuously resisted patterning. Much has been written on the connection between war and its literary representations. During the 1960s and 1970s, the literature of disillusionment became most relevant to the academy, which primarily focused on the lyric\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\npoetry of British soldiers; autobiography was relegated to the role of secondary genre, while fiction occupied third place, again with the predominance of the war poets’ voices. The language of dissonance was a key constituent for the opening text of this wave of literary criticism. In Bergonzi’s Heroes’ Twilight (1965) the disillusion of the combatants and their social dismemberment is given a privileged position. Paul Fussell’s The Great War and Modern Memory (1975) not only reinforces Bergonzi’s view but moves forward, setting the agenda for most of the criticism that followed it. Fussell claims ‘that there seems to be one dominating form of modern understanding; that it is essentially ironic; and that it originates largely in the application of mind and memory to the events of the Great War’ (1981: 35). Although Fussell’s work has become a signpost in Great War criticism (from The Great War and Modern Memory onwards, literary studies of war would revolve around gender issues and the complex relationship between war and modernism), later research has refuted the idea that those modern modes of expression that did not seem to fit within previous categories resulted from the Great War. The resurgence of interest in the Great War by more current scholarship demonstrates that the process of interpretation has continued uninterrupted over the past years. As Hibberd suggests, ‘no sooner has one critical approach to it become established than revisions, refutations and new information start to appear and another cycle begins’ (1996: n.p.). In one fashion or another, Rutherford, Bracco, Dawson, Winter, Bond and McLoughlin, among other scholars, have challenged Bergonzi and Fussell’s interpretations in an attempt to come to terms with the multi-layered impact of the Great War. Rutherford adopts a suitable middle ground between the literature of persuasion and more realistic accounts, focusing on those authors ‘who at their best take full account of the complicated, contradictory nature of adult experience— who eschew ethical and psychological simplicities—but who none the less choose to treat heroic themes and reinvestigate heroic values’ (Rutherford 1978: 10). Bracco’s Merchants of Hope (1993) points to the continuity with the pre-war world as reflected in middlebrow fiction in the commemoration of heroism and of England as a great nation and in the reverence for the sacrifice and suffering undergone by their men. Similarly, Dawson explores the endurance of war celebratory traditions and perceives the First World War as clear evidence of ‘an ongoing tension between adventurous and “anti-adventurous” modes of narrative’ (Dawson 1994: 171). Far from underestimating the classical, romantic and religious themes of the past, Winter’s Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning (1995) argues that in their search for consolation, bereaved mourners prompted a revival of traditional modes of aesthetic expression that had been prematurely buried by the war: ‘“seeing” the war meant more a return to older patterns and\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nthemes than the creation of new ones’ (7). His work, Remembering War: The Great War between Memory and History in the Twentieth Century (2006), on the other hand, focuses more specifically on memory, on the ways the Great War has been remembered, and argues that the memory boom of the Second World War and the Holocaust draws its inspiration from the trauma of the Great War. Particular attention is given to the battle between the way the past is interpreted by historians and by those who were at the front and felt the need to testify. From a historian’s standpoint, Brian Bond’s ‘British “Anti-War” Writers and their Critics’ (1996), The Unquiet Western Front: Britain’s Role in Literature and History (2002) and Survivors of a Kind: Memoirs of the Western Front (2008) are concerned with overturning dissonant narratives by filling the gaps, correcting errors and overcoming prejudices and historical misinterpretations. Bond illustrates a dilemma that is presented to most historians: to what extent can literary representation enter the realm of history if most responses to the Great War prove to be more a product of the time in which they were written than an accurate reflection of the times they claim to record. Bond’s position seems clear. He is not only interested in rectifying discrepancies, but in eradicating disillusioned interpretations of war. Concerned with the idea of authoring war memories, McLoughlin suggests that war ‘resists depiction, and does so in multifarious ways’ (2011: 6–7). Moreover, she argues ‘that accounts of war are always authored’ and that ‘the gap between the experience and the representation of conflict can be narrowed but never completely eliminated’ (2011: 20). The work of these scholars has shown that there is still ample research material available for examining the questions raised by the conflict. And this current volume is obviously not remotely intended as any sort of final word or judgement on Great War narratives; nevertheless, it is meant to counter some of the final words that have been offered. This collection works towards focussing on the myriad faces of war with the aim of achieving a better understanding of the essential continuities, transformations and mutual dependence between persuasive and dissonant narratives, partly by proposing new frameworks of interpretation, and partly by exploring the broader implications of the critical work outlined above. Our study is an engagingly new approach to First World War literary studies in that, beyond a thorough evaluation of the discrepant discourses that we have already discussed, it uses this evaluation; first, to suggest that the state-soldier dichotomy is not as absolute or solid as is often suggested and that the reality is far less conveniently categorisable; second, that there is, in fact, a simultaneous and predictive validity to these alternative discourses, and that both of them in their own ways and for their own purposes conceal and reveal truths.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nOur study therefore dramatizes a leap in war representations that should be addressed by further critical research and new textual evidence, rather than compelling a hasty selection of or serious dependence upon either the dissonant or the persuasive approaches. Ultimately, this collection expands on the work carried out on war literature to date, by proposing that there is no explicit literary language that can be regarded as the language of the Great War or can ever hope to represent it in its entirety, and that the complexity of responses to such a disturbingly multiple experience points to the need to acknowledge the relevance of individual testimonies over dominant perceptions. Through emphasis on the variety and complexity of Great War narratives and on the idea that an understanding of the Great War requires the fuller appreciation of its literary representations, this collection brings together the contributions of literary scholars working in the area of war representations, their production and reception, their circulation and, in the case of canonical texts, the causes and effects of their wide legitimation. But, as Professor Christopher Clark—one of Britain’s foremost specialists in the study of the Great War—has said of such revisionism, ‘[t]his doesn’t mean embracing a vulgar presentism that remakes the past to meet the needs of the present. Rather, it means acknowledging those features of the past where our changed vantage point can afford us a clearer view’ (2013: 3). The chapters in the collection revolve around a core framework of concerns designated by their section headings. Part 1, ‘Reasserting Tradition: The Solace of the Familiar’ focuses on the ways in which British soldiers and civilians coped emotionally with the terrible losses caused by the war. The two chapters contained in this section suggest that the traditional and the familiar were still ideally powerful during the war, functioning as positive images to set against the fragmenting and undermining effects of Great War anxieties. In Chapter 1, Bill Phillips adds significantly to the collection’s consideration of the uncertainty resulting from the vanishing of the signposts and the blurring of the boundaries of dominant war discourses. Explicitly focusing on how the death of his son at the front affected Kipling’s response to the Great War, Phillips suggests that the writer seeks refuge in the ideal of brotherhood that freemasonry provided in an attempt to preserve the continuity of his conformity to imperial and romantic notions but inevitably deflects it in a new direction. In Phillips’ view, an overt misogynistic approach to female characters, also shared by some of the most consistent anti-war writers, brings Kipling’s war trauma to the domestic space and to the perverse fantasies that took hold of popular imagination after the war ended. In his reading of Austen’s novels as part of the recuperative therapy that shellshocked soldiers were given at the Home Front, David Owen (Chapter 2) assesses\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nnot only the ways in which Austen’s tranquil world might have appealed to traumatised combatants, bringing them a much-needed reminder of calm, order and decency, but the underlying ideas that may have led hospital specialists to recommend this non-canonical writer to mentally wounded soldiers. Moreover, Owen further explores the ways in which the military authorities and government at home used the sentiments and ideals of pre-war England portrayed in Austen’s novels as propaganda to reinforce the legitimacy of their war aims and ‘strengthen’ the soldiers’ commitment to the war effort. Part 2, ‘Quiet Desperation: Returning Home to Another War’ focuses on the immediate aftermath of the Great War as a crucial period in the redefinition of gender roles and as an endless source of anxieties for both returning soldiers and nurses. In Chapter 3, Donna Coates explores the aftermaths of war through a detailed reading of the novel Tell (2014), by Canadian writer Frances Itani. Coates engages with the return of a physically and mentally traumatised soldier and with the situations of anxiety regarding the soldier’s adjustment to his old life and to the relationship with his wife at home. The chapter looks at the powerful ways in which the conspiracy of silence that surrounded the experience of war after 1918 made it difficult not only for people on the Home Front to discuss the war but also for survivors to integrate this with the rest of their lives. Coates argues that male bonding among veterans and the reconnection with the land and with the community at home play a significant role in survivors’ attempts to break the silence, to mourn their losses and to prevent the annexation of war memories from recollection. This section is also intended to discuss how women’s writings during and after the conflict portray the traumatic effects and transformative potential of the return to the domestic harmony that had been destabilised during the war by the masculinisation of the home front and the feminisation of the battlefield. Such gender-related effects and transformations are the subject of Laurie Kaplan’s chapter (Chapter 4), which examines the ways in which British and American women writers dramatise the contrast between the excitement of hospital war work abroad and the idleness of enforced demobilisation for nurses, vads, and ambulance drivers after the war ended. Having proved their capabilities and intelligence, and having faced danger and loss as they fulfilled their duties, women return from war service to find that their skills count less than the ability to be ‘womanly’. Kaplan analyses some of tropes in the selected texts as vehicles for the exploration of new ideas about female gender roles, which are often removed from the conventional marriage-children-home triad that dominated society’s recommendations for women at the end of the war. Part 3, ‘The Great War in Words: Telling the Untellable’, confronts the representational crisis that resulted from the experience of modern warfare. The\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nthree writers examined here, Lewis Grassic Gibbon, Patrick MacGill and Ford Madox Ford, point to the difficulty of representing what seems to be unrepresentable by traditional literary means but, at the same time, the writers feel the need to be truthful in their depiction of the war and to reflect what was seen as a radical sense of discontinuity with the literary past. The consideration of narrative strategies, as crucial means for examining war representations, is evident in Andrew Monnickendam’s chapter (Chapter 5). He reads Gibbon’s Sunset Song (1932) as a remarkable hybrid: a combination of the historical novel and stream of consciousness. Unlike the scholarship that has focused almost exclusively on the writer’s ambivalent attitude towards nationalism and gender, added to his espousal to socialism, Monnickendam discusses Gibbon’s handling of the Great War both as a catalyst of or metaphor for class war or gender war but also as a defining factor of Scottish life and literature. His framework of analysis revolves around the final section of the novel, in which war is not simply a trope but the field of action both in presence, in the fate of its characters, and in absence, in the scenario of the wealthier than-ever home front, made prosperous by the war that simultaneously threatens the lives of its inhabitants. Brian Dillon (Chapter 6) addresses Patrick MacGill’s war trilogy as an exponent of the anti-dissent narratives published while the Great War was unfolding and illustrates how fundamentally unstable and contingent narratives can become when making sense of the war. Dillon argues that despite the fascinating details and vivid set pieces MacGill incorporates in his war texts, there are also frustrating omissions for readers whose comprehension of the war is filtered through the canonical war writers published after 1918. Weak closures to episodes, religious references and peculiar responses to death might reveal MacGill’s unwillingness to engage in meaningful reflection on the role religion may play in the irrational violence he records or to envision a post-war existence. Based precisely on these insights, Dillon’s chapter focuses on the ways these interpretative gaps can be bridged and overcome. The need to understand the connection between war memories and their representation is also highlighted by Cristina Pividori (Chapter 7). Drawing on trauma-based literary readings, she focuses on Ford Madox Ford’s quasiautobiographical tetralogy Parade’s End (1924–1928) to examine what writing as remembering might entail in terms of the choice of literary forms. Pividori claims that, as a first-person witness, Ford makes efforts to reflect adequately what the war meant to him; yet he acknowledges the existence of a gap in his experience that cannot be readily accessible through language or conscious thought. The chapter then builds around Ford’s failure to encounter the reality of the Great War in all its traumatic complexity and around his reliance on\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nliterary impressionism as the means through which a number of conflicting voices representing his experience in the trenches strive to find expression against the mandates of the dominant dissenting and persuasive forms. Part 4, ‘Between Happy Warrior and Bitter Pacifist’, discusses texts both fictional and poetic that are not completely or clearly dissonant or persuasive in their responses to the war. They adopt ambiguous attitudes, combining messages that condemn the alienation and waste of war but that also voice a reassertion of heroic ideals in the face of the destruction not only of life, but of values and beliefs. The assumption that some elements of dissonance and persuasion can be traced in Canadian works has inspired Monique Dumontet’s chapter (Chapter 8). Based on the notion of the cultural continuity of the myth of sacrifice in Vance’s Death so Noble (1998), Dumontet examines Philip Child’s novel God’s Sparrows (1937) as a representative example of Canadian combatant narratives of the Great War located in the middle ground between tales of the happy battalion and the Old Lie. She claims that God’s Sparrows achieves a more balanced and more inclusive portrait of the war not only by valorising multiple perspectives, including those from the home front as well as the battlefront, and various attitudes towards the war, including pacifism, jingoism, spiritualism, and existentialism, but also by evoking and affirming historical and social continuity. In a similar vein, Andrew Palmer’s chapter (Chapter 9) explores the forcefulness—or avoidance—of rhetorical strategies employed by war poets in their attempt to capture the experience of war either through persuasive or dissonant arguments. The discussion develops around the idea that the strongest poetry of the war problematises the terms of that debate, offering ambiguity, nuance and contradiction in a mode that is specifically poetic. Palmer firstly explores the ways in which some poems, apparently written in support of the war, can be read as performances in which the speaker attempts to persuade himself of the rightness of the war while simultaneously undermining the argument. Secondly, he focuses on poems that are rarely anthologised, drawing attention to the ways in which they resist the discourses of persuasion and dissonance. Adding to this collection’s interest in studying war representations is the fact that the Great War has also shaped, and in its constantly evolving representations continues to shape, the identities of other nations and communities. The chapters in Part 5, ‘The Subaltern Speaks’, share the emphasis on voices from former colonies and different racial and ethnic groups that made themselves heard against the dominant European narratives, bringing attention not only to the world character of the war but to the shaping of their national identities. Aspects of subalternity are focused on in Esther Pujolràs’\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nchapter (Chapter 10), particularly those connected with the involvement of East Africa in the Great War and with the shaping of its national narratives in their explicit and/or implicit deconstruction of colonial affiliations. Pujolràs discusses Abdulrazak Gurnah’s Paradise (1994) and Vassanji’s The Gunny Sack (1989) and The Book of Secrets (1994) as deflected narratives of war in which the colonial home is contained in forms of bullying imperial practice and of a desire to refashion space into a home liberated from British and German allegiances. The chapter contends that, in the same way that the Scramble for Africa foreshadowed the First World War, the state of irretrievable homelessness that the war created among East African people prefigured the upcoming struggles for independence. Drawing on the Jamaican experience, Richard Smith (Chapter 11) illustrates how different interpretations of the Great War became intertwined with the collective memory of the nation itself. On the one hand, the chapter addresses pro-imperial feeling, particularly among the lighter-skinned middle class, who comprised the core readership of the two most popular newspapers (the weekly Jamaica Times and The Daily Gleaner) and who sensed loyalty would produce enhanced status post war. On the other, it analyses the discordant voices of writers influenced by millenarian traditions, who voiced opposition to the war for the impact it had on the Jamaican population or who believed the war marked the end times of the British Empire. However, Smith argues that these divergent attitudes were ultimately connected through the anticipation of post-war redemption; whether a more equitable imperial relationship, a millennial heaven on earth or Jamaican national independence. Part 6, ‘The Soldier and the Other’ turns to male relational patterns as a key element in the representation of masculinities at war. By examining the soldiers’ attitudes towards the figure of the friend and the father, these chapters outline the development of male bonding as a complex phenomenon, tracing the ways in which hegemonic masculinity governed and restricted male relationships at the war front. Although literary representations of the experiences of combatants and non-combatants have, in recent years, received a great deal of critical attention, Silvia Mergenthal’s chapter (Chapter 12) reassesses a highly complex as well as controversial issue: the notion that the generation of 1914 was a generation of young men who, both during the war and in its aftermath, had been deceived, betrayed, and abandoned by their elders. Mergenthal discusses H. G. Wells’s novel Mr Britling Sees It Through (1916) as an early fictional engagement with the discourse of negative paternity, a discourse that will subsequently become a prominent feature of First World War literature. The chapter not only explores the impact of the First World War on the British Home Front as refracted in the changing attitudes to the war of\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nWells’ middle-aged, middle-class protagonist, but also suggests that the boundaries between home front and war front are anything but impermeable. Sara Martín (Chapter 13) further explores the representation of male bonding—in this case, male friendship—in two interesting examples of the middlebrow First World War novel, Wilfrid Ewart’s The Way of Revelation (1921) and Ernest Raymond’s Tell England: A Study in a Generation (1922). Based on the notion, developed by Gay and Queer Studies, of the homoeroticism at the core of heterosexual friendships, Martín claims that, despite the efforts of scholars in these fields, homophobia has actually increased in recent years, now that it is progressively harder to represent men’s friendship in fiction (particularly in extreme situations like war) as other than concealed homosexual desire. In that sense, the two novels under study are presented as strangely refreshing in the 21st century, as they are both openly aware of the homoerotic overtones of men’s friendship. Among the avenues of literary production that remained opened to writers during the Great War, children’s literature merits special attention. The chapters in Part 7, ‘The Children’s War’ focus on how children’s literature was used not only to educate children about the realities of the Great War but also to mould the thought of a whole generation based on the dominant cultural interpretations of the conflict. Dorothea Flothow’s chapter (Chapter 14) examines the ways by which children’s writers attempted to come to terms with the war and its developments, both by reacting to new developments in warfare, such as the trenches, poison gas or mass mobilisation, as well as by drawing on stereotypes and narrative strategies that had already been used to glorify previous, imperial conflicts. Flothow’s contention is that children’s writers, producing a form of unofficial war propaganda, in fact went to great lengths to downplay the special nature of the Great War, thus making it conceivable for a young audience. By comparing novels from the pre-war decade with those of the early war years, Flothow highlights both the changes and, particularly, the continuities in the presentation of war and of the German enemy. With a focus on British and Canadian fiction and non-fiction published from 1914–1919, including poetry, short stories, novels, periodicals and textbooks, Elizabeth Galway’s essay (Chapter 15) explores some of the paradoxical representations of the war found in wartime children’s literature; ones which reflect differing attitudes towards the war on the part of adult authors, as well as inconsistent notions of children and childhood. Her chapter considers examples of both militaristic and pacifist sentiment, examines competing views of national and imperial identities, explores shifting representations of gender roles, and investigates the ways in which this literature reveals complex notions of childhood, including the concern that the war posed a threat not only to the lives of individual children, but to the existence of childhood itself.\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nAdded to the sense of urgency in studying the contrasting meanings of the Great War, these seven sections investigate subject choices (what is deliberately revealed and concealed), the question of experience and agency, and the aesthetic and ideological issues that arise so many decades later when engaging with the complex and ever-controversial idea of setting the record straight. In the attempt to frame not only the uniqueness of the literature emerging in response to the Great War but also its significance as a site of contest between the languages of persuasion and dissonance, this book assesses the extent to which the different attitudes towards the war experience redefine crucial aspects of traditional war narratives and combine them with the seemingly ironic perceptions characteristic of the literature of disillusionment. As the centennial commemorations of the Great War begin to take place across Europe and further afield, we want to stress the idea that memory is constantly developing and triggering different and even divergent responses from those involved in the process of remembering. Above all, we hope that the essays in this collection—by promoting a balanced and thought-through response to the horrors of conflict, and of its aftermaths, will play their own small part in giving the lie to Hardy’s bleak premonition that the end of enlightenment and understanding is almost upon us, and will help show that, precisely through calibrated and sensitive response to such a dramatic breakdown in all that is decent and humane, ‘better whiles may follow worse’.

Kipling also became a member of the Imperial War Graves Commission, yet no reference at all is made to the war or to his son’s death in his 1937 autobiography, Something of Myself. His response to the war is, however, significant in a number of controversial, often misogynistic, short stories written before his son’s death, and in his subsequent decision to write a history of The Irish Guards, his son’s regiment. Kipling was also from an early age an enthusiastic freemason and in later years he published a number of short stories which celebrate the comfort that freemasonry brought to soldiers during and after the war, and which reflect his progression from outspoken patriotism to muted disenchantment. 2nd Lieutenant Kipling was wounded and missing. kipling 1997: 24\n\nKipling’s life was indelibly scarred by the death of his son, John, on 27th September 1915 at the Battle of Loos. The above quotation is from The Irish Guards in the Great War: The Second Battalion, ‘a labour of love’ (Smith 1980: 271) undertaken by Kipling in remembrance of John and his comrades who lost their lives in the First World War. Often dryly detailed, Kipling’s comprehensive account of The Irish Guards’ participation in the war makes mention of his son only twice. The second reference appears shortly after the first, amid a list of other wounded, missing and dead: ‘Of their officers, 2nd Lieutenant Pakenham-Law had died of wounds; 2nd lieutenants Clifford and Kipling were missing, Captain and Adjutant the Hon. T.E. Vesey, Captain Wynter, Lieutenant Stevens, and 2nd Lieutenants Sassoon and Grayson were wounded, the last being blown up by a shell’ (Kipling 1997: 28). John Kipling’s body was never recovered or identified during his parents’ lifetimes, a source of undiminished anguish, particularly when, for a while, there were hopes that he had been taken prisoner by the enemy rather than lost among the unknown dead. Despite, or more likely because of, his immense grief, Kipling’s subsequent work was largely silent about his son’s death. With the exception of the short\n\n© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi 10.1163/9789004314924_003\n\n18\n\nPhillips\n\npoem ‘My Boy Jack’, The Irish Guards in the Great War, first published in 1923, was to remain his son’s only literary memorial. In his notoriously uninformative autobiography, Something of Myself, published in 1937, the year after his death, Kipling makes only the most cursory reference to the war, and devotes only one brief sentence to his son: ‘…my son John arrived on a warm August night of ‘97, under what seemed a every good omen’ (1964: 136–137). Never has the word ‘seemed’ been so loaded with foreboding. In 1917, two years after his son’s disappearance, Kipling became a member of the Imperial War Graves Commission and it was he who decided on the phrase ‘Their name liveth for evermore’ (Ecclesiasticus, 44:14, KJAV), to be found in many war cemeteries. For Kipling, the telling of stories was a means of trying to make sense of the world. Indeed, it was a means of retelling events, of recreating the past in a way that distanced it, remoulded it and made it more palatable. This is clear in stories such as ‘Baa Baa Black Sheep’ (1888), which is clearly influenced by Kipling’s own deeply unhappy childhood in Southsea, as he was later to recount in Something of Myself (1937). Storytelling was also one of the means by which Kipling tried to come to terms with his daughter Josephine’s death in 1899. Tight-lipped, according to his biographer Lord Birkenhead, [t]alk of Josephine to others he seldom did to the end of his days, but at least he could write about her for himself alone, and through this catharsis expel an intolerable sorrow. It is not in his letters, but in such works as They and ‘Merrow Down’ that we shall find the intensity of Kipling’s passion and dereliction. (200) Published in the collection Traffics and Discoveries in 1904, ‘They’ is, literally, a haunting story about a man who drives across the countryside of South Eastern rural England until, by chance, he comes across ‘an ancient house of lichened and weather-worn stone, with mullioned windows and roofs of rose-red tile’ (1913: 341). Children can be heard playing in the grounds and they appear, briefly, at the windows of the house but are, apparently, too shy to come any closer. Drawn to the house, and especially to the children, the man returns on a number of occasions and slowly, rather more slowly, indeed, than the reader, realises that the children do not really exist. They are children who have died, yet refuse to leave the world, or are unable to leave because of the strength of their parents’ grief. As the story ends and the narrator understands the nature of the house and its otherworldly occupants, he reluctantly realises that he must leave: ‘In truth I could see, and my view confirmed me in my resolve, though that was like the very parting of spirit and flesh. Yet a little longer\n\nRudyard Kipling’s War, Freemasonry And Misogyny\n\n19\n\nI would stay since it was the last time’ (374). And so the story ends, with the mistress of the house’s final admonition: ‘You who must never come here again!’ (375). The story is, unashamedly, a fairy tale version of Kipling’s struggle to accept his daughter’s death and return to a semblance of normal life. And, like all fairy tales, there is something sinister, something disturbing about the apparent choice being offered by the distant calling children who never come fully into view. They must be resisted or life must end. The story ends with the narrator not quite ready to leave the house but soon to do so. It is not the children who must be released, but the narrator, if he is to carry on. Ironically, of course, the story itself grants Josephine, and the memory of her father’s grief, a longevity that it purportedly claims to surrender. Once again, it is fiction— perhaps as a ceremony of exorcism—that enables Kipling to construct, in part, a more congenial reality. Writing, then, was long a means by which Kipling both made the world more comprehensible and convivial, and also the means by which he interrogated those aspects of it, the ideas and ideologies that predominated in the British Empire of the nineteenth century, that perplexed him. His celebrated short story, ‘The Man Who Would Be King’, first published in 1888 in The Phantom Rickshaw and other Eerie Tales when the author was only twenty-two years old, is a notable example. The story appears to be—and perhaps is—a parable of empire, in which two adventurers, Daniel Dravot and Peachey Carnehan, decide to become rulers of the distant Afghan region of Kafiristan. Highly ambiguous, the story gives the impression of being both a condemnation of Britain’s imperial adventures, while at the same time celebrating the indomitable spirit of its unlikely heroes. An added complication to the story is the inclusion of Freemasonry as a major driver of the plot. Paul Fussell Jr., describes how ‘[t]hree years before ‘The Man Who Would Be King’ appeared, Kipling had become a Freemason, joining the Lodge ‘Hope and Perseverance, No. 782 E.C.’ at Lahore’ (1958: 225) and that the story ‘clearly issues from the mind, excited by Masonic symbolism and Masonic ethical precepts, and, in a sense, the ethical system of the story could be said to be Masonic’ (1958: 226). There is no doubt that the youthful Kipling rather liked becoming a member even though, as he confesses in Something of Myself, he was not really old enough to be admitted. Freemasonry provided, however, an idealised community based not only on sturdy ethical principles, but also on equality: ‘Here’, he recalls, ‘I met Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, members of the Arya and Brahmo Samaj, and a Jew tyler, who was priest and butcher to his little community in the city’ (Kipling 1937: 52–53). Fussell’s main argument is that Kipling’s ‘long and affectionate association with Freemasonry is partly to be explained by this coincidence between Kipling’s instinctive ethical feelings and Masonic formulations’ (1958: 229).\n\n20\n\nPhillips\n\nNevertheless, Kipling’s affection for the Craft was hardly observed by attendance at the Lodge. Richard Jaffa reports that ‘there is no hard evidence of Kipling’s attendance at Lodges (with one solitary exception) after he left India’ (2011: 74), but the solitary exception is important. It was to Rosemary Lodge No. 2851 which met at the Imperial Restaurant Regent Street London on 17th November, 1924. This Lodge was previously known as the Lodge of the Artists’ Rifles, and still exists. It is one of a number of Lodges with military connections. (2011: 74) and is, in part, the model for Faith and Works Lodge 5837, the setting for a number of his post war stories. Kipling, Fussell argues, at 23 was not yet ‘the man who offended a whole generation of critics to the point where one could sweepingly assert, “Kipling is a jingo imperialist, he is morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting”’ (1958: 230). The critic referred to is George Orwell who published his enormously influential attack on Kipling in Horizon magazine in 1942. Kipling, he says, sold out to the British governing class, not financially but emotionally. This warped his political judgement, for the British ruling class were not what he imagined, and it led him into abysses of folly and snobbery. (229) Orwell is, I believe, mistaken. The First World War, and especially the death of his son, opened Kipling’s eyes; no longer able to sustain a belief in the civilising mission of British imperialism (if, indeed, he ever truly had), Kipling returns to his faith in narrative and Freemasonry. Religion, particularly Christianity, offers no consolation but Freemasonry, meanwhile, offers the nostalgia of his youth, an acceptable ethical code, blamelessness for the cruelties of the world and, above all, a narrative, quite clearly fanciful, but functional, in which every man (but not woman) was accepted as a brother and an equal. For Kipling, Freemasonry was another narrative strand in the story of his life, another ingredient in the fictions that he wrote as a means of comprehending the complexity of the world with all its uncertainties, injustices and trials. Yet as the First World War began, Kipling was still a champion of empire. Andrew Rutherford, in his ‘Introduction’ to the anthology Rudyard Kipling War Stories and Poems, describes Kipling’s frustration at Britain’s unpreparedness for war. Kipling, he says\n\nRudyard Kipling’s War, Freemasonry And Misogyny\n\n21\n\nwarned Britain of the need to prepare for Armageddon, to introduce some form of universal military training, to make ready to defend herself against dangers of invasion and defeat which she had not had to face since the overthrow of Napoleon. (2009: xx) At the same time, Kipling became increasingly concerned with Germany itself. Angus Wilson refers to his ‘violent anti-Germanism growing since the early nineties’ (1977: 299) and that Germany’s defeat was ‘not only just, but necessary, in order to save the world from a brutal tyranny’ (1977: 299). Perhaps so, but the three war stories produced by Kipling prior to his son’s death are disturbing. The first of these to be published was ‘Swept and Garnished’ which appeared in January 1915. The story was prompted by Kipling’s genuine horror at the ‘murder and mutilation of children, reported of the Germans invading neutral Belgium’ (Rutherford 2009: 358). ‘Swept and Garnished’ is set in a Berlin flat in which Frau Ebermann lies in bed, feverish with ‘mild influenza’ (Kipling 2009: 226). ‘Eber’ means ‘boar’ in German, and there is no doubt that Frau Ebermann is boarish—in her brusque manner towards her servant Anna, and to the children that appear in her room. The apparent gentility of Frau Ebermann’s position, in a comfortable flat, with a servant, in one of the great capitals of the world, is a veneer. The lace cover on ‘top of the radiator behind the green plush sofa’ (Kipling 2009: 226) is imitation, as is the marble top of the radiator itself. The room is furnished in the worst of taste with ‘yellow cut-glass handles’ on the chest of drawers, curtains of ‘heavy puce’ and ‘mauve enamel, New Art finger-plates on the door’ (Kipling 2009: 227). Frau Ebermann seemingly compensates for the vulgarity that Kipling (rather snobbishly) describes by keeping everything ‘mathematically square’ (Kipling 2009: 226). Frau Ebermann, perhaps Frau Everyman, or at least Every German, has wealth and power, but neither class nor sensibility. When ‘an untidy, thin-faced little girl of about ten’ (Kipling 2009: 226) enters, Frau Ebermann demands that she put the imitation-lace cover straight, before insisting that she ‘go away’ (Kipling 2009: 227). Instead, four other dirty, ragged children appear who, the reader discovers, are the Belgian dead, come to haunt Frau Ebermann in her meticulous Berlin room. Admonishing them for trespassing, Frau Ebermann is told by a six-year-old that ‘[you] know you should not come into houses and rooms unless you are invited. Not houses and bedrooms, you know’ (Kipling 2009: 230). This is how the children and their families died, as the German soldiers broke into their homes and slaughtered them. ‘He told them only pigs would do that’ (Kipling 2009: 230) continues one of the little girls, in a subtle allusion to Frau Ebermann’s name.\n\n22\n\nPhillips\n\nThe story ends with Frau Ebermann on her knees attempting to clean blood spots left by the children with the imitation lace cover, for the room must be ‘swept and garnished that Our dear Lord when He came might find everything as it should be’ (Kipling 2009: 234). The title of the story is to be found in a rather baffling passage from the Bible (Luke 11: 24–26) in which a swept and garnished house is inhabited by evil spirits. The reference to ‘this wicked generation’ with which the Biblical passage concludes is clearly a reference to Germany. The story, however, is heavy handed in its psychoanalysis of denial. Martin Seymour-Smith argues that ‘Kipling, despite himself, humanises a German’ (1989: 343), yet Frau Ebermann’s vision of the slaughtered children is more a well-deserved punishment, than a redeeming manifestation of guilt. Indeed, it is hard to know how the Germans of ‘Swept and Garnished’, immersed as they are in their vulgarity and military neatness, could be redeemed. Frau Ebermann, as a conventional woman and mother (‘Frau Ebermann had had children of her own, but they were all grown up now, and she had never been a child-lover in any sense’ Kipling 2009: 227), ought to symbolise all that is gentle and nurturing, yet her femininity is denied to her, and thus denied to Germany itself. The second, and most notorious of the three Great War stories is ‘Mary Postgate’. Initially reviled as a repulsive tale of revenge reflecting Kipling’s public attitude towards the barbaric Germans, commentators now view it as one of Kipling’s most complex and subtle works. Martin Seymour-Smith exclaims that it ‘seems amazing that this story should have been misunderstood in the sense that anyone has been able to think that Kipling regarded Mary Postgate with approval or sympathy’ (1989: 346). The story is as follows: Mary Postgate is a professional companion, aged 44 by the story’s end, who participated in the upbringing of her mistress’s nephew, Wynn. The young man becomes a trainee pilot in the Royal Flying Corps, but dies in an accident. Soon after, another pilot, having apparently fallen from the sky, appears to Mary at the bottom of the garden where she is burning Wynn’s possessions. Mary ignores his appeals for help and watches him die from his injuries with great satisfaction, so much so that she appears to reach a sexual climax as he expires. Briefly before this final scene Mary has witnessed the death of a young girl in the village, which she attributes to a German bomb, dropped by an enemy plane, though the village doctor assures her that in fact the death was accidental, caused by a collapsing stable roof. As a revenge tale, the story makes no sense. Wynn is not killed in action by the enemy, but in an accident in England. Though it is true, without the war, he would not have been training as a pilot. The death of the young girl is also an accident, though the possibility that it was a bomb is not entirely discounted,\n\nRudyard Kipling’s War, Freemasonry And Misogyny\n\n23\n\nespecially by Mary. Indeed, if there was a bomb, presumably the dying pilot dropped it. Further ambiguities are offered by the dying pilot. His nationality is not clear, indeed he speaks rather poor French, but not German. Perhaps he is a German pilot who thinks he is in France, or who speaks no English, but a smattering of French. Perhaps he is an English pilot who believes he is in France. Perhaps he does not exist at all, except in Mary’s fevered imagination, conjured up by the undamming of a lifetime’s suppressed sexuality and emotion. The possibilities are diverse and contradictory yet one thing at least is clear; the story is not a simple revenge tale with the monstrous enemy receiving his just deserts. Indeed, the most monstrous figure in the story is Mary herself, a female non-combatant, sexually relishing the death of a soldier. Mary Postgate, then, is the product of Kipling’s misogynistic imagination; as Gilbert and Gubar have pointed out ‘the unmanning terrors of combat lead not just to a generalized sexual anxiety but also to an anger directed specifically against the female, as if the Great War itself were primarily a climactic episode in a battle of the sexes that had already been raging for years’ (1989: 260). The third of Kipling’s Great War stories is ‘Sea Constables’ in which a group of four sea captains discuss the pursuit of a neutral ship as it attempts to supply German submarines with fuel. ‘Sea Constables’ is an attack on neutral countries who sacrifice principle for profit. At the end of the story the neutral ship’s captain dies of pneumonia, having been denied medical care by the British. The message is clear: if you do not cooperate with us, we will not help you in your time of need. What is markedly different about this story, however, is the manner of its recounting. Set in a plush London restaurant, the story is told as though it were a jolly public schoolboy yarn reminiscent of Stalky and Co. in which the boys’ bantering and mischief are intertwined with the seriousness of impending imperial duty. This levity is quite different from the dull boorishness of Frau Ebermann, or the disquieting, twisted passion of Mary Postgate. As Jan Montefiore remarks in her biography of Kipling: [t]hese stories divide sharply along gender lines: on the one hand, the fairly numerous stories of damaged men attempting more or less successfully to deal with the effects of war, often through shared memories and mutual help; on the other, the much darker ghost stories of women enduring loss and guilt. (2007: 149) After his son’s death, Kipling’s war stories deal with the consequences of the war. These, as Montefiore perceptively remarks, can be divided on gender lines: damaged war veterans enjoying ‘male camaraderie’ (Montefiore 2007: 149) and the privilege of victimhood, while the women continue to be punished and\n\n24\n\nPhillips\n\ndenied forgiveness. ‘The Gardener’, published in 1925, is about Helen Turrell who, like Wynn’s aunt in ‘Mary Postgate’, brings up her nephew, Michael. In Helen’s case, though, her nephew is given to her as a tiny baby when she is away in Marseilles, recovering from illness. Nothing is known of the child’s mother while his father, George, Helen’s wastrel brother, has died in an accident. Michael grows up, secretly calling Helen ‘Mummy’ until the war comes, and like John Kipling, is commissioned, spends a month at the front, and goes missing. His body, hidden beneath a collapsed wall, is not recovered for a number of years until Helen is finally informed that it has been found and reinterred. The story abounds with clues that Helen is in fact Michael’s mother and this is confirmed at the end of the story when, visiting Michael’s grave, she asks a gardener to help her find her nephew: ‘“Come with me”, he said, “and I will show you where your son lies”’ (Kipling 1987: 287). The story ends with a reference to the Biblical story from John 20:15 in which Mary Magdalene mistakes Jesus for a gardener. Given that Mary Magdalene has acquired a reputation for sexual misconduct, the story suggests that Helen is guilty of a similar sin, by giving birth to a child out of wedlock. Indeed, the name Helen (of Troy) itself is on a par with Mary Magdalene for its connotations of adultery and infidelity. This is reinforced by the parallel story of Mrs Scarsworth, who regularly visits the war graves on behalf of other women. Mrs Scarsworth (her name also marks her as a sinner) is really visiting the grave of the man who ‘was everything to me that he oughtn’t to have been’ (Kipling 1987: 318). We learn nothing further of the nature of their relationship, though it was presumably adulterous. These women, then, have sinned and paid for their sins through the loss of their loved ones. Is it too great a step to wonder if these men—unacknowledged sons, secret lovers—were lost because of their womenfolk’s sins? Have Frau Ebermann, Mary Postgate, Helen Turrell and Mrs. Scarsworth, like latter-day Eves, disturbed the moral fabric of the universe and brought death into the world? Gilbert and Gubar describe how women were instrumental in sending men off to war, and hence to destruction: That one of the War Office’s best-known posters proclaimed ‘Women of Britain say “GO”!’ therefore, and that a number of other conscription efforts harped on the same theme, would obviously have unnerved recruits and draftees. And that a kind of female censoriousness—or worse, a species of female greed—might be implicit in such a slogan seemed borne out by the fact that at times the vigorous, able-bodied ‘war girls’, who had so often been found wanting by even the weakest of young men, became frighteningly judgemental about their male contemporaries. (1989: 282–283)\n\nRudyard Kipling’s War, Freemasonry And Misogyny\n\n25\n\n‘In the Interests of the Brethren’, published in 1918, is the first of Kipling’s later Masonic stories. It describes, with desperate enthusiasm, the wonderful work done by Faith and Works Lodge 5837 in its rehabilitation of war weary servicemen. Shepherded into the lodge by Worshipful Brother Burges, lonely soldiers from the most distant outposts of the empire are welcomed and soothed by the ritual of the Craft. The anonymous narrator displays a zeal for the Lodge’s endeavours, that touches on hysteria. His son still missing in action, presumed dead, Kipling no longer believes in a just war as the couplet ‘If any question why we died, /Tell them, because our fathers lied’ (Kipling 2009: 324) demonstrates. These two lines sum up Kipling’s sense of his own guilt, and that of the empire he supported so vehemently. Only the Craft remains: ‘All Ritual is fortifying. Ritual’s a natural necessity for mankind. The more things are upset, the more they fly to it’ (Kipling 1987: 68), says Brother Burges. The next story to take place at Faith and Works Lodge 5837 is ‘The Janeites’ which again emphasises the fraternity, equality and comfort that war veterans found in Freemasonry. Less strident in tone than ‘In the Interests of the Brethren’, ‘The Janeites’ celebrates the virtues of work, camaraderie and, of course, the novels of Jane Austen (hence the title, ‘The Janeites’) yet once again misogyny leaks in through the comic narrative of Brother Humberstall who, despite being blown up and declared unfit for service, had insisted on returning to the front to escape his mother, sister and aunts: ‘Board or no Board, I ‘adn’t the nerve to stay at ‘ome—not with Mother chuckin’ ‘erself round all three rooms like a rabbit every time the Gothas tried to get Victoria; an’ sister writin’ me aunts four pages about it next day. Not for me, thank you! till the war was over’ (Kipling 1987: 121). Ironically, the men—both officers and other ranks in the person of Brother Humberstall, are united in their love of a woman— Jane Austen. A woman, furthermore, who largely wrote about women and, in all probability, largely for women. Ten years after Kipling wrote ‘The Janeites’, Lord David Cecil was to write that the ‘novelist’s problem is to evolve an orderly composition which is also a convincing picture of life. It is Jane Austen’s triumph that she solves this problem perfectly’ (322–3). This was always Kipling’s aim: to represent reality as an orderly composition, while remaining convincing, if only to himself, of its veracity; to create order out of chaos. That the civilising mission of narrative was best realised by a woman—Jane Austen—is a confirmation of the symbolic role traditionally assigned to women in times of war; they are the embodiment of all that must be preserved from the barbarian ravages of the enemy. Jane Austen, then, serves to remind the soldier of the purpose of his task, but in a rather more intellectual, rational and comforting way than that of the unnerving War Office conscription posters described above.\n\n26\n\nPhillips\n\nThe final three stories that use Freemasonry as their frame are ‘A Madonna of the Trenches’ (1924), ‘A Friend of the Family’ (1924) and ‘Fairy-Kist’(1927). The first, ‘A Madonna of the Trenches’, is largely set at the Front and deals specifically with one of Kipling’s ongoing concerns: shell-shock. Strangwick, a visitor at Faith and Works Lodge 5837, has a sudden breakdown and is taken to the Tyler’s room by the narrator and a doctor who, coincidentally, served with him during the war. The doctor, Keede, prescribes an unnamed drug that both calms Strangwick and prompts him to reveal the true nature of his fears. Initially Strangwick insists they are nothing more than the usual wartime horrors—corpses lining the walls of the trenches and desiccated bodies creaking under the duckboards. However, it is slowly revealed that what really horrifies him is the knowledge of the affair between an old friend of the family, who was also a sergeant in the same battalion, and Strangwick’s Aunt. The Aunt dies of breast cancer but not before warning her lover by telegram of her imminent death. Strangwick and the sergeant see her ghost in the trenches: ‘An’ ‘e was lookin’ at ‘er as though he could ‘ave et ‘er, an’ she was lookin’ at ‘im the same way, out of ‘er eyes’ (Kipling 1987: 188) and then the lovers disappear into a hut where the sergeant is discovered dead the next day, having deliberately suffocated himself. This experience so stuns Strangwick that he refuses to marry his betrothed, despite her family’s threats to sue him if he does not. The true nature of Strangwick’s malady is thus revealed as sexual. So horrific have his wartime experiences been that he can no longer imagine the possibility of physical intimacy with a woman. He has effectively been castrated. We return again to the words of Gilbert and Gubar: ‘the unmanning terrors of combat lead not just to a generalized sexual anxiety but also to an anger directed specifically against the female’ (1989: 260). The context of the war, the overtly sexual nature of Strangwick’s Aunt’s and sergeant’s relationship, and their entwined deaths unman him. It might be pertinent to remember that ‘wick’ is cockney rhyming slang (‘Hampton Wick’), and that the protagonist’s is ‘strange’. ‘A Friend of the Family’ (1926) appears to be a simple revenge story which, like ‘A Madonna of the Trenches’ uses Freemasonry Lodge ‘Faith and Works’, 5837 E.C. as a setting and frame story for events which occurred during the war. At the beginning of the story one of the Lodge members remarks: ‘The trouble is there hasn’t been any judgement taken or executed. That’s why the world is where it is now. We didn’t need anything but justice—afterwards. Not getting ‘that, the bottom fell out of things, naturally’ (219). The narrator, another Lodge member named Bevin, concurs: ‘We didn’t want all that talk afterwards—we only wanted justice. What I say is, there must be a right and a wrong to things. It can’t all be kiss-an’-make-friends, no matter what you do’ (219).\n\nRudyard Kipling’s War, Freemasonry And Misogyny\n\n27\n\nBut who are the guilty? Kipling’s focus is no longer on Germans such as the crassly culpable Frau Ebermann in ‘Swept and Garnished’; rather it is the righting of administrative injustice and disloyalty in England itself. Bert Vigors, only son of a market gardener is drafted out to the war despite the fact that his father’s business requires him to remain at home. The case is taken to an exemption tribunal, and thrown out; Bert is to be conscripted. Shortly afterwards the same tribunal exempts the two sons of a rival market gardener who has only recently established himself in business. According to the narrator, Bevin, ‘The whole case was frank and above-board to a degree—our county paper had it all in, too. Agricultural produce vital necessity; the plough mightier than the sword’ (223). Bevin suggests that the members of the tribunal were bribed by Margetts, the rival market gardener. Soon, the aging (and ironically named) Vigors is unable to cope alone and is forced to close. No longer afterwards the son, Bert, is killed at the front. Despite the fact that Bert Vigors had a justifiable grudge, his continual complaints about his situation made him few friends, as Bevin explains: ‘that was Bert’s grievance, an’ he was known as “The Grief” (223). Neither the military, nor the spirit of national sacrifice, were sympathetic to a grumbling soldier at the front. He made friends, however, with an Australian named Hickmot, a man who ‘hadn’t seen an English house or a field or a road or—anything any civ’lized man is used to in all his life! Sheep an’ blacks!’ (224). Bevin, who is from the same village as Vigors, is sent back home to England as an explosives instructor, where he marries Bert Vigors’s sister, and Hickmot, having lost his leg, joins them while waiting for an artificial limb to be fitted. The day that Hickmot leaves the village, Margetts’s house and glasshouse are destroyed, apparently by an enemy bomber, and one of Margetts’s sons suffers a broken arm. Bevin soon realises that it is not the Germans who are responsible, but Hickmot, who has avenged his late friend’s ‘grievance’. Disheartened, Margetts goes mad and old Mr. Vigors is able to buy back the business he has lost. There is an interesting similarity here with ‘Mary Postgate’ in which a German airman is also blamed for bombing the village. From 1915, Kipling’s initial hatred for the Germans seems to have disappeared. Indeed, the references to German soldiers in the story suggest they are allies or fellow sufferers rather than enemies. While discussing the injustices of the conscription exemption tribunals, one of the Lodge members remarks, ‘[t]hat’s the thing that made one really want the Hun in England for a week or two’ (223), presumably in order to hunt down and execute the corrupt tribunal members. Later, while Bevin describes how Hickmot broke Margetts’s son’s arm, he compares the scene to the ease with which they ‘used to drop Huns comin’ out of a dugout. You know how they blink at the light?’ (230), suggesting that the German\n\n28\n\nPhillips\n\nsoldiers, far from being the ferocious killers depicted by British propaganda, were as vulnerable as anyone else to the murderous consequences of war. As in ‘Mary Postgate’, it is once more the English—or certain members of the populace—that are singled out for the attack, in this case Margetts, who represents, in miniature, the interests of business and money. The war provides him with an opportunity to enrich himself, something that he was, apparently, incapable of achieving in times of peace. Not only does he benefit from the sacrifice of others—it is the wartime demand for home-grown produce, together with the shortage of labour brought about by conscription that gives him his opening— but he ensures that he will need to make no commensurate sacrifice himself. At the same time the representatives of authority—’the patriotic old wassers on the bench’ (223) are not only incompetent and irresponsible in sending Bert Vigors out to the front when he was needed at home, but also blatantly corrupt in their decision to exempt the Margetts boys from service. This is the kind of complaint made during and after the war about the incompetence and dishonesty of the political and military authorities. It is not surprising, then, that the notorious First World War disaster, the Gallipoli Campaign, proposed by Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, is where Bevin first meets Hickmot. Indeed, given that there is no plot necessity for Hickmot to be an Australian, perhaps Kipling deliberately chose an Anzac because he wished to bring Gallipoli and its legacy of criminal incompetence and doomed heroism into the story. A further reason for including Australians is suggested at the beginning of the story, when the Lodge members debate the status of the country with a Sydneysider named Orton. He too was at Gallipoli: ‘They gambled us away in two days’, (220), he complains, but at this point of the story it is the empire which concerns them; Bevin begins the conversation: “…Have you started that Republic of yours down under yet?” “No. But we’re goin’ to. Then you’ll see”. “Carry on. No one’s hindering”, Bevin pursued. The Australian scowled. “No. We know they ain’t. And—and—that’s what makes us all so crazy angry with you”. He threw back his head and laughed the spleen out of him. “What can you do with an Empire that— that don’t care what you do?”. (219) Kipling retains his love of the British Empire. The Australians, along with thousands of other men and women from around the empire have flocked to the Motherland to fight the enemy, and they do so, the conversation suggests, because they are not obliged to. They do it for love and because they know they\n\nRudyard Kipling’s War, Freemasonry And Misogyny\n\n29\n\ncan leave whenever they like. Hickmot ‘had walked for two months to Brisbane to join up […he] was born an’ bred among the black fellers, as they call ‘em, two hundred miles from the nearest town, four hundred miles from a railway, an’ ten thousand from the grace o’ God—out in Queensland near some desert’ (221). The road to Gallipoli was not an easy one for Hickmot, and once there, found his ‘battalion completely expended’ (221). The empire too, has been betrayed. Faithful still, he joins Bevin’s battalion and ends up in France where he befriends Bert and loses a leg. His friendship with Bert Vigors leads him to England where he enacts his revenge. A warning, perhaps, to England and its government. The betrayal of the fighting man will have consequences, both in the empire and at home. The former will disintegrate, the latter, seething and rebellious, will overthrow the old order. Kipling, in the final decade and a half of his life, contemplates the destruction of everything he cherished. The Great War represented for Kipling the greatest of traumas, the loss of his son. Yet a lifetime devoted to narrative and the imagination offered some consolation. Perhaps it was for this reason that he spent so long on the factual account of the Irish Guards before returning to his stories; an escape into fiction would have been a betrayal, a transformation of loss into art. Meanwhile, disenchanted, unconsoled by religion or civic duty, Freemasonry provided, as it had done as a young man, a beguiling and idealistic fantasy of brotherhood and nurture. That he only once visited a Lodge in this period indicates the symbolic rather than real reliance he placed on the men-only Craft. Meanwhile, misogyny becomes ever more overt in Kipling’s wartime and post-war work. In part a consequence of the war, it was shared by others. Sassoon referred to harlots, shrilling the music hall chorus: ‘I’d like to see a Tank come down the stalls/ Lurching to ragtime tunes, or “Home, sweet Home”/And there’d be no more jokes in Music-halls’ (1983: 68) he wrote in ‘Blighters’.

Amongst the authors whose works British soldiers appear to have read is Jane Austen. Indeed, Austen’s novels also formed part of the therapy that some wounded soldiers received in British hospitals. This chapter assesses what aspects of these works might have appealed to such readers and what underlying ideas led to this application of Austen. A tendentious use of a now-canonical writer emerges. For soldiers, the apparent tranquillity of Austen’s world was a reminder of calm, order and decency. For military authorities, Austen’s works were a timely injection of an ideal ‘England’ whose values and virtue needed to be re-instilled in those expected to sacrifice their lives to it.\n\nSpeak through the earthquake, wind, and fire, O still, small voice of calm1 When talking of Austen and War, it is now almost conventional to cite the letter from the historian (and jurist) Frederic Harrison to Thomas Hardy, late in 1913 and on the very eve of the First World War, in which Austen is accused of being ‘a rather heartless little cynic […] penning satires about her neighbours whilst the Dynasts were tearing the world to pieces and consigning millions to their graves’ (in Kent 1989: 59).2 And it is perhaps now equally conventional—at least in the ambit of Austen Studies—to point out how significantly this view misunderstands or ignores the submerged, subliminal and indirect manner in which Austen engages with questions of war (what exactly were all those uniformed young men quartered together for up in Meryton? How is it that Captain Frederick Wentworth comes home such a financial catch from his ocean exploits?). 1 John Greenleaf Whittier, ‘Dear Lord and Father of Mankind’ (1884). 2 A more sympathetic version of this view, though one that essentially makes the same point, is that voiced by Virginia Woolf. Referring both to Scott and Austen, she observes that ‘neither of them in all their novels mentioned the Napoleonic wars. This shows that their model, their vision of human life, was not disturbed or agitated or changed by war’ (1975: 130–131). © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi 10.1163/9789004314924_004\n\n32\n\nOwen\n\nThe most elegant and informative rebuttal of Harrison that I know of is Christopher Kent’s ‘Learning History with, and from, Jane Austen’,3 which deftly reveals the extent of this misunderstanding and points to far more constructive ways of reading the novelist’s handling of warfare (among other issues). His views show us that, not unexpectedly, our own position— privileged as it is by decades of literary research and debate—takes us in very different interpretative directions to those of earlier readers. But even accepting that there must have been many other critical ideas on Austen than Harrison’s visceral defenestration, it is equally clear that, at the time of the Great War, she would also have been appreciated by general readers in markedly different ways from those of the readers of today. Yet any reliable access to just how Austen may have been understood widely and generally over a century ago is surely a hopeless task.4 Today’s blogosphere and onlinebookseller reviews will doubtless provide future researchers with a wealth of reader-response insight into our own times, from the trivial and partial through to the dispassionate and judicial, but—looking back to the First World War— we are almost entirely bereft of such information. Instead, if we want to glean anything at all meaningful with respect to views on Austen and on her work, all we really have left to us is professional critical response (which accelerated dramatically post-1870 with the publication of her nephew’s hagiographic Memoirs of Jane Austen) and, largely as a part of that same critical response, the various opinions expressed in the almost notorious Janeite/Anti-Janeite debate,5 if that is what we should call it, which would rage up to, and indeed go well beyond, the Great War. 3 See Jane Austen’s Beginnings (Grey 1989: 59–72). 4 However, see Johnson’s Jane Austen’s Cults and Cultures (2012: 100–111) for a discussion of contemporary reflections on Austen by (among others) Reginald Farrer in his The Void of War: Letters from Three Fronts (1918). For additional approaches and discussion, see Favret’s ‘Reading Jane Austen in Wartime’ (2008). 5 The term ‘Janeite’ is generally agreed to have been coined by George Saintsbury (Trott 2005: 94, in reference to the oed), who used it in 1894 in his introduction to an edition of Pride and Prejudice, though it is perfectly possible that it was in less formal currency prior to this. Certainly, the notion of Austen devotees pre-existed the nomenclature. Brian Southam traces the origins of what would become the Janeite/Anti-Janeite division to the early 1830s (1986: 237), and it had become a fairly consolidated fault-line in both popular and critical opinion by the end of the century. Essentially, readers who identified themselves as ‘Janeites’ were (often self-admittedly) visceral in the nature of their approval of Austen’s work; ‘anti-Janeites’, on the other hand, though usually not challenging the literary quality of Austen’s novels, drew attention to what they saw as a certain ‘suspension’ of critical insight in Janeite approbation. Southam (op. cit. 239) cites S.F. Malden’s late-Victorian study (Jane Austen 1889: 210)\n\nConscripting Gentle Jane\n\n33\n\nHowever, precisely from the nature of this interpretative rift itself comes the focus of my discussion in this chapter. The Janeites in the Great War, in holding and promoting a culturally elite view of Austen, were instrumental in applying a highly particular notion both of her own value and, especially, of the significance of her work, which—I argue—served a determined political objective, namely that of reinforcing a rather tendentious idea of England as a place of measured civility, of decent codes of behaviour and, above all, of dependable calm and order; in short, a place very much worth suffering and fighting for. More specifically still, my concern here is not with the arcane give and take in the decades prior to war of those besotted by a peculiar feeling of pertinence to Austen and to her writing or those, in contrast, who sensed something amiss in all of this6 but—rather—with the manner in which the former (the Janeites) appear to have held sway in what was the extraordinary use made of this writing during the war itself: as I will consider more fully below, a number of soldiers back on sick leave from active service—the exact figure is unknown—had a course of therapy administered to them by the British Army Medical Corps that included reading literature. For those suffering the worst effects of shell shock, the programme provided Austen’s major novels. To my mind, as I argue throughout this discussion, this was not simply a well-intentioned attempt to bring a little relief to the horrendous mental disorder that these men were undergoing—although the fact that such relief might be attained through the reading of designated and approved literary texts is, in itself, a curiosity—but I believe that it also (and perhaps especially) corresponded to an emphatically propagandistic use of Austen’s work in order to promote, in effect, the perception and consolidation of an idealised view of Home that attempted to give meaning to the chaos of frontline conflict, and which aimed at reinforcing a willingness to defend the values that this body of work conveyed. It is in this very direct sense that, as, Claire Harman (2009) observes, ‘Austen’s novels can be said to have seen active service themselves’(183); in this way, indeed, we to the following effect: ‘Those who do appreciate her novels will think no praise too high for them, while those who do not, will marvel at the infatuation of her admirers; for no-one ever cares moderately for Jane Austen’s work: her readers either award them unbounded praise or find them insufferably dull’. This distinction is not, however, a dichotomy of opinion that faded with the turn of the century. As Halsey (2013) points out, in 1922 the Times—in reporting the death of Mary Austen-Leigh Austen’s great-niece)—cited the former’s view that the novelist was ‘a cult’ to those of more refined sensibilities (203–204); in contrast, as late as 1928, H.W. Garrod was addressing the Royal Society of Literature with a talk titled ‘Jane Austen: A Depreciation’. 6 See, especially, Lynch (2005: 111–112); Johnson (1997: 211–212); and Southam (237–234).\n\n34\n\nOwen\n\nmight argue that Jane Austen—or at least a rather partisan view of the writer and of her work—was conscripted, once again,7 in the name of king and country. At least as an initial response, it might appear reasonable to us in the twenty-first century to assume that the calm and seemingly quiescent world of Austen’s novels could not have been of any real interest to the trench combatants in the First World War, a conflict that—we readily imagine—in its sheer brutality and in the very intensity of its almost-constant proximity to violent death can have had little truck with the niceties of Emma’s misunderstandings or the adolescent angst of Marianne Dashwood. However, although detailed supporting evidence for these claims is rarely given, it is not infrequently asserted that Austen was a popular choice with the soldiers.8 For instance, Harman observes, without further citation, that ‘Austen was prime among the texts that went to war, and the trenches were full of Janeites’ (2009: 181); and Paula Byrne—in an interview in 2013 with the Telegraph, promoting the latest in a long line of biographical accounts of the author— affirms, with no evidence in tow (though, in fairness, the conventions of newspaper interviews rarely require or expect such proof) that ‘she [Austen]\n\n7 Although it is not the case that any propagandistic attempt had been made before the First World War to utilise Austen and her writing in exactly the ways that I propose, passim, in this current discussion, even during her lifetime Austen was pressurised into a certain endorsing of political positions. In November 1815, she was encouraged by the Prince Regent’s royal librarian, James Stanier Clarke, to dedicate her forthcoming novel (Emma) to the prince. By temperament, upbringing and deep personal conviction, Austen felt no little antipathy towards this controversial and divisive national figurehead; referring to the Prince Regent’s wife in personal correspondence of 1813 (Le Faye 2011: Letter of February 16), she asserts that ‘I shall support her as long as I can, because she is a Woman, & because I hate her Husband’. The dedication eventually read as follows ‘To His Royal Highness, the Prince Regent, this work is, by His Royal Highness’s permission, most respectfully dedicated, by His Royal Highness’s dutiful and obedient humble servant, the author’, made more suitable for purpose by the publisher (John Murray), who modified Austen’s original and rather taciturn phrase ‘Emma, Dedicated by Permission to H.R.H. The Prince Regent’. For a fuller historical discussion of the implications of this episode and even the wording of the dedication, see Sheehan (2006). 8 A significant, though only partial, exception to this is the informative discussion set out by Claudia Johnson in Chapter 3 of her Jane Austen’s Cults and Cultures. Whilst Johnson’s discussion does not quantify or otherwise substantiate claims of Austen’s trench popularity, she nevertheless gives ample account—through reference to specific writers and scholars involved in a variety of ways in the war—of why Austen resonated so profoundly, in her view, with soldier readers.\n\nConscripting Gentle Jane\n\n35\n\nwas read in the trenches. She was a prescribed script for tortured, troubled souls’ (cited in Furness 2013). Much earlier, in its Number 69 of December 1915, The War Illustrated (a rather gung-ho British magazine of the time that would be revived in the Second World War and carry on its publication activities until 1947) suggested that ‘[w]hat he [the man in the trenches] does not want is fiction about the war […]. He likes tales of strong domestic interest, and it is worth noting that Jane Austen has taken her fragrant way into a surprising number of dug-outs’.9 Related to these reflections, a very short but highly informative account of trench literature by Davies, Goellmann and Melendre refers to The War Illustrated article and takes note of its remarks, but then goes on to ask the following question (perhaps more firmly planted in the soil of the twenty-first century and its easy preconceptions of conflict mentality than in that of a century previous): ‘[…] would a soldier really read Pride and Prejudice without being mercilessly ridiculed by his colleagues?’ (2013: website). As if in answer to this rhetorical query, the authors then list a number of popular works from the time of the Great War, or thereabouts, including Rudyard Kilping’s Kim (1901); W.W. Jacobs’ anthology of short stories The Lady of the Barge (1902); Nat Gould’s The Rajah’s Racer (1905); H.G. Wells’ The History of Mr Polly (1910); Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World (1912); John Buchan’s The Thirty-Nine Steps (1915) a"
