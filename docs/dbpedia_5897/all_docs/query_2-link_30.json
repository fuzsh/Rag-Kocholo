        "text": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been cheering each other on for months on their respective turfs, but at the 2024 People’s Choice Awards, they were both declared winners. Swift won four awards — female artist, pop artist, concert tour and social celebrity. Kelce won one — athlete of the year. Neither star attended the show — Swift was kept away by touring commitments in Australia.\n\nActor and author Simu Liu hosted the show, which aired live on Sunday (Feb. 18) on NBC, Peacock and E! from the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, Calif. Liu was nominated in the movie performance category for his role in Barbie, but lost to America Ferrera.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice and Jimmy Fallon each won two awards. Rodrigo took song (“Vampire”) and album (Guts); Minaj took hip-hop artist and collaboration song (the latter for “Barbie World,” a collab with Ice Spice featuring Aqua); Ice Spice won that award and also new artist; Fallon won nighttime talk show (The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon) and host (for That’s My Jam).\n\nThree Billboard Hot 100-topping artists won awards in TV categories. Billie Eilish won TV performance for Swarm. Selena Gomez took female TV star for Only Murders in the Building. Kelly Clarkson won daytime talk show for The Kelly Clarkson Show.\n\nBarbie won five awards — movie, comedy movie, male and female movie star (Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie) and movie performance (Ferrera).\n\nRobbie’s win for female movie star makes up, a tiny bit, for the fact that she was passed over for an Oscar nomination for best actress. Likewise, Ice Spice’s win for new artist helps make up for the rapper’s Grammy loss in the best new artist category.\n\nThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes won two awards — action movie and action movie star for Rachel Zegler.\n\nOnly Murders in the Building, The Last of Us and The Kardashians also won two awards each. Only Murders won comedy show and female TV star for Gomez. The Last of Us won drama show and male TV star for Pedro Pascal. The Kardashians won reality show and reality TV star for Khloé Kardashian (who beat sister Kim).\n\nJennifer Aniston presented the Comedy Icon Award to Adam Sandler. Victoria Monét presented the Music Icon Award to Lenny Kravitz, who performed on the show. Lainey Wilson, Kylie Minogue and Natasha Bedingfield also performed.\n\nThere were 45 categories this year representing movies, television, music and pop culture. That includes five new categories: male country artist, female country artist, male Latin artist, female Latin artist and concert tour. Country and Latin were the only music genres with separate categories for men and women. In pop, hip-hop and R&B, men and women competed against each other.\n\nThe 2024 People’s Choice Awards show was produced by Den of Thieves. Jesse Ignjatovic, Evan Prager and Barb Bialkowski executive produced.\n\nHere’s the complete list of nominees, with winners marked.\n\nMusic\n\nMale artist of the year\n\nBad Bunny\n\nDrake\n\nJack Harlow\n\nWINNER: Jung Kook\n\nLuke Combs\n\nMorgan Wallen\n\nPost Malone\n\nThe Weeknd\n\nFemale artist of the year\n\nBeyoncé\n\nDoja Cat\n\nKarol G\n\nLainey Wilson\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nOlivia Rodrigo\n\nWINNER: Taylor Swift\n\nMale country artist of the year\n\nChris Stapleton\n\nCody Johnson\n\nHARDY\n\nWINNER: Jelly Roll\n\nKane Brown\n\nLuke Combs\n\nMorgan Wallen\n\nZach Bryan\n\nFemale country artist of the year\n\nAshley McBryde\n\nCarly Pearce\n\nCarrie Underwood\n\nGabby Barrett\n\nKelsea Ballerini\n\nWINNER: Lainey Wilson\n\nMegan Moroney\n\nShania Twain\n\nMale Latin artist of the year\n\nWINNER: Bad Bunny\n\nBizarrap\n\nFeid\n\nManuel Turizo\n\nMaluma\n\nPeso Pluma\n\nRauw Alejandro\n\nOzuna\n\nFemale Latin artist of the year\n\nÁngela Aguilar\n\nAnitta\n\nBecky G\n\nKali Uchis\n\nKarol G\n\nRosalía\n\nWINNER: Shakira\n\nYoung Miko\n\nPop artist of the year\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nDoja Cat\n\nDua Lipa\n\nJung Kook\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nOlivia Rodrigo\n\nTate McRae\n\nWINNER: Taylor Swift\n\nHip-hop artist of the year\n\nCardi B\n\nDrake\n\nFuture\n\nJack Harlow\n\nLatto\n\nWINNER: Nicki Minaj\n\nPost Malone\n\nTravis Scott\n\nR&B artist of the year\n\nWINNER: Beyoncé\n\nBrent Faiyaz\n\nJanelle Monáe\n\nSZA\n\nTems\n\nThe Weeknd\n\nUsher\n\nVictoria Monét\n\nNew artist of the year\n\nCoi Leray\n\nWINNER: Ice Spice\n\nJelly Roll\n\nJung Kook\n\nNoah Kahan\n\nPeso Pluma\n\nPinkPantheress\n\nStephen Sanchez\n\nGroup/duo of the year\n\nDan + Shay\n\nFuerza Regida\n\nGrupo Frontera\n\nJonas Brothers\n\nOld Dominion\n\nParamore\n\nWINNER: Stray Kids\n\nTOMORROW X TOGETHER\n\nSong of the year\n\nDua Lipa, “Dance the Night”\n\nLuke Combs, “Fast Car”\n\nMiley Cyrus, “Flowers”\n\nGunna, “Fukumean”\n\nTate McRae, “greedy”\n\nMorgan Wallen, “Last Night”\n\nDoja Cat, “Paint the Town Red”\n\nWINNER: Olivia Rodrigo, “Vampire”\n\nAlbum of the year\n\nMiley Cyrus, Endless Summer Vacation\n\nDrake, For All the Dogs\n\nLuke Combs, Gettin’ Old\n\nWINNER: Olivia Rodrigo, Guts\n\nKarol G, Mañana Será Bonito\n\nBad Bunny, Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana\n\nMorgan Wallen, One Thing at a Time\n\nNicki Minaj, Pink Friday 2\n\nCollaboration song of the year\n\nLil Durk Feat.
