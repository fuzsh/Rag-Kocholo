These movies have a space travel concept similar to Interstellar and install the horror element inside it. These movies are extremely thrilling and offer a riveting like never before.\n\nThe first two films are masterpieces in my opinion and the third one from Fincher is good. There are many spinoffs and continuations of these movies now but none can reach the legacy of the old ones. That is why old is always gold!\n\nWatch trailer here\n\n13. Solaris (1972)\n\nIMDb: 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 92%/89%\n\nDirector: Andrei Tarkovsky\n\nWriter: Fridrikh Gorenshtein, Andrei Tarkovsky\n\nCast: Donatas Banionis, Natalya Bondarchuk, Jüri Järvet, Vladislav Dvorzhetsky\n\nRuntime: 2 hours, 46 minutes\n\nSolaris is a Soviet science fiction art film based on Stanisław Lem’s 1961 novel of the same name.

Solaris is a well-told story providing emotional depth to the overly-produced sci-fi movie genre. An eponymous remake of the movie was made in 2002 and received generally positive reviews. However, the audience prefers the original movie over the latter.\n\nWatch trailer here\n\n14.

Most of it was crowdfunded and all the actors are writer-director Shane Carruth’s relatives. The movie looks realistic, depicting a ground-to-earth accidental invention.

Coherence (2013)\n\nIMDb: 7.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 88%/81%\n\nDirector: James Ward Byrkit\n\nWriter: James Ward Byrkit\n\nCast: Emily Foxler, Maury Sterling, Nicholas Brendon\n\nRuntime: 1 hour, 29 minutes\n\nCoherence is a surreal science fiction psychological thriller movie written and directed by James Ward Byrkit (directorial debut).

The meeting goes fine for a time, but strange occurrences take place soon after, leading to panic and confusion.\n\nDirector James Byrkit created the movie without a proper script or dialogue. None of the actors knew each other before the movie and were only told the character’s personalities.

Predestination (2014)\n\nIMDb: 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 84%/75%\n\nDirector: The Spierig Brothers\n\nWriter: The Spierig Brothers\n\nCast: Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, Noah Taylor\n\nRuntime: 1 hour, 37 minutes\n\nAre you aware of that mind-itching question, “What comes first, the egg or the chicken?” Predestination is a science fiction thriller film that tries to answer this question in a rather weird way. The movie focuses on a time-traveling agent equipped with the job of stopping a bomber in the past. They have successfully stopped some of their attacks but don’t know anything about them. The agent suffered burns on his face after unsuccessfully stopping one of the bombings and needed facial reconstruction. Then he goes into the past for another assignment and tries to stop the bomber again.\n\nPredestination is ambitiously directed and is one of a kind. The movie has a linear narrative but feels confusing due to the time-traveling element and complex characters. If you want to watch a film similar to Interstellar with out-of-the-box ideation, Predestination will surely fulfill your hunger.\n\nWatch trailer here\n\n19.

Dick, David Webb Peoples\n\nCast: Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer\n\nRuntime: 1 hour, 57 minutes\n\nRidley Scott is one of the greatest directors to ever grace cinema and he proved that again with his Blade Runner.

This movie was way ahead of its time and the technological advancements shown in this movie are surreal.
