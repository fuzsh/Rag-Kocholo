        "text": "Last week, the GRAMMY Awards were in the news because of an exciting, timely update to one of its 84 categories: Moving forward, Best World Music Album will now be known as the more inclusive Best Global Music Album. While the change might appear subtle to those not familiar with the baggage the term \"world music\" carries, it represents an important honoring of its past and movement towards a more inclusive, adaptive future.\n\nThe new name was decided after extensive conversations with artists, ethnomusicologists and linguists from around the world, who decided it was time to rename it with \"a more relevant, modern, and inclusive term,\" an email sent to Recording Academy members explained.\n\n\"The change symbolizes a departure from the connotations of colonialism, folk and 'non-American' that the former term embodied while adapting to current listening trends and cultural evolution among the diverse communities it may represent.\"\n\nRead on to hear from three international artists about what the new Best Global Music Album name means to them, and why it's more inclusive than \"world music.\"\n\nRead: The 63rd GRAMMYs: Looking Ahead To The 2021 GRAMMY Awards\n\n\"Miriam Makeba used to tell me the expression 'World Music' was a politically correct way of calling our music 'Third World Music,' therefore putting us in a closed box from which it was very difficult to emerge. Now the new name of the category opens the box wide open and allows every dream!\" GRAMMY-winning Beninese singer/songwriter Angélique Kidjo told us. The legendary artist won (what was then called) Best World Music Album at the 2020 GRAMMYs for her Celia Cruz tribute album, Celia, and at the 2016 and 2015 GRAMMYs.\n\nNigerian singer Bankulli, who is featured on Beyoncé's The Lion King: The Gift album, added, \"Global Music provides a more inclusive awards platform to artists from relevant new genres. The term is encompassing of what is happening today and looks to the future for better representation.\"\n\n\"American ethnomusicologist Robert E. Brown coined the term in the early 1960s, but it was later popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category in the media and the music industry intending to encompass different styles of music from outside of the Western world. It is by and large a determination of any type of genre or sound that Westerners consider ethnic, indigenous, folk, or simply non-American music,\" Uproxx explained earlier this year.\n\nAs the Guardian recently noted, \"the term 'world music' was originally coined [in the music business] in the U.K. in 1987 to help market music from non-western artists… Our world music album of the month column was, like the GRAMMYs, renamed global album of the month.\n\nGuardian music critic Ammar Kalia reasoned that the change 'does not answer the valid complaints of the artists and record label founders who have been plagued by catch-all terms. Yet, in the glorious tyranny of endless internet-fueled musical choice, marginalized music still needs championing and signposting in the west.'\"\n\nThe Recording Academy awarded the first Best World Music Album golden gramophone at the 1992 GRAMMYs to Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart for his album Planet Drum. A diverse group of artists, representing many countries and musical styles, including Brazilian bossa nova great Sergio Mendes, Panamanian salsa singer Rubén Blades and South African choir Ladysmith Black Mambazo have also won over the years.\n\n\"Culturally speaking, we are living in a borderless world. Changing our language to better describe and categorize influential music from around the globe allows us to hit a reset button on how we view each other. It allows us to have a better conversation about who we are and where we're headed,\" Marlon Fuentes, Genre Manager, Global Music, New Age and Contemporary Instrumental at the Recording Academy, shared.\n\n\"In my opinion, this moment was symbolic of a new era that connects the past to the future. A signal that we are living in a time where creative people from all over the world are using social media and innovative approaches to overcome clichés and stereotypes by defining their identity on their own terms.\"\n\n\"Global Music is the future of music. As the world continues to become more interconnected, music culture no longer has borders,\" Haitian DJ/producer Michael Brun said. \"The fusion of sounds breeds innovation, and global music artists are at the forefront of that movement. I'm happy to see the Recording Academy working to adapt to the changing landscape and celebrate excellence from around the globe.\"\n\nRelated: Haiti's Michael Brun Talks Debut LP 'LOKAL,' Friendship With J Balvin & Diplo & His Legacy As Global Artist\n\nThis summer, the Recording Academy announced updates to the names and rules for four other categories, which included renaming Best Urban Contemporary Album to Best Progressive R&B Album. Conversations around nixing the term \"urban music,\" an umbrella category encompassing traditionally Black genres like R&B and rap, came to the forefront in 2020 following the deep reckoning with racism in American and beyond. Major labels, including Universal Music Group, including affiliates Warner Music Group and Republic Records, have dropped the term.\n\nAs Billboard notes, the Best Global Music Album rename follows a similar change implemented at the 2020 Academy Awards—Best Foreign Language Film was updated to Best International Feature Film. South Korean director Bong Joon-ho won for his widely celebrated 2019 film Parasite.\n\nThe 2021 GRAMMY nominees for Best Global Music Album—along with the other 83 categories—will be announced on Nov. 24. The 2021 GRAMMY Awards and Premiere Ceremony will take place on Jan. 31, 2021, when all the big winners will be revealed.\n\nGet To Know The 2020 Latin GRAMMYs Album Of The Year Nominees | 2020 Latin GRAMMY Awards\n\nOn Aug. 14, the group will kick off a 77-date tour through the U.S., Europe, and India, featuring both headlining sets and support for Khruangbin. Suryakant Sawhney and multi-instrumentalist Kartik Sundareshan Pillai spoke with GRAMMY.com about creating BETA, the state of rock bands in India, and more.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nTell us a bit about the seeds that were planted that led to this new record.\n\nSuryakant Sawhney: We had a specific recording session, which I think really jumpstarted the whole process. We all lived in Goa for the last few years, and there was this one little house we rented out; this old, 2-300-year old little cottage, which was owned by a priest. I was trying to do a film shoot or a music video shoot or something, and it just sounded great and looked beautiful.\n\nSo we decided to rent it from the church. We landed up there at 2, 3 a.m., set up for a few hours, and I think recorded a bunch of music for five, six hours 'til the dawn.\n\nKartik Sundareshan Pillai: I think it's that recording space. Later on, [we went to] Joshua Tree and there's another recording studio over there that we worked at for two weeks. Plus, just having a bunch of songs that we knew were going to fit together.\n\nHow was the vibe out in Joshua Tree?\n\nPillai: Yeah, that was pretty incredible. Rabbits and cherries. It was a very, very, very pretty place.\n\nAnd take us into the writing of the record a little bit. How does that work with you guys?\n\nSawhney: There's basically three different ways we go about writing a song. One will be, one of the songwriters — in most cases, it's me right now — I'll bring a song which is more than half finished in terms of arrangement, writing lyrics, where the song space is. Then the rest of the band joins in and we try to finish it.\n\nThen there's something which is far more spare, and then everybody just takes a go at it, like adding parts. And then the third variation, there's almost nothing, which is rarer. We’re very much a songwriter-driven project.\n\nThen it takes years to just come to terms with it, make our peace with it, because we also produce it ourselves. We get into this unholy cycle of making it, hating it, wasting our time, then re-recording it, then looking back and being like, \"Oh, that was good enough. Why dont it again?\" Finally, at the end of the day, you settle with what you have.\n\nI was reading a 'Variety' interview with you guys last year and they called you “One of the last few remaining bands in India.” That was a year ago. What's the landscape in your slice of the country right now as far as indie and guitar music?\n\nPillai: I think it's more electronic [music happening], but there are lots of bands now slowly coming back. There was one period of time where there was almost nothing, and then now they're starting to kind of pop up here and there, like Donraj, All Parks Are Green. Pacifist.\n\nThen there's some friends of ours who also have makeshift bands. There's another band called Nigambodh.\n\nSawhney: Who makes a living off being a band? I would say at this point, [there are] very few left.\n\nKind of the same in America, to be honest. What precipitated interest kicking up, or the number of bands kicking up in the last year or so?\n\nPillai: Boredom, I guess.\n\nSawhney: I think it's just that every new generation has to make the same mistake and figure out this is not a very economically viable process. They don't realize it because being a band is initially so cool, or it feels good, then it gets complicated.\n\nThere's a lot of hip-hop being made right now in India. It's finally caught up here. And there's little electronic music. I think people who make bands always will definitely for a while be more marginal in the music scene, just because it's such a labor-intensive process, as compared to the other forms of music.\n\nRead more: The Evolution Of Bollywood Music In 10 Songs: From \"Awaara Hoon\" To \"Naatu Naatu\"\n\nI also perform as an electronic musician, and I can tell you that's just easier. I go on stage with my mic and my DJ console and everything, and I'm basically doing karaoke. All of that is just so simple compared to being in a band, which is a labor-intensive, economic-intensive life-intensive process. It's a real gamble.\n\nWhat has Peter Cat Recording Co. done to engender that resilience, as a band, but also a business?\n\nSawhney: I think we've definitely had moments where it looked really bleak and difficult, and something lucky happens. We also persevered. We did a lot of it ourselves initially and we still do, in terms of learning how to record ourselves, make our own videos, produce ourselves, managing the whole thing. We learned how to produce the music ourselves at a very early stage, and that made us self-sufficient.\n\nPillai: Songwriting to recording, to producing, mixing, mastering, artwork — literally everything we did learn. Eventually we got management and we also got lucky with labels and people approaching us.\n\nCan you talk about crafting the sound of the new record, or how you wanted it to come across from a production standpoint?\n\nSawhney: At least in the production aspect, I think there's a bit more experimentation in terms of bringing in non-classically band sounds, moving away from just a guitar-driven thing. There's a lot more sample electronic music, hip-hop related elements. That just comes from the fact that we make multiple kinds of music individually. The band is sort of just one of our things and it becomes something we bring to the band and it adds up slowly.\n\nSome songs just take on a life of their own that way. From my angle, there was definitely a concerted effort to move away from the older sound of Bismillah. I was hoping that there are some instances in the new album where you could sit down and be like, I'm not sure what this is, and still preserve the fact that it's enjoyable and accessible at some point.\n\nMaking something new now is this concerted process you have to take. You mix your own culture with what you learned outside your own culture, and you start making these new mutants sort of songs. [The trick is] how to make them sound sincere in a way, without just forcing it.\n\nPillai: In the songs that I ended up writing, they just come in some kind of burst. For one of the songs, how we actually ended up composing it was [keyboard/trumpet player Rohit] Gupta played the keyboard separately. I went in an hour later when I had woken up and I just sang to what he had already played; that's pretty much already 70 percent the song. I mostly just tend to go with that first moment of inspiration, just follow it through.\n\nAny MVP moments from your bandmates that you'd like to shout out on the record?\n\nSawhney: Some of them were in Joshua Tree. I think after the last tour we did in America, we had some great moments of [working] on something on the spot.\n\nPillai: [On \"Just Another Love Song\"], Suryakant and [bassist Dhruv] Bhola, just played it through. I think we took one take of this song. It was completely fine and we just kept it.\n\nAwesome. And what do you guys have coming up? What would you like to plug?\n\nSawhney: We have that new album apparently. And then we have a tour coming up, an elaborate, long, drawn-out tour. We'll go to America, we'll go to Europe and we'll end in India in December. And I think in the meantime, we'll be making some more videos. We'll be doing the standard stuff right now and hopefully by the end we'll twist into something more unnecessary.\n\nWhere do you see your regional scene going in the next five, 10 years? What trajectory is it on?\n\nPillai: Not really a cohort. It's just a bunch of bands. The indie scene by itself has been getting bigger ever since 2007, or the '90s even. [I'd expect] more festivals, just more stuff happening in general. Five, 10 years, it should just be bigger,\n\nSawhney: Bands I don't see going anywhere. I think hip-hop will reach some sort of crescendo. Electronic music is always going to do okay because I think rich people really enjoy it in India. I don't know if that's pessimistic, but that's kind how it works.\n\nPillai: I think everything's going to be fine.\n\nDo you have a favorite song on 'BETA'?\n\nPillai: I believe it was the third song, \"Suddenly.\" But it all flows nicely. What's your favorite song?\n\nSawhney: \"Beautiful Life,\" because I hate my life. [Chuckles lightly.] So it's nice to write a song about a better life.\n\nWith reporting by Morgan Enos and Jessica Lipsky\n\nIt’s been ten years since you broke out with the massive hit \"Johnny.\" Back then, African pop music was relatively unknown in America. Since then, African artists have gained global recognition. Do you see yourself as a pioneer for the current Afropop movement?\n\nI agree with you 100 percent, there is no way you authentically go through the history of, you know, building a bridge between Africa and the rest of the world via music without mentioning a song like \"Johnny.\" It's definitely an honor for me to be the vessel that delivers such amazing music to the world. Of course, there were people way before me who also did the same thing. We're talking about Fela [Kuti]. We're talking about King Sunny Ade. At the end of the day, yes, music is metamorphosing into so much more. And definitely, I'm a pioneer [laughs].\n\nYou have a strong sense of storytelling, especially in your music videos. \"Johnny\" has an entire storyline about a news reporter investigating a womanizer. How important is that kind of storytelling to your music?\n\nStorytelling is a big part of my artistry, because I feel everybody loves a good story. I find that even when I'm writing most times in the studio, there's always a picture I'm trying to paint, and it only makes sense for the visuals to kind of match that most of the time. Except sometimes we decide to make it a performance video because I just feel like dancing.\n\nWhat’s the most memorable video you’ve ever done?\n\nEvery one of my videos has taken a lot of pain, sweat, and even some tears. But I think \"Johnny\" is such a masterpiece, because it resonated with the entire world, and Africa especially. And it pretty much helped me to stay on my way through the industry, because it became my identity. That song and that video was the platform for the brand and everything that I am today. you know, so that is definitely the most memorable, in a good way.\n\nYou've traveled to and performed in America several times in your career. What's your overall impression?\n\nI think I've done four or five American tours. And yo, America is so big [laughs]. My first American tour had me in shambles, because of the flights. I didn't realize that to go from one city to another, I might have to connect once or twice depending on how far I'm going. So the flights had me in shambles, but the energy of the people? Oh my days, lit! America is definitely one of my favorite places. I’m always reminding my agents to make sure that they include American cities on my tours, which is why even for the album listening parties for Rebel Queen, we did the first one in Paris, then London, and then we had to come to New York as well. And then just yesterday, we had one in Lagos as well.\n\nSince you first became popular, a lot of Afrobeats artists have gained a following abroad like Burna Boy and WizKid. It seems as though, at least looking at the artists that break outside of Africa, that the genre is still very male-dominated. Do you agree with that? And do you think there’s potential for more female artists to break out internationally?\n\nHonestly, when I started out, the odds were really way more against women than they are right now, in that, there were female artists sprouting maybe once every two years, or once every year, and barely hanging around long enough. But now, the story is different. And I give kudos to all the women before me and all the women with me. Yes, in a male dominated society, it seems as though my male counterparts get their roses and their flowers for a second. And you know, once in a while someone comes back and remembers, \"Oh, there's Yemi Alade.\" Do you know what I mean?\n\nI was speaking to someone earlier today and I was saying, I think what surprises me the most is that, I feel like there are no expectations of female artists. So like, if we do or we don't, people are just moving on. But I'm not the one to play victim, never. Despite the odds, you see that the females continue to be resilient, because we know. I know deep within that my existence is definitely of value to so many people out there.\n\nWhat do you think of the upcoming generation of talent like Tems and Ayra Starr and Tyla, who recently won the first GRAMMY Award for Best African Music Performance for \"Water?\"\n\nExceptional, exceptional artists. As you just mentioned, they're doing amazingly well. And, you know, these women are unique in their own ways. And I want to just say that I believe it's just the starting point for them. There's so much to come. And there's so many other females that are still en route to greatness.\n\nHow have you seen the music industry in Africa evolve? And what sorts of challenges do you think African musicians face today?\n\nI personally feel like, with all the momentum that Afrobeats has got, we need authentic platforms that can actually check the streaming numbers that are coming in for music, especially within Africa. Because at the moment it’s mostly Apple, Spotify, etc. But there are other platforms here in Africa that most Africans use, and they have more of a database compared to Apple and Spotify. We've come to a point where we need to have more credible numbers, because there's millions of people streaming music in Africa that are not on those platforms.\n\nSo you think that these local platforms need to be counted alongside Apple and Spotify?\n\n100 percent. In Nigeria there’s two: Audiomack and Boomplay. Boomplay is a big deal.\n\nYou’re going on a decade in the industry. In all that time, what's one moment or one achievement that gives you the greatest sense of accomplishment? What are you most proud of in your career?\n\nThat’s a big question…I think I have an idea, because there've been so many moments in my life and in my career that have aligned with my dreams coming true. Number one is each time that I'm approached by a complete stranger and the stranger tells me \"Oh my God, Yemi. You don't know what your music has done for me. Your music has gotten me through so much grief.\" Some people walk up to me and tell me that they just had the biggest struggle in their life and they listen to my music, and it always sends them into a realm of joy and happiness. Honestly, I feel accomplished in those moments, because when I record my music, I always say, the thing I'm trying to spread through my music the most is love, joy and happiness. So to have people testify to that, it means to me that the magic is complete, that my job is actually effective. So that makes me feel very accomplished.\n\nOn a personal note, an accomplishment that I am most grateful to is the fact that I'm always able to comfortably take care of my family. It's something that I would never play down. You know, I'm just grateful to God for that.\n\nAnd lastly, aside from winning a GRAMMY through Angelique Kidjo — you know, I've met a lot of amazing people, and Beyoncé is one of them. So at the end of the day, it's a full circle moment for me. I'm just enjoying the ride.\n\nYou know, it’s funny you mentioned Beyoncé, I was just about to ask you what it was like to work with her.\n\nOh my days — wow, working with her, it was such an experience for myself and my team. It was like, we're literally awake, walking in the dreams that we have dreamt for so long.The process of her team contacting us was a bit weird, because my management didn't realize that Parkwood [Entertainment] was a real company, that they were emailing them and talking about Beyoncé. They assumed that it was some kind of scam artist. But when they had sent it to me, I was like \"What? Parkwood? Who doesn’t know Parkwood is Beyoncé?\"\n\nSo it turned out that it was for real, and we went to L.A. where the studio was, and I lost my voice for 24 hours — I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t sing. I just soaked up all the vitamin C's and hot teas and Throat Coats I could get. I managed to regain a little bit of my voice back and that's what I was able to record that day. That was a miracle for me. But one of the most memorable moments was actually meeting her in person. After the album, Lion King, came out, the movie was being premiered in London, and I happened to be in London at that time. We had met her in person, we met Jay Z. It was such a full circle moment. Honestly, that lady has really touched my life in a way that I will never forget. Because she could have lived her life without doing what she did, but she decided to reach out to people she felt were pillars of African music and pay homage to Africa. And I'm happy to have been part of that moment."
