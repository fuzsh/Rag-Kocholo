Inventing Ireland had as its main focus the authors of the Irish Revival 1885– 1940 (with some treatment of appropriate texts from the postlude). Irish Classics dealt with classic authors who wrote in both the Irish and English languages from the crisis of Gaelic Ireland in 1600, through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, down to the period of high modernism. After Ireland begins with a reading of a work from the mid-century, Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, and brings the story up to the present moment. It has a central contention: that the birth of the new state signalled the slow end of the national project and that this decline (always a worry, especially to writers of northern background) became conclusive in the years following the economic crash of 2008. The available forms of the state proved unable to contain or embody the very idealistic ambitions of the nation. Yet, as political hopes of sovereignty were annulled, culture became in many ways more important than ever, as a means of alerting people to the crisis and of embodying the unstilled longing for expressive freedom. The gradual expiry of the national project has been chronicled in a range of powerful works, which address major questions: the ix\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nfortunes of the native language and of religious institutions, the conflict in the north, secularization and women’s rights, political and economic sovereignty. There are many fine writers who explore these themes, but I have chosen to focus on certain texts in which the issues are centrally raised. Many other works by writers treated here and by other major authors could have been included, but I hope to return to these on another occasion. Over the past two decades, students have taught me to read and re-read texts as an ‘early warning system’ concerning problems which became obvious in journalism of more recent times, but also as a sort of elegy for the invented Ireland of the Revivalists and Classicists. The intention was not to rebut or withdraw the theses of the two earlier volumes, but to sharpen their analysis of culture as the site and stake of the search for expressive freedom. The national project has gone through many moments of despondency and near-death experiences, as was shown in Irish Classics – the Flight of the Earls in 1607, the defeat at Aughrim in 1691, the Union with Britain in 1801, the Great Hunger of the 1840s and the waves of emigration thereafter – but in the past it has always survived in new modes of self-assertion. The inventors of Revival Ireland confronted similar fears that it would disappear, under the blandishments of parliament at Westminster or in the trenches of the Somme or in the fires of civil war: yet somehow, on each occasion, a phoenix arose from the ashes. Since independence, there have been various crises of the Free State and Republic – censorship of intellectuals, economic stagnation, further emigration and an apparent reluctance to marry among many who remained. This is not to mention the very differ­ ent existential crises triggered by the Second World War, by the Troubles in the North, and by the widespread fear at the end of the century that ‘the most globalized country in Europe’ had lost its identity. None of the writers considered here has ever announced the final failure of the national project, but many have believed that x\n\nP r e fa c e\n\n(to borrow a phrase of Salman Rushdie) their country had been insufficiently imagined. Their writings have been often inspired by their critique of these derelictions and by their impatience with many forms of traditional nationalism. Like the texts produced by Revivalists, their work offered not only a strict diagnosis but also vital hints of a way forward. In its more familiar guises the national project might be ebbing: but the account of an ending (as was shown in Irish Classics) always contains within itself the narrative of a new dispensation. Emergency is not an ignoble condition: it may even be the state of mind in which every postcolonial people has to live. I am grateful to many students and colleagues who led me through the discussions that follow, whether at University College Dublin or at the University of Notre Dame, at Sorbonne 3 or at Cambridge University: P. J. Mathews, Derek Hand, Noreen Doody, Jarlath Killeen, Wanda Balzano, Zeljka Doljanin, Stanley van der Ziel, Graham Price, Jana Fischerova, Jeff Holdridge, Malcolm Sen, Katherine O’Callaghan, Enrico Terrinoni, Chiara Lucarelli, Diana Perez Garcia, Heather Laird, Ron Callan, Brendan Kennelly, John Kerrigan, Paddy Ward, Brian Donnelly, Tony Roche, Frank McGuinness, Christopher Fox, Kevin Whelan, Barry McCrea, Jill Wharton, Dan Murphy, Guinn Batten, Oonagh Young, Christine Breen, Alan Graham, Aoife Lynch, Catherine Wilsdon, Andrea Binelli, Carle Bonafous-Murat, Fergal Casey, Bríona NicDhiarmada, Diarmuid Ó Giolláin, Mary O’Callaghan, Sarah McKibben, Brian Ó Conchubhair, Niall McArdle, Nathaniel Myers, Ailbhe Darcy, Kara Donnelly, Lindsay Haney, Ray Ryan, Rónán McDonald, David Clare, Nelson Ó Ceallaigh Ritschel, Fearghal Whelan, and John Sitter. I owe major debts to my translators Futoshi Sakauchi and Gerardo Gambolini for wonderful discussion and comradeship. My dead friends Edward Said, John McGahern and Brian Friel gave many kinds of guidance as well as inspiration. xi\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nI must thank Seán Ó Mórdha, Vivien Igoe, Edna O’Brien, Joseph O’Connor, Robert Ballagh, Richard Kearney, Lucy McDiarmid, Bernadette Comerford, Stephen Rea, Fiach Mac Conghail, Aideen Howard, Aedín Clements, Lyn Grimes, Alan Tongue, Barry McGovern, Theo Dorgan, Paula Meehan, Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin, Harry Clifton, Gary Murphy, Gabriel Fitzmaurice and Dillon Johnston for the privilege of working with them on many projects. I am grateful to Kevin Whelan for welcoming me to O’Connell House and for making it a centre of friendship and scholarly endeavour. This is not the first occasion on which I thank Máire Doyle for immense assistance, both scholarly and technical, in the production of a text. The kindness of Lisa Caulfield and her colleagues at University of Notre Dame has been unfailing. To Neil Belton, Ellen Parnavelas and Clémence Jacquinet at Head of Zeus, to Stephen Gilbert, and to Lindsay Waters and Joy Deng at Harvard University Press goes my appreciation for their work in taking on and much improving this text, as they did with its predecessors. My debt to Neil goes back many decades: without his encouragement and kindness, I would not have written this trilogy. Years of friendship, great fun and wise counsel mean that I should, once again, thank President Michael D. Higgins and his wife, Sabina; they will disagree with much of what follows but understand, I trust, why it is necessary to say it: ‘pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will’. I am deeply grateful to my brother Damian Kiberd for his illuminating commentaries on the Irish economy; and to my sister Marguerite Lynch for her analyses of many of the themes covered in these pages. Most of the following chapters were written at the Tyrone Guthrie Centre in Annaghmakerrig. Its director, Robbie McDonald, and its wonderful staff have created a house conducive to creation but also to good fellowship and laughter. The late literary editor of the Irish Times, Caroline Walsh, kindly published my essay titled ‘After Ireland’ in August 2009, in the course of which many of the xii\n\nP r e fa c e\n\nfollowing arguments were rehearsed. Her death has been a great loss not only to her loving family and friends but to all literary workers in Ireland. My wife, Beth, has been, as ever, the subtlest of all interlocutors on the matter of Ireland (and much else too). My children, Lucy, Amy and Rory, have at times rebuked me for lamenting lost worlds but they have also shown me that nothing is ever completely gone – everything is merely translated into some new form. In their lives, as in the work of the authors treated here, I have found the basis of a strange kind of hope. The lyric phase of nation-building, in which their ancestors participated so nobly, is surely over; but in the capacity of young people to offer a vision of an alternative future lies the hope of a renewed community. I have dedicated the book to the memory of their grandmother Eithne. When Inventing Ireland was published, she objected strenuously to the title, insisting that ‘Ireland was always there’. What she might have to say about the current title can be easily imagined. But I cannot help noticing that the years of her life coincided almost exactly with the existence of a sovereign and independent nation. Declan Kiberd Clontarf, Dublin April 2017\n\nxiii\n\n‘. . . life has been preserved here, but at a price that is more costly than the value of life itself, because the strength for defence and survival has been borrowed from future generations, who are born in debt and weighed down by it. In that struggle what has survived is the bare instinct for survival, while life itself has lost so much that little more than its name is left. What remains standing and endures is mutilated or distorted, and what is born and comes into being is poisoned and embittered at conception. The thoughts and words of the people are never completed, because they have been cut off at their roots. . .’ Ivo Andric´ We all die for Ireland in the end, whether sooner or later. I’ll die myself for Ireland one of the days. Paula Meehan\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. Introduction: After Ireland?\n\nI\n\nn 1997, it was reported that the gross domestic product in the Republic of Ireland had surpassed that of Britain. There was no rejoicing in the streets at this news, and little comment on the airwaves; the people were too busy making money and buying or selling houses. Ten years later, the phenomenon known as the ‘Celtic Tiger’ was dead. After a building boom in which government had granted per­ mission for 180,000 units, of which 100,000 remained unoccupied, the country was bankrupt. With loans from overseas banks, the Irish had merrily bought and sold real estate from and to one another.1 Money and people had flowed into the country for a decade. As the ratio of dependents to earners dropped to an all-time low, the place had boomed: average house prices had risen in Dublin by up to 500% in the previous decade, with more than one in five workers involved in construction. Then the bubble burst. Shares in one major bank fell by a half in a single session. Under pressure from overseas financiers, the minister for finance guaranteed the bondholders and the debts incurred by a small number of Irish bankers were passed on to the people. A bondholder in New York who had failed to get 1\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nhis bank to buy back his bonds at 50% woke up on 30 September 2008 to the amazing news that they were again worth 100%. ‘And’, in the words of Michael Lewis, ‘the promise sank Ireland’.2 Future generations would have to pay off the monies owing. Young people headed for the exit ports, shaking their heads in disbelief. The narrative of the nation had come to a juddering halt, but on this occasion the challenge to it did not come from Britain. In fact, the parliament at Westminster voted €6 billion in aid to their stricken neighbours. This immiseration of the Irish was negotiated by German and French financiers, urged on by Timothy Geithner of the United States. The debts run up by Irish financial houses were based on loans which had been given by foreign bankers themselves. The more general attempt by the leaders of the European Union to ‘save the Euro’ was jeopardizing the very European project itself, as Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain were plunged into a period of austerity. In 1916, leaders of an Irish insurrection had looked to ‘gallant allies in Europe’ 3 for support and solace; but the new masters of Europe in Frankfurt, Paris and Brussels turned out to be strange friends indeed. There had always been uncertainty as to how much sovereignty a small nation could enjoy in a globalizing world. Even after political independence in 1922, Ireland remained highly dependent on the neighbouring island for markets and materials, and as a source of employment. Accession to the European Economic Community in 1973 had opened a new axis to great continental cities, but it called for a surrender of much of that sovereignty so hard-won in the years leading up to 1922. Ireland might wield an influence out of all proportion to its size at the ever-expanding councils of the European Union, but that power was inevitably curtailed. When a single market was created in 1987, Irish politicians were given about £6 billion to bring voters to accept the measure, but some acerbic commentators wondered what their leaders had surrendered that could possibly be worth so much.4 The independence project had 2\n\nIntroduction\n\nnot generated the levels of wealth expected in 1922. Writing in the wake of the Single European Act, the agronomist Raymond Crotty demonstrated that one in every two persons born in the state since independence had been compelled to emigrate.5 For some years in the 1990s and early 2000s, these questions had been stilled. By 2008 it was clear that the youth of Ireland (and of other peripheral countries with little economic clout but rich cultural tradition) was being ‘disappeared’ by unelected bureau­ crats. Up to 60,000 emigrated in the following year, as the deeper underlying pattern detected by Crotty re-emerged. Most people were astounded by the immensity of the crash when it came. Apart from a few isolated economists, nobody had predicted it or seen any sign of its coming. In the years after 2008, commentators arraigned bankers for failure, politicians for stupidity, clergy for abusing children and foreigners for taking cynical advantage of them. They insisted, in their innocence, that nobody had alerted them to the dire underlying abuses. Nobody had warned them that their very country was in danger of disappearance. But this was not so. In every decade after independence, writers and artists had given warnings about these things. Writers in particular had suggested, even during the birth-pangs of the Free State, that the country might have been stillborn. During Easter Week 1916 a Dublin businessman named William Beckett brought his son Samuel up the Three Rock Mountain, from which vantage point they could view the city burning below. Being a quantity surveyor by trade, Bill Beckett rubbed his hands at the prospect of lucrative business opportunities when the bombed-out central parts of Dublin would come to be rebuilt. But the ten-year-old Sam was horrified by the sight.6 Perhaps the sensitive boy had intuited that the birth of a nation might also seal its doom. Years later the central protagonist of his novel Murphy (1938) – ‘the ruins of the ruins of a broth of a boy’ 7 – is identified at his post-mortem by a naevus on his buttock: his 3\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nbirthmark becomes in effect his deathmark. The most famous Irish writer at the time of the Rising, W. B. Yeats, had sensed this too: though moved by the bravery of the rebel forces, he feared that all the cultural work of the previous decades, in establishing a national theatre and reviving a dying language, might come to nothing. All across Europe, in the years of the First World War, militarism was undoing the hopes of a generation of modern artists – and so it was in Ireland. At the mercy of the immediate moment, Yeats could not see it as part of the renaissance he had led: rather he saw it as a brutal interruption of the cultural project. This had been the catastrophist view taken by many writers at the outbreak of the war. Writing to Howard Sturgis on 5 August 1914, Henry James had lamented: ‘to have to take it all now for what the treacherous years were all the while really making for and meaning is too tragic for words’.8 Five days later, in a letter to Rhoda Broughton, James wrote that they both ‘should have been spared this wreck of our belief that through the long years we had seen civilisation grown and the worst become impossible’.9 Implicit in such lamentation was a recognition that militarism may have been an effect of, as well as an interruption to, elements of the modernist project. Yeats would surmount his shock at the arbitrary, capricious nature of the Easter Rising, reconfiguring it as part of a wider narrative of the cultural revival it had seemed to undo: Did that play of mine send out Certain men the English shot?10\n\nHis complex poem about the event, ‘Easter 1916’, goes well beyond any facile celebration into a mode of elegy for doomed youth, rather like the poems that mourned a brave officer cadre dying for England as it went ‘over the top’ in the Great War. Even though it was written a matter of weeks after the execution of the rebel leaders, 4\n\nIntroduction\n\nYeats’s poem would become for many one of the earliest explanations of the felt mediocrity of the post-war world. The worship of a lost generation of geniuses became a convenient way of escaping from the disappointments of the present, especially in a land where civil war soured any possible pleasures of independence. It was the bleakness rather than the exhilaration of freedom which struck most writers in the 1920s and 1930s. The lyric phase of nation building was over. Writers, who had felt themselves key inventors of Ireland, now found themselves among its first victims, as the limitless dreams of a nation took on the rather compromised form of an inherited, shop-soiled state. No writer is ever exactly like a country’s official idea of itself, so it was likely that the militarists who assumed power in uncertain circumstances in 1922 would treat free-thinking artists with suspicion. The ‘literary wing of the movement’ had been useful (up to a point) in mapping out ideas of independence, but now was treated, more often than not, as a damned nuisance. The sheer energy expended in dislodging the British had left little for the reimagining of Ireland by the new elites. In 1929, the government introduced a Censorship of Publications Act under whose aegis many of the masterpieces of global modern­ ism and of Irish writing would be banned. Unlike the top-down censorship being introduced in Soviet Russia and other autocratic states, the Irish practice was bottom-up. Less political than religiose in character, it required a citizen to file a complaint that a book was indecent, obscene or supportive of unnatural methods of contraception.11 The earnings of Irish writers had been precarious enough, given the small size of the reading public, but censorship deprived authors of even that curtailed livelihood. Even before the 1929 act, some revival intellectuals had sensed a closing down of possibilities. Stephen MacKenna, the Gaelic League activist and translator of Plotinus, had decamped to England; the English composer Arnold Bax (who had once written folk stories under the Irish pen-name of Dermot O’Byrne) went back to his own country. 5\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nMany more artists would leave. The 1929 legislation was crucial: it was as if the nation-state was intent on self-harm, even selfmutilation. It was cutting off one of the major supply lines which had made independence possible. If every word was once a poem before being denatured by common use, then each sentence may also be a kind of epitaph on an emotion. In an analogous way, a nation state may be an elegy for a language, a secondary institutional formation designed to fill the void left by a lost language and by the structures of feeling which disappeared along with it. The terminal decline of Ireland had begun with the Act of Union in 1801 – the clearance of cottiers, already in train, served to dismantle a carnivalesque culture, one which had been filled with diverse voices and libertarian attitudes.12 The Great Famine of 1845–9 was the lethal blow – more lethal than any previous shock – because it revealed Gaelic Ireland for the shell it was. A people who had lost their cultural coding had few values left in whose name to combat austerity and want. They had surrendered too much, as they would again and again – they had shown too great a talent for adjustment. They had placed their faith in one economic reality (the potato) and that monoculture had failed them. Never again would they show such a trust in natural forces; never again would they feel fully at home in natural surroundings. But they would afterwards place a similarly naive trust in other entities – in 1922 the nation state, later the Catholic Church, and later still house ownership. Many of the subsequent cruelties in Irish life have ultimate roots in the Great Famine. The abuse of children, which most often has a cyclical quality (with abusers having been abused) could go right back, at least in part, to years of privation. It may also be traceable to an enforced sexual puritanism and an exaltation of celibacy, both of which were intensified by the shock of the Famine and the elaboration of a narrow, rule-bound form of religion, which seemed an early example of a ‘utopia’ of bureaucracy replacing the notion of 6\n\nIntroduction\n\nan all-watching, all-caring godhead. The casual insults inflicted upon one another by a people trapped in a subsistence economy may also arise from an acute social frustration. The extraordinary linguistic resourcefulness shown by people keen to abuse one another in their newly acquired language may have roots in the shame of its very use: That’s the idea. Let’s insult one another. . .13\n\nThe rapid language-shift must have left many people marooned in a no-man’s-land between codes. They spoke words in English while thinking in the cadences and syntax of a receding Irish; and many people felt, for a painful period, articulate in neither. The loss of old ways was often imaged in the person of a dumb or stuttering child, and in a perhaps linked violence against children (not just for the economic burden which they represented but for visibly bearing the stigmata of a community’s painful adjustment to the future). The experience was narrated by a ruined Gaelic poet, Aindrias Mac Marcais, as far back as the 1590s: Gan gáire fá ghníomhra leinbh; Cosc ar cheol, glas ar Ghaeilge. Without laughter at the antics of a child; Music banned, Irish censored. 14\n\nSo the culture of control and interdiction practised after 1929 in the Free State had a rather ancient lineage. And the anxieties of a society unsure about whether it even had a viable future often discharged themselves through the figure of a confused, apologetic, furtive child. If your education teaches you not to see but to look away from your setting, then your surroundings will soon begin to seem unvital and unreal. The forgetting of geography – as in the case of Beckett’s tramps – soon abets the forgetting of history: 7\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nYesterday. In my opinion. . . I was here. . . yesterday (WG 67)\n\nThis uncertainty in relating to an environment arose from a tragedy of land holding: those who owned the land could never fully see it, and those who could see it were never the ones who owned it. What had once been a notable weakness in landlords of the nine­teenth century now began to characterize the behaviour of the new peasant proprietors: an obsession with land ownership rather than land use. The strong farmers who dominated in the Free State had learned even before independence to imitate the less admirable features of colonialist behaviour: walking their farmlands, they looked down on landless labourers, nomads and tinkers; they adopted a monoglot philosophy of language; they practised a lazy pastoralism rather than an intensive cultivation of the land; and they repressed instinctual life. The middle-class Catholic Church which eventually replaced the old vernacular religion was really the old landlordism in drag – the presbytery was the new big house, its priest the surrogate landlord and his rule akin to the traditional droit de seigneur (even including the sexual abuse of the young). The crude moralism (it was hardly a theology) developed by the priesthood in the nineteenth century and after was similar to the old repression, the remedy for the recalcitrant being a sound thrashing (‘spare the rod and spoil the child’). So the triumph of institutional Catholicism was in fact another delayed and occluded victory for the process of anglicization. The ‘young dandies’ who graduated from the national seminar at Maynooth had been taught through English and that was the language a haughty priesthood generally employed, as a way of marking self-worth. English culture thus made some of its greatest gains just as it prepared to give Ireland up – and this was paradoxical in the sense that it was happening against a backdrop in which major attempts were being made to revive Irish and restore Gaelic culture. But even the great literary feats of the Irish Revival in English, as pioneered 8\n\nIntroduction\n\nby Yeats and others, may be seen in retrospect as a final, long-delayed triumph of the textuality brought by the Protestant Reformation to Ireland. Sir William Wilde had argued that the best way of combating superstitions was to write them down, and this was what the revivalists did. So deeply did the new Catholicism take on a number of the contours of the Reformation faith that William Wilde, father of Oscar, could remark with some satisfaction in the later nineteenth century that the tone of the country was becoming more Protestant with every passing year.15 Even as the Anglo-Irish lost much of their land in a succession of agrarian reforms, the hold of anglophone culture was tightening, as a narrow, rule-bound moralism took the place of vernacular Catholicism, which had already in many places submitted to a middle-class notion of ‘respectable behaviour’ in the decades before and after Emancipation in 1829. That moralism sought to regulate the conduct of people’s relationships with one another, whereas the old religion had emphasized their relationships with fate, destiny and the divine. Some of the more artistic souls who had grown up in this rather Victorian scheme of public moralism finally rebelled against it. W. B. Yeats once complained of the novelist George Eliot: ‘If she had more religion, she would have less morals. The moral impulse and the religious destroy each other in most cases.’ 16 In Yeats’s ideal church there would be an altar but no pulpit. Had he lived to witness the collapse of institutional Catholicism in Ireland of the later twentieth century, he would have seen in it a predictable end to rule-bound moralism – and the hope of returning to a more visionary kind of religion. The fitful attempts to revive Irish after the foundation of the Gaelic League in 1893 sometimes reconnected people to a more rooted set of traditions. The yearning of women for romantic love and an end to economic match-making, which colours many of the Love Songs of Connacht (1894), made Douglas Hyde’s collection a best-seller through the years of the Irish Revival; but its tones of longing can 9\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nstill be heard over six decades later in another best-seller (albeit one banned for some time), The Country Girls (1960), by Edna O’Brien. More often than not, however, revivalists of Irish simply poured a prim Victorian moralism into Gaelic vessels. A people who in the 1830s had thought in Irish while using English words had by the 1890s learned to think in English while using Irish words. The result was what Samuel Beckett would castigate in a devastating essay of 1934 as ‘the altitudinous complacency of the “Victorian Gael” ’.17 Told in this way, the story of modern Ireland can hardly register 1922 as the moment of liberation. Nationalism (at least in twentysix counties) did triumph over empire, but only when it seemed safe for the imperial functionaries to quit. The colony had been so comprehensively penetrated that the new rulers could be trusted to employ all the old categories upon themselves. During the civil war, Michael Collins borrowed from the British army for use against his new enemies some of those very guns which had been used to fire on him and his comrades in 1916. After the Rising, republican prisoners in English jails had with rare exceptions refused Colm Ó Gaora’s offer to teach them Irish.18 As early as 1917, Ó Gaora had deduced that, whenever these colleagues assumed power in a new state, their use of Irish would be strictly symbolic. Irish was useful, in the judgement of an emergent elite, to reinforce the claim to a separatist identity: but the arduous learning of it could be left to children. So the ritual cúpla focal at the start or close of a long speech in English sufficed for political leaders. This was reflective of much else in the new state. There was no decentralization, no new capital in a renovated landscape: instead, the old imperial city just got bigger and bigger. There was no further devolution of power to local councils, as had begun in the late 1890s. The child-centred liberal education imagined by Patrick Pearse never took hold: rather, there was a mimicry of the anti-industrial ethos of British public schools, which favoured the teaching of Latin over commerce and whose SPQR mentality was now employed 10\n\nIntroduction\n\nto buttress the spiritual empire of the Catholic Church. Its lay missionaries were often called ‘legionaries’ in the 1940s and 1950s. Since almost all primary schools were run by the clergy, teachers functioned in effect as the non-commissioned officers of the churches. Not without reason did Máirtín Ó Cadhain, the language activist and prose master of Irish, set his students at Trinity College Dublin a three-hour examination essay on the topic ‘Sacsa nua darb ainm Éire ’ (a new England called Ireland).19 Even the Gaeltacht areas themselves were increasingly anglicized (hardly surprising, since they were more an effect of colonialism than a response to it). People were as likely to see a bar-room television set featuring a soccer match between Manchester United and Chelsea in Casla as in Coolock. Meanwhile, Irish was being taught as if it were a dead language, imposed by whip and stick, as English had been in the nineteenth century. Like Latin, its study seemed to be dominated by strange declensions of noun, conjugations of verb and endless irregularities (the mastery of which was seen as character-forming). During the general election of 1973, when a movement for civil rights had emerged in Gaeltacht areas of west Galway, a socialist politician said in a moment of despondency: ‘we think we are arguing about how to revive the language, but in truth we are having a debate about who exactly owns the corpse’.20 The real meaning of 1922, in the longue durée of history, is not national liberation but the moment of transfer from one elite to another of the responsibility for managing the slow decline of rural Ireland and the gradual demise of regional villages and towns.\n\n11\n\nBeckett’s Inner Exile\n\n2. Beckett’s Inner Exile\n\nN\n\no wonder that the boy Beckett was terrified by what he saw of the burning city of Dublin from Three Rock Mountain. He would bear the stigmata of all that history on his body and in his texts. Beckett had grown up in a home which contained neither Gaelic nor English books and so he was bound to set up shop in the void. His tramps in their dented bowler hats and shabbygenteel suits might seem like Anglo-Irish gentlemen gone to seed (for Synge had already identified the bohemian offspring of that class as a new breed of super-tramp); but they also recreated the world of spailpín poets in their nomadicism and desperation. The dispossessed Gaelic bards after 1600 had been like underemployed postdoctoral students today: possessed of a high self-image but scant material prospects. When Vivian Mercier told Beckett that his tramps talked as if they had PhDs, the writer shot back: ‘how do you know they hadn’t? ’1 They act like the ruined bards of the lost Gaelic order, whose arduous and mandarin training left them ill-equipped for a new mercantile world: ‘You should have been a poet’, says one; and the other, gesturing at his rags, responds ‘I was once. Is it not obvious? ’ (WG 35). In the words of the despairing spailpín poets: ‘ní hé an bochtanas is measa / ach an tarcaisne a 13\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nleanann é’ (it is not poverty that is the worst thing, but the insult that follows it). More than any other modern Irish writer, Beckett registered the blasted, hollowed-out landscape of a country after holocaust and trauma. ‘At the same time it (my life) is over but goes on’, says Molloy, ‘and is there any tense for that? ’ 2 Many of Beckett’s jokes are epitaphs on discarded hope. They project the condition of a people who had looked backward on frustration and forward to liberation, but with no intervening period of fulfilment: Do you believe in the life to come? Mine was always that.3\n\nThis desolate witticism became a one-liner, painted in huge white letters on a wall in West Belfast during the 1970s: ‘Is there a life before death? ’ All of life, in such a state of things, can seem to have been a preparation for a freedom that never eventuated. One problem was that, through decades of ill usage, many Irish had adjusted too comprehensively to intolerable conditions. They had learned techniques for submitting to any humiliation, whether at the hands of gouging landlords or serial abusers. They had taught one another how to behave as if life were normal in a wholly abnormal situation. Beckett was both impressed and scandalized by this capacity to bear the unbearable: I can’t go on like this. That’s what you think. (WG 94)\n\nThrough his play Happy Days, in the course of which a woman is progressively buried in sand, neither she nor her husband attempts to tackle this situation. Passers-by accept it as unremarkable, asking only what it all means. People, the play seems to suggest, can accomodate themselves even to dire situations and not wish 14\n\nBeckett’s Inner Exile\n\nto live otherwise: ‘all my lousy life I’ve crawled about in the mud. And now you talk to me about scenery! ’ (WG 94). Beckett had grown to manhood in a country whose Catholic majority accepted that life is a vale of tears and offered up their suffering to release the souls of those who burned in Purgatory. As a young man on the Dublin art scene, Beckett was something of a loner. Among his closer friends were the painter Jack Yeats and the writer Ernie O’Malley, intellectuals whose work expressed a clear sense of frustration at the failure of the new state to deliver real freedom. Until 1922, many Irish artists had embodied in their work the ideal of a nation which as yet had no incarnation as a state. After that date they lived through the slow extinction of the national idea in a ramshackle political formation. Its problem was the same as that which would later be defined by Salman Rushdie in postcolonial India: it had been ‘insufficiently imagined’ by the decolonizing elites.4 (Beckett’s constant fear that he had been ‘incompletely born’ may have been a related worry.) The paintings of Jack Yeats or memoirs of Ernie O’Malley sometimes project the ideals of an invisible republic, still in the future, but more often an elegy for a nation stillborn. Those who had once said ‘revolution or death’ were now fighting the death of their revolution. The argument had always been about sovereignty. In aisling or vision poems, the ruined Gaelic bards had repeated the same theme. A young man meets a withered crone on the road and she promises him the sovereignty of Ireland, if only he will submit to a few stress tests – such as sleeping with her. If he can bring himself to do this, she will become young again and walk like a queen. These poems often imagined help as coming from abroad (whether from Jacobite army, French military or American money). The source of possible redemption changed over time as the global order shifted, but the aim was to recover cultural sovereignty as a prelude to liberation. Yet all around him the young Beckett could see how little freedom there was: so little that people lived more in the glorious 15\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\npast or in a distant future than in the present moment. They lacked a Protestant belief in the reality of the world, in the here and now. Years of demoralization had led them to turn away from the present and to locate their claims to land and freedom not in any document but in an oral tradition always rooted deep in the past or the future. Even newspapers seemed to be filled with accounts of old outrages or re-conquests to come. The urge was to make the unglamorous present into past or future as quickly as possible. In the words of Winnie in Happy Days, ‘this will have been another happy day! ’5 Beckett could sense that what was being enacted in Ireland, in the guise of the birthing of a nation, was the drama of its perpetual postponement. The question was how to end: and the search for a way of putting an end to things was what allowed the discourse of nation-building to continue. The people were seeking not an answer to the Irish Question but (in the words of one historian) ‘a meaning to their question’.6 France in the 1940s must have reminded Beckett of Ireland in the 1920s: blasted, inchoate, but with the potential to start all over again. Yet the bleakness of freedom after liberation was the abiding feeling: We lost our rights. We got rid of them. (WG 19)\n\nThe cords had been cut which had once bound the puppets to their masters, but there was an underlying fear that ideas of mastery could at any moment return: Tied to Godot? What an idea! No question of it! (Pause) For the moment. (WG 21)\n\nOn stage, the condition of freed puppets is one of dangling arms, sunken heads, sagging knees, as ape-like as any nineteenth-century caricature of a slave. But in this case it is the puppets themselves 16\n\nBeckett’s Inner Exile\n\nwho have cut the strings that bound them to their rulers; yet the freedom they gain seems hollow. Waiting for Godot is in many ways a reflection on their refusal to face the consequences: their own insignificance. The widespread unemployment that affected the Irish economy in the 1920s and 1930s had added idleness to the humili­ ation of insignificance for many, creating a void filled with stories, jokes and minor games well familiar to Beckett long before he was counted an existentialist in Paris. It was indeed, as Oscar Wilde had predicted it would be, awfully hard work doing nothing. Yet there was also something noble and poignant about life in such a suspended state, when old securities had been set aside and exposure to the rawness of being ensued. Beckett’s sense of the absurd was developed in the Dublin of his young manhood. The fish-out-of-water state perfectly captured the attempt by a people, stunned by the departure of old rulers, to learn how to swim in a wholly new element. W. B. Yeats captured the lyric possibilities of that moment, which also held the danger of a death: Shakespearean fish swam the sea, far away from land; Romantic fish swam in nets coming to the hand; What are all those fish that lie gasping on the strand?7\n\nThe Beckett character is stranded on stage but without a definite script: so what dialogue there is must seem improvised. And while there is no supplied script, there are plenty of coercive stage directions coming from authorities elsewhere. This gives a stagey, performative quality to most actions, but also a sense of monot­ ony and changelessness as the same old routines are repeated. A subsistence economy permits little room for the elaboration of personality: ‘I might just as well have been born in his shoes, and he in mine’ (WG 31). The characters of Didi and Gogo seem interchangeable. At the outset of the play, Didi seems sensitive and Gogo coarse; but in 17\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nthe second act these roles are reversed, even as lines are swapped between them. This is a form of characterization familiar enough in Irish writing. Two flawed and incomplete characters may have the makings of a whole person, but life as created is too much for one man. This type of duo will appear in later texts by Edna O’Brien and Brian Friel. The option of emigration will press on their young protagonists as it does on Beckett’s figures: What is there to keep us here? The dialogue. (E 58)\n\nThat dialogue is, however, subject to constant breakdown. The moment of apparent deliverance proved bitter indeed, for it was followed soon after by a global recession which emphasized the hollowness of freedom. In this, as in much else, Ireland became a test case for the world. The tramps in Godot are as addicted to complaint as to suffering. If they tried to change their setting or their state, a better existence might follow, but they prefer not to. Like a couple caught in an abusive relationship or a deteriorated marriage, they are co-dependent, each abusing the other, yet looking to that other for some new response. The fear of listening to the dreams of one’s partner is akin to the fear of completing a thought. ‘Let them remain private’, Didi says to Gogo; ‘you know I can’t bear that’ (WG 16). In a climate of cultural censorship, dreams are among the most subversive and troubling of narratives, for they might express a people’s fear of becoming individuals, of using thought or image as a basis for action. The heroic phase of seeking a meaning to the old question is truly over: vladimir: Thinking is not the worst. estragon: Perhaps not. But at least there’s that. . . vladimir: What do you mean, at least there’s that? 18\n\nBeckett’s Inner Exile\n\nestragon: That much less misery. vladimir: What is terrible is to have thought. (WG 64)\n\n– because owning a thought creates the fear of experiencing and acting on it. Apart from the work of a limited number of intellectuals, Ireland in the later 1920s and 1930s ignored the work of thought and feared confrontation with the self. Beckett remarked in a 1934 essay that most of the country’s poets found that in self-perception there was ‘no theme’.8 (By analogy, over a decade later, Alain Robbe-Grillet would write of Godot as ‘the man who keeps thought enslaved’.9) Although written in France over a decade later as a response to the Second World War, Waiting for Godot was also a warning to Ireland, in the tradition of James Joyce’s coded attacks on the censorship in Finnegans Wake : Yes, and now I remember, yesterday evening we spent blathering about nothing in particular. That’s been going on now for half a century. (WG 66)\n\nBeckett saw to it that the play was put on in Dublin, where half a century earlier audiences had watched, at the end of Synge’s The Well of the Saints, two tramps shuffle off a stage in hopes of a freedom in which they did not really believe. Now, however, they do not move, but remain stuck fast at the crossroads, at the point of a perpetually postponed decision. The fear of thought-in-action was not peculiar to Irish intellectuals. Godot also rebukes those who would offer, instead of direct action, a pretty speech. In an earlier draft of the play the author had referred to two characters, Bim and Bom, as ‘Stalinist comedians’;10 and it is hard not to think of these as exemplars of Left Bank intellectuals, staging plays for audiences that included Nazi officers, while Beckett fled those same officers for his life. 19\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nThe tramps opt for inaction: ‘Don’t let’s do anything. It’s safer’ (WG 18). What can be read as a critique of Irish neutrality may also be a comment on writers of commitment. As Søren Kierkegaard had written: ‘there are two ways – one is to suffer; the other is to become a professor of the fact that someone else has suffered’.11 The tramps choose life rather than death, so that they can, as mere survivors, avoid the unknown. As survivalists it is better that they do not even remember the ideals which once actuated them: vladimir: What was it you wanted to know? estragon: I’ve forgotten.\n\nThe forces which allow a person to overlook the present pain of a passing beggar are manifold – the notion that God will reward the sufferer in the next life or that charitable gestures are inappropriate from one who looks to a future socialist state. Although Beckett inherited an urgently Protestant sense of the need to act positively in this world, he could not long be a believer in faith without good works. That was the besetting vice of all extreme sects, whether Christian or socialist: but for him all those ‘isms’ were ‘wasms’. The word Godot was suggested by the French for ‘boot’, godillot ; and whenever Godot seems about to appear the boots start to tighten on Estragon: but that is the perennial flaw of humans, to blame on their boots (or God) the flaws of their feet (or themselves). On this kind of evasiveness, the physicist Albert Einstein had a most penetrating statement: . . . if something did not fit, he would not seek to ignore or escape it – he would not wait for the Messiah, the world revolution, the universal reign of peace and justice to dissolve the difficulty. If the shoe does not fit, it is no use saying that time and wear will make it less uncomfortable or that the shape of the foot should be altered or that the pain is an illusion. . . There was only 20\n\nBeckett’s Inner Exile\n\none world, the world of human experience; it alone was real. Beyond it there was mystery – the fact that the universe was comprehensible was the greatest of mysteries; yet no theory was valid which ignored any part of human experience, in which he included imaginative insight, arrived at by paths often far from conscious.12\n\nThe problem with all available theories was that they were based on an absolute rhetorical account of the world, which could never explain all that was resistant to the hopeful schematizations of persons or to transformation by the imagination. As Clov observes to Hamm in Endgame : ‘I use the words you gave me. If they don’t mean anything any more teach me others. Or let me be silent’ (E 32). Beckett had made the transition to writing in French in order to break out of the Anglo-Irish paradigm: asked whether his move from Ireland meant that he could now be taken as an English author, he said ‘au contraire ’. He may have shifted to French in order to submit himself to the experience of language change undergone by so many Irish in the nineteenth century, and to have re-processed early experiences in a second language allowed him to filter out some too pressing memories of his earlier years in Ireland: it was a means through which he would ‘forget’ much of the past. By embracing French, he could change languages but never countries. Donning the mask of a French author, he was free to explore his own nation’s experience as he never could have done in either English or Irish. The problem was how to finish things off. ‘It’s time it ended’, says Hamm early in Endgame, ‘and yet I hesitate to end’ (E 12). The sort of stasis which Beckett knew well as a member of the chess club in Sackville Street, Dublin, was a fair symbolization of the state of the country. The endgame happens when there are no longer enough pieces to mount an attack on the king, but the monarch himself is resourceless too. Beckett (in a rare moment of explanation) told 21\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nthe actor who first played the part of Hamm: ‘A good player would have given up long ago. He is only trying to delay the inevitable end. Each of his gestures is one of the last useless moves which put off the end’.13 Yet the complaints voiced in Dublin may have been no different from the disenchantment expressed after the First World War, as when T. S. Eliot asserted that The Waste Land, far from expressing the disillusion of a generation, simply exposed their ‘illusion of being disillusioned’.14 In Godot, as in the Gaelic aisling, the predicted messenger never comes: but in Endgame the unexpected figure (a boy) appears but is not recognized as a deliverer. A people numbed-up by suffering may no longer notice every salient detail: hamm: Nature has forgotten us. clov: There’s no more nature. hamm: No more nature! You exaggerate. clov: In the vicinity. (E 11)\n\nEven the eyes of a healthy person see only what they are trained to see. People began to register fogs in London after Impressionists began to paint them. But a sensibility forged in ‘mud’ may not be best fitted to appreciate ‘scenery’. Hamm sometimes expresses hope of better landscapes but only when the co-dependent Clov has ceased to believe in them. Hamm defers the end with painkillers, stories and small routines: but what he fears as much as an impending end is the awful silence in which each character might have to confront himself. Everything depends, as always in Beckett, on the sort of silence one keeps: but for those who fear an ending, the hum is better than silence. The shape of Endgame may be different from Godot, but the conclusions to which both plays come are similar. There can be no rhetorical substitute for compassionate action: ‘All those I might have helped. Helped! Saved. Saved! The place was crawling with 22\n\nBeckett’s Inner Exile\n\nthem.’ And then, to the audience: ‘Get out of here and love one another. Lick your neighbour as yourself ! ’ (E 68). Yet no sooner is the message of tender care voiced than it is undercut by the licking jest. This is in the tradition of a people who, as Sean O’Casey said, treat a joke as a serious thing and a serious thing as a joke. If the trivial comedy is for serious people, every serious point must be made to appear trivial. Embarrassed by his own inter­ mittent shows of emotion, Hamm must annul them with the epitaph of a joke. The problem in the end is that Clov can never know when Hamm is joking and when he is in earnest, as each epitaph overrides the life that gave rise to it. His desperate need to keep establishing a context is another element which prevents him from looking within his personality, but so also does his addiction to acting a part rather than articulating a self. J. W. von Goethe might have fore-diagnosed his condition, for he was the writer who could forgive the faults of men in actors but not the faults of actors in men.15\n\n23\n\nA Neutral Ireland?\n\nIreland remained neutral throughout the Second World War. After the convulsions of its own war and civil war, it was still rebuilding slowly. At the outset of international hostilities, some nationalists supported the Axis powers, on the extremely dubious principle that they might assist in recovering the six lost counties. Most people had some sympathy with the British, especially after major cities of the United Kingdom (with many Irish resident there) were bombed. A slogan did the rounds: ‘we’re neutral – but who are we neutral against? ’ British soldiers who stumbled across the border were quietly repat­riated. German aviators who crash-landed in Ireland were detained (not to their total chagrin) in fairly relaxed internment camps (with weekend release for men to attend dances with local women). Members of the Irish Republican Army were interned in more severe conditions at the Curragh, because of a fear that some might prejudice neutrality by seeking a military alliance with Hitler. During the fierce debates that often raged among Curragh internees, it was said that opinion invariably split three ways – between pro-Germans, pro-British and Brendan Behan. Cut off from the world, Ireland grew more introverted. But the continuing availability of good meat, pure butter and healthy\n\nvegetables made a city like Dublin a place of some attraction for British intellectuals, in flight from the more strict rationing in their own country. The city became a kind of displaced bohemia, where bottle parties were held by experimental dancers such as Erina Brady or visiting poets such as John Betjeman. Snooping on these dens of iniquity kept the Special Branch of the police busy once the last of the republican militants had been locked away. Samuel Beckett had left in 1939, telling his mother that he preferred to live in a France at war than an Ireland at peace. He deplored the affectation of neutrality. For most Irish citizens, especially in the early years of the war, that neutrality was proof of a sovereignty hard won, after the anti-conscription success of Sinn Féin at the polls in 1918 and the subsequent securing of independence. But a suspicion persisted that neutrality, far from being a positive policy, might become indistinguishable from indifference. The prevailing introversion was not all bad: it did give rise to honest soul-searching, especially in a journal such as The Bell, established by Seán O’Faoláin in 1940. But the poet Louis MacNeice expressed reservations felt by many when he mocked the very notion of self-sufficiency implied in the words ‘sinn féin’ and in a state seeking to provide all of its own food: Ourselves alone! Let the round tower stand aloof In a world of bursting mortar…1\n\nIn France, Beckett again and again risked his life as he assisted Jewish friends to escape from the Nazis in Paris: eventually he had to flee the city himself. After the war, this ascetic and fastidious man was appalled at the way in which his relations in Dublin gorged on vast amounts of food, while those who had stood against fascism on the continent still went hungry. It is possible that the character Pozzo, with his complacent blindness and luxurious food, might be read as a negative representation of Irish neutralism in the\n\nSecond World War, with Lucky embodying the hunger-wracked, devastated French population after the cessation of hostilities. The tramps, Didi and Gogo, may epitomize Beckett himself, as a volunteer at an Irish Red Cross depot in the ruined city of Saint Lô, seeking to understand the meaning of it all. In a subsequent talk for Radio Éireann rebuking Irish neutrality, Beckett wrote with rare directness about his time at Saint Lô. He lamented the sense of disconnection between the Irish officers and the people they were treating: ‘their way of being was not our way, and our way of being was not their way’. The extreme difference in recent national experience made it impossible for one group to understand or be understood by the other. Yet Beckett had no doubt that the very basis of the human condition was being rethought and remade at Saint Lô: ‘the whole enterprise turned from the beginning on the establishing of a relation in the light of which the therapeutic faded to the merest of pretexts’; he felt that the Irish volunteers in France were the real exponents of the old national genius for building something good amid the ruins of a community. The nurses, doctors and relief-workers ‘got at least as good as they gave. . . got what they could hardly give, a vision and a sense of a time-honoured conception of humanity in ruins, and perhaps even an inkling of the terms in which our condition is to be thought again’.2 France, après la guerre, might contain secret messages for a secret Ireland yet to be constructed. The talk was carefully typed in double space and the words carefully chosen – but the broadcast itself was never made. Only in 1983 did a zealous researcher at the station exhume the typescript.\n\n‘Gaeldom is Over’\n\n3. ‘Gaeldom is Over’: The Bell\n\nT\n\nhe editor boasted that The Bell was ‘the only magazine in the world printed on lavatory paper with ink made of soot’,1 but that was the inevitable fate of a monthly Irish journal of art and ideas founded in 1940. Its glory days under the guiding hand of Sean O’Faoláin were the war years of paper shortages and curtailed newsprint. It was a tribute to O’Faoláin’s visionary zeal that even after he resigned from the editorial chair in 1946 The Bell lasted, with some breaks in transmission, until 1954. O’Faoláin was a man of letters, excelling at writing in many genres, whether novel, short story, biography, historical narrative or essay. He devoted much energy, which might otherwise have gone into creating more novels, to editing The Bell. Some might have seen in this yet another case of a good writer fallen among controversialists, what W. B. Yeats had warned against as the chief temptation of the artist, ‘creation without toil’.2 But O’Faoláin had his reasons, chief among them the banning by the Free State government of hundreds of works of literature, some penned by himself and his friends. Among other functions, The Bell bravely fought that censorship with reasoned critique and constant reminders of how ludicrous it must seem to overseas commentators.3 29\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nIn his young manhood, O’Faoláin had been a volunteer in the fight for Irish freedom. Having said ‘revolution or death’ in 1921, he was by 1940 confronted by the death of the revolution. Éamon de Valera (of whom he had written a hopeful, admiring biography in the 1930s) now wore a top hat to attend the Royal Dublin Horse Show and was turning the country into a conservative, theocratic state. The Bell ’s call was for a completion, not a liquidation, of the anticolonial revolution: the use of tillage to replace livestock (beloved of profiteering ranchers); the reconfiguration of cities and towns along civic rather than colonial lines (challenging Dublin-centric versions of national life); and the further redistribution of land among rural smallholders after the expropriation of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy. Kelly Matthews (in her history of the journal) shows that the magazine’s circulation started at 5,000 and steadied out at 3,000 (about 1,000 of which went overseas). It is hard for readers now to understand the sense of excitement which attended the arrival of each monthly issue in a rural parish, as copies were passed from librarian to schoolteacher, from the more liberal sort of priest to the more intellectual type of landless labourer. The Censorship Acts, which had been implemented by the government in 1929, were a snooper’s charter, an example of cultural democracy grown manic. If any citizen objected to a book, he or she simply referred it to the Censorship Board with the accompanying complaint (indecent or obscene). As discussed earlier, in totalitarian societies such as Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany, the censorship by 1940 was top-down, but in Ireland it was really bottom-up. O’Faoláin tried to develop a more sophisticated literary sensibility among the community and to expose the ill effects of rampant self-censorship, all the more lethal in a country whose pose of wartime neutrality entailed a heavy curtailment of news from overseas sources. He could do this because he was one of the ‘risen people’ himself, the son of humble parents in Cork, and therefore not perceived as greatly ‘above’ the people to whom he addressed his journal. 30\n\n‘Gaeldom is Over’\n\nThe newly literate masses, as Jonathan Rose has shown in The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes,4 were no great lovers of experimental modernism; and neither was O’Faoláin. He admired Flaubert, Balzac and the realist novelists of nineteenth-century France, and sought to emulate their representational accuracy in his magazine as well as his art. After the turbo-charged poetics of Yeats and the vertiginous prose of Joyce in the period of national revival, it was time, he contended, for the realists to take stock and to give an honest accounting of just how far actual Ireland fell short of its founders’ dreams. Matthews rather strangely attributes O’Faoláin’s scepticism concerning modernism to the fact that ‘it was still a new phenomenon in the early 1940s’,5 but the truth is that the emerging Irish writers of that time had had quite enough of it. The expressive achievement was intimidating more than enabling. One poet compared Yeats to a massive tree, whose roots sucked all life to themselves even as its branches blocked out all light.6 Joyce was seen as a great artist but an unusable model, of interest more to American professors than to Irish realists. (Matthews is wrong, however, to say that the sale of Ulysses was banned in Ireland: no case was pressed because none of the snoopers felt able to offer a sufficiently confident interpretation of the book to mount one.) The Bell set its face against modernism, which it saw as a thing of the past, coincident with the early, lyric phase of Irish nationalism and revivalism: but it attempted nonetheless to engage with modernity, with the messy democratic polity and ‘the filthy modern tide’7 so castigated by Yeats. In this it was wholly successful. Its essays covered everything from poetry (it introduced Patrick Kavanagh and John Hewitt to a wider audience) to basket-weaving, from amateur drama to the making of hats. Contributions came from every class: readers learned of a day in the life of a single mother, a slum family, a country doctor, a steeplejack, a prisoner who did penal servitude. There were crisp, lucid articles on ‘Irish fisheries’, ‘street rhymes’ and the Irish Grand National horse race at Fairyhouse. 31\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nSuch essays owed something to the fashion for Mass Observation among British writers of the 1930s, but they were often more subtly novelistic in their psychological analysis, constituting a study of mentalities of a kind which would be developed with even greater rigour by Pierre Nora in his lieux de mémoire commentaries on the culture of modern France. It was these articles that proved the major selling point of The Bell and made it popular not just in Dublin but right across the countryside. Why should this have been so? Although Ireland was independent, it was still not unified in any cultural sense: the people of its regions remained strange, even mysterious, to one another. John McGahern, who was born in 1935, once told me that if, as a boy, he cycled ten miles away from his native parish in Co. Leitrim, he found himself in a foreign land, where the people’s clothes, their flower arrangements and ways of walking or talking all seemed utterly different from the life he knew. In theory, Ireland (or most of it) had been unified by a triumphant nationalism and by the usual effects of railways and printing presses, but in fact the people still needed to hear and get to know the full range of voices in a genuinely national debate. Once again, O’Faoláin was completing a job left undone by the Free State’s founders and left undone afterwards by its radio service. Even in 1940, many people did not own wireless receivers; whole communities would gather around a single radio to hear a football match. Perhaps this helps to explain why O’Faoláin was rather dis­ missive of the use of radio by artists and intellectuals. True, its pay cheques provided what some of them laughingly called ‘indoor relief ’, but he felt that the half-hour broadcast of short stories had done nothing for the genre, introducing only ‘a fake air of intimacy’ which licensed ‘the button-holing technique of the Club Bore’.8 This was a none-too-concealed jibe at his fellow Corkman and friend Frank O’Connor, who loved to deploy the techniques of oral tale-tellers (‘Be the hokies, there was a strange man coming 32\n\n‘Gaeldom is Over’\n\ndown the road. . . ’) in his stories, written and oral, and who would defiantly codify some of these techniques in his study of the form, The Lonely Voice, over two decades later. Nevertheless, O’Faoláin in The Bell was doing what radio should by 1940 have done – articulating Ireland to itself and to significant numbers of its people (and their well-wishers) overseas. The tattered condition of most surviving copies suggests widespread use. Like all gifted editors, O’Faoláin was something of a monomaniac. He encouraged young authors with the utmost generosity of spirit and, unlike some editors of literary journals, he paid his contributors promptly and well: but this did not prevent him from issuing correctives to them in public print rather than in private conversation. The Bell was to have a consciously ‘improving’ function and so its editor disdained private channels of admonition in favour of ‘advice given on the printed page with the whole of Ireland looking on’.9 Some of the more intrepid younger authors occasionally snapped back, if only to prove that they could bite the hand that fed them. Rashly but gallantly, O’Faoláin commissioned two as yet unknown critics, Vivian Mercier and Conor Cruise O’Brien, to write essays on the fourth estate in Ireland, not excluding one on The Bell itself. Mercier might have been young but he was not easily frightened: For Sean O’Faoláin is not just a figurehead – he is the magazine, as you find out after, or before, you have written one article for it. He writes his own Editorial, all 3000 words of it; he usually has another piece – a lecture, short story or what not – under his own name; he writes the little blurbs in italics which appear at the head of most Bell contributions; and, if I am not careful, he will write most of this article too.10\n\nO’Brien went even further, offering parodies of Bell-type articles in a 1945 issue: ‘Crubeens v. Boxty: A Symposium’. Under cover of a pseudonym (necessary for a civil servant in those days), he gave 33\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nthe magazine’s readers a rather sour image of themselves in 1946: ‘In its caution, its realism, its profound but ambivalent nationalism, its seizures of stodginess and its bad paper, it reflects the class who write it and read it – teachers, librarians, junior civil servants, the lettered section of the Irish petty bourgeoisie’.11 It was, in fact, far more audacious and witty than that. It is a measure of O’Faoláin’s liberalism that he printed such condescending haut-en-bas piffle from a man who would in later years aim his sarcasms at far worthier targets and whose marvellous prose style was honed in such early work for the journal. The Bell took its name from Kolokol, a magazine edited by Alexander Herzen in the 1850s and 1860s. Herzen used it to ventilate the debate between Slavophile lovers of Mother Russia and Westernizers who turned to the more ‘advanced’ countries of Europe for models. O’Faoláin was a great Europeanizer, one who hoped that Ireland might one day be a little more like the great republic across the Channel. He was French in his love of good food, in his determination to study the fashion system (his wife Eileen wrote an essay on hats) and in his barefaced cheek in persuading two of his mistresses (Honor Tracy and Elizabeth Bowen) to write for the journal. Apart from the nod to Herzen, the titular ‘bell’ may also have been faintly parodic of those church-oriented magazines which circulated in even greater numbers throughout Ireland in the 1930s and 1940s. The anticlerical tones of a secularizing French intelligentsia informed much O’Faoláin commentary: he once called the Irish, ‘a nation of apple-lickers’ and, when asked to explain, said breezily ‘people who, if tempted in the Garden of Eden, would have licked rather than bitten the apple’.12 In that cautious land, many feared to be European lest the huckster across the street call them English.13 The value of The Bell ’s Francophilia was its challenge to compatriots to stop explaining every­ thing by reference to an Anglo-Irish axis. At the outset, O’Faoláin intended to reverse the flow of usual analysis by 34\n\n‘Gaeldom is Over’\n\nadvertising a special ‘English Issue’, in which a mainly Irish writing team would study the people who for centuries had purported to study them. ‘It is essential for the mental health of Ireland that we should as quickly as possible get to the stage where we do not give a damn about Britain’,14 he snorted. This was bracing stuff, but wartime restrictions meant that the issue never got published. Instead, The Bell had to content itself with special ‘Ulster Numbers’ devoted to the nature and effects of the partition of the island. In this, at least, O’Faoláin showed that he was capable of an ambivalence similar to that displayed by his hero turned villain, de Valera. In his Constitution of 1937, de Valera had renewed the time-honoured claim to the six northern counties but had also managed, by a typical casuistry, to give a first formal recognition to the actually existing Northern Ireland by including the phrase ‘pending the reintegration of the national territory’. Although his Constitution would be denounced as obnoxiously predatory by later critics of nationalism, at the time of its enactment it evoked little complaint, except among northern nationalists, who knew from its wording that their goose was cooked.15 O’Faoláin, like de Valera, urged people to think of themselves as Irish rather than Catholic or Protestant, but his Ulster Numbers in their very title duplicated the realism of the Constitution in accepting partition as a fact. Indeed, those issues reinforced a grudging acceptance of the northern difference, Matthews contends,16 by demonstrating just how distinct, a couple of decades after the settlement of 1921, the states of Ireland had grown. Of course, north and south had been different – as different as east and west – long before 1921. The leader of Irish nationalism at Westminster in the late nineteenth century, Charles Stewart Parnell, had warned his people that they must resign themselves to the cursed versatility of the Celt. O’Faoláin took this literally. He published an article by an anonymous ‘Ulster Protestant’ (actually the broadcaster and poet W. R. Rodgers), warning that the average 35\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nunionist farmer really did believe that, if Britain were to sanction the formation of an all-Ireland government, his land would ‘be taken away from him and given to a Catholic neighbour’:17 but he also included articles by republican authors who believed that Northern Ireland had already become ‘a totalitarian state’.18 Confronted by such polarized politics, it says a lot for the pluralism of The Bell that its most distinguished poetry editor, the Belfast classicist and son of the manse Louis MacNeice, was recruited to the post through the offices of a former IRA gunman, Ernie O’Malley. If only Ireland could always have been like that! There were limits to O’Faoláin’s tolerance. Today, younger scholars might accuse him of being Eurocentric, of romanticizing a Europe that perhaps does not deserve, and maybe never did deserve, such unqualified tenderness. Matthews is right to say that his deep respect for European realism left him rather baffled by modern­ist art. In her book, The Bell is depicted as a thoroughly postcolonial project in its themes (which it surely was), but such a description could hardly be applied to O’Faoláin’s own techniques as novelist or storyteller. Like the novels of certain of his French contemporaries, O’Faoláin’s are often radical in content but oldfashioned in narrative form. For O’Faoláin, to be modern was to be European – it did not strike him that Ireland, before its accession to the European Economic Community, might have been an example of an alternative modernity. If he had made a deeper study of Joyce, he might have found his own path to the postcolonial modernism which cheerfully acknowledged the Dubliner as one of its founding fathers. As matters stood, Europe and verisimilar realism were the ne plus ultra of his ideals for an Irish polity and for Irish letters. And it was hardly his fault that the leaders of Ireland in the later decades of membership of the European Union produced in the Celtic Tiger not so much an imitation of Europe as its caricature. There were good reasons for all this. Even in 1940, the Irish bourgeoisie had not been fully formed. As a novelist, O’Faoláin 36\n\n‘Gaeldom is Over’\n\nfretted about what he called ‘the problem of adequacy’, of a country which still lacked many of those middle-class institutions and protocols off which the novel as a form feeds.19 In some desperation, he often recurred to the question put by Henry James about postindependence America: ‘How can you write a novel of manners about a society that has none? ’ 20 When O’Faoláin wrote novels, he found that he had to invent whole elements of a middle-class world in the very act of reporting it, or else there might be no story at all. The novel presupposes a made society, but Ireland in 1940 was still a society in the making. This explains an uncertainty of tone that may sometimes be found in the narratives of O’Faoláin, leaving him a better short story writer than novelist: but it also accounts for a final (and wonderful) peculiarity of The Bell. Many of its essays turn out, on inspection, to concern themselves with the question of how to become a better bourgeois in an Ireland which has seen a rather vulgar arriviste middle class take sudden control. O’Faoláin worries about how to be ‘elegant’, in phrasing, in decor, in craft. He wants people to make their rooms tasteful and beautiful. He feels that the natives, now that they own the environment, should care more lovingly for it. While insisting that culture is ordinary, he extends this idea to the suggestion that the production of a perfect furrow in a ploughing field might be an artistic achievement. It is a beautiful and brilliant programme, even if it carries echoes of Sir Roger de Coverley (who would not scruple to lecture rising poets on the ways of elegance, either). The essays in The Bell are in some ways (for understandable reasons) a throwback to the world of the periodical essayists of England in the eighteenth century, the world of Joseph Addison and Richard Steele (whose texts are often recommended to Bell readers). They tell those readers many things they want to learn: how to find a post for your son in the office of a solicitor or of a country vet; how to buy better hats and wear them in style; how to keep a cleaner house. They provide the compost 37\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\n(as Addison and Steele did for England) that underlies the emerging form of the social novel, that thick description out of which the form can spring – because they make real those materials from which a novel of manners can come. O’Faoláin was one of the very few intellectuals who had a palpable effect on society, but his pluralist Ireland only came into being decades after he had planted the seeds (and he lived to take pleasure in the changes). That Ireland may be found in the Programmes for Economic Expansion of the 1950s and 1960s, when de Valera’s pastoral made way for the white heat of free trade; in the early years of RTÉ television, which developed the nation’s conversation with itself along lines that he had so intrepidly mapped out; and in the critique of narrow-gauge identity politics which emerged against the backdrop of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It is the misfortune of original minds to seem less and less remark­ able in proportion to their success in changing public opinion. O’Faoláin’s star waned in recent decades, because his realism began to seem tepid and wan at a time of dazzling experiment in post­ colonial cultures. But he was, despite his formal conservatism, a postcolonial intellectual par excellence, who said in 1943 ‘Gaeldom is over. . . let Ireland begin’ but feared that what emerged from the Irish revolution was not so much a society as a middle-class putsch.21 The insurgents of Easter Week were rebels who knew what they were against (an empire) but needed also to be revolutionaries, with a clear sense of the society they wished to create. O’Faoláin’s sense of anticlimax chimed with the sense of uncertainty among intellectuals after independence. But Gaeldom was not quite over yet. Four years after his utterance, Gaeldom dis­ covered what seemed to have eluded him: a way of being Irish and modernist at one and the same time.\n\n38\n\nS á i r s é a l a g u s Di l l\n\n4. A Talking Corpse? Sáirséal agus Dill\n\nW\n\nhen Seán and Brighid Ó hÉigeartaigh founded the company of Sáirséal agus Dill in 1947, writing in Irish seemed weak indeed. A state founded in 1922 had, by its standardizing of Gaeltacht idiom and by its pursuit of moral rectitude in texts, wrung much of the life out of a language it claimed to revere. The policy of imposing Irish as a compulsory subject of study in schools had led many child­ ren to experience the language as a threat rather than a gift.1 There can have been few more counterproductive examples of affirmative action in the twentieth century. If a student failed Irish, he or she could be deemed to have failed the entire state exam; and many plum positions in the new state’s apparatus were unobtainable without a pass in Irish. On the other hand, if students sat an algebra test in Irish (i.e., using Gaelic rather than Roman letters), they could get a ten per cent bonus. Not even an Einstein could have defeated some Irish-speaking geniuses in a state physics exam. Such inducements characterized the land that, in the words of the satirical magazine Dublin Opinion, ‘lost the leprechaun but found the pot of gold’.2 The texts studied in Irish classes reflected a narrow nationalist ideology. If Soviet leaders at much the same time were destroying 39\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\ngraphic art in Russia with injunctions to provide ‘Girl Meets Tractor’ posters, writers of Irish produced what Máirtín Ó Cadhain would later deride as texts fit mainly for a readership of credulous schoolchildren and pre-Vatican Two nuns.3 This was all part of a wider censoriousness. The banning of literary masterpieces in English was so comprehensive that Flann O’Brien came up with a mischievous scheme: if every volume suppressed in English were to be instantly translated and made available solely in Irish, this would provide the ultimate incentive for citizens finally to learn their native language. By the 1940s, much of the early fire had gone out of the language revival movement. A free state invented by artists and intellectuals had become a tedious theocratic bureaucracy, censoring its best minds and exporting many of its finest graduates. They left not necessarily in search of work, but because the life available at home seemed boring and mediocre.4 In a famous speech he made at a debating society in Trinity College Dublin, Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh pleaded with classmates to stay in Ireland and stage a rearguard action. Yet many who heard his eloquence – such as the Yeats scholars A. N. Jeffares and Peter Allt – felt obliged to go. Ó hÉigeartaigh kept his word. With a bequest of £300 from an aunt, he began to publish the work of a new generation of experimental poets: Máirtín Ó Direáin, Seán Ó Ríordáin, Máire Mhac an tSaoi. He insisted on attractive, up-to-date formats, with covers specially commissioned from artists such as Anne Yeats and Charles Lamb. He had an eye for as yet unproven talent. One of the funniest chapters in the history of the publishing house – crafted with devotion by his children Cian Ó hÉigeartaigh and Aoileann Nic Gearailt – recounts his months of ‘foreplay’ with the young Brendan Behan, whose visits to the Aran Islands (to improve the Dubliner’s creative but wayward Irish) the publisher generously bankrolled. The stern but kindly patron received regular letters from a priest-spy on the islands, explaining that much of the money was being spent in the local bar (admittedly a good place in 40\n\nS á i r s é a l a g u s Di l l\n\nwhich to learn certain forms of Irish) or even more extensively on prolonged travels to the English-speaking mainland. In fact, Behan appears to have treated Aran as a sort of police station at which he had to register from time to time in order to prove his fidelity as a true Gael. Nothing came of this poignant courtship – An Ghiall / The Hostage were still years ahead – but one is left with a profound admiration for a private publisher who constantly put himself and his wife out of pocket in the attempt to promote fine writing.5 Throughout the two decades of his efforts, Ó hÉigeartaigh held a senior post as a civil servant in the Department of Finance, helping to negotiate Irish entry to the European Economic Community. It was as if T. S. Eliot had taken on the directorship of Faber & Faber while continuing to hold ever more senior positions in Lloyds Bank – a punishing regimen. Ó hÉigeartaigh cycled home from work every day, retreated to the garden outhouses at six o’clock and began his second job – nothing less than the attempt to reconfigure a national culture in a minority language. A scientist by training, he was a true Renaissance man. He introduced new modes of printing to Irish, with some pagination fonts based on French models he had come to admire on his trips as a civil servant (the layout of Françoise Sagan’s novel Bonjour Tristesse being one of these). He published academic textbooks on Latin and French, and on European as well as Irish history – and these doubtless served many students well as they went in search of the extra percentage points. But he also commissioned original, path-breaking studies of great figures from the Irish past (Robert Emmet, O’Donovan Rossa, Dr Patrick Dinneen, Arthur Griffith) and he did so without fear or favour in a land still nervous after a lethal civil war and nervous also about ‘unfinished business’ in the northern counties. Sometimes, the books published annoyed the state authorities because of the politics of their subjects; at other times, it was the willingness of freethinking authors to criticize bishops that offended official Ireland. Máirtín Ó Cadhain, of course, offended under all categories, being a socialist, 41\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\na republican and a militant language rights activist; but the publisher, as the son of the agnostic republican P. S. O’Hegarty, never for a moment blinked. The company did receive grants for its work, but these were grudgingly given by a bureaucratic elite and were never enough. Máirtín Ó Cadhain once told his students in Trinity College Dublin that, but for Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh, he would have lost the will to write fiction after the 1940s. Ó hÉigeartaigh was one of those who persuaded the authorities at Trinity to appoint Ó Cadhain as a lecturer in Irish, one of the bravest appointments that that often endearingly eccentric college has ever made. Ó Cadhain had as qualifications only a primary teacher’s diploma, a long stint of internment as an IRA activist and – of course – the authorship of Cré na Cille (Graveyard Clay, 1949), the greatest novel in the language. The sheer quality of all this production meant that ambitious young writers in the 1950s and 1960s bypassed state houses and sent their work to Sáirséal agus Dill: Seán Ó Tuama, Diarmaid Ó Suilleabhain and many more. Ó hÉigeartaigh seems to have based much of his programme and design values on those of the Yeats family at the Cuala and Dun Emer presses (and his sister Gráinne, a famous harpist, married the poet W. B.’s son Michael). But the deeper and more contemporary analogy, I think, is with Faber & Faber (who were in a sense the real opposition). In an era when Faber’s distinguished back catalogue was augmented by the young Heaney and McGahern (and thereafter by dozens more Irish writers of English), Ó hÉigeartaigh offered the very best to that small but significant audience which now existed for quality writing in Irish. The volumes were good value but never cheap. They were read with pleasure by everyone into whose hands they came (and some sold quite well over extended periods in print). It seems likely that the very smallness of the select intellectual audience permitted much of the formal experimentation with language and styles; there emerged, therefore, a literature of existential alienation in what was already an alienated literature. Texts such as An Uain 42\n\nS á i r s é a l a g u s Di l l\n\nBheo by Ó Súilleabháin or An tSraith Ar Lár by Ó Cadhain bear that verdict out. Some years afterward in Paris, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari would write that nothing in modern literature was important except the ‘minor’.6 Those who work in ‘major’ world languages are constrained by many things: the calcifying power of custom, the coercion of market forces, the fickleness of popular opinion, and the slow emasculation of an idiom used mainly for internet babble and airport bookings. Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh seems to have instinctively understood all this: that literary breakthroughs are more likely to happen in a discourse the wider world is not anxiously weighing and watching. After all, when James Joyce created his own radical innovations on the outer edges of European literature, he was not yet ‘James Joyce’. The story of Sáirséal agus Dill is very well documented, thanks to Cian Ó hÉigeartaigh and Aoileann Nic Gearailt. Their history of the enterprise must be one of the most detailed books ever written about the development of a small modernist press. It is surely the most generously documented, with remarkable reproductions of accounts, advertisements and gloriously feisty letters in which cranky geniuses berate the publishers for literary offences (almost all imagined rather than real). There are also letters from the publishers to tardy authors or foot-dragging officials, usually civil but with an occasional note of saeva indignatio which Jonathan Swift would have loved. Swift lived in a time when English was being codified and standardized as a literary language, as was Irish in the decades of Sáirséal agus Dill. The Ó hÉigeartaighs held a precarious balance above grossness and below refinement, recognizing that there must always be a tension between the language of literature and the demotic of the streets. The official history of the publishing house contains many word lists made by Brighid Bean Uí Éigeartaigh. In the end, this remarkable woman may have done more than any government agent to produce a literary standard that was not deadened by unnecessary caution but instead supple and vital in its nuances. 43\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nThe company had a further flowering in the years after 1969, thanks to support from that most raffish and undecodable of all Irish politicians, Charles Haughey. In the years of his decline, Haughey invariably refused interviews to national radio but would emerge suddenly on Radió na Gaeltachta to enunciate a major policy. In his pomp, he was a bruiser and lover of fine wine. On 14 May 1969, when Brighid Uí Éigeartaigh went to petition him, he had an especially bad hangover and realized that he had at last met his match. He gave the money she requested and the company had a brilliant diminuendo, until ill health compelled Brighid to close it in 1981. In its later years, it sold between 20,000 and 30,000 volumes. That might not seem a lot: but it is worth recalling that when the Gaelic League was founded in 1893, there were only six books in print in the Irish language. Now, hundreds are produced each year, some of the best by Cló Iar-Chonnacht, which has taken over the Sáirséal agus Dill copyrights and has done full justice to its founders. Near the close of their history of the firm, the offspring of the Ó hÉigeartaighs pose a question: was it all worth it? Any lover of modern Irish literature will answer that of course it was – but will also understand why the question had to be asked. Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh died of a massive heart attack in 1967, aged only fifty. At his funeral his wife placed copies of the books alongside him in his grave. It was in its way a salute to the man who had brought the talking corpses of Ó Cadhain’s Cré na Cille to the world: but it was a richly ambiguous gesture, as if the widow wished for one desperate moment to bury along with her beloved husband those very books which had shortened his life. She did persist, however, and government subventions flowed more freely for a while, perhaps augmented by a guilt felt by official Ireland. Ó Cadhain had often complained that the Irish knew how to deal with a person’s death – it was life that they found difficult and tricky. He used to joke that there was something irretrievably respectable about the national dead – as if a tidied corpse achieved that which 44\n\nS á i r s é a l a g u s Di l l\n\nwas withheld from it in life, a place among the revered middle classes. He wrote Cré na Cille to mock such thinking. Its power to disturb all official codes has not abated, and the many ill-fated attempts to get it into English are a high absurdist story in themselves. Ó Cadhain himself seemed unconcerned about the recurrent attempts by Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh to commission a viable version in English. It was difficult to strike on a form of Hiberno-English that answered to the various tonalities of the original text. If other modernists sought to cope with the language of exhaustion, Ó Cadhain had to find in himself a response to the apparent exhaustion of a language. His base-language was that of his native townland, An Cnocán Glas, but he also revived words from Old Irish, borrowed others from Scots Gaelic, or simply invented words of his own. For many decades, purists held that such a book could not be translated into English at all. The shifts of register from portentous to demotic seemed beyond rendition. At one point, however, a sample translation entered in an open competition by a young woman from Co. Leitrim was so good that Ó hÉigeartaigh sent her a contract in 1961, only to receive an apologetic letter from her mother explaining that her daughter had now entered a convent and could not undertake the work. It seemed as if the higher powers had declared Cré na Cille untranslatable.7 Ó Cadhain found it strange to write in a language which he feared might be dead before he was.8 He set Cré na Cille in a Gaeltacht cemetery. In each of its ten ‘interludes’ a new body from the village above is interred, bearing news and gossip to the truculent corpses below. In Ireland, as W. B. Yeats once mischievously observed, the dead may not even know that they are dead, but go on talking anyway. So the central character, Caitríona Pháidín, bemoans her cheapskate burial and dreams of reinterment in a better-class grave; and all of the corpses discuss the sex lives of those below and above. Even a French aviator, who died after crash landing nearby, adds his own complaint in the style of a Parisian existentialist: 45\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\n‘Ils m’ennuient. On espère toujours trouver la paix dans le mort, mais le tombe ne semble pas encore être le mort. On ne trouve ici, en tout cas, que de l’ennui’.9 Or, as Samuel Beckett, in Paris during the winter of 1948–9, was writing about the dead: ‘To have lived is not enough for them. They have to talk about it’.10 Many centuries earlier, The Book of Common Prayer had stated that the living could not talk directly to the dead in the funeral ceremony.11 The dead could only be talked about, because they were beyond human contact. Much Irish writing after the Reformation seems like a sustained flouting of that ban on communication between living and dead. In plays from Boucicault to Behan, a dead body arises and orates. Yeats awards some of his best lines to those who speak from beyond the grave. Joyce bases his last work on the ballad of Finnegan, who rebukes the revellers at his own wake. The poet Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill has described Gaelic modernism itself as ‘the corpse which sits up and speaks’.12 Ó Cadhain’s novel is a central document in this tradition. Written in the golden age of the radio play, it is filled with contesting voices, each with its own tag line. And the graveyard’s tutelary spirit, Stoc na Cille (the Trumpet of the Graveyard), speaks in a portentous tone which is mocked by the demotic of the buried villagers, who quarrel over the number of priests or cars at one another’s funerals. Conversations are endlessly repeated, but there can be no developmental plot and, strangely, no sense of a hereafter, for the time is ‘eternity’. Lives are over and yet they inexplicably continue; and there can be no fitting tense for that magic realist world of undevelopment (later captured by Gabriel García Márquez). Parts of Cré na Cille were serialized in the Irish Press newspaper in 1948; and they brought fame to the author. People, spotting him on his way to a football match at Croke Park, would say, ‘There goes Cré na Cille’. He was the greatest master of Irish-language prose for three centuries. He had lost his job as a primary schoolteacher because of his membership of the Irish Republican Army; and 46\n\nS á i r s é a l a g u s Di l l\n\nwas interned during the Second World War by a government fearful that a pro-German wing of the IRA might jeopardize Irish neutrality. So the author (a committed anti-fascist himself ) had a good opportunity in the Curragh Camp to listen to officially ‘dead souls’ in daily conversation. By setting his dialogues among the bodies in a graveyard, he may have been voicing his despair about the very idea of language revival. The setting may have a further meaning. The author was looking to a future when his book, like certain Latin classics, would live on after its own language had fallen out of daily use. He may even have imagined a time when literature itself would be erased as a cultural institution, if not those voices which enabled it. Yet he must also have sensed, from the many near-death experiences in Irish culture, that a tradition often lives most potently in the lament for its passing. The very energy with which each death is announced in Cré na Cille seems to deny the possibility that the native language could finally die. And, despite Ó Cadhain’s fears, it still survives, albeit precariously, as a community language. The dead bodies remain as truculent as ever.\n\n47\n\nMáire Mhac an tSaoi\n\n5. A Parrot in Ringsend: Máire Mhac an tSaoi\n\nB\n\norn in 1922, and so the same age as the state, which she served well for a time as diplomat, Máire Mhac an tSaoi has never confused that state with the nation, whose traditions, oral and written, she has upheld.1 She is one of those writers who has let the literary tradition speak through her and trusted her individuality to look after itself. Oscar Wilde once joked that man is least himself when he talks with his own face but if you give him a mask, he’ll tell the truth.2 In her case, that mask was Gaelic tradition. She wrote in both English and Irish over the years, but her English had a stiffness and correctness which never manifested in Irish. There is something of the Victorian classroom about her autobiography, The Same Age as the State, whereas her Irish writing has a freshness and candour before and beyond gentility. Synge once observed that the problem with the English language was that you could never swear in it without vulgarity, but that Irish had a clarity which made any statement in it seem concise and classical. He pointed out that the word ‘shift’, which sparked off a riot at the performance of his The Playboy of the Western World, was used as ‘léine’ without difficulty in Irish.3 Mhac an tSaoi shared Synge’s dread of vulgarity, and included 49\n\nAFTER IRELAND\n\nas examples of the vulgar those metrical clichés and obvious rhythms to be found in school anthologies read by her generation, most of whose members would go on to equate such effects with ‘poetry’.4 Hers is a double language: the spoken Irish of Corcha Dhuibhne learned in childhood but also the written Irish of such master lyricists as Piaras Feirtéar. In rare moments of uncertainty, her lyrics can oscillate between slack speech and poised formality; but most often she gets the balance exactly right, in a language above grossness and below gentility, where exactitude is possible. She understands that there is a necessary tension between the language of the streets and the language of poetry. If they move too far apart, the result is a precious, factitious world of unreality; but if they are aligned too closely, the lines that ensue can be banal and lacking in intensity. Gaelic poetry had been composed almost exclusively by men – and that was true also of the poetry of sexual passion. There had been spectacular exceptions, of course, such as Caoineadh Airt Uí Laoghaire: The Lament for Art O’Leary by Eibhlín Dhubh Ní Chonaill. But usually women were the objects rather than the makers of lyrics of passion. What makes Mhac an tSaoi’s work radical is an unabashed exploration of what poets of the dánta grá knew well: chancy, risky love, most often unrequited or fatally out of synchrony. The obsession with the love object is so all-consuming as to verge at times on hatred or resentment. It is a dependency so absolute as to show scant curiosity about the psychology of the unresponding man, or indeed about what may be the blocking factor in their relationship. Desire is sinful (according to the dictates of church and com­ munity) but ever increasing. It goes beyond intellectual analysis into zones of pure emotion. The problems to which it gives rise are insoluble, but their very insolubility proves unacceptable.5 The writer shares with such immediately contemporary prose authors as Françoise Sagan and Edna O’Brien a hurt sense of ill-use at the hands of men, but retains a margin of pride and dignity. The only hope of soothing such pain is to describe it very well. 50\n\nMáire Mhac an tSaoi\n\nIt need not have been so. In early poems Mhac an tSaoi wrote"
