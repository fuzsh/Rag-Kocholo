        "text": "The Lost World of Mr. Hardy\n\nSORRY WE NO LONGER STOCK THIS ITEM!\n\nWe are proud to be agents for this wonderful film by Trufflepig Films, Ltd.!\n\nThis film covers the history of the Hardy Brothers from its inception to present day. It is beautifully filmed with a wonderful score and is both educational and entertaining for the Hardy afficianado and the casual flyfisher alike.\n\nThe filmakers have brought together James Hardy and a number of retired craftsmen, salesmen and engineers from this company's storied past, taking you inside the company as it once was back in its halcyon days. In addition, there is a treasure trove of archival footage and photographs.\n\nThe story is how this famed company was founded and its incredible growth over the years, making everything from giant rods and reels for tuna fishing to the delicate performance of the trout reels, and everything in between. It tells how the company adapted through economic times good and bad and survived a world war, and yet through it all is still making incredible tackle.\n\nThe film also features noted English rodmaker Edward Barder and centre pin reel maker Chris Lythe and explains how the emphasis by major companies has shifted over the years to mass production, opening up a carriage trade for the small independant craftsman who can still lavish attention on fine tackle for a limited yet appreciative market.\n\n97 minutes, shot in 16:9 aspect ratio, NTSC format.\n\nWe have 1 copy left in stock at $19.95 plus $3.31 first class mail or $6.10 US Priority mail shipping. The new reissue price will be $31.95! Contact us to order!\n\nScreen grabs Copyright Trufflepig Films\n\nCopyright 2008 J.D. Wagner, Inc."
