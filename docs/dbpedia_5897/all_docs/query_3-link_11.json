        "text": "This delicate, tonally complex film by Gideon Koppel is a documentary love-letter to Trefeurig, the Welsh farming community in Ceredigion where he grew up, and where his parents found refuge from Nazi Germany during the second world war. It is a rural society, outwardly placid and at one with a landscape of stunning beauty, but in fact in crisis. Koppel's film takes as its starting point the closure of the local school, a definitive, calamitous loss for a place where shops and bus services have already vanished. The movie pays tribute to the grit of a people who may yet revive their economy, but it acknowledges a darker possibility, for which the sentimental note of an \"elegy\" is not appropriate. Slowly, but surely, Trefeurig appears to be dying, and Koppel's camera captures the consequent ripples of loss and regret.\n\nThe film has richness and an unshowy compassion, its grammar and pace adjusting to the tempo of the countryside. It reminds me of work by French film-makers such as Nicolas Philibert and Raymond Depardon, and the weird dance of the fork-lifts and farm machinery has something of Our Daily Bread, Nikolaus Geyrhalter's documentary about food production. But Sleep Furiously has its own distinctive quality.\n\nThe film takes his title from Noam Chomsky's famous example of a meaningless sentence: \"Colourless green ideas sleep furiously\", but it enigmatically finds some meaning and poetry in the line. Furious sleep may be what Trefeurig is now experiencing: a grim, terrible suspicion that their communal death is now inevitable, that some line has already been crossed. They may in fact all have gone gently into that catatonic good night and all that is left is an infinitesimal moment in which to rage before the light dies entirely and sleep deepens into oblivion.\n\nNone of this cancels the beauty of what Koppel's camera finds: the shape of flapping sheets on a washing line mimics the distant quilt of fields. Overhead shots show two insect-trails of sheep, parted as if by an obstructive pebble, and then reunited. A plough methodically cuts a triangular hunk from a field. Juxtaposed with these moments are understated gestures of human comedy. Two women remember a school sports-day mishap: \"And do you remember that piglet?\" \"Phyllis from Pant-y-ffynnoon Farm got stuck underneath it.\" (This dialogue is in subtitled Welsh, incidentally; often clearer to me, in fact, than the difficult-to-catch English exchanges.) Another woman is showing someone her stuffed owl, because the wooden branch on which it is mounted will have to be shortened; she unselfconsciously describes the instructions given to her by the taxidermist she'd found in the Yellow Pages when the bird died: \"Freeze it. And then when it's really frozen, put it in the post.\" Koppel playfully allows us time to imagine a frozen owl being crammed into a jiffy bag before the scene changes. Earlier, we had seen this same woman teaching a class of small children in clay-modelling, and the children were also being instructed in music and dance by that rarest of things: a male infant-school teacher. All these scenes are tinged with regret, now that we know that the school is closing, and what awful news that is.\n\nBetween these melancholy tableaux, the visual palate is cleaned with single-colour panels, and with weird speeded-up sequences. One repeated image was a real madeleine for me: the sight of the mobile library trundling around the winding roads, a vital source of reading, thought, ideas ... everything. Trefeurig is full of people who love books. I couldn't help remembering the mobile library that used to appear in the village of my own childhood (Letchmore Heath in Hertfordshire): a purple bus, shaped like an elongated tallboy wardrobe on wheels, which, Tardis-like, had a miraculous stock of books, far more than appeared possible from the outside. It gave you the feeling, when you effortfully climbed the big steps to get in and stood in its narrow aisle between the two great walls of books, that its centre of gravity was that little bit too high and that the whole vehicle would topple over if it took a corner at anything over 15 mph - and might well do so at rest, if you moved around inside too quickly.\n\nJust as I remembered, the shelves for the Trefeurig mobile library were sloping backwards so that the books wouldn't tumble out in transit. These people don't have the luxury of worrying about e-books and Amazon Kindles changing their reading habits: they just want the mobile library to keep rolling into town.\n\nKoppel's movie ends with a powerful epigraph: \"It is only when I sense the end of things,/ that I find the courage to speak/ the courage, but not the words\". To me, it has the suppressed anger of Larkin's 1972 poem Going, Going, with its premonition of only \"concrete and tyres\" being left in England. But perhaps Koppel's film will itself trigger a resurgence and a new vitality in Trefeurig, and I hope that it does."
