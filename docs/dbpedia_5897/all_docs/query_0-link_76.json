So\neven though he writes with his right hand, he is still left handed.\nHe does everything else with his left hand.\nNo, he doesn't do everything else left handed. Just watch his\nmovies. He uses his right hand for EVERYTHING. The only two\nexceptions are in the movie Vanilla Sky and Valkyrie where his\ncharacter lost the use of his right arm. (BORN ON THE 4th OF JULY\nhe shoots his rifle left handed is it must be three then) Though,\nhe did a good job of playing someone forced to use his left hand,\nin all of his other movies (just watch) he does EVERYTHING right\nhanded. I've seen him on several list of left handed actors, and my\nbest guess as to how that happened was the pages were created by\npeople who had seen one or both of those two movies.\nAnother actor I've seen on these lists is Robert DeNiro, and he\nis NOT left handed either. I don't know what movie anyone could\npossibly have gotten that impression. It's listed on some\ninteresting facts about him that he wrote with his right hand in\nTaxi Driver even though he is left handed. Yes, he wrote with his\nright hand in Taxi Driver AND in every other movie that he has been\nin. I've also seen clips of him signing Autographs, and he uses his\nright hand to do so. Two more actors who I have seen on these lists\nwho are NOT at all left handed and I don't know where anyone got\nthe impression that they were is Brad Pitt and Jim Carrey\nWatch the movie \"The Color of Money\" for an excellent example of\nhim being left handed. He plays pool left handed. Then google \"Tom\nCruise Left Handed\" for more information. I stand by what I\nsaid.\nI have already googled Tom Cruise left handed, and it doesn't\ntell me anything that I haven't already read or seen. He did play\npool left handed in \"The Color of Money.\" You are correct. In \"The\nLast Samarai\" he also shoots a rifle left handed at the beginning\nof the movie, however, all throughout the movie, he uses a sword\nright handed. Plus he throws bottles around in \"Cocktail\" right\nhanded, and in the Mission Impossible movies or other action\nmovies, he still shoots pistols right handed. I've also just seen\nhim throw right handed in general. He also uses a knife and eats\nusing a fork or spoon right handed. I would say this makes him\nsomewhat cross-dominant at most. Either that or he is left handed,\nmakes a point of covering it up most of the time, and has a few\nslips here and there. Just because someone does something with\nhis/her left hand doesn't automatically make him/her left handed.\nHe may have shot pool and shot rifle left handed. This could be\nsomething that he took to doing because maybe he has a dominant\nleft eye. Just look at how much he does right handed. It lists in\ninteresting facts about him that he's right handed when writing but\ndoes most things left haded, but that is NOT true. You have to\nreally search for anything that makes Tom Cruise left handed, but\nit's easy to find proof that he is right handed. This is almost\nlike saying that since I turned on my light switch and opened a\ndoor with my left hand, I'm left handed now.",
