Then the Hardy boys and their high school chums are warned to stay away from the old mill. Their curiosity plunges them into peril of the most unexpected kind.\n\nDescription of current edition: \"Drop case or else danger for you and your family.\" This warning addressed to Fenton Hardy not only alarms the famous investigator and his detective sons, but also puzzles them, because Mr. Hardy is working on more than one case. Which one prompted the threat?\n\nWhen more ominous warnings follow, Frank and Joe suspect there is a link between the counterfeiting case they are investigating and a secret case their father cannot discuss since it involves national security.\n\nThe key to the solution of both cases appears to be hidden in the old Turner mill, constructed in frontier days but now a gatehouse for Elekton Controls Limited engaged in manufacturing top-secret electronic parts for space missiles. But the millhouse is occupied by two Elekton employees who are hostile to Frank and Joe and refuse to allow the young detectives to question the company's fourteen-year-old messenger boy who unknowingly may be in possession of some vital clues.\n\nDetermined to learn the secret of the old mill, Frank and Joe employ a clever ruse to gain entrance, only to find themselves trapped in a subterranean passageway. How the young detectives extricate themselves from this dangerous situation and unravel both mysteries will keep the reader tense with suspense.\n\nOriginal text available free on Project Gutenberg\n\n04: The Missing Chums - Collectible Editions For Sale\n\nCover Art & Edition Information\n\nOriginal: 1928 Leslie McFarlane (214 pages) - For Sale\n\nOutline: Edward Stratemeyer\n\nRevised: 1962 James Buechler (175 pages) - For Sale\n\nOutline: Harriet S.

One by one, Frank and Joe tackle the clues, hardly daring to think what might have happened to their missing friends.

The kidnapers ruthlessly plan to force Frank and Joe's famous detective father into choosing between justice and his sons!
