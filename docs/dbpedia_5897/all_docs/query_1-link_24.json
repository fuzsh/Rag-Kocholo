        "text": "British fishing equipment manufacturer\n\nHardy Fishing Rods is a brand of Pure Fishing.\n\nIn 1874 brothers William Hardy and John James Hardy started \"Hardy Brothers\" with the purchase of \"Superior River and Sea Fishing Tackle\" in Alnwick, Northumberland, England.[1]\n\nIn 1891 they patented and launched \"the Perfect\" fishing reel to complement the fishing lures they sold. It was successful and they received a royal warrant from King George V of the United Kingdom. They continued to create a variety of winning fishing reels, some of which had novelties including a complete bail arm and long casting reels.[2][3]\n\nIn 1897 they opened a shop in London's Pall Mall that lead to international expansion of their fishing rods, lures and guides still made by hand in England.\n\nIn 1967 Hardy Brothers was bought out by the Harris and Sheldon group and in 1985 renamed the \"House of Hardy Limited.\" It was later merged with a former Hardy employee's fishing company and renamed \"Hardy and Greys Limited\" in 2004.\n\nIn 2008 the history of the House of Hardy was made into a documentary, The Lost World of Mr. Hardy.\n\nIn 2013 the company Hardy & Greys was sold to Pure Fishing, a division of conglomerate Jarden Corporation,[4] that was later renamed Newell Brands. Newell sold Pure Fishing to Sycamore Partners in 2018.[5]\n\nHardy Fishing - official website\n\nHardy Fishing Museum - House of Hardy Fishing Tackle Museum\n\nThe Lost World of Mr. Hardy (2008) - Documentary film on the Hardy Fishing company's history of hand made."
