        "text": "In adaptions, it is important to know the history, the background. In adaptations, things can be changed to create affect and cause. In each of these adaptations of Wuthering Heights, one may find different aspects, changed costumes, actors and actresses who each bring something new or different to their character. To start off this review and analysis of Wuthering Heights and its adaptations, I will start with the most obvious and staple subject in each film. There is at least one thing that stays constant, and that is the scenery. Even in the time period of the early 1900’s when their knowledge of the 1800’s aesthetic wasn’t detailed and therefore was represented in films as more high class and southern belle than anything, the moors, Wuthering Heights, and the Grange have stayed similar; grand, big, and most importantly light and dark, respectively. However, there were things that changed within all the films. For one thing, female representation. Each Cathy from each version was portrayed differently, affected by the time period, the culture, and the perceptions of women in the era they were made. Cathy from the 1939 version of Wuthering Heights was everything a woman from the late 30’s/early 40’s was expected to be. She was dramatic, but not overly so. She maintained her cool demeanor even when she became passionate. Her 1992 counterpart was the opposite, wild and childish, giggling and unable to be tamed. She was the wild and free spirit that women of the 90’s had strived for, especially as the culture of the time period expanded with the girl power era and strong, fierce female representations became the goal.\n\nHeathcliff, in contrast, was cold and stoic. The approach of the sensible, level headed characters of the forties definitely gave the Wuthering Heights movie a feel of the classic era of movies where the female star never really lost her cool even as she slapped a servant or pinched her arms, and the male star had moments of passionate outburst amid the manly posturing and cool aloofness. In contrast, the 2009 adaptation’s approach to the story of Wuthering Heights invoked passion in all and their characters themselves were passionate. Heathcliff himself was a brilliant portrayal of the character that none of the other adaptations had really managed to nail down, in no small part because of Tom Hardy’s incredible ability to bring each role he does to life and to input such energy and vivacity to each role. Ralph Fienes portrayed him as brutal and harsh, no warmth to be seen. Even with Cathy, he appeared somewhat detached from her. The 40’s version of Heathcliff was certainly no better in his approach to passion for Cathy. As with all 1939’s characters, there is always a cool detachment from the other characters, a wall between them that covered their emotions and kept them from becoming too emotional. This was not so with Tom Hardy’s portrayal of the character. He didn’t shy away from exposing his emotions to the world in subtle ways like the tears that filled his eyes at his moments of greatest anguish, the only times he allowed his emotions to be so clearly seen, the subtle hints of them elsewhere in the film like when he tried to seduce Isabelle with a kiss, and the gleam that came to his eyes when he spotted the perfect moment to jump on his prey, his oppressors, and take his revenge. We saw the latter especially well when he played poker with Hindley and swindled him into letting Heathcliff tan his back with a belt, as he had done to him when he was a young man for no other reason than to take his aggression, his repressed anger for his father, and his loathing for Heathcliff out on Heathcliff’s back until he bled.\n\nBut, in an effort to stay away from praising and monologue-ing about Tom Hardy, I shall move on to the other aspects of the adaptations. Having a good sense of historical and biographical context can really help the readers/watchers to better understand various parts of the story or the culture-text as a whole, to paraphrase my lovely British Literature professor. The manners, the rules of society, even the clothing and how restrictive it could be to women, all help the reader/watcher to better understand parts of the story. For instance, the manners of the time period. You cannot really comprehend just how offensive and rough Heathcliff’s manners are, his habit of cursing, his dress, even his lack of background. The latter especially is not something our society today particularly finds offensive or criminal. While we haven’t traveled so far away from that aspect of family and background being important to a person’s identity and even a factor in the judgment of a person, we no longer alienate people who were orphans and foster kids as they did in the 1800’s. The impact it had on the lives of those without parents was much greater than it is today, the stigmatization far crueler. Heathcliff’s lack of blood family pops up frequently in the beginning of the story, both book and movie. Linton and Hindley are the two characters who most often touch on the subject. When Heathcliff and Cathy are caught peaking in at the Lintons, as Mr. Linton and his servant observe the two and gather Cathy up to bring her inside, they remark about why she might be running across the countryside with a dirty gypsy. In the 2009 version of Wuthering Heights, when Edgar calls Heathcliff a gypsy, his sister responds that he doesn’t look like a gypsy anymore as she watches him approach to enter the room in the moment of his big reveal to Cathy and Edgar, the first time they’ve seen him in years and only to find him dressed as sharply as a gentleman of high class, with the hair and the manner of one to match. And earlier, Hindley, in a fit of rage, grabs Heathcliff roughly by the chin and around his neck, shoving him against a chair in the corner of the room during the holiday party at Wuthering Heights when Cathy still lived there as Catherine Earnshaw. He bends him over to shove his face against the furniture while he leans in and growls in his ear loudly, “Been combing your pretty curls, have you? Your dirty gypsy locks, you fiend!”\n\nThe most prominent theme I want to discuss, however, is how different approaches to adaptations can our perceptions of the stories. This is so strongly the case with the 2009 Wuthering Heights which I fell in love with shortly after watching, and not just because the wonderful Tom Hardy played the ruggedly handsome Heathcliff, matching his description in both an aesthetically pleasing and accurate way. Each of the death scenes in each movie are different to each other. In the 2009 version, the scene between Cathy and Heathcliff was softly passionate and sweet. Her words, her dialogue, however, were not the same as that of the other movies or the book. In fact, she only manages to speak a few sentences before she lies limply in his arms, staring up at him or a thousand miles away, completely unaware of her surroundings. And afterwards, when Ellen finally approaches Heathcliff to give him the news, the scene that follows brings a different take to the loud and antagonizing words in the scenes of the book and other adaptations, but this is arguably the most impactful. Heathcliff is quiet at first, before he spews strong sarcasm that never tips the line past overdone. There are tears in his eyes and throughout the scene, you can really see how he is affected and almost feel his pain with him. His emotions are real and palpable, and he gives an animalistic howl of pain. I’d never understood the analogy before I watched this scene, but finally understanding it gave a new curve to the character Heathcliff in my mind. This really changed my perception of the scene then when I had read it. In fact, this entire movie has painted Heathcliff in a whole new light I had never imagined. And, the scene where he digs into her grave so he can hold her body and kiss her one more time is so visceral. The scene also brought a new understanding to the sentence in the book when he confesses to Ellen how he dug up her grave to see her again. He swears to her that she looked as fresh as she had the last time he’d laid eyes on her, un-decomposed and whole. Watching as Tom Hardy embraces her skeleton, crooning soft words to her in a tone full of heartbreak, was powerful and more visual than the book. This particularly scene really pays homage to the adaptation type pictorial realization which Leitch mentions in his article Between Adaptation and Allusion. “a celebration of cinema’s power to show things words can present only indirectly” (Leitch, pg. 5). Indeed, her description matches the movie adaptation very well. The movie does well in replicating scenes from the book in brilliant detail that paints a vibrant image of that which we had formed in our heads as we read the original. In fact, much like the example in his article of Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein, the movie took a scene from the book that consisted of a short, perfunctory mention of Heathcliff’s invasion of Cathy’s grave, and re-imagined it in greater detail to really cause an impact on the watcher’s senses and mind. There were, of course, other adaptation titles one could attach to the movie, however this is the one that was the most prominent. But also, the type of Adjustment, expansion, is used here as well. In the movie, there are two scenes not written in the book that add to the movie. They bring new emotions, new understanding to the story. These two scenes are when Isabelle is walking down the road away from Wuthering Heights and runs into Edgar, and the touching scene between Heathcliff and Hareton as they casually talk in a scene that held an air of fatherly son interaction. In the first, Isabelle begs her brother to listen to her and to help her, to forgive her even though he claims there’s nothing to forgive, because he so obviously is placing a wall between the two of them as a result of her decision to run away with Heathcliff in the first place. Edgar remains seemingly unaffected by her pleas, and by all accounts seems to have put her behind him, riding off with a last parting shot that if she really wants to do something for him, she can convince the villain that she married to leave the country. “Do not close your heart on me. Do not close your heart!” The second scene was more intimate. There was nothing particularly moving about it so much as it showed us a glimpse into the relationship Hareton and Heathcliff had, a scene that showed Heathcliff didn’t abuse and scorn Hareton violently as the other adaptations and the book made the reader and watcher think, but treated him with the smallest amount of fatherly toleration. He was a tenet in his house that he was only a little closer with and less volatile than his servants.\n\nThe scenes were not the only thing that the different take on the adaptation had changed. Indeed, the characters were different than I had imagined. Hareton, for instance, was not as rough, softer in this movie than in the book, and even better dressed. He presented as a young man who wasn’t well educated but was soft spoken and born with gentlemanly ways. Young Catherine, too, was different than the book’s version. She was less pettish, childish, and prejudiced. In speaking of Hareton, in fact, the movie showed his relationship with Heathcliff, displaying a fatherly relationship between the two while Heathcliff sat before the fire and Hareton inquired as to whether he was ill or not. This was something neither the book, nor the other adaptations tapped into, and as such, it gave the movie much more depth along with an interesting new take on something only previously alluded to. The final scenes, however, were the most powerful. The wide shots of the house, leading to Heathcliff, who lay on his bed despondent, eyes glazed, muttering and crooning to Cathy to visit him, begging her, where so powerful. One could not watch the scene and still perceive Heathcliff to be a cold-hearted man incapable of loving anyone anymore. Heathcliff’s final scene, his terrible ending, was so much more emotional than any of the other adaptations and the book itself could be. The emotions it conveyed were strong and captured me in the magical web the story had weaved. It was tragic, heartfelt, and I felt more strongly emotions inside of me watching that scene, than I did any of the others or while reading the book. Indeed, this entire adaptation has changed my view of Heathcliff. The emotional tale, that brilliantly evokes in everyone thoughts and feelings, and forces them to think about Heathcliff rather than dismissing him as a villain, ended with an affirmation that the two spirits ended up together after all as their ghosts walked up to the plated glass window. Adaptations have the power to take their original stories so much farther, to force the readers/watchers to think and to challenge, and there is not greater example in my opinion than this brilliantly done BBC film version of Wuthering Heights.\n\nCathy Earnshaw, may you not rest. Not while I’m living.\n\nDuring this scene, the dialogue that all the other adaptations saved from the book was missing here, yet there was no real loss. Because, in place of the dialogue was the powerful image of Cathy lost to the world and only anchored by the tight grip her lover held her in, and the strong emotional performance of Tom Hardy.\n\nYou’d said I’d killed you. Haunt me then. Be with me always. Take any form. Drive me mad. But don’t leave me in the abyss where I can’t find you. I cannot live without my life.
