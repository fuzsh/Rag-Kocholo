        "text": "Here is author Dean Koontz’s sixth and final volume of the second season of adventures starring a mysterious agent who has been Nameless through most of the previous volumes. Zero In provides a powerful little capstone to this season’s overarching plot, the assembly of a mystery force that will someday pervert the good old United States of America into a totalitarian state, opening concentration camps and performing full scale genocide on decent, salt-of-the-earth folks. However, it also fills in some blanks both about Nameless’ past and the true identity behind Nameless’ handler, the enigmatic Ace of Diamonds. Basically, we have a lot of territory to cover in a short amount of time, and though Dean Koontz is perhaps best known for some doorstop sized novels like the epic Strangers or the dark fantasy Twilight Eyes, he well knows how to handle the short form. I’ve looked into his short novels and novellas quite thoroughly (some might quip exhaustively) over the last couple of years, and it is always a treat to see how the author handles the form. A good portion of those works were released as lures to prospective readers, hooks to snare new eyes corresponding to the release of this or that new novel. However, the Nameless series has been given the aegis of a television or streaming service show, divided into seasons/series, each novella an episode. This format choice works; at least, it has worked for me.\n\nZero In might be a standalone story, but it works best when read after the other pieces in the various two series. Sure, it has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Sure, it has an engaging protagonist we can root for. Sure, it’s an emotional rollercoaster ride as we pit a protagonist against overwhelming odds in an effort to circumvent a terrible totalitarian future. However, the novella gains punch the more experience we have with the character of Nameless himself. As with the Philip Marlowe novels by Raymond Chandler, a reader’s response to The Long Goodbye is directly influenced by the number of Marlowe books read prior to it. It’s far easier to say goodbye to strangers than to those we’ve known for a little longer, those whose stories we have been invited to listen to or share in.\n\nI came to Zero In after eleven short works, and it provides both a satisfying conclusion to this Season but a nice note to perhaps end the series on. Will Koontz return to this character and series? Honestly, I hope not. There are beautiful, dare we say poetic conclusions that should be left alone. By the end of this book we get a sense of not only conclusion but completion for the characters of Nameless as well as his handler, Ace of Diamonds. It’s a neat trick to accomplish in a short span of pages.\n\nZero In covers a lot of ground in a short amount of time. In that way, it can feel a little rushed, particularly as we speed into the final sections. I might have preferred another novella in the middle to handle the Nameless and Ace of Diamond’s stuff, as well as giving a more definitive explanation as to the amnesia process, the reasons Nameless participated in the project, as well as Ace’s origin. Of course, such a story might have been too much exposition and not enough action to interest the author, and there are some wonderful chances in intercut contemporary echoes and intrusions into the exposition to keep things lively. Some of this material got revealed in the final chapter of Season One (Memories of Tomorrow), but it gets a newer, more intriguing angle here and the gaps left from that previous entry are filled in nicely.\n\nThis novella also tackles the triskelion gang—herein identified as One Solution, a name which sends a little chill along the spine of anyone familiar with the Nazi treatment of Jews, homosexuals, and other “undesirables” in World War II’s European Theater—giving us the faces and personalities of that group’s inner circles, from the leader and founder, Talman Arinwald, to the others who, for sick reasons of their own, want to be part of a mad scheme.\n\nHere we start to see a little bit of overrun between the individual villains. All of them are narcissistic fiends. There is one, a corrupt U. S. Senator with a lust for womanflesh and the scruples of a wolverine, who finds himself in over his head with his current Chinese mistress as well as Nameless, but the others are cut from incredibly similar cloths. I suspect that, were this book expanded a bit, the author could show off their differences a little more strongly. Aside from the head honcho, the aforementioned politician, and a software developer with a chip on her shoulder, the others kind of blurred for me. They did not have any real sense of individuality, or if they did it was brief enough to pass over during the mad rush toward the finale.\n\nThat One Solution group’s ultimate aim, at least so far as Talman Arinwald is concerned, might also trigger some familiarity bells from Koontz’s longtime readers, since it brings to mind some of the elements of another of Koontz’s works, in particular some of the science fictional elements of the novel 77 Shadow Street. That novel, of course, features the strange goings on in an apartment building at that address, and the big reveal involves a few sf conceits as well as dark fantasy and literary suspense ones—in other words, the kinds of weirdness that makes Koontz’s best works stick out in my memory. The author cracked into publishing as a writer of sf paperback originals before he found success in the suspense and horror worlds, and many of his best books still take notes from the sf genre. It is clearly here in the Nameless series, what with the paranormal powers Nameless has, his visions of a totalitarian future as well as flashes of near future events he might be able to change.\n\nZero In brings some additional sf elements more to the fore, as it employs some bleeding edge tech in its revelations and its conclusion. Nothing outrageous or utterly unbelievable—that’s one of the tricks Koontz learned from his sf days, blending the what if with enough verisimilitude to allow us to suspend disbelief without hanging it from the neck until dead.\n\nFrom a structural perspective, Zero In mates up well with other stories from this second season of adventures. As with at least three of the stories in this season, the novella can be cleanly divided into two sections. The first of these could be considered “Bringing Nameless Up To Speed” while the final portion involves “Nameless Vs. One Solution.” There’s a far less clean break between the two pieces here than is found in Kaleidoscope, but the episode certainly has the feel of two distinct chunks mashed together.\n\nZero In might take its time getting to the action-packed meat a bit more than some readers are patient for, after all it is concerned with revealing hidden Truths about multiple topics. However, the story never simply spins its wheels. The conclusion achieved is a compelling one for this particular series. It’s the literary equivalent of a streaming service show, ready for binging. The overarching plot has a good foundation and though the actual finale is a bit speedier than some readers might have preferred, it ends well. Arguably not terrific or altogether happily for all characters involved, but it certainly ends well.\n\n#\n\nZero In is available in eBook and audiobook editions.\n\nNext week, we will continue our Dean Koontz mini-reading series with a glance at his novella, Trapped. A woman and her child stuck in a deadly winter storm find their home invaded by a strange evil. They might be trapped, but they are not quite helpless. Trapped is most easily available in the author’s Strange Highways collection, which is out in a paperback edition. The novella also appears in an audiobook anthology, Great Mysteries, Great Writers.\n\nWORKS CITED\n\nKoontz, Dean. Zero In.
