Burke,\n\nFrom my list on YA fantasy about hope in dark places.\n\nBy Katy Huth Jones Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\n“Hope in dark places” has been the theme of my life, beginning at age 17 when my parents disowned me for my faith. I’ve walked through the “valley of the shadow of death” twice, battling cancer, and endured many other struggles, which everyone faces at some time in their lives. Reading Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey as a teen gave me the courage to face the darkness, and so the characters in the stories I write and prefer to read do likewise.\n\nKaty's book list on YA fantasy about hope in dark places\n\nWhy did Katy love this book?\n\nOnly rarely have I read a book that affected me as profoundly as this one. Having survived cancer twice, this story of a young girl living with a terminal disease left me in a puddle of emotions, yet it has so much life and hope. Niya is such a strong heroine, she inspires me to never, ever give up! And Alk the fire salamander is one of the most memorable fantasy characters ever.\n\nBy H.L. Burke,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Spice Bringer as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA deadly disease. A vanishing remedy. A breathless journey. All her life, Niya's known she will die young from the fatal rasp. She survives only with the aid of vitrisar spice and a magical, curmudgeonly fire salamander named Alk. Then an ambitious princess burns down the vitrisar grove in an effort to steal Alk so she can claim her rightful throne. Joined by Jayesh, a disgraced monk, Niya and Alk must flee to the faraway Hidden Temple with the last vitrisar plant, or all who suffer from the rasp will perish. But even as Niya’s frustration and banter with Jayesh…\n\nPreview\n\nResistance\n\nBy Jaye L.

The half-human Jace is hated and feared only because he is half ryrik, so I felt great sympathy for him, having been hated by those I loved. It hurts so badly, which made me hurt for Jace. Another character who later befriends Jace lives in a dangerous situation and faces terrible persecution in an especially memorable scene. It made me wonder if I could be as steadfast in her place. Both encourage me to be courageous in difficult situations.\n\nBy Jaye L. Knight,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Resistance as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“Don’t you know? Animals like you have no soul.\"Could God ever love a half-blood all of society looks upon with such fear and disdain? Jace once believed so, but when a tragic loss shatters the only peace he’s ever known, his faith crumbles as the nagging doubts he’s tried to put behind him descend on his grieving heart.

I’ve walked through the “valley of the shadow of death” twice, battling cancer, and endured many other struggles, which everyone faces at some time in their lives. Reading Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey as a teen gave me the courage to face the darkness, and so the characters in the stories I write and prefer to read do likewise.\n\nKaty's book list on YA fantasy about hope in dark places\n\nWhy did Katy love this book?\n\nWhen I first started reading this fantasy book club selection, I thought it would be a simple sort-of-like Cinderella tale and didn’t expect to be sucked into Leah’s story. My heart went out to her for all the ways she was unfairly treated and misunderstood, for I have known that pain. She was trying to save the royal family, and the queen exiled her!\n\nThe best part about this story is how brave and loyal Leah is, and how she doesn’t complain, even when she has good reason. I remember how difficult it was not to complain when I was a teen, so I especially appreciate the encouragement Leah gives without realizing it.\n\nBy Laurie Lucking,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Common as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 13, 14, 15, and 16.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOnly one person knows of the plot against the royal family and cares enough to try to stop it—the servant girl they banished.\n\nLeah spends her days scrubbing floors, polishing silver, and meekly curtsying to nobility. Nothing distinguishes her from the other commoners serving at the palace, except her red hair.\n\nAnd her secret friendship with Rafe, the Crown Prince of Imperia.\n\nBut Leah’s safe, ordinary world begins to splinter. Rafe’s parents announce his betrothal to a foreign princess, and she unearths a plot to overthrow the royal family. When she reports it without proof, her life shatters completely when…\n\nPreview\n\nHeartless Hette\n\nBy M. L. Farb,\n\nFrom my list on YA fantasy about hope in dark places.\n\nBy Katy Huth Jones Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\n“Hope in dark places” has been the theme of my life, beginning at age 17 when my parents disowned me for my faith. I’ve walked through the “valley of the shadow of death” twice, battling cancer, and endured many other struggles, which everyone faces at some time in their lives. Reading Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey as a teen gave me the courage to face the darkness, and so the characters in the stories I write and prefer to read do likewise.\n\nKaty's book list on YA fantasy about hope in dark places\n\nWhy did Katy love this book?\n\nI confess, I was a bit nervous when I began this book because the main character was not very sympathetic. But Hette’s situation is so heart-wrenching (literally, because a sorcerer has stolen her heart) I kept reading to see what happened. Her journey to recover her heart is much more than a physical adventure, though I could taste the grit and mud, shivered with cold, and sweated from the unbearable heat she struggled through. It was a joy watching this young queen learn important life lessons in totally unexpected places. I felt as if I was learning and growing along with Hette, making the reading of this book a completely satisfying experience.\n\nBy M. L. Farb,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Heartless Hette as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nCome to Germania, where a clockwork heart rules and a fool advises–and a laugh can bring both to their knees.\n\nWhen Princess Hette refuses a sorcerer's proposal, he retaliates by stealing her heart—literally.\n\nDesperate to resist his influence, Hette makes herself emotionless, stifling all feelings until she can find her heart and win it back. Only Konrad, the despised Court Fool, knows where to find the sorcerer, and he has his own curse to battle.\n\nRiddles and magic plague their path, including a memory stealing witch, an unbeatable knight, and a magic book that would as soon drown them as…\n\nPreview\n\nIn the Heart of the Fire\n\nBy Dean Koontz,\n\nFrom my list on where science gets twisted into stories that thrill.\n\nBy Carol Potenza Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nOne of the reasons I started writing is because I wanted to create stories where I got to learn. I’m a scientist by trade—a molecular biologist and genetic engineer. All those years of concentrated schooling into a very narrow niche left little time to explore other corners of education—history, archeology, anthropology, art… Creating and writing stories allows me to build thrilling fiction using my scientific background and weaving in whatever feeds my soul and unlocks my imagination. I have never had so much fun and felt so fulfilled, and I highly recommend it.\n\nCarol's book list on where science gets twisted into stories that thrill\n\nWhy did Carol love this book?\n\nA great book’s superpower is a story that sticks with the reader for a long time, as the Nameless collection did with me.\n\nDean Koontz is a master of creating deep anguish in his characters that propel their actions. Mix this emotion with science involving the brain and selective memory and you get the main character, Nameless, who doesn’t know who he is or remember his history.\n\nWhy? He willingly participates in targeted assassinations to eradicate evil from this world. Why? The quest for answers keeps the pages turning, allowing tantalizing glimpses of Nameless’s past life. When the answers are finally bared by a devastating revelation in the final story, we understand why Nameless chose his fate—because sometimes wish we could do the same.\n\nBy Dean Koontz,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked In the Heart of the Fire as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA bloodthirsty sheriff is terrorizing a small Texas town where justice has been buried with his victims. Until Nameless arrives—a vigilante whose past is a mystery and whose future is written in blood.\n\nAnyone who crosses Sheriff Russell Soakes is dead, missing, or warned. One of them is a single mother trying to protect her children but bracing herself for the worst. Nameless fears the outcome. He’s seen it in his visions. Now it’s time to teach the depraved Soakes a lesson in fear. But in turning predators into prey, will Nameless unearth a few secrets of his own?\n\nFrom…\n\nPreview\n\nA Short, Offhand, Killing Affair\n\nBy Paul Foos,\n\nWhy did Peter love this book?\n\nI hate books that make history bloodless and gloss over the often-ugly events that made the world what it is today. This is a short book with a lot of emotional energy, mostly in the form of burning outrage and irony.\n\nI also really enjoyed how he made the voices of the American soldiers the central part of this book.\n\nBy Paul Foos,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked A Short, Offhand, Killing Affair as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe dark side of Manifest Destiny; The Mexican-American War (1846-48) found Americans on new terrain. A republic founded on the principle of armed defense of freedom was now going to war on behalf of Manifest Destiny, seeking to conquer an unfamiliar nation and people. Through an examination of rank-and-file soldiers, Paul Foos sheds new light on the war and its effect on attitudes toward other races and nationalities that stood in the way of American expansionism. Drawing on wartime diaries and letters not previously examined by scholars, Foos shows that the experience of soldiers in the war differed radically from…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Coldest War\n\nBy James Brady,\n\nFrom my list on famous battles that make you want to be there.\n\nBy Andrew Lubin Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhen reading about famous battles such as Thermopylae, Tarawa, the Chosin Reservoir, or Taffy-3’s gallantry off Samar: have you ever wondered “what makes young men fight against such overwhelming odds?” Or a more important question: “would I do the same?” I know I wondered. Both my mom and dad were WW2 Marines, and I was raised with the stories of the Marines at Tarawa wading a half-mile ashore against horrific Japanese fire, along with their epic Korean War 79-mile fighting retreat in -50’F bitter cold and snow while grossly outnumbered by the Chinese army; these were often our dinnertime discussions and impromptu leadership lessons.\n\nAndrew's book list on famous battles that make you want to be there\n\nWhy did Andrew love this book?\n\nThose of us who read newspaper remember James Brady, who wrote Page Six a Hollywood gossip column that ran every Sunday for 25 years on the last page of Parade magazine.\n\nWhat few knew is that James Brady was a Marine officer who’d seen combat in the Korean War, and lived to write 13 fiction and five nonfiction books, with his autobiography, “The Coldest Winter” nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nBrady often described himself as “an immature 23-year old when I left for Korea, but when I left nine months later I was a grown-up and a pretty good Marine officer,” and reading his story, you’ll see this ‘pretty good Marine officer’ became a ‘pretty fine author.’\n\nBrady concentrates on the Marines in his unit and his growth as an officer in leading them. Except for ‘Saving Private Ryan and few others, combat isn’t near as glorious or macho as…\n\nBy James Brady,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Coldest War as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nJames Brady's The Coldest War is a powerful and moving memoir of the Korean War.\n\nAmerica's \"forgotten war\" lasted just thirty-seven months, yet 54,246 Americans died in that time -- nearly as many as died in ten years in Vietnam. On the fiftieth anniversary of this devastating conflict, James Brady tells the story of his life as a young marine lieutenant in Korea.\n\nIn 1947, seeking to avoid the draft, nineteen-year-old Jim Brady volunteered for a Marine Corps program that made him a lieutenant in the reserves on the day he graduated college. He didn't plan to find himself in…\n\nPreview\n\nFor Cause and Comrade\n\nBy James M. McPherson,\n\nWhy did Douglas love this book?\n\nJames McPherson, the dean of Civil War scholars, is known to most readers as the author of Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era, far and away the best single-volume history of the conflict. But this volume, which came out roughly a decade later in 1997, was one of the first military histories to move beyond generals and commanders and examine why common soldiers enlisted and remained loyal to their fellows even as the bloody conflict dragged on.\n\nAfter reading tens of thousands of letters and diaries of more than one thousand U.S. and C.S.A. soldiers, McPherson opens previously shuttered windows into their hearts and minds. Their letters home reveal both the tedium and terror of numerous campaigns, and most of all, show how common soldiers were forced to wrestle with the issue of slavery, with northern soldiers, rather like their commander-in-chief, increasingly committed to ending the South’s…\n\nBy James M. McPherson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked For Cause and Comrade as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nGeneral John A. Wickham, commander of the famous 101st Airborne Division in the 1970s and subsequently Army Chief of Staff, once visited Antietam battlefield. Gazing at Bloody Lane where, in 1862, several Union assaults were brutally repulsed before they finally broke through, he marveled, `You couldn't get American soldiers today to make an attack like that.' Why did those men risk certain death, over and over again, through countless bloody battles and four long,\n\nawful years ? Why did the conventional wisdom - that soldiers become increasingly cynical and disillusioned as war progresses - not hold true in the Civil…\n\nPreview\n\nDays Without End\n\nBy Sebastian Barry,\n\nWhy did Larry love this book?\n\nBarry, Irish, conjures a vision of the Civil War era American West that redefines the American experience.\n\nA young Irish refugee fleeing the Great Famine which has wiped out his family, ends up in Missouri where he hooks up with another orphan and a lifelong love affair begins.
