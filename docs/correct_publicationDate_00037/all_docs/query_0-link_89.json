        "text": "âMurder Saunaâ is a new short âgoreletâ by Michael Arnzen, read here at the beginning of his reading (with Timons Esaias) at a Halloween poetry event at AF Booksellers in Pittsburgh, PA on Oct. 26th, 2016. Arnzen has been an SFPA member since the late 1980s and is author of The Gorelets Omnibus, Freakcidents, and several other poetry collections.

Her poems have appeared in a variety of literary magazines, including Room, Carousel, and On Spec. She lives in Regina, SK, with her husband and their cat, Jean Grey.\n\n~\n\nIâd like the listener to think not about who the narrator is in âThe Wood,â but rather who the individual referred to as âsheâ might be. Halloween is about death, which is why it scares people. Fall is part of the cycle of nature, the slow dying into winter. The next step is spring: rebirth. Who or what is being reborn in âThe Woodâ? This is the first appearance of the poem in any medium. For more info on Denise Dumars, see DeniseDumars.com\n\n~\n\nJohn S. Tumlin, the author, has been a satellite tracker for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, short-order cook, college professor, hauler of sheetrock, professional actor (on stage and in films you never heard of), skeptical UFO investigator, tracker of black rhinos in Zimbabwe with Earthwatch, father of three, and, more recently, grandfather of two. His poetry has appeared in Aoifeâs Kiss, Star*Line, Illumen, and elsewhere. A limited edition of 19 of his poems illuminated by the calligraphic artist Risa Gettler was published in 2014 under the title A Few Excerpts from the New Intergalactic Song Fest and Cosmic Miscellany. Some other samples of his poetry may be found on johnstumlin.com but the contact e-mail button currently leads to a defunct address. The author hopes to remedy this problem soon.\n\n~\n\nâChildhood Halloweensâ by Elizabeth (Lizl) Bennefeld, written for the 2016 SFPA Halloween Poetry Reading, looks back to a time when all monsters were friendly and the scary bits of Halloween ended in laughter and happy surprises.

Karen A. Romanko, Raven Electrick Ink, 2011, and was nominated into The 2012 Rhysling Anthology. I adore black cats, and always make sure to have one living with me; these loyal friends have often inspired my writingâand my life. Though among the smartest and friendliest of cats, black cats have traditionally had the hardest time being adopted, and are in danger on Halloweenâplease consider adopting a black cat friend!\n\nWith a Master's in English literature, Adele Gardner has twice won 3rd place in the Rhysling Awards of the Science Fiction Poetry Association.
