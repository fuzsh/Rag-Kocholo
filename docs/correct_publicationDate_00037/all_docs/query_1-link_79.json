        "text": "One of the best aspects of being regent of my chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution is exploring our colonial connections to Georgetown, a neighborhood many of our members call home.\n\nOne such connection started out as a sad discovery, but — thanks to the unifying work of like-minded women — was turned into a happy ending.\n\nLast year, as the Constitution Chapter looked ahead to our 120th anniversary, I did some cursory searches online for information on the ladies who started our organization back in 1898.\n\nI happened upon the Wikipedia page of our founding regent, Judith Ellen Horton Foster, and learned about her remarkably progressive life. She was a lawyer before women had the right to vote, an author before most of her peers even considered a college education and a passionate lecturer on politics and temperance when women’s voices were discounted and derided."
