        "text": "A hotel with mysterious guests, a city where the moon wanders, an abandoned seaside pavilion, are some of the places visited in this, Richard Lambert’s second collection. Structured around a movement from city to sea and always alert to the emotional resonance of landscape, The Nameless Places dwells on those spaces that lie at the edge of our lives and vision, and that seem somewhere between reality and dream.\n\nThe collection culminates in a sequence that follows a journey made along the course of a river from its source to its mouth. Here, an English landscape’s margins are investigated suburb, waste ground, marsh, and estuary beach. In poems that are formally various (rondeau, villanelle and sonnet) and conjuring an atmosphere of melancholy, The Nameless Places explores forgotten and neglected spaces both of the mind and of our physical world.\n\n***\n\nOn the wall there’s a silhouette\n\nyou find its just a shadow from the trees\n\nbecause the opera house is empty for now of course\n\n1: THE REBEL ANGEL\n\n***\n\n(@Arc_Poetry, 7 February 2018, e-book, 59 pages, borrowed from @natpoetrylib via @OverDriveInc)\n\n***\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\n***\n\nI really enjoyed reading The Nameless Places. The poems are quite short and full of vivid details, images and descriptions. There is a hunting undertone to this collection, a sense of desolation and sadness. I also liked the fact the poems use a range of different poetic styles. I really liked the image used for the cover as well."
