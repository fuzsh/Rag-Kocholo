The monster was dying to have a name. So he decided to set out on a journey to find his name.\n\nBut the world was a large place, so the monster split into two on his journey. One monster went to the East. And the other went to the West. The monster who went East came to a village. \"Mr. Blacksmith, please give me your name.\"\n\n\"You can't give someone a name.\"\n\n\"If you give me your name, I'll jump into your stomach and make you strong in return.\"\n\n\"Really? You'll make me stronger? Okay, you can have my name.\"\n\nAnd the monster went inside the blacksmith's stomach.\n\nThe monster became Otto the blacksmith. Otto was the strongest man in town. But one day, \"Look at me, look at me. The monster inside me has grown this large.\"\n\nMunch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp. The hungry monster ate Otto from the inside. He went back to being a monster without a name.\n\nHe jumped into the stomach of Hans the shoemaker, but Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp. He went back to being a monster without a name.\n\nHe jumped into the stomach of Thomas the hunter, but Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp. And once again he was a monster without a name.\n\nThe monster went to a castle to look for a wonderful name.\n\n\"If you give me your name, I'll make you strong.\"\n\n\"If you'll heal my sickness, I'll give you my name.\" The monster jumped into the boy's stomach. The king was delighted.\n\n\"The prince is well. The prince is well.\"\n\nThe monster liked the boy's name. He liked living in the castle. So even when he was hungry, he stayed put. Every day he was so hungry, but he stayed put.\n\nBut one day he was just too hungry. \"Look at me. Look at me. The monster inside me has grown this large,\" said the boy. The boy ate the king and and all the servants. Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp.\n\nOne day, the boy came upon the monster who had gone west.\n\n\"I have a name. It's a wonderful name,\" said the boy.\n\nThe monster who went west replied, \"You don't need a name. You can be happy without a name. Because we are nameless monsters.\"\n\nThe boy ate the monster who went west. Even though he had finally found a name, there was no one left to call him by it.\n\nWhat a wonderful name it was, Johan......\n\nText (Alternative)\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a nameless monster. The monster was dying to have a name, so the monster set out on a journey to find one. But the world was a very large place. The monster split into two and went on their way. One monster went East. One went to the West. The monster who went to the East found a village. At the village's entrance there lived a blacksmith.\n\n\"Mr.Blacksmith, give me your name\" said the monster.\n\n\"I can't give you my name\" the blacksmith replied.\n\n\"In return for giving me your name, I'll go inside of you and make you strong.\"\n\n\"Really? If you make me strong, I'll give you my name.\" The monster went inside the blacksmith. Thus, the monster became, Otto the blacksmith. Otto the blacksmith was the strongest man in the village. But then one day... \"Look at me, look at me. The monster inside me is getting so big.\" He said. Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp. The hungry monster ate Otto from the inside out. Once again, he was a monster without a name.\n\nWhen he went inside Hans the shoemaker, however... Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp. When he went inside Thomas the hunter, but... Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp.The monster was nameless once again. The monster went to a castle to find a nice name. Inside the castle lived a sick boy.\n\n\"If you give me your name, I'll make you strong.\"\n\n\"If you can heal my illness and make me strong. I'll give you my name.\" The monster went inside the boy. The boy became full of vigor. The king was overjoyed.\n\n\"The prince is healthy. The prince is healthy.\" The monster liked the boy's name. He also liked living in the castle. So he restrained himself even though he was hungry. Day after day, he would be terribly hungry, but he restrained himself. But the hunger became just too great.\n\n\"Look at me. Look at me. The monster inside me has gotten this big,\" said the boy. The boy devoured the king and and all his servants. Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp.\n\nEveryone was gone, so the boy went on a journey. He walked for days and days. One day, the boy came upon the monster who had gone west. \"I have a name. It's a wonderful name.\" Said the boy. The monster who went west replied.\n\n\"I don't need a name. I'm perfectly happy without one, after all, that's what we are--nameless monsters.\" The boy ate up the monster who went west. At last he had found a name, but there was no longer anyone around to call him by it. Such a shame, because Johan was such a wonderful name.\n\nText (English dubbed version)\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a nameless monster.\n\nThe monster was dying to have a name.\n\nSo the monster made up his mind, and set out on a journey to look for one.\n\nBut the world was such a very large place.\n\nThe monster split in two, and went on separate journeys.\n\nOne went east.\n\nThe other headed west.\n\nThe one who went east came upon a village.\n\nThere was a blacksmith who lived at the village's entrance.\n\n\"Mr. Blacksmith, please give me your name!\" said the monster.\n\n\"I can't give you my name!\" replied the blacksmith.\n\n'If you give me your name, I'll go inside you and make you strong,\" said the monster.\n\n\"Really?\" said the blacksmith, \"If you make me stronger, I'll give you my name.\"\n\nThe monster went into the blacksmith.\n\nAnd so, the monster became Otto the blacksmith.\n\nOtto was the strongest man in town.\n\nBut then one day he said, \"Look at me!
