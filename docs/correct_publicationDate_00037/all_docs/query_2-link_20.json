He is certainly one to watch.” Tim Liardet\n\n“Richard Lambert has the true poet’s gift for transcending the commonplace…” John Mole\n\nRichard Lambert’s poetry has been described as startling and spare, and this, his second full-length collection, is and certainly both of these. He writes about desolate man-made environments, weather-torn open spaces, the natural world and its inhabitants – and water is everywhere. Yet these are not depressing poems. There is a delicacy, compassion and numinosity about them which makes this an intriguing and compelling collection."
