        "text": "I haven′t slept, but I'm not tired\n\nIt′s 4 a.m., a moonless night is alive\n\nMy head is clear, the morning is fresh\n\nIt's good to be awake like this\n\nIt feels like it's been light for years\n\nMy eyes wide to the dark of this hotel room\n\nAnd an open window above a parking lot\n\nProlific motion, I forgot\n\nNameless places, they are all the same\n\nNameless faces I will not remember\n\nYou are on my mind again\n\nWith poetry and rhyme\n\nIt′s as if you′re still here with me\n\nAfter all this time\n\nIt's been a while since I recall\n\nAnd now I′m flooded and miles away\n\nThe sleeping beauty in my heart concealed\n\nAwakens now to the kiss of the wind\n\nNameless places, they are all the same\n\nNameless faces I will not remember\n\nYou are on my mind again\n\nWith poetry and rhyme\n\nIt's as if you′re still here with me\n\nAfter all this time\n\n'Cause I′d give the world to be home tonight\n\nBut the road is long and it pulls me away\n\nI miss you deep, and there's no relieve from this steady ache\n\nNameless places, it never seems to end\n\nNameless faces, when all I want is you\n\nWriter(s): Sandra Mccracken<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
