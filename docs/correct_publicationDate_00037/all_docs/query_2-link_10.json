        "text": "The Nameless Places\n\nby Richard Lambert\n\nA hotel with mysterious guests, a city where the moon wanders, an abandoned seaside pavilion, are some of the places visited in this, Richard Lambert's second collection. Structured around a movement from city to sea and always alert to the emotional resonance of landscape, The Nameless Places dwells on those spaces that lie at the edge of our lives and vision, and that seem somewhere between reality and dream. The collection culminates in a sequence that follows a journey made along the course of a river from its source to its mouth. Here, an English landscape's margins are investigated â suburb, waste ground, marsh, and estuary beach. In poems that are formally various (rondeau, villanelle and sonnet) and conjuring an atmosphere of melancholy, The Nameless Places explores forgotten and neglected spaces â both of the mind and of our physical world.\n\nISBN pbk 978-1911469-00-1\n\nISBN hbk 978-1911469-01-8\n\nISBN ebk 978-1911469-02-5\n\n64 pages\n\nPublished July 2017"
