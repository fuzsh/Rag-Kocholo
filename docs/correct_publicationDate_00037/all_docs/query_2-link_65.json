        "text": "Hi all, exciting news! Iâ€™m offering a limited amount of original comic book art for sale through my art dealer Cadence Comic Art. There are pages (and covers!) from my original work like Pumpkinheads, The Nameless City and Friends with Boys as well as artwork from licensed jobs like Avatar the Last Airbender, Attack on Titan and Archie comics (really!). If youâ€™ve ever wanted to own original artwork from me, nowâ€™s the time to grab something. Follow the link here to see what is available for sale. This the first time Iâ€™ve offered pages from my creator-owned work for sale, as I tend to be more attached to those, so I hope they find good homes!\n\nAlso, there is a giveaway for my upcoming Young Adult graphic novel Hockey Girl Loves Drama Boy happening on Goodreads this month, so check that out here. May the odds be ever in your favour. ðŸ˜‰\n\nHi everyone! The Divided Earth, the third and final book in the Nameless City trilogy will be out in bookstores very soon! Iâ€™m so excited for people to read it! I really hope you like the conclusion of Rat and Kaiâ€™s story, which Iâ€™ve worked so hard on. Three years of my life spent on this trilogy! I have a few upcoming events to promote the publication of The Divided Earth; if youâ€™re in the area, I hope youâ€™ll come by to say hi and pick up a book. If youâ€™re not able to come to one of my public events, The Divided Earth can be found where most books are sold: at your local bookstore, your local comic store, Amazon, B&N or Indigo.\n\nEVENTS:\n\nSaturday, September 22nd\n\nAt Lethbridge Public Library, Lethbridge, Alberta\n\nWord on the Street Lethbridge\n\nI have a panel from 1-1:45PM, and Iâ€™ll be signing from 2-2:45PM\n\nPanel info/Signing info\n\nTuesday, September 25th\n\nThird Place Books, Seattle, WA\n\n7PM/Event info here\n\nThursday, September 27th\n\nEagle Harbor Book Company, Bainbridge Island, WA\n\n5PM-6PM/Event info here\n\nSaturday, September 29th\n\nLinden Tree Bookstore, Los Altos, CA\n\n11AM/Event info here\n\nTuesday, October 2nd\n\nKidsbooks, Vancouver, British Columbia\n\n7PM/Event info here\n\nAlso, in late October I will be a guest of Lucca Comics & Games, in Lucca, Italy! I donâ€™t yet know my schedule, but Iâ€™m really excited for this trip. Never been to Italy before! Iâ€™ll post more about it closer to the date.\n\nIf you enjoyed The Divided Earth, please consider leaving a review on Amazon or Goodreads. Word of mouth is one of the best ways to support a book you like!\n\nLook at this!! All three Nameless City books in one place! Itâ€™s only a few months until the publication of the conclusion of The Nameless City trilogy! Book 3, The Divided Earth will be out on September 25. Iâ€™ll be doing a few events to promote itâ€™s publication, but until then, you can pre-order the book using this helpful publisher website, which has links to all the major bookstores that will be carrying The Divided Earth. I usually recommend supporting your local bookstore or comic store if you have one, but if not, Barnes & Noble, Amazon and other chains will do just fine. Thereâ€™s also Indigo for the Canadians. ðŸ™‚\n\nOtherwise, you can keep up with my various comic-related posts on Instagram.\n\nHi guys. While going through the messages in my contact form, I noticed two questions popping up frequently. Iâ€™m going to answer them here instead of replying to each individual question.\n\nWhen will The Nameless City 3 be published? The title of the third Nameless City book is The Divided Earth and it will be published by First Second books on September 25th, 2018! Iâ€™m thrilled that readers are excited about the series, and are anxious to read the third book. And to answer another question: The Divided Earth marks the end of this trilogy and the conclusion of Kai and Ratâ€™s story. The series was always planned as a trilogy that would finish with book 3, so there are no further books planned.\n\nI canâ€™t access your old webcomic Demonology 101. Will you be putting it back online? Demonology 101 is 18 years old at this point. I started drawing it in 1999 when I was a teenager. It used to be hosted on another website, but now that host, who very generously provided space for this comic for years without charging me money, has decided to take that site down. So, D101 has passed on into the internet either. As of now, I have no plans to bring it back. I feel like 18 years is long enough for a webcomic to exist on the internet, and Iâ€™ve received many wonderful comments from people who have enjoyed reading it. And â€¦ well, I feel like itâ€™s just time to let it go. <:)\n\nAnd now my big announcement! I have been hired by Dark Horse Comics to continue writing the Avatar: The Last Airbender comic book series! Hereâ€™s the press release. Iâ€™m going to be taking the reins over from Gene Yang, who is a fantastic writer and a friend, and continuing the adventures of Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph and the rest of the Avatar crew. The books will be drawn by an artist Iâ€™m a big fan of, Peter Wartman. Not yet sure when the first book (weâ€™re initially doing 3 volumes) will be published. Iâ€™ll announce that when I have more info.\n\nThe second announcement is the next graphic novel that Iâ€™ll be drawing: Iâ€™m drawing a comic called Pumpkinheads, written by the amazing author Rainbow Rowell (Eleanor & Park, Fangirl). Iâ€™m a huge fan of Rainbowâ€™s work, and getting the chance to work with her is a dream come true. Currently Pumpkinheads is slated for publication in 2019, and you can read the press release about it here.\n\nAnd thatâ€™s it! Thanks everyone. ðŸ™‚\n\nHi guys, I have two upcoming Canadian conventions where I will be exhibiting, along with my boyfriend Tim. At the Toronto Comic Arts Festival (TCAF), you can find me on the second level at table #200. Click here for the TCAF map. Iâ€™ll have copies of my most recent books (The Stone Heart, The Nameless City, Superhero Girl, Friends with Boys, etc) for sale and Iâ€™m happy to sign any books you bring yourself. Tim will also have copies of the self published edition of his webcomic Mush A Mush for sale.\n\nIâ€™ll be on one panel at TCAF at St. Paulâ€™s on Bloor Street. Panel info:\n\n1:00 PM â€“ Adventure Awaits! â€“ Four authors talk about the adventures that occur inside comics â€” how do you create a plot full of adventures and characters that are ready for adventures? How do you write and draw the fun and excitement of adventures into the page? Adventures await you in this panel discussion. A conversation between Scott Chantler, Faith Erin Hicks, Sara Goetter, and Molly Ostertag; moderated by Alison Wilgus.\n\nAt the Vancouver Comic Arts Festival (VanCAF) Iâ€™ll be at table N3 in the Gym. Hereâ€™s the map. Like TCAF, Iâ€™ll have copies of most of my books for sale, and Iâ€™m happy to sign any additional books you might bring. I also did a VanCAF poster! Iâ€™m happy to sign that as well.\n\nIâ€™m on one panel:\n\nThe Terrifying World of Kids Comics\n\nSaturday at 10:30 â€“ 11:15 AM in the Performance Centre\n\nKids comics are a big deal in the comics business these days. But what do you need to watch out for when youâ€™re creating comics for kids? When it comes to violence, drugs and alcohol, scariness, and mature themes, how much is too much? Whatâ€™s acceptable/unacceptable to publishers, to parents, and to the kids themselves? Laser Moose and Rabbit Boy creator Doug Savage hosts Strangebeardâ€™s Kelly Tindall, Katie Shanahan (Silly Kingdom), Kean Soo (March Grand Prix), Faith Erin Hicks (The Nameless City), and Mike Lawrence (Star Scouts)\n\nPanelists: Doug Savage, Kelly Tindall, Katie Shanahan, Kean Soo, Faith Erin Hicks, Mike Lawrence\n\nSee you there!\n\nThe Stone Heart (The Nameless City book 2) will be published on April 4th, and Iâ€™ll be on tour to promote it! You can find me at these events through April and May. Some details will be updated later, so check back here for further info. For the Stone Heart tour, Iâ€™ll be talking and signing with a number of fantastic cartoonists and writers. Very grateful all these wonderful creators have taken time out of their busy schedules to talk to me about comics, writing, and other awesome things. Hope to see you at these events!\n\nTuesday, April 4th\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nElliott Bay Books with G.Willow Wilson\n\n7:00PM\n\n1521 10th Ave, Seattle, WA\n\nWednesday, April 5th\n\nSan Francisco, CA\n\nBooks Inc with Raina Telgemeier\n\n7:00PM\n\nSanta Clara City Library, Central Park Location, 2635 Homestead Road, Santa Clara,\n\nThursday, April 6th\n\nPortland, OR\n\nA Childrenâ€™s Place with Victoria Jamieson\n\n4:00PM\n\n1423 NE Fremont St, Portland, OR\n\nFriday, April 7th\n\nSalt Lake City, UT\n\nKingâ€™s English with Shannon Hale\n\n7:00PM\n\n1511 South 1500 East, Salt Lake City, UT\n\nSaturday, April 8th\n\nOmaha, NE\n\nLegend Comics with Rainbow Rowell\n\n5:00-7:00PM\n\n5207 Leavenworth Street, Omaha, NE\n\nSunday, April 9th\n\nBrooklyn, NYSy\n\nCommunity Bookstore with Marie Rutkoski\n\n6:00PM\n\n143 7th Avenue, Brooklyn NY\n\nMonday, April 10th\n\nSyracuse, NY\n\nB&N Syracuse with Tamora Pierce\n\n7:00PM\n\n3454 Erie Boulevard East, Dewitt, NY\n\nThursday, April 13th\n\nVancouver, BC\n\nChapters Metrotown with Elieen Cook\n\n7:00PM\n\nMetrotown Eaton Centre, 4700 Kingsway #1174, Burnaby, BC\n\nUPCOMING CONVENTIONS/BOOK FESTIVALS (details to follow):\n\nApril 22nd-23rd\n\nLA Times Festival of Books\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nMay 13th-14th\n\nToronto Comic Arts Festival (Exhibitor)\n\nToronto, ON\n\nMay 2o-21st\n\nVancouver Comic Arts Festival (Exhibitor)\n\nVancouver, BC\n\nIâ€™ll be at 3 comic conventions/book festivals over the next couple weeks, and then thatâ€™s it for me until next year!
