Centered around Hell’s Muse, the saga follows a strange collection of humans, demons, and angels as they attempt to bring together or prevent a war between Heaven and Hell.\n\nThis series came to light from a short story I wrote in graduate school that became a very person tale of one young man’s realization of his truest, highest, purpose. Eventually, that story will wind its way into the fabric of this series.\n\nTo date, there are only two books in the series, but I have plenty more planned!"
