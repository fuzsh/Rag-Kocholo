        "text": "Chauncey Mabe permalink*\n\nOh, dear. I seem to have upset Mr. Duns, who is very angry with me. Understandable. He has been publicly duped by a clever fraud, an experience that cannot be fun. If he feels better venting his anguish on me, I have no objection.\n\nA few points. I have gone out of my way, in both my blog entries and “the private messages” Mr. Duns so graciously shares here, to praise the dignity of the way he has handled this difficult situation. His response is such that I am now wiping spittle from my face. Sigh.\n\nWhen I used the word “copying” in connection with the spy thriller genre, as I explained to Mr. Duns, I meant “imitating.” The first definition for the word “copy” (as a noun) at Dictionary.com is “imitation.” The third definition of copy (as a veb) is “to follow a pattern or model; imitate.”\n\nIn our private exchange Mr. Duns mocked my resorting to an Internet dictionary, but the text of the entry is very similar to that of the venerable American Heritage over there on my dictionary stand. Dictionary.com includes etymologies, which is my gold-plate standard for a worthwhile dictionary.\n\nBut for those with an enfeebled grasp of the English language, let me state clearly. I did not mean to say that spy novelists are running around plagiarizing one another willy-nilly. I meant that the majority of them seem to be “following a pattern” established by successful writers who have preceded them. They are not copying the way a cheater copies someone’s test paper, they are copying the way a young slugger seeks to imitate Albert Pujols’s swing.\n\nI am confident that meaning is clear from the context of my blog posts, but if not, then here you are, the matter explained to the point of tedium.\n\nI also take pains, in my blogs, to offer a few examples of spy thrillers from my admittedly sparse reading of the genre that seem to me to avoid excessive derivativeness. Therefore I do not condemn the genre wholesale.\n\nAs for seeking to equate the Assassins of Secrets scandal with the publication of plagiarized Rowan work in the Paris Review or BOMB, I don’t think so. By definition a spy novelist, editor, or critic is a specialist. A specialist, by definition, possesses specialized knowledge.\n\nHow could a spy novelist, editor or critic be unfamiliar with the likes of Charles McCarry or John Gardner? These are no obscure writers, but leaders of the genre.That’s like a literary critic, writer, or editor having not read Mailer or Updike or Oates.\n\nWhat really stands out about the Assassins scandal, however, is not that the experts failed to detect the source texts, but that they failed to detect the transition from one plagiarized passage to the next. This, more than anything, is what suggests to me that spy thrillers have entered a degenerate phase where most of the writing is so similar it cannot be easily identified. The same could be said for the “bestsellerse” of the 1970s, when I was coming of age, when Arthur Hailey, Irving Wallace, Sydney Sheldon, and any number of other writers churned out bestsellers that sounded all exactly alike.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned earlier, and this is probably my last word on this matter, the Assassins affair has other implications. David Shields, anyone? Not one person attacking me has even mentioned the David Shields aspect. And finally, there is something in the human breast that loves a good hoax or fraud, no matter how evil its consequences. Will we ever get enough of Bernie Madoff? You cannot change human nature, I’m afraid.\n\nSo, no, Mr. Duns, you will not get an apology from me, nor an admission that I’m a larval stage of some inferior life form. For one thing, I am not the one who has harmed you, and for another, my blogs and comments are in the public realm for others to agree or disagree with. You seem to want to control my reaction, which is neither possible nor appropriate.\n\nChin up! Except for the diatribes shrilled in my direction, you have handled yourself well. This whole thing is a pebble in the water. Your genre is as popular as ever and this brief scandal, however entertaining, will not alienate a single reader. If I may offer a suggestion, take all this energy and effort and apply it to your next novel, Mr. Duns. The sooner you put this behind you, the sooner it will stop mattering quite so much, and the sooner you can regain your equanimity.\n\nIn spite of your discourtesies, Mr. Duns, I wish you no ill will. Live long and prosper.\n\nPS. Oh, and to Mr. Dixon: I do not wish to “convincingly establish” anything. I am merely making observations and pointing out some implications. I must say, except for the small matter of character assassination, I’m gratified by the discussion that has come about. Unlike Mr. Duns, I do not get peeved with others disagree with my interpretation of things.\n\nI am not seeking to control your reaction – I am merely responding to it.\n\nYou chose to initiate the argument with me via private message on Twitter, not me.\n\nCharles McCarry has written 12 spy novels. Raymond Benson wrote 9 Bond novels. John Gardner wrote 16 Bond novels, as well over 20 other spy novels. Robert Ludlum also wrote around 20 spy thrillers.\n\nI’ve read hundreds of spy novels, and write spy novels for a living. I happened to have read two McCarry novels that were plagiarized, three of the Gardners, one of the Bensons, one of the Ludlums, all many years earlier. I’d never even heard of Geoffrey O’Brien. If one were to read all the ‘leaders of the genre’ you would be looking at the collected works of, at the very least:\n\nEric Ambler (18 novels)\n\nJohn le Carré (22 novels)\n\nLen Deighton (25 novels)\n\nIan Fleming (12 novels)\n\nAdam Hall (19 novels)\n\nAlan Furst (14 novels)\n\nCharles McCarry (12 novels)\n\nJohn Gardner (36 novels)\n\nBut let’s also add Edward Aarons, Jeff Abbott, Ted Allbeury, Evelyn Anthony, Campbell Armstrong, Philip Atlee, Desmond Bagley, David Baldacci, Jean Bruce, John Buchan, William F. Buckley, Victor Canning, Erskine Childers, Tom Clancy, Jon Cleary, Richard Condon, Stephen Coonts, Martin Cruz Smith, Charles Cumming, Clive Cussler, Lionel Davidson, Nelson De Mille, Adam Diment, Daniel Easterman, Clive Egleton, Barry Eisler, Sean Flannery/ David Hagberg, Joseph Finder, Ken Follett, Bryan Forbes, Colin Forbes, Frederick Forsyth, Bill Granger, Graham Greene, Jan Guillou, William Haggard, Donald Hamilton, Robert Harris, Michael Hartland, Jack Higgins, Joseph Hone, Geoffrey Household, E Howard Hunt, Stephen Hunter, Noel Hynd, Hammond Innes, Geoffrey Jenkins, Joseph Kanon, Philip Kerr, Robert Littell, Eric Van Lustbader, Gavin Lyall, Gayle Lynds, Helen MacInnes, Alistair Maclean, Derek Marlowe, John R. Maxim, James Mayo, JK Mayo, James Mitchell/James Munro, David Morrell, Peter O’Donnell, Anthony Price, Christopher Reich, Julian Semyonov, Gerald Seymour, Daniel Silva, Craig Thomas, Ross Thomas, John Trenhaile, Trevanian, Dennis Wheatley and Alan Williams.\n\nThat would be a fair grounding, I think. All editors at major publishing houses who receive submissions of spy novels should, at least, have read all of these, I think. They’ll be 102, but hey, they might meet your approval. And if they’re editors of crime fiction, too? Oh, well… let’s see…\n\nThousands of spy novels have been published in the last half-century alone. Quentin Rowan plagiarized aabout a dozen, many out of print and long-forgotten. McCarry is critically acclaimed, but Second Sight is not regarded as a classic of the genre in the way Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is, and it makes up a large portion of this book.\n\nI think it might be reasonable for publishers now to start running random passages of all their submissions through plagiarism-detection software as a matter of routine, but I don’t think Rowan’s plagiarism of ‘leaders of the genre’ reflects poorly at all on the dozen or so people who missed this before it reached wider eyes, when a Bond fan who remembered Licence Renewed (a best-seller, yes, but in 1981, and largely forgotten now) spotted a verbatim passage. I’ve read Licence Renewed and didn’t spot it – outrage! Or just not as good a memory as one diehard Bond fan.\n\nI don’t think it is at all reasonable to blame editors for not being familiar enough with the genre in this case, because even if you had read all the spy novels in existence, you would have to *remember* them, too, in order to recognize sentences taken out of context from a handful. I think you have extrapolated from this episode something that simply is not there – perhaps to be contrary? Perhaps to garner traffic from your blog? I don’t know, but however you parse your wording, your argument is hollow and insulting. In 1980, Little, Brown published WIld Oats by Jacob Epstein, which was later found to have been largely plagiarized from The Rachel Papers by Martin Amis. This did not mean that literary fiction was so generic that it was unable to be spotted – simply that there are millions of books one can plagiarize, and it just so happens that the editors didn’t. Richard Condon plagiarized I, Claudius in The Manchurian Candidate, and it was not spotted by hundreds of thousands of readers for decades. Quentin Rowan plagiarized Nicholas Mosley in 2003, and Graham Greene in 2002, the latter in the Paris Review. And yet you don’t seem to think ‘something stinks’ in the literary fiction game.\n\nYou appear offended that I called out your absurd and insulting argument and exposed you for the poseur you are. So be it. But yes, your argument is here for all to see, as is my rebuttal, and I think it’s clear yours totally misses the target.\n\nNobody is to blame for Quentin Rowan’s plagiarism apart from Quentin Rowan.\n\nChauncey Mabe permalink*\n\nBy now I have congratulated you, Mr. Duns, multiple times on your dignity in this mess, but I am afraid that dignity has begun to fray. Your childish sense of hurt is leading you badly astray and your are making a graceless fool of yourself. Let it go, I implore you.\n\nI must say, though, that I can hardly believe you are actually arguing that it is too much trouble, as spy novelist, for you to keep up with the major texts in your own genre. That takes my breath away. Imagine, if doctors, or philosophers, or engineers, or English professors felt that way. “Oh, I love being a physician, but I can’t be bothered to read all those pesky medical journals.” I cannot imagine a more risible position for anyone in any field.\n\nI mean, we’re not talking about, say, English poetry since Chaucer. Edmund Skellings, the poet laureate of Florida, once told me that any serious poet must read and know by heart English poetry since the 14th century. And when he said by heart, he meant it. In the three years I knew him well, I never stumped him with a poem. He recited each and every one off the top of his head. Occasionally he stumbled, but then he was in his mid-70s.\n\nAnd yet you can’t be bothered to read the important books published in the spy genre–most of which are meant to be undemanding entertainments? You would be well advised to keep that to yourself.\n\nNow that I know it, I find it impossible to take you seriously.\n\nOh, and I see now that nothing you say can be trusted. You accuse me of initiating this argument on Twitter. Here is the entire text of my first Twitter message to you, congenial in tone I think everyone will agree:\n\ncmabe55\n\nThanks for the follow, happy to reciprocate. Maybe I had overmuch fun with the Assassins story, but I admire the way you handled yourself.\n\n23 hours ago.\n\nAnd here are your next two messages back to me, the first one friendly:\n\njeremyduns\n\nAppreciated. I’m just anxious not to play into this little sleazbeall’s hands by giving him some kind of kudos he might enjoy.\n\n23 hours ago\n\njeremyduns\n\nAnd, having read your blog again, my blood boiled. I think it’s pretty insulting to suggest his victims are to blame. Read my blog, please.\n\n22 hours ago.\n\nTen messages later, after you’ve accused me of “gibberish” and “BS,” I’m still writing:\n\ncmabe55\n\nYour blog is nicely done. You continue to wreath yourself in dignity. But you cannot control the reaction and interpretation of others.\n\n6 hours ago\n\nYour response, in your next two messages, is to revile me for “weasling” and “bullshit.”\n\nThe texts of these Twitter messages make it explicitly clear which of us cast the first stone, and your assertion that I started this argument is either delusional or an outright lie.\n\nWhat conclusion are we to draw regarding a person who resorts to misrepresenting an exchange for which there is an easily accessed written record? Not a good one, I’m afraid.\n\nGoodbye, Mr. Duns. I don’t know about you, but I have better things to do.\n\n‘By now I have congratulated you, Mr. Duns, multiple times on your dignity in this mess, but I am afraid that dignity has begun to fray. Your childish sense of hurt is leading you badly astray and your are making a graceless fool of yourself.’\n\nYou seem to be forgetting the part where you wrote ‘This failure — Little, Brown published the book, critics praised it, authors blurbed it — suggests strongly that spy novelists are not merely observing convention when they write. They are copying the work of other writers whose work has proven successful.’ I blurbed the book, and am a spy novelist, and the idea that I am ‘not merely observing convention’ in my own novels, but copying – or imitating – that of others who are more successful because I failed to spot this plagiarism earlier is insulting.\n\n‘I must say, though, that I can hardly believe you are actually arguing that it is too much trouble, as spy novelist, for you to keep up with the major texts in your own genre. That takes my breath away. Imagine, if doctors, or philosophers, or engineers, or English professors felt that way. “Oh, I love being a physician, but I can’t be bothered to read all those pesky medical journals.” I cannot imagine a more risible position for anyone in any field.’\n\nNot if you’d read my comment above, where I point out just how wide the field is. It’s easy to say once someone has plagiarized Charles McCarry and John Gardner that *they* are ‘leaders of the genre’ and that anyone involved in editing or writing spy fiction should have, at minimum, read every one of their works – but it’s rather convenient. The truth is neither are leaders of the genre (and James Bamford and Geoffrey O’Brien aren’t even in the genre). Charles McCarry is a critically acclaimed spy novelist, true, but many of his works are obscure, and I don’t think there is any professional shame in my not having read all his novels. John Gardner is not widely seen as a leading proponent of the genre either, or at least not in the ‘premier league’, which I would say is probably le Carre, Deighton, Fleming, Buchan, Ambler, Greene, and perhaps a few others – to read the top ten leaders of the genre would run to several hundred books. John Gardner probably isn’t in that top ten, by most reckonings. He wrote some acclaimed but mostly forgotten serious spy novels, of which I have read a couple about 10 years ago; the Boysie Oakes series, of which I’ve read several, again years ago (I do not make a list of all the spy fiction I have read); and he wrote several post-Fleming Bond novels, of which I have read a few several years ago, which were widely read but are not highly acclaimed (and which were the ones Quentin Rowan stole from). I would guess that if you found someone who had read every novel by Charles McCarry and John Gardner, you’d probably be looking at one of the world’s most serious spy buffs. As I indicated above, there have been many thousands of spy novels published in the last half-century, and to suggest editors and novelists should have read them all is absurd. I think even reading the ‘acknowledged major texts’, would involve having read several hundred books, and possibly more.\n\n‘Experts in other fields apply themselves and routinely manage that kind of reading load.’\n\nI don’t think they do, really. My editor in the US, for example, does not just edit spy fiction. She also edits crime novels, non-fiction and literary fiction. I would say that to edit crime fiction you probably should have read a lot of crime novels, and to edit spy fiction a lot of spy novels. But even if you’d read tons of them, it would still be a fraction of the canon. All of Sherlock Holmes would be a prerequisite, no? But someone might plagiarize John Gardner’s Moriarty. Well, all Holmes spin-offs, then. Oh, I’m already dead and have yet to start on Agatha Christie. It would take a lifetime. I read almost every novel by Dennis Wheatley a while back – 70 or so – and that took me well over a year. And he is almost totally forgotten these days, but sold millions of books in his day, and was also a massive (and largely unspotted) influence on Ian Fleming.\n\nYour idea that novelists and editors should have read so widely also contradict your earlier point. Up until 2007, I read tons of spy thrillers. My flat is groaning with them. Then I started to write my own. Precisely to avoid what you complain of, ie derivation or imitation of others, I stopped reading them. I still read them occasionally, such as my Wheatley jag, but Assassin of Secrets was a relative rarity for me. I think I know enough about spy fiction’s history and how it works to write my own novels, but I no longer want to read too many books in the genre because I suspect the ideas in them may subconsciously rub off on me. It is also the case that when I read another spy novel, I start worrying that my own stuff is too similar, even if it isn’t, and I find it distracting and disrupting to my own creative juices. But if I stay generally clear of it, I know my own work is original, as it comes solely from me struggling to come up with something new. I know several writers who are the same. I don’t think there’s anything wrong in this at all.\n\n‘You accuse me of initiating this argument on Twitter. Here is the entire text of my first Twitter message to you, congenial in tone I think everyone will agree:\n\ncmabe55\n\nThanks for the follow, happy to reciprocate. Maybe I had overmuch fun with the Assassins story, but I admire the way you handled yourself…’\n\nYes, but you don’t mention that you sent me that by private message, after I had followed you and asked you directly and in public:\n\n‘@cmabe55 If ‘damning to the entire genre’ and spy novelists are simply ‘copying’ (!), how do you explain his Paris Review story in 2002?’\n\nYou chose not to answer me publicly via Twitter, but sent me that private message instead. You also didn’t alter your blog post here, in which you had had your self-confessed overmuch fun. When you still failed to respond to to my public question about the Paris Review – and you have still failed to respond to that now! – either on Twitter or here on this blog, it annoyed me. And reading this blog post again, I became more annoyed and informed you via private message of that. I did it via private message because you had not replied to me publicly but done so privately, so I thought it would be more courteous that way than, after receiving your private but seemingly somewhat conciliatory message, to launch at you in public again. So I told you privately it annoyed me privately and said ‘Read my blog, please’. You replied to me a fgew more times, but it was clear from what you were writing that you hadn’t read my latest blog post, and it occurred to me that you were only replying to me in private messages so that your Twitter feed and your blog didn’t show how hollow your argument was. I called you on that in provate, and I also called you on it here. I also asked you not to pretend that your accusation of ‘copying’ meant something other than it did. But you did that anyway…\n\nBut yes, I am investing too much time in this. I suppose I’m hoping some more sensible souls will see through your rather grandiose nonsense, and I hate to see it sit there unchallenged.\n\nFinally, on the inadvisability of easily accessed written records, here is something you posted to your Facebook wall to link to your previous spurious post on this:\n\n‘A brilliant act of literary sabotage reveals spy thrillers to be narrative canned corn.’\n\nI think this shows what your argument really is, stripped of all its pretension. Your admiration for Rowan’s ‘brilliance’ and extrapolation that this reveals anything about the genre – you still haven’t addressed the Paris Review or BOMB – is, frankly, adolescent. It reminds me of Charles Highway, the protagonist of The Rachel Papers. To find out what I mean by that, you’ll have to read my latest blog entry, where I have in fact already countered every pompous point you’ve made here, but which you quite obviously still haven’t read.\n\nSorry to have lost my rag a little, as well as my command of spelling, but claiming that I copy others’ work because someone else is a plagiarist, and that ‘Something stinks in spy thriller game’ for the same reason, and in all in this rather grand hail-fellow-well-met-cum-authoritative tone, sticks in my craw."
