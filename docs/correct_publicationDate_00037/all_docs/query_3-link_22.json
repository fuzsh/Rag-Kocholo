GRADY.\n\nL ITERATURE in all countries has preceded journalism, and the colonists of Georgia produced a crude literature before they had a newspaper of their own. The sturdy pioneers who came over with Oglethorpe were few in number, and during the first generation they were engaged in solving the more serious problem of existence. With a small and scattered population, a few fortified villages, and a hostile environment, there was no field and no demand for newspapers. But it was an era of great literary activity, and the founder of the colony was a favorite figure in a circle composed of Johnson, Goldsmith, Burke, Wharton, Burton, Mrs. Garrick, Mrs. More and others. He was pronounced by Burke the most extraordinary man of his day, and the frequent references made to him in Boswell's Life of Johnson make it evident that some of the most famous men of letters in England regarded him as their peer. Pope, Thomson, and other poets sung his praises, arid grave theologians paid him high tribute. It is ir-2\n\nl8\n\nMEMOIRS OF GEORGIA.\n\nprobable that Ogletliorpe and a few of the more prosperous colonists brought with them small libraries, but there was little opportunity for literary culture while the newcomers were negotiating treaties with savage tribes, felling forests, building cabins, and defending their homes against the Spaniards. The writings of the founder and the trustees contain only the merest outline of the history of the early settlers and cannot be regarded as literature.\n\nJOHX WESLEY.\n\nDuring the first two years of its existence the colony received from England over 2.600 Bibles. Testaments and religious books in addition to about 1,000 vol umes of the same class which came over with the first ship load of emigrants. It is not strange, therefore, that the first literature of the colony was of a religious character, and it is not too much to say that the Rev. John Wesley was the first writer of any fame in the community. His sermons, journal and pamphlets made a deep and lasting impression on the public mind in this country and in England. In 1736 a parish library was started in Savannah. Books were donated in England, and the trustees purchased a few volumes, ordering among others, Plato's works in Greek and Latin and his Republic in French. With preachers, pedagogues and soldiers controlling their affairs, it is not surprising that literature was at a low ebb in the colonies.\n\nGEN. OGLETHORPK.\n\nOgletliorpe wrote a sketch of the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia, but it was a plain and business-like document, without any graces of style to recom mend it. He left nothing behind him in the shape of printed matter or manuscript that would compare in interest and value with the book of travel written by one of his successors. Gov. Henry Ellis. There were governors and other officials and citizens who wrote vigorous political letters, addresses and appeals during the revolutionary era. but we look in vain among them for anything that is notevorthy enough for preservation on account of its literary merit. The colony pro duced no Junius. no Joel Barlow, no Jefferson, no Franklin and no historian. Its leaders were so busy making history that they had no time to write it.\n\nIn his New and Accurate Account of the Provinces of South Carolina and Georgia. Gen. Oglethorpe wrote: \"Let us in the meantime cast our eyes on the multitude of unfortunate people -in the kingdom, of reputable families, and of liberal or. at least, easy education; some undone by guardians, some by law suits, some by accidents in commerce, some by stocks and bubbles, and some by surety ship. But all agree in this one circumstance that they must either be burthensome to their relations or betake themselves to little ships for sustenance which ('tis 10 to i) do not answer their purposes, and to which a well educated mind descends with the utmost constraint. What various misfortunes may reduce the rich, the industrious, to the danger of a prison, to a moral certainty of starving! These are the people that may relieve themselves and strengthen Georgia by resorting thither, and Great Britain by their departure. I appeal to the recollection of the reader ftho? he be opulent, tho' he be noble) does not his own sphere of acquaint ance (I may venture to ask), does not even his own blood, his set of near rela tions furnish him with some instances of such persons as here described? Must they starve? What honest mind can bear to think of it? Must they be fed by the contributions of others? Certainly they must, rather than suffer to perish. Are these wealth to the nation? Are they not a burthen o themselves, a burthen to tlieir kindred and acquaintances, a burthen to the whole community?\n\nLITERATURE AND JOURNALISM.\n\nig\n\n\"I have heard it said (and 'tis easy to say so) let them learn to work; let them subdue their pride and descend to mean employments, keep ale houses, or coffee houses, even sell fruit, or clean shoes for an honest livelihood. But, alas I these occupations, and many more like them, are overstocked already by people who know better how to follow them than do they whom we have been talking of. Half of those who are bred in low life and well versed in such shifts and expedients, find but a very narrow maintenance by them. As for laboring, I could almost wish that the gentleman or merchant who thinks that another gentleman or mer\n\nchant in want can thresh or dig to the value of subsistence for his family or even for himself, I say I could wish the person who thinks so were obliged to make trial of it for a week,'or (not to be too severe) for only a day. He would find him self to be less than the fourth part of a laborer, and that the fourth part of a laborer's wages could not maintain him. I have heard it said that a man may learn to labor by practice; 'tis admitted. But it must also be admitted that before he can learn he may starve. Suppose a gentleman were this day to begin, and with grievous toil found himself able'to earn three pence, how many days or months are necessary to form him that he may deserve a shilling per diem? Men whose wants are important must try such experiments as will give immediate relief. 'Tis too late for them to begin to learn a trade when the}- have pressing necessities called\n\nfor the exercise of it. \"Having thus described (very too truly) the pitiable condition of the better\n\nsort of the indigent, an objection arises against their removal upon what is stated of their inability for drudgery. It may be asked if they can't get bread here for their labor, how will their condition be mended in Georgia? The answer is easy. Part of it is well attested, and part self evident. They have land there for nothing, and that land is so fertile that (as is said before) they receive an hundredfold increase for taking very little pains.\n\n\"Give here in England ten acres of good land to one of these helpless persons and I doubt not his ability to make it sustain him, and this by his own culture\n\nwithout letting it to another. But the difference between no rent and rack rent is the difference between eating and starving. If I make but 20 on the produce of a field, and am to pay 20 for it, 'tis plain I must perish if I have not another fund to support me. But if I pay no rent the produce of that field will supply the merest necessities of life.\n\n\"With a view to the relief of people in the condition I have described, his majesty has this present year incorporated a considerable number of persons of\n\nquality and distinction, and vested a large tract of South Carolina in them, by the name of Georgia, in trust to be distributed among the necessitous. These trustees not only give land to the unhappy who go thither, but are also impowered to receive the voluntary contributions of charitable persons to enable them to furnish the poor adventurers with all necessaries for the expense of the voyage, occupying the land, and supporting them until they find themselves comfortably settled.\n\nSo that now the unfortunate will not be obliged to bind themselves to a long servi tude to pay for their passage, for they may be carried gratis into a land of liberty j>nd plenty, where they immediately find themselves in possession of a competent\n\nestate, in a happier climate than they knew before, and they are unfortunate indeed if here they cannot forget their sorrows.\"\n\nBENJAMIN MARTYN.\n\nBenjamin Martyn, the secretary of the trustees, was a man of considerable liter ary reputation. He wrote a pamphlet on Georgia, in the early days of the colonies,\n\n2Q\n\nMEMOIRS OF GEORGIA.\n\nfrom which the following is an extract: \"As the Mind of Man cannot form a more exaulted Pleasure than what arises from the Reflexion of having relieved Ihe Distressed; let the Man of Benevolence, whose Substance enables him to con tribute towards this Undertaking give a Loose rein for a little to his Imag ination, pass over a few Years of his Life, and think himself on a Visit to Georgia. Let him see those who are now a Prey to all the Calamities of Want, who are starving with Hunger and seeing their Wives and Children in the same Distress; expecting likewise every Moment to be thrown into a Dungeon with the cutting Anguish that they leave their Families expos'd to the Utmost Ne cessity and Despair: Let him, I say, see these living under a sober and orderly Government, settled in Towns, which are rising at Distances along navigable Rivers: Flocks and Herds in the neighboring Pastures, and adjoining to them Plantations of regular Rows of Mulberry Trees entwin'd with Vines, the Branches of which are loaded with Grapes; let him see Orchards of Oranges, Pomegranates and Olives; in other Places, extended fields of Corn or Flax and Hemp. In short, the whole Face of the County chang'd by Agriculture and Plenty in Part of it. Let him see the People all in Employment of various Kinds, Women and Children feeding and nursing the Silk worm, winding off the Silk, or gather ing the Olives; the Men plowing and planting their Lands, tending their Cattle, or felling the Forest, which they bum for potashes, or square for the Builder: let him see these in Content and Affluence, and Masters of little Possessions which they can leave to their Children: and then let him think if they are not happier than those supported by Charity in Idleness. Let him reflect that the Produce of their Labour will be so much new Wealth for this Country, and then let him ask himself Whether he would exchange the Satisfaction of having contributed to this, for all the trifling, the Pleasures, the Money which he has given, would have purchased.\n\n\"Of all publick-spirited Actions, perhaps none can claim a Preference to the Settling of Colonies, as none are in the End more useful... .Whoever, then, is a Lover of Liberty will be pleas'd with an Attempt to recover his Fellow Subjects from a State of Misery and Oppression, and fix them in Happiness and Freedom.\n\n\"Whoever is a Lover of his Country will approve of a Method for the Employment of her Poor, and the Increase of her People and her Trade. Whoever is a lover of Mankind will join his wishes to the success of a design so plainly calculated for their Good: Undertaken and conducted with so much Disinter estedness.\n\n\"Few arguments are requisite to excite the Generous to exert themselves on this Occasion. To consult the Welfare of Mankind regardless of any private Views is the Perfection of Virtue: as the Accomplishing and Consciousness of it is the Perfection of Happiness.\"\n\nAUGUSTUS BALDWIN LONGSTREET.\n\nThe student of Georgia's literature will find nothing that will interest him until he reaches the present century. Indeed, the first Georgian whose writing attracted wide-spread attention was Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, who was born in Augusta in 1790. Longstreet was descended from a sturdy Dutch and Norman stock, and he was fortunate enough to enjoy the best educational advantages of his time. He graduated at Yale, studied law in Litchfield, Conn., and commenced the prac tice of his profession in Georgia in 1815. His genius was soon recognized, and he achieved fame as a lawyer, judge, writer, divine, and college president. While he was still a young man his fame filled the state. He had a lively sense of humor, and he was one of the first southern dialect writers. His descriptions of\n\nLITERATURE AND JOURNALISM.\n\n21\n\n\"cracker\" and country life in Georgia Scenes have amused three generations of Americans, and many editions of the book have been sold. Bishop O. P. Fitz gerald in his life of Judge Longstreet speaks of him always as \"the typical Geor gian.\" He says that \"he was a Georgian all over, all through, and all the time. He was the father of its humorists, and his humor was of a peculiar kind, unlike any other. He impressed his political opinions on the youth who were destined to shape the future policy of this state. He was one, and not the least, of a class\n\nof great teachers whose genius and piety have left upon its people an impress as lasting as eternity. He was an educator, who, bursting traditionary fetters, did\n\nmuch toward the emancipation of learning from its false methods and aims.\" A congressional reminiscence describes the happy effect produced by one of the Georgia Scenes many years after it was written. There had been a long and bitter sectional debate in the house, and when a measure full of material for passion and war resentments came up the democratic members agreed upon keeping quiet. A\n\nleading member of the republican Fide, representing a New England state, and\n\nnoted for his virulent attacks on the south, made a violent assault on the demo crats, charging them with cowardice, and in his excitement ran up and down the\n\naisles shaking his fists and challenging the democrats to come to the front and show their colors and stand up for what they maintained. Hon. S. S. Cox, of New York, asked permission to interrupt this speaker, who with emphasis replied, \"With great pleasure; I will be glad to hear from you.\" Mr. Cox sent to the\n\nclerk's desk a volume of Georgia Scenes, and the clerk read the following sketch: A Lincoln County Rehearsal.--If my memory fails me not, June 10,1809, found\n\nme at about 11 o'clock a. m. ascending a long and gentle slope in what was called the \"dark corner\" of Lincoln. I believed it took its name from the moral dark ness which reigned over that part of the county at the time of which I am speaking.\n\nIn this point of view, if it was but a shade darker than the rest of the county, it was inconceivably dark. If any man can name a trick or sin which had not been committed at the time of which I am speaking in the very focus of all the county's illumination (Lincolnton) he must himself be the most inventive of the tricky and the very Judas of sinners. Since that time, however (all humor aside),\n\nLincoln has become a living proof that \"light shineth in darkness.\" Could I venture to mingle the solemn with the ludicrous, even for the purposes of honorable\n\ncontact, I could adduce from -this county instances of the most numerous and\n\nwonderful transitions from vice and folly to virtue and holiness which have ever, perhaps, been witnessed since the days of the Apostolic ministry. So much, lest it should be thought by some that what I am about to relate is characteristic of the\n\ncounty in which it occurred. Whatever may be said of the moral condition of the \"dark corner\" at the time\n\njust mentioned, its natural condition was anything but dark; it smiled in all the charms of spring, and spring borrowed a new charm from its undulating grounds,\n\nits luxuriant woodlands, its sportive streams, its vocal birds, and its blushing flowers.\n\nRapt with the enchantment of the season and the scenery around me, I was\n\nslowly rising the slope when I was startled by loud, profane and boisterous voices which seemed to proceed from a thick covert of undergrowth about 200 yards in advance of me and about 100 to the right of the road.\n\n\"You kin, kin you?\" \"Yes, I kin, and am able to do it! Boo-oo-oo! O. wake snakes, and walk your chalks! Brimstone and ---- fire! Don't hold me, Nick Stovall! The fight's made up, and let's go at it. ---- my soul if I don't jump down his throat and gallop every chitterling out of him before you can say 'quit'!\"\n\n22\n\nMEMOIRS OF GEORGIA.\n\n\"Now, Nick, don't hold him! Jist let the wildcat come, and I'll tame him.\n\nXedll see me a fair fight, won't you, Xed?\" \"Oh, yes; I'll see you a fair fight, blast my old shoes if I don't\" \"That's sufficient, as Tom Haynes said when he saw the elephant; now let him\n\ncome.\" Thus they went on, with countless oaths interspersed which I dare not even\n\nhint at, and with much that I could not distinctly hear. \"In mercy's name,\" thought I, ''what band of ruffians has selected this holy\n\nseason and this heavenly retreat for such pandemonian riots? I quickened my gait, and had come nearly opposite the thick grove whence the noise proceeded when my eye caught indistinctly and at intervals through the foliage of the dwarf oaks and hickories which intervened glimpses of a man or men who seemed to be in a violent struggle, and I could occasionally catch those deep-drawn, emphatic oaths which men in conflict utter when they deal blows. I dismounted and hurried to the spot with all speed. I had overcome about half the space which separated it from me when I saw the combatants come to the ground, and after a short struggle I saw the uppermost one (for I could not see the other) make a heavy plunge with both his thumbs, and at the same instant I heard a cry in the accent of keenest torture: \"Enough! My eye's out!\"\n\nI was so completely horror-struck that I stood transfixed for a moment to the spot where the cry met me. The accomplices in the hellish deed which had been perpetrated had all fled at my approach; at least I supposed so, for they were not to be seen.\n\n\"Now, blast your corn-shucking soul,\" said the victor (a youth about eighteen years old; as he rose from the ground, \"come cutt'n' your shines Tx>ut me ag'in next time I come to the court-house, will you! Get your owl-eye in ag'in if you can!\"\n\nAt this moment he saw me for the first time. He looked excessively embar rassed, and was moving off when I called to him in a tone emboldened by the sacredness of my office and the iniquity of his crime, \"Come back, you brute, and assist me in relieving your fellow-mortal whom you have ruined forever.\"\n\nMy rudeness subdued his embarrassment in an instant, and with a taunting curl of the nose he replied: \"You needn't kick before you're spurr'd. There ain't nobody there, nor ha'n't been, nother. I was jist seein' how I could'a' fought\" So saying, he bounded to his plow, which stood in the corner of the fence about fifty- yards beyond the battle-ground.\n\nAnd. would you believe it, gentle reader, his report was true. All that I had heard and seen was nothing more or less than a Lincoln rehearsal, in which the youth who had just left me had played all the parts of all the characters in a court-house fight.\n\nI went to the ground from which he had risen, and there were the prints of his two thumbs, plunged up to the balls in the mellow earth, about the distance of a man's eyes apart, and the ground around was broken up as if two stags had been engaged upon it.\n\nThe laughter which accompanied and frequently interrupted and followed the reading of the sketch was joined by both sides of the house. The orator did not resume his remarks.\n\nJudge Longstreet also wrote Letters from Georgia to Massachusetts, Letters to Clergymen of the Northern Methodist Church, Master William Mitten, and many pamphlets and magazine articles. He was always busy with his pen, and manv of his contributions appeared in the newspapers, 'The Methodist Quarterly,\" \"The Southern Literary Messenger,\" \"The Southern Field and Fireside.\" \"The Magnolia.\" and \"The Orion.\"\n\nLITERATURE AND JOURNALISM.\n\n23\n\nGeorgia Scenes is probably the most widely known and popular of all of Judge Longstreet's writings. The author's aim in this was much higher than the object frequently ascribed to him, that of amusing the reader with humorous sketches, his desire being to \"supply a chasm in history which has always been overlooked --the manners, customs, amusements, wit, dialect, as they appear in all grades of society to an ear and eye witness of them.\" He chose the first fifty years of our republic in the course of which time the society of the southern states under went an almost entire revolution, and at this date hardly a trace of the society of the first thirty years of the republic is found. The author has not confined himself to historic detail, but his language is always \"Georgian\"' from the beginning to the end. As an illustration, The Gander Pulling is an actual occurrence at the place located. The characters were pen pictures of well-known individuals there and the language used their talk. Again, The Wax Works was an exhibition which actually came off in Waynesboro, Burke Co., and every figure actually existed and did the same parts assigned to him. The Fight also is a description of a combat to be seen in almost any county in Georgia. The character, however, answers better to many of the poor class seen in the sterile pine woods of Georgia. Judge Longstreet in the Matser Mitten was actuated by the laudable object of showing mothers the danger of allowing their affections for their children to interfere with their duty in using that paternal strictness which is absolutely necessary to the proper training of youth. This was suggested to the author when president of Centenary college in Louisiana by certain scholars whose mischievousness, encouraged by indulgent mothers, interfered with their studies. The scene was transferred to Georgia so as not to particularize the kind Jackson mothers and was well received by those who understood the aim of the author.\n\nJudge Longstreet's newspaper articles were generally on transient topics and his serious essays on subjects which, having lost interest, have not been preserved. Bishop Fitzgerald says of Judge Longstreet's writings on religious questions, that these fragments show \"a fondness and a genius for exegetics, with an independ\n\nence and originality of thought that give assurance that he could have done more work in that line that would have deserved to have survived him.'' It was Judge Longstreet's contemplation to write a series of Georgia scenes from a religious point of view. There are friends who question his success in this line, knowing his special vein to be humorous, but that his sketches on the line above indicated would have been filled with true pathos is to be believed by the moving touches found in the published Georgia Scenes.\n\nIn his old-age Judge Longstreet would gladly have withdrawn many of his humorous sketches from circulation, but the public continued to call for neweditions of his most popular book, and it is now to be found in almost every library in Georgia. This busy writer reached the patriarchial age of four score and died at his home in Oxford, Miss., in the summer of 1870.\n\nRICHARD HENRY WILDE.\n\nRichard Henry Wilde was an Irishman, a native of Dublin, but his early manhood was spent in Georgia. He was admitted to the bar in Augusta and served as attorney of the state, also as a representative in congress. While he was a very eloquent and successful lawyer, he is best known by one poem, \"My Life is Like the Summer Rose.\" When Byron read these verses he at once wrote to Wilde and congratulated him on being the author of one of the finest poems of the century. These immortal lines are worthy of a place in these pages :\n\n24\n\nMEMOIRS OF GEORGIA.\n\n\"My life is like the summer rose, That opens to the morning sky;\n\nBut ere the shades of evening close Is scattered on the ground to die.\n\n\"But on the rose's humble bed The sweetest dews of night are shed,\n\nAs if she wept such waste to see; But none shall weep a tear for me.\n\n\"My life is like the autumn leaf, That trembles in the moon's pale ray,\n\nIts hold is frail, its state is brief. Restless and soon to fade away.\n\n\"Yet ere that leaf shall fall and fade, The parent tree shall mourn its shade,\n\nThe winds bewail the leafless tree; But none shall breathe a sigh for me.\n\n\"My life is like the print which feet Have left on Tampa's desert strand;\n\nSoon as the rising tide shall beat All trace will vanish from the sand.\n\n\"Yet still as grieving to efface All vestige of the human race,\n\nOn that lone shore loud moans the sea; But i one, alas, shall mourn for me!\"\n\nMr. Wilde died in 1847 at the age of forty-eight in New Orleans, where he then resided, but in compliance with his request he was buried at his old home, Augusta.\n\nOCTAVIA WALTON LE VERT.\n\nMadame Octavia Walton Le Vert, a remarkably brilliant writer, was born near Augusta in 1810. Her father was the second son of George Walton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, a member of congress and governor of Geor gia. Octavia Walton was reared in Pensacola and Mobile. In the latter city, when she was a little girl, she met Gen. Lafayette, who was so delighted with her that he predicted for her a brilliant career. She was almost entirely educated by her mother and grandmother and a private tutor. At the age of twelve she spoke three languages with ease, and while in her teens she visited the leading cities in the union and was everywhere enthusiastically admired. In 1836 she married Dr. Henry Le Vert, of Mobile, a son of the first French surgeon who came over with Lafayette. In 1853 an^ ^55 she visited Europe, the first time at the Duke of Rutland's invitation, and shortly after her return she wrote Sou venirs of Travel, a work of graphic power and picturesque description, which was very popular in its days. She also translated Dumas' Three Musketeers. Lamartine was captivated by her conversational gifts and urged her to become a writer, saying she had the genius of a natural improvisatrice. Mme. Le Vert survived her husband, and after the war made her home in New York, where she died in 1877.\n\nFRAXCIS R. GOUL.DING.\n\nFrancis R. Goulding, the author of the Young Marooners, has almost as wide a fame as the author -of Robinson Crusoe. He was a native of Liberty county and his early boyhood was passed on the sea coast near Savannah. After\n\nLITERATURE AND JOURNALISM.\n\n25\n\ngraduating at the university of Georgia he attended the theological seminary at Columbia, S. C., and entered the ministry. In 1842, while living at Eatonton, Ga., he conceived the idea of the sewing machine, and simultaneously was the idea worked out by Howe and Thimmonier, of France, but to Goulding must be given the credit for the first sewing machine ever given to the south. Having satisfied himself as to its successful operation he laid the machine aside for \"weightier matters,\" and therefore no patent was applied for. He accepted a. pastoral call in 1843 to Bath, Ga., where he lived for eight years, doing much literary work in this time. Little Josephine, a story of the early piety of a Wash ington county girl, was published by the American Sunday School union. The Young Marooners, upon which his fame chiefly rests, was first called Robbins and Cruisers Company, afterward Robert and Harold, or the Young Marooners. He was three years in writing it, the book being read to his family as his work progressed and subjected to a revision at their suggestion. It-was published in 1852, three editions followed rapidly the first year, and it was reprinted in England and Scotland. In the summer of 1853 Mr. Goulding\"s wife died and he then opened a select school for boys at Kingston, Ga., devoting his leisure moments to notes on the Instincts of Birds and Beasts. He was married in 1855 to Matilda Rees, the daughter of Ebenezer Rees, of Darien, to which place he moved and resumed his pastoral duties, alternating for six years between Darien and Baisden's Bluff. What is Light? a treatise on the subject of light, followed years of corre spondence with Faraday and other scientists. When the civil war began Mr. Goulding was the friend and nurse of sick and suffering soldiers around Darien, and when the town was burned by the Federal forces his handsome home was burned and his library totally destroyed. He then went to Macon and there revived The Young Marooners and compiled a soldiers' hymn book for use in the Confederate army. The war ended and left him broken down in health and exhausted in resources, but with an energy characteristic of the man, he went to work with his pen, contributing to various literary journals and writing a sequel to The Young Marooners, which he called Marooners' Island. Frank Gordon followed, a story containing scenes from his childhood on the sea-coast. His final years were a struggle for life, being a sufferer from asthma, and in an early August morning he passed away at his little home in Roswell, and in the cemetery at that place lie his remains. At the time of his death, in 1891, he was in his\n\nninety-first year.\n\nMIRABEAU LAMAR.\n\nAmong the early writers of this century in Georgia Mirabeau Lamar deserves a prominent place. He was the first president of the republic of Texas, having\n\nemigrated there from Georgia, his native state, in 1835. He held many public positions and at the time of his death in 1859 was sixty-one years old. He was a brilliant orator, journalist and poet. A volume of his poetry was published in 1857, but he is perhaps best known as a writer by the following:\n\n\"O, lend to me, sweet nightingale. Your music by the fountains;\n\nAnd lend to me your cadences, O, river of the mountains.\n\n\"That I may sing my gay brunette, A diamond spark in coral set,\n\nGem for a princess' coronet-- The daughter of Mendoza.\n\n26\n\nMEMOIRS OF GEORGIA.\n\n\"How brilliant is the morning star,\n\nThe evening star how tender, The light of both is in her eye--\n\nTheir softness and their splendor.\n\n\"But for the lash that shades their sight, They were too dashing for the light,\n\nAnd, when she shuts them, all is night, The daughter of Mendoza.\n\n\"O, ever (night and beauteous one, Bewildering and beguiling,\n\nThe lute is in thy silvering tones, The rainbow is thy smiling.\n\n\"And thine is too, o'er hill and dell. The bounding of the young gazelle,\n\nThe arrow's flight acd ocean's swell, Sweet daughter of Mendoza.\n\n\"What though, perchance, we meet no more. What though, too, soon we sever;\n\nThy form will float like emerald light Before my vision ever.\n\n\"O who can see and then forget The glories of my gay brunette,\n\nThou art too bright a star to set, Fair daughter of Mendoza.\"\n\nPAUL HAMILTON HAYNE.\n\nPaul Hamilton Hayne, a South Carolinian, of distinguished revolutionary ancestry, spent the last years of his life at Copse Hill, in this state, where he died in 1886, at the age of fifty-six. His house at Copse Hill was a small, dusty looking affair, and but few could realize that it was the home of \"one of the most famous poets of the world--the friend and peer of Longfellow, Holmes and Whittier.\" The interior walls were covered with pictures from art journals and weeklies; the furniture was home-made, the poet's desk was a carpenter's bench, used in build ing the cottage; the book cases were made of boxes. The rough interior was skillfully transformed by the hands of the loving wife. Edward P. Whipple, the celebrated essayist, wrote of him in his review of Legends and Lyrics: \"It con tains the ripest result of the genius of the most eminent of living southern poets. Daphles, Cambyses and the Macrobian Bow, Fortunio, The Story of Glaucus the Thessalian, and especially The Wife of Brittany would, if published under the name of the author of The Earthly Paradise, obtain at once a recognition on both sides of the Atlantic. We cannot see that the American poet is one whit inferior to his English contemporary in tenderness and ideal charm, while we venture to say he has more than Morris the true poetic enthusiasm and unwithholding aban donment to the sentiment suggested by his themes. We congratulate the south on possessing such a poet\"\n\nWilliam Cullen Bryant and other equally well-known writers have cordially indorsed Whipple's estimate of Mr. Hayne. He was the author of several volumes of poetry, but the large volume of his complete poems published in Boston contains his best work.\n\nRICHARD MALCOLM JOHXSTOJJ.\n\nRichard Malcolm Johnston, who is still living in Baltimore, was born in Han cock county in 1822. He is one of the most original and gifted of all the southern\n\nLITERATURE AND JOURNALISM.\n\n27\n\nstory writers of his time, and the following is a complete list of his works up to date: \"\n\nDukesborough Tales, Old Mark Langston, Ogeechee Cross Firings, Mr. Absalom Billingslea, and other Georgia Folks, Two Gray Tourists, Widow\n\nGuthrie, The Primes and Their Neighbors, Studies, Literary and Social, Mr. Fortner's Marital Claims and other Stories, Mr. Billy Downs and His Like, History of English Literature (Assisted by Wm. Hand Browne), Biography of Alexander Hamilton Stephens, Pearce Amerson's Will.\n\n\"Dick\" Johnston attended for about four years an \"old field\" school and the \"Goose pond\" school; one of the stories in the Dukesborough Tales is a not exaggerated picture of one of these schools. After this his father moved to Crawfordsville and the Powelton to give his children better schooling; at the latter place Richard and his brother were prepared for college. Powelton is the Dukes borough of his tale. An incident of his school boy days--when at thirteen years\n\nof age he falls in love with his teacher--is used in the Early Majority of Mr. Thomas Watts. He entered Mercer college, where he was graduated in 1841. Teaching school for two years, he studied law, and when admitted to practice formed a partnership with Hon. Eli Baxter. He later was a partner of Hon. Jarvis Thomas, and lastly of Linton Stephens, a brother of Alexander H. Stephens. For ten years he practiced law in the middle and northern circuits of Georgia. The peculiarity of the people and scenes in the court-room supplied material frequently used in his various sketches. In 1844 Mr. Johnston married Miss Frances Mansfield, who lived in the same county, Hancock, but whose father was a native of Connecticut. He was twenty-three and she fifteen. It was during his practice of law that he was asked to become president of Mercer college, then to accept the nomination for judge of the superior court of the northern circuit, and finally to take the professorship of belles-lettres in the university of Georgia. The last being more congenial to his taste he accepted it. For four years he honored the university with his presence, and there he made many long time friends. It was in Athens he prepared his manuscript of a text book on English literature. He next conducted a large school for boys, called \"Rockby,\" at his home in Hancock county, but after the death of his second daughter, Lucy, in 1867, he moved his school to Baltimore, Md., where he was accompanied by forty of his sixty pupils. The new school was called \"Pen Lucy,\" and the corner stone was a high sense of truth and personal honor. Mr. Johnston, for the past ten or twelve years, has devoted his time to literary work entirely. His first story appeared in the \"Southern Magazine\" under the nom-de-plume of \"Philemon Perch,\" and its immediate success was a surprise to no one more than the author. His stories show a love of old Georgia associations, old places, old times and old friendships. The big heart and loving nature of the author is shown in every character he has drawn. His Pearce Amerson's Will published in \"Lippincott's Magazine\" in 1892 was founded on a romance, the character and scenes of which were laid in midway Georgia. He has his favorites in the children of his imagina tion, and Doolana Lines is his favorite among the female characters and Billy\n\nWilliams among the male.\n\nJOHN AND JOSEPH LE CONTE.\n\nJohn Le Conte was born in Liberty county in 1818 and died in California in 1891. He was the son of Lewis Le Conte, the noted French botanist who resided in New York in the past century. John was prepared by Alexander H. Stephens for college and graduated at the university of Georgia. He was distinguished at\n\n28\n\nMEMOIKS OF GEORGIA,\n\ncollege for his proficiency in mathematics, and at one time occupied the chair of natural philosophy and chemistry at his alma mater. At that time the study\n\nof medicine was the chief profession to be adopted by one of scientific mind, and so he took this degree in Xew York after a several years' course at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Xew York. For two years he practiced in Savannah, and then went to the university of Georgia. For nine years he remained there, resigning to take charge of the chair of chemistry in the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Xew York. Here he lectured for one winter, but physics rather than chemistry was his favorite study, and a year later he went to lecture on physics in the university of South Carolina, in Columbia. This chair he held until his final move to California in 1869. His scientific works extended throughout fifty years and his contributions will be found in the leading periodicals of Europe and America.\n\nJoseph Le Conte, his brother, was also born in Liberty county, in 1823; he graduated at the university of Georgia and then entered the Lawrence scientific school of Harvard. He studied natural science and geology under Louis Agassiz and accompanied him on an exploring expedition through Florida. He held chairs in Oglethorpe university, the state university, and finally in the university\n\nof California, where his elder brother had preceded him. He married, about 1847, Miss Bessie Nesbit of ililledgcville, a niece of Judge Eugenius A. Nesbit of Macon. The two brothers were never separated from the time Joseph left Oglethorpe for Athens, with the exception of one year when John preceded him to Columbia, till the death of the latter. While there was in some of their charac teristics a radical difference, the relationship between them was rarely beautiful and they lived in the closest intimacy and intellectual sympathy. John's talents were more restricted in his interests to pure science, and he literally lived in an atmosphere of scientifical culture. His love of music, art, poetry, literature was of the deepest kind and he possessed an ardent love of natural scenery. Joseph\n\nwas fond of the society of men of talent and humor, while John was rather reticent, preferring that privacy which is essential to continual and deep research. Xext to his devotion to persons and truths, the tetter's most marked trait of character was\n\nhis warm, genial, sunny disposition. Speaking of his brother, Joseph Le Conte recently said: \"Wherever clearness of thought and accuracy of statement on almost any scientific subject were required I instinctively turned to him as I would to an encyclopaedia.\" His wonderful memory, his methodical manner of\n\nreading and recording and his clearness of physical conceptions gave him a fullness as well as an accuracy of knowledge rarely obtained. John Le Conte was known as the father of the university of California. In 1869 when he went there it had only thirty-eight students, to-day it has over 1,200 students and an annual\n\nincome of over $350,000. The boys' home on the plantation of their father in Liberty count}' has been recently described by Joseph. The attic was fitted up as a chemical laboratory in which the father carried on researches daily. His devo tion to botany, too, was very intense. A large area of several acres of enclosed premises was devoted to the maintenance of botanical and floral gardens, widely known at that time as one of the best in the United States, and often visited by\n\nbotanists, both American and foreign. To supply this garden the father made many excursions, often with visiting botanists or collectors, sometimes lasting several days, and always returned laden with botanical treasures. The father's\n\nlife was one of utter forgetfulness of self and \"entirely devoid of any ambition or vanity of reputation; a labor of passionate love of truth for truth's sake.\"\n\nJohn's published works are: Religion and Science, Elements of Geology, Light: An Exposition of the Principles of Monocular and Binocular Vision, Com-\n\nLITERATURE AND JOURNALISM.\n\n29\n\npend of Geology, Evolution; Its Nature, Its Evidences, and Its Relation to Re\n\nligious Thought.\n\nBesides these and numerous contributions to scientific periodicals he had commenced during the war, and nearly finished, a complete treatise on physics, in which were embodied his wide knowledge and long experience in teaching. But at the time of the burning of Columbia in 1865 this work was destroyed. John Le Conte's death occurred in 1891. Just as he was about to leave on a year's vacation in 1889 his wife was taken sick and he was compelled to remain at home. In 1894 Joseph was given a year's vacation and spent the most of it in Europe. Before leaving he attended the International congress of Geologists, which met in Washington and was made first vice-president.\n\nANDREW ADGATE LIPSCOMB.\n\nAndrew Adgate Lipscomb was a. native of the District of Columbia, but most of his long and honored life was spent in Georgia. He was born in 1816 and died in 1890. His literary work was of a very, high order and caused him to be recog nized as one of our most thoughtful and elegant writers. Harper's Magazine in its early years frequently contained notable articles from his pen. Perhaps he was at his best while he was chancellor at the university of Georgia. He was a man of commanding presence and matchless dignity, and yet his genial traits of character and disposition made him a favorite with all classes. His pupils loved him and his intellectual sway was absolute. He resigned his position on account of the death of his son, an event which overshadowed his life ever afterward. His poem, written at the young man's grave, is full of beauty and pathos:\n\n\"I thought that thou in coming time Wouldst be my strength and stay;\n\nI thought to find in thy full prime Support amidst decay;\n\nNo earthly one such aid could give, So tender, strong and wise;\n\n'Twas happiness with thee to live, Though crushed so many ties.\n\n\"But I am here to do for thee, In springtime's early hours,\n\nWhat thou canst never do for me-- Bedeck my tomb with flowers.\n\nAnd yet for me a work thou dost, Which not till late I knew;\n\nGod help my heart this hope to trust Of all my hopes most true.\n\n\"My tears thou wouldst not hear restrained Beside his resting place,\n\nWhose life ne'er gave a moment's pain Or aught else to efface.\n\nI know the loss; I know the gain; And oft have thought they blend\n\nLike sunshine gleaming through the rain When sudden showers descend.\"\n\nLater Dr. Lipscomb was professor of art and criticism at Vanderbilt university, but the climate did not suit him and he returned to Athens, where he was made emeritus professor, holding that position until his death. Longfellow and Hayne were his devoted friends and Margaret J. Preston wrote: \"It is worth while to\n\nO\n\nMEMOIRS OF GEORGIA.\n\nwrite poetry when it falls into such sympathetic hands as yours;'' and again she said: \"You have certainly given two remarkably scholarly books to the Christian reading public. How subtle your thought is, and what depth of Christian philoso phy I find in your studies! Your style is so cultured, and you have the esthetic faculty so largely developed that it takes more than an ordinary reader to follow your discussions. One could think that you had been an art student, so well you seem to understand the somewhat abstruse canons of art. At first blush 1 wondered how you could find so many studies in the Forty Days, but as I come to see how exhaustively you treat the subject, and how many-sided is your way of looking at it, I can better understand how full you find it of Gospel teaching, and how rich a subject it is for education. How vast your reading seems to have been, and what wonderful use you have made of it in the embroidery of your subjects! I cannot now pause over your poetic passages. What a fine one that is at the end of the sixth study of the supplement, but then such abound through out the book.''\n\nAlthough a Methodist divine, Dr. Lipscomb never outgrew his early fondness for a literary career. During forty years he was a popular contributor to some of the leading magazines of the country. As a Shakspearean critic, the author of Studies in the Forty- Days, Milton and several other poems he will never be for gotten by a large circle of appreciating readers. He was a master of all the graces of style, and never allowed anything from his pen to appear in print until it had been carefully revised. But for his modesty he would have been a more conspicu ous figure in the literary world. He shunned publicity, and when the Appletons wrote to him for some facts about his life and work he felt that it would not be proper for him to furnish a sketch or ask a friend to write it. So the doctor has only a very brief notice in the Cyclopedia, but he has left such a lasting impress upon the culture of his beloved south that he does not need the aid of outside biographers.\n\nCHARLES COLCOCK JONES.\n\nCharles Colcock Jones is descended from English ancestry, his forefathers having come from England to South Carolina nearly two centuries ago. During the revolutionary war his grandfather, John Jones, \\vas killed while a major in the continental army, near Savannah, in 1/79. His father, Rev. Charles C. Jones, D. D., was a distinguished minister and was pastor of the First Presbyterian church in Savannah, where Charles C. was born in October, 1831. He afterward retired to his plantation in Liberty county. He was a gentleman of liberal education, and an earnest minister and teacher. Charles C. Jones, Jr., spent his boyhood on the big plantations of his father in Liberty county, where he fished, hunted, sailed boats and enjoyed all sports and amusements engaged in by boys with indulgent parents. Thus he grew up with a strong constitution and a training which was of great value to him in his after life. His father supervised his early studies, with private tutors to aid him. South Caro lina college at Columbia was then presided over by Hon. William C. Preston, and there young Jones spent his freshman and sophomore years, then going to Princeton, X. J., where he was graduated with distinction. He studied law in Phila delphia, and received his degree of LL. 13. in 1855. In addition to the law course he attended the lectures of Agassiz, Longfellow, Wyman, Lowell and Holmes. He returned home, and having spent a winter in the law office of Ward & Owens, became a member of the law firm of Ward, Jackson & Jones. Hon. Henry Jackson, one of the members, had been minister to Austria and Mr. Ward about this time was sent abroad ?.s minister to Chin?.. Col. Jones was one\n\nLITERATURE AND JOURNALISM.\n\n31\n\nof the earliest advocates of secession, and when it became necessary to organize in defense of the south, he became the senior first-lieutenant of the Chatham artillery. He was chief of artillery during the siege of Savannah. When the civil war was over Col. Jones moved to New York and began the practice of law. Here he mingled with literary characters which afforded him opportunities of study and research he could not have found then in the south. In 1877 he returned to Georgia and settled at Montrose in Summerville. In 1879 Col. Jones spent several months in travel, and while in England gained much information, which he used in his History of Georgia, a work pronounced by George Bancroft the finest state history ever published, and one that entitled its author to be called the Macauley of the south. He was a rapid worker, his Siege of Savannah being written in seven evenings, his two volumes of the History of Georgia in seven\n\nmonths and his Histories of Savannah and Augusta in two months. He was regarded after the appearance of his Antiquities of the Southern Indians as the highest authority upon that subject, and that book was the first to bring him into\n\nprominence with European scholars. Col. Jones was the most prolific writer Georgia ever produced and ranks first among southern historical and biograph ical writers of the present generation. He was the eldest of his family, his brother, Prof. Joseph Jones, being a distinguished scholar and chemist. Col. Jones' son, Charles Edgeworth, is a writer of magazine articles and shows evidence of inherit ing his father's talent. Col. Jones was twice married, the first wife being Ruth\n\n(Berrien) Whitehead, of Burke county, and his second, Eva (Berrien) Eve. of Augusta. Both wives were grand-nieces of Hon. John McPherson Berrien, attorney-general in President Jackson's cabinet. Col. Jones was a handsome man, six feet high, broad-shouldered, with a fine head and face. With a com manding presence and charming conversational powers lie possessed an inter esting personality. His death occurred near Augusta, Ga.. in 1893. Col. Jones' published works are: Monumental Remains of Georgia; Historical Sketches of Tomo-chi-chi, Mico of the Yamacraws: Antiquities of the Southern Indians: The Siege of Savannah in December, 1864; The Dead Towns of Georgia; The Life and Services of Commodore Tatnall; Memorial History of Augusta; The\n\nLife, Literary Labors and Neglected Grave of Richard Henry Wilde: Historical Sketches of the Chatham Artillery; Last Days, Death and Burial of Gen. Henry Lee; A Roster of General Officers, Etc., in Confederate Service: The History of Georgia; Negro Myths from the Georgia Coasts; Memorial History of Savannah:\n\nBiographical Sketches of Maj. John Habersham, of Georgia.\n\nFATHER ABRAM J. RYAN.\n\nFather Abram J. Ryan, born in Virginia in 1834, and died in Kentucky\n\nin 1886, was at one time claimed as one of Georgia's poets. For several years\n\nafter the war he was a resident of Augusta. He was born in Norfolk, Va., and\n\nhis parents came from Limerick. Ireland. There being no priest at Norfolk\n\nthe babe was taken to Hagerstown, Md., for baptism, and this incident has been\n\nthe cause of much discussion as to Father Ryan's birth-place. Early training and\n\nexample of a good, patient Christian mother contributed much to Father Ryan's\n\nnoble life, and to that mother did the good man dedicate his poems, or as he ex\n\npressed it, \"laid his simple rhymes as a garland of love\" at her feet. Her piety\n\ndid much in shaping his character, and he has said in speaking of his childhood\n\ndavs:\n\n\"I felt\n\nThat when I knelt\n\nTo listen to my mother's prayer. God wrs v.'th my mother there.\"\n\n32\n\nMEMOIRS OF GEORGIA.\n\nWhen a lad of seven or eight years his parents moved to St Louis, and there he attended the Brothers of the Christian school. He early showed mental activity and graces of character which endeared him to teachers and schoolmates. His reverence for sacred things and places led to the selection of the priesthood for his vocation. He soon entered the ecclesiastical seminary at Niagara, N. Y., and graduated with distinction and began at once the active duties of missionary life. On the outbreak of the war he joined the Confederate army as chaplain, and served until the close. A strict adherent to principle, and a man of deep conviction, he was slow to accept the results of the war, which he believed were fraught with disaster to the people of his section. He was a southerner of the strongest kind. \"Their chariot-wheels had laid waste and desolated the land, and he for one could not bow and kiss the hands that had caused all this woe,\" and so he could make no concessions to the north. His was an open, manly character, and he was ever moved by kind impulses and influenced by charitable feelings, and so it was that when the yellow fever scourge devastated the southern land and the northern heart responded in sympathy to the affliction Father Ryan experienced a change and sung that glorious melody, \"Reunited.\"\n\n\"The Northland, strong in love, and great, Forgot the stormy days of strife; Forgot that souls with dreams of hate Or unforgiveness e'er were rife, Forgotten were each thought and hushed; Save--she was generous and her foe was crushed.\"\n\n\"Thus it was the angel of affliction and the angel of charity joined hands\n\ntogether and pronounced the benediction over a restored Union and a reunited\n\npeople.\" When hostilities had ceased and he heard of Lee's surrender he wrote the poem,\n\n\"Conquered Banner.\" \"Furl that Banner, for 'tis weary; Round its staff 'tis drooping dreary; Furl it, fold it, it is best; For there's not a man to wave it, And there's not a sword to save it. And there's not one left to lave it In the blood which heroes gave it; And its foes now scorn and brave it; Furl it, hide it--let it rest.\n\n***\n\n\"Furl that Banner, softly, slowly! Treat it gently--It is holy--\n\nFor it droope above the dead. Touch it not--unfold it never, Let it droop there, furled forever,\n\nFor its people's hopes are dead:\"\n\nHis poem, the well known \"Sword of Robert Lee,\" was written about the same time. Father Ryan was always a great sympathizer with Ireland, and his feelings found vent in Erin's Flag:\n\n\"Lift it up! lift it up! the old banner of green! The blood of her sons has but brightened its sheen; What though the tyrant has trampled it down, Are its folds not emblazoned with deeds of renwn? What though for ages it droops in the dust, Phall it droop thus forever? No, no! God is just.\"\n\nLITERATURE AND JOURNALISM.\n\n33\n\nHe lived once in Nashville, Tenn., and then moved to Clarksville, Tenn., and later still to Augusta, Ga. He edited the \"Banner of the South\" for five years, but this work was too exacting for him and he resigned from the paper. From 1870 to 1883 he was with St Mary's church in Mobile, Ala. While lecturing in its behalf his health failed and he entered a Franciscan monastery to rest. While there he started his Life of Christ, but before it was finished the angel of death called him home. When the smallpox was raging in 1862 in the Gratiot state prison, the chaplain, alarmed, sought safety in flight No other was found who was willing to risk his life by ministering to the sick and dying. One day a dying man asked for a minister and Father Ryan was sent for. He responded imme diately and remained there for months attending to the sick and suffering. At the close of the war he lived near Beauvoir, Miss., and became an intimate friend of the Davis family. He was fond of music and would for hours play at the piano. Then the spirit would seize him and he would write his sweetest lines. It has been written of him: \"He was a charming poet--one who could rekindle the smoldering embers in the heart, and make them burn with a fiercer flame than those which burned on vestal altars. 'He combined in one nature the impuls iveness of the Celt and the warm-heartedness of the southerner, and when he died he was mourned by all, irrespective of creed. A Roman Catholic, he was honored by Protestants; an Irishman, he was loved and admired by native Americans. Outside of race and creed, he was respected for his true manhood.\"\n\nHe had already won distinction as an orator, a lecturer, an essayist and a poet. \"The leading merits of his poems are the simple sublimity of his verses; the rare and chaste beauty of his conceptions; the richness and grandeur of his thoughts; and their easy natural flow; the refined elegance and captivating force of the terms he employs as the medium through which he communicates those thoughts, and the weird fancy which throws around them charms peculiarly their own; these and other merits will win for their author enduring fame.\" Among his works were the following: Poems (Patriotic, Religious, Miscellaneous), Song of the Mystic, The Sword of Robert Lee, The Prayer of the South, The Conquered Banner, Gather the Sacred Dust, ---- Their Story Runneth Thus, Erin's Flag,\n\nA Crown for Our Queen (prose).\n\nALEXANDER HAMILTON STEPHENS.\n\nAlexander Hamilton Stephens, who died during his gubernatorial term in 1883 at the age of seventy-one, was generally recognized as one of the foremost of American statesmen. He began life a poor orphan, and was indebted to the kindness of a wealthy friend for his education at the university of Georgia. Pres ident Moses Waddell was at that time the president of the college, and under the supervision of that great educator young Stephens made rapid progress. He ranked high as a scholar and a debater, and his record was very gratifying to his benefactor, and the lady who had become interested in his case, and who aided in defraying his expenses. It was thought that he would enter the ministry, but he changed his mind, paid back the money advanced for him, and managed to get through by his own efforts. For some time after graduating he taught school, and while teaching he was admitted to the bar after reading law only two months. Then began a severe struggle. During the first year he lived on six dollars a month and saved $400. He was quite successful in his profession and in 1836 was elected a member of the legislature. He was in congress several vears before the war, and was vice-president of the Confederacy; a member of congress for several terms after the war. and in 1882 he was elected governor. II-3\n\n34\n\nMEMOIRS OF GEORGIA.\n\nWhile an indefatigable student and writer he did not make his appearance as an author until 1867, when his War Between the States was published. This large work in two volumes was sold by subscription, and found its way into thousands of libraries. His school and pictorial History of the United States had a large sale, and won favor with the public. As an author Mr. Stephens was noted for his painstaking accuracy, reliability and impartiality. Although he opposed secession until the very last, and then followed the fortunes of the south, even to the extent of accepting the second office in the Confederacy, he always main tained the right of each state to withdraw from the Union, and his books are remarkable for the strong array of authorities and the arguments advanced to support his views on this subject. At the close of the war he was arrested and imprisoned five months in Fort Warren. He was then paroled, and his wise coun sels materially aided in the restoration of law and order and good government in Georgia. Mr. Stephens was an invalid all his life, but he managed to get through with an immense amount "
