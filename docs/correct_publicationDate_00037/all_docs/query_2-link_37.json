        "text": "In Nameless, Tennessee is the fourth book of the romantic series Love’s A Mystery\n\nIn 1945… When Iris Pitts takes a job teaching in the one-room schoolhouse in Nameless, Tennessee, she hopes her year of despair will finally end. She has no idea if her soldier boyfriend, Will McCrae, was killed, captured, or just broke up with her without a word. But then Will shows up in town, and a series of thefts occur, neither Will nor Iris knows if their rekindled relationship can survive. As Iris scrambles to find the thief—while reassuring Will of her love—she discovers what it means to have God know her name.\n\nToday… Accomplished musician Maggie Lange leaves the glare of Nashville for the peace and anonymity of Nameless. She buys a run-down old schoolhouse with plans to turn it into a home with the help of contractor Ian Weber. Maggie and Ian grow closer as they work on the building—and on solving the mystery of her birth parents, who have ties to the town. But will a devastating truth about her family history be more than Maggie can overcome? Or will she learn that some things—including love—have a far greater value than anything the world can ascribe?"
