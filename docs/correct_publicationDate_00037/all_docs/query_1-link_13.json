        "text": "Continuing the Arkham House tradition, this anthology offers the discerning reader of the macabre no less than twenty-seven newly published stories by twenty-three authors, both established and new, exploring a wide and wondrous range of modern fantastic writing. The traditional and the off-trail are represented in a collection certain to appeal to the devotee and general reader alike.\n\nRamsey Campbell is represented by two stories, The Last Hand and The Christmas Present -- the last an adaptation of a work broadcast on the BBC. Carl Jacobi offers the intriguing Chameleon Town, and Denys Val Baker purveys horror in a commonplace setting in Before the Event. Robert Aickman, in The Real Road to the Church, and E. Hoffman Prince, in Selene, combine the occult with the ordinary in stories as thought-provoking as they are different.\n\nLovecraftian themes are developed in A. A. Attanasio's nouvelle Glimpses, which signals the Arkham House debut of an outstanding young author, and in stories by Lin Carter, Walter C. DeBill, and Joseph Payne Brennan. Equally Lovecraftian,though in a uniquely different manner, is Gary Myers' sly The Gods of Earth, certain to delight readers of his The House of the Worm.\n\nThomas Burnett Swann makes his Arkham House debut with Night of the Unicorn, a rare venture into shorter fiction, and Robert E. Gilbert offers a minor masterpiece of psychological insight in Walls of Yellow Clay, Brian Ball's The Warlord of Kul Satu will satisfy the seeker after horror, while Scott Edelstein's two contributions will enhance his reputation as a satirist, Joseph F. Pumilia's Dark Vintage advances an ingenious -- and frightening -- new concept.\n\nCondition: Pre-loved book. Minor yellowing of pages. Otherwise in good condition."
