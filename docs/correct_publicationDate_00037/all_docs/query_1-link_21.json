She heard someone dialling on another line...\"\n\nBarbara Waugh’s daughter Angela was kidnapped aged four, and when a disfigured body turns up that appears to be the end of the matter. Dealing with grief, Barbara establishes herself as a literary agent. Years after the disappearance she receives a phone call from Angela.\n\nConvinced her daughter is alive, Barbara’s investigations take her deep into London, New York, and Scotland. Was a brainwashing cult responsible for Angela’s abduction? The more Barbara learns, the less she can trust, including those closest to her. Will she succumb to an evil so murderous it might not be of human origin?\n\nFLAME TREE PRESS is the imprint of long-standing Independent Flame Tree Publishing, dedicated to full-length original fiction in the horror and suspense, science fiction and fantasy.

He has received the Grand Master Award of the World Horror Convention, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Horror Writers Association, the Living Legend Award of the International Horror Guild and the World Fantasy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2015 he was made an Honorary Fellow of Liverpool John Moores University for outstanding services to literature.\n\nHis first book was published by the legendary Arkham House when he was eighteen years old. His later work draws on the British and American traditions of horror fiction. It ranges from the psychological to the ghostly, the subtly uncanny to the cosmic, the quietly disquieting to the terrifying, the poignant to the darkly comic. His Flame Tree books include Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach, in which a family on holiday encounters an ancient horror on a Greek island, and Think Yourself Lucky, where the internet lets loose the monsters lurking within people just like us. In Somebody’s Voice a writer finds his memory and personality threatened by trying to write the memoir of a victim of abuse. The Three Births of Daoloth trilogy – The Searching Dead, Born to the Dark and The Way of the Worm – pits three childhood friends against a terror as vast as time and space.\n\nThree of Campbell’s novels have been filmed – The Influence (available from FLAME TREE PRESS), Pact of the Fathers and The Nameless (in development as a Netflix series). He reviewed films for the local BBC for nearly forty years, and is presently working on an appreciation of the Three Stooges, Six Stooges and Counting. A new supernatural novel, Fellstones, is in progress too."
