        "text": "Hello fellow book nerds! Today is an exciting day because I get to share with you the YA novel for Allison Rose’s book The Nameless. The cover and synopsis is fascinating and I cannot wait to read this book. I am lucky enough to share with an excerpt of the book as well. Enjoy!\n\nHappy Reading!\n\nThe Nameless\n\nSeries: Tales of an Outcast Faerie\n\nAuthor: Allison Rose\n\nPublishing Date: December 12, 2018\n\nGenres: YA Fantasy\n\nGoodreads\n\nOrder Here: Amazon\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nFaeries withdrew from the human world long ago, no longer able to live in a place where magic was forsaken. They declared it a world of darkness, fit only for faerie outcasts.\n\nWhen a dark magic stirs in the woods of the human world, a sixteen-year-old girl and an outcast faerie unwittingly cross paths.\n\nNola pleads with the faerie to help her thwart the group of her human peers that wield the dark magic.\n\nUntil this moment, all Kelty wanted was to earn back her place in Faerie. Now she must choose between turning her back on the humans or sacrificing her dreams to help them, for contact with humans drains faerie magic. And weakened faeries were not welcome back home.\n\nThe threat grows as Briar, the faerie responsible for Kelty’s banishment, appears in the human world, intent on continuing the dangerous game that started in Faerie. This time, Nola is caught up in it as well.\n\nOnce, faeries and humans turned their backs on each other. Now, they must learn to come together once again or risk the destruction of the human world.\n\nExcerpt\n\nPrologue\n\nAll life begins and ends with the ara, the life force within all living things.\n\nIt connects man, beast, and faerie to the natural world.\n\nIt is a magic that must be nurtured and protected.\n\nThis was true for the land of Earth once, when man and faerie lived in peace beside each other.\n\nOver time, the humans began to pull away from the natural world and their faerie brethren.\n\nThey grew so far from magic that they forgot its existence and denied it altogether.\n\nNo longer able to live in such a place, the first faeries withdrew from Earth, creating a world of their own.\n\nThe world known as Faerie now remains connected to Earth by a single magical pathway. Only the rulers of Faerie hold the key.\n\nThe human world became merely a story to those of Faerie; the few who were forced to cross to the human world were those who committed the unforgivable.\n\nThe outcasts.\n\nChapter One\n\nForevermore an outcast.\n\nThe words echoed in Kelty’s mind as laughter drew her gaze to a human family among the visitors of the park below. Resentment and longing burned in her chest at their smiling faces, yet she could not look away. Landing with light feet on a branch high above the field, she folded her wings to her back as a long sigh escaped her lips.\n\nThe sun shone upon on the woods of the human world, casting a brightness upon the leaves. But despite the brilliant green, the fresh air, it paled in comparison to the world of Faerie.\n\nKelty took a breath as the homesickness hit her. Sinking into a crouch, she reached inward to the magic at her core and sent some of it through her bare feet into the rough bark. Connecting to the ara, the life energy within the tree, she used the steady, soothing presence to ground herself.\n\nThe ara of this world was weak, but it was starting to respond to her. Nurturing and caring for the energy of the land was all she knew how to do in this place of banishment. What little life existed in the plants, trees, and soil now glowed brighter, healthier to her vision. She was doomed to be its only champion.\n\nKelty’s eyes followed the two human children, a boy and a girl, as they squealed and chased each other around in the lush grass. Their movements were a little awkward given their small stature, but their fun continued regardless. Two adults watched the children attentively from a picnic blanket, looking on with indulgent smiles.\n\nTo see such joy at the simple connection with the world around them, proof that not all humans were entirely apathetic and destructive, should have inspired relief in Kelty. This day, the sight only served as a reminder of the life she lost, the future now out of reach.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAllison Rose\n\nDriven by a lifelong passion for words and reading fantasy novels, Allison Rose writes YA fantasy stories featuring faeries, magic, and female heroines.
