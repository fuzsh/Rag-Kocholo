        "text": "1.\n\nMs. Thing 05:45\n\nToo tired to sleep She lingers by the window, and wonders…. Old books collect in a corner. Why must it always be? No one to call, Not one to worry, still, Dear Ms. Thing, Don’t feel so precious. Fix your smile, Adjust your glasses. Too tired to cry She puts away her photos, and wonders…. Shadows grow mean in the corner; Lit by a curious moon. She tries to call No one remembers her name Ms. Thing, Don’t feel so precious. Fix your smile, Adjust your glasses. Clear your throat And smooth your hair Then walk into The cold night air. Dear Ms. Thing, Don’t be afraid. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be afraid.\n\n2.\n\nIn the light of a quiet moon I would wait by my door And if I see you there I’d try not to stare, You’re so easy on the eyes If not the heart. If you pass, will you notice me? I could hope for a glance. A simple nod would do. Would I fall for you? It would be so easy to give in, I would not ever be indifferent To one I hope to love.\n\n3.\n\nComes the Rain 06:13\n\nLong ago, Our hearts were young, I danced in the rain. Now skies get dark I stay inside And watch the rain. I’m really not afraid, I just don’t want to ruin The fantasy of youth. So comes the rain Perhaps I’ll be My old self again.\n\n4.\n\nThe Blind Man 06:01\n\nThe blind man Playing guitar (whose name not I nor do i think anyone else floating bye and bye recalled) As the August moon blushed As the steel sky yawned to God But when do we remember?\n\n5.\n\nLovecraft on the Beach 02:59\n\nMister looks out from his window, Watches the leaves dance in the breeze. Shakes a smile, picks up his pencil, Thinks about the monsters in the trees. Sees himself standing in the ocean, Hears the flutes off in the distance. Comes the dark, voices whisper. In the dark, voices whisper. Mister has written a letter To someone he would never meet. Auntie serves tea in the parlor, Life is good, but often bittersweet. Winding his way through the gray streets, Hears the chant coming from the ocean. Quiet night drowned in seclusion, Fading light bathed in illusion.\n\n6.\n\nA Widow's Tale 07:14\n\nSo like a child She is wanting, Much like a child. So like a child She is needing, Much like a child Lonely afterthoughts, Mid-life crises. Wine and a thousand dreams, Be still, be still. Talk to me now, Tell a story, Talk to me now. Speak as a child Who is keeping Thoughts of a child. Moon above the skies, Cold and yearning. Anger in your eyes, Be still, be still.\n\n7.\n\nScary People 05:34\n\nWhistling in the dark Try’n to keep my mind From wand’ring. Things just seem so bleak In the dark. I think I shall stay Right where I am ‘way from scary, scary people Waiting in the dark Try’n to keep my heart From jumping The light is very weak, Very cold I think I shall stay Right where I am ‘way from scary, scary people\n\n8.\n\nAngelo 04:37\n\n9.\n\nSideshow 06:33\n\nThe curtain pulled aside, The whisp’ring in the crowd. And the show begins When the lights have dimmed. Before our eyes Wonders take shape then dance And disappear.\n\n10.\n\nGhosts 04:41"
