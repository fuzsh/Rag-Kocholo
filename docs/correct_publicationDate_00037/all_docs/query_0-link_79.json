        "text": "It’s New Year’s Eve. Forget the parties and the champagne. At Chez Reading Matters, it’s all about celebrating the books!\n\nAnd what a reading year it has been. I read more books than usual this year, cracking the 100-mark for the first time since 2010. These were mainly books I bought myself, with less than 10 per cent of the titles I read being supplied by publishers.\n\nReading adventures\n\nMy consistent focus throughout the year was delving into the backlist of the late Irish writer William Trevor as part of a project — “A Year with William Trevor” — which I co-hosted with Cathy from 746 books. It was enormously rewarding to read his work in chronological order (one per month) and to notice his development as a writer over time. I’ll be sure to write a more in-depth post about what I learned in the weeks to come.\n\nI also went through a bit of an Italian literature phase, exploring a burgeoning fascination with Italy’s Fascist history by reading novels, memoirs and diaries set in this era. I am sure this exploration will continue into 2024 and beyond.\n\nI also read several books from the 2023 Stella Prize longlist and the full shortlist for the 2023 Kerry Group Novel of the Year.\n\nI participated in many blogger “events” including Annabel’s Nordic Finds, Bill’s Gen 5 Week, Lizzie and Karen’s Reading Independent Publishers Month, Cathy’s Reading Ireland Month, Cathy’s 20 Books of Summer, Women in Translation Month, Karen and Simon’s 1962 Club, and Cathy and Rebecca’s Novellas in November.\n\nPhew.\n\nBook highlights\n\nNow onto my favourite reads of the year!\n\nSo what makes the cut? Stories I remember. Part of this blog’s purpose is to act as an aide-mémoire, but if I look through my reading log and can’t recall the detail of a story then it’s fair to say it hasn’t made much of an impression.\n\nFortunately, this year many of them have “stuck”.\n\nI’ve read so many wonderful novels, novellas, short stories, memoirs and more in 2023 that it has proved more challenging than usual to edit it down to 10 favourite reads. Instead, I’ve broken it down into a dozen fiction, six non-fiction and — with enormous difficulty — managed to choose my favourite William Trevor from the year!\n\nAnyway, without further ado, here are my favourite reads of 2023. Note, they’re not necessarily books published in 2023, they’re just the ones I managed to read in the past 12 months.\n\nThey are arranged in alphabetical order by author’s surname and, as ever, hyperlinks will take you to my full review.\n\n12 FAVOURITE NOVELS\n\n‘Against the Loveless World’ by Susan Abulhawa (Palestinian, 2020)\n\nA Palestinian woman, imprisoned in a small nine-metre square cell, writes her remarkable life story on the cinder-block walls. This narrative, which is urgent, compelling and full of verve, vigour and a slow, seething anger, gave me a new perspective on the current situation in Gaza and I found it made an excellent back-to-back companion with Adania Shibli’s Minor Detail, another Palestinian novel I highly recommend.\n\n‘The Anniversary’ by Stephanie Bishop (Australian, 2023)\n\nThis book is a hoot! It’s about a couple celebrating their 14th wedding anniversary on board a cruise ship but a terrible tragedy midway through their trip puts their relationship under intense scrutiny. Carefully plotted, suspenseful and full of unexpected ah-ha moments, the novel is a masterclass in wrong-footing the reader at every turn.\n\n‘The Terrible Event’ by David Cohen (Australian, 2023)\n\nI loved this comic collection of surreal and absurdist stories heavily inspired by British author Magnus Mills. I’m still thinking about the final story in which a transport engineer sets out to discover what impact a fake white cross will have on passing motorists — and then has to invent a whole back story when people actually stop and begin paying their respects!\n\n‘Paradise Estate’ by Max Easton (Australian, 2023)\n\nAn exhilarating chronicle of communal living set in Sydney’s inner-west in 2022, this one has important things to say about the current state of the nation. It’s especially good on the housing crisis, the precarious job market and the climate catastrophe but never comes across as being heavy-handed.\n\n‘Orbital’ by Samantha Harvey (British, 2023)\n\nA beautiful, thought-provoking love letter to our planet, this one really shouldn’t work. There’s next to no plot, there’s not a huge amount of character development and it’s set on the international space station orbiting the earth, but the writing is so sublime and the issues explored so well thought through it really made an impression on me.\n\n‘Soldier Sailor’ by Claire Kilroy (Irish, 2023)\n\nI’ve followed Claire Kilroy since 2008, so I was expecting great things from this book — her first in more than a decade — and it didn’t disappoint. Written in a stream-of-consciousness style, it’s a gripping account of motherhood’s darker side and highlights the inequality between men and women when it comes to parenthood. But it’s the unique and distinctive voice that really makes this story shine.\n\n‘The Colony’ by Audrey Magee (Irish, 2021)\n\nA compelling satire about the impacts of colonisation on a small island off the west coast of Ireland, this Booker long-listed novel reads like a simple fable but there’s so much more going on beneath. It feels like an anthropological study reminiscent, say, of J.M. Synge’s The Aran Islands, and I loved the nods to Magnus Mills’ absurdist stories, too.\n\n‘Sundays in August’ by Patrick Modiano (French, 1986)\n\nI read a handful of books by Modiano this year, but this one, distinctively different to his others, was my favourite. It’s essentially a jewel heist set in Nice, on the French Riviera, and is a perfectly paced and plotted noirish crime novella, one that demands a second reading just so you can figure out the clues you missed the first time round.\n\n‘Grand Days’ by Frank Moorhouse (Australian, 1993)\n\nThe first in a trilogy, this Australian classic charts the early days of Edith Campbell Berry’s career at the League of Nations in the 1920s. I loved how modern and inclusive it felt in terms of themes (a transvestite and a woman battling sexism and misogyny in the workplace) and I’m excited to read the two follow-ups in 2024.\n\n‘August is a Wicked Month’ by Edna O’Brien (Irish, 1965)\n\nHere’s another favourite read from 2023 with August in the title, which is also set on the French Riviera. This relatively bleak tale is about a woman, separated from her husband, who goes on a spur-of-the-moment holiday that does not go according to plan. The bit that sticks in my mind is a singular event which acts like a major key change, transforming what should have been a hopeful tale into a tragedy.\n\n‘The House on the Hill’ by Cesare Pevase (Italian, 1948)\n\nWhat does it take to be a hero? And why are some people unable to live up to our best ideals? This is the central nub of this exceptional novella about an Italian school teacher who falls in with a group of anti-fascists during the Second World War. Even though he admires the righteousness of their actions, he can’t commit to their cause because, rightly or wrongly, he prefers a quiet life.\n\n‘Return to Valetto’ by Dominic Smith (Australian, 2023)\n\nPast and present collide in this intricately woven novel set in a near-abandoned Italian village perched on a rocky outcrop in Umbria. It’s a brilliantly entertaining read, full of interesting, quirky characters. It’s also the book that set me off on a course to find out more about Italy’s fascist past and its role in the Second World War, something I’d never really considered before.\n\n6 FAVOURITE NON-FICTION BOOKS\n\n‘We Come with This Place’ by Debra Dank (Australian/First Nations, 2023)\n\nThis book won all the awards — and rightly so. It is an evocative memoir about place, culture, history, family and the special connection First Nations people have with Country. I especially love the unique way in which Dank uses time to tell her story. Every Australian should read this.\n\n‘The Queen is Dead’ by Stan Grant (Australian/First Nations, 2023)\n\nFollowing in the wake of the death of Queen Elizabeth II, this is a powerful, profound and deeply personal book about the Crown’s negative legacy on Australia’s First Nations people. This one also made me realise how Black and White are just social constructs, rather than biological realities because we are all human and there’s no such thing as race.\n\n‘Christ Stopped at Eboli’ by Carlo Levi (Italian, 1945)\n\nEasily the best book I read all year, this is a sublime first-hand account of Levi’s experience as a political exile banished to one of the poorest regions in Italy for anti-fascist activities under Mussolini. It’s essentially an anthropological study but is embued with much compassion and humanity. It’s heartfelt without being sentimental, and insightful without being judgemental.\n\n‘Aphrodite’s Breath’ by Susan Johnson (Australian, 2023)\n\nThis is the kind of book you read in one sitting. It’s about a mother-daughter relationship that is tested to the limits when the pair move from Australia to live on the Greek island of Kythera. Frank and funny, it’s as much about the island’s culture, landscape, history and people as it is about Susan’s relationship with her 85-year-old mother and the tensions that threaten to unravel it.\n\n‘A Chill in the Air: An Italian War Diary, 1939-1940’ and ‘War in Val d’Orcia: An Italian War Diary 1943-1944’ by Iris Origo (Italian, 2018 and 1947)\n\nI’m cheating a bit here because these are two separate volumes, but I read them one after the other and the experience was intensely unforgettable. The first is a chilling account of how Italy stumbled into conflict in 1940, while the second recounts the author’s time at her family’s 2,800-hectare estate, La Foce, where she put her own life on the line by hiding escaped Allied prisoners of war. Both books, but especially the latter, are powerful testimonies of doing good in the world when it would be so much easier to bury your head in the sand.\n\n‘Trust: A fractured fable’ by Jeanne Ryckmans (Australian, 2023)\n\nIf you made this story up people would say it was too unbelievable to be true. It’s a revealing tale about an Irish conman who charmed everyone, including his lover who wrote this book, into handing over cash to fund his lavish lifestyle. I raced through this book in one sitting; it’s a proper page-turner.\n\nA FAVOURITE WILLIAM TREVOR BOOK\n\n‘The Silence in the Garden’ (Ireland, 1988)\n\nAll the William Trevor books I read this year (12 in total) were wonderful, so trying to choose one is akin to choosing your favourite child. However, the story that seems to have stuck in my memory the most, and which I still occasionally think about, is this one. Funnily enough, when I first read it I wasn’t initially convinced by it. It’s slow-moving and deeply contemplative but it got its hooks into me the more I read, and I now recall it with great fondness. Through the prism of a wealthy Anglo-Irish family living on their own secluded island at risk of being opened up to the broader population — thanks to the construction of a new bridge — it explores Ireland’s changing political circumstances, and as such represents a turning point in Trevor’s career.\n\nI hope you have discovered some wonderful books and writers this year. Have you read any from this list? Or has it encouraged you to try one or two? What were your favourite reads of 2023?\n\nPlease note that you can see my favourite books of all the years between 2006 and 2023 by visiting my Books of the Year page.\n\nFiction – Kindle edition; Quoqs Publishing for Magnus Mills/Kindle Direct Publishing; 181 pages; 2020.\n\nEnglish bus driver turned writer Magnus Mills is a longtime favourite author of mine.\n\nHis deeply allegoric novels take the gentle piss out of British exceptionalism — the idea that Britain is morally, culturally and politically superior to other nations — and uses skeletal, almost pedestrian prose, to reveal the mundanity of people’s lives and livelihoods.\n\nSadly, he appears to have been dropped by his publisher Bloomsbury, but in recent years has issued five new books under his own steam, including this one which was published in 2020.\n\nThe Trouble with Sunbathers is about Brexit and Trump without ever committing those (horrid) words to paper!\n\nPreserving the past\n\nIn this story, the American president has purchased Britain and turned it into a national park.\n\nThe president wanted Britain to always remain the same as it was when he’d glimpsed it briefly through the window of his aeroplane. This was why the terms of the purchase stipulated that nothing should be changed, the only exception being the four ceremonial gates (designed by the president’s son-in-law) that marked the inauguration of the national park. (p56)\n\nThe unnamed narrator and his colleague, Rupert, man the western gate.\n\nThe wrought iron gates are supposed to remain open at all times, so the men are essentially employed to greet people as they pass through. They soon learn that there’s an economic advantage if they close the gates at odd intervals because people are so relieved when the gates are opened after they have been queuing for hours that they leave generous tips and gratuities.\n\nThe men also have business dealings with other characters, including a menacing American called Carruthers, and a man who wants to come and paint the gate.\n\nBut on the whole, not much happens. Visits to the national park begin to dry up because everything inside the gates is falling into disrepair — “buildings were crumbling, bridges were collapsing and entire industries were lying in ruins” — helped in part by a lack of investment, increasing isolation and local acts of vandalism.\n\nThe entire population now resides on the coast (outside the gates) and spends all their time sunbathing (hence the title). They simply couldn’t care less about what’s going on in their own backyard, so to speak.\n\nThere are fewer and fewer cars on the road, too, because even the cars are falling into disrepair and cannot be fixed because there’s a shortage of spare parts.\n\nThe shortage was predicted years ago. We all saw it coming and the obvious solution was staring us in the face. Universal spare parts! Absolute simplicity and uniformity! Problem solved at a stroke! It made sense. Every country adopted universal spare parts because they could be interchanged and used in any vehicle. Every country, that is, except Great Britain. Great Britain refused to cooperate. Great Britain insisted that only British parts could be fitted in British vehicles. So what happened when the parts ran out? Everything ground to a halt. (p35)\n\nMinor subplots\n\nThere are subplots revolving around a statue that keeps falling over and another about a drive-in movie theatre playing the same promotional video about a young British girl moving to Africa so she can learn to ride an elephant (a nod, I suspect, to the days of Empire), but the main narrative is an allegory for what happens if you cut yourself off from the rest of the world.\n\nIn the end, the President decides he no longer wants to keep Britain even though he “claimed to have developed a deep attachment to the ‘old country’”. Basically, he wants to reneg on his purchase when he discovers there is nothing exceptional about Great Britain after all:\n\n‘I’m sorry to have to tell you,’ he announced, ‘that yours is a very mediocre little country. We’ve carried out an extensive survey during the past few months and our findings paint a sorry picture. The landscape is bland and uninspiring. The weather is unreliable. The beer is tepid. The roads are narrow. The rivers are sluggish. There re no proper mountains. No big skies. No untamed frontiers. No pioneers. No trailblazers. Nobody seeks adventure. Nobody runs any risks. In short, we’ve concluded that nothing exciting, interesting or unusual ever happens here.’ (p157)\n\nThe Trouble with Sunbathers is typical Magnus Mills fare. It’s absurdist and surreal with a hint of trademark foreboding underneath the surface.\n\nThe dialogue, as ever, is stilted and there’s not much in the way of character development or plot. But fans will know that’s not why you read Mills’ work.\n\nYou read it for the fable-like quality of the writing, the snide little digs and the perfectly deadpan sense of humour. You read it because it is so delightfully different to anything else out there.\n\nFiction – paperback; Allen & Unwin; 400 pages; 2023. Review copy courtesy of the publisher.\n\nAustralian author Christos Tsiolkas is known for bold storytelling that is provocative, salacious and socially aware. But as he matures, so, too, does his work.\n\nHis latest novel, The In-Between, is a tender love story between two middle-aged men who have been damaged by past relationships.\n\nYes, it still maintains Tsiolkas’ trademark edginess and carnality, but it’s certainly softer and less risque than anything he’s written before.\n\nI ate it up in the space of a weekend and loved its depiction of an unlikely relationship between two very different people essentially seeking the same thing: love, companionship and to be “seen” for who they are, not what they are.\n\nNervous date\n\nThis character-driven story begins with a nervous internet date between Perry, a translator newly repatriated from France, and Ivan, a landscape gardener who runs his own business.\n\nBoth men are in their 50s but are like chalk and cheese — one is the son of Greek immigrants, the other is the son of Serbians; one is highly educated, the other is not; one has travelled the world, the other has only ever left Australia once; one is cerebral, the other is practical; one lives in Melbourne’s inner north, the other lives in a southern bayside suburb; one has never had children, the other has an adult daughter and a grandchild.\n\nYet both men have something important in common — they have been damaged in love and are almost at the point of giving up on ever finding love again. Perry is still recovering from a long-time affair with a married man that went sour, while Ivan is constantly at loggerheads with his ex-wife over a past affair that ended in theft and violence.\n\nIt then charts the course of their relationship over many years in a series of sizeable chapters, each one told from a different perspective and at a different point in time so that the reader has to fill in the gaps about what might have happened in between (hence the novel’s title).\n\nThe class divide\n\nThrough the prism of the relationship, Tsiolkas examines the class divide. There’s a dinner party in chapter 3 which brings all this to the fore — and it’s one of the best things I’ve ever read. The dialogue is cracking, and the tension and suspense are absolutely nerve-shredding!\n\nThe party is particularly excruciating for Perry because in introducing his new lover to his old university friends, Yasmine and Cora, he is opening himself up to their judgements (and aspersions) — and he’s not sure if he can take it.\n\nDuring the first course, the conversation is “genial, curious, and does not stray into any controversial or difficult terrain”, but as the evening progresses there are moments of high tension as the guests, which include an additional heterosexual couple, discuss matters in which Ivan has next to no experience.\n\nPerry finds he cannot settle that sense of unease. He is too aware of Ivan, who answers the questions asked of him with courtesy and calmness. Yet he conspicuously refrains from contributing to the discussion. Jed is an academic, a professor at the School of Biological Sciences at Monash Unversity. Perry is conscious of the assumption of a shared language and system of beliefs among the five at the table who have university degrees. At one point, just as Yasmine rises to take the plates away, Evelyn asks Ivan, “Where did you study?”\n\nPerry freezes […]\n\n“I did trade school at a horticultural college. I started my apprenticeship when I was sixteen.” Ivan takes a piece of flatbread, piles hummus onto it. “I hated high school — couldn’t wait to leave.” (p153)\n\nCue a pin dropping — and Perry disappearing to the bathroom so he can avoid the questioning looks and quietly swallow his own anger.\n\nIn another chapter, we learn of Ivan’s dependence on extra-curricular sex, which also casts him as an outsider, and there’s the constant hint of a violent past. But there’s no doubt that the love between Perry and Ivan is profound and life-changing.\n\nTypically Tsiolkas\n\nThe In-Between is written in Tsiolkas’ usual unflinching style. His descriptions of sexual encounters are typically pornographic, which might come as a shock if you have not read his work before. But there’s a new vulnerability in his writing, a willingness to reveal the hunger for human connection in emotional, not just physical, terms.\n\nHe lays bare the need to be kind and gentle with one another, to accept differences, to forgive others their trespasses and to live with candour and verve.\n\nI think this might be his best work yet.\n\nThe In-Between will be published in the UK by Atlantic in May 2024.\n\nBook launch in Fremantle\n\nAs reported via my Instagram account, last month I saw Christos in Fremantle. He was in conversation with local writer Holden Sheppard, who was an impressive moderator, steering the conversation in interesting directions and asking great questions.\n\nI loved these insights:\n\nTsiolkas’ father, who did not speak English, would buy him random books to read, such as Dickens, Xavier Herbert and the “wildly inappropriate” Henry Robbins because he wanted his son to have an education.\n\nHis mother was so shell-shocked by a cinema screening of Loaded (an adaption of his debut novel renamed Head On) that she took him to a pokies pub where they both got drunk on whisky and “had the best and most important conversation of my life”.\n\nIf you want to be a writer be “thy excellent reader” and read often and widely and out of your comfort zone.\n\nIn the signing queue afterwards, I reminded him that we had previously met at a publishers’ dinner party in London to celebrate the launch of Barracuda in 2014 and I had also seen him at the launch of Damascus in Fremantle in 2019. He remembered me and then embraced me in a giant bear hug!\n\nFiction – Kindle edition; Vintage Digital; 138 pages; 2023.\n\nOrbital, by British writer Samantha Harvey, is a beautiful, thought-provoking love letter to our planet. It will probably be my book of the year for 2023.\n\nSometimes you need to leave a country, or a situation, to write about it, because the distance offers a broader perspective or new insights that you can’t see when you are too close. It’s that idea that Harvey has exploited here. She celebrates the beauty and fragility of our planet from the perspective of outer space.\n\nHer novella charts the experiences of a group of astronauts orbiting the globe in the first 24 hours of a nine-month stint onboard the International Space Station.\n\nIt’s not science fiction; rather, it uses the device of literary fiction to delve into the well-documented “overview effect” — the profound change in perception, or consciousness, that astronauts undergo when observing Earth from space.\n\nThey look down and they understand why it’s called Mother Earth. They all feel it from time to time. They all make an association between the earth and a mother, and this in turn makes them feel like children. (p8)\n\nOrbiting our planet\n\nThe book is divided into multiple chapters, one for each orbit of the Earth on a single day in October, and each of those orbits (both ascending and descending) is told from the point of view of a different astronaut.\n\nThere are two women and four men on board. Four of them are astronauts from the US, Japan, Britain and Italy, and two are Russian cosmonauts.\n\nAnton–quiet, and dry in his humour, sentimental, crying openly at films, at scenes outside the window–Anton the spaceship’s heart. Pietro its mind, Roman (the current commander, dextrous and capable, able to fix anything, control the robotic arm with millimetre precision, wire the most complex circuit board) its hands, Shaun its soul (Shaun there to convince them all that they have souls), Chie (methodical, fair, wise, not-quite definable or pin-downable) its conscience, Nell (with her eight-litre diving lungs) its breath. (p18)\n\nFrom their vantage point — and travelling at an astonishing seventeen and a half thousand miles an hour — they see the sun rise and set with mechanical-like precision, observe the passing of continents and island states outside their windows, see the shifting weather patterns and cloud formations, taking as many photographs as they can along the way.\n\nTheir individual and collective sense of awe is palpable. The Earth looks “so spectacular, so dignified and regal” and yet there’s a dissonance at play:\n\nThey think: maybe it’s hard being human and maybe that’s the problem. Maybe it’s hard to shift from thinking your planet is safe at the centre of it all to knowing in fact it’s a planet of normalish size and normalish mass rotating about an average star in a solar system of average everything in a galaxy of innumerably many, and that the whole thing is going to explode or collapse.\n\nTime for self-reflection\n\nBut the astronauts aren’t just fixated on what they can see outside; there’s a lot of introspection too. Shaun puts it like this:\n\nWhat the hell am I doing here, in a tin can in a vacuum? A tinned man in a tin can. Four inches of titanium away from death. Not just death, obliterated non-existence. (p49)\n\nAnd there’s a preoccupation with their past individual histories — after all, there’s a lot of time to think — and current situations down on Earth.\n\nFor instance, just a short time into the flight Chie discovers that her mother has died, which revives memories of her childhood in Japan and forces her to contemplate that she’s now an orphan. But here, cocooned from the stark reality of her loss, she finds solace in looking at Earth from up above and wishes she could stay orbiting it forever:\n\nDon’t go back. Stay here ongoing. The creamy light of the ocean so exquisite; the gentle clouds rippling in tides. With a zoom lens the first fall of snow on top of Mount Fuji, the silver bracelet of the Nagara River where she swam as a child. Just here, the perfect solar arrays drinking sun. (p14)\n\nWhile Harvey slowly fleshes out the backstories of her individual characters, it’s the way they interact as a collective being that is really the point of the story. Here, living in the space station, their survival is wholly dependent on how they cooperate, collaborate and work together. Above all, they must curb their own independence and put the crew’s needs ahead of their own desires.\n\nIt’s hard not to see this as an allegory for what needs to happen on the Earth below:\n\nThey come to see the politics of want. The politics of growing and getting, a billion extrapolations of the urge for more, that’s what they begin to see when they look down. The planet is shaped by the sheer amazing force of human want, which has changed everything, the forests, the poles, the reservoirs, the glaciers, the rivers, the seas, the mountains, the coastlines, the skies, a planet contoured and landscaped by want. (p75)\n\nA novel of ideas\n\nFor such a slim volume, Orbital is fat with ideas. It eloquently examines geopolitics, human greed and environmentalism, using the beauty of the Earth spinning in space as a way to take a high-level look at issues that deeply affect us all.\n\nThe writing is eloquent, and filled with lush, vivid descriptions. Only occasionally I thought they were beginning to wear thin (there are only so many ways you can say the same thing using different words, right?), but what held the narrative together and maintained my attention was the emotions it evoked in me. These ranged from awe to delight, anger to sadness — and everything in between.\n\nBut I came away from it feeling a real sense of hope. There’s a review at The Guardian which puts it better: “It’s an Anthropocene book resistant to doom”.\n\n(Australian readers please note, this won’t be published here until early February. I purchased my copy via Amazon.co.uk after I read Harvey’s 2018 novel, The Western Wind, last month and then went looking to see if she had written anything new since then.)\n\nFiction – paperback; Penguin Classics; 144 pages; 2007.\n\nBodily Secrets, by William Trevor, was published in 2007 as part of a 20-book series called “Penguin Great Loves”^^ which I bought as a beautifully designed boxed set many years ago.\n\nThis slim volume features five short stories — previously published in The Collected Stories of William Trevor in 1992 — all revolving around various forms of love, including unreciprocated love, adulterous love, sexual love and convenient love.\n\nBlack comedy\n\nThe opening story, The Day We Got Drunk on Cake, is a black comedy in which four people — Mike, his colleague Swann, and two of Swann’s friends, Jo and Margo — go on a boozy lunch in London’s Soho that extends long into the night.\n\nDuring this farce-like escapade, Mike is constantly looking for a phone to ring Lucy (in the days before mobile phones), a woman he is in love with but who doesn’t reciprocate his feelings. In all the multiple conversations he has with her over the course of the day, Lucy is unfailingly polite, but he begins to wear her patience:\n\n“Hello, Lucy. How are you?”\n\n“I’m fine, Mike.”\n\n“Good.”\n\n“Mike, you telephoned me at four fifteen. Do you know what time it is now?”\n\n“What time is it now?”\n\n“Four thirty-five.” (p9)\n\nThese nuisance calls are interleaved with conversations in which Margo beseeches Mike to help her with a personal problem. Her husband Nigel brings home elderly women, “explaining he has been attending some meeting with them and has brought them back for coffee”. But Margo doesn’t know what the meetings are about and is worried Nigel will start bringing home “tramps, grocers, one-legged soldiers”.\n\nTo find out what’s really going on, Mike pretends to call Nigel — under the guise of being an official from the Ministry of Pensions — but instead, he rings Lucy for advice. It’s ludicrously funny in places, especially when he reports back to Margo, telling her one lie after another.\n\nThe story ends with Mike musing on his need to get over Lucy — “the love of my life” — and to let time work its magic.\n\nUnreciprocated love also features In Love with Ariadne, but this story is bittersweet rather than farcical. Barney, a medical student residing in a Dún Laoghaire boarding house, falls in love with the landlady’s daughter — but nothing comes of the relationship.\n\nForbidden love\n\nTrevor turns his focus to illicit love between a married man and a much younger woman in Lovers of Their Time. The affair between Norman, a travel agent, and Marie, who is a shop assistant in a pharmacy, begins tentatively on New Year’s Day in 1963.\n\nFor the first 12 months, it’s a largely chaste relationship because they have nowhere private to go until Norman discovers a hotel where they can consummate their relationship.\n\nMarriage and the prospect of children beckons, but ever-practical Norman is aware that getting a divorce from his wife Hilda will likely drive him into poverty: is his illicit love for Marie worth it?\n\nThis is a beautiful, largely melancholic story, but Trevor upends traditional stereotypes by making Hilda, the cheated-upon wife, as painfully uncouth. She’s lusty and “demanding in the bedroom” and makes Norman feel inadequate and unhappy, while Marie, whom he initially suspects may have a “tartish disposition”, turns out to be “prim and proper” and a genuinely lovely person who thinks highly of him.\n\nTheir love affair, gentle, romantic and sweet, offers the prospect of happiness for both of them.\n\n“Oh darling,” she whispered one October evening at Paddington, huddling herself against him. […]\n\n“I know,” he said, feeling as inadequate as he always did at the station.\n\n“I lie awake and think of you,” she whispered.\n\n“You’ve made me live,” he whispered back.\n\n“And you me. Oh, God, and you me.”\n\nMarriage of convenience\n\nIn the titular story, Bodily Secrets, a wealthy widow, 59-year-old Norah O’Neill, contemplates remarrying to have a “companion for her advancing years”. Her choice is limited, but the town’s affirmed bachelor Agnew, who is 51, seems the best fit — although her adult children and most of the townfolk think otherwise.\n\nAgnew is a dapper dresser, a good dancer and has been a loyal employee: for 17 years he managed the family’s toy factory until Mrs O’Neill’s son, the angry and opinionated Cathal, shut it down. The only blot on his character (apart from his Protestant religion) is his frequent weekenders to Dublin, where it is thought he sleeps around with women or goes drinking.\n\nMrs O’Neill, a handsome woman, despises her ageing body and is not seeking a sexual partner. Her marriage to Agnew is ideal. Not only do they have separate bedrooms, but she also gets the emotional support she craves, along with a man who can manage the apple orchard she wants to establish on the site of the closed factory. While Agnew gets the financial security he needs, along with a cover for his homosexuality (the “bodily secret” of the title).\n\nA similar “marriage of convenience” occurs in Honeymoon in Tramore in which a farm labourer, Davy Toome, marries Kitty, the farmer’s daughter, when she falls pregnant to someone else. It’s 1948 and pregnancy out of wedlock is viewed as a sin, so a hurried marriage is arranged. The real father, who is revealed at the end of the story, comes as something of a blow to Davy who had been told it was someone else entirely.\n\nAs ever, Trevor’s stories are compelling and expertly crafted and full of memorable characters and incidents. Each one looks at how love — in all its many various forms — profoundly shapes, challenges and transforms the men in these vastly different stories, all set in different periods and locations.\n\nThese poignant tales also showcase the complexities and vulnerabilities of human relationships, which is why reading them is such a wonderfully intimate and rewarding experience.\n\nAnd that’s a wrap!

I have previously reviewed this collection here.\n\n^^ Other books in this series which I have reviewed here are:\n\n‘A Mere Interlude’ by Thomas Hardy\n\n‘Something Childish But Very Natural’ by Katherine Mansfield\n\n‘Eros Unbound’ by Anais Nin\n\n‘First Love’ by Ivan Turgenev\n\nFiction – paperback; Vintage Classics; 208 pages; 2004.\n\nWho doesn’t love a Graham Greene novel?\n\nThe Quiet American, first published in 1955, is regarded as his political masterpiece. Much has been written about it, so I’m reluctant to rehash what everyone already knows. But I want to point out how effortless it is to read and how much I enjoyed the way it shows how individual decisions and actions can play out across a larger political canvas.\n\nIt’s one of those rare literary novels where the importance of character and the importance of plot are given almost equal weight. The plot, which seems straightforward, is anything but: it’s layered with deception and betrayal. Which is how you could also describe the morally flawed characters at its core.\n\nSaigon friendship\n\nSet in the 1950s, against the backdrop of the French Indochina war, The Quiet American tells the story of a jaded English journalist, Thomas Fowler, and a much younger idealistic American undercover agent, Alden Pyle, who befriend each other in Saigon. The narrative centres on their entangled relationship with Phuong, an 18-year-old Vietnamese woman, who is Fowler’s live-in lover and Pyle’s intended bride.\n\nThe story, said to be based on Greene’s own experiences, explores American foreign policy and the consequences of interventionism which played such a pivotal role in the ensuing Vietnam War.\n\nWorldly-wise 50-something Fowler, who narrates the story in a detached and cynical voice, serves as a foil to Pyle’s youth and naive optimism. He is not immediately likeable and is a liar, but he has a keen understanding of the political machinations involved in war and is interested in what makes people tick, all good qualities for a war correspondent.\n\nI was a correspondent: I thought in headlines. ‘American official murdered in Saigon.’ (p10)\n\nPyle, on the other hand, is idealistic, opportunistic and the titular “quiet American”. He believes the answer to Vietnam’s power struggle lies in a political concept known as the “Third Force”, a neutral position that is neither aligned with the communist North Vietnamese nor the anti-communist South Vietnamese.\n\nFowler does not agree with this idea. But while the pair possess conflicting worldviews, they get along, socialise with one another and, at one point, Pyle is credited with saving Fowler’s life.\n\nYet Pyle is competing for the same woman’s love. He goes out of his way to track Fowler down in the field so that he can confess that he loves Phuong and wants to take her back to the US to marry her. It is perhaps reflective of the times and attitudes that Phuong’s wishes never come into it.\n\nUnembellished writing\n\nAs ever, Greene’s writing is clear and concise. Using just a few carefully chosen words, he paints vivid pictures:\n\nThe canal was full of bodies: I am reminded now of an Irish stew containing too much meat. (page 38)\n\nSimilarly, he evokes unsentimental portrayals of people and understands their weaknesses and foibles:\n\nWhere other men carry their pride like a skin-disease on the surface, sensitive to the least touch, his pride was deeply hidden, and reduced to the smallest proportion possible, I think, for any human being. (p100)\n\nThroughout, the tone of voice is detached and the characters are carefully crafted. The non-chronological narrative zips along and can be enjoyed for its own sake, but scratch deeper and there is so much going on.\n\nNot only is The Quiet American about the human cost of war, but it raises pertinent questions about personal morality, religion, foreign intervention and colonialism.\n\nIt has been filmed twice — in 1958 and 2002 — adapted for radio, and named on the BBC’s list of 100 most inspiring novels.\n\n‘The Quiet American’, by Graham Greene, first published in 1955, is listed in Peter Boxall’s 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, where it is described as an “allegory for the end of paternalistic European colonialism in Indochina and the beginning of zealous American imperialism”. It adds that the novel “expands from this central allegory to offer a study of masculinity and responsibility”."
