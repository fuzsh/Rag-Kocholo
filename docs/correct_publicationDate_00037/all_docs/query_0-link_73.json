        "text": "“So you’re a private detective? I didn’t know they existed, except in books — or else they were greasy little men snooping around hotel corridors.”\n\n— Bacall to Bogart in The Big Sleep\n\nA NOTE TO READERS\n\nFor the first ten or so years of its existence, The Thrilling Detective Web Site published online fiction, mostly original short stories, plus an occasional excerpt or classic reprint. In that time, we were lucky enough to put out some really good stuff, give some exposure to some up-and-coming writers, and even win a few awards. I couldn’t have done it without the dogged determination of long-time fiction editor Gerald So and my original co-editor Victoria Esposito, and so I want to thank them once again for all their hard work and support over the years. As I said, I could have never done it alone. And I didn’t.\n\nAnd now, perhaps against my better judgement, after another ten years (or so), I’m thinking of starting it all over again.\n\nMaybe.\n\nSo much has changed in publishing since those first ten (or so) years, and editors are increasingly viewed by some of the ego-bloated self-pub and KU brigade as somewhere between an unnecessary evil and dog shit, but a good story is still a good story — and deserves to treated as such, not rushed to publication to meet some cyber-quota, or because some “writer” or “publisher” is too lazy to put out the best story they can.\n\nSo please, if you don’t want to be edited, don’t start sending me your stories.\n\nA few comments or suggestions would be nice, though, so I know what I might be getting myself into. And so far, nobody’s responded in any significant way.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s still plenty more fiction to check out. Feel free to stroll down the mean streets of our archives…\n\nTHE THRILLING DETECTIVE FICTION ARCHIVES\n\nSeptember 1998\n\nZen and the Art of Murder by E.M.
