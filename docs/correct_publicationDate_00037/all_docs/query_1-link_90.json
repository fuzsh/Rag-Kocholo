Within these pages, you'll find whispers of the familiar ghosts of the classic pulps--Lovecraft, Bradbury, Smith--blended with author Grau's uniquely macabre, witty storytelling, securing his place at the table amid this current Renaissance of literary horror. A finalist for the Shirley Jackson Award for Best Single-Author Collection!\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"The dark fiction in Grau's first collection is nicely twisted, with stories that play on the best of eldritch horror, creating a sense of dread and the unexplained instead of overt malevolence.\" - Publishers Weekly \"Major new voices don't come along often. This is one. Read it.\" - Michael Marshall Smith, author of Intruders and The Straw Men ''What's most impressive about T. E. Grau's stunning debut collection is the range of his settings and histories, and of the desperate and authentic voices of his doomed characters. The cumulative effect of these smart, evocative, unsettling creepers is a sense of dread as deep as the secret ocean underneath Nebraska.'' - Paul Tremblay, author of A Head Full of Ghosts ''Each story is written with a clear love for language, the prose evocative, heartfelt, and often heartbreaking, providing observations of human nature that are wickedly astute and well considered. The stars must have been right when he wrote this because Grau has created magic here, magic of a very dark kind.'' - Ray Cluley, author of Probably Monsters"
