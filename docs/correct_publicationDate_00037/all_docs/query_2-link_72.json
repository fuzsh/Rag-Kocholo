William Least Heat Moon, born William Trogden, is a writer known for books about his travels across America such as Blue Highways. This passage is from Blue Highways and describes his visit to Nameless, Tennessee, a small community of around 90 people. He meets Thurmond Watts and his family, who own the local general store, and they tell him the story of how the town got its unusual name after the residents couldn't agree on a name and decided to leave it unnamed. Watts and his wife Virginia show hospitality to the traveler, sharing food and old phonograph music with him before he continues on his journey.",
