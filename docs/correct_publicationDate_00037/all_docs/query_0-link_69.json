        "text": "It’s that time again, and today we welcome Mr. N and Mrs. N., the husband-wife writing team otherwise known as N.N. Light. This is the last day to buy Princess of the Light for $0.99 and N.N. is generously donating all March/April proceeds to food banks in the U.S. and Canada. Click on the link below!\n\nMary Miller receives a startling visitation from Gabriel, the Messenger of God. The Archangel reveals an astounding truth–Mary is the Princess of the Light and even more amazing, her destiny is to battle Lucifer’s army of demons and restore the balance of good and evil on Earth. It’s getting harder to fulfill her new role and keep her identity secret while juggling her personal life, and when Than, Lucifer’s second in command, amps up the attacks on her, she knows she needs help.\n\nJoe Deacons is everything she’s ever wanted in a man. And as providence would have it, in a moment of great need, he’s the Warrior of Light–the one who can help her defeat the forces of darkness.\n\nNot so simple when they confront Lisbeth, a demon hell-bent on usurping Than and Lucifer himself. When Lisbeth wages war and several innocent people die, Mary must form an alliance with her enemy in order to destroy her. But will this be a grave error or the choice that saves their world?\n\nThank you, Teri, for inviting us here today. We’re so honoured and excited.\n\nWhat’s the most constructive criticism you’ve been given in your writing career?\n\nMr. N – “You’ve got to add conflict to your main characters. No one’s going to believe the story if your couple falls in love and there’s no conflict.”\n\nI write from my own personal experience and since my beloved wife and I don’t argue or get into conflicting fights, I find it difficult to write angst-ridden characters. But after that comment, I looked around at our friends (and their relationships) in order to capture conflicted partners and added that element to my writing. Readers seem to like our stories after I made that adjustment.\n\nMrs. N – “You tend to describe every little action, like you’re writing a screenplay. This is a book, not a movie. Ease back on that and show what’s going on through dialogue and setting.”\n\nThis was such a great piece of advice for me because when I went back and re-read my scenes, I discovered my weakness. In an effort to describe accurately for the reader what was going on, I was pulling them out of the lull of the story. I worked hard on it and it’s a continual process but the advice was a turning point for me.\n\nWhat do you wish you’d known before you were published?\n\nMr. N – It’s better to take things slow than to rush. We made some mistakes on our first publication but thankfully, learned our lessons. Patience and taking it slow is better than throwing up a product without a marketing plan.\n\nMrs. N – I was under the assumption that I needed to be published by a Big 5 publisher in order to sell books. But in today’s publishing market, indie authors hold the reins and can create the same high-quality product as the Big 5 without sacrificing anything. If I had known that, I never would’ve wasted all that time in 2014.\n\nWhat character in your book are you least likely to get along with?\n\nMr. N – In Princess of the Light, I would probably say The Walking Man’s ex-wife. She’s a piece of work and I detest her.\n\nMrs. N – Going with Princess of the Light, I’d say Lisbeth. She’s the sexy demon hell-bent on destroying everything (exchanges looks with Mr. N) and everyone Mary loves. She’s pure evil and her motives … I find it hard to relate to her.\n\nWhat’s your favorite kind of cookie and why?\n\nMr. N – My wife makes the most delicious chocolate chip cookies. I love it when she bakes them and I don’t share with anyone.\n\nMrs. N – (laughs) Not that you’re biased or anything.\n\nMr. N – Who me? (winks and grabs Mrs. N’s hand)\n\nMrs. N – I love Oreo cookies and I have always loved to dunk them in milk. Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, I can eat them every day of the year.\n\nWhat’s the last thing you watched on TV/Netflix?\n\nMr. N – Path to the Draft on the NFL Network. We’re big NFL fans and watch this show every day. For those who don’t know, the NFL Draft is coming up and this show details everything you need to know for the draft.\n\nMrs. N – Death in Paradise on BBC Canada. We’ve been watching this show for three years and love it. Although, it appears DI Goodman may be leaving the show. We’ll have to wait and see who the new DI will be. It’s a British mystery show about a British Detective Inspector working/living in the Caribbean and solving mysteries. The cast works well together and the setting is gorgeous.\n\nBook you’d want with you if you were stranded on a desert island?\n\nMr. N – You mean, besides our own? (laughs) If I only had to pick one, I’d pick Why Time Begins on Opening Day by Thomas Boswell. I read it every year and it’s a fantastic book all about baseball.\n\nMrs. N – I can only pick one? Gee, that’s hard. I’m such a book addict and I have quite a collection on both my tablet and on bookshelves. Well, I guess I’d choose A Knight in Shining Armor by Jude Deveraux. I read it a few times a year and it’s my favorite time-travel romance.\n\nAuthor Bio: N. N. Light is the husband-wife writing team, commonly known as Mr. N and Mrs. N. Mrs. N. has been creating stories ever since she was little. Her grandfather remembers when she was two years old, she would stand at the top of the stairs and tell him a story filled with emotion (and in a language foreign to him) with her hands on her hips. Let’s just say she was a born storyteller.\n\nThey’re blissfully happy and love all things chocolate, books, music, movies, art, sports, trains, history, cooking and baking. Their mantra is to spread the Light.\n\nMost of the time you can find them on Twitter or getting new ideas on how to spread the Light on Pinterest. They’re a proud member of ASMSG and Independent Author Network.\n\nSign up for their author newsletter and get a free e-book ow.ly/jWec308TabL\n\nIn addition to being authors, they’re also book promoters/reviewers, social media marketers/influencers and the owners of N. N. Light Author Promotions. They both love books, have ever since they were young. Matching up books and readers is something that gives them great pleasure.\n\n100% of the March/April proceeds of Princess of the Light go directly to food banks (US and Canada) in order to feed the hungry and help those in need. With only 7,500 books sold, N. N. Light will be able to set up a monthly endowment for the local food bank.\n\nBuy Links:\n\nFriday (3/31) is the last day to 1-click for only 99 cents!\n\nFree on Kindle Unlimited\n\nAmazon.com: http://www.amazon.com/Princess-Light-N/dp/1502438453\n\nAmazon Canada: http://www.amazon.ca/Princess-Light-N-ebook/dp/B00N19FDKO\n\nAmazon UK: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Princess-Light-N-ebook/dp/B00N19FDKO\n\nSocial Media:\n\nThey’d love to connect with you either via email or via these various social media sites:\n\nWebsite: http://princessofthelight.com\n\nBlog: http://princessofthelight.wordpress.com\n\nGoodreads: http://www.goodreads.com/nnlight\n\nBookbub https://www.bookbub.com/authors/n-n-light\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/NNP_W_Light\n\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/nnlight\n\nLinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/n-n-light/90/1a7/902\n\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/u/0/118060034268079734144/posts\n\nAmazon Author Page: https://www.amazon.com/author/nnlight\n\nIndependent Author Network: http://www.independentauthornetwork.com/n-n-light.html\n\niAuthor: http://www.iauthor.uk.com/princess-of-the-light:10294\n\nIt’s Friday!!! And I’m so happy to have my friend, John W. Howell, here for Indie Author Friday. His blog keeps me entertained daily with writerly things, views of his neighborhood, and weekly stories, and his thriller/suspense series with unlikely hero John J. Cannon is not only compelling, it can kick up the heart rate a few notches. I have to mention his penguin wearing the sombrero question has one of the best answers I’ve seen yet.\n\nThe John Cannon Trilogy begins in Port Aransas where San Francisco lawyer John J. Cannon decided to go after taking a live of absence form his firm. He bought a boat he named My GRL with the idea of giving the charter boat business a try. He was unaware that a group of terrorists already targeted his boat to be used on a mission to destroy a symbol of America. He woke up in the hospital to learn he was found unconscious next to the body of the woman who sold him the boat and to further complicate things he was laying on the gun that killed her. This is the beginning of John’s involvement with the terrorists and continues through the three books with each episode more exciting than the last. John finally comes to realize that he is the only one that can put an end to the mayhem but he must do it alone. Each book is a separate story but the characters remain the same.\n\nWhat’s the most constructive criticism you’ve been given in your writing career?\n\nWhen I decided to become a writer I took a class that among other famous authors was taught by Elmore Leonard. During the course of the instruction you were given time to meet one on one with one of the authors and talk about your work. My author who will remain nameless loved my work but was very critical of the dialog tags which I included as part of the descriptions. You know, the old “he said over his shoulder while turning to walk out the door.” This author pretty much told me to drop that crap and keep tags to a minimum. “He said, she said” were the ones to use if the speaker was not clear to the reader. I have since dedicated two days a week to dialog on my blog that has no tags at all. I do this to attempt to tell a story with only dialog.\n\nWhat do you wish you’d known before you were published?\n\nI wish I had known that even though you have a publisher, the work of editing your manuscript should be given to a qualified professional. I was so happy to get a contract with a publisher since it looked like I would not have to pay for editorial, formatting, or other production expenses. Unfortunately, the editor did not take the time to review changes that were made after the first edit and so a number of mistakes made it into the final. It took over six months to get the mistakes corrected since I did not have the ability to do the corrections myself.\n\nWhat is something memorable you’ve heard from your readers/fans?\n\nI received a note from an older lady who had read my first book. She explained that my book gave her many hours of pleasure and thanked me for writing it. It so happened I was at a book signing and the lady’s daughter who had given her the book came in and handed me the note. She explained that her mother was not well and she found my book a pleasant distraction from her problems. She had the book with her and asked that I inscribe it. I read the note and my eyes filled with tears. I was so taken with the fact that my words gave a person a break from their challenges the thought almost overwhelmed me. I wrote a thank you for blessing me with her words and the wish for happiness. I also said she had a pretty terrific daughter.\n\nWhat’s the last thing you watched on TV/Netflix?\n\nMy wife an I watch an hour of TV a day. After dinner and after some reading or e-mail time we sit and scroll through the DVR list. We record all our favorite shows so we can fast forward through the commercials. This leaves us about fifteen minutes for local news and weather. The last show we saw as of this writing was Blindspot. It could have been NCIS, The Blacklist, NCIS LA, This Is Us, Criminal Minds, Bull, Fixer Upper, Chopped, The Middle, Modern Family, Grey’s Anatomy, Bones or the Property Brothers.\n\nA penguin walks through the door wearing a sombrero. What does he say and why is he here?\n\n“Excuse me Senior. Do you know the way to San Jose?” He is here asking directions so that he can make his way back to the South Pole. Apparently, he lost his job in Washington when the new administration declared that all residents of the South Pole needed to go back to their homeland and apply for a proper visa. The only other city that he knew in the US besides Washington was San Jose since he was a big fan of Dionne Warrick. He figured San Jose was near Los Angles which was close to Mexico and would get him on the underground express to South America. Once there he planned to work his way to the North Pole on a boat. He thought he could convince the boat captain that if put in charge of procuring fish the crew would never go hungry. All this was explained after the one question, “why the sombrero?”\n\nBook you’d want with you if you were stranded on a desert island?\n\nI think I would want a book titled something like “How to Survive on a Desert Island.” Failing the availability of that title I guess I would have to opt for a big fat ole book that I could read and reread without getting bored. Canterbury Tales comes to mind. (Might even take an eternity to understand it)\n\nBio\n\nJohn began his writing as a full-time occupation after an extensive business career. His specialty is thriller fiction novels, but John also writes poetry and short stories. His first book, My GRL, introduces the exciting adventures of the book’s central character, John J. Cannon. The second Cannon novel, His Revenge, continues the adventure, while the final book in the trilogy, Our Justice, launched in September 2016. All books are available on Amazon in paperback and Kindle editions. John lives in Port Aransas, Texas with his wife and their spoiled rescue pets.\n\nSocial Media\n\nBlog – Fiction Favorites http://johnwhowell.com/\n\nFacebook – https://www.facebook.com/john.howell.98229241\n\nTwitter –https://www.twitter.com/HowellWave\n\nAuthors db –http://www.authorsdb.com/authors-directory/6604-john-w-howell\n\nLinkedIn –http://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-w-howell/48/b59/462/\n\nGoogle +https://plus.google.com/+JohnHowellAuthor/\n\nGoodreads – https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7751796.John_W_Howell?from_search=true\n\nPurchase link –https://www.amazon.com/author/johnwhowell\n\nAlthough I haven’t read either of these novels (yet), I just finished the first book in Staci’s Cathedral Lake series a couple of weeks ago, and can tell you that if romantic suspense is your thing – you need to be reading her books. And she gets bonus points for being into superheroes.\n\nIn the heart of Pittsburgh awaits a secret half a millennium in the making.\n\nAfter her father’s brutal murder, Franki discovers she and her three sisters are the only surviving, secret legacy of the Medici. The same people who brutally murdered her father now target her and her family for assassination. Unprepared to battle an unknown enemy, she finds her safety depends on the Medici Protectorate, the warriors who guarded her bloodline for centuries, but who failed to protect her father.\n\nGianni, Franki’s protector, blows his first meeting with her, but knows he must garner the trust of not only Franki, but also her sisters. Without that, he fails too, and that is unacceptable—not only to him but also to the Medici Protectorate. His troubles grow larger, for as he assumes his new role, he also undergoes inexplicable, explosive physical changes… transformations he can’t control. One of those is his uncontainable desire for Franki.\n\nTheir worlds collide in passion and violence, and Franki struggles to trust Gianni. When her life is on the line, Gianni will have to conquer both her fears and his own personal demons to rescue her in time.\n\nBleeding Heart Universal Purchase Link: https://books2read.com/STbleedingheart\n\nThree decades. Two continents. One secret that could cost him everything.\n\nToo. Many. Secrets… and Vinnie Falco is buried in them. He works undercover day and night to keep watch over Jo Notaro, whose fiery temperament matches her boundless energy and unparalleled beauty. Jo is unable to withstand the endless scrutiny and constant surveillance, so when Vinnie’s ever-watchful gaze lingers too long, she can feel his touch—and she doesn’t know if she loathes it or loves it.\n\nVinnie’s job to watch Jo goes much deeper. He’s a vice president of an international corporation, a front for a secret organization—the Medici Protectorate—which continues a tradition going back nearly 500 years to guard the Medici line. Jo and her sisters are the descendants of the Medici and someone wants them dead. But Vinnie has another secret he’s desperately trying to hide. A secret that could push Jo too far away for even him to save her.\n\nMind Control Universal Purchase Link: https://books2read.com/STmindcontrol\n\nWhat are your favorite books in your genre?\n\nI write in multiple genres, but I always seem to prefer a romantic element, so I’ll go with romance and say my favorite books are anything by Nora Roberts, Catherine Anderson, and J.R. Ward.\n\nWhat character in your book are you least likely to get along with?\n\nIf we’re talking about Mind Control (or any novel in the Medici Protectorate series), I’m going to have to go with Mike. It’s not because he’s the villain; he’s one of the good guys. It’s because he’s so rigid and formal. He also comes off as superior, whether he truly believes that or not is anyone’s guess, though. And he’s distant. I’m a very emotionally-driven person. I thrive on close relationships, and I have trouble trusting people who are closed off or who keep their distance. So, I’d say Mike and I would clash. Or at the very least, we’d have a strained and distant relationship.\n\nWhat is something memorable you’ve heard from your readers/fans?\n\nI know they say you shouldn’t read your reviews because you’ll get caught up on every word and agonize over every nuance. But I can’t help it. I read the reviews I get. I’ve heard a lot of lovely things about my writing, and I treasure those comments (and always will). But the comments that mean the most to me are from fans who say they loved the work so much, they’re eagerly awaiting the next release or the people who say they read a sample chapter and liked it so much they downloaded the whole book and read it cover to cover in under twenty-four hours. Those are the people I know I’ve touched in some way, and that warms my heart.\n\nWhat’s the last thing you watched on TV/Netflix?\n\nThe Flash. I’m addicted to superheroes right now.\n\nWho would win a fight between Spiderman and Batman?\n\nHas to be Batman. I’m sure he has a Bat-Gadget in his utility belt that can counteract spider webs.\n\nIf you were an animated character, who would you be and why?\n\nBelle, from Beauty and the Beast. I know she’s not a superhero, but she and I both love to read. Besides, I have to give it up to a heroine who can see past appearances to what’s inside a person. Vision like that is pretty heroic.\n\nBio\n\nStaci Troilo has always loved fiction, ever since her parents read her fairy tales when she was a young girl. Today, her interests are much more eclectic. She loves getting lost in sci-fi battles, fantasy realms, horror worlds, suspenseful intrigues, and romantic entanglements.\n\nAs goes her reading, so goes her writing. She can’t pick a single genre to focus on, so she doesn’t even try. She’s proud to say she’s a multi-genre author.\n\nWhen she’s not reading or writing, she’s spending time with family and friends, possibly cooking for them, or maybe enjoying an afternoon in the pool.

She’s never even met her new guardians, the Rochesters—an old money family who relish being pillars of high society. Janie feels hopelessly out of place in their world of Napa weekends, fancy prep schools, and cotillions. Nicholas is the only Rochester who treats her with anything resembling kindness—but he’s only six. When she strikes up a friendship with Daniel, a fellow surfer, it feels like things might finally be improving.\n\nBut something isn’t right in the Rochester mansion. There are noises—screams—coming from the attic nearly every night. Noises everyone else claims they can’t hear. Then John, the black sheep of the family, returns after getting kicked out of yet another boarding school. Soon Janie finds herself torn between this new “brother” and Daniel, who has secrets of his own. Just when she thinks her life can’t get any worse, she learns the truth about the Rochesters: what they’re hiding, what they want from Janie, and how far they’ll go to get it. – Goodreads.com\n\nI read Jane Eyre many years ago and honestly didn’t remember much about it, so I had to reacquaint myself with the synopsis. Unearthly Things is an updated YA retelling of Jane Eyre and the author has done a remarkable job.\n\nOrphaned at the age of 16, Janie had an idyllic upbringing that wasn’t without its problems, but she’s strong and tries to make the best of a tragic situation, making her character easy to admire. Even though this is a modern day retelling, I loved that the Rochester’s house still maintained the creepy gothic atmosphere, complete with supernatural happenings. I also liked that the primary emphasis wasn’t on romance, but more about the strange occurrences and secrets in the house, odd behaviors of its inhabitants, and Janie’s attempts to figure out the motivations of everyone around her.\n\nThis Jane is a down-to-earth, intelligent, strong surfer girl and I thoroughly enjoyed this book – and could easily have read it in one sitting if real life hadn’t required my attention. Fans of the original Jane Eyre may enjoy this updated YA version, but I’d also recommend it to those who enjoy supernatural suspense. Unearthly Things is scheduled for publication April 11th, 2017.\n\nThanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for the digital ARC."
