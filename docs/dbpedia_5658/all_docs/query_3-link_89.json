        "text": "Anticipation for President Joe Biden’s press conference on Thursday night was sky high as he faced a growing mutiny from within the Democratic Party following his poor performance at the first presidential debate. By the time the press conference began, 14 House and Senate Democrats had already called for him to step aside, with more anticipated, Jewish Insider’s senior national correspondent Gabby Deutch reports.\n\nFor nearly an hour, Biden fielded questions from reporters on NATO, Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war and — of course — his fitness to serve a second term in office and his ability to defeat former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Biden onstage last night was who Democrats had hoped to see at the debate: occasionally rambling, sometimes bungling names, but generally cogent and forceful. He spoke in detail about defense policy and the economy, rattling off facts and figures of his administration’s accomplishments. And he pledged to stay in the race.\n\n“I’m in this to complete the job I started,” Biden said, making clear that he is ignoring the pleas of a growing number of Democrats for him to step aside. He cast doubt on a slew of recent polls showing him losing to Trump while also saying polls don’t matter, because the race doesn’t start “in earnest” until after Labor Day.\n\n“A lot can happen. But I think I’m the best call. I believe I’m the best qualified to govern, and I think I’m the best qualified to win,” he said.\n\nAt one point, the president quipped that his “numbers in Israel are better than they are here,” a reference to recent polling that shows him lagging behind former President Donald Trump in several critical states.\n\nIn response to a question about his handling of the war in Gaza, Biden criticized Israel’s leadership, urged the country to accept a cease-fire deal and noted that Israel can still pursue Hamas’ leaders even after the war ends.\n\n“There’s a lot of things in retrospect I wish I had been able to convince Israelisto do, but the bottom line is we have a chance now. It’s time to end this war. That doesn’t mean walk away from going after [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar and Hamas,” Biden said. “I support Israel. But this war cabinet is one of the most conservative war cabinets in the history of Israel. And there’s no ultimate answer other than a two-state solution here.”\n\nAt one point, Biden claimed that Hamas faced “growing dissatisfaction” in the West Bank. But recent polling from the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research indicates that support for Hamas among West Bank Palestinians is on the upswing — and that the terror group is actually viewed more positively in the West Bank than in Gaza.\n\nAfter Biden wrapped up the press conference, reporters started shouting questions, and he took a final one: Would he reconsider his decision to stay in the race?\n\n“No, unless they came back and said, there’s no way you can win,” Biden said, adding in a whisper: “No one’s saying that. No poll’s saying that.”\n\nBut even as Biden’s performance quieted some of his critics, another trickle of House Democrats — including House Intelligence Committee ranking member Jim Himes (D-CT) — called on him to step aside. The end result is Biden pressing ahead with his reelection, his party divided and no clear end to the stalemate. The fight for the soul of the Democratic Party grinds on.\n\nAs former President Donald Trump finalizes his choice for a running mate, allies of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a top contender for the vice presidential slot, have argued that he would be a valuable addition to the ticket, citing his appeal to Latino voters, his ties to key donors and his foreign policy chops, among other draws. But Rubio’s rise has also raised concerns among traditional GOP hawks and conservative pro-Israel foreign policy experts who once viewed the Cuban American senator as one of the strongest defenders of a muscular approach to international engagement that has struggled to compete with the ascendant populism dominating the party, Jewish Insider’s Matthew Kassel reports.\n\n‘Trumpier’ turn: Now, some of his critics say, Rubio’s conversion from an erstwhile Trump critic to a MAGA ally has cast doubt on the sincerity of his commitment to the hawkish foreign policy vision he had long espoused, most notably as a presidential candidate in 2016, when was highly critical of Trump’s America First platform. Rubio, now 53, “was very much in the McCain and McConnell internationalist camp as a candidate for president in 2016,” one prominent former supporter who has served in Republican administrations told JI earlier this week, referring to the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). “The switch to a Trumpier line seems motivated partly by Trump’s influence on the party, and in that sense Rubio may be moving closer to the average Republican voter.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nThe Ayatollah’s Anxiety: In The Atlantic, Arash Azizi considers Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s rationale for allowing Masoud Pezeshkian, the least extreme of the presidential candidates, to stand for election; Pezeshkian won a runoff last week to succeed President Ebrahim Raisi. “Khamenei has to be aware that the societal base for his regime is only shrinking. The mix of political repression and economic failure has proved unsurprisingly unpopular. A majority of Iranians refused to vote not only in this election but also in the three elections before it, starting in 2020. Even the reformists joined an official boycott this year, something normally more the province of young radicals and abroad-based opposition. … Raisi’s death in a strange helicopter crash on May 19 provided the opening for Khamenei to recalibrate his relationship with the reformists and centrists. Pezeshkian was disqualified from running for president in 2021. Earlier this year, he was denied even a parliamentary run; Khamenei then personally intervened to allow him to enter and win the race for the Tabriz seat he has held since 2008. For this presidential election, he was the only one of three reformist candidates to be approved.” [TheAtlantic]\n\nDon’t Forget Women Hostages: In Time, Israeli First Lady Michal Herzog calls for renewed attention to the plight of the female hostages still being held in Gaza. “The medieval brutality of the Hamas invasion into Israel on Oct. 7, widely documented, indeed seems to belong to a different era. But it hits notes of fear and terror that are so primal, so visceral, so chillingly familiar to us women. Millennia of vulnerability have been encoded in our bodies. We can conjure in our imaginations the darkest images of women captured in war, paraded through the streets as trophies, kept in cages, subject to every whim of their captors. It is a reality in which the darkest and most brutal of human impulses are laid bare. There is no moderating or civilizing force. This should alarm every single one of us. The significance of this particular brand of violence against women, of the reported ongoing crimes against the female hostages in Gaza, is that the rule of law, so carefully put in place over centuries of progress, is being actively disregarded and defiled.” [Time]\n\nNotes on the North: In The Times of Israel, former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren, previously a member of Knesset, argues that Israel needs to take a harder stance against Hezbollah as the Iran-backed terror group continues to attack Israel’s north. “Israel is losing the north, but the loss will not be of land alone. Endangered, too, is the state’s commitment to defend all of our citizens irrespective of their place of residence, to preserve our precious human and natural resources, and to deter our enemies. Nor will that fate be confined to the north but, along with Hezbollah’s southward-creeping rocket fire, it will eventually afflict the center. A new northern border running from Haifa to Kfar Saba is not unimaginable, or even from Ra’anana to Netanya.” [TOI]\n\nSee You in Court, Columbia: In The Wall Street Journal, Michael Gross, a doctoral student at Columbia University, explains his decision to file a lawsuit against his university over its handling of antisemitism. “When I met with the nursing school’s dean of student affairs after Thanksgiving, she questioned whether other Jews who had raised concerns were actually students. She defended the students harassing Jews on the grounds of ‘free speech.’ In the spring, another dean dismissed my concerns of antisemitism as a nonissue and said I was describing a ‘lack of civility’ but not antisemitism. No wonder the situation at Columbia has deteriorated. Passive and morally confused leaders have tacitly encouraged the threats of violence against Jewish students. By failing to oppose antisemitism from the outset, they’ve fostered the creation of a de facto no-go zone for Jews. The 2023-24 school year is over, but antisemitism remains rampant in the summer semester, and I expect it to become worse in the fall. If students are setting up encampments when the campus is less busy, they are unlikely to back down when it is bustling.” [WSJ]\n\nSen.
