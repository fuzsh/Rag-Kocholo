        "text": "As Teapot Trust is a ‚ÄúDisability Confident‚Äù charity, we‚Äôre drawing attention to actor Liz Carr‚Äôs piece in today‚Äôs Guardian (I‚Äôm fighting for the right to live) ahead of tonight‚Äôs BBC One documentary, Better off Dead? which takes a deep dive into disability and assisted dying. Carr believes the two can‚Äôt be separated. Carr looks back at her childhood and the impact of having a rare auto-immune condition. ‚ÄúOur perception of disability is that it‚Äôs the greater tragedy to befall you‚Äù, she says. But maybe it‚Äôs society's attitudes that need to change. She continues, ‚ÄúI went on a course that introduced me to the social model of disability. It showed me that it‚Äôs the attitudes, environments and systems around you that are usually more disabling than your condition.\" Carr has wanted to make tonight‚Äôs programme for years. In 2011, after the documentary, Terry Pratchett: Choosing the Die, she wrote to the BBC to say that it had a duty to present the alternative view. Carr says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so incensed that there is never any balance on this topic.‚Äù For Carr, the issue became urgent after the case of Daniel James in 2008. He had been paralysed during rugby training and died in a clinic in Switzerland, aged 23. ‚ÄúHe died 18 months after becoming disabled. Not terminally ill ‚Äì just disabled. But the press and public reaction was: ‚ÄòOf course it‚Äôs the right thing to do‚Äô. A disabled young man wants to end his life and we don‚Äôt question that? Nobody was asking, ‚ÄòHow can we change?‚Äô\" Watch the documentary, Better Off Dead? on BBC one tonight at 9pm. #disability #disabilityconfident #autoimmune #rareillness #socialmodelofdisability #assisteddying\n\nHow many charities who support people with Down syndrome, learning disabilities and autistic people came out to show their outrage to the brutal killing of Mohammed Bhar? Do you know why his only words were ‚ÄúEnough, my love, enough‚Äù? Because thats the environment he lived in, thats what he experienced. Gentleness and love. He was a non speaking autistic man with learning disabities and Downs Syndrome. He has also been displaced several times. He had a mental age of a toddler. The terrorist dogs unleashed trained attack dogs maul. Imagine the intensity of the pain and shock that the non speaking man came out with his first ever sentence, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough, my dear, that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù Autistic people with very limited speech echo what they hear. He wanted to be heard. He needed to be heard. He needed saved. Each day I am dismayed at how much more grotesque the torture becomes as time passes. Each time they don‚Äôt fail to disgust us and terrorise us all with their sick minded fun. This is an issue of disability justice. Race justice. Human rights justice. If we didn‚Äôt come together for this, then what is the point of us? Listen to his mother‚Äôs testimony (link in comments) and tell me you are ok with this. #DisabilityJustice #Autism #DownsSyndrome #LearningDisabilities #HumanRights\n\nWe‚Äôre so excited to invite you to our first ever online Rafiki Thabo film launch & panel discussion! Join us on the 11th March at 20:00 ‚Äì Free Event ‚Äì online With a focus on our work supporting children living with disabilities in Kenya, our film highlights the struggles of parents of children living with disability, the challenges and the reality the children face, the incredibly positive impact the therapy and treatment they now receive has on their life and how they can go on to further their future opportunities in life as Rafiki Thabo scholars. The film is introduced by our wonderful patrons Amar Latif and Harry Baker. We then invite you to engage with our wonderful and inspiring panellists, all of whom are passionate about enabling access to education for children with disabilities. They are very excited to take this opportunity to meet our supporters and answer your questions. Our panellists are looking forward to discussing the importance of education and in particular removing barriers for young people living with disabilities in Kenya, a country where, despite the government introducing some progressive disability inclusion policies many still stigmatise and ostracise people living with disabilities. This is your opportunity to get a better understanding of the work we do, the incredible impact our supporters enable us to have on the young lives of those we seek to empower and how, should you be inspired to, you can get involved! Find out more about our panellists, the film, and get your free ticket now.

Income maximisation has been key to supporting customers through the cost of living crisis with almost half of all its customers receiving a benefit and support calculation. As a result, Scope has helped one customer to claim an extra ¬£643 a month in the carers and disabled child element of Universal Credit that they hadn't realised they were eligible for. It is stories like this that emphasise just how important it is to run a benefits check even if you didn‚Äôt think you were eligible. Laura Canning, Contact Centre Manager, Scope says: üí¨ \"The Better Off Calculator remains our go to choice of calculator for supporting our customers with income maximisation. ‚ÄúOur advisers find it the easiest to use and it helps them clearly identify what support can be offered to our customers who may be struggling financially‚Äù To read more on Scope's success story see here: https://lnkd.in/eA-H2TCP üéÑ Come back Monday to see who is featured on Day 6!\n\n(edited: Although voting is now closed - thank you to everyone who voted for our film üòä - this film and all videos in The Friendship Project series are available to watch any time online: https://lnkd.in/gyAC2S2K.)
