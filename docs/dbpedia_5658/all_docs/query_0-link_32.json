        "text": "The first time Ann Harding’s face appeared on film was in the opening minutes of the 1929 film “Paris Bound.”\n\nShe’s a vision in white as a bride standing reverentially at her wedding altar next to her co-star, a baby-faced Fredric March. Her headpiece and veil tightly frame her face, with the veil wrapped around her forehead and hair, under her chin and across her neck.\n\nAnd there it is, captured in close-up and immortalized for us to see nearly 100 years later: the ethereal beauty of Ann Harding.\n\nEven as a long-time fan of the actress, I was unprepared for the grace and luminescence she exuded right from the opening moments of her film debut. I guess I thought she somehow crafted her otherworldliness throughout her career, as if it was something that could be learned. Ridiculous, I know. She was born with it.\n\nThat realization makes me laugh at myself because the first time I saw Ann Harding I was so caught off guard by her voice (and not in a good way) that I missed how the camera loved her. (Of course I adore her voice now.) Let me explain. It was not a full movie, but a preview for her 1929 romance “Condemned.” I distinctly remember the moment in that short preview that she growled out “I love him. I will always love him. I would die for him.” (“Him” was her co-star Ronald Colman and how can you not join her in proclaiming love for him?)\n\nIt was a deep and throaty voice, dripping with desperation. I didn’t know what to make of it. Well, I was in the minority.\n\nCritics and moviegoers who saw “Paris Bound” raved about Harding’s voice. Pathé studio took full advantage, promoting her as “the girl with the voice,” while ads for “Paris Bound” proclaimed “You’ll gasp at every word spoken!” Even dour New York Times critic Mordaunt Hall wrote that seeing Harding was a “joyous relief to study the work of an actress in a motion picture who is so modulated in her talking.”\n\n“Paris Bound” was the first in a winning trifecta that started Harding’s film career. Only a month later, in September 1929, “Her Private Affair” was released, followed in November by “Condemned.” These weren’t bit parts, mind you, she was the star. In fact, “Condemned” is the film that pushed her into stardom. (The next year, she would be Oscar-nominated for her role in “Holiday.”)\n\nThat’s three starring roles in three movies in three months: What a way to start a career.\n\nStardom bound\n\nBefore her successful transition to film in 1929, Harding was a popular stage actress in the early 1920s. By 1926, however, she was pushing herself to exhaustion, ignoring doctor’s orders to the point she even collapsed on stage. Taking forced time off, she relocated to San Bernardino, Calif. (she purposefully avoided Hollywood on the advice of friends). The slower pace was good for her, and she wasn’t in a hurry to return to acting, especially since she was a new mother.\n\nBut Hollywood couldn’t get enough of Broadway actors, luring people like Kay Francis, Joan Blondell, Leslie Howard and Clark Gable from the stage to the big screen. Harding was soon on its radar. (When Harding did make her screen debut, publicity for the film read: Ann Harding Broadway Favorite in “Paris Bound.”)\n\nOn a fateful day, former Broadway actor and Harding’s friend George Reicher took her on a studio tour at Pathé, which was looking for a new star to help them compete with larger studios. Reicher thought she would be great on film (he was right), and he finally convinced her to do a screen test which she did almost as a joke with her husband, actor Harry Bannister. Pathé was so impressed they kept making her offers and she kept saying no – until she met a character she couldn’t refuse.\n\nMary Hutton was a character in Philip Barry’s provocative 1927 play “Paris Bound” about a young married couple who are faithful in heart and mind, but not necessarily body. Reicher was the dialogue director for the film adaptation and asked her about playing the role. Harding loved the character of Mary Hutton enough to make it her first film role.\n\n“It’s such a grand part that I can hardly think of anyone else having it. I loved the character. She has intelligence; she thinks straight and recognizes her mistakes,” Harding is quoted as saying in her biography, “Cinema’s Gallant Lady” by Scott O’Brien.\n\nAnd that’s exactly who she embodied on screen in “Paris Bound”: a smart, thoughtful, passionate and independent woman. Let’s meet her as I write about Ann Harding’s film debut as part of the Classic Movie Blog Association’s “Screen Debuts & Last Hurrahs” spring blogathon.\n\nThe wedding that opens “Paris Bound” between Mary (played by Harding) and Jim (played by March) is a solemn event, not only for the vows being spoken but because of the obvious unhappiness of the guests. There’s the groom’s mother and father, long divorced after his infidelity; the dark-haired and pouty Noel (Carmelita Geraghty), miserable about Jim’s marriage; and the forlorn composer Richard (Leslie Fenton), who loves Mary.\n\nThey will all influence the lives of our young couple who are clearly over the moon in love and thrilled to be married.\n\n“I’m a fool about you,” Mary tells her handsome groom while guests are waiting for them at the reception.\n\nThey kiss, they touch, they speak in soft tones. They are wrapped in love’s embrace, emotions heightened by the palpable chemistry between the actors.\n\nTheir love is undeniable but there is something else they are acknowledging as they reference being a “modern couple.” They are so sweet that even as you hear the newly married Mary say she doesn’t believe in monogamy, you can’t quite believe it. “We’re too fond of people,” she says, as the reason she doesn’t expect to “never see another man and I don’t expect you to never see another woman.”\n\nYou’ve got every right to be puzzled because, as she does throughout the film, Harding is physically showing us the complexities of this woman. As she speaks words implying an open marriage, she gazes at Jim in adoration, rubbing his arm, putting her hand on his chest, embracing him. The words and the actions don’t quite match, nor will they in other important moments.\n\n“Whatever happens, let’s never quit each other,” Jim tells her with words they say as a solemn vow.\n\nBut, as we see early, temptation will follow them in the form of two of the unhappy wedding guests.\n\nRichard, the sad introspective composer, pines away for Mary. “I won’t forget the notes of a melody,” he says to her and about her. (Sigh – the man is tragically smitten.)\n\nNoel is bold, admitting her love for Jim with his new bride in the next room. She grabs him, trying to kiss him as he politely lets her talk but holds her back. “I am yours,” she says, even as he’s telling her to “quit the party and go home.” (“Quitting” a relationship is a common phrase.)\n\nThe film abruptly cuts to the third year of Mary and Jim’s marriage. They’re parents of a toddler son and their love appears strong from their cuddles and kisses during a tearful goodbye as Jim sets sail for a six-week business trip to Paris.\n\nIt’s during these goodbyes at the ship – there will be another one – that Harding best displays the depth of her character. She refuses to join her husband even as she tearfully clings to him, already missing him before he goes. She pushes him away, then pulls him tight, showing us how her beliefs about marriage are at odds with her heart.\n\nEven the next year (it’s an annual business trip), she stands firm in staying home believing married people “need a holiday from each other.” Harding’s face bears the pain of that decision, her body racked with emotion as she again sends her husband off, “Paris Bound.”\n\nJim hates “the forced holiday,” but she insists he goes alone.\n\nBut will he really be alone since Noel connives to “bump” into him overseas, asking if he has time for “coffee”?\n\nMeanwhile Mary innocently spends time with her long-suffering friend Richard at her home where he’s composing his next ballet on her grand piano.\n\nPassions will erupt, and beliefs will be questioned. What will never be in doubt is Mary and Jim’s love for each other, thanks to the lovely performances of Harding and March. Their scenes are intimate and natural, surprising qualities in a film made at a time when many stars were acting with broad gestures like they were still on stage and trying to reach the people in the back of the theater.\n\nBut not Harding. She was a natural in front of the camera who connected with moviegoers as a real person, not just a character. She would make 40 films, mostly from 1929 to 1950, and there was always an innate grace and elegance to her performances through movies like “Double Harness,” “When Ladies Meet,” Holiday” and “The Fountain.”\n\nOh, and we can’t forget the Harding film that remains my favorite, “Condemned,” the one that started it all for me. Harding plays the beleaguered wife of a violent prison warden on Devil’s Island who falls in love with inmate Ronald Colman. That scene I first saw in a preview where she desperately screams of her love for him and it made me almost … laugh? I now think it was because she was so raw in conveying her anguish that I couldn’t handle it. She couldn’t have given more of herself as an actress at that moment.\n\nIt’s no wonder that audiences in 1929 immediately fell in love with Harding or that movie fans like me continue to do so today, nearly 100 years after her film debut.\n\nThe blogathon\n\nThis post is part of the “Screen Debuts and Last Hurrahs” blogathon that is presented by members of the Classic Movie Blog Association. To read more contributions about the first or last films of filmmakers and actors, please click here. And if you write about classic movies, consider joining CMBA.\n\nMaida Walker isn’t on any list of great characters in classic movies, but she should be.\n\nShe’s played by the great Kay Francis in the 1939 romantic drama “In Name Only,” alongside co-stars Cary Grant and Carole Lombard. Oh, and John Cromwell directs. That’s a pretty impressive list of names by all standards.\n\nBut what I always think about first with this film is Maida, a character who had such a chilling effect on me that I stopped watching films starring Kay Francis.\n\nI’ll repeat that: I stopped watching films starring Kay Francis.\n\nGo ahead and laugh. I should have been able to separate the actress from the fictional character, but I couldn’t. Instead, I missed out for several years of seeing Francis in such gems as “Jewel Robbery,” “Trouble in Paradise” and “One Way Passage.” My loss.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI first saw “In Name Only” as a teen for the same reason I’m sure others were drawn to it: Cary Grant and Carole Lombard in a romance. (Swoon!) I knew it involved a love triangle and a loveless marriage and that was fine since it’s a traditional Hollywood story. But Maida was not a traditional wife.\n\nWhile I fell for Grant and Lombard, I was at once fascinated and appalled by the soullessness of Maida, the wife who would stop at nothing to get what she wanted. My strong reaction carried through the screen into life.\n\nSimply put: I hated Kay Francis.\n\nHate is an awful word, I know, but I don’t have another one to describe how she made me feel. Francis was so believable as Maida Walker, the society woman whose black heart was hiding beneath her gorgeous façade, that I wanted nothing to do with this actress or her movies.\n\nOf course, it wasn’t Francis who was evil, it was the character she so brilliantly portrayed. But I was haunted by Maida and the profound darkness that consumed her as she calmly schemed to get what she wanted out of her marriage – and it wasn’t love.\n\nShe was a master manipulator who taught me that evil in movies doesn’t always look like a beast. Sometimes it’s wrapped in a stunning dress, perfect hair and a warm smile.\n\nThat’s why I chose Maida Walker as my entry in “Blogathon & the Beast,” the fall blogathon from the Classic Movie Blog Association.\n\nNo, she’s not a literal beast, but she’s certainly a monster.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhile the plot is relatively simple, Maida is not.\n\nThe film opens with what we today call a meet-cute. Alec Walker (played by Grant) meets Julie Eden (Lombard) while he’s on horseback – all dapper in a suit and hat – and she’s “fishing” in a tiny brook and trying to balance on a rock. It’s such a storybook setting and they are both so pretty and charming that we expect them to immediately fall in love. We are not disappointed.\n\nJulie is a graphic artist who has rented a picturesque cottage for the summer that she learns was formerly owned by Alec. She’s a widow with an adorable 5-year-old daughter Ellen (Peggy Ann Garner).\n\nAlec is one of those down-to-earth rich guys who eschews his family’s wealth and its trappings. He’s married to the beautiful Maida (Francis) but wants nothing to do with her.\n\nThe connection between Alec and Julie is immediate: a cautious love at first sight. The story, then, is Alec and Julie trying to avoid their feelings, then accepting their feelings and being shunned by friends and family while they hope for a divorce and the chance to build a life together.\n\nBut what is Alec’s problem with Maida?\n\nGood question. From the first time we see them together he is callous, uncaring and rude. Not very Cary Grant-like.\n\nAlec’s parents (Charles Coburn and Nella Walker) don’t understand what’s going on. Neither does family friend Dr. Ned Gateson (Jonathan Hale) who is overprotective of Maida. No one is happy with Alec and we can’t help but wonder why.\n\nThe clues come early as Alec arrives home to find Maida and his parents waiting, but he refuses to be with them. Alone together, Maida gently tries to change his mind, but that only draws a surprisingly strong reaction from Alec.\n\nAnd if we’re honest, Maida seems perfectly reasonable and quite sympathetic. She is elegant and lovely, speaks softly and takes the blame in front of others for setting off her husband’s foul moods. She appears to be a perfect wife.\n\n“Even when we’re alone you can do it … make it look as if I’ve beaten you and make me feel like I want to,” he says.\n\nHe goes on to warn her that his parents might “learn the truth about us – you wouldn’t like that.”\n\nKeeping her composure she listens calmly, then strikes.\n\n“They won’t believe you, dear,” she says, wielding the word “dear” like a dagger through Alec’s heart.\n\nIt’s evident this woman is not the meek victim she pretends to be with others, but the true depth of her wickedness will take some time to reveal.\n\nAlec leaves to have dinner alone in town where Maida’s best friend Suzanne (Helen Vinson) flirts with him. He’ll have none of that but drives Suzanne home and, of course, they have an accident in front of Julie’s cottage. This is how Julie learns Alec is married and Maida realizes that Alec has feelings for Julie.\n\nJulie won’t be with a married man especially considering her sister’s pain in being left by her own husband. Maida, not so morally responsible, hatches a plan.\n\nShe arrives at the cottage the next day with a grossly oversized bouquet of flowers to “thank” Julie and invite her to a garden party.\n\nAnd this is where, slowly, a layer here and there begins to be peeled away to show the true Maida.\n\nAt the party, a distraught Maida (we know she’s distraught because she repeatedly raises her hand with a delicate handkerchief to her forehead) sweetly lies to the doctor about Alec and Julie. “It’s been going on for weeks. He’s getting so bold,” she tells the doc who runs immediately off to tell Alec’s parents. (Maida fact check: Nope, Alec and Julie just met.)\n\nThe naïve Julie arrives, only to be humiliated as she’s looked at as “the other woman.” (Maida fact check: Nope, these two have barely shaken hands.)\n\nAnd boy can Maida turn on the pity party with Alec’s parents as she takes the blame for his foul moods. “Don’t lie for him anymore,” they tell her.\n\nThis is how the film is played out. Alec pleads with Maida to leave him alone and get a divorce and Julie tries to stay strong with her moral code. Meanwhile, Maida dispassionately connives.\n\nTake the moment when Alec confronts her with a note she wrote to her past love David, who killed himself on the day Alec and Maida married. Instead of showing any remorse or sadness, she is cold-hearted.\n\n“I did love him. I was mad about him. I had a choice – I could take David and love and nothing else. Or I could take you and what went with you,” she tells Alec. “I took you.”\n\nThe coldness of those lines is chilling. Screenwiter Richard Sherman, who adapted the screenplay from the novel “Memory of Love” by Betsy Breur, gives Francis plenty of moments like that and she takes full advantage in crafting Maida.\n\nThere’s a scene where Alec convinces Maida to get a divorce while vacationing with his parents. He’s gone to see her off on the cruise liner to make sure she will hold up to her end of the bargain. She seems beaten to him, but she’s not.\n\n“I’m selfish in a lot of ways, even my worst enemy couldn’t say I’m stupid. I know when I’m beaten,” she tells him. But by beaten, she means it’s time to ramp up “the Maida.”\n\nAs the ship is about to sail, that troublemaker Suzanne shows up and taunts her. (I love how a ship departure was like a little party.)\n\n“Now honestly Maida, you’re not going to let that girl take Alec away from you?”\n\nMaida slowly walks toward Suzanne with a look we can’t quite make out.\n\n“What do you think,” she asks, a slight off-kilter, half-smile forming as one eyebrow is slightly raised. Maida looks, well, happy. It’s her battle face and she’s ready.\n\nSuzanne’s response is priceless: “Really Maida, you’re marvelous.”\n\nIt’s moments like that I find the most disturbing because Maida never shows her hand. She is the monster lurking behind an unsuspecting person who is moments away from a vicious attack. In Maida’s case it’s through deed and action that will leave internal scars on her victims. When Maida is at her calmest, she is at her most dangerous.\n\nYet with all that said, the full force of her malice isn’t seen until the end. It’s so powerful that I remember gasping at the same moment a character did on screen when Maida opens her malignant heart to its full depth.\n\nRewatching “In Name Only” recently made me wonder why I had such an adverse reaction to Francis because I now find her portrayal of Maida brilliant. Yes, you will fall in love with Grant and Lombard as they go through their heartbreaking journey, but Francis stole the film with acting that was powerful in its subtlety. A slight twitch of her mouth or the rise of an eyebrow was all she needed to show us a brief glimpse of the darkness within.\n\nI can see now that my strong reaction to Maida was because I was as naive in my young life on that first viewing as Julie is in the film when she says to Alec, with much sadness, “I didn’t know there were women like this.”\n\nWell there are and we can admire the actresses who have the skills to create these women in a way that makes us detest them so much.\n\nMaida Walker is a monster who destroys lives. Kay Francis is the actress who so vividly brought to her life. I am now happy to celebrate and enjoy both the character and the actress.\n\nThis story is part of Classic Movie Blog Association fall blogathon called “Blogathon and the Beast.” There are many more great stories written by members of the CMBA that explore this theme so please take time to read some.\n\nAngela Lansbury is sitting across from Mildred Natwick and smiling.\n\n“I’m amazed that you even recognized me. My goodness, you know, it’s been more than 30 years,” she says to Natwick who returns her smile.\n\nThere is a real affection between the two actresses that we can feel even though we’re watching them years later and through our television in a scene from “Murder in the Electric Cathedral,” an episode from the second season of “Murder, She Wrote.” While those words were scripted, the women just as easily could have been speaking to each other in real life since they had worked together nearly 30 years earlier in the delightful 1955 musical comedy “The Court Jester.”\n\nThat little nod of recognition is one of the many ways Angela Lansbury’s long career was used to enrich her television series “Murder, She Wrote.” While millions tuned in weekly to be entertained by Cabot Cove’s most famous resident as she solved murders and mysteries, we got the bonus of a long and impressive list of guest stars that reads like a trip through film history.\n\nMany of the stars were brought up through Hollywood’s studio system along with Lansbury or acted with her on Broadway and that’s one reason we see so many familiar faces and big names throughout the 264 episodes and four feature films that comprised “Murder, She Wrote.” (There were nearly 2,000 during the show’s run from 1984 to 1996.)\n\nAnd that’s what makes “Murder, She Wrote” such a natural for the Classic Movie Blog Association’s spring blogathon, “Big Stars on the Small Screen.”\n\nHere’s a look at some of the big stars who joined Angela Lansbury as a guest on her show, plus other ways “Murder, She Wrote” ingeniously celebrated the Golden Age of Hollywood.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs the flirtatious real estate agent Eve Simpson, Julie Adams (“Creature from the Black Lagoon”) appeared in 10 episodes of “Murder, She Wrote,” more than other any actress outside of Angela Lansbury.\n\nIt started with “If It’s Thursday, It Must Be Beverly” (Season 4/Episode 7), one of the show’s most delightful episodes thanks to the actresses who play the gossipy customers in Loretta’s Beauty Shop who all, to their surprise, fell for a charming lothario. Along with Adams are Kathryn Grayson, Gloria DeHaven and Ruth Roman.\n\nThe actresses would reunite in “The Sins of Castle Cove” (S5/E17) about a young author who writes a tell-all book with thinly disguised residents of Cabot Cove, and “Town Father” (S6/E11) where Mayor Sam Booth (Richard Paul) is accused of fathering five children! (That gets the town talking.)\n\nWatch Adams in these 10 episodes: “If It’s Thursday, It Must Be Beverly” (S4/E7), “Benedict Arnold Slipped Here” (S4/E18), “The Sins of Castle Cove” (S5/E17), “Town Father” (S6/E11) , “A Body to Die For” (S7/E6), “Bite the Big Apple” (S8/E1), “The Witch’s Curse (S8/E12), “Programmed for Murder” (S8/E18), “Final Curtain” (S9/E11) and “The Big Kill” (S9/E17).\n\nHurd Hatfield, Lansbury’s co-star in “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” was a beloved lifelong friend who introduced her to her husband Peter Shaw. He appeared in three episodes starting with “Death Takes a Curtain Call” (S1/E10) in which Hatfield asks Jessica to help two Soviet dancers defect. (It also co-starred Claude Akins in his recurring role as Ethan and William Conrad.) In “One Good Bid Deserves Another” (S2/E17), Hatfield plays an auctioneer in an episode with Jerry Orbach as Harry McGraw plus Edward Mulhare and Karen Black. And in “Night of the Tarantula” (S6/E7), he’s the owner of a neighboring plantation when Jessica visits a friend in Jamaica for his son’s 30th birthday.\n\nAt MGM, Lansbury and June Allyson were in “The Three Musketeers” (1948) and later starred with Van Johnson in the musical crime comedy “Remains to Be Seen” (1953). On the TV series, the trio reunited in “Hit, Run and Homicide” (S1/E8) with Johnson as an inventor whose devices were used in a hit and run murder (as the title suggests). Allyson is his supportive former co-worker he fails to notice until it’s almost too late.\n\nJohnson returned for two other episodes: “Menace, Anyone” (S2/E20) and “Hannigan’s Wake” (S7/E4) which also starred Mala Powers, Guy Stockwell and Stephen Young.\n\nAn episode with a fun idea – a mystery involving poison pen letters – also had a great cast. “Sticks and Stones” (S2/E10) starred Marsha Hunt, Evelyn Keyes, Betsy Palmer, Joseph Campanella, John Astin and Denny Miller. The story is considered a take on “Miss Marple: the Moving Finger.”\n\nAnd there are so many more … (I can’t stop myself.)\n\nLook for Cyd Charisse as a former actress, Mel Ferrer as the hotel manager and Mary Wickes as a wealthy guest in “Widow, Weep for Me” (S2/E1) that finds Jessica posing as a rich widow at a Caribbean resort to investigate a friend’s death. This episode also marked the first appearance by Lansbury’s friend and Broadway (“Sweeney Todd”) co-star Len Cariou as Michael Hagarty, the MI6 agent who always gets Jessica embroiled in trouble.\n\nJane Greer and Michael Ansara are in “The Last Flight of the Dixie Damsel” (S5/E7) along with Martin Milner, Richard Roundtree and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. plus an uncredited Dale Robertson who didn’t like that the credits were done alphabetically on the series and wanted his name removed. (We still know who you are Mr. “Tales of Wells Fargo.”)\n\nSee Dorothy Lamour and former child star Patty McCormack in “No Accounting for Murder” (S3/E19) where Jessica helps nephew Grady who is suspected in the murder of his boss. Eleanor Parker is a leading being tormented before the opening of her new play in “Stage Struck” (S3/E10), an episode that also starred Edward Mulhare and Dan O’Herlihy.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThere are many more names (Diane Baker, Nina Foch, Rod Taylor, Milton Berle, Laraine Day, Tom Ewell, Anne Francis, Farley Granger, Howard Keel, Janet Leigh, etc. ) but let’s take a break and look at other ways the series honored classic films through memories, homages, tributes and yes, more guest stars.\n\nIt was done in small ways like in the vintage photos used on the set. Watch the opening credits of the suspenseful “Reflections of the Mind” (S2/E6) for the photo of a very young Lansbury and Ann Blyth on a table.\n\nIt happened in songs when Lansbury, playing Jessica’s look-alike British cousin Emma, sings numbers she first performed on film: In “Sing a Song of Murder” (S2/E5), the song is “Good-Bye, Little Yellow Bird” from “The Picture of Dorian Gray” (1945). For “It Runs in the Family” (S4/E6), the character of Emma sings “How’d You Like to Spoon With Me” from the 1946 movie “Till the Clouds Roll By.”\n\nThere are subtle nods to specific movies, too. “Death ‘N Denial” (S11/E13) is a fun reference to the title of Lansbury’s 1978 film ”Death on the Nile.” Her character’s name in that film was Salome Otterbourne; the Egyptologist in the TV episode is Sally Otterburn. Bonus: The episode also stars Turhan Bey from “The Mummy’s Tomb,” “Arabian Nights” “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieve” and “Sudan.”\n\n“Bloodlines” (S10/E6), set around the world of horses and horse racing, co-stars Mickey Rooney and Tippi Hendren in its tale of murder and fraud. Rooney plays a horse trainer in the episode, as he did in the 1944 film “National Velvet” which also starred Lansbury as the older sister of Velvet (Elizabeth Taylor).\n\nThen there were entire episodes inspired by a classic film.\n\n“Sorry Wrong Number” came through loud and clear in “Crossed Up” (S3/E13). Jessica is stuck in bed with a sore back during a hurricane when a faulty connection “crosses up” the phone line and she overhears a murder plan. Of course, she’s not believed even when a body is found, so she enlists the help of nephew Grady (Michael Horton).\n\n“Incident in Lot 7” (S8/E13) is all about “Psycho” and it is so much fun, especially for Hitchcock fans. The episode starts with a lively instrumental version of “Hooray for Hollywood” playing over the opening credits. As Jessica’s limo pulls into Universal Studios where they plan to adapt her newest book into a film, the music skillfully morphs into the theme from “Alfred Hitchcock Presents” (“Funeral March of the Marionette” by Charles Gounod). You know this is going to be great and it is Jessica becomes entangled in a murder that takes place in the original “Psycho” house on the studio lot.\n\nThe episode skillfully uses imagery and sound from “Psycho” including the famous Bates Motel sign, the shower curtain, the drain with water swirling around it just as it famously did in the Hitchcock film and those screeching violins!\n\nWe’ll even watch the scene – as Jessica does – of private investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsalm) climbing the stairs inside the house as a door slowly opens at the top of the landing. (Poor Arbogast.) Then the scene plays out again this time with brave Jessica walking up the same stairs while the same door opens. (Run!)\n\nMy favorite “Murder, She Wrote” episode inspired by a classic film is the ingenious “The Days Dwindle Down” (S3/E21) which acts as a sequel – yes a sequel – to the 1949 detective film “Strange Bargain” starring Jeffrey Lynn, Martha Scott and Harry Morgan. The film’s tidy end was tweaked so that the story could continue here as Jessica works to clear the name of a man released from jail after 30 years for a murder he swears he didn’t commit.\n\nHere’s the most excellent part: the episode reunites actors Lynn, Scott and Morgan and uses clips from the original movie. And it keeps on giving with appearances by Gloria Stuart, June Havoc and Richard Beymer.\n\nI previously wrote at length about this episode in the 7th annual “Favourite TV Episode” blogathon hosted by Terence Towles Canote from his blog, “A Shroud of Thoughts,” so I won’t duplicate that article, but I can’t help but share tidbits from this clever episode with other classic movie fans.\n\n[Read my original story: When “Murder She Wrote” brilliantly became a sequel to a 1949 film]\n\nIt was the idea of Executive Producer Peter Fisher who was exploring new ways to tell a story and thought about building an episode around a classic movie that would also star some of the original cast. That last part would be difficult given the passage of years.\n\n“If only I could find an old movie where everyone was still around, then we could solve the case 30 years later,” he said in an interview in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAfter a year of searching, he found “Strange Bargain” and the episode, respectfully written by William Gerson, is fantastic. It even uses film clips from the original movie to augment the story. You can enjoy the “Murder, She Wrote” episode without seeing the film, but if you can watch both I highly recommend it.\n\nAnd, if after reading all of these wonderful names and ideas, you decide you only have time to watch one episode, I would suggest “The Days Dwindle Down” because of its reverence for classic Hollywood and its stars.\n\n* * * * *\n\nYou can find links to all of the wonderful entries in the Classic Movie Blog Association’s spring blogathon by clicking on this link to read more about “Big Stars on the Small Screen.”\n\nHow can a film starring Dana Andrews, Merle Oberon, Ethel Barrymore and Hoagy Carmichael be considered forgotten and hidden away?\n\nAdd in director John Cromwell and appearances by esteemed pianist Artur Rubinstein and conductor Eugene Ormandy and I ask the same question.\n\nBut it appears the 1948 romantic drama “Night Song” is not familiar to many classic movie fans. That’s understandable because it’s not usually shown on television or in repertory, although I was introduced to it on Turner Classic Movies.\n\nOn its original release, “Night Song” was panned by critics and lost $1 million, a huge sum in the late ‘40s. That’s most likely because of some eye-rolling moments in the plot. In brief: A rich young woman falls for a poor and bitter blind pianist, feigns her own blindness to get close to him, then sets up a composition contest with her own money to give him a chance for sight-restoring surgery.\n\nYes, it does sound contrived. But I have a soft spot for this melodrama and I love to recommend it which I’m doing as part of the Classic Movie Blog Association “Hidden Classics” blogathon.\n\nYou’ll have to suspend your disbelief at some of the plot points, but the elegance of this classic Hollywood film, the tender love story at its heart and the wonderful piano concerto that is its own character make me fall for “Night Song” every time.\n\n* * * *\n\nFirst the plot in more detail, then I’ll share more of why this is a favorite.\n\nOberon plays Cathy Mallory, a socialite out with her stuffy rich friends after a night at the San Francisco Symphony. They go slumming in their furs and diamonds to a quaint jazz club called Chez Mamie where Chick and His Swing Six are playing. Cathy is clearly bored until she hears the soft strains of piano and approaches the broad-shouldered, dark-haired pianist.\n\n“Light me a torch, will you chum?” he says to Cathy, not quite the greeting she was expecting.\n\nHe’s Dan Evans (Andrews), a man with a chip on his shoulders the size of a piano after being blinded in an accident by a drunk driver. He wants nothing to do with Cathy or anyone else. “I’m exhibit A here: I’m a blind piano player,” Dan says, with the bitterness he has used to build a protective wall around himself. The only person he lets in is Chick (Carmichael), his best friend, roommate, caregiver and boss in the band.\n\nHe’s a proud man but Cathy is stubborn. She returns to the elegant home she shares with her aunt, Miss Willey (Barrymore, who is my favorite part of this film). A voracious reader of detective novels, she doesn’t miss anything. Listening to Cathy play an unfamiliar tune on her concert grand piano with a far-off look on her face, Aunt Willey knows what’s going on.\n\n“You went somewhere after the symphony and someone played this nice music for you. Describe him.” (The relationship between these two feels very real, giving the film a rare sense of authenticity.)\n\nClearly smitten, Cathy returns to the club where Chick tells her Dan has quit – again. “He’s Mr. Blind Man and nobody with eyes can tell him anything,” he tells her.\n\n“How about someone without eyes?,” she replies, clearly with an idea in mind and it’s a bit far-fetched.\n\nShe’ll pretend she is a blind woman named Mary Willey and goes so far as to rent a small, “rundown” apartment near the ocean where she’ll live with her caretaker and aunt (that’s true, at least). She softens her voice a bit and shrugs off her formal upper-class mannerisms when she “accidentally” runs into Dan and Chick on the beach.\n\nBut Dan is tough. As Chick says, “when he went blind, he went sour.” It takes a few meetings, some piano playing and the help of Chick and Aunt Willey to pull it off, but Mary starts to break through Dan’s wall. The more his heart opens, the more it releases his creativity. That lovely piano concerto starts to take form.\n\nBut that’s not enough for Mary when she learns there’s a chance Dan could regain his sight with surgery. It will take money he doesn’t have and that’s where she can help. She concocts a well-meaning ruse to sponsor a contest and puts up her own $5,000 as the grand prize. So much has to go right for Dan to win, but Cathy and Aunt Willey have the musical knowledge to understand that what Dan has written is great and deserves to win such a prize. Even Chick sees her deep understanding of classical music when he tells Dan after that first night in the club that “She went for the music, so she has brains as well as diamonds.”\n\nYou can see where this is going, but it takes a detour when she runs into Dan again – this time as herself, the socialite Cathy Mallory. Dan doesn’t “recognize” Cathy is Mary for a few reasons. Like Clark Kent putting on his glasses so he’s not recognizable as Superman, Cathy raises the pitch in her voice and fools Dan though occasionally he does the old “I feel like I know you.”\n\nThat sets up the love triangle of Dan, blind Mary Willey in San Francisco, and the sophisticated Cathy Mallory in New York City. To say more about how they got to this point or where it goes would spoil the movie.\n\n* * * *\n\nI can remember the first time I saw “Night Song” and falling for it within seconds by the same music that wooed Cathy to Dan. Piano Concerto in C Minor by Leith Stevens was playing over the film’s opening credits and it’s magnificent – one of the best pieces of music written for a film. It’s featured in a nearly 9-minute sequence that I find spellbinding.\n\nI originally watched “Night Song” for Dana Andrews, then for the love story. But it was Barrymore and Carmichael who hooked me. Though they were playing second fiddle to the lovebirds, they subtly stole the show.\n\nDespite some of the illogical plot points, the dialogue flows so naturally and understated from Barrymore and Carmichael that the roles seem to have been written for them. They are well-defined to the point you don’t even need to see them to know they are in the room. In one scene, the camera is fixed on a radio with a dainty coffee cup on a saucer in front, and light smoke billowing across the screen. You know Aunt Willey is just off camera and she is.\n\nThe relationships between the characters are well done, too, whether it’s Dan and Chick, Mary and Aunt Willey or Chick and Aunt Willey. Chick is a steadfast friend who won’t let Dan wallow in self-pity and truly believes in him. “I think you’re a genius, he tells Dan. “So you’re blind, but Shubert’s dead.”\n\n“Night Song” is elevated by little character moments. My favorite is Aunt Willey sitting in a comfy chair all happy to be reading a detective novel while smoking and drinking coffee. When she drops her book, she starts to bend over, then turns to the stack of paperbacks beside her and takes the one off the top.\n\n“Night Song” has my favorite qualities of classic Hollywood movies like romance, star power, lovely music and a coziness you can sink in to. Besides any movie that stars just one of the four main actors – Andrews, Oberon, Barrymore, Carmichael – is worth a watch. A movie with all four? That’s a can’t-miss and a reason to give this hidden gem a chance.\n\n* * * *\n\nThe blogathon\n\nThe Classic Movie Blog Association’s four-day “Hidden Classics” blogathon features stories on many other films that aren’t as well known as they could – and should – be.
