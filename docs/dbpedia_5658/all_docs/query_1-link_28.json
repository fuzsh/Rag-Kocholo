        "text": "[Updated 7/1/24]\n\nIn 1985, DC Comics merged its fictional Multiverse into one, seemingly coherent world. Many years later, the publishing house would bring back its Multiverse and inspire DC Films (as it was called at the time) to use the concept as an overarching narrative structure for its slate of films and Warner Bros. Television’s suite of ongoing shows like The Flash and Pennyworth. But before the plan could really get underway, DC Films’ parent company was sold to Discovery, Inc. and the DC production company was reorganized into DC Studios with The Suicide Squad director James Gunn and producer Peter Safran as its co-CEOs. Their first directive from the merged Warner Bros. Discovery corporation: ditch the Multiverse and plan a coherent, consistent DC live-action universe. Call it a “Shadow Crisis” — one that continued to escalate as DC film projects and TV shows hit the scrap heap across the later half of 2022 and Gunn kept assuring fans he and Safran would soon announce a plan for DC Studios.\n\nThe first part of their plan was revealed on January 31, 2023. Dubbed “Chapter One,” it will focus on the “gods and monsters” of the DC Cinematic Universe — which will seemingly be referred to as the DCU. The slate is ambitious with an equal amount of Batman, Superman, and lesser known characters getting the film spotlight.\n\nListen to our Podcast: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… Batman v Superman\n\nListen to our Podcast: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… Wonder Woman 1984\n\nListen to our Podcast: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… Aquaman\n\nThe creation of DC Studios and the Chapter One plan are the latest shockwaves in the often incredible story of Warner Bros.’ attempts to bring the DC Comics characters to the screen. The following represents everything we know about the DC Studios films on the way and in development, as well as a few DC adaptations that will exist separate from the universe. (Want to see what the other camp has in store? Check out our breakdown of upcoming Marvel movies.)\n\nSEE: Most Anticipated 2023 Movies\n\nComing Soon\n\nEven with the DCU Chapter One plan, there is a lot that remains uncertain about which DC Comics characters are coming to the big screen, who’s bringing them there, and in what order — other than the first two films on the schedule, nothing is certain about these movies.\n\nJoker: Folie à Deux\n\n(Photo by Niko Tavernise/© 2019 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.)\n\nRelease Date: October 4, 2024\n\nWhat We Know: Thanks to the success of the first Joker, a follow-up was inevitable, but details remained scarce through 2020. In May of 2021, word broke indicating the project was still in development. Star Joaquin Phoenix and director Todd Phillips set their return with Phillips posting a photo of the script’s cover page (credited to Phillips and Joker co-writer Scott Silver) on social media, revealing the film will be called Joker: Folie à deux. The term is a reference to two or more people sharing similar mental disorders, leading many to wonder if the sequel will feature a Phillips take on Harley Quinn. In subsequent days, Lady Gaga‘s name emerged as Joker’s potential partner in crime with the film also positioned as a musical — a New York, New York contrast to the first film’s Taxi Driver. In August of 2022, the film’s release date — October 4, 2024 — was announced. In subsequent months, Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lofland, and Harry Lawtey joined the cast with Zazie Beetz also setting a return — the only person besides Phoenix to do so. Filming began in December of 2022 and concluded in April of 2023. A teaser was released the following Spring emphasizing the film’s nature as a jukebox musical and the relationship between Arthur and Harley.\n\nHow It Fits Into the DCU: It doesn’t. As Safran clarified in January 2023, the film will be considered an “Elseworlds” release. The term — borrowed from DC Comics’ answer to Marvel’s What If…? — will be applied to any film, show, or animated project taking place outside the main DCU. It is currently unclear if there will be strong branding to indicate the difference, but the distinction is important to note. Also, an acknowledged Elseworlds brand means DC Studios can always develop offshoot versions of their characters without the worry of crossovers or continuity. Presumably, this also means Phoenix will never be the DCU’s Joker.\n\nSuperman\n\n(Photo by DC Studios, @JamesGunn/Twitter)\n\nRelease Date: July 11, 2025\n\nWhat We Know: As revealed in the January 2023 announcements, Gunn wrote a script for the first project of the new DCU — Superman: Legacy. While not an origin story, it will see a younger Clark Kent reconciling his Kryptonian heritage and Kansas upbringing. That prompt can go in many different directions, from other Kryptonian survivors arriving in Earth orbit to Clark coming under the influence of a Kryptonian artifact. After several months of deliberation, Gunn announced in March of 2023 that he would direct the picture himself. Leads David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan (as Superman and Lois Lane, respectively) were cast shortly before the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes began. Afterward, casting notices came swiftly in the closing days of 2023. Nicholas Hoult will make his DC debut as Lex Luthor, while Anthony Carrigan, Isabela Merced, Edi Gathegi and Nathan Fillion will play Metamorpho, Hawkgirl, Mister Terrific, and Green Lantern Guy Gardner. In a curious change from most Superman films, the other heroes will already be established prior to the Man of Steel’s first flight. Other cast members include Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen, Sara Sampaio as Eve Teschmacher, and Sean Gunn. The latter will reportedly play occasional villain Maxwell Lord — a part that may recur in subsequent DCU projects. In November of 2023, María Gabriela De Faría emerged as a reportedly villainous take on The Engineer. More recent additions to the cast include Wendell Pierce as Daily Planet editor Perry White, Beck Bennett as another Planet stalwart, and Milly Allcock as Supergirl (more on that below). The ever chatty director also commented on using the Volume technology popularized by Star Wars TV shows (he will not use it), the “validity” of Superman’s different costumes across the decades, and his decision to shoot the entire film in the IMAX format. Production began in early 2024 with Gunn revealing that the film will be called, simply, Superman.\n\nHow It Fits Into the DC Multiverse: Gunn claims the Superman debuting in the film will be the one featured in subsequent DC Studios films, TV shows, games, and animated projects. Based on that, Corenswet will be very busy through 2035 thanks to an alleged 10-year(!) contract with DC. Additionally, reconciling Clark’s Kryptonian heritage will involve Kara, aka Supergirl, and lead to her own film.\n\nThe Batman Part 2\n\n(Photo by Jonathan Olley/©Warner Bros.)\n\nRelease Date: October 2, 2026\n\nWhat We Know: In April of 2022, The Batman director Matt Reeves confirmed he and star Robert Pattinson will return for “the next chapter.” No other details are available, but speculation includes introductions of a Robin, the cabal of Gotham elite known as the Court of Owls, Hugo Strange, and the villain Hush, who is teased (after a fashion) in The Batman. We’re also going to presume the rebuilding of Gotham City will be a plot point, as well Bruce’s (Pattinson) attempts to create a public persona. In January of 2023, Gunn and Safran revealed the film’s initial release date and that it will be rounded out with a third film to complete a planned trilogy. But with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, development slowed to a crawl. As of December 2023, only Pattinson is the only actor confirmed with Jeffrey Wright and Andy Serkis presumably returning as Jim Gordon and Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, rumors suggest the Scarecrow will appear in some capacity. At one time, Zoë Kravitz was also said to be returning, but is unclear if this is still the case. Additionally, it is unclear if Colin Farrell‘s Penguin — who is starring in his own TV series on Max — will continue to solidify his grasp on Gotham’s criminal underworld. The delays also led to the film moving its release by an entire year, now slated for an October 2026 debut.\n\nHow It Fits in the DCU: Like the Joker sequel, this will be an Elseworlds project separate from the DCU. Presumably, the same can be said for the various television series planned to take place in The Batman‘s reality.\n\nIn Development\n\nFrom the Chapter One slate to some older projects that may still be kicking around the Warner offices, DC Comics is fertile soil for film ideas. But like the shelved projects at the end of this list, it remains to be seen how many of them will materialize by 2035.\n\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow\n\n(Photo by DC Comics)\n\nRelease Date: June 26, 2026\n\nWhat We Know: The Cloverfield Paradox’s Oren Uziel was reportedly writing a script based on the Girl of Steel. Like The Flash feature film, it was meant to ignore the television series on The CW and tell its own version of Kara Zor-El’s first few days as a superhero on Earth. In February 2021, The Young and the Restless’s Sasha Calle was cast as Kara for an appearance in The Flash feature with the intention to star in Uziel’s Supergirl. She was not invited to return for the revised version of the project, Chapter One’s Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. As revealed by Gunn and Safran in January 2023, the film will be based on writer Tom King’s recent Supergirl series and feature an unexpectedly different take on Kara Zor-El as she travels the stars. Late in 2023, writer Ana Nogueira submitted a draft Gunn called an “above and beyond” adaptation of the source material. In early 2024, Milly Alcock was confirmed to be starring as Kara after a successful test for the part in Superman. That March, I, Tonya director Graig Gillespie stepped in to helm the film. In May, the film also earned a 2026 release date.\n\nHow It Fits in the DCU: We will meet this version of Kara in Gunn’s Superman before she flies solo, but expect her to be different from the the goofy energy of Melissa Benoist on the Supergirl TV show or Calle’s traumatized take in The Flash. Kara will have memories of Krypton that make living elsewhere a challenge for her.\n\nThe Authority\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: Based on the WildStorm series of the same name, this Chapter One film will center on The Authority, a group of super-powered individuals formerly employed by a shadowy government agency. Going on their own, they decide explosive preemptive strikes are the best deterrent to supervillainy. But as a critique of the more fascistic elements of superhero groups like The Avengers and the Justice League, it remains to be seen how well they’ll do in a DCU meant to be more hopeful and bright. Additionally, the team name will debut in Superman, but it is unclear if any of the heroes set to debut in that film will be members or carry on into this project. Presumably, Gabriela De Faría will carry on as the Engineer, though. In March, Gunn told fans he is still waiting for a complete and approved script before any other auditions can take place. And with the executive now in production on Superman, it may be awhile before there is any more movement on this project.\n\nHow It Fits in the DCU: Just like their comic book origins, The Authority is an invasive species. The contrast between them and mainstream DC may be quite fascinating as, we’ll admit, the characters are a lot of fun. Then again, they could easily be another of Amanda Waller’s (Viola Davis) pet projects.\n\nThe Brave and the Bold\n\n(Photo by DC Studios, @JamesGunn/Twitter)\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: Based on writer Grant Morrison’s Batman and Batman Inc. stories, this Chapter One project will introduce the DCU’s Batman and his son, Damian Wayne, in an “unusual father-son story.” Additionally, the project will feature some of the other members of the Batfamily. We also expect Damian’s mother, Talia Al Ghul, to make an appearance. In March of 2023, Gunn teased the possibility that a writer may already be onboard to flesh out the concept into a script. That summer, The Flash‘s Andy Muschietti signed on to direct the film. Some reports in the months since, though, suggest he may not be entirely committed to the project.\n\nHow It Fits in the DCU: Since Damian is the fifth teenager to don the Robin costume, it is possible his predecessors may appear. And at this point, we’d love to see Dick Grayson (aka Nightwing), Jason Todd (aka Red Hood), Tim Drake (aka Red Robin), and Stephanie Brown (aka The Spoiler) grab some handholds in this new DC universe.\n\nSwamp Thing\n\n(Photo by DC Studios, @JamesGunn/Twitter)\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: Described in a Warner Bros. press release as an investigation into the character’s “dark origins,” this particular Chapter One project may end up the first film in the long-desired dark corner of the DCU. Almost immediately after the announcement, 3:10 to Yuma‘s James Mangold emerged as a potential director. He confirmed his involvement in April of 2023, adding that he may either choose Swamp Thing or his Star Wars project about the first Jedi depending on which script gets approved first. Of course, that was before the strikes. At the moment, he is still the writer and director of record and envisions the film as a standalone story.\n\nHow It Fits in the DCU: For many years, attempts to featuring some of Swampy’s Justice League Dark compatriots have floundered. The film could be an introduction to the magical and mystical elements of the DCU. But if Mangold is interested in making just the one film, it will fall on other filmmakers to integrate the character into the narrative universe.\n\nConstantine 2\n\n(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: In an absolutely stunning turn of events, Keanu Reeves is planning to play John Constantine once again. As revealed in September 2022, the actor will reunite with director Francis Lawrence — who helmed the first Constantine back in 2005 — while Akiva Goldsman will pen the script. Lawrence claimed he will shoot for an R-rating. The film will likely be the one DC project to emerge from the many J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot began developing several years ago for both film and television. Although delayed by the strikes, Lawrence and Reeves both commented in the Fall of 2023 that the movie is still very much in development. Little word about the film has emerged since with at least one producing saying they “hope” the film happens.\n\nHow It Fits Into The DCU: As it was not part of the DCU slate announced in early 2023, the film will presumably be an Elseworlds project and continue within the first film’s reality.\n\nTeen Titans\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: In March of 2024, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow writer Ana Nogueira signed on to adapt the sidekick superhero team into a feature film of their own. Little else is known — including which Titans will appear. A good guess, though, is the early 1980s lineup popularized by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Perez. That group includes Nightwing, Starfire, Cyborg, Raven, Beast Boy, and (sometimes) Wonder Girl. Most of that team also comprises the Titans known to generations of animation fans who loved Teen Titans and Teen Titans GO!.\n\nHow It Fits In The DCU: If Nightwing is team leader, he will likely debut in The Brave and the Bold before embarking on this cinematic adventure. Also, with Gunn confirming in late 2023 that Viola Davis, John Cena, and Xolo Maridueña will carry on as their characters from the so-called DC Extended Universe, it is possible the latter’s Blue Beetle could find his way onto a team of younger heroes.\n\nBlackhawk\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: While it is unclear if Blackhawk will be part of the DC film universe, it is a favorite comic book of director Steven Spielberg. He even tried to get a Blackhawk movie off the ground in the 1980s. The current version of the project will see him direct a film based on the golden-age Quality Comics concept later bought by DC in 1957 with The Lost World: Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp adapting the concept. The main character is the leader of the Blackhawks squadron, a famed air outfit of seven ace pilots during World War II. When DC incorporated them into a post-war context, they became mercenaries, battled James Bond-style supervillains, and even flirted with becoming superheroes themselves! Considering the director’s fascination with the Second World War and aviation of the period, the original Golden Age version seems like the best fit, provided the film ever gets off the ground; the project was not on DC Studios’ 2023 development slate.\n\nHow It Fits In The DCU: If it ever materializes, Gunn could easily give Spielberg and his collaborators the narrative framework to set in the 1940s and, perhaps, introduce one or two other characters more suited to that era. That is a big if, though, as there has not been movement on this in many years.\n\nNightwing\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: As of February 2018, The LEGO Batman Movie’s Chris McKay was still developing a project centered on the first Robin, Dick Grayson. A final draft from screenwriter Bill Dubuque was due at the time, but there has been no movement since. Reportedly, the film was postponed in anticipation of The Batman. In June of 2021, McKay told CinemaBlend, “I hope it’s still a reality. I hope that we still get to make that movie. As far as I’m concerned, it’s not lost yet.” McKay’s hopes may be dashed, though, if the character ends up leading the Teen Titans project covered above.\n\nHow It Fits in the DCU: Although the character will not receive his own film in Chapter One of the DCU, it is possible Nightwing will make his debut in The Brave and the Bold as one of the other members of the Batfamily.\n\nLobo\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: The Main Man, a Czarnian with various superpowers and healing factors, has always been of interest to Warner Bros. in its various corporate incarnations. Attempts to make a Lobo movie date back to 2009 with Guy Ritchie and Brad Peyton circling the director’s chair. As of February 2020, screenwriter Jason Fuchs (Wonder Woman) was completing a new draft. Michael Bay was linked to the project, but it is unclear if he ever really signed on. In one of the stranger turns, The Hollywood Reporter claimed in December 2022 that Jason Momoa is interested in switching from Aquaman to the Main Man for a Lobo feature. According to Gunn, no DCU actor will serve double duty while he stewards the film universe, but with the Momoa Aquaman seemingly abandoned by Warner Bros. Discovery, the rumor persists.\n\nHow It Fits in the DCU: Lobo could introduce the cosmic elements of the DC Universe. The character’s irreverence and stark design also set him apart from the rest the DC characters audiences are familiar with. And considering the times his comic book counterpart and Superman have butted heads, he could become a worthy opponent for the Man of Steel in a subsequent film. Additionally, he is the sort of character Gunn likes to work with, but a solo feature for the Main Man did not appear on the executive’s list of projects in 2023.\n\nStatic Shock\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: First revealed at the 2021 DC FanDome event, a film based on Milestone’s Static – and, of course, the Static Shock animated series – is in development at Warner Bros Pictures. Michael B. Jordan will join Reggie Hudlin as an executive producer on the project with Randy McKinnon writing the script. Based on the character created by Milestone Media founders Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, Michael Davis, and Derek T. Dingle, the film will center on Virgil Hawkins, a teenager with electromagnetic powers who finds his way into a larger world while still keeping his local streets safe. Originally set in Milestone’s Dakotaverse, it is unclear if Virgil will start his adventures there or as a DC hero. As it happens, Static only transferred to the DC Universe in 2008 while his cartoon counterpart made cameo appearances in DC animated shows much earlier.\n\nHow It Fits in the DC Multiverse: Provided the film is still anywhere on the Chapter Two horizon, expect Static to establish his own cred before other heroes seek him out. Alternatively, he could begins his adventuring in an Elseworld before crossing into the DCU proper.\n\nGreen Lantern Corps\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: Announced back with Cyborg in the 2014 masterplan, Green Lantern Corps may or may not continue to slowly move forward. In June of 2018, former DC Entertainment president and chief creative officer Geoff Johns took over writing and producing the project through his production company, Mad Ghost Productions. According to the company website, the film will feature both the Silver Age Green Lantern, Hal Jordan (played by Ryan Reynolds in the 2011 film), and John Stewart, the Green Lantern voiced by Phil LaMarr in various Justice League animated series. An earlier concept developed by Man of Steel’s David S. Goyer and Justin Rhodes was said to be a sort of “Lethal Weapon in space” – a description which may still hold true for Johns’ as he worked with Lethal Weapon director Richard Donner for a number of years. When Johns was participating in a Green Lantern television series for HBO Max, though, the project seemed to be postponed again — though it was said to be a priority for Warner Bros. Pictures going into the Discovery merger talks. Following the creation of Warner Bros. Discovery and DC Studios, it remains unclear if the film is still happening. Additionally, a radical shift in the TV show’s premise to feature Jordan and Stewart may indicate the film has finally been shelved.\n\nHow It Fits in the DCU: As a concept, the Green Lanterns are quite versatile and just about any member of the Corps would make a worthy addition to a DCU film or series.\n\nThe Other Superman\n\n(Photo by © First Run Features /Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: Just a few days after Blue Beetle became a theatrical release, word surfaced indicating Bad Robot would produce an entirely new Superman film with novelist and Captain America comic book writer Ta-Nehisi Coates (above in the documentary Moynihan) on scripting duties. Reportedly, the project will feature a Black actor in the lead – although it is unclear if he will play Clark Kent or one of the various Black Superman characters DC Comics has introduced over the years. In May of 2021, a shortlist of directors including Regina King, Shaka King, and J.D. Dillard emerged, but with Regina King ultimately signing on to adapt Image Comics’ Bitter Root, it seems the shortlist is just down to the latter two. Meanwhile, some reports indicate Coates handed in his script sometime in the Spring of 2022, but it is unclear if the project is a priority in the ever-changing goals of Warner Bros. Pictures and its corporate owners. In April of 2023, Gunn told i09 the project is still in development and, should it get the greenlight, would emerge as an Elseworlds story.\n\nAlso, Michael B. Jordan was said to be developing a Max series centered on Val-Zod, the Superman of Earth-2 with writers Darnell Metayer and Josh Peters. But like the Coates/Abrams film, it is unclear if this will ultimately materialize.\n\nHow It Fits Into The DCU: Both, if they ever happen, will be Elseworlds releases as Gunn intends for his Superman to be the Man of Steel in the DCU.\n\nHourman\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: In March of 2021, Chernin Entertainment signed on to produce a film featuring the 1940s comic character or one of his subsequent iterations. In most cases, Hourman obtains heightened strength and endurance via a pill called Miraclo. Unfortunately, its effects only last an hour and he can only use it once a day. At last report, Gavin James and Neil Widener were set to write the script. In the years since word of the project first broke, no updates have emerged and it is possible the film was lost in the Warner Bros. Discovery merger. Additionally, Hourman failed to materialize as part of the DC Studios Chapter One slate, but it is unclear if the concept has been shelved or left in its extremely slow development state.\n\nHow It Fits Into The DCU: With versions of the character ranging from a 1940s mystery man to a time traveling android from the 853rd Century, the possibilities for Hourman are endless should Gunn and Safran ever find room for the Man of the Hour.\n\nBlack Canary\n\n(Photo by Claudette Barius/©Warner Bros.)\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nWhat We Know: In June of 2021, news of a Black Canary film joining the HBO Max roster of DC feature films broke. Jurnee Smollet is reportedly set to reprise her role from Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) with Misha Green writing. Birds of Prey producer Sue Kroll will also produce Black Canary. In June of 2022, Smollet told Comicbook.com she was excited to explore the character in a deeper way, suggesting the project is still alive in some form. In August of 2022, TVLine confirmed that the film is indeed still in development. It failed to appear in DC Studios’ 2023 announcements, but we’re still hoping there is room for Smollet and her take on Dinah.\n\nHow It Fits Into The DCU: As a “friend” of Harley’s (Margot Robbie), she has a few things in common with the survivors of The Suicide Squad‘s Corto Maltese mission. And in the comics, Dinah has been known to end up leading the Justice League, so there is a place for the character should Gunn and Safran want to include her.\n\nShelved\n\nSince we began tracking the cinematic developments of the DC Comics characters, a lot of announced projects have fallen by the way side. The following commemorates the efforts made by many talented individuals to explore the expanse of DC’s multiverse.\n\nNew Gods\n\n(Photo by Photo By: Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)\n\nRelease Date: Shelved\n\nWhat We Know: A Wrinkle In Time’s Ava DuVernay was set to direct a film version Jack Kirby’s New Gods for Warner Bros., writing the script alongside Mr. Miracle writer Tom King. The film allegedly would have centered on escape artist Scott Free – aka Mr. Miracle – and his wife Barda. Both are refugees from the plant Apokolips; a miserable world under the grip of the tyrant god Darkseid. Scott was given to Darkseid as a baby by his own father to maintain a peace between Apokolips and the nearby world of New Genesis. Despite the detente, Darksied plots to control the universe and the battle of the New Gods rages on. DuVernay thrilled fans in early 2020 when she said she “may in fact be taking some notes” from the Twitter dream casting threads, which included names like Diego Luna for Mr. Miracle.\n\nUnfortunately, Warner Bros. and DC announced on April 1, 2021 that two of their films in development — one of them being New Gods — “will not be moving forward… Their projects will remain in their skillful hands if they were to move forward in the future.”\n\nThe Trench\n\nRelease Date: Shelved\n\nWhat We Know: As part of an effort to keep Aquaman’s corner of the DC film universe alive, Warner Bros. hired screenwriters Noah Gardner and Aidan Fitzgerald to write a script centered on The Trench in February of 2019. As referenced in the film’s early moments, The Trench are the descendants of an Atlantean tribe who devolved into fish monsters after breaking away from the rest of the kingdoms. They can be seen attacking Arthur and Mera’s boat shortly before they make their way to the secret sea. Wan publicly discussed his adoration for the creatures and it seems the project would have develop quickly into an offshoot of Aquaman a la the Annabelle spin-offs from Wan’s The Conjuring series. The film was reportedly set to take place after the first Aquaman film and lean into some horror elements, which of course makes sense, considering Wan’s résumé.\n\nAs with Ava DuVernay’s New Gods, however, development of The Trench was also halted indefinitely by Warner Bros. and DC Films, even though a script for the film had been completed by Gardner and Fitzgerald. The announcement did keep the door open just enough to allow for future developments, but as of now, The Trench is no longer a part of the studio’s immediate plans. In October of 2021, Wan revealed the project was actually a Black Manta solo film with Yahya Abdul-Mateen II in the starring role.\n\nWonder Twins\n\nRelease Date: Shelved\n\nWhat We Know: To be directed by Black Adam screenwriter Adam Sztykiel and meant to star KJ Apa and Isabel May, the Wonder Twins HBO Max feature was to center on characters created by Norman Maurer for the The All-New Super Friends Hour animated series. Zan (Apa) and Jayna (May) are two teenagers from the planet Exxor who can activate their shape-shifting powers by touching each other’s hands. Zan can become any form of water while Jayna can become any animal. Presumably taking its cues from the 2019 Wonder Twins comic book by Mark Russell and Stephen Byrn, it would’ve seen the pair adjusting to life on Earth while also finding their place in the superhero community.\n\nSadly, the film was scrapped in May of 2022, just shortly after Apa and May were announced to star. According to reports, the film was budgeted at $75 million — a price too rich when compared to incoming Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav vow to cut $3 billion from the corporation’s operating budget. Additionally, the studio also felt the Wonder Twins were too niche an idea for a theatrical release, ending all development on the project.\n\nBatgirl\n\n(Photo by © Warner Bros.)\n\nRelease Date: Shelved\n\nWhat We Know: Originally intended as Joss Whedon’s writing and directing debut in the DCEU, the project was ultimately written by Birds of Prey scribe Christina Hodson. Presumably, the film was meant to establish Barbara Gordon as the Batgirl of Gotham. In May of 2021, the project became active with Ms. Marvel directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah signing on to helm the film, which was then set to be one of the first DC-related direct-to-HBO Max features. That July, the casting process seemingly narrowed in on Isabella Merced, Zoey Deutch, Leslie Grace, and Haley Lu Richardson. Grace won the role later than month with J.K. Simmons entering negotiations to return as Commissioner Jim Gordan, a role he first took on in Justice League. During DC FanDome in October 2021, Grace described the character as a “girly girl, but she’s capable and strong and determined.” Co-director El Arbi added that the film will feature “realistic fights.” A piece of production art glimpsed during the presentation also suggested Batgirl will utilize a costume similar to her New 52 look in the comics. In subsequent months, Michael Keaton signed on as Batman, Brendan Fraser agreed to play Firefly — the primary antagonist — and Ivory Aquino joined the cast as Alysia Yeoh, Barbara’s best friend. Other actors in the cast included Rebecca Front, Corey Johnson, and Ethan Kai. Grace unveiled the first proper look at the Batgirl costume in January of 2022, a version heavily inspired by the “Batgirl of Burnside” costume designed by Cameron Stewart and Babs Tarr. As of early July 2022, there was a possibility the film might join Blue Beetle as a theatrical release, but on August 2 came the stunning news that the film — despite nearing completion — wias to be shelved entirely and will never see release in theaters or on the Warner streaming service. In January of 2023, Safran told Deadline the version of the film he screened was “not releasable” and would have hurt the DC brand.\n\nThe Other Batman\n\nRelease Date: Shelved\n\nWhat We Know: In a New York Times profile of Walter Hamada, the former DC Films chief made a curious reference to the Multiverse making two Batman feature film sagas possible. One to continue the story of The Batman while the other … well, it was anyone’s guess at the time. Since the profile was published, WarnerMedia became Warner Bros. Discovery, DC Films became DC Studios, and Hamada exited the company entirely. Curiously, the idea of a separate Batman for the DCU was resurrected by Gunn and Safran for their Brave and the Bold project.\n\nWonder Woman 3\n\nRelease Date: Reportedly Shelved\n\nWhat We Know: Hot on the heels of Wonder Woman 1984’s box office success – well, at least in 2020 metrics – Warner Bros. announced a third film was being fast tracked. Both director Patty Jenkins and star Gal Gadot were set to return. Jenkins also said the film will finally bring Diana’s solo adventures to the present day. Development continued while Jenkins went off to prep Rogue Squadron, a Star Wars film that may eventually happen, but is currently postponed indefinitely. In April of 2022, Gadot told Forbes the script is still in the process of development but “all wheels are working and turning.” In early December of that year, the actor tweeted another hopeful message about the project as Jenkins and co-writer Geoff Johns submitted a treatement to the studio. But, according to The Hollywood Reporter, Gunn, Safran, and Warner Bros. Pictures co-chairs Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy subsequently told Jenkins that the project no longer fits the DC strategy. It is currently unclear if director or star will be involved in any subsequent Wonder Woman projects. As it happens, the character is missing from the DCU’s Chapter One slate.\n\nMan of Steel Sequel\n\n(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)\n\nRelease Date: Shelved\n\nWhat We Know: In September of 2017, X-Men: First Class director Matthew Vaughn met with the studio in regards to a direct Man of Steel sequel. Many years on, the return of Superman to the big screen seemed like a distant possibility. Then came Henry Cavill‘s cameo in October 2022’s Black Adam, word of another cameo in 2023’s The Flash, and an Instagram post the Monday following Black Adam‘s release in which Cavill claimed to be back as Superman. Subsequent reporting revealed nothing long-term had been signed between the actor and Warners, making hopes of a Man of Steel 2 a little dimmer. All hopes of his return were finally smashed when Gunn revealed he is developing a new Superman film focused on a version of Clark who is “not Henry.”\n\nUntitled Jared Leto Joker Project\n\n(Photo by © Warner Bros.)\n\nRelease Date: Presumably Shelved\n\nWhat We Know: According to reports, Jared Leto was meant to star and executive produce his own solo Joker film – a deal which happens to be quite similar to Margot Robbie’s involvement in Birds of Prey. Details remained scarce for many years, other than it was meant to be a separate project from both a “Joker and Harley” concept and the standalone Joker. It was also planed to spearhead a batch of films based on the characters featured in Suicide Squad. As the years passed and the DC film universe continued to molt behind the scenes, the changes of Leto’s return dwindled. And with the switch to Gunn and Safran’s DCU, we imagine the actor’s cameo in Zack Snyder’s Justice League will be his final appearance as the Clown Prince of Crime who lives “in a society.”\n\nCyborg\n\n(Photo by © Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\nRelease Date: More Than Likely Shelved\n\nWhat We Know: Ray Fisher had been set to star as Vic Stone in a 2020 Cyborg film since 2014, but no director or screenwriter were ever announced. Many doubted the film would materialize despite still being on the calendar for many years following Fisher’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice cameo. In September of 2018, the actor suggested fans of the character may need to become more vocal to make the film a reality. In the summer of 2020, he launched a campaign to expose Joss Whedon’s alleged abusive behavior on the set of the Justice League reshoots. As the situation expanded to former DC Films chiefs Geoff Johns and Jon Berg, Fisher vowed never to work with former DC Films boss Walter Hamada – whom he alleged was pressuring him to take back his accusations against Johns. Subsequently, Cyborg’s planned role in The Flash was written out and, presumably, any chance of a solo film outing went with it.\n\nWe kept hope alive that the character, in some form, would anchor his own feature in the DCU for a long time, but with Gunn and Safran revealing their “Chapter One” slate in January 2023, we’ve been forced to finally declare this project shelved. But like Vic Stone himself, there is always the possibility it will live again.\n\nThumbnail image: Clay Enos/©Warner Bros."
