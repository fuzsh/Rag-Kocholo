        "text": "What do Jacques Tati, the state of Kansas, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Tsuguharu Foujita and James Baldwin have in common? Wes Anderson, or, rather, his new film, The French Dispatch, which is, in the diversity of its characters and references, akin to the serving tray the film opens with: “A demi-tasse, coffee in a tiny pitcher, and hot milk in a creamer; a half-bottle of cold white wine, perspiring; a crimson colored cocktail one finger deep; a short-stemmed glass of amber aperitif; a jigger of off-black digestif (which gets an egg cracked into it, two jolts of spicy sauce, and a raw oyster carefully slid from its half-shell); a small chocolate sundae; Coke in a bottle; a box of [Gaullistes] cigarettes with a book of matches; and a little glass of water with an effervescent tablet dropped in it, frizzing”. Holding this dazzling collection of imagery, landscapes, details, accents, reference points and color schemes of The French Dispatch, there are three pillars. This film is an anthology, or an “omnibus collection of stories”; The New Yorker, and a French movie. The first is the feature of the film’s format; Anderson’s personal favorites in this genre are Vittorio de Sica’s The Gold of Naples and Max Ophüls Le Plaisir. And the second two components reveal Wes Anderson’s life-long passions.\n\nAnderson has been an avid reader of The New Yorker since his school years; he’s been collecting and binding some issues on his own, and at some point he even bought off a set of forty years of bound New Yorkers from UC Berkeley. He has almost every issue starting in the 1940s. For The French Dispatch he wanted to bring the aura of the magazine into the picture, with a cast of his favorite actors. Many of the New Yorker pieces have inspired these characters and stories: in fact, for this project Wes Anderson has put together an anthology of such pieces, An Editor’s Burial. Journal and Journalism from The New Yorker and other magazines, edited by David Brendel and published by Pushkin Press.\n\n“Even though it’s not an adaptation, the inspirations are specific and crucial to it”, says Wes Anderson in the interview he gave The New Yorker, included in the introduction to the anthology, “This book is almost a great big footnote”. The real-life characters of the anthology are their own, dressed in their own stories, traits, and peculiarities; they live a different narrative from the movie script. It’s oftentimes not as rich in events as on the screen, but made extremely saturated by the language in which it is described. And sometimes, on the contrary, the real-life characters seem to come directly out of fiction, in these “unconventional vignettes”, to quote one of the writers, S.M.Behrman. The idea of inspiration, more than direct adaptation, is not new to Anderson’s cinema: The Grand Budapest Hotel, for example, was largely inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig, as well as by Hannah Arendt’s writings on the trial of Adolf Eichmann, Eichmann in Jerusalem, and Irène Némirovsky’s Suite Française (which is a personal reference joy as I wrote my Master’s thesis in the Sorbonne on her writings, and she is not a very well known author, at least not outside of France).\n\nNow France has a special place on the Wes Anderson map. He surely likes to collect, be it actors, places, epochs, styles. His films are shot with allusions to New York (The Royal Tenenbaums), Japan (The Isle of Dogs), Italy and Portugal (Life Aquatic was filmed around Naples — the island of Ponza, the shore and Rome, and Seu Jorge is singing covers of David Bowie in Portuguese the whole time), Italy again (Castello Cavalcanti), Austria and Eastern Europe (The Grand Budapest Hotel), briefly, Paris (Hotel Chevalier), and India (Darjeeling Limited). He’s currently shooting a film in Spain. He’s very international, and in this variety of locations one can feel his fascination with a bounty of different landscapes, mentalities, and cultural cross-sections. There’s Rhode Island with its islands and khaki scout camps; there’s the nostalgia for a sunken ship of grand European hotels; there’s fascination with Japanese cinema; there’s fascination with the culture of a heist movie (Bottle Rocket). And in this latest film, it’s France, in all its manifestations: it’s the French cinema, of Renoir, Rivette, Godard, Rohmer, Tati, Duvivier, and others, it’s the French cuisine, it’s the quintessence of a French town, filmed in Angoulême, the tradition of comic strip books particular to this town, French music, French fashions, etc. It’s Wes Anderson’s own rendering of living in France, too: he has had an apartment in Paris for many years, fittingly, on the Rue du Regard, and his personal experience of the country shows deeply in The French Dispatch. “People don’t necessarily like it when you invade their territory, even respectfully, but maybe they start to appreciate it when they see how much you love the place”, he says in the introduction interview to the anthology. Which is a remark only a person who’s lived in France would know to make, for it reveals cautiousness and reverence.\n\nFor this film he’s created a fictional town of Ennui-sur-Blasé, which literally means “Boredom on .. apathy due to overindulgence or sophistication”. You would say “blasé” of a person that is incapable of excitement because they’re bored, “they have seen it all” and they know it all, and have been ecstatic enough in their own time. You could also say so of someone overly sophisticated, worldly-wise. Anderson recalls that they chose the name because at some point Jason Schwartzman, who was not only the cartoon artist of the magazine in the film but one of the co-writers of The French Dispatch, said it out loud. It’s also quite ironic because of this common cliché association with The New Yorker — blasé intellectual writers who’ve seen it all — but in each story, something unexpected happens. J.K.L.Berensen assists to a fight in prison, Lucinda Krementz fails to remain neutral, co-writing the manifesto with Zeffirelli, and Roebuck Wright’s profile of the Commissaire’s cook gets interrupted by the kidnapping of the Commissaire’s son.\n\nArthur Howitzer Jr. came to Ennui on a holiday, and remained there, having invited a team of quality writers to transform his series of travelogue columns, a literary Sunday supplement to his father’s Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun called Picnic, into The French Dispatch, and create a magazine of his lifetime. The articles that comprise the stories in the film are being prepared for the last issue of the magazine (the Issue-in-Progress board in Howitzer’s office delightfully mirroring the hyphenated triptych name of the city, Ennui-sur-Blasé). They have very New Yorker sounding sections: for example, Howitzer’s obituary is published in the Declines and Death section. Howitzer is inspired both by Harold Ross, the very first editor of The New Yorker, and by William Shawn, Ross’s successor. They were quite different in their approach to working with journalists; Ross was incredibly stern, honest, impatient, and entirely dedicated to the magazine. He worked without weekends, interruption or relay. The “No Crying” sign above Howitzer’s door is a play on Ross’s restriction on humming, singing or whistling in the offices of The New Yorker. “They share a general grumpiness”, says Anderson on Ross and Howitzer Jr. “Ross had a great feeling for writers”, says Anderson, “He values them, but he also thinks they’re lunatic children who have to be sort of manipulated or coddled. Whereas Shawn seems to have been the most gentle, respectful, encouraging master you could ever wish to have”. Brendan Gill’s essay in the anthology shows that Shawn had his own tricks in editing his writers; where Ross was blunt and unafraid to pick a quarrel, Shawn was polite, complementing, but very persuasive: “Shawn’s delicacy is a negative brute force that gets greater results then Ross’s positive one”. Nevertheless, both their departures from the magazine were greatly mourned, as seen in the pieces included in the anthology. E.B.White’s note — written, it seems, collectively, by the entire office of The New Yorker on the day after Ross’s death (just like the staff of The French Dispatch writes it together, with Wright typing, in the last frames of the film) — is of genuine love, respect and gratitude, and a certain special connection to the editor reads in its lines. And Shawn’s goodbye note to his New Yorker staff is very touching: “I will miss you terribly, but I can be grateful to have had your companionship for part of my journey through the years. […] Love has been the controlling emotion, and love is the essential word. We have done our work with honesty and love”. In other similarities, both Ross and Shawn also came from the Midwest, and Arthur Howitzer Jr. comes from Kansas. Ross also founded the magazine in 1925, same year as Howitzer founded The French Dispatch, and died of heart failure, while in the film Howitzer dies of a heart attack.\n\nAnderson borrows some of Galant’s writing — sometimes citing entire sentences — but there is no such dreadful battlefield in Ennui. However, despite the difference in the apparent gravity of the circumstances, the most important feature Lucinda Krementz borrows from Gallant is sympathy, if not empathy (“clarity and empathy”, says Anderson of her writings), both towards the students and their parents and their teachers, which wasn’t as obvious in the writings of another New Yorker correspondent at the time, Janet Flanner. “The courage of these kids!” writes Gallant, then remarking on the “touching narcissism of the young”. One of the young girls is “pure et dure” (pure and hard-line), “the tone of demonstration is one of great dignity” and, finally, “I am convinced I have seen something remarkable”. Of Daniel Cohn-Bendit, one of the leaders of the student movement, she says: “Intelligent, cunning […] rapid speaker. He has the ruthlessness of someone unable to put himself in another’s place. In the movie, it’s Zeffirelli who tells Krementz, “I like how ruthless you are. It’s part of your beauty, I think”. Galant describes some parents, too, who want to give their children the freedom to decide for themselves, as they have been brought up, but who worry, nonetheless, and advises the young students to explain to their parents the meaning of their movement.\n\nThere is a certain ambivalence to the students. “They remind me of children who keep insisting they are not sleepy when in reality they are virtually asleep on the carpet”, writes Gallant. And later: “I am frightened for these children who would be angry at being called children”. On a different day she describes the latest slogan of the students: “Nous ne sommes pas fatigués”, We are not tired. These two things have probably created an amalgam of the poster seen in almost every street shot in that story — Nous ne sommes pas “sleepy”! (We are not sleepy!), as if the poster were a direct response to Mavis Gallant’s writing, and a play on the actual student slogan. Gallant acknowledges that these students “have never been frightened. Frightened in theory but not in fact. Cohn-Bendit born a refugee, but after the war. He doesn’t know. He can imagine, as I could have imagined the 1914 war”. And that, of course, creates a deep rupture between the young and the generation above. Gallant describes a scene at the Sorbonne: “In the vast forecourt, a long table piled with Mao’s red book (remember Godard! — K.Z.) […] Cheap banners with Mao, Lenin, and so on, and Stalin. So shocked”. When Gallant asks the young student about it, she hears: “We are prepared to admit his errors, but he was a revolutionary, too”. In this instance, there’s so much description — of the rupture, of the ideology. “China-tendency paraphernalia trashy, tawdry, cheap. […] Everything tatty, a folklore now — China, Cuba, Godard’s films. Our tatty era”, bitterly writes Gallant. There are no apparent Mao books in The French Dispatch, but at some point Juliette wants to replace the picture of Tip-Top, the pop singer (in reality, Jarvis Cocker) by a picture of Francois-Marie Charvet. This is not a real person, the name was borrowed from one of the film crew, but the photograph shows a stern philosopher in glasses, and it is perhaps a play on Jean-Paul Sartre who had addressed the students at the Sorbonne during the events described by Gallant and was actively taking part in them.\n\nAnd then, when touching upon the subject of war, there is a graver tangent in the film: Mitch-Mitch, Zeffirelli’s camarade, goes away to the Mustard region for an obligatory service, but then deserts and burns his soldier’s badge in front of the youth of Le Sans Blague. Later, he writes a play about this time of his life, Goodbye Zeffirelli. We see a bit of the play on stage: the scene where the boys discuss their aspirations in life on their army bunk beds. While someone wants to become a pharmacist, and the other wishes to continue his father’s business, one boy, Morisot, says he wants to become a protester in life. He is crying, and, before jumping out the window, firmly says: “I can no longer envision myself as growing in our parents’ world”.\n\nBut there’s also much admiration for these children: “I used to think that the young in France were all little aged men”. But the events change her mind: “They have written on the walls of the Sorbonne, “L’imagination prend le pouvoir”. And then “How some of the students actually began to talk to the police. Not arguing — discussing. Talking […] about their problems and, dear God, the structure of society”. The theme of children playing to be adults, or taking on adult roles is a popular one in Anderson’s films: take Atari of The Isle of Dogs who rescues the dogs and eventually becomes the mayor of Megasaki as a teenager (remember, also, the “Megasaki Senior High Daily Manifesto” in The Isle of Dogs written by courageous students who fight the anti-dog regime). Or the three Tenenbaum children, young geniuses reminiscent of the Glass family in Salinger’s stories. Or Max Fischer in Rushmore. And of course Sam and Suzy from Moonrise Kingdom, a young shakespearean couple defying the circumstances that aim at separating them.\n\nThe French Dispatch also has a play on Romeo and Juliet: the character played by Timothée Chalamet is Zeffirelli, and Lyna Khoudri plays a girl named Juliette, and their young romance and names refer to Franco Zeffirelli’s 1992 classic adaptation. Both are children and children that claim to become adults. They write a manifesto, but they are shy of their new muscles or virginity; they play politics, they talk in slogans, all while listening to jukeboxes, in all seriousness, in the cafe Le Sans Blague (No Joke). Their manifesto is being proofread; they play chess with the authorities to decide on the next move. And in real life the spark that led to the student movement was the student Daniel Cohn-Bendit interrupting the minister’s speech in Nanterre with a claim for all boys to have access to girls’ dormitories (“Such a Wes Anderson version of what would spark a student uprising!”, says Susan Morrison of The New Yorker). The very goal of their movement is unclear. “What do they want?”, writes Krementz, “to defend their illusions”. Zeffirelli is “not an invincible comet”, and his tragic (and quite farcical) death makes his likeness a symbol of rebellion, “sold like bubblegum”.\n\nIn order to sell, one must “create a desire”; so say the Cadazio uncles from another article in the issue, “The Concrete Masterpiece”. There are several real-life references for these remarkable characters. While Moses Rosenthaler most probably remains a beautiful concoction with unusual roots and a turbulent history (and he growls like Fantastic Mister Fox), Anderson names the art collector Joseph Duveen as the main reference for Julien Cadazio, played by Adrien Brody. “Early in life”, writes S.M.Behrman, “Duveen […] noticed that Europe had plenty of art and America had plenty of money, and his entire astonishing career was the product of that simple observation”. In the film, Julien Cadazio brings Upshur “Maw” Clampette from America to an asylum in Ennui-sur-Blasé with that particular notion in mind. “The phenomenon of Duveen was without precedent”, continues Behrman. In his essay he paints a tableau worth a separate motion picture — a tableau of many instances, of scenes — how exactly Duveen would acquire the art to bring it back to the States to sell, his famous phrases, his character, so complex, theatrical and extravagant. An example: in the movie Julien Cadazio comes down to the prison cell to ask Moses Rosenthaler for the price of his painting. They argue for some time. Then Moses makes his mind: he wants 50 — no, make it 75 — cigarettes. Cadazio is insulted by this price and offers … 250,000 francs (“selling is what makes artist an artist!”, he cries). In Behrman’s essay, The Days of Duveen, a glimpse of a reference comes by: once, while buying a family portrait from some Englishwoman, Duveen had mentally skipped the stage of buying and has passed directly to imagining its selling price — and when the Englishwoman suggested 18 thousand pounds for the painting, he, indignant, shouted: “My dear lady, the very least you should let that picture go for is twenty-five thousand pounds!”.\n\nAnd that freedom is found on the pages of A.J.Liebling’s essays. Liebling was a big eater (“the primary requisite for writing well about food is a good appetite”), a big writer, and, like Anderson, Baldwin, Gallant and others, an expatriate in Paris. His two essays, in the fashion of many New Yorker pieces, depicture encounters with people (for example, Yves Mirande, French actor and producer, unofficial director of a restaurant on Rue Saint-Augustin), events and voyages (his own, from the States to Paris), but it’s food that really becomes the protagonist. Eaten in restaurants, eaten at people’s homes, eaten on a hippodrome; its descriptions are so extravagant, so lavish, so researched and so well written that citing bits of them just wouldn’t make sense, much as I would like to. One piece names more dishes than some gastronomy dictionaries would: artichokes on the pedestal of foie gras, truite au bleu, civet from the marcassin, sauce Nantua, daube provençale, pinta-dous, caille vendangeuse, escargots en pots de chambre, saucisse gendarme de Morteau, morilles, black caviar, tripes a la mode de Caen, boudin, tons of various fish (“the whiting en colère, his tail in his mouth, as if contorted with anger”), and so on and so forth. There is a separate encyclopedia listing for wine: Liebling seems to always know which one merits attention, be it a rosé, a Bourgogne, an Alsace, a Languedoc, a champagne, or something else (“The Wines of France” by H. Warner Allen, as well as “The Food of France”, by Waverley Root, are his personal bibles). He particularly admires clairet wines, deeply colored rosé wines from Bordeaux (the designer team of The French Dispatch made a special label for the bottle of “Schostal Clairet Prestige” for one of the sets, undoubtedly in honor of Liebling), and Côte Rotie (“Drinking it, I fancied I could see that literally roasting but miraculously green hillside, popping with goodness, like the skin of a roasting duck, while little wine-colored devils chased little nymphs along is simmering rivulets of wine”). And it’s not the names or the enumeration of the dishes, of course, that merit as much attention, but their descriptions that mezmerize and “cast a spell”, as Wright says. And then, there’s bad food, the mention of which can’t leave the reader without the most miserable feeling, as if a character in a story had suffered a great loss (the “côtes d’agneau […] had been cut from a tired Alpine billy goat and seared in machine oil, and the haricots verts with which they were served resembled decomposed whiskers from a theatrical-costume beard”, writes Liebling).\n\nThe style of Baldwin couples with the style of Liebling and produces this marvelous monologue of Roebuck Wright which we hear while he’s looking for the commissaire’s dining room in the Prefecture. Same happens when Wright describes the cocktail (the frames even acquire color for this instant of dégustation), and the dishes served to the Commissaire (Mathieu Amalric) who can’t come up with a working rescue plan without having had dinner. And where does Nescaffier come from? His name is a play of the great Georges Auguste Escoffier, who’d set the terms for the French haute cuisine at the dawn of the 19th century. Escoffier spent seven years in the army and served as an army chef, which could be why Nescaffier is a Lieutenant in the film, and develops a niche of “police cooking”. Escoffier was a German prisoner of war in 1870, and reportedly Kaiser Wilhelm II had told him: “I am the Emperor of Germany, but you are the Emperor of Chefs”. Moreover, as Stéphane Hénaut and Jeni Mitchell write in my personal bible, A Bite-sized History of France: Gastronomic Tales of Revolution, War, and Enlightenment, quoting Hayagreeva Rao, Escoffier’s cuisine classique was challenged by the upheaval of 1968 (and here we come back to Mavis Gallant and discover an inside correlation between Anderson’s stories): “Nouvelle cuisine represented a radical turn in cooking style, facilitated by the broader social currents that exploded in 1968. Its four fundamental values — truth, lightness, simplicity, imagination — were in many ways also the values of the May 1968 protesters”.\n\nNescaffier’s likeness comes from Tsuguharu Foujita, whom Wes Anderson gave as a reference to Stephen Park, the actor (during the video call with Anderson’s crew at the 2021 NYFF, Stephen Park said he used to have the same haircut in his childhood). Foujita was as big an admirer of France as all those on the list above, so it makes sense that this artistic reference gets thrown into the inspirational melting pot.\n\nAnd then, there is the crucial moment, crucial to the piece, its author and those who inspired him, as well as to Wes Anderson himself. The TV host asks Wright something in the vein of: you’ve written about America, Europe, politics, art, but more than anything you’ve written about food. Why?\n\nBeing a writer is difficult and lonely, Wright responds. There’s a sad beauty to it. But at the end of the day there was always a table set for him somewhere down the street, a chef and a waiter ready to bring him a warming meal, to comfort him. “The solitary feast has been very like a comrade,” says Wright. And the theme of loneliness mirrors in the figure of the cook, who, on his deathbed, while being resuscitated, confesses to Wright that the toxic salts were a new experience to him, which is rare in his age and profession. As a foreigner in Ennui, he is trying harder than others to belong, to do right (“The city is full of us”, says Wright). There is a camaraderie among such expatriates, lonely masterminds busy with their art. The loneliness, the attempt to belong, the urge to discover paired with nostalgia create a poignant melange: Nescaffier is always “seeking something missing, missing something left behind”. And while this line makes Wright too sad, Howitzer thinks it’s the best part of the whole piece. That is something that all of the French Dispatch writers share, as well as Wes Anderson himself. His co-writer, Hugo Guiness, came up with a term for this expatriate experience: “reverse emigration”, referring to Anderson’s moving to Paris. “There’s a sort of isolation living abroad, which can be good or it can be bad”, says Anderson. “It can be lonely, certainly. But you’re also always on a kind of adventure, which can be inspiring”.\n\nIt is also known that Anderson often has great cooks while working on the set. According to Tony Revolori, the actor who plays Zero in Grand Budapest Hotel and young Rosenthaler in The French Dispatch, Anderson loves good food and he organizes big familial dinners for the actors and the film staff. “Family” is, in fact, the first word that comes up when actors describe the ambience of the set of any Wes Anderson film. Timothée Chalamet and Lyna Khoudri, the newcomers to this world, are joyously remembering how every evening all the members of the film crew would sit together at a big table and have dinner, each time in a different configuration, so that everyone would have a chance to speak. Actor Murray Abraham, the older Zero in Grand Budapest Hotel, also describes this familial feeling on the set, saying it is very much in the tradition of Ingmar Bergman. In one of the interviews Wes Anderson describes having rented a mansion in Newport while filming Moonrise Kingdom where the principal actors of the film moved in, one by one, to live together during the shooting; they’d done the same thing while filming Darjeeling Limited in India, where the crew stayed together just outside of Jodhpur. “These were his people”, says the narrator of The French Dispatch about Arthur Howitzer, Jr. watching over his authors. Same could be said about Anderson watching over his actors.\n\n“I’ve always liked it when everybody is together, like our own theater company”, says Wes Anderson, “It just helps”. In fact, when you think of the plays Max Fisher puts on in Rushmore, you immediately draw the comparison of that restless schoolboy always founding one club or the other, using and reusing the cast of his friends and theatre actors for his ambitious school plays, and Wes himself. Each movie is a theatre, where each set and each costume receives as much attention as the characters and the unraveling of their personalities. In The French Dispatch the theatricality of the sets is even more stressed out: the walls of Le Sans Blague slide to reveal their function of the set, and later a real scene from Mitch-Mitch’s play is staged. This could perhaps be another reference to how the children are playing in “growing up”. In other films, we also see plays (Margot writes plays and puts two of them on in The Royal Tenenbaums, Suzy acts in a play in Moonrise Kingdom) and the theatricality of characters and their lines are sometimes intentional. For example, in Life Aquatic Steve Zissou says to his supposed son Ned played by Owen Wilson: “Don’t be nice to Ali. He’s my nemesis”. In The French Dispatch Julien Cadazio says, defying all rules of scriptwriting: “It’s three years later”, and the young Rosenthaler (Tony Revolori) switches places with the older one (Benicio Del Toro); they hug and part ways.\n\nTheatre is only of the genres used in this movie. The French Dispatch is not only an anthology of stories, or actors, for that matter, but of genres, too. There’s the genre of cinema, and then there’s photography (those shots of Lea Seydoux posing naked in a very Harcourt slash Man Ray black and white). Then there’s tableau vivant, the fantastic still shots of people fighting in the story about Moses Rosenthaler, glasses frozen in their freefall from the tray, Tilda Swinton motionless with a grimace on her face; or the same genre of shots in the Past/Future snapshots in Sazerac’s story. There’s animation, which is particularly worth mentioning, since Angoulême, which has served as the backdrop city for all four stories, is a comics and animation capital of France, so it makes perfect sense that Tintin-style comic-strip animation would be included in the film. In fact, Anderson asked the students of Angoulême to collaborate with him to create the sequences of animation for the chase scene in The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner.\n\nAnother prominent aspect of the film is the black and white constantly alternating with color (for when Roebuck Wright tastes the cocktail in the Commissaire’s dining room, and the taste kicks in; for when we see Rosenthaler’s canvases, or Berensen’s tangerine dress). “It was the Emile de Antonio movie Painters Painting — which I love — that suggested to me the idea to only shoot the painting in color”, says Anderson in the introduction to the script printed as a separate issue of The French Dispatch.\n\nAside from the characters, many other elements in the film remind of the tendency to draw from inspirations. The soundtrack, for instance, is Jarvis Cocker singing covers of some of the most famous French songs — the one we hear in the trailer as well as at Le Sans blague is the cover of Christophe’s Aline. There’s also Gainsbourg, Ferrer, Dalida, a cover for Mao Mao, a song by Claude Channes from Godard’s Masculun Feminin, and others. For the story about Moses Rosenthaler Alexandre Desplat, Anderson’s long time collaborator, has written music highly reminiscent of Erik Satie (while watching you almost wonder if there hasn’t been a piece of Satie that you’d somehow missed and didn’t know about). Such inspirations are in the set, too: for instance, the back of the building where the magazine is located is almost a replica from a house where “Mon Oncle” lives in the Jacques Tati film.\n\nEven the zigzagging ascent of the waiter who’s bringing up all the drinks to the office in the very first shot is incredibly similar to the way Tati slowly goes up the staircase, slowly showing up in various windows.\n\nOr take costumes: one such adoptive instance is the helmet of Lyna Khoudri’s character, that has, in fact, been inspired by how Pascal Ogier’s character sports a similar style helmet in Jacques Rivette’s film Pont du Nord.\n\n“We were stealing things very openly, so you really can kind of pinpoint something and find out exactly where it came from”, Anderson says in the New Yorker interview with Susan Morrison.\n\nAll of these ideas, inspirations, concoctions were brewing in Anderson’s head for years. He’s had the story about Rosenthaler jotted down for a decade. But in order to distill this cocktail of ideas into a story, Anderson needed to build it up on an insane amount of details and research to keep the viewer’s attention and also appeal to their trust. “Even though it’s kind of a confection, a fantasy, it still needs to feel like the real version of a fantasy”, he says, “It has to feel like its roots are believable”. “It’s all from research. This sort of invented stuff and the fantasy element to it is basically all from research. We shape the research into our story”, he continues, “and then try to give it as much authenticity as we can”.\n\nIn the Youtube video of the making of Grand Budapest Hotel the costume designer Milena Canonero discusses how she’d like for Monsieur Jean’s shirt to be tapered in “the continental style”, pointing at its back. And while Monsieur Jean (the “new, young” concierge of the hotel played by Jason Schwartzman) appears in the film only for several minutes, in total — let alone the back of his shirt, which never appears in the shot — this whole train of reflexion goes into the tiniest detail; it’s there just to hold, akin to a pilar, the most careful reconstruction of reality in this made-up world. Other than that, the same Youtube video from the set of Grand Budapest Hotel shows Anderson picking up the fake fingers that in the film have been cut off from Deputy Kovacs’s hand; he arranges and rearranges them on the floor. For a different shot, he controls the amount of fake snow; then he tries on the bundles of Mendel boxes and checks that Siorsie Ronan will be comfortable biking with them; he supervises the making of Mendel pastries and sweeps the snow in front of the newspaper kiosk.\n\nHe is everywhere, in every little part of the process. That’s probably what also makes up for such a big part of his magic: the fact that he is, simultaneously, a script writer, a filmmaker, a producer, a prop designer, an operator, a narrator; he’s everyone in one, despite his fabulous, loyal team of his co-authors, actors, designers, editors. And even if we never get to notice some of the details on the set, or in the character’s costume, or even in the sounds, they have to be there just to create this omnipresent feeling of continuity.\n\nIn fact, many of his films have side projects: for example, for Moonrise Kingdom, Anderson asked various illustrators to design covers for Suzy Bishop’s book (she reads out loud from them to Sam and other khaki scouts in the film). When the film came out, an additional video was posted on Youtube, of the actor Bob Balaban, who plays the librarian in the red coat, who presents these books. Excerpts are read, each excerpt animated in its own style. Anderson wrote the excerpts himself, and one of the books (The Francine Odysseys) was designed by his partner, Juman Malouf, who is a costume designer and illustrator, and also author of The Trilogy of the Two, a young adult fantasy adventure story.\n\nThere are many more aspects of the film to discuss; if only I had the format to do so. The French Dispatch tackles a lot themes Wes Anderson has already touched upon before: between Zeffirelli and Krementz there’s the kind of friendship often seen in his films, between older characters and younger ones. Such is the friendship between Max Fischer and Herman Blume in Rushmore, or Gustave and Madame D in Grand Budapest Hotel, which is, of course, something else than just a friendship. It slightly touches on the theme of “impossible, unconventional love”: like between Max Fischer and Rosemary Cross, the teacher, in Rushmore; or between Suzy and Sam in Moonrise Kingdom; or between Margot and Richie Tenenbaums.\n\nThere’s the theme of a “genius child”: such as Isidor Shariff de la Vilatte, or simply Gigi, the Commissaire’s son here, in The French Dispatch. His first words were in Morse code and he solves his father’s unsolved cases for fun. He also says to Wright, in passing, “I’ve read you in the magazine […] Great author”. Such precocious kids are found in the Tenenbaum family, and many other films, as discussed above, for oftentimes these are also children who “play” in being grown-ups. Oftentimes these children are also somewhat different, or seen as “troubled”; Wes Anderson builds a succession of such characters who are marked by some inner drama or conflict. Margot Tenenbaum, the adopted daughter, is a classic troubled child (she is very secretive, she had never had a connection with her father, started smoking at 12 years old, tried to secretly find her own family, ran away to stay in the museum, etc.). So is Suzy Bishop, who is also secretive and also keeps running away from the family who misunderstands her, towards a secret, impossible love. In fact, there’s an autobiographical reference in Moonrise Kingdom: when Suzy discovers a pamphlet entitled Coping with a Troubled Child pamphlet that belongs to her parents, and realizes it has to do with her, it’s Wes Anderson himself discovering a similar-titled pamphlet in his childhood home. In an interview with Julie Miller of Vanity Fair he says: “It’s just something that at the time, when I found it, I was like [grits teeth], “What is this!” I immediately knew who that troubled child was even though hypothetically it could have been someone else”. Another “troubled child” is Max Fischer, despite being very different from Margot and Suzy, is also a “troubled child” — in all of his productivity, in all his attempts at organizing clubs, events, adventures, hides the loneliness and the sorrow of a motherless and friendless child.\n\nAnd then, in the story of the Commissaire and his son, there is also a slight shadow of the “father-child relationship”. In this film there is a strong, untroubled bond between the two, which is only strengthened by the kidnapping, but in other films of Anderson, this love is more complex. Ned Plimpton looks to reunite with his father in Life Aquatic, and the reunion doesn’t go as simply as that, as the father has consciously ignored Ned’s existence all his life. The Tenenbaum children have always had a difficult relationship with their father Royal, and his regaining of their trust and friendship is, basically, the plot of the film. In Moonrise Kingdom Sam’s adoptive father refuses him, and a new father is found in the character of Bruce Willis. In Rushmore, Max Fisher has a hard time accepting his father as a simple barber, not a neurosurgeon. In Darjeeling Limited the three brothers try to reconcile, as their father’s death obviously being a very painful event for all three of them, each in a different way, plus their mother had vanished. In Fantastic Mister Fox, Ash tries to win the attention of his father throughout the entire story.\n\nAll of these examples — as well as all of these themes — only prove that there is always a lot of complexity to Anderson’s characters and his worlds, despite the theatricality of them, the vivid colors of the sets and costumes, the slapstick inspired screenplays and geometrical precision of the camera. “Wes’s films, I think, have this quality of unusual sense of humor, which actually is holding very serious themes and quite serious emotions, in fact”, said Ralph Fiennes in an interview about Grand Budapest Hotel. Discovering these layers of humor and seriousness, play and reality, fiction and history, is always an immense pleasure, and, each time, an adventure in a new world. The process of writing this essay was definitely one, like a treasure hunt for all the secrets that Wes Anderson has hidden in the corridors of each story and in the folds of the character (por)traits. Here’s to discovering what Anderson’s new film, Asteroid City, will hold."
