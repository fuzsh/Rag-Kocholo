        "text": "Film Introduction: Edgar Allan Poe (02:27)\n\nFREE PREVIEW\n\nPoe told a publisher, \"Poetry is the main purpose of my life.\" Actors recite bits and pieces of Poe's works and provide a little biographical data on Poe.\n\n\"The Conqueror Worm\" (02:43)\n\nAn actor recites \"The Conqueror Worm\" by Edgar Allan Poe. He notes elements of Poe's life that might be hinted at in the poem.\n\n\"To My Mother\" (01:31)\n\nAfter the death of his mother, Edgar Allan Poe lived with a wealthy couple. Later he married his young cousin. \"To My Mother\" was written to his cousin's mother. An actor recites the poem.\n\n“Israfel” (02:42)\n\nOne of Poe's primary ideas about poetry was the close connection between poetry and music. One can hear the lyrical musical qualities of “Israfel,” recited by an actor.\n\n“Annabel Lee” (02:19)\n\nPoe's second idea about poetry was that beauty is the chief aim of poetry. “Annabel Lee” is an expression of this idea. An actor recites the poem.\n\n“The City in the Sea” (02:40)\n\nPoe's third idea about poetry is that is can be composed logically. This is exemplified in “The City in the Sea,” recited here by two actors.\n\n\"Eldorado\" (01:02)\n\nIn November 1845 Poe published his last collected edition of his poetry. Included in this edition are two poems titled \"To Helen.\"\n\n“To Helen” (01:45)\n\n“To Helen” is an example of Poe's belief that poetry is a \"rhythmical creation of beauty.\" An actor recites the poem.\n\n“The Haunted Palace” (02:34)\n\nActors recite Poe's rhythmical narrative called “The Haunted Palace.”\n\n“Evening Star\" (01:07)\n\nAn actor recites Poe's “Evening Star.\"\n\n“The Raven” (09:18)\n\n“The Raven” is perhaps Poe's best known poem. It is recited here by professional actors.\n\nPoe's Legacy (01:41)\n\nPoe's life was fraught with tragic circumstances, but it was a life of great creative productivity. He left behind a legacy of tales and poems that will endure forever.\n\nCredits: Edgar Allan Poe: A Journey in Verse (00:57)\n\nCredits: Edgar Allan Poe: A Journey in Verse"
