        "text": "The Asphalt Jungle throbs with adrenaline, yes, but with something else, too: regret. I’m thinking specifically of the bouncy yet melancholy scene in which Doc takes a fatal break from his getaway and sits among teenagers, watching a sweater-clad nymphet shimmy and shake to jukebox tunes played on his nickel.\n\nThe jubilant jazz and the ignorant bliss of the youngsters accentuate Doc’s old age and his sense of loss—from the years spent in prison, yes, but mostly just from the implacable passage of time.\n\nDoc insists to his driver, “We have time,” although the sad gleam in his eyes tells us he knows that’s a lie. He’s referring to a specific schedule, but the comment could apply more broadly to the inevitability of death and decline that hangs over the film—never more wistfully than in the jukebox scene. Indeed, Huston visually makes the connection between the girl and Doc’s doom: after she gyrates away from a window, the audience can see the police peering through the Venetian blinds, waiting for their quarry.\n\nIn another poignant (if creepy) shot, the bobby-soxer dream girl dances right past the camera, revealing Doc’s spellbound, pathetic face as her swinging hips move out of the frame. Next, waving her dance partner away, she wiggles from across the room right into the camera; her undulating torso nearly fills the frame. The dynamism of that girl’s body—the optimism it implies and the hopelessness of Doc ever engaging with it as only a young man could—slaps the audience with agonizing obviousness.\n\nBut just as age craves youth, youth craves wealth. We get to listen to the jukebox nymphet precociously nag her boyfriends about their lack of means: “Nickels he’s complaining about. What a spender! Sure he wants a date. He always wants a date. And where do we go? A third-run movie!” As she chides the boys, Doc listens in close-up, wearing the hint of a knowing smile. Then we see the girl among her companions, continuing her complaint.\n\nHere Huston frames her from an awkward, slightly high angle, not really Doc’s point-of-view. The angle—working in conjunction with the low-key lighting, oddly moody for the portrayal of bright-eyed teenager—is just off-kilter enough to give us a sense of comic distance. The downward gaze enhances the bitter irony of the girl’s cajoling: the same desire for things, for little pleasures, drove Doc and his compadres to crime.\n\nWho knows? Maybe this nice girl’s nice longings will tempt her and her nice boyfriends to not-so-nice deeds in order to obtain the money for the nice things they want. Or maybe they’ll just settle down and spend the rest of their lives consumed by the honest wants and needs that become the substance of most people’s pallid lives.\n\nThe mildly kinky voyeuristic vibe of the scene also illustrates how adroitly noir connected sex and crime—even in a seemingly innocuous exchange. Raymond Borde and Edmond Chaumeton’s Panorama of American Film Noir:\n\n“In its way of playing with official censorship, this eroticism [in noir] recalls the elaboration of the dream, according to Freud: instead of showing forbidden realities, one introduces seemingly neutral elements that will evoke them through association or symbolism. Thus dance is immemorial transposition of the sex act itself. But then the thriller has occasionally succeeded in employing such trite analogy with finesse. There are the ‘poses’ struck by Gilda or the frenzied whirling of the bobby-soxer in The Asphalt Jungle.”\n\nWhen Ann Savage’s Vera shoots you a look, it leaves exit wounds.\n\nHer fourth-wall-shattering stare into the camera—which seems to represent Al Roberts’s point-of-view—flies at the audience like an accusation, a castrating return of the male gaze. Or like a handful of rusty nails. Take your pick.\n\nAfter she’s sat there so still against the blur of the landscape through Roberts’s voice-over monologue, that slow turn of her head is almost uncanny.\n\nShe knows you’re judging her, audience. And she is pissed.\n\nI won’t print exactly what I think Vera’s saying with that look. Suffice to say, Vera can cuss with a glance. With a full-on glare, she hurls a fine and fragrant assortment of expletives.\n\nFrom the moment Vera gets into Roberts’s (stolen) car, we know she means trouble—yet there’s something engaging and, dare I say, appealing in her attitude, her gritty, run-down antagonism. Her incandescent rage imbues her with a proto-punk allure.\n\nRoberts opens the dialogue in neutral mode: “How far you goin’?” Vera spits the question back at him—the exact same words, now a dare. “How far you goin’?” She growls.\n\nUlmer presents this key exchange simply; the camera on the hood of the car shows the faces of both actors. However, whereas Roberts glances over at Vera when he delivers his line, she stares fixedly forward, a greasy strand of hair flapping over her face (like a Veronica Lake hairdo saturated in lard). Only after she’s spoken does Vera give Roberts a blast of her blowtorch-like side eye.\n\nFrom there Vera’s rage hijacks the movie, twisting it from a tale of destiny and lost love into a weirdly cathartic hostage situation. After we’ve spent half the movie with mopey loser Roberts, Vera’s rabid eyes and hardboiled ultimatums deliver giddy and surprising delights.\n\nHer sulfuric personality hits the audience like an injection of something they don’t carry at your local drugstore. She energizes the viewer, stinging him into caring more than he thought he could about a little PRC cheapie. Or maybe I should say the female viewer? Because I’d argue that Vera is a derailed vengeance fantasy for the put-upon broads of the world.\n\nNow, I realize that Edgar Ulmer personally loved the weak, self-defeating, Chopin-playing, Fate-blaming Roberts character and wanted us to sympathize with him. But who says spectators have to cooperate?\n\nAnd, furthermore, who says that a movie can’t be more complex and unstable in meaning than its director intended? Not me, that’s for sure. I never trust an auteur anyway.\n\nWe don’t find out what private hell Vera’s running away from or why she’s so damn angry. However, the smarmy shyster who picks up Rogers gives us a strong hint when he implies that giving Vera a lift entitled him to certain… rights. Rights which Vera challenged by taking a claw-ful of flesh out of the slimy driver’s hand.\n\nThis assault and defense has a creepy parallel in Ann Savage’s life. Once, when frequent co-star Tom Neal was trying to impress some friends of his who visited him on the set of an earlier film, Neal leaned in towards Savage, as if to say something, and stuck his tongue in her ear. Being the tough gal she was, Savage hauled off and slapped him. Quite hard, bless her. One can imagine that the incident added to the glee with which Savage persecutes Neal onscreen in Detour.\n\nIt’s as though all the anger and outrage that women have allowed to fester for millennia had condensed into a tiny nuclear core inside Vera, ready to explode Big Bang-like and bring the curtain down on the universe as we know it.\n\nYou get the feeling that Vera’s bottled up so much rage in her life that she could probably sell it as perfume—Eau So Pissed.\n\nAnn Savage plays Vera as a grunge fury, a filthy, greedy, feral, voracious, violent dame. She’s every man’s nightmare—a bad girl who behaves like a bad guy, who seems to have appropriated all the vices of the men she’s encountered.\n\nConsider her tipsy, freshly-bathed come-ons to Roberts, echoing the kind of sleazy talk she’s probably been on the receiving end of many times. Vera wants power in every sense. Heck, even her hair hogs the screen space, blocking Roberts as they quarrel in the diner parking lot. As Savage explained about the character, “She is mean. She wants to be boss. She’s a real B-I-T-C-H.”\n\nDuring an era that fetishized both domesticity and radiant glamour, Vera doesn’t cleanly fit into either of the patterns set out for her (then again, one could debate whether she does anything cleanly). She’s certainly not wife/mother material, nor is she a desirable bombshell in the femme fatale mold. Through Vera, Detour satirizes both roles for women and the social norms that go with them. It’s not hard to recognize Vera’s suffocating, guilty bond with Roberts as a parody of marriage.\n\nAnd, even when Vera’s all dolled up, nearly everything about her, from her blatant barking of orders to the way she daubs powder all over her face, clashes with the cool passive aggression of noir sirens like Kathie Moffats and Kitty Collins. Angry though they may be, some improbable code of ladylike behavior (or perhaps tragic apathy) constrains them from rebelling outright.\n\nBecause she fails to conform to either of society’s options for her, Vera lives on the margins of society. Our first glimpses of Vera reinforce her position as an outsider—she’s a speck through a windshield, then a hooker-like figure on the side of the frame as Roberts pumps gas.\n\nHer status as a hitchhiker, not particularly odd these days, would have shocked audiences in the 1940s. As Ann Savage remembered, “Women never hitchhiked rides. It was unheard of. Only the hobos did that, the men.” In other words, lowly though her existence is, Vera dwells in an undeniably male-dominated world and a largely untamed space.\n\nI consider Vera to be noir’s most subversive femme fatale, a repellent yet magnetic calamity of a woman whose unfettered ferocity makes us realize just how conventional so many other bad girls really were.\n\n“[Y]ou better not think about it.” Those are the last words of Hemingway’s “The Killers,” published in a 1927 issue of Scribner’s Magazine. The “it” referred to here is the death of Ole Anderson at the hands of his gangland assassins—a death to which he submits despite the chance to escape.\n\nBetter not think about it? The easygoing diner proprietor can give us all the sage advice he’d like. We know we won’t heed it. Are there some things we’d best not contemplate? Sure. But they’re often the things most worth thinking about—and the things we most want to think about, unhealthy though they are for us. (Hell, you’re the one who would read a story or watch a movie called “The Killers.” What were you expecting? A nursery rhyme?)\n\nNoir makes us think about the things we’d “better not think about.” It forces us to acknowledge the depravity lurking on the outskirts of (and sometimes smack dab in the middle of) normalcy. It catches the audience indulging its interest in the perverse… and thus reveals the audience’s own perversity.\n\nRobert Siodmak’s 1946 film The Killers spins a complex, flashback-driven tale of erotic obsession and crime, using Hemingway’s story as a kind of prelude. If you read the story, you can see that the dialogue in the film’s first 10 minutes was lifted almost word for word from the tense account of two big-city toughs waiting in a diner for their target.\n\nSo, what does cinema as a medium add to the text? Siodmak’s images explore the crevasse of subtext carved out between Hemingway’s lines.\n\nConsider the slick silhouettes of the two assassins, shadow men whose mere presence corrupts the sleepy berg of Brentwood, as they approach steadily, implacably under the credits. The appearance of the two killers has all the horrifying impact of a foreign invasion. (I daresay a number of emigrés, Siodmak included, would associate such an image with the relentless Gestapo agents who’d pursued them in Europe.)\n\nHemingway describes the killers as resembling “a vaudeville team.” By 1946, however, their laconic swagger brands them not as creatures of the stage but of the screen. They come from Noir Country—but the border isn’t as far away as we’d like to believe. Like bogeymen, the mugs you thought existed only on film might descend on your town, Siodmak seems to suggest. Don’t think to yourself, “It can’t happen here.” It can. It does.\n\nAt one point in the diner hold-up, William Conrad moves right past the camera, his bulk eclipsing our vision for a moment, antagonizing and disrespecting the viewer as he does the hapless small-town denizens he meets. He violates our personal space, as though coming out of the screen to bully us.\n\nOr let’s ponder those sensuous, borderline feminized shots of the ever-masochistic Swede, looking at the door of his room with something like longing, anticipating his violent death as though waiting for a lover. Attracted by the brutality of prizefighting then by a woman who labels herself as poison, Swede’s always had a death wish. But perhaps that’s something we’d better not think about.\n\nGetting is easy. Keeping is hard. That’s the lesson that parvenu mobster Shubunka (Barry Sullivan) learns as he loses his grip on the boardwalk empire he worked so hard to build. Why does he lose it? No big surprise there: ’twas beauty killed the beast.\n\nIn this case, the beauty happens to be the enigmatic chanteuse Shubunka obsessively romances—played, appropriately enough, by “Ice Maiden” Belita, a champion figure skater turned actress. The moment she appears onscreen, emerging from the bottom of the frame in a cascade of hair (an homage to Rita Hayworth’s famous Gilda entrance, I’d wager), she seems to erupt like a blonde volcano. We know she means death to Shubunka. He just can’t have nice things.\n\nNo, nice things are for nice people. Shubunka will always be mean. And although the end might justify the means, it can’t erase the meanness. Ironically, Shubunka’s rottenness comes from his aspirations towards something higher, towards the 5th Avenue gentility he longed for as a kid. The trouble is, the ruthlessness that it takes to get to the top has contaminated him, so that he’ll never really belong there.\n\nNoir likes to tear the American Dream to pieces the way a kid likes to tear the wings off bugs—for kicks. Burbling up from poverty row studio Monogram (well, actually its upwardly-mobile subsidiary, Allied Artists), The Gangster offers a rancid commentary on that dream. This underseen crime drama deserves a place among noir’s bitterest and most eloquent takedowns of the Horatio Alger myth. Prosperity is a rigged game, and victory lasts about as long a tart’s lipstick. If you lose, you lose for good. If you win, it’s only a matter of time until you slip.\n\nThe Gangster suggests that a self-made man makes himself for keeps. And what he makes is often damn hard to look at in the mirror every morning.\n\nThe first post-credits image of the movie confronts us with an ugly, menacing figure in the Goya-esque painting that hangs on Shubunka’s ritzy apartment wall. The brutish face in the picture becomes a major motif, reflecting the protagonist’s ugliness back to him. Indeed, the first lines of the film, “That was me,” spoken in voice-over, coincide with that shot, as though Shubunka were directly equating himself with the figure in the painting.\n\nIn The Gangster’s opening, camerawork also links the painting to Shubunka’s psychological state. The camera tracks out from a detail of the canvas—the ugly man’s face—to reveal the space of the apartment (and, because this is a Monogram movie, we get to see the fleeting shadow of the camera as it moves!). The next shot is Shubunka lying on his bed, alienated and alone, picking up a mirror to examine his disfigured cheek.\n\nLater, in a notable transition, a dissolve makes the parallel between the man in the painting and Shubunka quite explicit, shifting from a tight close-up of the gangster to the monstrous figure’s face. Throughout the film, Shubunka betrays a morbid anxiety about his appearance, accusing others of looking at the scar etched into the side of his cheek for his sins. Even as he reclines listlessly in his opulent digs, Shubunka’s grotesqueness haunts him through that picture.\n\nYes, despite (or perhaps because of?) his insecurities, Shubunka repeatedly rationalizes his gangland lifestyle and dismisses the victims of his racket though intense homilies, for instance:\n\n“Whaddya want me to do? Worry about the whole world? Let ’em rot. They don’t mean a thing to me. Don’t flinch at me. Don’t you dare look down at me. I’m no crumb, no cardie. I made somethin’ outta myself. And I’m proud of it.”\n\nShubunka delivers this peppy little motivational speech framed from below against the checkerboard ceiling of a soda joint he controls. The ceiling pattern is the same as the one on the floor, as though the world has been flipped and our sense of direction turned on its head. The top and the bottom are often interchangeable in The Gangster; you can take the boy out of the gutter but can you take the gutter out of him?\n\nThe gangster tends to deliver his angry monologues to a naïve cashier (Joan Lorring) who rejects his gifts of money and recoils from his ethics or lack thereof. This sweater-clad, squeaky-clean teenager largely serves as a surrogate for the audience. As Shubunka lectures her, he sometimes seems to be talking directly to the viewers, defending his ambition and dissecting his fatal flaw: he wasn’t rotten enough.\n\nThese exchanges between the bad guy and the good girl—all rhythmic, snappy cynicism on his part, all earnest indignation on hers—give the movie a morality play vibe. Will idealism stand up to experience? Superficially, yes, but the gangster has a point. His cutting logic sticks with us; against the realities of the world, just as ugly as Shubunka, the cashier girl’s syrupy, whining rebukes don’t stand a chance. (Speaking for myself, I wanted to slap her.)\n\nAmusingly enough, Shubunka talks like he ate a copy of Warshow’s “The Gangster as Tragic Hero” for breakfast and downed it with a shot of bootleg hooch. This not-so-tough mug’s slangy self-awareness actually deepened my sympathy for him. He’s a thinking man. That’s what makes it so hard to watch (and identify with) his decline. At times I found myself frantic over the inevitability that he’d wind up back in the gutter the crawled out of.\n\nThe greatest gangster movies of the 1930s let their audiences rejoice in the antiheroes’ giddy ascents before eventually gunning the outlaws down. Sure, we feel the gut punch dealt by the theatrical death throes of Cagney and company. Nevertheless, we’ve shared their reckless fun too viscerally to feel chastened to the core by their last-reel demises.The pleasure of the rise might be worth the agony of the fall.\n\nBy 1947, however, we’re dealing with a very different animal, one devoured by doubt and ennui. The Gangster is no rise, all fall.\n\nThe theme-heavy, over-articulate dialogue might feel phony in another film, but the stylized, richly detailed studio set gives this movie a pleasing artificiality echoed by the script. Shubunka’s turf, Neptune Beach, is an enclosed world, almost an intricate Build-Your-Own-Noir LEGO set.\n\nWith Akim Tamiroff, Sheldon Leonard, Charles McGraw, Elisha Cook, Jr., and Shelley Winters among the cast, The Gangster could also easily win film noir Bingo.\n\nWhatever you love about noir, this little-known gem has probably got it. Not only is The Gangster well worth your time, but the movie stands as a testament to the artistry that even a small-time studio could attain during Hollywood’s Golden Age."
