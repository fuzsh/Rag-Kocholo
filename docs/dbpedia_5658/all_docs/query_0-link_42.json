        "text": "Description of the video:\n\nRetro film begins playing while the narrator voices.\n\nJacob Wilson: Women have always played a large part in the success of Hollywood films, but since its infancy, the industry has historically been unfair to women and struggles to find equality even today.\n\nScreen shows infographic which reads: In 85 years, only 1 woman has won Best Director: Kathryn Bigelow for “The Hurt Locker” (2010). Percentage of writers and producers that are women: 1998: 13% of writers, 24% of producers; 2004: 12% of writers, 24% of producers; 2007: 10% of writers, 22% of producers; 2008: 12% of writers, 23% of producers; 2009: 8% of writers, 23% of producers; 2010: 10% of writers, 24% of producers; 2011: 14% of writers, 25% of producers; 2012: 15% of writers, 25% of producers. In the last 5 years, out of 4,475 speaking characters on-screen, only 28.4% have been female.\n\nJacob: Though, statistically, the present day is an improvement for women in industry, the numbers are still far from equal, and eye-opening revelations like the #MeToo movement show just how bad the environment can be for women even now.\n\nScreen shows news coverage, headlined “Harvey Weinstein in court: new indictment on sex assault charges to be unsealed.”\n\nJacob: So now I'd like to honor the women who have dealt with the worst Hollywood can offer: female editors.\n\nScreen shows black and white film of female editors. Shows images of the editors, followed by closeups of film canisters and cutting film.\n\nJacob: We will talk about the women on the ground floor of the Hollywood machine. These women were hired to construct and essentially stitch the film together. This is why women were often editors. The monotonous yet delicate task of cutting film together was seen more as a woman's job like sewing. Yet these women all rose to prominence in their craft and carved their names in cinema history as foremothers of the art of editing.\n\nScreen shows still of Margaret Booth at her desk and on the phone, pen in hand.\n\nJacob: Margaret Booth's film career started in 1915, which she was a patcher editing films for DW Griffith. But things really took off for Booth when in 1924 she worked for MGM as a director's assistant.\n\nScreen shows logo of Metro Foldwyn Mayer, a lion roaring in the middle of a circle of film.\n\nJacob: Booth edited a wide range of movies, including 1929's \"Wise Girls.\"\n\nScreen shows promotional still of “Wise Girls.”\n\nJacob: But it was 1935's \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" for which she was nominated for the Academy Award.\n\nScreen plays clip from “Mutiny on the Bounty: A man in a pirate outfit enters the room. The group talks, with the following dialogue: \"Follow me, please.\" \"So Joseph, for that, they've reached a verdict. Watch the dirk.\" \"The dirk?\" \"The midshipman's dirk will be lying on the table before Lord Hood. If it lies crosswise, you've been acquitted. If the point lies toward you, you've been condemned. God be with you.\"\n\nJacob: Perhaps her most recognizable work was when she was supervising editor on the 1982 classic, \"Annie.\"\n\nScreen plays clip from “Annie.” A young redhaired girl is seen speaking to an older man. Dialogue follows: \"There's this song I used to sing in the orphanage when I'd get sad. It always cheered me up.

Bauchens is most noted for her 40-year collaboration with director Cecil deMille.\n\nScreen shows Bachens with deMille, each looking at and smiling at the either.\n\nJacob: It was famed director deMille that taught her to edit to begin with. Bauchens made history in 1940 when she won the Academy Award for \"North West Mounted Police\" and became the first woman to win an Oscar in that category.\n\nScreen shows deMille and Bachens with the award.\n\nScreen plays clip from “North West Mounted Police,” showing two men in the woods.

Screen plays clip from “12 O’Clock High.”\n\nJacob: Together, they'd do over 29 films together, including 1949's classic, \"12 O'Clock High,\" showing airplanes in the sky.\n\nJacob: McLean received seven nominations for best editing, including her nomination for 1950's \"All about Eve.\"\n\nScreen shows clip from “All Above Eve.” A woman stands on the stairs in an evening gown.

Over a five-decade long career, she won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing in 1958 for \"GiGi.\"\n\nScreen shows promotion for “GiGi.”\n\nJacob: But it was musical classics like \"Anchors Aweigh\" and \"Singing in the Rain\" that cemented Fazan in cinema history.\n\nScreen plays clip of “Singing in the Rain,” showing a man skipping down a street in a thunderstorm. Dialogue: \"I'm singing in the rain, yes, singing in the rain.\" What a glorious feeling, I'm happy again, I'm laughing at clouds. So dark up above, the sun's in my heart, and I'm ready for love.\"\n\nScreen shows photograph of Dede Allen.\n\nJacob: Dede Allen worked her way up through Columbia Pictures, working several jobs before becoming an assistant film editor. In her edits, Allen brought style and emotion to the films, such as 1967's \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" 1975's \"Dog Day Afternoon\" and 1961's \"The Hustler.\" \"\n\nScreen shows promotion of “Bonnie and Clyde.” Screen shows promotion of “Dog Day Afternoon.” Screen plays clip from “The Hustler.” A man is playing pool in a bar while another suited man watches.

She did say to me, 'I'm here to stop you embarrassing yourself.' She's got a much lower boredom threshold than I have, so she'll get very bored with repetition. And it's not just stringing whole bits of action together because it can become very boring. It's looking for some very strong causal connection.

Dialogue: \"What are you doing? You don't need the money and they will catch you.\" \"I haven't needed the money since I took Archie's milk money in the third grade. Tell you the true, I don't need pussy anymore either. But I like it. Point I'm making here is I got this rat, right, this gnawing, cheese- eating, fucking rat, right? And it brings up questions. See, Bill, you're the new guy and the girlfriend. Why don't you stay in the bar when I go get your numbers. Social security numbers. Everybody's fucking numbers.\" \"Is there just something that you just want to go ahead and ask me because I'll give you the fucking answer, all right? Frank, look at me. Look at me.

Think about it. You don't pay much, you know, it's almost a fucking feudal enterprise. The question is — and this is the only question: Who thinks that they can do what you do better than you?\" \"The only one who can do what I do is me. Do you know how many people had to die for me to be me. You want to be me?\" \"I probably could be you. Yeah. Yeah. I know that much. But I don’t want to be you, Frank. I don't want to be you.\" \"Heavy lies the crown sort of thing.\"\n\nScreen plays rotating photos of the aforementioned women and films.\n\nJacob: All these women and many more are the unsung heroes to your favorite films.

It is important to remember and appreciate these women for the editors in cinema that they are."
