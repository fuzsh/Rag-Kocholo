        "text": "Novels and essays\n\nFor some two decades before 1900, political and social unrest grew in Spain, conditions that inspired Ángel Ganivet’s influential Idearium español (1897; Spain, an Interpretation), which analyzed Spanish character. The Spanish empire, founded in 1492, ended with defeat in the Spanish-American War of 1898, which prompted Spanish intellectuals to diagnose their country’s ills and to seek ways to jolt the nation out of what they perceived to be its abulia (lack of will). The novel acquired new seriousness, and critical, psychological, and philosophical essays gained unprecedented importance. Novelists and essayists constituted what Azorín (pseudonym of José Martínez Ruiz) named the Generation of 1898, today considered an “Age of Silver,” second only to Spain’s Siglo de Oro (Golden Age).\n\nMiguel de Unamuno studied national problems perceptively in En torno al casticismo (1895), a collection of essays whose title—which means, roughly, “Concerning Spanishness”—reflects its analysis of the “essence” of Spanish national identity. In Vida de Don Quijote y Sancho (1905; The Life of Don Quixote and Sancho) Unamuno explored the same subject by way of an examination of Cervantes’s fictional characters. He despairingly questioned immortality in his most important work, Del sentimiento trágico de la vida (1913; The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Peoples). A provocative, somewhat unsystematic thinker, Unamuno aimed at sowing spiritual disquiet. The novel became his medium for exploring personality, as in Niebla (1914; Mist), Abel Sánchez (1917), and Tres novelas ejemplares y un prólogo (1920; “Three Cautionary Tales and a Prologue”), with his final spiritual position—Kierkegaardian existentialism—revealed in San Manuel Bueno, mártir (1933; “San Manuel Bueno, Martyr”). Unamuno was an influential journalist and an unsuccessful but powerful dramatist who also ranks among Spain’s greatest 20th-century poets.\n\nIn novels such as Don Juan (1922) and Doña Inés (1925), Azorín created retrospective, introspective, and nearly motionless narratives that shared many of the qualities of works by his contemporary Marcel Proust. Azorín’s essays—in El alma castellana (1900; “The Castilian Soul”), La ruta de Don Quijote (1905; “Don Quixote’s Route”), Castilla (1912), and numerous additional volumes—reinterpreted and sought to eternalize earlier literary values and visions of rural Spain. An artistic critic and sensitive miniaturist, he excelled in precision and ekphrasis (description of a visual work of art). Philosopher José Ortega y Gasset developed themes from criticism and psychology (Meditaciones del Quijote [1914; “Meditations on Quixote”]) to national problems (España invertebrada [1921; Invertebrate Spain]) and international concerns (El tema de nuestro tiempo [1923; The Modern Theme], La rebelión de las masas [1929; The Revolt of the Masses]). He and Unamuno were Spain’s intellectual leaders during the first half of the 20th century.\n\nNovelist Pío Baroja repudiated tradition, religion, and most forms of social organization and government, initially advocating something approaching anarchism but later turning more conservative. A neonaturalist, he saw the world as a cruel place, and many of his works—including the trilogies La raza (1908–11; “The Race”) and La lucha por la vida (1903–04; “The Struggle for Life”) and the two-part Agonías de nuestro tiempo (1926; “Agonies of Our Time”)—portray squalid, subhuman conditions, prostitutes and criminals, and ignorance and disease. His most-read work is El árbol de la ciencia (1911; The Tree of Knowledge), which tells the story of the education of the protagonist, a medical student; it depicts the shortcomings of those teaching medicine, the callousness of many doctors treating Spanish society’s most vulnerable, and the abject poverty and filth in the village where the protagonist first practices. Baroja also wrote adventure novels that glorified the “man of action,” a type that recurs throughout his novels. In his later works he experimented with Impressionism and Surrealism.\n\nSometimes omitted from the Generation of 1898, given his Modernist beginnings, Ramón María del Valle-Inclán—a poet, journalist, essayist, short-story writer, and profoundly influential dramatist and novelist—suffered critical neglect following his death in 1936 when the Francisco Franco regime prohibited studies of Republican writers. The three stages of his literary evolution exhibit radical aesthetic change, beginning with exquisite, sometimes decadent, erotic Modernista tales, as in his four Sonatas (1902–05; Eng. trans. The Pleasant Memoirs of the Marquis de Bradomin: Four Sonatas). Each represents a season (of the year and of human life) corresponding to the youth, plenitude, maturity, and old age of the narrator, a decadent Don Juan; intertextual allusions, nostalgia for an idealized past, aristocratic posing, melancholy, underlying parody, and humour abound. The trilogy Comedias bárbaras (1907, 1908, 1923), set in an anachronistic, semifeudal Galicia and linked by a single protagonist, is in dialogue form, which gives these novels the feel of impossibly long cinematographic dramas. This series initiated Valle’s aesthetic movement away from Modernismo’s quest for beauty, which continued with his violent trilogy (1908–09) on the 19th-century Carlist wars (see Carlism). Valle’s third artistic stage, characterized by his invention of the esperpento style, is expressionistic, involving deliberate distortion and calculated inversion of heroic models and values. “Esperpentic” visions appear in the novels Tirano Banderas (1926; Eng. trans. The Tyrant), La corte de los milagros (1927; “The Court of Miracles”), and Viva mi dueño (1928; “Long Live My Lord”), the last two belonging to another trilogy, El ruedo ibérico (“The Iberian Cycle”). Valle’s works usually treat his native Galicia; Tirano Banderas, satirizing desultory revolutions and set in a fictional Latin American country, is sometimes considered his masterpiece.\n\nWomen poets\n\nSeveral significant women poets belong chronologically to the Generation of 1927, including Rosa Chacel, a major essayist, poet, and novelist. Her polished, intellectual verse appeared in A la orilla de un pozo (1936; At the Edge of a Well), a collection of neo-Gongoristic sonnets, and in Versos prohibidos (1978; “Prohibited Verse”), a mixture of unrhymed pieces that resemble in their metre blank verse and alexandrines and in their form epistles, sonnets, and odes. Frequent themes are philosophical inspiration, faith, religiosity, separation, menace (echoing the Civil War), friendships, and her wanderings. Concha Méndez published four major poetry collections before the Civil War drove her into exile. Drawing upon traditional popular forms and the oral tradition, Méndez’s prewar poetry—such as that in Vida a vida (1932; “Life to Life”)—exudes optimism and vitality, recalling the neopopular airs of Lorca and Alberti. Her exile poetry expresses pessimism, loss, violence, horror, anguish, uncertainty, and pain (e.g., Lluvias enlazadas [1939; “Interlaced Rains”]). Her last book was Vida; o, río (1979; “Life; or, The River”). Marina Romero Serrano spent three decades in exile in the United States teaching Spanish and writing poetry, critical works, and children’s books. Nostalgia de mañana (1943; “Nostalgia for Tomorrow”) reflects her generation’s predilection for traditional metrics; her other works represent pure poetry and avoid the confessional and autobiographical mode. Her most personal collection, Honda raíz (1989; “Deep Roots”), treats lost love remembered, moving from joy to loss and infinite longing.\n\nErnestina de Champourcin published four volumes of exuberant, personal, intellectual poetry before going into exile (1936–72) with her husband, José Domenchina, a minor poet of the Generation of 1927. Presencia a oscuras (1952; “Presence in Darkness”) reacted to the marginality she felt while in exile and commenced a spiritual quest intensified by Domenchina’s death in 1959. El nombre que me diste (1960; “The Name You Gave Me”), Cartas cerradas (1968; “Sealed Letters”), and Poemas del ser y estar (1972; “Poems of Being and State”), collected with poetry written 1972–91, appeared as Poesía a través del tiempo (1991; “Poetry Across Time”). Characterizing her mature writing are religious preoccupations and mystic language. Champourcin ranks with the truly significant poets of her generation. Lesser figures include Pilar de Valderrama and Josefina de la Torre.\n\nCarmen Conde Abellán, a socialist and Republican supporter, suffered postwar “internal exile” in Spain while her husband was a political prisoner. She was contemporaneous with and involved in Surrealism, Ultraism, and prewar experimentation with prose poems, but she is rarely included with the Generation of 1927; her preoccupation with issues of social justice—especially education of the poor—is often taken as a pretext for this exclusion, even though survivors of that generation remaining in Spain also produced “social” poetry. A novelist, memorialist, biographer, anthologist, critic, archivist, and author of juvenile fiction, Conde published nearly 100 titles, including nine novels and several plays. She became the first woman elected to the Royal Spanish Academy (1978) and was the most honoured woman of her generation. Conde assiduously cultivated poetry’s universal themes: love, suffering, nature, dreams, memory, solitude, death, estrangement, religious questing, grief. Her most important works include Ansia de la gracia (1945; “Longing for Grace”) and Mujer sin Edén (1947; Woman Without Eden). The latter implicitly equated the fall of the Spanish Republican government with the Fall of Man, also using Cain and Abel motifs to symbolize the country’s Civil War. Slightly younger, María Concepción Zardoya González, who wrote under the name Concha Zardoya, published 25 poetry collections between 1946 and 1987. She was born in Chile of Spanish parents and lived in Spain in the 1930s; she later spent three decades in the United States before returning in 1977 to Spain, where she remained until her death. Rich in personal experience and spiritual intimacy, her poetry ranks among the best women’s lyrics in 20th-century Spain; it records a personal history of war and loss, exile and nostalgia, pain, solitude, and existential doubt.\n\nThe novel\n\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936–39) drove into political exile some promising novelists whose narrative art matured abroad. Max Aub analyzed the civil conflict in the artistically and thematically impressive cycle of novels El laberinto mágico (1943–68; “The Magic Labyrinth”). Ramón José Sender, whose pre-Civil War novels had been realistic and overtly sociopolitical, developed an interest in the mysterious and irrational. While Crónica del alba (1942–66; “Chronicle of the Dawn”), a series of novels, dwelt realistically on the Civil War, the magical, myth-dominated worlds of Epitalamio del prieto Trinidad (1942; Dark Wedding) and Las criaturas saturnianas (1968; “Saturnine Beings”) reflected more universal concerns. Prolific, tendentious, opinionated, and arbitrary, Sender produced some 70 novels of unequal quality, the most esteemed being Mosén Millán (1953; later published as Réquiem por un campesino español; Eng. trans. Requiem for a Spanish Peasant). After more than three decades in exile, Sender returned to Spain to a hero’s welcome from younger compatriots. The diplomat, legal scholar, and critic Francisco Ayala showed a youthful vanguardism early in his career; in later short stories (the collections Los usurpadores [1949; Usurpers] and La cabeza del cordero [1949; “The Lamb’s Head”]) and novels (Muertes de perro [1958; Death as a Way of Life, 1964] and its sequel El fondo del vaso [1962; “In the Bottom of the Glass”]), he cultivated themes that allowed him to obliquely re-create aspects of the Civil War as well as to address more-universal social concerns. These works offer devastating appraisals of the Spanish political scene from multiple perspectives and with complex narrative techniques. Considered by some to be the best prose writer of his era in the Spanish language, Ayala has published many volumes of essays on philosophy, pedagogy, sociology, and political theory.\n\nThe Civil War decimated Spanish intellectuals, artists, and writers, and the country’s culture went into decline, uninterrupted by a brief spate of triunfalismo (“triumphalism”) that lasted through the 1940s, when the victorious Falange, the Spanish fascist party, engaged in propagandistic self-glorification. Triunfalismo’s literary expression produced works that were monothematic and repetitive and that insulted the vanquished, showing them as animals. Psychologically perceptive despite its violence, La familia de Pascual Duarte (1942; The Family of Pascual Duarte) of Camilo José Cela popularized a harsh, sordid, unsentimental realism (tempered by expressionistic distortion) known as tremendismo. Continuing his literary experimentation, Cela attained greater technical heights in La colmena (1951; The Hive), portraying divided Madrid society during the harsh winter of 1941–42. By his death, in 2002, Cela—who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1989—had published by his own count more than 100 books, including a dozen novels, numerous story collections, travel books, critical essays, poetry, and literary sketches. Joining Cela in reviving Spanish fiction during the 1940s was Carmen Laforet, whose Nada (1945, “Nothing”; Eng. trans. Andrea), with its bewildered adolescent’s perspective of war’s aftermath, became an instant best seller.\n\nThe sociopolitical trauma of civil conflict with its cultural and economic uncertainty revived outmoded forms of realism. Conservative craftsmen such as Juan Antonio de Zunzunegui and Ignacio Agustí produced conventional realistic novels. José María Gironella scored great popular success with his controversial epic trilogy on the Civil War: Los cipreses creen en Dios (1953; The Cypresses Believe in God), Un millón de muertos (1961; The Million Dead), and Ha estallado la paz (1966; Peace After War).\n\nA second postwar current, “social literature,” or “critical realism,” arrived with the so-called Midcentury Generation, who were adolescents during the war; it expressed more vigorous, if necessarily covert, opposition to the dictatorship. In such works as La hoja roja (1959; “The Red Leaf”), which examines poverty and loneliness among the elderly, and Las ratas (1962; “Rats”; Eng. trans. Smoke on the Ground), which depicts the miserable existence of uneducated cave dwellers, Miguel Delibes conveyed critical concern for a society whose natural values are under constant threat. Greater technical expertise and thematic originality are evinced in his Cinco horas con Mario (1966; “Five Hours with Mario”), a powerful novel wherein domestic conflict represents contending ideologies in the Civil War, and Parábola del náufrago (1969; “Parable of the Shipwrecked Man”), which examines the individual’s plight in a dehumanized technocracy. A publisher, lawyer, teacher, and journalist, Delibes was the author of more than 50 volumes of novels, memoirs, essays, and travel and hunting books and received the prestigious Cervantes Prize in 1993. El hereje (1998; The Heretic), perhaps his masterpiece, depicts the abuse of power by the Spanish Inquisition. Elena Quiroga, a conscientious stylist, experimented with varying forms and themes, employing a dead protagonist in Algo pasa en la calle (1954; “Something’s Happening in the Street”) to examine domestic conflict aggravated by Franco’s outlawing of divorce. Quiroga’s novels typically portrayed women and children. Her crowning achievement is the novelistic cycle of Tadea: Tristura (1960; “Sadness”), Escribo tu nombre (1965; “I Write Your Name”), and Se acabó todo, muchacha triste (“It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue”), begun in the late 1960s but left unfinished at Quiroga’s death in 1995. The cycle portrays the difficulties of growing up female under Franco through the character Tadea, the novels’ protagonist. In 1983 Quiroga became the second woman elected to the Royal Spanish Academy. Social realism also characterizes the largely testimonial, semiautobiographical novels of Dolores Medio, who frequently depicted working girls, schoolteachers, and aspiring writers as positive feminine role models opposing the dictatorship’s discouragement of education for women: Nosotros los Rivero (1952; “We Riveros”), El pez sigue flotando (1959; “The Fish Stays Afloat”), Diario de una maestra (1961; “A Schoolteacher’s Diary”).\n\nOften deprived of access to 19th-century realist and naturalist models, some post-Civil War writers reinvented these modes. Others more closely followed (usually via translations) the Italian Neorealists or the theories of Hungarian critic György Lukács in his The Historical Novel (1955). The Spanish Neorealistic variants with their testimonial thrust subjected aesthetic considerations to their content, exhibiting the pedestrian style, simplistic techniques, and repetitive themes traditionally attributed to engagé (socially committed) literature.\n\nDuring the 1950s, several competent, committed younger novelists strengthened intellectual dissent. Ana María Matute, among the most honoured novelists of her generation, typically employed lyric and expressionistic style with fictions set in mountainous areas of Old Castile, as in Los hijos muertos (1958; The Lost Children), which sought to reconcile war-born hatreds by showing irreparable losses on both sides. Her trilogy Los mercaderes (“The Merchants”)—Primera memoria (1959; School of the Sun, also published as The Awakening), Los soldados lloran de noche (1964; Soldiers Cry by Night), and La trampa (1969; The Trap)—divides humanity into heroes (considered idealists and martyrs) and merchants (motivated only by money). Matute’s greatest popular success, Olvidado rey Gudú (1996; “Forgotten King Gudú”), is an antiwar statement disguised as a neochivalric adventure. Juan Goytisolo, long an expatriate in France and Morocco, moved from an impassive, cinematographic style in his fiction of the 1950s and early 1960s to New Novel experimentalism in his Mendiola trilogy—Señas de identidad (1966; Marks of Identity), Reivindicación del conde don Julián (1970; Count Julian), and Juan sin tierra (1975; Juan the Landless), all filled with literary borrowings, shifting narrative perspectives, nonlinear chronology, neo-Baroque complexities of plot, and an emphasis upon language rather than action. His brother Luis Goytisolo, a novelist and short-story writer, dissected the Catalan bourgeoisie and chronicled Barcelona’s history from the war through the Franco years. His most significant accomplishment, his tetralogy Antagonía, comprises Recuento (1973; “Recounting”), Los verdes de mayo hasta el mar (1976; “May’s Greenery as Far as the Sea”), La cólera de Aquiles (1979; “The Rage of Achilles”), and Teoría del conocimiento (1981; “Theory of Knowledge”), which reveal him as a consummate practitioner of metafiction, pushing the limits of the self-conscious novel while destroying Francoist myths and creating new, liberating ones. Rafael Sánchez Ferlosio’s El Jarama (1956; “The Jarama”; Eng. trans. The One Day of the Week), masterfully utilizing pseudoscientific impassivity and cinematographic techniques, depicts the monotonous existence of urban youth via their aimless conversations and exposes postwar apathy. Other young writers who first emerged in the 1950s were Jesús Fernández Santos, Juan García Hortelano, Jesús López Pacheco, and Daniel Sueiro.\n\nBy the 1960s, gray, pedestrian critical realism had run its course. Luis Martín-Santos broke the mold with his epoch-making Tiempo de silencio (1962; Time of Silence), which revisited the familiar topic of life in post-Civil War Spain via conscious artistry, psychoanalytic perspectives, and narrative techniques—such as stream of consciousness and interior monologue—that echoed James Joyce. Had Martín-Santos not died at age 39, Spanish fiction in the 1970s and ’80s might have reached greater heights. Ignacio Aldecoa was the most gifted short-story writer of his generation and among the most talented exponents of objectivism with his novels Gran sol (1957; “Great Sole”) and Parte de una historia (1967; “Part of a Story”). Significant innovation appears in Juan Benet Goitia, a novelist, critic, dramatist, and short-story writer whose Volverás a Región (1967; “You Will Return to Región”) combined density of form, myth and allegory presented in tangled neo-Baroque syntax and lexicon, and scathing sarcasm. These features were typical of the numerous subsequent novels of his Región series. Described in minute topographical detail, Benet’s Región is an area that resembles Spain’s northern mountains, perhaps León. It is isolated, almost inaccessible, and terribly provincial; critics have seen it as a microcosm of Spain. Preferring British and American paradigms that devoted more attention to style, subjectivity, and psychological narrative than did the dominant trends in Spanish literature of the period, Benet condemned costumbrismo and social realism as unimaginative. Carmen Martín Gaite, a gifted observer of contemporary mores and a methodical observer of gender roles and conflicts, portrayed the constraints upon women in patriarchal societies. Her novels, from Entre visillos (1958; Behind the Curtains) to El cuarto de atrás (1978; The Back Room) and La reina de las nieves (1994; “Snow Queen”; Eng. trans. The Farewell Angel), trace the consequences of social conditions in Franco society on individuals. She also documented these conditions in essays such as Usos amorosos de la postguerra española (1987; Courtship Customs in Postwar Spain), which describes the ideological indoctrination to which the Falange subjected girls and young women. Although he published his first novel in 1943, Gonzalo Torrente Ballester came to prominence only in the 1970s. He moved from Joycean models to realism to fantasy before achieving astounding success with his metaliterary, postmodern romps La saga/fuga de J.B. (1972; “J.B.’s Flight and Fugue”) and Fragmentos de apocalipsis (1977; “Fragments of Apocalypse”). He received the Cervantes Prize in 1985.\n\nEstablished writers of the Franco era continued producing until the new millennium—Cela, Delibes, Matute, Martín Gaite, Torrente, the Goytisolos—nearly all evolving and reflecting the impact of postmodernism, with some writing in the New Novel mode. During the 1980s and 1990s, new fictional paradigms emerged as exiles returned; new subgenres included detective fiction, a feminine neo-Gothic novel, science fiction, adventure novels, and the thriller. Despite this proliferation of modes, many novelists continued producing what might be considered “traditional” narrative. José Jiménez Lozano investigates Inquisitorial repression, recondite religious issues, and esoteric historical themes drawn from a variety of cultures in such novels as Historia de un otoño (1971; “History of Autumn”) and El sambenito (1972; “The Saffron Tunic”). He received the Cervantes Prize in 2002, as had Delibes (1993) and Cela (1995) before him. Francisco Umbral, a prolific journalist, novelist, and essayist often compared to 17th-century satirist Francisco Gómez de Quevedo y Villegas for his style and to 19th-century journalist Mariano José de Larra for his biting critiques of contemporary society, won the Cervantes Prize in 2000.\n\nThe Generation of 1968 was recognized in the 1980s as a distinct novelistic group. It includes Esther Tusquets, Álvaro Pombo, and Javier Tomeo, together with nearly a dozen others who belong to this group chronologically if not by reason of aesthetic or thematic similarities. Tusquets is best known for a trilogy of thematically related but independent novels: El mismo mar de todos los veranos (1978; The Same Sea As Every Summer), El amor es un juego solitario (1979; Love Is a Solitary Game), and Varada tras el último naufragio (1980; “Beached After the Last Shipwreck”; Eng. trans. Stranded), all of which explore the solitude of middle-aged women and their deceptions in love. Pombo, originally known as a poet, turned later to the novel; El metro de platino iradiado (1990; “The Metre of Irradiated Platinum”) is considered by many his masterpiece. He was elected to the Spanish Academy in 2004. Tomeo is an Aragonese essayist, dramatist, and novelist whose works, with their strange, solitary characters, emphasize that “normal” is but a theoretical concept. His novels include Amado monstruo (1985; Dear Monster) and Napoleón VII (1999). He is also known for his short stories, anthologized in Los nuevos inquisidores (2004; “The New Inquisitors”).\n\nTheatre\n\nPost-Civil War Spain suffered no lack of skillful playwrights to provide politically acceptable entertainment; Edgar Neville, José López Rubio, Víctor Ruiz Iriarte, Miguel Mihura, and Alfonso Paso added variety to the ingenious, parodic farces of Enrique Jardiel Poncela and the soul-searching dramas of Alejandro Casona and Joaquín Calvo Sotelo. The period’s most significant dramatist was Antonio Buero Vallejo, a former political prisoner; Historia de una escalera (1949; The Story of a Stairway), a symbolic social drama, marks the rebirth of Spanish theatre after the war. Subtle and imaginative, Buero used myth, history, and contemporary life as dramatic metaphors to explore and critique society in such works as En la ardiente oscuridad (1950; In the Burning Darkness), Un soñador para un pueblo (1958; “A Dreamer for a People”), and El concierto de San Ovidio (1962; The Concert at Saint Ovide, 1967). Later works exhibit increased philosophical, political, and metaphysical concerns: Aventura en lo gris (1963; “Adventure in Gray”), El tragaluz (1967; “The Skylight”), El sueño de la razón (1970; The Sleep of Reason), and La fundación (1974; The Foundation). Written in the 1960s, La doble historia del doctor Valmy (“The Double Case History of Doctor Valmy”) was performed in Spain for the first time in 1976; the play’s political content made it too controversial to stage there during Franco’s rule. Alfonso Sastre rejected Buero’s formula, preferring more-direct Marxist approaches to social problems, but censors prohibited many of his dramas. A dramatic theorist and existentialist, Sastre in his works presents individuals ensnared in Kafkaesque bureaucratic structures, struggling but failing while the struggle itself endures and advances (as exemplified in Cuatro dramas de la revolución [1963; “Four Revolutionary Dramas”]). Sastre’s first major production, Escuadra hacia la muerte (1953; Death Squad), a disturbing Cold War drama, presents soldiers who have been accused of “unpardonable” offenses and condemned to stand guard in a no-man’s-land where they await the advance of an unknown enemy and face almost certain death. Other plays demonstrate the socially committed individual’s duty to sacrifice personal feeling for the sake of revolution (El pan de todos [1957; “The Bread of All”], Guillermo Tell tiene los ojos tristes [1960; Sad Are the Eyes of William Tell]).\n\nSastre’s plays are examples of the social realism practiced by the Grupo Realista (Realist Group) during the 1950s and ’60s. Epitomizing this group’s realist style is Lauro Olmo’s La camisa (1962; The Shirt), which depicts unemployed workers too poverty-stricken to seek employment because doing so requires a clean shirt. Like the social novel, social theatre featured generic or collective protagonists, economic injustices, and social-class conflicts, their depictions calculated to suggest Franco’s responsibility for the exploitation and suffering of the underprivileged. Carlos Muñiz Higuera’s plays convey social protests via expressionist techniques: El grillo (1957; “The Cricket”) portrays the plight of an office worker who is perpetually overlooked for promotion, and El tintero (1961; “The Inkwell”) depicts a humble office worker driven to suicide by a dehumanized bureaucracy. Muñiz Higuera depicts individuals who must adapt to dominant reactionary values or be destroyed; his work recalls Valle-Inclán’s esperpento manner and German playwright Bertolt Brecht’s epic theatre. Other exponents of social-protest theater include José Martín Recuerda, whose subject matter is hypocrisy, cruelty, and repression in Andalusian towns and villages, and José María Rodríguez Méndez, a novelist, story writer, essayist, and critic whose dramas expose the plight of common people, especially the youth, portrayed as victims (soldiers recruited to serve as cannon fodder, students forced to compete in sordid, degrading conditions for posts in a dehumanizing system). Long-censored members of the Realist Group were compared to contemporaneous British playwrights and novelists called the Angry Young Men.\n\nThe Silenced Group, also called the Underground Theatre (Teatro Subterráneo), includes playwrights repeatedly censored under Franco and avoided thereafter by the theatrical establishment for their radically subversive political allegories questioning the legitimacy of power, capitalism, and other “contemporary fundamentals.” Their extravagant farces and mordant satires demythologized Spain and its “glorious” past. This group includes Antonio Martínez Ballesteros, Manuel Martínez Mediero, José Ruibal, Eduardo Quiles, Francisco Nieva, Luis Matilla, and Luis Riaza.\n\nAntonio Gala, a multitalented, original, and commercially successful playwright, debunked historical myths while commenting allegorically on contemporary Spain via expressionistic humour and comedy. Jaime Salom, like Gala, defies ideological classification. His psychological drama of the Spanish Civil War, La casa de las Chivas (1968; “House of the Chivas”), holds Madrid box-office records. His later works pose political, social, or religious questions; La piel del limón (1976; “Bitter Lemon”), a plea for divorce reform, was among the longest-running plays of the 1970s. Salom is often compared to Buero Vallejo and American playwright Arthur Miller. The most important woman dramatist of the last decades of the 20th century, Ana Diosdado, gained national recognition with Olvida los tambores (1970; “Forget the Drums”). Other woman dramatists are Paloma Pedrero, Pilar Enciso, Lidia Falcón, Maribel Lázaro, Carmen Resino, and María Manuela Reina.\n\nSome relaxation of censorship in the 1960s prompted interest in the Theatre of the Absurd, its main exponent in Spain being longtime expatriate Fernando Arrabal, a playwright, novelist, and filmmaker who has drawn some of the raw material for his works from his traumatic childhood. Critics have identified a violent resentment of his conservative, pro-Franco mother and innumerable Freudian complexes in Arrabal’s plays, and his childlike characters—both innocent and criminal, tender and sadistic, all existing within a Kafkaesque atmosphere—afford these plays enormous individuality. Using black humour and grotesque and Surrealist elements, Arrabal creates nightmarish works.\n\nFollowing Franco’s death, several new, younger dramatists gained recognition in the 1980s. Acclaimed by critics and audiences alike were Fernando Fernán Gómez, Fermín Cabal, and Luis Alonso de Santos. Replete with intertextual references and cinematographic staging techniques, these playwrights’ works treat contemporary problems but approach them more playfully than their socially committed predecessors. Other playwrights who emerged in the closing years of the 20th century include Miguel Romeo Esteo, Francisco Rojas Zorrilla, Angel García Pintado, Marcial Suárez, Jerónimo López Mozo, Domingo Miras, and Alberto Miralles."
