        "text": "Most people know Jiraiya, Tsunade and Orochimaru from the Naruto series. But did you know that these characters were originally from “Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari”, a 200-year-old folklore?\n\nHere are the origins, story, character profile and early movies of Jiraiya, Tsunade and Orochimaru.\n\nOrigins of Jiraiya, Tsunade & Orochimaru\n\nJiraiya Goketsu Monogatari (児雷也豪傑物語; “The Heroic Tales of Jiraiya” or “Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya”) was first published in 1839. Over the next 29 years (till 1868), it became a popular series of 43 illustrated novels completed by 4 different authors.\n\nIf you thought Naruto was draggy, this story took 10 years longer to complete.\n\nYet, the inspiration for Jiraiya has its origins in old legends in Song-era China. This bandit, whose real name is unknown, was a heroic bandit whose deeds were similar to Robin Hood. The only reason he was called 自来也 (zi lai ye – Mandarin Chinese pronunciation), was because he’d leave those characters in graffiti at places he robbed. Those characters translate to: “I was here”.\n\nWhen that bandit legend made it to the Japanese novel, elements of shape-shifting magic and ninja mysticism were added. The Japanese Jiraiya’s name in kanji later became 児雷也 (young thunder).\n\nSo, after the series was completed, part of the story was adapted for the Kabuki theatre in 1852.\n\nHere is the Kabuki version of The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya. Enjoy this Japanese ninja folklore…\n\nStory Time: The Tale of The Gallant Jiraiya\n\nIn this kabuki summary, the demonic giant snake spirit was the cause of misery for the Tsukikage, Ogata and Matsuura clans – in which Orochimaru (大蛇丸), Jiraiya (自来也 or 児雷也) and Tsunade (綱手) belonged to respectively.\n\nA long time ago, there existed an evil giant snake spirit that preyed on humans. This demonic snake spirit had ambitions to gain power over all of Japan.\n\nFor that to happen, it decided to take control of the influential Tsukikage clan, whose feudal domain was Echigo province. Their leader – Tsukikage Gunryo Miyukinosuke – was also the regent of the Shogunate (feudal government of Japan) and crucial to the evil snake’s plan.\n\nThe Giant Snake Spirit takes over the Tsukikage Clan\n\nOn that fateful day, the snake spirit attacked Lord Tsukikage Miyukinosuke. Had it not been for Orochimaru who came out of nowhere to intervene, the lord of Echigo and regent would have died.\n\nTherefore, out of indebtedness, Lord Miyukinosuke adopted Orochimaru as a son. This was a huge mistake for it sealed the fate of the Tsukikage, Ogata and Matsuura clans.\n\nUnbeknownst to Lord Miyukinosuke, the demonic snake spirit had possessed Orochimaru and he was merely a puppet from the start. The snake spirit and Orochimaru had staged the attack and rescue. And the lord of Echigo effectively adopted the evil snake into his clan.\n\nOver time, the snake manipulated the lord into murdering all of his offspring, leaving Orochimaru as his sole successor.\n\nMassacre of the Ogata & Matsuura clans\n\nThe Ogata and Matsuura clans held two powerful seals (i.e. insignia stamps) in trust for the feudal government. Documents marked by these seals were proof of the Shogun’s support to raise an army and navy fleet.\n\nThe giant snake spirit wanted the power afforded by those seals and needed the two powerful clans out of the way.\n\nAs a result, Lord Miyukinosuke first led the shogunate into believing that their allies were staging a coup. He then tricked the two clans into giving up their seals before obliterating them. His forces then threw the infants Jiraiya and Tsunade down the cliff, thereby eliminating the two respective successors of the Ogata and Matsura.\n\nLuckily, a hermit by the name of Senso Dojin saved and raised them.\n\nTraining Jiraiya & Tsunade to defeat Orochimaru\n\nDetermined to avenge their clans and restore the tarnished honour, Senso Dojin began to train Jiraiya and Tsunade respectively in the shape-shifting magic of the toad and slug.\n\nHowever, the three-way deadlock was a problem. Snake magic surpassed toad magic; toad magic surpassed slug magic; slug magic could defeat snake magic. The key to defeating Orochimaru was to use the Nakirimaru sword (wave-cutting sword).\n\nFirst Battle against Orochimaru\n\nIn their first battle, Orochimaru fought and severely wounded Jiraiya. Fortunately, Tsunade arrived in time and saved Jiraiya with her prodigious use of slug magic. While he escaped death, the wounds were serious enough to disable Jiraiya.\n\nThe only antidote was the blood of a maiden who was born in the year, day and hour of the snake.\n\nA Sister’s Sacrifice to Save Her Brother\n\nJiraiya and Tsunade continued their search for the sword. As they entered the Echigo province, they met Ayame of all people, the adoptive daughter of the Tsukikage clan.\n\nJiraiya then made a surprising discovery that Ayame was his sister (spared during the clan’s massacre).\n\nRealising that she was the maiden born in the year of the snake, she stabbed herself as a sacrifice to save her brother. Her blood was the antidote. And with her sacrifice, she ensured that Jiraiya and Tsunade could take revenge and reinstate the two clans.\n\nJiraiya was fully healed.\n\nDefeating Orochimaru\n\nYears pass when both Jiraiya and Tsunade finally found the Nakimaru (wave-cutting sword) at Hell Valley.\n\nTogether they cornered Orochimaru with the sword and exorcised the demonic spirit. The misunderstanding over the Ogata and Matsura clan was cleared. And the Shogunate reinstated their clans.\n\nSince the demonic snake was exorcised, Orochimaru was no longer possessed. He was pardoned for his crimes at Jiraiya’s request to the Shogun.\n\nNote: This kabuki play was written by Kawatake Shinshichi II and summarised by Watanabe Hisao. There are other versions – closer to the original – where Orochimaru was the former disciple of Jiraiya.\n\nCharacters in Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari\n\nThe character profiles may have discrepancies as there are different versions of the folklore. For full movies related to the Jiraiya folklore, scroll to the next section.\n\nMain Characters\n\nSupporting Characters\n\nJiraiya in Pop Culture\n\nBesides the kabuki theatre, the original series clearly inspired numerous modern adaptations in film and anime. Here are a few.\n\nJiraiya the Brave (Silent Film) in 1921\n\nAlso known as Goketsu Jiraiya, this short silent film has kabuki-style action scenes. There may also have been an accompanying narration when it premiered in the past, but that can no longer be found. The battle scenes are comical.\n\nThe Magic Serpent in 1966\n\nGeorge Lucas’s Star Wars movies was said to have a plot similar to this film, The Magic Serpent (Kairyu Daikessen).\n\nThis video happens to be the full movie, dubbed in English. Watch it if you have the time.\n\nNaruto – Jiraiya, Tsunade & Orochimaru\n\nIn the Naruto series, Jiraiya, Tsunade and Orochimaru are extremely prodigious ninjas who have the ability to summon toads, slugs and snakes respectively. They were former teammates until Orochimaru betrayed the village. This is a battle scene, similar to what you might expect in the original folklore.\n\nWith that, the report on the original Jiraiya, Tsunade and Orochimaru has come to an end. Another version of the Jiraiya folklore will be posted next week."
