        "text": "For about the past 6 months this has been my experience with some of the most notable companies in the IT industry. The same companies that claim to value service and veterans have sent me the same message you see below. I often find myself questioning the true value of my military service when compared to a degree or certification. Believe it or not I still live by these values: I will always place the mission first. I will never accept defeat. I will never quit. I will never leave a fallen comrade. I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough, trained and proficient in my warrior tasks and drills. While these companies continue to tell me my service is not enough. My time in service and these values tell me I am everything I need to be. How can you value a degree over an ability to lead and train people? How can you value a credential over an unwavering commitment to the mission? My 4 AAMs, waiver to SPC, and promotion to NCO (in just three years) tell me I am everything your company needs and then some! #HOOAH I say all that to say this, no amount of time in the educational system can compare to serving your country. No degree can ever prepare you for life like raising your right hand and taking that oath to serve your country. I know I will find the right organization but the credentials that are valued by corporate America must change. No amount of time in a classroom should hold more weight than service to our great nation! #USArmy #Veteran #Independentcontractor #Neverquit #USA\n\nI’m back from Atropia, where I learned a really valuable lesson in the field. Namely, what the hell I’m even doing here. My time on Fort Jackson is nearing its end. I admit that it was a struggle at first to see my presence in AG BOLC - while neither an AG officer nor a Lieutenant - as anything other than a suboptimal decision on the part of the Army. Y’all know how much I love the Army, so of course I’d go wherever it sends me. But… here? Why, I wondered? What are COAs to better absorb 38G direct commissions into the force? Let’s have that conversation another day. But if I’m here, clearly I’m meant to learn something. On the night shift in the field, I finally understood. It was fascinating to learn how an S-1 shop would function down range. I saw real diligence and ingenuity at work as the battalions handled administrative actions in the wake of enemy fire. I had simply never thought much about what an S-1 does in wartime. Turns out, a lot. Strength management reporting is no joke. It requires extreme calm under pressure, adaptability, and knowing how and when to compartmentalize - things I aspire to adopt in myself. When my battalion sustained casualties in the simulation, I had to put in PARs for the Combat Infantry Badge for the KIAs. It was a challenge at first for me and my weird brain to not look at the crew manning roster and get strangely sad about these losses. They were random names on a paper, but I would imagine their lives and who they left behind. Maybe it’s just the field making me a bit nuts, I thought. But I know it’s just how my brain is, often eclipsed by an aggressively emotional heart. H, this is the #Army. Get it together. Meanwhile, my AG officer classmates knew they had a job to do. They sent up operational strength metrics and casualty packets to Brigade with incredible precision. But they also maintained focus on doing the right thing by these KIAs. They worked hard to process condolence letters for families of the KIA and medals in time to be sent home with them. They never lost sight of how to care for their fallen. It really was something to see. I was so impressed by my classmates and proud to be part of a team I thought I had no business being on. I learned a valuable lesson: Being able to continue mission puts duty as the fulcrum creating balance between mind and heart. One alone is never sufficient for mission success. I’m thankful to my classmates for demonstrating excellence in a lesson I know I needed to embrace not just for my Army career but for my life as a whole. There will be times in both my career and life that Charlie Mike seems an impossible task. There will be times when my heart hurts or my brain doubts its potential. But when those moments come, I will remember this equation for continuing mission. Duty, heart, mind, in perfect harmony. That’s why I was sent here. I’ll remember this place and the lessons from the night shift forever.\n\nI have always been very proud and vocal of my dad’s achievements in the Indian Army. I have repeatedly said that while he is a strict and tough man, he’s also the most principled and ethical person I know. And when it comes to leadership, I don’t know a better leader! Anyone who knows him personally will agree with me. So as we commemorate #25yearsofKargilVijay, it makes me very proud yet again to share episode 1 of a docuseries recently launched by Nitin A. Gokhale who needs no introduction! If you have an interest in military history, please do watch it. This episode features my father – Brig. Devinder Singh, fondly known as ‘Delta’ in the armed forces circle - who commanded the 70 Infantry Brigade in the Batalik sector during the war and personally led what most military experts agree was the hardest campaign of the Kargil war. He is known as the Victor of Batalik and led the critical battle for Point 5203, which had been quickly overrun by Pakistani troops in the early days of the war. He also led the assaults on the Jubbar complex. A month before the operations broke out during a corps-level war game, he had also predicted the pattern of intrusions by Pakistan Army regulars. The Brigade in fact took the first prisoner of war—Naik Inayat Ali of 5 Northern Light Infantry—proving for the first time the involvement of the Pakistani Army in the operation. To add more context, Batalik was an usually difficult terrain to cover or fight in as it was away from the highway and most of the peaks in the Batalik sector were upwards of 15000 feet. They had to be reached by walking up the streams and nallahs. The jagged mountain peaks made the going tough for soldiers. Helicopters could not fly because of the narrow valleys and steep mountains. Hence, media attention towards Batalik only came much after the war. #armydads #leadership #kargilwar #prouddaughter StratNewsGlobal\n\nWhat could have been done differently to make you stay in the armed forces? If you knew ‘then’ what you know ‘now’, what would you change? This is a question that I have often asked myself in the years since leaving. Could the military have done more to retain me once I made the decision to sign off? I am not sure that once I had made the decision to sign off that anything could have been done to change my mind. When I submitted my papers, I did have a chat with the CSM who was really good and said that he did not think I was the sort to be swayed by offers of promotion and postings but that if I did want to discuss my career options more formally he would be more than happy to do so. I thanked him for his kind words, but he was right, I had considered my options and made my decision but could things have been different? What if I had been captured earlier by the system and made aware that there were perhaps other pathways to follow. Would I have looked at matters differently? There are the obvious options to move on; SF, Army Air Corps, PT Corps, perhaps even the RMP but outside of these ‘known’ options, the men and women at the coalface probably have little knowledge of what else could be considered, this was certainly the case for me – I was cap badge ignorant to a large degree! It was not until I had left the Parachute Regiment that I was made aware that it may have been possible for me to try out as an Army photographer, something that I would have loved to have done as I had developed a keen interest in photography from a young age. I had been on various courses whilst serving in the Paras to increase my knowledge of the dark art and it continues to be a part of my life to this day. Alas, any option of even discussing this was never presented to me and the opportunity passed without me having any knowledge that it existed! Did you transfer whilst in service? Did it work out for you? What did you do? I am currently Head of Centre for Argus Europe LIMITED where we deliver several courses including Close Protection and welcome members of the armed forces who can use their ELCAS funding to help them transition into to the next phase of their lives.\n\n⭐ The Struggle behind the success ⭐ 🎯 This is out of box post reflecting ones aim to reach the target. ✨ The photo on the right is of 3rd September 2021 when i was Recommended for Assistant Commandant Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and left photo is of after an year. ⭐ Assistant Commandant is the entry level officer who leads a troop of soldiers in war and on duty. This was my 25th Attempt after consecutive years of failures and travelling all around india for interviews with bag full of hopes and a dream of serving motherland. After clearing my medicals , i was not in the merit list and eventually i choose to give the other chance i.e 26th Attempt (Last Attempt) a year after , I failed the interview itself. 🥅 \"Success is like a ball heading towards the Goalpost but you never know when the ball will get slightly deflected and move in other direction and a new hope will began\" 🥅 I stood up again and choose my current career in the Corporate(s) and choose to perform my best here taking all the Learnings from my past experiences. Vestas 🌠 Moral of the post : Use your experiences to build your present and have a gratitude towards your failures that it taught you to be some better person than others around you. 🚀 \"Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.\" - Henry Ford #Success #Achievement #Goals #Motivation #Inspiration #Determination #Ambition #DreamBig #SuccessMindset #NeverGiveUp #Grit #Perseverance #Drive #SuccessFactors #WinningMindset #AchieveGreatness #CareerSuccess #LifeGoals #PositiveAttitude\n\nThe Indian Army, the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy are the biggest brands in the world. And storytelling has played a major role building the brand they're today. Do you know that when a cadet joins the academy, They're shared the complete historical perspective of the Armed Forces from the very first day. - How the force came into being? - Who were the first people behind it? - Stories of medals, awards and honors Every damn story of the defence unit is shared. NOT once but every single day. Why? Patriotism doesn't come from blabbering about Patriotism. It comes from listening the story of people who actually SHOWED it on ground. And when these stories are shared REPEATEDLY with young officers, it engrains in their DNA that they're the most powerful, they're the fking best. Result? They feel motivated. They stand for their people. They take ownership of the unit. Same applies for entrepreneurship. Founders have to realise that Without stories, emotional connect doesn't happen Without emotional connect, ownership will never come Without ownership, you'll never see any results Use stories to drive people to drive business For more such content, follow Nikhil Mishra 😊 #brandbuilding #community #ownership #culture\n\n🚀 As a student at IFIM College in Electronic City, I often witness the dedication and vigilance of CISF personnel patrolling daily. On this CISF Raising Day, I reflect on a remarkable journey I had a while back. I had the privilege of sharing the train compartment with 3 retired soldiers of the Indian Armed Forces, including 2 NSG commandoes and a Supply Chain Manager(in corporate terms) - ASC. These veterans, who were involved in handling the 26/11 attacks and many more missions, shared riveting insights and stories with me throughout the journey. From discussing communication strategies to problem-solving techniques, I gained valuable lessons in: 1. #communication 2. #adaptability in the face of adversity 3. #flexibility 4. #problemsolving 5. #technicalskills 6. #integrity 7. #teamwork 8. #leadership 9. #organizations 10. #compliance 11. #strategicplanning 12. Dedication and discipline We even exchanged thoughts on today’s education and corporate scenarios, bridging the gap between generations. What struck me the most was their humility and respect; they addressed me as ‘sir’ throughout the journey, a gesture that left me humbled. As the journey came to an end, they left me with profound advice: “They told me you have the capability of becoming an officer, and jawano ko pareshaan mat karna sahab.” Their words resonate deeply, reminding me of the responsibility and honor that comes with leadership. Grateful for this enriching experience and the opportunity to learn from true heroes! 🙏 #IndianArmedForces #NSG #Veterans #leadershiplessons #CISF Due to certain obvious reasons, I cannot disclose their regiment, date of journey, their names, and ranks, etc.."
