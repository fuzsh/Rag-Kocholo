        "text": "Sudbury horror film buffs will have the chance to see their hometown in a terrifying new light, as the Nickel City served as the setting for “The Curse of Buckout Road” which debuts nationwide and on video on demand on Sept. 27.\n\nWritten and directed by North Bay native Matthew Currie Holmes, the film was shot between 2016-2017 and focuses on a group of college students taking on a class project to crack the urban legends surrounding the famed Buckout Road in upstate New York.\n\nThis was Currie Holmes’ first time shooting in Sudbury, despite growing up just down Highway 17 in North Bay.\n\n“I never really ventured into Sudbury, that was always considered no-man’s land,” laughed Currie Holmes. “But it was fantastic, working with David Anselmo (Northern Ontario Film Studios) was great. Aside from being an hour from my family, it was great to discover Sudbury, we shot in a lot of places around Sudbury and did a lot of location scouting so it was really cool.”\n\nAside from some B-roll shot in upstate New York where the film takes place, all of the locations in the The Curse of Buckout Road are in Sudbury. Currie Holmes and his crew shot a number of scenes at Northern Ontario Film Studios and the nearby area around Adanac Ski Hill.\n\nThe director also happened upon some great locations during his scouts that made it into the film.\n\n“There was this really cool church up on a hill that we shot at that was just such a beautiful building,” said Currie Holmes. “It was like a 1970’s church, it was just really cool, it was this ominous church on the hill and it was a great spot.”\n\nThe church in question was Our Lady of Hope Church off Brennan Road in the Gatchell neighbourhood.\n\n“We shot near the ski hill, in the woods back there, the little service road that goes back there was our Buckout Road,” said Currie Holmes.\n\nThis was Currie Holmes’ first time working with David Anselmo and NOFS and the director had glowing praise for the experience of coming to Sudbury and working with Anselmo.\n\n“We loved it, we’re actually shooting another one up in Northern Ontario. As far as working with David Anselmo it was great, he was very accommodating, his studio was really functional as far as we had our production office there but we also shot inside the studio, we also shot in the parking lot near the forest area,” said Currie Holmes. “We utilized that whole area by the ski hill, it was great.”\n\nThe crew also found a dilapidated old house that they cleaned up and used as a the setting in parts of the movie. Currie Holmes says he’s excited to see Sudbury as a big star on the big screen.\n\n“If you’re going to shoot a horror film there, with some atmosphere, you can definitely do a lot worse (than Sudbury),” he said.\n\nIf you want to catch The Curse of Buckout Road on the big screen, Imagine Cinemas – Downtown Movie Lounge will be screening the film this Friday and Saturday at 6:40 p.m. and 9:10 p.m.\n\nhttps://www.sudbury.com/local-news/sudbury-stars-as-backdrop-for-horror-film-the-curse-of-buckout-road-1716299?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook&fbclid=IwAR2M9LnFusgrRoTAiNLJZia6h3-J2BMzaiJphCS_m49HeTmz3ICWHfC2Gx4\n\nAs the Hallmark Channel and several millions of faithful “Hearties” know, “When Calls the Heart” has become the true heart of the Hallmark Channel and reigns as the longest-running original series in the network’s history. The drama centered on faith, love, unity, and persevering determination of the Northwest Territory community of Hope Valley is a fixture for Sunday night viewing.\n\nNow, it seems that the first streaming series for the network on Hallmark Movies Now, “When Hope Calls.” is drawing fans with equal enthusiasm.\n\nThe fervor is building so significantly that the Hallmark Channel is adding a one-time special-airing of the first two episodes, of “When Hope Calls,” to its schedule on Saturday, September 21, according to September 13, breaking news for Broadway World and The Futon Critic.\n\nBrookfield is becoming beloved\n\n“When Hope Calls” is set in the town of Brookfield, not too far from the familiar Hope Valley, but far enough to allow a brand-new start in the lives of two sisters, Grace Bennett and Lillian Walsh (Jocelyn Hudon and Morgan Kohan).\n\nThe sisters were introduced to “When Calls the Heart” fans during last year’s Christmas movie feature, “The Greatest Christmas Blessing.” The sisters were en route to Brookfield and beginning their own orphanage when a broken wagon wheel waylaid them and their group of orphaned children in Hope Valley. The whole community joined together in surrendering their own personal Christmas wishes for the sake of blessing the children.\n\nBrookfield is the childhood home of Lillian, who was soon adopted after her arrival at the orphanage following the death of the siblings’ parents, while Grace was left to “age out” of the system.Don’t miss the latest news!Click on the topic you interest most. We’ll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn’t miss.TV SHOWS\n\nThe sisters both know the loneliness and isolation of “institutional” care. They are determined to do things differently in their caretaking of the children, while at the same time, learning more about one another.\n\n“When Calls the Heart” favorites, Pascale Hutton and Kavan Smith, who portray Rosemary and Lee Coulter, come to the aid of their neighboring community in the wake of a fire, bringing lumber and lots of love. The second episode of the two-episode television treat, “From the Ashes,” will feature the endearing characters coming to lend vital support.\n\nThe episode will follow the first episode of the breakout series, “New Hope,” which introduces the new setting and characters, along with rewards and challenges of life on “When Hope Calls.” The broadcast of the very special double feature will begin at 9 PM ET on the Hallmark Channel.\n\nMore to love\n\nEven though the acclaimed Canadian actresses of “When Hope Calls,” have given nothing but gratitude in being part of the “When Calls the Heart” television legacy of success, Jocelyn Hudon stressed that “we make it our own” of the new drama in a “Home & Family” interview last month.\n\nThe eyes of another handsome Mountie, Gabriel Winslow (RJ Hatanaka) are drawn to Lillian, while a rugged veterinarian, Chuck Stewart (Greg Hovanessian) becomes captivated by Grace despite some past family troubles. The sisters forge their own lives while never failing to give their best to the children in their care.\n\nThe cherished “When Calls the Heart” writer is creating a three-book series for “When Hope Calls,” collaborating with her daughter, Laurel Oke Logan.\n\nThe new series is already becoming more than a spinoff, and will surely be delighting fans for a long time to come.\n\nhttps://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2019/09/hallmark-channel-to-treat-and-tempt-new-when-hope-calls-fans-with-special-airings-002981919.html?fbclid=IwAR1Esthxe5uU1ojHSsFkWcwkFDJsoyS3W-YwZrBMCcg9NkNJiyFhqXSyfJ8\n\nAn undertaking that started roughly seven years ago to transform the former Barrydowne Arena has had wide-reaching impact on the city of Greater Sudbury and Northern Ontario as a whole.\n\nThe building itself is now the home of Northern Ontario Film Studios (NOFS), and from that transformation has sprouted one of the fastest-growing industries in the northern part of the province, as film and television production in Northern Ontario is a multi-million dollar business.\n\nLast year, Northern Ontario Film Studios and its sister company Hideaway Pictures created 977 full-time equivalency jobs in Northern Ontario, and Hideaway Pictures had $53 million in gross production.\n\n“Northern Ontario as a whole is the fastest-growing new film centre in Canada,” said NOFS CEO David Anselmo.\n\n“A lot of that has to do with the current government we have and the support they give us because it has incentivized the region to allow productions to come to an area that doesn’t have the infrastructure that other centres do, like Toronto or Vancouver, and that incentive allows for locals such as myself and other locals in Northern Ontario to build on infrastructure and create services that make it more cost-effective to shoot in the region.”\n\nNorthern Ontario Film Studios serviced more than 15 movies last year in equipment, starwagon and studio rental in Northern Ontario, and has serviced more than 75 films since its inception in 2012. Northern Ontario as a whole has become a very popular filming location, according to Anselmo.\n\nIn addition to drawing the attention of filmmakers from around Canada and south of the boarder, Northern Ontario has become a strong draw for those in the film and television industry who had to leave home years ago in pursuit of their careers.\n\nAnselmo is one of those such stories, having moved back home to Sudbury in 2010 after cutting his teeth overseas.\n\n“I wanted to live the Northern Ontario lifestyle and live at home and to work in an industry that I love that was non-existent when I was in high school and university so I had to leave,” said Anselmo. “When I came back there was maybe one movie being shot a year to now having 10 to 15 television series and movies shot a year, where people who were part-time in the industry now have full-time jobs going from one show to another.”\n\nHaving a permanent basecamp was essential to growing the industry and establishing a sense of permanency has allowed Northern Ontario to grow and retain its talent within the film and television industry. Anslemo has poured around $500,000 into overhauling the old Barrydowne Arena and turning it into a hub for the industry, right here in Sudbury.\n\nNOFS features a 16,000 sq. ft. single span main stage floor, on and off-site production offices, a hair and makeup room, a prop shop, a craft kitchen, laundry facilities and ample parking. There is 2,000 sq. ft. of auxiliary space and fibre optic wi-fi service provided by Agilis Networks throughout the building.\n\n“It was vitally important to me, as a producer, to establish a permanent base so that filmmakers can come in and work out of a space that was ready to go,” said Anselmo. “When looking for a space, we sat down with the city, who had vision at the time to realize the importance and potential of this new industry. The Barrydowne Arena was an old, dilapidated arena that wasn’t being used very much or for anything other than storage.”\n\nThe building was once covered in graffiti and the surrounding area wasn’t seen in the best of lights. Anselmo compared it to the broken window theory out of New York City, where if you see one broken window the assumption is made that it’s a bad area.\n\nAs the arena began its transformation, Anselmo says that he saw and heard of the changes to the neighbourhood, including neighbours telling him that their sheds were no longer being broken into, and at least 10 companies have moved into the area and now house their businesses there.\n\n“I don’t know if it was ever a dangerous neighbourhood, I just think that there’s not so much vandalism going on as there used to be,” said Anselmo. “I know there were stories done back in 2007 about the vandalism at the Barrydowne Arena and how some St. Charles students had painted it, and there was another story from 2008 about some of the citizens complaining about the problem as well.”\n\nThe overarching theme of growth and development touches many facets of the film and tv industry in Northern Ontario, from job creation, to the ever-increasing number of productions that are choosing Ontario’s north as their destination of choice.\n\nIn addition to the number of productions, the size and scope of productions has changed and evolved as well.\n\n“The transition we’re seeing is from mostly small indie films, which are still being shot here, to bigger television series, in our studio last year we had V-Wars, which was a big Netflix tv show that’s coming to Netflix in 2019,” said Anselmo.\n\n“The Toronto Star mentioned the Netflix hub that’s opening in Toronto and all the Netflix shows that are being shot in Ontario and they mentioned V-Wars was shot out of our studio in Sudbury, and it wouldn’t have been able to shoot up here if it didn’t have the services of the studio and the home base it needed to pull something of this magnitude off.”\n\nAs the industry continues to grow, so too does the feeder system and colleges like Canadore in North Bay, which Anselmo says has one of the best programs out there for students looking to get into the film and television industry.\n\n“We’re seeing more and more great crews coming out of Northern Ontario, and there’s many stories of people moving back home to this area to work,” said Anselmo. “Canadore is churning out fabulous students that I employ on my film sets all the time no matter where I’m shooting.”\n\nNOFS opened a second studio in North Bay two years ago.\n\n“That’s why I talk about the film industry as a whole, as a regional industry, rather than city-centric,” said Anselmo. “We’re all benefitting, there are movies being shot in Sault Ste. Marie, there are movies being shot in North Bay and there are movies being shot in Sudbury, and that’s all contributing to our industry.”\n\nAccording to numbers from the film workers’ unions that Anselmo has looked at, Northern Ontario is currently the fifth-largest Canadian film industry, behind only Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and Alberta.\n\nWhen it comes to the impacts of this ever-growing industry, they are felt beyond just those who work on film and TV sets.\n\n“The spin-off economy that happens because of our industry is a lot bigger than we think it is,” said Anselmo. “Our direct dollars are recycled back into our economy for groceries and property taxes and spending money at other local businesses. Two Decembers ago, (city of Greater Sudbury economic development officer) Meredith Armstrong and I walked into a coffee shop on Elm Street and one of the barristas asked when we were coming back and said every time there’s a film in town their sales go up 35 per cent.”\n\nOverhauling a graffiti-covered arena has certainly made a major impact on Sudbury and Northern Ontario.\n\nhttps://www.sudbury.com/local-news/turning-an-old-arena-into-an-entire-industry-1260670?fbclid=IwAR2HrfGbOZb5LqrLDcesMgfFj1RbCnVBkp0ZioDifO1qcZ_V3rs6YTEWXqo\n\n‘With these investments, we’re building on our reputation as a prime destination in the industry and signalling that Northern Ontario is open for business’\n\nVic Fedeli’s trying to put money where his mouth is today when indicating the Ford government supports film in the province.\n\nToday the Nipissing MPP and Finance Minister did that by announcing $1.3 million in infrastructure funding to support film production in North Bay along with two additional projects centred in North Bay and Sudbury.\n\n“I was the guest speaker at Film Ontario and I told them loud and clear that what you can count on from Doug Ford’s government in one word will be ‘stability’ and they took that as a sign,” said Fedeli during the funding announcement at Canadore College this morning.\n\nDavid Anselmo has overseen numerous film projects in North Bay including many of the Hallmark Christmas movies.\n\nHe believes this funding announcement is a step in the right direction.\n\n“The film industry in Ontario is good business, it creates a lot of jobs,” noted Anselmo, who is originally from Sudbury.\n\n“We create a few 1000 here in Northern Ontario every year so this is important to grow the economy and there is a dedication from our government to grow this economy and this is a great choice because the film industry in Ontario as a whole – including Northern Ontario – is growing and it is a very big and growing market.”\n\nA total of $1 million in funding will go to Hideaway Pictures Inc. to produce “Pride, Prejudice, and Mistletoe” and “Christmas at Grand Valley.”\n\nAnother $340,000 will go to the Northern Ontario Film Studios to help them purchase more mobile equipment.\n\n“The infrastructure needs of Northern Ontario are huge with the ever-growing market that is happening here there is a need to service those films that do come in and this is a part of that,” noted Anselmo.\n\n“By investing in film and television projects, our government is providing economic and job opportunities for local businesses and communities,” said Nipissing MPP Fedeli.\n\n“With these investments, we’re building on our reputation as a prime destination in the industry and signalling that Northern Ontario is open for business.”\n\nhttps://www.baytoday.ca/local-news/more-funds-for-the-local-film-industry-1256332?fbclid=IwAR1wngdrNSZmU2FZGhNbRLvg5XBztGQAyTiCnEYSk-UfsH94Yuf9DwQETeA\n\nA Hallmark Christmas movie is a beloved staple of holiday programming, and it has a certain rhythm. A high-powered woman returns to her small town for the holidays, bruised by some romantic or professional disappointment. She faces a Christmassy challenge and finds solace in her family, the town, its traditions, and a handsome man she didn’t expect, even if the rest of us saw it coming.\n\nYou might think it’s easy to dream up a premise, but not everybody can sustain the magic over 120 pages of a script. Ron Oliver is one of the fixers Hallmark calls — sometimes a week before shooting — when a movie is missing that special touch.\n\n“It’s hard to find writers who understand that brand,” the writer-director says. “The ones we use again and again, they tend to be the ones that get it.”\n\nWhen he dives into a script, he usually sees the same issues. Writers are lured into the rom-com trope of argument between the romantic leads. That won’t work — this isn’t When Harry Met Hallmark.\n\n“You want banter, you don’t want bicker, so you have to pull back on the sharp words they would have with each other,” he says. “You don’t want to hit big heavy-duty emotions.”\n\nAnother problem Oliver sees is too much festive restraint. Some writers seem hesitant to load each page with seasonal cheer. A scene with two people walking down a street is a waste. He advises adding a chestnut roasting stand, a Christmas tree lot, or a skating rink.\n\n“You take the same stuff you do in a regular movie and you Christmas the crap out of it,” he says, laughing.\n\nHallmark ran its first original Christmas movie in 2002, and within a few years, it had three or four new movies each holiday season. The Countdown to Christmas franchise began in 2009 with 12 movies. Every year since 2011, it has topped the previous year’s total. Which brings us to this year.\n\nDaniel Thompson and his friends, who live in South Carolina, review every film for their podcast Deck the Hallmark. One of the guys loves the movies, one is on the fence, but Thompson is not a fan. Each night when his children are nestled in bed, the high school principal begins his lonely work in the living room.\n\nHe shakes his head at the obstacles that could be easily overcome and the way big cities are casually slagged in favour of the quaint small town. The stakes couldn’t be lower, he says in one episode about this year’s Christmas Joy. A “keenly intelligent market researcher” named Joy returns to small-town North Carolina to help her aunt recover from a ladder fall, rekindles a romance with old crush, and takes her aunt’s place in the cookie competition. With a few exceptions, the protagonists are usually white. The couple is always heterosexual. Love, togetherness and Christmas always triumph.\n\nOne night, Thompson watched a misunderstood uncle make an emotional speech about how he’d not always dealt with things “in the right way.” But then the man said “I’ve said a lot of things that I’m proud of.”\n\nThompson thought he misheard. It was past 1 a.m.\n\nWhen he mentioned it on the podcast, his co-hosts didn’t believe it.\n\n“I rewound it three times — and he forgot the word ‘not,’ ” he says.\n\n“And Hallmark said wrap it, that’s good!” one of his friends chimed in.\n\nWhile Hallmark squares off against similar fare from Netflix and Lifetime, nobody can beat it for quantity. The company churns out the movies like their characters bake cookies: by the dozen, following a trusted recipe. Most are shot in 15 days on a $2-million (U.S.) budget, starring a female lead in her 30s or 40s. Of the 37 movies this year, 17 were shot in Canada. Vancouver is a popular filming location, but in recent years, Ontario has lured the company to northern cities like Sudbury and North Bay with a grant program.\n\nOliver has written or directed 10 Christmas films for the network. When he comes up with a premise, he imagines that feeling of being 6 years old on Christmas morning in Dundalk, Ont., walking downstairs to the living room, seeing the tree and presents. How does he go back to that place as an adult? How does he bring millions of us with him?\n\n“People tend to look at these movies as perhaps a little bit cheesy, or a little bit simplistic, but there is a really strong sense of the hero’s journey,” he says. “You’ve got this character, she’s a high-powered executive, but she’s unhappy. Something is missing, whether it’s love or a sense of completion. There is something missing and the journey back to Christmas is this thing that fixes her or him.”\n\nBobby Chaumont grew up in Sudbury and played for the local Ontario Hockey League team for four years, and he now plays in Europe. Last spring, when his season was ending in France, his brother sent him an email. A hockey movie was being filmed in Sudbury, and the local casting company was looking for extras who could skate. Every summer, Chaumont comes home to work, so his brother thought he might be interested.\n\nThe 34-year-old had no idea that certain stretches of Sudbury’s downtown had been doubling as New York, or that the nearby community of Copper Cliff — built around a mine site discovered in 1885 — had been a charming stand in for small-town America. He didn’t know that Ontario’s Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines intersected with Hollywood.\n\n“I’ll be honest, I never watched a Hallmark movie in my life before,” Chaumont says from Germany, where he plays for EHC Waldkraiburg.\n\nIn 2013, the ministry made changes to its Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corp. (NOHFC) to lure more filmmakers to places like Sudbury and North Bay. As long as they employ a Canadian production company and satisfy several conditions, including local spending and employment, companies like Hallmark are reimbursed to a maximum of $500,000 a picture for their northern spend (with exceptions for longer television series). Hallmark has been given $6 million for the 12 Christmas movies it has shot in Northern Ontario in the last five years.\n\nEach Hallmark Christmas movie needs 300 to 500 extras to marvel at a tree lighting, skate around a rink or mingle at a party, and Micheline Blais is the woman who finds them. Her conservative estimate is that Hallmark has paid close to $500,000 in wages to northern Ontario background actors this year, for Christmas movies alone. A ministry official says each production typically comes with 44 local jobs, not counting extras.\n\nBlais always wanted to work in the film industry, but her parents encouraged her to be practical. When she was growing up in Sudbury, the idea of a film career in that city was a non-starter. So she went to nursing school, and until a few years ago, she was training actors to be standardized patients for the Medical Council of Canada exams.\n\n“I always kept my foot in with indie projects, worked on little things here and there,” she says. “And now I get to live the dream in my hometown.”\n\nBlais owns Cast North. She casts local actors, stand-ins, photo doubles and hundreds of extras. For Hallmark movies, she’s usually looking for a diverse crowd with no tattoos, no piercings and no facial hair.\n\n“During Movember and hunting season in northern Ontario, it is very challenging to find males without facial hair,” she says.\n\nWhen you tell background actors to bring a “winter wardrobe” to set, some locals show up with bulky parkas, plaid and big boots — the “northern Ontario tundra look,” as Blais calls it. Hallmark wants colourful jewel tones. They need to convince viewers that these people are living in an American small town, or maybe New York. She always has a few spare coats.\n\nThe films are often shot in the late summer and fall, with three weeks of prep work to confirm the local cast, crew, equipment and locations, and then there are 15 days of shooting.\n\nOn set, background actors are reminded to be happy, lively, and to channel the holiday spirit.\n\n“That kind of stuff really shows on camera, everyone really glows,” says background actor Bobby Chaumont, who this summer had stints as a cop, hockey player, military aide, search-and-rescue worker and man milling about a silent auction.\n\nFor Pride and Prejudice and Christmas — starring Party of Five alum Lacey Chabert — he was upgraded to a “caroller.” He sang “We Wish You a Merry Christmas” and snagged his first ACTRA credit. (It was cut, but it still counts and he’s two speaking roles away from being a full ACTRA member.) He was fascinated to see how the movie was shot. On location, there was a buzz, with crowds coming out to watch the shoots.\n\nBlais says that people are working hard on their craft. “It’s giving them hope for other career opportunities,” she says. “It really is exciting times in the North.”\n\nAs he slogs his way through the films, Daniel Thompson likes to imagine the Hallmark writers’ room, with three wheels on the wall. The first wheel is situational, the second has romantic scenarios, and the third is just a circle of smiley faces. Thompson knows that some of the films are adapted from books, but he feels like it’s the same plot, over and over again.\n\nHe compares the movies to cheeseburgers, comfort food on the screen. People who like cheeseburgers are always happy to try another. Also, if you miss 15 minutes because your child is having a meltdown, you won’t be lost.\n\n“I do think that Hallmark knows exactly what they’re doing,” Thompson says.\n\nHallmark does not accept unsolicited pitches from the public. It works with a stable of writers and producers who pitch them premises year round. If you bring an idea that works with the brand, they let you make your movie.\n\nSays writer-director Oliver: “This is going to sound crazy, but it’s one of the most artistically rewarding experiences that you can have.”\n\nOliver’s first Hallmark film was Bridal Fever, shot in Toronto. Born in Barrie, he got his start as a magician, and hosted a YTV clip show in the 1980s. Low-res footage of him microwaving water in the YTV offices appears on YouTube. He also recalls throwing New Kids on the Block dolls off a rooftop to see which member of the group was the most aerodynamic.\n\nOliver began writing spec scripts (on a typewriter) and got his big break when he sold a horror script that became Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II in 1985. He now lives in Palm Springs, Calif., and directs slapstick, horror and comedy projects, but every year, he has his “sugar cake” and does a couple of Hallmark movies. It’s a nice way to end the year.\n\nOliver says the typical Christmas script should take around four weeks to write — and if it goes longer, the story likely needs a rethink.\n\n“Again, the kind of movies I make, this is not Tree of Life,” he says, laughing as he references the Palme d’Or-winning film. “Everybody has a different methodology.”\n\nHe estimates that one-third of the films are based on books. They don’t have to be bestsellers — “just cute stories that can work within our paradigm,” he says.\n\nThere are no Christmas dinner throwdowns over immigration freezes or the Mueller investigation. Nobody is yelling.\n\n“You want people to have a respite from that stuff,” he says.\n\nWhile the movies are apolitical, Slate writer Zachary Jason cited their “red-state appeal,” in a 2017 piece about Hallmark’s Christmas offerings.\n\n“As much as these movies offer giddy, predictable escapes from Trumpian chaos, they all depict a fantasy world in which America has been Made Great Again.”\n\nOliver says some people call Hallmark a “Christian right-wing network,” but he doesn’t think that’s fair. While it occasionally does a movie with a specific faith element, he says the network paints with an “extraordinarily broad brush,” so everyone can watch.\n\nIn Canada, Corus Entertainment recently announced an exclusive multi-year partnership with the Hallmark Channel. Their W Network has featured Hallmark movies in the past, but this deal is all-encompassing, giving the network exclusive Canadian licensing rights to the movies and branded stunts. Since the launch of “Countdown to Christmas” this November, W Network is the most watched network in Canada on weekends. Their audience has grown 68 per cent with women aged 25 to 54, and 101 per cent with adults 18 to 34, over the same period last year.\n\n“Hallmarkers are really loyal to the brand,” says Carolyn Spriet, president of Hallmark Canada. “Our phone has been ringing off the hook with people just saying, it’s the greatest, it’s here, finally I can watch it here in Canada.”\n\nSlate called 2017’s lineup of Hallmark movies “42 hours of sugary, sexist, preposterously plotted, plot hole-festooned, belligerently traditional, ecstatically Caucasian cheer,” with “occasional sightings of Christmas sweater-wearing black people.” (A Fox News columnist responded: It was a “throwback to an age when Hollywood produced family-friendly films and love stories that did not involve leather and whips.”)\n\nA handful of this year’s Hallmark Christmas movies star non-white leads, including Christmas Everlasting, this year’s “Hall of Fame” movie — a designation that means a bigger budget, bigger stars and more time to shoot. Oliver directed the film and has a co-writing credit on the script. It was shot in Atlanta and starred Tatyana Ali, Patti LaBelle and Dondre Whitfield.\n\n“Ah, two people of color!” one woman said on the company’s Facebook page. Another viewer noted that she was about to boycott the channel but was happy to see diversity, and hoped the network would keep it up “and make movies that reflect society and the many rich cultures of today.”\n\n“It was a very conscious decision on Hallmark’s part,” Oliver says, “and it’s the first time in the history of the Hallmark Hall of Fame movies that they had a specifically diverse cast up front.” The story also had death and grief, the type of sharp edges Hallmark films tend to avoid. Earlier this year, Oliver lost his mother and his beloved dog Crawford T. Manchester, who he likes to put into his movies. He says he poured all of that loss into this film, and was able to sneak the dog’s face onto a donation jar in one scene, and a can of cat food in another.\n\nThompson, the Hallmark hater, says Christmas Everlasting was his favourite of the bunch so far for its more realistic romance. (According to Hallmark, Christmas Everlasting was in the top five or six for ratings in the U.S., behind movies starring Candace Cameron Bure, Lacey Chabert and LeAnn Rimes. In Canada, it was the top TV movie in November among women 25 to 54, according to Corus.)\n\nOliver says people like it for all the typical reasons, “but also because they’re seeing reflections of themselves in a movie.”\n\nOne group that has not seen itself in an overt way is the LGBTQ community. This year, Thompson noticed that Road to Christmas had a brother character who seemed to be coded as gay. The character had a male business partner and it was implied they live together, “but they don’t ever come out and say it,” he says.\n\nOliver wasn’t involved in Road to Christmas, but he’s done the same thing, adding a same-sex couple to a church scene or a party.\n\n“I must say that Hallmark has been incredibly embracing of my husband and I,” he says, adding that there are other LGBTQ people who work at the company. The company’s social justice report notes that it was designated one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign. “There’s not a sense of we can’t do gay,” Oliver says. “What they are aware of is that the culture has slowly changed.”\n\nJiaoJiao Shen, a Hallmark Cards spokesperson, says the company has heard from its consumers and critics and has responded with more diverse actors in leading roles this year. She says that in 2019, two movies will celebrate the Jewish faith. While Shen does not work for Hallmark Channel, she says she believes “that we are looking at ways to represent LGBT relationships in our films as well.” (Hallmark launched its LGBTQ-specific line of cards in 2015, but has always had non-gender-specific relationship cards.)\n\n“We are actively pursuing a more diverse range of talent both in front of and behind the camera,” says Michelle Vicary, executive vice-president of programming for Crown Media, in the Hallmark social responsibility report of 2017. “We are working toward expanding in this area further.”\n\nRon Oliver thinks that someday, he’ll probably be the one who shoots the first Christmas movie with a married same-sex couple.\n\n“I think they get a little gun-shy, you know, and rightfully so,” he says, noting that when the network does something that feels “off brand” to a “small percentage” of their audience, they are deluged with mail — like the time they ran a Good Witch marathon on Easter weekend.\n\nThree times a year, at their offices in Sault Ste. Marie and Sudbury, staff with the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corp. comb through funding applications. They look at projected spending in northern Ontario, the track record of the applicants, the feasibility and the cast.\n\nSince 2013, the government has paid out $116 million to 174 projects like Letterkenny, Through Black Spruce, and Indian Horse for a portion of their northern spending. A spokesperson says those projects have invested more than $500 million in the North, bolstering the local film industry and sustaining the equivalent of 2,700 annual jobs since 2013.\n\nJonathon Condratto, the film liaison for Greater Sudbury, says the industry loves Hallmark movies for the “steady flow of work” they provide, and the opportunities they create for career advancement. Historically known as a mining community, Sudbury now has 15 to 35 productions filming within its boundaries each year, and hundreds of people working as grips, location managers and producers. “We’re starting to get more directors and writers that are starting to come from Sudbury,” he says. “It’s kind of exciting to see how it grew.”\n\nIn North Bay, there were 16 productions filmed this year, and six were Hallmark Christmas movies. Officials cite the lack of permit fees, low traffic and commute times, and the financial incentives as the reason North Bay is an attractive place to film.\n\nMany people credit Sudbury native David Anselmo for helping to build the industry.\n\nHis IMDB page has many credits for Hallmark movies, including four Hallmark Christmas projects this year (and another for Netflix). Anselmo’s two companies trumpet the “Northern advantage” in their literature. Hideaway Pictures is a production company that offers local location scouting, crew and casting services, along with consulting to help companies “identify and facilitate regional financing opportunities.” His Northern Ontario Film Studios is a self-described “one-stop shop” with a sound stage, mobile unit vehicles and equipment. In 2014, William H. White, a rental equipment supplier, opened a Sudbury location, partnering with Anselmo.\n\n“While we’re filming, he’s thinking about next year,” says casting expert Micheline Blais. “He’s already making sure that everybody has a job.”\n\nRon Oliver is thinking about next year too. A friend who usually does action movies came to him with a great idea, and the two men pitched Hallmark together.\n\nThey’ll work on the script soon, “but I can almost guarantee we’ll have to rewrite it three weeks before we go to the floor,” he says. “It’s just the way it works.”\n\nWhen he sits down to think about how to bring a protagonist back to that magical Christmas feeling, he’ll probably think of Dundalk when he was a boy: the perfect town north of Guelph with a big Christmas tree, decorations on the local shops, and a pageant at the community centre.\n\n“Went back there twenty years ago; nothing but empty storefronts and strip malls,” he writes in an email. “This is the appeal of Hallmark Christmas movies; going home to a place that doesn’t exist anymore …”\n\nhttps://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/12/06/cracking-the-hallmark-movie-code-take-girl-add-boy-christmas-the-crap-out-of-it-shoot-in-sudbury.html?fbclid=IwAR0Nm2GOdbxKrRwZrkNIMNKObwI2MjXQmqlfeLWKRjNDpsgMU4foiUOtrXg"
