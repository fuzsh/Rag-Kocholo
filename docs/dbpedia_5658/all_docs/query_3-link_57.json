        "text": "Best Feature, Best Feature Director\n\nUnder Spanish Skies\n\nDirector/Writer: Nathan Buck\n\nProducer: Christina Mallet\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nProject Type: Feature\n\nOverview: After the sudden death of her husband, a reclusive artist invites life long friends to her farm in Spain and reveals a shocking plan. before the weekend ends, the friends must reveal secrets from the past that will drive her toward a devastating choice.\n\nDirector Statement: When I set out to create the world of this film, I made for myself a set of parameters that were both practical and thematic: A short time span, a single location, and characters who have known each other a long time. Films that have left a big impression on me: âLa RÃ¨gle du Jeuâ, âPersonaâ, âKnife in the Waterâ, âThe Big Chillâ, and âFestenâ ... are all movies that rely on great performances, the excavation of memory and a claustrophobic world that heightens sexual and dramatic tension. The story that this film is based on is true, told to me by a close friend several years ago. While all of the details of Leahâs story and character are different, the core mystery of her decision is the same paradox that fascinated me when I first heard about it. As the film has evolved, every step of the way I have had to remind myself to stay faithful to the true north of this story: a tragic choice engendered out of friendship, loyalty, and love.\n\nBest Fantasy/Sci-Fi Short\n\nDetect\n\nDirector/Writer: Mark Benmore\n\nProducer: Gavin Saville\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nProject Type: Short\n\nOverview: A lonely detectorist stumbles across a short distance teleportation device with horrifying consequences.\n\nDirector Statement: I started producing films in 2015 when I started up a group called London Short Film (londonshortfilm.com). As much as I really wanted to make films I just didn't have enough knowledge to make the visions going around in my head, so I set out to create a meet up group to find other local London filmmakers to design and create great new films together. As well as producing and writing short films I have also been in the Art Design department on many others, an area I feel is key to creating the right feel for any scene.\n\nBest Drama Short, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Design\n\nFor I Am Dead\n\nDirector/Writer: Patricia Delso Lucas\n\nProducers: Patricia Delso Lucas, Al Nazemian\n\nDirector Of Photography: Dominika Podczaska\n\nSound Design: David Ferral\n\nFilm Scoring & Composer: Tom Bourgeois\n\nCountry: Belgium\n\nProject Type: Short\n\nOverview: In late-1800s Europe, Oscar, a wealthy but lonely middle-aged man who has lived a decadent, extravagant life in a chateau filled with wine, courtesans and opium, confesses love to his gardener Jude before he dies of his excesses.\n\nDirector Statement: âA period piece, 18 minutes. A dark, surreal drama. A story about unrequited love, self-acceptance and the limits of the sane mind.â With the script of For I Am Dead, I wanted to show the personal and social struggle to accept the nature of who an individual is, when his/her desires or choices do not correspond to the majority. In this particular case, Oscar is fighting with his repressed homosexuality, but this is just one of many possible incarnations portraying this dilemma. I chose to set the story at this moment in time, the late 1800s, with the intention to accentuate the fact that these kinds of questions, although they have progressed, are still relevant today. Will belonging to a minority ultimately end in tragedy?\n\nBest Animation Short\n\nThe House of Seville\n\nDirector/Producer: John Calder\n\nWriter: Bronwyn Calder\n\nMusic: Georges Bizet\n\nSound Designer: John Calder\n\nCountry: New Zealand\n\nProject Type: Short\n\nOverview: An animated mock horror movie partly based on \"Carmen\". When the equinox lines up with a lunar eclipse, there is magic empowering ghosts to cross to the opposite side of the Earth. The Ghost of Carmen leaves her usual haunt of Seville, Spain to descend on Henderson, New Zealand for a night of grandly operatic horror and mayhem as she manipulates the people there into reenacting her own dramatic violent death. Logical and sensible businesswoman Victoria drives through Henderson playing \"Carmen\" on her car stereo and runs out of petrol. Her cellphone is out of credit. Boutique shopping center \"The House of Seville\" has its lights ablaze and looks welcoming. Don't go there, Victoria!\n\nDirector Statement: Independent Alternative Film-making as co-operative passion projects is a pathway to mainstream film-making for some of our people. While on the indie journey we also enjoy freedom from chasing mainstream funding. That means freedom of expression to take on areas like satire and experimentation where the risk-adverse and sequel-obsessed mainstream is under performing.\n\nBest Comedy Short\n\nThe Idiot's Guide\n\nDirector/Writer/Producer: Peter Maughan\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nProject Type: Short\n\nOverview: Three Idiots go on a journey of enlightenment by using social media as a guide to life. Everything starts out badly, and only seems to get worse.\n\nDirector Biography: Peter graduated from Bournemouth Film School with a degree in Film Production; Editing, and has spent the last few years working as a Colourist and Editor in the film industry, working on Short Films, Music Videos and Documentaries. Having written a number of shorts during his time at university, \"The Idiot's Guide\" is his first outing as director, having shot, edited and sound designed the film as well.\n\nBest Long Short\n\nSucceed to Escape\n\nDirector/Writer: Fabian Siebecke\n\nProducers: Fabian Siebecke, Daniel Navarro Perez\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nProject Type: Short\n\nOverview: \"Succeed To Escape\" is a story about five young adults locked into a basement room and have to face trials to be freed. During these trials, they face their conflicts within themselves and with each other.\n\nDirector Biography: Fabian Lionel Siebecke was born in Berlin on January 18, 2001 and attended school from 2007 to 2019, where he graduated from a german high school with the \"Abitur\" (german equivalent to the SAT test). During his time in school, he produced and directed his web-series \"The Good Evil\" with friends. In 2019, he made a few short movies in the computer game \"Grand Theft Auto V\". In early 2021, he founded a new streaming platform for machinima movies called Baker+. Machinimas are movies made with game engines and/or with tools such as Blender, Unreal Engine 5. He was involved as a Producer in two Original Movies and is involved as Executive Producer in new Baker+ Originals in development or production.\n\nBest Original Score\n\nThe Clay and The Girl\n\nDirector/Writer: George Louridas\n\nProducer: Aluxal Karachalios\n\nOriginal Music: Christos Danakas\n\nCountry: Greece\n\nProject Type: Short\n\nOverview: Pavlos and Maria, a young married couple, face the recent loss of their daughter. Pavlos, being a sculptor, decides to create a statue in her loving memory. He finds the model who triggers his inspiration but things go unexpectedly wrong. Maria watches his affection for the young model growing and rings the bell for their marriage that is about to break.\n\nDirector Statement: \"The Clay and the Girl\" is the first professional film that was ever shot in Agrinio, Greece and it is a Greek - Mexican co-operation. The film showcases statues by the renown Greek sculptors Christos Kapralos and Vasilis Papasaikas.\n\nBest Short\n\nAmara's Smile\n\nDirector/Writer/Producer: DC Brandon\n\nCountry: Canada\n\nProject Type: Short\n\nOverview: After being stood up for a date, a woman runs into an old college classmate who gives her an unforgettable night under the stars.\n\nDirector Statement: We all die but true love never does. Setting this story against the backdrop of an ancient Chinese poem allowed me to position the love story in a more eternal way, one that extends beyond our horizon into the stars above. In this small, low-budget indie drama, perhaps one can find some hope for love in troubled times.\n\nBest Feature Screenplay\n\nBad Love Tigers\n\nWriter: Kevin L. Schewe, MD, FACRO\n\nCountry: United States\n\nGenres: Sci-Fi, Historical fiction, Young Adult, Adventure, Time Travel, Aliens, Area 51\n\nOverview: It is New Yearâs Eve, 1974, in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the fun-loving and adventurous teens of the Bad Love Gang are ambushed by a Russian KGB agent. This propels them to use the White Hole Project Time Machine to time travel back to World War II. The gang meets with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who guides them on their mission to protect a mysterious alien spaceship and Americaâs top-secret Area 51. On their perilous mission, the gang must deal with Russian, Chinese, and Indian espionage forces who stand in their path. Along the way, the gang encounters danger, intrigue, betrayal, and a little romance. Ultimately, the intrepid Bad Love Gang triumphs over their adversaries to protect the alien spaceship and maintain the security of Area 51. It's Stand by Me Meets Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nWriter Statement: I read the true WWII story of âThe Phantom Fortressâ in early December 2018 and became inspired (felt like I was âstruck by lightningâ) to write Bad Love Strikes, the first book in the series, based on time travel and my boyhood memories of our childhood âBad Love Gangâ. Our childhood neighborhood gang was always on an adventure and these memories formed the basis for the story. Nine of the Bad Love Gang characters are based on real people, two of those have people have died and seven (six-plus me) know they are referenced in the book. We all had nicknames growing up. My nickname was âBubble Buttâ or âBBâ and I am the narrator of the story. I have always loved time-travel stories and the science of physics (that is what attracted me to become a radiation oncologist). Connecting all these dots, brought the book together in an organic way!"
