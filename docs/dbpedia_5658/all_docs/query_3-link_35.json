        "text": "The Gallant Men is the pilot episode of the series. It was written by Halsted Welles and directed Robert Altman. It aired on October 5, 1962.\n\nPlot summary[]\n\nIn the pre-dawn hours of September 9, 1943, a troop transport ship steams across the Tyrrhenian Sea toward the Italian coastal town of Salerno. The men of the Army’s 36th Infantry Division are tense and quiet. Newspaper columnist Conley Wright prepares to land along with the men so he can document the beach assault.\n\nWright lands with Capt. Jergens’ Able Company. Wriggling away from the shore, Wright becomes ensnared in coiled barbed wire. He is freed by a buck private named Jake Miller. Jergens is shot and slumps onto the wire, apparently dead.\n\nThe narrative jumps ahead to winter 1943 and terrible floods that deluge southern Italy. Wright’s jeep gets mired on a muddy road. His driver, Pvt. Wziecewski, suggests he hitch a ride to San Pietro. Wright is picked up by a troop truck bearing members of Able Company, now under Jergens’ successor, Capt. Jim Benedict. The correspondent is introduced to the regular cast and reunited with Miller. Wright recognizes Miller from Operation Torch, the Allied landing in northern Africa, but can’t quite place him. Wright gets Benedict’s permission to tag along with Able Company, despite Jake’s warning that the battle ahead is expected to be brutal.\n\nThe company arrives at San Pietro a few days later. While advancing on the town, Miller helps lead the effort to neutralize a German machine gun nest and a pillbox. When he and Wright take refuge in a bomb crater, Miller is recognized and attacked by another soldier who calls him a murderer. Wright is shocked and his interest in Miller deepens.\n\nWhen the battle for San Pietro grinds to a crawl, Able Company is forced to dig in. Wright, Pvt. Roger Gibson and PFC Pete D’Angelo play blackjack. D’Angelo wins every hand, claiming Wright’s cash and gold watch as spoils of victory. A short while later, Wright remembers why he knows Jake: He addresses Miller as “Major” and says he was at Casablanca in 1942. Miller does not dispute this; Wright asks who the real Jake Miller is.\n\nThe major explains that Miller was a private killed in North Africa. Feeling responsible for the deaths that happened under his watch, the major faked his own disappearance and assumed the dead Miller’s identity. He beseeches Wright not to report what he’s learned. Wright is doubtful “Miller” will have a clear conscience, but agrees not to out him.\n\nA mysterious woman appears on the rocky hillside where Able is dug in. Pvts. Sam Hanson and Ernie Lucavich chase her, but she ends up in D’Angelo’s arms. Pete and the woman, Rosa, have apparently been an item since the company arrived at San Pietro. That night, Pete loses himself in thoughts of Rosa and talks to Wright about her. Benedict arrives and tells Wright the company’s next objective has been decided: they are to take Mount Lungo, a very difficult and risky task.\n\nBenedict tells Wright he has doubts about his own tactical and leadership abilities. He compares himself unfavorably to Miller, a man who seems competent and exhibits little self-doubt. He says he is recommending Miller for a promotion. Wright subtly encourages him not to, but Benedict says Miller has good leadership qualities. Wright suspects Benedict is too unsure of himself to make tough decisions when the time comes.\n\nDecember 15, 1943: The company moves up the slopes of Mount Lungo in the face of heavy gunfire, artillery and mortars. An explosion tosses Benedict into a crater, and the green captain has a nervous breakdown. As Miller tries to map out a strategy, Benedict clambers up to the crater’s rim screaming about getting out. Miller restrains the captain and firmly tells him the company will wait until dark to move to safer positions.\n\nThat night, inside a cave that now serves as a makeshift command post, the captain is embarrassed by his meltdown and wonders if it will harm morale or destroy his credibility with the company. Miller reassures him. Lt. Frank Kimbro and Sgt. John McKenna return from a recon patrol with bad news: the company has been cut off from the rest of the battalion. Wright wonders aloud what they can do. Benedict proposes digging in until reinforcements arrive. He notices Miller looking at him and asks if he has any ideas. Miller demurs, but Benedict presses him.\n\nMiller points out the Germans will divert most of their men and firepower to battles on the lower slopes, leaving the summit of Lungo guarded by a much smaller group. It is possible, Miller says, to take the summit without having the rest of the battalion involved. Benedict says his orders are to hold in place, but Miller says this will lead to disaster and potentially the destruction of the whole company. Kimbro and McKenna dismiss Miller’s idea, but Benedict sees the wisdom of it and decides to defy his orders.\n\nAt sunrise December 16, the company successfully slips out of their isolated position, but must still take Lungo’s summit. Kimbro radios for support as Benedict leads a small group toward the German position. The German soldiers open fire with rifles and machine guns, and a firefight ensues. Benedict, demonstrating newfound courage, moves from crater to crater, closer to a key German machine gun emplacement. He leads the surviving men to the summit of Mount Lungo and to victory. But at the same moment, Miller is felled by a bullet.\n\nThe company enters San Pietro, now wrecked by the battle. In rubble-choked streets, D’Angelo calls out for Rosa but is unable to find her. A camera shot reveals her necklace in the debris. Jake Miller is borne into town on a stretcher strapped to a jeep. Wright takes a small purse from Miller and inside discovers dog tags that reveal the man’s true identity: Maj. Robert C. Clinton. Wright says he will be remembered as a hero at Lungo, but Clinton tells him to give all the credit to Capt. Benedict. He asks Wright for a cigarette, but before the reporter can comply, Clinton dies.\n\nBenedict is saddened to hear of “Miller’s” death, but quickly moves on in his mind and asks Wright if he’s coming along to the company’s next destination. The company moves out of town along a narrow mountain road as Wright thinks about what lies ahead.\n\nG-2 Report[]"
