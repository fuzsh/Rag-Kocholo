        "text": "Publishing Ten Best lists of anything is great fun as an annual game, but it's misleading. It asks people to take seriously the results of compromise, which is all very, well and good at the peace table though it's a kind of sell‐out in these remote dependencies of criticism.\n\nSay that there are only 10 seats on the bus to immortality. Can one really be serious in suggesting that Martin Scorcese, who isn't dry behind the ears yet, deserves a place and that Arthur Penn and John Huston do not? Ridiculous, of course. Should Hal Ashby be saved from oblivion while John Frankenheimer is ignored? Certainly not. Is Woody Allen a greater filmmaker than Robert Bresson? (I'm thinking . . . I'm thinking.)\n\nBut that's pretty much the way that the list of the 10 best films of 1975 reads. It's full of compromises, and the deciding factor in almost every case has been, if not irrelevant, then at least very personal. Lina Wertmuller is not a greater director than Michelangelo Antonioni but for a couple of arbitrary reasons her “Swept Away” gets on the list and Antonioni's “The Passenger” just misses it. At this point in time, I have thought about “Swept Away” more often, with more feeling, than I have thought about “The Passenger,” though the latter still seems to me to be one of Antonioni's most brilliant works.\n\nThis has been a bumper year for odd, offbeat comedies, most of which were American and most of which had serious flaws that were as much the reasons for their idiosyncratic appeal as the successful things they contained. Only one lunatic comedy makes the 10 best list this year, but that gives no idea of the pleasures that I, at least (and my mail tells me I may have been the only one), received from Mike Nichols's “The Fortune” and the manic performances of Jack Nicholson and Stockard Channing. I also think of Howard Zeiff's “Hearts of The West,” Michael Ritchie's “Smile,” Frank Perry's “Rancho Deluxe,” Gene Wilder's “Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother,” Blake Edwards' “The Return of The Pink Panther,” as well as the English treasure, “Monty Python and The Holy Grail.” At this very moment, late in the day, if someone told me that I could take a break from the typewriter to see either “The Return of The Pink Panther” or “Distant Thunder,” I'd probably choose Peter Sellers instead of Satyajit Ray. “The Return of The Pink Panther” isn't a great film and “Distant Thunder” is, but greatness makes demands that have the force of obligations.\n\nMy choices of the 10 best films of 1975, listed alphabetical order, are as follows:\n\n“Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,” directed by Martin Scorcese and written by Robert Getchell. The way film distribution works, this is last year's movie in Hollywood (which has already given Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for her performance) but a 1975 movie in New York, where it will be competing for the upcoming film awards. “Alice” is the alternately funny and harrowing story of a youngish widow in the southwest who base 12‐year‐old son, a station wagon, not much money, and a desire to realize herself. Alice (Miss Burstyn) more or less lurches toward self‐sufficiency in a series of adventures that describe the quality of a lot of middle‐class American life. The film frees Scorcese (“Mean Streets”) from the reputation of being a limited New York director, and offers superb performances by everyone in it, most notably by Miss Burstyn, Harvey Keitel, Alfred Lutter and Diane Ladd.\n\n“Barry Lyndon,” directed, written and produced by Stanley Kubrick, who also conned the money‐men into putting up a reported $11‐million for one of the most personal, severe costume movies ever made. The source, material is Thackeray's first novel, which Kubrick has transformed into a dispassionate comedy of 18th century manners, breathtakingly beautiful but almost maliciously cool. As he did in “2001” and “A Clockwork Orange,” Kubrick stands apart from his characters, forcing us to make connections not to individuals but to an entire society. The cast is excellent (Ryan O'Neal in the title role) but the actors are primarily objects to be contemplated in Kubrick's extraordinary panorama. John Alcott's photography is Kubrick's principal collaborator.\n\n“Distant Thunder,” directed and written by Satayajit Ray. The story of India's “man‐made” famine in 1943, when more than 5,000,000 people were wiped out, is examined in the experiences of rural villagers who comprehend nothing of war. As the scramble to survive humiliates some of Ray's characters, it ennobles others. The landscapes are beautiful, the mood deceptively tranquil, yet the concerns that motivate Ray are more angrily, political than those of a much noisier, supposedly “political” filmmaker like Costa‐Gavras. In Bengali with English subtitles.\n\n“Hearts and Minds,” directed by Peter Davis, winner of the Oscar as the best feature‐length documentary of 1974. A fine, complex, admittedly biased mediation upon American power—military and economic, political and social—in the form of an examination of the United States's involvement in the Vietnam war. It's a collage of old and new newsreel footage, interviews with greats, near‐greats and nobodies, with people who made policies, carried them out, fought against them or became their victims. As we become further removed from the war, I suspect that “Hearts and Minds” will itself as one of the most all‐encompassing records' of the American civilization ever put into one film.\n\n“Love and Death,” directed and written by Woody Allen. It's about time. I mean Woody Allen films have been buzzing around these Ten Best list for years, never making it because they were so full of jokes. Now Woody has had the good sense to make a movie set in Russia at the time of the Napoleonic wars. The characters still make jokes but they have serious, Russian‐sounding names like Boris and Sonja and Mikhail and Rimsky. The film contains not just one Napoleon, which was enough for Tolstoy, but two Napoleons, and it has a character who really is Death, not someone in a rented sheet, and it has Diane Keaton, plus Woody in what flesh he has to offer. Let's be frank: Woody Allen is a greater film director by far than Bresson—Henri‐Cartier Bresson.\n\n“The Magic Flute,” directed by Ingmar Bergman. Not since Olivier's “Henry V” has a work uniquely identified with the stage been so successfully transformed into a film. Bergman keeps the scale of the production almost small enough to fit into an 18th century court theater, which is the backdrop for a movie that seems to be eavesdropping onto a live performance. The Beirginman touch has a Mozartean delicacy and edge. The sets are charming, the voices (Swedish, not German) belong to the people using them. The total effect: joyful and triumphant.\n\n“Nashville,” directed by Robert Altman and written by Joan Tewksbury. This is Altman's chef d'oeuvre, a practically perfect example of what this major American director is interested in, what he can do and how he does it. I'm afraid the film was so overpraised that some people were put off by expecting it to be more cosmic than it is, which is a satiric view of a certain segment of American life that is simultaneously foolish, vulgar, sentimental and gallant. The actors improvise, with Altman's encouragement, and they are wonderful, especially Henry Gibson, Ronee Blakley, Lily Tom??n and Barbara Harris. They all deserve awards, as does Richard Baskin, who was in charge of the music.\n\n“Shampoo,” directed by Hal Ashby and written by Robert Towne, under the over‐all supervision of Warren Beatty who produced the film and is its star. A very funny and sometimes very scared look at the kind of good life a lot of Americans would live if given half a chance, “Shampoo” is “La Ronde” in southern California, with Beatty as a satyr disguised as a hairdresser. The glib, tough, desperate style of the film is a mirror‐reflection of the lives it looks at. With Goldie Hawn, Julie Christie and Lee Grant.\n\n“The Story of Adele H” (L'Histoire d'Adèle H.), directed by Francois Truffaut. A profoundly beautiful, single‐minded movie about a love so consuming that eventually, it becomes an end in itself. It's the real‐life story of Victor Hugo's daughter who followed her English lover to Halifax in 1863 and, when she was spurned, gave herself up to a kind of luxurious but fatal obsession that made a real love object unimportant. With 20‐year‐old Isabelle Adjani in the title role, Truffaut makes us see both the madness and the grandeur of the passion. Nestor Almendros was the cameraman. French with English subtitles.\n\n“Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August,” directed by Lina Wertinuller. Politics and sex. Sex and politics. Which comes first in a Lina Wertmuller film? It's impossible to tell in “Swept Away,” a comedy that is so successfully integrated that one's first response is to the two marvelous, larger‐than‐life characters, a Sicilian seaman (Giancarlo Giannini), who is also a male chauvinist Communist pig, and a rich Milanese society bitch (Mariangela Melato). The film is the story of their stormy love affair as castaways in the Mediterranean, the forces that momentarily liberate them together and then draw them apart. A serious and super comedy. Italian with English subtitles.\n\nThe 10 runners up, in no particular order of preference: Antonioni's “The Passenger,” Sidney Lumet's “Dog Day Afternoon,” John Schlesinger's “Day of The Locust,” Claude Goretta's “The Invitation,” Lev Kulijanov's “Crime and Punishment,” Robert Bresson's “Lancelot of The Lake,” Robert Kramer and John Douglas's “Milestones,” John Huston's “The Man Who Would Be King,” John Frankenheimer's “French Cohigction II” and Arthur Penn's “Night Moves.”"
