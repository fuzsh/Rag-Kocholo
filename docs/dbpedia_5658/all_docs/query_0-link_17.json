        "text": "When the new marquee at the Rome Capitol Theatre in Rome, N.Y. was turned on in 2022, no one could have imagined that it would one day become a “symbol of hope” for the city.\n\nThat’s what the marquee and the “blade” bearing the theater name have been called in the wake of a tornado that damaged the city in July, less than a month before the annual Capitolfest film festival.\n\nOn July 16, an EF-2 tornado touched down at 3:25 p.m. traveling through the heart of downtown Rome destroying businesses along West Dominick Street as it blew out storefronts, damaged roofs and knocked down buildings. Somehow, the marquee at the Rome Capitol Theatre was untouched amid the neighboring rubble.\n\nAnd thankfully, there were no reported deaths in Rome.\n\nThe damage\n\nDespite the tornado traveling right past the Capitol Theatre, the historic movie palace survived with damage confined mostly to the shattered administrative office windows.\n\nIts neighbors, familiar to Capitolfest attendees, were not as lucky.\n\nWhile I was not able to speak directly to the business owners during this time, we did message and information was shared via social media. This is what I learned.\n\nThe Cinema Capitol building next door and the nearby Keaton & Lloyd Bookshop both sustained heavy damage and “will be out of commission for some time.” Each had front windows destroyed and will need new roofs and HVAC systems in addition to interior renovations. (For those wondering about Carl LaFong the cat, the independent bookstore’s popular resident, he was found safe in the ceiling.)\n\nCapitolfest guests will also know the Copper Easel and Superofficial, an art supply store/gallery and coffeeshop that share space at 216 W. Dominick St. on the other side of theater. They did sustain some damage but have reopened.\n\n“The shop is still messy, per usual, and it may be a while before our windows get replaced – but we are going to reopen to offer everyone a sense of normalcy,” Copper Easel owners wrote on Facebook.\n\nAs you can understand, things are changing on an almost daily basis and everyone is quite busy as clean up continues and damage is repaired. People are pitching in to help each other such as when The Copper Easel hosted a “pop-up event” for Keaton & Lloyd on July 28 to help the shop sell books.\n\nHere’s an update on Capitolfest and the local businesses.\n\nWhat to expect at Capitolfest\n\nCapitolfest 21 is happening just as scheduled from Aug. 9-11 at the Rome Capitol Theatre (230 W. Dominick St.) with a focus on the films of classic film stars Edward Everett Horton and Reginald Denny. Here’s a link to the full film schedule.\n\nThe pre-festival activities are Aug. 8 with a “mixer” at 5:15 p.m., the same time the dealers room opens in its new location at 252 W. Dominick St. That’s also the temporary location of Keaton & Lloyd which will be selling books during Capitolfest. A screening of the documentary “Film is Dead – Long Live Film” is at 7:15 p.m. with an introduction by director Peter Flynn.\n\nApproximate hours for the dealers room and Keaton & Lloyd are 5:30 to 8 p.m. Aug. 8, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Aug. 9-10 and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Aug. 11.\n\n“We’re working hard to make Capitolfest as normal and enjoyable as possible!,” owner Julie Whittmore shared in a message. “It will be different but I think it’s still going to be a good time.”\n\nSuperofficial will be open to sell coffee and tea and local food trucks will serve lunch. On Friday, Aug. 9, the Food Zone will serve Filipino Food. On Saturday, Aug. 10, it’s Arizona Tacos. On Sunday, Aug. 11, Chimos will have steaks and salads. There’s the possibility of other food trucks for dinner.\n\nOne note: Copperccino’s Coffee House, another favorite spot for Capitolfest attendees, is in the middle of a move to nearby 504 N. James St. so it will not be open for the festival. Stay up to date on the move via Copperccino’s Facebook page.\n\nHow to help\n\nAll the businesses, no matter the degree of damage, need help with repairs and making up for lost business. Here are just three ways to help businesses that are part of the Capitolfest experience.\n\nRome Capitol Theatre. This is the link to donate to the GoFundMe page for the Rome Capitol Theatre.\n\nKeaton & Lloyd. Here is the link to the GoFundMe page to help Keaton & Lloyd bookshop.\n\nCopper Easel and Superofficial: This link through Copper Easel has multiple ways to help out including a way to buy eGift cards and also donate to the wide reaching Rome, NY Emergency Response Fund.\n\nThe first time Ann Harding’s face appeared on film was in the opening minutes of the 1929 film “Paris Bound.”\n\nShe’s a vision in white as a bride standing reverentially at her wedding altar next to her co-star, a baby-faced Fredric March. Her headpiece and veil tightly frame her face, with the veil wrapped around her forehead and hair, under her chin and across her neck.\n\nAnd there it is, captured in close-up and immortalized for us to see nearly 100 years later: the ethereal beauty of Ann Harding.\n\nEven as a long-time fan of the actress, I was unprepared for the grace and luminescence she exuded right from the opening moments of her film debut. I guess I thought she somehow crafted her otherworldliness throughout her career, as if it was something that could be learned. Ridiculous, I know. She was born with it.\n\nThat realization makes me laugh at myself because the first time I saw Ann Harding I was so caught off guard by her voice (and not in a good way) that I missed how the camera loved her. (Of course I adore her voice now.) Let me explain. It was not a full movie, but a preview for her 1929 romance “Condemned.” I distinctly remember the moment in that short preview that she growled out “I love him. I will always love him. I would die for him.” (“Him” was her co-star Ronald Colman and how can you not join her in proclaiming love for him?)\n\nIt was a deep and throaty voice, dripping with desperation. I didn’t know what to make of it. Well, I was in the minority.\n\nCritics and moviegoers who saw “Paris Bound” raved about Harding’s voice. Pathé studio took full advantage, promoting her as “the girl with the voice,” while ads for “Paris Bound” proclaimed “You’ll gasp at every word spoken!” Even dour New York Times critic Mordaunt Hall wrote that seeing Harding was a “joyous relief to study the work of an actress in a motion picture who is so modulated in her talking.”\n\n“Paris Bound” was the first in a winning trifecta that started Harding’s film career. Only a month later, in September 1929, “Her Private Affair” was released, followed in November by “Condemned.” These weren’t bit parts, mind you, she was the star. In fact, “Condemned” is the film that pushed her into stardom. (The next year, she would be Oscar-nominated for her role in “Holiday.”)\n\nThat’s three starring roles in three movies in three months: What a way to start a career.\n\nStardom bound\n\nBefore her successful transition to film in 1929, Harding was a popular stage actress in the early 1920s. By 1926, however, she was pushing herself to exhaustion, ignoring doctor’s orders to the point she even collapsed on stage. Taking forced time off, she relocated to San Bernardino, Calif. (she purposefully avoided Hollywood on the advice of friends). The slower pace was good for her, and she wasn’t in a hurry to return to acting, especially since she was a new mother.\n\nBut Hollywood couldn’t get enough of Broadway actors, luring people like Kay Francis, Joan Blondell, Leslie Howard and Clark Gable from the stage to the big screen. Harding was soon on its radar. (When Harding did make her screen debut, publicity for the film read: Ann Harding Broadway Favorite in “Paris Bound.”)\n\nOn a fateful day, former Broadway actor and Harding’s friend George Reicher took her on a studio tour at Pathé, which was looking for a new star to help them compete with larger studios. Reicher thought she would be great on film (he was right), and he finally convinced her to do a screen test which she did almost as a joke with her husband, actor Harry Bannister. Pathé was so impressed they kept making her offers and she kept saying no – until she met a character she couldn’t refuse.\n\nMary Hutton was a character in Philip Barry’s provocative 1927 play “Paris Bound” about a young married couple who are faithful in heart and mind, but not necessarily body. Reicher was the dialogue director for the film adaptation and asked her about playing the role. Harding loved the character of Mary Hutton enough to make it her first film role.\n\n“It’s such a grand part that I can hardly think of anyone else having it. I loved the character. She has intelligence; she thinks straight and recognizes her mistakes,” Harding is quoted as saying in her biography, “Cinema’s Gallant Lady” by Scott O’Brien.\n\nAnd that’s exactly who she embodied on screen in “Paris Bound”: a smart, thoughtful, passionate and independent woman. Let’s meet her as I write about Ann Harding’s film debut as part of the Classic Movie Blog Association’s “Screen Debuts & Last Hurrahs” spring blogathon.\n\nThe wedding that opens “Paris Bound” between Mary (played by Harding) and Jim (played by March) is a solemn event, not only for the vows being spoken but because of the obvious unhappiness of the guests. There’s the groom’s mother and father, long divorced after his infidelity; the dark-haired and pouty Noel (Carmelita Geraghty), miserable about Jim’s marriage; and the forlorn composer Richard (Leslie Fenton), who loves Mary.\n\nThey will all influence the lives of our young couple who are clearly over the moon in love and thrilled to be married.\n\n“I’m a fool about you,” Mary tells her handsome groom while guests are waiting for them at the reception.\n\nThey kiss, they touch, they speak in soft tones. They are wrapped in love’s embrace, emotions heightened by the palpable chemistry between the actors.\n\nTheir love is undeniable but there is something else they are acknowledging as they reference being a “modern couple.” They are so sweet that even as you hear the newly married Mary say she doesn’t believe in monogamy, you can’t quite believe it. “We’re too fond of people,” she says, as the reason she doesn’t expect to “never see another man and I don’t expect you to never see another woman.”\n\nYou’ve got every right to be puzzled because, as she does throughout the film, Harding is physically showing us the complexities of this woman. As she speaks words implying an open marriage, she gazes at Jim in adoration, rubbing his arm, putting her hand on his chest, embracing him. The words and the actions don’t quite match, nor will they in other important moments.\n\n“Whatever happens, let’s never quit each other,” Jim tells her with words they say as a solemn vow.\n\nBut, as we see early, temptation will follow them in the form of two of the unhappy wedding guests.\n\nRichard, the sad introspective composer, pines away for Mary. “I won’t forget the notes of a melody,” he says to her and about her. (Sigh – the man is tragically smitten.)\n\nNoel is bold, admitting her love for Jim with his new bride in the next room. She grabs him, trying to kiss him as he politely lets her talk but holds her back. “I am yours,” she says, even as he’s telling her to “quit the party and go home.” (“Quitting” a relationship is a common phrase.)\n\nThe film abruptly cuts to the third year of Mary and Jim’s marriage. They’re parents of a toddler son and their love appears strong from their cuddles and kisses during a tearful goodbye as Jim sets sail for a six-week business trip to Paris.\n\nIt’s during these goodbyes at the ship – there will be another one – that Harding best displays the depth of her character. She refuses to join her husband even as she tearfully clings to him, already missing him before he goes. She pushes him away, then pulls him tight, showing us how her beliefs about marriage are at odds with her heart.\n\nEven the next year (it’s an annual business trip), she stands firm in staying home believing married people “need a holiday from each other.” Harding’s face bears the pain of that decision, her body racked with emotion as she again sends her husband off, “Paris Bound.”\n\nJim hates “the forced holiday,” but she insists he goes alone.\n\nBut will he really be alone since Noel connives to “bump” into him overseas, asking if he has time for “coffee”?\n\nMeanwhile Mary innocently spends time with her long-suffering friend Richard at her home where he’s composing his next ballet on her grand piano.\n\nPassions will erupt, and beliefs will be questioned. What will never be in doubt is Mary and Jim’s love for each other, thanks to the lovely performances of Harding and March. Their scenes are intimate and natural, surprising qualities in a film made at a time when many stars were acting with broad gestures like they were still on stage and trying to reach the people in the back of the theater.\n\nBut not Harding. She was a natural in front of the camera who connected with moviegoers as a real person, not just a character. She would make 40 films, mostly from 1929 to 1950, and there was always an innate grace and elegance to her performances through movies like “Double Harness,” “When Ladies Meet,” Holiday” and “The Fountain.”\n\nOh, and we can’t forget the Harding film that remains my favorite, “Condemned,” the one that started it all for me. Harding plays the beleaguered wife of a violent prison warden on Devil’s Island who falls in love with inmate Ronald Colman. That scene I first saw in a preview where she desperately screams of her love for him and it made me almost … laugh? I now think it was because she was so raw in conveying her anguish that I couldn’t handle it. She couldn’t have given more of herself as an actress at that moment.\n\nIt’s no wonder that audiences in 1929 immediately fell in love with Harding or that movie fans like me continue to do so today, nearly 100 years after her film debut.\n\nThe blogathon\n\nThis post is part of the “Screen Debuts and Last Hurrahs” blogathon that is presented by members of the Classic Movie Blog Association.

And if you write about classic movies, consider joining CMBA.\n\nHe’s got a familiar face.\n\nAnd notably bushy eyebrows under his balding hairline. He did the 5 o’clock shadow decades before it was fashionable. Then there’s the burly physique and a gregarious laugh that would sometimes come out of nowhere.\n\nNestor Paiva certainly had a screen presence, and it could loom large even in the smallest parts he played throughout his career that included around 400 film and television credits.\n\nAs Manuel the “lobster king” in the 1955 Technicolor weepie “All That Heaven Allows,” for example, Paiva is only in one scene that lasts about 4 minutes but you will remember it. As soon as he arrives with his lobsters to a dinner gathering of friends, he infuses the scene with undeniable joy through his infectious laugh and smile singing and dancing along with Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson. He’s the life of the party and you can’t help but smile watching him.\n\nHis film career started nearly 20 years before “All That Heaven Allows,” with uncredited roles in the 1937 movies “Island Captives” and “Blazing Barriers.” That phrase “uncredited” would be a constant in the first decade of his early career, yet Paiva never slowed down and in fact persevered whether he played an uncredited role, a bit part or a generic character like a guard (multiple films), conductor (“Union Pacific”), bartender (“Music for Millions,” “The Southerner”), bad-tempered gambler (“The Girl and the Gambler”), a man with suspenders (“Reap the Wild Wind”) and, one of my favorite descriptors, “man in street when gypsies arrive” (“The Hunchback of Notre Dame”).\n\nThough he never reached leading-man status, moviegoers knew that familiar face and I, for one, still get a kick out of it whenever he pops up in a film I’m watching.\n\nFor that reason, I’m happy to share more about Nestor Paiva for the 2024 Luso World Cinema Blogathon which strives to raise the profile of Portuguese-speaking peoples and their descendants. The blogathon is co-hosted by talented writers Beth Ann Gallagher of Spellbound with Beth Ann and Brazilian film writer Letícia Magalhães of Critica Retro.\n\nPaiva was of Portuguese heritage – his parents were natives of the Azores region of Portugal – and he was often cast in roles that drew on that heritage and utilized his gift for languages. In fact, if you’ve seen Paiva act, you may only have heard him speaking a foreign language or in a heavy accent as he played Spaniards, Italians, Greeks, Arabs and Russians. Here’s the surprise: he was born in California.\n\nHis father Francisco “Frank” Caetano Paiva, arrived in the U.S. at age 7 in 1880; his mother, Mariana Luísa (née Freitas) came in 1896 when she was 17. Nestor was born in 1905 in Fresno, Calif., where his dad owned a grocery store, and graduated from Fresno High School where he did some acting and was in Glee Club. The family moved to Northern California in 1929 where he attended the University of San Francisco, then the University of California Berkeley where he performed on stage both on and off campus, and even directed plays. After graduation, he would become director of the Eight o’Clock Players troupe at KLX radio in Oakland. At one point, he worked at Lockheed Aircraft during World War II but never gave up acting.\n\nMany will recognize him from two notable roles: Spanish innkeeper Theo Gonzales on the Walt Disney series “Zorro” (and its film “The Sign of Zorro”) or as Captain Lucas in Universal’s “Creature from the Black Lagoon” and “Revenge of the Creature.”\n\nAt that time, he was beginning to earn roles substantial enough to be named in the opening credits and sometimes even right below the top two or three stars and deservedly so.\n\nAs a fan of 1950s sci-fi films, I fall in the latter category and love him in the two “Creature” films as well as the genre movies “Tarantula” (1955) and the underrated “The Mole People” (1956).\n\nSo while “Creature from the Black Lagoon” is known for Julie Adams, Richard Carlson and the wonderful creature, for example, it would have lacked its twinkle were it not for Paiva’s often oddly cheerful portrayal of the boat captain who had a childlike glee when he would sound the horn of his boat, The Rita.\n\nA look at his credits\n\nThere’s certainly not enough space to run down all of Paiva’s credits, but an overview would help show the scope of his career. He played Burt Lancaster’s father in “Jim Thorpe: All American,” was in “Young Man With a Horn” with Kirk Douglas and starred with Roy Rogers in “Shine on Harvest Moon” and “Along the Navajo Trail.” He was in “Mighty Joe Young,” “Joan of Arc,” “April in Paris,” “Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,” “Oh, You Beautiful Doll,” “Phone Call from a Stranger,” “5 Fingers,” “I, the Jury” and “Viva Zapata!”\n\nPaiva was ubiquitous on television Westerns of the 1950s and ‘60s including “Laramie,” “Wagon Train,” “Bonanza,” “The Virginian,” “Tales of Wells Fargo,” “Maverick,” “Cheyenne” and “Wanted Dead or Alive” – again the list is too long to mention here – and that doesn’t include television comedies or dramas like “Get Smart,” “Family Affair,” “The Addams Family,” “The Beverly Hillbillies” and “Perry Mason.” He also created multiple character voices over 26 episodes (1964-65) for the animated series “Johnny Quest.”\n\nA favorite of TV role is how ably portrayed the dual characteristics of the title character in “The Whimsical Bandit” episode of “The Lone Ranger.” He was indeed quite whimsical as a Mexican thief with a love of birds, nature and “the beautiful women” who he would never rob without giving them something in return like his gaudy ring.\n\nDon’t forget radio: He contributed to multiple episodes of “Tales of Texas Rangers” and the Bogart and Bacall adventure radio show “Bold Venture.”\n\nKey roles\n\nWant more Nestor Paiva? Here are a few films to check out.\n\nHope and Crosby connection\n\nPaiva was in three of the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby “Road to…” films, plus was in Hope’s “The Paleface.” He was a full-bearded villain in oversized flannel outfit and hat in “Road to Utopia” (1945). He turned on the comic charm as club owner Cardosa in “Road to Rio” (1947) where his exuberance in working with traveling American musicians played Hope and Crosby was encapsulated in the scene where he tells them “Very good boys, very boys. Groovy, groovy,” after first hearing them play. It’s just fun.\n\n“Lone Wolf in Mexico” (1947)\n\nHe played Inspector Carlos Rodriguez in a full uniform and a large smile, always happy to see his old pal Michael Lanyard – alias The Lone Wolf, a former jewel thief/now private detective – back in town – as long as he’s still retired. But when little things like murder start to happen, he implores Lanyard to “Tell Uncle Carlos everything. … Are you the mysterious killer, who shot the mysterious corpse?” He amusingly often talks to Lanyard almost like a child.\n\n“Creature from the Black Lagoon” (1954)\n\nChomping on a cigar while wearing the same rumpled outfit through this great Universal sci-fi classic, Paiva lets out big grins while somehow keeping the cigar in his mouth. He’s the perfect escort for the research expedition looking into a fossilized link between humans and sea creatures, while also providing folklore that adds to the suspense. “Don’t forget our catfish – they grow to be 9 feet long – and killers,” he says with pride. But don’t underestimate him: He’s the one who provides key information on drugs the natives make with roots to help catch fish. Oh, and he just so happens to have some on his boat.\n\n“Revenge of the Creature” (1955)\n\nNow the captain of the Rita II, he’s taking two more travelers through the Amazon to see if the Gill-man is still alive. If he is, he tells, them “you’ll be sorry you found him.” His main role in the sequel is to tell these two men, who have no idea what they are in for, the story of the original expedition and what they discovered. All he needed was a campfire for it to sound like a ghost story. “My men call it the Black Lagoon … paradise. Only they say no one has ever come back to prove it,” he chuckles. The clothing he is wearing looks suspiciously like the same outfit he wore in the original film.\n\n“Tarantula” (1955)\n\nPaiva is a big part of this giant-bug film, one of the best in the genre, playing Jack Andrews, the sheriff in a small Arizona desert town who helps a doctor and researcher learn what is leaving a trail of bodies. As you can guess from the title, it’s a tarantula and one that grows to the size of a house from well-meaning experiments to end world hunger. In a cowboy hat and Western shirt, Paiva is uncharacteristically clean shaven and without an accent as he works to save the day alongside John Agar, who plays the handsome Dr. Matt Hastings, and the equally lovely Mara Corday as lab assistant Stephanie Clayton.\n\n“Mole People” (1956)\n\nIn this inner-Earth sci-fi drama, Nestor plays Professor Etienne Lafare, who is working with archaeologists when they discover artifacts that point to a 500-year-old Sumerian civilization. He looks and sounds the part with a very heavy accent and wearing a pith (safari) helmet. Despite his better judgment, he joins the party traveling up a snowy mountain prone to avalanches to find the Sumerian civilization. They do, but as expected, it comes with unexpected results. Paiva surprisingly keeps up with younger and more fit companions, even rappelling 200 feet or so deep into a cavern, but the underground world of dark chambers and no sunlight will feed his anxiety and take a toll on his body.\n\n“Comanche” (1956)\n\nI’ve added this film because of its significance to Paiva’s family. He was married to Maxine Yvette Kurtzman in January 1941 until his death at only age 61 in 1966. They had a son and daughter, Joseph and Caetana, who appeared in a film for the first and only time here, as children killed by the Comanche. (An interesting choice.) Paiva played Puffer, a sidekick to Dana Andrews who tries to broker peace with the Comanche.\n\nThe blogathon\n\nIn celebration of World Portuguese Language Day on May 5, please read about other stars and filmmakers of Portuguese heritage through the Luso World Cinema blogathon.\n\nIt is co-hosted by Beth Ann Gallagher of Spellbound with Beth Ann and Letícia Magalhães of Critica Retro from May 4-6, 2024.\n\nMore from me\n\nIf you enjoy classic film creatures, read my monthly “Monsters & Matinees” column at Classic Movie Hub including:\n\nA feature on actress Mara Corday\n\nMeeting “The Ghost of Sierra de Cobra”\n\nAll bug-eyed over big-bug movies\n\nRevisiting the shades of fear in “The Leopard Man”\n\nMaida Walker isn’t on any list of great characters in classic movies, but she should be.\n\nShe’s played by the great Kay Francis in the 1939 romantic drama “In Name Only,” alongside co-stars Cary Grant and Carole Lombard. Oh, and John Cromwell directs. That’s a pretty impressive list of names by all standards.\n\nBut what I always think about first with this film is Maida, a character who had such a chilling effect on me that I stopped watching films starring Kay Francis.\n\nI’ll repeat that: I stopped watching films starring Kay Francis.\n\nGo ahead and laugh. I should have been able to separate the actress from the fictional character, but I couldn’t. Instead, I missed out for several years of seeing Francis in such gems as “Jewel Robbery,” “Trouble in Paradise” and “One Way Passage.” My loss.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI first saw “In Name Only” as a teen for the same reason I’m sure others were drawn to it: Cary Grant and Carole Lombard in a romance. (Swoon!) I knew it involved a love triangle and a loveless marriage and that was fine since it’s a traditional Hollywood story. But Maida was not a traditional wife.\n\nWhile I fell for Grant and Lombard, I was at once fascinated and appalled by the soullessness of Maida, the wife who would stop at nothing to get what she wanted. My strong reaction carried through the screen into life.\n\nSimply put: I hated Kay Francis.\n\nHate is an awful word, I know, but I don’t have another one to describe how she made me feel. Francis was so believable as Maida Walker, the society woman whose black heart was hiding beneath her gorgeous façade, that I wanted nothing to do with this actress or her movies.\n\nOf course, it wasn’t Francis who was evil, it was the character she so brilliantly portrayed. But I was haunted by Maida and the profound darkness that consumed her as she calmly schemed to get what she wanted out of her marriage – and it wasn’t love.\n\nShe was a master manipulator who taught me that evil in movies doesn’t always look like a beast. Sometimes it’s wrapped in a stunning dress, perfect hair and a warm smile.\n\nThat’s why I chose Maida Walker as my entry in “Blogathon & the Beast,” the fall blogathon from the Classic Movie Blog Association.\n\nNo, she’s not a literal beast, but she’s certainly a monster.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhile the plot is relatively simple, Maida is not.\n\nThe film opens with what we today call a meet-cute. Alec Walker (played by Grant) meets Julie Eden (Lombard) while he’s on horseback – all dapper in a suit and hat – and she’s “fishing” in a tiny brook and trying to balance on a rock. It’s such a storybook setting and they are both so pretty and charming that we expect them to immediately fall in love. We are not disappointed.\n\nJulie is a graphic artist who has rented a picturesque cottage for the summer that she learns was formerly owned by Alec. She’s a widow with an adorable 5-year-old daughter Ellen (Peggy Ann Garner).\n\nAlec is one of those down-to-earth rich guys who eschews his family’s wealth and its trappings. He’s married to the beautiful Maida (Francis) but wants nothing to do with her.\n\nThe connection between Alec and Julie is immediate: a cautious love at first sight. The story, then, is Alec and Julie trying to avoid their feelings, then accepting their feelings and being shunned by friends and family while they hope for a divorce and the chance to build a life together.\n\nBut what is Alec’s problem with Maida?\n\nGood question. From the first time we see them together he is callous, uncaring and rude. Not very Cary Grant-like.\n\nAlec’s parents (Charles Coburn and Nella Walker) don’t understand what’s going on. Neither does family friend Dr. Ned Gateson (Jonathan Hale) who is overprotective of Maida. No one is happy with Alec and we can’t help but wonder why.\n\nThe clues come early as Alec arrives home to find Maida and his parents waiting, but he refuses to be with them. Alone together, Maida gently tries to change his mind, but that only draws a surprisingly strong reaction from Alec.\n\nAnd if we’re honest, Maida seems perfectly reasonable and quite sympathetic. She is elegant and lovely, speaks softly and takes the blame in front of others for setting off her husband’s foul moods. She appears to be a perfect wife.\n\n“Even when we’re alone you can do it … make it look as if I’ve beaten you and make me feel like I want to,” he says.\n\nHe goes on to warn her that his parents might “learn the truth about us – you wouldn’t like that.”\n\nKeeping her composure she listens calmly, then strikes.\n\n“They won’t believe you, dear,” she says, wielding the word “dear” like a dagger through Alec’s heart.\n\nIt’s evident this woman is not the meek victim she pretends to be with others, but the true depth of her wickedness will take some time to reveal.\n\nAlec leaves to have dinner alone in town where Maida’s best friend Suzanne (Helen Vinson) flirts with him. He’ll have none of that but drives Suzanne home and, of course, they have an accident in front of Julie’s cottage. This is how Julie learns Alec is married and Maida realizes that Alec has feelings for Julie.\n\nJulie won’t be with a married man especially considering her sister’s pain in being left by her own husband. Maida, not so morally responsible, hatches a plan.\n\nShe arrives at the cottage the next day with a grossly oversized bouquet of flowers to “thank” Julie and invite her to a garden party.\n\nAnd this is where, slowly, a layer here and there begins to be peeled away to show the true Maida.\n\nAt the party, a distraught Maida (we know she’s distraught because she repeatedly raises her hand with a delicate handkerchief to her forehead) sweetly lies to the doctor about Alec and Julie. “It’s been going on for weeks. He’s getting so bold,” she tells the doc who runs immediately off to tell Alec’s parents. (Maida fact check: Nope, Alec and Julie just met.)\n\nThe naïve Julie arrives, only to be humiliated as she’s looked at as “the other woman.” (Maida fact check: Nope, these two have barely shaken hands.)\n\nAnd boy can Maida turn on the pity party with Alec’s parents as she takes the blame for his foul moods. “Don’t lie for him anymore,” they tell her.\n\nThis is how the film is played out. Alec pleads with Maida to leave him alone and get a divorce and Julie tries to stay strong with her moral code. Meanwhile, Maida dispassionately connives.\n\nTake the moment when Alec confronts her with a note she wrote to her past love David, who killed himself on the day Alec and Maida married. Instead of showing any remorse or sadness, she is cold-hearted.\n\n“I did love him. I was mad about him. I had a choice – I could take David and love and nothing else. Or I could take you and what went with you,” she tells Alec. “I took you.”\n\nThe coldness of those lines is chilling. Screenwiter Richard Sherman, who adapted the screenplay from the novel “Memory of Love” by Betsy Breur, gives Francis plenty of moments like that and she takes full advantage in crafting Maida.\n\nThere’s a scene where Alec convinces Maida to get a divorce while vacationing with his parents. He’s gone to see her off on the cruise liner to make sure she will hold up to her end of the bargain. She seems beaten to him, but she’s not.\n\n“I’m selfish in a lot of ways, even my worst enemy couldn’t say I’m stupid. I know when I’m beaten,” she tells him. But by beaten, she means it’s time to ramp up “the Maida.”\n\nAs the ship is about to sail, that troublemaker Suzanne shows up and taunts her. (I love how a ship departure was like a little party.)\n\n“Now honestly Maida, you’re not going to let that girl take Alec away from you?”\n\nMaida slowly walks toward Suzanne with a look we can’t quite make out.\n\n“What do you think,” she asks, a slight off-kilter, half-smile forming as one eyebrow is slightly raised. Maida looks, well, happy. It’s her battle face and she’s ready.\n\nSuzanne’s response is priceless: “Really Maida, you’re marvelous.”\n\nIt’s moments like that I find the most disturbing because Maida never shows her hand. She is the monster lurking behind an unsuspecting person who is moments away from a vicious attack. In Maida’s case it’s through deed and action that will leave internal scars on her victims. When Maida is at her calmest, she is at her most dangerous.\n\nYet with all that said, the full force of her malice isn’t seen until the end. It’s so powerful that I remember gasping at the same moment a character did on screen when Maida opens her malignant heart to its full depth.\n\nRewatching “In Name Only” recently made me wonder why I had such an adverse reaction to Francis because I now find her portrayal of Maida brilliant. Yes, you will fall in love with Grant and Lombard as they go through their heartbreaking journey, but Francis stole the film with acting that was powerful in its subtlety. A slight twitch of her mouth or the rise of an eyebrow was all she needed to show us a brief glimpse of the darkness within.\n\nI can see now that my strong reaction to Maida was because I was as naive in my young life on that first viewing as Julie is in the film when she says to Alec, with much sadness, “I didn’t know there were women like this.”\n\nWell there are and we can admire the actresses who have the skills to create these women in a way that makes us detest them so much.\n\nMaida Walker is a monster who destroys lives. Kay Francis is the actress who so vividly brought to her life. I am now happy to celebrate and enjoy both the character and the actress.\n\nThis story is part of Classic Movie Blog Association fall blogathon called “Blogathon and the Beast.” There are many more great stories written by members of the CMBA that explore this theme so please take time to read some.\n\nI find it tragic that many people are only interested in horror films at Halloween when these movies are delightful to watch all year.\n\nSo every October, I salute classic horror with my annual series of daily posts on X/Twitter under the hashtag #31daysofclassichorror. My hope is that the mention of a film might intrigue someone enough to check it out.\n\nFor the first time, I chose a theme this year: haunted house films. It was fun and I was surprised at how many of these films were horror comedies.\n\nI’ve pulled them together here to create a quick look at my #31daysofclassichorror as they appeared daily through October 2023 on X/Twitter via @toniruberto. There are a few spots where I added cast members or a few extra words, otherwise they read as they originally appeared.\n\nI hope you find something new to watch.\n\nDay 1: “Le Manior du Diable/Haunted Castle” (1896)\n\nLet’s start with what is considered the first horror film. In only 3 minutes, visionary director George Méliès set the standard for what we would see on screen for more than 100 years: Bats, demons, vampires and witches throughout the haunted castle.\n\nDay 2: “Fall of the House of Usher” (1960)\n\nEdgar Allan Poe via Vincent Price, Roger Corman and Richardson Matheson. Yes please.\n\nDay 3: “The Old Dark House” (1932)\n\nA dark and stormy night, stranded travelers, a creepy old house and Boris Karloff as a mute servant. Director James Whale makes it feel like fun & games until a hand reaches out from behind the wall. The great cast also includes Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Gloria Stewart.\n\nDay 4: “House of Darkness” (1948)\n\nLaurence Harvey made his film debut as a pianist haunted by the ghost of someone close to him.\n\nDay 5: “The Bat” (1959)\n\nA mystery writer (a spunky Agnes Moorehead) spends time at a secluded mansion with hidden passageways, dead bodies and someone – or something – with claws skulking the premises.

How about four masters of horror: Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and John Carradine along with, inexplicably, Desi Arnaz Jr.\n\nDay 31: “The Haunting” (1963)\n\nSaving the scariest for last. Robert Wise directed one of the most frightening films ever, yet never showed the monster, instead relying on sound, acting and camera work to freak viewers out. The scene where Julie Harris thinks that’s a human with her – except it’s not – has scarred me for life. After the first time I saw it, I slept with the lights on – and still do. Based on Shirley Jackson’s “The Haunting of Hill House.”\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIf you want to read more, here are other stories I’ve written that mention some of these films. Just click on the name of the film to read the story.\n\n“Amityville Horror”\n\n“The Bat”\n\n“Ghost and Mrs. Muir”\n\n“House on Haunted Hill”\n\n“The House That Dripped Blood”\n\n“Le Manior du Diable/Haunted Castle”\n\nAngela Lansbury is sitting across from Mildred Natwick and smiling.\n\n“I’m amazed that you even recognized me. My goodness, you know, it’s been more than 30 years,” she says to Natwick who returns her smile.\n\nThere is a real affection between the two actresses that we can feel even though we’re watching them years later and through our television in a scene from “Murder in the Electric Cathedral,” an episode from the second season of “Murder, She Wrote.” While those words were scripted, the women just as easily could have been speaking to each other in real life since they had worked together nearly 30 years earlier in the delightful 1955 musical comedy “The Court Jester.”\n\nThat little nod of recognition is one of the many ways Angela Lansbury’s long career was used to enrich her television series “Murder, She Wrote.” While millions tuned in weekly to be entertained by Cabot Cove’s most famous resident as she solved murders and mysteries, we got the bonus of a long and impressive list of guest stars that reads like a trip through film history.\n\nMany of the stars were brought up through Hollywood’s studio system along with Lansbury or acted with her on Broadway and that’s one reason we see so many familiar faces and big names throughout the 264 episodes and four feature films that comprised “Murder, She Wrote.” (There were nearly 2,000 during the show’s run from 1984 to 1996.)\n\nAnd that’s what makes “Murder, She Wrote” such a natural for the Classic Movie Blog Association’s spring blogathon, “Big Stars on the Small Screen.”\n\nHere’s a look at some of the big stars who joined Angela Lansbury as a guest on her show, plus other ways “Murder, She Wrote” ingeniously celebrated the Golden Age of Hollywood.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs the flirtatious real estate agent Eve Simpson, Julie Adams (“Creature from the Black Lagoon”) appeared in 10 episodes of “Murder, She Wrote,” more than other any actress outside of Angela Lansbury.\n\nIt started with “If It’s Thursday, It Must Be Beverly” (Season 4/Episode 7), one of the show’s most delightful episodes thanks to the actresses who play the gossipy customers in Loretta’s Beauty Shop who all, to their surprise, fell for a charming lothario. Along with Adams are Kathryn Grayson, Gloria DeHaven and Ruth Roman.\n\nThe actresses would reunite in “The Sins of Castle Cove” (S5/E17) about a young author who writes a tell-all book with thinly disguised residents of Cabot Cove, and “Town Father” (S6/E11) where Mayor Sam Booth (Richard Paul) is accused of fathering five children! (That gets the town talking.)\n\nWatch Adams in these 10 episodes: “If It’s Thursday, It Must Be Beverly” (S4/E7), “Benedict Arnold Slipped Here” (S4/E18), “The Sins of Castle Cove” (S5/E17), “Town Father” (S6/E11) , “A Body to Die For” (S7/E6), “Bite the Big Apple” (S8/E1), “The Witch’s Curse (S8/E12), “Programmed for Murder” (S8/E18), “Final Curtain” (S9/E11) and “The Big Kill” (S9/E17).\n\nHurd Hatfield, Lansbury’s co-star in “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” was a beloved lifelong friend who introduced her to her husband Peter Shaw. He appeared in three episodes starting with “Death Takes a Curtain Call” (S1/E10) in which Hatfield asks Jessica to help two Soviet dancers defect. (It also co-starred Claude Akins in his recurring role as Ethan and William Conrad.) In “One Good Bid Deserves Another” (S2/E17), Hatfield plays an auctioneer in an episode with Jerry Orbach as Harry McGraw plus Edward Mulhare and Karen Black. And in “Night of the Tarantula” (S6/E7), he’s the owner of a neighboring plantation when Jessica visits a friend in Jamaica for his son’s 30th birthday.\n\nAt MGM, Lansbury and June Allyson were in “The Three Musketeers” (1948) and later starred with Van Johnson in the musical crime comedy “Remains to Be Seen” (1953). On the TV series, the trio reunited in “Hit, Run and Homicide” (S1/E8) with Johnson as an inventor whose devices were used in a hit and run murder (as the title suggests). Allyson is his supportive former co-worker he fails to notice until it’s almost too late.\n\nJohnson returned for two other episodes: “Menace, Anyone” (S2/E20) and “Hannigan’s Wake” (S7/E4) which also starred Mala Powers, Guy Stockwell and Stephen Young.\n\nAn episode with a fun idea – a mystery involving poison pen letters – also had a great cast. “Sticks and Stones” (S2/E10) starred Marsha Hunt, Evelyn Keyes, Betsy Palmer, Joseph Campanella, John Astin and Denny Miller. The story is considered a take on “Miss Marple: the Moving Finger.”\n\nAnd there are so many more … (I can’t stop myself.)\n\nLook for Cyd Charisse as a former actress, Mel Ferrer as the hotel manager and Mary Wickes as a wealthy guest in “Widow, Weep for Me” (S2/E1) that finds Jessica posing as a rich widow at a Caribbean resort to investigate a friend’s death. This episode also marked the first appearance by Lansbury’s friend and Broadway (“Sweeney Todd”) co-star Len Cariou as Michael Hagarty, the MI6 agent who always gets Jessica embroiled in trouble.\n\nJane Greer and Michael Ansara are in “The Last Flight of the Dixie Damsel” (S5/E7) along with Martin Milner, Richard Roundtree and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. plus an uncredited Dale Robertson who didn’t like that the credits were done alphabetically on the series and wanted his name removed. (We still know who you are Mr. “Tales of Wells Fargo.”)\n\nSee Dorothy Lamour and former child star Patty McCormack in “No Accounting for Murder” (S3/E19) where Jessica helps nephew Grady who is suspected in the murder of his boss. Eleanor Parker is a leading being tormented before the opening of her new play in “Stage Struck” (S3/E10), an episode that also starred Edward Mulhare and Dan O’Herlihy.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThere are many more names (Diane Baker, Nina Foch, Rod Taylor, Milton Berle, Laraine Day, Tom Ewell, Anne Francis, Farley Granger, Howard Keel, Janet Leigh, etc. ) but let’s take a break and look at other ways the series honored classic films through memories, homages, tributes and yes, more guest stars.\n\nIt was done in small ways like in the vintage photos used on the set. Watch the opening credits of the suspenseful “Reflections of the Mind” (S2/E6) for the photo of a very young Lansbury and Ann Blyth on a table.\n\nIt happened in songs when Lansbury, playing Jessica’s look-alike British cousin Emma, sings numbers she first performed on film: In “Sing a Song of Murder” (S2/E5), the song is “Good-Bye, Little Yellow Bird” from “The Picture of Dorian Gray” (1945). For “It Runs in the Family” (S4/E6), the character of Emma sings “How’d You Like to Spoon With Me” from the 1946 movie “Till the Clouds Roll By.”\n\nThere are subtle nods to specific movies, too. “Death ‘N Denial” (S11/E13) is a fun reference to the title of Lansbury’s 1978 film ”Death on the Nile.” Her character’s name in that film was Salome Otterbourne; the Egyptologist in the TV episode is Sally Otterburn. Bonus: The episode also stars Turhan Bey from “The Mummy’s Tomb,” “Arabian Nights” “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieve” and “Sudan.”\n\n“Bloodlines” (S10/E6), set around the world of horses and horse racing, co-stars Mickey Rooney and Tippi Hendren in its tale of murder and fraud. Rooney plays a horse trainer in the episode, as he did in the 1944 film “National Velvet” which also starred Lansbury as the older sister of Velvet (Elizabeth Taylor).\n\nThen there were entire episodes inspired by a classic film.\n\n“Sorry Wrong Number” came through loud and clear in “Crossed Up” (S3/E13). Jessica is stuck in bed with a sore back during a hurricane when a faulty connection “crosses up” the phone line and she overhears a murder plan. Of course, she’s not believed even when a body is found, so she enlists the help of nephew Grady (Michael Horton).\n\n“Incident in Lot 7” (S8/E13) is all about “Psycho” and it is so much fun, especially for Hitchcock fans. The episode starts with a lively instrumental version of “Hooray for Hollywood” playing over the opening credits. As Jessica’s limo pulls into Universal Studios where they plan to adapt her newest book into a film, the music skillfully morphs into the theme from “Alfred Hitchcock Presents” (“Funeral March of the Marionette” by Charles Gounod). You know this is going to be great and it is Jessica becomes entangled in a murder that takes place in the original “Psycho” house on the studio lot.\n\nThe episode skillfully uses imagery and sound from “Psycho” including the famous Bates Motel sign, the shower curtain, the drain with water swirling around it just as it famously did in the Hitchcock film and those screeching violins!\n\nWe’ll even watch the scene – as Jessica does – of private investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsalm) climbing the stairs inside the house as a door slowly opens at the top of the landing. (Poor Arbogast.) Then the scene plays out again this time with brave Jessica walking up the same stairs while the same door opens. (Run!)\n\nMy favorite “Murder, She Wrote” episode inspired by a classic film is the ingenious “The Days Dwindle Down” (S3/E21) which acts as a sequel – yes a sequel – to the 1949 detective film “Strange Bargain” starring Jeffrey Lynn, Martha Scott and Harry Morgan. The film’s tidy end was tweaked so that the story could continue here as Jessica works to clear the name of a man released from jail after 30 years for a murder he swears he didn’t commit.\n\nHere’s the most excellent part: the episode reunites actors Lynn, Scott and Morgan and uses clips from the original movie. And it keeps on giving with appearances by Gloria Stuart, June Havoc and Richard Beymer.\n\nI previously wrote at length about this episode in the 7th annual “Favourite TV Episode” blogathon hosted by Terence Towles Canote from his blog, “A Shroud of Thoughts,” so I won’t duplicate that article, but I can’t help but share tidbits from this clever episode with other classic movie fans.\n\n[Read my original story: When “Murder She Wrote” brilliantly became a sequel to a 1949 film]\n\nIt was the idea of Executive Producer Peter Fisher who was exploring new ways to tell a story and thought about building an episode around a classic movie that would also star some of the original cast. That last part would be difficult given the passage of years.\n\n“If only I could find an old movie where everyone was still around, then we could solve the case 30 years later,” he said in an interview in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAfter a year of searching, he found “Strange Bargain” and the episode, respectfully written by William Gerson, is fantastic. It even uses film clips from the original movie to augment the story. You can enjoy the “Murder, She Wrote” episode without seeing the film, but if you can watch both I highly recommend it.\n\nAnd, if after reading all of these wonderful names and ideas, you decide you only have time to watch one episode, I would suggest “The Days Dwindle Down” because of its reverence for classic Hollywood and its stars.\n\n* * * * *\n\nYou can find links to all of the wonderful entries in the Classic Movie Blog Association’s spring blogathon by clicking on this link to read more about “Big Stars on the Small Screen.”\n\nIf you’re a classic movie fan who has never seen “Just Imagine,” I’m confident you could never have imagined anything like this 1930 film.\n\nIt’s a pre-Code sci-fi musical comedy with Busby Berkley-like dance numbers, vaudevillian humor, a trip to Mars and a man brought back to life after 50 years.\n\nOf course, you’re curious – how can you not be? I was too, and that’s why it’s my choice for the Futurethon blogathon hosted by Barry from Cinematic Catharsis and Gill from Realweegiemidgetreviews.\n\nYou’ll find stories by many talented writers about movies set in the future on the two host websites, so please check them out.\n\nSet in 1980, personal little airplanes have replaced cars, pills have replaced food and people have numbers instead of names. Oh, and Mars is inhabited by twins – a good and bad version of each Martian.\n\nImagining a future\n\nIt was only minutes into “Just Imagine” that it was clear the film was going to be as wild and strange and perhaps even as inventive as it sounds. Time to suspend your disbelief and let your imagination fly.\n\nThe title is the set up for the film: A narrator asks viewers to “just imagine” various scenarios and if you can’t imagine what he’s saying, you’ll be helped by intertitles that spell it out.\n\n“Just Imagine what a difference 50 years can make!,” the narrator exclaims. Take a look at New York in 1880. It’s so quiet you can even hear the rustle of a bustle.”\n\nKeep imagining.\n\n“Just Imagine! The people in 1880 thought they were the last word in speed! Take a look at the same spot today,” the narrator continues as the setting changes to a busy Fifth Avenue filled with 1930s-era cars and people scurrying about.\n\nWe’re not done. Now imagine New York in 1980 where “everyone has a number instead of a name, and the government tells you whom you should marry!” And they aren’t kidding.\n\nThis 1980, as imagined by filmmakers in the 1930s, is a doozy. It’s a world of shiny 250-story skyscrapers, the sky is filled with small planes flying in orderly lanes, a new Prohibition is in effect, a spotlight turns on in your home when the doorbell rings and newborns are cheerfully ordered from vending machines.\n\nAnd as the narrator warned us, the government decides your love life and name. However, the number-names are shorted to letters alone that mostly sound like a name. For example, our two main characters are LN-18, said as Ellen, and J-23 is shortened to Jay.\n\nWe meet Ellen (played by lovely young Maureen O’Sullivan) and Jay (played by John Garrick) as they pull their planes together and hover in the air for a moment of privacy. (They’re in a zone which only allows hovering for 3 minutes, so a traffic copy yells at them to move along.)\n\nWatch in disbelief – or awe depending on your point of view – as Jay steps out of his tiny cockpit, walks on the wing of his plane and jumps over to Ellen’s aircraft and sits next to her. He’s got news that the government tribunal will decide the next day whether they can marry or if Ellen will be forced to wed accomplished businessman MT-3 (Kenneth Thomson). Sure enough, Jay’s lack of achievement causes the tribunal to match Ellen with MT (pronounce it “Empty,” which is a fitting name for the dull suitor).\n\nThough they have four months to appeal, our two young lovers are bereft. Jay is a pilot who has reached his job ceiling and fears he can never match MT’s accomplishments. (If only someone needed a pilot for a trip to Mars! Whoops – spoiler alert.)\n\nSo Jay does what people do in musicals– he sings. It’s the first of many songs that slow down the film and you may wonder, as I did, why there are so many songs anyhow. Here’s the answer.\n\nThe names above the title for “Just Imagine” are Buddy G. DeSylva, Lew Brown and Ray Henderson, a trio of well-known songwriters who had huge success in 1929 with the musical “Sunny Side Up.” They were then brought in to write the screenplay for what has been considered a musical version of the great 1927 film “Metropolis” (just look at the skylines and you’ll see the connection).\n\nOur musical trio may not have been great as screenwriters, but as songwriters they were important enough to not only have a 1956 biopic made about them, but it was with an A-List team of director Michael Curtiz and actors Ernest Borgnine, Gordon MacRae and Dan Dailey for the film “The Best Things in Life are Free,” the title of one of their most famous songs.\n\nThis is a good time to mention that while the film looks ahead to 1980, it is stuck in the ‘30s – if not earlier – as characters bemoan in song and words the modern world’s loss of innocence. “I like a girl like my grandmother used to be. That why I like Ellen, she’s an old-fashioned girl. I should have lived back in 1930,” Jay says and sings.\n\nJay is sharing this with his best friend RT-42 (Artie is played by Frank Albertson) who is also dating Ellen’s best friend and nurse D-6 (or Dee as played by Marjorie White, who gives the film much-needed comic relief).\n\nTo cheer Jay up, Artie takes him to watch an experiment where a doctor works to revive a man who was killed by lightning 50 years earlier on a golf course. (I can’t explain this strange turn in the story.) This Frankenstein-like experiment is a success as the dead man awakens to finish his swing and yell “Four!” The doctors cheer and then leave as if bringing someone to life is something they do every day.\n\nOur golfer Peterson (played by vaudeville star El Brendel, who gets top billing and is known for speaking with a strange Swedish accent) is upset. They just can’t leave him there – can they?\n\nOh yes, they can. “I’m through with you,” the doctor says. “To me you were just an experiment. If you’re unhappy, I’ll kill you again,” to which all the other doctors laugh.\n\nBystanders Jay and Artie take pity on him. They explain he needs a new name which becomes Single-O and they help him get used to his modern surroundings. First up is lunch. The cafe is a wall-sized mural with buttons. Put in a coin, push a button and out comes a pill that tastes like clam chowder, roast beef, beets, asparagus, pie ala mode and coffee.\n\n“The roast beef was a little bit tough,” Single-O says after taking the pill.\n\nNow, remember Jay yearning for a good old-fashioned girl from 1930? A similar refrain comes from Single-O who just wants the good old days back.\n\n“Back in 1930 a meal was a meal. You could see the thick steak with a jus running down … I don’t know boys, give me the good old days,” Single-O laments.\n\nHe’s given another pill that substitutes for alcohol, and it brings about more memories.\n\n“A big stein of beer with the foam on the top … there was something to drinking then. I don’t know boys, give me the good old days.”\n\nThat’s when a couple at a nearby vending machine decides it’s time for a baby and viola! Here it comes down the chute, all cute and cuddly and a few months old.\n\nBut wait, there’s more: We still have to get Mars and that is truly crazy town.\n\nScientist Z-4 (Hobart Bosworth) needs a pilot to take his new plane to Mars and wants Jay who resists until he realizes this would be his big accomplishment that would allow him to marry Ellen. The round-trip journey takes just under four months and will get him back to Earth in time for the tribunal meeting that will decide his fate with Ellen.\n\nThis miraculous space ship is Z-4’s works through the “absurdly simple” science of his greatest invention: the gravity neutralizer, the only thing that makes the trip possible. “With the speed of the earth’s motion and the rocket attachment, the plane will have sufficient momentum to make the journey.”\n\nThough Jay is warned about the dangers, he takes on the challenge and is joined by his best friend (“We’ve gone through everything together, there’s no reason we should stop now,” says Artie) and stowaway Single-O.\n\nThis big moment is anti-climatic as the tiny rocket takes off in a large puff of smoke that covers everything. On the trip, the trio of men do not need extra oxygen, special equipment or a place to sit as all the action takes place in one spot where they stand around a lot.\n\nOnce on Mars, we see that Martians wear scanty two-piece outfits (even the men who look like a cross between a gladiator and Fred Flintstone), they speak in grunts and other sounds, and use silly broad gestures with their arms and faces. And don’t forget about the twin factor which we’ll first witness during a large dance number with Martians dressed as apes.\n\nWill our hapless trio be able to figure out the good Martian twin from the evil one? Can they ever get back to their spaceship and in time for Jay to make the meeting with the tribunal? Or will poor Ellen get stuck marrying the lame MT guy? Just imagine the possibilities.\n\nBackground on the film\n\nIn this futuristic film, we never fully leave 1930 behind and that’s OK. The set design is bit minimalistic at times, but is inspired by art deco and the styles of 1930. The cityscape is a nod to “Metropolis” and was built as a giant miniature over five months by more than 200 people in a former Army balloon hangar at a cost of $168,000. The film received an Oscar nomination for best art direction by Stephen Goosson and Ralph Hammeras.\n\nIf you feel a familiar twinge watching “Just Imagine,” that’s because sets and scenes like the dancing girls on Mars, a large Martian idol with moveable parts, the planes/spaceship and futuristic sets were reused in “Flash Gordon” and “Buck Rogers,” among other films.\n\nThen there’s the laboratory scene where the doctor is reviving the dead golfer. It gives off strong “Frankenstein” vibes because it’s the first on-screen appearance for some of the equipment created by set designer and electrical effects expert Kenneth Strickfaden that was later used in multiple films including “Frankenstein” (1931).\n\nThe wardrobe is also reminiscent of 1930 as many of the gowns are in the gorgeous, figure-hugging style of the time, but there are a few interesting things to note. In 1980, men’s suits don’t have lapels. Plus, one side wraps across the body and is buttoned low on the hip and waist (you can see this in the lobby card above).\n\nThe nurse uniform has long slits that bare the leg up to the panties (pre-Code alert!). My favorite fashion is the “stay out” dress: Multiple pieces of a demure black dress with a white Peter Pan collar are unzipped and turned inside out to create a low-cut slinky white party outfit. Even the hat is transformed into a small purse.\n\nPredictions\n\nSo how did the film do with predicting the future circa 1980 (and even beyond)?\n\nIt did predict the air hand dryer and it’s much quieter than the industrial strength ones we use today. In the film, it’s a small circle on a wall above a sink that is activated with a foot pedal that will also fold up the sink and cleverly hide it behind a door when you’re done. That’s a pretty cool move.\n\nPeople can talk to each via a large video screen in their homes that’s like a supersized Facetime.\n\nYet even though we’re close to 50 years beyond the 1980 future setting of the film, we still haven’t hit some of its grandest moments and ideas – and that’s not necessarily bad.\n\nWe still drive cars, though now they’re starting to drive themselves. We haven’t had a manned trip to Mars and when we do, I’m sure the astronauts will need oxygen in some way. I’m happy that we still eat full meals instead of a taking a pill (that would be awful). And we still have babies the traditional way instead of ordering through a vending machine. Call me old-fashioned, but the only thing I want from a vending machine is candy.\n\nCast extras\n\nThe most recognizable face and name – by far – is Maureen O’Sullivan who is only 19 in this movie. Two years later, she would start her decade-long film appearances as Jane in the “Tarzan” movies, beginning with “Tarzan the Ape Man.”\n\nFrank Albertson is notable for roles in “Alice Adams” (1935) and “Room Service” (1938). He later guest starred in television westerns. In “Psycho,” he was the rancher whose $40,000 is later stolen by Janet Leigh’s character and was the mayor in the 1963 musical “Bye Bye Birdie.”\n\nWe all have that movie that gets us every time.\n\nThe one we can’t stop watching no matter how many times we’ve seen it.\n\nThe one we own on DVD or have in a streaming queue, but don’t think twice about watching it when it pops up on TV.\n\nIt’s so irresistible that we don’t even know how many times we’ve watched it. Ten times? Twenty? No, we’ll have to go with “umpteen” times. And the best part is that during every one of those umpteen times, we still laugh or cry or fall in love all over again. It’s something to be celebrated and that’s what we’re doing with the aptly titled “The Umpteenth Blogathon” hosted by Theresa Brown of “CineMaven’s Essays from the Couch.”\n\nLike many of you, I have a few films that fit into this category. I melt at the music and romance of “Laura” and “The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.” I revel in the ghostly poetry of “The Uninvited.” Even with my fear of spiders, I’m there for “Tarantula.” I watch each of those films every chance I get and yes, I own copies of them, too.\n\nBut there is one film above all that has the biggest pull on me – one with a train horn that might as well be a dog whistle since I come, sit and stay for another viewing of “Picnic.”\n\nOK, that’s not why I keep watching “Picnic” of course – that would be for the sheer beauty of William Holden and Kim Novak (and to watch that romantic dance again and again). But I still remember that sound from the first time I saw the film as a kid.\n\nIt was time for the Sunday afternoon TV movie, a weekly ritual I watched whether I knew the “old” movie it was showing or not. I didn’t know anything about “Picnic,” but it had my attention as soon as the iconic Columbia Pictures logo appeared with the unexpected sound of the train whistle.\n\nIt signaled that we were going on a journey and as a kid living in a city neighborhood, trains brought romanticized thoughts of travel to faraway places. Then William Holden jumped out of a freight car and, despite his dirty face and bare feet, I was a goner.\n\nBy the end of “Picnic,” I had fallen in love with the film’s romance and nostalgia. (As well as Holden and Novak.) I yearned for that bygone era of 1955 Kansas that I had never experienced with its porch swings, picket fences and a community picnic where people wore their Sunday best. It was a place where there was a “prettiest girl in town” (that would be Madge, played by Novak) and the arrival of a handsome stranger was news.\n\nAnd I learned that a dance could be truly life changing.\n\nShot in Technicolor and Cinemascope, it’s gorgeous to look at. And the score by George Duning – especially the main “Picnic” theme – is swoon worthy. (I’m hearing it in my head right now and I’m sighing.)\n\nWhat I didn’t understand at the time – but have appreciated in the umpteen viewings since – is that the slice of heaven in small-town Kansas was filled with as much longing, broken hearts and disappointment as anywhere else. With each viewing, I am drawn deeper into the characters, who all live lives of quiet desperation."
