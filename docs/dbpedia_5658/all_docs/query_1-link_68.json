They are characterized by elements that are opposite to those associated with utopia (utopias are places of ideal perfection especially in laws, government, and social conditions). A dystopia is, therefore, a place in which humanity is dehumanized and people live fearful lives. Furthermore, governing these societies are totalitarian regimes and often are faced with severe environmental catastrophes. Common elements of dystopias may vary from environmental to political and social issues to politics, religion, psychology, spirituality, or technology that may become present in the future.\n\n--This definition was written using the Oxford English Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, The Free Online Dictionary, and Dictionary.com.\n\nSee a book that you like but it's not at your MDC campus library?
