        "text": "Episode 1\n\nWhen the World Began...\n\nTime Span: 15,000 BC to 1800 AD\n\nThe opening episode of this 16-part documentary ranges across the continent, looking back more than 15,000 years to recount the varied history of the first occupants of the territory that would become Canada. From the rich resource of native oral history and archeology come the stories of the land's first people - how dozens of distinct societies took shape, and how they encountered a strange new people, the Europeans. Among the earliest of these epoch-making encounters is the meeting between Jacques Cartier and Donnacona, the Iroquoian chief whom Cartier first met on the Gaspé shore in 1534 and later kidnapped. Later on the Pacific coast, Nootka chief Maquinna encounters John Jewitt, the English sailor who became his captive and eventually his reluctant friend.\n\nComplete Credits for Episode 1\n\nProducer/Director/Writer: Andrew Gregg\n\nProducer: Gail Gallant\n\nCo-producers: Julia Bennett and Lynn Glazier\n\nEditor: Jacques Milette\n\nCinematography: Michael Sweeney, CSC, Hans Vanderzande\n\nFeaturing: Yvan Ponton (Jacques Cartier), Michael Mahonen (John Jewitt), Jonathan Jacobson (Maquinna), August Shellenberg (Woodlands Storyteller), Tantoo Cardinal (Plains Storyteller), Lucie Idlout (Inuit Storyteller), Evan Adams (West Coast Storyteller), René-Daniel Dubois (André Thevet), Roger Honeywell (William Cormack)\n\nVIEW, READ & DISCUSS THIS EPISODE\n\ntop of page\n\nEpisode 2\n\nAdventurers and Mystics\n\nTime Span: 1540 To 1670\n\nWith the search for the Northwest Passage and the expansion of the Grand Banks fishery, the New World soon becomes a destination for permanent European colonies, in Newfoundland and along the St. Lawrence. Samuel de Champlain begins his legendary journeys, and the precarious beginnings of New France are established. It is an era of unprecedented alliances and devastating conflicts with native people, driven by the merchants' search for furs and the Jesuits' quest for souls. After a half-century of struggle, with the colony on the verge of extinction, Louis XIV takes personal control, sending French soldiers to defend the struggling outpost and eligible young women, the \"filles du roi,\" to become their wives.\n\nComplete Credits for Episode 2\n\nDirectors: Claude Lortie and Serge Turbide\n\nAdditional sequences by Andrew Gregg and Laine Drewery\n\nWriters: Hubert Gendron and Gene Allen\n\nJournalist-Researchers: Denyse Beaugrand-Champagne, Claude Bérrardelli\n\nCo-producers: Metchild Furlani, Lynn Glazier\n\nEditor: André Daigneault\n\nCinematography: Gaetan Morriset, Maurice Chabot, Pierre Mainville\n\nOriginal music: Claude Desjardins and Eric Robertson\n\nFeaturing: C.

New France's populace includes shop keepers, artisans, farmers and landlords, as well as fur-trading expansionists like Governor Frontenac and his commercial partner, Robert Cavelier de La Salle, who build a network of Indian alliances and extend French trading posts to the Gulf of Mexico. But this fast-paced growth brings New France into ever more bitter conflict with the wealthier and more numerous - but less venturesome - British colonists to the south. The story culminates with the heartrending deportation of more than 10,000 French Catholic Acadians as the struggle to possess North America enters its final, decisive phase.\n\nComplete Credits for Episode 3\n\nDirectors: Serge Turbide and Claude Lortie\n\nWriters: Hubert Gendron and Gene Allen\n\nJournalist-Researchers: Denyse Beaugrand-Champagne, Claude Bérrardelli\n\nEditor: André Daigneault\n\nCinematography: Gaetan Morriset, Maurice Chabot, Pierre Mainville\n\nOriginal music: Claude Desjardins and Eric Robertson\n\nFeaturing: Pierre Chagnon (comte de Frontenac), Graham Greene (Kondiaronk), Zachary Richard (Jean Labordore), Paule Baillargeon (Marie de L'Incarnation), Dominique Briand (Marquis de Sallières)\n\nVIEW, READ & DISCUSS THIS EPISODE\n\ntop of page\n\nEpisode 4\n\nBattle for a Continent\n\nTime Span: 1754 To 1775\n\nA period of a little more than two decades in the mid-18th century changes the destiny of North America. England and France battle each other in the Seven Years' War, a conflict that begins as a clash between les Canadiens and land-hungry American settlers in the Ohio Valley and becomes a world war that engulfs the continent. Fortress Louisbourg, symbol of the French empire, is the target of 27,000 soldiers and sailors in the greatest naval invasion in North America's history. In 1759, General James Wolfe leads the assault against Quebec but the citadel withstands a devastating siege and bombardment. With winter soon arriving, Wolfe forces the commander of the French troops, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, into one last desperate encounter. The battle for North America unfolds on an abandoned farmer's field, the Plains of Abraham, just outside the city's walls. When war ends in 1763, 70,000 French colonists come under British rule, setting in motion the ever-evolving French-English dynamic in Canada.\n\nComplete Credits for Episode 4\n\nProducer: Sally Reardon\n\nDirector: Serge Turbide\n\nWriter: Mark Starowicz\n\nCo-producer: Julia Bennett\n\nJournalist-Researcher: Richard Fortin\n\nEditor: Murray Green\n\nCinematography: Michael Sweeney, CSC, Maurice Chabot, Pierre Mainville, Derek Kennedy\n\nOriginal music: Claude Desjardins and Eric Robertson\n\nFeaturing: Guy Nadon (Louis-Joseph de Montcalm), Robert Joy (General James Wolfe), August Shellenberg (Pontiac), Diana Leblanc (Marie de la Visitation), John Gilbert (Sir James Murray), Leon Pownall (Benjamin Franklin), Simon Barry (Abby Jean-Felix Recher), Nigel Bennett (Sir Guy Carleton) Normand Bissonnette (François Gaston de Lévis), Paul Savoie (Marquis de Vaudreuil)\n\nVIEW, READ & DISCUSS THIS EPISODE\n\ntop of page\n\nEpisode 5\n\nA Question of Loyalties\n\nTime Span: 1775 To 1815\n\nAt the beginning of the American Revolution in 1775, American rebels invade Canada but despite the efforts of rebel spies to entice Quebec to join the revolution, les Canadiens refuse to take up arms against British rule, and the invasion ultimately fails. The mass migration of Loyalists that follows - more than 40,000 people in all - creates an English-speaking Canada virtually overnight. Over the next 30 years, the colony continues to develop. When the next American invaders arrive in 1812, they are fought to a stand-still at the battles of Queenston Heights, Chateauguay and Lundy's Lane, setting boundaries that remain today. The cast of characters includes the audacious military commanders General Isaac Brock and Colonel Charles-Michel de Salaberry; Hannah Ingraham and her dispossessed Loyalist family; Benedict Arnold, the notorious traitor to the American Revolution; visionary Indian leader Tecumseh; Pierre Bédard, brilliant tactician of an emerging colonial democracy; and Canadian traitors who are publicly executed near Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nComplete Credits for Episode 5\n\nProducer/Director/Writer: Laine Drewery\n\nProducers: Wayne Chong, Grazyna Krupa\n\nJournalist-Researcher: Martin Bisaillon\n\nEditor: Sheldon Beldick\n\nCinematography: Maurice Chabot\n\nOriginal music: Claude Desjardins and Eric Robertson\n\nFeaturing: Lorne Cardinal (Tecumseh), Stephen McHattie (General Isaac Brock), Nigel Bennett (Sir Guy Carleton), Eric Schweig (Joseph Brant), Claude Poissant (Pierre Bédard), Louise Marleau (Thérèse Baby), Holly Lewis (Amelia Harris)\n\nVIEW, READ & DISCUSS THIS EPISODE\n\ntop of page\n\nEpisode 6\n\nThe Pathfinders\n\nTime Span: 1670 To 1850\n\nThe Canadian west is opened by the great fur-trading empires of the Hudson's Bay and Northwest Companies, the native people who were their indispensable allies, and bold explorers and map makers who ventured from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean and long-sought-for Pacific. Pierre Esprit Radisson defies a governor to take New France's trade far into the continent's interior and later, founds an English trading empire; Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de la Vérendrye, spends a lifetime searching for the Western Sea and pays dearly for it. Tough Dene chief Matonabbee leads Samuel Hearne on a monumental trek into the Barren Lands; Alexander Mackenzie's dash to the Pacific makes him one of the most celebrated men of his age. And David Thompson comes to the forbidding shores of Hudson Bay as a 14-year-old apprentice and eventually unlocks the secrets of the West more than any other man. As the fur trader's day comes to an end, settlers on the prairies and gold miners in British Columbia begin to claim the west for themselves.\n\nComplete Credits for Episode 6\n\nDirector: Michelle Métivier\n\nWriter: Gordon Henderson\n\nEditor: Mark Solnoky\n\nCinematography: Derek Kennedy\n\nOriginal music: Claude Desjardins and Eric Robertson\n\nFeaturing: Gordon Tootoosis (Saukamapee), Art Kitching (Samuel Hearne), Geordie Johnson (Daniel Harmon), Shawn Smyth (David Thompson), James Douglas (Sir James Douglas)\n\nVIEW, READ & DISCUSS THIS EPISODE\n\ntop of page\n\nEpisode 7\n\nRebellion and Reform\n\nTime Span: 1815 To 1850\n\nBy 1830, the struggle for democratic government in the colonies of British North America has reached fever pitch. As the colonies grow in wealth and population, a generation of charismatic reformers -- Joseph Howe in Nova Scotia, Louis-Joseph Papineau in Lower Canada and William Lyon Mackenzie in Upper Canada - confront the appointed governors and their local favourites with one demand: let the citizens' elected representatives run their own affairs. In the Canadas, the struggle leads to bloody rebellion and disastrous defeat for the rebels. Yet within 10 years, the prize of self-government is won, thanks in part to an unexpected alliance between the French and English-speaking forces of reform.\n\nComplete Credits for Episode 7\n\nDirector: Peter Ingles\n\nProducer: Andrew Burnstein\n\nSenior Journalist: Frédéric Vanasse\n\nJournalist-Researcher: Martin Bisaillon\n\nEditor: Marc Jasmin\n\nCinematography: Pierre Mainville, Maurice Chabot, Gaetan Morriset\n\nOriginal music: Claude Desjardins and Eric Robertson\n\n\"Un Canadien errant\"\n\nfrom the album \"Émile Campagne\"\n\nproduced by Folle Avoine Productions\n\ndistributed in Canada by Universal Music.\n\nFeaturing: Martin Neufeld (William Lyon Mackenzie), Ted Atherton (Robert Baldwin), Randy Hughson (Joseph Howe), Alain Fournier (Louis-Joseph Papineau)\n\nVIEW, READ & DISCUSS THIS EPISODE\n\ntop of page\n\nEpisode 8\n\nThe Great Enterprise\n\nTime Span: 1850 To 1867\n\nIn a few short years, a handful of small and separate British colonies are transformed into a new nation that controls half the North American continent. The story of Confederation, its supporters and its bitter foes, is told against a backdrop of U.S. Civil War and Britain's growing determination to be rid of its expensive, ungrateful colonies. The dawn of the photographic era provides a vivid portrait of the diverse people who make up the new Dominion of Canada: the railway magnates, the unwed mothers of Montreal, the nuns who provide refuge for the destitute, the prosperous merchants of Halifax, the brave fugitives of the Underground Railroad, and the tide of Irish immigrants who flood into the cities.\n\nComplete Credits for Episode 8\n\nProducer/Director/Writer: Jim Williamson\n\nProducers: Fiona McHugh, Johanne Ménard\n\nEditor: Murray Green\n\nAdditional editing by: Ilona Crabbe\n\nCinematography: Michael Sweeney, CSC, and Maurice Chabot\n\nOriginal music: Claude Desjardins and Eric Robertson\n\nFeaturing: Domini Blythe (Jane Slocombe), Patricia Hamilton (Amelia Harris), Barbara Barnes Hopkins (Harriet Tubman), Robert Haley (Robert Wyte), Claire Jullien (Mercy Coles)\n\nVIEW, READ & DISCUSS THIS EPISODE\n\ntop of page\n\nEpisode 9\n\nFrom Sea to Sea\n\nTime Span: 1867 To 1873\n\nConfederation is barely accomplished when the new dominion must face an enormous challenge: extending its reach into the vast prairies and beyond, to the Pacific Ocean. But Canada blunders catastrophically in seeking to take over the west without the consent of its inhabitants, especially the Métis of Red River and their leader, the charismatic, troubled Louis Riel. The resistance of 1869-70 lays the groundwork for Manitoba to join Canada, but it also sets the stage for decades of conflict over the rights of French and English, Catholic and Protestant in the new territories. Thanks to an audacious promise of a transcontinental railway in 10 years, the settlers of British Columbia are more easily convinced of the merits of union; by 1873 Prince Edward Island has joined as well, and Canada can boast a dominion that extends from sea to sea.\n\nComplete Credits for Episode 9\n\nProducer/Director/Writer: Jim Williamson\n\nProducers: Fiona McHugh, Johanne Ménard\n\nEditor: Murray Green\n\nAdditional editing by: Ilona Crabbe\n\nCinematography: Michael Sweeney, CSC, and Maurice Chabot\n\nOriginal music: Claude Desjardins and Eric Robertson\n\nVIEW, READ & DISCUSS THIS EPISODE\n\ntop of page\n\nEpisode 10\n\nTaking the West\n\nTime Span: 1873 To 1896\n\nThe 1870s and 1880s are a time of trial for the young Dominion of Canada. The country's first Prime Minister, John A. Macdonald, faces economic depression in the fast-growing factories of the east and a new revolt in the west, led by his old nemesis, Louis Riel. The suppression of the Northwest Rebellion and Macdonald's single-minded insistence that the French-speaking Catholic Riel must hang for treason threatens to tear apart the fragile bond between Quebec and English Canada. During this same era, debates over provincial powers and the Manitoba Schools Question rage, and a dream is realized: the Canadian Pacific Railway links the country and opens the prairies to new floods of immigration.\n\n: Bill Cobban\n\nJournalist-Researcher: Martin Bisaillon\n\nCo-producer: Lynette Fortune\n\nEditor: Sheldon Beldick\n\nCinematography: Michael Sweeney, CSC, and Hans Vanderzande\n\nOriginal music: Claude Desjardins and Eric Robertson\n\nVIEW, READ & DISCUSS THIS EPISODE\n\ntop of page\n\nEpisode 11\n\nThe Great Transformation\n\nTime Span: 1896 To 1915\n\nMassive waves of immigration, a headlong economic boom with the growth of prairie agriculture and urban industry transform Canada between 1896 and 1915. Those who shape the new society include peasants from Eastern Europe, in search of free land; socialists who try to mobilize an emerging urban working class; and campaigners for temperance and women's suffrage. The dizzying pace of change also brings ethnic intolerance and racism, particularly against Asian immigrants. As well, growing tensions over Canada's role in the British Empire help put an end to Sir Wilfrid Laurier's reign in 1911. When World War I breaks out, a burst of enthusiasm in English Canada and resistance in French Canada foreshadows domestic conflict as wartime pressures grow.\n\n: Halya Kuchmij, Andrew Burnstein\n\nWriter: Andrew Burnstein\n\nResearcher: Xavier Gélinas\n\nEditor: Mark Solnoky\n\nCinematography: Maurice Chabot\n\nOriginal music: Claude Desjardins and Eric Robertson\n\nVIEW, READ & DISCUSS THIS EPISODE\n\ntop of page\n\nEpisode 12\n\nOrdeal by Fire\n\nTime Span: 1915 To 1929\n\nCanada's heavy military role in World War I (60,000 dead in a population of 8 million) transforms its society, its politics and its place in the world. The horror, bravery and sacrifice of trench warfare are evoked in Canada's great battles: Ypres, the Somme, Vimy Ridge, Courcelette and Passchendaele. The domestic consequences of Canada's war effort are also wrenching - the conscription crisis of 1917 marks a low point in English-French relations.
