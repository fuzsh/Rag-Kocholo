        "meta_description": "Style, Mavis Gallant once explained, is “the distillation of a lifetime of reading and listening, of selection and rejection.” The remarkable range of genres and media that the celebrated author consumed helps illuminate her aesthetics, her powerful epiphanies, and her inimitable writing. Indeed, it’s difficult to think of other postwar short fiction writers (particularly Canadian ones) whose…",

        "text": "A passage in “Voices Lost in Snow” helps to illustrate the tensions in Gallant’s view of urban life. In the Montreal of Muir’s youth,\n\nDvořák situates Gallant’s comic turns in a larger trans-genre artistic context:\n\nThe work of Mavis Gallant could be mistaken for uncomplicated realism: she crafts recognizable worlds populated with familiar characters and objects. This initial impression, combined with her relatively spare prose, can lead to misreadings that see her stories as merely providing a purportedly accurate representation of the world as it was in her lifetime. But Gallant — particularly when she is understood through her multi-genre engagements — offers far more, and I do not mean merely her dabbling in postmodern techniques. The effect of Gallant’s style, Dvořák observes, can be to lull readers until and unless they perceive that what she offers is the realism of a world that is strange and that discloses its unseen elements. These can be glimpsed in her omissions, in her characters’ dislocations, in her manifold ironies. Gallant’s fictional world is a familiar one, but it is one that is as multi-dimensional as a Cubist picture or a symphony, a realm that can take us beyond our current way of seeing."
