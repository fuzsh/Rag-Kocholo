        "text": "Disaster Films: Disasters have been the subject of film-goers' fascination since the time of silent film epics, and this interest continues to exist up to the present time. Catastrophes can take so many different forms - but they are mostly man-made or natural. They can be either impending or ongoing, or set in a distant future, or they can exist locally or globally.\n\nThe most-commonly portrayed disasters in films are:\n\nnatural or environmental disasters or destruction (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tropical storms, etc.)\n\naccidents (skyscraper fires, plane crashes, ocean liners capsized or struck by icebergs, viruses unleashed)\n\nthe result of human folly (mistakes, intentional and/or unintentional)\n\nplanetary-related (asteroids, comets or meteors off-course)\n\ncriminally-instigated (bombs planted in planes, terrorist conspiracies)\n\nsupernatural, including alien invasions and rampaging creatures/monsters/zombies or viruses (often mutant)\n\nnuclear-related crises, sometimes prophetically Biblical (nuclear war, Armageddon)\n\nmillennial-related or apocalyptic (the end of the world, or end of the century tales)\n\nthe result of failed technology or technology-gone awry (computers running amok, plague/scientific error)\n\nAlong with showing the spectacular disaster, these films concentrate on the chaotic events surrounding the disaster, including efforts for survival by the individuals experiencing the threat, the effects upon individuals and families, and 'what-if' scenarios. The best disaster films comment upon the negative effects of advancing technology, demonstrate the 'hubris' of scientists and other individuals, deliver uplifting moral lessons of sacrifice, and provide a 'how-to' in terms of survival skills.\n\nDisasters come in many different genres - they can be dramas, horror, science-fiction, war, or adventure films.\n\nMost disaster films have large-scale special effects (especially in the recent past's mega-budget spectaculars), huge casts of stars faced with the crisis, a persevering hero or heroine (i.e., Charlton Heston, Steve McQueen, etc.) called upon to lead the struggle against the threat, and many plot-lines affecting multiple characters. In many cases, the 'evil' or 'selfish' individuals are the first to succumb to the conflagration. As in any sub-genre, the move to capitalize on the 'disaster film' trend has led to many sub-par disaster films, with weak and unsubtle, formulaic plots, improbable circumstances and bad science, poor character development, and laughable acting from third-rate stars portraying cliched characters.\n\nThe Greatest Disaster and End of the World Films\n\nThe Silent Era Through the 1940s\n\nThere were many earlier action/adventure disaster films in the silent era through the advent of the talkies. Some of the most notable were The Hurricane (1937) - with one of the most spectacular tropical storm scenes ever shot in film history. And two 50's films, The High and the Mighty (1954) and Zero Hour (1957) - were the inspiration for all the airplane disaster films of the 70s. [Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent (1940) also contained a harrowing airplane crash sequence.] The real horrors of World War II (the Holocaust), and the perceived threat of nuclear annihilation and radioactive mutancy during the resultant Cold War led to a further onslaught of disaster-related films soon after in the 1950s.\n\nExamples of disaster films before 1950 included:\n\nRogue Comet Close to Earth Caused Chain Reaction of Disasters: The End of the World (1916, Den.)\n\nPompeii's Volcano Eruption: The Last Days of Pompeii (1913), The Last Days of Pompeii (1935)\n\nFlood Disaster in a CityScape: Metropolis (1927)\n\nWar Film with Deluge: Noah's Ark (1928)\n\nArid Winds, Drought: The Wind (1928)\n\nComet on Collision Course with Earth: La Fin Du Monde (1931, Fr.)

The early 1960s Cuban Missile Crisis, the late 60s Vietnam War, and the assassinations of JFK and MLK were only a few examples of how troubling the decade was.\n\nSinking Ocean Liner: The Last Voyage (1960)\n\nShipwreck: Swiss Family Robinson (1960)\n\nInexplicable Bird Swarms and Attacks: The Birds (1961)\n\nNuclear Explosions Causing Planetary Imbalance, Floods, Fires: The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961, UK)\n\nGigantic, Worshipped Moth (Nuclear Radiation-Produced) on Japanese Island: Mosura (1961, Jp.)

Actual disasters, such as the Watergate crisis (from 1972 to 1974), the collision of two 747s in the Canary Islands (in late March, 1977), and the Three Mile Island incident (in late March, 1979) made the time ripe for Hollywood to contribute. Big-budget disaster films provided all-star casts and interlocking, Grand Hotel- or \"Ship of Fools\" type stories, with suspenseful action, races against time, and impending crises in locales such as aboard imperiled airliners, trains, dirigibles, crowded stadiums, sinking or wrecked ocean-liners, or in towering burning skyscrapers or earthquake zones. There were also a number of films about how pollution, overpopulation, and biological warfare was destroying society. To be popular, successful or enduring, a disaster film must have a distinct crisis or dangerous predicament that can be easily visualized, and it must also reflect problems in individuals or in society.\n\nProducer and director Irwin Allen was nicknamed \"The Master of Disaster\" in the 1970s due to the tremendous success of his films. The three films most responsible for jump-starting the renaissance of spectacular disaster films were the social drama Airport (1970) - the most popular film of 1970, and Allen's two special effects-laden epics The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and The Towering Inferno (1974). These kinds of films would often receive numerous special/visual effects Oscar nominations, but were often neglected for their acting performances:\n\nAirliners Imperiled:\n\nAirport (1970), an ensemble film with a devastating blizzard at a \"Chicago\"-area airport, and a desperate, unemployed individual (plotting to collect on the travel insurance) with a bomb in his briefcase that was detonated on a Rome-bound 707 airliner, resulting in a crippled aircraft that needed to return and land; with an Oscar-winning role for Helen Hayes!\n\nAirport 1975 (1974), cockpit of 747 airliner hit by small plane\n\nAirport '77 (1977), passengers trapped in a jet 50 feet underwater in the Bermuda Triangle\n\nThe Concorde: Airport '79 (1979), bomb on-board plane bound for Moscow Olympics\n\nSpoofs: Airplane!

The sub-genre was really revived at this time with the emergence of advanced special effects techniques, and growing existential anxiety about the state of things. The focus of such films was often on the spectacular calamity and a small group of people in imminent danger, and how they must cope or devise a method of escape, or more recently, survive in the apocalyptic aftermath.\n\nHere's a representative sample of 'disaster films' from the 1990s:\n\nThreat of Global Nuclear Annihilation: The Hunt for Red October (1990)\n\nUnderground Worm-like Creatures: Tremors (1990)\n\nDeadly Spiders: Arachnophobia (1990)\n\nTerrorists, Assassination Plot: Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990), Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995), The Jackal (1997)\n\nArson on the Loose Causing Out of Control Fires in Chicago: Backdraft (1991)\n\nA Black Comedy Set in a Post-Apocalyptic Society: Delicatessen (1991, Fr.)\n\nTerminator Cyborgs From the Future on a Present-Day Mission: Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)\n\nTerrorists: Patriot Games (1992)\n\nAlien Clones Replicating Humans: Body Snatchers (1993)\n\nPrehistoric (Cloned) Dinosaurs: Jurassic Park (1993), The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), Jurassic Park III (2001), Jurassic World (2015)\n\nOil Company Corruption Endangering the Alaskan Ecosystem: On Deadly Ground (1994)\n\nGiant Mutant Ticks: Ticks (1994) (aka Infested)\n\nNuclear Weapons: True Lies (1994)\n\nGiant Mosquitos: Mosquito (1995)\n\nSpace Capsule Pending Disaster: Apollo 13 (1995)\n\nPost-Apocalyptic Doomsday World Besieged by Pirates After Melting of Polar Icecaps: Waterworld (1995)\n\nKiller Virus Epidemic Threat: Outbreak (1995), Twelve Monkeys (1995), Virus (1999), Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)\n\nAttacking Alien Invaders: Independence Day (1996) (the highest grossing film of 1996), spoofed in Mars Attacks!
