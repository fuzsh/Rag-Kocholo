        "text": "Our Hoboken Summer Reading Challenge for all ages runs through August 30; Hoboken resident card holders can track your reading and win prizes! Many readers will say that they will sometimes pick up a spooky read as a way to try and beat the heat or to pick up something a little more unconventional for their summer Beach Read. This along with a gothic, dark academia inspired setting is bound to pique the interest of those who are looking for something different to read for summer.\n\nWritten by author V.E. Schwab, Gallant tells the story of Olivia Prior, a girl who has spent most of her life growing up in Merilance School for Girls, with no connection to her parents, save only for her mother’s journal, that seems to only unravel into madness by its end pages. Then she receives an unexpected invitation to come home to Gallant, only to learn quickly that no one was expecting her when she arrives, greeted by family members that include a hostile cousin and the sight of ghouls in the hallways. In her search to uncover secrets, Oliva discovers an entrance way into a place that both is and isn’t Gallant, where the ghouls are solid and a mysterious figure rules over them all. Having always yearned for a place to belong, it’s now a question of whether Olivia will protect the world against the Master of the House or take her place alongside him.\n\nV.E. Schwab’s writing once again captures a beautiful and captivating narrative with her prose, immediately pulling the reader into a dark and gothic world that Olivia inhabits, providing just enough of a dark academia aesthetic within the first few chapters of the book. We instantly feel for Olivia due to how isolated she is within the walls of Merilance, having no friends and having been ostracized by almost everyone in her family, yet she shows her strength as a protagonist by showing us that she will not allow herself to become an easy target.\n\nSeveral key things become apparent once she arrives home in Gallant. She must first learn about the secrets within Gallant itself and thus learn more about herself and her abilities, and she must discover the fate of her parents. All of this we learn through Olivia’s journey within the pages of the book and every moment is well captured and leaves the reader wanting to know more. Even if you are unfamiliar with V.E. Schwab and her catalog of work, this is an excellent book to start with, especially if you are looking for something that has a spooky and gothic atmosphere.\n\nFor those who are seeking a book to start off their summer reading, Gallant is a fantastic read for anyone who wants something a little more gothic and chilling in their choice of beach reads.\n\nYou can also read my review of Schwab’s The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue a colleague’s previous post about A Darker Shade of Magic.\n\nnce she arrives home in Gallant. She must first learn about the secrets within Gallant itself and thus learn more about herself and her abilities, and she must discover the fate of her parents.
