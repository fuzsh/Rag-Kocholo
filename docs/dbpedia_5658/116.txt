Against the backdrop of World War II, Hollywood was busy cranking out scores of training and morale-boosting films. Among the popular feature-length, dramatic war, films included Mrs. Miniver (1942), Casablanca (1942), Desperate Journey (1942), Edge of Darkness (1943), and Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944).

But war films were just one of several sub-genres being made during the 1940s - there were an abundance of tear-jerkers, melodramas and romance films certain to summon the tears and the tissue box. These films included: Brief Encounter (1945), Journey For Margaret (1942), Letter From An Unknown Woman (1948), Waterloo Bridge (1940), Always in My Heart (1942), and Back Street (1941) and the perennial holiday favorite, It's a Wonderful Life (1946).

On the lighter side, included amongst these more somber films were the morale -boosting, star-studded extravaganzas; Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943), Stage Door Canteen (1943) and Hollywood Canteen (1944). These fun films feature loads of celebrity cameos, musical numbers and simple but fun storylines.

Although several A-list stars were enlisted in the service during the 40's, there were still plenty of stars in the making and actors from prior decades who peaked in the 40's. While not by any means a complete list, these actors who thrived in this era included: Joan Fontaine, Cary Grant, Robert Mitchum, Katharine Hepburn, Rosalind Russell, Errol Flynn, Claude Rains, Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell, Robert Taylor, Van Johnson, Ginger Rogers, Ann Sheridan, Greer Garson, Rita Hayworth, Hedy Lamarr, Dorothy Lamour, Veronica Lake, Ida Lupino, Lana Turner, Alan Ladd, Gene Tierney, Lauren Bacall, Linda Darnell and Glenn Ford.
