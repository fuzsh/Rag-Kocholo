        "text": "Although he appeared in more than 100 feature films by eminent directors such as Martin Scorsese, Ingmar Bergman and Hal Ashby, Carradine's best-known role remained that of Caine, an orphaned Shaolin monk travelling the American West in the 1800s, serenely spreading wisdom wherever he went. Despite his total ignorance of the martial arts, of which his odd, long-haired and metaphysically-minded screen character was a virtuoso exponent, Carradine's portrayal of the fugitive Chinese-American was one of the more unexpected television successes of its time, and played on British screens between 1972 and 1975.\n\nAfter Kung Fu, Carradine starred in the 1975 cult film Death Race 2000; with Liv Ullmann in Bergman's The Serpent's Egg in 1977; and with his brothers in the 1980 Western The Long Riders. For the next two decades his career languished, but being cast by Tarantino changed that.\n\nDavid Carradine was born John Arthur Carradine on December 8 1936 in Los Angeles, the son of the Hollywood character actor John Carradine. He claimed origins as exotic as the television character with which he made his name: he was said to have had English, Irish, German, Spanish, Italian, Ukrainian and Cherokee blood.\n\nAfter studying Drama at San Francisco State University he began work as an actor, changing his given name to David and taking stage roles as well as parts on television and in film.\n\nIn Kung Fu, the character of the young Caine was shown in childhood encounters with his blind teacher, Master Po, seen in flashback. These would invariably end with an enigmatic observation from Po to his protégé \"Grasshopper\" – a nickname which, accompanied by cod-philosophical musings, briefly became a popular catchphrase.\n\nCarradine's earlier roles included the lead in Shane (the 1966 television series based on the 1949 novel of the same name) and as a gunslinger in Taggart (1964), a film Western based on a novel by Louis L'Amour. He also starred in the Broadway version of Peter Shaffer's play The Royal Hunt of the Sun in 1965.\n\nAfter his breakthrough in the Kung Fu series, Carradine starred in several exercise videos teaching the martial arts of Tai qi and Qi Gong. Having had no knowledge of any martial art before landing the Kung Fu part, he not only developed an interest in it but became an avid adherent and practitioner.\n\nTwenty years later Carradine's career suddenly revived when he was cast as the eponymous anti-hero in Quentin Tarantino's homage to martial arts films, Kill Bill. Highly stylised, it featured the actress Uma Thurman, in a yellow jumpsuit, wreaking vengeance in a series of extreme fight scenes, one opposite Carradine, who earned a Golden Globe nomination as best supporting actor.\n\nCarradine was able to profit from his renewed fame, becoming the spokesman for the Yellowbook telephone directories in the United States. He was also the television face of the tea firm Lipton (\"This ain't no sippin' tea\"), in a memorable commercial where he paid homage not only to Kung Fu, but also to the Three Stooges.\n\nHe was interested in oriental herbs, exercise and philosophy, wrote a personal memoir called Spirit of Shaolin and continued to make instructional videos on tai qi and other martial arts.\n\nHe often pondered death. In a magazine interview in 2004, he said he used to keep a single action Colt .45, loaded, in his desk drawer, and confessed to contemplating suicide often. In the event, he was reportedly found hanged at a hotel in Bangkok. Curiously he had once recalled \"sitting in the window of the third or fourth floor of the Plaza Hotel for about an hour thinkin' about just tippin' off.\n\n\"And that was at a time when I was having more fun than you could imagine. I just thought: 'Who the f--- cares, man? Why don't I just split?' Of course I didn't, so there you go.\"\n\nDavid Carradine was married five times. His first marriage, in 1960, to Donna Lee Becht, ended in 1968, and he married, secondly, Linda Gilbert in 1977. This marriage ended in 1983, and in 1988 he married Gail Jensen. In 1998, he married his fourth wife, Marina Anderson, but this was dissolved in 2001."
