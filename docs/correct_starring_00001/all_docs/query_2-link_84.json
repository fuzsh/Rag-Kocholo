        "text": "Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003)\n\nFebruary 13, 2004 at 7:00 and 10:00pm in 26-100, and\n\nFebruary 15, 2004 at 7:00pm in 26-100.\n\nRanked in the IMDB top 100 movies of all time, this first installment of the Kill Bill movie is full of blood and gore that pays homage to the stylized art of Kung-Fu films. Writer/director Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) turns the traditional action movie cliches upside-down, beginning with a female protagonist who shows no mercy.\n\nUnlike conventional movies, Kill Bill is told in chapter format so the narrative flows more like a book than a film. On her wedding day, The Bride (Uma Thurman), a pregnant assassin, is shot by her former boss and head of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, Bill (David Carradine). Five years later, the Bride awakens from a coma and sets out to seek bloody revenge, striking down her fellow assassins, leaving Bill for last.\n\nCome join LSC for Kill Bill Volume 1, before Volume 2 opens in theaters!"
