        "text": "When David Carradine visited Sydney around the time of his career revival in Kill Bill: Vol 2 in 2004, he was still being recognised on street corners around the world for the legendary television series Kung Fu.\n\n\"You do hear 'snatch the pebble from my hand' a lot,\" he said. Wreathed in cigarette smoke and lively enough to jump onto a piano in a hotel bar and romp through some blues to entertain surprised drinkers, Carradine was far from concerned about being typecast for playing the serene monk Kwai Chang Caine in the show that introduced Eastern philosophy and martial arts to a Western audience in the 1970s. Not to mention bringing enigmatic phrases such as \"I hear the grasshopper\" and \"fear is the only darkness\" into the vernacular.\n\n\"Eighty per cent of the people who come up to me say 'the show changed my life',\" said Carradine. \"You can hardly call that a hassle.\"\n\nAnd for an actor who had lived hard - drugs, alcohol, five marriages - he was still working. He had made more than 100 movies by then, though nothing with the profile of his Golden Globe-nominated roles as the folk singer Woody Guthrie in Bound For Glory or as Bill in Quentin Tarantino's martial arts homage Kill Bill. It was more a DVD shelf full of titles like Karate Cop, Waxwork II, Hell Ride and Kung Fu Killer.\n\nDays from the end of shooting a French film called Stretch, Carradine has been found dead in a Bangkok hotel room. Thai police were trying to determine whether the death was suicide or a sex game gone wrong.\n\nWith similarities to the death of INXS singer Michael Hutchence in 1997, police said the 72-year-old actor was found dead in a wardrobe with a rope around his neck and genitals.\n\nHis manager, Chuck Binder, paid tribute to Carradine, saying: \"He was full of life, always wanting to work â€¦ a great person.\"\n\nThe actor came from a family of performers that included his father, John Carradine, and brothers Bruce, Keith and Robert. Born in 1936, he became a household name in the United States for Shane, a 1960s television Western. But that was nothing compared to the international success of Kung Fu, which earned him cult status as well as Emmy and Golden Globe nominations in the 1970s. He played a softly spoken, flute-playing loner wandering the American Old West in search of his half-brother, dispensing Zen-like wisdom.\n\nThe fashionable blend of Western and kung fu styles was the right formula for the times, lasting three seasons in its original format and spawning the 1986 film Kung Fu: The Movie, which starred Carradine and Bruce Lee's son Brandon.\n\n\"It was right at the moment when East met West,\" he said of the series's success. \"We were pre-empted by Richard Nixon shaking hands with Mao Zedong. And the whole tail-end of hippie culture was embracing alternative medicine and Eastern philosophy.\"\n\nAs an actor, he had a lean, sinewy strength and a commanding physical presence, though his martial arts skill was largely faked in Kung Fu. While regarded as a B-movie actor, Carradine worked with such celebrated directors as Martin Scorsese (in Boxcar Bertha and opposite Robert de Niro in Mean Streets) and Ingmar Bergman (The Serpent's Egg).\n\nIn the mid-1970s, he played a renegade driver in the apocalyptic thriller Death Race 2000 and was nominated again for a Golden Globe for Bound For Glory. While working regularly, Carradine failed to find success outside cult B movies as he indulged in drugs and alcohol.\n\nIn the mid-'90s, he returned to play Caine in Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, which ran for 60 episodes. A huge fan of his work, Tarantino cast Carradine in Kill Bill, introducing him to a younger audience and earning a fourth Golden Globe nomination."
