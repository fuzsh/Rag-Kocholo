        "text": "The son of Hollywood royalty, David Carradine amassed more than 200 screen credits in a career that ran from the 1960s to his death at the age of 72. Looking back on his career, he said: \"It always seemed to me like a mission. A holy one – like the Blues Brothers.\"\n\nCarradine was embraced as a soulful 1970s poster-boy courtesy of the TV series Kung Fu. His indelible performance as Kwai Chang Caine (aka Grasshopper), the mixed-race hero who is trained up as a Shaolin master, sparked a craze for martial arts on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nMartin Scorsese's Boxcar Bertha starred Carradine and Barbara Hershey as \"Big\" Bill Shelley and Bertha Thompson, a pair of roustabout train robbers in the American south. Conceived by producer Roger Corman as a Bonnie and Clyde rip-off, the 1972 thriller was shot on a poverty-row budget and served as a springboard for Scorsese to make Mean Streets the following year.\n\nHal Ashby's Oscar-winning Bound for Glory offered a clench-fisted tribute to the folk singer Woody Guthrie, down among the dust-bowl refugees of Depression-era California. Singer Tim Buckley was the initial choice to play Guthrie, but died before filming began.\n\nThe Serpent's Egg, Ingmar Bergman's lone Hollywood outing, provided a powerhouse role for Carradine as Abel Rosenberg, an American clown adrift in Weimar-era Berlin. The shoot was tense, with Carradine at one stage threatening to quit the production if the director pressed ahead with his plan to kill a horse on camera. Bergman compromised – up to a point. He ordered the horse to be killed off-camera, and then later filmed the corpse.\n\n\"Take my favourite superhero, Superman,\" drawls Carradine in the guise of Bill, the serene, slippery villain in Quentin Tarantino's 2003 tour-de-force. Carradine was not the first choice to play the role, and was only drafted in after Warren Beatty turned it down. And yet the actor made Kill Bill his own, serving as a formidable nemesis for Uma Thurman's heroine before bowing out with one of the great death scenes of modern cinema.\n\nThe spirit of Grasshopper lived on long after the TV series was put to bed. At one stage Carradine made a surprise guest appearance on the Lizzie McGuire show, teaching Lizzie's kid brother a few martial arts moves.\n\nThe Kung Fu mythos also lent a little weight to his role as a venerable triad boss in the Jason Statham action outing Crank: High Voltage.\n\nEven those outriders of modernity, the Jonas Brothers, were not immune to the Grasshopper effect. Here's Carradine, cropping up as a lean, mean Shaolin master in the siblings' video for Burnin' Up. The hair is white and the body has aged ... but you suspect that he could still teach these whippersnappers a lesson or two."
