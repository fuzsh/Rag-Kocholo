        "meta_description": "With director Quentin Tarantino’s typical filmmaking quirkiness, this action thriller tells the story of “the Bride” (Uma Thurman), a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, who is betrayed by her boss Bill (David Carradine). Along with his other assassins (Lucy Liu, Darrel Hannah, Vivica A. Fox and Michael Madsen), Bill brutally ambushes “the Bride” on her wedding day, finishing her off with a bullet to the head. But miraculously, “the Bride” survives the gunshot and, after a four-year coma, vows vengeance against Bill. So ensues her campaign of deadly retribution on one assassin after another, doing everything she can to Kill Bill.",
