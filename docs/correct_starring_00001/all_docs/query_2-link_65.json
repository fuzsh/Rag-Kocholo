        "text": "Actors\n\nDavid Carradine (born John Arthur Carradine; December 8, 1936 – June 3, 2009) was an American actor best known for playing martial arts roles. He is perhaps best known as the star of the 1970s television series Kung Fu, playing Kwai Chang Caine (a role he won over Bruce Lee), a peace-loving Shaolin monk travelling through the American Old West (years later he co-started with Brandon Lee in a TV movie sequel). He also portrayed the titular character in Quentin Tarantino‘s martial arts epic, Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003) and Vol. 2 (2004), with Uma Thurman. He also appeared in two Martin Scorsese movies: Boxcar Bertha (1972), with Barbara Hershey; and Mean Streets (1973), with Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro.\n\nHe was a member of the Carradine family of actors that began with his father, John Carradine. The elder Carradine’s acting career, which included major and minor roles on stage and television, and in cinema, spanned more than four decades. A prolific “B” movie actor, David Carradine appeared in more than 100 feature films in a career spanning more than six decades, including many films produced by Roger Corman. He received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award for his work on Kung Fu, and received three additional Golden Globe nominations for his performances in the Woody Guthrie biopic Bound for Glory (1976), the television miniseries North and South (1985), and Tarantino’s Kill Bill: Volume 2, for which he won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nOther notable films includeThe McMasters (1970), with Burl Ives, Brock Peters, Nancy Kwan, and Jack Palance; Ingmar Bergman‘s The Serpent’s Egg (1977), with Liv Ullman; Circle of Iron (1978), with Roddy McDowall, Eli Wallach and Christopher Lee; Walter Hill’s The Long Riders (1980), with brothers Keith & Robert, along with James & Stacey Keach, Dennis & Randy Quaid, and Christoper & Nicholas Guest; Safari 3000 (1982), with Stockade Channing and Christopher Lee; and Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat (1989), with Bruce Campbell, Morgan Brittany, and Deborah Foreman. Films that featured Carradine continued to be released after his death. These posthumous credits were from a variety of genres including action, documentaries, drama, horror, martial arts, science fiction, and westerns. In addition to his acting career, Carradine was a director and musician. Moreover, influenced by his Kung Fu role, he studied martial arts. On April 1, 1997, Carradine received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nEach review will be linked to the title below.\n\n(*seen originally in theaters)\n\n(**seen rereleased in theaters) Film\n\nTaggart (1964) – directed by R.G.
