        "text": "Why ‘Kill Bill’ Dropped Beatty\n\nMon, Apr 05, 2004, 03:04 PM PT\n\nBy Vanessa Sibbald\n\nLOS ANGELES (Zap2it.com) - It’s common knowledge that Warren Beatty was tapped to play the titular character in Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill” before, for some reason or another, the actor and director parted ways, leaving Tarantino to cast “Kung Fu” star David Carradine in the role instead.\n\nAccording to the director, while he and Beatty talked about doing the film “for a while,” “at the end of the day, it came [down to]: this is not the right movie for us to do together,” Tarantino tells Zap2it.com.\n\nHowever, Michael Madsen, who plays Bill’s brother Budd in the film, tells a slightly different story. In fact, he remembers going to a dinner party that producer Lawrence Bender held for Beatty so that he could meet the actor and “hang out and feel if we were comfortable with each other, seeing that we had to be brothers and all.” The meeting went well and about three days later Madsen got a phone call from the director.\n\n“He goes, ‘Well, I just fired Warren.’ And I said, ‘Oh my God. You did?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, yeah.’ He said, ‘He doesn’t understand what the movie’s about and I’m not going to go through this. He doesn’t understand what the movie’s about, he doesn’t want to do it and I don’t want him to do it,’” Madsen recalls.\n\nNot only that, but according to Madsen, Tarantino already had somebody in mind to replace Beatty.\n\n“I said, ‘Well who in the name of god is going to play Bill?’ And he goes, ‘Are you ready?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, I’m ready gdn it. Who is it?’ And he said, ‘David Carradine.’ And I remember that I was completely and totally stunned. I mean it so took me off guard. I wouldn’t of thought of David in a million years. At the same time I realized that it made more sense than anything,” says Madsen. “And the first time I saw David I knew that he could handle it and obviously he did, because he’s wonderful in the picture.”\n\nIn fact, according to Carradine, it may have been Beatty himself that suggest the “Kung Fu” actor.\n\n“Well, I would never say to anyone that Warren Beatty got fired. I think he and Quentin fell out of love,” Carradine tells Zap2it.com. “As I understand it from Quentin, it was Warren Beatty that said, ‘Why don’t you hire David?’ Because Quentin had essentially been writing it about me. The deal was with Warren and I can see the picture with Warren, I mean it’s a different movie, but if you’ve ever seen ‘Bullworth’ you realize that Warren is really capable of joining in in the kind of madness that’s a Quentin Tarantino movie. I think when Quentin saw that movie he went, ‘I didn’t think that Warren could do anything like that or would do anything like that.’ But then, eventually it came to me, which is how it was planned in the first place, but I think that’s fine. It’s certainly fine by me.”\n\n“Kill Bill Vol. 2” opens nationwide on Friday, April 16.\n\ntooken from everything tarantino and this link was giving for the story\n\n<LINK_TEXT text=“http://www.zap2it.com/movies/news/story … 15,00.html”>http://www.zap2it.com/movies/news/story/0,1259,---21115,00.html</LINK_TEXT>\n\nOk it was Beatty who was supposed to play Bill, I got that. I heard this a while back when they were getting the film ready to shoot, I just could not see it. Thank God they decided on David. Carradine is one awesome bad ass. But let’s just say he never go hired and the role of Bill was still to be cast and Carradine was never in the picture. Who do you guys think would have played an awesome Bill.\n\nA week ago I was thinking about that same question and I was watching Pulp Fiction and it’s quite an amazing thing the way QT brought back Travolta. Later that they I saw a commercial for Mountain Dew. And this was just me but I thought to myself Steven Seagal would have been pretty fucking cool in it. Seagal hasn’t been in a good movie in years maybe ever but there’s no doubt that the man knows martial arts. The man still has that great voice that would have matched perfectly with Michael Madsen as brothers. Who better to bring back an actor then QT. What do you guys think. I myself am left to wonder what if."
