        "text": "Like so many people, I am shocked and saddened by the news of David Carradine's passing. It's funny: there's nobody I know who doesn't love David Carradine. And in the many months that we worked together, he always showed up on set -- on time -- with a smile on his face.\n\nI'll never forget the first time I met him for the movie, with Harvey Weinstein. Quentin already had called him and told him he had the role -- before Harvey and I had even had the opportunity to even meet with him. So here's David having to come to meet the producers, after the director had given him the job. To say he was coming there with trepidation would be an understatement. He was very defensive and, honestly, I didn't blame him. But the second he looked at us with that David Carradine look that he gave, Harvey and I looked at each other and laughed and said, \"This is Bill!\" (the main character of our movie). From there, things warmed up pretty damn quickly and all was good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the most wonderful memories I have of David is from first day of training. We had created a training center where all the actors trained in the martial arts for three solid months, 9-to-5, five days a week. And there he was with his sword, and I couldn't help but think: I'm watching the TV show Kung Fu...only live and in person!\n\nEvery day for months Lucy Liu, Uma Thurman, Vivica Fox, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine would train -- it was a sight to behold. As has become legend, the shoot for Kill Bill went on so long we were actually able to create two movies out of it. But there was never one complaint out of David.\n\nPeople say that when you make a movie it's like creating a family... yes, sometimes a dysfunctional one, but a family nevertheless. And I speak for Quentin and all of us when I say we have lost a dear member of our family. He'll always be with us."
