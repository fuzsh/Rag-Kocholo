        "text": "Alright here’s a good place to post your reviews on Kill Bill vol. 2. This review is a few days old. I wrote it last Friday after getting a chance to see the film Friday morning at 12:30. It helps when your friends brother works at a movie theater. Anyway here it is. I sent this same review to Aint It Cool News and IMDB. It hasn’t been posted yet though.\n\nI was lucky last year in that I got to see Kill Bill volume 1 weeks before it was released last year. I thought it was one of the greatest things IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever seen on film and went on to see it eight times in theaters. I even chose it as the best film of 2003. Surpassing even the mighty Lord of the Rings. Something I thought would never happen. Me being a big Lord of the Rings fan.\n\nSo with such high praise for volume 1 my hopes were very high for volume 2. And it more than delivers. Where volume 1 focused more on the action and was fast paced. This one is at a slower pace and is more dialogue driven. Which is what Tarantino does best anyway. At approximately two and a half hours it is also a lot longer than the first one. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry though Kill Bill volume 2 is not without itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s share with great fight scenes and memorable new characters. The most memorable is Pei Mei the martial arts master who trained the bride and the other members of the Dead Viper Assassination Squad. Played wonderfully by Gordon Liu (who also played Johnny Mo in volume 1) Pei Mei even over shadows the mighty Hattori Hanzo played by Sonny Chiba in volume 1.\n\nOther memorable performances come from Michael Madsen as Budd a.k.a Sidewinder and David Carradine as Bill. Madsen gives another Mr. Blonde caliber performance as the former assassin turned trailer park alcoholic. Claustrophobics take caution the confrontation between Budd and the Bride is really intense and very claustrophobic. Darryl Hannah is deliciously evil as Elle Driver. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about as evil as can be. What should be noted is the fight between Elle and the Bride. What is unquestionably one of the most knock down, drag out, intense fights ever put to film. Tarantino pulls no punches here. Huge credit should once again be given to the sound department on this one. You can almost feel ever blow. It is the best fight in the whole of Kill Bill.\n\nNever seen and only heard in volume 1 we finally get to see the performance weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been waiting for. David Carradine is of course great in the title role. He plays the role with such a laid back ease. Both intimidating and cool. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know whether to sympathize with the guy or hate him.\n\nThose who said Uma Thurman deserved an Oscar nomination last year will probably say the same thing this year and then some. Where Thurman was praised for the intense action in volume 1, in this one she really goes all out. No longer a nameless assassin out for revenge she is now with a name (to be revealed in the film) and is now seen more as a person then a nameless killer. Not that the nameless killer thing was a bad thing. It was a great action role. This time the emotions come out. Thurman really lets herself go in the emotional scenes. Well worthy of a nomination.\n\nSo is Kill Bill volume 2 a worthy conclusion? Absolutely. Is it as action packed as volume 1? No. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a bad thing because we get more of the great Tarantino dialogue. Was there anything I found wrong with the film? Well, there was one little thing. The credits go on forever. So if your like me and you like to sit through the credits youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been warned. Kill Bill volume 2 will not be without itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enemies. Those who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like volume 1 will probably not enjoy this one. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a fan of volume 1 then you should be more then satisfied.\n\nMatt Putnam\n\nApril 02, 2004\n\n[quote]Alright here’s a good place to post your reviews on Kill Bill vol. 2.\n\nSo is Kill Bill volume 2 a worthy conclusion?

I am sorry but i am just not sold, a review with qualifiers like “If you didnt like the first one you wont like this one too” and other reviews talking about how you really dont need to have seen the first one to enjoy\n\nthe second, only confirm my assertion that its just continuation of the same bland story line with no depth, and an array of characters who still fail to connect with the audience. I am anxious to see this so called role of Carradines that apparently deserves a nomination for best actor (i hope you all noticed that Ebert and Roeper review only calls for a simple nomination and does not declare it as award winning.) Such things tell me that their claims are far fromt he truth like they did the last time around with Uma Thurman whose performance turned out to be not even worth mentioning in the same breath with the Academny awards. I have seen Carradine in his youth and his old age and wonder how in the world he would be able to pull off a convincing role as some ruthless murderer. Another thing that has my attention peaked is the length of the movie, 137 minutes. thats 2 hours and 17 minutes. If tarantino made the same mistake and is delivering the same mechanic characters in unconvincing roles, this movie is gonna get yanked from the theatres after less than 3 or 4 weeks. (Its just business nothing personal).\n\n[quote]\n\nThe reviews coming out are sounding predictable and much like the reviews of Volume one which to me was one of the worst films i ever saw and i am not shy about admitting that.\n\nFine the reviews seem positive but they largely seem to be an attempt at convincing the general public who might have found Vol 1 severly flawed that this time round, you shall have less of the over board action and Ã‚Â a deeper more intense story this time round.

Just because Kill Bill was the more liked action movie of 2003 doesn’t mean you have to attack it.
