        "text": "Editor's note: This interveiw with actor David Carradine ran April 18, 2004 to promote \"Kill Bill Vol. 2\"\n\n\"Kung Fu\" wasn't the reason Quentin Tarantino cast David Carradine as the title assassin in \"Kill Bill.\"\n\nSure, the maverick director was a fan of the'70s TV series. At the end of \"Pulp Fiction,\" the characters discuss the show, which featured Carradine as Caine, a vagabond martial arts master who exercises crippling moves and throws around Eastern parables.\n\nWhat convinced Tarantino that Carradine fit the bill, so to speak, was the actor's work in a lesser-known effort, \"Americana.\" The elegantly allegorical 1979 film, which Carradine wrote, produced, directed and starred in, is about a Vietnam veteran who volunteers to fix a small town's busted-up carousel and is rewarded for his efforts with hostility and violence. \"(Quentin) has seen it so many times he knows every shot and every line of dialogue,\" said Carradine, 67. \"He can actually recite it. In that picture, I was directing myself and that character is so much like me. It's the kind of performance where you don't do funny walks or accents or stuff like that, where you can see the real person inside the character.\"\n\nThe nameless drifter in \"Americana\" may seem worlds away from a jet-setting crime lord like Bill. Yet, the character behind the bloodshed, who was heard but never seen in \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1,\" isn't quite the soulless viper one would expect.\n\nWhen Bill is finally revealed on screen in the second part of Tarantino's exploitation opus, he seems rather brittle and melancholy. In most scenes, he's waxing spiritual or romancing the Bride (Uma Thurman), rather than crossing swords.\n\n\"Quentin did not hire me because I'm a martial artist,\" Carradine said. \"He hired me because I'm an actor. It's approbation for me because there's almost no echo of Caine in this part.\"\n\nAlthough the original \"Kung Fu\" series only lasted three seasons, and Carradine has made more than 100 movies and small screen projects since, he has continued to live in the shadow of Caine. The actor has spent much of the past 30 years punching the clock on shoestring thrillers and action-adventures.\n\nThat could change with \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2,\" which opened on Friday. Tarantino is known as a career reanimator, restoring the cachet of the names John Travolta, Robert Forster and Pam Grier. Even if blockbuster Hollywood comes knocking in the wake of \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2,\" Carradine may take a pass. He'd rather get his foot in the art-house door.\n\n\"There's something halfway between the independent thing and standard Hollywood films,\" he said. \"There are wonderful films that become studio films but they're conceived independently. That's where the action is. \"Being John Malkovich' is a great example of a picture you wouldn't think the studios would want and it turns out to be a movie that touches everybody's heart.\"\n\nWith his mystic aura and rangy, anti-hunk looks, Carradine is a true iconoclast in an industry that rarely rewards nonconformity. Only on occasion has the stage-trained performer been offered the chance to explore characters on the subtle end of the spectrum. There was \"Americana,\" Martin Scorsese's \"Boxcar Bertha,\" the Woody Guthrie biopic \"Bound For Glory,\" Ingmar Bergman's \"The Serpent's Egg\" and the western \"The Long Riders,\" which featured Carradine and his brothers, Keith and Robert.\n\n\"He's been undervalued as an actor,\" said Stacy Keach, a longtime friend who co-starred with Carradine in \"The Long Riders\" and \"Gray Lady Down.\" \"David is a real practitioner in details, nuance, which is where great art lives. He has a reservoir of imagination and a totally unique point of view about everything.\"\n\nCarradine is already on the road to renewed hipness not only with \"Kill Bill,\" but also \"Hair High,\" an animated parody of'50s teen fare by underground toonmeister Bill Plympton. Carradine has a supporting role as Mr. Snerz, a teacher whose smoking habit causes him to cough up his innards on a desk. The picture is currently playing the festival circuit and should be in theaters later this year.\n\nPlympton says \"Bound For Glory\" is his favorite Carradine film. \"David did a great job in portraying (Woody Guthrie),\" he said. \"David's a musician and an individualist and he has strong beliefs, that's why the character has such resonance.\"\n\nFor Carradine, Bill is the character that most reflects his inner self (except for the assassin part), with a combination of cultural refinement and libertine impulse.\n\n\"It's my sense of humor and my tastes,\" Carradine said. \"There's an aura of sophistication about him, the way he handles himself with children, that's all me. By the end of the first movie, you're wondering who is this ruthless monster. But he's a very charming guy, doting father and obviously hopelessly in love with (the Bride) even though the warrior ethic demands that they fight to the death.\"\n\n\"Kill Bill: Vol. 2\" is more contemplative, character-driven hell ride than the first movie. All the motivational blanks are filled through flashbacks and the action is centered on sharp words instead of lethal weapons. The Bride spends the film in pursuit of Bill and two of his flamboyant minions for the massacre that ended the life of her husband-to-be, left her in a coma and killed her unborn child (or so she thinks).\n\nAs unlikely as it seems, the role of Bill was originally to be played by Warren Beatty. It was only after the veteran heartthrob dropped out that Carradine scored the gig. For his part, Carradine thinks Beatty would have made a fine, if radically different, Bill.\n\n\"The guy's a genius and he's royalty. And there's a whole Cary Grant aspect of Bill, and Warren has a lot of that,\" Carradine said. \"The other thing, Quentin saw \"Bulworth' and he said, \"My god, I didn't think Warren could do stuff like this.' That's up Quentin's alley, that kind of madness.\"\n\nEven though Tarantino doesn't encourage ad libbing on the set, his films crackle with impromptu energy and the dialogue has a kinetic, off-the-cuff quality. Working with the director, Carradine said he felt a new sense of vitality in his craft.\n\n\"I'm analytical as an actor and one of the things Quentin did was free me from that. You get to the point where your performances are calculated, careful, and you can do it very quickly. Quentin broke me loose from that and got me to just blow my head off.\"\n\nCarradine is the second generation in a Hollywood acting dynasty that includes his father, character actor John Carradine; brothers Keith and Robert; nieces Ever Carradine and Martha Plimpton and daughter, Kansas. Carradine's first passion, however, was music. He studied composition at San Francisco State College and it was through writing songs for shows that he became involved with the drama department.\n\nAfter playing opposite Christopher Plummer in a Broadway production of \"Royal Hunt of the Sun,\" and starring in a short-lived TV adaptation of \"Shane,\" Carradine was offered the lead role in \"Kung Fu.\" The show tweaked all the conventions of the western genre, with a hero who slung fists rather than guns, and traveled from town to town on foot instead of horseback.\n\n\"Kung Fu\" was a surprise hit, but Carradine left after the third season.\n\n\"At the beginning, they told me if I did one season, the show was a failure,\" he said. \"If I did two, it's a marginal success. If I did three seasons, it's a hit. If I do four seasons, I get rich and if I do five seasons, I would probably own the studio. I wasn't interested in getting rich off a television series, and I also knew that by the fourth season I'd have less chance of becoming a movie actor.\"\n\nWhile he was playing the monkish character, Carradine off-camera took psychedelic drugs, cycled through four marriages and built a record of DUI arrests.\n\nHis habits and reputation cast him out of studio Hollywood and left him scraping for work in the B-realm. The actor, who's been sober since 1996, churned out as many as eight projects a year, most of them forgettable. Occasionally, however, he appeared in notable efforts like \"Kung Fu: The Legend Continues\"; the award-winning miniseries \"North and South,\" and the indie meditation on pulp philosophy, \"Roadside Prophets.\"\n\nOutside the acting arena, he performs and records with his country-rock band, David Carradine and the Soul Dogs, writes martial arts-oriented workout books and hosts tai chi retreats.\n\nHe may be doing voice work for another forthcoming animated project. Carradine says Tarantino has expressed interest in chronicling Bill's early life in'toon form.\n\n\"I asked him, \"Do I get approval of my cartoon image,' and he paused and said, \"Yeah, if I agree with ya,'\" Carradine said. \"That's Quentin. He's an absolute master of his own fate. If he agrees with you, he'll change his mind instantly. If he thinks that he's right, there's no way you can get him to change his mind.\""
