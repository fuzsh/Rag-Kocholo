        "text": "Madsen’s wife shouted to get his attention, “and I almost slipped off the roof,” says the actor, who worked with Tarantino in “Reservoir Dogs” and who plays the assassin Budd in ‘Kill Bill.'”\n\nHis wife said, “‘Quentin’s on the phone and it’s very important,'” Madsen recalls. “She climbed up the ladder to give me the phone. It was raining so hard I could barely hear. Quentin said, ‘I’ve got to tell you, I just fired Warren because it’s just not gonna work.’\n\n“‘So who the hell is going to be Bill?’\n\n“‘David Carradine.’\n\n“I was just kind of stunned, freaked out. Then I thought, hell, of course. Who else?”\n\nWho else indeed to play the cool master assassin? Carradine is the epitome of unruffled, an image cemented in his 1972-75 western TV series “Kung Fu.”\n\nMadsen recalls his first meeting with the man who would play his older brother in “Kill Bill.”\n\n“David was a very calm customer, very measured, very secure in his own body,” Madsen says. “… He’s very measured and very interesting.”\n\nIn other words, he’s a lot like many characters he’s played during a career that includes the movies “Boxcar Bertha,” “Mean Streets,” “The Long Riders,” “Bound for Glory,” “The Long Goodbye” and “Death Race 2000.”\n\nBut Carradine’s three-year stint as Kwai Chang Caine, a low-key, aphorism-spouting, half-American, half-Chinese Shaolin monk and martial-arts specialist stuck with the public and with casting directors.\n\n“With Warren, Bill would have been much more of the sexy old lion, a James Bond character, James Bond as a villain,” Tarantino told Entertainment Weekly. “David has a mystical quality, and that became more important at the end (of the movie).”\n\n“Kill Bill” is at heart a female revenge picture. Released in October, “Vol. 1” focused on Uma Thurman’s character, a retired assassin out to dispatch her former colleagues because they tried to kill her on her wedding day.\n\nThe assassins’ boss Bill is a phantom presence in “Vol. 1.” Mostly, you hear his voice. Cool and deadly, he moves to the center of the action in “Vol. 2,” which opens today.\n\n“There’s a lot of Cary Grant in Bill,” Carradine says during a recent stopover in San Francisco to promote the film. “He’s a very charming and sophisticated guy.”\n\nTall, slender and laid-back, Carradine charms listeners with a string of anecdotes covering subjects ranging from living in the East Bay to working with Tarantino.\n\nThe director wanted his new Bill to be like the old David. “It’s harder for me than for Cary Grant to go out and be myself,” Carradine, 67, says. “It’s hard for me to shake the actor, the Buddhist roles …”\n\nIn an un-Buddha-like gesture, Carradine flicks another cigarette butt into the bushes. He’s standing in the garden area of the Ritz Carlton Hotel in San Francisco.\n\nIt’s a sunny day. Imbibers and gawkers sit at nearby tables. A guitarist plays The Beatles’ “Michelle.”\n\nCarradine looks dapper in a dark suit, black loafers and untucked blue print shirt with the top buttons unbuttoned.\n\nA moment ago he lifted the shirt to show off some tattoos that cover his torso.\n\n“There’s a moon here, a tree you can hardly see anymore over here,” he says. People told him years ago he would regret getting tattooed. He didn’t listen. “I want more,” he says. Then, as an aside, he adds, “It really does something to women.”\n\nCarradine’s long, weathered face warms with a mischievous grin. His eyes reflect the same playfulness, as well as intelligence and curiosity, as if he’s measuring reactions to his words, which often pour out in tangents.\n\nCarradine lights another cigarette.\n\nThe conversation shifts to Tarantino and the director’s penchant for rescuing veteran actors on the outs, people such as John Travolta and Pam Grier. By casting each in a lead role, the director helped restart their careers.\n\nCarradine says it would be all right if that happens to him because of “Kill Bill.” “Not that I was hidden,” the actor says, flicking another butt into the bush. He has worked steadily in recent decades, albeit in low-budget films such as “Children of the Corn V.”\n\n“Quentin broke me kind of loose,” Carradine says appreciatively. “In all the critiques I’ve read about me (they say) I’m a natural actor, that I’m just playing myself. No. My art is to give the impression that I act off the top of my head.\n\n“The truth is I’m a cabinetmaker. Everything I do is awfully constructed, very structured and analyzed. I’m very analytical.\n\n“Editors love me because I absolutely repeat every move. I’m utterly consistent. I got that from my dad (actor John Carradine). Quentin would not let me do that. He insists that every take be different. Quentin made me wail.”\n\nTarantino’s a very technical director, Carradine says, but “he pushes the envelope all the time. He won’t stop till he gets his vision.”\n\nOnce, after doing a monologue for five days, the director told his star to give him one more take, something that Carradine hadn’t done before.\n\n“How could I throw all that stuff (I’d already done) away?” Carradine recalls thinking. “Quentin gets you out of yourself, to where you don’t know what you’re doing. You’ve given up control. … What he’s really doing is making me be me instead of an actor.”\n\nNot an easy transformation. Carradine was born into a family of actors led by his late father, a prominent character actor in films such as “The Grapes of Wrath” and the original “Stagecoach.” Carradine’s half-brothers Keith, Robert and Michael act, as do his daughter Kansas and his nieces Ever Carradine and Martha Plimpton.\n\nDespite the bloodline, Carradine originally planned to write operas or sculpt.\n\nBorn in Hollywood, he graduated from Oakland High School — class of’54, he thinks but isn’t sure.\n\nCarradine toyed with art and music before “kind of drifting into” acting while attending what was then called San Francisco State College.\n\n“Actors talked about human things, musicians basically talked about mathematics,” he says. “I did it (acting) and I liked it. I also discovered chicks were around me at lot. That was so cool. They were around guitar players and actors; we got into it because that’s where the chicks were. The drama department had the best looking women in the whole school.”\n\nReportedly, Carradine has been married four times and has three grown children. He lives in Los Angeles with his girlfriend Annie, her four children and a few dogs.\n\nNext on his agenda, other than buying his girlfriend a new camera, is the great unknown. He has no plans. Although, if Madsen has his way, Carradine will co-star with him in “Flying Bullets,” a script Madsen wants to make into a movie. “I’ll be the hero,” Madsen says. “David will be the villain. Quentin will do a cameo.”\n\nSounds like it could kill."
