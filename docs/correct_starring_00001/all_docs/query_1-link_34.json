        "text": "For the 2021 reboot, see Kung Fu. For other titles, see Kung Fu franchise.\n\nKung Fu is an American action-adventure martial arts Western drama television series starring David Carradine, Keye Luke, Philip Ahn and Radames Pera.. The series follows the adventures of Kwai Chang Caine, a Shaolin monk who travels through the American Old West, armed only with his spiritual training and his skill in martial arts, as he seeks Danny Caine, his half-brother.[1] It aired on ABC from October 1972 to April 1975, spanning a total of three seasons.\n\nThis is the first produced Kung Fu series, and was followed by Kung Fu: The Movie (1986), the television pilot Kung Fu: The Next Generation (1987), and sequel television series, Kung Fu: The Legend Continues (1993). A 2021 reboot of the same name premiered on April 7, 2021.[2]\n\nPremise[]\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Kwai Chang Caine (David Carradine), a highly trained Shaolin monk who must flee China and ends up traveling through the 19th century American West armed only with his spiritual training and his skill in martial arts, as he seeks Danny Caine, his half-brother.\n\nPlot[]\n\nKwai Chang Caine (portrayed by David Carradine and Radames Pera) is the orphaned son of an American man, Thomas Henry Caine (Bill Fletcher), and a Chinese woman, Kwai Lin, in mid-19th-century China. After his maternal grandfather's death he is accepted for training at a Shaolin Monastery, where he grows up to become a Shaolin priest and martial arts expert.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Caine's beloved mentor and elder, Master Po, is murdered by the Emperor's nephew; outraged, Caine retaliates by killing the nephew. Now with a price on his head, Caine flees China to the western U.S. where he seeks to find his family roots and, ultimately, his half-brother, Danny Caine.\n\nAlthough it is his intention to avoid notice, Caine's training and sense of social responsibility repeatedly force him out into the open, to fight for justice or protect the underdog. After each such encounter he must move on, both to avoid capture and prevent harm from coming to those he has helped. Searching for his family, he meets a preacher (played by real-life father John Carradine) and his mute sidekick Sunny Jim (played by real-life brother Robert Carradine), then his grandfather (played by Dean Jagger). Flashbacks are used in each episode as Caine recalls specific lessons from his childhood training. Young Caine or \"Grasshopper\" (portrayed by Radames Pera) learns at the monastery from his teachers, the blind Master Po (Keye Luke) and Master Chen Ming Kan (Philip Ahn) with the iconic nic-name given to him from a playful lesson given by Master Po about being aware of the larger world around the boy, including the grasshopper that happened to be at his feet at that moment.\n\nDuring four episodes of the third and final season (\"Barbary House\", \"Flight to Orion\", \"The Brothers Caine\", and \"Full Circle\"), Caine finds his brother Danny (Tim McIntire) and his nephew Zeke (John Blyth Barrymore).\n\nMain Cast[]\n\nDavid Carradine as Kwai Chang Caine - 63/63\n\nRadames Pera as Young Caine - 48/63\n\nKeye Luke as Master Po - 48/63\n\nPhilip Ahn as Master Chen Ming Kan - 40/63\n\nGuest Cast[]\n\nJohn Carradine as Rev.

Kung Fu was preceded by a full-length (90 minutes, with commercial breaks) feature television pilot, an ABC Movie of the Week, which was broadcast on February 22, 1972. The series became one of the most popular television programs of the early 1970s, receiving widespread critical acclaim and commercial success upon its release.[3]\n\nOn the week ending May 6, 1973, Kung Fu became the number one show on US television, drawing a regular audience of 28 million viewers. Around the same time, Bruce Lee's Hollywood debut Enter the Dragon was being completed. It was part of what became known as the \"chopsocky\" or \"kung fu craze\" after Hong Kong martial arts films such as Five Fingers of Death (King Boxer) and Bruce Lee's Fists of Fury (The Big Boss) topped the US box office in early 1973.\n\nContrary to some misconceptions, Kung Fu was not canceled and could have continued with strong ratings. The series ended when Carradine wished to leave the show after several sustained injuries. This allowed the producers time to write the final season so that all of the remaining story arcs regarding Caine and his brother could be drawn to a satisfying ending.[4]\n\nCasting Controversy[]\n\nSince its inception, Kung Fu has been called an example of yellowface and a prominent case of whitewashing.[5]\n\nMost of the controversy lies in the notion that the series’ idea was “stolen” from Bruce Lee, but also in the fact that he wasn’t cast for the leading role, and that decision had racial connotations. The “steal” notion has become widespread, both in academia as in the media, even internationally.[6]\n\nThis situation has led to the reboot of the series to be seen as a “righting of the wrong”, especially in light of the events of anti-Asian violence in the United States after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe casting for the leading role when the project was still a feature film had considered (among others) James Coburn, who was preferred by Ed Spielman. When the script became an ABC Movie of the Week, the casting process considered (among others) Bruce Lee, Mako, and George Takei. After having “sought every Asian in Hollywood, because you didn’t have to be super bright to know what was coming,” and found none that could carry the series, they turned to the American side of the character and began auditioning white actors, including William Smith and John Saxon. Just two weeks before the pilot’s filming started, David Carradine obtained the role at his second audition.\n\nAt the time, George Takei and the Association of Asian Pacific American Artists (AAPAA) filed a formal complaint for unfair hiring practices. They wanted an Asian actor in the leading role and a Chinese historical advisor; only the second demand was conceded. The Asian acting community was displeased, but with so few opportunities for Asian actors it was better to have a show that would be a source of work for them in secondary roles than not having it at all. James Hong (who was the AAPAA’s president), said: “As the show went on, we realized it was a great source of employment for the Asian acting community.”[7]\n\nThe series has been considered a commentary on race relations in the 1970's, both for its casting as for the depiction of discrimination against minorities[37]: Asians (“Pilot,” “Blood Brother,” “Sun and Cloud Shadow,” “The Garments of Rage”), Native Americans (“The Ancient Warrior,” “The Squawman,” “The Spirit Helper,” “The Predators”), Blacks (“The Stone,” “The Well,” “The Last Raid,” “Barbary House”).\n\nIt is noteworthy that race issues also affected the casting of secondary characters whereas gender inequality showed in their stories. France Nuyen and Nancy Kwan, both Eurasian, played Chinese characters, the first one accepting to being given in marriage as payment for service her husband was hired to perform, the other one preferring to be a concubine to the Emperor instead of the wife to the warlord who had raped her, this one played by Stefan Gierasch (wearing prosthetic makeup). Barbara Hershey appeared as a Eurasian woman who flees forced marriage with a warlord played by Khigh Dhiegh (born Kenneth Dickerson), and is refused entrance to the Shaolin temple as a student because “You are female - You are also of mixed blood.”\n\nIn Popular Culture[]\n\nIn the film Office Space, characters Peter Gibbons and Joanna start a relationship when they both admit to being big fans of Kung Fu and suggest watching it together.\n\nIn the film Pulp Fiction by Quentin Tarantino, Jules tells Vincent that he intends to \"walk the Earth like Caine in Kung Fu.\" Tarantino later cast Carradine as the title character in his films Kill Bill: Volume 1 and Kill Bill: Volume 2.\n\nIn the January 1974 edition of Mad Magazine, the series is parodied as \"Kung Fool\".[8]\n\nThe British comedy series The Goodies had an episode called \"Kung Fu Kapers\" which was mostly a parody of Kung Fu.\n\nA second-series episode of Fast Forward featured a parody of Kung Fu with Peter Moon playing Master Po and Steve Vizard playing Caine.\n\nHome Media[]\n\nWarner Home Video released the entire series on DVD in Region 1 between 2004–2005.\n\nOn November 14, 2017, Warner Home Video re-released all three seasons, as well as the complete series set on DVD in Region 1.\n\nThe extras include audio commentary by David Carradine on three episodes of the series, Zen & Now: A Dinner With David Carradine And Friends, documentaries on the series' production, and David Carradine's Shaolin Diary, a visit to China's Shaolin Monastery and the Great Wall.[9]\n\nNotes[]\n\nThe Shaolin Monastery which appeared in flashbacks was originally a set used for the 1967 film Camelot. It was inexpensively and effectively converted for the setting in China.\n\nThe series used slow-motion effects for the action sequences, which Warner Brothers had previously utilized in the 1969 Sam Peckinpah film The Wild Bunch and were also subsequently utilized for the action sequences in the science-fiction series The Six Million Dollar Man.\n\nDavid Chow, who was also a guest star in the series, acted as the technical and Kung Fu advisor, a role later undertaken by Kam Yuen.[10]"
