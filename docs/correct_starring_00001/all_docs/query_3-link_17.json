        "text": "You were in The Netherlands before, is that right?\n\nThat’s right. I followed Barbara Hershey here in the early seventies, who was my girlfriend. She was making a movie here called ANGELA. I just wanted to make sure they weren’t gonna hurt her, so I came to check ‘em out. That’s how I became good friends with Nikolai [van der Heyde, director of ANGELA]. I’ve seen him many times. He helped me a lot with MATA HARI.\n\nIs that finished yet?\n\nWell, sort of. I have some more work to do. I’m a little behind schedule. Haven’t worked on it for a while, but…\n\nBut you’ve been working on it for thirty years now. How do you keep the work on it organized?\n\nWell, the whole idea of it is: you watch these people get old as their characters. I always intended to take at least fifteen years to shoot it. So you can see myself and the other actors age without any make up.\n\nWhat’s the last time you shot anything for it?\n\nYears ago. I’ve been involved in editing, writing the music and cutting that in.\n\nHow important is making music for you as opposed to making movies?\n\nThat’s hard to answer. If I had a musical career that was as large as my acting career, maybe I could answer that. But as it is now, music is almost an avocation. You know, it’s not something I do for a living.\n\nYou started out as a musician though.\n\nUh-huh. Actually, I started out as a sculptor, but then I switched to music.\n\nDid you eventually gravitate towards acting because of your father?\n\nMy father certainly inspired me.\n\nDid your father encourage you?\n\nOh, sure. Once I began acting he was very supportive. The first thing I ever did outside of school, which was a production of Romeo & Juliet, he came up from Hollywood to San Francisco to see it. And right after he just sort of opened up to me with all this advice. He became very proud of me.\n\nYou also worked with your brothers a few times.\n\nYeah, I love that. I try to that as much as possible. I did KILL BILL with Michael Bowen, who’s a stepbrother of mine, and I did a film with him a few years before. Couple of years ago my brother Bobby had a TV show and I did a guest appearance. And I’m pretty sure Bobby and I are about to do a picture together.\n\nYou also did a concert together, right?\n\nMore than one. There’s one that is on film.\n\nWhat kind of music do you play?\n\nThe kind I write. I wish I could answer that question. People are always asking me that, but I can never say what it actually is. So I just have to go: blues-country-pop-rock-jazz-classical.\n\nCould you tell us how you got involved with KILL BILL?\n\nWell, Tarantino wrote it for me. He called me up on the telephone, said ‘come down and meet me’, handed me the script. That simple.\n\nDid you need some convincing or did you immediately like it?\n\nOf course. How could I not? Tarantino pulls everything in: all the things that you’ve done before. Just the way he is.\n\nDid you feel flattered?\n\nI think he always does that. He always writes with a certain actor in mind.\n\nDid he give you room to bring in some ideas of yourself?\n\nGive me room? I don’t think I would call it that. We had a lot of conversations off the set and I think some of the things I said in those conversations did dramatically affect the movie. On set you basically do what you do exactly the way he wrote it. He is an autocrat, an emperor on set. But he gives you a lot of opportunities and he listens. Which is a good thing for an emperor to do, if you think about it. I mean, look what happened to Louis XVI. Took his head off right here! [Points to his neck and makes a slashing sound]. Wouldn’t listen.\n\nBut Tarantino is a joy to work with and I would have been perfectly happy to do exactly what was written in the script and exactly what he told me. But as it turned out he wanted the input from us, relished in it.\n\nCould you give an example?\n\nSure. When we were in Beijing we went to a cigar bar together and smoked a couple of cigars, drank a little cognac. And we got into a conversation about comic books. We talked about Superman. A lot! And six days later almost our entire conversation became part of the movie. That’s one example. I’ll give you another: that long flute. That’s from a movie I did called THE SILENT FLUTE. I carried it around with me when we were training – we did three months of physical training: eight hours a day, five days a week – and every morning when we were stretching I played a little meditation music. And Quentin got interested and asked me a lot of questions about it. It wasn’t in the original script. He wrote new scenes as a result of knowing me for three months prior to shooting. That scene in front of the church that introduces the character also wasn’t in the original script. He said he wrote it after he came to know me better. He was constantly writing. I don’t think he sleeps.\n\nYou’ve done a wide variety of movies. You’ve worked with Ingmar Bergman and Roger Corman…\n\nAnd even below that.\n\nYes. You’ve worked with Fred Olen Ray.\n\nNot once, but three times.\n\nIs there a difference in how you approach the role?\n\nApproaching the role, I don’t know. There’s certainly a difference in the way the day goes. And the way the picture is treated, from its inception all the way to post-production. There are more compromises on a cheap picture, or on a picture with a director who actually has no idea what he’s doing. And then there’s a big difference in the way it’s distributed. Some go straight to DVD or whatever. And some of these pictures don’t even get finished. Nobody’s ever going to see them! But yeah, I worked with everyone from Ingmar Bergman to Fred… I can’t remember his name. But he was a football player. His nickname was The Hammer.\n\nFred Williamson.\n\nYeah! Fred The Hammer Williamson. He actually directed me once. I’m certainly the only actor on the planet who has been directed by both Ingmar Bergman and Fred The Hammer Williamson! [Laughs.]\n\nBut Fred was fun. On the level that he was working he was really good. He knew what he was doing and he knew the level on which he was at. And Corman’s like that too. He knows who he is and he’s comfortable in that level he works on. And sometimes it’s remarkable. Like DEATH RACE 2000, which was the second picture I made with him. He shot it in three weeks and nobody thought… nobody knew what was going to happen to it. And it turned out to be this huge cult classic. Now the big studio’s are gonna do a big remake of it.\n\nAnd the first picture I did with Corman was BOXCAR BERTHA, which was Martin Scorsese’s first Hollywood movie. Some of those experiences are pretty good. Some of them… you just take the money and run. On some pictures I’ve only worked one or two days. I might’ve not even known what the picture was all about. I remember someone coming up to me and telling me I was in a porno movie. I said: No, I’ve never done a porno. Well, the scene I did wasn’t porno, but apparently the rest of the movie was [chuckles].\n\nIs it true that Corman tried to convince you not to do DEATHSPORT?\n\nHe did, yes. He was right too. I knew it the moment I saw the picture. He warned me and I didn’t listen. He was determined not to pay anybody, except me. He didn’t want to put any money into it. He paid me what I was worth back then – this was right after the Ingmar Bergman picture – and that was pretty much the whole budget of the movie. Some of the acting is just awful. So were the special effects. I like the sword fights though. It was interesting because those swords were made out of Lucite [acrylic glass] and they were supposed to be made out of diamond, but you couldn’t do anything with them without them breaking. If you look closely at the fights you will notice that we never actually touch swords. And then they put these sounds in afterwards that made it sound like the swords are hitting each other. It worked.\n\nI remember another thing. We were chasing the sun. We were on top of a mountain in Los Angeles and the sun was setting as we shot the scene. And we would shoot some of the scene with the sun setting in the background, and then we’d jump in the Jeep and move to another hill where the sun was still there and shoot some more. We kept chasing the sun all the way through that movie. I don’t think it’s in the picture but there was actually a moment where there’s a close-up of me and the sun is setting behind me. Magnificent shot. And in the reverse the sun is blazing on the villain’s face, and I’m kind of backlit. There’s darkness behind me. It’s a statement. But I don’t think that shot ever made the movie.\n\nAnd then working with Claudia Jennings. A great beauty and remarkable woman. I really liked her a lot. And of course Richard Lynch. Very interesting man. And Jesse Vint was in that movie too. I did two or three Corman movies with Jesse. That was one of the great things about working with Corman. It was like the way John Ford used to work. You were working with the same guys all the time. That part’s fun.\n\nBut in this case the movie didn’t turn out so well. You regretted it a little bit…\n\nWell, it was at a moment when I really didn’t need to do a bad movie, you know? I didn’t know it was going to be a bad movie. I had talked to Roger about doing this movie and I thought: This is going to be great! The script was really good, but the director was insane. He didn’t have clue about how to visualize the film.\n\nWas that Allan Arkush?\n\nNo, he picked it up later. No, the guy’s name was Nick Niciphor. He quit halfway through. Luckily, Roger always has someone ready to throw in. It was well conceived but poorly executed. This was the last gasp of Roger’s pictures being distributed theatrically. Like I said, I didn’t need to do a bad picture at the time, because I was on a good roll. I don’t think my career ever quite recovered from that.\n\nWas there ever a time in your career where you thought you would leave exploitation movies behind altogether?\n\nWell, sure. But I gotta pay the rent. There was one period where I was working just as much as I could. And I got an award from Psychotronic Magazine – you know it? – they gave me an award for the Most Working Actor in the Universe [laughs]. Because I did nineteen movies in eighteen months. And they actually missed a couple!\n\nThe way I rescued myself from that was to put together the second series of KUNG FU. Because I said to myself: this isn’t going to last. And it wasn’t. That whole era of independent movies died. They clotted the market. I remember doing a movie for this guy and it was actually a pretty good movie, but when I ran into him later he said he had been to Europe trying to sell the picture and it was difficult because there were four or five other guys there also trying to sell a movie with me in it. He said I was competing against myself. I didn’t know how to get out of that, so I did that series as a way to remove myself from all that. And the independent movies I did after KUNG FU were a little different. They were more character driven, more interesting. Because they didn’t do those action exploitation movies anymore.\n\nThen I did some movies in Spain, Italy and other countries. And then uh… then Quentin showed up and now I’m back in the big time.\n\nHas KILL BILL already resulted in bigger offers?\n\nYeah, sort of. I think the greater part of that is yet to come. The first thing that happens is your manager gets a call from the studio producer checking your availability. That’s the first hint you get that they’re interested. Right now there are six different studio’s that have asked for my availability. So, surely one of those is going to come to fruition.\n\nWhen you did BIRD ON A WIRE that was the first big Hollywood movie you had done in a long time. How did that come about?\n\nJohn Badham wanted me for the part and I went in. I was offered a play at the same time, which was a tour of The King and I. And I had to make a decision which I was going to do. And I thought: the picture where the script starts with a close up of me is probably the thing I should do. And I knew John anyway. He did an episode of KUNG FU, with Jodie Foster at ten years old. And I was very impressed with him then. And he went off to have this pretty large career. So I was eager to work with him again. And I definitely wanted to work with Mel. I met him a couple of times and he had told me that THE ROAD WARRIOR was based on DEATH RACE 2000. He told me that. I don’t have to make that up. He was an interesting guy and I looked forward to working with him. Unfortunately, the way the picture was constructed I actually didn’t even work with Mel. And I didn’t work with Goldie Hawn. It was like there were two separate movies: one with Goldie Hawn and Mel Gibson and one with two bad guys who are chasing them but never quite catch up. So that was a little unsatisfying. But I had some fun on it.\n\nIt was a long shoot and right in the middle of it I had three weeks off where I had nothing to do. So I booked myself into another movie that was shooting on the other end of the continent. We were shooting in Canada and I went to Mobile, Alabama, which is where this other movie was shooting. Nobody even knew I was gone. I did three weeks shooting this picture called FUTURE ZONE, which was a sequel to FUTURE FORCE. And I had more fun on that than I did on BIRD ON A WIRE.\n\nIs that the reason why you keep returning to these kind of pictures, because of the fun you have making them?\n\nIt’s not only that. It’s basically this: you can only do the pictures you are offered. I like to work and I need the work. So, unless the part is odious I’m probably going to do it. At least in those days. I don’t know if that’s true right now.\n\nWhat kind of stuff do you turn down?\n\nI remember a script about a guy who does experiments with spiders and eventually he gets rolled up in a cocoon because the spider wants to breed babies with him. And I thought: I don’t think so.\n\nAnd I’ve turned down other things. Like THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU. The remake with Burt Lancaster, who was absolutely one of my heroes. I was offered that and I turned it down. Which may or may not have been a good idea. But right then I didn’t want to do a horror film. But it was my only chance to work with Burt Lancaster.\n\nSo, by and large, I do turn down a lot of stuff, ‘cause it seems everything is offered to me and I just choose the best of it. And sometimes the best of what I’m offered just isn’t that good.\n\nSo have you become more selective since KILL BILL?\n\nYeah, I have been very selective recently. I’ve been offered a couple of movies that I didn’t want to at this time. They offered a lot of money. And then I say ‘no’ and they come after me. They really want me to do it and they keep raising the price, you know? And finally I just have they say: look, I just don’t wanna do it! And that’s difficult. Because they’re raising their price and it comes to a point where it becomes really attractive to do, regardless of what picture it is. So I have to say: don’t ask me again! I don’t wanna end up saying yes.\n\nAnd part of it is: how are you going to feel when you’re playing this part? Are you going to feel bad for two and a half months? Playing a part you don’t like, in a movie you don’t like? It’s kind of destructive. And I’ve decided a few years ago that I don’t want to make any movies I don’t want to see. If it’s a movie I wouldn’t want to see, I’m not going to make it. And there are a lot of those movies, the kinds I don’t want to see. Teenage movies that have a lot of toilet jokes. Horror movies that are full of gore and awfulness and everything. But I love vampire movies! Love to do one again. I only did one.\n\nThe parts that you’re offered now, do they go back to your martial arts history, like KILL BILL did?\n\nNot really. They mostly want to cast me as a detective or a small town sheriff. That sort of stuff. There’s one script that I hope gets made. It’s a wonderful story of a troubled, lost man who recovers himself by meeting a boy. This kind of cures him and he cures the boy. Wonderful story. It’s the kind of dramatic role I was made for. But I also like the action stuff, the fighting. When I was doing KUNG FU filming the fight scenes were my favorite days. The catharsis of that physical activity really gets to me. But it’s not everything.\n\nDo you enjoy watching martial arts movies?\n\nYou know, I’ve never been a fan of kung fu movies. Of course I saw CROUCHING TIGER. And I saw THE MATRIX. Most of the second MATRIX, which I hated.\n\nSkipped the third?\n\nI did. They never should have made the sequels. To me, the power of THE MATRIX was that we had never seen anything like that before. They set up this surprise for us: that we think we are here in reality, but in fact we are not. We’re in the matrix. Once that is revealed to us, what are you going to do next? So, I never saw the third one. And if I don’t see a film in the theatre, I’m probably never going to see it, ‘cause I don’t watch television.\n\nYou don’t watch DVD’s either?\n\nLook, I have a DVD collection that goes all the way back to Eisenstein. Most of them are still in the cellophane. I buy ‘em and never watch ‘em. When I’m home that’s just not what I wanna do. I love going to the movies and mostly I pick very good movies. Only when the movie I want to see is sold out is when I goof up. Then I pick an awful movie.\n\nThere’s a lot of good movies. People complain that they’re not as good as in the golden age, but I don’t see it that way. I see remarkable performances, remarkable pieces of direction and we’re in this era where you can show anything you can imagine. It wasn’t always like that. Anything!\n\nAnyway, how did we get into that?\n\nI don’t know. Can you name one director you’ve never worked with but would like to?\n\nI don’t want to that because then I would have to leave out all the rest. I certainly would like to work with Tarantino again, and Scorsese and Walter Hill.\n\nHow about Larry Cohen? You did Q THE WINGED SERPENT with him and one of your famous quotes about that movie is that it would have been better…\n\n…without the bird, yes. It would have. That stuff between my character, the detective, and Michael Moriarty who played the small time crook, those were the most interesting parts of the movie. But Larry doesn’t make movies like that. He always has to have some kind of monster.\n\nActually, he did a great movie about J. Edgar Hoover. But look at IT’S ALIVE. Okay, it’s a horror film, but what that movie is actually about is the total indomitability of mother love. That a mother will love her child no matter how much of a monster it is. That’s interesting, but I don’t like the movie very much. I certainly don’t like MANIAC COP.\n\nBut you wrote a song for the movie, didn’t you?\n\nThat was MANIAC COP 2. I sold some of my songs to him. I had somebody selling my songs for source music, and when you’re doing that you sell your songs to anybody.\n\nBut Larry is a funny guy. What was that movie he did with Bette Davis?\n\nWicked Stepmother.\n\nYeah. She went a little crazy and he had to replace her. So right in the middle of shooting the movie he wrote into it that her character transforms herself into a beautiful woman, so he replaced her with Barbara Carrera. She was supposed to be a witch, so she could do that. Yeah, anything to save the picture.\n\nI want to ask you about Bruce Lee. Story goes THE SILENT FLUTE was a movie Lee wanted to do, but then he died. And before that there was KUNG FU, which….\n\nNo, no, no. That’s mythology. I think the way that story started was that they got it mixed up with THE SILENT FLUTE. Not sure how that happened. KUNG FU was never offered to anybody but me. Jerry Thorpe who produced and directed never had anyone else in mind but me.\n\nWhat happened with THE SILENT FLUTE was that Sterling Silliphant, who wrote the picture, and James Coburn were both students of Bruce. And between the three of them they conceived this. And I had seen the original treatment that Bruce wrote, which was pretty different. And then Sterling said: I will write it and the two of you will play the lead parts. And they tried to get it made, but were unable to for years. And then after Bruce made ENTER THE DRAGON, or right about that time, they finally got a deal to make it, and then Bruce turned it down. He had become very arrogant. I think Sterling’s agent called Bruce up in Hong Kong and said: we got you a deal for THE SILENT FLUTE. They’re going to give you a million bucks! Which was a whole lot of money back then. His answer was: You realize what time it is here? And so after his death, and after I had finished KUNG FU, somebody brought me that script and I read it. And I said: this movie has got to be made! I still like that movie a lot. It’s full of flaws. We needed more money to make it and things happened in post-production that diminished it somewhat. But I still like it.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that you don’t like martial arts movies when your own career is so intertwined with the genre.\n\nIt’s really not that intertwined with it. Of the 106 feature movie I’ve made, probably only about five of them had anything to do with martial arts. Of the 21 TV movies and miniseries I did none of them had anything to do with martial arts. If you look at all of my movies you will see very little martial arts. When you look at these guys who started out as martial artists and then get into movies, it’s all they do on screen. That’s it! Shit, I’ve done eleven Shakespeare plays!\n\nBut you also did a great fight scene with Chuck Norris.\n\nThat was pretty good, wasn’t it?\n\nWas it tough to film?\n\nWhat’s tough? Look, first job I ever had out of high school was working on a welding gang. Doing a fight scene with Chuck Norris for five days was a lot easier than that.\n\nYou directed some movies in the seventies. They were poorly released…\n\nYeah, that was one thing I did not have together. I knew how to make them, sure didn’t know how to distribute them. I won prizes with ‘em…\n\nI always thought your career could have gone the Clint Eastwood way.\n\nYeah, well Clint never stopped acting. And he mostly directed himself. But he had that ability to manipulate the industry. I don’t have that. I’m unable to sit down at a table with a whole bunch of these moguls and bankers and stuff like that and talk them into anything. Personally, I just don’t get along with that sort of people. And they don’t trust me because I’m not their kind of guy. Take for example Warner Brothers. The fact is I always refused to sign a contract for the KUNG FU series, so that I could leave whenever I felt like it. And when I did leave it was still very high in the ratings. The day I left it was actually number two in the Nielsen ratings. Sometimes it was number one. They never forgave me for that. They wanted me to go on for another two years.\n\nAs for Clint, he had created this strange kind of stardom in Italy. And when he came back he still couldn’t get anyone to put him in a movie, so like a lot of people do he found himself a horror movie, the one where the disc jockey is stalking him, and then he had the one where Geraldine Page cuts off his legs. In others words: in order to get a foot in the door in Hollywood he did these things that were very much unlike Clint Eastwood, because if you see what he did since that’s nothing like those movies. But he did that in order to manipulate the industry so he could get in. He realized the only way he was ever going to become a star is when he did it himself. So he put together his own company and started making movies he wanted to star in. You know, he’s the only guy who’s making westerns!\n\nYou ever met Eastwood?\n\nYeah, I met him couple of times. He’s kinda standoffish. Stared at me the whole time. [Laughs]"
