        "text": "I'm not one to write about actors passing but this is one worth writing about.\n\nMost people would know this guy as Bill from the Kill Bill series\n\nDavid Carradine 1936â€“2009\n\nIt is with deep sorrow that we confront the loss of our friend, David.\n\nDavid departed this life June 3, 2009 in Bangkok, Thailand while on location for a film. He will be sorely missed by family and friends the world over.\n\nCondolences have been pouring in from around the world. We have added a comment system to this page to assist site visitors in sending messages to David's family\n\nGreat actor and a void now in the film industry\n\nOh NO! That guy had such a presence on screen...he also did great voice work. He will be missed. Now I need to go watch Kill Bill again...\n\nI'm surprised no one has mentioned in here how he died. It's very, VERY bizarre. Apparently, a maid found him hanging in the closet with a nylon rope tied around his neck and another rope tied around his genitals...\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/06/05/carradine.death/index.html\n\nYou guys think it's foul play, suicide, accidental? It's kind of odd how there's no signs of forced entry in the room. I honestly don't think he's going to let someone come into his room and let them do that to him without some sort of struggle happening. I'm leaning on this being a sick suicide.\n\nRope around the genitals could have either a perverse sexual meaning or one of condemnation. If it is a suicide it may have been guilt at some sexual deviance (infidelity, closet LGBT tendencies). However, I would think that such a display would be more suitable to a scorned woman, though castration is more customary.\n\nI'm thinking more along the lines of auto-erotic asphyxiation. Yes, people actually do that, and they occasionally go so far as to accidentally suffocate themselves. Not a sure thing, but entirely possible.\n\nBut one doesn't asphyxiate their genitalia. The article is vague, as articles on this subject matter usually are. Media aren't allowed on a crime scene until it's been released and police don't always reveal all aspects of a crime to reporters. We don't have the whole story, but judging from what I can read in that article, I say it wasn't a suicide.\n\nAs a former military police officer, it sounds like an auto-erotic asphyxiation. I've been to a number of scenes where the subject has accidentally suffocated themselves. In some cases there have been items attached or wrapped around the genitals, very close to some items you might see at an erotica store. It's all just a theory, but if it is correct, perhaps he was improvising. There's probably quite a few celebrities with odd fetishes, but for discretion due to their status, they might have to improvise on occasion.\n\nHis hands were not tied behind his back, so I suspect it was either an accident like others here have said where it was an auto-erotic asphyxiation or a suicide. It's kind of odd how if it was an accident he wouldn't have stopped himself from suffocating since his hands were free.\n\nI liked the first Kill Bill, but he was hardly in it.\n\nI've never seen \"Kung Fu,\" but I do know that Carradine made a career off the backs of Asians. Hell, the lead role in \"Kung Fu\" should have rightfully gone to Bruce Lee. His last role as the idiotic Poon Tang in that Crank movie really made me lose any residual respect I might have had for him.\n\nStill, it's unfortunate he died. Wish he had made better career choices.\n\nEven tough it only lasted 20 seconds, the fight he had with Beatirx Kiddo was the best of all the fights in the Kill Bill movie.\n\nI remember the days when he had no hair, lol. The guy was an international martial arts icon, and he will be painfully missed.\n\nR.I.P. David Carradine"
