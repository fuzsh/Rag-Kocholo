        "text": "Harry here... One of the co-authors of my book that was released this year was the uber-movie fan Paul Cullum for the new magazine... FILTER. Just one of the best guys around and he's recently contributed an interview he did with David Carradine, while David was in training for Quentin Tarantino's KILL BILL.\n\nI'll never forget watching Quentin and David on stage at the Alamo Drafthouse during QT5 (fifth semi-annual Quentin Tarantino Film Festival) talking about the evolution of Kwai Chang Caine, when I turned my head to Patch and said... \"That's Bill.\" She began slapping my arm and insisted that I tell Quentin, and the next time I saw Quentin, I told him. He cocked his head, smiled, and said that he wrote the part for Warren Beatty though, and Warren was really up to do it. And that was that.\n\nWarren Beatty is cool, but there was just something magic about David Carradine that Quentin was touching on that stage that night, and it haunted me. When it was announced that Beatty was out and Carradine was in, there was a great deal of speculation as to how Tarantino could go from the A-list Warren Beatty to the cult actor David Carradine.\n\nCarradine told Cullum:\n\n\"Later, I came back from Spain, and I had 3 messages from Quentin on my answering machine. My agent and my manager both said that I was up for a part in this Warren Beatty movie called KILL BILL. So, I went and met Quentin for lunch and found out that it wasn't a Warren Beatty movie, it was a David Carradine movie. But apparently, he had actually been writing for me all the time, while he was making a deal with Warren. The way Quentin put it, there was not exactly a falling out between them, but the romance was going out of the idea. I mean, there's a lot of training involved, and it's a very, very physical part. But apparently, there was a moment when Quentin was saying, 'What I want you to do with this movie is you've got to be like David Carradine.' And Warren said, 'Well, why haven't you offered it to David?' And Quentin took the opportunity to say, 'Well, maybe that's what I should be doing.' I don't exactly know how the conversation went, because I wasn't there.\"\n\nSo for David, that's how it happened. Quentin it seems is also planning two animated feature films using characters from KILL BILL. Here's what David told Paul:"
