        "text": "The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday September 28 2003\n\nIn the article below, we said Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction 'remains the highest grossing independent film in American cinema history'. However, The Blair Witch Project took that spot in 1999, a position now occupied by My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\n\nThere's a moment towards the climax of Kill Bill, Quentin Tarantino's long-awaited fourth film, when O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu), a kung fu-style assassin, faces off against her deadly rival, The Bride (Uma Thurman), and taunts her with the words: 'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai.'\n\nThe line was greeted by a collective chuckle at a preview screening a few weeks ago. It seemed that Tarantino had cleverly pre-empted the question that many film critics will be asking about his foray into the martial arts action genre: is Kill Bill a film that stands up in its own right, or the moment when the master of cinematic homage crosses over into the realm of pure pastiche?\n\nPut simply, Kill Bill is an all-action martial arts movie with some nods to Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. Stylistically, it is breathtaking, not least in the fight scenes and in the central section where O-Ren Ishi's young life is portrayed in Japanese manga-style animation. But, for all its formal brilliance, it is the closest the magpie director has yet come to recreating, rather than reworking, the kind of films he immersed himself in as a teenager. (He has even cast David Carradine, who played Caine in the Seventies TV series Kung Fu.)\n\nThe unrepentant director has already, ominously, described Kill Bill as 'the movie of my geek-movie dreams', and as '30 years of grindhouse movie-going in a duck press'. For the uninitiated, this means all the tropes of both the old school martial arts movies of the Seventies, and the more violent Hong Kong and Taiwanese action movies of the Eighties and Nineties. In short, that means blood, gore, guts, and fights that are choreographed to the point of baroque.\n\nIt means samurai warriors who can balance on the blade of a sword despite the distraction of a thunderously intrusive soundtrack. It means a thin plot line that follows faithfully the honour-through-revenge motif central to the martial arts genre, and features Uma Thurman as an unlikely ninja, who awakens from a four-year coma, dons a nifty brown and yellow tracksuit, borrows a samurai sword, and sets out to dispatch the former friends who betrayed her.\n\nImagine Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon made by Scorsese during his cocaine phase, and you're halfway there. One scene culminates with 76 yakuza gangsters strewn in various stages of death around a blood-drenched Tokyo nightclub, many of them separated from their hands, feet or arms. In a moment that is pure vintage Tarantino in its exaggeration, their chorus of agonising groans continues throughout the whole of following scene.\n\n'When we were training for the fight scenes,' says Julie Dreyfus, who plays assassin Sofie Fatale, 'he would sit us down after lunch each day and show us scenes from films like Drunken Master, or some of Sonny Chiba's films. His enthusiasm and attention to detail are extraordinary. It was like a crash course in his movie obsessions.'\n\nWhich, in a way, is exactly what the finished film is. 'I'm making this movie for me,' he announced early on, with that typical mix of arrogance and enthusiasm. 'Everyone else is along for the ride.' The 'everyone else', for the record, includes his muse, Thurman, erstwhile Charlie's Angel, Lucy Liu, his favourite tough guy, Michael Madsen, his latest chosen candidate for career resurrection, Daryl Hannah, and, last but not least, the film's financiers, Miramax.\n\nHaving watched the troubled film's budget rise from $39 million to $55m, and the initial 12-week shoot stretch to eight months, Miramax made the almost unprecedented decision to release the three-hour film in two parts rather than cut it by 30 minutes - Kill Bill Vol.2 follows in six months. That means twice the promotional costs. It is rumoured, too, that lawyers are demanding that the actors, who were contracted to make one film, should now be paid for two.\n\nFor all that, Miramax's bullish head, Harvey Weinstein, recently described it as 'just a fun B-movie'. His uncharacteristically understated summation suggests that Miramax are as conscious as anyone, bar the director himself, of the weight of expectation Kill Bill carries.\n\n'Tarantino is in a uniquely difficult situation,' elaborates the film historian and critic Mark Cousins, 'because all the things that made him new and fresh when he burst on the scene a decade ago have become over-familiar and hackneyed through their over-use by other, often lesser, directors. It reached a kind of tipping point a few years back where every movie seemed to have a scene where the characters argued over pop cultural trivia. More worryingly in the long run is the sense that, like Scorsese before him, the second stage of his career might be characterised by that long, sad search for a subject.'\n\nIf that is indeed the case, Kill Bill might just be the pivotal moment when Tarantino exorcises, once and for all, the various absorbed generic influences - noir, blaxploitation, kung fu - that, to varying degrees, have defined all his films. Or, it could mark a long retreat into the kind of over-the-top stylistic conformity that will appeal only to his most adolescent-minded fans, of which there are many. Curiously, the most radical aspect of Kill Bill is also the most baffling: Tarantino's decision to pare the dialogue to a bare minimum which, though faithful to the genre's unspoken ground rules, is akin to Ronaldo deciding to stop scoring goals in order to concentrate fully on his passing.\n\n'As a fan, I wanted him to play to, and expand on, his strengths, I wanted more talk, and more comedy,' says film writer David Thomson, echoing what many fans think. 'He's a natural filmmaker in terms of his ear for everyday speech. So to dispense with that is perverse to say the least. As Quentin gets older, I thought he would have a willingness to take on subjects other than cinematic forms. He seems, though, to have gone in the opposite direction, and totally immersed himself in a cinematic form, which is not, I have to say, a good sign.'\n\nEleven years ago, when his first film, the low-budget, resolutely brutal Reservoir Dogs, was released, Tarantino's merging of ultra-violent action and ultra-hip dialogue, both of which seemed loaded with references to other films, was groundbreaking. It signalled the arrival of a new kind of emphatically American auteur, whose geekish fixation with the minutiae of popular culture was offset by an equally in-depth knowledge of both European and Eastern cinema. That fast-paced, violent, but intricately structured, debut, alone of all his films, also had a subtext that was provocative and mature, if extreme in its depiction.\n\n'It tackled the theme of masculinity head on,' says Cousins. 'Both in its form and content, it was a film about the absurdity of extreme masculinity. It is a film that can shock you and make you cry, that is both brutal and tender. I think it remains his masterpiece, not least because nothing he has done since has had that kind of depth.'\n\nBy the time Pulp Fiction premiered two years later, that raw and intricate approach had been airbrushed into an at times breathtaking, but ultimately hollow, bravura style. Hyped to the max on release, not least by the director himself, Pulp Fiction remains the highest grossing independent film in American cinema history. Pulling together four separate narratives, it showed off to the full his ability to blend genres as well as his unmatched ear for dialogue and the rhythms of everyday speech. His hired killers, Jules and Vincent, argue about hamburger brands and foot massages, as they go about their grisly trade. Comedy and violence, absurdity and high drama, all merge seamlessly in a film that took the often-stretched stylistic exaggeration of his debut close to breaking point. The King of Geek had jettisoned his complex thematic subtext and, in the process, successfully gatecrashed the mainstream consciousness, trailing the adjective Tarantinoesque in his wake.\n\n'Ultimately, what I'm trying to do,' he told me back then, 'is merge sophisticated storytelling with lurid subject matter. I reckon that makes for an entertaining night at the movies.'\n\nBy the time Jackie Brown arrived in 1997, though, the lurid colours had been mysteriously toned down, along with the pace. His rather stately, some would say plodding, take on Elmore Leonard's crime novel was, apart from the casting of Seventies blaxploitation queen Pam Grier, an almost reverential ode to an altogether more old-fashioned kind of Hollywood crime thriller.\n\nThe sexual frisson of Pulp Fiction was replaced by a surprising romantic subplot, featuring a heroine played by a black woman on the wrong side of middle age, and a private eye, played by Robert Forster, a greying B-movie actor. By now, Tarantino was as famous for resurrecting grounded careers as for his visceral set pieces. The controversy that had attended all his films, usually connected to his glamorisation of graphic violence and general amoral tone, flared again when fellow director Spike Lee publicly objected to the liberal use of the word 'nigger' in Jackie Brown. (Lee had an intern track the 38 times it occurred.)\n\nRevealingly, Jackie Brown was the first film Tarantino had made without his co-writer Roger Avary, with whom he had fallen out following a row over the credits for Pulp Fiction. Celebrity had brought power, and the insistence on complete creative control that has derailed many great directors, Scorsese included, in this, the most collaborative of professions. In the six years since Jackie Brown, the director's name has been linked only with online conjecture and Hollywood rumour: Tarantino was washed up; Tarantino had writer's block; Tarantino, who turned 40 in March this year, was deeply depressed following the break-up of his relationship with the actress Mira Sorvino.\n\nAt least some of the above seems to be true. He was arrested twice for brawling outside restaurants. He indulged his acting obsession with the lead in an off-Broadway production of an old thriller, Wait Until Dark, which earned him some vituperatively cruel reviews. 'He was far better than I was led to expect,' wrote the New York Post's theatre critic. 'He was merely terrible.'\n\nIn this month's Vanity Fair, friends talk about his post-Jackie Brown withdrawal, of his lost months spent indoors watching late-night TV. Tarantino talks openly, too, about the problems he had with his sudden celebrity, and the constantly intrusive attention of his devoted fans. 'It was getting hard just to take walks. I had to avoid eye contact... All of a sudden I'm getting jacked and pimped by all these people.' On cinema screens, too, art was imitating life, as every Tom, Dick and Guy made sub-Tarantino films wherein gangsters discussed pop culture.\n\n'What I've heard on the Hollywood grapevine,' says David Thomson, 'is that there was some doubt about whether he was ever going to make another film. I think that his life got into a lot of trouble for all the usual reasons to do with sudden fame, and the brutal nature of Hollywood. Don't forget, until Reservoir Dogs, he had lived a very sheltered life, even a somewhat sad life, where movies were his escape and his life raft.'\n\nThrough Tarantino's obsession with film is usually traced to his years spent working in the Video Archives store in Manhattan Beach, his childhood was where he first lost himself in film. Born to 16-year-old Connie McHugh, and itinerant actor Tony Tarantino in Knoxville, Tennessee, he was brought up by his mother in suburban Los Angeles, in 'a wharf community near the airport'. They moved constantly, and Tarantino once described himself as 'the dumb kid who couldn't keep up with the class'. Often, he simply didn't attend school, hiding in the house until his mother, a nurse, left for work, then spending the day in front of the television or perusing his comic collection.\n\nHe was not just the classic alienated teenager, but a lonely child with a keen sense of his own otherness. When I interviewed him around the release of Pulp Fiction, his childhood was the only topic that stanched his extraordinary flow of words. His mother, he said, allowed him to go to whatever film was playing locally, and he remembered watching emphatically adult films such as Mike Nichols's Carnal Knowledge and 'just about every Peckinpah'.\n\nHe took acting classes at 16, while working in various Pussycat porno cinemas, and appeared as an Elvis impersonator in an episode of the Golden Girls sitcom. Meanwhile, he was writing scripts - all of which he claimed still to have when I interviewed him. He sold the screenplays for both True Romance and Natural Born Killers before he made Reservoir Dogs, which he managed to show to various directors, including Terry Gilliam. As a result, the script soon gained word-of-mouth cred, which led to the casting of Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth. It was made by Live Entertainment, a small video company, and bought by Miramax. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nA decade later, it would seem, for the time being at least, that the fame he wanted so desperately as a teenager has derailed the arrogant, but supremely talented, enthusiast who made that first raw and visceral low-budget film. 'If I had to make the trade - fame for anonymity - yeah, I would,' he told Vanity Fair, describing how he can no longer trawl the racks of second-hand record shops without fans pestering him. This disaffection with celebrity has unsurprisingly had an impact on his film-making.\n\n'There was about him something of the glorious excitement that attended Godard in the early Sixties,' says David Thomson, 'but, interestingly, Godard soon fell out of love with the violent Hollywood he had been describing. Perhaps Tarantino has realised that it is not simply enough just to love the old classic movies, that, to be an artist, you have to make the modern new again and again.'\n\nWhat is odd and revealing about Kill Bill is not just that Tarantino has all but dispensed with one of his key signatures - snappy, street-wise, often chillingly funny dialogue - but that he has also chosen to move outside America, both literally in the filming of Kill Bill, and in terms of the subject matter. He has, in short, retreated from the the one big subject he must one day undertake in order to place him among the greats of American cinema.\n\n'Right now, the question has to be asked, does American film have even a remote bearing on the amazing and troubling realities of American life?' says Thomson. 'Is there someone out there who could make an ambitious and extraordinary film about the end of the American empire? I think that someone is either Paul Thomas Anderson or Quentin Tarantino. Thomas Anderson hinted at that epic scope with Magnolia, but so far Tarantino has only been epic in style. He certainly has that [Howard] Hawksian ability to tie narratives together, no question. I really think he could make the big film we all want him to, but, in order to do that, he would have to apply his sensibility and his extraordinary narrative command to truly serious social subject matter.'\n\nThus far, though, as Kill Bill amply illustrates, Tarantino has gone in the opposite direction - further away from real life into the realm of pure filmic reference. The problems that Kill Bill highlights are not new in Tarantino's still small ouevre, but they are writ large. Only time will tell if this is a momentary loss of confidence, or the beginning of another long American directorial decline.\n\n'Film doesn't mean what it once did,' says David Thomson wistfully, 'but for a while there, with Tarantino, it did.' It would be a shame if that moment has passed for ever.\n\nÂ· Kill Bill opens on 10 October\n\nWhat he says... and what they say\n\nTarantino on Tarantino\n\n'Some kids it's sports, some kids it's studies, some kids it's cars, some kids it's drawing... with me it was movies.'\n\n'To me, violence is a totally aesthetic subject. Saying you don't like violence in movies is like saying you don't like dance scenes... Violence in real life is terrible; violence in the movies can be cool. It's just another colour to work with.'\n\n'Action directors are the real film directors! This film [Kill Bill] is difficult; I mean anybody can shoot a scene with two people sitting around a table talking to each other. And I know I can always go back to that, but this is something totally different!'\n\n'Why should I be scared? You do the work and that's what is important. It sounds big, but I've built my whole career on courage. This whole thing is about when I'm an old man and I'm not doing anything any more. It ain't about the moment. I'm not making films for right now - I'm making films for 40 years from now.\n\n'I love that scene. I love what it does cinematically, emotionally, performance-wise. To me it's the most cinematic scene in the whole movie.'\n\nOn the ear-cutting scene in Reservoir Dogs\n\n'I guess I'll have to marry Elvis Presley to get even.'\n\nAfter director Guy Ritchie married Madonna\n\nHollywood - and his mum - on Tarantino\n\n'I'm not against the word, and I use it, but not excessively. And some people speak that way. But Quentin is infatuated with that word. What does he want to be made - an honorary black man?'\n\nSpike Lee on the use of the word 'nigger' in Jackie Brown\n\n'Black artists think they are the only ones allowed to use the word. Well, that's bull. This film is a wonderful homage to black exploitation films [of the Seventies]. This is a good film. And Spike hasn't made one of those in a few years.'\n\nSamuel L. Jackson responding to Spike Lee\n\n'Spurious, sadistic manipulation... pure gratuity, without mercy for the viewer.'\n\nElla Taylor's review of Reservoir Dogs in the LA Weekly\n\n'I wanted a name that would fill up the entire screen - a multi-syllable name: Quen-tin Ta-ran-ti-no.'\n\nTarantino's mother"
