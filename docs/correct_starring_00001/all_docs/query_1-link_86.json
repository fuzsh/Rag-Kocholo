        "text": "Pam Grier apparently kisses and tells. She starred in 2001’s horror/action film Bones, and in discussing the film, she reflected that Snoop Dogg was a good kisser. The story follows Jimmy Bones (Snoop Dogg), who rises from the dead to seek revenge against those who murdered him, and the aftermath of his death from the perspective of his lover, Pearl (Grier), two decades later.\n\nSnoop Dogg was a Good Kisser\n\nThe Foxy Brown star revealed during a recent appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show on Thursday (May 30) that the Snoop “could kiss.” Grier, 75, said, “Oh my God, and he can smooch!” She then gave Hudson a knowing look and smirk, adding, “Let me tell ya, let me tell ya.”\n\nSnoop Dogg Fainted When He Met Grier\n\nGrier’s high praises of Snoop were mutual when the rapper and actor appeared on Hudson’s talk show a few months earlier in January. During the January 26 episode, Snoop said he fainted the first time he met Grier because he was absolutely star-struck.\n\nSince he was “young Snoop” at the time, when he found out he snagged the role opposite the Jackie Brown actress, he didn’t know what to do when she walked right up, sat next him, and started talking. “My heart beat fast, yeah. My heart beat fast! So I’m like, ‘Okay, I hear what you’re saying, Pam, give me a minute,’” Snoop Dogg recalled.\n\nHilariously, after excusing himself to the bathroom, he fainted and fell to the bathroom floor. “My security comes in there like, ‘Get off this nasty floor, man, what is you doing?’ I looked up, and I said, ‘Cuh, I just met Pam Grier.’”\n\nHis experience with her was one that he would forever hold dear to him. Snoop said Pam was a mentor of sorts, giving him all the information he needed to be a better actor, person, and how to handle interacting with people “you are infatuated with.”\n\nDuring Thursday’s episode, Hudson discussed what happened to Snoop on their first meeting, and Grier was glad he didn’t hurt himself. She added, “I can see it now,” of the longtime friends who have “always” supported each other’s artistic endeavors.\n\nElsewhere in her interview, Grier confirms to Hudson that there will be a Foxy Brown sequel in the form of a musical series. Because “it can’t be a 7-hour movie,” Grier says it has been turned into a limited series of seven episodes shot like a film.\n\nWatch her interview on The Jennifer Hudson Show below:\n\nGrier’s latest project is in Amazon Prime Video’s Them season 2, which is now streaming.\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
