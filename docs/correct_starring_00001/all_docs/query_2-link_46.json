        "meta_description": "Hungarian postcard by Est Media, Budapest. <b>David Carradine</b> as Bill in <i>Kill Bill, Vol. 2</i> (Quentin Tarantino, 2004). Caption: Aprilis 29 - Töl a Mozikban. (In the cinema from 29 April).\n\t\n\tIn <b>Kill Bill, Vol 2</b> (Quentin Tarantino, 2004), the Bride (Uma Thurman) continues her quest for vengeance against her former boss and lover Bill (<b>David Carradine</b>). Having dispatched several of her arch-enemies in the first film, she now pursuits the reclusive bouncer and Bill's younger beer-swilling brother Budd (Michael Madsen), and the treacherous, one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). Bill, Bud, and Elle are the only survivors from the squad of assassins who attempted to murder her and her unborn child on her wedding day in a furious assault. It's all leading up to the ultimate confrontation with Bill, the Bride's former master, and the man who ordered her execution! Like Volume 1, Volume 2 received positive reviews and was a box-office hit.\n\t\n\tKill Bill Vol. 2 stands on its own, although Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 were planned and produced as a single film. After editing began, producer Harvey Weinstein, who was known for pressuring filmmakers to shorten their films, suggested that Tarantino split the film in two. The decision was announced in July 2003. Vol. 2 is not a sequel but a continuation and completion.  It is a distillation of the countless grindhouse Kung-fu movies Tarantino has absorbed and transcends. Perry Seibert at AllMovie: &quot;Where Volume 1 offered the most visually freewheeling Tarantino work ever, Volume 2 showcases how deliberate his intentions are. Take the training sequence with Pai Mei: This looks like every kung fu movie that ever played on a Saturday afternoon on your local UHF station. The cheesy zooms, the arch dialogue, and the faux-mystical bearded mentor are all intricately planned and in place. These elements are not kitsch; Tarantino genuinely loves these genre tropes and wants nothing more than to share that love with the audience while never taking his eye off the story. This is exactly what he accomplishes in Kill Bill, and he does it with confidence.&quot; \n\t\n\tVol. 2 opens with a long closeup of The Bride behind the wheel of a car, explaining her mission, which is to kill Bill. Flashbacks remind us that the pregnant Bride and her entire wedding party were targeted by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad in a massacre at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel. Bill was responsible. Roger Ebert at RogerEbert.com: &quot;He's played by David Carradine in a performance that somehow, improbably, suggests that Bill and the Bride had a real relationship despite the preposterous details surrounding it. (Bill is deeply offended that she plans to marry a used record store owner and lead a normal life.)&quot; The Bride survived the massacre and awakened after a long coma, and in the first film set to avenge herself against the Deadly Vipers and Bill. In &quot;Volume 2,&quot; The Bride meets the warrior master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu), who lives on the top of a high, lonely hill reached by climbing many stairs. He was Bill's master, and in a flashback, Bill delivers his protege for training. Pai Mei is a harsh and uncompromising teacher, and the Bride sheds blood during their unrelenting sessions. The training with Pai Mei prepared The Bride to begin her career with Bill. In the action that takes place &quot;now,&quot; The Bride has to fight her way past formidable opponents, including Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), the one-eyed master of martial arts, and Budd (Michael Madsen), who works as a bouncer in a strip joint and lives in a mobile home surrounded by desolation. \n\t\n\tNeither one is a pushover for The Bride. The showdown with Budd involves a sequence where it seems The Bride must surely die after being buried alive. The fight with Elle Driver is a virtuoso celebration of fight choreography. Their battle takes place inside Budd's trailer home, which is pretty much demolished in the process. Roger Ebert: &quot; Tarantino, who began the film in black and white before switching to color, plays with formats here, too; to suggest the claustrophobia of being buried, he shows The Bride inside her wooden casket, and as clods of earth rain down on the lid, he switches from widescreen to the classic 4x3 screen ratio.&quot; As with Tarantino's previous films, Kill Bill features an eclectic soundtrack comprising many musical genres. On the two soundtracks, the music ranges from country music to selections from the Spaghetti Western film scores of Ennio Morricone. Bernard Herrmann's theme from the film Twisted Nerve is whistled by the menacing Elle Driver in the hospital scene. A brief, 15-second excerpt from the opening of the Ironside theme music by Quincy Jones is used as the Bride's revenge motif, which flares up with a red-tinged flashback whenever she is in the company of her next target. \n\t\n\tRoger Ebert: &quot;One of the achievements of &quot;Volume 2&quot; is that the story is filled in, the characters are developed, and they do begin to resonate, especially during the extraordinary final meeting between The Bride and Bill -- which consists not of nonstop action but of more hypnotic dialogue and ends in an event that is like a quiet, deadly punch line. Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it. I confess I feared that &quot;Volume 2&quot; would be like those sequels that lack the intensity of the original. But this is all one film, and now that we see it whole, it's greater than its two parts; Tarantino remains the most brilliantly oddball filmmaker of his generation, and this is one of the best films of the year.&quot; Kill Bill Vol. 2 grossed $25.1 million on its opening weekend, which was higher than Vol. 1's, and the equivalent success confirmed the studio's financial decision to split the film into two theatrical releases. Vol. 2 grossed a total of $66.2 million in the United States and Canada and $86 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $152.2 million. In June 2021, Quentin Tarantino stated that a potential Kill Bill Vol. 3 would take place 20 years following the original volumes and that he was excited about the possibility of Uma Thurman and her daughter Maya Hawke playing the Bride and her daughter B.B. respectively. \n\t\n\tSources: Roger Ebert (RoigerEbert.com), Perry Seibert (AllMovie),  Wikipedia, and IMDb.\n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
