        "text": "Actor David Carradine, star of the 1970s TV show Kung Fu, has been found dead in his luxury hotel room in Bangkok.\n\nPolice said Carradine was found hanged and there were no signs of other people in the room.\n\nThe body of the 72-year-old actor has been sent to a hospital for an autopsy.\n\nLori Binder, a representative for Carradine's Los Angeles-based talent manager, said the actor was in Thailand to shoot a film called Stretch.\n\nShe declined to give further details of his death while it was under investigation.\n\nCarradine - from a family of performers and the eldest son of character actor John Carradine - enjoyed a long career on Broadway, television and in movies such as director Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: Volume 1 and Kill Bill: Volume 2.\n\nRIP Grasshopper\n\nCondolences are pouring in to the actor's website.\n\n\"What a sad day it is for all who grew up watching David Carradine and knowing this great actor. May you rest in eternal peace,\" said one post.\n\nAnother simply said \"RIP Grasshopper\" - the nickname of his Kung Fu character Kwai Chang Caine, a wandering monk in America's Old West who became an iconic figure of US TV in the 1970s.\n\nVaried career\n\nThe actor was born John Arthur Carradine on December 8, 1936 in Los Angeles and was educated at San Francisco State University, where he studied music theory and composition.\n\nWhile writing music for the drama department's annual revues, he discovered his own passion for the stage, joining a Shakespearean repertory company.\n\nAfter working on Broadway in The Deputy and The Royal Hunt Of The Sun opposite Christopher Plummer, Carradine earned a spot on Hollywood's map in the 1960s in TV westerns such as Wagon Train and The Virginian, as well as his starring role in a TV version of the hit western movie Shane.\n\nBut it was his role in Kung Fu that earned Carradine his greatest fame. The series aired on US television starting in 1972 and immediately won a large fan base for Carradine as Caine.\n\nThe show spawned a movie and numerous other offshoots.\n\nOverall, Carradine's credits include more than 200 roles in movies and television spanning nearly five decades.\n\nHis role as Caine earned him a nomination for an Emmy, US TV's highest honour, and his turn as the villainous Bill in Kill Bill: Volume 2 led to his fourth Golden Globe nomination.\n\nHe also won critical acclaim for portraying folk singer Woody Guthrie in the Oscar-nominated 1976 film Bound For Glory.\n\nCarradine was married five times and had two daughters from previous marriages.\n\nHis latest wife was Annie Bierman, whom he married in 2004.\n\nIn his 1995 autobiography Endless Highway, Carradine wrote that he tried to kill himself when he was five years old.\n\nThe book also described his extensive drug use, ranging from LSD to cocaine, and ended with a chronicle of his efforts in the mid-1990s to get sober by attending a support group for alcoholics."
