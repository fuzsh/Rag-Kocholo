        "text": "I was named after my great-grandfather's town, the twon he first settled in when he came to California from China: Rainsford, California. Rainsford Chan (Chan is short for California). Rainsford doesn't exist anymore. There's no record of it ever having existed, but I've heard stories about it. I've spent many days hiking and skiing through the Sierra Nevada looking for it. I've never found exactly where it was, but I'm almost sure I've seen it or passed by in on one of those days. I recognized it from a hill. It was one of those long, wide Sierra meadows. A place of shade. The sound of a stream reaches my ears. Dogwood trees make the place sound like a river when the breeze moves through the leaves.\n\n\"You know, people say I look Chinese,\" he said.\n\n[ omitted ]\n\nI looked at him in the dim light. He did look Chinese.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" I asked.\n\n\"Acoma.\"\n\nLots of Chinese in New Mexico?\"\n\nHe started laughing and lit up another cigarette. \"Where are you from?\"\n\n\"Berkeley.\"\n\n\"Where are you from originally?\"\n\n\"Berkeley.\"\n\n\"How long you been here?\"\n\n\"Three days.\"\n\n\"No. How long you been in the United States?\"\n\n\"All my life.\"\n\n\"You mean you ain't born in China?\"\n\n\"What do you you mean? Don't I look like I come from Gallup?\"\n\n\"You ain't Navajo. You Chinese. You like me.\"\n\n\"You ain't Chinese, though.\"\n\n\"My ancestors came from China thirty thousand years ago and settled in Acoma Pueblo.\"\n\n\"Is that why you look Chinese?\"\n\n\"Naw, my grandfather was Chinese.\"\n\n\"Your grandfather was Chinese?\"\n\nI turned to look at the old man and tore our newspaper.\n\n\"He wandered into New Mexico and married a widow before anyone knew he was Chinese.\" He crushed his cigarette on the floor and smiled to himself. I was looking at his face more closely. he started chcukling then turned to me. \"You pretty lucky\" -- he pointed into the room I was sleeping in -- \"to sleep in isolation with two women.\"\n\n\"Oh, they're just friends from school.\"\n\nThat one, Sandy, the Nez Perc√©, looks Japanese.\"\n\nYeah, me and your grandfather . . .\"\n\n\"What does she call you?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Rainsford.\"\n\n\"Rainsford?\"\n\n\"That's my name. Rainsford.\"\n\n\"Sounds like the name of a town.\"\n\n\"It was. My great-grandfather lived there.\""
