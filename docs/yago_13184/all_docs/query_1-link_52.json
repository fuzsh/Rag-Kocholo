I read a little better. Is this close? No?\"\n\nI want to learn to speak Spanish for, y'know, work and stuff, so I want to focus on how it's spoken in the United States, not necessarily in Spain or even in Latin America. I mean, I know it's all kind of connected, but that's my focus.\n\nI'm actually at about a juvenile reading level, mostly because I've paid a lot of attention to English etymology. I can read El leon, la bruja, y el ropero but not Cien años de soledad. I was actually pretty happy to stumble upon the online RAE dictionary (http://www.rae.es/rae.html), which has etymological... y'know... yeah. I have no experience whatsoever speaking or writing Spanish, so that's why I'm here. I'm sure my pronunciation isn't great, but I figure once I can come up with the words in Spanish by writing them instead of just being able to recognize them when I see them, that'll come along. I expect to try to cobble stuff together badly using the dictionary and conjugation tables and stuff until then.\n\nSo anyway, that's me.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and I forgot the little upside-down question marks in my first post! Thanks for not banning me! :P\n\nookami\n\nI think that we can correct the text to be OK without changing it so much, because he is new learning how to write/speak in Spanish and we don't need to show him the most natural way right now, he would not know where to start correcting.\n\nSoy Dan. Soy estadounidenesesian. O algo. Primero vez genero texto no con traduzco automatico. Leyendo un poco mejor. De próximo? No?\n\nSoy Dan. Soy estadounidense, o algo así. Esta es la primera vez que genero un texto [en español] sin traducción automática. Estoy leyendo un poco mejor. ¿Lo que sigue? / ¿Lo próximo?"
