        "text": "The Book Club is reading “Freedom” in October and November.\n\n“Freedom” is such a whale that it’s been tough to figure out where to join the conversation. The novel's narrative concerns—its big ideas about Bush-era America, its deep and fierce character development—are essential to any discussion, but somehow I haven’t felt up to thinking much about mountaintop-removal mining, crooked defense contracts, finance jobs, simmering hatred in the suburbs… (Of all critics, Sam Tanenhaus devotes the most analysis to the book's themes in his glowing review.) There’s a risk in writing such a sweeping, inclusive narrative about the very recent past; for all its trenchant observation, the subject may be too recent, too familiar, and still too nauseating.\n\nFrozen by the novel’s narrative elements, I’ll take a side door and discuss form, namely what Jon discussed last Monday when he wrote about Jonathan Franzen’s decision to devote a large section of the novel to the supposed autobiography of Patty Berglund, one half of the novel’s central couple. This autobiography is both a literary device and a real object; later in the novel, Patty shares the text with her lover Richard, and it’s later read by her husband, leading to their separation. In this case, form is not incidental—the autobiographical section presents a central dilemma in terms of one’s appreciation of the book. Are we convinced by this very novelistic gambit, and so find our reading enriched by a direct connection to Patty through her own words? Or do we reject the autobiography as a false document, thus denying the plausibility of the novel itself?\n\nFor me, it’s the latter—the autobiography is unconvincing in terms of style and therefore unconvincing as an object in the narrative. First, there’s the document’s title: “Mistakes Were Made: Autobiography of Patty Berglund by Patty Berglund (Composed at Her Therapist’s Suggestion).” “Mistakes Were Made” is the kind of coded, Rumsfeldian double-talk that was immediately famous during the aughts—it covered up gaffes, ignorance, and gross incompetence, all while shifting blame to some vague parallel universe. It might have made a good title for the novel itself (written by Franzen) but as the title of Patty’s text, it is absurd, since it too clearly reveals the hand of the clever writer (again, Franzen) who throughout the larger novel gives us examples in both public and private life of this kind of dereliction of intellectual responsibility. This is what the novel is partly about—whom we blame and for what and how we dodge that blame. But Patty, as a character within that novel, doesn’t know this. She wouldn’t have used this title, none of Franzen’s characters would. Only Franzen would.\n\nFranzen’s intervention begins with the title, but extends throughout the autobiography’s text. Jon offers examples of how Franzen mixes his authorial voice with Patty’s own syntax and diction, forming a hybrid third-person narration. We can see that, to offer another example, here:\n\nBeing able to see the basket better and to post up in traffic and to rotate more freely on defense might have rendered her competitive streak somewhat less vicious, leading to a happier life post-college; probably not, but it was interesting to think about.\n\nThe voice seems credible at first; to “post up in traffic” is the kind of casual shop-talk that a former player might use. But on the first page of an amateur autobiography, could we expect the writer, in a single sentence, to so neatly frame the entire crisis of her character? It’s the same issue of scope as we see with the title—Franzen, the master architect, can paint in these broad strokes, but his characters shouldn’t. The narcissistic among us may live as characters in the novels and movies of our lives—Franzen may even be arguing that all modern people conceive of their lives as narrative arcs—but Patty never shows such ability outside of her autobiography. She also never seems to be writing; and when did she sneak out to Kinko’s to print up what the non-Patty narrator describes later in the novel as a “thick, unbound manuscript”?\n\nJon writes of the autobiography that “it’s clear the author is Franzen and that the whole book is written in his take on the free-indirect style.” I agree. You can especially see Franzen’s free-indirect style in the other sections, narrated by an unnamed third person—the first twenty-six pages of the novel especially contain a mixture of Franzen’s language and suburban Americanese: “She was already fully the thing that was just starting to happen to the rest of the street.” “Fully the thing” is non-descriptive and offhand, but the cadence of the sentence, and the commentary it offers, is writerly, Franzen-like. It’s this language that B. R. Myers finds so repulsive in his exceedingly contentious review of the novel for the Atlantic. I’m not sure that’s fair; in the non-autobiography sections, Franzen’s hybrid narration gives incredible insight into his characters, and creates an almost claustrophobic world of meaningless language that is surely one of the central themes of this book. Yet, in terms of the autobiography, it just makes no sense to use the free-indirect style; it creates irresolvable confusion since the voice remains undifferentiated from the rest of the narration, leading to what Myers complains about when he writes that Franzen “…hints at no frame of reference from which we are to judge his prose critically.”\n\nOf course Franzen wrote the autobiography—just as he wrote each word of the novel—and placed it in the narrative in a considered way; so why shouldn’t he tinker with the text, inflecting it with his own ideas and language? But for a realist novel to succeed, certain central conceits must remain intact. If the writer tells us that a text is the autobiography written by a character, and that that text figures as agent of action within the story itself, then we must believe it to be a real thing. And a real thing would be written in a consistent and believable voice, Patty’s voice. Otherwise, the delicate gravity of a novel’s solar system gets thrown too far out of whack, and its planets start to spin out of orbit."
