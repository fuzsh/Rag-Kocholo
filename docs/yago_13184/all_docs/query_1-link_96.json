This essay seeks to answer these questions by focusing on the writings of Arvind Krishna Mehrotra. In doing so, it suggests that the challenges of cultural distance may be most acute when dealing with texts from homo-linguistic literary environments, and that we might overcome these challenges by undertaking a world literary criticism that attends to localized [â¦]",

        "text": "What are the conditions of contemporary literary experience? What are its limits? In posing these questions, I have in mind the account that Derek Attridge gives of readings in which texts become works.11This account is elaborated over several books, but I rely especially on Derek Attridge, The Work of Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015). I have in mind also the particular challenges posed by an expanded literary totality which is roughly equivalent with âworld literatureâ as the term is used today. It is the task of this essay to explore these questions by tracking my own responses to the writings of a single author, Arvind Krishna Mehrotra; and of its introductory section to expand on what I have in mind when asking them.22In our Introduction to The Cambridge Companion to World Literature (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), Ben Etherington and I explore âworld literatureâ as only one of many conceptions of literary totality, and pose questions about its value though a reading of Mehrotraâs verse. The project of a world literary criticism is fundamentally indebted to this collaboration, and to its previous and subsequent articulations, especially in Ben Etherington and Jarad Zimbler, âField, Material, Technique: On Renewing Postcolonial Literary Criticismâ, Journal of Commonwealth Literature, 49.3 (2014), pp. 279â98, and Ben Etherington, âWorld Literature as a Speculative Literary Totality: Veselovsky, Auerbach, Said, and the Critical Humanist Traditionâ, Modern Language Quarterly, 82.2 (2021)."
