He began his career as a production and character designer for Walt Disney Animation Studios before moving to Hanna-Barbera Productions, where he designed a great majority of the characters, including Scooby-Doo and Astro, and eventually became a director and producer.\n\nThe Cats of Mirikitani by Linda Hattendorf\n\nCall Number: V-D H288 Cat DVD\n\nEighty-year-old Jimmy Mirikitani survived the trauma of WWII internment camps, Hiroshima, and homelessness by creating art. But when 9/11 threatens his life on the New York City streets and a local filmmaker brings him to her home, the two embark on a journey to confront Jimmy's painful past. An intimate exploration of the lingering wounds of war and the healing powers of community and art.\n\nForever, Chinatown by James Q. Chan\n\nCall Number: Streaming on Kanopy\n\nA documentary about unknown, self-taught 81-year-old artist Frank Wong who has spent the past four decades recreating his fading memories by building romantic, extraordinarily detailed miniature models of the San Francisco Chinatown rooms of his youth.

Beating out some of the most prestigious architecture films from around the world, Lin's plan was selected from over 1,000 different designs, a giant victory for such a young and unknown artist.\n\nNice Chinese Girls Don't by Jennifer Abod\n\nCall Number: Streaming on Kanopy\n\nKitty Tsui recounts her emergence as a poet, artist, activist, writer, and bodybuilder in the early days of the Women's Liberation Movement in San Francisco. She narrates her experience of arriving to the States as an immigrant from Hong Kong by way of her own original poetry and stories. Tsui wrote the groundbreaking Words of a Woman Who Breathes Fire, the first book written by an Asian American lesbian.
