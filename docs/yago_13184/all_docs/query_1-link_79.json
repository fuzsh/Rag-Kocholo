        "text": "The United States passed its first citizenship law in 1790 during George Washington's first term. The Naturalization Rule required a person to live in the United States for 2 years before becoming a citizen. In 1875 the U.S. passed its first Exclusionary Act, known as the Page Act. This law made it illegal for convicts, prostitutes & Chinese contract workers from entering the country.\n\nIn 1882 the United States passed two major significant pieces of Immigration Legislation. The Immigration Act of 1882 did two things. First it created a tax of fifty cents that each immigrant must pay when entering the U.S.. This money would be used to pay for the costs of regulating immigration. The Act also created a system to inspect the ships carrying immigrants to America. Any ex-convicts, lunatics, idiots, and people who are unable to take care of themselves would not be allowed to enter the U.S.. The other significant piece of legislation in 1882 was the Chinese Exclusion Act. It banned all Chinese laborers from entering the U.S. (Immigration Case Study #1).\n\nIn 1885 the Alien Contract Labor Law made it illegal for Contract workers to enter America (a contract worker is someone who is hired by a company, and they work for the company until they have paid off the cost the company spent bringing them to America).\n\nThe Immigration Act 1891 made modifications to the Immigration Act of 1882. It created the Office of Immigration, which would be in control of regulating and enforcing immigration laws. In addition the Act made it illegal for paupers, polygamists, the insane, and persons with contagious diseases to enter the U.S.\n\nIn 1895, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge introduces a bill to the U.S. Senate requiring literacy test for immigrants. Immigrants would have to read five lines from the Constitution to be able to get into the United States . In 1896 Congress passed the bill, but in 1897 President Grover Cleveland vetoes the bill.\n\nIn 1903 and 1907 Groups such as Epileptics, professional beggars, and anarchists, imbeciles, the feeble-minded, people with tuberculosis, persons with physical or mental defects, and persons under 16 without parents are also excluded.\n\nIn 1907 a Literacy test is created for people who want to become American Citizens, but it is not a restriction on who can enter.\n\nIn January of 1915 Congress passes H.R.6060, but President Woodrow Wilson vetoes the bill. (Wilson's message explaining why is in the 2nd Section of documents.)\n\nFollowing Wilson's veto, Congress is given a second chance to vote on the bill. If they support it by a 2/3rd's majority, they can override the veto and the bill will become a Law.\n\nThe reason we should restrict immigration is that the number of unskilled workers coming in is preventing many Americans from improving their lives.\n\nThe illiteracy test is a good idea. It is true that it does not reach the criminal, but it is not meant for that. It might exclude the good laborers, but it will exclude the laborers from southern Italy and Austria-Hungary who experts think should be excluded. It will exclude the single man who comes here only temporarily, and does not care about the country.\n\nThe recent immigrant’s lack of industrial training and experience, together with their illiteracy and inability to speak English, leads to unsafe working conditions for other workers. Americans and older immigrants consider this unsatisfactory. When the older employees found dangerous working conditions they protested. The recent immigrants, usually due to ignorance, are still willing to work in those dangerous conditions.\n\nIn mining, an untrained employee may cause danger to all the workers. The increase in employment of recent immigrants in American mines and may be the cause of the increase in mining accidents. Accidents in coal mines arise from two causes: (1) The recklessness and (2) the ignorance and inexperience of employees.\n\nA large proportion of the new arrivals are not only illiterate and unable to read the warning signs in the mines. This is very dangerous. As a consequence, the employment of recent immigrants has caused a worsening in working conditions.\n\nThe problem of European immigration has been a political question for at least twenty-five years. One solution is the literacy test. Since the first law was made in 1882 barring aliens who were undesirable, no laws to improve immigration have been made.\n\nWe need tests that will reject immigrants based on traits that may not be evils in themselves, but will show if the immigrant has other bad traits.\n\nThe illiterate immigrant is a menace to our country. He cannot read, but he is also dangerous in other ways. He adds to our problems of crime, pauperism, and degeneracy. He is more dangerous to the U.S. because he less likely to Americanizing influences than his literate brother.\n\nThe literacy test would strengthen our established policy of excluding undesirable classes. It would keep out men whose dangerous qualities are not easily found by other tests.\n\nInto this favored section of the earth’s surface have been introduced ever increasing numbers of the lower classes of foreign nations. It is significant, however, that the bulk of immigration has been recruited from more and more backward races of Europe as the decades have succeeded each other.\n\nAs regards the new immigrants- those who have come during the last thirty years- the one great reason for their coming is that they believe that on the wage which they can receive in America they can establish a higher standard that the one to which they have been accustomed. And this wage for which they are willing to sell their labor is in general appreciably below that which the native american workman requires to support his standard.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that the American workman is continually underbid in the labor market by vast numbers of alien laborers.\n\nRestrictions like these, adopted earlier in our history as a Nation, would have changed the direction of our country. The right of political asylum has brought to this country many a man of noble character and elevated purpose who was marked as an outlaw in his own less fortunate land.\n\nThe literacy test and the tests and other rules in this law are a radical change in our policies. Before now we have generously kept our doors open to all who were not sick, unable to support themselves or had records that were likely to make them a menace to our country.\n\nIn this bill it is proposed to turn away from tests of character and of quality and impose tests which exclude and restrict. The new tests are not tests of quality or of character or of personal fitness, but tests of opportunity. Those who come seeking opportunity are not to be admitted unless they have already had one of the chief of the opportunities they seek, the opportunity of education.\n\nIf the people of this country have made up their minds to limit the number of immigrants by arbitrary tests and so reverse the policy of all the generations of Americans that have gone before them, it is their right to do so. I am their servant and have no license to stand in their way. But I do not believe that they have.\n\nWhat were the consequences of H.R. 6060?\n\nThe Act fell far short of what its supporters wanted in terms of reducing immigration. Only 1,450 people of 800,000 immigrants between 1920 and 1921 were excluded because they could not pass the literacy test. The literacy test was short lived.\n\nIn 1921 Congress created the Emergency Quota Act (also known as the Emergency Immigration Act of 1921). The 1921 law changed the restriction on immigration to an quota system. Only a certain number of immigrants were allowed to come from different countries. This number was determined as 3% of the total number of residents of that foreign nation currently living in the United States.\n\nThe countries from which people were emigrating could only provide immigration visas to 2 percent of the total number of people of each nationality in the U.S. based on the 1890 census. The law did continue a complete ban on immigrants from East Asia. The Quota numbers are shown in the chart below. (source for the chart)"
