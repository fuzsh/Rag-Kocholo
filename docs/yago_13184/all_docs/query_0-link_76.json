        "text": "A rare portrayal of an Asian-American family is coming soon to a television near you. But if you blink, you might miss it.\n\nUntil recently, Asian-Americans have not been frequently represented on mainstream TV. A foreigner or a best friend has popped up here and there, but rarely have Asian-Americans nabbed chunky lead roles.\n\nThat has been changing slowly, with Asians taking significant parts in “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Lost” and “Heroes.” Even the just-concluded 13th season of venerable reality TV series “Survivor” had a Korean-American winner.\n\nStill, America hasn’t seen a predominantly Asian-American cast on TV since 1994-95, when Margaret Cho’s “All-American Girl” debuted, soared and then … bombed. It was canceled after one season.\n\nMore than a decade later, a new Asian-American cast is ready to take the television stage.\n\n“My Life … Disoriented” is a half-hour family story debuting Tuesday night on PBS as part of its “Independent Lens” series.\n\nThe program follows the Chinese-American Fung family, which has moved from cosmopolitan San Francisco to less diverse Bakersfield. Kimberlee Fung, a high school student, is the main character, and she is surrounded by white kids and a couple of Asian guys at school, and a challenging, multigenerational family at home.\n\n“My Life” was created with help from the Independent Television Service, a producing and grant-making organization under the PBS umbrella that fosters the creation of diverse television programming.\n\nIndependent filmmaker Eric Byler (“Charlotte Sometimes,” “Americanese”) is the director, and the cast includes veteran actors Tamlyn Tomita, Dennis Dun and Hira Ambrosino, as well as Di Quon and Karin Anna Cheung, who made a splash in Justin Lin’s 2003 indie movie, “Better Luck Tomorrow.”\n\n“We always planned for this show to go to PBS,” said Quon, the originator of “My Life … Disoriented.” “PBS has the largest representation of Asian viewers, and they take risks.”\n\nQuon plays main protagonist Kimberlee and based the show on her own experience of moving from the San Francisco Bay Area to Bakersfield.\n\nAs an actress, she grew tired of always playing the auxiliary friend to a white main character.\n\n“If you’re Asian, you’re going to be the friend,” said Quon, who made her big-screen debut in “Maid in Manhattan.”\n\nShe provided a few examples of the friend phenomenon: Lane Kim in “Gilmore Girls,” John Cho in the “American Pie” movies, Brenda Song in “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody,” and her own role in “Grounded for Life.”\n\n“We’re still a minority. They’re still figuring us out as a minority.”\n\nShe recalls having dinner with friends, and she told them she wanted to start her own TV show. When asked what it would be about, she said, “It would be about me. Being the only Asian girl in school.”\n\nThe concept appealed to Byler and Orange County native Claire Yorita Lee, who wrote the script for the first episode.\n\n“It was kind of weird, growing up in Villa Park,” said Lee, 29, who was born in Anaheim and attended Villa Park High School. “I remember thinking if I ever come back in another life, I hope I’m white. I felt that no guys ever liked me because I was Asian. You always feel different.”\n\nByler was in between projects when the writer brought him the script.\n\n“Claire had written a brilliant teleplay for the sort of isolation that Asian-Americans feel in the U.S.,” said the 34-year-old director. “The nerd and popular girl, in-crowd dichotomy is a beautiful metaphor that has a lot of cross-over appeal.”\n\nQuon and Byler tapped some of their friends and professional colleagues, including Tomita, Dunn, Amanda Fuller and Autumn Reeser (who plays Taylor in “The O.C.”). With a grant from ITVS, the group shot for four days in Bakersfield. Follow-up shooting was completed in Los Angeles.\n\nCecilia Tsai, a UC Irvine graduate, served as editor for the project. She put together a five-minute trailer that won hearts and minds at ITVS and secured critical additional funds.\n\n“The pilot definitely has its highs and lows, but it leaves you wanting more,” Tsai said. “It plants a lot of seeds.”\n\nThose involved with this project have established a presence on MySpace (more than 3,300 friends), You Tube and other Web sites. They’ve encouraged people to write to their local PBS stations, and the campaign has apparently worked.\n\nThe program is airing this week on PBS affiliates across the nation, but is not yet scheduled on affiliates in states with low Asian-American populations, such as Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska and New Hampshire.\n\nHype is one thing – eyeballs on TV screens is another. Viewership and response to this week’s program will have a significant impact on whether the show gets picked up by a network for possible expansion into a series.\n\nIT’S A NUMBERS GAME\n\nOne can’t deny the demographics. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Asians make up 4.3 percent of the U.S. population and 12.4 percent of the California populace, and are the nation’s second-fastest growing ethnic group. More than 12.4 million Asians live in the U.S., and 16.1 percent of Orange County’s population is Asian.\n\nNonetheless, “My Life … Disoriented” faces a number of challenges.\n\nFirst is the lack of successful models for a TV program like this. The failure of “All-American Girl” hangs like a specter that remains hard to shake.\n\n“That was kind of like a trial, and it did so poorly,” Quon said. “Networks are afraid of another failure like that. The problem with Margaret Cho’s show, instead of just being, it lived up to the stereotypes.”\n\nSaid Byler: “It made the executives gun-shy about trying it again.”\n\nSecond is the problem of marketing this show to national and ethnic-specific audiences. Though Asians do have a presence in some commercials and TV shows, television producers and executives have not quite figured out the Asian-American market. There just haven’t been enough studies done.\n\nFilmmaker Lin commented in 2003 that Asians are usually lumped into the “white” category when studios are trying to figure out movie-going trends among national audiences.\n\n“You can clearly see the problems that minority programs have getting on the air,” said Frank Cruz of Laguna Niguel, a broadcast veteran and former chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. “It’s not easy to crack. (Networks) have their set audiences that they cater to.”\n\nFinally, even a cast consisting of America’s largest minority group has trouble surviving on TV. Witness “a.k.a. Pablo,” which barely survived a month on ABC in 1984. “American Family,” which featured an all-Latino cast, lasted for two seasons on PBS. Then it vanished.\n\n“The monies were not there, as much as (creator and executive producer) Gregory Nava wanted to continue,” said Alex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition. “It’s very difficult to continue that with a small budget.”\n\nStill, there are success stories. ABC’s “The George Lopez Show” continues in its fourth season, fusing a snappy mix of comedy, ethnic-specific storylines and universal family situations.\n\nAnd “Ugly Betty” – which features many Latino characters and themes – has also been a hit on ABC.\n\nSo perhaps it is time for an Asian-American TV show to succeed.\n\n“I don’t have any doubt that this show will actually become a series,” Quon said.\n\nByler, who has co-written and prepared additional scripts, agrees.\n\n“I do think that things have progressed quite a bit with a number of recognizable names and faces in mainstream media now. Look at how many times TV commercials try to include us. I think it is having an effect on the national ethos. We’re becoming a part of the fabric of our society. This will be a good test.”"
