        "text": "Has America always wanted 'your poor, your tired, your huddled masses'?\n\nImmigration is as old as human history. People move from one place to another for many reasons. When migration occurs across a national border, it is called immigration. When relocation happens within the same country, it is termed emigration. Historians often attribute the movement to \"push-pull\" factors. Sometimes conditions at home become so dangerous or challenging that people are forced to move elsewhere. Wars, famines, economic issues or political oppression are often \"push\" factors encouraging people to seek safety or better conditions somewhere else. Sometimes opportunities in a new land attract newcomers. Cheap and fertile farmlands in the United States lured hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the latter 19th century. Political and religious freedom, good jobs and educational opportunities \"pulled\" many to America to seek a fresh start in the states.\n\nImmigration to Iowa\n\nHistorians usually identify three waves of immigration to Iowa, characterized by the national origin of the immigrants. The fertile Iowa prairies offered for sale at $1.25 an acre attracted thousands from northern Europe and the British Isles. The state government and railroad companies wrote glowing accounts of Iowa’s promise and distributed brochures across Europe in native languages to encourage migration. Germans and Irish were the top two contingents respectively, but British, Dutch, Norwegian and Czech families also swelled Iowa’s population. While new arrivals often formed tightly-knit ethnic communities, they also mingled with native-born settlers from the Ohio River Valley and the Upper South. They arrived with their state churches — Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican — and established newspapers in their native language. During World War I, patriotism in support of the United States often attacked those who had maintained strong cultural ties to their European homeland, especially the Germans. By the time the fighting ceased, Iowa had become more homogenized with less emphasis on cultural diversity.\n\nA second wave of immigration began toward the end of the 19th century and continued through the 1920s. Southern and Eastern Europeans brought new faces to the eastern and Midwestern cities, but also to smaller towns. Italians, Croatians, Greeks and Russians took jobs in coal mines and meat packing plants. Mexicans began heading north to fill jobs during World War I. Unlike native-born American groups and immigrants from Northern Europe who were predominately Protestant, the second-wave immigrant groups brought Catholic affiliations and unfamiliar languages. Sometimes they came as families, but frequently a single male would come over first, get a job and sponsor a brother or nephew. The two would work together to buy tickets for other family members until extended families were reunited in America. At the national level, native-born Americans feared the growing numbers of these new arrivals. Congress passed laws restricting immigration from southern and eastern Europe (and Asia) in favor of northern Europeans.\n\nCivil wars, political oppression and poverty sent a third wave of immigrants to Iowa. In the 1970s, Iowa’s Governor Robert Ray became the only governor in the nation to initiate a government-sponsored resettlement program for southeast Asians who were the victims of the Vietnam War. Refugees from Somalia, Bosnia and other nations in upheaval found their way to Iowa. Churches became active in sponsoring immigrants and helping them to adapt to their new Iowa homeland. Mexicans and other immigrants from Latin American nations found work in agriculture and meat packing. Mechanization in Iowa meat-packing plants created demand that immigrants were willing to take, and towns with these plants — Perry, Storm Lake, Marshalltown — soon attracted a sizable migrant population. Schools faced challenges teaching classes to many students whose native language was not English.\n\nAfrican Americans and Iowa\n\nAfrican Americans in Iowa present a unique history. While some African-American Iowans in the past 50 years came directly from African nations, most are from families that moved north at some point from the American South. The first African Americans in the state often lived in Mississippi River towns with the direct water connection to the South. Others came to the state recruited by meat-packing plants or coal companies. When African-American workers were hired to replace striking white workers, communities dealt with racial tensions. Even when Iowa laws made discrimination in housing, transportation, education or employment illegal, African Americans often faced hurdles to full integration.\n\nWho can come to America is a divisive political issue. Some want to keep the doors open for those seeking a better life, while others worry that immigrants may take jobs from native-born Americans or change the nature of American society. Regardless, Iowa has attracted newcomers since its earliest days and now boasts citizens from around the world.\n\nSupporting Questions\n\nHow have laws regulating immigration changed over time?\n\nBurlingame Treaty, 1868 (Document)\n\nChinese Exclusion Act, May 6, 1882 (Document)\n\n\"How John May Dodge the Exclusion Act\" Illustration, July 12, 1905 (Political Cartoon)\n\n\"Immigration Report: A Banner Year\" Newspaper Article, December 16, 1907 (Document)\n\nBabel Proclamation, May 1918 (Document)\n\nIowa Governor Robert Ray Congressional Hearing Testimony about Refugee Legislation, May 24, 1979 (Document)\n\nIowa English Language Reaffirmation Act, 2002 (Document)\n\nTruth in Immigration (TRIM) Act, November 14, 2005 (Document)\n\nHow have responses and supports for immigrants and refugees evolved over time?\n\n\"Move On\" Silent Film of New York's Lower East Side, October 27, 1903 (Video)\n\n\"The Americanese Wall,\" March 25, 1916 (Political Cartoon)\n\nSewing Class for Refugee Students in Mt.
