        "text": "I've gotten this comment many times myself, so you may be wondering, what should I do?\n\nFirst, you have to decide if the delivery was really a problem or if it is just this student. I have had students tell me that I talk too fast, and others say I talk too slow. Obviously, I can’t make both of these groups of students happy, so I decided to simply talk at the speed that is comfortable for me. In the case of delivery speed, it is an easy fix since the video player allows students to playback the video at 0.75x or 1.5x, too. I also mention this in my introduction video, and the complaints about delivery speed have decreased.\n\nIf you get complaints about your dialect or accent, you do have to remember that you are serving an international audience. I am an American and I had a British student complain because my slides used the word “color” instead of “colour”. Again, you can’t please everyone, so pick a format and go with it. I’ve also had complaints that my “accent” is hard to understand because I speak “American-ese”. If you have a thick accent, it can be beneficial to take some vocal courses that help you minimize your accent, since this will make you easier to understand regardless of where your student is in the world. Often, international students seek out “American” or “British” accents because they are more common and easy to understand in the global marketplace.\n\nIf you get complaints that your delivery is “monotone” or “boring”, you should take that criticism and work to improve your delivery. Students want to be engaged and entertained. Try to use different peaks and valleys to your voice and tell stories as you teach. This will go a long way in creating engaging delivery.\n\nHopefully this helps a bit for some of you who are new to the platform and building your first courses. Remember, you can't please everyone, but do take the time to stop and think if they have a valid point!\n\nJason\n\nI occasionally get told I talk too slow, but for others that is what they say they like about my presentation. A couple of years ago I decided to make a YouTube video where I tried to talk as fast as I see other YouTubers talk. It was only a five minute video and it felt like it was going to kill me trying to keep up that speed for five minutes. I have never done that again and wouldn't do it for a course, but it was interesting that no-one seemed to notice I was talking fast (for me) and that I was struggling throughout the video.\n\nI saw a post somewhere in this community a few weeks ago mentioning about mentioning that you can adjust video speed. I have obviously always known this, but for some reason never thought of it as a solution to suggest but think it is a great idea and will likely do this.\n\nAll the best\n\nDan\n\nI think what matters the most in any delivery is the proper use of pauses... Using them occasionally gives space for a student to grasp information and take some time to understand and think about while not missing anything and it also feels like a conversation between the instructor and the student's mind...\n\nAs for the accent... I think any instructor should go by what is being practiced universally, to me, as much as a student should fully understand whats being said.... An instructor should also feel comfortable explaining a topic so he/she wont miss anything, also if the accent was hard to follow then captions have always been a good solution not to miss any word...\n\nMaking it as storytelling while still maintaining seriousness can keep engagement at its maximum levels to any student... If i could summarize the whole delivery experience.\n\nThis is my first time replying on this forum. I have had a lot of experience doing public speaking and giving public readings (reading what is already written on the page). I am also a professional writer. I have noticed that most people rush too much when they are in front of an audience. They do not pause at the end of sentences or where there's a natural pause. Your punctuation, or what you imagine as punctuation, can be your guide. If you really want to emphasize something, make it stand out by contrasting it from the other things you say. Think of those statements as a single-sentence paragraph.\n\nAnother thing is what some people call \"vocal variety.\" This mean speeding up sometimes, slowing down, pausing, and varying your pitch. Remember to breathe, too. While doing video you have to imagine an audience. Look right at your audience. Don't stare, but make sure you are communicating with your eyes.\n\nUse the punchline effect. End each sentence with a strong word. Take the word \"death,\" for instance. The impact of that word increases if it is at the end of your sentence. In stand-up comedy we were told to avoid peppering our acts with too many swear words. The reasoning, which I see as sound, was that they will lose their shock value and power if you overuse them. The same goes with any word. If you want to shock, surprise, enlight, or delight, remember not to overuse your most powerful or shocking words.\n\nSmile! And be yourself! Avoid talking like a robot even if you really know your stuff. Don't be afraid to use colloquialisms but at the same time, be aware of your international audience. You will need to be very careful with slang that could be misunderstood.\n\nMostly, Be friendly. This will help your audience trust you more. I have seen presenters act too animated, but usually, they are not expressive enough. You want the audience to identify with you. Be personal, but not so personal that you seem to be only talking about yourself. If you are presenting a skill, you want to show them that \"a person just like me\" can learn these things and become a pro."
