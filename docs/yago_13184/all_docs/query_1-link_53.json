        "text": "Library of Congress: Image: The Americanese wall - as Congressman Burnett would build it\n\n\"Prints of cartoon drawings show: 1. high wall labeled \"Literacy Test\" and spiked with pen nibs to keep out immigrants, built as Congressman John Lawson Burnett would like it, with Uncle Sam saying to immigrant family below: \"You're welcome, if you can climb it\"; 2. the menacing face of Franklin Delano Roosevelt on a cat's body staring at a mouse hole labeled \"Nomination\" from which two eyes peer out.\"\n\nEllis Island Immigration Oral Histories\n\n\"The project is one of the world’s largest and most diverse chronicles of the immigrant experience. It includes nearly 2,000 interviews from passengers, families, immigration officials, military personnel, detainees, and former island employees. The recordings are filled with tales of joy, sorrow, and hope, and cumulatively, they paint an expansive and complex picture of our ancestry and culture.\n\nAvailable to researchers, students, educators, and the general public, the Oral History Project is a unique national totem, and an incredible resource for anyone interested in connecting with the voices that built America.\"\n\nA Family Corresponds: Polish Immigrants in the Early 20th century\n\n\"Many immigrants to the United States wrote letters back home. At the time they were written, the missives shaped the expectations of those who would soon make the same journey; today, they gave historians invaluable first-hand testimony of the immigrants’ own experiences. These seventeen letters involved the children of a retired Polish farmer named Raczkowski. Adam Raczkowski went to the United States in 1904 with the financial assistance of his sister Helena Brylska [later Dabrowskis] and his brother Franciszek, who had both previously immigrated. He settled with his brother in Wilmington, Delaware, and obtained factory work. The letters included here cover the years 1904 to 1912 and were written between both Adam and Helena and their sister Teofila, who remained in Poland.\"\n\nImmigrants in the Coal Fields Oral History Project\n\n\"This project documents the lives of immigrant coal miners in eastern Kentucky. In the early twentieth century, people from Belgium, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Scotland, Russia, and Yugoslavia settled in Hazard, Himlerville (now Beauty), Jackson, Lynch, and other eastern Kentucky towns. Immigrants and their descendants discuss schools, prejudice and other problems they have experienced, the roles of women in mining camps, social activities, ethnic clubs, moonshine, World War II, housing, coal mining, mechanization, union activities, the United Mine Workers of America, Miners for Democracy, United States Steel, wages, mine safety, company stores, scrip, and mine bosses.\""
