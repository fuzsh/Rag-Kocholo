        "text": "The Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924, together known as “The Quota Acts,” set specific limits (quotas) on how many immigrants the U.S. would admit from every country each year. These acts made immigration easier for northern and western Europeans and much harder for immigrants from the rest of Europe and other nations. The strict quotas later contributed to the difficulties many Jews and other minorities faced as they sought refuge in the U.S. from persecution overseas before and during World War II and the Holocaust.\n\nUnder a presidential directive dated Dec. 22, 1945, President Truman authorized displaced persons and refugees to receive expedited admission into the U.S., within the framework of existing immigration law.\n\nAt the president’s request, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization traveled to Europe to investigate conditions and develop a plan to process displaced persons. Ultimately, the INS collaborated with the U.S. military, the U.S. Public Health Service, the Department of State, and numerous charitable organizations on a plan that allowed over 40,000 displaced persons to enter the U.S. under the existing quota regulations.\n\nAdditionally, the president’s directive allowed approximately 1,000 refugees already in the U.S. to adjust to lawful permanent resident status.\n\nUnder a Presidential Directive dated December 22, 1945, President Truman authorized the expedited admission of displaced persons and refugees within the framework of existing immigration law.\n\nAt the President’s request, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization traveled to Europe to investigate and develop a plan for processing displaced persons. Ultimately, the INS, the military, the Public Health Service, the Department of State, and numerous charitable organizations collaborated to facilitate the entry of over 40,000 displaced persons under the existing quota regulations.\n\nAdditionally, the President’s directive allowed approximately 1,000 refugees already in the U.S. to adjust to lawful permanent resident status.\n\nThe Displaced Persons Act of 1948, the first specific “refugee” act passed by Congress, aimed to address the nearly 7 million displaced persons in Europe as a result of World War II. The act allowed refugees to enter the U.S. within the constraints of the existing quota system. The law required that admitted displaced persons find a place to live in the U.S. and a job that would not replace a worker already in the country. The Displaced Persons Act expired in 1952. Under the Act, the U.S. admitted more than 350,000 displaced persons.\n\nIn response to the refugee crisis after World War II, in 1950 the United Nations created the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), also known as the UN Refugee Agency. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees acts as the guardian of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which defines the legal protections for refugees. Though the U.S. did not sign the 1951 Convention, the U.S. later signed the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which broadened the scope of the Convention.\n\nFollowing the rapid and violent 1956 Hungarian Revolution against the Soviet Union, thousands of Hungarians fled their homeland and sought refuge in Austria, which soon became overwhelmed by the influx of refugees. As a result, 36 nations, including the U.S., offered to help resettle the displaced Hungarians. The U.S. admitted 6,130 Hungarian refugees under the Refugee Relief Act of 1953.\n\nAdditionally, over 30,000 Hungarians entered the U.S. under the attorney general’s parole authority (section 212[d][5] of the INA). INS officers examined these applicants in Austria and again when they arrived in the U.S., where they were temporarily held at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.\n\nTwo years later, on July 25, 1958, Congress passed a law allowing Hungarian parolees to become lawful permanent residents of the United States.\n\nThis program set the precedent for using the attorney general’s parole authority to admit refugees to the U.S. and for Congress to later pass special legislation allowing the parolees to become lawful permanent residents. This process would be repeated on several occasions during the following decades.\n\nTo raise awareness of the continuing global refugee problem, the United Nations designated the year 1959-1960 as World Refugee Year. In recognition, Congress passed the Fair Share Refugee Act of July 14, 1960, which allowed nearly 5,000 refugees to enter the U.S. under the attorney general’s parole authority. The law also provided the means for these refugees to become lawful permanent residents after two years in the U.S.\n\nAfter the Cuban Revolution that brought Fidel Castro into power on Jan. 1, 1959, thousands of Cubans fled for the U.S.\n\nWhen the U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961, Cubans could no longer obtain visas in Havana. Instead, the U.S. admitted them under the attorney general’s parole authority. During the years 1961-1962, more than 58,000 Cubans entered the U.S. under this program.\n\nThe INS operated special processing centers in the Miami, Florida area, where INS officers screened newly arrived Cubans. The INS also held the Cubans until they could be admitted to the U.S. as refugees.\n\nThe 1965 Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) eliminated the quota system and established a preference category for conditional entrants. These were aliens in noncommunist countries who had fled a communist country or the Middle East and were unwilling to return due to persecution or fear of persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion. They also included people who were uprooted by catastrophic natural calamities as defined by the president.\n\nUnder the Act, conditional entrants were granted a temporary immigration status which could be adjusted to permanent resident status after two years.\n\nThe 1965 Act marked the first time Congress provided a permanent basis for the admission of refugees. The Act authorized 10,200 to 17,400 refugees to receive visas each year.\n\nInitially, because the Act’s preference categories applied only to Eastern Hemisphere countries, natives of the Western Hemisphere could not enter the U.S. as conditional entrants. However, Congress passed legislation in 1976 and 1978 that made the status available to all refugees.\n\nAt the same time that he signed the 1965 Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) into law, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would open the U.S. to all Cubans seeking refuge from Fidel Castro’s communist regime. Shortly thereafter, hundreds of small boats filled with refugees began making the journey from Cuba to southern Florida.\n\nIn order to more safely and efficiently bring Cubans to the U.S., the federal government created an airlift program on Dec. 1, 1965. Under this program, Cubans already in the U.S. could apply to have relatives brought into the country. Cuban refugees were screened in Cuba, flown to Miami, and screened again in special processing centers by the INS and other inspection agencies.\n\nBy the conclusion of the airlift program in1973, over 3,000 flights had brought more than 250,000 Cuban refugees to the United States.\n\nThe INS began granting asylum to aliens already in the U.S. as a way to uphold the principle of asylum in the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ Refugee Protocol and Convention and to ensure that no refugees were returned to conditions of persecution. Under these polices, INS officials could use existing procedures such as parole, stays of deportation, and adjustment of status to allow aliens who feared persecution in their homeland to remain in the country.\n\nThe end of the Vietnam War created a large flow of refugees, many of whom had supported the U.S. war effort. As a result, approximately 130,000 Southeast Asian refugees entered the U.S. through the attorney general’s parole authority in the months immediately following the fall of Saigon. The Indochinese Immigration and Refugee Act funded their transportation and resettlement.\n\nINS officers inspected the refugees at special reception centers where they were held until they could be resettled.\n\nUltimately, about 300,000 Southeast Asians entered the U.S. through the attorney general’s parole authority between 1975 and 1980.\n\nIn 1977, Congress enacted a law that allowed Southeast Asian refugees who had entered the U.S. through the attorney general’s parole authority the opportunity to become lawful permanent residents.\n\nOver a decade after the 1967 UN Refugee Protocol and in the midst of the continuing influx of refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia after the Vietnam War, Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980. The Act created a uniform and comprehensive policy to proactively address refugee admissions by:\n\nRemoving the geographic and ideological limits on the definition of “refugee” that had been introduced by the 1965 Amendments to the INA. The new law formally adopted the United Nations’ definition.\n\nProviding the first statutory basis for asylum.\n\nIncreasing the number of refugees who could be admitted annually.\n\nCreating the Office of Refugee Resettlement to oversee resettlement programs.\n\nUnder the Act, the president, in consultation with Congress, sets the annual number of refugee admissions and the allocation of these admissions to refugees coming from various parts of world.\n\nOn April 20, 1980, the Castro regime announced that all Cubans wishing to go to the U.S. were free to board boats at the Port of Mariel. From April to October 1980, around 125,000 Cubans entered the U.S. Many travelled to Florida on boats organized by grassroots American supporters.\n\nPresident Carter decided not to classify the Cubans as “refugees” under the newly passed Refugee Act of 1980, and instead used the Attorney General’s parole authority to allow them into the U.S. INS officers screened the Cubans in special reception centers and oversaw the long-term detention of criminals who arrived and who officials considered unsuitable to release.\n\nIn 1984, some of these Cubans were able to adjust to lawful permanent resident status under the terms of the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 contained special legalization provisions which allowed others to adjust their status.\n\nIn 1990, the Lautenberg Amendment established a reduced evidentiary burden for applications for refugee status from certain categories of people, including Jews and some Christian minorities from the Former Soviet Union, as well as some individuals from Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. In 2004, the Specter Amendment added certain Iranian religious minorities. Because the language of the Lautenberg Amendment is not permanent, it must be extended through legislation each fiscal year.\n\nResponding to growing numbers of people requesting asylum, INS proposed the creation of an “Asylum Corps” of immigration officers in 1987. The agency implemented the new policy in 1990, and a select group of officers began to receive training in international law and conditions around the world.\n\nIn April 1991, seven specialized asylum offices opened at sites around the country, in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Newark, Arlington, Miami, and Houston.\n\nIn 1992, INS employed approximately 150 asylum officers and over 100,000 people filed for asylum.\n\nUnder this act, certain Nicaraguans and Cubans who had fled their home countries and lived in the U.S. without permanent resident status could become lawful permanent residents, provided they had resided in the U.S. continuously and met other admissibility requirements.\n\nThe act also allowed certain individuals from Guatemala, El Salvador, and former Soviet bloc countries to have their deportations suspended and removals cancelled.\n\nFollowing 9/11 and the subsequent creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) split into three separate organizations: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n\nUSCIS became the primary agency that oversees refugee and asylum affairs in cooperation with the Department of State, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other agencies. Within USCIS, the Refugee, Asylum and International Operations Directorate carries out refugee policies. In 2005, USCIS formed the Refugee Corps, composed of specially-trained refugee officers who travel around the world to interview refugee applicants seeking resettlement in the United States."
