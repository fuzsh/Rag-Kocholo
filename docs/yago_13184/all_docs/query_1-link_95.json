        "text": "Is there a rule where the spelling of answers has to be in \"American\"?\n\nNo. See What should the standard spelling be - British or US?\n\nFrom that meta Stack Exchange Q & A's accepted answer by a Community Manager:\n\nDoes SOFU have an accepted standard on language and spelling? Which is it?\n\nFor bodies, no. For tags, US-English.\n\nAnd from the second answer with more votes:\n\nIt is not acceptable to change American to British spellings or British to American.\n\nWhy do people accept revisions to old answers...\n\nIf the only edit has been from neighbourhood to neighborhood, I'm pretty sure it would have been rejected. I would have, anyway. As it was, the edit seemed good overall, correcting several minor errors. The age of the post really has no bearing on the matter.\n\nI'll admit I missed the change to neighborhood, removing the 'u', but that is easily fixed (and done).\n\nI would say that conventions like this are going to gravitate toward the majority of the user base. I don't know if SE keeps stats on this but I suspect it is mostly American english (or ESL where E is really American E). This is also why the site is in English and not Spanish or Russian or French (however that is a rule).\n\nAnother area where this happens is date formats in SQL Server. I harp on people all the time to use YYYYMMDD and YYYY-MM-DD precisely because of our audience. When I see a post that uses British date format (dd/mm/yyyy) I usually comment or just correct it because I know that a large portion of our audience will be unsure if 07/06/2016 is July 6th or June 7th. This is a much different comprehension issue than color vs. colour, but a similar concept (the difference in spelling can't cause misinterpretation in any cases I'm aware of).\n\nSo, this is going to happen. Some people refuse to acknowledge British spelling, and some people are just ignorant of it. I suspect in almost all cases it has nothing to do with being anti-British or posturing that American spelling is correct and British spelling isn't.\n\nJust to add my view in addition to Paul's answer\n\nHi, I was one of the reviewers that clicked accept. I saw the the per sei fixed, the syncronous fixed, the dashes correction looked a bit superfluous and honestly didn't think about neighbourhood being correct in British English while reviewing (even though I know).\n\nJust like Paul I wouldn't have accepted if it didn't fix the syncronous among others.\n\nI do agree I probably wouldn't have bothered to edit the answer myself as it's perfectly readable.\n\nAs to editing old posts, I think that's a good thing when done to a good question/answer as it pushes the question back to the top where it can be noticed by others offering other (maybe more up to date) insights."
