I've learned that the British don't have yards but, rather, gardens; they wear their pants under their trowsers and paraffin is not a wax, but kerosene. And don't even think of asking a Brit to fetch your fanny pack.\n\nIn Australia Utes are not native Americans, but cars.\n\nAnyone else have any examples of the peculiar expressions these strange foreigners use?\n\nLast edited by a moderator: May 15, 2010\n\nKathryn\n\nIt was on fire when I laid down on it.\n\nMay 15, 2010\n\n#2\n\nWell, the last time I flew on British Airways, they tried to serve me Toad in a Hole and Spotted Dick. I passed on those but I did indulge in clotted cream and strawberries.\n\nAfter I got off the plane, I smoked a ***.\n\nMadhuri\n\nRF Goddess\n\nMay 15, 2010\n\n#3\n\nHas anyone seen my thongs? I mean...flip flops.\n\nPut a nappy on that baby...I mean diaper.\n\nI love beetroot...I mean beets (that's for Enchanted!)\n\nI find Australian language interesting because we say some things as the English do and some things as the Americans do. For instance, we also say 'yard' here.\n\nKathryn\n\nIt was on fire when I laid down on it.\n\nMay 15, 2010\n\n#5\n\nIf your car is running rough, take a look under the bonnet.\n\nMay 16, 2010\n\n#6\n\nDon't forget cookies, biscuits and crackers.

Ah well what is up with not using the metric system? I mean like come on isn't a crash into Mars enough to convince good ol' us of a that metric is better than imperial?\n\nBesides, I thought usa left the brits a while back, since imperial was created by the great imperialists brit's perhaps usa should go with the great republicists, da french and their metric system.\n\nI find that having to use three different dictionaries for english is annoying. I got the Macquarie for Australian english. The shorter Oxford for english english. and Websters for American english.\n\nAint it weird that only Websters is available for free on the net, you guys want us all to speak Amercian english, i'm sure!\n\nJMorris\n\nDemocratic Socialist\n\nMay 16, 2010\n\n#16\n\nWhat is my major gripe with americanese/ise/ize?
