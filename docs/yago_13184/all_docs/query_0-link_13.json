        "text": "IFC Entertainment has announced a deal for North American rights to Eric Byler‘s “AMERICANese,” which won the audience award and an ensemble acting prize during its world premiere at SXSW this year. It is having its East Coast premiere this weekend at the Hamptons International Film Festival on Long Island, NY. Based on Shawn Wong‘s novel American Knees, the film was produced by Lisa Onodera and stars Chris Tashima, Kelly Hu, Allison Sie, Ben Shenkman, Sab Shimono and Michael Paul Chan. The film, to be released via the IFC First Take label in theaters and day-and-date via cable VOD, is Byler’s follow-up to his 2002 feature “Charlotte Sometimes,” which screened at the Hamptons fest that year. IFCE’s president Jonathan Sehring and new VP of acquisitions and productions Arianna Bocco negotiated the deal with John J. Sie of AJS Ventures and John Sloss of Cinetic Media on behalf of the film.
