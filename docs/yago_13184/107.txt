NEW YORK — IFC Entertainment has acquired all North American rights to Eric Byler’s relationship drama “Americanese” for its IFC First Take program.

“Americanese,” which had its East Coast premiere this weekend at the Hamptons International Film Festival, this year won the Audience Award for best narrative feature and Jury Prize for ensemble acting at the South by Southwest International Film Festival.

Based on Shawn Wong’s 1995 novel “American Knees,” the film follows a pair of Asian-Americans as they deal with romantic issues in their lives. The film was produced by Lisa Onodera and will be released next year.

The deal was negotiated by IFC Entertainment president Jonathan Sehring and vp acquisitions and production Arianna Bocco with John Sie of AJS Ventures and John Sloss of Cinetic Media on behalf of the film.
