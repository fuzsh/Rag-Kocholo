        "text": "Both “Frank and Cindy” and “Weepah Way for Now” are fiction features, but each one obviously draws comedic and realistic details from the fringes of L.A.’s entertainment business. That naturally makes them consistently hilarious, and sometimes kind of scary.\n\nG.J. Echternkamp’s “Frank and Cindy” is the most obviously autobiographical; he’s a named character in the new movie, played by Johnny Simmons, and wrote the script based on his 2007 documentary of the same name.\n\nOliver Platt is Frank, G.J.’s stepfather and former member of one-hit wonder 1980s band OXO. Rene Russo, paying off big on the comeback promise she too briefly displayed in “Nightcrawler” last year, is Frank’s recovering alcoholic wife and G.J.’s mom Cindy, who’s groupie dreams of wealth and Grammy ceremonies crashed long ago as her second husband grew porcine and indolent in their South Pasadena home.\n\nShot for a good part in that actual house, the movie takes place when G.J. moved back in for a bit between higher education stints. Newly sober Cindy is determined to be a better mom to her aimless boy than she was in the past, but between arguing with Frank and her incorruptible ability to screw up, Russo just heartily takes the opportunity to plumb every behavioral possibility dysfunction has to offer. The actress reportedly hung out with the real Cindy beforehand, and the resulting character is a laugh-and-cringe masterpiece. Kinda sweet, too.\n\nPlatt has a less demonstrative role, but Frank comes into his poignant own as G.J. decides, with nothing else better to do than to make a documentary about the parents. The hope is that the project will goose Frank back to making and performing music people want to hear, give the budding director his own direction in life and maybe, just maybe, improve Cindy’s marriage. It takes a little too long for all of these possibilities to play out, but I can’t think of anything in “Frank and Cindy” I’d want to see go missing.\n\n“Weepah’s” young adult sisters Elle and Joy are played by real-life, So Cal-raised siblings Aly and AJ Michalka. They’re holed-up together on the Laurel Canyon street, bickering and busting each other’s, um, bearings as only co-dependent sisters who know everything about each other can.\n\nBetween the jousting, however, affection and understanding of one another’s sometimes hilarious neuroses shine through. The gals are preparing to restart their stagnant careers with an ill-advised, out-of-the-way concert tour, and as they make plans for their going away party they pine, profanely and quite touchingly, for their Calabasas youth and worry about their divorced mom (an outstanding Mimi Rogers) and dad crossing paths.\n\nA raunchy joke like you’ve never seen before and unexpected tragedy visit the party, as well as old boyfriends. Writer-director Stephen Pierce Ringer maintains proper emotional temperature throughout the film’s tonal shifts. He also provides reams of smart dialogue that can get overly written, but in a generally enjoyable “New Girl”/”Mindy Project” kind of way.\n\nMostly, though, the Michalka sisters have a field day playing the type of Hollywood girls you think you can’t stand but somehow dig hanging out with the most."
