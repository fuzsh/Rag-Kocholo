        "text": "Aly and AJ Michalka first hit stardom with their band Aly & AJ, which aired a concert on Disney Channel, leading the sisters to TV movies (MTV’s Super Sweet 16) and series (The CW’s Hellcats). They more recently scored roles in a couple hit TV comedies, with AJ newly promoted to series regular on ABC‘s The Goldbergs and Aly playing the lead’s best friend on The CW’s iZombie.\n\nTheir careers take another turn with Weepah Way for Now, an independent film from writer-director (and Aly’s husband) Stephen Ringer in which they star and also produced with Ringer and Kerry Barden. The film will premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 16 and centers on two sisters dealing with adulthood and family tragedy in the week before they leave on a music tour. The Hollywood Reporter exclusively debuts a new clip from the drama.\n\nIn the scene, the sisters share their doubts with their divorced mother (Mimi Rogers) about her new fiancé (“His name is Lou. Say it out loud: Lou”) while arguing over their own boyfriend issues.\n\nThe film features narration from Saoirse Ronan (Atonement, The Grand Budapest Hotel) voicing a third sister who died at birth. Amanda Crew (Silicon Valley), Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite), Dan Byrd (Cougar Town), Tyler Labine (Deadbeat), Madeline Zima (Californication) and Gil Bellows (Ally McBeal) round out the cast."
