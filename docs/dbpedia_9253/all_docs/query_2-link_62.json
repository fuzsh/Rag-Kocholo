Tammy pressures her 14 year old daughter to find a man and settle down, and Vallie Sue wants her 31 year old mother to settle down and stop looking for a husband.\n\nThe two comes to blows, as Vallie Sue in teenage turmoil, battered by emotions, life, her everyday existence, hormones, the inability to handle the stress she is under, wanting her mother to settle down and stop looking for Mr. Right Now, overflow and both, momentarily act out.\n\nMore than simply a family drama, \"Angles in Stardust,\" vividly portrays life under the poverty line, limitations in money, limits opportunity, emasculates hope, and incapacitates. Soon, the promising dreams, which could be fulfilled are ground to a fine dust, and lay disjointed in the mind with no hope of recovery.\n\nRounding out the story, \"Angles in Stardust\" with precision portrays the directions people move to when life has left them empty. Both sides, the gravitations to God and to earthly, temporal, numbing fulfillments and the depths of these road are presented with Michael Spears as Tenkills, Amelia Rose Blaire and Adam Taylor, as Pleasant, all hitting the mark.\n\nTammy explains to her daughter if she doesn't leave the home, the state will take her, as she will not change her plans. Fortunately, with the help of \"Angel\" Tenkills, Vallie Sue escapes the boundaries of Stardust.\n\n\"Angels in Stardust,\" is really a must see. Alicia Silverstone rocks this role. It was stunning to see her transformation from Beverly Hills privileged Cher in \"Clueless\" to Tammy. She is gifted and gives and honest portrayal.\n\n\"Angles in Stardust\" is filled with truthful performances throughout. The ensemble brings it in this family drama. \"Angles in Stardust\" has momentary heightened fear and deals with exploitation of women, friends gone missing, and physical and mental abuse.\n\nFirst time Director, William Robert Carey has a hit with \"Angels in Stardust.\"\n\n\"Angels in Stardust\" is available everywhere. See it."
