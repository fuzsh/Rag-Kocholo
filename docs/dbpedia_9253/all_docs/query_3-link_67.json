        "text": "This is obviously going to be full of spoilers. Just a heads-up.\n\nSo the Noelle Stevenson reboot of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power finished up recently, and like the big queer nerd I am, I have some things to say about it. Namely: this show is a marvel, but what else would be expected from Noelle Stevenson and a team of creators that obviously have Sailor Moon (and most other good things) running through their veins?\n\nObviously it’s a really big deal that they actually said yes to letting Adora and Catra, the main characters, end up together, explicitly saying “I love you” and kissing. Contrast with: Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus being gay in Japan but being dubbed into being cousins in the original English-language dub (something that, even as a child unaware of my own queer, I thought was ridiculous; I learned to use the internet by reading Sailor Moon fansites, so I knew they were meant to be lesbians long before the third and fourth seasons were released and found the shoddy cover, one of several de-queerings done by that dub, to be absurd); Marceline and Bubblegum being “exes” on Adventure Time; Korra and Asami’s happy-ever-after in Legend of Korra (while significant) being holding hands and walking together into the distance, not actually saying words or kissing. (I’m not including Steven Universe in this list because I haven’t actually finished it and don’t want to miss examples or anything.)\n\nDrift partner pointed out that the joy of Korra and Asami was that she’d personally wanted it to happen from the beginning but it wasn’t an obvious possibility the whole time, and I understand that. It’s always exciting when you see characters you think should hook up or be queer and they actually do or are against, you know, the heterosexual patterns of television: Karolina and Nico of Runaways, who weren’t actually canon prior to their getting together in the TV show (and it’s really wonderful to see that the TV writers took one look at Karolina’s lesbian pining from the comics and said “we can do better”), that time they actually let Yara of Game of Thrones be queer (it disappoints me to no end that I’ve seen that this is only canon in the show, not the books), the time they let Nora and Salome kiss on True Blood (albeit tragically) and my young queer heart leapt for joy and then just one episode later Pam and Tara did the same. I’m not knocking how exciting that is.\n\nBut I think it’s also really exciting to see characters that are clearly bonded in one way or another from the absolute beginning actually getting to find love. If Catra was a boy, for example, this would have been inevitable, possibly to the point of being exhausting because that would make the dynamic between them a lot weirder but also more conventional. But Catra and Adora are both girls, and they’re friends to enemies to friends to lovers in the best way. It was always pretty obvious to me that Catra was in love with Adora, and probably vice-versa, but I wasn’t sure if that was just me seeing what seems like obvious queer subtext in a place that it would never come to fruition. Not, mind, because I don’t trust Noelle Stevenson. I do, a lot. But because I try not to let my hopes get up for queer things because the world is garbage.\n\nI’ll admit I had a moment in the first season, after Netossa and Spinnerella were introduced and confirmed queer. I wondered: was this Noelle Stevenson’s way of saying “we’re doing what we can, but we can’t do all that we want to”? Were these side characters meant to be our queer consolation prize? (This is not to make light of Netossa and Spinnerella, mind; I think they’re great, and furthermore every time I see Spinnerella’s tummy I rejoice. But they were the last princesses to be introduced and clearly meant as supporting cast, not main: they might have a little more leeway because they’re less significant.) But I put that from my mind. Even if it was just subtext, this show gave me so many great queer things: the strong evidence that Bow is trans; Bow’s dads; just everything about the Princess Prom; Scorpia the big soft feelings dyke; Double Trouble the fabulous nonbinary criminal mess; literally everyone probably being some kind of queer even if it isn’t explicitly said.\n\nAnd queer or no, the characters and their relationships are phenomenally diverse and fantastic. You have, in the younger generation:\n\nAdora herself (voiced by Aimee Carrero of Elena of Avalor fame), a brawling everygirl with a gigantic guilt complex and no shortage of identity issues but a giant heart\n\nCatra (voiced by AJ Michalka of Aly & AJ, who’s also been on Steven Universe), a scrawny, angry mess of a definitely-not-white catgirl struggling with self-worth and abandonment issues who’s best summarized by this piece of art that I encountered at a con last year\n\nGlimmer (voiced by Karen Fukuhara of Suicide Squad and The Boys), an adorable, insecure, chubby, definitely-not-white princess who got what I call the “Willow arc” (i.e. magic addiction, which I… well, that’s another subject entirely)\n\nBow (voiced by Marcus Scribner from Black-ish and etc.), a beautiful black (trans) boy archer (and maker, as in maker of crafts and inventions) who’s canonically designated the “feelings one”\n\nPerfuma (voiced by Genesis Rodriguez, aka Big Hero 6‘s Honey Lemon), a willowy (ha-ha) hippie princess (who’s definitely not white either) who constantly holds back her incredible plant-based powers and instead tries to appeal emotionally\n\nMermista (voiced by Vella Lovell from My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend), a curvy, darker-skinned, gloriously sarcastic mermaid-shifter/aquakinetic princess with a passion for mystery stories\n\nEntrapta (voiced by Christine Woods, who’s been in so many things, none of which I’m familiar with), an isolated, brilliant, and visibly (though not confirmedly) autistic princess whose penchant for tech often gets prioritized over everything else\n\nScorpia (voiced by Lauren Ash, recently of Superstore), the aforementioned big soft feelings dyke who craves acceptance and is a better friend than everyone else ever\n\nFrosta (voiced by Merit Leighton, of Alexa and Katie and Sofia the First), the youngest princess (and Asian, Pacific Islander, or Inuit-adjacent), who tries to get everyone to take her seriously and really enjoys punching\n\nNetossa (voiced by Krystal Joy Brown, who’s been on a lot of things a little bit), a dark-skinned and just a little bit punk princess who’s married to Spinnerella\n\nSpinnerella (voiced by Noelle Stevenson herself), a chubby, sweet, pink-and-purple princess who’s married to Netossa\n\nAnd amongst them you have all manner of relationships. Catra resents Adora being “better” than her by their mentor Shadow Weaver’s measure and also resents her becoming She-Ra and running off to help the Rebellion, but even as she fights her she still loves her and ultimately accepts and acts on that; Adora has complicated feelings about Catra but tries over and over to appeal to her latent good nature and love. Catra also becomes friends with Scorpia and, well, takes advantage of the latter’s big-hearted generosity and love; they also bond with Entrapta after Catra convinces her she was left behind, and while Scorpia tries to actually be Entrapta’s friend Catra is less good at that. Glimmer and Bow are absolute best friends forever who seamlessly fold Adora into their group while still having their own loving bond. Glimmer especially has kind of a big-sister thing with Frosta, and Spinnerella and Netossa seem to view her as kind of a surrogate daughter. Bow and Perfuma are particular friends, as are Perfuma and Mermista; Perfuma also ultimately bonds with Scorpia, probably because they’re both feelings queers, and I’m pleased to report that while they don’t actually say anything explicit in the show the Wiki states that they’re now dating. Mermista is on-off with Sea Hawk the pirate, in what fans have described as “bisexual solidarity.” Entrapta confuses pretty much everyone at some point and is confused by them in turn, but they ultimately all care about each other. Oh, and Swift Wind the horse is She-Ra’s soulbond creature but has good rapport with everyone; Catra also acquires a soulbond creature, Melog the shapeshifter magic cat, in the last season and if they don’t make a plushie they’re throwing money away.\n\nAnd, to go back to the initial remarkable stuff: Catra and Adora actually get together at the end. It’s deeply emotional and passionate and full of hardcore soulbond stuff as well. Adora’s love for Catra helps her transform into She-Ra again; Catra’s love for Adora helps her save Adora at the Heart of Etheria. They go to the ends of the universe for each other and with each other. Catra lets Adora slowly break her boundaries down; Adora lets Catra take care of her, something she’s notoriously bad at allowing. It’s a lovely, epic, fairytale-anime romance (that did, admittedly, make me start singing “The Power of Love” from the English dub of Sailor Moon R: The Promise of the Rose at one point). It shouldn’t be revolutionary, but it really is.\n\nGlimmer and Bow get together, which is adorable and also something that you could see coming from two thousand miles away. I don’t mean this in a bad way. They’re lovely and respectful and although they have their differences, specifically relating to the “Willow arc,” they get through them and come out stronger. Sea Hawk and Mermista keep doing their thing, too.\n\nSpinnerella gets brainwashed in the last season, and there’s a lot of great material with Netossa trying to get her back. She has to walk the line between fighting to win and not wanting to permanently damage her wife, because, as she openly admits, “you’re my weakness.” It’s very emotional.\n\nAnd like I said, Perfuma and Scorpia end up together, which is great. They’ve only known each other for a season, but they seem to bond immediately. Perfuma defends Scorpia against people that have been mean to her (Catra) and tries to buoy her self-confidence, especially when they’re undercover; Scorpia sacrifices herself to save Perfuma (and Sea Hawk and Double Trouble). Perfuma refuses to attack Scorpia when she’s brainwashed, instead doing that very Her thing of trying to break through the brainwash with Love and Friendship. They’re last seen flirting with each other. This is great because it’s fast-tracked; they kind of did the thing that drift partner and I did IRL, where we were quick friends visibly falling in love and by the time we admitted it we were already all in.\n\nWe had a running joke that She-Ra was ___ but better. Drift partner wanted Endgame to be an “Amy’s Choice,” referencing Doctor Who; she wanted to see characters in the soul stone forced to choose between a made-up but ideal life and their tricky but rewarding real one, and lo and behold, She-Ra had an episode that was exactly that. (We actually met one of the animators at a convention and shared this with him, which he found delightful.) It also did Star Wars better than The Rise of Skywalker did, the rebellion and the brainwashing/subsequent redemption (Catra) and the related romance in particular. So-on etcetera. Wrong Hordak also reminded us of Enoch on Agents of SHIELD, but neither is better because they’re both hilarious. There’s Sailor Moon in every episode; there’s a fair amount of Avatar in the finale. It’s just a collection of wonderful things handled wonderfully.\n\nAnd, yeah, I do believe that it was ___ but better because it’s in the hands of queer people. Sorry if that’s a hot take. I’m not saying all queer people are automatically better than straight people, in general or at handling characters, but like, refer back to the Star Wars example: I think a lot of the reasons that Catra/Adora is superior to Kylo/Rey come down to the queer stuff. It changes the dynamic, but it’s also markedly less predatory and unnerving because it’s being handled with respect and real care from a queer storyteller’s perspective. These are people finally getting to tell a story that means a lot to them, and they’re putting the proper amount of care into it, not just rushing through a nonsensical final act having to tie together a bunch of disparate bullshit.\n\nAnyway, I think my ultimate point about this show, aside from being proud of how queer it is, is that I as an adult actually greatly prefer media that subscribes to the idea that you do, in fact, gotta believe in the power of love. Stories where a plucky group of heroes, friends and partners and coworkers and etc., band together to fight whatever evil (in She-Ra’s case, evil starts out as a shadowy military and ends as a genocidal cult, so take that as you will) and they realize that they may have magic and cool toys and whatever else but what matters the most is that they try, because they love each other and are passionate about what they believe. There is so much horror, both in fiction and in the real world, and progress can feel slow or even nonexistent, but I firmly believe that everything important we can do to fight that horror and inspire that progress comes from love and respect and the kinds of things that shows like She-Ra advocate. It’s about coming together and standing for what you know is true and right and good, and it’s about love winning. That can be really damn hard to picture, because we live in kind of a dumpster fire of a world, but working for it is absolutely necessary."
