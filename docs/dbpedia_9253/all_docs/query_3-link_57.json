        "text": "For over five decades, General Hospital has been a staple in the world of daytime television drama. Premiering in 1963, this long-standing American soap opera has earned a dedicated following and a myriad of accolades for its storylines and characters. At the heart of the show's success lies the talented cast members who breathe life into their roles. Through dramatic twists and heart-wrenching revelations, these actors keep audiences captivated by weaving an ever-evolving tale of love, betrayal, and intrigue.\n\nThe exceptional General Hospital cast list features actors who portray some of TV's most cherished and abhorred characters. Each actor helps to create memorable portrayals that resonate with viewers. Take Maurice Benard's portrayal of Sonny Corinthos as an example; his inclusion in the General Hospital cast spans decades as he brings depth and complexity to an enigmatic mobster struggling with bipolar disorder. Steve Burton has captured hearts as Jason Morgan thanks to his performances that keep fans invested in his character's journey. In Laura Wrightâ€™s role as Carly Corinthos, she evolved from a troublemaker into one of Port Charles' most influential personalities over time."
