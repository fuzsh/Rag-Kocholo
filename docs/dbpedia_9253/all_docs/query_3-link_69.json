        "text": "ABC’s Jenkintown-set comedy The Goldbergs has been renewed for an eighth season, but its spin-off, Schooled, which Goldbergs creator Adam F. Goldberg had based on his days as a student at Philly’s William Penn Charter School, won’t be back.\n\nGoldberg broke the bad news on Twitter, writing that he was “beyond grateful” to the network and ABC entertainment president Karey Burke “for giving us 35 episodes to show that teachers like CB are the real heroes.”\n\nCB, a character played by Brett Dier, was, like so many on the show, named for a real Penn Charter teacher, Charles Brown.\n\nABC earlier this month promoted the prom-themed season finales of Schooled and The Goldbergs, which both feature a fictional Quaker school called “William Penn Academy,” by sending Penn Charter seniors, whose prom, like so many others, couldn’t be held this month, “a prom in a box” that included an instant camera, snacks, and crowns and sashes for prom kings and queens.\n\nOne of those seniors was Anne Flemming, whose mother, Liz Flemming, was Goldberg’s eighth-grade math teacher and who’s also been a recurring character on the show, played by Lennon Parham.\n\n» READ MORE: ABC sends Penn Charter seniors a \"prom in a box\"\n\n\"Every time I hear my name on the TV, I kind of like giggle,” Flemming said in an interview at the time."
