        "text": "Aly & AJ‚Äôs Aly Michalka is so stunning, and pregnancy truly looks amazing on her. (And this enchanting new photo proves it!)\n\nOn April 24, Michalka shared a truly ethereal photo of herself showing off her growing baby bump. She shared the photo with the caption reading, ‚Äúüå∏ Baby Moon film from our favorite place on earth‚Ä¶.Big Sur üå∏‚Äù\n\nShe also added who took the photo, saying, ‚Äúüì∑ @auhasardspr,‚Äù which is her husband, director Stephen Ringer.\n\nYou can see the photo HERE!\n\nIn the photo, we see Michalka looking so radiant as she poses in front of a white flower bush that overlooks the ocean. Along with the sun shining on her dewy skin and brown locks, we see her cradling her growing baby bump while donning a floral kimono.\n\nTruly, she is giving all the mother nature vibes, and looks like something out of a fairytale. To say we‚Äôre obsessed would be an understatement.\n\nFor those who don‚Äôt know, Michalka and Ringer have been together since 2013 after meeting on the set of Sequoia. They got married in 2015 in Italy, and fast forward to Jan 2024, they announced that they were expecting their first child together. (And she‚Äôs reportedly due in May 2024!)\n\nMichalka previously wrote on Instagram that she and Ringer are going to wait until she gives birth to find out their baby‚Äôs gender. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre waiting to find out the gender cuz I‚Äôve always loved a good surprise, but in the meantime, we‚Äôve been busy getting the nursery ready, meeting with my birth team, eating more protein than usual, going to Pilates, getting good sleep, and drinking lots of water,‚Äù she said."
