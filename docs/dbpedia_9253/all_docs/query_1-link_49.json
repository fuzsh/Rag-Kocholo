        "text": "You’d think that given PopWrap’s pop culture preferences, a CW show about collegiate cheerleaders would be atop my Must List. It wasn’t. For whatever reason, watching pretty young things toss and tumble didn’t appeal to me this time. And then I watched the pilot episode and flipped for this silly, sarcastic and smart-as-hell world, led by Aly Michalka.\n\nThe irony is both “Hellcats” and Aly find themselves fighting off stereotypes every day — “oh it’s that tween musician on the dumb cheerleading show.” But to hear her tell it, Aly doesn’t mind detonating misconceptions on a daily basis. In fact, she loves watching the light click on in people’s eyes when the realize she, and the show, are the real deal.\n\nPopWrap: First off, I just saw “Easy A” and loved it.\n\nAly Michalka: Oh thanks, I loved working on that movie. And Rhiannon is such a lovable character but so out of control – you can’t help but want to reign her in. I really fought for that part and definitely had to go in there to prove myself when it came to playing such a forward character.\n\nPW: Do you find that most of your audition time is spent changing people’s perception of you?\n\nAly: [laughs] Yea, it’s so funny having to break stereotypes in a way that’s graceful and not forced. AJ and I found that by changing our band name and taking the time that was needed to grow up and progress in a very natural way. Leaving our record company was a huge thing for us, now we have the freedom to make adult music but we also wanted to focus on acting, which is what we did for the last few years. Now we’ve been given such a great opportunity to segue our music onto “Hellcats” — that is a great thing for us as a band.\n\nPW: It also seems like the show is in the same boat, having to change people’s perceptions.\n\nAly: As a show we definitely also have stereotypes to overcome. People assume it’s just a cheerleading show and you can ogle girls in skirts. It’s so much more than that. It’s about real characters, and seeing how Marti progresses and changes as a person through this ordeal.\n\nPW: What initially attracted you to it?\n\nAly: It’s funny because I didn’t even originally read the script. It was called “Cheer” and I thought “what the hell? I’m not doing that!” [laughs] I called my agent, who I love, but was like, “dude, what is going on here? You know I am fighting stereotypes!” I don’t want to be the pretty, preppy girl that most people see me as. Then I sat down and was literally shocked at how good the script was.\n\nPW: Was Marti a no-brainer for you?\n\nAly: I really wanted to be Marti, I was immediately attracted to her spirit, her sarcasm and the fact she was this little fighter. But I assumed the studio would want me as Savannah because in the script she’s a blonde, preppy Texas cheerleader. Thankfully they saw me for Marti.\n\nPW: And with a show that has so much dancing and cheering, I’d imagine auditioning is about way more than acting.\n\nAly: It’s funny because they kind of downplayed the dancing in the beginning. “Oh no, just go in there and move around. They just want to see you dance a bit.” But I knew better, which is good because I had to do a full on dance. Which is ok, I used to be on a competitive dance squad, so I can pick up choreography pretty easily. It was terrible though because I was sick for the audition, so I’m coughing throughout and thinking, “oh man, they must think I’m out of shape.” One of those crazy self-conscious things that happens when you really want something.\n\nPW: How much of what we see on screen is actually you?\n\nAly: Dance-wise, that’s me. Tumbling, I can’t do that. I think people forget that it’s not really normal to flip around in the air, so I let the people who’ve been training since 5-years-old do that [laughs]. I have done some basket tosses, because I thought it looked awesome – but I have an amazing stunt double. She’s incredible.\n\nPW: For people who loved the first episode, where does it go from here?\n\nAly: Let me tell you, the second episode is so much better than the first – it’s killer. So fun and the dancing in that one is amazing. We don’t have a ton of time, we’re learning these routines in a day! Sometimes the night before we film we’re given three hours to rehearse. But that brings about an element of excitement, which is great because it gives us, as actors, that anxious energy a real team would.\n\nPW: The first episode ended with Marti’s mom surprising her at Regionals — I’m guessing that doesn’t end well.\n\nAly: You’ll really see where their relationship is heading [tonight]. There’s a lot of great between Marti & Wanda, but a lot of damage has been done because she’s wasn’t really a mother. She’s gotta pick it up. The relationship between Marti and Savannah slowly grows and they honestly become friends. You’ll also see the struggle Marti goes through when it comes to her feelings for Dan versus her feelings for Lucas.\n\nPW: What about your sister, think she’ll pop up on the show at some point?\n\nAly: I do. I think AJ will definitely be on the show for sure — they’re game, she’s game, she’ll be there. I can’t wait to see what the storyline there will be.\n\nPW: Who would you like her to play?\n\nAly: I think we would definitely have to be related – cousins or something. Plus I think it would be great for Marti to have this surprise relative since so much has been kept from her. I think it could be very believable to not know she has a relative somewhere out there. Like, “seriously mom, are you kidding?!?”\n\n“Hellcats” airs Wednesdays at 9pm on The CW\n\nPhoto: The CW"
