Amanda Joy "AJ" Michalka is an American actress, model, and musician who was born in Torrance, California. She is the younger sister of actress and singer Aly Michalka (IZombie, Hellcats, Cowbelles, Phil of the Future, etc.) and is best known as one half of the duo Aly & Aj. They have performed many songs, and one of their most popular ones is "Potential Breakup Song". She also voiced Stevonnie, a fusion character, in the show Steven Universe.

In She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, she voices Catra. It is due to AJ's serious portrayal of Catra that she has been written and depicted as she has. Executive producer ND Stevenson said that though they'd always planned to give Catra a tragic arc, they'd originally imagined a more comical version of the catgirl than we know today. They had planned a reoccurring joke of sorts that would've diminished the more stern aspects of Catra's personality.

“We were going to make so many cat puns," showrunner ND Stevenson says. "She sleeps under a refrigerator. They’re going to spray her with water bottles and stuff. You know, cat jokes and stuff.”

However, Stevenson credits AJ with the reason he began to see Catra in a different light, as less of a character to joke about and more of a character to sympathize with.

"AJ just brought such empathy to her," Stevenson says. "We just really started writing the character to play to AJ’s strengths.” By this, he means that after discovering the power and heart AJ brought to Catra, the writers began to give Catra more dramatic material and veered away from the cat jokes.
