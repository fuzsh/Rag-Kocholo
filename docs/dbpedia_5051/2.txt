The MGWR Class L/Lm/Ln were Midland Great Western Railway (MGWR) 0-6-0 locomotives.. Following merger of the MGWR into the Great Southern Railways (GSR) in 1925 these locomotives still generally kept to their former area, as did the equivalent GS&WR Class 101 standard goods to their former area. Whereas Class 101 was noted for some working of branch line passenger trains this was less likely for the MGWR class L; however they were noted for passenger mixed working on the Clifden and Ballaghaderreen branch lines.

The Santa Cruz Railroad no. 3 is a narrow gauge steam locomotive in Washington D.C.. It is one of three preserved Baldwin Class 8/18 C 4-4-0 locomotives in the United States, the other two being the North Pacific Coast Railroad no. 12, the "Sonoma" displayed at the California State Railroad Museum, and the Eureka and Palisade Railroad no. 4, the "Eureka" which is privately owned, the latter of which it is the only operable example. It was common practice for American railroads of the 19th century to name their engines after Jupiter, "King of Gods", and other mythological figures to attract attention, thus the engine should not be confused with the engine of Golden Spike fame.
