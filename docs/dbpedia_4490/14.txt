Formed in San Francisco in the spring of 2006, The Union Trade consists of Don Joslin (guitar), Nate Munger (bass/vocals), Eric Salk (guitar /vocals), and Dan Rodkewich (drums). The Union Trade’s sound is the product of a collaborative writing style and mind-set, largely free of the barriers of role or instrument, that relies heavily on experimentation and reflection to find the feel of each song.

In early 2007, The Union Trade’s debut release, Now The Swell (Tricycle), offered the first concrete proof of the band’s potential. What began as just a demo, evolved into a full scale EP that put the band on the radar in San Francisco’s indie scene, and in the ears of national press. A snapshot of the band finding its sound, Now The Swell earned The Union Trade early accolades for its tight, emotional, and confident take on the post-rock genre.

With their first full-length release, Everyday Including (Tricycle), The Union Trade have bridged the gap between their instrumental-band inspirations, and a more vocals focused indie rock sound. This accomplished and cinematic album explores both sonic and human emotion as The Union Trade move in sweeping lines from dark and delicate beauty to soaring, triumphant peaks. Heavy, distorted guitars awash in delay are lifted by driving rhythms to create expansive melodies and lush textures anchored by the spare, evocative lyrics that narrate these songs with scenes of struggle and hope.

The Union Trade's new album "Everyday Including" will be out August 5th 2008 on Tricycle Records. (CD/Digital)
