The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m. in Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Lisa Murkowski, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA The Chairman. Good morning, everyone. The Committee will come to order. We are meeting this morning to consider opening a very small portion of Alaska's 1002 Area to responsible energy development to meet the $1 billion budget reconciliation instruction that our Committee received last week. The 1002 Area covers 1.57 million acres of land in northeast Alaska within the non-wilderness portion--will you bring it over here, Sean?--of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), and I think it is important to put this in context in terms of the areas that we are talking about. ANWR itself is 19 million acres--approximately the size of South Carolina. The non-wilderness area, this 1002 Area, is 1.5 million acres--approximately the size of Delaware. The area here is designated as wilderness, federal wilderness, 8 million acres there. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] The Chairman. So when we are talking about ANWR itself, I think it is important to recognize that there are parts of ANWR that are designated as wilderness, and there are parts of ANWR, the 1002 Area, that have been specifically designated for consideration for oil and gas exploration. So again, I want to be clear--the 1002 Area is not federal wilderness. Congress recognized the value of ANWR when it designated more than seven million acres as the Mollie Beattie Wilderness--this area here. That is an area that is protected and will not, and cannot, be touched. The Coastal Plain, again, is separate from the wilderness in ANWR. It is about the size of Delaware, again, in a refuge the size of the State of South Carolina. So again, the areas that we are talking about are significant, and what Alaskans are asking for is to develop just 2,000 federal acres within it, about one ten-thousandth of ANWR. We should also understand that if we open the 1002 Area, the economic benefits will be substantial, our national security will be strengthened, and the environmental impacts will be minimal. For starters, we will create thousands of new jobs and those jobs will pay the types of wages that support families and put our kids through colleges. We will also generate substantial revenue for every level of government, tens of billions of dollars over the life of the fields. Now there has been some discussion out there as to whether or not we can meet our $1 billion instruction. The answer to that is a simple yes. And I would remind the Committee that the first 10 years are just the start. This is the smallest part here, of a 40-year period where responsible production raises billions of dollars in revenues for our country every year. The Congressional Research Service has estimated that the Federal treasury could, depending on oil prices and the amount of resources that are ultimately produced--and we all put that in a caveat there--but it could raise anywhere from $48.3 billion on the low end to $296.8 billion over 30 years. And bear in mind, that is new wealth and prosperity. New wealth. It will not be created, not redirected or repurposed like so much of what we deal with. Those revenues will directly reduce our debt, while simultaneously creating the growth conditions needed to reduce it on a greater scale. Opening the 1002 Area will help to keep energy affordable. Here in the Lower 48 we have somewhat forgotten what it feels like to pay $4.00 for a gallon of gasoline. Prices are moderate right now, we recognize that, but we also know they do not necessarily stay that way. So we need to be taking steps to plan for the long-term and we need to do that now, not in 10 years, to keep energy prices affordable. A number of experts are already pointing to the warning signs. The International Energy Agency (IEA) found that, ``Global oil supply could struggle to keep pace with demand after 2020, risking a sharp increase in prices, unless new projects are approved soon.'' Now some are going to argue that we are doing just fine, we are producing more, we are even exporting some, so we can turn our attention to other matters. But I think that that is a mistake. We are projected to remain a significant net importer well into the future. And setting aside some of the shorter-term concerns that I have just mentioned, even the more cautious forecast from the EIA, the Energy Information Administration, projects that oil prices will be back above $100 per barrel by the year 2040. I think it is also misleading to suggest that all of the benefits of opening the 1002 Area will happen all at once or all in the near-term. We know that is not true. We will see the benefit for decades, not just over the ten-year budget window. We talk a lot about where we were back in 1995, when the Congress had passed ANWR and President Clinton at that time vetoed the effort to open the 1002 Area. 1995. Think about where we would have been had that action not taken place. We would not have seen as dramatic a run-up in oil prices in the mid-2000s. States like California would not be importing so much of their oil from abroad, but that is exactly what has happened as supply from Alaska has declined. There is no question that opening the 1002 Area is important for our state and our national economy. And we can be just as confident that the new technologies that are in place and are still coming online will ensure that responsible development does not harm the environment. Between the 1970s and today, the surface footprint of Arctic development has decreased by about 80 percent and several of our witnesses this morning will speak directly to that. But put in context, what was once a 65-acre pad now takes about 12 acres or less. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] The Chairman. Then, below ground, the extended reach drilling from a single pad will grow to an area of 125 square miles by 2020. So just in a few years here, and again, we will have Mr. Schutt speak to that, but that is an increase of more than 4,000 percent since we began oil exploration and production in the 1970s. Now development in the Arctic has always raised concerns about wildlife and the environment, and appropriately so. But I would remind everyone here this morning, because Alaskans have been so careful with development, fears of impacts to our wildlife and our land have repeatedly been proven wrong. Most of our roads are now built from ice and melt in the summertime, leaving no impact on the tundra. Developers follow thousands of regulatory requirements, best practices, and mitigation measures. We inventory and we assess wildlife and we study their habitat so that we avoid any sensitive places. We always talk about the caribou. The Central Arctic Caribou herd, which lives year-round in and around Prudhoe Bay, increased from 3,000 animals in 1969, just prior to development, to 5,000 when development began in earnest in 1974 and was at about 22,000 animals just this last year. It is now more than seven times larger than when development began. Now it also may surprise some to learn that we are developing energy just outside of ANWR, at Point Thomson, a point that my colleague Senator Sullivan knows very, very well, but this is located on state land just two miles from the border of the 1002 Area. That project at Point Thomson is being carried out responsibly. It is not harming the wildlife that cross the invisible western boundary of that Refuge, again, defying the claims we hear about possible harm. For over 40 years now Alaskans have repeatedly proven that we can develop safely and responsibly and development in the 1002 Area will be no different. We will not harm the caribou who move through the area; we will not harm the polar bears, whose dens can be protected; the snow geese, whose nesting areas can be safeguarded; or, any of the other birds and wildlife that visit the Coastal Plain in the summer. We are sensitive to the habitat in the region and care for it, and Alaskans understand this. This is why more than 70 percent of us have supported opening the 1002 Area to responsible development. We are also acutely aware that our state needs this, and we will hear this from our Governor. Right now we have the highest unemployment rate in the country, we have massive budget deficits that are projected to last for quite a while, and our Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, the economic backbone of our state, is just one-quarter full. We know full well that opening the 1002 Area is not an immediate cure. But we also know that it is something that we have to do today, because the benefits of development will take time to be fully realized. It is like the old saying, we say it a lot around here, ``The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.'' We need to take that first step today so that we can realize the benefits going forward. I was born in Alaska. My husband and I have raised our boys there and I hope that they lead long and healthy lives in a place that is so beautiful and so gorgeous that it sometimes takes your breath away. What I know is that no one cares more for Alaska than those of us who live and work and raise our families there. We love our state. We respect the land. We would never risk its future for the sake of development. But we also realize that is not the case here. The 1002 Area was created by a Congressional compromise. We always knew its future would require another one, and today Alaskans are offering just that. We are not asking to develop all of the 1002 Area, but instead we are asking for 2,000 acres, or about one ten-thousandth of the Refuge. We have waited nearly 40 years for the right technologies to come along so that the footprint of development is small enough to ensure that the environment continues to be respected and will not be harmed. This is not a choice between energy and the environment. We are past that. What we have today is a great lineup of witnesses to help our Committee understand that. We have our entire Alaska delegation with us, our Governor, our Congressman, our Senator, we have our Lieutenant Governor, and we have a number of Alaskans who actually live up on the North Slope. I thank all of our witnesses for being here this morning. I look forward to an excellent and informative hearing. Senator Cantwell, I turn to you and welcome your remarks. STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I welcome the Governor and our colleagues to today's discussion. But I should start this by saying this hearing is a great departure from the strong, working relationship that Senator Murkowski and I have set to work together on an energy agenda that will move our country forward. It is too bad that we are not using our resources this morning to force our House colleagues to reconsider the very important bill that included over 100 different priorities to move our country forward on everything from cybersecurity to energy efficiency. I also do not support the makeup of today's panels and the fact that our two colleagues who do not support opening up the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, who have carried the bill this legislative session and last legislative session, Senator Markey and Senator Bennet, were not allowed to be part of this panel. I also believe that we should have had more witnesses from Indian Country that represent not just the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Corporations. Yes, corporations are charged with economic development, but individual tribal members as we have seen throughout Alaska and throughout the United States of America do not support this kind of development because they believe in the wildlife nature that God has given us, and that we are stewards of Mother Earth. So I thank them for that. I thank them for their strong spiritual beliefs--thank you. We are here today because someone has come up with a ludicrous idea that we can pass a tax reform bill that raises the deficit, increases our taxes, and that we will take a sliver out of a wildlife refuge to do it. I almost want to call this ``Caribou for Millionaires'' because it is the most ridiculous idea I have ever heard as it relates to meeting the tax reform agenda. So no, I do not like the setup of these three panels. I am always glad to hear from the Governor and I am always glad to hear from our colleagues, but our other colleagues should have had their voices heard and Indian Country should have been better represented. We have no bill before us today. We have no bill and there is a proposed markup for next Wednesday. When will we see that language? When will we have any idea about this process? I am disturbed and I could go in a direction of saying that we don't have to worry because some of the press reports are, from Bloomberg News and others, that ``The Coastal Arctic Refuge does not have any promising oil-bearing rock formations,'' a former BP petroleum analyst said, ``There is not great interest in developing the Arctic Wildlife Refuge,'' and ``There are safer bets.'' So one could have the attitude that there are, particularly with the Trump Administration's desire--I am not sure where in the United States of America they do not want to drill. But with their 1.7 billion acres they want on the Outer Continental Shelf and many other places in America, I find it hard to believe that there will be the economic incentive to drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. But why put a big X on top of something that has been so unique to the United States of America? When I recently researched why we got to this point and heard some of the first people that made their case to the Eisenhower Administration, quoting from their reports, ``We all knew that it must be preserved as an original fragment of our past. The last opportunity to protect part of this continent as it once was.'' Why? Because as other people said, ``It was a spiritual place, an Arctic Wildlife Refuge.'' The fact that they also said it was an area that had been left undisturbed by man, that it was the last laboratory in which plants, animals and where they live, as they have always lived, is preserved. So this is why we got to this point, and this is what is unique about it, and this is why, from the Eisenhower Administration to today, we have fought to protect it. Is Alaska's economy a great concern to us as a nation? Yes. Do we in the Pacific Northwest--I think one of the first things I said to the Chairwoman when we started a discussion is, let's talk about why the natural gas pipeline in Alaska hasn't been built because it has a bigger economic impact than this. So there are issues in which we need to be mindful about the energy economy moving forward, but this idea is not new and it is not better. There is nothing that has changed here. There is no new science that says we do not have to worry about this wildlife and there is no new science that says that the oil development will take up a smaller footprint. This map that we will get to everyone basically shows that the development will take up a significant portion of the Refuge, the 800-mile-long Trans-Alaska Pipeline, 219 miles of power transmission lines and so on and so forth. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Senator Cantwell. So the notion that wildlife can exist in this unique environment in the same way with this development is just wrong. I look forward to hearing from Secretary Perry on this, because I sent him a letter yesterday asking him how they can exist together. We will look forward to seeing how he answers that. I also point out that the uniqueness of this area has led to an international agreement. The caribou population is so unique, so specific, and so special that we have entered into an agreement with Canada on it. That is because they want to protect this population of caribou as well. The notion that we should move forward on a wrongheaded idea because all of a sudden people want some revenue for a tax bill and move forward today on something when we don't even know what we are moving forward on in language, is just not the way I think we should be proceeding. I hope that we will have a chance, our colleagues, to ask our witnesses questions about this, but be assured that even though we do not agree with this process or the process of trying to get 51 votes to change the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we are never stopping. We are never stopping in trying to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and its uniqueness and working with the indigenous people who also support that idea. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cantwell. We have several panels this morning and I appreciate not only our delegation being here but all the Alaskans and the visitors that have joined us this morning. A very distinguished panel will be led off by our colleague here, Senator Sullivan. He will be followed by the Congressman for all Alaska, Congressman Young, who has represented us in the House of Representatives for 45 years, going on 46. And the panel will be rounded out by our Governor. Governor Walker has been in office now for three years, is a life-long resident and has great leadership. I appreciate you being here as well, Governor. Senator King. Senator King. And an Independent, Senator. The Chairman. That is true. He is an Independent. Okay, we do not talk about the political affiliations here of anybody-- -- [Laughter.] ----but that is noted for the record. Senator Sullivan, if you would like to lead off with the welcome, please. STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA Senator Sullivan. Well, thank you, Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Cantwell, all of my colleagues, for the opportunity to say a few words on this very important issue for our country. Now many in this room have claimed to be protectors of Alaska's environment. But with all due respect to my colleagues here today, there are three people in Congress who care more about Alaska's environment than anyone else in the entire body: Senator Murkowski, Congressman Young, and myself. The fundamental disconnect in the discussion of the 1002 Area is that the debate has not kept up with Alaska's high standards, the highest in the world, and I'll talk about that and advancements in technology. So with all due respect to the Ranking Member, a lot has changed, a lot has changed. Responsibly developing the 1002 Area is truly a win-win-win for our country: it will create jobs, it will help grow the economy, increase energy security for Americans and, very importantly, it will help protect the global environment and strengthen our national security. It is these last two points I would like to emphasize in my remarks this morning. Madam Chair, as you know, Alaska has the highest environmental standards regarding responsible Arctic resource development of any place in the world. I was in charge of these standards as Alaska's Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources, and I can tell you, whether it is what we call ``no impact'' exploration or specific requirements related to our incredible species like the polar bear or caribou, or mandating use of the best available technology, we have a 50-year record of responsible resource development in our state. Let me just give you one example of ``no impact'' exploration. As the Chair noted, on the North Slope of Alaska we only allow for exploration activities during the winter months. Companies are required to build ice roads across the tundra, ice pads where they put their equipment and drill rigs, and you can see examples in some of the slides I've provided, and they have to leave before the winter ends. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Senator Sullivan. The ice pads and roads literally melt and have zero impact on the tundra. The only thing left is a small capped well and that is just one example of Alaska's very high, mandated standards. As the Chair pointed out, we have used these standards, very recently, in the past four years on the Coastal Plain in the same ecosystem of the 1002 Area that is being debated right now with the development of the Point Thomson project. There is a slide that you can take a look at. See how close that is to the 1002 Area. There was literally minimal impact or no impact on the environment and wildlife. The footprint, as you can see from the slides, is very, very small and it is producing energy right now. Madam Chair, here is the big issue that those in Congress who want to shut down resource development in Alaska never acknowledge. When you disallow investment in Alaska, the place with the highest standards on the environment in the world, you do not end up protecting the global environment. What you do is you end up driving capital and investment to jurisdictions with much less environmental standards or, in some cases, no environmental standards--countries like Nigeria and Venezuela and Iran and Russia, many of which are also our geo-political foes. This brings me to my second point, producing more energy responsibly--oil, natural gas, renewables--and making the United States, again, the world's energy superpower will dramatically strengthen our national security. As some of you know, I served in the Marine Corps for 24 years. I have also served as a U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, whose portfolio included energy security issues, global energy security issues, and I have seen how energy can be used as a tool for good, productive diplomacy but also can be used for troublesome power grabs by our nation's foes. We do not have to import energy. When we do not have to import energy from countries that do not like us or, better yet, when we can export American energy to our allies like Japan or Korea or even to countries like China, this helps our national security and foreign policy. I sit on the Armed Services Committee, and we have heard from military and civilian leaders from our country, Democrats and Republicans, from Secretary Ash Carter to Secretary Mattis, consistently state that producing more energy strengthens our national security. And I know my friends, Senator King and Senator Hirono, have heard these comments consistently on the Armed Services Committee as well. But it is not just American officials who recognize this, the Russians know this as well. Madam Chair, I would like to submit for the record a recent New York Times article, just from a few days ago, October 29, titled, ``Russia Uses Its Oil Giant, Rosneft, as a Foreign Policy Tool.'' The Chairman. We will include that as part of the record. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Senator Sullivan. The first sentence of that story reads, ``Russia is increasingly wielding oil as a geopolitical tool spreading its influence around the world and challenging the interests of the United States.'' Let me end with an anecdote of a meeting I was just in last year at the Halifax International Security Forum with Senator McCain. We were meeting with a senior level, Russian dissident and we asked him at the end of the meeting, ``What more can we do as a country to push back against the Putin regime?'' He looked at us and said, ``The number one thing you can do, the number one thing you can do, is produce more American energy.'' Opening the 1002 Area using the highest environmental standards in the world and the most advanced technology will produce more American energy for the betterment of our country. Thank you, Madam Chair. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Sullivan. Congressman Young, you have been through a few ANWR debates. We welcome your comments this morning. STATEMENT OF HON. DON YOUNG, U.S. CONGRESSMAN FROM ALASKA Representative Young. Are you sure of that? Madam Chair, thank you for having this hearing, and Ranking Member Cantwell and the rest of the members of the Senate, I don't feel too comfortable on the Senate side. I need a flashlight most of the time because sometimes it's pretty dark over here. I am one of the few people, there's only one left in the Congress, that went through this battle 45 years ago, actually 42 years ago. Now this 1002 Area, I have to go through the history of it, was created by Senator Jackson, Senator Magnuson, and Senator Stevens when the Senators were really knowledgeable about what goes on. We recognized this area at that time and about the valuable oil and why we had the 1002 Area. As you mentioned, I believe the ANWR is about 19 million acres of land. The 1002 footprint will probably be--I can't really say what size it is. But I represent Alaska. [Inks a dot on his nose.] You see anything different with my nose right now? This is--I am Alaska--one tenth of one tenth a percent that we're talking about disturbance. The map that the Ranking Member showed was actually drawn up by the Sierra Club. That bothers me. That's old information. This little dot on my nose, I weigh 225 pounds, and this little dot is what we're talking about, the 1002 Area. It has the potential of probably around--early estimates were 10 billion barrels, now the estimates are probably around 20 billion barrels of oil. Senator Sullivan brought it up, this is an issue of national security, national security. It is the one weapon Russia is wielding. We can have the security for the nation as a whole. And I was interested to hear about the caribou. You're going to hear a lot of nonsense stories later on in the day. Interested in Canada? The Ambassador sent out a letter about it opposing ANWR. Did we say anything when they drilled 270 wells right in the area for the caribou? Two hundred seventy wells were drilled in this caribou herd's area where they cross every year. They built a 400-mile road right across the caribou area too. Did we say anything then? This is not about--it's not about the environment or the caribou, it's about economics. I'm ashamed of Canada right now because they're wielding an emotional issue that most people don't know what they're talking about nor have they been there, nor seen it, or understand the caribou herd. That's one thing that bothers me probably the most of all about the legislative process. What used to be, as I mentioned, Warren Magnuson and Senator Jackson worked together, when the states were affected we didn't get involved in the shipyards and certain members' districts about how they were mis- manufacturing a ship. We didn't do that. But we have people going and saying this is a great environmental area. Maybe I'll find out how many of you have gone up there from the Senate side. But let's think about national security. I run every two years--I'm not one of you guys, every six years--and I've supported this and fought for it 13 times. Thirteen times I've moved it out of the House and it has died on the Senate side, all but once, and President Clinton vetoed it because he said it wouldn't relieve the embargo we had that quickly. But think about that a moment. If we are to be energy sufficient, to control the international incidences that can be faced, we need ANWR. The Congress recognized it when we passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). Scoop Jackson, Warren Magnuson, Mo Udall, and John Seiberling all agreed to this provision because they knew the value of that oil and the value to this nation. Now we're fighting the same battle again because of the ignorance and misinformation from those that wouldst not have any resources developed at all, not only in Alaska, we're easy to pick on because of the three-person delegation, but the nation as a whole to make us less strong, to make us a second- rate nation. That's what a lot of you wish to do. Now, as a House member, I'm going to pass this again and I hope you have the courage to do what's right for this nation-- what's good for Alaska, what's good for the nation, and good for all the people in the future. Madam Chairman, I do thank you for having this hearing. And I will remember and remind you, look at that little blue dot on my nose. That is the 1002 Area. I don't think it changed my appearance very much because the Coastal Plain is not that pristine area you see in the propaganda that's purveyed by all the environmental groups. It's a flat terrain that, in fact, was set aside by this Congress and the Washington Senators for the development, not the preservation. I yield. The Chairman. Thank you, Congressman. Thank you for being here. Governor Walker, welcome. STATEMENT OF HON. BILL WALKER, GOVERNOR, STATE OF ALASKA Governor Walker. Good morning, Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Cantwell. Thank you for this opportunity to speak today. I am the Governor of Alaska. I am non-partisan. I am--I have a goal as the Governor that future generations will be able to have the same benefits growing up in Alaska that I had growing up in Alaska. Born in the territory--Lieutenant Governor Mallott, also born in the territory--we've seen many changes in our state and many for the good. Alaska is different. Resource development is in our DNA. We've done that long before statehood. We'll continue to do that. That's how we earn--it was 90 percent of our income--now 70 percent of our income from resource development. We've done it for a long time. We do it right. We're careful in what we do. We're very vigilant of the environment. I remember well when we became a state. It was a day we celebrated. We made a--the deal we made was the Statehood Compact that said that Alaska, we cannot sell the resources in the ground. We have to live off of them. We have to live off the royalties of them. That's how we fund our state. That was the deal then. We accepted that deal. But what we didn't understand and didn't realize is that we may not be able to have access to resources responsibly developed, to live off those resources. That was the deal. All I'm asking for is that we get the deal that we made in 1959 under the Statehood Compact. The great compromise that was made under ANILCA was that the 1002 was set aside for future development. That's what the deal was. All we're asking for is the benefit of the deal that was made long ago. This has become something that I have lived with as an Alaskan resident all my life, and now I'm dealing with it as the Governor of Alaska in many ways which I'll get to. The Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. The only thing wrong with the oil pipeline is it's three-quarters empty. Three-quarters empty sitting next to, miles away, from the most prolific area of hydrocarbons you can imagine, ten billion barrels. You know, this is not about money. This is not about who gets what money in Alaska. This is about a future. This is about an economy. This is about the young people that want a decent education. I want to thank the Committee members that came into a field hearing in Bethel and went on to a location in Oscarville. You saw a part of Alaska that many have not seen, and I thank you very much for doing that. I'm a big believer in seeing first-hand what Alaska looks like. We are a vast state, as we all know. We have, we own, as the State of Alaska, 242 airports. The reason we do that is because 80 percent of our communities do not have roads. When we talk about infrastructure, upgrading infrastructure, we don't have enough infrastructure to upgrade. You know, I sat in a listening circle in Utqiagvik a few years back and one of the elders said to me, he said--I was not Governor--he said, ``Mr. Walker, my goal as a grandfather is to see one of my grandchildren flush a toilet in their village.'' The infrastructure that we need needs to be paid for out of the, with the resources. That was the deal we made with Congress when we became a state. We need the benefits of that bargain, and we need it now. As I came into office it was a $1.6 billion deficit that quickly drew to $3.7 billion deficit per year. I've had to do things I hope no future Governor ever has to do. We've had to make some very, very difficult decisions. I've had to say no to some very good requests for help for funding. We have had to close facilities across the state, lay off thousands of people. We have reduced the budget by $1.7 billion. That's a tough thing to do in a couple years. That hurts. Public safety. Alaskans don't feel safe right now, because we've gone too far in that direction. We're having a special session, right now as we speak, to bring that safety back. I signed recently, earlier this week, a climate change administrative order. We have stood up a climate change team. You know, we address both in Alaska. We are looking at climate change. Climate change has impacted Alaska. There's no question about it. We're looking at having to relocate as many as 12 of our villages. I've been to Kivalina. I've seen that island becoming a smaller island, but we cannot do it without the resources, the financial resources to do it. I don't see it coming from Washington to relocate 12 villages. So we need to look at how can we bring in the revenue. The only way we can do it is to live off our resources. Alaska is unique that the beauty above ground is unparalleled. The beauty below the ground is unparalleled as well. The beauty below the ground is our resources that we need to develop responsibly. As a Governor, I can tell you that the support in the Alaska legislature has been 90 percent. Last year was the last resolution passed, 90 percent in support of this. Please, please, let us develop our resources responsibly so we can fund our state. We can make Alaskans feel safe. We can fund our education, fund our health services. Our health services are the highest in the nation by multiples. Please let us have the benefit of the bargain that we made in 1959 with this body. Thank you very much for your time today. [The prepared statement of Governor Walker follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] The Chairman. Governor, Senator, Congressman, thank you for, not only your testimony here this morning, but putting it into perspective from a historical perspective, from a defense perspective, from a resource perspective. It adds great value to the conversation, and we certainly appreciate it. I know, Congressman, it is a long way over to the House side, so we will let you get back as we move to our second panel, but I want to thank each of you. Senator Cantwell. Madam Chair, could I---- Representative Young. Thank you, Madam Chair, but I'm glad to see so many of my colleagues up there on this side, all served with me. The Chairman. It is not so bad on the Senate side. Representative Young. Everybody but Abraham Lincoln served with me---- [Laughter.] Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator Cantwell. Madam Chair, could I ask the Governor a quick question? The Chairman. We were not prepared to do questions, but if it is very quick, I think we can get to it. Senator Cantwell. We don't get a chance to talk to him that often and certainly appreciate chances that we do. The Chairman. Certainly. Senator Cantwell. Part of this idea is traveling with a package of legislation moving through the House that gets rid of our local sales deductions. Washington and Alaska are unique in that we don't have an income tax and we get to deduct. Are you supportive of that concept? In addition, there are some who thought that they would package this legislation up with another try at health care where they would go back to block granting Medicaid. Are you supportive of those concepts as part of a package just to get ANWR opened up? Governor Walker. Senator Cantwell, I have certainly looked at the package and I will evaluate the package in its entirety. I've not been through it as thorough as I'd like to because I've been getting ready for this hearing today, obviously. You know, we look at that as us, as a part of that, part of the solution on the deficit, revenues from Alaska because the royalties will be shared equally between the Federal Government and the State of Alaska. So we see that, certainly, as if there's interest in reducing the federal deficit, I'm certainly interested in reducing the state deficit. That's what my focus is today. Senator Cantwell. Well, I would--we will get you information, but our analysis is that Alaskans will pay about a $1,100 to $1,400 tax increase and individuals a $900 increase under that sales tax deduction idea. I think it is a bad idea for our state and your state and, certainly, I hope no one around here takes the bait on block granting Medicaid just to open up ANWR. Thank you for being here, Governor. Governor Walker. We will do all we can to open up ANWR. Thank you. Senator Cassidy. Madam Chair, just for point of fact. The Chairman. Senator Cassidy. Senator Cassidy. Health care reform is not part of this. Block granting Medicaid is not part of this. It can be a disinformation campaign put out there to obscure the truth. We will come back to health care reform, but that should not be spoken of here as if it is germane to the argument. That is misleading to the American people. The Chairman. We do have somewhat limited jurisdiction here in the Energy Committee. Our instruction is to find $1 billion, and as we mentioned repeatedly, we have that opportunity within the 1002 Area of Alaska. Governor, Senator, Congressman, thank you for being here this morning. Let's call up the second panel, please. As you are getting seated, I will provide brief introductions. We have heard from our Governor, Governor Walker. His Lieutenant Governor and partner is our Lieutenant Governor, Byron Mallott. The Lieutenant Governor is a leader of great renown in our state, an Alaskan Native leader hailing from Yakutat, and has had an opportunity to appear before our Committee on numerous occasions. We welcome him back. His testimony will be followed by Mr. Greg Sheehan. Greg is the Principal Deputy Director for the Fish and Wildlife Service at the Department of the Interior. It is good to have you before the Committee. Mr. Samuel Alexander has joined us, and we welcome him as a Tribal Member from the Gwich'in Tribal Government. Thank you for being here this morning and traveling such a long distance. Mr. Matthew Rexford is the Tribal Administrator in the Native Village of Kaktovik, the one community, the one village within the 1002 Area. It is good to have you here, Matthew. Lieutenant Governor, if you would like to lead off this morning. We have asked you to try to limit your comments to about five minutes. Your full statements will be incorporated as part of the record. After the conclusion of your testimony, we will have an opportunity to ask specific questions of each of you. Lieutenant Governor, thank you again for traveling the long distance and, again, for being before the Committee. Welcome. STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON MALLOTT, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, STATE OF ALASKA Lieutenant Governor Mallott. Thank you, Madam Chairman, Ranking Member Cantwell, members of the Committee. The statement of Governor Walker in the record details the reasons, clearly, that the State of Alaska supports the issue before the Committee: that the need for development is clear, that the need for the revenue is clear, that the availability of revenue should development take place, will be real. I want to focus my remarks, briefly, on the history of, as also has been spoken to, the ANWR issue. I was here as a young staffer during the development of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), ANILCA, and ultimately the federal classifications in Alaska flowed from ANCSA. In section (d)(2) of that Act there were bargains made that were made very clear to Alaska which from time to time I had the opportunity to help develop and which, in practice, I saw go away. In my home village of Yakutat, I saw preserve areas created in the St. Elias National Park in which we were promised, as Native residents, as Native subsistence users, as folks who lived in that area for centuries, were promised that we could use that area into the future. They were carved out for that purpose. And I saw camps that my family owned and others in our community used for generations, burned down by the National Park Service, regardless of what had been promised to us by this Congress. I see in ANWR, the 1002 Area being an area in which the Congress made a promise to Alaska and to our country that we would develop those resources should they be able to be done safely, should they meet the market tests, should they be able to be brought to market. We see a complete infrastructure on the North Slope of our state with a pipeline to market. As the Governor said, that is now at only 25 percent of capacity. We see Point Thomson literally on the border of the 1002 Area with the infrastructure to allow the minimal impact in the 1002 Area for exploration and even development made possible without any further significant impact on the environment. We see the ability to deal with our national security requirements which Alaska is very concerned about as we look to certain neighbors of our state, our unique global national security location. We see the need for our people. Alaska is the one state that makes use of our fish and game and plant resources as the highest priority for food security among all the uses of our resources. It's called subsistence. It is our highest public policy use. And as resources become scarce, as they cycle through the life cycles of resources, we make sure that our people who depend on those resources for their livelihood, for their life ways, for food security, are the ones that have the ultimate access to those resources. No other state does that. My wife, my children are Athabascan. They're Koyukon, not Gwich'in, but I came to this office largely on the basis that I have fought for my entire life, the life ways, the desire, the aspirations of Alaska's native peoples and I will continue to do so with every breath that I have. Thank you. [The pre
