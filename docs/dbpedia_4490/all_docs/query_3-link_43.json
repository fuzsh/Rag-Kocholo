        "text": "Changing with the Times\n\nThe Czar's 15th season of games here in cyberspace launches Thursday with the 2021-22 season opener. As with anything over a long period of time, it takes on a life of its own and evolves. Last year brought a ton more video and that's not going away. While I'm hopeful that we'll be able to spend much more time in the gym this season, video expands the amount of teams and games that can be seen. That's all for the better.\n\nVideo is a beautiful thing as you can go back and rewind to see replays and/or to get accurate stats amongst other things. All sports have seen analytics explode over recent years. Its also no secret that I enjoy the number crunching. So its a very natural area for me to dive into in this forum. I've taken a stab at some of those stats with 3 different Four Factors studies over the years. The next progression, with the help of video, was writing up Four Factors data on a game by game basis that you saw last season.\n\nTherefore, its only fitting in this milestone season 15 that there's another evolution. This year I've taken that stats package and put it in the weight room for the entire offseason. So after all of that number crunching, the time is now.\n\nI now present ...Czar Insights!\n\nVisual Game Summary\n\nCzar Insights is my new and expanded visual game summary. I had 2 main ideas when putting this together. The first idea is to be visual. Too often stats are just listing a bunch of numbers and it can hard to see context and relationships between data. I've attempted to put data that can be compared right next to each other for that reason. Color coding and graphs make it easier to draw those conclusions while still showing the meaningful numbers. Many of the display ideas are incorporated from college and/or NBA locations.\n\nThe second idea was to be concise. The balance between displaying too much and too little is always difficult to determine. I tried to keep this in a 1 page like format for simpler viewing. At the same time, I wanted to display as much as possible without there being so much clutter that it took away from the analysis. I think this draws that balance of having everything displayed be valuable but yet easy to find and use.\n\nYes there are no new fancy stats like DARKO or RAPTOR here. I did this for a couple of D3 games this month and you can find all the same data online. But that isn't the point. The idea is to supplement the basic box score with deeper insights in a concise and consolidated visual format for the high school level. I don't know of any other high school writing that provides this level of stats detail or a visual. Look for this on most of the games I write about this season. This will give a deeper and easier view into the different team factors that played into the outcome of the game. For reference, I've included the Czar Insights for each the class AAAA state quarterfinals from the 2020-21 season. Click on the images below to see a bigger picture. Let's breakdown each of the 6 sections displayed.\n\nBreakdown\n\nSection 1: Four Factors\n\nThis is the standard Four Factors data that I tracked last season. The visual has been updated from the chart used last season. If you're not already familiar with the Four Factors, you can read this. Team colors and showing the actual value are used for easier viewing.\n\nSection 2: More Factors\n\nMost shooting values I use are in terms of Effective Field Goal Percentage. That shows the impact of 3s. But there's a place for old fashioned Field Goal Percentage so I show that first. The difference between EFG% and FG% is that EFG% gives extra credit for 3s since a make is worth more. Neither takes into account free throws TS% is True Shooting Percentage which does take into account free throws. This is a newer wave shooting metric.\n\nAST% is the percentage of made shots that were assisted. This can be an indicator of ball movement which can lead to better shots and therefore a high shooting percentage.\n\nSTL% is the percentage of possessions where the team got a steal. Note this differs from TO% in the Four Factors because not every turnover is a steal. Steals are the turnovers that lead to easy points though.\n\nSection 3: Scoring Summary\n\nThis section tracks some commonly used breakdowns of scoring. Unlike the first 2 sections which are all percentages, this section and the next section are all raw totals.\n\n2nd Chance is 2nd chance points. These are points that come after an offensive rebound. These are especially demoralizing points. A low number here but a high ORB% shows a lack of conversion of these opportunities.\n\nPts Off TO is Points Off Turnovers. These are points that come on the possession after an opponents turnover. It doesn't necessarily have to be a live ball turnover or a turnover that turned directly into points. Ex: Team throws the ball out of bounds, set play on the other end for a bucket. Those count as points off turnover. I'm not a fan of that definition but that's how its used so I'll use it here for consistency\n\nPts in Paint is Points in the Paint. These are baskets that are scored in the Paint area as defined by the shot chart (see below). This means it doesn't include the entire paint like the normal stat does. I refuse to count floaters from just inside the FT line as points in the paint. By definition, it also doesn't count any free throws taken if you're fouled on a shot in the paint. Theory says more points in the paint leads to more wins, but NBA math has actually shown this to not be true.\n\nBench Points. These are the points scored by any player who didn't start the game. Can be an indicator of a team having better depth than their opponent.\n\nA good example of meaning in this section is the Maple Grove vs Champlin Park game. Champlin Park winning Points off Turnovers and 2nd Chance points helped keep them close despite shooting 3-30 from the 3 point line.\n\nSection 4: Hustle Board\n\nThe intent of this section is to help measure some of the intangibles that don't appear in a basic box score. There are 4 basic stats here. Steals, Blocks and Deflections are self-explanatory. Charges is the number of charges taken. This chart stacks them all together to better show the cumulative effect. See Wayzata's dominance of Duluth East in this area.\n\nSection 5: Game Flow\n\nWhen did it all go sideways? That question gets answered here. This chart is actually 2 charts in 1. It combines 2 of the game flows that I've seen presented online. The chart legend shows the Points Per Possession (PPP) metric for each team. PPP is a great overview metric for offensive efficiency as turnovers, free throws and field goal percentage all impact that value. 1 point per possession is an easy number to remember as a general benchmark for good or bad. It also applies to defensive efficiency as a low opponent PPP often shows quality defense.\n\nThe 1st chart is the line graph. This shows the total points at that number of possessions into the game. There are also vertical comments that are added in for pointing out specific points on the clock in the game such as halftime. This is a very basic chart showing the progression of a team scoring over the course of the game.\n\nThe 2nd chart is the filled-in areas along the horizontal axis at the 0 points marker. I like to call it the Momentum Tracker. Basically its a map of what the lead was at each point in the game. This chart maps difference in the score per possession from the perspective of the winning team. That way the winning team value always appears on top at the end of the game. I think its a tremendous visual for showing the momentum swings in a game and exactly when they happened. Yes, that data can be gleaned from the line graph, but I feel it really stands out here and was therefore useful to include. A big slope in that section demonstrates a big run.\n\nThe Duluth East vs Wayzata game demonstrates this very well. Duluth East had an 11 point lead at possession 29 so you see a large downward red area. After that, at possessions 40 to 45 you see the graph has flipped to a 8 point Wayzata lead and a large blue area. That shift was a 23-4 Wayzata run. That was after having only 1 lead of 2 points in the 1st half as shown just before possession 15. You also see that by the upper lines crossing over and separating. See also the end of the CDH vs Rosemount game where Rosemount lost a late lead.\n\nSection 6: Shot Chart\n\nIts no secret that I'm huge believer in shooting being the main factor in winning. Coaches use shot charts as their way of viewing shot data. Therefore having this section was mandatory. The upper half of the court is for home team. The bottom half of the court is for the away team. This shot chart is broken down into 13 bubbles for each team. That includes 10 shot regions, free throws and 2 more bubbles to summarize. Here's how the 10 shot regions are defined. 5 of them are for 3 point shots and the other 5 are for 2 point shots.\n\nCorner 3s (left and right): These are 3s taken below the 2nd FT marker.\n\nWing 3s (left and right): These are 3s taken above the 2nd FT marker and outside the NBA lane lines.\n\nTop 3s: These are 3s taken from between the NBA lane lines.\n\nBaseline 2s (left and right): These are 2s taken from outside the NBA lane lines and below the 2nd FT marker.\n\nWing 2s (left and right): These are 2s taken from the wedge shaped area defined by the 3 point line, line above the 2nd marker and divided in half by the mid-line.\n\nPaint 2s: These are 2s taken inside the NBA lane lines and below the 2nd FT marker.\n\nEach of the 11 individual shot bubbles is generally located in the spot on the court that it describes. Then there are the 2 summary bubbles at halfcourt for each team. These bubbles combine the values for all of the 2s and 3s taken. Idea behind this format is to not only distinguish between 2s and 3s but also to be able to split out 2s that are high-quality via attacking the rim vs the dreaded by analytics midrange 2. On this chart, that would be the paint 2s vs all other 2s. It also provides the detail and visual of where exactly where a team was making shots from.\n\nInside each bubble, there's the following data.\n\nEFG%: The Effective Field Goal Percentage on the shots taken from that region.\n\n%ATT: The percentage of the total shots that were taken from that region.\n\nAST%: The percentage of made field goals from that region that were assisted.\n\nBLK%: The percentage of shots taken from that region that were blocked.\n\nThe bubbles are color coded based on the EFG% for shots in that area. This allows a quick glance to see where a team shot the ball well from and where they didn't. The standard thresholds are set to <40% for Red (bad, stop that), >=50% for Green (good, keep doing that) and Yellow for inbetween (be careful). If a team didn't take a shot from a particular region the bubble is removed from the display. You'll see that on the Shakopee shot chart where they didn't take a midrange 2.\n\nA couple of slight color threshold modifications for the chart. Free Throws use 60% and 70%. Paint shots use 50% and 60%. The 2 point overall bubble uses the paint values to help generate what the overall EFG color threshold for that bubble should be. So that's why you may see overall 2 point shots over 50% but not colored green because most of those shots were in the paint.\n\nSo there it is, click on any of the images below to expand it. I hope it adds value to what is presented for each game. Any feedback you have is welcome.\n\nCzar Insights for 2021 Class AAAA State Quarterfinals\n\nThis is the 13th preview in my 2021-22 Season Preview Series. In this preview, we head south for a look at the South Suburban Conference. For a list of all the season previews and how they are generated, click here.\n\nApple Valley Eagles (2020-21 season 4-15, 4-14 Conference, Tie 8th)\n\nApple Valley once again has to replace their top 3 scorers. That includes Dylan Omweno (11.2 PPG) who is now at crosstown rival Eastview. Junior forward Khalif Bettis (8.9 PPG) will lead the offense. Quinn Ewald (6.6 PPG) also returns to the starting lineup as a hard working wing. Mileo Patterson will see time on the front line as well.\n\nBurnsville Blaze (2020-21 season 0-19, 0-18 Conference, 10th)\n\nBurnsville loses 3 of their top 4 scorers from last year's squad. Junior guard Henry Saykeo (9.1 PPG) leads the returning unit. Nobody else averaged more than 3.7 PPG last season. Brendan Affana-Shanks returns in the center spot. Sterling Brown and Abdihamid Jama return at perimeter spots.\n\nEagan Wildcats (2020-21 season 6-13, 6-12 Conference, 7th)\n\nCoach Kevin McKenzie returns 3 of his top 4 scorers from last season. The junior duo of double figure scorers Oscar Khazon (13.7 PPG) and Emmanuel Schmitter (13.2 PPG) returns on the wings. Khazon is a knock down shooter and Schmitter is a solid all around wing. Logan Schmidt (6.6 PPG) returns to anchor the middle. The experience of 8 seniors who all saw significant minutes will be missed. Olana Mitoro and Mason Amann are main candidates to fill those minutes.\n\nEastview Lightning (2020-21 season 17-3, 16-2 Conference, 1st)\n\nEastview replaced all 5 starters last season and won the league outright. Now they lose 6 of their top 7 scorers. But the Lightning once again will reload and be a threat to win the league. Kenji Scales (14.7 PPG) returns at the PG spot. They also add Dylan Omweno from Apple Valley as another guard. Juniors Mario and Myles Adams look to fill wing spots. The front line is loaded with Jamal Ambrose and Chet Kloss. Both are in the classic Eastview mold of bigs who can step away from the basket and shoot it.\n\nFarmington Tigers (2020-21 season 12-8, 11-7 Conference, 6th)\n\nThe Tigers have to replace 4 of their top 6 scorers from last season. Leading scorer Kyle Hrncir (13.8 PPG) returns to the lineup after a nice summer with WOTN. Guard Sam Hoffman (6.9 PPG) and forward Zach Cochnauer (5.7 PPG) also return to the rotation. Rod Finley and Connor Weed will also see major minutes.\n\nLakeville North Panthers (2020-21 season 13-7, 12-6 Conference, Tie 3rd)\n\nIt will be a youthful Lakeville North roster after graduating 3 of their top 4 scorers. That includes a combined 26.5 PPG from Will Blascziek and Cooper Laufenburger. 3 juniors will lead the way. That group features a pair of talented wings in Nolan Winter (11 PPG) and Hudson Vaith (5.6 PPG). Add in soph lefty Jack Robison (4.1 PPG) and you have a nice core for the next 2 seasons. Seniors R'Moni Warner (5.9 PPG), Brayden Manning and Michael McDonald will see rotation time.\n\nLakeville South Cougars (2020-21 season 13-7, 12-6 Conference, Tie 3rd)\n\nThe Cougars have to replace 2 double figure scorers including star guard Reid Patterson (18.2 PPG) and Trystan Ressler (10.4 PPG). The wing position will be deep with Avery Mast (12.2 PPG), Sam Fliehe (7.5 PPG) and lefty Connor Beauchamp. Chase Androff returns to man the interior. Junior Jackson Ressler is an option to run the show.\n\nPrior Lake Lakers (2020-21 season 4-15, 4-14 Conference, Tie 8th)\n\nSenior forward Malcolm Jones led the league in scoring at 20.2 PPG last season. Expect that to happen again this season. Kellan Miller (8.3 PPG) and PG Kyle Haas also return to the starting lineup. Emmett McKush and Tommy Hjerpe are experienced guards in the rotation.\n\nRosemount Irish (2020-21 season 15-7, 12-6 Conference, Tie 3rd)\n\nThe Irish are coming off a state tournament season. They gave Cretin-Derham Hall all they wanted in a 41-40 loss in the state quarters. Senior Caleb Siwek (20.1 PPG) is the top sniper in the league along with being a clutch player in crunch time. I expect a monster season from him. The next 3 scorers behind him need to be replaced. That includes the 10.8 PPG, defense and leadership of guard Sean Sullivan. Junior guard Anish Ramlall (6.1 PPG) should pick up much of that. Carter Theisen and Sam Kuseske return to man in the interior.\n\nShakopee Sabers (2020-21 season 17-6, 13-5 Conference, 2nd)\n\nShakopee returns most of their balanced rotation from last season. Forward Mick Wherley and his 10.8 PPG will be the hardest thing to replace. The main key will be keeping leading scorer Cade McGraw (12 PPG) healthy at the point guard spot. UMD commit Nick Katona (11.7 PPG) and Sam West are versatile forwards. Yonis Mohamud (7 PPG) can score in bunches from the shooting guard spot.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nShakopee\n\nEastview\n\nRosemount\n\nLakeville North\n\nLakeville South\n\nEagan\n\nFarmington\n\nPrior Lake\n\nApple Valley\n\nBurnsville\n\nConference Overview:\n\nShakopee made the state tourney last year and has most of the roster back. That makes them the pick here. Eastview will reload and give them a stiff challenge. The next 3 all tied for 3rd last season and that seems very plausible again as all return multiple pieces. I'll put Rosemount at the top of the group thanks to their state qualification and return of Caleb Siwek. Eagan loses experience but returns 2 top scorers and an experienced big. Combined with Farmington's losses, I'll flip-flop them in this year's standings. Prior Lake has the best player of the rest. Apple Valley and Burnsville are in major rebuilds.\n\nConference MVP: Caleb Siwek - Rosemount\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nJeremy Sherlock - Burnsville\n\nJack Robison - Lakeville North\n\nIsaac Snell - Shakopee\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nEastview at Shakopee - Jan 28th\n\nShakopee at Eastview - Feb 24th\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nEastview at Chaska - Dec 3rd\n\nEastview vs Maple Grove - Dec 11th (Tipoff Classic)\n\nShakopee at Wayzata - Dec 14th\n\nEastview at Minnehaha - Dec 14th\n\nEastview vs Cretin-Derham Hall - Dec 30th (East Ridge Holiday Tourney)\n\nThis is the 12th preview in my 2021-2022 season preview series. In this preview, I continue my look at the local big schools with a look at the Suburban East Conference. For a list of all the season previews and how they were generated, click here.\n\nCretin-Derham Hall Raiders (2020-21 season 18-6, 13-5 Conference, 3rd)\n\nSenior PG Tre Holloman (20.3 PPG) returns as the lynchpin for last year's state runner up. Nine seniors need to be replaced but the Raiders will reload with a couple of notable transfers. Guard Donavhan Cain was a double figure scorer in Wisconsin last season. Center Branden Melchior averaged double figures at Elk River last season. That will take some of the scoring load off of Holloman and provide more balance. Charlie Plum also returns to provide front line depth.\n\nEast Ridge Raptors (2020-21 season 12-7, 11-6 Conference, 4th)\n\nCoach Josh Peltier needs to replace most of his front line. The strength of the team will be the guards with St. Thomas commit Kendall Blue (15 PPG) and junior Alex Mattes (12.7 PPG). Junior Pete Koland also returns at a guard spot. A talented sophomore class is behind them. From that group, Brayden Carlson figures to be a key option to take up the interior minutes.\n\nForest Lake Rangers (2020-21 season 11-9, 10-8 Conference, 5th)\n\nKyle McDonald takes over the program making for a 3rd McDonald coaching in section 7AAAA. He has to replace 6 of the top 7 scorers from last season. Soph Owen Waldoch (4 PPG) should take up some of the slack from the loss of leading scorer Jordan Boysen (12.8 PPG) inside. Nick Bartlett (11.2 PPG) returns to lead the perimeter group. Ted Carey will be 1 option in the rotation.\n\nIrondale Knights (2020-21 season 1-18, 1-17 Conference, 10th)\n\nFormer St. Bernard's point guard and St. Catherine's assistant Trent Davis is the new head coach. He has 4 top scorers returning to work with. DJ Anthony (9.6 PPG) and Drake Gomez (9.3 PPG) are 2 of those options. Calvin Marcellus is a banger inside. Juniors Max Herlofsky, Dane Dedominces and Cooper O'Brien are other rotation options.\n\nMounds View Mustangs (2020-21 season 16-4, 15-3 Conference, Tie 1st)\n\nThe Mustangs lineup is led by a quality perimeter duo. Kobe Kirk (15.2 PPG) and Dylan Wheeler (12 PPG) were 2 of the top 3 scorers last season. Both can handle and shoot it. Ryan Edelman (4.5 PPG) returns to his screening and defending forward role. Ben Erickson and Duncan Loegering look to step into the rotation.\n\nPark Wolfpack (2020-21 season 11-10, 9-9 Conference, 6th)\n\nHigh expectations this season with Minnesota commit Pharrel Payne (14.8 PPG) in the middle. They are coming off a run to the section final last season. Jamari Walker (7.5 PPG) returns with Payne on the front line. Wings Evan Bearth (10.4 PPG), Brady Perryman, Jack Blumberg and Brayden Fick all return to the rotation. The big question is what do they do at point guard. Jayden Lane's experience, fearless mentality and 10 PPG at that spot will be sorely missed.\n\nRoseville Raiders (2020-21 season 4-14, 4-13 Conference, 8th)\n\nRoseville has to replace their 3 top scorers from last season. That includes 10.1 PPG from leading scorer Elijah Burns up front. Size will be the question mark with the entire frontcourt graduating. Leighton Alvarez is a top option there. The wings will be the strength with Keyon Broussard (6.6 PPG) and soph Ataa Adjetey-Mensah (4.8 PPG) returning. Seniors Charlie Pearson and Cohen Rice will also see perimeter rotation time.\n\nStillwater Ponies (2020-21 season 4-15, 4-14 Conference, 9th)\n\nJunior Max Shikenjanski (24.2 PPG) will once again run the show. He's coming off a monster summer season as the 16U MVP. Tyler Tompkins (14.1 PPG) and center Sam Shikenjanski (7.7 PPG) need to be replaced. Nobody else who returns averaged more than 4 PPG. Nicholas Koehn (4 PPG) and Andrew Gustafson (3.9 PPG) return to the starting lineup and look to pickup some of that offense to help take the load off of Shikenjanski.\n\nWhite Bear Lake Bears (2020-21 season 7-12, 7-11 Conference, 7th)\n\nFormer Osseo assistant Greg Burke takes over the program. He has to replace Kanye Raheem's 13.9 PPG on the wing. But the guard spots are still strong with juniors Jack Janicki (19.7 PPG) and Jack Misgen (9.2 PPG) coming back. Janicki is one of the state's top juniors and Misgen is a quality shooter. Seniors Alex Lockwood and Brock Taugner also return to the lineup.\n\nWoodbury Royals (2020-21 season 17-4, 15-3 Conference, Tie 1st)\n\nWoodbury has to replace 4 of their top 5 scorers. That includes 3 double figure wing scorers led by Brad Cimperman and his 14.5 PPG. Wing Blake Rohrer (9.7 PPG) should be the top option and easily move into double figures this season. Guard James Maier (3.7 PPG) and forward Dom Cuoco (5.9 PPG) are the remaining players from last year's rotation. Very limited experience after them.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nCretin-Derham Hall\n\nEast Ridge\n\nMounds View\n\nPark\n\nWhite Bear Lake\n\nStillwater\n\nWoodbury\n\nForest Lake\n\nIrondale\n\nRoseville\n\nConference Overview:\n\nIts a strong year in the league with the top 6 scorers coming back. Cretin-Derham Hall reloads and looks to make another run at a state title. Behind them I see a great battle between East Ridge, Mounds View and Park. I could justify those teams in any order. White Bear Lake has the best 2 pieces out of the remaining teams and the best chance to jump into that 2nd group. Stillwater has Max Shikenjanski but can they get him help out of their Princeton Point system. Woodbury and Forest Lake will battle behind them. Both have heavy losses from last season so its hard to put them in the top half. Irondale and Roseville bring up the bottom again.\n\nConference MVP: Tre Holloman - Cretin-Derham Hall Underclassmen to watch:\n\nMekhi Edwards - Cretin-Derham Hall\n\nBrayden Carlson, Charlie Theis, Parker Wellman - East Ridge\n\nOwen Waldoch, Reid Olson - Forest Lake\n\nJoey Fretheim - Mounds View\n\nAtaa Adjetey-Mensah, Will Devries - Roseville\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nEast Ridge at Cretin-Derham Hall - Dec 14th\n\nPark at Cretin-Derham Hall - Dec 16th\n\nStillwater at White Bear Lake - Dec 16th\n\nCretin-Derham Hall at East Ridge - Jan 28th\n\nCretin-Derham Hall at Park - Feb 3rd\n\nWhite Bear Lake at Stillwater - Feb 3rd\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nCretin-Derham Hall vs Totino-Grace - Dec 11th (Tipoff Classic)\n\nEast Ridge vs Hopkins - Dec 11th (Tipoff Classic)\n\nCretin-Derham Hall vs Wayzata - Dec 18th (Big 12 Classic)\n\nCretin-Derham Hall vs Eastview - Dec 30th (E Ridge Holiday Tourney)\n\nWayzata at East Ridge - Feb 2nd\n\nCretin-Derham Hall at De La Salle - Feb 19th\n\nEast Ridge at Minneapolis North - Feb 19th\n\nThis is the 11th preview in my 2021-2022 season preview series. In this preview, a look at the Northwest Suburban Conference. For a list of all the season previews and how they are done, click here.\n\nAndover Huskies (2020-21 season 13-6, 9-4 Conference, Tie 3rd)\n\nAssistant Jeremy Hable takes over the Husky program. He has to replace double figure scorer Calvin Foy (13.4 PPG). Juniors Sam Musungu (16.1 PPG) and Ben Kopetzki (14.6) have plenty of experience to build around on the perimeter. Kopetzki is a tough as nails point guard, Musungu is a defender and slasher. Sam Angell returns to man the inside. Joey Mallet is another possible option there. Very limited experience and firepower beyond the top 3.\n\nAnoka Tornadoes (2020-21 season 0-19, 0-13 Conference, 14th)\n\nFormer Bethel assistant Jesse Jefferson is the new head coach. He returns most of the roster including the 2 double figure scorers. Guards Keenan Rodriguez (12.9 PPG) and Jaypheth Nyamari (11.5 PPG) will lead the offense. Jacob Duetschman and Grant Chapman provide size inside.\n\nBlaine Bengals (2020-21 season 6-12, 4-8 Conference, 9th)\n\nAssistant Lance Pettis takes the reins of the program. Top scorer Sam Olson (12.2 PPG) graduated but the next 3 scorers return. Senior forward AJ Kaul (12.1 PPG), soph SG Ethan Pettis (8.9 PPG) and senior Isaac Moin (7.2 PPG) lead the returning roster. Seniors Jack Pelkey and Joe Beckman also return to the rotation.\n\nCentennial Cougars (2020-21 season 2-17, 1-12 Conference, 13th)\n\nContinuing the assistants take over theme, Spencer Valdvogel is the new Centennial head coach. Leading scorer Mason Lindsay (10.9 PPG) has graduated after being the only double figure scorer last season. Soph guard Ty Burgoon averaged 8.9 PPG after moving up to varsity. Reese Neudahl (6.4 PPG) returns on a wing. Kevin Jansa returns to provide size inside.\n\nChamplin Park Rebels (2020-21 season 21-1, 13-0 Conference, 1st)\n\nFormer Rebel Aaron Kloeppner takes over the program. He has to replace the league's top 2 scorers and the top 6 Rebels scorers from last season. Center Francis Nwaokorie and PG Josh Strong combined for over 40 PPG last season. Wing Ayo Taki (2.8 PPG) is the top returnee. Ethan Lukandwa is the only other member of the rotation coming back. Seniors Lorenzo Andrews, Laju Denedo, Branden Shaffa, Leo Juusola and Alex Gamber along with soph Luke Graff should comprise most of the rest of the lineup.\n\nCoon Rapids Cardinals (2020-21 season 9-12, 4-9 Conference, 10th)\n\nThe Cardinals have to replace a pair of double figure scorers from last season including PG Jordan Doe (11.2 PPG). They have 3 double figure scorers returning from a balanced lineup. Wing MJ Galimah (17 PPG), forwards Elijah Smith (14.8 PPG) and Matt Ellingson (11.2 PPG) all return to the rotation. Griffin Thom and forward Alex Beck also return to the experienced rotation. Plenty of length to deploy in their 1-3-1 zone.\n\nElk River Elks (2020-21 season 6-12, 3-8 Conference, 11th)\n\nElk River returns 3 starters. Cade Osterman (14.7 PPG) and PG Parker Behne (11.5 PG) lead the offense. PF Caleb Gillquist (8.2 PPG) returns as the leader of the front line. He'll see more interior touches with Brandon Melchior (13.1 PPG) transferring to Cretin-Derham Hall. Mason Mattingly is the only other experience returnee to the rotation.\n\nMaple Grove Crimson (2020-21 season 13-10, 9-4 Conference, Tie 3rd)\n\nThe Crimson have to replace the solid wing duo of Morgan Moore (13 PPG) and Terence Anthony-Larmouth (9.3 PPG) plus versatile forward Caden Boettcher (11.6 PPG). They also lose center Payton Mogire to Robbinsdale Armstrong. PG Jon Haakenson returns after leading the team in scoring last year with 13.2 PPG. His recovery from a fall injury will be a big item to watch. Junior center Lincoln Palbicki (6.9 PPG) also returns to the starting lineup. Junior guard Raoul Vaidya returns to the rotation and can also handle PG duties. The rest of the rotation will be inexperienced due to 7 seniors graduating.\n\nOsseo Orioles (2020-21 season 11-9, 8-5 Conference, Tie 7th)\n\nCoach Tim Theisen has to replace 2 of his top 3 scorers. That includes Minnesota commit Josh Ola-Joseph (16.7 PPG) who was the leading scorer last season. The uber athletic forward is off to prep school for his senior season. Benard Omooria (10.3 PPG) and Tyriece Waits (8.4 PPG) return at the guard spots. Blessed Barhayiga (7.4 PPG) returns at center. Seniors Lewis Cargeor and Owen Dukowitz are experienced role guys that Osseo plugs in every year. Trey Smith and soph Isaiah Johnson could also jump into the rotation.\n\nPark Center Pirates (2020-21 season 15-6, 9-4 Conference, Tie 3rd)\n\nThe beat goes on for coach James Ware and the Pirates. They have the top returning scorer in the league, Minnesota commit Braedon Carrington (18.1 PPG), at a guard spot. Ayouba Berthe and Leo Torbor are athletic wings that return. They also pick up wing Cody Pennebaker who scored 22.8 PPG at St. Francis last season. James Spencer will do the dirty work in the middle. Junior JJ Ware is the other experienced returnee.\n\nRobbinsdale Armstrong Falcons (2020-21 season 12-8, 8-4 Conference, 6th)\n\nFormer Maranatha and Totino-Grace head coach Rob Ware has been given the reins of the program. He needs to replace the 2 double-figure scorers from last season. Guard D'sean Larkins and shooter Dylan Inniger combined for over 35 PPG last season. Seniors Jamez Garner (7.4 PPG) and Peyton Newburn (8.2 PPG) return as top guards. Devin Jones, junior Owen Skram (6.9 PPG) and soph Seth Newburn also return to the rotation. Maple Grove transfer Payton Mogire takes over in the middle.\n\nRogers Royals (2020-21 season 5-14, 2-11 Conference, 12th)\n\nWing Michael Olowo (10.9 PPG) is the biggest lost from the rotation. Guards Peyton Belka (17.9 PPG) and junior Easton Whitcomb (8.3 PPG) return to lead the offense. Alex Bowman and Mitchell Jezierski return to the starting lineup. Lefty Nick Gleason returns to the rotation and can provide some shooting. They'll need to find size to replace Carter Daun (4.8 PPG) inside.\n\nSpring Lake Park Panthers (2020-21 season 12-7, 8-5 Conference, Tie 7th)\n\nThe top 3 scorers from last season need to be replaced. They combined for 39 PPG last season. Breakout forward Logan Kinsey (9.4 PPG) will lead the way this season. He'll play his college ball at Minnesota-Moorhead. Nick Ojile (5.5 PPG) and Stephen Kesti will join him on the front line. In the backcourt, Payton Thomsen (8.1 PPG) is a quality shooter. Senior Jackson Weier will see time at the point guard spot.\n\nTotino-Grace Eagles (2020-21 season 16-5, 11-2 Conference, 2nd)\n\nLeading scorer CJ O'Hara (13.4 PPG) is now at Hopkins. Another double figure scorer Devin Burger (10.7 PPG) has graduated along with plenty of quality depth. Still plenty of riches for coach Nick Carroll. Iowa St commit Demarion Watson (12.6 PPG) and Tommy Humphries (9.8 PPG) man the wings. Junior Taison Chatman (12.6 PPG) returns at the point. Byron transfer Ahjany Lee will man the inside along with Patrick Bath. Bath can play a stretch 4 with both on the floor. RJ Spencer and PJ Ebeling are options in the rotation as well.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nNorth Division\n\nMaple Grove\n\nAndover\n\nCoon Rapids\n\nChamplin Park\n\nBlaine\n\nCentennial\n\nAnoka\n\nWest Division\n\nTotino-Grace\n\nPark Center\n\nOsseo\n\nRobbinsdale Armstrong\n\nSpring Lake Park\n\nRogers\n\nElk River\n\nConference Overview:\n\nAfter using a single round-robin schedule last season, the league reverts to its usual 2 division North and West format. The league features 6 new head coaches this season. As has been the case in recent memory, the North division is far weaker than the West division. Division powers Champlin Park and Maple Grove have plenty of holes to fill but annually seem to reload. Maple Grove with 2 solid guards and a tough matchup inside coming back makes them my favorite. I'll move Andover up to second after their finish last season and 2 top guys returning. Coon Rapids also moves up with most of their roster returning. Champlin Park is a major wildcard here with a new coach and rebuilt roster. Blaine has a couple of pieces to work with so I'll put them ahead of rebuilding Centennial and Anoka.\n\nIn the West, Totino-Grace and Park Center are state championship contenders in the top 2 classes and have to be the favorites. I see Osseo having different chemistry and a redemption season after 2 straight seasons that weren't up to Osseo standards. They'll get a stiff test from Armstrong and Spring Lake Park. Spring Lake Park is strong up front and always tough at home, they'll be dangerous. Elk River and Rogers are a notch below and will battle to stay out of the cellar.\n\nConference MVP: Braeden Carrington - Park Center\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nAnthony Howze - Anoka\n\nEthan Pettis - Blaine\n\nTy Burgoon - Centennial\n\nLuke Graff - Champlin Park\n\nIsaiah Johnson - Osseo\n\nSeth Newburn - Robbinsdale Armstrong\n\nZy'lierre Stewart- Totino-Grace\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nAndover at Maple Grove - Jan 11th\n\nPark Center at Totino-Grace - Jan 21st\n\nMaple Grove at Toino-Grace - Jan 27th\n\nMaple Grove at Andover - Feb 4th\n\nTotino-Grace at Park Center - Feb 18th\n\nPark Center at Maple Grove - Feb 24th\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nHopkins at Maple Grove - Dec 7th\n\nDe La Salle at Park Center - Dec 9th\n\nTotino-Grace vs Cretin-Derham Hall - Dec 11th (Tipoff Classic)\n\nPark Center vs Wayzata - Dec 11th (Tipoff Classic)\n\nMaple Grove vs Eastview - Dec 11th (Tipoff Classic)\n\nDe La Salle at Totino-Grace - Dec 18th (Big 12 Classic)\n\nMinnehaha at Park Center - Dec 18th\n\nChicago Whitney Young (IL) at Totino-Grace - Jan 8th\n\nThis is the 10th preview in my 2021-2022 season preview series. Its now time for the big schools with the mostly class AAAA leagues are now on the list of previews. In this preview, a look at the expanded Metro West Conference. For a list of all the season previews and how they are done, click here.\n\nBenilde St. Margaret's Red Knights (2020-21 season 8-9, 4-7 Conference, 4th)\n\nCoach Damien Johnson has a strong perimeter group. Bemidji State commit Daniel Ijadimbola (12.7 PPG) and Sam Best return on the wings. PG Maddox Alipate (11.6 PPG) returns to run the show. They were the top 3 scorers a season ago. That group also adds transfer Ryan Warren from Eden Prairie. On the inside, freshman Jalen Wilson comes over from Breck to be the top interior option.\n\nBloomington Jefferson Jaguars (2020-21 season 11-9, 7-5 Conference, 3rd)\n\nJefferson loses most of their thin rotation including 2 of their 3 double figure scorers. Soph Daniel Freitag (10.2 PPG) leads the offense. He picked up offers from Minnesota and Wisconsin in the offseason. Senior Aidan Atkins (8.2 PPG) is the only other returnee of note. They again rely on slow tempo and execution.\n\nBloomington Kennedy Eagles (2020-21 season 2-16, 1-11 Conference, 7th)\n\nPG Amarion Hanspard (13.5 PPG) is a big loss from last season. They also lose freshman Jaleel Donley (7.1 PPG) to Hopkins. Senior post Christopher Martin (8.9 PPG) returns to lead the offense. Juniors Marques Monroe and Tajon Pearson returns to the lineup. Seniors Ramone Walker and Dalton Smazal will also see significant minutes.\n\nChanhassen Storm (2020-21 season 3-10, 3-7 Conference, 5th)\n\nSoph PG Max Woods leads the returning roster with 10.3 PPG last season. Seniors Will Schleicher, Patrick Brick, Jaxon McDonald and Eli Sweeney return to the rotation. Juniors wings Grant Muffenbier and Braden Barger also return and should be other main scoring options. Eden Prairie transfer Christian Batchlor could also see minutes.\n\nChaska Hawks (2020-21 season 14-4, 11-1 Conference, Tie 1st)\n\nChaska has to replace the league's top scorer Luke Strazzanti (14.2 PPG) and 2 other double figure scorers. The Hawks will be strong up front with center Brady Nicholson (9.2 PPG) and forward Jakobe Lyles (7.2 PPG) as the top returning scorers. Matt Kallman and Cameron Walle figure to see time as the perimeter replacements. But there is no real experience returning there.\n\nNew Prague Trojans (2020-21 season 5-14, 3-11 Wright County East Conference, 8th)\n\nLeading scorer Andrew Nerud (14.1 PPG) graduated taking away the top scorer and main interior option. Guards Ethan Chromy (11.4 PPG) and Matthew Kudrle man the guard spots. Soph Carter Wilson backs them up. Jaxon Short figures to take over Nerud's duties inside.\n\nOrono Spartans (2020-21 season 9-9, 7-6 Wright County East Conference, Tie 3rd)\n\nThe Spartans lose their leading scorer Graham Beltrand (12.6 PPG) and a couple of solid interior options in Connor Chappell and Andrew Mandel. They still have a strong core coming back though. Senior shooter Sebastian Loder (8.6 PPG) is the top returning scorer. Senior PG Cohen Kellogg also joins that strong group transferring in from Minnetonka. Juniors Isaiah Hagen (8.5 PPG), Kyle Kallenbach and Grant Gunderson add to the strong perimeter group. Seniors Jack Kopesky and Jake Farrell also return to the rotation. Size is a question mark.\n\nRobbinsdale Cooper Hawks (2020-21 season 15-3, 11-1 Conference, Tie 1st)\n\nCooper loses 3 important pieces from last year's roster including PG Bo Powell (10.2 PPG). Davion Evans (13.3 PPG) was the team leader in scoring last season. He leads a strong group coming back. Prince Appiah, Joseph Russell and David Connors all also return as athletic forwards. Point guard play and outside shooting are questions. But they'll use their pressure defense to generate offense.\n\nSt. Louis Park Orioles (2020-21 season 3-13, 3-8 Conference, 6th)\n\nWing Paris Johnson (14 PPG) is the league's top returning scorer. Blake Anderson and Will Dvorak also return to the starting lineup. Evan Donesky and junior Stefano Giovannelli also return to the rotation. Last year's 2 primary ballhandlers have graduated so keep an eye on point guard play.\n\nWaconia Wildcats (2020-21 season 12-7, 8-5 Wright County East Conference, 2nd)\n\nFormer De La Salle assistant Dan Rubischko gets another crack at running a program. Forward Spencer Swanson (20.1 PPG) and his interior presence will be sorely missed. Joe Meath looks to be a primary candidate to replace his spot. The scoring will be picked up by a solid group of perimeter returnees. Noah Bonick (9.9 PPG), junior Ty Miller (8.2 PPG) and Wally Wisniewski (6.8 PPG) all return to the starting lineup with the ability to knock down shots.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nBenilde-St. Margaret's\n\nRobbinsdale Cooper\n\nChaska\n\nOrono\n\nWaconia\n\nBloomington Jefferson\n\nChanhassen\n\nSt. Louis Park\n\nNew Prague\n\nBloomington Kennedy\n\nConference Overview\n\nThe largest set of league changes in the metro happens here. New Prague, Orono and Waconia all join from the Wright County with dominoes falling from there. I think Benilde St. Margaret's guards plus the addition inside of Jalen Wilson give them the most complete package in the league so I'll take them at the top. That breaks the streak of Hawks winning the league every year which is only fitting with the new era of the league being ushered in.\n\nBehind them you have a large group of quality teams with Chaska, Cooper, Orono and Waconia. Chaska on the strength of their bigs. Cooper on the strength of their athletes. Orono has experience and can score it. Waconia has to figure out inside play too but their strong perimeter play keeps them in the top half. Then a drop off to everybody else. Jefferson has the system and a star in Daniel Freitag so I'll take them next. Chanhassen and St. Louis Park will battle them for that spot. Then New Prague and Kennedy fight to stay out of the cellar.\n\nConference MVP: Maddox Alipate - Benilde-St. Margaret's\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nJalen Wilson, Xavier Lumpkin, Jayden Daisy - Benilde-St. Margaret's\n\nDaniel Freitag - Bloomington Jefferson\n\nMax Woods - Chanhassen\n\nCarter Wilson - New Prague\n\nAnthony Jones - Robbinsdale Cooper\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nChaska at Robbinsdale Cooper - Jan 4th\n\nChaska at Benilde-St. Margaret's - Jan 11th\n\nBenilde-St. Margaret's at Robbinsdale Cooper - Jan 27th\n\nRobbinsdale Cooper at Chaska - Feb 4th\n\nBenilde-St. Margaret's at Chaska - Feb 11th\n\nRobbinsdale Cooper at Benilde-St. Margaret's - Mar 1st\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nMound-Westonka at Benilde-St. Margaret's - Dec 7th\n\nDe La Salle at Benilde-St. Margaret's - Dec 21st\n\nBenilde-St. Margaret's vs Richfield - Dec 30th (Capitol City Classic)"
