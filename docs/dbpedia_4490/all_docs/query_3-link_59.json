        "text": "This is the 14th preview in my 2022-2023 season preview series. In this preview, I finish my look at my look at each of the metro area conferences with a look at the Lake Conference. There's 1 more preview left to go over section predictions and what to watch. For a list of all the season previews and how they are done, click here.\n\nBuffalo Bison (2021-22 season 16-12, 2-10 Conference, Tie 6th)\n\nThe Bison have to replace 6 of their top 7 scorers from a year ago. Last year's leading scorer Antonio Bluiett (16.3 PPG) is the biggest lost. Senior guard Nate Dahl (13.6 PPG) is the top returnee. He'll lead a group of juniors that will be the base of the program this year and next. That includes Brody Wishart, Grady Guida, Torii Johnson, Trenton Radloff and Kai Penney.\n\nEden Prairie Eagles (2021-22 season 19-12, 8-4 Conference, Tie 2nd)\n\nForward Chiddi Obiazor and his 18.5 PPG will be lost due to leaving early for Kansas State football. Huge loss there for the Eagles. Sophs Max Lorenson (5 PPG) and JJ Sullivan are both capable shooters to stretch the floor. Luke Rapp and Joey Flom return to the guard rotation. Jermell Taylor (4.2 PPG) provides front court experience.\n\nEdina Hornets (2021-22 season 15-13, 4-8 Conference, 5th)\n\nFormer Armstrong head coach Jon Bryant takes over with Joe Burger leaving for the Holy Family job. 6 seniors including the inside out duo of Brady Helgren (19.7 PPG) and Gabe Jobe (17.8 PPG) have graduated. Junior guard Kole Hanson (14.8 PPG) had a breakout year with the injury to Sammy Presthus. He is now at Holy Family. Guard Peyton Himley and soph forward Daniel Molhoek are the top returning players at 3.8 PPG. Vinnie Ingram will also see guard minutes. Josiah Coleman transfers in from Maranatha where he averaged 8.8 PPG last season. A group of juniors will be the depth behind that.\n\nHopkins Royals (2021-22 season 18-10, 8-4 Conference, Tie 2nd)\n\nAfter a difficult year for the Royals, they'll have a retooled roster. 7 of the top 9 players need to be replaced. 3 major transfers out (CJ O'Hara 18.6 PPG, Max Wilson, Gavin Pierce) and 2 significant graduations (Elvis Nnaji 15 PPG) cause that. The guard play will be strong with star frosh Jayden Moore (11.1 PPG) and soph Anthony Smith. Vince Hillesheim returns as the main interior presence. Soph Jaleel Donley figured to step into one of those open spots but he too has transferred. He's now at Benilde-St. Margaret's.\n\nMinnetonka Skippers (2021-22 season 18-9, 7-5 Conference, 4th)\n\nThe Skippers once again have a bevy of scoring at their disposal. Junior Jordan Cain led the league with 20.1 PPG last season. Ibo El-Amin added 19.2 PPG from another perimeter spot. Junior PG Andy Stefonowicz holds it all together while adding 13.5 PPG. Senior wings Alex Jones and Jalen Cain add more firepower along with junior Will Koeppen. There's no size of note, but they're one of the few teams that can roll the ball out and just outscore most anybody they play.\n\nSt. Michael-Albertville Knights (2021-22 season 6-21, 2-10 Conference, Tie 6th)\n\nFormer UM-Crookston head coach and STMA assistant Jeff Oseth takes over the program. He needs to replace 3 starters including both double figure scorers from last season. Forward Colton Demarais (8.5 PPG) is the top returnee. Soph wing Hudson Hochstedler (5.7 PPG) will also see a bigger role. Landon Riebel, Logan Jans and Connor Luongvan also return to the rotation. Logan Kunz should see interior minutes in the rotation.\n\nWayzata Trojans (2021-22 season 27-5, 11-1 Conference, 1st)\n\nWayzata has made the last 2 AAAA championship games. They look to make another run for a gold ball this season. Forward Carter Bjerke (17.1 PPG) is now at the U of St. Thomas but the rest of the roster is loaded. Senior guards Hayden Tibbits (13.7 PPG), Spencer Hall, Myles Barnette, and Jake Schmitt make up a backcourt that has shooting, experience and ball handling. Then you have junior Jackson McAndrew and his high major talent ready to step into Bjerke's stretch forward spot. Isaiah Habte provides another option at that spot.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nWayzata\n\nMinnetonka\n\nHopkins\n\nEden Prairie\n\nBuffalo\n\nEdina\n\nSt. Michael-Albertville\n\nConference Overview\n\nWayzata is the favorite here. After moving Minnetonka too far down last season, I'm going to throw the pendulum the other way this season. Hopkins still has Ken Novak Jr at the helm and Jayden Moore so I can't move them too far down. Eden Prairie would have had something to say about all of that but they drop with Obiazor leaving early. Then a drop to the last 3 squads who are all looking for the future. Buffalo and Edina battle for the 5th spot. I'll take Buffalo's experience and not having a new coach here. STMA has some youth but the rest of the league is too tough.\n\nConference MVP: Hayden Tibbits - Wayzata\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nMax Lorenson, JJ Sullivan, Hamze Yusef - Eden Prairie\n\nDaniel Molhoek - Edina\n\nJayden Moore, Anthony Smith - Hopkins\n\nDuke Richardson - Minnetonka\n\nHudson Hochstedler, Kyle Ross, Jeremiah Johnson - St. Michael-Albertville\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nMinnetonka at Hopkins - Jan 20th\n\nMinnetonka at Wayzata - Jan 27th\n\nWayzata at Minnetonka - Feb 21st\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nWayzata vs Eastview - Dec 10th (Tipoff Classic at Hopkins)\n\nBloomington Jefferson at Hopkins - Dec 10th (Tipoff Classic)\n\nMinnetonka vs De La Salle - Dec 10th (Tipoff Classic at Hopkins)\n\nLakeville North at Wayzata - Dec 13th\n\nEastview at Minnetonka - Jan 3rd\n\nEast Ridge at Wayzata - Jan 31st\n\nDe La Salle at Wayzata - Feb 28th\n\nThis is the 13th preview in my 2022-23 Season Preview Series. In this preview, we head south for a look at the South Suburban Conference. For a list of all the season previews and how they are generated, click here.\n\nApple Valley Eagles (2021-22 season 5-22, 2-16 Conference, Tie 9th)\n\nFormer De La Salle assistant David Collier is the new head coach. The top 5 scorers have graduated. PG Eli Ocharo (5.4 PPG) is the top returnee. There is experience at the guard spots with Romelo Speights, Yaden Cunningham and youngsters Justin Cowan and Ja'khi Hollie.\n\nBurnsville Blaze (2021-22 season 3-22, 2-16 Conference, Tie 9th)\n\nAlso a coaching change at Burnsville with assistant Erik Leafblad taking over the program. Most of the roster returns. He'll be able to build around the league's top returning scorer Khalif Bettis (19.8 PPG). Henry Saykeo (12.6 PPG), Jeremy Sherlock and Jude De La Luz return at guard spots. They also add guard JT Thornton from Lakeville North. 7 foot junior Henry Buchanan (6.7 PPG) returns as a rim protector inside.\n\nEagan Wildcats (2021-22 season 7-20, 3-15 Conference, 8th)\n\nThe Wildcats return their 3 top scorers, all on the perimeter. The offense will run thru 4 year guard Emmanuel Schmitter (16.1 PPG). Senior shooters Oscar Khazon and Austin Carruthers (10.8 PPG) surround him. Khazon returns after missing much of last season due to injury. Logan Schmitt needs to be replaced inside. Jack Hansen figures to take most of those minutes. George Anderson and Owen Ford will provide perimeter depth.\n\nEastview Lightning (2021-22 season 23-8, 13-5 Conference, 3rd)\n\nEastview has to replace 4 of their top 5 scorers including the top duo of F Jamal Ambrose and PG Kenji Scales. They both averaged 15.8 PPG. But this is Eastview and they just reload. PG Dylan Omweno (9.8 PPG) and F Chet Kloss (6.5 PPG) lead the returning cast. Kloss is the next in the long line of inside out Eastview forwards. The supporting cast is loaded. Mario and Myles Adams are athletic wings. Elias Batala and Ruhan Jordan are solid guards. Henry Eliason is a sniper. Then there's another forward waiting to breakout in junior Jonathan Mekonnen.\n\nFarmington Tigers (2021-22 season 21-8, 15-3 Conference, 2nd)\n\nFarmington has to replace their top 3 scorers. That includes star forward Kyle Hrncir and his 20.6 PPG. PG Baiden Bean (8.6 PPG) leads the returning players. Connor Todd is the only other rotation player coming back. Juniors Tyler Beckwith and Brandon Hrncir figure to step in to the rotation. Sophs Cole Wilcek, Jonah Ask and Nik Domier will compete for time too.\n\nLakeville North Panthers (2021-22 season 19-9, 12-6 Conference, 4th)\n\nCoach John Oxton has the option to deploy a gigantic lineup with his 2-3 zone. Wisconsin commit Nolan Winter (17.5 PPG) mans the middle defensively but his skill to step out on offense makes him a very dangerous offensive threat. Jack Robison and Hudson Vaith are 2 versatile big wings who can score or distribute. Matt Drake and Sam Nolan give them a set of more conventional guards should they go that way. Jace Hernandez is a big body inside. Will Kutzler and Erik Ryan are in the stretch forward mold that the Panthers have had for years. A true point guard is about the only question this roster has.\n\nLakeville South Cougars (2021-22 season 17-11, 10-8 Conference, Tie 5th)\n\nLakeville South has to replace 3 of their top 4 scorers including 3 in double figures. They'll be solid on the perimeter. Guard Jackson Ressler (8.2 PPG) is the top returning scorer and anchor of this team. Reece Volk joins him at a guard spot. Junior wings Marley Baah-Yeboah and DaMarcus Burks will see much expanded roles. Fellow Junior Ryan Johnson should also see time there after sitting out last year as a transfer. Reece Gerl will man in the interior.\n\nPrior Lake Lakers (2021-22 season 11-17, 7-11 Conference, 7th)\n\nForward Malcolm Jones (19.9 PPG) is now at Minnesota State. That's the biggest loss with all 5 starters graduating. Luke McCollough (4.1 PPG) is the top guy back. Wing Gavin Pierce transfers in from Hopkins. Joey Krouse and Luke Crosby will see guard minutes along with Vinny DeLuca. Jamison Lien and Luka Mortenson are other rotation guys.\n\nRosemount Irish (2021-22 season 17-11, 10-8 Conference, Tie 5th)\n\nThe Irish have to replace Caleb Siwek (21.2 PPG). He was a top 3 scorer in the league each of the last 3 seasons. St. Cloud St commit Anish Ramlall (14.6 PPG) looks to step into that role this season after a breakout season last year and a great summer. Rest of the guards are inexperienced. Carter Theisen (6 PPG), Collin Archer, Gavin Bass and Kyson Leenherts will make up the front court.\n\nShakopee Sabers (2021-22 season 25-4, 16-2 Conference, 1st)\n\nShakopee has to replace their full starting 5 with a very productive 2022 class graduating. That balanced group had 4 players in double figures. The guard rotation will be the strength with juniors Jalen Langsy and Isaac Snell. They both averaged 6.3 PPG last year. Expect both to be double figure scorers this season. Players like Tyler Boegeman will compete for the front court spots.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nLakeville North\n\nEastview\n\nLakeville South\n\nRosemount\n\nShakopee\n\nEagan\n\nFarmington\n\nBurnsville\n\nPrior Lake\n\nApple Valley\n\nConference Overview:\n\nLakeville North with their experience is the favorite here. Eastview reloads and is the easy pick for 2nd here. Lakeville South has experience at all spots and a group of talented junior wings to put them in the top half. After these 3, I see a group of mediocrity. Rosemount has experienced bigs and a really good guard in Anish Ramlall. That should be enough to overcome Shakopee's guard play. Eagan and Farmington have nice guard play as well and can compete for the top half. The bottom 3 are rebuilding with Prior Lake and Apple Valley losing a ton. That means I give Burnsville the nod due to having their lineup back.\n\nConference MVP: Nolan Winter - Lakeville North\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nJustin Cowan, Ja'khi Hollie - Apple Valley\n\nCole Wilcek, Nik Domier, Jonah Ask - Farmington\n\nLuke Loehlien - Prior Lake\n\nKavari Floewrs - Rosemount\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nEastview at Lakeville North - Jan 10th\n\nLakeville North at Eastview - Feb 14th\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nEast Ridge at Lakeville North - Dec 6th\n\nEastview at Eden Prairie - Dec 8th\n\nLakeville North vs Totino-Grace - Dec 10th (Tipoff Classic at Hopkins)\n\nEastview vs Wayzata - Dec 10th (Tipoff Classic at Hopkins)\n\nLakeville North at Wayzata - Dec 13th\n\nLakeville North vs Park Center - Dec 17th (Big Stage Classic at Osseo)\n\nEastview at Osseo - Dec 17th (Big Stage Classic)\n\nEastview at East Ridge - Dec 28th (East Ridge Holiday Tourney)\n\nEastview vs Cretin-Derham Hall - Dec 29th (East Ridge Holiday Tourney)\n\nEastview at Minnetonka - Jan 3rd\n\nLakeville North vs Eden Prairie - Jan 14th - (Hall of Fame Classic at ARCC)\n\nThis is the 12th preview in my 2022-2023 season preview series. In this preview, I continue my look at the local big schools with a look at the Suburban East Conference. For a list of all the season previews and how they were generated, click here.\n\nCretin-Derham Hall Raiders (2021-22 season 21-11, 12-6 Conference, 3rd)\n\nCoach Jerry Kline has to replace 4 of his top 5 scorers. That includes star PG Tre Holloman (19.7 PPG) and wing Donavhan Cain (18.6 PPG). Guards Adam Tauer and Miles Bollinger return along with forward Sam Koopmeiners to provide experience. Guard Luke Jacobsen transfers in from Andover along with a couple of talented Minneapolis South youngsters. Anthony Knight and Jake Little are other rotation options.\n\nEast Ridge Raptors (2021-22 season 23-6, 16-2 Conference, 1st)\n\nThe Raptors lose star guard Kendall Blue (19.6 PPG) but return a talented group behind that. U of Mary commit Alex Mattes (15.1 PPG), Peter Koland, Parker Wellman and frosh Cedric Tomes make up the backcourt. Junior forwards Charlie Bern and Charlie Theis are sneaky athletic with the ability to play in or out. Inside you have 2 big body options in juniors Brayden Carlson and St. Paul Johnson transfer Daejohn Thomas.\n\nForest Lake Rangers (2021-22 season 6-22, 3-15 Conference, 10th)\n\nShooter Nick Bartlett and his 18.1 PPG need to be replaced. Junior forward Owen Waldoch (19.4 PPG) is poised for another big season. Fellow juniors Nolan Dumonceaux (6.3 PPG) and Reid Olson return to the starting lineup as well. Guards Weston Hoyt and frosh DJ Westman saw rotation time last season. Noah Lukkason and Steve Babcock are forward options.\n\nIrondale Knights (2021-22 season 15-12, 9-9 Conference, 5th)\n\nIrondale was the top turnaround story of last season going from 1 win in the pandemic sesaon to 15 wins last season. Now they need to replace all 5 starters including 3 double figure scorers. Dane Dedominces (8.3 PPG), Cooper O'Brien and Max Herlofsky are the top returners. Tyler Smith, Thomas Westbrook and Jake Dedominces look to jump into guard spots of the rotation. Mekhi Edwards returns from CDH and will be a front line option.\n\nMounds View Mustangs (2021-22 season 16-12, 8-8 Conference, Tie 6th)\n\nMounds View needs to replace their guard duo of Kobe Kirk and Dylan Wheeler. They combined for 33.4 PPG last season. Guard Colby Deluce (10.3 PPG) and Jacob Becher lead the returning cast. Junior forwards Eli Roe and Joey Fretheim should see significant roles.\n\nPark Wolfpack (2021-22 season 20-9, 13-5 Conference, 2nd)\n\nA new era begins in Cottage Grove with 8 seniors, all 5 starters and coach Mike Weah needing to be replaced. The biggest loss is center Pharrell Payne and his nightly double-double that is now at Minnesota. Senior wing OT Omot (7.9 PPG) and PG David Ola-Kazeem are 2 notable players coming back. Tayvion Stewart provides another guard option. Henry Schluetter and Erik Lind will see minutes on the front line.\n\nRoseville Raiders (2021-22 season 6-21, 4-14 Conference, 9th)\n\nThe Raiders have to replace 3 of their top 4 scorers including wing Keyon Broussard (13.8 PPG). Forward Evan Fischer (10.2 PPG) will be this year's go-to guy. Khalid Abdi also returns on the front line. Owen Letts is a stretch 4 option in that group too. Juniors Ataa Mensah, William DeVries and Nate Hatteberg are guard options along with senior Isaac Ivy.\n\nStillwater Ponies (2021-22 season 13-14, 7-11 Conference, 8th)\n\nSenior point guard Max Shikenjanski (28.3 PPG) returns after leading the conference in scoring last season. Guard Tanner Thomson (13.6 PPG) returns as another perimeter scoring option. Juniors Joe Hoheisel and Brett Hilde will provide depth there. Junior forward Lake DeJongh transfers in after averaging 8.7 PPG at Somerset, WI last season. He'll team up with Tyler Wiese on the interior.\n\nWhite Bear Lake Bears (2021-22 season 15-13, 10-8 Conference, 4th)\n\nThe Bears return their entire starting lineup. That's led by the inside out duo of Jack Janicki (Wisconsin walk-on) and Wyatt Hawks. Janicki was 2nd in league scoring with 24.2 PPG on the wing. Hawks came out of nowhere to average 12.2 PPG and will play his college ball at St. Cloud State. He's the interior scorer but can step out as well. Jack Misgen (9 PPG) is the 3rd scoring option. Jeremy Kolb, Jack Setterlund and Brandon Ehlers all return to the perimeter rotation. Zach Nelson should see the backup minutes behind Hawks up front.\n\nWoodbury Royals (2021-22 season 11-16, 8-10 Conference, Tie 6th)\n\nCoach Kent Getzlaff needs to replace his leading scorer Blake Rohrer (17.4 PPG). Guard Cayden Narum (10 PPG) and forward Carter Bolin return to the starting lineup.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nEast Ridge\n\nWhite Bear Lake\n\nCretin-Derham Hall\n\nStillwater\n\nMounds View\n\nWoodbury\n\nForest Lake\n\nIrondale\n\nPark\n\nRoseville\n\nConference Overview:\n\nEast Ridge sticks out as the clear favorite here. White Bear Lake has everybody back and beat the Raptors at WBL last season. I picked them as my under the radar team of the season. CDH will be talented but don't be shocked if it takes them time to put it together as they integrate new pieces. Stillwater has plenty to talk about with Max Shikenjanski so I'll take them in the top half. Their 2 games vs White Bear Lake are appointment viewing. Mounds View will battle them for that spot with solid wing play. Woodbury and Forest Lake are in the next tier. Owen Waldoch could move Forest Lake up. Irondale and Park have to replace just about everything. Roseville has to replace their top player from last season and will try to stay out of the cellar.\n\nConference MVP: Jack Janicki - White Bear Lake Underclassmen to watch:\n\nJason Johnson, Monteff Dixon- Cretin-Derham Hall\n\nCedric Tomes - East Ridge\n\nDJ Westman - Forest Lake\n\nJake Dedominces - Irondale\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nCretin-Derham Hall at East Ridge- Dec 13th\n\nWhite Bear Lake at Stillwater - Dec 16th\n\nEast Ridge at White Bear Lake - Jan 3rd\n\nEast Ridge at Cretin-Derham Hall - Jan 27th\n\nStillwater at White Bear Lake - Feb 2nd\n\nWhite Bear Lake at East Ridge - Feb 10th\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nEast Ridge at Lakeville North - Dec 6th\n\nEast Ridge vs Osseo - Dec 10th (Tipoff Classic at Hopkins)\n\nCretin-Derham Hall vs Maple Grove - Dec 10th (Tipoff Classic at Hopkins)\n\nStillwater vs De La Salle - Dec 17th (Big Stage Classic at Osseo)\n\nEden Prairie at East Ridge - Dec 22nd\n\nEastview at East Ridge - Dec 28th (East Ridge Holiday Tourney)\n\nEast Ridge at Wayzata - Jan 31st\n\nWhite Bear Lake at Wayzata - Feb 23rd\n\nThis is the 11th preview in my 2022-2023 season preview series. Its the 3rd and final week of the preview series and that means its time for the big schools. Most of the teams this week will be AAAA schools. In this preview, a look at the Northwest Suburban Conference. For a list of all the season previews and how they are done, click here.\n\nAndover Huskies (2021-22 season 21-11, 13-6 Conference, Tie 1st North)\n\nThe Huskies look to once again represent section 7AAAA at state. 3 of the top 4 scorers return including the league's leading scorer Sam Musungu (21.6 PPG) and Concordia-St. Paul commit Ben Kopetzki (17 PPG) at guard spots. Landyn Nelson returns as well as a nice 3rd option. They do lose a ton of depth though. 6th man Luke Jacobson is now at Cretin-Derham Hall and their tallest 2 guys inside graduated. Tate Johnson and Von Strenge will look to fill those role spots.\n\nAnoka Tornadoes (2021-22 season 5-21, 2-17 Conference, 7th North)\n\nThe Tornadoes lose 3 of their 4 top scorers including guard Jay Nyamari (18.6 PPG). Junior forward AJ Howze (12.6 PPG) leads the returning cast. Reagan Reader joins him up front as the big guy inside. Soph guards Peyton Podany and Trey Borchers will have important roles. Senior Donald Prah will be the most experienced guard.\n\nBlaine Bengals (2021-22 season 7-20, 4-15 Conference, Tie 5th North)\n\nBlaine needs to replace 4 starters and 7 seniors from last season including AJ Kaul up front. Leading scorer Ethan Pettis (12.8 PPG) returns at the shooting guard spot. Guard Ryan Bohlman (7.9 PPG) and forward Zach Schusted (7.5 PPG) will move up into the starting lineup after being backups last season. Lots of inexperience after that. Juniors Jordan Lyon and Alvin Payne are youngsters who will contend for those other spots.\n\nCentennial Cougars (2021-22 season 7-20, 4-15 Conference, Tie 5th North)\n\nLook for a youth movement at Centennial with 5 of the top 6 scorers graduating. Juniors Ty Burgoon (8.5 PPG) and Will Quick (4.1 PPG) are the top returning scorers. Then there's soph Jack D'Agostino right behind them. Henry Pirner will provide the senior experience. Underclassmen from last year's JV such as Timmy Ball will make up most of the remaining minutes.\n\nChamplin Park Rebels (2021-22 season 5-21, 5-14 Conference, 4th North)\n\nThe Rebels have to replace most of their rotation. 2 double figure scorers and 8 seniors including Ayo Taki (15.4 PPG) have graudation . Junior guards Luke Graff (10.6 PPG) and Amory Peterson (3.4 PPG) are the top returnees. They'll get a boost from Park Center transfer Molley Kamara who should step right into the main interior spot. Micaiah Strong and Joesph Cummings appear to be guard options in the rotation.\n\nCoon Rapids Cardinals (2021-22 season 19-10, 10-9 Conference, 3rd North)\n\nCoach Mike Ogorek has to replace 4 of his 5 double figure scorers from last season. That adds up to over 52 PPG. Junior Khi-Hohnn Cummings-Coleman and his 15.7 PPG is the lead guy coming back. Jackson Hettwer and Griffin Thom are 2 experienced returnees in the rotation. Soph guard Marcus Bailey should see plenty of rotation time as well.\n\nElk River Elks (2021-22 season 14-13, 9-10 Conference, 4th West)\n\nGuard Cade Osterman (13.8 PPG) is the lone starter returning. He'll be the focus of the offense. Forward Carson Haack also returns after averaging double figures last year at 10.7 PPG. Jack Lachmiller is the only player returning to the rotation. The loss of PG Parker Behne (18.8 PPG) and PF Caleb Gillequist (8.3 PPG) leave 2 major holes that will be difficult to replace.\n\nMaple Grove Crimson (2021-22 season 14-13, 13-6 Conference, Tie 1st North)\n\nA pair of double figure scorers and 5 of the top 7 overall scorers need to be replaced. But the duo that is back is formidable. Center Lincoln Palbicki (9.2 PPG) and PG Raoul Vaidya (8.1 PPG) are both poised to jump into double figures this season. Senior wings Will Bauman and Jacob Anderson also return to the rotation. Then you add junior sniper Henry Stang to the mix. Not to mention a talented JV squad from last year to provide plenty of depth.\n\nOsseo Orioles (2021-22 season 22-7, 16-3 Conference, 3rd West)\n\nThe Orioles have to replace a deep and experienced senior class that included 4 players who averaged 9 PPG or more. Junior forward Isaiah Johnson is now at Totino-Grace. UMD commit Trey Smith (6.8 PPG) returns at a forward spot as the top returning scorer. The rest of the interior is a question mark. Minneapolis South will supply rotation replacements with PG De'Mari Larkins and soph wing Temo Omotoyinbo transferring in. Junior guards Ty Swanson and Timmy Denedo will step right in as solid options.\n\nPark Center Pirates (2021-22 season 31-1, 18-1 Conference, 1st West)\n\nThe AAAA state champs have to replace all 5 starters and are still a major threat to repeat. Chiang Ring (Minneapolis South) and CJ O'Hara (Hopkins) join Cash Chavis as players who transferred in. Chavis came over late last season from De La Salle. Junior wing Jackson Fowlkes is a sleeper who would be a major breakout candidate anywhere else except this loaded roster. JJ Ware, Kaden Cook and Joe Burgess are all rotation guys with Syoka Siko providing depth.\n\nRobbinsdale Armstrong Falcons (2021-22 season 13-15, 8-11 Conference, 5th West)\n\nThe Falcons have to replace leading scorer Peyton Newbern (15.5 PPG), PG Jamez Garner and C Payton Mogire. Newbern may be missed just as much for his defense, particularly drawing charges. Plenty left to work with on the roster. Seniors Owen Skram (9.2 PPG) and Drew Kuempel return to the lineup. The junior class is deep with Seth Newburn (9.9 PPG) and guard Gresyn Rennie plus forwards Fitz Freeman and Langden College. Soph guard Desmond Ware will see a ton of time as well.\n\nRogers Royals (2021-22 season 10-17, 7-12 Conference, Tie 6th West)\n\nRogers has to replace all 5 starters including guard Peyton Belka (17.3 PPG) and 3 other double figure scorers. Junior guard Blake Dalluge (5.3 PPG) is the top returnee. Fellow junior Jaxson Fuller will join him in the backcourt. Michael Watson and Wyatt Gilmore will be the main options inside.\n\nSpring Lake Park Panthers (2021-22 season 11-17, 7-12 Conference, Tie 6th West)\n\nAssistant Oliver Major takes over for long time coach Grant Guzy who retired. Payton Thomsen and Logan Kinsey each averaged over 19 PPG to finish 2nd and 3rd in league scoring. They've graduated leaving very little experience scoring behind. Senior center Beau Johnson (4.9 PPG) is the top returning scorer. Fellow seniors Freddie Anthony and Mikey Say figure to pick up some of that scoring slack on the wings.\n\nTotino-Grace Eagles (2020-21 season 26-6, 17-2 Conference, 2nd West)\n\nThe AAA state champs lose a couple of significant pieces but still are a heavy favorite to repeat. Ohio St commit Taison Chatman (13.5 PPG) runs the show. Furman commit Tommy Humphries (10.4 PPG) and forward Patrick Bath (12.8 PPG) also return to the starting lineup. Bath will take on more inside responsibility with Ahjany Lee now at the U of St. Thomas. Osseo transfer Isaiah Johnson will be another valuable front court piece. Junior guard Zy'lerre Stewart (4.5 PPG) is another important piece that allows the Eagles to give Chatman a breather from ball handling or defensive duties. Soph Tyler Wagner saw minutes last season. He looks to see more time this season.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nNorth Division\n\nAndover\n\nMaple Grove\n\nCoon Rapids\n\nChamplin Park\n\nBlaine\n\nAnoka\n\nCentennial\n\nWest Division\n\nTotino-Grace\n\nPark Center\n\nOsseo\n\nRobbinsdale Armstrong\n\nElk River\n\nSpring Lake Park\n\nRogers\n\nConference Overview:\n\nThe NW Suburban in boys hoops continues to make the the Big Ten football divisions look balanced. Last year the West division had a 40-9 record versus the North division in the crossover games. In the weaker north division I see Andover and Maple Grove neck and neck for that title. Then it drops off as everybody else in the division has major things to replace. Coon Rapids has the most stability left so I'll take them here. Blaine and Champlin Park battle for the next 2 spots, but Kamara coming in gives Champlin Park the edge. Anoka and Centennial are rebuilding with youth. I think Anoka is a year ahead in that process so I'll take them here.\n\nThen in the west you have the usual blood bath. Flip a coin for the epic battle between TG and PC and be happy with the result. Their 2 head to head meetings are appointment viewing. Osseo is the clear next in line followed by Armstrong. Then it drops down to Elk River who has losses but still has a couple pieces. Spring Lake Park plugs in enough from last year's JV to stay ahead of an inexperienced Rogers team.\n\nConference MVP: Taison Chatman - Totino-Grace\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nPeyton Podany, Trey Borchers - Anoka\n\nJack D'Agostino, Jacob Hosfield, Jackson Driessen - Centennial\n\nMarcus Bailey, Jaxon Young - Coon Rapids\n\nKeegan Harney - Maple Grove\n\nTemi Omotoyinbo - Osseo\n\nDesmond Ware - Robbinsdale Armstrong\n\nTyler Wagner, Chase Watley, Tian Chatman, Dothan Ijadimbola - Totino-Grace\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nTotino-Grace at Maple Grove - Jan 6th\n\nTotino-Grace at Park Center - Jan 12th\n\nPark Center at Totino-Grace - Feb 9th\n\nPark Center at Andover - Feb 21st\n\nTotino-Grace at Andover - Mar 3rd\n\nPark Center at Maple Grove - Mar 3rd\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nPark Center at De La Salle - Dec 8th\n\nTotino-Grace vs Lakeville North - Dec 10th (Tipoff Classic at Hopkins)\n\nPark Center vs Lakeville North - Dec 17th (Big Stage Classic at Osseo)\n\nHoly Family at Park Center - Dec 21st\n\nThis is the 10th preview in my 2022-2023 season preview series. Its now time for the big schools with the mostly class AAAA leagues are now on the list of previews. In this preview, a look at the league nobody wanted to win last year, the Metro West Conference. For a list of all the season previews and how they are done, click here.\n\nBenilde St. Margaret's Red Knights (2021-22 season 18-10, 13-5 Conference, 2nd)\n\nThe Red Knights have to replace 4 of their top 5 scorers. They'll reload from a loaded JV roster and with soph star Jalen Wilson (12.5 PPG). Juniors Jayden Daisy and Xavier Lumpkin will be the veterans of the group. Soph Abu Keita saw major rotation minutes last season on the front line as an active forward. Soph Jaleel Donley transfers in from Hopkins. He was a top varsity guy for Bloomington Kennedy as an 8th grader. They'll be young but no questions on the talent level.\n\nBloomington Jefferson Jaguars (2021-22 season 20-7, 14-4 Conference, 1st)\n\nCoach Jeff Evens can build around the state's top junior Daniel Freitag. The returning conference MVP averaged 26.7 PPG last season. He also had plenty of clutch moments leading the Jags to the league title. They also nicely incorporated Freitag in the post into their offense. Senior guard Blake Mamalakis-Linderman will provide shooting. Lefties Gavin Luick and soph Thomas Rowland can also knock down shots. Anthony Thorman provides the size and banging inside.\n\nChanhassen Storm (2021-22 season 15-12, 12-6 Conference, tie 3rd)\n\nJunior PG Max Woods (14.6 PPG) once again returns as the leading scorer. Braden Barger (9.2 PPG) is the other returning starter as a wing. Beyond that, they'll have to find offense. Grant Muffenbier will be in the rotation as well. A very solid and balanced JV squad will help supplement the rotation.\n\nChaska Hawks (2021-22 season 10-17, 9-9 Conference, Tie 6th)\n\nNick Hayes takes over the program after the retirement of longtime coach Dana Kallman. The top 3 scorers including their big front line of Brady Nicholson (23.2 PPG) and Jakobe Lyles (7.9 PPG) need to be replaced. Seniors Maddox Foss (7.7 PPG) and forward Dawson Reif (7.4 PPG) are the top returnees. Seniors Max Rain and Joey Born will be wing options. Soph Trey Lenzen one of the forward options.\n\nNew Prague Trojans (2021-22 season 4-23, 3-15 Conference, tie 9th)\n\nShooter Ethan Chromy (13.2 PPG) and forward Jaxon Short (12.6 PPG) need to be replaced along with guard Matt Kudrie. The perimeter spots will be the strength. PG Noah Washa (6.3 PPG) and wing Jacob Hemann (6.7 PPG) both return to the rotation. Nick Giesen will pick up more interior minutes.\n\nOrono Spartans (2021-22 season 21-8, 12-6 Conference, Tie 3rd)\n\nCoach Barry Wohler has to replace a pair of shooters in Sebastian Loder (15.7 PPG) and Jake Farrell (11.1 PPG). He still has plenty to work with. Guard Isaiah Hagen (18.7 PPG) was the team scoring leader and can play on or off the ball. Kyle Kallenbach (10.1 PPG) and Grant Gunderson are experienced guards. Zach Close and Riley Nelson return as front line options. Soph Brady Wooley could also see time as a stretch forward.\n\nSt. Louis Park Orioles (2021-22 season 10-17, 4-14 Conference, 8th)\n\nGuard Stefano Giovannelli (11.3 PPG) is the only 1 of 4 double figure scorers from last year that is coming back. Junior Keegan Hartford will have the point guard duties. Antonio Speed will be the top front line option. Very little else coming back to the rotation.\n\nWaconia Wildcats (2021-22 season 12-15, 9-9 Conference, tie 6th)\n\nThe Wildcats need to replace 4 starters including 3 of their top 4 scorers. They do return a strong wing duo in Ty Miller (11.5 PPG) and Jackson Hayes (4.6 PPG). Freshman Will Kirsch should run the point. He's started at Holy Family last season. Matt Hedtke will see guard minutes. Chris Fulford is a front court option.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nOrono\n\nBloomington Jefferson\n\nBenilde-St. Margaret's\n\nChanhassen\n\nWaconia\n\nChaska\n\nSt. Louis Park\n\nNew Prague\n\nConference Overview\n\nI had long predicted more change had to happen with the Metro West and sure enough it happens this season. Robbinsdale Cooper and Bloomington Kennedy are both off to the Tri-Metro. That brings the league size down a perfect 8 teams. I see 2 top groups with a drop off to the remaining 3. I like Orono's experience and depth to win i. Jefferson will be right there with Freitag and the shooters around him. Benilde-St. Margaret's youth keeps them third. Waconia and Chanhassen will battle for the last spot in the top half as a dangerous second tier. Chaska is rebuilding but has the most coming back so I default them to sixth. St. Louis Park and New Prague are rebuilding.\n\nConference MVP: Daniel Freitag - Bloomington Jefferson\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nJalen Wilson, Abu Keita, Jaleel Donley, Christian Wiggins - Benilde-St. Margaret's\n\nThomas Rowland - Bloomington Jefferson\n\nTrey Lenzen - Chaska\n\nBrady Wooley - Orono\n\nWill Kirsch - Waconia\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nOrono at Bloomington Jefferson - Jan 27th\n\nOrono at Benilde-St. Margaret's - Jan 30th\n\nBloomington Jefferson at Orono - Feb 21st\n\nBloomington Jefferson at Benilde-St. Margaret's - Feb 24th\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nHopkins at Orono - Dec 2nd\n\nBloomington Jefferson vs TBD - Dec 10th (Tipoff Classic at Hopkins)\n\nBenilde-St. Margaret's at De La Salle - Dec 20th\n\nThis is the 9th preview in my 2022-2023 season preview series. This preview is for the Metro East Conference. For a list of all the season previews and an explanation of how the previews are generated, click here.\n\nHastings Raiders (2021-22 season 5-22, 4-12 Conference, 7th)\n\nHastings is looking at another year of building toward the future. Senior Kelvin Maher and junior guard Owen Bernatz (13.2 PPG) are the top returnees. Junior forward Kellen Nuytten will also be an offensive option.\n\nHill-Murray Pioneers (2021-22 season 2-25, 0-16 Conference, 9th)\n\nThe Pioneers rebuild continues as they have to replace 4 starters. That includes 12 PPG from center Eddie Reece. Soph wing Xavier Daniels (11.7 PPG) will be the focus of the offense. Guards Bennett Nicholson and Joe McGurran will also be counted upon for scoring. Junior Gavin Berg also returns to the rotation.\n\nMahtomedi Zephyrs (2021-22 season 18-8, 11-5 Conference, tie 2nd)\n\nMahtomedi is poised to make some noise this season. They return their top 5 scorers from last season. That includes Owen Carlson (23 PPG) and Cole Armitage (13.5 PPG). Plus PG Will Underwood (23.6 PPG in 20-21) returns from injury after he basically missed all of last season. They are loaded at the perimeter spots with shooting and experience. Size would be the 1 question for this roster.\n\nNorth Polars (2021-22 season 4-23, 3-13 Conference, 8th)\n\nNSP has to replace most of the roster after a down season. That includes 6 top scorers led by Jevon Jackson's 10.8 PPG. Junior Aidan Hammond is part of that list after transferring to Stillwater. Junior Jazayah Gate (3.9 PPG) is about the only piece remaining. Doreon Ceaser will be an interior option.\n\nSt. Thomas Academy Cadets (2021-22 season 16-12, 9-7 Conference, 5th)\n\nBig man Nathan Johnson and his team high 16.4 PPG is the lone loss. There are guards upon guards upon guards for coach Khalid El-Amin. Michael Kirchner (15.1 PPG) and Jack Chamberlain (11.7 PPG) are the 2 who averaged double digits last year. Michael Thompson is the 3rd of that group of senior guards who will be seeing their 4th year on varsity. Soph guard Isa El-Amin came up huge in their playoff game vs arch rival Two Rivers. Junior guard Luke Dobbs averaged 8.7 PPG. Tate Hinkemeyer is the lone returnee with size.\n\nSimley Spartans (2021-22 season 18-8, 10-6 Conference, 4th)\n\nThe Spartans have to replace guards RJ Jioklow (17.3 PPG) and Devin Robinson plus their top interior forward Kevin Wormer (10.3 PPG). Senior lefty Kayden Reid (13.5 PPG) and junior Deoviez Williams (10.7 PPG) are the top returnees. Connor Binley and Dezmond Smith saw reserve roles with JV time last year. They'll have increased roles this season. Justin Klint gives them a shooter in the rotation.\n\nSouth St. Paul Packers (2021-22 season 28-1, 16-0 Conference, 1st)\n\nAssistant Darren Edwards took over the program midway thru last season and he keeps the job. That's after the in-season resignation and then offseason death of former coach Matt McCollister. So its with a very heavy heart that the Packers replace almost their entire rotation. Forward America Fitch returns along with a talented and young JV squad. Junior Gavin Pendergast leads that group. They also pickup Elonzo and De'Vaun Simmons who were double figure scorers at St. Agnes last season.\n\nTartan Titans (2021-22 season 21-7, 11-5 Conference, tie 2nd)\n\nThe Titans have to replace all 5 starters including 3 double figure scorers. That means a trio of juniors will lead the way. Forwards Brody Radtke and Elijah Barrett will be the main scoring threats. Radtke is a stretch 4 while Barrett is more of an interior threat. Marino Porter will run the show and be the typical Tartan defensive pest on the ball.\n\nTwo Rivers Warriors (2021-22 season 16-10, 8-8 Conference, 6th)\n\nThe double figures perimeter duo of Jaden Morgan (14.4 PPG) and Tre Michaels (11 PPG) needs to be replaced. Morgan is now at De La Salle. Junior forward Max Mogelson (9.8 PPG) and wing Carson Christiansen (8.5 PPG) return to the starting lineup. Thomas Lutz and Keesaun Powell were rotation players last year as well. Center Davion Long provides length and a defensive presence inside. Soph Ramzi Rislove will see plenty of time at the point guard spot.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nMahtomedi\n\nTartan\n\nSt. Thomas Academy\n\nSouth St. Paul\n\nSimley\n\nTwo Rivers\n\nNorth\n\nHastings\n\nHill-Murray\n\nConference Overview\n\nMahtomedi is the heavy favorite here with a ton coming back and getting Will Underwood back for a full season. Tartan gets my nod for 2nd with 3 solid juniors coming back and their tradition. St. Thomas Academy will give them a run with their experience. South St. Paul is talented enough, but will experience be an issue for them? Adding the Simmons brothers is a huge boost to that question plus their perimeter defense. Simley will be a solid middle team. Then Two Rivers needs to find scoring with the loss of Jaden Morgan. The bottom 3 are in rebuild mode.\n\nConference MVP: Will Underwood - Mahtomedi\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nKyan Esterby, Lukas Foss - Hastings\n\nXavier Daniels - Hill-Murray\n\nJerror Borsay - North St. Paul\n\nTerry Carter, Devin Sutherland, Keishon Jarman, Sincere McCampbell - South St. Paul\n\nIsa El-Amin - St. Thomas Academy\n\nRamzi Rislove, Mason Boyken - Two Rivers\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nSt. Thomas Academy at Mahtomedi - Jan 10th\n\nTartan at Mahtomedi - Jan 31st\n\nMahtomedi at St. Thomas Academy - Feb 7th\n\nMahtomedi at Tartan - Feb 28th\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nTartan at Richfield - Dec 9th\n\nMahtomedi vs Stewartville - Dec 10th (Tipoff Classic at Hopkins)\n\nMahtomedi at Stillwater - Dec 20th\n\nMahtomedi at Minnehaha - Jan 14th\n\nThis is the 8th preview in my 2022-2023 season preview series. In this preview, its a look at the Minneapolis City Conference. For a list of all the season previews, click here.\n\nEdison Tommies (2021-22 season 13-12, 3-9 Conference, 5th)\n\nEdison has to replace almost 20 PPG from guard Liban Tushar. Senior forward Micah Young (20.6 PPG) returns and looks to be one of the top scorers in the metro this season. PG Deidrick Taylor and his 10.2 PPG returns to run the show. Guard Damari Lalley and forward Ahmed Hassan are experienced returnees. Guard Eli Jones also is back in the rotation.\n\nNorth Polars (2021-22 season 27-7, 12-0 Conference, 1st)\n\nLegendary coach Larry McKenzie has retired from North. Former NBA star Ricky Davis takes over the storied program. While he has to replace all 5 starters and 9 seniors, he still has plenty to work with. Zashon Rich (8.4 PPG) and AuVon Sager (7 PPG) return in the front court. Lefty PG Datrell McCrimmon has been the PG in waiting. He now gets his opportunity to run the team after being a valuable reserve last season. Wing Jakari Miamen also saw minutes last season. Max Wilson joins the roster from Hopkins. He'll fill both guard slots and provide valuable shooting.\n\nPatrick Henry Patriots (2021-22 season 9-15, 2-9 Conference, 6th)\n\nHenry needs to replace their top duo of Karon Abdullah and Ajani McRae. Soph Eban Moua returns at the point guard spot. Juzavious Dickerson will be the main inside threat. Zatayvion Hawkins and Josh Murff will be other rotation options.\n\nRoosevelt Teddies (2021-22 season 2-20, 0-10 Conference, 7th)\n\nJunior wing Avery Wells was the top scoring threat and only double figure scorer for the Teddies. He's now at Richfield. The rest of the starting lineup needs to be replaced too. Not much scoring punch from the rest of the roster. Looks like another long year for the Teddies.\n\nSouth Tigers (2021-22 season 18-7, 9-2 Conference, 2nd)\n\nThe AAU bug has bitten the Tigers as their MN Spartans laden roster has now spread out to a bunch of places. Cretin-Derham Hall, Minnehaha, Park Center and Osseo are the recipients. Junior wing Poet Davis appears to be the only piece remaining. He averaged 11.7 PPG last season. That average should increase dramatically as he'll have to create the Tigers offense. Last year those points were largely catch and shoot corner 3s. Christian Henderson is an interior option.\n\nSouthwest Lakers (2021-22 season 14-12, 7-5 Conference, tie 3rd)\n\nCoach Keenan Shelton has to replace 10 seniors and most of his scoring from last season. He'll rebuild the rotation around junior Liam Farniok. He averaged 10.1 PPG last season and is one of the top shooters in the league. Caden Sullivan returns as a swiss army knife wing. Dillon Engen returns at a guard spot. They'll need to step up their offensive roles. No other experience returns.\n\nWashburn Millers (2021-22 season 13-11, 7-5 Conference, tie 3rd)\n\nAlumnus Myles Sheppard takes over the program. He has to replace 7 of the top 8 scorers from last season. Big man Cass Ramberg (11.5 PPG) along with guards Jake Husaby (10.8 PPG) and Donnavan Smith (10.2 PPG) are the 3 double figure scorers that have graduated. The Millers will build around junior forward Kyle Jorgensen and his 11.2 PPG. He's one of better bigs in Minnesota's 2024 class and can play inside along with range at the 3 point line. Cade Heinemann and Blake Bergren will be solid replacements for the lost seniors. Evan Young, Aiden Jacobson and Charlie Gustafson look to see guard minutes. Calvin Gilhoi should see front court minutes.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nNorth\n\nWashburn\n\nEdison\n\nSouthwest\n\nSouth\n\nHenry\n\nRoosevelt\n\nConference Overview\n\nJust about every team in the league has a major retooling of the roster to do. I'll still take Minneapolis North here until their 72 game league winning streak ends. I think Henry has enough to stay out of the cellar from Roosevelt. In the middle, you have a jumble of teams. Those teams all have 1 notable scorer and lots of questions behind that. Despite a new coach, I think Washburn puts it together with just enough pieces. South goes to the bottom of that list due to the lack of experience and a totally different system.\n\nConference MVP: Max Wilson - North\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nEban Moua - Henry\n\nSteven Hunter, Obie Esperaza - Roosevelt\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nNorth at Washburn - Jan 23rd\n\nWashburn at North - Feb 15th\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nNorth vs Lake City - Dec 10th (Tipoff Classic at Hopkins)\n\nNorth at De La Salle - Dec 22nd\n\nNorth at East Ridge - Feb 7th\n\nWayzata at North - Feb 25th\n\nThis is the 7th preview in my 2022-2023 season preview series. Now that the private schools are mostly covered, its on to public schools. We start with the city leagues and St. Paul goes first. For a list of all the season previews and how they are generated, click here.\n\nCentral Minutemen (2021-22 season 11-15, 8-4 Conference, 3rd)\n\nThe Minutemen need to replace most of their rotation from last season. Soph guard Allen Lankfard (12.9 PPG) is one of the league's top returning players. Senior Jack Augustine gives them a solid option inside. PJ Blakey and Eliezer Lopez-Henriquez are rotation options as well. The JV squad won the league last year and will provide solid options.\n\nComo Park Cougars (2021-22 season 16-10, 10-2 Conference, 2nd)\n\nComo Park has a big task ahead replacing their dynamic forward duo of Donavan Clinton and Amir Plair. They were 1st and 3rd respectively in league scoring last season. They'll build around junior forward Mason Aarness (8 PPG) and Levi Nichols. Lots of inexperience behind those 2 as 10 seniors have graduated.\n\nHarding Knights (2021-22 season 6-21, 4-8 Conference, 5th)\n\nThe Knights return 4 of 5 starters and a couple of reserves. Forward Paul Walker (10.2 PPG) is the lone double figure scorer. Soph PG Ai'jhon Douglas, Vell Benjamin and Robert Htoo return at the guard spots. They'll be other top offensive options.\n\nHighland Park Scots (2021-22 season 8-19, 6-6 Conference, 4th)\n\nHighland Park returns just about everybody from last year's roster. Junior forward Xavier May leads the way as the top returning scorer in the league. He averaged 18.1 PPG in league play last year. Senior wing Ishmael Powell is another double figure scoring threat. Juniors Andrew Bacigalupi and Quintice Combs also return to the starting lineup. Seniors Dillon Foster and Terez McDaniel-Vaughn also return to the rotation.\n\nHumboldt Hawks (2021-22 season 2-23, 0-12 Conference, 7th)\n\nSam Esboldt takes over the Humboldt program. Guard Jorge Irizarry (15.3 PPG) returns to leads the Hawks attack. Angelo Wilson and Endale Witt also return to the rotation. Kuyu Mohammed rereturns inside.\n\nJohnson Governors (2021-22 season 16-6, 12-0 Conference, 1st)\n\nJohnson has to replace their top 3 scorers. Wing Ishmael David was the 4th leading scorer in the league last year at 14.6 PPG in conference games. Junior forward Daejohn Thomas was a top 5 returning scorer in the conference and arguably the league's top inside threat. He's now at East Ridge. Guard Christian Jones and forward Rickhi Graham also need to be replaced. Dhimani Tucker and Ka'jon Jordan return at the guard spots.\n\nWashington Eagles (2021-22 season 5-20, 2-10 Conference, 6th)\n\nThe Eagles return 3 of their top 4 scorers from last season that includes Ty Allen and Chris Birdsong at the guard spots. Both averaged double figures last season. Not much size but there is experience.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nHighland Park\n\nJohnson\n\nCentral\n\nHarding\n\nHumboldt\n\nComo Park\n\nWashington\n\nConference Overview:\n\nHighland Park gets my nod here with most of the roster coming back. Johnson will still be there but the loss of Daejohn Thomas inside takes them out of the top spot. Central loses most of their rotation but their JVs won the league last year and they traditionally reload. Harding has the most coming back of the rest but they aren't at that level. Sam Esboldt will keep Humboldt out of another trip to the cellar. Como Park loses a ton and will battle Washington to stay out of the basement.\n\nConference MVP: Xavier May - Highland Park\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nAllan Lankford - Central\n\nAi'john Douglas - Harding\n\nDanny Hobday, Tes Sturm - Humboldt\n\nKenneth Turner - Johnson\n\nMalakhi Bergman - Washington\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nJohnson at Highland Park - Jan 12th\n\nCentral at Highland Park - Jan 24th\n\nCentral at Johnson - Jan 26th\n\nHighland Park at Johnson - Feb 7th\n\nHighland Park at Central - Feb 17th\n\nJohnson at Central - Feb 22nd\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nJohnson at Hiawatha - Dec 10th\n\nHiawatha at Central - Dec 16th\n\nCentral vs Bloomington Jefferson - Dec 20th (at Hamline)\n\nHighland Park at South St. Paul - Dec 21st\n\nMinnehaha at Johnson - Feb 4th\n\nCentral at South St. Paul - Feb 4th\n\nThis is the 6th preview in my 2022-2023 season preview series.

For a list of all the season previews and how they are generated, click here.\n\nAcademy of Holy Angels Stars (2021-22 season 10-17, 5-7 Conference, Tie 4th)\n\nThe Stars have to replace their top 2 scorers in forward Rob Issa (18.8 PPG) and guard Emmett Johnson (11.9 PPG, Nebraska football). AJ Boarman (9.4 PPG) is the top returning scorer and inside presence. Jaylen Peterson (7.3 PPG) returns on the wing. Mason Scroggins returns at a guard spot. George Dittman, Adam Akerson and Damian Devine also return to the rotation.\n\nBloomington Kennedy Eagles (2021-22 season 6-19, 3-15 Metro West Conference, tie 9th)\n\nThe Eagles join the Tri-Metro with big holes to fill. They lose most of their firepower from last season. That includes forwards Chris Martin and Dalton Smazal. The senior trio of PG Tajon Pearson plus forwards Ramone Walker and Marques Monroe should lead the way. Forward Rayzjon Walker and soph Larmarrius Starr should also see rotation time. Former Mayer Lutheran and Apple Valley head coach Pat Buchanan takes over the program. He gets a late start after being hired in early October.\n\nBrooklyn Center Centaurs (2021-22 season 3-19, 0-12 Conference, 7th)\n\nSenior wing Quayvant Douglas (25 PPG) should have another huge season. But the help around him remains the question. Forward CJ Taylor and Antoine Jones are also scoring options for the Centaurs. DeShawn Pongsak and Steven Nzimi will see interior minutes. Tayvionte Powell will run the show.\n\nColumbia Heights Hylanders (2021-22 season 23-1, 11-0 Conference, 1st)\n\nThe Hylanders had the unfortunate draw of having state champ Totino-Grace in their section. That was their only loss of the season. Now they have to replace most of the rotation. Wing Muja Burton and PG Terrence Brown need to be replaced after averaging over 22 PPG each. Donnavin Hinsz (11.2 PPG) also needs to be replaced inside. Junior PG Jency Davis (9.8 PPG) will run the show as the top returnee. Martez Wise and Leavale Hicks are other top options. Boona Morke will be in the interior option. Wing Randy McClendon joins the lineup after playing at De La Salle last season.\n\nDe La Salle Islanders (2021-22 season 22-8, 10-1 Conference, 2nd, Class AAA runner up)\n\nLong time assistant Todd Anderson takes over the program after Travis Beldsoe took the head coaching job at Anoka-Ramsey Community College. He'll have Lehigh commit Nasir Whitlock (22.9 PPG) to run the show. Wing Israel Moses (7.2 PPG), forward PJ Pounds, Riley Blaylark, Ray James and Myles Dillon-Parks also return to the rotation. They'll miss the shooting of Kyle Johnson (12.5 PPG). Junior Justin Johnson could step right into that role. Junior wing Jaden Morgan transfers in after he averaged 14.4 PPG at Two Rivers last season.\n\nFridley Tigers (2021-22 season 10-16, 5-7 Conference, Tie 4th)\n\nFridley has to replace their inside out duo of guard Eli Nelsen (12.3 PPG) and forward Devin Williams (11.9 PPG). Guards Antwan Smith (10.6 PPG) and MJ Newton will lead the offense. Bronell Marcus, CJ Powell and Gideon Cooper also return to the rotation.\n\nRichfield Spartans (2021-22 season 13-13, 7-5 Conference, 3rd)\n\nCoach Omar McMillan has to replace 4 starters who combined for 60 PPG last season. That includes the inside out duo of PG Jaden Wollmuth and PG Mitchell January who both averaged over 18 PPG. Soph guard CJ Armstrong (7.9 PPG) is the top returning option. Seniors Tyler Jake, Jaylen Hollins and Kaleb Olson return to the rotation. They also get Mankato East transfers Jalen and Zavier Hayes. Jalen Hayes was a significant part of the Mankato East trip to state last year so expect him to be a major factor for the Spartans. Wing Avery Wells also joins the roster after being the top scorer at Minneapolis Roosevelt last season.\n\nRobbinsdale Cooper Hawks (2021-22 season 15-10, 11-7 Metro West Conference, 5th)\n\nCooper is the other former Metro West member to join the Tri-Metro this season. Coach Bo Powell has to replace his top 2 options in all everything guard Davion Evans (24.2 PPG) and forward Prince Appiah (9.7 PPG). Guard Sam Massaquoi (8.4 PPG) and forward Michael Cooper (7.2 PPG) look to step into those roles. Jamin Cook and Chance Wicks will be guard options. DeShawn Ricks and Andre Woods are interior options.\n\nSt. Anthony Huskies (2021-22 season 8-19, 3-9 Conference, 6th)\n\nFormer Huskies star Josh Pratt takes over the program. He has a pair solid guards to build around in seniors Nathan Lucas (12.2 PPG) and Caydin Hauser (11.7 PPG). Kenji Asai (8.5 PPG) returns on a wing. Joe Randle (6.1 PPG) returns as the top interior option. Caden Rodkewich, Alex Igherighe and soph G Braden Siroin all return to the rotation as well. It will be a guard laden lineup which should fit coach Pratt's style of play well.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nDe La Salle\n\nRichfield\n\nRobbinsdale Cooper\n\nColumbia Heights\n\nSt. Anthony\n\nHoly Angels\n\nFridley\n\nBloomington Kennedy\n\nBrooklyn Center\n\nConference MVP: Nasir Whitlock - De La Salle\n\nConference Overview:\n\nBloomington Kennedy and Robbinsdale Cooper move into the conference from the Metro West. I'm looking forward to the Cooper vs Columbia Heights games. De La Salle may have a new coach but otherwise don't expect much to change. They are my favorite here with Nasir Whitlock poised for a monster season. Heavy losses behind them. Richfield, Heights and Cooper will all have athletes and cause havoc for the rest of the league. Richfield has the most experience and a good duo of Armstrong and Hayes. Cooper and Heights battle for the next spot. Cooper gets the nod with their experience but Heights will be right there. St. Anthony jumps up with most everybody coming back and the rest of the league having heavy losses. Holy Angels best of the rest. Then it drops off to the bottom 3.\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nDamian Devine - Holy Angels\n\nLamarrius Starr - Kennedy\n\nQuaylin Hardrict, Julian Manjo - Columbia Heights\n\nDarius Irvin, De'von Irvin, Dorian Pruitt, Marcus Anderson - De La Salle\n\nCJ Armstrong - Richfield\n\nBraden Siroin - St. Anthony\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nDe La Salle at Richfield - Jan 26th\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nPark Center at De La Salle - Dec 8th\n\nDe La Salle vs Minnetonka - Dec 10th at Hopkins (Tipoff Classic)\n\nDe La Salle vs Stillwater - Dec 17th at Osseo (Breakdown Big Stage)\n\nBenilde-St. Margaret's at De La Salle - Dec 20th\n\nDe La Salle at Wayzata - Feb 28th\n\nThis is the 5th preview in my 2022-2023 season preview series. I conclude week 1 with a look at the Independent Metro Athletic Conference (IMAC). For a list of all the season previews and how they are done, click here.\n\nBlake Bears (2021-22 season 20-7, 6-3 Conference, 3rd)\n\nLefty wing Theo Liu and his 20.4 PPG is a major piece to replace. Junior guard Grayson Okoronkwo (19.9 PPG) will carry the offense. Junior Dane Borene (5.6 PPG) and soph Ian Schnabel lead the front line along with Jack Griffin. Sophs Kris Baker (7.7 PPG) and Drew Dillon will be important perimeter pieces.\n\nBreck Mustangs (2021-22 season 11-16, 3-6 Conference, tie 4th)\n\nFormer Apple Valley player Harry Sonie takes over the program. Senior forwards Waziri Lawal (14.5 PPG) and Will Walker (14 PPG) make up a strong front line with junior Kevin Armstrong (10.5 PPG). Plenty of youth to go with them. Sophs Teddy Koch and Miles Newton and frosh DeAngelo Dungey saw plenty of time. Frosh JP Musoke transfers in after being a major piece at Eagle Ridge last season. The shooting of Jimmy Koch (13.7 PPG) will be missed.\n\nMinnehaha Academy Redhawks (2021-22 season 19-11, 4-0 Conference, 1st)\n\nBoston College commit Prince Aligbe and his 29.4 PPG need to be replaced. He was a monster after PG Mercy Miller departed mid-season. At that point the Redhawks went with a youth movement with everybody else coming back. Senior Leroy Barnes is the lone double figure scorer coming back (10.3 PPG). Rolyns Aligbe anchors the interior with his 7.8 PPG. Point guards Jerome Williams (16.2 PPG at Mpls South) and Lorenzo Levy (20.3 PPG at Concordia) transfer in. They can both run the show or knock down shots off the ball.\n\nMounds Park Academy Panthers (2021-22 season 3-19, 0-8 Conference, 6th)\n\nThe Panthers return their entire roster from last sesaon. They are led by a trio of junior guards. Trey Kent-Landrum (17.1 PPG) and Micah Hudock (15.1 PPG) are the shooting guards. Jay Green (6.7 PPG) runs the point. Gabe Messner is the top returnee on the front line at 6.9 PPG.\n\nProvidence Academy Lions (2021-22 season 20-9, 8-1 Conference, 2nd)\n\nProvidence needs to replace its 3 double figure scorers from last year. Guards Jimmy Fafinski and Liam Carney combined for 32.5 PPG. They also lose the inside outside threat of big man Mark McCarthy (13.4 PPG). Senior forwards Alvin Mokua (8.8 PPG) and Dylan Perrill (8 PPG) are the top returnees. Limited experience returns after those 2. Luke Wachholz is the top returning guard.\n\nSt. Paul Academy Spartans (2021-22 season 16-10, 3-6 Conference, tie 4th)\n\nSPA loses 4 starters. That includes their 2 starting forwards and top 2 scorers at the guards spots. Twin shooters Brandt and Clarke Baskerville combined for over 28 PPG last season. Junior wings Ethan Carter (12.2 PPG) and Tysen Hayes (10.1 PPG) will be the top options for the Spartans. Soph forward Nathan Rock should see plenty of front court minutes.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nMinnehaha\n\nBreck\n\nBlake\n\nSt. Paul Academy\n\nProvidence\n\nMounds Park Academy\n\nConference Overview\n\nMinnehaha is still the heavy favorite here. Breck clearly the most talented of the rest. Blake and SPA will battle for the 3rd spot. Providence too inexperienced to break thru that. Mounds Park Academy continues to rebuild.\n\nConference MVP: Jerome Williams - Minnehaha\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nKris Baker, Ian Schnabel, Drew Dillon - Blake\n\nTeddy Koch, Miles Newton, DeAngelo Dungey, JP Musoke - Breck\n\nFitta Jafar, Marcus Horton, George Norsman- Minnehaha\n\nAdnaan Said - Mounds Park Academy\n\nNathan Rock - St. Paul Academy\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nBreck at Minnehaha - Dec 9th\n\nMinnehaha at Breck - Jan 27th\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nCherry at Minnehaha - Dec 17th\n\nBreck at Holy Family - Jan 10th\n\nMahtomedi at Minnehaha - Jan 14th\n\nMinnehaha at Holy Family - Jan 16th\n\nHiawatha at Minnehaha - Jan 17th\n\nMinnehaha vs New Life - Jan 21st at Hiawatha\n\nBreck at New Life - Mar 3rd\n\nThis is the fourth preview in my 2022-23 season preview series. Now we move up to a league that is mostly AA. Let's start with a look at the Skyline Conference. For a list of all the season previews and how they are done, click here.\n\nConcordia Academy Beacons (2021-22 season 16-13, 9-6 Conference, tie 3rd)\n\nThe Beacons return the league's leading scorer AJ Greene (23.6 PPG). He'll take on an even bigger load with the league's 2nd leading scorer Lorenzo Levy (20.3 PPG) transferring to Minnehaha. So expect the lefty Greene to have the ball in his hands most of the time like he did 2 years ago. Who becomes the 2nd scorer? There are plenty of experienced guard candidates in Luc Swanson (8.8 PPG), Ben Raymond (8.6 PPG) and junior Luke Olson. Josh Ortiz returns inside.\n\nCristo Rey Jesuit Pumas (2021-22 season 2-25, 1-14 Conference, 8th)\n\nCoach Stan Clay had a very young roster last year that took it lumps due to injury and inexperience. Leading scorer BJ Hollowell (12.6 PPG) needs to be replaced. But after that there's a talented junior class. Corey Dotson (11.7 PPG) and Patrick Akoussan (10.8 PPG) are athletic wing types who will be their biggest players. Miles Nelson (7.8 PPG) will run the show. Add in soph Omar Whitaker (6.3 PPG) and senior Dashoune Campbell (5.4 PPG) to the rotation as well. They won't be big and not much depth, but definitely a group that can take a big step forward.\n\nMaranatha Christian Academy Mustangs (2021-22 season 23-7, 14-1 Conference, tie 1st)\n\nFormer Eagan assistant Ervin Bryant takes over the program. He has to replace the shooting and scoring of Jeremiah LaVelle (20.2 PPG). Plenty of experience returns. Guard Bailey McDonald (14.2 PPG) will take over the offense as lone returning double figure scorer. They have interchangeable athletic worker forward types in JaRory Purnell (7 PPG) and Nick Anderson (5.5 PPG). Guards Matthew (6.4 PPG) and Isaiah Bluford (4.5 PPG) return along with Drew Balentine (6.3 PPG).\n\nNew Life Academy Eagles (2021-22 season 28-4, 14-1 Conference, Tie 1st)\n\nThe Eagles return all but 1 player from last year's state qualifier. That 1 player lost is an important one in shooter Kollin Kaemingk (15.9 PPG). Its a very experienced group of seniors. Forward Erick Reader (13.5 PPG) and PG Max Briggs (12.1 PPG) will lead the offense. Austin Woolf (10.7 PPG) and Tyler Huebsch (6 PPG) also return to the starting lineup. Colton Hendricks, Tyler Wall and Gavin Bertram also return to the rotation.\n\nNova Classical Academy Knights (2021-22 season 7-21, 0-9 Conference, 9th)\n\nCoach John Carrier's rebuilding effort continues as he has to replace 3 senior starters. That includes top 2 scorers Liam Borrell (13.6 PPG) and Spencer Frost (9.8 PPG). Juniors Silas Revenaugh (8.5 PPG at center) and Alex Ehlerbracht (6.8 PPG) are the top returning offensive options. Mason Engelking, Manny Deroos, Omeed Tabrizi and Henry Peklo will be other rotation pieces.\n\nSt. Agnes Aggies (2021-22 season 18-10, 8-7 Conference, 5th)\n\nThe Aggies looked to have their entire starting lineup returning. But De'Vaun Simmons (19.6 PPG) and Elonzo Simmons (14.1 PPG) have transferred to South St. Paul. They were the top 2 scorers and the point of the Aggies pressure defense. So expect a different look this season. An experienced bench clan also needs to be replaced. Junior SG Andrew Weber (11.2 PPG) is the lone returning double figure scorer. Wing Paul Plasch (8.9 PPG) and soph forward Nolan Davis (8.4 PPG) are the other returnees to the starting lineup. Daniel Koontz is returning depth inside.\n\nSt. Croix Lutheran Crusaders (2021-22 season 7-21, 5-10 Conference, 6th)\n\nLeading scorer Omarion Miller (13.9 PPG) needs to be replaced. Junior PG Jaden Neish (12.5 PPG) is the top returning scorer. The rest of the rotation is a bunch of experienced seniors plus junior Elias Blumer. Blumer along with seniors Matej Brugos and Si Gawrisch are the options for who becomes the top secondary scorer. Evan Valleau returns to the starting lineup in a forward spot.\n\nSt. Croix Prep Lions (2021-22 season 14-13, 9-6 Conference, tie 3rd)\n\nThe Lions have to replace their lone double figure scorer from last year. That's guard Peyton Gremmels who averaged 14.5 PPG. Senior PG Bjorn Benson is the top returning scorer at 9.6 PPG. Most of the rest of the rotation returns as well. Seniors Christian Nelson (7.9 PPG) and Cade Hanson (7.5 PPG) lead that group. Guards Ben Myers and Patrick Brown also saw significant minutes as underclassmen last season.\n\nTrinity Tri-Hawks (2021-22 season 13-15, 5-11 Conference, 7th)\n\nTrinity has to replace all of their main firepower from last season with 3 double figure scorers and their top defender all graduating. Senior James Oberg and junior Justin Groppel are the top returnees. The rest of the lineup will be inexperienced.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nNew Life\n\nMaranatha\n\nConcordia\n\nSt. Croix Prep\n\nCristo Rey\n\nSt. Agnes\n\nSt. Croix Lutheran\n\nTrinity\n\nNova Classical\n\nConference Overview\n\nNew Life is the favorite as they look to make a class A state title run. Remember they knocked off Cherry and Isaac Asuma (MN offered) by 25 last year in the class A 3rd place game. Maranatha and Concordia will battle for 2nd. Then a drop to the experience of St. Croix Prep for 4th. Cristo Rey could make a run for that spot. St. Agnes has heavy losses but I think they have more offense than St. Croix Lutheran for the next spot. Trinity and Nova will battle for the last spot. Nova will once again only play everybody one time in league play while everybody else is the standard home and home schedule.\n\nConference MVP: AJ Greene - Concordia\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nOmar Whitaker - Cristo Rey\n\nMason Engelking - Nova\n\nNolan Davis - St. Agnes\n\nBen Myers - St. Croix Prep\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nConcordia at New Life - Dec 13th\n\nMaranatha at New Life - Jan 3rd\n\nMaranatha at Concordia - Jan 23rd\n\nNew Life at Concordia - Jan 27th\n\nNew Life at Maranatha - Feb 3rd\n\nConcordia at Maranatha - Feb 24th\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nMaranatha vs Maple River - Dec 10th at Hopkins (Tipoff Classic)\n\nConcordia vs Lake Crystal Wellcome Memorial - Dec 10th at Hopkins (Tipoff Classic)\n\nNew Life vs Legacy Christian - Dec 20 at Hamline\n\nNew Life vs West Lutheran - Dec 21 at Hamline\n\nNew Life vs Minnehaha - Jan 21st at Hiawatha\n\nHoly Family at Maranatha - Feb 21st\n\nThis is the third preview in my 2022-23 season preview series. We continue the conference previews with a look at the Minnesota Classic Athletic Association (MCAA). For a list of all the season previews and how they are done, click here.\n\nEagle Ridge Academy Gryphons (2021-22 season 16-12, 8-6 Conference, 4th)\n\nThe Gryphons have to replace the graduates Soren Habel along with twins Cade and Hunter LaFavor. Promising freshman JP Musoke has transferred to Breck for another major loss. That crew averaged over 45 PPG. That leaves junior Teddy Relan (9.7 PPG) as the only 1 of the 5 top scores from last year coming back. Seniors Michael Crowley and Aiden Ortmeier return to the rotation.\n\nHeritage Christian Academy Eagles (2021-22 season 7-15, 5-9 Conference, 5th)\n\nCoach Tim Herman went with a young roster of no seniors last season. The top 4 scorers were all freshmen and return to the starting lineup. Guard Josh Sokeye (11.1 PPG) and forward Abu Tarawallie (9.8 PPG) were the leading scorers. James Wicht, Liam Berry and Jonathan Mayhew provide senior experience in the rotation.\n\nLegacy Christian Academy Lions (2021-22 season 19-10, 10-4 Conference, 3rd)\n\nLegacy returns the entire rotation and should be poised for a great season. Forward Aiden Johnson (22 PPG, 14 RPG) is one of the top players in class A. The guard duo of PG J Wuollet (9.1 PPG) and SG Micah Strand (14.8 PPG 80 3s) is a perfect fit for their offense. Then you have solid role guys in Dominic Zoa (11 PPG), Solomon Kardell, Drew Mulvihill and Evan Bovee.\n\nNorth Lakes Academy Huskies (2021-22 season 8-19, 3-11 Conference, 7th)\n\nThe Huskies lose 1 notable rotation piece in starting forward Brayden Dickey (5.4 PPG). Their 2 offensive stars do return though. That's senior forward Jonathan Ozment (21.2 PPG) and Caleb Jensen (18 PPG). Guards Kenan Zenkic (5.2 PPG), Reide Strand, Devan Somers and Drew Christian also return to the lineup.\n\nPACT Charter Panthers (2021-22 season 8-20, 4-10 Conference, 6th)\n\nPACT returns their top 2 scorers from a year ago. Juniors Victor Nyabuto (16.8 PPG) and Micah Givand (12.4 PPG). Tucker Kapas and Landon Bjokne also return to the rotation. The 2 tallest players from last year have graduated so they'll need to find answers inside.\n\nSpectrum Sting (2021-22 season 20-7, 13-1 Conference, Tie 1st)\n\nTom Terhaar takes over the program. He was an assistant at Forest Lake last season. Titus Skistad, Carter Femrite and Landon Siegel combined for 43.7 PPG last season. Replacing them will be the 1st task. Forward Noah Miller is the leading returning scorer at 9.4 PPG. Junior PG Beck Guse (3.5 PPG) also returns to the starting lineup. Junior Blake Femrite (6 PPG) should see a much increased role this season. Ethan Mielke should help replace some of the lost size.\n\nUnited Christian Academy Thunder (2021-22 season 2-20, 0-14 Conference, 8th)\n\nThe Thunder were another team that went young last season. Josiah Hendley (15 PPG) and Sam Rich (8.8 PPG) were 1st and 3rd on the team in scoring as 8th graders last season. Seniors Micaiah Miller (10.4 PPG) and Mitch Jensen (4.9 PPG) also return to the starting lineup.\n\nWest Lutheran Warriors (2021-22 season 19-8, 13-1 Conference, tie 1st)\n\nWest Lutheran's guard play was the major key last season. PG Thomas Bursch (8.2 PPG) returns along with wings Isaiah Ronning (20.7 PPG) and Matt Koosman (9.7 PPG). They'll miss the toughness and clutch play of wing Christian Schmidt (13.2 PPG). The lineup is small so anything they get inside will be a major bonus.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nLegacy\n\nWest Lutheran\n\nSpectrum\n\nHeritage\n\nPACT\n\nEagle Ridge\n\nNorth Lakes\n\nUnited Christian\n\nConference Overview\n\nWith a youth movement last year, you'll see improvement in the league this year. Legacy is the easy favorite here. West Lutheran is an easy pick for 2nd but they don't have a big to match Aiden Johnson. Then it drops off. Spectrum has to replace their coach and 3 double figure scorers but there's still enough there to stay in the top half. Heritage and PACT will push them with their top players returning. Eagle Ridge has too much to replace to stay in the top half. North Lakes and United Christian will be better with lots coming back but nowhere else to put them.\n\nConference MVP: Aiden Johnson - Legacy\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nOliver Kelash - Eagle Ridge\n\nJosh Sokeye, Abu Tarawallie, Jonah Moulton, Owen Haag - Heritage\n\nEvan Bovee, Drew Mulvihill, Hudson Strand, Carson Anderson, Solomon Kardell - Legacy\n\nJosiah Hendley, Sam Rich, Jeremiah McDougal - United Christian\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nWest Lutheran at Legacy - Dec 12th\n\nLegacy at West Lutheran - Jan 31st\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nCass Lake-Bena at Legacy - Dec 5th\n\nMountain Iron-Buhl at Legacy - Dec 17th\n\nLegacy vs New Life Academy - Dec 20th at Hamline\n\nWest Lutheran vs New Life Academy - Dec 21st at Hamline\n\nThis is the second preview in the 2022-2023 season preview series. I continue the opening week of previews with small schools. In this preview, a look at the Eastern Minnesota Athletic Conference. For a list of all the season previews and how they are done, click here.\n\nAcademy for Sciences and Agriculture Eagles (2021-22 season 3-10, 2-8 Conference, 7th) The Eagles lose a handful of seniors. Junior Kris Kirkland and sophomore Tim Williams return at the guard spots. They look to provide most of the offense.\n\nAvail Academy Valor (2021-22 season 19-8, 7-5 Conference, Tie 3rd) Avail has to replace 3 of their top 4 scorers. That includes guards Josiah Schaap and Josiah Loge. They combined for over 32 PPG last season. Forward Deacon Bock and his 10.7 PPG also needs to be replaced on the front line. Junior Zachariah Schaap is the next family member in line to take over the team. He should see a big jump from his 13.8 PPG last season. Senior Brayden Ritzema is the other top returnee. Junior guards Justin Kroeze and Alvin Karngar also return to the rotation.\n\nCommunity of Peace Academy Tigers (2021-22 season 3-7, 5-17 Conference, 6th)\n\nCOPA only loses 1 player from last year's roster. The Tigers return 4 double figure scorers with senior PG Bernard Taylor (14.6 PPG) leading the way. Senior Jah'cir Allen (10.1 PPG) and soph guard Julius Terrell (11.6 PPG) return to the starting lineup as well. Forward Troy Madison (11.7 PPG) returns as an athletic front line anchor.\n\nGroves Academy Griffins (2021-22 season 1-6, 3-9 Conference, 8th)\n\nThe Griffins are coming off a season where I had a chance to see their only league win. That was a home come from behind win vs AFSA. Limited firepower for this roster.\n\nHmong Academy Warriors (2021-22 season 4-8, 5-15 Conference, 5th)\n\nLeading scorer Kyle Vang will need to be replaced. Frosh Tou Win Yang and junior Damien Yang look to lead the offense.\n\nLakes International Language Academy Dragons (2020-21 season 3-15)\n\nForward Jake Fakler and guard Joe Navratil have graduated. That means LILA loses their top 2 scorers. Junior wing Connor Severson (14.6 PPG) is the lone double figure scorer coming back. Juniors Carter Moore and Sam Kuhlman also return to the starting lineup. No seniors return for this young roster but its full of juniors.\n\nLiberty Classical Academy Lions (2021-22 season 21-7, 9-3 Conference, 2nd)\n\nGuard Anton Romportl (13.3 PPG) and forward Trent Verbeek (17.3 PPG) lead the Lions squad. Lucian Miles also returns to the starting lineup. Guard Cameron Lacy (11.1 PPG) and power forward Daniel Kneen (11.2 PPG) are the 2 important pieces that need to be replaced.\n\nMath and Science Academy Dragons (2021-22 season 21-7, 7-5 Conference, Tie 3rd)\n\nMath and Science was one of the best stories nobody knew about last year as they jumped up to a 21 win season with a senior laden squad. They start over this season. But the cupboard isn't bare with junior Josh Balami leading the way. Expect him to have a huge year and contend for league MVP honors. The question will be how much help he has.\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\nAvail Academy\n\nLiberty Christian Academy\n\nMath and Science\n\nCommunity of Peace\n\nLakes International Language Academy\n\nHmong Academy\n\nGroves Academy\n\nAFSA\n\nConference Overview\n\nThis will be a different year in the EMAC. Lakes International Language Academy and Hiawatha swap spots between independent and EMAC status. The schedule is a single round-robin only. You won't have that 1 team that is ridiculously far ahead of the pack like Twin Cities Academy was a couple years ago and Hiawatha last year. Avail and Liberty fill in their losses to claim top spots. Community of Peace is talented enough to be near that but are they disciplined enough? Josh Balami keeps Math and Science in the top half. The rest fit logically into the bottom half with LILA being the best of that group.\n\nConference MVP: Josh Balami - Math and Science\n\nUnderclassmen to watch:\n\nJake Ritzema - Avail\n\nJulius Terrell - CPA\n\nTou Win Vang, Kaleb Yang - Hmong\n\nMac Maring, Gabe Ndirangu, Oslo Norcross - LILA\n\nConference Games to Watch\n\nLiberty at Avail - Jan 5th\n\nNon-Conference Games to Watch\n\nWest Lutheran at Avail - Feb 16th"
