But it is a Well known fact that communist agents Are stalking the coun by trying to obtain the know Low of the manufacture of this Job. Is it wrong for a commit be of the House of represent Ives in Washington to try to detect this or similar subversive activity during this critical per Iod nevertheless or.

Washingion Truman said presiden today that the being done with american Relief supplies. The United states under the Urra Bill has furnished millions of dollars in Essen tial commodities to countries dominated and controlled by soviet Russia. Many of these commodities comprise items of which there Are vital shortages in the United states today. Last year we gave Yugoslavia the country which is now controlled by the communist dictator Tito Over in Relief. To show his gratitude for what the United states has done for his coun by Tito will not leave an Amer ican plane Fly Over his country much less permit a representative of the american government to enter it. He has returned our Charity by shooting Down Ameri can flyers. Millions to Tito nevertheless or. Hook voted to give Tito and the other rus Sian dominated countries Mil Lions in Relief Money but at the same time he voted against giving representatives of the american press the right to enter these countries and report to the american people what is1 be ing done with their Money and supplies. We have no Way knowing whether Tito and of the other communists Are using our Money to feed hungry people or whether they Are using it to Fos Ter and promote communism. I Challenge or. Hook to explain and reconcile this vote under what he Calls the american Bill of Here is another example of or. Hook s Conception of the Bill of rights. During the last session of Congress he voted consistently against the committee on in american activities of the House of representatives.
