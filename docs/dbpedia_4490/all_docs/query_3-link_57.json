        "text": "Megan Griffin\n\nMelora P. Mirza wins CJCLS award\n\nMelora Mirza, associate library director at the Georgia Perimeter College (GPC)-Dunwoody Campus, has been chosen to receive the Community and Junior College Libraries Section (CJCLS) EBSCO Community College Learning Resources Leadership Award.\n\nThe $500 award and plaque, donated by EBSCO Information Services, will be presented to Mirza during the ALA Annual Conference in New Orleans.\n\n“Melora Pond Mirza has demonstrated through her years of public and academic library service and represents the true spirit of the CJCLS/EBSCO award,” said award chair Steven L. Irving, electronic services librarian at Southern Utah University. “Mirza not only leads by example but is happy to help bring new members into the fold and share her enthusiasm and love of her profession.”\n\nFor past two years, Mirza has been co-chair of the GPC Convocation Committee, which plans the fall convocation for faculty and staff to kick off the academic year. She also serves as chair of the GPC Library Dunwoody Exhibits Committee, and she works with the GPC Clarkston campus Fine Arts liaison to bring local art and artists to Dunwoody. She was also responsible for initiating an annual student art display on the Dunwoody campus.\n\nMirza was instrumental in bringing a library technician program to GPC. She worked with college administrators and others to guide the new program through the organizational and implementation stages. Mirza speaks around the state to promote the program.\n\nFor the past several years, Mirza has been responsible for teaching an eight-hour workshop to accountants in the Atlanta area. She shows the accountants how to use library resources to enhance the effectiveness of their work, including communication with their clients. Registration funds go directly to GPC Libraries for technology.\n\nBussert wins CJCLS Program Achievement Award\n\nLeslie Bussert, head of instruction services, University of Washington-Bothell Campus, has been chosen to receive the 2011 Community and Junior College Libraries Section (CJCLS) EBSCO Community College Library Program Achievement Award.\n\nThe $500 award and plaque, donated by EBSCO Information Services, will be presented to Bussert during the ALA Annual Conference.\n\n“Leslie was selected for her innovative assessment work and collaboration with a faculty member on an information literacy assessment project and subsequent 2010 book chapter co-published with a faculty member,” said award chair Steven L. Irving, electronic services librarian at Southern Utah University.\n\nBased on ACRL’s five information literacy standards, Bussert collaborated with Cascadia Community College English instructor Norm Pouliot to convert a grading rubric into an online self-assessment survey for students. This self-assessment has been used to achieve a number of goals: to introduce and specify information literacy learning goals to students; to help students articulate their skills and take responsibility for their learning by addressing gaps in their skill set or knowledge base; to allow faculty and librarians to customize lesson plans in order to meet the needs of the students; to generate collaboration and conversations between the faculty and librarians by providing data of themes and trends in students’ information literacy skills, abilities, and experiences; to provide qualitative data that demonstrates to administers the impact information literacy instruction has on student learning and success, and is thus an advocacy tool for sustaining information literacy instruction programs.\n\nOakleaf wins IS Ilene F. Rockman Publication of the Year Award\n\nMegan Jane Oakleaf, assistant professor at the iSchool at Syracuse University, has been chosen as the winner of the Instruction Section (IS) Ilene F. Rockman Publication of the Year Award, for her article, “Information Literacy Instruction Assessment Cycle: A Guide for Increasing Student Learning and Improving Librarian Instructional Skills.” The award recognizes an outstanding publication related to library instruction published in the past two years.\n\nThe award, donated by Emerald Group Publishing Ltd., consists of a plaque and a cash prize of $3,000. Oakleaf will receive the award during the ALA Annual Conference.\n\n“The Instruction Section Awards committee chose Oakleaf’s article because it presents a blueprint for continual information literacy assessment,” said award committee co-chair Robin Ewing, associate professor and access services coordinator at St. Cloud State University.\n\n“In ‘The Information Literacy Instruction Assessment Cycle,’ Oakleaf clearly and thoroughly describes step-by-step how information literacy coordinators can assess their information literacy program,” Ewing continued. “Getting started with assessment can be overwhelming and this article gives librarians a place to start and a way to continually improve.”\n\nHoffman and Costello win IS Innovation award\n\nKimberly Davies Hoffman, associate librarian for reference and instruction, and Michelle Costello, reference/instruction, education and instructional design librarian at the State University of New York (SUNY)-Geneseo, have been selected to receive the Instruction Section (IS) Innovation award for developing LILAC (Library Instruction Leadership Academy), a collaborative professional development project designed, organized, and delivered by regional K–12, community college, and college/university librarians. Sponsored by ProQuest, the annual award recognizes a project that demonstrates creative, innovative, or unique approaches to information literacy instruction or programming.\n\nA prize of $3,000 and a certificate will be presented to Hoffman and Costello during the ALA Annual Conference in New Orleans.\n\n“The IS Awards committee chose the LILAC project for the ACRL IS Innovation Award because of the creators’ ‘think locally’ approach to professional development in challenging economic times,” said award committee co-chair Elizabeth Kocevar-Weidinger, instruction/reference services librarian at Longwood University.\n\n“Producing this model for regional professional development opportunities for information literacy pedagogy for educators and librarians provides all of us with a refreshing, innovative look at how we can learn and network locally. Furthermore, in a truly collaborative spirit, the project planners were inclusive in their approach, seeking the expertise of K–12 and higher education librarians and educators. In its purpose, content and potential for widespread use, LILAC is truly an innovative contribution to advancing pedagogy in information literacy and instruction librarianship.”\n\nAtkins wins LPSS Marta Lange/CQ Press Award\n\nStephen E. Atkins, former curator of the Dawson Collection and French Studies at the Cushing Library of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, has been posthumously awarded the Law and Political Science Section (LPSS) Marta Lange/CQ Press Award. The award, established in 1996 by LPSS, honors an academic or law librarian who has made distinguished contributions to bibliography and information service in law or political science.\n\nCQ Press, sponsor of the award, will present the $1,000 award and plaque to Atkins’ widow, Susan Atkins, during the ALA Annual Conference.\n\n“During his life, Dr. Stephen E. Atkins, scholar and librarian, made distinguished contributions to the field of political science,” said award chair Mary Gilles, business and economics librarian at Washington State University.\n\n“His encyclopedias, reference handbook, and annotated guide to sources in the area of arms control, security studies, and terrorism are standard works in academic library reference collections. In addition, Dr. Atkins was dedicated to the profession, serving as chair of LPSS (1989-90), as well as in other roles and positions within ALA. Dr. Atkins possessed some of the finest qualities sought in LPSS Marta Lange/CQ Press Award recipients.”\n\nAgEcon Search wins Innovation in Science and Technology Librarianship Award\n\nAgEcon Search, the agricultural repository of the University of Minnesota Department of Applied Economics and the University of Minnesota Libraries, has been selected as the 2011 recipient of the Science and Technology Section (STS) Innovation in Science and Technology Librarianship Award.\n\nThe $3,000 cash award, donated by IEEE, will be presented at the STS All Members Breakfast during the ALA Annual Conference.\n\n“AgEcon Search is the trusted national and international repository for open access to agricultural economic research valued by disciplinary researchers the world over,” said award co-chairs, Marianne Stowell Bracke of Purdue University and Lutishoor Salisbury at the University of Arkansas.\n\n“Since its inception in 1995, it has changed continuously as technology has evolved, finding innovative solutions to indexing, archiving, and delivering these materials.”\n\nAgEcon Search is a free, open access repository of full-text scholarly literature in agricultural and applied economics, including working papers, conference papers, and journal articles. It is available at http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/.\n\nAgEcon Search is coordinated by Louise Letnes, librarian in the Department of Applied Economics, and Julie Kelly, science librarian at Magrath Library at the University of Minnesota. Louise and Patricia Rodkewich, who retired in 2002, started the project in 1994, and Kelly joined the effort in 2003.\n\nShurtleff named STS Oberly Award winner\n\nWilliam R. Shurtleff, founder and director of the Soyinfo Center, has been selected as the recipient of the Science and Technology Section (STS) Oberly Award for Bibliography in the Agricultural or Natural Sciences for his bibliography, “History of Soybeans and Soyfoods in Africa (1857–2009): Extensively Annotated Bibliography and Sourcebook.”\n\nThe cash award and plaque will be presented at the STS program during the ALA Annual Conference.\n\n“This is a true piece of scholarship which will be useful to help governments, NGOs, nutritionists, soybean farmers, breeders, and historians access a wide range of information of soybean that can help them in their quest to stem malnutrition and expand soybean production in Africa,” said award co-chairs, Marianne Stowell Bracke of Purdue University and Lutishoor Salisbury of the University of Arkansas.\n\nThe publication is a freely available electronic bibliography (www.soyinfocenter.com/pdf/134/Afri.pdf), and was published simultaneously on the Web and on Goggle Books in September 2009.\n\nShurtleff has worked in this field since 1976, when together with Akiko Aoyagi, he founded the Soyinfo Center, an information and publishing company. He has written 55 published books, including The Book of Tofu, The Book of Miso, and The Book of Tempeh.\n\nThe Oberly Award was established in 1923 in memory of Eunice Rockwood Oberly, librarian of the Bureau of Plant Industry, United States Department of Agriculture from 1908 to 1921. She was the Bureau of Plant Industry’s representative to the Congressional Joint Commission on Reclassification of Government Employees and was instrumental in gaining a fairer recognition of library activities. This biennial award is given in odd-numbered years for the best English-language bibliography in the field of agriculture or a related science.\n\nCassell wins WGSS Career Achievement Award\n\nKay Cassell, director of the Master of Library and Information Science Program and lecturer at the School of Communication and Information, Library and Information Science Department at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, has been selected as the winner of the Women and Gender Studies Section (WGSS) Career Achievement Award. The award, sponsored by ABC-CLIO Greenwood, honors significant long-standing contributions to women’s studies in the field of librarianship over the course of a career.\n\nA cash prize of $1,000 and a plaque will be presented to Cassell at the WGSS conference program during the ALA Annual Conference.\n\n“Over the course of her distinguished career, Kay Cassell has continuously made significant contributions in women’s studies librarianship,” said award Chair Kayo Denda, women’s studies librarian and head of the Margery Somers Foster Center at Rutgers University. “She expanded library collections on women’s issues and material authored by women and created frameworks to develop programming for women and girls in public library settings. Her exemplary research bridges theory and practice, a core goal of feminist librarianship, inspiring numerous libraries and librarians in public and academic settings all over the world.”\n\nCassell’s longtime women’s studies involvement is demonstrated by a variety of projects, including the establishments of the first Women in Librarianship Preconference, the Feminist Task Force and the Committee on the Status of Women, as well as her service on the board of directors of the Feminist Press. She is currently the editor of the journal Collection Building that publishes articles in women’s studies and other subjects. Cassell has successfully mentored and taught many librarians, some of them who served at the highest level of ALA’s leadership positions.\n\nWinners of the Leab awards\n\nThe Rare Books and Manuscripts Section (RBMS) has selected five winners and one honorable mention for the 2011 Katharine Kyes Leab and Daniel J. Leab “American Book Prices Current” Exhibition Awards. The awards, funded by an endowment established by Katharine Kyes Leab and Daniel J. Leab, editors of American Book Prices Current, recognize outstanding exhibition catalogs issued by American or Canadian institutions in conjunction with library exhibitions as well as electronic exhibition catalogues of outstanding merit issued within the digital/Web environment. Certificates will be presented to each winner during the RBMS Membership Meeting and Information Exchange at the ALA Annual Conference in New Orleans.\n\nThe Division One (expensive) winner is “Claude Bradgon and the Beautiful Necessity,” submitted by the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at the University of Rochester River Campus Libraries.\n\n“The committee was swift to award this catalogue, a broad survey of the life and career of architect, artist, and designer Claude Bragdon,” states Molly Schwartzburg, chair of the RBMS Exhibition Awards committee and Cline Curator of Literature at the University of Texas at Austin’s Harry Ransom Center. The volume’s broad reach and enduring value to all audiences interested in Bragdon’s work—and American architectural history more generally—is confirmed by extensive apparatus including a timeline, bibliography, and full subject index.”\n\nThe Division Two (moderately expensive) winners are the Stanford University Libraries Department of Special Collections and the Bancroft Library at the University of California-Berkeley for “Celebrating Mexico: The Grito de Dolores and the Mexican Revolution, 1810 | 1910 | 2010.”\n\n“This volume celebrating the anniversary of the Mexican Revolution is also an implicit celebration of inter-institutional collaboration,” said Schwartzburg. “Documenting concurrent exhibitions mounted at the University of California at Berkeley and Stanford University, it reveals to audiences the complementary resources of these institutions through twin checklists and essays by library staff and faculty at both universities. Bilingual text—in English and Spanish—makes the volume accessible to a wide audience, and a careful integration of text, images, and the checklist offers readers a fully unified reading experience.”\n\nThe Division Three (inexpensive) winner is “The Power of Refined Beauty: Photographing Society Women for Pond’s, 1920s to 1950s,” submitted by the Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising and Marketing History at Duke University.\n\n“This slender, concise volume is a fascinating study of the interplay of high art, marketing, and the lives of high-society women from the 1920s to the 1950s,” remarks Schwartzburg.\n\n“Perhaps the volume’s most important success is its ability to tell a complex, information-rich story in a manner that is cogent, compelling, and visually appealing. Anyone designing a catalog about the idea of beauty is faced with quite a challenge; the results of this project are entirely successful.”\n\nThe Division Four (brochures) winner is the Sheridan Libraries at Johns Hopkins University for their brochure entitled “A View of the Parade: H. L. Mencken and American Magazines.”\n\n“This whimsical brochure captures the spirit of Mencken’s work in the magazine industry,” noted Schwartzburg. “Its witty design and carefully selected images frame a substantive essay that is engaging, informative, and does just what an exhibition brochure should do: encourage audiences to attend the exhibition and learn more on their own afterwards.”\n\nThe Division Five (electronic exhibition) winner is the Linda Hall Library of Science, Engineering and Technology for “The Grandeur of Life,” available online at www.linda-hall.org/events_exhib/exhibit/exhibits/darwin/index.shtml.\n\n“Of the many centenary exhibitions of Darwin mounted recently, Linda Hall’s Web exhibition stands out as a thoroughly engaging, carefully researched, and flexible resource for audiences of all ages,” stated Schwartzburg.\n\nThe Division Five honorable mention winner is awarded to the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University for “Remember Haiti,” available online at www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/remember_haiti/index.php.\n\n“The committee agreed that Remembering Haiti deserved special recognition for its innovative use of the Internet Archive to curate an exhibition that is both historical and topical,” continued Schwartzburg.\n\n“As more and more massive collections of digital images appear on the internet, opportunities are created for experts to curate selections of these materials for audiences who might be overwhelmed by the scale of the collections as a whole. This project’s elegant interface, varied section topics, and French-language option offer numerous points of entry for a broad audience.\n\n“Built to take full advantage of the Web, the site connects directly to the Internet Archive and Brown’s own digital repository social interactivity, including links to share the collection on Facebook, Twitter, and other venues, and will expand in the future.”\n\nCopyright 2011© American Library Association\n\nArticle Views (Last 12 Months)\n\nNo data available\n\nContact ACRL for article usage statistics from 2010-April 2017.\n\nArticle Views (By Year/Month)\n\n2024 January: 2 February: 0 March: 5 April: 6 May: 10 June: 2 July: 6 August: 4 2023 January: 3 February: 2 March: 0 April: 3 May: 0 June: 0 July: 1 August: 0 September: 1 October: 1 November: 4 December: 3 2022 January: 1 February: 2 March: 1 April: 0 May: 3 June: 1 July: 3 August: 3 September: 2 October: 0 November: 1 December: 1 2021 January: 1 February: 2 March: 0 April: 3 May: 0 June: 2 July: 2 August: 1 September: 2 October: 3 November: 1 December: 1 2020 January: 3 February: 1 March: 2 April: 1 May: 1 June: 0 July: 2 August: 2 September: 1 October: 1 November: 5 December: 3 2019 January: 6 February: 6 March: 5 April: 2 May: 4 June: 8 July: 1 August: 6 September: 1 October: 3 November: 0 December: 3 2018 January: 2 February: 3 March: 4 April: 8 May: 2 June: 6 July: 1 August: 5 September: 7 October: 2 November: 7 December: 5 2017 April: 0 May: 5 June: 4 July: 4 August: 4 September: 7 October: 6 November: 5 December: 12"
