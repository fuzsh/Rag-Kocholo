        "text": "(1892–1992). U.S. motion picture director, producer, and writer Hal Roach became one of Hollywood’s most successful moviemakers of the 1920s and 1930s with his comedies, including the “Our Gang” series. He ranks with producer Mack Sennett as a creator of inspired madness and chaos in early Hollywood comedies. During his film career, Roach produced more than 2,000 comedy shorts and a large number of full-length features.\n\nHarold Eugene Roach was born in Elmira, N.Y., on Jan. 14, 1892. After working at a variety of jobs, Roach began his film career in 1912 as a bit player in Westerns. In 1915, he formed a company to produce the “Willie Work” comedies of actor Harold Lloyd, achieving his first success with Just Nuts (1915). After establishing the Hal Roach Studios at Culver City, Calif., he produced other Lloyd films, including his famous Safety Last (1923). He also produced a series of comedies with the team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy that included such outstanding movies as Leave ’em Laughing (1928) and Way Out West (1937). His other production credits include a series starring humorist Will Rogers that often satirized Hollywood and another series presenting the adventures of Rex the Wonder Horse. Roach’s insistence on carefully constructed scripts with good story lines and well-worked characterizations resulted in a humor based on character and situation rather than a string of sight gags. Two of his shorts, The Music Box (1932) with Laurel and Hardy and the Our Gang’s Bored of Education (1936), won Academy awards for best short subject, while Tit for Tat (1935) received an Oscar nomination.\n\nRoach also produced Topper (1937), Topper Takes a Trip (1939), and Topper Returns (1941), comedies about amiable ghosts helping a befuddled mortal. Of Mice and Men (1939), an adaptation of a novel by U.S. author John Steinbeck, ranks as the most notable of his serious movies. In the late 1940s Roach turned to television, but his production company failed in the late 1950s. In 1984 he received an honorary award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his contributions to filmmaking. Roach died on Nov. 2, 1992, in Bel Air, Calif."
