        "text": "Movie producer Hal Roach, 100, who teamed Laurel with Hardy and turned a talented yet unaffected group of child actors into \"Our Gang\" during a career that spanned silent one-reelers and television situation comedies, died Monday in the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills.\n\nHis birthday celebration last January at the Motion Picture and Television Home produced a final outpouring of sentiment and public attention to the film industry's oldest pioneer. In 1984, Roach received an honorary Academy Award for his life's work.\n\n\"Through most of his 90s, he drove a car, he smoked, he drank, he dated, he went hunting. He did everything that any man can do -- and with a vengeance,\" said Richard Bann, co-author of \"The Little Rascals: The Life and Times of Our Gang.\"\n\nRoach developed pneumonia about a week ago and \"had this sudden heart attack,\" his daughter, Maria, was quoted as saying.\n\nRoach drifted into movies by accident. Born in Elmira, N.Y., he left home at 17 and spent the next three years working as a mule skinner and prospector in Alaska and as a truck driver in Seattle. He was 20 in 1912 when he landed in Los Angeles as the infant movie industry was starting.\n\nUniversal hired Roach as a stuntman, extra and bit player at $5 a day. He became acquainted with another little-known actor, Harold Lloyd, whom he saw as a potential comedy star. When Roach inherited $3,000 in 1915, he started his own company, with Lloyd starring in a comedy series called \"Willie Work.\" It failed.\n\nRoach found a backer for his comedies and rehired Lloyd for a series featuring the character Lonesome Luke. They later dropped Luke and developed his bespectacled all-American boy character, which made Lloyd a star.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn the early '20s, Lloyd went on to produce his own features, and Roach continued concentrating on short films. He exhibited a talent for developing comedy stars, including Snub Pollard, Will Rogers (already a Broadway star), Max Davidson and Edgar Kennedy, as well as Chase and Finlayson.\n\nIn 1927, Roach combined Laurel and Hardy, who became his top stars. They made more than 100 films, 27 of them features. A 1932 Laurel and Hardy two-reeler, \"The Music Box,\" won an Academy Award for short subject.\n\nOne of his last public appearances was last summer in Las Vegas for a convention of the Sons of the Desert, the international Laurel and Hardy appreciation society.\n\nAt various times during the 1920s, the comedy roster at Hal Roach Studios in Culver City included Lloyd, Pollard, Rogers, Charley Chase, Harry Langdon, Mabel Normand, Zasu Pitts, Thelma Todd, Patsy Kelly and Irvin S. Cobb.\n\nBut it was Roach's creation of \"Our Gang\" and the teaming of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy that gave the small, independent studio its biggest successes and created an enduring comedy legacy.\n\nIn 1922, Roach started \"Our Gang,\" which became immensely popular with the advent of sound. In 1936, \"Bored of Education\" from the \"Our Gang\" series earned Roach his second Academy Award for short subject.\n\n(For copyright reasons, \"Our Gang\" was renamed \"The Little Rascals\" when the shorts began being shown on television in the 1950s).\n\nRoach was able to bridge the gap with talkies. Such stars as Laurel and Hardy proved even funnier with the addition of dialogue. He continued introducing new series, including Thelma Todd-Patsy Kelly, \"The Boy Friends\" and \"Hal Roach Musicals.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
