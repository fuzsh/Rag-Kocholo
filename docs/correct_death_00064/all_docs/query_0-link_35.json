        "text": "Elmira native Hal Roach is focus of new book\n\nNative Elmiran Hal Roach's moving-producing career began 100 years ago when he co-founded Rolin Film Co. and recently, a book about his life was released to coincide with the film company's anniversary.\n\nHal, the producer of \"Our Gang\" and \"Laurel and Hardy\" films, was born in Elmira. He is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.\n\nThe book, \"100 Years of Brodies with Hal Roach: The Jaunty Journeys of a Hollywood Motion Picture and Television Pioneer,\" was penned by Craig Calman, a Los Angeles author who formed a 20-year friendship with the pioneer producer and director.\n\n\"Brodie\" was a slang term used by Hal, Craig said. To learn what the word means, Craig insists you read the book, which sells for about $25 on Amazon.\n\nCraig, 61, met Hal in 1973 when he was an undergraduate at UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. As part of a class assignment, Craig had to produce his own movie.\n\nHe decided to see if there were any \"old timers\" around and discovered Hal's number in a phone book. Craig had always been a fan of \"Laurel and Hardy.\"\n\n\"(Hal) was in Bel Air. I called and a young woman answered the phone. She didn't sound any older than 10,\" Craig said. \"I asked to speak with Hal Roach, she asked me to hold on for a moment and I heard call, 'Grandpa.'\"\n\nCraig asked to meet with him. Hal told him, \"Sure.\" They agreed to meet at the Bel Air Country Club.\n\n\"He told me, 'I'll be in the card room,'\" Craig said.\n\n\"He was 81 when I met him, but he was so vibrant and sharp, I thought he was 60,\" Craig said. \"I didn't know much about his career, only that he was friendly. He mentioned he would love to get back into the business.\"\n\nHal agreed to collaborate on the film project with Craig, who said he received an A-plus for his work.\n\nFrom there, Craig and Hal formed a friendship that lasted nearly 20 years, until Hal's death in 1992.\n\nWhen Hal decided he needed a writing assistant for his last \"comeback comedy,\" Craig moved into his Bel Air home. Hal was 96 at the time.\n\n\"He often talked about his childhood in Elmira. He also talked about guest speaker named Mark Twain who visited his school,\" Craig said.\n\nCraig described his famous friend as a good man, honest and forthright.\n\n\"He always saw the bright, sunny side of things,\" Craig said. \"Everyone who worked for him loved him.\"\n\nCraig's notes about Hal date back to 1973. When Hal died, Craig compiled a 75-page article about their friendship.\n\nAt the urging of his friends, Craig decided to write his latest book. It took him about a year and a half to complete it. \"I'm pleased with how this book turned out,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm 61 now, and I cannot think of any other human being that reaches his level of creativity or positive energy. What a legacy he's left behind,\" Craig said. \"He was a great guy to know.\"\n\nJennifer Kingsley is a staff writer for the Star-Gazette.
