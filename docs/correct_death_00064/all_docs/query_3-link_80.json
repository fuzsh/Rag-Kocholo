        "text": "LEWISTON – Richard “Dick” Newman Breau, 78, of 310 Old Greene Rd. in Lewiston, passed away on Monday, July 1, 2024, at Maine Medical Center from complications of heart surgery. He passed peacefully surrounded by his loving family.\n\nBorn in Lewiston on March 23, 1946, he was the son of Harold “Hal Lone Pine” Breau and Rita “Betty Cody” Cote Breau. As the child of musicians and country western performers, he had an unconventional early childhood, moving frequently and traveling throughout the U.S. and Canada with his family while performing as “Little Dickie” alongside his older brother Lenny “Lone Pine Jr” Breau, as part of the Lone Pine Jamboree. He eventually settled back in Auburn with his mother and two younger brothers, Denny and Bob, where he attended local schools and graduated from Edward Little High School in 1965.\n\nHe married his high school sweetheart and the love of his life, Gertrude “Trudy” Small Breau on June 29, 1968. They were completely devoted to one another and to their family, working hard to build a strong marriage founded on love, partnership and mutual respect that endured all of life’s trials. Their two daughters, Tiffany and Tracy, grew up in a nurturing home that was filled with warmth and affection, unconditional love, encouragement to pursue their dreams and lots of laughter. He was an incredible husband, father, and grandfather.\n\nDick was humble, had a strong sense of integrity and never took anything for granted, working hard to make a life for himself and his family. At the age of 13, he began working in his uncle’s carpentry business while continuing to attend school, contributing nearly all of his earnings to his mother to help support her and his younger brothers.\n\nUpon graduation, he briefly served in the Army Reserves as a medic before stepping into the role that would become his career at Tufts Brothers Printing/One-Right Systems where he was mentored by Guy Hartnett. Over the years, Dick took on increasing levels of responsibility and eventually became the plant manager for all printing operations, a role that he held for 40 years until retiring at the age of 63.\n\nThough he chose not to follow his parents and brothers into a career in the music industry, Dick had a beautiful singing voice, and he was an entertainer at heart, nurturing a love of performing throughout his life. Music was a constant in his home and on any given day, he could be heard singing his favorite artists while puttering around his yard or preparing his latest creation in the kitchen. Similarly, he enjoyed the opportunity to entertain others, whether it took the form of singing alongside his mother and brothers at musical events or performing his well-known Elvis impersonation. When he wasn’t singing, he could be found gardening and cooking with his wife, working on home improvement projects, enjoying family gatherings with his children and grandchildren or golfing with his friends.\n\nDick had a sparkle in his eye, a quick wit, a warm smile, and an open heart for everyone that he met. Whenever he was present, people around him were laughing and having fun. He lived his life to the fullest, approaching each day with a characteristic sense of optimism and gratitude. His passing leaves a void in the lives of his family and friends that will be difficult to fill, and he will be greatly missed by all who knew him.\n\nDick is survived by his wife of 56 years, Trudy Breau; his daughters Tiffany Breau-Metivier and her husband, Tom Metivier, of Lewiston, and Tracy King and her husband, Joe, of Gorham; his grandchildren, Derek, Jacob and Nathan Metivier, and Andrew and Caroline King; his brothers Dennis Breau and his wife Ann, and Robert Breau and his wife, Julie, his brother-in-law, Richard Brewer; and numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was predeceased by his parents; his brother, Lenny Breau, and his sister-in-law, Terry Brewer.\n\nA visitation at Pinette Dillingham and Lynch Funeral Home for Richard will be held Thursday, July 18 from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. A funeral service at Pinette Dillingham and Lynch Funeral Home will occur Friday, July 19 at 9 a.m.\n\nArrangements are under the care of Pinette, Dillingham and Lynch Funeral Home, 305 Alfred Plourde Parkway Lewiston, ME 04240, 207-784-4023.\n\nIf desired, donations may be made in Richard’s memory to the\n\nAmerican Heart Association,\n\nP.O. Box 840692,\n\nDallas, TX 75284-0692\n\n« Previous\n\nObituary: Carissa Marie Millbury\n\nNext »"
