        "text": "Hal Roach, the one-time mule skinner and gold prospector who later mined the careers of such comedic greats as Harold Lloyd, Laurel & Hardy, Will Rogers and the “Our Gang” kids, died yesterday, two months shy of his 101st birthday.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan described his former colleague in this light: “At 100 years old, Hal Roach made us all feel young. He was one of the founding fathers of the motion picture industry … the original hyphenate producer, director, writer and studio boss. He will be deeply missed.”\n\nRoach drifted into the business as a bit actor in 1912, following a hodgepodge of odd jobs, including dabbling in Alaska gold prospecting as well as running mule trains in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nWhen he hit Hollywood at the age of 20, the fledgling movie business was just beginning to thrive. Universal hired him as a stunt man and extra at $5 a day.\n\nWhen Roach inherited $3,000 in 1915, he started his own company with Lloyd, launching a comedy series called “Willie Work.” But it failed. Roach hunted work as a director and Lloyd began working for comedy giant Mack Sennett.\n\nPathe became a backer for Roach, who joined up with Dan Linthicum to start Rolin Film Co. and the partners re-hired Lloyd.\n\nBy the late ’20s Roach threw his energies into developing his biggest assets — Laurel & Hardy, Charlie Chase and the “Our Gang” comedies (last were retitled “Little Rascals” when they went into TV syndication). By the ’30s he moved into sound, introducing such shorts as the Thelma Todd-ZaSu Pitts comedy series.\n\nRoach’s career faded after World War II, but he continued to appear at film festivals honoring his body of work. He received an honorary Academy Award in 1984.\n\nBy 1935, Roach moved into movies with such films as “Captain Fury,””The Housekeeper’s Daughter,””Of Mice and Men,””Topper” and “One Million B.C.”\n\nDuring WWII, his Culver City studio became Fort Roach producing training and propaganda films for the U.S. Army Air Corps. But his company never recovered in the post war era.\n\nRoach, who was the last founder and original board member of the Motion Picture & Television Fund, has also been a co-founder and president of another Hollywood pastime, the Santa Anita Race Track."
