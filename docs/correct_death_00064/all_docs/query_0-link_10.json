        "text": "My first visit to the home of Hal Roach was in 1978. He and his second wife were happy to receive visitors. It was really an experience talking to Mr. Roach for two hours or more. It revealed a lot of information that may never show up in books. I wish I could have filmed or recorded the visits but they didn't want to because he was working on a book (that I don't think ever came out). However they did let me take all the pictures I wanted. Mrs. Roach, who passed away in late 1979, took the pictures of me with Mr. Roach in 1978 and 1979."
