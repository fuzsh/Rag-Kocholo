        "text": "Vintage ’30s comedy returns, with a beautiful blonde, a sassy brunette and elaborate location filming in a bygone Los Angeles. Hal Roach found a good match for his ‘female Laurel & Hardy’ comedy team in gorgeous Thelma Todd and the smart-mouthed Patsy Kelly.\n\nThe Complete Hal Roach Thelma Todd Patsy Kelly Comedy Collection\n\nDVD\n\n1933-1936 / Color / 1:37 Academy / 445 min. / Silver Series / Street Date June 26 2018, 2018 / available through Classic Flix / 39.99\n\nStarring: Thelma Todd & Patsy Kelly.\n\nProduced by Hal Roach\n\nDirected by Gus Meins, William Terhune, James Parrott, Nick Grinde, others\n\nHal Roach made the movie game pay big even back in the ‘teens, when Los Angeles used zoning laws to force moviemakers away from downtown, into the remote ‘suburbs’ of Hollywood and Culver City. Taking a choice piece of Culver City real estate, Hal built a veritable empire of comedy, mostly with short subjects. He helped launch the great Harold Lloyd, invented and maintained the popular ‘Our Gang’ series and was the producer who teamed up Laurel & Hardy, his biggest success. Roach released through MGM in the 1930s and then with United Artists; his only major business faux-pas was a brief business partnership with the son of Benito Mussolini, an Italian fascist, just as war was breaking out in Europe.\n\nRoach never left a possibility unturned, and spent the 1930s developing a female version of Laurel & Hardy for the then- lucrative short subject market. The trick was pairing the right two actresses. The go-to glamour girl was Thelma Todd, a drop-dead gorgeous fashion plate comedienne who memorably served as eye candy in two Marx Brothers features. She also popped up in interesting roles in dramas: William Wyler’s Counselor-At-Law, Clara Bow’s Call Her Savage. Very popular in and around the Hollywood scene, Thelma was considered a class act. She managed her own showcase cafe out on the Pacific Coast Highway.\n\nRoach first paired Thelma Todd with Zasu Pitts, the brilliant silent film actress who when sound came in turned more to comedy, playing nervous, high-strung types. Their seventeen two-reelers found popularity between 1931 and 1933, when they broke up over a salary dispute. Pitts’ legacy was permanently damaged in the 1960s when the Tonight Show host Johnny Carson used her name in skits, just because it sounded funny to say next to the names of other former silent stars, like ‘Gustav von Seyffertitz.’\n\nA master of the mix & match school of casting, Hal Roach saw no need to end the series. He replaced Pitts with young Patsy Kelly, a brash, fast-talking Vaudeville comedienne. Definitely not a looker, Kelly nevertheless floored audiences with her game smiles, fast wisecracks and saucy put-downs. The 21 Todd-Kelly short subjects between 1933 and 1936 mostly use the same comic chemistry. The girls ‘play themselves’ with their own names. Thelma is poised and gracious, even when they’re looking for jobs or otherwise down on their luck. She’s not particularly bright and tends to be a little gullible. Patsy is a troublemaker who somehow turns every situation into a problem. Distrustful of everybody, she has a bad habit of picking fights, just for the fun of it. Equally a bit dim in the brains department, the excitable Patsy easily goes out of control.\n\nThe Complete Hal Roach Thelma Todd Patsy Kelly Comedy Collection stretches across three discs. Compared to typical short subjects by smaller outfits, the Todd-Kelly shows have lavish production values. Many scenes are filmed on local Los Angeles streets, giving location hunters a field day (I’ve had my eye peeled on short subjects for years, hoping someday a show would pop up filmed on my block of Gower Street!). As a two-reeler lasts between sixteen and twenty minutes, the shorts have time for two or three developed scenes, giving Patsy a chance to work up a comedy routine. Thelma tends to be the Straight Girl of the team. They aren’t committed bachelorettes, as each is occasionally linked with a possible romance, even if only a gag. Some shorts see them interested in millionaire- hunting, although Thelma is never a gold digger in the predatory sense.\n\nRoach’s writers rely on the standard formulas to put the girls into new situations. Some of the same supporting character actors show up, probably Roach regulars and holdovers from the silent era. Roach had the reputation of loyalty to a large group of actors typed in lowbrow comedy. Occasional ‘name’ performers show up, like Billy Gilbert and Esther Howard — all but the most famous character actors likely pursued the goal of working as many days per year as possible. A funny short set in a radio station is noted as the first appearance of Roy Rogers, unbilled, as a lead singer of the Sons of the Pioneeers; from what I could tell, he’s on screen for approximately three seconds, as most of the act is heard from the next room. Patsy gets a chance to dance in the episode.\n\nRoach uses a lot of special effects for certain shows, as with a good short about an airplane rigged with ejection parachute seats. The very first short stages several car fender-benders, as Patsy slowly demolishes a new roadster in a Laurel & Hardy-like game of tit for tat. We strain to recognize some locations, but the first short also features many views of UCLA and Westwood in 1933. Both Westside attractions are surrounded by plenty of vacant lots.\n\nYet another short would seem an inspiration for Jacques Tati — Thelma and Patsy are roped into demonstrating a newfangled washing machine in an elaborate department store window display. A crowd gathers while, naturally, the two ever-so-gracefully destroy everything.\n\nHere’s ClassicFlix’s official rundown on the twenty one shorts.\n\nDISC 1\n\nBeauty and the Bus (1933, 17:21) – The girls win a new car and take it out for a spin.

With Toby Wing, Harry Bowen, Sam Adams, Jim Thorpe and James C. Morton.\n\nThe bonus shorts attempt to continue the series after Thelma Todd’s unexpected death in December of 1936. It took place in the garage of the ex-wife of Todd’s former lover Roland West, just a block or so from her beach cafe in Pacific Palisades. Most references now list the death as a possible suicide but more likely an accident of carbon monoxide poisoning. Stories once circulated that Todd was involved with gangsters and that her death was a murder. Those theories eventually dried up, as did some of the more salacious ‘Hollywood Babylon’ scandals, as better research cleared away the gossip cobwebs.\n\nA small group of friends certainly knew about the mystery death. Between other jobs, we worked off and on at Paulist Productions, a religious film company that in the ’70s occupied Todd’s former Pacific Palisades cafe — which we were told had been a nightclub.\n\nActually, the rumors we heard were so exaggerated that the cafe became a speakeasy (what, after the repeal of prohibition?) frequented by dangerous characters. The building’s castle-like interior had such character that it was easy to believe such tales. Until the internet days made it easier to find decent information (if one were careful), we thought that Todd had died on the premises. The buzz was that the building was haunted.\n\nThe collection includes three of the four post-Todd Patsy Kelly short subjects. The fun Pert Kelton made just one short. She doesn’t seem a particularly good fit for Patsy. Kelton became more famous as Jackie Gleason’s first Alice Kramden on TV’s The Honeymooners; she’d lose that gig to the blacklist.\n\nThe other nominated Thelma Todd replacement is the unusual Lyda Roberti, a child of the Russian Revolution who came to show business via Shanghai. Roberti’s exotic accent is heard coming down a ship’s gangplank as she’s introduced singing in At Sea Ashore; her mispronunciation of English words is initially funny, but doesn’t seem like the kind of gag that could sustain a character for very long.\n\nPatsy Kelly’s film career went into a decline; we’re told that for a time she worked as Tallulah Bankhead’s personal assistant. She got a new lease on comedy with the arrival of TV. Although she appeared in numerous TV shows and had guest spots in Disney pictures, film fans best know her indelible character turn as the loathsome, slovenly Laura Louise, the witch that babysits poor Rosemary Woods in Roman Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby.\n\nClassicFlix’s 3-disc DVD set The Complete Hal Roach Thelma Todd Patsy Kelly Comedy Collection does a major service for 30s comedy cinema, giving us an entire run of Roach comedies to study. These are the kinds of shows that appear at Cinecon, but otherwise might be forgotten.\n\nThe quality is fine. The shows are licensed from a company called Sonar Entertainment, so I’d imagine the rights went in a different direction from other former Hal Roach productions, such as the features now distributed on disc by VCI. Someone (MGM?) clearly stored the elements well enough; none of the Todd-Kelly titles are missing. Of the thirteen I saw, I ran into none in which the image or sound was degraded.\n\nReviewed by Glenn Erickson\n\nThe Complete Hal Roach Thelma Todd Patsy Kelly Comedy Collection\n\nDVD rates:\n\nShort Subjects: Good — Very Good +\n\nVideo: Very Good\n\nSound: Very Good\n\nSupplements: three bonus shorts pairing Nancy Kelly with Pert Kelton and Lyda Roberti\n\nDeaf and Hearing-impaired Friendly?
