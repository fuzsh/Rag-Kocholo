        "text": "Hal Roach Jr. (June 15, 1918 - March 29, 1972) was primarily a film and television producer and very occasional director, with 41 production credits listed in the Internet Movie Database.\n\nBorn as Harold Eugene Roach Jr. in Los Angeles, the son of legendary comedy producer Hal Roach and actress Marguerite Nichols, Roach Jr. co-directed One Million B.C. with his father.\n\nRoach was president of the Hal Roach Studios for some time, but was ousted in 1959 when he and Alexander Guterma, who attempted to create an empire of the studio, Mutual Broadcasting System, and others, were both indicted on federal securities violations.[1][2]\n\nRoach produced individual episodes of many early television series but no well-known films aside from those directly involving his father. He died in 1972, at the age of 53 after falling ill with pneumonia.[3] His father outlived him by twenty years, dying in 1992 at age 100. Roach is buried in Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles."
