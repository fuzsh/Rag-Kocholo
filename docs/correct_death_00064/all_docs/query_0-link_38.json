Maltin & Bann list Charles Bachman, Jack Gavin and Sam Lufkin among them, but I can't spot them in these prints.\n\nthe locations:\n\nMotor Avenue, Palms district, Los Angeles\n\nMickey lives in the back of the building at 3316 Motor, which eventually housed the Master Mfg. Co.. As he's running down the street towards the cop, he passes the Palms Chamber Of Commerce on the east side of the 3300 block. This building would soon be home to the Mitholithic Mfg. Co. after the chamber moved to the next block. The northeast corner of Motor and Woodbine is where the cop is standing, and Mickey knocks him down. The brick building is the People's Water Company at 3392 Motor. Later, Mickey meets Mary as he walks out of the grocery store at 3384 Motor. A sign on the door reads 'Mark Twain.' As the two of them ride on Mickey's scooter, they crash in front of the vacant lot on the northwest corner of Motor and Woodbine. Visible in the background are the house at 3359 Motor and the Palms Hardware Co. at 3351 Motor. When the boys are stealing from the fruit vendor, they set up their contraption in front of the realty company on the west side of the 3300 block seen in earlier films like \"Fire Fighters\" (no. 2). The fruit stand is under the brick arch of Arden Grocery. The Palms Press, seen as recently as \"Seein' Things\" (no. 25) next to the realty company, was torn down by this time.\n\nLos Angeles Police Department\n\nThis Hollywood branch of the LAPD shared the right half of the same building at 1629 Cahuenga Avenue that housed the fire deparment. In the film, after Guenste pulls the alarm, this is the first building we see. The left side of the building, at 1625 Cahuenga, housed Hose Company No. 2 and Engine Company No. 27.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Department\n\nThis was both Old Truck Co. 26 and Old Engine Co. 26, and was located at 2475 West Washington Blvd. between South Van Ness Ave. and Arlington Ave. It's the second station we see in the film and is next to a building that says \"Hardware Paints & Oils,\" which would have been at the northeast corner of West Washington and Arlington.\n\nEngine House No. 18, Los Angeles\n\nThis is located on South Hobart Blvd just south of where it meets Adams Boulevard. This is the third emergency response in the film. Also visible is the building on the southeast corner of these two streets.\n\nmiscellaneous:\n\n12 shooting dates went into the making of this film. A week and a half after the final retakes for \"It's A Bear\" (no. 27), the 'start' date for \"High Society\" arrived on Mar. 24th. Shooting continued until the 'finish' date of Apr. 5th. No shooting took place on Mar. 30th, which was a Sunday. The 1924 datebook indicates that some Our Gang 'tests' were shot on Tuesday, Apr. 8th, with no production number given. Other than this, two weeks passed before the unit began shooting \"The Sun Down Limited\" (no. 31).\n\nThe 1924 studio datebook reveals what the weather was like on the various shooting dates. On most days, it was described as 'clear,' with 'rain' on Mar. 26th, and the weather described as 'cloudy' on Apr. 3rd, and 'raining' on Apr. 4th. No description was given for Sunday the 3rd.\n\nThis film was the fifth of six in the fifth 'series' of Our Gang films.\n\n40 still images were printed into numerous press photos to promote this film.\n\nThe letter authorizing Aunt Kate to take custody of Mickey is dated June 17.\n\nThe papers for Mickey's adoption are signed by a judge named L. A. French. He was actually the purchasing agent for the studio and later became production manager."
