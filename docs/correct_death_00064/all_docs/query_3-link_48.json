        "text": "Belfast comedian Frank Carson was laid to rest in his native city on Saturday.\n\nAnd in the week of Carson's burial, Ireland lost a second of its leading old school comics with the passing of Hal Roach.\n\nHundreds of people attended the Carson ceremony at St. Patrick's Church while hundreds of others lined the route as his cortege made its way to Milltown Cemetery for burial.\n\nThe 85-year-old died at his home in Blackpool, Lancashire, where he had been ill for some time.\n\nTV broadcaster Eamonn Holmes, comedians Lenny Henry, Stan Boardman and Roy Walker, sportsmen Dennis Taylor, Barry McGuigan and Pat Jennings and the singer Dana were among those who attended the Mass. Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness was also present.\n\nMass was celebrated by retired Bishop of Derry, Bishop Edward Daly. Bishop Daly told mourners that in his life and work Carson had been the \"prime minister of fun.\"\n\nAfter Mass, Carson's coffin was taken from the Catholic church to the nearby Protestant St. Anne's Cathedral for a blessing.\n\nLike Carson, Hal roach, who died aged 84, was a showman of the old school whose career spanned six decades. He starred for 26 consecutive seasons in Jury's Cabaret in Dublin, where he was particularly popular with American visitors.\n\nBorn in Waterford in 1927, Roach, whose signature line was \"write that down,\" was christened John and later nicknamed \"Hal\" after the Hollywood comedy producer, Harold Eugene \"Hal\" Roach.\n\nDuring his long career, Roach performed for five American presidents and shared the stage with some of the world's top entertainers, including Frank Sinatra."
