        "text": "No type of cinema is more subjective than comedy. If you’re laughing, no one is going to be able to persuade you that if you think about it, you’re actually not.\n\nThat makes coming up with a list of the genre’s 40 greatest hits an unavoidably personal exercise – though if you zoom out a bit, some hidden patterns start to emerge. The most obvious are the clearly defined golden periods and dead zones, when the prevailing sense of humour of the day either dated well or didn’t. The 1930s and 1970s are still hilarious; the 1990s and 2010s, not so much. As for the 2020s – ie now – Hollywood has seemingly given up on the form, or rather folded it into its franchises along with fantasy, action and sci-fi – though it may yet break free from the omnigenre as what tickles us continues to shift.\n\nAnother is the seeming xenophobic skew, since only four of the entries below count as foreign-language – and even then, the highest-ranking of the lot is virtually dialogue-free. Perhaps it’s just easier to be amused in your own language than in one you don’t speak.\n\nAnd what about all that old stuff? All there on merit, and arguably underrepresented: in their own completely different ways, the comedy of the silent and screwball eras pinned down the human condition with a precision that I’m not sure can ever be beat. You could, I think, fill out a credible top 40 containing nothing made after the Second World War – but that would be unfair on everyone who came later. So here’s a broad selection, complete with justifications – though for any/all of them, feel free to read “I LOLed”.\n\n40. Airplane! (1980)\n\nJim Abrahams and David and Jerry Zucker’s raucous debut was far from the first film to send up a current Hollywood trend – in this case, the increasingly bloated disaster films of the studios’ postwar years. But it was the one that turned the parody movie into a recognisable and (until relatively recently) bankable genre in itself.\n\nThere’s no secret to it beyond the sheer quantity and speed of its gags, but its masterstroke was the casting of Leslie Nielsen – then a primarily serious actor – who would become a staple of future Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker spoofs. Read our Airplane! review\n\n12. City Lights (1931)\n\nCharlie Chaplin made comedy look so natural, it often feels as if his Little Tramp alter ego is making the film up as he goes along. But a pivotal sequence in this – the last and greatest of his silent features – was the work of months, even though it runs on screen for barely three minutes.\n\nIt was the scene in which Virginia Cherrill’s blind flower girl had to somehow mistakenly take the penniless Chaplin for a millionaire: after countless stressful on-set improvisations and experiments, he came up with the idea of having her hear a limousine drive off shortly after their interaction and wrongly assume the vehicle must be his. (In Chaplin’s world, sound was not to be trusted.)\n\nCherrill, a 20-something newcomer, was driven to distraction by the process: Chaplin even harangued her over her delivery of the line, “Flower, sir?”, because the intonation wasn’t quite right. (Again: this was for a silent film.) In the end, nailing the scene down took 342 takes, shot in five distinct stretches over the course of two years. The result is the fruit of its maker’s perfectionism – and of course, it looks effortless.\n\n7. Annie Hall (1977)\n\nThe greatest film Woody Allen ever made was also the Woodiest of them all: a New York-set romance full of agony and yearning and a wrenching awareness of life’s brevity, all expressed through a barrage of immaculately turned jokes. It opens in post-mortem mode, with Allen’s Alvy Singer telling the audience he can’t figure out why his relationship with Annie ended.\n\nBy way of an answer, the following 90 minutes describes the contours of a precious and mutually formative relationship that dies for the same reasons it came to life in the first place – the friction between its two parties – and also because, more broadly, all beautiful things eventually must.\n\nWith her quirky manner and perkily androgynous outfits, Diane Keaton’s Annie could hardly be less of a clichéd dream woman. But their chemistry – which is also the chemistry of New York City itself – makes their romance irresistible, and sets out the winning formula for the modern rom-com as we know it. Read our Annie Hall review\n\n6. Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)\n\nOften wrongly and limitingly described as satire, Sacha Baron Cohen’s work cuts a lot deeper than Have I Got News for You. In fact – as evinced by his first feature-length outing as his Kazakh roving reporter alter ego, directed by Larry Charles – the British comedian’s speciality is clowning, albeit of a dark, grotesque sort that corners the audience with their own laughter, turning us into the butt of the joke.\n\nBorat isn’t a send-up of central Asian TV journalists, or non-westerners in general. Rather, he’s every absurd and unexamined first-world fear about foreigners, wrapped up in an ill-fitting, cement-coloured suit. As such, while travelling across the United States, this impossible figure is able to effortlessly break through the locals’ rational defences, hauling their fears, neuroses and prejudices (and, occasionally, unsung kindness and tolerance too) into the sunlight.\n\nBaron Cohen’s near-suicidal nerve as a performer – seen again in 2009’s underrated Brüno – adds yet another layer to the comedy: it’s impossible to watch him at work without constantly wondering how he isn’t being arrested and/or beaten up. As a document of America on the brink of post-Bush Jr meltdown, the resulting film is invaluable; as a comedy it leaves you reeling on the ropes.\n\n3. The Awful Truth (1937)\n\nThere are two groups of people in this world: those who consider this first of three collaborations between Cary Grant and Irene Dunne to be the greatest romantic comedy ever made, and those who haven’t yet got around to watching it. Leo McCarey’s raucously steamy divorce farce stars the duo as a separating couple bent on sabotaging one another’s rebound flings – only to realise in the process that the two are better suited than anyone else they’re ever likely to meet.\n\nNot only is it outrageously funny, it’s also a wonderful film about what it means to make someone laugh. Grant and Dunne’s amusement at each other’s ploys often has an orgasmic quality: the two leave each other helpless in ways rival lovers simply can’t match. (Witness the absurdly sexy tickling scene, in which Grant, hiding behind the apartment door, stimulates Dunne with a pen as she listens to a gentleman caller’s dreadful poetry.)\n\nAdapted from a stage play, the film’s script was written by the racy former lit-girl sensation Viña Delmar – but it was largely torn up on set by McCarey, a veteran of Laurel and Hardy and Marx Brothers films, who encouraged the cast to improvise as much as possible. Grant, who was used to the far more regimented methods at Paramount, initially panicked and begged the head of Columbia Pictures to get him off the film – but within a week, he was doing some of the funniest work of his life.\n\n2. Some Like It Hot (1959)\n\nIf comedy is what happens when pleasure collides with surprise, it’s surely impossible to argue with this list’s top two. Billy Wilder’s cross-dressing screwball escapade provides the first of those in giddy abundance: Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon dodge the mob in drag with mostly unwitting assistance from an incandescent Marilyn Monroe – who wasn’t merely the hot that some like, but boundlessly warm and witty too, with an underplayed ache of sadness that gives the film its rare spiritual lift.\n\nWilder may have often been decried as a misanthrope, but what’s striking today is how generous this particular film is: both to its viewers, who are pounded with perfectly tuned zingers and scrapes from the off, and its characters, all of whom the film is besotted with, flaws and all. Hence the power of the script’s immortal last line, dreamt up on the day by Wilder’s co-writer IAL Diamond.\n\nAt its time, the whole thing was a provocation, since the depiction of men in women’s clothing was still forbidden by the Motion Picture Association of America’s Production Code. The script’s numerous double entendres were too – so when it came to the business of certification, the MPAA sniffily told Wilder they weren’t going to give him one. No problem: his film thrived regardless, throwing open the doors of a new era of comedic freedom as it did so."
