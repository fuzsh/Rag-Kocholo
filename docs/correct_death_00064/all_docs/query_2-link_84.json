        "text": "Coming in fashionably late (*cough* not the first time for one of my theme months, but I digress), this is the last post for Forgotten Comedians Month 3, sponsored by Undercrank Productions! Thanks to everyone who read along during the past few weeks and left comments, it’s much appreciated and I’m glad you enjoyed it!\n\nLige Conley is among the sea of “lesser than Chaplin” silent comedy faces who worked steadily in slapstick shorts, hoped to cultivate a following while trying out various personas, and frequently risking life and limb for laughs. And yet, there’s something about his face that stands out to me…mainly because it somehow manages to look like a vague mixture of every famous comedian.\n\nYou’ve got a big dash of Chaplin and Stan Laurel, a touch of Buster Keaton…his smile could really channel Harold Lloyd at times, too.\n\nHeck, he even looked a bit like Charley Bowers–so there’s minor comedians mixed up in there.\n\nBut while his screen character was never as distinct and charismatic as, say, Harry Langdon’s baby-faced innocent or Max Linder‘s manic-eyed boulevardier, Conley did manage to become a starring player in several comedy series. The secret to his success? One word: mayhem.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nNowadays there’s a lot of hubbub about actresses in modern comedies, with plenty of well-meaning people proclaiming that the existence of Melissa McCarthy or Kristen Wiig proves that, at last, folks are figuring out that ladies can be funny too! It only took 130 years, y’all! No one has ever, ever noticed this before, and no, I’ve never heard of Mabel Normand or seen I Love Lucy, why do you ask?\n\nBut, as the introduction to James L. Neibaur’s latest book The Hal Roach Shorts of Thelma Todd, ZaSu Pitts and Patsy Kelly points out, the funny ladies of film have been with us far longer than that–since the darn dawn of cinema, I would add. A few perfect examples from the Golden Age of Comedy are Thelma Todd, ZaSu Pitts, and Patsy Kelly, who starred together in a number of shorts in the 1930s (Todd and Pitts were a comedy team for a few years; when Pitts left the Roach studio in 1933 Patsy Kelly took over her half of the team). While there are a couple biographies of ZaSu available and several about Thelma (due to her tragic death in 1935), Neibaur’s book is the first to examine the short comedies of these frequently overlooked comediennes. Continue reading →\n\nIn these first weeks of September 2015, silent Hollywood lost two more of its own. On September 4th Jean Darling, one of the child actors in “Our Gang” shorts during the late ’20s, passed away at the age of 93. Not long after this news sunk in (and before I had time to post an appropriate piece on Jean), another Our Gang alumni passed away on September 10: 89-year-old Dickie Moore, who debuted in silent films as a baby and starred in the famous series during the Depression era.\n\nContinue reading →"
