        "text": "Harold “Hal” Roach was an Elmira boy, born the son of Charles and Mabel Roach, of Columbia Street, on Jan. 14, 1892. Although others called him “Hal,” his mother called him “Harry.”\n\nHis first job was as a newspaper delivery boy. One of his customers lived at Quarry Farm — Samuel Clemens.\n\nIn several Star-Gazette interviews, Roach said his childhood in Elmira was a happy one. In one interview he said, “Elmira was a fine place for a boy to grow up.” He recalled playing in Grove Park as a child. After his death in 1992, Elmira renamed the park pavilion in his honor.\n\nRoach claimed to have “attended and been kicked out of almost every school in Elmira.” St. Patrick’s, Booth and Elmira Free Academy schools officially claim him as a former student. He attended EFA for a short period and played on its football team. After his EFA expulsion in 1908 at age 16, his father “strongly suggested” that Roach leave home in hopes that “traveling would help him grow up.”\n\nRoach went as far from Elmira as he could — Alaska. He mined for gold, and when that did not prove advantageous, he delivered mail for two years in “Uncle Sam’s service” (in Alaska) riding a horse for long distances through the wilderness.\n\nAfter nearly losing one foot to frostbite, Roach decided upon a less strenuous job. While on vacation in Los Angeles, he happened to meet some people connected with the motion picture business, and because of his riding skills learned while delivering mail, he secured himself a job as an extra in a movie.\n\nWhile working as an extra, the director placed him in a gambling den scene. The director did not know the game nor did the other extras, but Roach did. He straightened out some details, and the director rewarded him a regular job. Roach worked hard and finally became the assistant director.\n\nEventually in 1915, he formed a company with Dan Linthicum, who supplied the money while Roach supplied the brains. They took the first letters of their names, R-O-L-I-N, as their company name.\n\nThe companies that bought their movies went broke, and with Rolin’s capital down to zero, Roach decided to risk it all on one last effort. Their next movie had no story, or “rhyme or reason.” Roach called it “Just Nuts” with Harold Lloyd, and sent it to the Pathè Movie Co. Pathè bought it and asked for several more. Roach’s company had more good players — including Harry Pollard and Bebe Daniels.\n\nRolin had its own studio, several directors and all the money it needed. Roach worked hard for his success. Elmira’s Regent Theater made famous his “Lonesome Luke” comedies locally.\n\nRoach neither bought nor wrote any scenario. He thought out comedy situations, outlined his ideas to his company and put his crew to it. This method proved successful. According to his IMDB listing, Roach produced 650 films in his lifetime.\n\nIn 1937, his mother, Mabel Roach, visited Elmira to renew acquaintances with her old friends. She told the Star-Gazette that since she moved to California in 1916, she had met Joan Crawford, Mary Pickford, Claudette Colbert and Jean Harlow.\n\nMrs. Roach said she was proud of her son, and she and her husband were reluctant to leave Elmira when Hal coaxed them to move to California, “where there was real living.” She said she did not regret moving west, although she missed her friends in Elmira.\n\nShe lived at her son’s studio in Culver City, California, until her death. Hal Roach died in 1992 at age 100. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.\n\nDiane Janowski is Elmira City historian. Her columns appear monthly in the Star-Gazette."
