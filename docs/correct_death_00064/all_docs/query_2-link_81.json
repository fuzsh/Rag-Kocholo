        "text": "Hal Roach, a founding father of American motion picture comedy who discovered and helped develop the talents of such superstars of the early cinema as Harold Lloyd, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, died Nov. 2 in California. He was 100.\n\nHe died at his home in Bel-Air of pneumonia, a friend, Richard Bann, told the Associated Press.\n\nMr. Roach, a producer and director, was present at the very beginnings of the American film industry. He started as an extra in a 1912 western and within less than three years had his own production studio. In 1922, he made a short comedy called \"Our Gang,\" initiating a series that would amuse and delight moviegoers for generations. He established a comic partnership that would last for more than three decades when he teamed up Laurel and Hardy in 1927.\n\nTwo of his pictures, a 1932 Laurel and Hardy movie called \"The Music Box\" and a 1936 film in the \"Our Gang\" series called \"Bored of Education,\" won Academy Awards for best short film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1955, Mr. Roach turned his studio over to his son and retired from the movie business. But he remained on the Hollywood scene and over the years came to be known as a Grand Old Man of American cinema. He was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1984 for an \"unparalleled record of distinguished contributions to the motion picture art form.\"\n\nHis 1914 discovery of Harold Lloyd, then working as an extra for Universal Pictures, gave Mr. Roach his first star and enabled him to become the only major rival of Mack Sennett in the production of silent film comedy shorts during the 1920s.\n\nUnder Mr. Roach's guidance and over time, Lloyd developed his own cimematic persona. He put on horn-rimmed glasses. He was sincere and soft-spoken, and sometimes a little naive. Yet his character had a bedrock foundation of honor and decency that made him the quintessential boy-next-door. During the 1920s Lloyd would surpass Charlie Chaplin in box office popularity, specializing in situations where he placed himself in extreme and bizarre physical danger, but always escaped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn putting Laurel and Hardy together, Mr. Roach created what would become the first major comic partnership in motion picture history, and one that set the stage for others that followed, such as Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. The two actors in Mr. Roach's team complemented each other superbly. Laurel, an Englishman who came to the United States with the same vaudeville troupe as Chaplin, was a weak and whining simpleton. Hardy, a native Georgian who began his show business career as a singer and bit player, was a pompous, self-important lout and bully.\n\nTypically, their films followed a story line in which a single incident would escalate to a level of catastrophic dimensions, invariably with the help of the stupidity, vengefulness and pig-headedness of the two comedians.\n\nFrom 1927 to 1929, Laurel and Hardy made 27 silent film shorts for Mr. Roach, and because they had trained for the stage they made an easy transition into sound movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHal Roach was born Jan. 14, 1892, in Elmira, N.Y., where his mother operated a boarding house and his father sold jewelry. He left home for Seattle, intending to visit a relative, when he was 16, and he never returned. From Seattle, he sailed to Alaska, where he prospected for gold, then drove teams of horses and mules along a road under construction between Valdez and Fairbanks.\n\nLater he drifted south to Los Angeles. He was a construction superintendent working on horseback in the Mojave Desert when in 1912 he noticed a newspaper advertisement seeking extras to play motion picture cowboys at Universal Studios. Mr. Roach put on his boots and spurs, his bandanna and Stetson hat, went to Universal and got the job. \"They offered me a dollar and lunch, two sandwiches and a banana. But all I really wanted was to see how films were made,\" he recalled decades later.\n\nIn his first day on the job, Mr. Roach noticed that the wheel and ball on a roulette wheel were going in the same direction in a film sequence of a gambling hall scene. He pointed out the mistake to the director and was promptly hired as a technical adviser at $5 a day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith funds saved from this compensation and a small inheritance, Mr. Roach opened his own studio. He sold his first film with Harold Lloyd for $850.\n\nIt was almost by accident that Mr. Roach became the creator of the \"Our Gang\" films. As he recalled some years later, he was sitting in his office one day when he opened a window to get some fresh air:\n\n\" . . . there were about a half dozen kids playing out there with some scraps of wood. One little kid claims a bigger kid has got his stick, and he's trying to get the other kids to back him in this argument.\n\n\"Now you know in the next block they're all gonna throw these sticks away, but watching them you'd think their lives depended on who got that stick. And I spent 15 minutes waiting to find out how it turned out. I thought, 'Why? These are just kids doing the things that kids do.' So I said to myself, 'I'll make a comedy about regular kids doing the things that regular kids do.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first of those films was a smashing success, and there would be dozens more each year throughout the 1920s and into the 1930s. By 1938, when Mr. Roach sold the series to MGM, the films had become one of the most famous series in motion picture history.\n\nThree years later Mr. Roach's film-making career was interrupted by the U.S. entry into World War II. He served as a major in the Army Signal Corps during the war, then returned to Hollywood after the war to resume operation of his studio, making productions for both the movies and television until he sold the studio to his son, Hal Roach Jr.\n\nHis first wife, Marguerite O. Roach, died in 1941. Hal Roach Jr. died in 1972, and their daughter, Margaret, also preceded her father in death.\n\nMr. Roach also was preceded in death by his second wife, Lucille. They had three daughters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSTANLEY R. DURKEE\n\nBroker\n\nStanley Robbins Durkee, 84, a retired senior partner in the Washington brokerage of Johnston Lemon & Co.
