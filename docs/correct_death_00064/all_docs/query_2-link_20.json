        "text": "\"There are many reasons why Laurel and Hardy were a great comedy team,\" Hal Roach once explained, \"but one of the basic reasons is that each was a perfect straight man for the other. Each was individually brilliant as a comedian, yet each could serve as a foil for the other. They complemented each other perfectly.\"\n\n\"Basically the Stan and Ollie characters were childlike, innocent. The best visual comedians imitate children really. No one could do this as well as Laurel and Hardy, and still be believable. We always strived for that and we sure must have succeeded. . . . People like that aren't around anymore.\""
