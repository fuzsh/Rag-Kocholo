        "text": "”The King of Blarney” is dead.\n\nIrish comic Hal Roach, who entertained audiences for more than 60 years, died on Feb. 28 at the age of 84, according to Irish Central, the online home of Irish Voice and Irish America.\n\nThe Waterford native was comedian-in-residence at Jurys Cabaret in Dublin, where he entertained millions of visiting Irish-Americans.\n\nHe published several books and scores of recordings of Irish humor.\n\nRoach played before five U.S. presidents and toured from Australia to Las Vegas.\n\nHe was no stranger to Western Massachusetts.\n\nHolyoke lawyer Maurice J. Ferriter, a longtime friend, said that Roach had been a regular visitor to the Paper City since 1976. Many of his local performances were for charity.\n\nI have never met a more amazing individual,” Ferriter said. “He was a great guy. We will miss him.”\n\nFerriter recalled Roach stopping by the Yankee Pedlar for a drink and chatting with the public.\n\nHe last performed here at the Log Cabin Banquet and Meeting House in Holyoke in March 2004.\n\nIn a 1995 interview with the Union-News, Roach said he prepared by always studying the languages and picking up the local dialects so his stories would not fall flat. He believed laughter was the best medicine.\n\n“When you laugh it releases endorphins, which have a healing effect. I call laughter interior jogging,” Roach said.\n\nRoach told the Union-News comics are insecure.\n\n“Comics are lonely, and what they do is unnatural. In many ways it’s very sad,” Roach said. “Comics are introverts who act like an extrovert. It’s the only way they can cope.”"
