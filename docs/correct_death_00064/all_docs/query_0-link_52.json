        "text": "1893 Â· The World's Columbian Exposition\n\nAlso known as the Chicago World's Fair, The Exposition was held to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the New World. The centerpiece of the Fair was a large water pool that represented Columbus's voyage across the Atlantic to the Americas. The Fair had a profound effect on new architecture designs, sanitation advancement, and the arts. The Fairgrounds were given the nickname the White City due to its lavish paint and materials used to constuct it. Over 27 million people attended the fair during its six-month of operation. Among many of the invetions exhibited there was the first Ferris wheel built to rival the Eiffel Tower in France.\n\n1918 Â· Attempting to Stop the War\n\nTo end World War I, President Wilson created a list of principles to be used as negotiations for peace among the nations. Known as The Fourteen Points, the principles were outlined in a speech on war aimed toward the idea of peace but most of the Allied forces were skeptical of this Wilsonian idealism."
