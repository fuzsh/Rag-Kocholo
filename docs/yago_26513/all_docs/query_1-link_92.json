        "text": "The reincarnated Lost love Trope:\n\nFor many years now a popular trope in Hollywood and pop culture fiction has been the reincarnated lost love look-a-like story. An immortal character seeks the reinarnation of his lost love and immediately finds her in a contemporary Look-a-like who is the exact age his tragic love had been when she died.\n\nThis was done in Universal's mummy movies.\n\nThe idea did not become completely mainstream in America until 1966 when the vampire Barnabas Collins (In the TV series Dark Shadows) sought the reincarnation of his lost love, Josette. He found that the waitress Maggie Evans (played by the same actress) might be her.\n\nThe use of it in Dark Shadows was so well received that Dan Curtis (the creator of Dark Shadows) used the plot again for his Dracula movie starring Jack Palance. The movie was originally titled Bram Stoker's Dracula.\n\nThe trope was used in the comedy Love at First Bite and off-handedly discussed with Renfield and Dracula toward the beginning of the movie. \"But I lost her in that damn London fog!\"\n\nIn 1985's Fright Night the vampire Jerry Dandridge (who may have been Dracula himself using an alias) remarks how much Amy looks like a woman in an old painting whom he once loved. This is a direct nod to a painting that hung in The Old House (where Barnabas resided) in the original Dark Shadows.\n\nThe trope was solidified in modern pop culture in 1992 when it was used for Bram Stoker's Dracula, the version directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Gary Oldman as Dracula. This one specifically showed the flashback of fifteenth century Vlad Tepes (Meaning the Impaler) AKA Vladislaus Drakulya (what he actually signed on documents), Dracula when he was human and the untimely death of his first wife who committed suicide. Vlad himself would have become the fictional vampire roughly around 1476 / 1477 at the age of forty five or forty six when he was murdered.\n\nHistorically the reason she committed suicide was to save herself from being killed by Ottoman Turks, whom she feared were going to take the castle. Her last words were \"Better to be food for the fishes than a prisoner of the Turks.\" Strangely no one remembers her name. The Tributary that runs under Poenari Castle is named for her (Râul Doamnei) \"The River Princess\" but no one recalls what her name truly was. Vlad's second wife was Ilona Szilágyi of Hungary, a relation of his second cousin, the King of Hungary. The first wife though, her identity has been lost. Many think her name was Elizabeta (or variations of that) because of the 1992 movie). One film names her Marina and another calls her Lydia (Dark Prince: The True Story of Dracula). Her name might have been lost because she was not born to royalty. She may have been a peasant or concubine that Vlad deemd worthy enough to be his princess.\n\nAfter the 1992 movie you saw the trope in all sorts of young adult fiction from Vampire Diaries to The Fallen. People ate it up and especially loved it in vampire fiction.\n\nJapanese anime (which already had strong reincarnation themes in a lot of their fiction) even embraced this particular version of reincarnation for the anime InuYasha among others.\n\nThe trope was used for NBC's attempted Dracula series of 2013.\n\nIt became so common that people thought it was in the original Dracula novel. The irony is the original Dracula novel never had Mina and Dracula fall in love. The most you got was a scene of Mina showing pity for Dracula and hoping they could free his soul from the torment of being a vampire and allow him to ascend to Heaven.\n\nI happen to like the trope. My biggest qualms about it are when people think that their favorite particular recent fiction to depict it was the first to do it.\n\nThis trope dates back almost eighty years. Beliefs in reincarnation are much older than that but the look-a-like reincarnated lost love who looks just like her own previous lives was actually the result of... budget.\n\nThe original purpose of the trope was actually very petty. It was to save money. To have an actor or actress play multiple roles (as was common with Dan Curtis' TV series, Dark Shadows) was a method of saving money. it was cheaper to pay one actor two or more roles than to pay two separate actors or actresses.\n\nThere was a time when we actually acknowledged that real reincarnation meant you could come back looking like anyone. Professor Abraham Van Helsing had as much chance of being Dracula's first wife reborn as Mina did. In fact I think I would like to see that! Yes. Let's see a version of Dracula daring enough to have Abraham Van Helsing be Dracula's long lost reborn love.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola just happened to be kind in giving hints that yes, Mina really was Dracula's first wife reborn in his 1992 movie, and that version of Mina was even starting to remember her past life while out drinking absinthe.\n\nSo there you have it, the history of the reincarnated lost love who happens to be the exact same appearance and age in the show or film's contemporary setting. It’s kind of of odd that Dracula is so attached to this trope considering Vlad the Impaler was Catholic at the time of his death / when he would have become a vampire in late 1476 or early 1477. The dates are a bit fuzzy, but he was definitely dead (or undead...) by the third week of 1477."
