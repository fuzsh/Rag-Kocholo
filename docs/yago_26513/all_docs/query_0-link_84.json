        "text": "(please note, this text is under construction, possible errors are to be excused)\n\nRise once more, o Tepes! Take and divide these men\n\nAs lunatics and rogues in two big tribes, and then\n\nIn mighty, twin infirmaries by force both tribes intern,\n\nAnd with a single faggot prison and madhouse burn.\n\n(Mihai Eminescu – Satire III. English version by Corneliu M. Popescu)\n\nThe quote above written by the Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu in the 19 century describes at his best the folkloric and patriotic recognition of Vlad Dracula, known here more as Vlad the Impaler. Vlad the Impaler was essential for building the national aspirations of the Romanians at that time, and soon he become an example of authority a price of the law with the power to handle the corruption with rood hand by his own will. His methods were presented by Eminescu as a cure for the society.\n\nThere are no evidence that Vlad himself ever was called as the Impaler, but he was proud of his family name of Dracul, and signed the documents of his time with Dracula. The first evidence of Vlad Dracula as Vlad the Impaler are from the Turks, as kaziklu bey, in Turkish chronicles form the 15. century.\n\nBram Stoker heard first of Dracula from the work of William Wilkinson (British consul in Wallachia and Moldova): An Acount of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldova, published 1820. Here was little said about Vlad, he was described as a Wallachian Prince that opposed the Turks and no mention about his affinity to impaling his prisoner. Wikinson makes a remark in his paper that will attract Stoker attention: in wllachian language, Dracula stays for devil.\n\nWhy Dracula?\n\nThe ethimology of the name of “drac” in the Wallachian language will change starting with Vlad. “Drac” in old Wallachian stood for dragon. It was the father of Vlad, Vlad II, that was made by emperor Sigismund in 1408, Knight o the Order of the Dragons, in Nurnberg. He will soon adopt the cognomen of Dracul, wallahian appelation for tha latin “draco”, the dragon. Vlad III, his son, borned 1431 in Schäßburg (Sighișoara), will use his father name as Dracula, as the “Son of the Dragon” and remain in history as Dracula and later Vlad the Impaler. The nick name of “tepes” “kaziklu bey” “the impaler” will tell the story of his atrocities along with the chronicles of the Transylvanian Saxons, the Slavic manuscripts and Turkish documents describing the military campaign from 1461/62\n\nStories, Legends and Chronicles\n\nSaxon stories tell about the Prince Dracula that heard that merchants from Hermannstadt (Sibiu) and Kronstadt (Braosv), Petermann, and Peter Gereb von Rot are supporting a step brother of Vlad to become Prince in Transylvania, giving the Saxons more control over the customs toll at the borders with Transylvania and Wallahia and at Giurgiu at the Danube river. Dracula entered Transylvania burning the villages of Kasholz, Neudorf and Hosman and moved toll clearance to Wallahia. After the saxons protested to hungarain King Mathias asking for help, Dracula entered Transylvania once more burning the fileld and conquering the town Kronstadt (Corona, Braosv) and Bartholomeus village. Here he had a feast, invited the leaders of the Saxons in front of the Gesprengberg, near the chapel of Holy Jacob, and atackted them during the feast beheaded them and trowing the heads of 43 (55 in other sources) Saxons in a pyramid in the middle of the table he continued the feast with his men. One o his Generals failed to conquer the nearby city Zeiden (Codlea), he ended up at the top of the pyramid.\n\n“Von ainem wutrich der hies Trakle waida von der Walachei“\n\n“Story of a Madman Named Dracula of Wallachia”\n\n(Michael Beheim. Poem, written and performed at the court of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor)\n\nMany legends and stories were told about Vlad Dracula in the years to come, some in the late 15. early 16. century, others later in the romantic era during the search of national heroes by the newly born Romanian state. There are stories and accounts, legends and historical facts such as letters, documents or chronicles. It is to be differentiate between popular folklore, the negative campaign among the Saxons or Turkish Chronicles that tried to explain that the Turkish army was defeated. Into the end it was the collective “memorie” that inspired Bram Stoker to choose Transylvania, and Dracula for his novel. However legend or not there are incontestable historical evidence, in Romanian documents, including his own letters, as in foreign ones that Vlad III called Dracula murdered, tortured or ordered the murder and killing of thousands of people.\n\nRomantic tales are figuring Dracula as the lawmaker as a prince that opposed denigrated customs like begging (as considered in the 19. century), theft, cheating … It is said, he, Vlad Dracula ordered a feast for all beggars to be held, they eat and drunk for two days and two nights, in the third one he closed them in a barn an burned them alive.\n\nAccounts say that would drive a stake through the mother’s breast and the baby’s head would be imapeld on her breast. He never considered gender or age. Other stories say that men, women, and children were boiled to death, skinned alive, crucified, or had their sexual organs cut off.\n\n“Usually the impaled victims were arranged in concentric circles on the outskirts of the cities where they could be viewed by all. Victims were subjected to nails driven into their heads, maiming of limbs, blinding, strangulation, or the hacking off of noses and ears”\n\n(Dracula: Biography of Vlad the Impaler. by Radu Florescu , Raymond T. McNally).\n\nRecord mention a massacre in Amlas on 24 August 1460 where 20,000 were killed.\n\nOn 11. February 1462 he writes a letter to his cousin King Matthias of Hungary telling that he bumped an exact number of 23844 Turks, noting an exact number by counting their beheaded heads\n\n“it all stared in Obluciţa and Novoselo, where 1.350 Turks where killed and beheaded; then Cartal and Durostor, 6.840 Turks; Orşova 342, Vectrem 840, Turtucaia 630 and Marotin 210 at Giurgiu 6.414 Turks were bumped. Novigrad 384, Siştov 410, Ghighen 1.138, Rahova 1.460. In total: 20.018, the rest to 23.884 were killed on the way, amoung them Bulgars and other opponents”\n\n(Letter sent to King Matthias by Vlad Dracula)\n\nThe legend says that together with this letter hi also sent to Buda (Budapest) the heads of the 23.844 Turks, being sorry that only this he could count, many others were burned alive, left on the field or drown in the river Danube.\n\nThe Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror returned from the campaign in Corinth to stop this massacre, asking once more for conciliation he sent messengers to Vlad asking the tribute to be payed to the Sublime Porte. The legend says that Dracula nailed their turbans in the skull and send their heads to Mehmed.\n\nIn the night of 16 to 17 June 1462 he railed the Turkish army camp (led by sultan Mehmed) with his men dressed in Turks, let them to massacre them self by disorienting them, killed, beheaded or/and impaled them killing almost everyone who was caught. Many heads were brought to Targoviste, his chair town and put on a stake outside the city walls, to be seen by the Turkish army.\n\n“Legend tells that even the ruthless (Turkish) Conqueror was moved to tears when he visited the scene of Vlad’s hideous exploit and saw a whole valley desolate yet peopled with its thousands of stakes, on which still hung the mangled remains of impaled Turks and Bulgars”\n\n(Seton, Watson, A History of the Romanians: Vlad the Impaler)\n\nDracula’s attack was celebrated by the Pope, Venetians, King Matthias, even by the Saxons from Transylvania, as “an celebration of the whole Christianity”\n\nHistorians assign his horrors on his childhood as he and his brother were held captive by the Turks, raised in Istanbul were friends of his died, as records say of an infection caused by sexual abuse, very likely Vlad was also abused. He we also be trained here to become a warrior, in ridding horses, fighting, but also in logic, the Quran and Turkish literature and language. Vlad Dracula will become for tree times Prince of Wallachia. As the father of Vlad and his older brother, Mircea II, the hair of Wallachia were killed by local boyars with the support of John Hunyadi, in the winter o 1447? the Ottomans put Vlad on the throne in Wallachia as Vlad III. A short reign as Hunyadi returned to Wallachia putting Vlad on the run (to Moldova, leter to Buda, and back to Constantinople). A local supporter of Hunyadi will become ruller in Wallachia: Vladislav II, later killed by Vlad in combat in 1456, becoming for the second time Prince of Wallahia, ruling from 1456 to 1462.\n\nThe night attack of Targoviste was short lived by Dracula he was soon forced to retreat in the fortress of Poenari, the boyars searched for privileges at the Ottomans as the Turks supported Radu the Beautiful, his younger brother on the Wallachian throne as Bey of Wallachia.\n\nSearching for help to his cousin Matthias Corvinus in Hungary he was imprisoned in Hungary, firt, near Dimbovicioara, probably he spent also some days in the Bran Castle, but there are no records to support this, or at Huda lui Papara cave in Alba county, on his way to Buda, where he was imprisoned at Visegrád, ten years later at Buda castle in the Budavar Labyrinth famous in the turitical maps of Budapest today, of holding Dracula imprisoned there for years. Some historians claim he was imprisoned for 12 years from 1462 to 1475, other sources and evideces are talking about a short prison stay.\n\nOf course the legend passes the records involving Dracula in an romance with Matthias young sister, an affair of wich is told a son was born to Dracula. as King Matthias figured it out he expelled Vlad back to Wallachia, where he become once more Prince after the sudden death of his brother till 1467?1477. (Other legends involve Vlad Dracula in a longtime affair, lasting more then 20 years with a Saxon girl from Kronstadt (Brasov), and had 5 children with her, a sort of an unpermitted love.\n\nIt is little known about the women in the life of Vlad Dracula, there are at least 2 marriages reported. The first one with Elisabetta, mother of Mihnea the Evil One, son of Dracula (Prince of Wallachia 1508-1510, murdered 1510 in Hermanstadt, buried there in the Roman Catholic Church where he was cornered by the bojars of Craiovescu faction). Elisabetta died in the siege of Poenari Fortress, according to local legends. Other sources tell that she committed suicide, jumping over the cliffs at Poenari in the river below, called Today, the River of the Lady. (Raul Doamnei). The second marriage was with a cousin, or the sister of King Matthias in Buda where he lived with her: Ilona Szilágyi. The couple had at least two sons: Vlad Dracul IV, who lived at the court of King Matthias and another one, unknown by name, mentioned in Transylvania for a period then at the court in Buda. Their descendents lived in Hungary and married there.\n\nReturning to Wallachia he will begin his 3rd reign for a short period before beeing killed in a battle with the Turks. (from 1476 – 77?) It is little known about his Death, not even how he really died, presumed in a battle between end of November and December 1476, other stories say that he was lured by the Wallachian bojares in a forest and assassinated.) It is for sure he was dead on 10 of January 1477, as evidence are stipulating. The exact location of his death is also unknow, somewere between Bucharest and Giurgiu. There are claims that his head was brought to Istanbul and the body buried at Comana Monestery, other historical sources claim that he was buried at the island monastery of Snagov. In early 2014, historians from Poland published researches that Dracula didn’t died in the winter of 1476, that he manged to escape and retreated with the Knights of the Order of the Dragons in southern Italy, probably Napoli, as evidence a tomb discovered in south Italy last year with the heraldic symbols of the Draculea Order on it. (future researches are planed)\n\nVlad III, Prince of Wallachia, known as Dracula, the Son of the Dragon, or the Impaler, will be remembered in the folklore and collective “memoire”, as a hand of justice that will impale his enemies, show their bodies for days outside his castle, to scare those that wold try not to obey his will and justice… as a redeemer and lawmen for Romanian nationalist, as secular as religious, as human as devil, a Prince with multiple faces and masks. Finally it was nor the Romanian nationalist image, nor the history that made Vlad Dracula known to everyone, the legends, the negative propaganda of the Saxons, his atrocities changed the etymology of dragon to be known as devil in the modern Romanian language. This will glimmer in Stokers head an decide to “godfather” his Count from Count Vampyr into Count Dracula, a Székely noble vampire from Transylvania. Dracula will become in the years to come the most prolific myth in the world of Vampires, a figure to last for decades, putting historians, novelist and researches on the write, there are today more then 1500 books out there about Dracula, from novels to historical researches over band desene, to manga, even hentai and pornographic stories. More then 250 movies were made, the Nosferatu in 1922 was the introduction to this kind of world that brought as Bela Lugosi’s Dracula in 1931, the landmark movie in Dracula’s filmography. Anime movies and cartoons pictured Dracula, even The Family Guy, the Simpsons or the Donald Duck hared about the Count.\n\nThere are Dracula’s in the world for everyone, one for the children, another one for adults fascinated to the story, for tourist or kitsch business scalpers with Dracula souvenires\n\nHe must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land. (Bram Stoker, Dracula, Chapter 18, pp 145)"
