However, my Draco, though inspired by Mark Darcy, has a bit of the cad, Daniel Cleaver, thrown in as well (only his witty parts - not his cad parts).\n\nThe story includes several catch phrases and lines from Bridget Jones’ Diary. Also a tiny line from the series, Firefly. Can you identify them?\n\nThank you so much to my excellent Beta, icicle33.
