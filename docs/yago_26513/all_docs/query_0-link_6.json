        "text": "Where Ilona Falls Into The Dracula 2013 Story:\n\nIlona is a specter, a remembrance of a distant past, trapped by extraordinary love and the powerful memory of a horrific death. Across centuries she has cleaved to the half-life of her husband, Vlad, never leaving his side, never ceasing to reach to him from beyond the veil that has separated them. In the mid 19th century her faithfulness pays off as a baby girl is born to London doctor, William Murray and his wife. At the turn of the century Mina Murray, now a young woman, is thriving in Victorian London’s Industrial Revolution largely unaware that she is a dead ringer for a 15th century princess and wife of infamous warloard, Vlad The Impaler. As Vlad seeks to avenge Ilona’s unjust death, she works to make herself known to Mina in the hopes that the latter will at last accept Ilona’s spirit into her consciousness granting her new life.\n\nPersonality Traits:\n\nStrong willed | Determined | Sweet-hearted | Fiercely loyal | A lover | Brave\n\nJealous | Outspoken | Complex | Attracted to darkness | Quietly audacious\n\nIlona is imbued with a natural concern for the well being of those who suffer. She loves deeply and entirely, forever. She has the tendency to self-sacrifice to the extreme often lacking the ability to turn off her compassion in order to save herself from harm. Though handy with a blade and courageous enough to fight in the place of men with lesser valor, Ilona unknowingly requires a certain amount of protection because she simply will not guard herself against the kinds of evil that instinctively repel others.\n\nA Little Background:\n\nThis is one of those rare times when a film series has actually endeavored to honor the historical facts in its take on famous supernatural lore. In keeping with the theme set by Dracula’s (2013) writers here are some facts, which are integral to Ilona’s story. I weave these into her tale where appropriate but the particular facts listed herein should be treated as part of her headcanon.\n\nIlona was a real person\n\nPrincess Consort Ilona Szilágyi of Wallachia was the second wife of Vlad III, infamous Voivode known as The Impaler.\n\nThe Order of The Dragon Was An Actual Thing\n\nThe Order was created in the early 15th century as an order of chivalry for noblemen. As an organization for the protection of Christianity in vulnerable Eastern Europe, its knights represented a military answer to Islam and more specifically the Ottoman Turks. Vlad II, Vlad III’s (Dracula/Alexander Greyson) father, was a member of The Order.\n\nDracula was actually Vlad III’s patronymic name\n\nHis father, from the family house of Drăculești, was dubbed Vlad ‘Dracul’ at his induction into The Order of The Dragon. As that man’s son Vlad III was then designated ‘Dracula.’\n\nGood To Know:\n\nIlona pronounces her name with a long I.\n\nThe name Tepes is pronounced t’chepez where the ‘t’ is so lightly spoken that it is nearly silent.\n\nVlad and Ilona’s home, Wallachia is pronounced VIL-akia.\n\nIlona vs. Mina:\n\nThere are some clear questions here. What happens here? How will Ilona get into Mina; aren’t they already one woman? And what then? Does Ilona become Mina or Mina become Ilona? Will one be both? Do they chat together inside Mina’s head?”\n\nThe answers to these queries are not entirely fixed as they will be adjusted to meet different co-writers’ ideas but in Ilona’s thoughts it works like this; at some point Mina will fully recognize that she is somehow the flesh reincarnation of Ilona. That recognition will invite Ilona in by default, at which point Mina will be filled with all of Ilona’s memories though the ability to access them in totality won’t come on Mina all at once. Finally, Mina will cease to exist, so to speak; at least she will not exist as a separate entity. She will remember and believe in who she ‘is’ and *poof* she will answer to the name Ilona. She will retain the ‘Mina’ in her, ie. memories, feelings, abilities, some learned character traits, though none of these will be as strong as they once seemed to be because they are not her true self. Mina’s basic character will be a match to Ilona’s so they will meld fairly seamlessly with a few exceptions all of which are rooted in their very different upbringings and life experiences.\n\nGo here to see how the two women become one."
