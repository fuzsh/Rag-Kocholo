        "meta_description": "Vlad the Impaler was born in 1431 in Sighișoara, Voivodeship of Transylvania, in the Kingdom of Hungary, which is part of Romania today. His name at birth was Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia. His mother's true identity is uncertain but believed to have been Princess Cneajna of Moldavia and his father was Vlad II Dracul. His siblings included a younger brother Radu III the Handsome, and two older half-brothers named Vlad Călugărul and Mircea II. Vlad and his brother Radu were taken by the Ottoman Empire as teens as an insurance policy for their father, who ruled Wallachia, to remain loyal to the Ottomans against Hungary. Vlad III grew up and sided with Hungary in their ongoing war against the Ottomans. Vlad III was given the name Vlad the Impaler years after his death because of his habit of impaling enemies when he became Wallachia's ruler in 1448 and went to war against the Ottomans.",

        "text": "Interesting Vlad the Impaler Facts: The name Dracul, used by Vlad the Impaler's father, eventually grew to be associated with the word devil, but its use was originally an honor for those inducted into the Order of the Dragon. The Order of the Dragon was created in 1408 by Emperor Sigismund as a chivalric order. In 1442 Vlad III and his brother Radu were taken hostage by the Ottoman Empire's ruler at the time Sultan Murad II. This was meant to ensure Wallachia's loyalty. Vlad and Radu were schooled in the arts, science, and philosophy, among other subjects while living with their captors. They were also schooled in the art of war, learning how to ride a horse and use a sword. Some believe that Vlad the Impaler learned how to impale his enemy while being schooled by the Ottomans. Once Vlad became ruler of Wallachia in 1448, he chose to side with the Hungarians and fought the Ottoman Empire. He often impaled his victims to scare the invading Ottomans away. Vlad was the Prince of Wallachia for three periods. He ruled in 1448, again in 1456 to 1462, and in 1476, the year of his death. While alive Vlad was often referred to as Vlad Dracula, which means 'son of the dragon'. Vlad the Impaler married twice during his lifetime. His first wife's name is not known but she was believed to have been a Transylvanian noblewoman. His son from this marriage was names Mihnea cel Rau. His second wife gave him two sons. Her name was Ilona Szilagyi and she was also a noblewoman. Vlad the Impaler is believed to have loved blood as much as the fictional character Dracula, except he didn't drink it. He dipped bread in his victim's blood to eat. Vlad's father had been betrayed by his own people and buried alive with his eldest son when Vlad was a hostage to the Ottoman's as a teen. Vlad the Impaler got revenge by having those he suspected of the betrayal impaled."
