Afterwards he sat down for a picnic amongst the corpses. Their bodies were left to rot outside the city walls as a reminder of what would happen to any who disobeyed him. Later a famous woodcut commemorating the event was made.\n\nIn 1460, 10,000 persons were impaled in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu. In 1462, Mehmed the Conqueror, during his campaign against Wallachia, was greeted by the sight of 20,000 impaled Turkish prisoners of war outside of Dracula's capital of Târgoviste. Thoroughly sickened and unable to continue, he delegated command to one of his subordinates and returned to Constantinople.\n\nFather: Vlad II Dracul\n\nMother: (Moldavian princess, daughter of Prince Alexandru cel Bun)\n\nBrother: Mircea (d. 1447, buried alive)\n\nBrother: Vlad IV the Monk\n\nBrother: Radu the Handsome\n\nSister: Alexandra\n\nWife: (Romanian nobility, d. 1462, suicide)\n\nSon: Mihnea cel Rau (Prince of Wallachia)\n\nWife: Ilona Szilágyi (a relative of Matthias Corvinus)\n\nSon: Vlad\n\nTortured (by his Turkish captors)\n\nConverted to Catholicism 1475\n\nRotten Library Page:\n\nVlad the Impaler\n\nIs the subject of books:\n\nVlad Dracula: The Dragon Prince, 2004, BY: Michael Augustyn\n\nVlad the Impaler: In Search of the Real Dracula, 2004, BY: M.J.
