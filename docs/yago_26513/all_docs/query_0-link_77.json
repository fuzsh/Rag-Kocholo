        "text": "If you haven’t checked the updates to our review policy, please do. I am taking over in the meantime. Our latest I Love Romance Blog review selection is The Impaler’s Wife by Autumn Bardot. What a great read! 😀\n\nThe test of a good book is one that successfully tells a tale from which you can’t turn away. The test of a good writer is one who constructs characters anyone can care about, even if their beliefs may not align with the reader. Suspension of disbelief, and being drawn into the fictional world is key. Bardot’s The Impaler’s Wife is one such title. This gothic romance is thrilling, with unerring historical accuracy, and a hint of the legend of Dracula which most have heard of.\n\nI love tales about Dracula, and this one is just as fascinating. Housed in historical fiction, complete with gory descriptions of war and a tale of unrivaled passion, The Impaler’s Wife gives us a unique take on not only the legend of Dracula, but also a story of the man himself. Who is Vlad the Impaler? And, who is Ilona, the strong, amazing woman that falls for him?\n\nAs a reader, I was yanked into the tale from page one, equal parts mystified throughout, and by turns horrified yet unusually resigned to the circumstances. This book may test your faith in…well, everything you think you know. Bardot has an uncanny ability to make one of the most vilified historical figures utterly human. Or is he far more than that?\n\nIlona really comes into her own from the first time we encounter her – and that pivotal moment when Vlad approaches her – to the well-rounded, confident, strong female she becomes by the end of the book. I enjoyed learning about both characters.\n\nSo…is Dracula just a story? It is tempting to think otherwise. Bardot may make you a believer too. Take a chance on this read. You won’t be disappointed!\n\nI give this a rating of four hearts for an outstanding, unforgettable reading experience. Fantastic job, Autumn! ♥\n\nBook Info:\n\nA young woman is swept into a life of intrigue, revenge, passion, and betrayal when she falls for the world’s most notorious prince.\n\nThe year is 1464 and young King Matthias controls Hungary, his family, and the fate of the world’s most notorious political prisoner, Prince Vlad Dracula.\n\nIlona Szilágy, the king’s cousin, is young and ambitious. Dracula is determined to marry into the Hunyadi family. It is love at first sight, but the king has other plans. The Impaler Prince, however, never takes no for an answer.\n\nThis begins Ilona’s journey into the treacherous world of court intrigues, family betrayals, and her husband’s dark desires. Eager to become Vlad’s trusted confidante, Ilona soon discovers that marriage to a man tortured by his past comes with a price.\n\nWoven throughout is a peek into the life and times of one of the world’s most enigmatic and maligned rulers…the man before the legend.\n\nWith Bardot’s decadent period detail and a cast of gritty, evocative characters, The Impaler’s Wife offers a fierce yet sensuous glimpse into the violent 15th century.\n\nUniversal Reader link: https://books2read.com/u/3ygVlv\n\nHere are some teasers!\n\nAnd the book trailer…\n\nPlus, an intriguing excerpt!\n\nPrince Vlad rests his hand on the small of my back. “Come, Lady Ilona, look at the faces of anarchy and villainy, and see how much they resemble your friends and family.”\n\n“I will not.” I back away from the entrance where moans rise from the bowels of the labyrinth like a demon’s song.\n\n“The choice is yours, of course.” His tone is low and gentle, but in the lamplight his stare is wolf-like.\n\nI shift from foot to foot, look away, only to glance back. Does he hear my heart knocking against my breast? Can he smell my fear as it beads wet on my neck? Do I want to rise to this challenge? Or am I a fool for allowing him to bait me?\n\nMy fingers tighten around the lamp’s clay handle. “I will humor you, my lord, but only because Father taught me courage and graciousness.”\n\n“Mihály taught you well.” He holds out his hand. “My lady.”\n\nThe lamp divides the darkness like a saber, each foot forward lighting our descent into hell. Ghostly groans from below seep through the rock. I sink into Vlad’s fur-lined coat as though their suffering will soak into my soul.\n\nVlad pauses before descending the narrow rock steps leading into the labyrinth’s deepest level. “Are you certain?” His eyes glint with challenge. “A weak constitution is nothing to be ashamed of.”\n\nI lift my chin and glare with pretended insult. “I am the daughter of Michael Szilágyi and Margit Báthory. Iron courage flows in my blood.” I push back my cuff and show him the blue-forked veins in my wrist. “I am as brave as Hadak Ura, our ancient pagan warlord.”\n\n“I believe you, my lady. I will not doubt again.”\n\nThe clanking chains and eerie moans get louder with each step down, the noises merging into a demonic choir like that of Ördög’s requiem to the Underworld. My legs shake, my neck wet with icy prickles, and my skin tightens around my chest.\n\nI lift the lamp into hell.\n\nThe circle of light shines upon a pockmarked man stretching his arm between the bars, his fingers curled like claws. “Bless me, good sister.”\n\nIn the cell next to him, a naked wretch spits onto the ground. “Menj a fenébe!”\n\n“I am innocent!” A third prisoner grabs the bars and presses his wild-bearded face against the iron. “Tell His Highness there is a Turkish spy in his court. He is in danger! You must warn him!”\n\nMy head swivels toward Prince Vlad.\n\n“There are always spies,” Vlad whispers.\n\nI walk with measured pace and let the lantern reveal each doomed prisoner. Most stare, empty-eyed; the whips, chains, skin shredders, bone crushers, and strappado take away all hope and spirit. Others shout obscenities. One man kneels, hands in prayer, and mutters the Hail Mary.\n\nThe weight of their misery crashes down, squeezes my heart, and crushes my breath. This place must be worse than hell’s torments because these wretches yet live, have all their faculties! No one deserves this! It is inhumane! Sadistic and depraved!\n\nMy breath comes in shreds and clumps. I cover my nose with Prince Vlad’s cape, the stench of rotting flesh enfolding me in its putrid embrace. My pace quickens. It is time to end this test of my courage.\n\n“You!” A milky-eyed wretch points to Prince Vlad and begins chanting in a foreign tongue.\n\nPrince Vlad guides me away from the cells. “You have thrice over proven your courage tonight.”\n\n“What language was that man speaking?”\n\n“He recites from the Corpus Hermeticum.” Dracula takes the lantern and illuminates the stairwell. “It’s a pagan book of alchemy, astronomy, and metaphysics.”\n\n“It sounded like he cursed us.”\n\n“Pay no attention to a madman’s rants. That particular book is nothing but Egyptian and Greek nonsense.”\n\nI tread upwards, evil’s chill clinging to my limbs. At the top, I try to purge the dungeon’s misery, malice, and madness with a long exhalation. Yet the horror sticks like nettles in my soul.\n\n“This way.” I move past the dark tunnel and enter the lighted one, relieved to put space and distance between the prisoners and me.\n\nThe tunnel ends at a large grotto where Prince Vlad pauses to light the ring of torches affixed to the walls. I wait on a stone bench near the baptismal fount, sighing with relief as the golden glow of the church-like arches infuse peace into my troubled soul.\n\nPrince Vlad sits beside me. “We go from hell to heaven.”\n\nI tuck a stray lock behind my ear. “This was Father’s favorite grotto. God’s Buried Cathedral, he called it. His second favorite has a Titan-sized head emerging from the ground—like a god got stuck in molten rock. I was only in that grotto once. It reminded me of an insect trapped in tree sap that ages to amber—the insect forever entombed—never aging, almost alive in its resin grave.”\n\n“Do you find that horrific or beautiful?” His eyes search mine.\n\n“Both, I suppose.” My shoulders move into my sigh. “Caves are dreary places.”\n\n“I rather enjoy them. Tunnels have saved my life several times.” Dracula stands. “I think we are both ready for fresh air.” He offers his hand, its warmth a familiar comfort.\n\nTogether we walk through the tunnel lit by small lanterns that flicker like fireflies all the way to the exit.\n\nPrince Vlad gives the stubborn iron-crossed door a hard yank and it groans open. Outside, a sapphire dawn drapes over Buda.\n\n“On no.” My hands fly to my face. “It’s so late it’s early.” Were we in the tunnels that long? If my aunts discover I never returned to my room…I spin about, my voice edged with panic. “I have to go back. Now.”\n\nVlad’s brows crease with concern. He tugs a handkerchief from his robe and touches it to my lips as though dabbing at a smudge. “There’s something I must do first.” He lays the linen over my lips and sets his mouth on mine.\n\nEven through the thin fabric, his lips sear my own. I part my lips, feel the linen moisten with the breath of our lust. I collapse into him, my body sizzling with desire. I am about to rip away the fabric and taste his lips when he breaks the kiss.\n\nVlad Dracula steps back, the handkerchief between thumb and forefinger. “If you marry Luigi della Scala, you will still be chaste.” He drags the handkerchief across his mouth. “I will always have this.”\n\nChaste? Prince Vlad just violated my heart and corrupted my flesh!\n\nBack in my chambers, I touch my lips that still burn with the memory of our kiss—my first kiss—and groan. Vlad Dracula used my virtue, conceit, and fears to study the labyrinth’s secrets. He took advantage of my desire for romantic adventure to learn the escape route.\n\nAUTHOR: Autumn Bardot\n\nTITLE: The Impaler’s Wife\n\nGENRE: Historical Fiction, Gothic Romance\n\nRELEASE DATE: March 27, 2019\n\nPUBLISHER: Flores Publishing\n\nISBN/ASIN: B07NKJX7R8\n\nOUR RATING: ♥♥♥♥\n\nREVIEWED BY: Marie Lavender\n\nGet your copy of this new release today!\n\nUp next time: Unglorious War by Maxine Flam\n\nThanks for reading our latest book review on ILRB!"
