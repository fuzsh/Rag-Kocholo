Though very little is shown about their life, it is clear through flashbacks that their marriage was a remarkably happy one. In the animated web comanpion Dracula Rising, she is mentioned to have come from a peasant's background. When once asked if she was frightened by her husband's bloody tendencies, she replied that she knew he had it in him to be a good man and change the world for the better. A painter once complimented her as an \"otherworldly beauty\" with porcelain skin, blue eyes and raven hair.\n\nThe couple's happiness was cut short when Vlad gradually became disillusioned with the Order of the Dragon and turned against them. In retaliation for his defiance and treason, Ilona was abducted and Vlad was arrested and tortured before being turned into a vampire. Just mere moments before her death Ilona told him that they were bound body and soul and that they would meet again. Vlad desperately wanted to believe her but he did not share her faith and was forced to watch as his beloved princess was burned at the stake, while he was condemned to suffer as a vampire. While confined and starved in his coffin for almost four centuries, Vlad grieved Ilona’s death further fuelling his thirst for vengeance.\n\nWhen Vlad introduces himself into Victorian London society as an American entrepreneur named Alexander Grayson, he meets Mina Murray; who is revealed to be the reincarnation of Ilona.\n\nThroughout the series; Ilona appears in several flashbacks, hallucinations and dream sequences.\n\nTrivia[]"
