        "text": "In Eastern Europe vampires and other mythological creatures have a long history and are also part of the folklore of these countries. The most well-known characters are probably Prince Vlad Tepes and Countess Erzsébet Báthory. Are these stories true or are they just fairy tales that travelers in Western-European countries told to amuse their audience? In my post today, I tell you about Vlad Tepes, and next week, I present you the story of Countess Erzsébet Báthory.\n\nVlad Tepes, who was born in Wallachia (nowadays Romania), was only 11 years old when his father sent him together with his younger brother Radu to the Sultan as hostages. This pact assured the political situation of Wallachia in Eastern Europe. In the Ottoman court the two princes learned all the qualifications that were so important that time, such as riding, strategy and culture. When he was 17 years old, Vlad tried to return to the throne with the help of the Ottoman army after the death of his father and older brother, but he lost the war against Vladislav 2nd, king of Hungary. In 1456 Vlad was eventually crowned as king of Wallachia and he could also protect his land for six years. During his reign, cruelty became daily process in the country: even the smallest felonies were punished to death. Based on a legend, in the city center of Târgoviște (capital of Wallachia), there was a golden cup that people were afraid to even touch, because the theft was punished with cruelty.\n\nAnother felony was begging. The prince hated the beggars and the poor people, so one day he invited everyone to his castle for a dinner. During the celebration he asked if they still wanted to live in poverty. The guests answered of course, “no.” The prince after the answer commanded his soldiers to close all the doors and burn the dining room. Nobody survived the fire.\n\nBased on another legend, when Sultan Mehmed 2nd attacked the capital of Wallachia, he was greeted with the impaled dead body of twenty thousand Ottoman soldiers (“Vlad’s Wood”), so the sultan left the country immediately. The sultan really attacked the Wallachia because Vlad 3rd in 1459 decided not to pay taxes to the Ottoman Empire and to make peace with the Hungarian king Matthias I. Moreover, the Romanian prince attacked several cities in the territory of the Sultanate and killed 38,000 Ottomans, also women and children. Later, Mehmed 2nd promised Wallachia to Vlad’s younger brother, Radu, who then attacked the country again and this time the Ottomans succeed to conquer the Wallachia (based on some sources, Dracula’s wife, Justina or Ilona Szilágyi, who was nevertheless the niece of King Matthias, suicided during the battle). Vlad Tepes went to Visegrád to ask for help from this ally, Matthias, but the Hungarian king closed him in the prison of his castle.\n\nAfter Dracula’s death his son Mihnea 1st followed him on the throne but could enjoy power for one year only. He had good relationship with his father and was murdered for his cruelty and politics. As we know very few about the death of Vlad Tepes, even its date is unsure, there are legends of his tomb. According to some researchers, his crypt is located in the Monastery of Snagov Island, according to others in the Comana monastery that was founded by the prince himself.\n\nNevertheless, there were people who admired the actions of Vlad 3rd, such as Russia’s Tsar Ivan 4th the Terrible who read the book written in Saxon on Vlad’s life (That describes positively the kingdom of Dracula).\n\nThe name “Dracula” comes from the name of the Order of Dragons, a Hungarian knight order founded by Sigismund, king of Hungary (1387-1437). From the above story in 1897, the English Bram Stoker wrote his famous novel, but in Romania Vlad Tepes is a national icon and national hero who protected his land against the Ottomans. His castle is located in Romania and there is the possibility to visit it."
