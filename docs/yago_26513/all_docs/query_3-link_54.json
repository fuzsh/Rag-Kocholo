        "text": "The SzilÃ¡gyi foundry is a family business founded in 1970 by engineer ErnÅ and Ilona SzilÃ¡gyi.\n\nA craft that was originally based on the manual chill casting of aluminium, zinc and brass grew over the years and soon incorporated high-pressure casting using smaller machines and developed into a foundry equipped with modern technology that offers a wide range of foundry services.\n\nThe new generation, represented by the son DÃ©nes SzilÃ¡gyi, BSc in metallurgical engineering, implemented a rationalisation of the production cycle, machine automation and robotisation, as well as acquiring the ISO 9001 quality certification. The company is successful on foreign markets, which represent 40 % of the production. Our main advantages are our knowledge based on years of tradition and our adaptability to our customer's special wishes and needs. We can quickly respond to increases in the number of orders and changes to the casting tools.\n\nWe are also available as consultants for planning new solutions."
