        "text": "An interesting story was sent in to us recently. What this man has experienced has changed his life entirely. He has been awakened into a new existence from his previous life. His story must be shared to others as it truly is quite incredible.\n\nHis name is Bar Dracul and believes he is Vlad the Impaler. Perhaps you recognize him by his other name Vlad Dracula. He reigned as the Prince of Wallachia between 1431–1477 in Romania and is considered a folk hero to many. As a member of the Order of the Dragon, they were pledged to protect Christianity in Eastern Europe. Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia was also a member of the House of Drăculești.\n\nThere have been numerous movies made about Dracula, perhaps one of the standout films is the Francis Ford Coppola picture: Bram Stoker’ Dracula released back in 1992 (based loosely upon events from this era in the world). Bar states he had a psychic awakening one day and afterward became perceptive to things others simply cannot understand. He wants to awaken others and is using his voice to reach out to them."
