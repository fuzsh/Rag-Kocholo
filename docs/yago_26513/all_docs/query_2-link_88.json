A similar frequency of L lineage has previously been reported from Pakistan [21]. An M27 mutation that defined the subclad L1 was found in all the L-M11 samples in the present study. This is in accordance with the previous studies that M27 characterizes the Indian and Pakistani lineages, which is absent in their Turkish counterparts [22]. This result, together with the differences in STR nodal haplotypes of the L clad between the Caucasus and Indian populations [4], and matches in the six STR loci typed between Turkish and Armenians [22], lead to the assumption that the Indian and Pakistani L lineages might have originated from a distinct founder population. This view is supported by the much lower STR variance of the L haplogroups compared with the other Indian Y-lineages, observed in the present study.\n\nThe name Ilfov was first attested in a donation writ, dated 1482, of Wallachian Prince Vlad Calugarul to Snagov monastery.\n\nIIfov Basarab or Prince Vlad Calugarul was Y Chromsome R1a1a and mtDNA L-M20 which is Vlad Dracula Bloodline in Romania.\n\nStephen and Sigmund Bathory clans was N1c and\n\nL-M20\n\nit was necessary to collapse haplogroups N3 and L (defined by the presence of derived states at loci Tat and M20 respectively)\n\nSaint Stephen of Hungary, likely N1c1* (2/4 10th century Magyars were N1c*, and 2/3 tested \"royal\" Magyars were N1c*).

Csányi, E. Bogácsi-Szabó, Gy. Tömöry, Á. Czibula, K. Priskin, A. CsŐsz, B. Mende, P. Langó, K. Csete, A. Zsolnai, E. K. Conant, C. S. Downes, and I. Raskó. \"Y-Chromosome Analysis of Ancient Hungarian and Two Modern Hungarian-Speaking Populations from the Carpathian Basin.\" Annals of Human Genetics 72:4 (July 2008): pages 519-534. 100 Hungarian people from Hungary and 97 Hungarian-speaking Szekler people from Transylvania in present-day Romania were genetically tested. DNA was also successfully sampled from the skeletons of 4 Hungarians who lived in the 10th century. Two of the skeletons that were anthropologically Caucasoid-Mongoloid hybrids carried the Y-DNA haplogroup N3 (later ramed N1c) while one of them carried the Caucasoid mtDNA haplogroup H. This, along with the evidence from modern-day Hungarians, shows that the Magyar invaders had intermarried with local European tribes, greatly watering down Mongoloid genetic and physical traits among those who continued to speak the Hungarian language. Summary:\n\nThe Avar khaganane was centered in and around the present-day Hungarian city of Debrecen and their presence in the Carpathian Basin lasted several centuries until 800 AD. The presence of the Huns, even when compared with that of Avars, was insignificant in terms of the time spent there. The territory was called Pannonia since the Roman times and long after the fall of the empire. The name Hungary is much younger and comes from the word On Ogur the Bulgarians gave to the 10 (?) Asian tribes that invaded the Carpathian Basin in 896 AD. As for the Mongol invasion of 1242, it lasted only 1 or 2 years, which is too short, in my opinion, to leave any genetic trace in the population, though I agree that the country, especially the plains probably inhabited by the Magyars, was almost depopulated. The highlands Romania, Slovakia, offered better refuge to the locals Vlachs, Slavs, so their population was largely preserved. The Avars were steppe people from Central Asia, so they must have been predominantly R1a, with maybe some J2, R1b and/or C3.\n\nThe next invaders were the Magyar, a Finno-Ugric people who arrived in Europe in the 9th century, and settled in Hungary in the 10th. Hungarian language is actually a descendant of Magyar, not Hunnic, despite the misleading name in Hun-. The Magyar came from Central Asia, and are related to the modern Bashkirs of Russia.\n\nAccording to paper by Russian geneticists  Structure of gene pool of Bashkir subpopulations Bashkirs have (N=471) 47% R1b (35% R1b1b2, 13% R1b1b1), 26% R1a1, 17% N1c, C haplogroup occurs in only 2.3% of Bashkir sample. The Bashkirs were conquered by the Mongols, which may account for all the haplogroup C. In fact, the presence of C in Europe is usually attributed exclusively to the Mongols, and C is almost non-existent in Hungary anyway. There are significant differences in haplogroup frequencies between subpopulations of Bashkirs. This indicate that each could have a different origin. I managed to find the original study by Lobov et al. (in Russian only). Indeed the percentages vary widely according to the subpopulation. the Bashkirs total is 17% of N1c, 26% of R1a, 13% of R1b1b1, 35% of R1b1b2. R1b1b2 (M269) is much more common the Baymaksky district of Bashkortostan (81%) and the Perm region (84%), but otherwise osciliates between 7% and 23%. R1b1b1 (M73) reaches an amazing 55% in the Abzelilovsky district, but otherwise does not exceed 2%. N1c is very high in East Orenburg (65%) and Sterlibashevsky (54%), moderate in Samara & Saratov (20%) and low elsewhere (3% to 7%). Samara & Saratov is the only Bashkir region with a reasonable amount of haplogroup C (17%) and O (6%). But overall it is R1a that is the most common, reaching 38% in Sterlibashevsky district, 40% in West Orenburg, and 48% in Saratov & Samara.\n\nA study compared the Y-chromosome of the Madjar tribe from Kazakhstan to the Magyars of Hungary, and found that some G lineages were related. The article doesnt specify the subcalde, but G1 is the dominant strain in Kazakhstan, and is also found in Hungary (but normally not elsewhere in Europe).\n\nAnother study compared the Y-DNA of Hungarians with other Finno-Ugric-speaking populations in order to understand why modern Hungarians have so little of the typical Uralic haplogroup N1c. They tested a few individuals from a 10th-century cemetery found out that half of the individuals belonged to N1c. The sample was small, and maybe pure Magyar, but it nonetheless suggests that the original Magyar had much more N1c than modern Hungarians.\n\nThe Magyar population is thought to have suffered considerably from the 13th-century Mongol invasion of Europe, and from the 16th-century war against the Ottomans. From all this can be deduced that the original Magyars were an admixture of N1c and R1a (predominant), with some G1, and maybe some R1b. As haplogroup Q is neither associated with the Magyars not with the Mongols, it must be either be of Hunnic origin, or from other Asian tribes part of the various invaders from the steppes.\n\nN1c (M46/Tat,P105) N1c* is very rare, found mainly in Asia (dominant among N1c in the Altai[2]).\n\nbrings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree.

Illyrians and Celts who settled here are credited with building the castle around 1200 with construction material available locally, although it first appears in written records dated to 1242. Burgenlands oldest fortress, Burg Lockenhaus was built to defend the area against the Mongols. The Romans annexed the area and included it as a part of the Pannonia province under the Roman Empire.German and Slavic people inhabited the castle. Notable owners included: Duke Frederick the Warlike, Henry II of Güssing, the Bohemian king, Ottakar IIand King Maximilian II. The castle was destroyed in 1337 under Charles I of Hungary.The town was given a market status in 1492. Finally the castle went to the Nadasdy family. Francis II Nadasdy married Elizabeth Báthory, a descendant of Stephan Báthory, who went down in history as the Blood Countess , because of her reign of terror, torturing, and murdering hundreds of people, mainly women, for sadistic pleasure.\n\nEberhard II, called \"der Greiner\" (the Jarrer) (after 1315  15 March 1392, Stuttgart), Count of Württemberg from 1344 until 1392.\n\nB Rh negative.

They had two children: Ulrich, father of his successor Eberhard III; and Sophie, who later married John I, Duke of Lorraine.\n\nFrom the beginning of his regency in 1344 up to 1361 he reigned together with his brother Ulrich IV, whom he forced to sign a treaty which confirmed the inseparability of Württemberg. Soon afterwards Ulrich IV renounced his co-rule on May 1, 1362. To strengthen his might and to enlarge the territory of Württemberg Eberhard II joined several pacts and clashes with Emperor\n\nErzherzogin von Österreich\n\nNOBLES, Dukes-Duchesses/Archdukes-Archduchesses\n\n-\n\nNonne im Königliche Stift in Hall in Tirol\n\nSTATE and COURT PERSONNEL, Courtiers\n\n1607 - 1612\n\nÖbristin im Königliche Stift in Hall in Tirol\n\nSTATE and COURT PERSONNEL, Courtiers\n\n1612 - 1621\n\nGiven Maria Christierna\n\nFamily Habsburg\n\nMarried Báthory\n\nFather Habsburg, Karl II Ferdinands von (Erherzog von Innerösterreich)\n\nb.1540 June 3 d.1590 October 7\n\nMother Wittelsbach-von Habsburg, Maria Anna von\n\nb.1551 March 21 d.1608 May\n\nSpouses Báthory, Zygmunt\n\nm.(1595 - 1607) b.1562 d.1613 August 27\n\nThe Archduchess of Austria Maria Christierna von Habsburg married Zsigmund Báthory.

A later paper by Di Giacomo et al examines a much larger sample from Italy, but very regrettably fails to test for the L group.\n\n Capelli et al. - Y chromosome variation in the Italian peninsula is clinal and supports an admixture model for the Mesolithic-Neolithic encounter - (Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 2007) has data on Italy (mostly central). As usual, they do not test for L but for K. However, a quick comparison with STR from other L observations suggests that 10 observations (out of 700, ie slightly more than 1%) are L. (Including, curiously 3 from Alta Val Badia, showing that L did move around a little bit.)\n\nArchduchess Maria Christina of Austria (15741621)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nPortrait of Maria Christina, Princess of Transylvania, ca. 1592.\n\nMaria Christierna of Austria (10 November 1574  6 April 1621), was a German princess member of the House of Habsburg and by marriage Princess of Transylvania.\n\nShe was the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Austria, the son of Emperor Ferdinand I, and Maria Anna of Bavaria. Her elder brother Archduke Ferdinand, succeeded as Holy Roman Emperor in 1619.\n\nLife\n\nOn 7 February 1595 was received in Graz the formal petition of marriage between Maria Christina and Sigismund Báthory, ruling Prince of Transylvania, by the noblemen Stephen Bocskay. The marriage contract was negotiated almost a month, and finally the bride on 15 June accompanied by her mother, the Prince-Bishop George of Lavant and 6000 German horsemen. In Kaschau Maria Christina fell ill with fever, which delayed the re-ride.[1] The formal marriage took place in Weissenburg on 6 August 1595, and soon after Maria Christina moved to Transylvania.\n\nThe marriage was regarded as a major political gain, as Sigismund, formerly a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, now formed close ties with the Holy Roman Empire. Emperor Rudolf II appointed Sigismund Prince of the Holy Roman Empire (Reichsfürst),[2] and also secured the possession of Transylvania, if the couple remain without offspring. The agreement was signed on 16 January 1595 by the Hungarian parliament in Bratislava.[3]\n\nHowever, this union proved to be completely unhappy: Sigismund, after a disastrous wedding night, refused to consummate the marriage and sent his wife to a fortress in Kővár vára, where Maria Christina was kept as prisoner until 18 April 1598, when, at the request of the local nobility, she was chosen to occupy the Transylvanian throne after her husband abdicated. However, her rule was only nominal because Emperor Rudolf II sent representatives to rule. On 20 August 1598, Sigismund Báthory regained the throne and reconcilied with his wife, but sent her again to Kővár.\n\nWhen Sigismund abdicated for a second time in March 1599, Maria Christina finally left him and return to Austria in April. On 17 August 1599 Pope Clement VIII dissolved her marriage, and in 1607 she joined to her younger sister Eleanor in the Haller Convent (Haller Damenstift) in Hall in Tirol, where she died in 1621, aged forty-six.\n\nMaria Christina (b. Graz, 10 November 1574  d. Hall in Tirol, 6 April 1621), married on 6 August 1595 to Sigismund Bathory, Prince of Transylvania; they divorced in 1599.\n\nSigismund Báthory\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n(Redirected from Sigismund Bathory)\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe native form of this personal name is Báthory Zsigmond.

He was elected prince in his father's lifetime, but being quite young at his father's death, the government was entrusted to a regency.\n\nIn 1588 he attained his majority, and joined the league of Christian princes against the Turk. The obvious danger of such a course caused no small anxiety in the principality, and the diet of Torda (today: Turda, Romania) even went so far as to demand a fresh coronation oath from Sigismund. Upon his refusal to render it, the members threatened him with deposition. Ultimately Báthory got the better of his opponents, and executed all whom he got into his hands (1595).\n\nIn 1595, at Gyulafehérvár (today Alba Iulia), Sigismund Báthory signed a treaty with Michael the Brave, the Voivod of Wallachia, in which Wallachia came under sovereignty of Transylvania, requiring to Sigismund to send aid to Michael the Brave for fighting the Ottomans.\n\nOn August 13, 1595 at the Battle of Călugăreni near the Neajlov river, Michael defeated a Turkish army led by Sinan Pasha. Despite the victory Michael, having too few troops to continue the war, retreated toward Transylvania. Joining Sigismund Báthory's 40,000-strong army led by István Bocskay, they liberated Târgovişte (October 8, 1595), Bucharest (October 12, 1595) and Brăila. Wallachia was liberated on October 29, 1595.\n\nThe turning-point of his career was his separation from his wife, Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria (1574-1621) (daughter of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria), in 1599, an event followed by his own abdication the same year, in order that he might take orders. It was on this occasion that he offered the throne of Transylvania to Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary, in exchange for the duchy of Opole in Silesia. As Duke of Opole he also was a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn April 1598 Sigismund resigned as Prince of Transylvania in favor of Emperor Rudolf, reversed his decision in October 1598, and then resigned again in favor of Cardinal Andrew Báthory, his cousin. This allowed Transylvania to fall under the influence of the King of Poland. Michael the Brave reestablished an alliance with Emperor Rudolf, began a campaign against Andrew on October 5, 1599, and became Prince of Transylvania in November 1599, while the Habsburg general Giorgio Basta entered Transylvania from the west at the same time.\n\nIn 1600, however, Sigismund at the head of an army of Poles and Cossacks, he attempted to recover his throne, but was routed by Michael the Brave, voivode of Moldavia and Wallachia, at Suceava. In February 1601 the diet of Kolozsvár (today: Cluj-Napoca, Romania) reinstated him, but again he was driven out, after Battle of Goroszló, by Michael the Brave and general Giorgio Basta, never to return. He died at Prague in 1613.\n\nHis reign described by the contemporary Baranyai Decsi Janos in his chronicle link\n\nSee also\n\nBartholomew (Greek: Βαρθολομαίος, transliterated \"Vartholomeos\") comes from the Aramaic bar-Tôlmay (תולמי‎‎‎‎‎-בר‎‎ , meaning son of Tolmay (Ptolemy) or son of the furrows (perhaps a ploughman).\"\n\nBathory or Bar- Tolmay was a Jewish-Gypsy Hungarian Noble Clan and B Rh negative.\n\nVlad Dracula Dracula's Grandmother was a Bathory\n\nMarie TOMEI de BALATIA; (concubine) Palatine Hungarian from Ecsed Bathory family\n\nFather: Mircea 'The Old' b: 1380\n\nMother: Mariya TOLMAY\n\nIlona Szilugy-Bathory - Vlad Drakulas second wife, a widow, a member of the infamous House of Bathory and relative of the rulers of Moldova (and his mother).
