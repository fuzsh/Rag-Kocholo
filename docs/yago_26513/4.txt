WOMEN’S HISTORY † SZILÁGYI ILONA (fl. 15th century)

Szilágyi Ilona (also called "Jusztina") was one of the three children of Szilágyi Osvát and Pósa de Szer Ágota. She had a brother, Ferenc and a sister, Margit. Her father was the maternal uncle of Hunyadi Mátyás, also known as Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary. In 1462, Mátyás imprisoned his former ally, Vlad Țepeș III, domn al Țării Românești. His reasons for doing so are unclear. His stated reason was that Vlad was a traitor who was secretly in league with the Ottoman Turks, but it seems unlikely that this charge was true. Either way, in 1466, Vlad was released from prison and married Ilona. She and Vlad had two sons, Vlad IV and another who is traditionally called Mircea, though there is no record of him being named as such. During Vlad's time in prison in Hungary, his younger brother, Radu cel Frumos, had fighting with Basarab Laiotă cel Bătrân over Wallachia, but Radu died in 1475. The following year, Vlad and Ecsedi Báthori István set out to attempt to reconquer Wallachia and Vlad was dead by January of 1477. Vlad and Ilona's son, Vlad, advanced a claim to Wallachia, but never managed to make any use of it. Ilona's stepson, Mihnea cel Rău, became the prince of Wallachia in 1508, but he was overthrown after less than a year and then murdered in front of Sibiu Cathedral. Ilona's sons both stayed in Hungary and married Hungarian noblewomen.
