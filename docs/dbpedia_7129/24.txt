Flat Bridge believed built by The Spanish during their occupation of Jamaica 1492 … known as the “Spanish Occupation”. Jamaica was captured by the British in 1655. Flat Bridge was built during this era. Vehicular traffic uses this vital link from Spanish Town to Ochos Rios. Flat Bridge is built over The Rio Cobre River (river of snake) when literally translated from Spanish to English. The soon to be completed North Coast Highway will bypass flat bridge and hopefully save lives. This new toll road (highway) is being completed by the Chinese having been started by the French. You could call it the French/Chinese North Coast Highway.
