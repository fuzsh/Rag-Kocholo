        "text": "My two growing girls love mini adventures and when boredom sets in they often request a road trip. Last year my husband had business that would take him first to the parish of St Catherine then onto to the parish of St Anns in the same day so he asked if we would like to tag along. There was not a chance in hell that we would say no to a possible road trip! So we packed our wares early the next morning and headed out, filled with excitement for the up coming adventure. We love exploring new places together, the longer the drive with a few country lanes thrown in, is even better. I, personally had not travelled these roads since just after we married some 13 plus years ago, so I was just as excited as my two bouncing children.\n\nWe travelled from our home in the parish of Manchester to Spanish Town, the capital of the parish of St. Catherine. Our journey meant our first experience of traveling along the newest section of highway 2000.\n\nOnce all business transactions and refreshing was completed in Spanish Town we continued our onward journey towards St. Ann. This part of our journey meant experiencing travel across what many deemed, the dreaded yet infamous Flat Bridge, which allowed you passage via an area known as the Bog Walk Gorge.\n\nFlat Bridge, is one of the oldest bridges in Jamaica. It was built by slaves in the 1700’s and was initially known as the River Road Bridge. It was surrounded by 16 neighboring plantations back then and served as the main route of passage for many. The bridge spans the Rio Cobre in St. Catherine and connects the roadway from the northern end of the Bog Walk Gorge to the southern end. The bridge connects Kingston, Jamaica’s capital city with the north coast areas such as Dunns River and Ocho Rios in St. Anns.\n\nUnfortunately, Flat Bridge’s history has been known to result in many unfortunate accidents, dating back to the dark days of slavery. Where slaves were tasked with building the bridge and instances occurred where many met their watery demise. Today, many an unsuspecting party, not familiar with the bridges design of a sharp turn and no protective barriers, often find themselves immersed in the rapids of the Rio Cobre which runs beneath it. As we slowly proceeded across the bridge, I felt a tiny tinge of anxiety which added to the mystery of this monument and all the myths and fallacies that surround it. Once we crossed, my husband relayed some of the stories he was told as a child growing up regarding Flat Bridge’s history. This grabbed my children’s attention as they peered into the murky green of the rivers running waters and out popped all varying levels of questions. I just love my girls curiosity!\n\nOnce we crossed over the bridge, my husband directed us to look upwards and indicated the area of the railway line that bore into cliffs above. This is known as the 3/4 Mile railway tunnel, it is the longest tunnel on the Jamaican rail tracks. We were truly being spoiled with all of these bits of history to feast our eyes on, until that day I was unaware of any such tunnels existence.\n\nNow, I have always thought of Jamaica as a country with an abundance of beauty in nature but I have to state that the drive on this occasion was unbounded by beauty. Each road way was lushly decorated by mountains and mountains of green vegetation. The natural rock formations as we ascended upwards into the hills was truly breath-taking. Yet again I was mesmerized in a bout of silence as I clicked away trying to capture every aspect that my eyes could behold as we drove along.\n\nIt was decided that we would detour through the back roads via the district of Moneague and head towards the district of Claremont. Moneague was considered one the largest towns in St. Anns in the days of old, due it location and abundance of elegant hotels used by gentry traveling via the area. The name Moneague derived due to a folklore legend of an underground lake ‘ Manugua’ that would appear every 100 years, but in truth the ‘Lake’ appears after heavy rainfall with the rain waters having no outlet. Moneague is also the home of The Lake House, built in the 18th century, which sits nestled atop a hill and over looks the lake waters when they rise. Claremont was named after the very first House “Clermont House” that was built in the district. Both towns are seeped in history which is evident by the architecture of the buildings which line their high streets. The views yet again as we drove through the surrounds were awe-inspiring.\n\nThe pictures painted by the hills and landscape were just beautiful.\n\nWe stopped at a nearby fruit stall along the road side and feasted on a bunch of ‘stainy’ bananas, as we tucked in I could not help but let out an ‘mmmmmmm’. They were true nectar, one of the sweetest variety of banana I know of here in Jamaica. I sat and imagined my banana fritters or banana bread would go down a treat with those babies tucked inside. Sorry, we ate them all before I got a chance to take a picture. As we drove further into the hills, there were tiny villages dotted along the hillsides, some nicely seated at the base of the hills and many atop with the tiniest narrow winding roads.\n\nWe soon turned onto the nine mile intersection the birthplace of the Legend that was Robert Nesta Marley, to many known as the late, great, Bob Marley. I had visited before but unfortunately we did not have the time to stop for a visit on this occasion but it has given me ideas for a future road trip blog post in the near future. Many tourist buses, had sat lining the roadsides as we approached and my girls hastily advised that it was definitely time for a toilet break.\n\nAs our journey continued we spotted the Cedella Marley Basic School neatly seated on the hills not far from Bob Marley’s Mausoleum. The school was built in 1999 by the Marley Foundation and their partners for the children in the local community.\n\nWhilst our journey did not end beyond here, we did not have much further to go as we coursed through the narrow winding roads, where we would finally complete the reason for our travel and after which we would journey homewards back to the cool hills of Manchester armed and stuffed with hot roasted yellow yam and salt fish, my absolute favorite dish!\n\nI love St. Anns, it has so many nooks and crannies to explore, some may seem more picturesque than others but they all have an air of history, mystery and beauty about them. I am certain that my travels and exploration of the Garden Parish has not come to an end and that I am yet to experience them beauty, mystery and all.\n\nTo me living here in Jamaica, offers the perfect opportunity to explore what Mother Nature has tasked Fauna and Flora. I do not intend on taking it for granted by forgetting to appreciate what the island has beyond the walls of the resorts, nicely situated on sun-kissed beaches with yards and yards of white sand. The country has so much more beyond that, in its history, rich culture and vast landscapes devoured by nature. Jamaica should not just be remembered as the home of some exquisite five-star vacation spots but the beautiful land of ‘ Wood and Water ‘ as it was so rightly named by its first inhabitants the Arawak Indians.\n\nThat day’s journey to me highlights the line written by Mary F. Bradford in her book ‘Side Trips in Jamaica’ which acted as a travel guide for many a traveller to the island including myself when she wrote\n\n“The scenery of the Island surpasses description. No one ever visits Jamaica without an ardent desire to return, and the memories of the trip are as enchanting as a fairyland. Everywhere surprises await, the lavishness of Nature’s bounty being nowhere more evidenced than in this exquisitely delightful island.”\n\nI am one of those enchanted by this island, since my first visit at the age of six. I could not envision my life without snippets of Jamaica in it, my life on the other hand is truly richer as a result. So I would definitely encourage those of you looking for a real trek through nature to come and get lost in the enchantment of the beautiful fairytale island of Jamaica.\n\nI on the other hand, now do that daily and thank God for His blessings everyday.\n\nRead more: http://www.jamaica-history.weebly.com/bog-walk-gorge.html\n\n***\n\nUcalison\n\n©2016 ANL"
