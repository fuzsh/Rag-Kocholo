        "text": "The day’s activities included the repair and modernization of current chicken coops at the facility; planting of a vegetable garden; and the handover of care packages to the institution that included water hoses, feeding pans and toiletries.\n\n“Last year, I made a call for all facilities to be self-sufficient where additional inmates and wards will be engaged in vegetable and root crop production, poultry and chicken rearing. I am pleased to see the interest our private sector companies and academia are showing to assist us in achieving this target,” said minister Spencer.\n\nHi-Pro provided several items that included 200 baby chicks, chicken feed, medicine and vegetable seedlings such as callaloo and pak choi.\n\n“We are excited to be on board this Labour Day Project and look forward to many more opportunities to partner with the ‘We Transform’ Programme. The installations made to the existing broiler coop, and the planting of seedlings, on the vegetable plot, will also provide an added source of nourishment for the boys as well as a sustainable food source for the correctional facilities,” said business development manager at Hi-Pro Dayne Patterson.\n\nHi-Pro has also committed to provide continuous technical support in chicken rearing techniques and the facilitation of vet visits to the institution to encourage sustainability.\n\nAlso, 16 students specialising in criminal justice, social work and child youth development from Canada’s Humber College participated in the Labour Day Project and presented care packages containing toiletries and note books to the boys at the juvenile facility. The students are a part of the Study Abroad Exchange Programme coordinated by SALISES, UWI.\n\n“We believe that today’s project provided the students with first-hand experience of the strategies the Department of Correctional Services use to engage young offenders. These programmes are aimed at enhancing self-sufficiency and other essential life skills that will enable them to successfully reintegrate into their communities,” said professor at Humber College, Sheria Myrie."
