        "text": "Daily Gleaner, May 9, 1891\n\nHere And There in Jamaica,\n\nBY A FREE LANCE.\n\nIN THE BOG WALK.\n\nDeep in the very heart of this island rock of ours lies a secluded valley hemmed in on every side by towering hills. Favoured by copious showers from the clouds that drift continuously from the east and watered by many streams that rise amongst the untrodden heights around it is little wonder that St. Thomas ye Vale should be the delectable valley it is. The very names of the products cultivated within its borders and brought in to the stations for the metropolitan market suggest the rich and fertile nature of the soil—coffee, pimento, ginger, cocoa, bananas, oranges, corn, sugar-cane, tobacco, logwood, fustic, annatto—surely a goodly land!\n\nSt Thomas in the Vale, from Mount Diablo: Hakewill\n\nSt. Thomas in the Vale lies in the upper part of St. Catherine and is reached from the south through a great natural ravine in the amphitheatre of hills. The streams in the valley unite at the entrance to this gorge and flow through as the Rio Cobre River which traverses the plain of St Catherine and ultimately finds its way into the harbour. Up this ravine also runs the railroad from Spanish Town, while the main road from the same town winds along in the deep shade at the bottom. The surrounding hills are composed of white limestone, extremely indurated, which resists the \"weathering\" of the atmosphere and the action of running water to a much greater degree than any of the other secondary rocks. Granting then an initial cleft in the hills the channel which the Rio Cobre has carved out for itself at Bog Walk is plain evidence of the countless generations during which the dominant features of the landscape must have been the same as they are at present. A consideration of the physical structure of this district opens up many interesting geological questions which it would be both pleasant and profitable to stay and discuss, but our object is a different one to-day.\n\nMuch has been written from time to time about the Bog Walk, the great natural entrance to St. Thomas in the Vale from the south. The valley itself is a picturesque scene from Mount Diabolo which turns up on the northern boundary and it was here that Anthony Trollope remarked upon the selfishness of the devil in appropriating to himself some of the loveliest points of the scenery in the world. But it is upon the Bog Walk that admiration and fine writing has most been lavished. True, some travellers have likened it simply to a Derbyshire or Welsh River \"with tropical vegetation, overhanging cliffs and a capital road.\" But in general the most unstinted praise has been written about this spot. Like others who have read most of the two enthusiastic descriptions I long wished to explore the beauties of the walk for myself and now, having seen it in early morning, at high noon, and in the moonlight, what are my impressions—which, I take it, are the impressions of an ordinary average traveller? Let the sequel tell.\n\nAbout that time when, as expressed by Byron,--\n\n\"Night wanes, the vapours round the mountains curl'd,\n\nMelt into morn, and light awakens the world,\"\n\nwe pass through the sleeping city of St. Jago de la Vega and drive along the smooth highroad to the north. A cold breeze blows and the atmosphere is chilly, for the sun has not yet arisen above the hills and the night winds are still haunting the valleys, The low hills approach nearer as we journey on and at last, as a bend in the road is turned, a small valley opens up on the right. The hillocks around are clothed with many varieties of trees; and bamboos and palms nod in the hollow. Just beneath, a placid river emerges from the shadows, spreads out and rushes in silver over a wide, sloping dam, and then quietly loses itself again under the arching vegetation below. This is the fountain head of the irrigation canal which has proved of so much value to the cultivation in [the parish of St. Catherine.] The works\n\n[unfortunately, in the copy I have access to, the bottom of the column has been cut off]\n\nAs the sun appears above the hills a thousand lights begin to play on the rippling water, making the scene still more pretty.\n\nThis spot may be said to mark the entrance to the defile. A little further on and the rocks on either side begin to close in, the sunshine is lost, shadows lie across the path, and the air is cool, and damp The river flows placidly on the right, and is hidden by bamboos, creepers and luxuriant undergrowth. From these and from the rocks above come twittering of birds and the hum of insect life, with the low accompaniment of the wind among the foliage. A humming-bird flashes near, hovers beneath a flower for a second, the quiet vibration sounding pleasantly in the ears, and then is gone. A boy with books under his arm goes fast, his whole face a stare, his feet and legs innocent of covering, he wonders probably what the ferns and plants are being so carefully collected for; perhaps he believes we are \"white obeah\". The little caves in the side of the road are the homes of the fern. Delicate maiden-hairs grow out of the soil there that would make an English collector's heart glad if he saw them.\n\nWith such surroundings the road continues for about a mile, the river being on the right. Then one crosses to the other bank by a low flat bridge, and the rocks continue to tower up higher on both sides. The river now lies plain to your sight: it is broad, and deep and muddy from the rains, and it flows along silently in the deep shades. From its very edge rises the cliffs which shoot almost straight up to a great height, and yet are covered with a rich growth of tropical trees to the summit. Imposing as this part of the ravine is, it is surpassed in grandure by what follows. The cliffs ever heighten as we advance, and begin to hang over in ponderous masses of bare rocks mingled with vegetation of pure rich green. The river comes tumbling down a rocky channel, its course being impeded by huge boulders round which the waters rush and eddy and lash themselves into foam. About the rocks on the banks grow innumerable bamboos, wild canes, creepers and other tropical vegetation in the rankest luxuriance, while above, to the very summits that seem to touch the blue sky, the precipices are clothed with hardy trees which grow out of the interstices of the solid rock. Along the side of the road are caverns, cool and damp with walls delicately veiled in green, and here and there a bright wild violet as points of relief. There are the songs of the birds from above, but the principal voice in the gorge is the voice of the waters as they rush over their rocky bed. For ever winding and echoing in this long ravine it seems to one who stops and listens that there are spirits in the water crying to each other. One can understand how the Greeks long ago came to give each stream its god.\n\nrailway train about to enter tunnel\n\nFarther on there is less complexity of environment but perhaps the greatest surprise of all to the visitor is towards the termination of the glen where a magnificent precipice on the left rises to a dizzy height, sheer from the water of the river. From base to summit the rock is mantled by a covering of dwarf palm trees and scrub, these growing out of the very rock, and rising almost at the same angle. Through the heart of this rock the railway train thunders day after day, and as it emerges from the tunnel among the rocky hillocks farther down in the gorge it awakens the sleeping echoes by its prolonged whistle of warning. At the foot of the cliff on the road side is a dismantled workshop of some kind, a melancholy object, with machinery lying embedded in the earth and rusting at the sweet will of the elements. A few steps from this and the cliffs recede to right and left, the view opens, and we have finished our progress through this long pass, this wild entrance to a fair and fertile valley."
