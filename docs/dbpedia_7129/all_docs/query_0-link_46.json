        "text": "​Built by slaves in the eighteenth century, Flat Bridge is a source of dread for many who have to cross it. Many believe Flat Bridge is the gathering place for the ghosts (duppies) of the slaves who died during the construction of the bridge. Nearby residents believe it is these duppies who cause the accidents there and pull the vehicles into the river. They say when the water turns into the colour of a green lizard the duppies are going to pull somebody in.\n\nThe bridge is a beam bridge across the Rio Cobre on the A1 road connecting the Jamaican capital Kingston, with the north coast tourist areas of Dunn's River and Ocho Rios. It is one of the oldest bridges in Jamaica, constructed in the eigteenth century,\n\nThe sixteen plantations in the Bog Walk area were obliged to send one slave in every fifty to work on the River Road, sometimes called Sixteen Mile Walk. Gravel, marl, lime, sand and stone had to be dug. Slaves often lost their lives as they performed dangerous tasks in the Gorge.\n\nIt is believed that mermaids, or “River Mummas” as they are called in Jamaica, live in a bottomless hole just below the bridge. Many believe that the mermaids are the reason each attempt to establish railing on the bridge has proven futile.\n\nLegend has it that there is a gold table in the water under Flat Bridge that surfaces on the hottest days at noon in the river. Clinton Black’s Tales of Old Jamaica recounts a story where 24 bulls and 6 screaming slaves drowned after they tried to retrieve the table under the instructions of their plantation owner.\n\npanmedia.com.jm/blog/2014-10/4-popular-myths-about-flat-b..."
