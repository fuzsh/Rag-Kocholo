How do we know when a bridge works? With a little help from the Cat in the Hat, your students will use the Engineering Design Process and discover that a working bridge needs to be both long enough and strong enough. They will then have a chance to work with different materials to see for themselves what does and doesn't work. In this guide, videos from The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That! are used to demonstrate these concepts, and make your students' engineering adventure an exciting one!\r\nCheck out the Support Materials below for direct links to all the resources referenced in this Teacher's Guide.",
