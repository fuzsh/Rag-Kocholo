The National Water Commission and National Irrigation Commission have closed their intakes so that the contaminated water has not been received.”\n\nThe health department said it will continue to monitor the situation and the public will be advised when cleanup and remedial work at the river are complete and when it is safe to utilize the water and consume fish from the area."
