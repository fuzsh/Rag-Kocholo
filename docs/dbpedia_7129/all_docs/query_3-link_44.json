The one that came to mind immediately when I read what this month’s challenge would be about, is the most obvious:\n\nA structure built over something (such as a river) so that people or vehicles can get across.\n\nMy header image (a photograph that I took in China, during a trip more than ten years ago) is clearly in that category, as will many others be.\n\nBut I would also want to use Britannica’s second definition of the word:\n\nSomething that joins or connects different people or things.\n\nThat same header image is also a symbol connecting different concepts. If it looks vaguely familiar to you, it’s because a photograph of that same bridge has been used by Microsoft as one of its Windows screensaver images. A very modern concept. And yet, its clearly a relatively old structure, in a very traditional setting.\n\nBut let’s move onto the African continent and some memorable bridges or “bridges” that I’ve experienced, over the years."
