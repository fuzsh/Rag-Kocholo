This pier shape creates a continuous curve tied directly into the superstructure, while framing the river. The proportions reflect strength and elegance in their unique design. Two main piers feature observation platforms along the river's edge. The superstructure concrete box girder is a closed shape with inclined walls and smooth surfaces of continuous flat planes. The appearance from below is a sweeping form with the concrete material creating a visually clean and quiet space below the bridge.Â\n\nGlobal ViewÂ\n\nThis functional sculptural bridge is a series of modern arch forms softly set into the context of the site to maximize openness, light and green space, while focusing on the river. The river span sweeps 504' in a parabolic curve of graceful proportions. The pier shape of Concept A creates curved forms that move into the bridge superstructure.\n\nElevation\n\nCross section\n\nWall Locations\n\nNative stone wall rendering & Retaining Walls\n\nExample of Native Stone Wall near I-35E\n\nRailing Locations\n\nBridge Railing Materials\n\nDriver's perspective\n\nOpen rail\n\nOpen rail view #2\n\nColor\n\nBridge color as seen from the Guthrie Theater\n\nBridge color as seen from St. Anthony Falls\n\nLighting\n\nRoadway Safety Lighting\n\nAesthetic Lighting"
