        "text": "A new 15 MiGD Water Treatment Plant on the Rio Cobre river in St Catherine, Jamaica. The project involves the design, build, financing, maintenance and operation of the plant for a period of 23 years, under a 25-year Water Purchased Agreement between the National Water Commission and a SPV made up of Vinci Construction Grands Projets and Capital Infrastructure Group. Scope of work includes technical due diligence and construction and O&M monitoring for an intake facility, equipped with six water pumps fixed to the end of two oscillating booms that draw water off the surface of the river, and the proposed Plant, located around 300m from the intake."
