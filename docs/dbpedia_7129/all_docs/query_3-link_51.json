        "text": "When talking about the physical structure of the bridge itself, in general you would be correct. \"Over\" doesn't necessarily mean only an arch bridge — any bridge that is substantially above, such as a suspension bridge, could be implied.\n\nHowever, one could also emphasize not the physical bridge but the passage or motion. In this case, you could say \"across\" whenever the emphasis was on the crossing (getting from one side to the other) and \"over\" whenever the emphasis was on the state of being above/distant from the river. \"He needed a bridge to get across the river\" means that he is focussed on being on the other side of the river, and it doesn't matter what kind of bridge he ends up using. \"Like a bridge over troubled waters\" emphasizes that the bridge is removing you from the dangerous situation.\n\nA bridge over/across the river\n\nI think you can use either over or across. Both the prepositions convey the same meaning i.e. from one side to the other side of the river. Please look at the following sentence from Cambridge Dictionary:\n\nWe drove over/across the bridge.\n\nThe video on YouTube says that we prefer to use over in this case, but it doesn't mean that the use of across is wrong. So when you are talking about a movement from one side to the other side of something high, you can use of the prepositions, though \"over\" is preferable. It doesn't matter whether the bridge is a flat bridge or arch bridge.\n\nThe purpose of building a bridge is to cross the river; so \"across\" is used in the context of traveling or moving. E.g., Robison drove on the bridge across the river.\n\nIf movement is not to be emphasized, then \"bridge over the river\" is correct: e.g., A bridge has been built over the river.\n\nThe bridge is at a higher position and there is no contact between the river and the bridge. So, ‘over‘ can be used:\n\nThere is a bridge over the river.\n\nAgain, the bridge crosses the river from one side to the other. So, ‘across‘ can also be used :\n\nThere is a bridge across the river."
