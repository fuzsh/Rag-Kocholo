        "text": "Project overview\n\nCorrosion from weather is damaging the Snohomish River Bridge and Steamboat Slough Bridge. Beginning in 2023, crews working for WSDOT will rehabilitate the northbound SR 529 Snohomish River Bridge between Everett and Marysville by repairing or replacing steel truss elements, substructure elements, sway frames, timber sidewalks, cleaning and painting metal surfaces, and mechanical and electrical rehabilitation. Crews will also perform rehabilitation work to the SR 529 Steamboat Slough Bridge in both directions to ensure the end lift upper wheels work properly and the movable span is balanced.\n\nTimeline\n\nSummer 2023 â€“ Spring 2025\n\nProject status\n\nConstruction\n\nFunding\n\n$13.5 million\n\nWhat to expect\n\nSR 529 travelers can expect:\n\nSR 529 at the Snohomish River Bridge: From June 9 until early October, SR 529 in north Everett will be reduced to one lane in each direction at the Snohomish River. The northbound SR 529 Snohomish River Bridge will be closed. The southbound SR 529 Snohomish River Bridge will be reconfigured to carry one lane of traffic in each direction with a reduced speed limit.\n\nThe East Marine View Drive on-ramp to northbound SR 529 will also be closed during this four-month period. Traffic will be directed through local streets to get back on the northbound SR 529. Access from northbound SR 529 to Smith Island and Spencer Island will be open.\n\nA shuttle will take bicyclists past the work zone 24 hours a day. There may be a wait of up to 30 minutes for the shuttle. For shuttle pick-up/drop-off locations, see the map under the \"Maps and drawings\" tab.\n\nThere will also be about four months of lane reductions and multiple weekend full closures on the northbound SR 529 Snohomish River Bridge. Traffic will be diverted to northbound I-5 as an alternative route during weekend full closures.\n\nNorthbound SR 529 Steamboat Slough Bridge:\n\nThere will be two four-day full closures of the road and waterway. Traffic will be diverted to northbound I-5 during the continuous full closures. Access from northbound SR 529 to Smith Island and Spencer Island will be open."
