        "text": "This highlight of the greenway are the sweeping views of the mighty Mississippi River. It also connects to the Madison County (Illinois) Transit trail system via the McKinley Bridge and Old Chain of Rocks Bridge. There are some picnic tables in Riverfront Park along with restrooms that are open during the summer months.\n\nThe Historic Mary Meachum Freedom Crossing, Missouri’s first nationally designated Underground Railroad historic site, is approximately halfway between Biddle Street and the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge. Greenway visitors will also pass by tiny Rootwad Park adjacent to the Laclede Power Building. This “pocket park” features embellishments from the late Bob Cassilly, a famous St. Louis artist and founder of the City Museum. The City of St. Louis’ Riverfront Park is on the northern end of the greenway, and Maline Creek crosses through the greenway as it travels toward the Mississippi River.\n\nA 1.5 mile extension of the greenway opened in June 2016 and offers a dedicated bikeway and parallel path for walkers along the levee, underneath the Eads Bridge, past the grand staircase of the Gateway Arch, all the way to Chouteau Street. It is connected with the new sloping pathways that are part of the renovations of the Arch grounds.\n\nClick here for the master plan, current status and future connections for this greenway!\n\nTrail Info\n\n16.19 Miles\n\nThis 16-mile (includes Old Chain of Rocks and McKinley Bridge) paved trail in the Mississippi River Greenway is flat, and offers limited shade. It parallels the Mississippi River and winds it way through both sides of the flood wall that protects the city of St. Louis.\n\nPlease use caution when walking or riding on this trail because some sections are considered a levee road; you may see vehicles from adjacent businesses who are authorized to drive on the trail."
