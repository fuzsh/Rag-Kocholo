As it is, a petition has been circulated and signed by many residents living in the territory which will be immediately effected requesting the county court to take such action. They point out that a second bridge over Flat River in the lead belt district is really a necessity which has long been needed, and that present conditions, with a new bridge being erected and the old one torn down and ready to move, make such a project now both practical and economical.\n\nAs the Taylortown-Crawley Bottom crossing is about the only practical one aside from the one used by the Main Street crossing, and as a second crossing is really badly needed, undoubtedly the movement will meet with general approval throughout the lead belt. It would open up a way for traffic through the district which did not care to come through the heart of Flat River which would be widely and generally used. The removal of the Browne Dry Goods Company building, on the corner where the Taylortown street intersects with the present paved route of the highway, and the substitution of a filling station there, with a clear view of the highway in both directions resulting therefrom, adds greatly to the safety of such a movement.\n\nThose circulating the petition have stated their intention of presenting the matter to the Lead Belt Chamber of Commerce at their meeting next Monday evening.\n\nPublished by THE LEAD BELT NEWS, Flat River, St. Francois County, Missouri, Fri. Sept. 14, 1928."
