Persons just need to negotiate the area using their skill and experience from the perspective of how they were taught to drive to negotiate the Flat Bridge.”\n\nSome of these sources were found on the Jamaica Gleaner\n\nThe history of flat bridge\n\nIt’s hard to tell the exact date when the bridge was built, however it is presumed that the construction took place after 1724. KareemsQuest.com finds the architecture of the bridge both profound and simple, as it mainly consists of planks, two piers and two buttresses. It is this basic framework that has survived countless hurricanes and has now existed over three centuries.\n\nBased on information that kareemsquest.com found on Jamaica National Heritage Trust website, ‘When this bridge was being constructed, the sixteen plantations in the Bog Walk area were obliged to send one slave, in every fifty, to work on the River Road, sometimes called Sixteen Mile Walk.’\n\nLocated in the Bog Walk Gorge, this was no easy feat, especially when it rained and the slaves would have to dig for gravel, marl, lime, sand and stone. In the early 20th century, kareemsquest.com found out that rails were placed on the bridge, for an extra layer of safety, however these were quickly destroyed by the Rio Cobre River.\n\nOnce there is heavy rain Kareemsquest.com was told that the water can rise tens of feet above sea level, in the Gorge. As such, there are gates at the entrance and exit point of the Gorge and motorists are encouraged not to cross the bridge if it is raining.\n\nThere have been some minor upgrades over the years to add reinforcement, where needed, to ensure the bridge of three spans, two piers and two abutments is well supported.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nWho is it for: Historians, Adventurers.\n\nWhat it is NOT: A structured environment with security guards and gates.\n\nWhat stands out: The unique build of the bridge and the beauty of the gorge.\n\nWhat to carry: A camera with a fast shutter speed, as pictures will have to be taken quickly.\n\nMust try Activity:\n\nIdentifying the famous rock and taking a picture beside it.\n\nWhat is it similar to: Any other famous landmark locations on the island, like Hero’s Circle.\n\nLocation: Bog Walk Gorge, St. Catherine"
