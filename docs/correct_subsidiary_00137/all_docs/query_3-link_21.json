        "text": "In this paper I do not want to examine what Nietzsche thought about India but to take the other point of view and ask what and how Indians think or thought of Nietzsche, taking as examples Muhammad Iqbal (1877-1938), Sri Aurobindo (1872-1950) and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho) (1931-1990).\n\nOsho’s interpretation of Sufism is one of the most attractive interpretations currently available. He argued that exoteric dimension is dispensable for the practice of Sufism and this makes him unique amongst modern interpreters and “masters” of Sufism. He claimed to be a Sufi master. His more or less Nietzschean interpretation of mysticism and Sufism is intriguing, provocative and at times inconsistent and problematic. While highly insightful occasionally he takes too many liberties with the classical canons of scholarship. His lucid and easily accessible style is his strength."
