        "text": "The chaos rides 🤳 “100 Rupees? I am not an out-of-towner, I demand a better rate!”. “That’s the usual rate sir”, “I will give you 70 Rupees, not a paisa more”. Back in the 90s, when we arrived in town on-board a train, my family and I would lug our boxy suitcases down several flights of stairs from a foot-over-bridge. We would then walk towards a familiar auto-rickshaw rank. No drama, just a “right-of-passage” haggle and we'd swiftly be on our way. Fast forward to 2024, most travel is now by air, and boxy cases have long been replaced by their soft, wheeled counterparts. What’s more, there are escalators, travelators and elevators everywhere with no footbridges in sight. So last Saturday, when we touched down in Pune for a wedding, we swiftly made our way through the airport and headed to the “aeromall”. After a short walk, we reached the ride hailing area. Imagine a parking lot with haphazard signages and lots of people. Most of them, frustrated, trying to locate their rides with a phone in their hand. There was honking, hollering and a lot of unsafe maneuvering. Finally, after 4 calls, 40 minutes of waiting, and 400 breaths of assorted exhaust gasses we met our rescuer in chief. Why do Uber and its brethren descend into chaos at airports? I mean, these platforms are A+ at digitally serving the demand curve. In a large city for example, when demand spikes, they are lightening fast with scale and surge pricing. Their thrifty \"just-in-time\" supply chains are highly popular, not only among other platforms but also among traditional industries such as automobiles and semiconductors. Efficiency comes at a cost though. The “on-demand bliss” is highly vulnerable to disruptions and bottlenecks. COVID-19 exposed these flaws ruthlessly, most notably in the semiconductor industry, impacting car manufacturing. Factories shut down, and demand for consumer electronics soared, creating a chip shortage that led to production delays in the automotive sector. Could my airport-mare be linked to this vulnerability? Let's see. At an airport, digitally finding a ride is not the challenge, but drivers and passengers still need to find each other and load at unfamiliar places. When hundreds of rides & passengers do this “together”, the system breaks 🤷♂️. Think about it, both parties are already there, any matching, communication and random loading movement are just overheads. What if Uber could intelligently throttle the flow of drivers to a “pick up gateway” instead? The passengers could join their own queue after they “summon” and when it's time, they could board the first available ride! A QR scan can enable a retrospective digital match. A digital taxi rank! Now, I am sure that folks at these amazing companies have figured it all out, and I realize that I probably sound like a couch-key-warrior, but I am a responsible customer, and I care deeply. So the least I can do is haggle 🤓! #ondemand\n\n\"My LinkedIn AI twin 👨💻\" Despite its annoyances, I like LinkedIn. I've met plenty of amazing people over here and a lot of you know me from here as well. My network has grown massively over the years. I also really like LinkedIn learning. Oh and boy I'm glad that the platform’s discourse has not descended to the level of YouTube thumbnails. Yes, there's still a lot of cringe, there's a lack of depth but overall I think it's a positive network, with a massive potential. As a LinkedIn Premium member, I get data-driven insights, the ability to message anybody via InMails, and the badge has a bit of an appeal, but it doesn't feel like value for money. I get a lot of noise, and while there are many exclusive AI features, I am left wanting more. My hypothesis is that a LinkedIn digital twin would be a great feature to contain all that noise and drive meaningful engagement. I mean, DMs just don't feel right anymore 🤷♂️. So, this is my first attempt at building something from scratch and presenting it as a fully scalable solution to an open audience. It's only because of AI that I have been able to build this, and I've learnt so much. https://ai-bhinandan.com/ As adopting AI is beginning to feel like \"trying to hit a moving target, blindfolded while riding a horse,\" I think the only thing that can differentiate hype from reality is how much effort we put into building. Have a cracking weekend! #generativeai\n\nBe quiet, and listen to the silence 🤫 “May I have some water”? My delivery had just shown up at the door. “Sure! can I also bring you a can of coke?”. That look in his eyes negated any need for an answer. It took me a second to realize it. “Hang on”, I said, and rushed inside. What followed was hardly an original gesture but it certainly made the moment feel special. Somewhere though, there was an uncomfortable silence. About 25 minutes ago, I had pressed a button on my phone and a fellow human had to brave the elements, and put his life at risk on a high speed road. All for bringing me an “Iced Latte”. It's getting hotter and hotter in Dubai. Today, the city recorded a maximum of 42 degrees Celsius, and it's “only June”! To be fair, Dubai handles the rising mercury like a pro. All transportation and dwellings are air-conditioned, with basements and porches built specifically to avoid unnecessary sun exposure. My daily commute, for instance, starts in the basement of my building and ends in the basement of my office. Heat & humidity exposure is less than two minutes. Indeed, I know that I am lucky, and I am also acutely aware that in Dubai or Delhi, not everyone has the same privilege. My family and I often talk about this. Behind every cheap convenience, there is a silent reality. Perhaps, they're saving for a sister's wedding, or they simply have mouths to feed. They are hustling, always trying to make ends meet, with hope in their hearts and strife in their stride. I'm also aware that people living this reality have no use for my discomfort. One small gesture is hardly going to make a difference, but I've experienced that most people are kind and as long as they are able to listen to that uncomfortable silence, they will help. Listening to silence? I owe you an explanation. I have been devouring this book called “Stillness is the key”, by Ryan Holiday this weekend. Ryan reminds us that, in our frictionless, noisy, and digital world, “we are constantly training our mind to stick to the first thought that gets thrown at it”. He says, “If we want to think better, we need to seize these moments of quiet. If we want more revelations-more insights or breakthroughs or new, big ideas-we have to create more room for them. We have to step away from the comfort of noisy distractions and simulations. We have to start listening”. I interpret all of this as a “skill” we need to hone. One that gives us an ability to listen to those big and small moments of silence in our lives. A breathtaking sunset, or the birth of a child, our first time on stage in front of hundreds of people, or a difficult summer delivery of an “iced latte” at our doorstep. We must pause and listen to the moments of silence. Ryan's book has a quote by Herman Melville, the 18th century creator of “Moby Dick” that sums it all up beautifully. “All profound things and emotions of things are preceded and amended by silence, and silence is the consecration of the universe”. #culture\n\nThe Road Test “Abind, is there an Abind here?” I heard a deep voice through the corridor. “Excuse me, are you looking for me?” I approached this smartly dressed Emirati man. “Of course brother, I have been calling your name”, he quipped as we entered this large square room called \"The final road test\". After driving in over a dozen countries, my hubris took a beating when I moved to Dubai last year. I remember yelling, \"Man! They drive fast around here\" to my cab driver. I also never seem to get used to those high speed merges. Imagine a giant trailer thundering along at 120 kph, when you're accelerating towards it, it's often too close - not for the faint hearted. I have driven on the vast interstate network in the US, the Autobahns in Germany, and the motorways in the UK and on various expressways in India, but nothing compares with driving in Dubai. Habibi, you need to \"come to Dubai'' to experience it 😃. Along with 2 others, I was now seated in the waiting area. There were RTA signages everywhere and functional furniture dotted almost every wall and corner. In a few minutes, a door “clicked” open. A young kandora-clad officer emerged from the “examiner's room” with a tablet. He verified our IDs and then announced the sequence of testing. “Abind, you go 2nd”, he said. We now got into the car. At first, there was pin drop silence in the cabin. The first driver looked at all the mirrors so much that I thought he deserved an Oscar 😂. After adjusting everything for a good 45 seconds, the examiner calmly asked, “ready?” and we started. The examiner kept his cool and gave clear driving instructions. At one point the driver slowed too much, when the examiner said, “let's go brother, why slow down?”. I thought his sparse comments were epic. Soon, he said “park when safe”. As the candidate got out of the seat, the examiner asked him, “is the car parked correctly?”, it wasn't. “Should I correct it?”, said the candidate. The examiner retorted, “is it parked correctly?” the candidate gave in, “no” he said, “Khallas, then” declared the officer. Now it was my turn and yes, it wasn’t my first time. I had failed my previous attempt. “I oversped because my instructor had told me”, I had justified back then. This time, I simply drove like “me”. I went across a roundabout and merged onto a motorway. I switched lanes, and headed back towards the exit as instructed. Zero mistakes. The third candidate was ok, too. We arrived back at the testing area, and the examiner gave feedback to everyone. When it was my turn, he simply looked at me, paused for a second and said only one word, “pass”. Think about it, unfamiliarity affects our strongest craft in unexpected ways. In a difficult road test, for instance, you must remain calm, and make good decisions at the wheel. You might fail regardless of your experience but you must trust your craft and try. Unfamiliarity also has a different thrill to it, but Habibi, you must embrace it to experience it 😃. #culture\n\n\"Inner place & outer space\" I am all but convinced that there are only two kinds of people out there. Those on the “inside” and those “outside”. The thought has played on my mind like rats in a basement for several months, but last week, a train ride from Pune put everything into perspective. I was running late and before I could even enter the station, I heard the engine roar from a distance. Fearing a slippery disaster, I planted myself firmly into a position and then started “speed-walking”. The train had just moved so I picked up the pace, too. As soon as I spotted an opening, I hurled myself in. I tried to open the heavy door of a crowded compartment, when someone on the inside yelled, “Oh mister, this is second class! Keep walking!”. It's amusing how the “insiders” assume that all “outsiders” are from third class. I held steady by the grips as another one bawed, “there's so much space in the compartment ahead!”. Except there wasn't. I was pushing in, and people inside were resisting. The door didn't give an inch. Especially with a giant, self-appointed doorman protecting its side. Within seconds, I had to retreat, but I wasn't going to give in. I went straight for the window. I shoved my rucksack and dove in, head first. My hands spread out, legs up in the air, I was a human trident 🔱. Now I'm not sure whether Lord Shiva had mercy on me, but people inside certainly did. The train had picked up speed by now. I was dragged inside, and now stood shoulder to shoulder with the giant doorman. Within minutes, I had completely changed. The anger I had about the doorman was long gone. At first, there was some pretty boring small-talk, and then he offered me a fruit and in turn I offered him a cigarette. We joined our rucksacks together and settled on our makeshift seats. It was incredible, my thoughts for the doorman went from borderline homicidal to benevolent in a matter of minutes. The “insiders” too, gave up their animosity. I was now part of the very force I had been fighting. My beliefs were transformed, my perspective altered, and my struggle turned into cooperation. So, at the next station, when a group of unruly passengers tried to wade into our compartment, we put up a united front and I protected my “insider” brethren. I was never going to look at the world the same. Think about it, this phenomenon is the very basis of our ambition, happiness, and adversity. Whether in our careers, politics, or our lives. The insiders are riding the present while the outsiders wait to ride the future; insiders stretch their limbs and worship slumber, while outsiders worry about finding 12 inches of space to stand. All this while the almighty nature plays an endless game of swap among the ”insiders” and “outsiders”. This game is all about “finding space”. Whether that space is 6 ft from Tolstoy's tale of “how much land does a man need” or 6000 miles from Churchill's dream of the Empire. #culture (Based on G.V. Karandikar's - आतले आणि बाहेरचे)\n\n“Chatmail” E-mails have been around for over 50 years, yet they refuse to become obsolete. Despite best efforts. It's probably because they do the job though, right? why fix something that ain't broken 😃. Firstly, Cal Newport wouldn't agree with you. Second, I simply wondered, if we could make email better with a \"generative\" take. I highlight the technical approach in the video and also how it could get a lot better, especially with multi-agent approaches such as Microsoft's Autogen. Autogen is truly incredible, and shows outstanding potential. However in my experience it currently costs a lot and it's stubbornly difficult to get reliable results. Meanwhile, tried and tested tool calling using “commodity” closed source models seems to be the way to achieve agentic “actions” with LLMs, much beyond this use case. I am also confident that these are very feasible in a production setup. Yes, I tried open source models too. There is too much effort needed to “make them work”. It feels like trying to dig tunnels with a stick. I'd rather build on OpenAI's TBMs, and switch to open source later. How would you use agentic tool calling? #generativeai\n\n3 stories on defying odds In 1940s Hollywood, Heidi Lamarr was known as the most beautiful woman in the world. Born in 1914 Vienna, Heidi was a curious child. Her father would take her for long walks and they would both discuss workings of machines such as the printing press or automobiles. Heidi’s life took her from an acting career in German films to being married to a scandalous Austrian munitions dealer. Somehow, in a dramatic set of events, Lamarr escaped in 1937 to London and ended up at the famous MGM studios, and the next thing? Lamarr was a Hollywood star! Lamarr always carried her curious DNA from the “long walks\". She tinkered & created an upgraded “spotlight”, designed a fast plane wing using bio-mimicry and developed a “soda-pill”. In the year 1940, Lamarr met George Antheil, a composer and a fellow inventor. They discussed the looming war. Lamarr expressed how she wasn't comfortable in Hollywood while her country needed her. Together they invented a brilliant method to ensure an allied torpedo hit its target without the fear of being radio jammed. While not fully original, their “frequency hopping” technique is widely considered to be the foundation of many technologies such as Wi-Fi and GPS! That's right, reality is often stranger than fiction. It stands on the shoulders of giants and is often enabled by unsung heroes. American scientist James Watson and English physicist Francis Crick for instance, are often credited with the discovery of the DNA. Truth however, is complicated. DNA was first identified by Swiss Chemist Friedrich Meischer in the late 1860s. Decades later, in the twentieth century, Russian biochemist Levene first identified the way RNA & DNA are put together and Erwin Chargaff, in 1950, carried their work forward. He noted that DNA “varies” among species. Years later, Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer based at King's College London, took the famous “photo 51” of the X-shaped structure of the DNA molecule. This evidence was crucial for Watson & Crick to put everything “together”. Sadly, Rosalind was recognised only posthumously. Now, “invention” may take decades, but sometimes, “moonshots” accelerate it. On July 16th 1969, Apollo 11 carried the first humans on a historic mission to the moon. Powering the flight was a state-of-the-art “AGC” or Apollo guidance computer. This was a moment in computing history as it was not only one of the first computers to use the “integrated circuitry” but also to have a prominent “display keyboard” layout. The AGC had a sophisticated compiler and a software system that was able to prioritize in real-time, critical tasks such as navigation. The entire effort was led by the amazing Margaret Hamilton, coining the term \"software engineering\". This March, as we mark International Women's Day, let's also draw inspiration from Heidi, Rosalind and Margaret, and dream a brighter future, where every woman's achievements shine brightly, free from the shadows of bias. #IWD\n\nThe office. We don't do much “hybrid” around here. Not because we cannot “work from home”, but because working in the office is, simply put, helpful. Most departments are located in the same building and you can just walk up to anyone and express yourself. Oh yes and there is always one too many things to do. Sometimes, it just feels too intense, “I've to deal with all this?” and I take a deep breath of trepidation but then the next hour, I realize the duality of that emotion, and I switch to “I can't believe I am doing all this” 😃! The trips to the office start on an 8 lane expressway in Dubai. The neighborhood I live in is lined up with sun-kissed residential properties, beautifully landscaped gardens and painstakingly curated flower beds. As the car makes its way out of the community, the desert makes its presence felt. It's rarely left to its wits though, as an army of construction vehicles and heavy machinery can be seen terraforming this unforgiving landscape. Dubai doesn't give in easily, it rises from the sand, defying odds in the duel between man and nature. As the car speeds up to over 120 kph, I try to discern the unspoken rules of the road but I quickly realize it's going to take me some time and there are no shortcuts. As we progress, on my left, I notice the Burj Khalifa, and how it effortlessly dwarfs the rest of the skyline. 12,000 people, 22 million hours and such an impressive feat of engineering but what's more impressive is how every single day it can have the same inspiring impact on you. I suppose, such is the nature of boundless ambition. As the car pulls over, I get to our reception. The lifts are busy, but we are duly assisted by our building staff that make sure we get on a lift as quickly as possible. The floor that me and my team sit on is brand new and a day here is easily spent fulfilling the needs of an analytics hungry business. To top that, all around me are new people, new platforms, new tools, new processes, new products, new models and often new escalations. I won't lie, in an established setup you can't even dream of doing these things. It can be exhilarating and exhausting at the same time! As I wrap up my work, it's already dusk time. Trips back from the office are super special for me because of the spectacular sunsets in Dubai. Clear, unobstructed views of the horizon, unique atmospheric conditions and high altitude clouds scatter the light into magnificent hues. As the car and I glide across E611 at 120kph, the sound of rubber hitting the road and the serene colours in the sky have an uncanny relaxing effect on me. I reach back home, and I am greeted with a loud “Daddy is back!” and a leap hug, that somehow feels a little tighter and a little longer than usual. I too hold on, just a little bit longer. #worklife"
