Sep 26, 2012 Y Y Expert Group Jonas Borjesson I (Jonas Borjesson) started to work with SIP back in 2002 when I joined Hotsip - a company that had one of the first live SIP VoIP deployments in the world. Hotsip was acquired by Oracle in 2006 and during my time at these two companies I participated in the following projects related to SIP: * Part of the team that implemented JSR116 * Part of the team that built a new type of event driven container that handled both SIP and SS7 where I spent most of my time integrating the Oracle SIP container into this new container. * Part of the team that built a Presence Enabler as specified by OMA Presence Enabler 1.0.1. ** Personally responsible for the design and implementation of the generic subscribe/notify framework as defined by RFC3265, 3903 (we built this on top of jain sip though, 116 was early draft at the time and not clear how to act as a client in an efficient manner). ** Once Hotsip was acquired by Oracle, I was the lead in maintaining and further develop Oracles presence enabler sold under the name OCP. In January 2011 I joined Twilio as the SIP expert and am responsible for everything related to SIP and signaling. As such, I am responsible for choosing the appropriate SIP technologies, designs the overall architecture as well as being the main developer for these SIP related services. Many of these services are built on top of JSR289 so I have a lot of direct experience dealing with SIP containers, both implementing them as well as using them. Also, I do contribute to Mobicent's open source SIP container as much as I can, mainly because I think it is fun but also because sometimes we need to fix things for our own use case here at Twilio.
