        "text": "Police say a 3-year-old boy was killed and his 7-year-old sister was injured in a Friday night shooting in Buffalo.\n\nOfficers were called to the intersection of Domedion Avenue and Heminway Street just before 9:30 p.m. Officials say that's where 3-year-old Ramone Carter, who was riding his tricycle, and his 7-year-old sister were struck by gunfire during an outdoor family gathering.\n\n\"A 3-year-old, riding his tricycle, having fun with members of his family on a hot summer night,\" Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said Saturday. \"His 7-year-old big sister [was] right by his side, and out of nowhere, gunfire erupts and the children are struck by gunfire.\"\n\nPolice say the Carter was taken to Erie County Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. The 7-year-old was taken to Oishei Children's Hospital for treatment after she was grazed by gunfire. Police say she is expected to survive.\n\nBrown said that the gunfire was not related to the family gathering.\n\n\"It was a hot night,\" Brown said. \"There were a lot of people out on Domedion [Avenue]. A lot of people that were out that were not connected to the family gathering.\"\n\nBrown said that the mother of the children is active in the community as a member of the Most Valuable Parents, a group of citizens working to tackle issues that impact the area such as gun violence.\n\n\"I am heartbroken about what occurred and I think all of us are sick and tired of standing up and announcing situations like this to the community,\" Brown said. \"I will tell you that it's additionally heartbreaking that the mom of these two children [is] known to some of us. She is a strong woman. She is a woman that is active in the community. She is a member of the Most Valuable Parents organization. And she is out consistently working with other families, working with children, trying to keep families safe [and] trying to keep children in our community safe, and this happens to her children. So I'm heartbroken today. I'm a little out of sorts today. I'll be very honest about that. The guns have to be put down. There's no reason for all of these illegal weapons to be on the streets.\"\n\nBrown said that two persons of interest were interviewed Friday night by police and released.\n\nBPD Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia announced Saturday that a gun was recovered from the scene. He says police believe one gun and one shooter were involved. An investigation is ongoing.\n\n\"As the mayor said, there are too many guns being illegally possessed and being used,\" Gramaglia said. \"People, generally speaking, use gunfire to settle disputes. And it's got to stop.\"\n\nPolice are asking anyone with information to call or text the confidential TIPCALL line at 716-847-2255.\n\nA reward of up to $7,500 is being offered by Crime Stoppers for information leading to an arrest or indictment of the person or persons responsible for Carter's death. You can call 716-867-6161 or submit a tip by downloading the free Crime Stoppers mobile app Buffalo Tips."
