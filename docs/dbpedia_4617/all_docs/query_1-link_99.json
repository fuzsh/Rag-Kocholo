        "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) â The most severely wounded survivor of the 2018 massacre at Parklandâs Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School now owns shooter Nikolas Cruzâs name, and Cruz cannot give any interviews without his permission, under a settlement reached in a lawsuit.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nA survivor of the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Fla. now owns shooter Nikolas Cruz's name, and Cruz cannot give any interviews without his permission, under a settlement reached in a lawsuit\n\nUnder his recent settlement with Anthony Borges, Cruz must also turn over any money he might receive as a beneficiary of a relativeâs life insurance policy, participate in any scientific studies of mass shooters and donate his body to science after his death\n\nBorges, now 21, was shot five times in the back and legs and collapsed in the middle of the third-floor hallway\n\nBorges, the families of those Cruz murdered and other survivors are also suing former Broward County sheriffâs deputy Scot Peterson, the sheriffâs office and two former school security guards, alleging they failed to protect the students and staff\n\nUnder his recent settlement with Anthony Borges, Cruz must also turn over any money he might receive as a beneficiary of a relativeâs life insurance policy, participate in any scientific studies of mass shooters and donate his body to science after his death.\n\nThe agreement means that Cruz, 25, cannot benefit from or cooperate with any movies, TV shows, books or other media productions without Borgesâ permission. Cruz is serving consecutive life sentences at an undisclosed prison for each of the 17 murders and 17 attempted murders he committed inside a three-story classroom building on Feb. 14, 2018.\n\nâWe just wanted to shut him down so we never have to hear about him again,â Borgesâ attorney, Alex Arreaza, said Thursday.\n\nBorges, now 21, was shot five times in the back and legs and collapsed in the middle of the third-floor hallway. Video shows that Cruz pointed his rifle at Borges as he lay on the floor, but unlike most of the other victims he walked past, did not shoot him a second time. Arreaza said he asked Cruz why he didnât shoot Borges again, but he didnât remember.\n\nA promising soccer player before the shooting, Borges has undergone more than a dozen surgeries and still lives in pain. He received donations, a $1.25 million settlement from the Broward County school district and an undisclosed settlement from the FBI for their failures in preventing the shooting. Arreaza said it is difficult to say whether Borges has received enough money to cover his future medical expenses.\n\nSeveral other families also sued Cruz, and a mini-trial had been scheduled for next month to assess damages against him. That trial has been canceled, Arreaza said. David Brill, the attorney representing the other families, did not return a phone call and two email messages seeking comment.\n\nFlorida already has laws that prohibit inmates from keeping any proceeds related to their crimes, including any writings or artwork they might produce in prison. In addition, Judge Elizabeth Scherer, when she sentenced Cruz, ordered that any money placed in his prison commissary account be seized to pay restitution to the victims and their families and all court and investigation costs. In total, that would be millions of dollars.\n\nArreaza said he feared that without the settlement, Cruz could find a way around the law and the judgeâs order or assign any money he might receive to a relative or other person."
