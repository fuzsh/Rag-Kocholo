        "text": "Seattle Police homicide detectives are investigating the death of a 9-month-old child who was shot in the head by their father in the Magnolia neighborhood.\n\nThe shooting occurred around 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday in the 3000 block of 21st Ave. W, just west of the Interbay Athletic Complex.\n\nOfficers initially responded to a nearby block, where two people reported that a man had fired at them, but missed, and the bullets hit nearby parked cars.\n\nBoth victims identified the suspected shooter as 35-year-old Dion Montgomery.\n\nAs Montgomery was being taken into custody, 911 got a call about a woman running outside with a gun, someone had shot her baby.\n\nWhen officers made contact with the woman, they learned that Montgomery was her husband. She told officers that she was in the bathroom of their apartment when she heard a gunshot. She said she asked her husband what that was and he told her it was a \"blank\" round. She left the bathroom, saw the gun in his pocket and took it from him, she told officers.\n\nMontgomery left the apartment and his wife went in to check on their child, when she saw the horrific scene, court documents said.\n\nUnfortunately, the child was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nShe ran outside looking for help after seeing her baby shot.\n\nBoth parents were taken into custody for questioning.\n\nThe child's mother broke down in tears, and said that Montgomery routinely carries a gun on him, and he had it on him that day, court documents said.\n\nShe admitted they both smoked marijuana the day of the shooting, but was unaware that Montgomery also admitted to police that he smoked PCP before the shooting, and blamed his actions on \"demons.\"\n\nAccording to the National Library of Medicine, Phencyclidine (or PCP, \"angel dust\") is an infamous hallucinogenic sought for its ability to induce the illusion of euphoria, omnipotence, superhuman strength, and social and sexual prowess.\n\nMontgomery's wife also told police that he periodically gets a \"weird look in his eyes\" and he acts differently then, so she knows to stay away from him when he gets like that, according to court documents. She told police he tried to kill her one time before.\n\nHowever, his wife said she was unaware of any diagnosed mental health issues for Montgomery and said normally he is a great father who has never hurt their child before.\n\nMontgomery was booked into King County Jail for first-degree murder, two counts of first-degree assault and first-degree unlawful possession of a firearm.\n\nAccording to the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office, Montgomery has 16 prior arrests and 14 felony charges, including theft, assault, burglary, possession of a stolen vehicle and unlawful possession of a firearm.\n\nBail has been set at $5 million.\n\nMORE HEADLINES FROM FOX 13 SEATTLE\n\nShelter-in-place phone alert was sent to more people than intended, Tacoma Fire says\n\nBikini baristas flout Everett's new 'dress code,' prompting concerns from stand owners\n\nShoreline Catholic school not renewing teacher's contract because she is marrying a woman\n\nTacoma doctor performed unnecessary spinal surgeries on veterans and billed government, DOJ says\n\nCovington residents want answers about controversial proposal to build battery storage facility"
