        "text": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — More than six months after a man was shot and killed while driving on the Loop 202 in Mesa, his grieving family is still searching for answers and asking the public’s help in finding his killer.\n\nPhoenix Police’s Silent Witness unit hosted a news conference to bring more awareness to the case Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe family of the victim, 50-year-old Keith Henion, was also in attendance, pleading for someone to come forward.\n\n“Keith was the nicest person,” said Elizabeth Henion, Keith’s wife. “He was a super parent. My kids felt like he was their best friend.”\n\n“He made everybody feel special,” said Katie Grafing, Keith’s sister-in-law. “He was an amazing person and its so unfair they took him so early.”\n\nAround 12:45 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 28, a DPS trooper spotted what was believed to be a broken-down pickup truck on the left shoulder of eastbound Loop 202 (Red Mountain Freeway) near Alma School Road.\n\nUpon further investigation, the truck had crashed into the median barrier wall, and Henion was found shot to death in the driver’s seat.\n\nInvestigators believe Henion was shot while driving eastbound on the 202 between Dobson and Alma School roads. Family members previously told Arizona’s Family that it happened when Henion was driving home.\n\nBut six months later, detectives still don’t know what led up to the shooting or who is responsible.\n\n“This did not need to happen,” said Keith’s mother, Peggy Aspinwall. “There is a person in our community with a gun that can shoot you on the way home from work or school.”\n\nAnyone with information regarding Henion’s death is asked to call Silent Witness at 480-WITNESS (480-948-6377) or 480-TESTIGO (480-837-8446) for Spanish speakers. You can also leave a tip at silentwitness.org.\n\n“We want to know why,” said Phoenix Police Sgt. Brian Bower. “Why somebody was willing to put his finger on the trigger, pull the trigger, just to end somebody’s life.”\n\nA tipster with info leading to an arrest could be eligible for a reward of up to $7,000.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
