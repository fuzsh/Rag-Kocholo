        "text": "When Davonte was asked what he wanted for his birthday, he didn’t ask for a big celebration, he only said, “I’m glad I made it to see 18.” He was shot and killed less than one week after turning 18. He had previously spoken before the Baltimore City Council on youth violence prevention.\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe Deadly Impact of Guns on Children and Teens in America\n\nAnnually, more than 4,000 children and teens (ages 0 to 19) are shot and killed, and more than 17,000 are shot and wounded—that’s an average of 59 children and teens in the US every day. And the effects of gun violence extend far beyond those struck by a bullet: An estimated three million children witness a shooting each year. Gun violence shapes the lives of the children who witness it, know someone who was shot, or live in fear of the next shooting.\n\nGun deaths among children and teens by intent\n\nFirearms are the leading cause of death for children and teens. This is a uniquely American problem. Compared to other high-income countries, American children aged 5 to 14 are 21 times more likely to be killed with guns, and American adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 are 23 times more likely to be killed with guns.\n\nWhen American children and teens are killed with guns, 63 percent are homicides—nearly 2,600 deaths per year. Children are particularly impacted by the intersection of domestic violence and gun violence. For children under age 13 who are victims of gun homicides, 85 percent of those deaths occur in the home, and nearly a third of those deaths are connected to intimate partner or family violence. Between 2015 and 2022, nearly two in three child and teen victims of mass shootings died in incidents connected to domestic violence. Data drawn from 16 states indicate that nearly two-thirds of child fatalities involving domestic violence were caused by guns.\n\nAnother 31 percent of child and teen gun deaths are suicides—nearly 1,300 per year. And firearm suicide has been rising dramatically: Over the past decade, the firearm suicide rate among children and teens has increased by 43 percent. For people of all ages, having access to a gun increases the risk of death by suicide by three times. Research shows that an estimated 4.6 million American children live in homes with at least one gun that is loaded and unlocked. The combination of suicidal ideation and easy firearm access can be lethal. When children under the age of 18 die by gun suicide, they are likely to have used a gun they found at home: Over 80 percent of child gun suicides involved a gun belonging to a parent or relative.\n\nGun violence manifests in a myriad of ways in American schools, and school shootings have created new anxieties for the younger generation of students. According to an Everytown analysis, there have been at least 848 incidents of gunfire on school grounds from 2013 to 2021. Of these, 573 occurred on the grounds of preschool, elementary, middle, or high schools, resulting in 188 people killed and 392 people wounded. While mass fatality shootings like the incident at Sandy Hook Elementary School—and, more recently, at Robb Elementary School—are not commonplace, schools are more likely to experience gun homicides and assaults, unintentional shootings resulting in injury or death, and gun suicide and self-harm injuries. All incidents of gun violence in schools, regardless of their intent or victim count, compromise the safety of students and staff.\n\nChildren and teens who live in cities are at a significantly higher risk of gun homicides and assaults compared to their peers in rural areas. Ninety-two percent of all hospitalizations of children for firearm injuries occur in urban areas (counties with over 50,000 residents). These injuries have lifelong consequences: Almost 50 percent of the wounded have a disability when they are discharged from the hospital. Fifteen- to 19-year-olds in urban areas are hospitalized for firearm assaults at a rate eight times higher than 15- to 19-year-olds in rural areas. Urban and low-income youth are much more likely to witness gun violence than suburban and higher-income youth.\n\nThe Disproportionate Impact of Gun Violence on Black and Latinx Children and Teens\n\nAs with gun violence generally, the impact of this crisis on children and teens is not equally shared across populations. Black children and teens in America are more than 17 times more likely than their white peers to die by gun homicide. Black children and teens are 13 times more likely to be hospitalized for a firearm assault than white children. Latinx children and teens are 3 times more likely to die by gun homicide than their white peers.\n\nWhite and Black children may live in the same city yet experience it differently. Due to policy decisions that enforce racial segregation and disinvestment in certain communities, gun violence is concentrated in Black neighborhoods within cities, many of which are marked by high levels of poverty and joblessness and low levels of investment in education. A high concentration of these factors in a neighborhood is referred to as “concentrated disadvantage” and is a strong predictor of violent crime. Youth in neighborhoods that experience concentrated disadvantage can be isolated from institutions such as schools and jobs, increasing the risk that they will engage in crime and violence, thus feeding into this vicious cycle of violence.\n\nBlack and Latinx children in cities are exposed to violence at higher rates than white children. Exposure includes witnessing violence, hearing gunshots, and knowing individuals who have been shot. Black children in Columbus, OH, were exposed to 66 percent more violence, on average, than white children. In Chicago, Latinx children had 74 percent greater odds of exposure to violence, and Black children 112 percent greater odds, than white children. When children in these cities are exposed to gun violence, their communities and schools often lack the resources to help them heal.\n\n30%\n\nGunfire on school grounds occurs most often at schools with a majority of students of color—disproportionately affecting Black students. Although Black students represent approximately 15 percent of the total K–12 school population in America, they make up 30 percent of the average population at schools that have been impacted by a fatal shooting.\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, American Federation of Teachers, and National Education Association, “How To Stop Shootings and Gun Violence in Schools: A Plan to Keep Students Safe,” August 19, 2022, https://everytownresearch.org/report/how-to-stop-shootings-and-gun-violence-in-schools/.\n\nThe disproportionate impact of gun violence on Black and Latinx children and teens extends to schools. Among the incidents of gunfire at K-12 schools between 2013 and 2021, where the racial demographic information of the student body was known, 67 percent occurred in majority-minority schools. Although Black students represent approximately 15 percent of the total K-12 school population in the US, they constitute 30 percent of the average population at schools that have been impacted by a fatal shooting.\n\nWhile the above discussion shows the disparate experiences of gun violence by race and ethnicity, the data further show that gun violence is concentrated in specific neighborhoods in cities, with some schools and certain communities experiencing gun violence with an alarming frequency.\n\nOf the schools covered by gunshot detection technology in Washington, DC, just 9 percent experienced nearly half of all gunfire incidents. Four schools, including two middle schools and two high schools, had at least nine incidents of gunfire within just 500 feet of the school.\n\nSimilarly, in Los Angeles, 34 percent of middle school students in one neighborhood with high rates of violence reported exposure to firearm violence.\n\nAt certain urban middle schools in Texas, nearly 40 percent of boys and 30 percent of girls have witnessed a gun being pulled.\n\nA study of 7-year-olds in an urban neighborhood found that 75 percent had heard gunshots, 18 percent had seen a dead body, and 61 percent worried some or a lot of the time that they might get killed or die.\n\nThe Far-reaching Impact of Children’s and Teens’ Exposure to Gun Violence\n\nChildren are harmed in numerous ways when they witness violence. Children exposed to violence, crime, and abuse are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol; suffer from depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder; resort to aggressive and violent behavior; and engage in criminal activity. Exposure to community violence, including witnessing shootings and hearing gunshots, makes it harder for children to succeed in school.\n\nChildren’s exposure to gun violence can also erode physical health. When children live in neighborhoods where gun violence is common, they spend less time playing and being physically active, with one study finding that children said they would engage in an additional hour of physical activity every week if safety increased in their neighborhood.\n\nStress related to gun violence affects student performance and well-being in schools. School-aged children have lower grades and more absences when they are exposed to violence. High school students who have been exposed to violence have lower test scores and lower rates of high school graduation. One study estimated that Black children in Chicago’s most violent neighborhoods spend at least a week out of every month functioning at lower concentration levels due to local homicides. In Syracuse, NY, elementary schools located in areas with high concentrations of gunshots had 50 percent lower test scores and higher rates of standardized test failure compared to elementary schools in areas with a low concentration of gunshots.\n\nBlack high school students in the US are over twice as likely as white high school students to miss school due to safety concerns. In Chicago, following spikes in neighborhood violence, students reported feeling less safe, experiencing more disciplinary problems, and having less trust in teachers.\n\nRecommendations\n\nComprehensive approaches to protect our youth and prevent children’s exposure to gun violence in their communities and schools must include a combination of gun safety laws and school and community-based solutions.\n\nBackground checks on all gun sales\n\nThe foundation of any comprehensive gun violence prevention strategy must be background checks for all gun sales. Under current federal law, criminal background checks are required only for sales conducted by licensed dealers. This loophole is easy to exploit and makes it easy for convicted felons or domestic abusers to acquire guns without a background check simply by finding an unlicensed seller online or at a gun show.\n\nExtreme Risk laws\n\nThese laws, increasingly being adopted by states, empower family members and law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily block a person from having guns if they pose a danger to themselves or others. Extreme Risk laws—sometimes referred to as “red flag” laws—can help prevent suicide, too. That is meaningful because nearly six out of every 10 gun deaths are suicides, and the suicide rate among children and teens has been increasing exponentially in the past 10 years.\n\nSecure gun storage and child access prevention laws\n\nSecure storage laws require people to store firearms responsibly to prevent unsupervised access to firearms. A subset of these laws, known as child access prevention laws, specifically target unsupervised access by minors. Secure firearm storage practices are associated with reductions in the risk of self-inflicted and unintentional firearm injuries among children and teens—up to 85 percent depending on the type of storage practice.\n\nCommunity leaders and school officials can help prevent shootings by notifying families about the critical importance of secure firearms storage. Public awareness campaigns like the Be SMART program, developed by Everytown, educate the school community on secure gun storage. School districts across the country are passing resolutions requiring schools to provide parents with resources about secure gun storage. State legislatures can also enact laws mandating this requirement.\n\nKeeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers\n\nChildren are frequent casualties of domestic violence homicides when a gun is involved. Research also shows that the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation makes it five times more likely that a woman will be killed. It is imperative to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers to keep women, children, and their families safe. When abusers are convicted of domestic violence or subject to final restraining orders, they should be blocked from purchasing guns and required to turn in those they already own. We also need to close the “dating partner loophole” by making sure those laws apply to abusers regardless of whether the violence is directed towards a spouse or a dating partner.\n\nIn addition to evidence-based gun safety laws, there are a number of programs and strategies that communities and schools can adopt to keep children and teens safe from gun violence, some examples of which include:\n\nCrisis intervention programs\n\nSchools should work with community partners to create trauma-informed crisis intervention practices to intervene before a person commits an act of violence. A 2018 Department of Homeland Security report stated that “preventing violence by detecting and addressing these [behavioral] red flags is more effective than any physical security measure.” Successful crisis interventions uphold students’ civil rights and avoid a disproportionate impact on historically marginalized students and students with disabilities, address student access to guns, and provide appropriate school-based mental health services.\n\nSafe and equitable schools\n\nSchool communities must look inside their schools to make sure they are encouraging effective partnerships between students and adults, while also looking externally to ensure that they are a key community resource. Schools should review discipline practices and ensure threat assessment programs are not adversely affecting school discipline. They should work to become “community schools” by building effective community partnerships that provide services that support students, families, and neighborhoods. If and when employing school resource officers (SROs), schools should take steps to build relationships between communities and law enforcement.\n\nYouth-centric intervention programs\n\nA variety of programs exist to help children cope with witnessing firearm violence. School-based programs, including social emotional learning, have been shown to reduce the negative effects of children’s exposure to gun violence. Mentoring programs are effective at improving academic performance and reducing youth violence. Chicago’s Safe Passage program makes children feel safer on their way to and from school and may increase school attendance. To learn more about two specific organizations that help children succeed after witnessing violence, please explore these resources about the Hip Hop Heals and Becoming A Man programs.\n\nIf you or someone you know has been exposed to gun violence, there are resources that can help. Everytown’s Children’s Responses to Trauma provides information for parents and adults about how to support children and teens who have experienced a shooting or are upset by images of gun violence. Additional information to help with the emotional, medical, financial, and legal consequences of gun violence for individuals and communities is on our Resources page."
