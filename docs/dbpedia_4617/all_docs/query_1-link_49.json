        "text": "When shots rang out in front of Druscilla Rodriguez's home at Miramar Apartments in Fort Worth on Wednesday evening, she went into \"mommy mode.\"\n\n\"I ran out to get my son, threw him to the ground, but he was already hit,\" she recalled.\n\nShe quickly went from her six-year-old, Ka'deon, to her three-year-old, Me'chelle.\n\n“When I ran over to pick her up, when I lifted her, she just started gushing out blood from two different wounds,\" Rodriguez said. “I thought that was the last time that I would see my baby’s eyes open.”\n\nRodriguez said they had been sitting outside with neighbors.\n\n\"…Laughing and talking. Next thing you know, a car drove by, and opened fire,\" she said.\n\nDad, Dontee Kinney, said he rushed home from work to find the chaotic scene.\n\nThey said Ka'deon was hit in the femur bone and right leg and had surgery the next morning to put in a metal plate and screws.\n\n“He has to do physical therapy, and it’s all dependent on the therapy of when he’ll be able to completely walk again,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nFort Worth Police said at least one or more people opened fire, injuring six people.\n\nThey said the oldest victim is 19 years old, and the youngest is just three-- little Meme.\n\n“It went through her liver, punctured the right kidney, they had to remove the right kidney, and it also punctured a main blood vessel,\" Rodriguez explained.\n\nThe parents are grateful that their children are recovering: Meme is out of a coma and off of the ventilator. Ka'deon was discharged from the hospital on Friday.\n\n“Like I told him, ‘Man, you’re the strongest 6-year-old I know,\" Kinney said.\n\nOn Friday, police said they had identified a suspect vehicle but were not releasing those details.\n\n“Why? Why open up fire when you see there’s nothing but children outside playing?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n“They haven’t even lived long enough to… have to go through anything like that,\" said Kinney.\n\nRodriguez and Kinney hope police catch those responsible for what their family has been through over the last few days, and for the long road to recovery for them, and all six of their children.\n\n\"Painful,\" Kinney said.\n\n“My kids are traumatized. They don’t want to go home. Some of my children don’t want to be outside, they’re scared to go outside and play,\" she added.\n\nThe parents are drawing hope from their little ones, like Ka'deon's bright spirit.\n\n“Just hearing the positivity coming from him, made me a little bit more positive about the situation,\" Kinney said.\n\nThey've also finally seen a glimpse of Meme's sassy personality.\n\n“She’s the feisty one,” Rodriguez said.\n\n“She’s feisty but she’s got a smile that would save the world,\" said Kinney."
