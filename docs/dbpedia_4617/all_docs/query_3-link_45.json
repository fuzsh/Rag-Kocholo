        "text": "CONFIDENT DAILY MINDSET\n\nA surprisingly effective mind control trick that can help you make more shots and get more playing time, without changing your shooting technique or even picking up a basketball. (As parents, it’s often difficult to know how to motivate our kids to reach their full potential… but players who attend our Day 2 afternoon classroom session and make this small adjustment to their daily mindset have shown huge increases in taking initiative and putting in the work required to improve.)\n\nThis camp is open to male and female players entering 7th - 12th Grade.\n\nWe limit sessions to 64-96 players, depending on gym size, in order to maximize each player's experience. Other camps are often 2-3 times this size, but we don’t take any more players than our camp director can know by name.\n\nOur sessions fill up and we turn away lots of players each fall, so don’t wait to sign up.\n\nDay 1 - Saturday\n\nCamp starts at 2:00pm and ends at 8:00pm.\n\nDay 2 - Sunday\n\nCamp starts at 10:00am and ends at 4:00pm.\n\nEach day includes interactive classroom and video sessions, as well as action-packed gym sessions.\n\nNote: Make sure to bring snacks or lunch each day (meals not included). There is a short meal break each day for players to eat a bag lunch/dinner or for parents to drop off food.\n\nAt many camps, the Director is a celebrity athlete or coach who lends his or her name to the program — but little else.\n\nAt PGC camps, the Director personally leads every session and takes the time to know every player by name.\n\nOur team of Instructors will be there to inspire and support your child through every session. Our Instructors are typically PGC grads who have played college basketball and coach high school or college basketball.\n\n\"I have worked with some great teachers of the game, however, this week at PGC, I observed the best teacher I've ever seen. The sessions were powerful, purposeful, and efficient. Not a session went by where I wasn't thrilled with the content and delivery. I can't tell you how impressed I am with PGC.\"\n\n— Coach Dave Jankowski, La Palma, California\n\nJoin over 10,000 coaches who have attended a PGC course. Coaches consistently tell us the time they spent at PGC is the most beneficial investment they’ve made in their coaching career.\n\nAt your PGC camp, you’ll attend all classroom, video and court sessions – just like players. You’ll also benefit from daily interactions with the director and other like­-minded coaches through in-session huddles.\n\nIf you're thinking about sending your players to PGC check out our Partner Program to receive special discounts available exclusively for your players.\n\nDo You Have A Guarantee?\n\nYou Bet. In Fact, We Have TWO Guarantees\n\nGuarantee #1 – The PGC Promise\n\nRegister for a PGC camp today. Send your child to PGC for the weekend and after they attend the entire camp, if you don’t feel like they significantly improved in at least one of these 4 main components…\n\nBASKETBALL IQ\n\nMINDSET\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nPLAYMAKING\n\n… then you don’t pay anything. Just contact us anytime this calendar year and you will receive a 100% refund which is an outrageous guarantee, especially as we’ll be absorbing the costs for the weekend\n\nIt’s also a guarantee you won’t find anywhere else in the sports world.\n\nGuarantee #2 – The ‘Dicky D. Downright Crazy Guarantee’\n\nPGC Founder, Dick Devenzio (Dicky D.), was a no-nonsense, no B.S. kind of guy and his basketball camps were no different.\n\nIn honor of Dick’s legacy, we’ve committed to upholding his standard of excellence and the mandate he set for PGC.\n\nAnd to hold ourselves accountable (and so you can hold us accountable), we’re offering you the following guarantee to help ensure we always provide the world class experience Dick would expect.\n\nIf your child attends an entire PGC session and you aren’t completely satisfied with their basketball experience, simply let us know and not only will we refund your entire camp tuition, we will also send you an additional $500 cash to help cover any of your other basketball events or travel related expenses this year, to help further your child’s development.\n\nDo You Have A Guarantee?\n\nYou Bet.

If they're not interested in learning the game, PGC is probably not for them, regardless of how good they are.\n\nPlayers are placed in skill-based groups, so if your child is a less experienced player, they'll be with others who are similar — and if they're one of the top players, they'll be with other top players.\n\nOver 125,000 players and 10,000 coaches have attended a PGC camp over the past 31 years and the feedback is consistent.\n\nPlayers who are eager to learn and get better have a really special experience. A player who thinks they know it all already and isn't interested in getting better doesn't typically enjoy their time with us.\n\nAs long as your son or daughter has a passion for the game and wants to improve, they're going to love their time at PGC.\n\nAs we stand behind the experience we provide, and to remove any risk for you, we are the only camp in the camp industry to offer a 100% Money-Back Guarantee.\n\nIf your child attends an entire PGC session and you aren’t completely satisfied with their basketball experience, simply contact us within this calendar year and not only will we refund your entire camp tuition, we will also send you an additional $500 cash to help cover any of your other basketball events or travel related expenses this year, to help further your child’s development.\n\nBut don’t just take our word on the impact of the PGC experience. Check out what a few PGC grads had to share about their time at PGC:\n\nYou can wait until you know your fall schedule before you register. The only problem is, the session you want to attend may be sold out.\n\nTo make it risk-free for you, we have two Tuition Protection options available when you reserve your spot (see below). In addition, as long as it's at least two weeks prior to your session, you can transfer to another camp without any additional cost.\n\nThings sometimes come up that are unavoidable—we get it. That's why we offer Tuition Protection, so you can have peace-of-mind.\n\nCancellation Policy: If your child can't attend the camp for any reason, including schedule conflicts, last-minute injuries, a concussion, an unexpected illness, or a family emergency, you will receive a 100% credit for camp fees paid that can be applied to a future camp, transferred to a friend, or donated to an underprivileged player. Without tuition protection, camp fees are non-refundable.\n\nIn the unlikely event that PGC has to cancel the camp, 100% of your tuition fees paid will be credited towards a future PGC camp.\n\nWith Tuition Protection: The purchase of tuition protection during registration will give you a full refund if you cancel more than 5 days before your camp and a 100% PGC credit if you cancel within 5 days of camp. ($55)\n\nThe majority of our Fall Shooting College sessions can only accept 64-96 players. Typically, basketball camps are two to three times the size of our sessions, but we don’t take any more players than our course director can know by name.\n\nWith more than 16,000 players registered this year for our summer camps and only 2,500 spots available at our Fall Shooting Colleges we expect we'll have to turn away lots of players this Fall, but we limit enrollment so that we can provide the best experience possible for players and ensure they get up over 500 shots per day.\n\nThe average PGC camp attracts players from 11 different states, as well as a handful of international players. Hundreds of players fly, endure long bus rides, or beg a parent or coach to drive them 10-12 hours to get to PGC. We are constantly amazed at how far some players will travel to attend a session.\n\nRight now, players in North Dakota, Alaska, Lithuania, and New Zealand are coming up with creative ways to get themselves to PGC.\n\nSo, don’t let distance be a deal-breaker for you. Where there’s a will, there's usually a way.\n\n“When we left PGC, we had a 10-hour trip ahead of us, so I thought that Daymon would sleep most of the way home. Although physically exhausted, he was so energized and excited that we talked for over nine hours about his experience at PGC. He said, ‘Dad, this was one of the greatest weeks of my life.’ Last night, I watched him play in open gym and he is already incorporating what he learned into his game. Thanks for the positive impact that you made on our son.”\n\n— Joe Osborn, Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\nSure, they can bring a teammate with them. The more teammates who attend PGC with them, the more games they’re likely to win next season.\n\nHowever, don’t wait to register until they convince some teammates to join them, or you may end up losing your spot in the process.\n\nIf your child only likes to attend camps with people they know, think of this as an ideal opportunity to stretch them out of their comfort zone. Even if their teammates choose not to enroll, they’re going to meet some incredible people—many who they’ll be friends with long after their PGC session.\n\n“Before I came to PGC, I was thinking, “I’m not going to know anyone there!”. But, as it turns out, I was welcomed into an extraordinary environment of athletes, instructors, and directors who made me feel like I was at home.”\n\n— Misha Jones, Manassas Park, Virginia\n\n“What I love most about PGC is the attitude and approach of everyone around me. I have never been surrounded by such great, driven, and positive people. It just shows what kind of athletes PGC attracts.”\n\n— Jacquie Chataway, Mississauga, Ontario\n\nWhat exactly are they doing that’s keeping them so busy? Are their activities aligned with their dreams and aspirations, or are they just following the crowd and hoping for the best? Great players don’t base their games—or their lives—on hope. And, they certainly don’t follow the masses. First, they decide what they want; then they go out and find the people and learning opportunities that will get them there.\n\nWhat good is it to be seen by hundreds of college coaches at AAU events if they’re not doing anything special to stand out from the crowd? A good college coach can pick out the best players on the court within the first five minutes of a game. Sometimes, they can even spot the best players during warm-ups, just by noticing how they carry themselves and interact with others.\n\nSmart players spend more time “getting better” than “getting seen.”"
