Therefore, before you can attend and be certified as a NRA Rifle and Shotgun instructor, you MUST already have taken and passed NRA Basic Rifle and Shotgun classes. The BSA and NRA offer these courses at discounted prices across the country or you can attend any commercial NRA Basic Rifle and Shotgun classes. To find a Basic Rifle and/or Shotgun course in your area, please visit: www.nrainstructors.org .\n\nOnce completed you will need to bring proof of completion with you to the instructor course. You will also need to bring your student materials with you to the course.\n\nThe instructor course will ask you to be able to follow a syllabus and instruct materials during the class. The materials will be sent to from the NRA training counselor prior to the course. You will need to have access to use the digital files during your instructor course, so it is recommended that you bring a laptop computer or tablet with you to the course."
