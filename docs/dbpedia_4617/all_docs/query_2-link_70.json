        "text": "STARK COUNTY, Ohio (WOIO) - Two people have been charged in connection to a shooting that took the life of his biological son in Stark County, according to investigators.\n\nStark County Sheriff’s Deputies say they arrived at the Knights Inn Motel, located at 3950 Convenience Dr. in Plain Township around 1 a.m. for the shooting.\n\nDeputies say they found the 7-year-old boy shot inside the motel room.\n\nDeputies say the Plain Township Fire Department transported the child to Cleveland Clinic Mercy Hospital, where the boy died from his injuries.\n\nDeputies say they identified the suspect as William Dolch, 37, of Akron, and he is the victim’s biological father.\n\nDolch was arrested Friday afternoon in Canton at a drug house in the 2700 block of 8th Street NW, U.S. Marshals officials confirmed. He faces reckless homicide, endangering children, and tampering with evidence charges.\n\nHe previously was charged with weapons under disability.\n\nThe Stark County Sheriff’s Office released a statement Friday afternoon saying a second person has been charged in connection to the boy’s death.\n\nOfficials say 29-year-old Brittany Franko has been charged with complicity to commit reckless homicide, endangering children, and obstructing official business. Franko is the girlfriend of Dolch, according to police.\n\nThe sheriff said they believe Franko was trying to help Dolch cover up the crime.\n\nDeputies say five people, two adults and three children, were inside the motel room at the time of the shooting.\n\n“Every loss of life is a profound tragedy, and it is particularly difficult when a child is involved,” said Stark County Sheriff George T. Maier. “Our deepest sympathies are with the family and the entire community. Such incidents weigh heavily on everyone including our first responders.”\n\nAccording to the complaint filed in the Canton Municipal Court, Dolch was previously convicted on a third-degree felonious drug trafficking charge out of Medina.\n\nMedina County Court records say he pleaded guilty in 2007 to the charge.\n\nA sheriff’s office spokesperson says the shooting remains under investigation.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Stark County Sheriff’s Office Detective Bureau at 330-430-3800 ext. 0.\n\nThis is a developing story.
