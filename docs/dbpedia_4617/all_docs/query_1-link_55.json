        "text": "School shootings—terrifying to students, educators, parents, and communities—always reignite polarizing debates about gun rights and school safety. To bring context to these debates, Education Week journalists began tracking shootings on K-12 school property that resulted in firearm-related injuries or deaths.\n\nIn 2023, we continued this heartbreaking, but important work. More information about this tracker and our methodology is below.\n\nThere were 38 school shootings in 2023 that resulted in injuries or deaths, according to an Education Week analysis. There were 51 school shootings with injuries or deaths in 2022, the most in a single year since Education Week began tracking such incidents in 2018. There were 35 in 2021, 10 in 2020, and 24 each in 2019 and 2018.\n\nInjuries & Deaths\n\nWhere the Shootings Happened\n\nThe size of the dots correlates to the number of people killed or injured. Click on each dot for more information.\n\nAbout the Shootings\n\nClick on the column names to sort the data.\n\nContact Information\n\nFor media or research inquiries about this data, contact library@educationweek.org.\n\nAbout This Tracker\n\nIn the emotionally charged aftermath of school shootings, politicians, activists, news media, and ordinary citizens often cite statistics that can present a distorted view of how many of these incidents occur. Those statistics are used to fuel ongoing debates about gun control, arming teachers, and school security.\n\nWith this tracker, Education Week aims to provide a clear accounting of K-12 school shootings. There is no single right way of calculating numbers like this, and the human toll in the immediate aftermath and long term is impossible to measure. We hope to provide reliable information to help inform discussions, debates, and solutions.\n\nMethodology\n\nCounting Incidents\n\nThis page refers to incidents that meet all the following criteria:\n\nwhere a firearm was discharged,\n\nwhere any individual, other than the suspect or perpetrator, has a bullet wound resulting from the incident,\n\nthat happen on K-12 school property or on a school bus, and\n\nthat occur while school is in session or during a school-sponsored event.\n\nWe do not track incidents in which the only shots fired were from an individual authorized to carry a gun on school property, such as a school resource officer, and who did so in their official capacity.\n\nThe numbers of incidents, injuries, and deaths reported in this tracker do not include suicides or self-inflicted injuries. While suicides and attempted suicides are serious issues of health and safety, many of the critical questions and debates that those incidents raise for educators and the broader public are often distinct from those generated by school shootings. Incidents may be added out of sequence as it can take time for verification.\n\nCounting Injuries & Deaths\n\nInjuries included in this tracker may be major or minor. While we only track incidents resulting in at least one bullet wound, total injuries are not necessarily the result of gunfire.\n\nThe total number of people killed or injured does not include the suspect or perpetrator.\n\nSources\n\nIn addition to our own reporting, we rely on local news outlets, school and district websites, news alerts via online search engines, the Gun Violence Archive, David Riedman’s K-12 School Shooting Database, and the Center for Homeland Defense and Security’s Naval Postgraduate School’s K-12 School Shooting database.\n\nHow to Cite This Page"
