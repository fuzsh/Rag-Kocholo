        "text": "PORT ORANGE, Fla. – A Florida man has turned himself in after Port Orange police announced he was wanted, accused of selling the firearm used in the shooting of a 13-year-old boy last month.\n\nSkylar Snyder, 18, turned himself in Thursday morning at the Volusia County Branch Jail, the Port Orange Police Department said on social media.\n\nThe shooting happened off Creekwater Boulevard on July 27. According to investigators, the shooting appeared to be an accident.\n\nFollowing the shooting, the boy’s family said he had no feelings in his legs and may never walk again.\n\nIn the aftermath, investigators discovered that Snyder had sold two firearms to the minors involved in the shooting, one of which was used in the shooting of the 13-year-old, a police news release states.\n\nIn addition, four separate firearms were recovered from other minors unrelated to the shooting, investigators added. Three of those guns had been reported stolen.\n\nAs a result, a warrant was issued for Snyder’s arrest on charges of dealing in stolen property and two counts of selling a firearm to a minor."
