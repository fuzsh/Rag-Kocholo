        "text": "A Michigan community continues to mourn two years after four teenagers were fatally shot by a fellow student at their high school.\n\nThe shooting took place at Oxford High School on Nov. 30, 2021 and left four dead and seven others injured. The shooter, Ethan Crumbley, who is now 17, was a 15-year-old sophomore at the schoo at the time of the shooting.\n\nIn October 2022, he pleaded guilty to 24 charges, including one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of assault with intent to murder and 12 counts of possession of a firearm.\n\nCrumbley will be sentenced in Oakland County court on Dec. 8, according to the Associated Press. A judge reportedly ruled in September that he could face life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nPolice said the gun used in the massacre was purchased by the gunman's father just four days prior to the violence. In December 2021, Ethan's parents James and Jennifer Crumbley pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nAccording to court documents, on Nov. 29, 2022, the Michigan Supreme Court temporarily halted James and Jennifer's trials over \"whether there was sufficient evidence of causation to bind\" the defendants on the charges.\n\nOn the two-year anniversary of the mass shooting, here's what we've learned about the victims:\n\nMadiyson Baldwin, 17\n\nMadiyson Baldwin was a senior who was looking ahead to graduation, according to local news outlet ClickOnDetroit. The 17-year-old was a member of the National Honor Society and had already received multiple college acceptances, including some offers for full scholarships.\n\nBaldwin's family said she was an artist who enjoyed drawing, reading and writing, the outlet reported.\n\n\"She had so much going for her and it was taken away and what I received was a box of 12 years of her accomplishments,\" Madiyson's mom said in June 2022, per WILX-TV. \"Twelve years of waiting for her to walk across that stage. Twelve years of wishing she would have all the opportunities she deserved. And they were ripped away from me — from the world — because she was going to do great things.\"\n\nTate Myre, 16\n\nTate Myre was a linebacker and tight end on the Oxford football team.\n\nThe 16-year-old died in a patrol car while being transported to the hospital by an officer, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard confirmed.\n\nSpeaking with WXYZ-TV on the one-year anniversary of the shooting, Tate's parents said despite the time that's passed, the loss of their son hasn't gotten any easier.\n\n\"It's a battle. It's harder on the family than I thought it would ever be,\" Buck and Sheri Tate told the outlet. \"I'm still sad every day. I still cry every day.\"\n\nThe family has launched the 42 Strong Foundation, an organization that offers peer-to-peer mentorship and a nod to his football jersey number, according to the station.\n\nJustin Shilling, 17\n\nJustin Shilling was the fourth victim of the mass shooting. He succumbed to his injuries on Dec. 1, 2021, leaving his family reeling.\n\nIn July 2022, Justin's mom Jill Soave told WJBK-TV, \"You don't get over something like this. I have to let go of a five-year plan, a 10-year plan, things of that nature.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I have to make sure everyone is okay in the moment. Are we happy, are we healthy, are we fed is their love, and we are good.\"\n\nJustin co-captained the school's bowling team and worked at a restaurant called Anita's Kitchen.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, the restaurant wrote on Facebook, in part, \"Justin was an exemplary employee, a devoted friend and co-worker, co-captain of his bowling team, and simply a pleasure to be around. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.\"\n\nHana St. Juliana, 14\n\nHana St. Juliana was a freshman and a beloved sister.\n\n\"I feel like I wake up every morning kind of figuring out who I am now without Hana,\" her sister Reina St. Juliana told Michigan Radio on Nov. 28, 2022, two days before the one-year anniversary of the shooting. \"I think each day is different, and again, it's like nothing is normal.\"\n\nHana was also a star student athlete. On X (formerly Twitter), Hana's basketball teammates shared a touching tribute and a photo collage of the teen."
