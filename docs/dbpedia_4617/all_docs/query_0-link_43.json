        "text": "Police believe a 3-year-old girl shot and wounded herself Tuesday in Montgomery County, Maryland. Details about her injury were not immediately known, but police said it did not appear to be life-threatening.\n\nPolice were called to the shooting about 11:30 a.m. at an apartment in the 19700 block of Walkers Choice Road in Montgomery Village. The little girl was taken to a hospital.\n\nIt's not yet known how she got the gun, but Montgomery County police said they detained three adults in the home where the shooting happened.\n\nAuthorities said the three adults were in the apartment when the first responding officers arrived. It was not clear if any of them live in that apartment.\n\nAfter waiting for more than three hours, Montgomery County detectives and crime scene investigators received a search warrant and entered the apartment. After the search began, Montgomery County animal control officers were called to the scene. They removed what appeared to be three cats from the apartment.\n\nLots of children live in the apartment complex. One mom told News4 she wishes people would make it more of a priority to keep weapons away from kids by using a gun safe or other means.\n\nLocal\n\nWashington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia local news, events and information\n\nMontgomery County police also stressed the importance of keeping guns away from children.\n\nThis is the second time in less than 48 hours that a young child gained access to a gun and shot herself in the D.C. area. Late Sunday, a 4-year-old girl shot and wounded herself in Cheverly, Maryland. Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the gun used in that shooting."
