Prince George’s County police announced the charges on Thursday.\n\nMozee, of District Heights, was 33.\n\nPolice say the two men knew each other and the preliminary motive for why Meniefield opened fire is that the two had a dispute.

Mozee and the 5-year-old were both shot and were rushed to hospitals.\n\nMozee was pronounced dead. The child suffered an injury that police described as non-life-threatening. Police did not say whether Mozee was related to the child.\n\nNews4 sends breaking news stories by email.
