        "text": "About\n\nYouth Shooting Sports aims to bring the joy of the outdoors and the rewards of safely learning to shoot to young Arkansans. Have you ever considered competing in the Olympics or a national shooting championship? This program from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission could be a start.\n\nYouth Shooting Sports has two divisions: junior and senior. The junior division is for grades 5-8 and the senior division is for grades 9-12. Home-schooled students compete in the division they would be in if they were in public school. Home-schooled students 15 or older must compete in the senior division. Trap shooting is the sanctioned sport of Youth Shooting Sports. The season begins February 1.\n\nAny type of shotgun action is allowed, as long as the bore is 12 or 20 gauge. Release triggers and exposed hammers are not allowed. Trap machines that throw targets at unknown angles are used. The state coordinator may specify models of trap machines for Youth Shooting Sports events. All shooters and coaches must wear appropriate eye and ear protection.\n\nTeam Terms\n\nEach participant must be on a team. Teams commonly represent schools, 4-H Clubs, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, church youth groups and other organizations, although anyone may form a group. Each team must have a coach and must meet these requirements:\n\nA team must have at least five members.\n\nTeams shoot in squads of five members.\n\nA team may field as many squads as it can fill.\n\nParticipants must take part in at least five team practices.\n\nPractices must be held on different days.\n\nRegional and state competitions do not count as practice.\n\nEach participant must shoot at least 25 targets at each practice.\n\nEach team must register with the Youth Shooting Sports state coordinator.\n\nA shoot is a competition between at least two teams. A regional meet is a competition among shooting squads from a geographic area that are trying to qualify for the state championship.\n\nOnly registered Youth Shooting Sports participants are allowed to compete and practice. All teams must be registered by March 1. Only coaches may register teams. Click on the link below to register.\n\nClick here to register online. First time users will enter their AGFC Coach ID Number and Last Name. Returning users will enter their Username and Password.\n\nCoach Info and Team Registration\n\nCoaches must be 21 to apply and must be certified by AGFC to participate in the program. Contact the YSS program coordinator to learn more. Program forms including Practice Log, Shotgun Checkout, Tournament Score Sheet, Trap Machine Checkout and Trap Machine Grant Application can be found under the Documents tab.\n\nThe Coach Application, Background Check and Volunteer Background Check Forms must be completed and mailed to the YSS Coordinator when applying for an YSS coach position. Be sure to have both background check forms notarized before their return. An Arkansas State Police background check will be run on every applicant who is not an active Hunter Education Instructor on file with the AGFC.\n\nNew Coach Training\n\nYouth Shooting Sports Training Manual for Coaches\n\nActive Coaches\n\nOnline Registration (certified coaches only)"
