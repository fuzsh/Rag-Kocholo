        "text": "Thank you for reading D.C. Witness. Help us continue our mission into 2024.\n\nDonate Now\n\nBy Birchard Allen IV\n\nCourt | Daily Stories | Homicides | Shooting | Suspects | Victims |\n\nParties delivered opening statements in a homicide the defendant says was self-defense before DC Superior Court Judge Anthony Epstein’s courtroom on Aug. 6.\n\nJason Lewis, 42, is charged with second-degree murder while armed, two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and three counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence for his alleged involvement in the fatal shooting of 13-year-old Karon Blake on Jan. 7, 2023. The incident occurred on the 1000 block of Quincy Street, NE.\n\n“Please no! I’m a kid! I’m only 13!,” prosecutors claim Blake said as he suffered a bullet wound to his right side torso area, and another to his hip.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Lewis heard noise outside of his house when he was about to go to bed, grabbed his .40 caliber gun and went to see what was going on. Prosecutors say surveillance footage will prove that Lewis shot at Blake and another young individual, ultimately causing Blake’s death.\n\nThe security footage from a PNC bank and a dentist’s office down the street allegedly shows two young people get out of a gray Kia and break into several cars, one of which was Lewis’ gray Audi.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, a person identified as Lewis is seen coming out of his house shooting at one of the individuals running back to the Kia. Blake, prosecutors say, stayed still standing behind Lewis’ car for several moments, before running directly towards Lewis as he fired.\n\nHowever, the defense believes Lewis’ actions were justified.\n\n“Jason was defending his life and his family,” Julie Swaney, Lewis’ attorney, stated, adding that Lewis has a wife and four children.\n\nSwaney claimed Lewis heard someone trying to break into his house, and was shot at by two people from a car, before shooting back. She argued this incident arose out of self-defense.\n\nAccording to Swaney, Blake ran at Lewis in a threatening manner, which led to Lewis shooting and killing the 13-year-old.\n\nThe prosecution called on a Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) officer who responded to the scene seconds after the incident occurred. Body-camera footage, shown in court, depicts the officer walking up to the residence as Lewis was rendering aid to Blake.\n\nThe officer stated Blake was, “Dead. Wasn’t breathing, no life. He was gone.” According to the officer, he did not find any weapons on Blake’s body when he searched it at the scene.\n\nThe officer testified that Blake was taken to the hospital but could not be revived.\n\nAccording to the officer, when he talked to Lewis at the scene, he didn’t say other individuals were involved or shots were fired at him. However, the officer testified, Lewis did tell him about a nearby but did not give a precise description.\n\nThe officer also testified that Lewis told him Blake ran at him in a threatening manner leading to the shooting. He was able to provide MPD with his home’s security footage.\n\nParties are set to return Aug.7.\n\nFollow this case"
