        "text": "HOUSTON – A family in NE Houston is mourning the loss of two children—one killed accidentally, police say, and the other so distraught, he took his own life Wednesday night.\n\nHere is how everything unfolded, according to police:\n\nA 17-year-old was in an apartment on Arto St. near Hardy St. with three other children who were all relatives. The youngest was 10. The children’s parents were in the living room at the time of the incident and were not aware that the 17-year-old was handling a gun.\n\nThe 17-year-old pulled out a gun to show his siblings.\n\nOne of the younger children pulled the trigger, hitting and killing an 11-year-old boy.\n\nDistraught, the 17-year-old ran outside into a wooded area with the gun. Family members told police they tried to calm him down, but the teen shot himself. He later died at a local hospital.\n\n“It’s a very tragic scene tonight for this family,” said Assistant Chief Keith Seafous. “Our condolences go out to the family.”\n\nSeafous said the family was cooperating with the investigation and police were trying to figure out late Wednesday if the gun was inside the home or if the teen got it somewhere else."
