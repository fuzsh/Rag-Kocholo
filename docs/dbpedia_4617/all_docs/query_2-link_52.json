        "text": "Police say an argument between two men in Fort Worth led to a shooting that left 3 people, including 2 children, dead.\n\nOfficers were called to the Crystal Clean Car Wash on Cleburne Road just before midnight on Thursday.\n\nPolice say 26-year-old Kanard Trent Murphy got into an argument with another man. They say at some point he pulled out a gun and started shooting at him.\n\nMurphy was shot at some point but survived, and the other man was killed in the gunfire. Once officers arrived, they found the man lying on the ground. He was taken to the hospital but did not survive.\n\nA 1-year-old girl and a 4-year-old girl were caught in the crossfire and were killed. Family members tell FOX 4 they were sisters.\n\nPolice say besides the three deceased, three other people went to the hospital by private vehicles and have unknown injuries.\n\nMurphy is being treated at the hospital for his gunshot wounds. Police have charged him with capital murder of multiple persons. He will be booked into jail once he's released from the hospital.\n\n\"My heart breaks for the families who are waking up after the 4th of July, a day meant for celebration, to grieve the loss of young lives taken from senseless crime,\" said Fort Worth Chief of Police Neil Noakes. \"We share in their grief and remain committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our community.\"\n\nPolice believe the violence stemmed from an ongoing feud between a man and a woman who were previously in a relationship but did not elaborate further.\n\nThe Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office has not yet released the names of the victims."
