        "text": "DECATUR, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - A Decatur man will spend the rest of his life behind bars after he was convicted for firing into a minivan full of people, permanently injuring a baby and killing a man in August 2020, according to the DeKalb County District Attorney’s Office.\n\nDeonta David, 28, was found guilty of malice murder, five counts of aggravated assault and two counts of cruelty to children.\n\nHe was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nThe DeKalb County District Attorney’s Office said on Aug. 20, 2020, police responded to Flat Shoals Road around 7 p.m. after a 911 call reporting multiple people were shot in a minivan.\n\nPolice found 25-year-old Diante Harring unresponsive in the van. They also found that Harring’s brother was shot in the arm, a 10-year-old boy was shot in the chest and a 7-month-old boy was shot in the foot, the district attorney’s office said.\n\nParamedics took them to the hospital where Harring died. The 10-year-old boy and the brother recovered and the baby permanently lost a toe, according to the district attorney’s office.\n\nInvestigators discovered that the people in the minivan were visiting Atlanta from New York. The district attorney’s office said Harring had planned to meet up with David to buy marijuana from him at an apartment complex on Columbia Drive.\n\nOnce they arrived at the complex, David shot the vehicle with an AR-15 rifle and another person with him shot into the minivan with a handgun, the district attorney’s office said.\n\nAlong with life, David was also sentenced to 85 years."
