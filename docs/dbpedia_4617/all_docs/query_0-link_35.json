        "text": "A 17-year-old boy was fatally shot in a home at the corner 11th and South streets Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe teen, whose name hasn't been released, was shot multiple times, said Springfield Police Deputy Chief Sara Pickford Monday morning.\n\nThe teen was taken to HSHS St. Johnâ€™s Hospital by ambulance for treatment but did not survive.\n\nIt is the sixth homicide in Springfield for 2024.\n\nPickford said she believed the teen lived at the home. There were multiple people inside of the home at the time of the shooting.\n\nPickford said detectives \"are running a lot of things down\" regarding a suspect. There have been Crime Stoppers tips about the shooting already, she said.\n\nThe call, she said, came in to 911.\n\nPickford said it was too early to speculate on a motive.\n\nAnyone with information about this shooting is asked to call the Springfield Police at 217-788-8311 and/or Sangamon/Menard County Crime Stoppers at 217-788-8427.\n\nContact Steven Spearie: 217-622-1788; sspearie@sj-r.com; X, twitter.com/@StevenSpearie."
