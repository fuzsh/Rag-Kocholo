        "text": "FLINT, MI – Twenty years ago, a boy walked up to a girl inside a Flint-area elementary school, pulled a gun from his waistband and became one of the youngest killers in history.\n\nWitnesses recall hearing a sound like a balloon popping, which wouldn’t have been too unusual in an elementary school.\n\nBut it wasn’t a balloon. It was a gunshot.\n\nKayla Rolland was left dead and a nation was left reeling with how a 6-year-old could shoot and kill another 6-year old.\n\nThe incident at Buell Elementary School in the Beecher School District on Feb. 29, 2000 prompted President Bill Clinton to push for stricter federal gun laws, an effort that failed to gain traction in Congress. Advocates on both sides of the gun debate have fought bitterly in the following two decades as school shootings have become more frequent and resulted in more deaths.\n\nKayla’s death was at the center of America’s raging gun debate for many years that followed. That debate still has not been resolved.\n\nIt all started with a little girl getting ready for school that day in Beecher, Michigan.\n\nFirst-grader Kayla Rolland was fatally shot at school 20 years ago. Here’s how it happened.\n\nKAYLA\n\nElizabeth Krasinski realized it was going to be a hard start to that Tuesday morning.\n\nHer sister Kayla, a 6-year-old first-grader at Buell Elementary, just north of Flint in Mt. Morris Township, didn’t want to get out of bed, didn’t want her hair brushed and didn’t want to go to school.\n\nTheir mother had been at work since 4 a.m., soldering memory boards for a company in the Pontiac area, and the kids were on their own.\n\n“I remember that morning … I was so angry with her because she was a kid who didn’t want to go to school, and I had the responsibility of doing the ‘mom thing’ because I was the oldest,” remembered Krasinski, who was 11 at the time.\n\nKayla was a girl who didn’t play with dolls.\n\n“That wasn’t my sister. She was full of spunk. She would go out and get muddy. She was a tomboy. She loved being covered in dirt.\n\n“She was the baby, and she could get away with anything,” Krasinski said of her brown-haired sister. “All she had to do was give you that smile.”\n\nThat morning, the struggle went on as the sisters and their brother left the little house where they stayed on Princeton Avenue and walked a few blocks toward Buell and Summit Middle School -- each going their separate ways.\n\n“I told her I hated her,” said Krasinski, now a 31-year-old mother with four children of her own. “The last thing I remember telling her was, ‘I hate you.’ That (became) a life lesson. I tell my kids now -- we do not use that word in this house.”\n\nKrasinski never saw her sister, Kayla Rolland, alive again.\n\nTHE BOY\n\nWhile Krasinski described her family as poor, “barely making ends meet,” at the time Kayla was killed, the boy who shot her was in an even more precarious situation.\n\nThe Flint Journal never named the boy because he was a juvenile and never charged with a crime.\n\nTwenty years ago, the boy was staying in a house with tattered curtains and garbage bags taped over broken windows, staying with his older brother, also a Buell student, because their mother, Tamarla Owens, had been evicted from another home in the township about two weeks earlier.\n\nPolice and prosecutors said drugs and guns were common in the house. During a court hearing after the shooting, the boy demonstrated to a Genesee District Court judge how he had seen Jamelle James, another man who stayed there, play with the gun, twirling it in his hands.\n\nAn uncle also lived in the house on West Julia Avenue, and the boy’s father Dedric Owens, who died in 2007, was in the Genesee County Jail at the time.\n\n“That little boy … didn’t treat that gun any different than a toy,” said former Genesee County Prosecutor Art Busch, now retired and living in Florida. “I think he might have” treated it that way because he didn’t have another toy in the house.\n\nThe gun that killed Kayla on Feb. 29, 2000, a .32-caliber semiautomatic handgun, was reported stolen from a home in Flint just a few months earlier. James would later be convicted of involuntary manslaughter for having made the gun available to the boy.\n\nThe gun ended up with loose change and candy in a Puma shoebox.\n\nOn the day he shot Kayla, the boy walked to Buell with his brother, telling him he had the pistol. According to a lawsuit that was later filed against the Beecher School District, the weapon was protruding from the boy’s pants when he arrived tardy in the first-grade classroom of teacher Alicia Judd that morning.\n\nTHE SHOOTING\n\nJudd was lining up students in the hallway when she heard what she later said sounded like a balloon popping.\n\nWhen she walked back into the classroom to see what the sound was, the remaining students told their teacher that a boy had shot Kayla, who was standing in front of a mirror looking at herself.\n\nJudd ran to the school office and told them to call police before running back to the classroom where Kayla had fallen over.\n\nOne student later told police the boy pointed the pistol at Kayla and said, “I don’t like you,” then pulled the trigger. Kayla stood up and said, ‘I’m going to die’” before falling over, the girl recounted.\n\nAnother student recalled the shooter said, ‘Hey, Kayla, look,’” and then fired the pistol.\n\nWhen Judd ran back to her classroom, she found Kayla on the floor with the bullet wound to her chest.\n\nShe used her cell phone to call 911 at 9:53 a.m.\n\n“I have a student at Buell school that has been dying. I need an ambulance immediately,” Judd told the emergency dispatcher, her breath uneven and sentences broken.\n\nIn the office of the building, a school secretary surrounded by first-graders also called 911 and reported, “I have a child that was shot in the classroom.”\n\nJudd used cardiopulmonary resuscitation after telling the dispatcher Kayla was going into convulsions, trying to get air.\n\nThe teacher found a pulse after giving Kayla two breaths, but the little girl was not breathing normally. As her breathing worsened, Judd told the dispatcher that she had lost the pulse and that “her eyes are rolling back in her head.”\n\nTHE HOSPITAL\n\nJust before 9:59 a.m., paramedics arrived in the classroom and continued efforts to save Kayla’s life before transporting her the 4.4 miles to Hurley Medical Center where a team of doctors and nurses waited.\n\n“I remember that day … I remember the call coming across the HERN (Hospital Emergency Radio Network),” said Dr. Michael Jaggi, who was working in the emergency room that morning.\n\nJaggi is currently vice president and chief medical officer at the hospital.\n\n“It came in as a 6-year-old shot. I remember everybody questioning the age – did they say 60 or did they say 6?,” Jaggi said. “That team huddled and was ready to go all out, but we got a lifeless little girl” when Kayla arrived.\n\n“There were no heroics, no life-saving procedures. It was just disbelief and shock to have this tiny little person with this gunshot wound,” the doctor said.\n\nThe bullet had entered Kayla’s right shoulder before tearing through her chest.\n\nKayla was pronounced dead at Hurley Medical Center, the same hospital where she was born.\n\nHer death certificate describes her occupation as elementary school student and lists her cause of death at 10:29 a.m. as a gunshot wound to the chest. In a section of the form for describing how the injury occurred, the doctor completing the death certificate wrote, “Shot by a student.”\n\nTHE FAMILY\n\nAt Summit Middle School, Elizabeth had been called to the office from history class with no explanation after the shooting that morning.\n\n“I grabbed my coat and went to the office,” where a woman who worked for Beecher drove to Buell without saying what was happening, Elizabeth said. “I remember us being stopped by a cop, and she said, ‘This is her sister,’ and they let us through.\n\n“My brother was sitting there. We were trying to figure out why we were at the principal’s office,” she said. “They took us to a conference room and gave us graham cracker snacks and juice. My mom finally showed up at school and we drove to the hospital.\n\n“My mom pulled us aside and explained Kayla had been shot, and she didn’t make it. She said, ‘She’s gone,’ “ Elizabeth remembered.\n\nBefore they left the hospital, Elizabeth was allowed to see her sister one more time.\n\n“I remember she was blue, and I remember telling her she was playing a game (and to) wake up. It’s just a game,” she said.\n\nTHE LAW\n\nThat same morning, former prosecutor Busch had just been discharged from McLaren-Flint hospital with a case of pneumonia when he received a call from Eric King, the police chief of Mt. Morris Township.\n\nKing told Busch there had been a shooting at the school and it didn’t look good.\n\n“I couldn’t understand what he was saying …” said Busch. “It was beyond my comprehension. At that time, it put me in a state of shock for a minute.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of bad stuff in my lifetime,” he said, “but I had no experience to relate back to something like that. I had young kids of my own, and I just couldn’t fathom it happening.”\n\nAlthough police had taken the boy into custody within minutes of the shooting, had the murder weapon and a confession within hours, Busch was left with the decision about how to proceed.\n\nPolice said the boy played with a typewriter and drew pictures after they brought him to the station.\n\nAfter counting from one to 10 to show a detective he could, the boy first told police Kayla was shot by another classmate.\n\nBut after eating a McDonald’s Happy Meal and answering more questions, he told the detective he accidentally shot Kayla with the gun he found in his uncle’s house.\n\nTHE MAN\n\nThe boy, now 26, could not be reached for comment on this story. MLive-The Flint Journal knocked on the doors of three residences listed in the Flint area associated with the man but could not reach him.\n\nA television crew from Grand Rapids-based WOOD TV recently tracked the man down at a Bay City apartment complex, but the 26-year-old man declined to comment.\n\nCourt records describe the boy’s tumultuous life, including child abuse at the hands of his mother when he was young, to a felony conviction when he was older.\n\nThe juvenile court records track his life through periodic court appearances after his mother and father lost their parental rights for keeping their children in a place unfit for children.\n\nEight months after the shooting, Tamarla Owens admitted that she held her older son down so that he could be beaten with a belt by two male friends, court records show. The boy who shot Kayla told protective services he saw his mother tape the brother’s hands, feet and mouth before a beating.\n\nAll three children were placed in the foster care system. The boy was enrolled in public schools and earning passing grades by 2010.\n\nBy 2011, the boy was receiving a stipend from the state for rent, registered for driver’s education and seeking employment. The court terminated its jurisdiction because the boy was 18.\n\n“(The boy) has been evicted and is ineligible for additional emergency funds,” court records say. \"(He) has been charged with a felony crime in Bay City … He is not in compliance with the terms of the independent living program.”\n\nCourt records show the 26-year-old was charged with second-degree home invasion and larceny in a building stemming from an April 23, 2012, incident at a Bay City house. Two others were charged as co-defendants. They allegedly stole shoes, a laptop and an iPod, records show. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was sentenced to two years of probation.\n\nTamarla Owens declined an invitation to be interviewed by MLive-The Flint Journal, but did respond with a statement.\n\n“I have moved on, so please tell him we are all doing fine as a family again,” she said in a written statement through her former attorney Mark Clement.\n\nAFTERMATH\n\nBusch did not prosecute Owens’ son, saying he was too young to understand what he had done.\n\n“I met that little kid,” he said. “He had no front teeth. He was coloring and talking about the Easter Bunny. This kid wasn’t born to be a killer.”\n\nThe prosecutor did charge James, who spent two-and-a-half years in prison after pleading no contest to involuntary manslaughter.\n\nTamarla Owens, who was charged with child neglect after the shooting, eventually saw that case against her dismissed.\n\n“They called her the worst mother in America,” said Clement, who represented Owens in the case. “None of that was true … She worked two jobs (trying to keep her family together). That’s a far cry from being a bad mother. There was nothing about her that was bad.”\n\nKayla’s mother, Veronica Lafayette, died in 2016 at age 46 of acetaminophen toxicity, according to her certificate of death.\n\nInvited to the White House, she participated in the Million Mom March, which focused on the push for stricter gun control, but later lost custody of her two surviving children after a judge ruled she had failed to protect them.\n\nShe sued the Beecher Community School District, claiming officials there knew the boy who shot Kayla was a threat and that at least one teacher knew he brought a gun to school. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying the district and teachers were not at fault.\n\nJ. Dallas Winegarden, an attorney who represented Lafayette in the Beecher lawsuit, said he was “never more devastated” than when the case against the school district failed.\n\n“I’ve never been so disappointed in the judicial system,” said Winegarden, now an adjunct professor in the College of Law at Michigan State University.\n\nWinegarden said he wanted to establish that school officials had a duty to protect children in their custody.\n\n“Life was a struggle for the family, and they were devastated by this – totally devastated,” he said. “But I felt like I didn’t just lose the case for the family. I lost the case in my mind for every kid who was left unprotected.”\n\nKayla Rolland shooting shocked the nation, but also brought people together\n\n‘HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO GET KILLED?’\n\nSchool shootings have been on the rise in the two decades since Kayla Rolland’s death.\n\nAccording to the FBI reports, there have been at least 39 active shooter incident at pre-K through high school grounds from 2000-2018, but those numbers exclude certain years (2014-2015 and 2019) when reports were not issued by the agency. The FBI defines active shooter incidents as those in which “an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.” The school shootings include high-profile incidents like Parkland and Sandy Hook, and resulted in 69 deaths and 133 injuries.\n\nKayla Rolland remains one of the youngest school shooting victims in the nation’s history.\n\nHer death, which happened less than a year after the mass shooting at Columbine High School, touched a nerve across the country, putting a national spotlight on the Flint area, partly because of the young age of both Kayla and the boy who shot her.\n\nA photograph of Kayla, wearing a Winnie the Pooh shirt, ran on the cover of Newsweek magazine under the headline: “Murder in the First Grade.”\n\nFlint native Michael Moore cited Kayla’s death in his film, “Bowling for Columbine,” making the case for stricter gun control, and the filmmaker attempted to deliver her photo to actor Charlton Heston, who was then the president of the National Rifle Association.\n\nShe also became a symbol in a revived push for gun control by President Clinton, who met Lafayette and promised her: “As president, I’m going to do everything I can to see that it doesn’t happen to other children.”\n\nWhen Clinton met with congressional leaders the week after Kayla’s death, he asked the legislators, “How many people have to get killed before we do something?”\n\nBut a year later, Clinton had been replaced by George W. Bush, and legislation that came to be known as Kayla’s Law, including a proposed federal waiting period for firearms purchased at gun shows, had gone nowhere.\n\nTwenty years later, advocates are still waiting to see progress.\n\n“There has not been much progress in Michigan,” said Linda Brundage, executive director of the Michigan Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence, which is pushing for bills before the Michigan Legislature that would create new criminal penalties for failing to store a firearm resulting in injury or death.\n\n“If a child has a gun, they got it from an adult,” Brundage said. “If you’re not using (a gun), it should be locked up (because) most guns that (end up in) schools are obtained from the home.”\n\nTen years after school shooting, community remembers but sees few changes after 6-year-old Kayla Rolland’s death\n\nSISTERS\n\nKayla is buried under a Tuscola County gravestone that recalls her as a beloved daughter never forgotten.\n\nKrasinski was young enough at the time of Kayla’s death that she’s looked back through news stories to understand more clearly everything that happened and what issues and people were involved in the death of her sister.\n\nShe’s thought about trying to reach the boy who shot her sister, “but I never could bring myself to doing it.”\n\nShe did find Judd, the first-grade teacher, after hearing the 911 recording of her call for help 20 years ago and realizing how she fought to save Kayla.\n\n“That hit hard. That hit real hard for me,” Krasinski said. “I wanted to thank her for being there. I wanted to tell her she had a heart of gold.”\n\nShe also has never lost the memory of her sister even though she has just a few personal items to remember her by.\n\n“I have four wonderful kids now. I think of my sister and what kind of aunt would she be to them,” she said. “I have my moments even now. It definitely does not get any easier.”"
