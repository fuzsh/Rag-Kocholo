        "text": "Federal Way Police are investigating a shooting that left a 2-year-old dead.\n\nOfficers responded to a report of a shooting at the IHOP on 178 Southwest Campus Drive before 10 a.m.\n\nMinutes later, police received a call from St. Francis Hospital where a 2-year-old child showed up with a gunshot wound.\n\nThe child was taken to Harborview Medical Center in critical condition. They later died from their injuries.\n\nThe King County Medical Examiner's Office identified the child as Synsyr Lewis. The ME's office said the child was unfortunately shot in the head.\n\nThe family has set up a GoFundMe for the child here.\n\nInvestigators said the child's father and another person were shooting at each other in the parking lot, and it was not a random shooting. Police say the father was returning fire in self-defense.\n\nIt's unknown what led up to the shooting and the investigation remains ongoing.\n\nFederal Way Mayor Jim Ferrell told FOX 13 Seattle:\n\n\"This is a horrific crime, and we will move heaven and earth to find who is responsible. I trust our hardworking and professional police department will track down this culprit and hold them accountable.\"\n\nFeatured\n\nVideo shows second Federal Way shooting\n\nThis was just one of two incidents the city saw in about two hours.\n\nFederal Way police said officers responded to another shooting less than two miles away. That incident happened outside a convenience store on Pacific Highway South.\n\nFOX 13 News obtained surveillance that shows the entire incident. The video shows a man walking out of a convenience store, then pulling a gun out and shooting several people walking on the sidewalk.\n\nPolice reported that a man was hit in the arm during the shooting, but would not cooperate with police at the scene. The victim was taken to Harborview Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nInvestigators believe the two shootings are not related. They have not released any suspect information or announced any arrests.\n\nAnyone who has information about the shooting at IHOP is asked to call the Federal Police Department at 253-835-2121.\n\nMORE FEDERAL WAY NEWS\n\nMassive brawl at Federal Way apartment complex caught on camera, residents hope frequent fighting ends\n\nFederal Way homicide: Police looking for suspect in 68-year-old's death\n\nMan killed, another injured in two related shootings in Federal Way\n\nOvernight Federal Way shooting leaves 1 dead"
