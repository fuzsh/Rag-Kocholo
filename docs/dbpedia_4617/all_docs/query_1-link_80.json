        "text": "They also told the police that they asked their child, who was carrying a red bag, what was inside, Chief Drake said. The shooter’s mother told the police that their question was dismissed, and that she “didn’t think any differently” because she didn’t know about the hidden firearms.\n\nHad the shooter’s intentions “been made known to us, then we would have tried to get those weapons,” Chief Drake said. “But as it stands, we had absolutely no idea actually who this person was.”\n\nChief Drake said the police had not determined a motive for the shooting but stressed that they believed that the school and the church had been a target, not any single person. In documents, which the police and federal investigators are continuing to review, there were also writings about other locations, including a mall in the area, Don Aaron, a spokesman for the police department later said.\n\nThe shooter had a handwritten diagram of the school, along with a drawing of how it could possibly be entered, Mr. Aaron said. There were additional writings found in the car driven to the school and the family’s home, and officials are also examining a cellphone found in the car.\n\nThe assailant was armed with a military-style semiautomatic rifle, one handgun and a small 9-mm carbine — a weapon with a rifle-length barrel and a folding stock so that it can be more easily carried or concealed, Mr. Aaron said.\n\nA six-minute compilation of body camera footage released by the police department on Tuesday shows how police officers raced through the school, past children’s artwork hanging on the walls, searching classrooms and bathrooms before killing the shooter.\n\nChief Drake declined to confirm any additional information about the shooter, who was a former student at the school.\n\nCyrus Vatandoost, the president and chief executive of Nossi College of Art & Design, confirmed in a statement that the shooter had graduated from the college in 2022 and was “a talented artist and a good student.” On a personal website, there were drawings of landscapes, animals and colorful patterns, and in a since-deleted Facebook post, the shooter celebrated a professor’s praise of an art project.\n\nThere was confusion about the gender identity of the assailant in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Chief Drake said the shooter identified as transgender. Officials used “she” and “her” to refer to the shooter, but, according to a social media post and a LinkedIn profile, the shooter appeared to identify as male in recent months.\n\n“Our hearts are completely broken,” Evelyn’s family said in a short statement released on Tuesday. “We cannot believe this has happened.”\n\nAs investigators try to piece together a motive for the attack, the authorities praised the actions of the Nashville police officers who rushed into the school, saying they moved swiftly in pursuing and fatally shooting the assailant.\n\nThe authorities said on Tuesday that the 28-year-old perpetrator had legally purchased seven firearms recently — including the three used in the shooting — and was being treated by a doctor for an emotional disorder. Chief John Drake of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said that the assailant’s parents had felt that their child “should not own weapons” and believed that their child did not.\n\nTennessee does not have what is known as a red flag law that would allow the authorities to temporarily confiscate guns from those found to be in danger to themselves or others, and the Republican-controlled State Legislature has steadily loosened restrictions on owning guns.\n\nStill, Chief Drake said that if the police had known that the perpetrator was suicidal or intended to hurt others, “then we would have tried to get those weapons.”\n\nEven with the uncertainty over what motivated the attack, the magnitude of the loss was clear as relatives, friends and people who knew the victims expressed their grief.\n\nThe other children who were killed were identified as William Kinney and Hallie Scruggs, whose father is the pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church, the church connected to the school. Cynthia Peak, 61, was the substitute teacher killed.\n\nHannah Williams, who knows the Scruggs family, struggled to wrap her head around the trauma that those closest to the victims were now enduring.\n\n“This family did not deserve this,” Ms. Williams wrote on a post on Facebook. “No family does. They deserve to wake up from this nightmare with Hallie by their side.”\n\nIn a video statement on Tuesday evening, Gov. Bill Lee said that Ms. Peak was a close friend of his wife, Maria. “Cindy was supposed to come over to have dinner with Maria last night,” he said. He described the anguish caused by the shooting — “the emptiness, the lack of understanding, the desperate desire for answers, the desperate need for hope,” he said.\n\n“We’re enduring a very difficult moment,” Mr. Lee said. “Everyone is hurting, everyone.”\n\nNashville has weathered turbulence and heartache in recent years. There were floods and a deadly tornado. In 2020, a man consumed by bizarre conspiracy theories detonated a van filled with explosives on Christmas morning, killing himself and severely damaging a swath of downtown.\n\nBut this was different, as it kindled in the city a level of terror that other communities had faced amid recurring mass shootings but Nashville had not. In a post on Twitter not long after the shooting, Mayor John Cooper said, “Nashville joined the dreaded, long list of communities to experience a school shooting.”\n\nThe shooting has reverberated beyond Nashville, too, stoking fury and frustration and invigorating once again the country’s divisions over violence and access to guns. President Biden called for a ban on assault rifles, as he has done after other recent mass shootings — a repetition he acknowledged with a sense of exasperation on Tuesday. “I can’t do anything except plead with the Congress to act reasonably,” he said.\n\nIn Dallas, as worshipers gathered on Tuesday at Park Cities Presbyterian Church, the pain was much more personal. Chad Scruggs, the pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church and Hallie’s father, had been the pastor there before moving to Nashville.\n\n“The reality is, this event in Nashville is not merely an event for one school or one church or city,” said Paul Goebel, an associate pastor at Park Cities Presbyterian. “It touches our church, our community deeply, but it also affects and touches our whole nation.”\n\nMr. Scruggs, who left that congregation in 2018, returned to Dallas in February to preach, pointing out Hallie and her three siblings sitting in the pews. “Their story, in many ways, began here,” he said at the time.\n\nMark Davis, the current pastor at Park Cities Presbyterian, said he spoke to Mr. Scruggs on Monday afternoon; in that conversation, Mr. Scruggs acknowledged that “he’s in shock.” The congregation also had ties to Ms. Peak, the substitute teacher who was killed. Her sister worshiped there. Some who stood to pray for the victims during the vigil on Tuesday referred to Ms. Peak as “Aunt Cindy.”\n\n“We’re here because our hearts are broken,” Pastor Davis told the congregation. “We’re here because we have questions.”\n\nThe Covenant School, which was founded in 2001 as a ministry of the Covenant Presbyterian Church, has about 200 students attending its campus in an affluent area of Nashville, where streets overwhelmed by the city’s rush of development in recent years give way to tree-covered hills.\n\nIt is part of a network of conservative evangelical churches and private schools in Nashville that is tight-knit, even across denominational lines. Some families attended church at one place and school in another. Palmer Williams, whose older son went to the Covenant School for his first several years of school, said she took her children out of the school only because she was involved in founding another school with a similar approach. “We wanted more schools like Covenant,” she said.\n\nDr. Koonce, the head of school since 2016, had previously worked at Christ Presbyterian Academy, a private school just five miles away. There, she nurtured a passion for working with students who had learning disabilities.\n\n“She has always been a woman who is deeply passionate about kids having a love of learning,” said David Thomas, a longtime friend of Dr. Koonce’s and a director of family counseling at Daystar Counseling Ministries in Nashville.\n\nShe tutored Joseph Fisher in math years ago. He’s 34 now but still remembers the way she encouraged him. “She just believed that I have more to give — and I did,” he said. When he learned that she had been killed, Mr. Fisher, now a truck driver, said that he parked and walked up a mountainside, stunned.\n\nMr. Hill, a father of seven and grandfather of 14, liked to cook and spend time with family, his family said in a statement. He was “beloved by the faculty and students who filled him with joy for 14 years,” the statement said.\n\nThe Covenant School had a student-teacher ratio of 8 to 1, and Dr. Koonce was invested in building a nurturing environment for students.\n\nOn the morning of the shooting, students sang “Amazing Grace” in the chapel and practiced saying “jambo” — a traditional Swahili greeting — with a missionary doctor who was visiting the school.\n\n“It was just such a sweet interaction with those kids,” said Dr. Britney Grayson, the visiting doctor, a pediatric surgeon from Kenya. “Everything was normal about our day. It went exactly like we thought it would — better than expected.”\n\nShe left shortly before the shooting, stirring conflicting feelings: She knew she avoided witnessing the shooting, but wondered if she could have been in a position to help.\n\nDr. Grayson said she had operated on children with gunshot wounds before, including one child who was injured in a school shooting in the United States. “It’s like, ‘Why wasn’t I still there?’” she said. “And in the very next breath, you think, ‘Well, I might be dead, too.’ I don’t know that I’ll ever be able to process those conflicting thoughts.”\n\nThe shooting also stirred fears about the lasting consequences it would have for children in the community, particularly those close to the victims.\n\n“They are a family that has impacted more people than they will ever know,” Hannah Williams wrote in a Facebook post about the Scruggs family. “Hallie’s brothers: John Randall, Charlie, and Carter have lost their one and only sister at ages where this trauma will impact their forming brains forever.”\n\nBut there was also hope that the spirit of the school — the sense of closeness and warmth — would endure.\n\nOn Monday night, Palmer Williams’s family joined others at a baseball field, gathering spontaneously to tie ribbons to a chain-link fence. Her son knew William Kinney through a baseball league. The children were running the bases — “grieving the way kids do,” Ms. Williams said, “which is sadness but also just being kids.”\n\nMary Beth Gahan contributed reporting from Dallas. Ruth Graham also contributed reporting. Kirsten Noyes , Susan C. Beachy and Kitty Bennett contributed research.\n\nThe Violence Project, another nonprofit research center dedicated to reducing violence in society, follows a narrower definition established by the Congressional Research Service, in which a shooting results in the deaths of four or more victims. The definition also focuses on public attacks and excludes domestic shootings and those attributable to “underlying criminal activity.” The Violence Project has said that “any cut point is arbitrary, but this remains a widely agreed-upon standard.”\n\nCNN and other news outlets have defined a mass shooting as one with four or more injuries or deaths.\n\nAs of early July, the Gun Violence Archive has counted more than 330 mass shootings in the United States this year.\n\nLast year, the group counted 647 mass shootings. Of those, 21 involved five or more fatalities.\n\nHere is a small slice of the year’s shootings.\n\nJuly 2: Baltimore\n\nTwo people died and at least 28 others were injured in a shooting at a block party in a Baltimore public housing development in the southern neighborhood of Brooklyn. Many of those wounded were teenagers. Police said that the motive remained unclear as they worked to identify the assailants.\n\nMay 29: Hollywood, Fla.\n\nAt least nine people were wounded on the Memorial Day holiday when gunfire erupted between two groups near a beach in Hollywood, Fla., sending beachgoers fleeing or ducking for cover. The victims ranged in age from 1 to 65, a spokeswoman for the Hollywood Police Department said.\n\nMay 6: Allen, Texas\n\nA gunman opened fire at a crowded mall outside Dallas, killing at least eight people and injuring at least seven before a police officer killed him, the authorities said.\n\nMay 3: Atlanta\n\nA gunman opened fire in a waiting room at a medical office building in Midtown Atlanta, killing one and injuring four others. The suspect was apprehended after a manhunt that lasted several hours, the authorities said.\n\nMay 1: Henryetta, Okla.\n\nA registered sex offender fatally shot six people, including his wife and three of her children, before turning the gun on himself at his ranch in Henryetta, a small town south of Tulsa, the authorities said.\n\nApril 28: Cleveland, Texas\n\nA man fatally shot five people after he was asked by a neighbor to stop firing a gun in his yard, the authorities said. The man was found after a dayslong search involving state and federal officers.\n\nApril 15: Dadeville, Ala.\n\nFour people were killed and 32 others were injured in a shooting at a birthday party at a dance studio in the Alabama city, officials said. Days later, the authorities said five people had been charged in connection with the attack.\n\nApril 10: Louisville, Ky.\n\nA 25-year-old man shot and killed five colleagues at the downtown bank where he worked, the police said. Eight others were wounded in the attack. The suspect was killed by the police after exchanging fire with them.\n\nMarch 27: Nashville\n\nA heavily armed assailant shot and killed three children and three adults at a private Christian elementary school. The shooter, who the authorities said was a former student at the school, was shot and killed by the police.\n\nFeb. 19: Memphis\n\nEleven people were shot, one fatally, at two separate crime scenes that the authorities said they believed were connected.\n\nInvestigators said they had identified three people of interest who they believed could be involved in the shootings. Their names were not made public.\n\nFeb. 17: Tate County, Miss.\n\nA 52-year-old man went on a shooting rampage at multiple locations in rural Mississippi, killing six people, including his ex-wife and two siblings who were both in their 70s, the authorities said.\n\nThe gunman, who was taken into custody, began his killing spree at a convenience store in his hometown, Arkabutla, Miss., where he fatally shot a man who appeared to have no connection to him, the police said. Arkabutla is an unincorporated community about 45 miles south of Memphis.\n\nFeb. 13: East Lansing, Mich.\n\nThree students were killed and five others were wounded in shootings at two buildings on the Michigan State University campus.\n\nThe gunman, a 43-year-old man who had no known connection to the university, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the police said.\n\nFeb. 1: Washington, D.C.\n\nA gunman attacked people on a bus and inside a Metro station in Southeast Washington before bystanders tackled him and officers took him into custody. A transit employee who tried to intervene was killed, and three other people were injured.\n\nJan. 28: Los Angeles\n\nThree people were killed and four others wounded in an early-morning shooting in an upscale neighborhood near Beverly Hills, Calif. The Los Angeles Police Department said the shooting took place at a short-term rental.\n\nJan. 23: Half Moon Bay, Calif.\n\nSeven people were fatally shot and one was transported to a hospital with life-threatening injuries after a gunman opened fire at two separate farms. A 67-year-old man who lived and worked at one of the farms, and previously worked at the other, was arrested; the authorities believe he intentionally targeted his victims.\n\nJan. 21: Monterey Park, Calif.\n\nA 72-year-old gunman killed 11 people and wounded at least nine others at a dance hall in a predominantly Asian American community as they celebrated the Lunar New Year. The police were investigating the motives of the gunman, who the police said was found dead a day later from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nJan. 16: Goshen, Calif.\n\nFour generations of a single family were fatally shot by two intruders inside a home in California’s San Joaquin Valley. The dead included a 72-year-old woman who was asleep in bed; a teenage mother and her infant; and a 19-year-old man.\n\nAlthough some members of the family had been involved in gangs, the police said, the nature of the attack appeared to be a calling card of Mexican drug cartels.\n\nJan. 4: Enoch, Utah\n\nEight people, all in the same family, were killed inside a home in what the police said was a murder-suicide. The victims included five children, ranging in age from 4 to 17."
