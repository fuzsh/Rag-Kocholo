        "text": "A jury found Jennifer Crumbley guilty of manslaughter after her son killed four students at a Michigan high school in 2021. The shooter’s father, James Crumbley, is set to go to trial next month.\n\nThere have been several other cases in which parents were charged for shootings carried out by their children, though not one in a school mass shooting.\n\nFor example, the father of the July 4 mass shooter in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, was accused of wrongdoing for signing his son’s application for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card months after his son displayed concerning behavior. The father, Robert Crimo Jr., ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct charges and agreed to serve 60 days in jail.\n\nIn a similar vein, the mother of a 6-year-old boy who shot his teacher at a Virginia school last year faced charges. The boy’s mother ultimately pleaded guilty to a state child neglect charge and felony charges of unlawful use of a controlled substance while possessing a firearm and making a false statement while purchasing a firearm.\n\nBut, the level of severity in the case of the Crumbleys is different. In a written opinion filed last March, a panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of these cases but called the situation unique and unusual.\n\nJoey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst, said the prosecution’s broad goal in bringing these cases was to deter other parents.\n\nThe jury foreperson in the trial of Jennifer Crumbley — the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021 — said the fact that Crumbley was the last adult seen with the gun before the shooting “really hammered it home.”\n\n“Lives hung in the balance, and we took that very seriously,” the woman, who identified herself as the foreperson in the courtroom and who read the jury’s verdict, said. She declined to give her name.\n\nShe said “both sides were well represented” when asked whether the jurors had to convince each other while deliberating.\n\nDuring her closing arguments, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald put up a photo of Jennifer Crumbley leaving the gun range on November 27, 2021, carrying the gun in a case that her son used in the shooting.\n\n“This is the last picture we have of that gun until we see it murder four kids on November 30, and the person holding it is Jennifer Crumbley. She’s the last person we see with that gun,” McDonald said.\n\nJames Crumbley, whose son killed four people in a mass shooting at a Michigan high school in 2021, is set to go to trial on March 5.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for his alleged role in the shooting. It comes after the shooter’s mother, Jennifer Crumbley, was found guilty of the same charges on Tuesday.\n\nThe evidence and arguments in James Crumbley’s trial may differ. At first, they had been working toward a joint defense, but their cases were separated after their defense learned of a conflict between the two. According to a prosecution filing from last year, Jennifer Crumbley “placed blame” on her husband in the shooting, leading to the split.\n\nWhy this is important: In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths — a novel and unusual legal theory.\n\nParents have been charged for their child’s actions before, but not in this specific way, according to Misty Marris, a trial attorney who has followed the case.\n\nJennifer Crumbley was convicted of four counts of involuntary manslaughter Tuesday afternoon.\n\nShe pleaded not guilty to all four counts for her role in the November 30, 2021, mass shooting at Oxford High School, which left four students dead and seven other people wounded, including a teacher.\n\nHere’s what both sides argued during the trial:\n\nThe prosecution argued Crumbley was responsible for the deaths because she was “grossly negligent” in giving a gun to her son Ethan, who was 15 at the time, and failing to get him proper mental health treatment despite warning signs. Over a week of testimony, law enforcement officials, school employees, shooting victims and those who knew Jennifer Crumbley testified for the prosecution.\n\nThe defense argued the blame laid elsewhere: on her husband for improperly securing the firearm; on the school for failing to notify her about her son’s behavioral issues; and on Ethan himself, who planned and carried out the attack on his own. Defense attorney Shannon Smith said the case was “dangerous” for parents everywhere. During her trial, Jennifer Crumbley took the stand in her own defense and said she wouldn’t have done anything differently.\n\nThe big picture: Broadly, the prosecution’s case relied on an unusual and novel legal strategy and represents an attempt to expand the scope of blame in mass shootings. And in its specifics, the trial provided an intimate view of the collapse of one American family. Crumbley’s husband, James, is scheduled to go on trial on the same charges in early March.\n\nCraig Shilling, the father of Justin Shilling, one of the four students killed in the 2021 mass shooting at Oxford High School, said the guilty verdict for the mother of the shooter was emotional.\n\n“It was a long time coming, but it’s definitely a step toward accountability,” Shilling told reporters outside the courtroom on Tuesday.\n\nJennifer Crumbley was found guilty of four counts of manslaughter and is set to be sentenced on April 9. Each count carries a maximum punishment of up to 15 years in prison, which would run concurrently.\n\nHe said parents need to address “things at every level” and there’s “no way to look the other way” now. In the case of Jennifer Crumbley, the father said many things could have stopped the shooting before it started.\n\n“You cannot choose to take your own interests over your child, especially when it comes to mental health and addressing, you know, concerns, the problem. Everything about that was disturbing,” Shilling said.\n\nAs Michigan jurors deliberated on four counts of involuntary manslaughter against Jennifer Crumbley on Monday, they sent two questions separately to the judge.\n\nHere’s what they were:\n\nThe jury sent their first question after deliberating for just over two hours: The jury sought for clarification on instructions, asking if there are different ways to convict Crumbley. Judge Cheryl Matthews decided to tell them yes, and referred the jury to re-read part of her instructions, which says “the prosecutor asserts two different theories to support the charges of Involuntary Manslaughter.”\n\nThe first theory is that Crumbley committed involuntary manslaughter because she failed to perform a legal duty. The second, is because she was grossly negligent.\n\n“Those theories are two different ways to prove the same crime. Either or both of these theories, if proven, are sufficient to establish the crime of involuntary manslaughter,” the instructions explain.\n\nThe second question came an hour later: The jury asked if they can infer anything from evidence or witnesses that the prosecution did not bring, specifically not bring in the shooter or other people who could answer how specifically Ethan Crumbley got the gun.\n\nJudge Matthews brought the jury in to tell them they can only consider the evidence that was brought in at trial.\n\nA jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021.\n\nJennifer Crumbley is on trial for manslaughter in a case that will test the limits of who is responsible for a mass shooting. She pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged roles in her son’s rampage, which left four students dead and seven others wounded. She faces up to 15 years in prison.\n\nHer husband, James, is scheduled to go to trial on the same charges in early March.\n\nIn bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths – a novel and unusual legal theory.\n\nIn particular, prosecutors accuse the gunman’s parents of disregarding the risks when they bought a gun for their son four days before the shooting, even though he was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence. They also say the parents did not mention the gun to school officials in a meeting to discuss Ethan’s disturbing drawings just hours before the fatal shooting.\n\nA jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021. The verdict will be read soon.\n\nHer son Ethan Crumbley was sentenced to life in prison without parole in December for the shooting, which left another wounding six students and a teacher injured.\n\nIn that sentencing, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Kwamé Rowe dismissed last-minute defense pleas that Crumbley’s life is salvageable and noted that the “defendant in his own words” told the court “this is nobody’s fault but his own.”\n\nRowe said victim Justin Shilling, 17, was shot at point-blank range after being told by the defendant to get on his knees. Hana St. Juliana, 14, was shot a second time after she was down, he said, “to finish the job by shooting her again.”\n\n“That is an execution. That is torture. He shot most people multiple times. And, as he wrote, he did this for notoriety. And he wanted to go down … as the biggest school shooter in Michigan history.”\n\nJennifer Crumbley sent several messages criticizing her own parenting ability and discussing how the family’s firearm was secured shortly after her teenage son Ethan carried out a school shooting at his Michigan high school in November 2021, according to messages revealed in court Wednesday.\n\nJennifer Crumbley wrote the messages as part of a lengthy conversation with Brian Meloche, a firefighter captain who testified he was in an extramarital romantic relationship with her at the time of the shooting.\n\nIn several messages shown in court Wednesday, Jennifer Crumbley stated how the firearm used in the shooting was stored and secured.\n\nOn the morning of the shooting, she said she had to go to her son’s school because she was worried he “was going to do something dumb,” Meloche testified. He responded by asking where her firearm was, and Jennifer said the gun was in her vehicle, he testified.\n\nHowever, other testimony has shown that the gun was in Ethan Crumbley’s backpack at school.\n\nMeloche also testified that he recalled telling Jennifer Crumbley to call 911 when she realized the gun was missing. He acknowledged that he deleted these and other messages from Facebook. A prosecutor told the jury that messages that were deleted by him and Crumbley could not be recovered by law enforcement."
