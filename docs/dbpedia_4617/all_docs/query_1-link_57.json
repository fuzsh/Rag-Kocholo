        "text": "PLAIN TWP. ‒ A 37-year-old father has been charged with reckless homicide, accused of allowing his 7-year-old son to be in a motel room with a loaded gun that discharged, killing the boy early Friday.\n\nWilliam B. Dolch is also charged with endangering children, evidence tampering and having weapons under disability in connection with the death of his son, Ka'Marion Dolch.\n\nThe complaint filed in Canton Municipal Court says Dolch is barred from having a gun due to a prior conviction for drug trafficking in Medina County. The child endangering charge says the gun was not secured properly. The evidence tampering charge alleges Dolch took the gun as he fled before law enforcement arrived.\n\nU.S. Marshals with the Canton Division of the Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force arrested Dolch on Friday afternoon in the 2700 block of Eighth Street NW in Canton, Stark County Sheriff George T. Maier said. The office is part of the task force.\n\nBrittany Franko, 29, of Canton, has been charged with complicity to reckless homicide, child endangering and obstructing official business. She was in the hotel room when the shooting occurred, according to the recording of a 911 call she made.\n\nThe obstruction charge alleges that she delayed deputies and detectives in their duties by giving false information to dispatchers and deputies about what happened.\n\n“This was a tragic incident that affects the entire community,” Maier said in a prepared statement. “I commend our deputies, marshals with the Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force and other community partners for working together to quickly identify and charge those responsible.\n\n“When there's violence in our community, we take it seriously and we use every measure we can to bring folks into custody,\" Maier said. \"So thank God we got this guy into custody. And you know, that's part of the narrative here in Stark County. We're not going to let these people perpetrate violence in our community.”\n\nIt appears the father, described as being from the Akron area, was living at the motel.\n\nThe exact circumstances around the shooting remain unclear as to who fired the weapon or how it went off.\n\nChild shot inside the Knights Inn hotel room\n\nThe fatal shot occurred inside a room at the Knights Inn at 3950 Convenience Circle NW. Maier said there were three children, a man and a woman in the room at the time.\n\nThe 7-year-old was shot in the back, said Tamara \"Tammy\" Wilkes, forensic investigator for the Stark County Coroner's Office.\n\nDeputies responded around 1 a.m. and immediately provided first aid, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nThe Plain Township Fire Department arrived and took the victim to Cleveland Clinic Mercy Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1:26 a.m. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office will perform an autopsy. Maier said Ka'Marion lived in Cuyahoga County.\n\nStark County Sheriff: Wife shot dead, husband seriously injured in Plain Township home\n\n911 calls shed light into what happened at the Knights Inn\n\nIn one of two overlapping 911 calls placed from the motel room, Franko tells the dispatcher that she does not know where the gunfire came from.\n\n\"I have no idea,\" Franko said. \"We heard a pop.\"\n\nShe said that she and the boys had just returned to the room.\n\nWhen a dispatcher asks Franko whether there was anyone in the room with her, she says, \"The kids were with me.\" She made no mention of the man the sheriff says had been in the room with them.\n\nIn response to a question from the dispatcher, Franko says the injured boy was not alert and was not talking to her. She said Ka'Marion's breathing was shallow.\n\n\"What do I do? I'm holding pressure on his back,\" Franko said.\n\nThe dispatcher tells her to maintain the pressure.\n\nFranko calls the boy's name as she pleads for him to resuscitate.\n\n\"C'mon, baby. C'mon, baby, breathe! Breathe for me,\" she says. \"C'mon ... you got this. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You got this. It's OK. You're a big boy. C'mon, breathe. Breathe. Breathe. C'mon, you're OK.\"\n\nThe dispatcher tells Franko that medics are on the way. The recording, which lasts about 6 1/2 minutes, ends with Franko talking with sheriff's deputies.\n\n\"I don't know what happened,\" she says. \"The door was open. We just got here and he was brushing his teeth. Like they were getting ready to brush their teeth for the night. They were folding a blanket.\"\n\nIn a separate, shorter 911 call placed a little later, the other child in the room tells the dispatcher their room number. In response to the dispatcher's questions, the boy says his little brother was shot, is not breathing, and that he does not know where the weapon is.\n\nAfter a dispatcher asks the boy to spell his last name, he stops speaking. A man's voice can be heard. The call ends shortly afterward, after the dispatcher asks where the child had been shot.\n\nThe Knights Inn is off Whipple Avenue NW just east of Belden Village Mall. The 2-star hotel has 65 rooms. A front desk employee said the motel would have no comment.\n\nAnyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the sheriff’s detective bureau at 330-430-3800 extension 0.\n\nDrowning suspected: Massillon 3-year-old dies after being found in home pool\n\nCitizens can also communicate with the sheriff’s office using the mobile app, which can be downloaded for free via the app store on any smartphone by searching Stark Sheriff Ohio.\n\nReach Nancy at 330-580-8382 or nancy.molnar@cantonrep.com.
