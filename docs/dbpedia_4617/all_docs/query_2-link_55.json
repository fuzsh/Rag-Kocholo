        "text": "Geoff Bennett:\n\nFor the first time ever, a parent has been convicted in a mass school shooting.\n\nJennifer Crumbley today was found guilty on four counts of involuntary manslaughter. Her teenage son, Ethan, killed four students, Madiyson Baldwin, Tate Myre, Hana St. Juliana, and Justin Shilling, and injured seven others in 2021 at Oxford High School in Michigan.\n\nThe gunman was sentenced to life in prison without parole back in December. His mother now faces up to 60 years in prison and will be sentenced in April.\n\nFor more on the verdict and broader legal questions, we turn to Ekow Yankah, law professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nThank you for being back with us.\n\nAnd Jennifer Crumbley told jurors that it was her husband's responsibility to keep track of the gun. She said she saw no signs of mental distress in her son. How were the prosecutors able to convince the jury that her behavior crossed the line into recklessness, a conscious disregard, and ultimately involuntary manslaughter?\n\nEkow Yankah, University of Michigan Law School: You're right that she in some ways tried to blame what we call the empty chair, that is, point at a defendant who's not around.\n\nAnd perhaps that's not surprising. The trial of the Crumbleys was meant to be a joint trial and was separated at the last moment. So, many of us speculated that there had been some legal questions where one of them thought the other could be held more liable or be painted in a worse light.\n\nUltimately, though, what Jennifer just couldn't convince the jury of is that, even given the legal principle that you're not responsible for someone else's acts, when she had so many years of notice, so many troubling moments, so many really damning facts, when she walked out of that schoolhouse knowing that her son had a gun, and having had administrators ask her if she wanted to take him home, that she could not have intervened somewhere along the way and saved four lives and saved seven others from injury.\n\nEkow Yankah:\n\nI think we want to look at the specific and the general.\n\nCertainly, for him, this is a — as big a punch to the gut as you can imagine, obviously not just because his wife has been convicted, but given the closeness of the facts, it's ominous for his legal chances.\n\nIndeed, I will be interested to see whether or not he still decides to go to trial, if he decides that there are some facts that are sufficiently distinguishing that he doesn't — isn't looking at the same thing, obviously, different case, different jury, but pretty close facts.\n\nFor people more generally though, this case both underscores how really troubling these facts were, but also underscores how really worrying it might be for any set of parents, the parent who's working hard to keep their son out of gang violence or keep their son who's struggling with drugs or alcohol from taking a joyride.\n\nAnd how that's going to play out once prosecutors have this new tool is something that I think the defense really hoped that juries would hold onto. And, lastly, I want to point out that there are going to be some people who are convicted that we never hear of, people who, with this precedent facing them, would rather plead to a lesser charge now that prosecutors have this new tool in their arsenal.\n\nEkow Yankah:\n\nYes, I mean, part of what's going on here is our deep divide in the country about the role guns play in our lives.\n\nI think there's some set of families that heard, you bought him a gun for an early Christmas gift, especially a young man who's been struggling with mental health issues, and you didn't keep it under lock and key? That for some families is shocking. Indeed, it led to Michigan passing new laws about gun storage.\n\nFor other people, guns are much more part of their lives. Guns are kind of part of the background firmament, and it's, frankly, not unheard of or even unusual to get your kid their first gun.\n\nI think we as a country are going to have to really wrestle with how ordinary we see guns. And, certainly, parents who now think a gun is just part of their culture and their life have to think about whether or not they have been sufficiently careful about the way their child can access that gun, especially as the child gets older."
