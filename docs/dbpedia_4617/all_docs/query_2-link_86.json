        "text": "A man is facing a capital murder charge after two young girls and a man were killed when a fight escalated into gunfire outside a car wash late on the Fourth of July. Three other people were wounded in the shooting.\n\nFort Worth police confirmed to NBC 5 overnight that they were called to a fatal shooting at the Crystal Clean Car Wash on the 7500 block of W. Cleburne Road at about 11:40 p.m. Police said when officers arrived at the car wash, they found an adult man with a gunshot wound to his lower body. That man, whose identity has not yet been confirmed, was taken to the hospital, where he later died.\n\nOfficers soon learned there were multiple victims in the shooting and that five others were taken by private vehicles to nearby hospitals.\n\nTwo of the victims were sisters 15-month-old Wynter Thouston and 4-year-old Ivy Pierce. According to the Tarrant County Medical Examiner, both girls were taken to Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southwest Fort Worth, where they died of their injuries shortly after midnight.\n\nThree other people who were injured in the shooting are not believed to have life-threatening injuries, police said.\n\nThe girls' family said they were not ready to speak publicly, but their aunt told Telemundo 39 the family had just moved 'to start over' and as far as she knew, they were in the area to enjoy a fireworks show.\n\nThe family provided NBC 5 photographs of the sweet girls.\n\n\"My heart breaks for the families who are waking up after the 4th of July, a day meant for celebration, to grieve the loss of young lives taken from senseless crime,” said Fort Worth Chief of Police Neil Noakes in a statement Friday. “We share in their grief and remain committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our community.”\n\nFort Worth police detectives said the shooting started after a fight broke out between two people and someone started shooting. Video recorded at the car wash showed dozens of evidence markers on the ground near one of the wash bays.\n\n\"Detectives learned that a fight broke out between the suspect and one of the shooting victims. The suspect began shooting at the individual and others who were present,\" police said in a statement. \"During the course of the investigation, it was determined the suspect was also shot during this incident.\"\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Fort Worth police identified 26-year-old Kanard Trent Murphy as the suspect in the shooting and charged him with capital murder of multiple persons. Police said Murphy is currently hospitalized and undergoing a medical evaluation. He has not yet been booked into the Tarrant County Jail, and his bond has not been set. It's also unclear if Murphy has obtained an attorney to speak on his behalf.\n\nNoakes thanked residents \"for their vigilance and cooperation during this time. As always, we urge the community to report suspicious activity. If you see something, say something.\"\n\nThe investigation into the shooting is ongoing."
