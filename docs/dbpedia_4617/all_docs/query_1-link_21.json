        "text": "sabrina tavernise\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Sabrina Tavernise. This is The Daily.\n\nIn the small and close-knit community of Uvalde, Texas, the killing of 21 people at an elementary school has left few lives untouched. Over the past few days, my colleagues Rick Rojas, Natalie Kitroeff, Eduardo Medina and I set out to tell some of those stories.\n\n[music]\n\nIt’s Wednesday, June 1.\n\ngemma lopez\n\nHi.\n\nrick rojas\n\nHi. All right, cool. Would you mind just spelling your name for me to make sure I have that right?\n\ngemma lopez\n\nG-E-M-M-A.\n\nrick rojas\n\nAnd your last name?\n\ngemma lopez\n\nLopez, L-O-P-E-Z.\n\nrick rojas\n\nAnd how old are you?\n\ngemma lopez\n\n10 years old.\n\nrick rojas\n\nAnd just to be sure, you’re her grandmother?\n\nfernanda moreno\n\nYes, I’m her grandmother.\n\nrick rojas\n\nAll right.\n\nfernanda moreno\n\nI have custody of her.\n\nrick rojas\n\nOK, OK — great, great. So I guess, first off, tell me about today. What have you been doing today?\n\ngemma lopez\n\nToday, I didn’t just wake up. I woke up at 7 because she just got here at 7. And then we did a lot of stuff. We were playing around. We were playing hide and seek for a little bit. We went to our grandpa’s. And then we were playing around with Alexis, my little cousin.\n\nrick rojas\n\nOK. And so what grade are you in?\n\ngemma lopez\n\nI’m in fourth grade.\n\nrick rojas\n\nOK, so you’ve just been playing and just trying to take it easy today?\n\ngemma lopez\n\nYeah, and then we got chicken. We ate it here. And then we were just playing around.\n\nfernanda moreno\n\nYeah.\n\nrick rojas\n\nNice. And so you were just talking about your classroom being close to there. I mean, would you mind? I know it’s difficult. But what do you remember from that — from that day? What kind of —\n\ngemma lopez\n\nAll I remember was just in the morning, we were just eating breakfast. Then we put on a movie. The movie was I think “The Jungle Cruise.”\n\nrick rojas\n\nOK.\n\ngemma lopez\n\nLike, in the middle of it, we went to P.E. Then we played a little bit more of the movie. And then we went to the awards ceremony. And then when I came back, we finished the movie. And then we did, like, a little bit other work. And then we were just playing — we were just messing around, playing around, doing whatever we do. And then all of a sudden, like, unexpectedly, I heard gunshots.\n\nBut I thought they were, like, firecrackers, ‘cause kids on their free time, they could mess around and everything. After I heard that, I wasn’t thinking of it as much. And then I just checked the window. Then I saw police officers holding the gun.\n\nAnd then I heard a gunshot again. And they shot the top of the wall. Then I went in between Jalisa (sp) and Stacy (sp) and went, like, close to my arm.\n\nBut I missed my arm. And then, like, I knew something was, like, so wrong. So everybody went under the — first they turned off the lights. And everybody went under the table. They were scared and everything. But I told them to be quiet. Then I heard a lot more of gunshots. Oh, I was crying a little bit. And my best friend Sophia (sp) was also crying right next to me.\n\nrick rojas\n\nI mean, how do you see her doing? I mean, how — I guess, you see your granddaughter go through something like this. I mean, how do you help her cope?\n\nfernanda moreno\n\nWell, what she was telling me that she went under the table. And I said, well, that’s good, mama. That’s good. She didn’t run or scream. She just went under the table. I mean, she cried a little bit. But I mean, she didn’t panic that much.\n\nrick rojas\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nfernanda moreno\n\nMm-hmm. And it’s good that she turned off the light, you know.\n\nrick rojas\n\nOh, so you turned off the light in classroom?\n\nfernanda moreno\n\nYes, she turned off the light.\n\ngemma lopez\n\nYes.\n\nrick rojas\n\nWow. And what made you think to do that?\n\ngemma lopez\n\nBecause we always have all these drills about the lockdowns. And they always say to turn off the lights instantly and go hide. So I instantly just remembered that. So I instantly did it.\n\nrick rojas\n\nOK, so have there been just like, they told you to do this, or did you actually practice this before?\n\ngemma lopez\n\nWe practiced a lot of lockdown since, like, pre-K or kindergarten.\n\nrick rojas\n\nWow.\n\n[music]\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nYour name is Jacob, yeah?\n\njacob albarado\n\nYes.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nA-L-B-A-R-A-D-O. That’s your last name, right?\n\njacob albarado\n\nYes, correct.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd are you in the Border Patrol?\n\njacob albarado\n\nYes.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd so were you on duty at the time, or were you —\n\njacob albarado\n\nNo, I was off duty. I was in my slacks and dress shoes because I had just — I had just left because I was at an awards ceremony.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nYou were at an award ceremony for your daughter?\n\njacob albarado\n\nYeah, that’s correct. That goes there at Robb. She’s in second grade at Robb.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nOK.\n\njacob albarado\n\nAnd my wife teaches fourth grade at Robb.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nHow did you hear that this was going on?\n\njacob albarado\n\nAs I was walking into the barbershop, they go, did you hear that? And I said, no. I said, what, what are you talking about? He said, man, I think I heard gunshots. And I said, nah, I didn’t hear anything.\n\nI sit down and get my haircut.\n\nAnd nothing — we didn’t get started at all. He received a text from his wife that Robb had a shooter. And then I received a text from my wife saying that there is an active shooter. So we just took off, hauling butt to the school as fast as we could.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nYou and the barber?\n\njacob albarado\n\nYes.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nDid the barber have a kid in the school too?\n\njacob albarado\n\nYes.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nOh my gosh.\n\njacob albarado\n\nThankfully, my barber had a shotgun. And I grabbed his shotgun. And I took off running towards the school.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nYou’re kidding me.\n\njacob albarado\n\nNo.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd he had that in his car or something? Like, did you run?\n\njacob albarado\n\nYeah, he had it in his truck.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nDo you remember what time this was around?\n\njacob albarado\n\nI checked my messages — I checked my messages, it was like 11:45, 11:47.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo what were you thinking when you went in? I mean, when you went in there, were just like, I’m going to save these kids? I mean, what was on your mind? What was going through your head?\n\njacob albarado\n\nOh, seriously — seriously, I need to get my wife out. I need to get my daughter out. But of course, I’m getting everyone else out as well. My wife got out. I was in contact with her. But I was still looking for my daughter. So from that point on, I just said, where’s my daughter? Where is Jada? I ran towards the opposite wing to go get my daughter.\n\nMy daughter was past the playground. So I went after her. I mean, I knew where she was at — my wife kept on telling me that she was in the restroom because she was — my wife was in contact with my daughter’s teacher. I was looking for a restroom. I couldn’t find the restroom. But apparently, there’s restrooms inside the classrooms.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nBut were you personally looking or were the agents looking?\n\njacob albarado\n\nNo, like I said, I ran over there. And I was looking for the restroom. I couldn’t find the restroom. And then I told him, I said, we need to get these kids out of here. I take charge of every situation. I’ve had 13 years in law enforcement.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nOK.\n\njacob albarado\n\nI don’t know how many years these other guys have. But I take control of every situation.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nOK, so you were leading this team basically.\n\njacob albarado\n\nThis makeshift team that I made, yes.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd how did you make — you got to the scene and, what? Did you just see your colleagues and say, like, we’re doing this, or how did you get the team together that fast?\n\njacob albarado\n\nYeah, I ran. I ran across. And I said, what’s going on? The kids are all in the room right now. I said, man — I said, get these kids out of here. I said, these kids — this is our opportunity. This is our time to get the kids out. So I started clearing the rooms.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd you had just a bunch of your — a bunch of officers were out there. And so you were able to just get together a team right there?\n\njacob albarado\n\nYeah, it’s a small town. Half these guys know me. Half these guys don’t. They realized I was taking charge. And they just listened. I was on the sidewalk. I sent two officers to open up the rooms and send them my way.\n\nAnd then I had another two officers pointing their guns towards where the active shooter was at. And then I had another two officers set up on the sidewalk so the kids can know where to go.\n\nI cleared out her whole wing of classes, which is like five or six classes. And then I finally see my daughter. And then I start clearing out the other wing. And then I see my daughter’s best friend. I clear out all their — clearing them all out, sending them towards the parking lot so they can get off campus.\n\nSo who knows if the shooter is going to be moving around? Who knows? But at that point in time, the shooter wasn’t there so I was getting everybody, anyone I could, off of campus.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nHow many kids do you think you cleared out?\n\njacob albarado\n\nFive, six classes on one wing, which is about 20 something kids a class, and then another wing, which is another five or six classes — another 20-something kids a class.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nWow.\n\njacob albarado\n\nSo easily, I’d say, 200 kids.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nWow. Did you see your daughter come out? Were you able to give her a hug?\n\njacob albarado\n\nNo, I saw her. I saw her. I spotted her. And it was a big relief that she was fine, yes. I think I might have given her a hug and just kept on moving the kids along.\n\nI did what I was trained to do.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nHi.\n\nricardo garcia\n\nHello.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nI don’t know if I’m in the right place. I was looking for Rubin.\n\nricardo garcia\n\nRubin, no, he’s not there right now. He’s next door.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nHe’s next door?\n\nricardo garcia\n\nYeah, yes, ma’am. He’s next door.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nYeah.\n\nricardo garcia\n\nBut he’s not there right now.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nOK.\n\nricardo garcia\n\nAnd with everything that happened to him, it’s just so crazy, so unbelievable. I work at the hospital, so.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nYou do?\n\nricardo garcia\n\nYes, I work at the hospital.\n\nOh my god, I just can’t get it out of my mind. I can’t sleep. Ever since that, I couldn’t sleep. I just can’t sleep. I just, I hear the screaming and everything. I just — everything is just crazy.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nricardo garcia\n\nI never thought it was going to happen here. But it did. But it did, so. What’s your name again?\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nNatalie.\n\nricardo garcia\n\nNatalie.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nYeah, what’s your name?\n\nricardo garcia\n\nMy name is Ricky.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nRicky?\n\nricardo garcia\n\nYes, ma’am.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nricardo garcia\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nWhat do you do at the hospital, if you don’t mind my —\n\nricardo garcia\n\nI’m a groundskeeper.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nThis is at —\n\nricardo garcia\n\nI had my grandson — my two grandsons were going to school there. And I have a niece that was going. But they are OK. But they’re just shaken up. I guess they saw what they saw. And it’s just crazy.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\nricardo garcia\n\nBut yeah [INAUDIBLE], sometimes I just can’t sleep. I can hear the screaming, the yelling, and what I saw in the kids when they’re bringing them in. I could see the kids when the door would open to the emergency room. You can see the kids when they’re coming in. And it’s just unbelievable.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nWhen you were hearing the screaming, who was screaming?\n\nricardo garcia\n\nThe parents when they were getting to know the bad news. They [INAUDIBLE], no [EXPLETIVE] no!\n\nHitting the walls, I can hear that. I can hear that — the fear, the sadness, everything — the anger they were feeling. My body — I mean, I have goosebumps. I had goosebumps. Man, I’m lucky. Thank you god, but you know, what about the other kids?\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nI mean, how many parents did you see like?\n\nricardo garcia\n\nOh man, the whole hospital was full. Whole hospital full — the whole hospital was full. Everybody is going and sitting down, just shocked. And I mean, there’s something that — it’s just something I just can’t get out of my mind. And the nights — sometimes I can’t sleep.\n\nI can hear the echoes of the screaming and the pain they were in, stuff like that. And I think I’m going to go to counseling here tomorrow at the [INAUDIBLE] because I just — this was [INAUDIBLE]. Ever since I saw that, I mean, I thought I would never see something like that. You see it in the movies and hear it [INAUDIBLE].\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nWhen you can’t sleep at night, are you hearing a specific thing that they’re saying?\n\nricardo garcia\n\nYeah, just yelling, no, no! That’s the only thing I can. That’s the only thing I can hear, the parents. No, no! [EXPLETIVE] no, boom, boom! [EXPLETIVE] no, boom, boom! No, no — it’s just, man.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nYou’re going to go do some counseling right?\n\nricardo garcia\n\nYes, yes, I got to, miss. It’s just — shaking my hands. I mean, I just feel — I don’t know. I feel weird. I wish I could have done something but I can’t. I just — so unreal.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nYeah.\n\nDo you think anything is going to change because of all this?\n\nricardo garcia\n\nI’m hoping so, Natalie. I’m hoping so. Something’s got to change. I mean, come on. There’s just too much of it.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nI’m so sorry for what you had to go through.\n\nricardo garcia\n\nIt’s OK. Thank you.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nI’m going to send you a note, OK? I’m going to send you a text.\n\nricardo garcia\n\nYes.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nI’m going to also [INAUDIBLE].\n\nricardo garcia\n\nThank you [INAUDIBLE].\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAll right, Ricardo, right?\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nWe’ll be right back.\n\ndr. ronald stewart\n\nSo I’m Dr. Ronald Stewart. I’m a trauma surgeon at University Hospital in San Antonio. And I’ve been here for, I guess, more or less 40 years.\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nOh, wow.\n\ndr. ronald stewart\n\nAnd I’ve been faculty since 1993.\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nSo you’ve seen a lot of trauma surgery over the years.\n\ndr. ronald stewart\n\nI have. I’ve treated lots of patients with firearm injuries and gunshot wounds over the years. And then we had the Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church mass shooting.\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nThat was the shooting in 2017, if I’m not mistaken, right?\n\ndr. ronald stewart\n\nYes.\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nWhere 26 people were killed.\n\ndr. ronald stewart\n\nYeah.\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nOn that note, Dr. Stewart, I wanted to turn to Tuesday and the shooting in Uvalde.\n\ndr. ronald stewart\n\nYes.\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nSo bring me back to the beginning of that day. How did it begin for you? What was the morning like?\n\ndr. ronald stewart\n\nSo I had a 7 a.m. meeting. Then I had another meeting with our chief medical officer, just normal daily activities. And then sometime at around, I guess, probably around 11:30 or noon, I got notification that there was first responders responding to a shooting with an elementary school.\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nWhat was the first thing that came to your mind?\n\ndr. ronald stewart\n\nThe first thing — the first thing honestly, I think, would be sadness, emotion of sadness — the first emotion.\n\nAnd a wish to hope that it’s not accurate, that the report’s not right.\n\nBut then really just probably a few seconds later, it’s like, OK, so our job is to prepare at that time for whatever comes our way.\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nAnd what’s the first thing you see once people start to arrive?\n\ndr. ronald stewart\n\nWe received three children and one adult. And you have children who were elementary-age children who, they’re small. And critically ill patients are intubated. And these wounds are — the wounds that we saw were typical of high-energy wounds from high-velocity firearms.\n\nTypical 12 muzzle velocity of say, 800 to 1,200 feet per second — a handgun muzzle velocity, you have an entrance wound. And you may or may not have an exit wound. And you have two holes. And that’s what you have with these sorts of wounds. You have big defects in tissue. It’s destroyed. It’s open. That’s what we were seeing.\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nAnd Dr. Stewart, what will you most remember from that day?\n\ndr. ronald stewart\n\nTo me, people working together to help another person, a child, when they need it the most is the most beautiful thing. I’m a photographer. And I consciously look for beauty in the world.\n\nBut the most beautiful thing that I see is people working together to help somebody when they need it the most. It’s like watching a symphony that all the parts are different but all working together towards a common goal. That, I will remember. That’s the beauty. That’s the beauty.\n\n[music]\n\nProbably the thing I remember the most negative is a conversation with a child who’s describing the events — the events of the scene, the horror of the events, the actuality.\n\nWe weren’t asking what happened. They just started talking about what happened. That to me is the most — the thing I will remember.\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nYeah.\n\ndr. ronald stewart\n\nAnd you know, I feel kind of bad and guilty in that maybe I feel like I’m focused on how I feel a little bit. But — because obviously, the impact to the patient and families is nothing compared to anything that I go through or we go through. It’s nothing. It pales in comparison, you know? But.\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nYeah.\n\n[music]\n\neduardo medina\n\nI’d love to make sure I have the spelling of your names correct, if that’s OK?\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nOK.\n\neduardo medina\n\nKimberly Rubio, right?\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nYes.\n\neduardo medina\n\nI got K-I-M-B-E-R-L-Y?\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nYes.\n\neduardo medina\n\nAnd then Rubio, R-U-B-I-O?\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nYes.\n\neduardo medina\n\nSir, would you be comfortable if I include your name in there?\n\nfelix rubio\n\nThat’s fine.\n\neduardo medina\n\nPerfect. How do I spell it?\n\nfelix rubio\n\nFelix, F-E-L-I-X. And then Rubio.\n\neduardo medina\n\nWould you be comfortable if I include your daughter’s age in the story as well?\n\nfelix rubio\n\nThat’s fine.\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nShe’s 10.\n\neduardo medina\n\n10, perfect.\n\nfelix rubio\n\nThey need to know how old she was.\n\neduardo medina\n\nI don’t know where you’d want to start. But something we’ve been asking today is if parents were there at the school when the officers were there, and if, so what you saw and what you made of the response there from the law enforcement?\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nWe were there for — first of all, we had two kids on campus. My son is in second grade. And my daughter was in fourth grade. We went to his award ceremony at 8. And we left. And we went back — her’s was at 10:30.\n\nShe got two awards, a good citizen award and the honor roll. We took pictures with her. And then my mother-in-law said that we would get her ice cream after school.\n\nfelix rubio\n\nShe loves ice cream.\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nShe loves ice cream. She always wants ice cream.\n\neduardo medina\n\nIt sounds to me like she was a brilliant girl. Can you tell me more about that? Was she always very studious?\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nAlways. My husband has said it before. She is the student every teacher wants because she does everything that’s asked of her. You never have to tell her to do her homework.\n\nShe does everything. She’s very competitive. They have a program for math to help them. And they get points. And she was just back and forth with this one student one year because —\n\neduardo medina\n\nShe wanted to be first.\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nYes, she wanted to be first.\n\neduardo medina\n\nWow.\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nShe’s shy, really quiet. We talked about this, though. When she had a point that she wanted across, she made it. She would speak up.\n\neduardo medina\n\nAnd sorry, I should have had this be my first question. But it’s just come to mind now. How do I spell your daughter’s name?\n\nkimberly rubio\n\neduardo medina\n\nThat’s Alexandria Aniyah Rubio.\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nYes.\n\neduardo medina\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nfelix rubio\n\nVery last minute.\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nVery last minute, they told us, hey, if you want to leave tomorrow, we need you to fill this out now.\n\n[INAUDIBLE], it was perfect.\n\neduardo medina\n\nIt’s a beautiful name.\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nYeah.\n\neduardo medina\n\nI would love to know from you, if there are particular messages you want to make sure people understand from someone who’s at the core of this terrible tragedy.\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nWe live in this really small town in this red state. And everyone keeps telling us that it’s not the time to be political. But it is. It is.\n\nAnd I don’t want this to happen to anybody else.\n\nYou know, when I got home, my mom told me that the governor was here and that he wanted to come and meet with the families. And my first thought was, my Lexi doesn’t even like him. She was really little. But we talked about this stuff at home.\n\nAnd we talked about women’s rights. And she was a budding feminist, you know? Like, she was —\n\neduardo medina\n\nYeah.\n\nkimberly rubio\n\n[CRYING] And it’s not right.\n\nIt’s my baby, and I don’t want anybody else to go through this.\n\nfelix rubio\n\nAnd this is her husband, Lexi’s dad.\n\neduardo medina\n\nHi, sir.\n\nfelix rubio\n\nAnd like my wife said, we just want to get the point across. We hear it all the time. Someone needs to come up with a solution. This is painful. It really is. Our baby was taken. And she’s taken.\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nThey don’t care about Lexi. They don’t care about my baby. I don’t even understand why anybody needs these kind of weapons.\n\neduardo medina\n\nI suppose we —\n\nkimberly rubio\n\nIs it really worth my baby? Is it really worth all of these babies?\n\n[music]\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nOn Tuesday, funerals for the children killed at Robb Elementary began in Uvalde. Many of them will be buried in specially-designed caskets decorated with their favorite sports and cartoon characters.\n\n[music]\n\nsabrina tavernise\n\nWe’ll be right back.\n\nHere’s what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court blocked a Texas law that would ban large social media companies from removing posts based on the views contained in them. The case is moving through the lower courts. And the 5-to-4 vote suspends the Texas law while it is being litigated. Supporters of the law say it was an attempt to combat what they called Silicon Valley’s censorship of conservative views.\n\nThe law was prompted in part by the decisions of some platforms to bar former President Donald Trump after the January 6 attack on the Capitol. The case may well eventually end up at the Supreme Court. Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a dissent that the issues raised in it were so novel and significant that the court would have to consider them at some point.\n\nToday’s episode was produced by Diana Nguyen, Asthaa Chaturvedi and Clare Toeniskoetter, with help from Will Reid and Eric Krupke. It was edited by Michael Benoist with help from Lisa Chow, contains original music by Elisheba Ittoop, Marion Lozano and Dan Powell, and was engineered by Corey Schreppel.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jack Healy, Frances Robles, Josh Peck, Edgar Sandoval, Jazmine Ulloa, and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs.
