        "text": "An 8-year-old boy who was critically injured during the mass shooting at the Brooklands Plaza splash pad in Rochester Hills was released from the hospital on Friday, authorities said.\n\nOn June 15, a suspect, later identified as 42-year-old William Michael Nash of Shelby Township, opened fire on families at the splash pad, leaving nine people injured. The gunman died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound shortly after the mass shooting, police said.\n\nPreviously, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard and a GoFundMe for the 8-year-old victim (whose name has not otherwise been released) stated the boy was shot in the head. He now rests comfortably at home, the sheriff's office confirmed in a news release Saturday."
