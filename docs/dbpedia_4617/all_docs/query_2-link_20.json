        "text": "A 10-year-old Texas boy will not face charges for fatally shooting a stranger in 2022, authorities say.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nChild says he killed Texas man in 2022\n\nAccording to the Gonzales County sheriff's office, the child's confession came after officials in the Nixon-Smiley Consolidated Independent School District said the boy had referenced the killing and made new threats. That's when school officials involved law enforcement officers, who interviewed the boy at a child advocacy center.\n\n“During the interview the ten year old child described in detail that two years ago he shot and killed a man in a trailer in Nixon, Texas,” a sheriff’s office release said.\n\nBrandon O'Quinn Rasberry fatally shot in 2022\n\nBrandon O'Quinn Rasberry, 32, died in his RV home in Nixon after being fatally shot on Jan. 18, 2022. Until last week, the case had gone cold. But now the 10-year-old child has provided law enforcement with more details about the crime he claims to have committed.\n\nThe boy told law officers he didn’t know Rasberry and was not angry at him at the time of the shooting. He was visiting his grandfather at the mobile home park, according to the sheriff’s office, and grabbed a gun from his grandfather’s truck.\n\n“The Child stated he observed Brandon sleeping in his bed and approached Brandon and discharged the firearm into Brandon striking him one time in the head,” the release said. “The child stated as he was leaving the RV he discharged the firearm another time into the couch inside the RV.”\n\nLaw enforcement later retrieved the gun from a pawn shop as evidence and collected shell casings from the mobile home park. The boy has undergone mental health evaluation and treatment, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nThe office didn't name the child.\n\nPeople are also reading: Texas boy was 7 when he fatally shot a man he didn't know, child tells law enforcement\n\nWho's responsible when a child shoots someone?\n\nAccording to Texas law, the child was too young when the crime occurred to face charges, the sheriff's office said.\n\n“At the time of the murder the juvenile suspect was seven years old, one week shy of his 8th birthday,” the release said. “Therefore charges for murder will not be filed.”\n\nHowever, authorities have charged the child in connection with a recent incident in which he is accused of threatening another student. The sheriff's office said that threat soon spiraled into the confession to killing Rasberry.\n\nAccording to the confession, the boy had no known reason to kill Rasberry.\n\n\"The child was also asked if he was mad at Brandon for some reason or if Brandon had ever done anything to him to make him mad, the child stated no,\" the release said.\n\nIn some instances, adults are charged after a young child commits a violent act. When a 6-year-old child in Virginia shot a teacher in January 2023, the child's mother was sentenced to two years in prison for felony child neglect."
