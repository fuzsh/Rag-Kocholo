        "text": "PLAIN TOWNSHIP, Ohio — The Stark County Sheriff's Office is investigating after a 7-year-old boy was found shot in a Plain Township hotel room.\n\nInvestigators were called to the Knights Inn along Convenience Circle just before 1 a.m. Friday.\n\nWhen they arrived, they found Ka’Marion Dolch shot in the back inside one of the rooms.\n\nStark County Sheriff George Maier said the boy was rushed to an area hospital for treatment, where he died.\n\nThe boy's biological father, William Dolch, 37, was arrested on 8th Street in Canton late Friday afternoon, police said.\n\nDolch is charged with having weapons under disability, tampering with evidence, endangering children and reckless homicide, police said.\n\nA woman was also charged with complicity to commit reckless homicide, endangering children and obstructing official business in in connection to the shooting. Another man is also charged in connection with the child's death; he's charged with tampering with evidence, a third-degree felony.\n\nTwo other young children were staying in the room as well, according to investigators. Those kids are now in the care of Children Services, according to Inspector William Jones.\n\nThe circumstances leading up to the shooting are not entirely clear, but Jones said the gun was \"in the possession of Dolch\" when it discharged, striking the child.\n\nInvestigators said Dolch was prohibited from having a gun because of a previous drug trafficking conviction.\n\nDuring a call to 911, a woman inside the hotel room said she didn't know how the boy was shot.\n\n\"I was just sitting here. We were folding a blanket and then he was standing and getting ready to brush his teeth for the night. I just need... I don't know... I don't know what happened, where it came from or anything,\" she said.\n\n“This was a tragic incident that affects the entire community,” explained Stark County Sheriff George T. Maier. “I commend our Deputies, Marshalls with the Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force and other community partners for working together to quickly identify and charge those responsible.”\n\nPlain Township Trustees President Brook Harless released the following statement:\n\n\" We are deeply saddened by the tragic incident that occurred in our township, resulting in the untimely death of a young individual. Our hearts go out to the family and friends affected by this devastating loss."
