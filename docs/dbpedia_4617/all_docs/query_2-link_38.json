        "text": "MACOMB (25News Now) - A four-year-old and a 57-year-old man who held the child at knifepoint were killed Saturday night in an officer-involved shooting near the Western Illinois University campus.\n\nIllinois State Police released a statement Monday evening about their investigation so far into what was initially called in as an incident of domestic violence in the 900 block of North Charles Street in Macomb.\n\nWhen Macomb officers arrived at an apartment, they reported seeing blood and hearing screams. Macomb Police say officers saw a man with a knife who refused to drop it.\n\nState Police say the man ducked out of view of officers and came back into view holding a knife around the child’s throat.\n\nInvestigators say the Macomb officer fired one shot and both the man and child suffered “fatal gunshot injuries.”\n\nThe man is identified as Anthony T. George, 57. Citing the McDonough County coroner’s policy, authorities are not releasing the name of the juvenile who also died.\n\nA 36-year-old woman suffered stab wounds, but her condition isn’t known.\n\nSo far, State Police said they have reviewed body worn camera video, evidence, witness interviews, and autopsy reports,\n\nPolice say they have met with family members of the two people that died.\n\nWhen the investigation is finished, State Police said they will submit all reports and evidence to the McDonough County State’s Attorney’s Office.\n\nThe officer who fired the shot is on administrative leave. It’s been at least 20-years since there’s been an officer-involved shooting in Macomb, authorities said.\n\nYou can watch 25News - any newscast, anywhere - streaming LIVE on 25NewsNow.com, our 25News mobile app, and on our WEEK 25News SmartTV streaming app. Learn more about how you can get connected to 25News streaming live news here."
