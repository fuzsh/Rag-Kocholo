An 8-year-old boy who was critically injured during the mass shooting at the Brooklands Plaza splash pad in Rochester Hills was released from the hospital on Friday, authorities said.

On June 15, a suspect, later identified as 42-year-old William Michael Nash of Shelby Township, opened fire on families at the splash pad, leaving nine people injured. The gunman died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound shortly after the mass shooting, police said.

Previously, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard and a GoFundMe for the 8-year-old victim (whose name has not otherwise been released) stated the boy was shot in the head. He now rests comfortably at home, the sheriff's office confirmed in a news release Saturday.
