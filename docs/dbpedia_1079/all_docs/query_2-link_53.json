        "text": "On that fateful day of April 13th 1919, a young 15 year old Sikh boy named Udham Singh attended a gathering at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar near the holy shrine Harmandir Sahib (The Golden Temple). He had come to hear the speeches being made by some patriotic Indians.\n\nAt the edge of the gathering of several thousand unarmed people, suddenly marched in the arrogant Brigadier. Reginald Dryer along with a number of Indian soldiers of the British Indian Army. They took up positions blocking the main exit from the park.\n\nWithout any warning to the masses Brigadier Dyer issued orders to the soldiers to open fire without stopping. He instructed the soldiers to focus on the denser areas, so that one bullet could kill several people.\n\nFor 10 non stop minutes, the soldiers fired into the crowd of men, women, children and infants. 1800 people were massacred and 1200 badly wounded.\n\nUdham Singh Kamboj, was one amongst the survivors of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. He was enraged by the brutalisation of both his country and fellow Hindustanis by the British. This massacre was the final straw.\n\nHe was furious at, what he saw. The unwillingness of the Indian National Congress which was at that time led by Mahatma Gandhi, to actively protest, leave alone oppose these numerous acts of British terror.\n\nPunjabi people are amongst the most passionate of people. When aroused nothing can restrain them. Udham Singh ji decided that he would dedicate himself to throw off this yoke of oppression.\n\nHe joined the British banned Indian revolutionary 'Gadhar' party. He was arrested and imprisoned by the British in 1927, for possessing revolvers, ammunition, and copies of a prohibited Ghadar Party paper called \"Ghadr-i-Gunj\" (\"Voice of Revolt\")\n\nReleased from prison in 1931 Udham Singh made his way to reach London in 1934, where he found employment as an engineer. His mission was to kill British General Michael O' Dwyer, the former Lieutenant Governor of the Panjab, for his role in role in the ordering and endorsement of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n\n_______________"
