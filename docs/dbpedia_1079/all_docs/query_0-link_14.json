        "text": "CHANDIGARH, India—The coffin of Udham Singh, draped in garlands and carnations, moves slowly along the flat, wet roads of the Punjab. Thousands of Sikhs, bearded and turbaned as always, line the road and surge around the van carrying the coffin of their martyr, who was hanged by the British colonial rulers in 1940, on its final pilgrimage through this northwestern state.\n\nRaising their fists the Sikhs shout in Punjabi: “Udham, Singh forever!” and “Long live Udham Singh!” The hero's long‐delayed cremation — bis remains have been in Britain—will soon take place in his village, Sunam, and the ashes will be scattered in the Ganges, whose holy waters embody the sanctity and mystery of Hinduism.\n\nThe return of the hero's remains has been hailed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and has stirred a turbulent reaction among other Indians as well as among Sikhs at time when a dark mood prevails amid food shortages and unchecked inflation.\n\nFor the Sikhs, who number almost 11 million, of whom about 8.5 million are in the Punjab, the highly publicized return has evoked both pride and self‐examination.\n\n“Udham Singh avenged our national humiliation,” said Giani Zail Singh, Chief Minister of the Punjab, alluding to the political killing for which he was hanged. “He played a role in our liberation. He vindicated our selfrespect and honor.”\n\nThe Sikhs—their name is derived from the Sanskrit word meaning “disciple”—are followers of Guru Nanak (1469–1539). Under nine succeeding gurus, or teachers, a community with its own language and folklore and with its particular monotheistic version of Hinduism, emerged in northwestern India.\n\nMurder Tied to 1919 Massacre\n\nWithin the last week, thousands of Sikhs, the disciples of the 10 gurus, shouted slogans, raised their fists and tossed coins and carnations toward the van. Buglers sounded Last Post. Children in Chandigarh and Ludhiana gripped pictures of Udham Singh, a bearded, dark‐eyed figure, who was executed at the age of 39 for the fatal shooting of Sir Michael O'Dwyer, a former Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab.\n\nUdham Singh killed Sir Michael at Caxton Hall in London on March 13, 1940. In Udham Singh's words, Sir Michael was the “real culprit” in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar on April 13, 1919, when the British opened fire on a demonstration and killed 379 Sikhs, Hindus and Moslems Udham Singh's words before the British ‐ court — which have been repeated here in recent weeks—were:\n\n“He wanted to crush the spirit of my people. So I have crushed him. For a full 21 years I have been trying to wreak vengeance. I am happy I have done the job.”\n\nIt was the Punjabi government under the present Chief Minister, a fervent supporter of Gandhi, that pressed Britain for the return of Udham Singh and organized the ceremonies. There was some grumbling among opposition parties that the gesture was political, timed to bolster the govern ing Congress party among the restless Sikh populace.\n\nBut Mr. Singh, an aggressive 50‐year‐old politician, brushed aside the charge. “Why have we done it now?” he said to a visitor. “It depends on the attitude and ideology of the Government in charge. We felt it was the correct thing.”\n\n“In some ways Udham Singh was a true Sikh,” he said in Punjabi. “The Sikh gurus taught us to be fearless of death. We don't want to die in bed, but on the battlefield, for the nation. We are patriotic. We are fearless. Sikhs don't hate anyone beeause of caste or creed or sex. Everyone is equal. Udliarn Singh was ta true Sikh.”\n\nWhile Sikhism is monotheistic and Hinduism has many gods, the two are linked by, powerful cultural and historical ties. The Sikhs, who avoid the caste barrier's that dominate Hindu society, are set apart by the appearance of the men: beard uncut and hair gathered in a knot at the top of the head and covered with a turban.\n\nPlay an Aggressive Role\n\nOut of an egalitarian, and martial tradition, the Sikhs play an aggressive role in India. They make up 30 per cent of the Indian Army; they are tough, acquisitive businessmen and contractors; their wheat farms are the most successful and provide the bulk of food supplies to the cities.\n\nSince India's independence in 1947, when mutual SikhMoslem slaughter ravaged the divided Punjab, Indian Governments have largely acqui esced to Sikh demands. A key demand was for a Punjabispeaking state with a Sikh majority; it was created in 1966. It's capital, Chandigarh, is shared by the neighboring state of Haryand."
