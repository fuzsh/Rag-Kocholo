        "text": "Udham Singh was an Indian revolutionary who is best known for assassinating Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940. O'Dwyer was responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, in which British troops opened fire on a peaceful gathering of unarmed Indians, killing hundreds.\n\nBirth & Early Life:\n\nSingh was born in 1899 in Punjab, India. He was deeply affected by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and he vowed to avenge the deaths of his countrymen. He joined the Ghadar Party, a revolutionary organization that was dedicated to overthrowing British rule in India.\n\nAVENGING JALLIANWALA MASSACRE:\n\nIn 1927, Singh traveled to England, where he lived under the alias Ram Mohammad Singh Azad. He eventually tracked down O'Dwyer, who was living in London at the time. On 13 March 1940, Singh shot and killed O'Dwyer at a meeting of the East India Association.\n\nDeath:\n\nSingh was arrested and tried for murder. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was hanged on 31 July 1940.\n\nSingh was truly a martyr. He is remembered for his courage and his willingness to sacrifice his own life for the cause of Indian independence. He is also remembered for his commitment to non-violence, even though he ultimately resorted to violence in order to achieve his goals.\n\nSingh is admired for his courage and his commitment to Indian independence, but he is also criticized by others for his use of violence. However, there is no doubt that he was a significant figure in the Indian freedom struggle.\n\nHis reference can be seen in Sardar Udham Singh, a 2021 Indian biographical historical drama film directed by Shoojit Sircar and produced by Rising Sun Films in collaboration with Kino Works. The film stars Vicky Kaushal in the titular role, along with Shaun Scott, Stephen Hogan, Amol Parashar, Banita Sandhu and Kirsty Averton in supporting roles.\n\nSome important facts and instances related to Udham Singh:\n\nHe was born on 26 December 1899 in Sunam, Punjab, India.\n\nHe was a Sikh by faith.\n\nHe joined the Ghadar Party in 1919.\n\nHe traveled to England in 1927.\n\nHe assassinated Michael O'Dwyer on 13 March 1940.\n\nHe was hanged on 31 July 1940.\n\nUdham Singh's life and legacy are a reminder of the sacrifices that were made in the struggle for Indian independence. He was a courageous and dedicated revolutionary who fought for what he believed in, even at the cost of his own life.\n\nALSO READ:"
