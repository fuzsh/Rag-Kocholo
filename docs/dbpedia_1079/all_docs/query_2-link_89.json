        "text": "In my opinion, something of great importance for every punjabi is not only to know what changed our society and people, but also the history behind it. I want to provide a small history of Jallianbagh, and its effects on the two men that I think were responsible for the freedom of India.\n\nJallianwalabagh: Why did it happen? Why were there people there? Do you know the history of this monumentis occasion?\n\nFrom the beginning of the independence movement of India, there were two states that led the fight... Punjab and Bengal. In Punjab, the British admittingly, had a hard time quieting those fighting for the freedom of India. Mainly from revolutionary groups such as the Bhagat Singh's Hindustan Socialist Republican Assoication, but from the general public as well; the British employed insane tactics to keep their stronghold alive.\n\nOne came from religion. Max Macauliffe was appointed deputy commisioner of Punjab, and was told to inact movement to translate Sikhism's Guru Granth Sahib Ji to english and to do it with an agenda. They wanted to break the will of Punjab and he translated the Guru Granth Sahib to English which choose to leave out parts of the religion that signified the unity of all religions and humanity. Even though the British tried, they couldnt break the unity of Punjab.\n\nEventually the Rowlatt Act was entacted by the Government to quell sedation of the press, and to arrest and charge with treason to anybody who questioned the British Rule. To protest this act, Students, composed of Sikhs and Hindus gathered in Amritsar for a peaceful protest. In the first day of the protest, 5000 students gathered not only to protest the act but also for the release of Satya Pal another Indian freedom fighter. WIth the situation becoming more concerning, General Dwyer knew he had to do something.\n\nON Vaisakhi 1919, thousands of student gathered at Jallianwala Bagh, to protest the tyrant British rule. Amongst those men, Udham Singh, an unknown student, and aspiring revolutionary. We all know what happened next... The exits block, the machine guns mounted, the spraying and massacaring of innocent Indian students. Over 1000 dead, hundreds more wounded... General Dwyer was witnessed laughing... According to General Dwyer, he had to \"teach punjab a moral lesson\"...\n\nAmongst the injuried was Udham Singh, and with blood covering his body, he walked over to Harimandir Sahib (Golden Temple) and vowed revenge. He travelled to the US many times to help assist with the revolutionary movement abroad to gain support from powerful indians all over the world. In 1927, he was ordered back by Bhagat Singh, a man now leading the cause for the Indian freedom movement in the north.\n\nIN 1929, Bhagat Singh made his own contribution to the movement. After killing an important british officer, himself and Butkeshwar Dutt threw bombs into the assembly of the British government were it was being decided to fight more revolutionary causes... Bombs were not intended to be deadly, but only a pre-quel to the littering of flyers raining down on the assembly... He would eventually be taken to jail where he led a 63 day fast in the name of Indian freedom. Around 7pm days later, he was eventually hung with his accompliance, and the last words ever uttered by the brave shaheed? \"Inquilab zindabad\" (long live the revolution)\n\nIt would be only 11 years later that Udham Singh, with the blood and anger of Jallianbagh still crawling up his skin, would wake up in the morning, cut a hole out in a book, take a long walk to the town assembly and murder the man responsible for the massacare of Jallianbagh... General Dwyer was last hear saying: \"If I need to do another Jallianwala Bagh to teach them a lesson, I will\"... Singh responded with: You wont get that chance...\n\nMany men could have ran away, or attempted escape. Udham Singh smiled and waited to be apprehended. He did not fear death. As in his eyes, there was no reason for him to live rather than his fellow sutdents who in 1919, had to jump into a well committing suicide as their only option from escaping gun fire. Udham Singh said in his trial if Zetland was dead (reffering to the second man he tried to kill, the secretary of state, lord zetland)? He said, he thought he could of killed more, but there was \"women about\" so he had to be careful...\n\nDuring his trail, Udham Singh was asked his name, and in defiance to british tyranny he replied:\n\nRam Mohammed Singh Azad.... Signifying the unity of Indians, the unification of all three religions.\n\nWho were the real freedom fighters of India? Bhagat Singh? Lala Lajpat Rai? Udham Singh? Why is Gandhi the father of the nation when these mean led the charge for the british to ultimately give up their want to rule and unruly people? The punjabi freedom fighters never get enough credit, as unlike Gandhi, they believed in freedom together regardless of race, religion or creed...\n\nMeistro said:\n\nthanks for posting that summy......Just to add onto that. I also believe that many shaheeds who gave up their lives for India's independance do not get enough recognition for what they did. Instead, the rest of the world remembers gandhi. Why? Why doesnt the rest of the world know who Udham Singh or Bhagat Singh were? Because the rest of the world would see them as terrorists. Anyone who stands up against the oppressor is going to get that label. Thats exactly whats going on in the middle east right now..... Sure, gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistence was something to think about, but using it to defend your country? Its like you're at home and watching TV and somebody breaks into your house. Are you going to use nonviolent resistence and become submissive? He totally used it in the wrong context. Martin Luther king used nonviolent resistence not because he was defending his country, but because he was defending his rights as an equal human being. What saddens me even more was the fact that gandhi apologized to the british government for Shaheed Udham Singh and Shaheed Bhagat Singh's doings.\n\nTheres no question what you are saying is true that Gandhi ended up receiving the majority of the credit, if not all of it. Not to take anything away from the actions of Shaheed Udham Singh or Shaheed Bhagat Singh, but there are reasons for the discouraging of violence during a revolution. There is a saying that is used quite often of \"Violence begets Violence\"...what Gandhi did was an interesting approach to the revolution and one that historians enjoy remembering more because of his unique approach to beating a revolution via nonviolent resistance. There have been revolutions all over the world and the majority of them are violent clashes where eventually the voice of the people is what rises out. The reason for the manipulation of history so as to remember Gandhi more than Shaheed Bhagat Singh and Shaheed Udham Singh is because it is much easier to remember a revolutionary with no blood on their hands, then one with blood on their hands regardless of the circumstances. In each revolution, there is blood spilled on both sides and Gandhi's approach was a completely different spin on what we classically like to label a revolution.\n\n...Let me reiterate that Shaheed Udham Singh's and Shaheed Bhagat Singh's accomplishments are not to be overlooked..there is a fierce pride in myself and I am sure other people of Punjab in their actions, but Gandhi's nonviolent resistance not only caught the attention of the British but also the World. A simple violent battle between those being oppressed and their oppressors would not have drawn nearly as much attention to the region (See African countries on a daily basis). I would like to leave it at the fact that all three revolutionaries deserve equal credit, however there are reasons for the skewed history and the reverence in India as a whole towards Gandhi.\n\n....The historical accounts favoring the face of Gandhi as the face of the revolution...I do not agree with, but I felt that a bit of credit needs to be given to Gandhi...whether you like it or not.\n\nThank you to all those people who read it and have an obvious pride in the history of our freedom fighters. They will only live onl through us, and I am glad that a lot of people understand this.\n\nMeistro and Jeeti are having an awesome coversation. I agree with Miestro 100% when he says Gandhi is given ALL the credit internationally for the independence of India, will Bhagat Singh, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Udham Singh are only Shaheeds to us Punjabi's. What separates them from terrorists in my mind? Terrorists divide their own people, Shaheeds inspire them. For example, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale... Now, I dont like this guy, I never did. He, himself, apprently didnt want to cut India in half, but his actions behind close doors did. He preached sikhi, which I might agree with, but nowhere does in sikhi does it say that violence is our first option. There was no reason to take machine guns in Harimandir Sahib ji. He did reveal an ugly face of the Indian government who silence anyone, regardless of religion. But is he a shaheed? Maybe in Kalyug... Bhagat Singh, Lala Lajpat Rai and Udham Singh united a country the same way Gandhi did..\n\nGandhian philosophy is NOTHING short of remarkable. if you separate the person from the philosophy, you appreciate how if withOUT the non-violence movement, india wouldnt have gotten their freedom either. But Gandhi was a politican too... He had extremely hateful views... He viewed blacks as below Indians, he saw muslims as significantly different than Hindus, sikhs and jains. He was a man who pulled strings behind scenes too... Does he deserve to be looked at as a hero? Not the person, but his philosophy yes. Because if you HELP gain the independence from one of the most powerful empire's in world history, without lifting a hand, you deserve credit..\n\nBut you take Udham Singh, Bhagat SIngh and Rai out of the picture, do Indians have their freedom? NOPE. People forget that these three men inspired a generation. The deaths occured in the 1920's and Udham Singh's in the 1940's... We got our independence in 1947.. These men inspired the younger generation not to bow in the face of tyranny.. They inspired an entire population who' basic moral fibre was to fight against being oppressed. They say India's freedom was born in Punjab and completed in Bengal. Gandhi may have drew the lines of freedom, but wihtout the people of punjab, India would have suffered a LOT longer. Gandhi DID however lower the sacrifice of the Shaheeds. He condemed the actions of the violence movement in Punjab, history shows, that Punjab was the first state to the break the will of the British. It is from there, that the seeds that were planted for independence eventually bloosmed throughout India.\n\nGandhi had to save face. If he applauded the actions of the Punjabi Shaheeds then he would have NEVER been able to be respected for his non-violence. Thats what I mean, Gandhi was a politican. He was a smart man, but a politican. Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh and Lala Lajpat Rai... They did it from the HEART. They didnt want the fame, they wanted the equality for everyone. Gandhi had news conferences. Gandhi had lawyers. Gandhi had a posse. What did Udham Singh have? A book and a gun, AND SHEEDA NE GORAYA DEY JUGG KAMAA KAMAA KE HILLIYAA... Gandhi had friends, Gandhi had international attention.. Bhagat Singh had a pencil, a paper, a dream and a heart.. And he sent waves through the british's spines... They are shaheeds and not political figures like Gandhi.\n\nBut, in some weird way, I am almost glad that Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh, and Lala Lajpat Rai are hero's only to Punjabis and a very select few. They are our hero's. They signify the heart of a punjabi. Gandhi can take the fame, we know as punjabis what these 3 men meant to us..\n\n-----\n\nYeah I know what Naveen said... Gandhi was against all sort of violence, it became a little bit of a show for a while. His problems with Sikhism was with not the religion but with the glorification of violence. That our Guru's were seemingly violent people and how matyrdom is glorified.. He compared it to Islam's culture of matrydom... He was ignorant in that front. Because who did the Guru's save? Humanity. They fougt not for their own, but for others. Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji died for Hindu's and was beheaded by the Mughals. Guru Gobind Singh Jee fought for the same hindus against conversation and released the Dasam Granth Ji telling people to fight not for your own but for others.\n\nGandhi also dissed his own religion but to a lesser extent. He thought that the Mahabharat was over-exaggerated and that the fighting was a mehatphor for something else. There were a lot of people who didnt get along with.\n\n-----\n\nKartar Singh Sarabha. I wrote a post on him in POL, got like no responses. This man was such an educated man, such a revolutionary. He left India for US-Berkley San Fran when he was 16 years old.. He was part of the Ghadr Movement for Indian freedom, something he fell in love after his patrotism grew through the chapter in San Fran. He undertook at a very young age, the gurmukhi and hindi part of the paper. He used to write poems, and letters that would inspire farmers in India, because he, himself came form a long history of farmers.\n\nIN 1913, He jumped onto the stage at one of the movement's after growing tired of the passiveness and yelled: \"Chalo chaliye desh nu yudh karen, eho akhiri vachan tay farman ho gaye\"-- Meaning come lets go to India and join the battle for freedom, the last call has come for us\"... Immediately after the meeting... Kartar Singh packed his bags... He was part of the young generation battling in the face of tyranny... he made his way to India...\n\nHe started his underground tactics by leaving to Bengal, the other hotspot for the independence movement. He secured arms, and weapons deals withthe bengali`s and began to make sure he wouldnt fight alone. he learnt how to make small bombs, and during this time would only eat food from places of worship like mandirs and gurdwaras.\n\nKartar Singh dedicated the rest of his life to the underground movement of Punjabi freedom fighters. He gathered supporters, enlisted people and preached the word for the need of freedom.\n\nThis young man, a chemistry student in the United States left his comfortable life to fight for his country`s freedom. His work... Inspired Lala Lajpat Rai, known as Punjabi Keshari (Lion of Punjab) who was eventually left his politican role to fight amongst the fighters for freedom. When he was murdered by the British for giving his inspirational speeches and fighting tyranny. Rai, influence Bhagat singh, who avenged his death with the shooting, and we all know what happened there...\n\nThe story of India`s freedom from the north is inspiring and how it all connected is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nWow, I can understand why people could be a little mad that Gandhiji got alot of credit for India's independence, but is that any way to treat someone who gave up his life for a united India? Jabar Jung, your post is pretty disgusting and ignorant. Do you even understand Gandhi and what he stood for? I'm positive you dont. I also understand that most of the people on here are Punjabi and have lots of pride in Punjabi freedom fighters. They were strong, fearless, and so very important in their own right. But Gandhi had his own view on how independence should be won and he went about doing it that way. Of course he was not perfect and many disagreed with his views (even i dont like Gandhiji's views on certain topics and i share his last name).\n\nSummy, you are an extremely smart guy and I have alot of respect for what you try and do here and even on POL. But, I will have to question a couple of things (these may arise from my bias as a Gujarati Hindu). In the last sentence of your post, what did you mean by throwing in the \"unlike Gandhi\"? Were you insinuating that Gandhi didn't believe in \"freedom together regardless of race, religion, or creed?\" If you were, I would have to strongly disagree. Gandhi cared so much about keeping his brothers and sisters of INDIA (not just Gujarat or Punjab) together that he was not even happy when India achieved independence because of the impending separation between Pakistan and India. He did LOTS of social work in Gujarat, and did amazing things for the atrocious situation caused by untouchability. At least Bhagat Singh and Udham Singh got the honor of becoming martyrs. Gandhiji was killed by the very people he fought for!!!!! Yes, he did a lot of close call stuff, including criticizing other members of the freedom fight, but those of you that have read Gandhi's journal or any sort of primary source material on him (maybe you have Summy), would know that Gandhi was sorely misunderstood. He cared more about HOW we fought back to the British than whether we did or not. I don't agree what you said Gandhi's views on Muslims were. Many of his fasts took place because of riots between Hindus and Muslims. He wanted them to get along as brothers.\n\nIn the end, the thing that really stands out to me, beyond all of the work that Gandhiji did, was that he gave up an illustrious career as an esteemed (well, as esteemed as a brown man could be in the British empire) lawyer in South Africa just as his practice started to take off to help a country that he loved. He was not a perfect individual (there were very few in history that were), but he had ideals and he fought for them. It makes my blood boil to see pictures like the one posted in this thread. You don't have to feel any connection or love for Gandhiji, but at least respect what he did for us. Yes, in many respects he was a politician, but someone had to be!\n\nSummy, I don't agree that Bhagat Singh is only Punjab's hero. In my family's hometown of Baroda, there is a HUGE statue of Bhagat Singh in one of the marketplaces (Alkapuri). Its even bigger than Gandhiji's statue in the same place. My dad, who is a cardiologist by profession but is a bit of a history freak, reveres Bhagat Singh. My brother and I always got his stories as bedtime stories as children.\n\nAlso, I agree that Punjab and Bengal probably were at the vanguard of the fight for independence (I think Bhagat Singh epitomizes the word \"tejasvita\"...theres no other word to explain him), but Gujarat wasn't far behind. Gandhiji and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel were only the famous freedom fighters from Gujarat. There are many Gujaratis who also gave their lives to the independence movement but really dont get much credit. I don't want this to turn into a history lesson but some of them were Narhari Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya, and Ravi Sankar Vyas.\n\nAlso, this is less of an objection and more of an elaboration...I think one thing that doesn't get enough attention about the British rule of India is their psychological oppression of India. As Summy said, Sikh teachings were instructed to be translated into English and in the process, manipulated to break the will of Punjab. This was not an instruction specific to Punjab. Our Ved-Shashtra (termed Hinduism by the British) were \"translated\" by the British as well. The Veds, Upnishads, the beautiful Puran were all raped in the process of British \"translation.\" Our culture and religion were made a mockery of. These misconceptions created by the British still exist today. It is pretty much what is being taught in schools in the Western world. Those of you that have studied Hinduism in great depth and detail would be appalled at the discrepancies between what is taught in a normal World Religions class and what you would uncover in a primary source study of Hinduism.\n\nAnyways, I normally just silently read on this forum. Even though Guju's have gotten ragged on alot in these forums, I am very proud of who I am and where I come from. Normally I can just shake off hate, it doesn't really faze me. But that picture was way out of line. What have you done thats so great that gives you the right to make a mockery of Gandhi? It's one thing to criticize or question, but to hate on him is pretty out of line in my opinion. What sacrifices in life have you made that gives you the right to take a picture of Gandhiji and do that with it?\n\nSapan said:\n\nWow, I can understand why people could be a little mad that Gandhiji got alot of credit for India's independence, but is that any way to treat someone who gave up his life for a united India?

Don't get Summy wrong though, i don't think he is trying to say that only Punjab played a role the fight for independence. Independence would have not been possible without the help from all the other areas such as Gujrat. I agree that Jabar Jung's post was completely ignorant. Most punjabi people hate Gandhji so much because he was given a chance to prevent the hanging of Bhagat Singh, but failed to do so. Atleast that's how it was depicted in the movies. Summy, maybe you can elaborate on this topic more. Did Gandhiji really refuse to help Bhagat Singh and his associates at all? I would like to think that he at least tried his best to persuade the British not to continue with the executions, I'm sure Gandhiji realized what a huge impact the executions would have on the fight for independence.\n\nSapan, thanks for your compliments and your interest in this. This is why I like BTF because you get contrasting opinions, from people all over the world.\n\nLet me clarify some things to make you see where I am coming from. I defended Gandhi on POL. I like gandhi's mind, his philosophy, he defintely someone to be proud of, however, he is glorified as this moral compass and figure, while he looked down upon people such as Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh, Sukhdev, Lajpat Rai etc...\n\nWhen I said that Mahatma Gandhi didn't want freedom to all, I wasn't referring to Indians, more to his views of being in South Africa, and working as a lawyer there. You must know Gandhi's view on black people. He wrote in his indian op-ed that: \"Kaffirs (blacks) are as a rule uncivilised - the convicts even more so. They are troublesome, very dirty and live almost like animals\".\n\nHe also stated: \"We believe as much in the purity of race as we think they do... We believe also that the white race in South Africa should be the predominating race\"\n\nRegarding Indians and blacks, he believed indians were \"undoubtedly infinitely superior to the Kaffirs\"..\n\nHe supported the blacks being the inferior race in South Africa. He believed they were inferior and didn't deserve freedom. To me, that is what made Gandhi somewhat ethnocentric. The list goes on, I mean he asserted that if he was a Jew in Nazi Germany and they didn't resist that they would have achieved freedom a lot quicker. He compared Indians to Jews in Nazi germany which is faulty to say the least.\n\nNow is he a bad person, no. He did more good then bad, but at times he became more of a preacher, someone who judged others to see whether they should have done what they did or not. To critisize Bhagat Singh for his actions is something that contributes to the rift's between Punjabi's and other Indians regarding Gandhi. I mean, if Gandhi was the revolutionary he said he was, then he should have realized that Bhagat Singh was a person that people looked up for morals, looked to with pride, and to insinuate he was some sort of thug, with a great sense of Patriotism, is something that I dont think a lot of Punjabi's appreciated. He did however say let us bow a thousand times in front of Bhagat Singh for his sacrifice but that was after some inital statements when he was jailed.\n\n---\n\nRegarding Muslims, he did think partition was bad (in public). He also did however facilitate the country of Pakistan. A lot of people, mostly historians thought that this was dangerous because he preached religious unity, so why help Jinnah to make pakistan? However what he did was a concensus amongst Indian people. They believed that the violence from within India ie- muslims v hindus, was something that was threatening India itself. So I can see why he did it but sometimes it confuses me... But when Pakistan was formed he did see a need for the country...\n\nAlso, the whole sleeping with naked girls to \"test\" himself, i dont understand that. That kinda rubs me the wrong way\n\n----------\n\nHaving said that, I am proud of Gandhi. I think his religion played a huge role in his life, and he wasnt afraid to help a country out of ruins to prosperity. Is he the father of our nation? Ummm, I think thats debateable. Is he someone Indians should be proud of? Yeah, defintely.\n\nBhagat Singh is defintely not idolozied the way Gandhi is Sapan, and if we go across your state, Im sure there isnt 1 millionth of amount of things dedicated to Singh. All I am saying is that, it took a thousand hands to create the independence and focusing in on one more than another is sad and not a wholistic approach of the situation\n\nI agree with Summy. I mean what Gandhi did was great and his ideas of nonviolence are great and all but how much progress could that nonviolence have made if there weren't ppl like Bhagat Singh who sacrificed so much.\n\nAlso, I really liked how Summy brought to light the difference between a politician and a hero. Yes, we all believe what Gandhi did as a whole was heroic politician but in a sense he is different from a hero cuz heroes always have a flaw. Heroes are more willing to do what they need to in order to reach a moral goal while in contrast politicians seem forced to always prove flawlessness under what they stand. I believe Gandhi is a good guy and his ideas are great and all but the situation of the Gurus was completely different. Sikhs had also started with nonviolence for an extended period of time, but gradually violence in India grew exponentially and more and more people were being slaughtered. Its good Gandhi stood up for his views but I believe he shouldn't have been so narrow minded on some instances where the greater problem could not be fixed. Haha this is kinda cheesy but one of my US government teachers spoke about how politicians always feel they must stand by a belief and be unchanging. But then he would go on speaking, how much can you trust a person who is unwilling to change his beliefs even a little after gaining more knowledge of the world and everything. Can you say that you have always had the same beliefs all of your life and that nothing will cause them to change? As Summy said even Bhagat Singh changed his views on nonviolence as time went one and he endured more and more in the world. I am not saying Gandhi is one of these people who didn't change cuz to tell u the truth I have not researched Gandhi enough to understand his life and his thinking completely. I am just showing the differences in the thinking of politicians in general and heroes (to me I guess) in general."
