        "text": "The Revolutionary Movement in India\n\nUdham Singh and Bhagat Singh both were sons of India who died for the country. Other than their love for India, they had one more thing in common, the Jalliwanwaala Bagh Massacre had greatly affected both of them.\n\nLegend has it, that Udham Singh was present at the Baagh when the massacre took place and survived it (though many historians debate this claim). It is believed that later during the night after the massacre, he had taken the soil from the Baagh and sworn to kill the men responsible for the massacre.\n\nWhereas Bhagat Singh came to the Baagh 2–3 days later, put a little blood-soaked soil in a glass bottle to take it home with him, and swore to one day throe the British out of India.\n\nThey were both still very young at this time and their lives changed after this incident.\n\nUdham Singh, who was an uneducated & extremely poor orphan kid, did odd jobs here and there to survive while growing up. But deep within his heart, he still had the goal of one day being able to travel to England and kill two men, Michael O’ Dwyer, the then Lt. Governor of Punjab and Gen. Reginald Dyer, the man who ordered troops to open fire on the unarmed men at the Baagh.\n\nHe first worked within Punjab, then in Africa and then moved to the USA after he heard of the Gadhar Party, that saw the fire in him and helped him reach England (but only a few years later).\n\nWhile all this was going on in Udham Singh’s life, Bhagat Singh had become a big name all over India.\n\nHe had formed the Naujawan Bharat Sabha and the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), assassinated J.P. Saunders and had thrown a bomb in the assembly. And hence had become the poster boy of revolution in India and an inspiration to millions of Indian youngsters in and around the world. And Udham Singh was one of them. He was highly inspired by him and considered him his guru.\n\nThere’s this famous story where once Udham Singh took his wallet out, removed the photo of his wife and put a photo of his hero, Bhagat Singh to keep him inspired and to help him keep moving towards his goal. This is how much he loved and respected him.\n\nAnd that’s not all, after he learned about Bhagat Singh’s execution, he said he had lost faith in god and become an atheist.\n\nUdham Singh was deeply saddened by Bhagat’s execution but he did not let it shake or scare him even a bit. On the other hand, it made his commitment to his life-goal stronger than ever before and a few years later, he did achieve it. On 13th March 1940, Udham Singh shot Michael O’ Dwyer down in London. Point-blank range.\n\nWhen the police took him under custody after the incident and asked him his name during the interrogation, he said his name was “Mohammed Singh Aazad”. A name that represented the unity of the Muslims (Mohammed), the Sikhs (Singh) and Hindus (Azad). It was a statement to the British, doesn’t matter how much they tried to create a communal divide, Indian youth still stood for the unity of all religions.\n\nUdham Singh was tried and hanged on 31st July 1940 in England. But he left a legacy that continues to inspire the youth of India."
