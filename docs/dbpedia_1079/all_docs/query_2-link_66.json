        "text": "The third and most obvious reason the British are to blame for the massacre is that the British soldiers fired into the crowd. When Hugh Montgomery was knocked down by a chunk of ice, he stood up and fired into the crowd (Aron 24). The other soldiers soon fired as well. The gunfire killed five people. Crispus Attucks, Samuel Gray, and James Caldwell died at the scene. Samuel Maverick died a few hours later, while Patrick Carr survived for nine days before dying of his wounds (Olson). Samuel Gray was killed by a single ball entering his head, Crispus Attucks was killed by two balls entering his chest, and James Caldwell was killed by two balls entering his back (“Boston”). Benjamin Frizell, who was standing near the west corner of the Custom House before and at the time of the gun discharges, declared that the first discharge was of only one gun, the second discharge was of two guns, the third discharge was of three guns, immediately followed by the fourth and final discharge of five guns (“Boston”). He also declared that of the final discharge, two were from soldiers on the ground on Preston’s right side, but three discharges came from the balcony, or the chamber window, as the flashes appeared on the left side of Preston, and higher than the flashes of the other two discharges. This information shows that at least three soldiers were on the balcony and carefully took aim and\n\nIt is easy to picture nearly the entire column, which was marching from Fort William Henry to Fort Edwards, being slaughtered when you hear the story. When 1600 armed, Indian warriors are attacking a defenseless, panicked column of about 2400 people (including women & children), there is not much left to the imagination how things happened. In reality, however, it did not happen the way that the most people think it did. Colonel Monro's own estimations were that 129 were killed and wounded among the British troops. Regarding the colonial militia, he said, \"No Regular Accot Could be got from the Provincials but their Numbers Kill'd Could not be Less than Four Officers & about 40 Men. And very near as many Men Wounded.\" There is no doubt some killing occurred, but in the big\n\nMore than 200 homes were destroyed. 185 miles of roads and15 miles of railways were damaged. Ash clogged sewage systems, damaged cars and buildings, and temporarily shut down air traffic over the Northwest. According to YourkVid” “The Nurses were crying because immerse me in a tub of water and take sponges and scrape out my wounds. And when the doctor came in he said you did not do a good enough job. They had to take me back a second time, they had to put me on morphine at that point I was in such pain.\n\nContrary to the article’s title, Netflix is not the cause of the cultural echo chamber. It is hardly even a symptom. Our proclivity for personalized selection on Netflix is moreso indicative of egocentrism and the simple fact that people have different interests. What Farhad Manjoo suggests in this article is that the digital age has isolated us in our thought processes, but that is not the case. We have chosen to isolate ourselves.\n\nThe battle had finally swung in favor of the Americans for a brief moment. The amount of casualties the NKPA took is unclear however, the NPKA realized that a frontal attack on the hill in which Task Force Smith sat was not feasible. (Ibid, pg 73) Despite the heavy casualties, the NPKA held their position and waited for reinforcements. When the reinforcements arrived, they were able to flank the depleted Task Force and rout-out the American position with an overwhelming force. Task Force Smith had quickly been over ran and most of the casualties came from the withdraw as the American soldiers were exposed to enemy fire. When the fighting had concluded, the Americans returned with 250 soldiers on the American occupied territory by the end of\n\nAlthough it was since proved that many were there to celebrate the Baisakhi festival. Never in all the British Empire’s history had they used military force against a crowd of unarmed people, which resulted in such a vast loss of life. One official report, clearly from the British, counted 319 dead and over 1200 wounded, but with reasonable beliefs, the Indians estimate a much higher dead count (Pletcher, n.d.; Sayer, 1991). To back-up, everything just said a painting of the massacre, which can be found at Amritsar as a memorial, shows the long-lasting effects the massacre had on India as a whole (Painting of Amritsar massacre picture, n.d). After the massacre, many had different reactions, some believing Dyer should be praised for his action and some completely disgusted with his actions. Herbert Asquith, the liberal Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, clearly believed that the massacre was catastrophic and sinful, \"there has never been such an incident in the whole annals of Anglo-Indian history nor, I believe, in the history of our Empire from its very inception down to the present day ... It is one of the worst outrages in the whole of our history\" (Sayer, 1991). Though all Dyer could say in his defence was “my duty… my horrible, dirty duty.” (Sayer, 1991). This shows\n\nThe decision to engage in terrorism can occur for many reasons: logical choice, political strategy, ennui with the elite, and lack of opportunity for political participation. Air India flight 182 was a flight operating on from Montreal-India. On 23 June 1985, the airplane operating on the route was blown up in midair by a bomb in Irish airspace in the single deadliest terrorist attack involving an aircraft to that date. Two men were known to have left two pieces of luggage for check in, but never boarded the flight. The incident represents the largest mass murder in modern Canadian history. 329 civilians died on the flight, over 270 Canadians. The bombing was the joint project of at least two Sikh terrorist groups with extensive membership in Canada, USA, England and India. Their anger had been sparked by an attack on the Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine in Amritsar in June 1984. Sikh militants were seen preaching that \"Indian planes will fall from the sky\" and urging his followers to \"kill 50,000 Hindus.\" (Sikh extremism enters mainstream Canadian politics, 2007)."
