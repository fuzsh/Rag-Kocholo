        "text": "Dr. Ramjilal, Social Scientist, Former Principal, Dyal Singh College , Karnal (Haryana –India)\n\nE-Mail .id drramjilal1947@gmail.com\n\nMob.8168810760\n\n(Asian Independent)- India’s revolutionary martyr Amar Shaheed Udham Singh was born on 26 December 1899 (Jammu Gotra of Kamboj caste) at Sunam village of the Patiala State (Now Punjab). But some scholars, ignoring historical facts, linked Udham Singh to the “Dalit Sikh family”. Shamsul Islam, a former professor and prominent scholar at Delhi University, is among these scholars. In his article ‘Sanjhi Sahadat, Sanjhi Virasat’s Discontinued Gaurav Yatra’, Shamsul Islam wrote, ‘The famous revolutionary Udham Singh was born in a Dalit family.’ (Samyantar, Year 50, Issue 9, June 2019, Page 29.). Former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Ms. Mayawati had named Udham Singh Nagar District (Now Uttarakhand )by linking Udham Singh with the ‘Chamar caste.’ Some writers also tag the Saini caste with Udhm Singh. Similarly, the book “The Patient Assassin, A True Tale of Massacre, Revenge and the Raj,’’ inked by Anita Anand (Simon and Schuster, UK: April 2019) — is a book based on the life of Indian revolutionary Udham Singh. The month of publication coincides with the 100th anniversary of the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre in Amritsar(13 April 1919).In this book, Anita Anand clearly stated that Udham Singh belonged to the “low caste” and called the supreme martyr called the supreme martyr as ‘The Patient Assassin’ as per the title of the book.\n\nThe common belief is that Udham Singh took revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 by killing Brigadier General Reginald Dyer. Such a belief has also been propagated in the famous popular film, ‘Rang De Basanti’, but it is against historical fact and misleading. The historical fact is that Brigadier General Reginald Dyer died in 1927. whereas, on 24 March 1940, thirteen years later, Udham Singh shot dead Michael O’ Dwyer, who was then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab and the main planner of the Jallianwala massacre. This historical blunder is committed by scholars, writers, poets, singers, and politicians. The false and fabricated propaganda highly influences the public at large\n\nUdham Singh’s father’s name was S. Tahal Singh and his mother’s name was Mrs. Narain Kaur. His parents named him Sher Singh. At that time no one had any idea that in the future this child Sher Singh would be at the forefront of the world-famous revolutionaries and would be a proud and golden page of Indian revolutionary history. There was also a brother of Sadhu Singh who baptized Mukta Singh. Their father was a railway watchman at the railway crossing in Upali village. They were born in a poor family and the mountain of troubles broke when their mother (1901) and father (1907) passed away during their childhood. As a result, after the death of their parents, there was no one to take care of them. Bhai Kishan Singh Ragi admitted both the brothers – Sher Singh and his elder brothere-Sadhu Singh to the Central Khalsa Orphanage, Putlighar, Amritsar. According to the customs and traditions of Sikhism in the orphanage, both brothers were baptized. Sher Singh was named Udham Singh (Udham means Upheaval – “cataclysm), and Sadhu Singh was re-bapitised Mukta Singh.( Mukta means- who escaped reincarnation). In his orphanage, Udham Singh was called by his friends as ‘Ude.’ While staying in this orphanage, Udham Singh passed the matriculation examination in 1918. While studying in the orphanage school, Udham Singh took training in arts and crafts. This influenced his thinking and learned that any goal can be achieved with hard work and determination.\n\nAfter his matriculation In 1918, he voluntarily joined the British Indian Army. He was posted in the lowest-ranking labor unit with the 32nd Sikh Pioneers. He worked less than six months on restoration on the railway field from the coast up to Basra and Baghdad. But due to their young age and disputes with officers, he was allowed to return to his native land–Punjab. After one year he came back to the Central Khalsa Orphanage, Amritsar in 1919. During almost one year of his military service, he carried out carpentry and general maintenance of machinery and vehicles. This historical fact of his life is not known to most of the people.\n\nAfter the death(1917) of his brother Sadhu Singh( Mukta Singh), his life became completely lonely, and his indomitable courage to face hardships and boundless will to struggle. This feeling inspired him to break through the clouds of immense suffering and move toward his goal.\n\nAmar Shaheed Udham Singh’s thoughts, ideas, philosophy of life, principles, and actions had many influences over time. The death of his parents and brother, his lonely life, the poverty of the family, and the miserable conditions of life in the orphanage made him a psychologically courageous, struggling, and militant young man. But the most important influence on his political thinking was the planned massacre of Jallianwala Bagh on 13 April 1919.\n\nOur learned readers need to know the background of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. During the First World War (1914-1918), the British government said that the war was being fought for the sake of democracy. Indians provided unprecedented assistance to the British government. From 1914 to 1916, the number of Punjab soldiers out of 1,92,000 Indian soldiers was 1,10,000. The public not only provided soldiers but also gave Rs 2 crore as war contribution and Rs 10 crore on interest. During the First World War, the British imperialist government took donations from the Indian people both voluntarily and forcibly. Due to the death of 43,000 soldiers in the World War, the economic condition of the military families became very bad. During the war, forceful collection of war donations from the public, unprecedented inflation, unemployment, starvation, debt to the public, epidemic, imbalanced monsoon, and economic recession, the ever-increasing influence of the revolutionary movement led by the Ghadar Party on the Punjabi youth and the Pan-Islamic Movement in Turkey, the feeling of dissatisfaction among the Indian public was at its peak.\n\nThe government imposed the Anarchical and Revolutionary Criminal Act, 1919 (Rowlatt Acts as of 1919) to suppress dissent. The government was given powers to control the press, stop independent movements, put leaders in jail without trial, arrest without warrants, special tribunals, etc. The slogan of ‘No appeal, no plea, no lawyer’ spread across India against these black laws and echoed in every house from villages to the capital of the country- New Delhi.\n\nThese’ black laws’ were opposed most vigorously in Punjab also. Every year 13 April is celebrated as Vaisakhi Day in Punjab. As a result, on 13 April 1919, about 20,000 people held a peaceful meeting in Jallianwala Bagh( Near the Golden Temple—the most sacred Temple of the Sikh religion in the world) to celebrate Vaisakhi and protest against the Rowlatt Acts. Based on a well-planned plan, Brigadier General Reginald Edward Dyer went to the gathering place at 5.15 pm with a contingent of soldiers and ordered to open fire without warning. The military contingent fired approximately 1650 bullets and the firing continued until the bullets were exhausted. According to Dr. Smith, a Civil Surgeon of Amritsar, about 1800 people died in about 15 minutes. Among those who died were 41 boys and a 6-week-old girl. About, 1200 people were injured in this massacre. It is further stated that 581 persons were prosecuted by the British Government and out of them, 108 persons were given the death penalty, 265 persons were given life imprisonment, 85 persons were imprisoned for seven years each, and the remaining were humiliated. The bloody brutality, cruelty, and inhuman massacre that followed was the first example of the 20th century. As a result of the planned massacre of the Jallianwala Bagh, public anger was at its peak all over India. There was a turning point in the mass movements- the struggles of farmers and laborers, and the national movement. In other words, British imperialism was heading towards decline\n\nThe voices against the organized and pre-planned massacre also echoed in the House of Commons of England. In the House of Commons, while addressing members(M.Ps) Winston Churchill vecifocially criticized the Amritsar Massacre as a ‘slaughter’, a “monstrous event”, “an episode…without precedent or parallel in the modern history of the British Empire.” According to AJP Taylor (British historian), the massacre was “the decisive moment when Indians were alienated from British rule”. The faith of the Indian masses in the British Imperial government was at its lowest ebb and the anger and alienation were at the sky.\n\nUdham Singh himself had witnessed the entire massacre and it left an indelible impact on his mind and heart. As a result, the flame of revenge continued to burn till the gallows of death. While following the theory ‘revenge blood with blood’, he vowed to kill then the Lt. Governor General Dyer and to destroy British imperialism.\n\nApart from the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Udham Singh’s thinking was also influenced by famous revolutionaries and national leaders. Besides, Swami Shraddhanand, the famous leader of Gadar Party Lala Hardayal, Professor Mota Singh, Lala Lajpat Rai, Sardar Basant Singh, Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna, Kartar Singh Sarabha, Sardar Ajit Singh, Sardar Swarn Singh and Dr. Saifuddin. Kitchlu played a vital and significant role in shaping Udham Singh’s ideology and philosophy. But, the most influential was the impact of revolutionary Bhagat Singh. He considered Bhagat Singh as his friend and guru. This is why, describing the impact of the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev on 23 March 1931, he wrote a letter to his friend Johal from Bristol Jail on 20 March 1940, ‘It was 10 years ago when my best friend Bhagat Singh left me behind and I have full faith that I will meet him after my death because he is waiting for me. That was the 23rd and I hope that I will also be hanged on the same date.’’\n\nBesides Bhagat Singh’s thinking, there was also an influence of the Babbar Akali wave on the thinking of Udham Singh because he had worked among the ‘Babas’ and during his stay in America, he not only met the leaders and workers of the Gadar Party but also got acquainted with their functioning was also affected. Apart from all these persons and ideologies, Udham Singh’s thinking was also influenced by Marxism, Leninism, and Bolsheviks. In July 1927, Rambagh Udham Singh of Amritsar was arrested under Section 20 of the Arms Act. The newspaper of the banned Gadar Party, Gadre Goonj, was also found with him, which was confiscated. This is the reason why he has been called a ‘Sikh Punjabi Marxist’. The Bolsheviks of Russia were also his source of inspiration. He was also greatly influenced by Baba Jawala Singh’s book ‘Gadar’.\n\nTo carry out revolutionary activities, revolutionaries have to assume many forms and names so that they cannot be identified. Like Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh also changed his name and dress from time to time to hide his identity. As a result, he abandoned the symbols of Sikhism and became ‘clean shaven’ and hats and smart suits have also been a part of his attire. He kept many names – Sher Singh, Uday Singh, Udham Singh Kamboj, Frank Brazil, and Ram Mohammad Singh Azad. Ram Mohammad Singh Azad is a symbol of communal harmony, secularism, tolerance, and Ganga-Jamuna culture and Punjabiyat. Ram is from the Hindu religion. Mohammad belongs to Islam religion and Singh belongs to the Sikh religion. This Punjabiyat – in other words, by combining three religions with its name, tried to inspire nationalism, secularism, national unity, and harmonious relations among different religions. Its name rose above the small narrow-mindedness of religion, caste and region, nationalism, and secularism. In the present context where the slogans of fundamentalism are echoing, this is a very relevant name. It is a critical time that people should free themselves from narrow-mindedness and contribute to the development of society and nation so that people can get minimum facilities, shelter, clothing, employment, education, and health facilities, get freedom from hunger and India can become a prosperous nation as was the dream of revolutionaries like Udham Singh.\n\nAmar Shaheed Udham Singh traveled to many countries to achieve his objective. Among these countries, Africa (1920), Nairobi (1921), America (1922), Germany (1933) and finally England (1934) are the main ones. Singh succeeded in going to Africa in the year 1920. At that time, the policy of apartheid (discrimination between whites and blacks) was widespread in Africa. It had a deep impact on the thoughts of Udham Singh. During his stay in Africa, he worked in a railway workshop and mastered the English language. He became a good speaker and an expert in the English language. There was an unprecedented change in Udham Singh’s thinking and personality during his three-year stay in South Africa.\n\nAfter returning to India, he rented a house in Amritsar in the name of Ram Mohammad Singh Azad. While living in Amritsar, he came in contact with other revolutionaries including Bhagat Singh, and started playing an active role as an active member of Punjab Youth Sabha. Udham Singh’s house became a hub of revolutionary activities. In 1924, Udham Singh succeeded in going to America. During his stay in America, he came into contact with Gadar Party revolutionary leader Lala Hardayal.\n\nRegarding Udham Singh, it is believed that he was unmarried. According to Sikandar Singh, during his stay in America, Udham Singh met a beautiful and big-eyed girl named Leope in California. He married Leope. Udham Singh accepted a statement that he had two sons. Both of them studied at Sacramento School in Claremont. Both of those children were called India’s Sons in the school. In 1935, Udham Singh’s wife passed away and his two sons were taken to Arizona (USA) by their mother’s relatives.\n\nAs per the instructions of Bhagat Singh, in July 1927, Udham Singh came to India along with 25 revolutionaries including Asleh. On 30 August 1927, he was caught possessing illegal weapons and banned literature – Gadr-e-Goonj (Voice of Revolt) and was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment under Section 20 of the Arms Act. At this time, the revolutionary movement was in its full sway and Bhagat Singh Rajguru and Sukhdev were hanged on 23 March 1931 due to the death sentence in the Saunders murder case. Bhagat Singh was the heartbeat of the youth. He was the flame of revolution in India. After being released from jail on 23 October 1935, he started preparing for his final objective – to kill Michael O’Dwyer. In 1935, he was successful in going to Germany via Kashmir. To achieve the success of his objective, Udham Singh went to Germany. , passing through countries like France, Italy, Austria, etc., and finally succeeded in going to London in 1934. He rented a house at 9- Adler Street, Commercial Road-E, London. It is worth noting that he dodged the police. The passport to be given was in the name of Ram Mohammad Singh Azad.\n\nHistorians believe that Udham Singh was not alone in his mission. He also had the support and guidance of Subhash Chandra Bose, Rash Bihari Bose, revolutionary Abdullah Sindhi, and Raja Mahendra Pratap. The aim of the revolutionaries was that Udham Singh would kill Michael O’Dwyer by shooting him and prove that the Indians were not with the British in the Second World War.\n\nThe common belief is that Udham Singh took revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 by killing General O’Dwyer. Such a belief has also been propagated in the famous popular film ‘Rang De Basanti’. It is against historical fact and misleading. Brigadier General Dyer had died in 1927. Udham Singh had killed Michael O’Dwyer, who was then the Governor of Punjab and the main planner of the Jallianwala massacre. Udham Singh kept moving towards his goal. On 13 March 1940, 21 years after the Jallianwala massacre (13 March 1919), Udham Singh got the opportunity to realize his plan when the East India Association and the Royal Central Asian Conference were held in London. A meeting was jointly organized by the Society to express views on the topic ‘Current situation of Afghanistan and Muslim countries’. This meeting was presided over by the Secretary of Indian Affairs, Lord Zetland. Sir Michael O’Dwyer (1913-1919), the Governor of Punjab, had insulted Indians by calling them ‘vile and vampires’ in his speech. Speaker of the Assembly Lord Zetland also criticized the Indians. Udham Singh had gone to the auditorium with a pistol hidden in a book named ‘Frank Brazil’ and was standing against the wall. As soon as the meeting ended, Udham Singh shot Michael O’Dwyer twice from a distance of 3 yards and he died on the spot. Apart from this, Lewis Dane, Lawrence, Charles C. Bailey, Lord Zetland, and Lord Lamington, who were sitting on the stage, were also shot but survived. Lord Lamington’s left hand was shattered and he fell face down on the floor. Zetland did not suffer any serious injuries. There was a stampede in the auditorium due to the sound of bullets. Although Udham Singh could have taken advantage of this opportunity to run away, he did not do so. His parents named him Sher Singh in his childhood and by surrendering himself before the police, he proved that he was indeed the Lion of India.\n\nMurder of Michael O’Dwyer and Reaction in India\n\nThere was a mixed reaction of Indians towards the murder of Michael O’ Dwyer was mixed in India. Mahatma Gandhi wrote in Harijan newspaper on 15 March 1940 that ‘I am deeply saddened by this violent incident and called it ‘madness’. When Mahatma Gandhi’s statement was criticized by the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army, Mahatma Gandhi wrote in the Harijan newspaper (23 March 1940) that ‘Convict Udham Singh is addicted to the thought of bravery’. Jawaharlal Nehru expressed ‘deep sorrow’ over the murder of Michael O’Dwyer in the National Herald on March 15, 1940. But later, according to a statement published in the Daily Dainik Pratap in 1962, Jawaharlal Nehru said: “I salute Shaheed-i-Azam Udham Singh with reverence who had kissed the noose so that we may be free.” On the other hand, according to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Udham Singh ‘turned out to be trustworthy and as per plan, he played the right role in my revolutionary step.’\n\nAmong Indian newspapers, The Tribune, (Lahore,) was the first to praise Udham Singh’work.On 14 March 1940, while praising Udham Singh it was written, ‘Udham Singh has acted bravely’. Amritsar Patrika (Kolkata- March 18, 1940) wrote: “O’ Dwyer’s name is connected with Punjab incidents which India will never forget. The Tribune, (Lahore,) published on 14 March 1940, ‘Udham Singh has acted bravely’. According to the report of the Home Ministry of the Government of India abroad, O’Dwyer’s death has given ‘Indians great satisfaction’ and Udham Singh is indeed a ‘warrior of freedom’.By killing Michael O’Dwyer Udham Singh ignited the spirit of enthusiasm among the Indians.\n\nReactions of International Press\n\n.Udham Singh was criticized by friendly countries. But, at the same time, England’s famous newspaper, The Times (London) called him a “fighter for freedom”. It, further, wrote that his actions were “an expression of the pent-up fury of the downtrodden Indian people’’. Udham Singh and his bravery were praised by the Axis powers – Germany, Italy, and Japan. According to German Radio, ‘Indians, like elephants, never forgive their enemies. He can take revenge even after 20 years. The Bergeret, a newspaper published from Rome, described this incident as ‘of great importance’ and praised Udham Singh’s action as ‘courageous’. Berliner Borsen Zeitung has addressed this incident as ‘an example of Indian independence’.\n\nTrial and Execution of Udham Singh\n\nOn 1 April 1940, Udham Singh was formally charged with the murder of Michael O’Dwyer, He was remanded in custody at Brixton Prison. While explaining his motive for murdering Michael O’ Dwyer. He bravely stated :\n\n“I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved it. I don’t belong to society or anything else. I don’t care. I don’t mind dying. What is the use of waiting until you get old? … Is Zetland dead? He ought to be. I put two into him. I bought the revolver from a soldier in a public house. My parents died when I was three or four. Only one dead? I thought I could get more.’’\n\nWhile in jail he went on a 42-day hunger strike and was forcibly fed. In the Central Criminal Court, Oldballe, Udham Singh was tried . On 4 June 1940, his trial commenced at the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey, before Justice Cyril Atkinson, with V.K. Krishna Menon and St John Hutchinson representing him. G. B. McClure was the prosecuting barrister.\n\nWhile pleading the case, his lawyer V.K. Krishna Menon stated that Udham Singh had no intention of murdering Michael O’Dwyer. Threatening the lawyer, Udham Singh said: “My lawyer is lying to save my life… It is not the tradition of revolutionaries to make excuses to save my life. I want to light the flame of revolution with my sacrifice”. Udham Singh further said: “On the day of Jallianwala Bagh massacre, I had pledged that I will avenge this blood. I am happy that today, exactly 20 years and 11 months after this incident, I have fulfilled my vow by risking my life.”\n\nOn the day of his conviction, he came out as a great revolutionary. While addressing the judge he started his speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism and the ruler’s civilization and used the terminologies—‘brutality and blood thirsty’, ‘die with shame’, and’ bastard blood’. He bravely stated:\n\n“I say down with British Imperialism. You say India does not have peace. We have only slavery. Generations of so-called civilization have brought us everything filthy and degenerating known to the human race. All you have to do is read your history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .”\n\nAfter the disruption by the judge he, further, said that he was not afraid of death. Very bravely he stated:\n\n“I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all. I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I am dying for a purpose. Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed, we are suffering from the British Empire. (He continued more quietly) I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country…I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism will be smashed…Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and Christianity flies.… Your conduct, I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist Government…You people are suffering the same as I am suffering through those dirty dogs and mad beasts. Everyone is suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery. Killing, mutilating, and destroying– British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India…You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in India.” At the end of his speech like other revolutionaries, he exclaimed. “Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!”Lastly, he spat across the solicitor’s table. On 31 July 1940, Udham Singh was hanged in Pentonville Jail.\n\nThe main objectives of Udham Singh were to liberate India, establish Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh unity, and fundamentally eliminate poverty, ignorance, and illiteracy. Udham Singh wrote from Pentoville jail on 15 July 1940, what should be the future India of his dreams? According to Udham Singh, “The great duty of all of us is to drive out the British from the holy land of the country. After that, to establish Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh unity, hunger, ignorance, illiteracy, and disease, the public should get justice, and the farmers… And the laborer gets enough food. There should be good schools and colleges for the students and beautiful playgrounds and grand gardens for the children and the elderly. It is my strong wish that the money that Indians spend on prosecutions, external affairs, or the grandeur of marriages should be spent on higher education instead of that. Do. With this, I am sure that you people will try to assess these values. May my country progress.”\n\nTo achieve his goals, Udham Singh considered revolution as ‘his birthright’. He said in court ‘I have seen people suffering and dying under the British Empire in India. Whatever I did was to protest. I have done this as a matter of duty, it was my duty. Especially for my beloved country, I don’t care at all about what punishment I will get in this regard – 10, 20, or 60 years of imprisonment or the gallows. I didn’t want to kill any innocent person. I only wanted to protest’. He wrote to his friend on March 30, 1940, ‘I am not afraid of death, I have to fight in every situation and for that I am ready at all times. I am not afraid of death. I am going to marry soon and die. I have no regrets at all’’.\n\nAlthough the main objective of Amar Shaheed Udham Singh and other revolutionaries was not only to achieve political freedom but also to build such an India in which there would be no hunger, poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, ignorance, economic exploitation, economic and social inequality, etc But even today In India, poverty, inflation, unemployment, ignorance, illiteracy, economic exploitation, economic and social inequality, political criminalization, communalism, caste discrimination, miserable condition of Dalits and exploited tribals, increasing atrocities on women, police, criminals, politicians, and bureaucracy. Growing alliances, political corruption, the dominance of multinational companies in the political system, and the ‘Mudan Sanskar’(Hair-cutting-NPA) of government banks, all these are against the thinking of the revolutionaries. These are the main reasons that the thoughts of Shaheed-e-Azam Udham Singh are relevant even today."
