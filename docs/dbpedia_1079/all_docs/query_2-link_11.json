        "text": "Synopsis\n\nHistorian Yasmin Khan narrates another incident of revenge, on the 25th anniversary of Indira Gandhi's assassination.\n\nIn the early evening of 13 March 1940, a seventy-four year old man was shot dead. The man was Sir Michael O���Dwyer and his assassin was Udham Singh. O���Dwyer ��� who had been the governor of Punjab at the time of the Amritsar massacre in 1919 was taking part in a discussion on the future of Afghanistan.Udham Singh shot him twice in the chest with a revolver and the former Raj official died shortly afterwards.\n\nThis was retribution for his role in imposing martial law and defending the perpetrators of the Jallianwalla Bagh killings at the end of the First World War, carried out almost exactly twenty one years later. The impact of the Caxton Hall assassination lay in the fact that it was carried out in the heart of Westminster; a stone���s throw from Westminster Abbey, within minutes of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nThe assassination seemed to shrink the distance between Amritsar and London, collapsing time between 1919 and 1940. It brought back to the newspapers, and to many memories, the bloody scenes at Jallianwalla Bagh, where hundreds of innocent men, women and children had died. The grand surroundings of the Tudor Room, with its heavy drapes, and wooden beamed ceiling was the setting of a murder that evoked those horrific event thousands of miles away in Punjab.\n\nResistance to the Raj had literally reached the epicentre of the British empire. Two worlds had collided. The room was packed with around two hundred people, among them many of the bespectacled and besuited grandees of the British establishment in tweeds and pinstripes. They had gathered to hear a lecture by Sir Percy Sykes on ���Afghanistan: the Present Position.���\n\nWell heeled and well travelled this was a select crowd of members of the Royal Society of Asian Affairs. Many were retired civil servants and administrators, keen to hear about lands in Asia where they had served many years before. Others were majors, doctors, former provincial governors and their wives. Among them sat the splendidly named Miss Bertha Herring who would soon rugby tackle Udham Singh to the ground after he had fired the fatal shots, stout, in her sixties, an active member of the association and of the local church in Ascot. The most important guest was Lord Zetland, the Secretary of State for India, who chaired the meeting.\n\nUdham Singh, in a trilby and blue lounge suit, must have been conspicuous in this crowd. There is little doubt that the assassin was something of a dandy: an earlier passport photo shows him in a crisp white shirt, striped tie and with a carefully clipped moustache framing his full mouth.\n\nAfter his arrest, the police found coloured handkerchiefs, Russian roubles, a silver watch and cigarettes among his possessions. Looking at him, few could have imagined his origins and experiences ��� the loss of all his immediate relatives to disease while a young child, years spent in an orphanage in Amritsar, the ducking and diving through prisons and legal systems, the aliases and different passports, the numerous affairs with women, scraping a living from handouts and odd jobs, living, quite literally, ���on the edge��� in Europe, North America and Britain.\n\nIt is hard to disentangle truth from fiction, and the myth of Udham Singh has been well-inflated by political activists, writers and film-makers. The false leads and strange assumptions in the notebooks of detectives and policemen have also muddied the picture. Did he make it as far as Russia? What was his connection with Irish nationalists?\n\nCommunists, socialists, anarchists, Punjabi Indian nationalists and Sikh separatists have all claimed him as a hero. The British refusal to open archives relating to the assassination until the 1990s also increased his mystique. He may have had links to ��� or sympathy with several movements but the hard evidence remained scanty: present day political needs were projected back onto his ghost.\n\nThe mysteries around Singh���s life have done his reputation no harm. Born at the turn of the century, he received a fair education in the Central Khalsa orphange in Amritsar after his destitute father died. Was he actually a young man in the crowd when the shooting at Amritsar took place? It���s said that he was giving out drinking water to the parched crowds on the day of the Amritsar killings. He claimed to have been there, and some say that a scar on his arm was the result of an injury received that day.\n\nHis life seems marked by rootlessness and a restless struggle to settle on questions of political and personal identity, with sojourns in North America, Europe and the UK. At different stages of his life his aliases included the names Sher Singh, Udham Singh, Udhan Singh, Ude Singh, Uday Singh, Frank Brazil, and Ram Mohammed Singh Azad. Was he a revolutionary warrior or an oddball and fantasist?\n\nThere can be little doubt that he was violently opposed to British imperialism. When Scotland Yard did finally release the files on his trial they revealed his reaction when the judge gave the verdict: he spat and swore ���against the King and Emperor��� and declared that he wasn���t afraid of death and that when he had gone ���thousands of (my) countrymen would drive you dirty dogs out of my country.���\n\nBut the story of his life poses interesting challenges for the historian interested in ���facts��� ��� for the stories about Singh are fragmented and seem sometimes only to take sustenance from their repetition. Some say he fraternised with members of the Ghadar party ��� the ambitious revolutionary movement started in North America which struggled for India���s liberation from British imperialism during the First World War ��� and met members of IRA in Britain.\n\nIn 1927 he was jailed in Amritsar for keeping illicit ammunition in his possession. He was given a passport nonetheless and travelled widely in Europe, arriving back in Britain around 1934. In the 1930s he moved from place to place, perhaps earning his keep as an itinerant peddlar of hosiery and lingerie, and he may also have worked as a handyman, driver and mechanic.\n\nHe knew Indians in Coventry and Southampton, appears to have liked going to bookshops and to Indian restaurants. He also made some cash as a film extra in crowd scenes. But in the conditions of depression-era England, it was probably far from a glamourous existence.\n\nThis assassination, then, was not a straightforward story of nationalist heroism in conflict with British imperialism. By 1940, the political picture was too complex to allow that. Gandhi was weighing up the question of a renewed satyagraha, and the Lahore resolution, demanding Pakistan, would soon be placed on the table. Indian constitutional negotiations were imminent and the Congress leadership feared losing the upper hand and the moral high ground if they associated too closely with an assassin.\n\nIn the context of war ��� when nightly blackouts were taking place, rationing had begun and the battles over France and the Low Countries were imminent ��� India���s role in the war was a matter of great sensitivity and anxiety. From the British perspective, there was a lack of comprehension about India���s resistance and the public did not equate British imperialism with Nazi fascism, although to many Indians this was not far-fetched. As the London-based Congress activist Krishna Menon put it in a pamphlet for the India League, ���Indian opinion has always been opposed to fascism and Nazism, but it does not see them as separate or even essentially different from imperialism.���\n\nThere was a risk of Udham Singh���s case being used for Nazi propaganda and, indeed, within hours of the news, the British Nazi, Lord Haw Haw was broadcasting on the subject from Berlin. From the British administration���s point of view, O���Dwyer���s assassination came at a bad time.\n\nNehru made ambiguous statements, generally displeased by the killing, while Gandhi made his outright condemnation clear, sending condolences to O���Dwyer���s family. Reactions in the Indian press to the murder were also decidedly ambivalent while the British Indian community in London ��� well networked through the restaurants, hotels and political groups in the capital ��� was split down the middle.\n\nSome members of the British public wrote letters pleading against the death penalty for Singh; Joyce Tarring wrote to the Secretary of State for India from a hotel in Cumberland to say that ���it would be a great act of clemency which would touch the heart of India.��� Another woman from Hampstead was concerned that ���there is a real danger of this affair being misinterpreted in India.��� Edward Thompson also urged the Secretary of State for India to show leniency.\n\nUdham Singh was hung in Pentonville prison on July 31, 1940. His story ��� full of ambivalences, exaggerations and glorification ��� lives on to the present day. His importance as a Sikh hero has seemed to grow over time, and myths about him abound; there is a statue of him in Amritsar, he has been depicted in at least three movies and streets and public places are named in his memory.\n\nOver time, just as the myths around Singh grew, the political parties looked more favourably towards him. The Indian government was successful in literally reclaiming him (after several failed attempts in the 1960s) and Udham Singh���s casket was exhumed from the grounds of Pentonville prison in 1974.\n\nIt was a profound symbolic act. The coffin was taken to Heathrow, loaded into a decorated bus at Delhi airport, followed by large crowds and taken to Kapurthala House so that people could file past it and pay their respects before its final journey along the Grand Trunk Road and through Punjab to its resting place in Sunam, the town of his birth. Ironically, it was Indira Gandhi herself who came to see Udham Singh���s coffin before it left Delhi, laying a wreath, and praising in her speech a man who ���had sacrificed his life for his country.���\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThe known and unknown unknowns of Ola Electric IPO\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWarren Buffett is selling Apple shares to hold on to cash.
