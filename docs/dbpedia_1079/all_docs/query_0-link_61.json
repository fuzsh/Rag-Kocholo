        "text": "Details Birth and Early Life Singh was born in Sunam in Punjab’s Sangrur district in 1899. Political Activism Became associated with the Ghadar Party while in the US, which was founded by Sohan Singh Bhakna in 1913 and headquartered in California. Purpose and Actions In 1934, Singh travelled to London to assassinate Michael O’Dwyer, the former Lieutenant Governor of Punjab during the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Reason for Targeting O’Dwyer O’Dwyer had ordered Brigadier Reginald Dyer to Amritsar before the massacre, fearing a second Indian mutiny due to Hindu-Muslim unity and demonstrations. Assassination of O’Dwyer On March 13, 1940, Singh shot O’Dwyer at a meeting in Caxton Hall, London. Arrest and Execution Arrested immediately, held in Brixton prison, sentenced to death, and hanged on July 31, 1940, at Pentonville Prison. Legacy and Recognition\n\nRegarded as a hero for avenging the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n\nGandhi termed it an “act of insanity”.\n\nHe symbolized Hindu-Sikh-Muslim unity by adopting the name ‘Ram Mohamed Singh Azad’ during his trial."
