        "text": "JULY 31 is a day already marked in Indian history as the day Udham Singh was hanged by British imperialism for avenging the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh 80 years ago. It has become an even more personal and poignant for the brave comrades Joginder Kaur Bains in charge of the centenary committee and the General Secretary of Indian Workers’ Association GB — and Rajinder Bains a member of the executive: on this fateful day their beloved son Mandeep Singh Bains was taken from our midst.\n\nMandeep had complained of severe headaches, loss of vision and co-ordination, initially thought to be severe attacks of migraine, for the last couple of months during the lockdown. As the pain became acute on July 28, he was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) brain cancer. GBM is one of the most aggressive forms of devastating invasive cancer, which attacks the nerve cells of the brain and results in death within 15 months of diagnosis.\n\nUnfortunately, in Mandeep’s case it was only hours and he soon slipped into a coma and passed away on July 31. He was just 47 years old.\n\nMandeep leaves behind his life partner Sarabjit Kaur, son Karam and eight-year-old daughter Maya who said: “I am too young not to have a daddy.”\n\nThey are being comforted in this moment of profound grief and sadness by Mandeep’s elder brother Hardeep, his wife Nisha and their daughters.\n\nMandeep, an IT Engineer by profession, was an IWA activist, often seen on marches and helping out at meetings along with his family.\n\nJoginder and Rajinder have engaged their children in the noblest of causes — the service and emancipation of humanity. Mandeep’s wife Sarabjit runs a centre called Step Forward, for people with learning difficulties.\n\nThe general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) comrade Sitaram Yechury, and head of the International Department Comrade M A Baby, Harsev Bains from the Association of Indian Communists and Dyal Bagri, National President of the Indian Workers’ Association GB convey our heartfelt deepest condolences to comrades Joginder and Rajinder Bains on the sudden and shocking demise of their son Mandeep.\n\nWe salute their resilience and express our love and admiration for the fortitude and human spirit demonstrated by Mandeep’s wife Sarabjit, son Karam and daughter Maya, who thanked the nurses and donated Mandeep’s organs so that others may live.\n\nMandeep, cut off at a tender age, will live on."
