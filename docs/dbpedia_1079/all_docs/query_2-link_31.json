        "text": "News\n\nCity News\n\nchandigarh News\n\nBritish wanted to keep files on revolutionary classified till 2040\n\nThis story is from December 23, 2023\n\nBritish wanted to keep files on revolutionary classified till 2040\n\nApart from hanging him, the British tried their best to keep Udham Singh's story hidden in the archives. Files pertaining to Udham Singh were classified for 75 to 100 years. The British government tagged all files as 'closed' that contained communications about Udham, his family background, and his political activities. They also kept court proceedings and prosecution reports out of public discourse. However, some files were declassified in 1997 and 2016, revealing Udham's true identity as a patriotic revolutionary.\n\nApprehending that Udham Singh might 'pose as a martyr and indulge in heroics' during the Caxton Hill trial at Londonâs Old Bailey Court, British authorities even attempted to curb reporting of court proceedings by news agencies and newspapers\n\nAdaring act transformed Udham Singh into a legend. It served as an inspiration for many books and films, including Sardar Udham â a flick that won five National Film Awards. Since the day he fired those shots at Londonâs Caxton Hall and killed Michael OâDwyer 21 years after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the martyrâs legend has been part of Indiaâs collective consciousness and public discourse.\n\nHowever, what is largely missing from this narrative is the fact that apart from hanging him to death, the British had tried their best to keep Udhamâs story hidden in the archives of the British Empire.\n\nIronically, not for a few years or decades, the British had decided to keep almost all files pertaining to Udham Singh as classified for 75 to 100 years. The British government had decided to tag all those files as âclosedâ that contained officials communications exchanged between British Indian offices and London about Udham, intelligence reports about his family background, his connection with Amritsar and Jallianwala Bagh, his political activities, his activities in England and other countries, and even the details as minute as a list of his personal belongings recovered by the Scotland Yard sleuths from his possession or from his residence after his arrest.\n\nIt was also decided to keep all prosecution reports, ballistic reports, Crown witnessesâ statements and entire court proceedings out of public discourse. Even files loaded with intelligence dispatches of English spies containing information about the lawyers, which Udhamâs supporters were mulling to hire for his defence, were classified as âclosedâ, and so were the files having information about activities of his supporters before and after the Caxton Hall firing. Days after the incident, some aspects of Udhamâs life had already come out in public through press coverage of the incident and the trialâs proceedings.\n\nHowever, from the beginning of the case, the British were not inclined to give much publicity to the incident. They seemed to be in no mood to leave much record about the case in public domain. Moreover, the year was 1940. World War II was already underway and England, after jumping into an allout war against Germany, was passing through tough times.\n\nApprehending that Udham might âpose as a martyr and indulge in heroicsâ during the trial at Londonâs Old Bailey Court, the British authorities even attempted to curb reporting of the trial court proceedings by news agencies and newspapers. This attempt by British authorities is reflected in a âtop secretâ communication which the office of home department, secretary, state for India, had sent to the authorities concerned on April 16, 1940, when Udham was undergoing trial in the court.\n\nâWe understand it is the accusedâs intention, during the trial, to pose as a martyr and indulge in heroics. We would be glad if such steps are â¦taken to secure that the press in England do not report the trial sensationally,â reads the communication. Referring to a world-renowned news wire agency, the communication reads, ââ¦it (the agency) only carries as brief and unsensational a summary as possible.â\n\nNext day, in another similar communication, while claiming that the âarrangements have been made withâ the premier news wire agency, the authorities responded, while asserting: âWe will do what may be possible in conjunction with the Censorship Bureau here in regard to messages through other channels.\n\nAs however we can give no guarantee that careful censorship will be exercised at your end in relation to messages from correspondents of Indian newspapers.â The fate of Udham's files was finally sealed during the last day of his trial, when, on June 5, 1940, he delivered his last speech in court. The speech was heavily loaded with remarks against âBritish Imperialism.â\n\nIn their co-authored book âEmergence of The Image: Redact Documents of Udham Singhâ, which is based on the set of first five files retrieved from the British archives, Dr Navtej Singh, a retired professor from the department of historical research, Punjabi University, Patiala, and Avtar Singh Jouhl, the then general secretary of Indian Workers Association of Great Britain and a visiting fellow to the University of Warwick, have given a detailed account as to how the court, and later British government, classified these documents.\n\nâIt (Udhamâs speech in the court) stunned the court. The judge was clearly nonplussed. He passed ban orders under Section 6 of the Emergency Powers Act, not only on the publication of the speech but on all documents relating to Udham Singh,\" wrote Dr Navtej and Jouhl in the opening part of the book.\n\nâLater in 1958, these documents were further banned under Section 5 (1) of the Public Records Act till 2016 AD and the year 2040â, they added. âIn 1965, an Indian writer B S Maighowalia wrote to the British home office to have access to the papers in possession of British authorities relating to Udham Singh.\n\nAfter a few days he was disappointed to receive a negative reply that the papers were confidential. In 1989, British author Roger Perkins in his book âThe Amritsar Legacyâ dealt with Udham Singh at length. It was claimed that he had no access to all Udham Singhâs source material including the police, court and Security Services files,\" they wrote, while clearly indicating that files were inaccessible even in 1989.\n\nEven Roger Perkins, in reaction to whose book Indian Workersâ Association and the trust launched efforts to trace Udham record, also expressed his frustration over the âsecrecy.â In Chapter 10 of his book âThe Amritsar Legacyâ, which was published in England, Perkins, while naming a British authority, claimed, â(it) still holds a âmurder fileâ on the Dawyer killing, but this is covered by a âseventyfive-year rule.â The file is closed until the year 2016.â Naming another office, Perkins made another claim about trial papers: âIn 1958, an order was made under Section 5 (1) of Public Records Act that the file should remain secret until the year 2040.â\n\nHowever, if the British tried their best to keep the record classified, Punjabi immigrants also ran from pillar to post for almost eight years to retrieve some of the files related to the martyr.\n\nThe first push came in 1989, the year Perkinsâ book was published. Bharat Bhushan, coordinator of Birminghambased Shaheed Udham Singh Welfare Trust, told TOI, âParts of Perkinsâ book were based on assumptions.\n\nThere was resentment against the observations he made about Udham Singh in the book. Therefore, to bring the truth about Udham Singh to the fore, office-bearers of Indian Workers Association (IWA) had launched a campaign to force the British government to declassify the files.â âThe association also persuaded some English politicians and garnered their support.\n\nOur efforts bore fruits eight years later, when John Major-led Labour partyâs government had decided to declassify a set of five files in 1997,\" added Bhushan. Following this, after 20 years, the British declassified a set of another four files, which, as per several claims, were kept âclosedâ till 2016. Rakesh Kumar, resident of the same Sunam town where Udham was born and who has written several books on the martyr, secured copies of these four files after submitting several requests to the British authorities.\n\nâFour new files related to Udham Singh were released by the Public Record Office of the British Government. These files were secret and closed until 2016. I collected copies of these files from National Archive, London, and British Library, London,\" wrote Rakesh Kumar in his book 'Udham Singh: Hero in the Cause of Indian Freedom'. Commenting on the importance of these files, Bhushan, said, âToday, we know much more about Udham Singh compared to the years before 1989.\n\nThese files set the record straight and established that he was a patriotic revolutionary all along his life and who wanted to see his country free from the clutches of the British.â\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\n8 flowers and plants that will attract birds to your garden\n\nLifestyle\n\n9 habits which will keep your skin young\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 delicious dishes to pair with Idli beyond Sambhar\n\nFood\n\nInternational Tiger Day: Indian national parks famous for Bengal tigers\n\ntravel\n\n10 negative impacts of strict parenting\n\nLifestyle\n\nInternational Beer Day 2024: 8 types of beer and ingredients used in making them\n\nFood\n\nâBeautiful baby girl names with letter 'M'â\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 most famous wildlife safaris across the globe\n\ntravel\n\nSawan special: Easy Makhana Mango Barfi made under 10 mins\n\nFood\n\n10 bird species extinct due to loss of habitat\n\nLifestyle"
