        "text": "Shaheed Udham Singh:\n\nThe Forgotten Patriot\n\nSuneel Sinha writes from London: Secret paper relating to the case of Shahid Udham singh, the man who shot Sir Michael ODwyer, ex-Governor of Punjab, have been released 56 years after he was sentenced to death by hanging. Udham Singh had meted out justice to the man who ruled Punjab during the infamous Jallianwala massacre of 1919.\n\nUdham Singhs case papers tell the secrets of one of the most dramatic pre-Independence trials outside India, and of a patriotic Sikh who changed his name to Ram Mohammad Singh Azad on the police chargesheet after the shooting at Caxton Hall in Westminster.\n\nAccording to the documents, Justice Atkinson, the judge hearing the Udham Singh case at the Central Criminal Court in London, in June, 1940, ordered the press - in 1940 - not to publish Udham Singhs fiery statement in court. The papers were banned for a 100 years. Udham Singhs trial lasted two days, at the end of which he was sentenced to death.\n\nIt is not known why he changed his name, but in all probability Udham Singh believed that he had acted for every Hindu, Muslim and Sikh that died at Jallianwala Bagh. What is known is that he insisted that his name not be changed back to Udham Singh, as registered on his passport. On March 16, 1940, he wrote to Mr. Sands, the superintendent of police: Like to tell you one thing ... do not try to change my name whatsoever... I have given to you my name is Mohammad Singh Azad... I do not care if anyone says anything... Though the court ordered his name changed back to Udham Singh, he continued to use Mohammad Singh Azad till his execution - at Pentonville jail in London on 31st July, 1940. Shorthand notes of Udham Singhs last words in court show that when Justice Atkinson asked him if he had anything to say as to why death sentence should not be passed upon him according to law, Udham Singh replied: I say, down with British Imperialism...\n\nJustice Atkinson: I am not going to listen to a political speech. If you have anything relevant to say about this case, say it.\n\nUdham Singh (brandishing a sheaf of papers from which he had been reading aloud): I have to say this: I wanted to protest. Justice Atkinson: Is it in English? Udham Singh: You can understand what I am reading, now.\n\nJustice Atkinson: I will understand much more if you give it to me to read.\n\nUdham Singh: I want the jury, I want the whole lot to hear it.\n\nA short exchange later, Udham Singh shouted: I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all. I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it all. I am dying for a purpose. He continued: Machine-guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor women and children... Your conduct, - I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I am against the Imperialist government.\n\nJustice Atkinson: I am not going to hear any more.\n\nUdham Singh: You do not want to hear any more because you are tired of my speech, eh? I have a lot to say yet.\n\nJustice Atkinson: I am not going to hear any more of that statement.\n\nUdham Singh: You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it... You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in India.\n\nThe shorthand notes then say: Udham Singh removed his glasses, thrust them into his pocket, said three words in Hindustani, and then shouted, Down with British Imeperialism...\n\nWhen he turned to leave the dock, the notes reveal, he spat across the solicitors table.\n\nUdham Singh was at the Gurdwara Har Mandir Sahib in Amritsar on April 13, 1919, the day Brigadier General R.E.H. Dyer ordered his troops to mow down a gathering of unarmed Indians at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar. What followed was a massacre that shocked the world: 379 dead and more than 2,000 injured. Udham Singh was the orphan who gave water to some of the survivors.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nCalcutta Sikh Youths Role in NBA\n\nThe Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles may be unleashing magic on the basketball courts, but off it, the wows are all being monopolised by a state-of-the-art software created by Dr Inderpal Singh Bhandari, an alumnus of La Martinere, Calcutta and an IBM research scientist.\n\nAt last count - specifically this weekend - around ten of the 29 teams in the high-profile and multi-billion dollar National Basketball Association (NBA) League were already using Advance Scout - Dr Bhanadaris brainchild, while ten others are committed to using it from next season.\n\nAt the very least, the software has revolutionised the way coaches, even players, look at basketball. Soon, the National Hockey League (NHL), too, will be introduced to Advance Scout.\n\nSignificantly, the National Football League (NFL) has also made overtures.\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph from New York, where he is based, Dr Bhandari said: We see the NBA League (IBM is a major sponsor) as a perfect showcase for our technology. Basically the software is designed to help reach, what I would say, good decisions.\n\nIndeed, Advance Scout is being projected as a high-grade sweapon', which is obviously being grabbed by coaches. Besides analysing their teams performance, coaches can, through the data fed, identify game patterns which could make all the difference.\n\nDr Bhandari insists the software, devised on the data mining technology (Identification of interesting patterns from a large amount of data, as he put it), is user-friendly. It essentially notices patterns... Its for you to ask questions. Of course, the data bank must be updated daily.\n\nIn fact, Dr Bhandari is willing to offer it to the Indian cricket team. Having beaten South Africa in India so convincingly, I'm not sure whether they need it. But, if Advance Scout it required, I'm game, he signed off.\n\n[The Telegraph: Sunday Dec. 15, 1996]\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n20th World Congress of Philosopy: 1998\n\nWe have received advance information from Federation Internationale Des Societes De Philosophie International, Federation of Philosophical Societies, that the 20th World Congress of Philosophy will be held at Boston, Massachusetts, USA from 10 to 16 August, 1998. The themes center around PAIDEIA shall include Philosophy and the Future of Education, Cultural Diversity, Social Justice and Human Rights, the Ideals and Enlightenment and this legacy.\n\nThe American sponsors address is: 20th World Congress of Philosophy: 1998 American Organising Committee, Inc. Boston. Massachusetts. 02215. USA. Fax (617)353-5441.\n\nE-Mail: paideia@ bu.edu.\n\n[Registration fees, prior to June 01, 1997: US$150]\n\nPublication of World Sikh News suspended\n\nAt a time when the need for a strong Sikh press is so keenly being felt, we have been informed by Dr Gurinder Singh Grewal, the noted cardiologist of USA, and editor-in-chief of the World Sikh News, Stockton, California, that financial constraints have forced him to suspend its publication as a weekly newspaper.\n\nOver the last twelve years, the World Sikh News has, fearlessly and forcefully, articulated the Sikh concerns, acting as the watchdog of their human rights in the mother country and spreading the Sikh message of goodwill across the North American continent. Although many philanthropic individuals pitched in to launch it in the fateful year 1984, Dr Gurinder Singh Grewal gamely carried on the burden, almost single-handed, for a decade and more, weathering all manner of problems and discouragements. We understand that the last straw turned out to be the recurring deficit of more than $100,000 a year.\n\nConvinced of the need for a strong Sikh press - whether in USA, UK or India, we sincerely hope it will be possible to revive the World Sikh News, at least as a fortnightly if not weekly, to provide the voice and the forum for Sikh aspirations and as the bulwark of the Sikh moral values as well as their rights in the Western hemisphere. Let Gurdwara Managements in North America collectively set up a trust fund to re-establish this forum.\n\n(S.S.)\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nGift of Grandson to\n\nS. Mohan Singh Padam\n\nOur long-time friend and representative in Kenya, S. Mohan Singh Padam had donated Rs. 1001 to the Captain Bhag Singh Memorial Fund as token of thanksgiving on the birth of a grandson given the name Raj Singh, at Kusumu, Kenya, last summer. Our hearty felicitations to him and his son.\n\n(Contributed)\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nBhai Vir Singh, The Sage & Spiritualist\n\nwho raised Punjab literature to classical heights\n\nSyed Sadat Hasan writes:\n\nOn Sunday, Dec. 8th, Bhai Vir Singh Sahibs birth anniversary was celebrated at Sardar Shamsher Singhs (general secretary of Hemkunt Foundation) residence.\n\nThe occasion extended an opportunity to discuss the life and the works of the great literateur and scholar who raised Punjabi, from being a spoken language to the level of a recognized literary language of India.\n\nIt was a very well organized function, with works of Bhai Vir Singhji, and the works on by other well known writers, on display.\n\nThe day started with kirtan and Jaap by a young talented girl, Magan Kaur Sethi followed by well known Shabad singers, Bhai Surjit Singh Party and Gul Mohan Kaur. Singh Sahib Jagtar Singh Jachak addressed the gathering by noting the contributions that Bhai Vir Singh has made as a spiritulist, and as the father of Punjabi language.\n\nSardar Ishar Singh Bindra, who is the vice chairman of Sri Hemkunt Foundation gave the vote of thanks.\n\nThe greatest thing about Vir Singhji was his humility and sincerity to the cause of life. He untiringly worked to build Punjabi as a literary language, rather than let it be a Gramin Bhasha - village language. Another thing to which he was totally devoted was his adherence to the Sikh way as propagated by Sikh Gurus. He penned his sentiments about his love of the Lord in the following Rubai:\n\nDo not remove us (the garland) from around your neck\n\nDo not make your heart forget us\n\nDo not remove and throw us away\n\nWithout you, who will own us?\n\nThe same type of feelings he brings out very dramatically in one of his poems Matak Hulare (celestial vibrations). The verse reads:\n\nYou plucked us (flowers) and we parted\n\nWe got separated from the branch\n\nYou enjoyed the smell, put to the bosom and tossed,\n\nwe fell away from you, and\n\nThe passer-by treaded over us,\n\nAnd we were torn into petals,\n\nEven then the thankfulness for the contact\n\nIs evergreen and unforgettable.\n\nHis spiritualism reached to a point that his words could have transforming effects on the heart. Professor Puran Singh under the influence of Hindu Rishis had taken to took a practice a sanyasi monks way of life, cutting his hair short. Then, in course of time, he came in contact with Bhai Vir Singh, who immediately touched his head and said, Your hair is so smooth, tender and pretty. I can't understand how you can subject them to hard blades of scissors to trim.\n\nThe effect of this encounter on Prof. Puran Singh was so intense that he decided instantly to come back into the fold of Khalsa. He never cut his hair after the meeting and became a great poet-philosopher. Bhai Sahibs chief contributions to prose are: Sundari (1898) Bijay Singh (1899), Satwant Kaur (1900), Punj Granthi Steek (1906), Baba Naudh Singh (1907), Raja Lakhdata Singh (1910), Guru Nanak Cmatkar (1928), Satwant Kaur, Part II (1927).. Aur balam Sakhian (1955) and Sarv-Priya Sikh Dharam (1956).\n\nHis book, Mere Saiyan Jeeo, was judged best work of the year and was awarded a prize in 1953 by Sahitya Academy and he was awarded Padma Bhushan on 26the Jan. 1957. He died at the age of 85 years in 1957. The Hemkunt Foundation General Secretarys effort to celebrate Bhai Vir Singhji birthday every year in New York is highly commendable, as Bhai Vir Singhji has inspired so many people to work for Sikh causes and the Punjabi literature.\n\n[Courtesy: Asia-On-Line, New York]\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nEx-Punjab Police Chief blames\n\nGovt for terrorism\n\nThe release of a book on police and politics in Punjab, by a former state police chief, is revealing. In his book: Police and Politics in 20th century Punjab, Mr B.S. Danewalia has criticised the state for the way it has handled the decade-long problem of terrorism in Punjab. He has held some government agencies responsible for contributing to the advent of terrorism.\n\nMr Danewalia, Chief of Punjab Police from 1977 to 1980, has criticised the Army for indiscriminate killing of amritdhari (baptised) Sikhs, and the police chiefs for sanctioning lawlessness and extra-judicial killings, and the politicians for using the Sikh community for their political interests.\n\nAt a programme to release his book, attended by several former police chiefs and senior police officers, including the current Punjab Police DGP, Mr Sube Singh, Mr Danewalia described former police chiefs, Mr J.F. Ribeiro and Mr. K.P.S. Gill as outsiders who had no access to either informants or information.\n\nThis, he said, was borne out recently by the bomb blast, involving Punjab Police personnel in which the former Punjab Chief Minister, Mr Beant Singh had lost his life. Taking a dig at Mr Gill, Mr Danewalia said that instead of taking action against the person on whom the responsbility had rested, the government had chosen to give him an extension.\n\nCritising the methods adopted by Mr Ribeiro and Mr Gill, Mr Danewlia said the officers had exceeded the brief they had come with, as there was no need to kill innocents in the battle against militancy. The book describes both as personal legislators enunciating new tyrannical laws of yassa of Genghiz Khan.\n\nThe book also criticises the Army for killing innocent Sikhs merely on grounds that they sported long hair. It describes Operation Woodrose as an operation against the civil Sikh population of Punjab. Regarding Operation Bluestar, Mr Danewalia writes: Without any Martial Law in force, the Army carried out the military executions at the Golden Temple and other gurdwaras in the Punjab - outside the laws..\n\nHe described terrorism as the only weapon available to a minority to express itself, and stated that the second phase of insurgency in the state was directly due to mishandling and uncalled-for draggonades undertaken by the police."
