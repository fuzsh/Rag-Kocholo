        "text": "71 years ago on this date, Udham Singh was hanged to death in Pentonville Prison in UK.\n\nHe was hanged for the assasination of Michael O’Dwyer, ex Governer of Punjab and the man Udham Singh held responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre..\n\nIt is said that the mass killing in Jallianwala Bagh deeply affected Udham Singh “…and proved a turning point in his life” After a bath in the sacred sarovar at Golden Temple,”Udham Singh took a silent vow and solemn pledge in front of the Golden Temple to wreak a vengeance on the perpetrators of the crime and to restore honour to what he saw as a humiliated nation.”\n\nIt took him almost 21 years to fulfil his vow. On 13th March 1940, at a meeting held at Caxton Hall, Udham Singh fired at O’Dwyer who died immediately. He also fired shots at Zetland, the Secretary of State for India, injuring him but not seriously.\n\nUdham Singh did not intend to escape. He was arrested on the spot.\n\nOn 31 July 1940, Udham Singh was hanged at Pentonville Prison.\n\nIncidentally, Gandhi and Nehru both condemned his act at the time. Gandhi remarked that, “the outrage has caused me deep pain. I regard it as an act of insanity…I hope this will not be allowed to affect political judgement“.\n\nNehru wrote in his National Herald: “Assassination is regretted but it is earnestly hoped that it will not have far-reaching repercussions on political future of India”\n\nSubhash Chandra Bose was perhaps the only leader of the independence movement who approved of Udham Singh’s action.\n\nNehru, ever the astute politician, however did an about turn few years later. Writing in the daily “Partap” in 1962, he remarked,”I salute Shaheed-i-Azam Udham Singh with reverence who had kissed the noose so that we may be free.”\n\nPlease take a moment to remember this Hero..pl share with your friends and family..\n\nRelated Posts:Â Remembering Punjab Kesariâ€¦,Â I bet you forgotâ€¦ andÂ Remembering Madan Lal Dhingraâ€¦\n\nImage courtesy: Satya Itihas\n\nReferences: “Harijan”, March 15, 1940; “Harijan”, March 23, 1940; “National Herald”, March 15, 1940; Nehru Quoted in: Udham Singh alias Ram Mohammad Singh Azad, 2002, p 300, prof (Dr) Sikander Singh and Wikipedia"
