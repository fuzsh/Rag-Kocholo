        "text": "The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre is still capable of sending shivers down the spine of every Indian who has heard the story of how it transpired. Violent and gory pictures of the experience have been shared by survivors of one of history’s biggest denial of human rights.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May recently made a formal statement to India and called the carnage a shameful scar. Many Indians, including the families of the victims, still experience the impact of the event that changed India’s history. Under the command of Colonel Reginald Dyer, soldiers opened fire on a large number of people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on this day in 1919. It was estimated that over 1,000 people lost their lives and another 1,500 people were injured in the firing.\n\n1. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties."
