Udham Singh was an Indian revolutionary who is best known for assassinating Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940. O'Dwyer was responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, in which British troops opened fire on a peaceful gathering of unarmed Indians, killing hundreds.

Singh was born in 1899 in Punjab, India. He was deeply affected by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and he vowed to avenge the deaths of his countrymen. He joined the Ghadar Party, a revolutionary organization that was dedicated to overthrowing British rule in India.

AVENGING JALLIANWALA MASSACRE:

In 1927, Singh traveled to England, where he lived under the alias Ram Mohammad Singh Azad. He eventually tracked down O'Dwyer, who was living in London at the time. On 13 March 1940, Singh shot and killed O'Dwyer at a meeting of the East India Association.

Death:

Singh was arrested and tried for murder. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was hanged on 31 July 1940.

Singh was truly a martyr. He is remembered for his courage and his willingness to sacrifice his own life for the cause of Indian independence. He is also remembered for his commitment to non-violence, even though he ultimately resorted to violence in order to achieve his goals.

Singh is admired for his courage and his commitment to Indian independence, but he is also criticized by others for his use of violence. However, there is no doubt that he was a significant figure in the Indian freedom struggle.
