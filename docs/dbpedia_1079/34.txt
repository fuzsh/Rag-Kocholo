On 13 March 1940, Udham Singh shot deadMichael O'Dwyer at a meeting of the East India Association and the Royal Central Asian Society at Caxton Hall, London.

O'Dwyer, the then Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, supported Brigadier-General Reginald Edward Harry Dyer during the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

Sardar Udham Singh was born on 26 December 1899 in a Sikh family in Sunam village of Sangrur district, Punjab province. He lost his parents during the Jallianwala massacre.It is believed that the Jallianwala Bagh massacre had a deep impact on him.

After the Rowlatt Act was passed, the Punjab government started suppressing all protests. Meanwhile, on April 13, 1919, the public gathered at Jallianwala Bagh to celebrate Baisakhi, but the British government took it as a political gathering.

Despite General Dyer's order to prevent unlawful assembly, people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. Where two resolutions were to be discussed, one condemning the firing on 10 April and the other requesting the authorities to release their leaders to be done.

On receiving information about the gathering of people, Brigadier-General Dyer ordered them to open fire without any warning.

The firing went on for 10-15 minutes and the firing stopped only after the ammunition was exhausted. The total estimated number of dead in this incident was more than 500.
