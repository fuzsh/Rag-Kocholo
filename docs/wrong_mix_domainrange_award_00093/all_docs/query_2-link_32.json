        "text": "I was watching the History Channel's Modern Marvels when an interesting interstitial between the program and commercials announced that before 1933 Germany led the world in Nobel Prizes.\n\nHere's how it looked for the top 5 countries with Laureates in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, and Literature from 1901 through 1933:\n\nGermany: 35\n\nUK: 21\n\nFrance: 19\n\nSweden: 10\n\nUSA: 8\n\nThis translates to 1.06 Nobel winners per year. After 1933, Germany garnered a measly 40 Nobel Laureates over the course of the next 75 years or 0.53 Nobel winners per year, remarkably exactly half of what it was before 1933.\n\nSo what happened? If we look at the years before 1933, we find that 29% of German Nobel Prize winners were Jews. After 1933, less than one-half of one percent of German Nobel Prize winners were Jewish. Germany's Jews fled to other countries and consequently from 1934 to 2009 Germany with all its great universities, world renowned chemical factories, and medical institutions garnered a measly 40 Nobel Laureates, of whom only 2 were Jews. This is what happens when Jews are chased out of a country.\n\nSince 1933, 152 Jews have won Nobel Prizes throughout the world. Had Hitler not destroyed 75% of Germany's Jews, I have no doubt that Germany would still be leading the world in Nobel Prize winners. The majority of Jews from Germany, Austria, and other countries under Nazi domination escaped to the US which, not coincidentally, now has the highest number of Nobel Laureates (40% of whom are Jews). This is what happens when you accept Jews into your country.\n\nHere is a list of pre-1933 Nobel Laureates born in Germany or of German descent. Jews are denoted by a * after the award year, sort of like a yellow badge, if you will.\n\nYearLaureateAwardBirth Place1901Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgenPhysicsPrussia1901Emil Adolf von BehringMedicinePrussia1902Theodor MommsenLiteratureDenmark1902Hermann Emil FischerChemistryGermany1905*Adolf von BaeyerChemistryGermany1905Philipp LenardPhysicsSlovakia1905Robert KochMedicineGermany1907Eduard BuchnerChemistryGermany1908*Paul EhrlichMedicinePrussia/Poland1908Rudolf Christoph EuckenLiteratureGermany1909Wilhelm OstwaldChemistryLatvia1909Karl Ferdinand BraunPhysicsGermany1910Paul Johann Ludwig HeyseLiteratureGermany1910Albrecht KosselMedicineGermany1910*Otto WallachChemistryPrussia/Now Russia1911Wilhelm WienPhysicsEast Prussia1912Gerhart HauptmannLiteraturePrussia1914Max von LauePhysicsGermany1915*Richard WillstÃ¤tterChemistryGermany1918Max PlanckPhysicsGermany1918*Fritz HaberChemistryPoland1919Johannes StarkPhysicsGermany1920Walther NernstChemistryPrussia/Now Poland1921*Albert EinsteinPhysicsGermany1922*Otto Fritz MeyerhofMedicineGermany1925*Gustav Ludwig HertzPhysicsGermany1925*James FranckPhysicsGermany1927Heinrich Otto WielandChemistryGermany1928Adolf Otto Reinhold WindausChemistryGermany1929Thomas MannLiteratureGermany1930Hans FischerChemistryGermany1931Friedrich BergiusChemistryPoland1931Carl BoschChemistryGermany1931*Otto Heinrich WarburgMedicineGermany1932Werner Karl HeisenbergPhysicsGermany\n\nThe list of German Nobel Winners after 1933 can be found below.\n\nThose with limited intelligence may ask, \"So Jews left Germany after 1933 - so what?\" Actually, Hitler thought the very same thing: In 1933, Max Planck, as president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft (Kaiser Wilhelm Society), met with Adolf Hitler. During the meeting, Planck told Hitler that forcing Jewish scientists to emigrate would mutilate Germany and the benefits of their work would go to foreign countries. Hitler responded with a rant against Jews... [Wiki]\n\nActually, the Jews leaving Germany was a lucky thing for the world. The photo at the top of this article displays the experimental apparatus with which the team of Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission in December 1938 [Wiki]. Lise Meitner, an Austrian Jew, in July of that year had already fled Germany.\n\nMeitner passed the news to Niels Bohr (another Jew), who was to lecture at Princeton University. Isidor Isaac Rabi (Jew) and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton, heard the news and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi told Enrico Fermi and so it went on. Eventually Albert Einstein (Jew) was elected to write a letter to President Roosevelt describing the potential power of a nuclear bomb.\n\nThe Manhattan Project was successful precisely because of Jews who escaped the Nazis. If it weren't for the stupidity of Adolph Hitler and his hatred of Jews, he would have had nuclear weapons before anyone else.\n\nSome of these ideas I have previously covered in my article How Jews Saved the World from Tyranny.\n\nGermany's Nobel Winners after 1933:\n\nYearLaureateAwardBirth Place1935Hans SpemannMedicineGermany1938Richard KuhnChemistryAustria1939Gerhard DomagkMedicineGermany1939Adolf ButenandtChemistryGermany1944Otto HahnChemistryGermany1950Kurt AlderChemistrySilesia/Now Poland1950Otto DielsChemistryGermany1953Hermann StaudingerChemistryGermany1954Walther BothePhysicsGermany1956Werner ForssmannMedicineGermany1961Rudolf MÃ¶ssbauerPhysicsGermany1963Johannes Hans Daniel JensenPhysicsGermany1963Karl ZieglerChemistryGermany1964Feodor Felix Konrad LynenMedicineGermany1967Manfred EigenChemistryGermany1972Heinrich BÃ¶llLiteratureGermany1973Ernst Otto FischerChemistryGermany1979Georg WittigChemistryGermany1984Georges J.F.
