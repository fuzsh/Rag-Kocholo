        "text": "Important Facts\n\nThe prize is not awarded posthumously. However, if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it, the prize may still be presented.\n\nA prize may not be shared among more than three individuals, although the Nobel Peace Prize can be awarded to organizations of more than three people.\n\nAll medals made before 1980 were struck in 23-carat gold. But since then, they have been struck in 18-carat green gold plated with 24-carat gold.\n\nThe weight of each medal varies according to the value of gold. However, it averages about 175 grams for each medal.\n\nSir William Lawrence Bragg, one of the youngest Physics Nobel prize winner at the age of 25 was awarded his winning medal along with his father.\n\nFrederick Sanger has been awarded the Nobel prize twice for Chemistry.\n\nLe Duc Tho was selected for the Nobel Prize for Peace, which he declined later.\n\nMalala Yousafzai is the youngest award winner for Peace at the age of 17."
