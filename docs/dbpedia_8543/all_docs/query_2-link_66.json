        "text": "PRESENTED BY BOP SHOP RECORDS and LOVIN' CUP\n\nBadfinger was the most successful recording act ever signed to The Beatles' label, Apple Records. Joey Molland joined the original lineup of Pete Ham, Tommy Evans and Mike Gibbins in late 1969 when The Iveys transformed into Badfinger. The group would go on to produce such Top 10 hits as \"Come & Get It\", \"No Matter What\", \"Day After Day\", \"Baby Blue\" (featured in the series finale of Breaking Bad) and \"Without You\" – a song covered by both Nilsson (1972) and Mariah Carey (1994), both of which went to #1.\n\nThe band interacted in various ways with each member of The Beatles, including their solo careers. Paul McCartney wrote & produced the band's first single - \"Come & Get It\". Joey & Tommy played acoustic guitars on John Lennon's \"Jealous Guy\" & \"I Don't Want to Be a Soldier, Momma\" on his Imagine LP. Pete & Tommy lent backup vocals on Ringo Starr's \"It Don't Come Easy\". And the entire original Badfinger lineup contributed to George Harrison's landmark triple-LP set, \"All Things Must Pass\" and the equally groundbreaking fundraising event, Concert for Bangladesh. Expect to hear some exclusive, “behind the scenes” stories while attending a Joey Molland solo performance!\n\nhttp://www.badfingersite.com/\n\nDOORS @ 6:30PM | $20 ADVANCE/ $25 DAY OF SHOW"
