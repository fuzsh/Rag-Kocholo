        "text": "For this month’s topic your blogger didn’t have some deep meaning in mind, but rather mostly older three-chord rock and roll that only the most obsessive music fans would likely remember. This is the kind of music I liked as a kid in the ’60s (and later when bands tried to copy it) that were either not big hits or were album tracks. I still slide back to it when I need a jump-start of adrenaline. Don’t expect anything more than primitive lizard-brain music but if you like rock when it still rolled then dig in. I frankly couldn’t stop with just 25 so next month’s post will add 30 more. By the way, I did two posts on Random Rare Records January and February of 2022 if you want more rare rock.\n\n1.Cat Mother & The All Night Newsboys – Good Old Rock ‘N’ Roll\n\nBack between my junior and senior years at Broomfield High in the summer of 1969, this was a #21 U.S. hit. They started out in New York City in 1967. After psychedelia had pushed old-school rock & roll off the charts, this was a return to basics being a medley of songs like “Sweet Little Sixteen” and “Chantilly Lace”. This was from their first album The Street Giveth… and the Street Taketh Away which was produced by Jimi Hendrix of all people – it’s not heavy, bluesy or psychedelic which would be the style you’d expect from Jimi. The young me was shocked after buying their second LP Albion Doo-wah and finding they had changed their sound to a rootsy style (sort of like The Band) eschewing good old rock and roll. In truth that album grew on me, but I still go back to this their first single as what I like the most. By the way, The Dave Clark Five did a cover version that charted at #7 in the U.K. in 1969.\n\n2.Steppenwolf – Berry Rides Again\n\nHere is the song that inspired this post as for some reason I found this going through my brain a few weeks back. Yes I bought the LP for the song “Born To Be Wild”, but this roots-rocker and “Sookie Sookie” were my other faves from their 1968 debut. Singer John Kay (Joachim Krauledat) wrote the song by stringing together the titles of old Chuck Berry classics like “Nadine” and “Maybelline” in to a story about old girlfriends. In 1968 this actually was pretty radical to be doing basic rock and roll as rock had gotten heavier and more complex. Michael Monarch plays some tasty Berry licks while Goldie McJohn really rocks the 88s a la Johnnie Johnson (Berry’s piano player).\n\n3.NRBQ – Mama Get Down Those Rock & Roll Shoes\n\n1969 was the year bands started edging towards basic rock and roll again and this Columbia LP grabbed my entertainment dollars back when I didn’t have much of them to spend. It was actually their cover of the old Eddie Cochran song “C’mon Everybody” that first enthralled the young me. They were originally a southern rock band called The New Rhythm & Blues Quartet which was shortened to NRBQ. The intro pictures show them at the far left. They’re still going today with pianist Terry Adams being the only original member left (he also wrote this rocker).\n\n4.The Electric Flag – Wine\n\nLet’s stay on the Columbia records label with a track from the first album by a band that was sort of a super group of ’60s blues/r&b players. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and drummer Buddy Miles are the best known though singer Nick Gravenites, keys-man Barry Goldberg and bassist Harvey Brooks were big names too. Originally Mitch Ryder was asked to be the singer but he declined. Their debut record A Long Time Coming ended with this rockin’ reworking of the old Sticks McGee song “Drinkin’ Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee” (#2 r&b in 1949). When I bought this album in 1968 I was a bit disappointed as there weren’t enough tracks like this and “Killing Floor”. They are the middle band pictured in our intro.\n\n5.Savoy Brown – Let It Rock (Rock & Roll On The Radio)\n\nThe only constant with the British blues group Savoy Brown was change with only one member lasting through all their albums – the late Kim Simmonds (guitarist). With all their line-up changes, there were two main eras us fans remember starting with their formation in 1965. The main core of that band left to form Foghat in 1970 leaving Simmonds alone to rebuild. This song was from the 1971 LP Street Corner Talking which was the first with Dave Walker on lead vocals along with three members from fellow British blues band Chicken Shack. One of those new members was keys-man Paul Raymond who had replaced Christine Perfect in Chicken Shack when she married John McVie and joined his band Fleetwood Mac. Paul composed and sang this song for Savoy Brown before eventually leaving to join UFO and their various offshoots. The lyric references Sticks McGee and his song about wine, by the way. Simmonds lived from Dec. 5 1947 till Dec. 13 2022.\n\n6.Warren Phillips & The Rockets – Blue Jean Boogie\n\nWhile Savoy Brown was recording the 1969 LP A Step Further, members Lonesome Dave Peverett, Roger Earl, Tony Stevens and Bob Hall knocked out a quick set of oldies. The record was only released overseas as The World Of Rock & Roll by Warren Philllips & The Rockets. Much later when Foghat was successful it was released in the U.S. by London Records under the title Before Foghat Days which is how I found it back in 1979. “Blue Jean Boogie” was one of the band originals on the album and is found at 4:45 in to this video as all I could find was the entire album posted.\n\n7.Fleetwood Mac – Tallahassee Lassie\n\nLet’s return to Fleetwood Mac with this Freddy Cannon stomper that the Peter Green-led act recorded for a March 1969 BBC radio session. I had wanted to feature the 1970 solo album Jeremy Spencer and the song “You Made A Hit” but every time a record is posted on youtube from that album, it gets deleted. This track is a pretty good 2nd choice and seems more typical of the oldies that Spencer liked than the blues Green liked – go figure as Greeny sings lead. The 3rd guitarist at this time was Danny Kirwan who played on their next album Then Play On which was way different than this rocker. The song was written by Bob Crewe, Frank Slay and Frederick Picariello (Cannon’s real name). It got to #6 in the U.S. and #17 in the U.K. back in 1959. By the way, as usual this proves my point that all rock and roll is better with handclaps. A note for all you youngsters – don’t be confused as this is an early version of the totally differerent sounding pop band of the same name from years later that dumped the blues as fronted by Buckingham and Nicks.\n\n8.Ten Years After – Going Back To Birmingham\n\nAnother bigtime British blues band of the late ’60s and early ’70s was Ten Years After with guitar and vocals handled by the late Alvin Lee. Their eighth LP Positive Vibrations came out in 1974 and included this Little Richard cover. It was their last album of new material for fifteen years as Lee moved on to a solo career. Alvin lived from Dec. 19, 1944 till March 6, 2013 when he passed on during routine treatment to correct artial arrhythmia proving there is no such thing as simple surgery.\n\n9.Canned Heat – Big Fat\n\nHere’s another blues group but in this case an American one. This was an amped-up version of the 1949 Fats Domino song “The Fat Man” that frankly doesn’t get the recognition it deserves for being proto-rock and roll long before it existed (at least in name). The lyrics are a bit different (Fats for instance says he weighs 200 pounds while Bob Hite says 300) and the rolling piano and scat vocal break is replaced by Hite’s nasty blues harmonica. When your future Dentist bought the Hallelujah album by Canned Heat in the summer of 1969, it was a big let-down from Living The Blues and the hit “Going Up The Country”. The only redeeming song for me was this rocker. These guys are the far right band pictured in our intro.\n\n10.Chicken Shack – Unlucky Boy\n\nBarrelhouse piano man Champion Jack Dupree waxed the song “Chicken Shack” so it was only fitting that the British blues band of that name should record a song written by him (along with Big Mama Thornton). Thornton’s take on “Unlucky Girl” was far more bluesy and slowed down while Stan Webb’s outfit rocked it up after changing the gender and making it the title of their 1973 Deram label LP. By this point, Webb was the last original member with Christine Perfect (McVie) having left for Fleetwood Mac and the rest of the band for Savoy Brown. As this is being written, Webb (born Feb. 3, 1946 in London) still leads a version of the band.\n\n11.Mungo Jerry – Baby Let’s Play House\n\nIn the U.S. this British group are known strictly for the #3 1970 single “In The Summertime”. When that song came out, I picked up their debut album on the Janus label which included this faithful cover of the old Elvis Presley rockabilly song on the Sun label (1955). His was a reworked cover of an Arthur Gunter original and was paired with “I’m Left, You’re Right, She’s Gone”. Mungo Jerry was far more successful in the U.K. than in the U.S. and was led by Ray Dorset. One of the original members was pianist Colin Earl who was the brother of the Savoy Brown/Foghat drummer Roger Earl.\n\n12.Long John Baldry – Don’t Try To Lay No Boogie Woogie On The King Of Rock & Roll\n\nOn the strength of this rocker your Dentist layed down his hard-earned $2.99 at Budget Tapes & Records back in 1971 and bought the LP It Ain’t Easy. As it turned out that and the title track were the only songs I liked which was your fear prior to the internet which now allows you to sample music before you buy it to see if the whole record is decent. At 6’7 John was tall hence the ‘Long’. He was involved with the early British blues scene and led a band that at one time or another included Rod Stewart and Elton John so each of them produced one side of this LP, his most successful. He had a couple of big ballad hits in the U.K., but this single was his biggest in the U.S. at #73. It was an edit of the 6:46 LP version that took out the 3+ minute rap at the start about John getting arrested for busking on the streets of London. The original hit was by Minnesota band Crow in 1970 (#52) and was written by Jeff Thomas who also recorded it. Both their versions were slower and didn’t have the same drive. Several of the Rolling Stones had also been in an early band with Baldry and if you listen to the intro to their 1966 live LP Got Live If You Want It you can hear John announce them before “Under My Thumb”. He lived from Jan. 12, 1941 till passing away in Canada on July 21, 2005.\n\n13.The Guess Who – Don’t You Want Me\n\nThe 1974 Road Food LP included the big hits “Star Baby” and “Clap For The Wolfman”. The Burton Cummings original “Don’t You Want Me” first appeared as the third song in the comedic music medley “Hi Rockers!” from the 1972 Rockin’ LP. Here it is taken from the medley as a stand-alone ’50s piano-driven throwback. By the time I bought the Road Food album, guitarists Kurt Winter and Donnie McDougall had departed to be replaced by Dom Troiano. It was this version of the band that I raced to the mall (Villa Italia or Westland I think) back in the day to meet and get autographs on my album. While I enjoyed talking to Burton, as I recall it was a real Spinal Tap moment as I think I was about the only person there to meet the band.\n\n14.Flash Cadillac & The Continental Kids – Betty Lou\n\nAfter reading a glowing review of their self-titled debut Epic LP in the short-lived Phonograph Record Magazine, I had to buy this excellent album of covers and band originals. Little did I realize that they were a Colorado band who I would become close to and write an article about many years later (see my blog from Jan. 2016 for an update of that piece). At this point in 1972 they were about to be riding high from appearing in the 1973 movie American Graffiti as Herby & The Heartbeats (and later as Fish & The Fins in a 1975 episode of Happy Days). “Betty Lou” was a Kris Moe original that they redid for their 1997 CD Rock & Roll Rules. Moe, Sam McFadin and Linn Phillips III are sadly gone now with original bassist Warren Knight occasionally still leading a new Flash Cadillac in concert.\n\n15.Johnny Winter – Slippin’ & Slidin’\n\nThe star of this Little Richard cover from the 1969 Second Winter LP is Johnny’s brother Edgar who pounds some mean piano and adds a tasty sax break. I honestly don’t know if there was ever another double album like this that only used three sides of the vinyl while leaving one blank. That was done to make the music loud on the original record by cutting the grooves deeply in to the vinyl. It worked and this was a better record than his self-titled debut Columbia album from the same year. Johnny was a great blues guitarist from Texas (Feb. 23, 1944 till July 16, 2014) while his brother was two years younger. Being albinos made them a rarity in music. Writing credit has been listed as by Richard Penniman, Edwin Bocage, Al Collins and James Smith.\n\n16.Delaney & Bonnie – Soul Shake\n\nHere is an album your blogger bought back in 1970 on the strength of this one song which also charted as a single at #43 – shoulda just grabbed the 45. This was a cover of a record from 1969 by Peggy Scott and Jo Jo Benson that hit #37 on the U.S. charts. The song was written by Margaret Lewis and Myrna Smith (of The Sweet Inspirations). The Scott and Benson version rocked but used a cheesy electric sitar guitar on the breaks whereas the Delaney & Bonnie version had full instrumental backing. Most of these players ended up backing Eric Clapton, Leon Russell and Joe Cocker over time. The Bramletts were married from 1967 till 1972. Delaney passed following gall bladder surgery at age 69 two days after Christmas 2008.\n\n17.Don Nix – Olena\n\nNix was a southern rocker hailing from Tennessee and this was his only chart record – #94 in 1971. I grabbed the LP back then and frankly didn’t like anything other than this piano-driven rocker. He had played sax with The Mar-Keys (“Last Night”) and then become a well-known behind the scenes guy as an arranger and producer. His biggest influence on the young me (as guitarist and singer) and my drummer buddy Mr. D was with Nix’s composition “Going Down” (Jeff Beck Group) that we often tried to play (badly) in his basement till Dan’s neighbor would call to make us turn down the volume (sorry Cheryl Watkins wherever you are).\n\n18.Badfinger – Rock Of All Ages\n\nThis was included in the 1969 movie The Magic Christian (Peter Sellers, Ringo Starr) and so appeared on the soundtrack LP plus the 1970 Badfinger LP Magic Christian Music on Apple records. Writing credit goes to the three band members who played on it – Tom Evans, Pete Ham and Mike Gibbins (before Joey Molland joined). Production was handled by Paul McCartney who also pounded out a rockin’ piano part. Evans’ histrionic vocal is one of his best. Evans and Ham both came to sad ends (which you can look up online) but while in Badfinger they created some outstanding music.\n\n19.John Lennon with Elephant’s Memory – New York City\n\nLet’s stay on the Apple label for the best song from a John Lennon album best forgotten (and most of his fans have) – Some Time in New York City . In 1972 to follow up his successful Imagine album, John and Yoko with Elephants Memory (as the Plastic Ono Band) released a double LP of strident political songs that critics and fans alike hated. Buried at the end of side one, however, was this pretty darn good rock and roll song about the Lennons’ move to New York (sort of a follow-up to “The Ballad of John and Yoko”). John was a rocker after all and his capable backing band here was Elephant’s Memory who were a New York street band that had charted in 1970 with “Mongoose” (#50). Elephant’s Memory also backed up Chuck Berry on his 1973 LP Bio.\n\n20.The Raspberries – I’m A Rocker\n\nSort of an American version of Badfinger, The Raspberries were more than just Eric Carmen (R.I.P.) though admittedly he did write and sing their most-remembered songs. The guys could flat out rock as can be heard on this track from their third LP – Side 3 (1973 on Capitol records). “I’m A Rocker” was released as a single but barely squeaked in to the charts at #94. It was a toss-up whether to include this song or the equally great “All Through The Night” from their last album Starting Over from 1974 (I urge you to look for that video too).\n\n21.Bobby Fuller Drive – Nervous Breakdown\n\nHere is the newest recording on our list but you would never know it since it sounds like a classic oldie. The song is an Eddie Cochran rocker that was found on his posthumous LP Never to Be Forgotten with writing credit going to TV actor Mario Roccuzzo. Texan Bobby Fuller released his version in 1962 on the small Eastwood label. In 2003 Fuller’s brother Randy (who had been a member of The Bobby Fuller Four) and his band Bobby Fuller Drive (two guys who had played with Bobby in the ’60s also) released the CD Breakin’ Rocks which included this more polished take on “Nervous Breakdown”. The CD title was a reference to his brother’s biggest hit “I Fought The Law”. The track-list was mostly covers of his brother’s songs and was really pretty good if little heard at the time by any but the most dedicated fans. For that reason I’ve included it here even thought its not a stomper. By the way, “Never To Be Forgotten” is also the title of a Bobby and Randy Fuller composition that is also one of the best songs on this album.\n\n22.April Wine – Wanna Rock\n\nThis album track from Canadian band April Wine was found on their most successful LP The Nature Of The Beast (1981). It contained their biggest hit, the ballad “Just Between You and Me”. “Wanna Rock” was written by singer/guitarist Myles Goodwyn as was most of the album. While the band is still going with one original member (guitarist Brian Greenway), Goodwyn passed in 2023 at age 75.\n\n23.Russ Ballard – She Said Yeah\n\nRolling Stones fans may recognize this song as the lead track from their 1965 album December’s Children (And Everybody’s). It was originally the b-side to the 1958 single “Bad Boy” by Larry Williams and was listed as written by Jackson and Christy on his record but G. Roderick, S. Christy and R. Jackson on the Stones record. Other places list Sonny Bono and Roddy Jackson. Ballard was mostly successful as a songwriter but is best known as the singer of “Hold Your Head Up” for Argent (though it was written by Rod Argent and Chris White). This was found on his Barnet Dogs LP from 1980 which contained the #58 chart single “On the Rebound”.\n\n24.Bram Tchaikovsky – I’m A Believer\n\nTake a Monkees hit from 1966 and make it in to a monkey-beat rocker in 1979 in the thankfully fading face of disco and you have grabbed your Dentist’s entertainment dollar. The Bee Gees had just had their last #1 with “Love You Inside Out” and America was ready to burn their leisure suits and start rocking again with groups like The Knack and The Romantics (thanks guys!). Peter Bramall had taken the nom-de-classical-music Tchaikovsky while in the U.K. band The Motors (“Airport”). When he went solo his debut was Strange Man, Changed Man which spawned the #37 hit “Girl of My Dreams”.\n\n25.Paul Collins’ Beat – Will You Listen\n\nThe Beat was lead by Paul Collins and was one of the best bands to come out of the New Wave of rock and roll in 1979/80. While their two Columbia albums are essential purchases, they never found chart success but you still need them if you love guitar rock and roll. Their self-titled 1979 debut is power pop from beginning to end while the 1982 followup The Kids Are The Same exhibits more maturity (though this track from it still rocks like mad). Collins grew up in New York and New Jersey and still occasionally records and tours.\n\nThe Rock’n’Roll Brother-In-Law Matthew Brown threw out a great question after we saw that The Dixie Chicks had decided to become The Chicks due to political correctness – What other acts have changed their names during their career? All bands typically experiment with different monikers before they finally make it , but this isn’t our topic. Ian Anderson has said that in order to get multiple bookings at clubs, his band used various names like Navy Blue and Candy Coloured Rain before becoming successful as Jethro Tull (an name he claims to regret). This isn’t about The Quarrymen becoming The Silver Beatles then dropping Silver or The Pendletons becoming The Beach Boys because they weren’t successful in their old names. This is about a group like Lady Antebellum who already were a success becoming simply Lady A (when did “antebellum” which simply means “before the war” become offensive?). There are many differing reasons acts change their names and we will try to throw in a couple of each. They may decide their old name sounds dated or too long. Acts may go under a pseudonym if they are going to put out an album that sounds nothing like their other music. Some may lose a member or two and decide a new image is in order or often they don’t own the rights to the old name anymore. Today’s artists seem to change their names at the drop of a rap. Indeed just a few hours after I posted this, Canadian singer The Weeknd announced he was now using his real name Abel Tesfaye.\n\n1.John (Cougar) Mellencamp\n\nBorn Oct. 7, 1951 in Seymour, Indiana, few likely remember that Mr. Mellencamp began his career as Johnny Cougar. English impresario Tony DeFries managed the likes of David Bowie and Mott The Hoople during the glam rock era. He also took young John under his corporate umbrella of MainMan. The name Mellencamp didn’t sound like a good rock name to him so DeFries christened him Johnny Cougar for his 1976 debut LP Chestnut Street Incident. The LP flopped. His 1979 album was released as John Cougar. When his 1982 album American Fool became a hit due to songs like “Hurts So Good”, he exercised his pull to become John Cougar Mellencamp with the next LP Uh-Huh. A couple of albums down the road in 1982 (Scarecrow) he completed the transition to John Mellencamp dropping Cougar. That certainly was more fitting of a serious artist who moved in to an Americana vein while co-founding the Farm Aid charity. The hard part, however, is where do you file his records alphabetically in your collection? This is really a problem for most of the acts in our list.\n\n2.The Move – The Electric Light Orchestra – ELO\n\nYou need to have been a big fan of British music to know of Roy Wood and his band The Move (which I am). They did great work like “Flowers In The Rain” and “Message From The Country” that were U.K. hits. By the time of that last mentioned single, he and drummer Bev Bevan were joined by guitarist Jeff Lynne from The Idle Race. Taking their cue from The Beatles’ “I Am The Walrus” which used cellos and the like, the trio decided to record a self-titled album in that vein as The Electric Light Orchestra (titled No Answer in the U.S.). Lynne’s song “10538 Overture” became a U.K. hit from that record at #9. The Move LP Message From The Country was recorded at the same time and came out a few months earlier giving them their only U.S. chart single in “Do Ya” (1972 – “#93). Wood left quickly to form Wizzard who had British success with rockers like “See My Baby Jive” and “Are You Ready To Rock?”. Lynne and Bevan stayed with The Electric Light Orchestra and under that name or the shorter ELO became bigger U.S. stars with songs like “Don’t Bring Me Down” and “Mr. Blue Sky” not to mention a redone “Do Ya”.\n\n3.Green Day – Foxboro Hot Tubs – The Network\n\nStop Drop & Roll!!! – Money Money 2020 Pt II: We Told Ya So! – these are a couple of Green Day albums under the group names of Foxboro Hot Tubs and The Network respectively. The Foxboro Hot Tubs album (2008) is a great attempt at sounding like a late ’60s rock band a la The Yardbirds or The Count Five. The Network on the other hand is more New Wave (and you have to go check out their videos with the guys wearing face masks like Los Straitjackets). Their first album came out in 2003 (rereleased in 2004) with their second late in 2020. For those who don’t know Green Day, they have steadily become one of the biggest American rock bands of the last few decades with records like American Idiot and Dookie. You have to give a lot of credit to these guys for making music fun.\n\n4.Simon & Garfunkel – Tom & Jerry\n\nThose of us boomers who only knew Simon & Garfunkel as a serious folk-rock duo (starting with “The Sounds Of Silence” in ’65) had to laugh when they dabbled in rock songs like “Baby Driver”. What we didn’t know was that they actually had started as the pop-rock act Tom & Jerry charting with “Hey, Schoolgirl” in early 1958 (#49). Tom Graph or Artie Garr (Art Garfunkel) and Jerry Landis, Paul Kane or True Taylor (Paul Simon) recorded together and apart before dropping the fake names and signing to Columbia for major success.\n\n5.The Mothers Of Invention – Ruben & The Jets\n\nFrank Zappa’s band The Mothers Of Invention formed in 1964 releasing the classic double LP Freak Out! in 1966 (and finding an audience that was at first small, but devoted). Their fourth LP on Verve was seemingly released as by Ruben & The Jets though on the cover the strangely Zappa-like dog playing guitar does wonder “Is this The Mothers Of Invention recording under a different name in a last ditch attempt to get their cruddy music on the radio?”. The single “Deseri” on Verve was released as by Ruben & The Jets with no mention of The Mothers (though it did say “Produced by Frank Zappa for Bizarre Productions”). We all thought The Mothers were making fun of doo-wop music not realizing that Mr. Zappa and singer Ray Collins were actually big fans of that style. Buyers beware, however, do not accept the awful 1984 redone version Zappa foisted on us for CD. Either look for the original vinyl LP or grab the CD Greasy Love Songs for the classic sound. By the way, to confuse things further there actually was a later band Ruben & The Jets that released two LPs in ’73-’74 but were not members of The Mothers. All the LPs by The Mothers up till at least Weasels Ripped My Flesh (1970) are strongly recommended (though don’t play them in front of your parents – boy did those lyrics get me in trouble with mom and dad!).\n\n6.(Frankie Valli &) The Four Seasons (featuring the “Sound” of Frankie Valli) – The Wonder Who? – The Four Lovers\n\nBeginning with the 1962 #1 single “Sherry”, The Four Seasons were an American success story charting over 40 singles in under 20 years. The one constant throughout their career was the lead vocals of Frankie Valli. With a slightly different line-up they charted one single in 1956 as The Four Lovers – “You’re The Apple Of My Eye” (#62). Next taking the name of a bowling alley, they were reportedly the first white act signed to Vee-Jay Records. After switching to Phillips Records in 1964 their run of hits continued with “Dawn (Go Away)” their first on that label. In ’65 they decided to record some Bob Dylan songs, but Valli was frustrated with his vocal on “Don’t Think Twice” so as a joke he sang it in a pinched falsetto vocal with no intention of it being released. The label, however, loved it and decided to release it under a name other than The Four Seasons – The Wonder Who? – and it hit #9 in 1966. Several other songs came out on singles by The Wonder Who(?) to less success and the name was retired by 1967. Later singles came out with variations of the name The Four Seasons with Frankie Valli’s name added in different ways.\n\n7.Badfinger – The Iveys\n\nThe story of Badfinger is one of the most tragic in music leading to the suicides of the two key members Pete Ham and Tom Evans due to financial difficulties. Your Dentist was and is a huge fan of their music with “Day After Day” perhaps my fave song of all time. As The Iveys, they were the first band signed to The Beatles’ record label Apple. Their debut single “Maybe Tomorrow” came out on Apple in 1968 and was a hit in parts of the world though only charting at #67 in America. Another Iveys single “Dear Angie” and an LP were released only in a few European markets. Still as The Iveys, Paul McCartney gave them the song “Come & Get It” and helped them record it along with a few other tracks to be included in the movie The Magic Christian. Bassist Ron Griffiths left the act just before success came under a new band name – Badfinger. The Beatles song “With A Little Help From My Friends” was originally dubbed “Bad Finger Boogie” as John Lennon had hurt his finger at that time. When “Come & Get It” was a huge hit in early 1970, the LP Magic Christian Music was cobbled together with old Ivey’s tracks. Joey Molland was added on guitar and he has continued to record and keep the Badfinger name alive with the passing of Ham, Evans and drummer Mike Gibbins.\n\n8.Paul McCartney (& Wings) – The Fireman – (Percy “Thrills”) Thrillington\n\nSince we were talking about The Beatles and Apple records, let’s look at Paul McCartney’s aliases as a recording artist. Wings certainly may have been a band in name, but we all knew it as Paul McCartney’s baby. The Thrillington LP was recorded as an instrumental jazzy/orchestrated version of his (and Linda’s) Ram LP of 1971. He didn’t actually play on it and only produced it as Percy Thrillington. The Fireman, however, is McCartney’s outlet for more experimental music done with U.K. producer Youth. Under that name he has released three albums of which the most recent (Electric Arguments – 2008) is the most accessible. While the album did chart at #67 here, one has to wonder if it would have been wiser to release it as a McCartney record giving it bigger sales. By the way, as a songwriter he had written the Peter & Gordon hit “Woman” as Bernard Webb (A. Smith on some pressings of the single). As producer with Gus Dudgeon for The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band record “I’m The Urban Spaceman” he had been Apollo C. Vermouth and let’s not forget that early on he used the pseudonym Paul Ramon (and yes that is where the band name The Ramones came from).\n\n9.Jefferson Airplane – Jefferson Starship – Starship\n\nThese guys have a pretty convoluted history adding and subtracting musicians while changing names willy-nilly – yet all have been successful. Jefferson Airplane was the first San Francisco hippy-era band to break-out with “Somebody To Love” and “White Rabbit” from the 1967 LP Surrealistic Pillow becoming big hits. In 1974 they became Jefferson Starship officially though Paul Kantner (with help from Grace Slick et al) had recorded Blows Against The Empire in 1970 as Jefferson Starship (while Jefferson Airplane was still a band). Former Airplane members Marty Balin and Grace Slick were in and out of the band over time and Mickey Thomas came on to sing lead in 1979. After Kantner decided to leave he sued the band in 1984 and the Jefferson part of the name was retired till he lead a new version of Jefferson Airplane which is till going after his death with no members of the old band still present. Slick left in 1988 to join a reunited Airplane then retired as well. She had the distinction in 1987 till Cher in 1999 (age 52) of being the oldest female to sing lead on a #1 single – “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” (age 47).\n\n10.XTC – The Dukes Of The Stratosphere\n\nYou would have to be a big music nerd like your blogger to probably even know XTC as they were not very successful here in America. Andy Partridge – guitar/vocals, Dave Gregory – guitar and Colin Moulding – bass/vocals were the driving forces behind this Britpop mainly ’80s band. Between 1979 and 1992, they had 10 LPs and 6 singles that charted in the UK top 40 while only “Mayor Of Simpleton” did anything in the U.S. at #72 in 1989. Attempting to emulate ’60s psychedelia, they put out two records as The Dukes of Stratosphear – 25 O’Clock (1985) and Psonic Psunspot (1987). They were later combined in to one excellent CD as Chips From The Chocolate Fireball.\n\n11.Prince (& The Revolution) (& The New Power Generation) – – The Artist Formerly Known As Prince (TFKAB) (The Artist)\n\nPrince Rogers Nelson was a pioneering Minnesota musician who lived from June 7, 1958 till April 21, 2016. His music was rock, R&B, funk, hip hop – you name it. In 1992 Prince & The New Power Generation released a CD credited to an unpronounceable symbol that is essentially a combination of the male (♂) and female (♀) symbols. He had a contentious relationship with Warner Brothers Records at that time and took to writing slave on his face as well. He went back to being Prince in 2000 after his publishing contract expired.\n\n12.The Young Rascals – The Rascals\n\nThis band from New York City charted 18 records on Billboard from 1965 till 1971. Their style was white (aka blue-eyed) soul music. Felix Cavaliere – organ/vocals, Eddie Brigati – vocals, Gene Cornish – guitar and Dino Danelli – drums were the original band mostly coming from Joey Dee’s backing group – The Starliters (“Peppermint Twist”). They started as The Rascals, but before their debut Atlantic record (“I Ain’t Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore”) they became The Young Rascals to avoid conflict with The Harmonica Rascals band. With the 1968 single “A Beautiful Morning” (U.S. #3), they reverted to The Rascals. Once again it becomes difficult to know how to file their records alphabetically (under ‘y’ and ‘r’ or all under ‘r’?) – these are important questions!\n\n13.Chad Allan & The Reflections – Chad Allan & The Expressions – (The) Guess Who (?)\n\nBy their debut 1962 single, this Canadian band was Chad Allan & The Reflections with Chad Allan – vocals, Bob Ashley – piano, Randy Bachman – guitar, Jim Kale – bass and Garry Peterson – drums. In 1965 to avoid conflict with the U.S. band The Reflections, they became Chad Allan & The Expressions. When their eventual #1 1965 Canadian single “Shakin’ All Over” was released, Canuck label Quality was hoping DJ’s would think they were a British group so put ‘Guess Who?’ on the single – not as a band name, but as a confusion tactic. In parenthesis in very small type, the commercial single did say Chad Allan & The Expressions as well. Their first two Canadian LPs were credited to Chad Allan & The Expressions with Guess Who? also listed, but by the time of their third LP when Burton Cummings replaced Ashley on piano they were billed as The Guess Who?. The U.S. “Shakin’ All Over” single on Scepter was credited to Guess Who? but The LP said The Guess Who’s Chad Allan & The Expressions. The question mark at the end of the name stuck around for the 1969 hit “These Eyes” then vanished. Confused?\n\n14.Chicago Transit Authority – Chicago\n\nYour Dentist admits to being ambivalent about horns in a rock band. Starting as The Big Thing in 1968, by the time of their self-titled debut double LP in 1969 they were Chicago Transit Authority. While their cover of “I’m A Man” (The Spencer Davis Group) wasn’t a chart hit, it got played heavily on FM stations like Denver’s KLZ-FM. That song rocked with nary a horn in sight which appealed to the young me. By their 2nd LP, however, they had shortened the name to Chicago and the jazzy horns were all over the place which ruined it for me. I did warm up enough to buy a few 45s over the years, but still don’t think brass works in rock bands other than as occasional coloring – sorry all you trombone players. Gimme a raunchy tenor sax!\n\n15.Paul Revere & The Raiders – Pink Puzz – (The) Raiders\n\nBeginning in 1958, Paul Revere & The Raiders are mostly remembered for their killer string of great singles starting in ’65 – “Steppin’ Out”, “Just Like Me”, “Kicks”, “Hungry”, etc.. Paul Revere Dick dropped his last name and had a perfect band image with Revolutionary War era uniforms plus they had fun choreography. Sadly that likely is the reason why the powers that be have kept them out of the Schlock and Roll Hall Of Fame in Cleveland – wise up voters and put them in! At any rate, the name Paul Revere & The Raiders started to be seen as a hinderance to airplay as radio got more ‘hip’. They tried releasing a record to DJ’s as Pink Puzz hence the name on their 1969 LP Alias Pink Puzz which contained the hit “Let Me”. They next became simply The Raiders (Raiders on singles) and did have a short return to success in 1971 with “Indian Reservation (The Lament Of The Cherokee Reservation Indian)”. When lead singer Mark Lindsay left in ’75 that was pretty much the end. Revere later led Paul Revere & The Raiders as an oldies band without any other ties to their past members. With his death in 2014, they are still flogging it as Paul Revere’s Raiders. Go see Mark Lindsay if you still can though he has largely quit touring.\n\n16.The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band – The Dirt Band – The Toot Uncommons\n\nThey started in California back in ’66 as The Illegitimate Jug Band. Jeff Hanna, Jimmie Fadden and John McEuen were part of the renamed Nitty Gritty Dirt Band who were more of a folk-rock act that threw in some fun curves like “The Teddy Bear’s Picnic”, a song from 1907. Sadly that fun element has disappeared as they got more conventional – you gotta make money, after all. Their biggest early hits were “Mr. Bojangles” and “Buy For Me The Rain”. From 1976 to 1981 they decided that their old name was passé so it was shortened to The Dirt Band for a run of pop singles like “Make A Little Magic” and “American Dream”. In 1982 they went back to the original name and a country style where they found major chart success with songs like “Fishin’ In The Dark” and “Dance Little Jean”. Comedian Steve Martin put out a novelty single in 1978 – “King Tut” – that became a #17 hit and used members of The Dirt Band as musicians under the moniker The Toot Uncommons (a parody of the name Tutankhamun if you didn’t get it, kids).\n\n17.Marty Wilde – Shannon\n\nIn England Marty Wilde (real name Reginald Smith) had a long run of hits starting in 1958 with his cover of “Endless Sleep” (U.K. #4). “Bad Boy” in 1959 hit #7 in the U.K. and the following year became his first 45 to chart in the U.S. at #45. With the name Marty Wilde not sounding very ’60s hip, his 1968 hit North American single “Abergavenny” was released as by Shannon and did chart at #47 here. He has had far more success in the U.S. as a songwriter mostly for his daughter Kim (“Kids In America”, “Love Blonde”).\n\n18.The Who – The High Numbers\n\nOkay, so The Detours became The Who with Roger Daltrey – vocals, Pete Townshend – guitar, John Entwistle – bass and Keith Moon – drums. Manager Pete Meaden decided that they needed to appeal to the U.K. mod movement so released their flop 1964 single “I’m The Face” as by The High Numbers. They went back to being The Who after that and hit right away in the U.K. with “I Can’t Explain” (#8 – 1965). U.S. success took a bit longer, but they never had to play as The High Numbers again.\n\n19.The Astronauts – SunshineWard – Hardwater\n\nIf I didn’t include at least one Colorado act I would be remiss so with apologies to Flash Cadillac who years ago lost ‘& The Continental Kids’ from their name and could be on this list too, we will use The Astronauts. For a thorough Astronauts history you should click on the March 2015 blog link (for a Flash Cadillac history try the Jan. 2016 link). While only charting at #94 nationally in July of 1963, the throbbing surf instrumental Baja hit #1 in Colorado. Most of their ’60s output did the same here in the Centennial State while totally missing the national charts. Curiously, however, they became big stars in Japan for a time putting another instrumental “Movin'” at #1 over there (their “Surf Party” was at #5 that same week). After a few members moved on in 1967 due to the draft or gainful employment, The Astronauts name was retired and one last RCA single was recorded as SunshineWard (the psychiatric wing of a hospital). “Sally Go ‘Round The Roses” b/w “Pay The Price” were fine pop songs that once again didn’t find a national audience. With more changes they recorded an LP as Hardwater for Capitol Records in 1968.\n\n20.Tyrannosaurus Rex – T. Rex\n\nMarc Bolan was born Mark Feld Sept. 30, 1947 and grew up in the London suburbs. He tried his hand at rock stardom starting in 1964 eventually landing with John’s Children 3 years later. When they broke up, he started the folk-rock duo Tyrannosaurus Rex with percussionist Steve Peregrine-Took and managed a U.K. hit with “Debora”. Took was replaced by Mickey Finn while the sound got more electric which lead to his first U.S. chart record “Ride A White Swan” (#76 – 1971). At that time he shortened the band’s name and added more musicians to create a more traditional rock act. As T. Rex less than 4 months after “…Swan” he was at #72 in the U.S. with “Hot Love”. It was the following single “Bang A Gong (Get It On)” (#10 – 1972) that he is most remembered for. In the U.K. Bolan was a huge star for a time in the glam-rock era. He died in a car crash Sept. 16, 1977.\n\n21.Sherbet – The Sherbs\n\nLet’s go way down south for this entry. Sherbet was one of the biggest ’70s bands in their native Australia. They only managed one small U.S. chart placement with the mid-tempo pop record “Howzat” at #61 in 1976. After that they faded in Australia by 1979 and broke up briefly only to reappear as The Sherbs. They did manage a new wave chart record in the U.S. in 1981 with “I Have The Skill” once again only getting to #61.\n\n22.Garth Brooks – Chris Gaines\n\nBorn Feb. 7, 1962, Garth Brooks is a country superstar. His records since 1989 have torn up the country charts with chart-toppers like “The Dance” and “That Summer”. On the regular Billboard charts, however, he only owns one single that rose above #46 and that was “Lost In You” at #5 in 1999. Yet it wasn’t by Brooks if you look at the record, but by a brooding pop singer named Chris Gaines from his The Life Of Chris Gaines album. Apparently this persona was created for a potential movie that never happened and this album was meant as a ‘Greatest Hits’ of Gaines’ career. Brooks’ normal fans were confused and not at all happy, but he had a hit and the album sold in excess of 2 million copies here, so…\n\n23.Cat Stevens – Yusuf (Islam)\n\nLondon born Steven Georgiou took on the stage name of Cat Stevens and had some success in the U.K. in the late ’60s with pop records like “I Love My Dog” and “Matthew & Son”. He became ill with tuberculosis in ’69 and after recovering became more spiritual and started playing a different acoustic-based music. In ’70-71 he released 2 of the best albums of the decade in Tea for the Tillerman and Teaser & The Firecat. At the end of 1977 he converted to the Muslim faith and would change his name to Yusuf Islam. Frankly, we all assumed that was it for his commercial recording career so it was a shock in 2006 when he released a new album An Other Cup. Since then he has sporadically released new albums as Yusuf and they have been good if not as commercially successful. His 2014 album Tell ‘Em I’m Gone included a radical reworking of the old song “You Are My Sunshine”. The Laughing Apple in 2017 was released as by Yusuf/Cat Stevens. He has been a controversial figure since his return to music mainly due to comments he made in ’89 about Salman Rushdie not to mention the U.S. discomfort with Muslims following the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n24.Bay City Rollers – The Rollers\n\nScottish band Bay City Rollers were huge teen sensations in the ’70s with lead singer Les McKeown. They were big in the U.K. since ’73 finally breaking in the U.S. 2 years later with the #1 “Saturday Night”. In the next 2 years they scored 8 American hits then that was it. In 1978 they acquired a new lead singer (Duncan Faure) and took on a rockier sound under the name The Rollers. Those records were decent, but didn’t grab chart success.\n\n25.(Sean) Puffy (Combs) – Puff Daddy – P. Diddy – Diddy – Love (?)\n\nMost definitely not my kind of music, but Sean Combs has probably recorded under more names than anyone so we’ll end with him (though it could have been Snoop Doggy Dogg who also had Snoop Dogg and Snoop Lion as aliases). Born Nov. 4, 1969, New York raised Combs is a rapper who created his own record label (Bad Boy). He claims the nickname ‘Puff’ came about because he would huff and puff when he got angry. In 1997 as Puff Daddy he had the #1 “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down”. As P. Diddy he released the 2001 album The Saga Continues… . In 2005 he changed yet again to Diddy (except in the U.K. where there actually is another performer named Diddy so Combs is still P. Diddy there). Diddy released the 2006 #1 LP Press Play. The last name on the above list may be a joke, but in 2017 he announced that “My new name is Love, aka Brother Love”. Who knows what his name will be next so stay tuned.\n\nThe bulk of this was written just before the shocking death of Adam Schlesinger from the horrible virus that has paralyzed the world. Schlesinger’s name is likely not known by any but the biggest hard-core power-pop fans, but he was a fantastic talent. As co-founder (and multi-instrumentalist/backing vocalist) with lead singer Chris Collingwood of the band Fountains Of Wayne, those 2 co-wrote some great songs. You mostly know them from “Stacy’s Mom”, but they put out many more excellent songs on their 5 albums from 1996 – 2011. Schlesinger wrote the song “That Thing You Do” for the Tom Hanks movie of the same name and also was the main producer on the surprising Monkees 2016 album Good Times! (he also wrote one of the best songs “Our Own World”). He had a side pop music project (Tinted Windows) with Taylor Hanson, Bun E Carlos (Cheap Trick) and James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins). Another of his bands was Ivy. Adam also produced half the soundtrack album to the 2001 Josie & The Pussycats movie and did many other films as well (Shallow Hal, 2 Weeks Notice, etc.). He co-wrote music for the John Waters play Cry-Baby. Check out all these, but in tribute I am going to add a 21st song now to start the blog – the sadly lush Lennonesque “Prom Theme” from the 1999 album Utopia Parkway by Fountains Of Wayne.\n\nYour humble Dentist loves Beatley pop music. You may well ask, just what constitutes Beatlesque pop? Well, let’s go to Merriam-Webster. “Definition of Beatlesque: of, relating to, or suggestive of the musical style or technique of the Beatles.” Okay, well that’s clear. Of course that means, great pop songs with excellent vocal harmonies a la The Everly Brothers using sitars. Ringing 12-string guitars, country flourishes with psychedelic lyrics and orchestrated balladry. Gentle love songs and old-timey music-hall tunes with bombastic thrashing power guitar chording not to mention great piano rock and roll ballads. Huh? Hmmmm… Well to co-opt the immortal 1964 words of Justice Potter Stewart about obscene material (but could have been about the definition of ‘Beatlesque’): “I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it…”- or in this case, hear it. So what follows is part one of an on-going series of quality songs that just feel like The Beatles would have approved of them. The idea is to mostly include bands you likely are not familiar with or perhaps rarer songs by acts you are familiar with. At any given time while it can change, my fave song ever is Badfinger’s “Day After Day” and being on the Beatles’ label Apple it is fitting that perhaps they are the ultimate in what would be considered Beatlesque. The Raspberries, Klaatu, Big Star, Electric Light Orchestra/Jeff Lynne, Oasis, on and on – these are gold standards too. Special mention should go out to Colorado based Not Lame Records and founder Bruce Brodeen who continues to fly the flag for all things pop music with Pop Geek Heaven. If you want to get his emailed newsletter you should contact him at musicgeekheaven@gmail.com to see what is new in the world of pop music. Thanks Bruce for your passion!\n\nThere is a lot here and I don’t expect you to listen to more then a few seconds of each song, but try to give these a chance as many grow on you as the song goes on.\n\n1.The Kaisers – Time To Go\n\nFrankly you could insert virtually anything by this outstanding group of Scots who sounded just like a Merseybeat ’64 band only in the decade from 1992 – 2002. The albums like Beat It Up! and Wishing Street are worth looking for. Some of their best material was recorded by Liam Watson at his Toe Rag Studios in the U.K. that used old analog gear including a mixing board from Abbey Road Studios. Band stall-wort George Miller did several other projects over the years that we may explore later.\n\n2.The Spongetones – Here I Go Again\n\nYet another band with multiple possible songs you could include on this list. This North Carolina band formed in ’79 and are still going with most of the same players – Jamie Hoover, Steve Stoeckel and Pat Walters. Highly recommended are the Beat & Torn compilation and the 1991 album Oh Yeah!.\n\n3.The Weeklings – I’m In Love\n\nWell, I have to say that the band name doesn’t do much for me, but all three of their albums are great Beatle-pop. Former Beatlemania cast member (and current Orchestra bassist) Glen Burtnik is a member. Others in this New Jersey-based band are Bob Burger, John Merjave and Joe Bellia. Their newest album 3 includes a cover of the Beatles song “Baby You’re A Rich Man”. All I can find to post is a live version.\n\n4.Myracle Brah – Love Is\n\nShort in length at 1:38, but long in power-pop punch. While the rest of the oddly titled album Life On Planet Eartsnop is good, this song gives me chills every time I hear it. Leader Andy Bopp from Baltimore has put out some really high quality sounding records since this 1998 indie release that deserve a listen.\n\n5.Rosalie Cunningham – Butterflies\n\nRecalling the pastoral acoustic ballads of the White Album, but with phasing and a middle eight from the psych Beatles era. The one-woman band Cunningham formerly also lead Purson whose LPs were pretty much her as well. This song comes from her self-titled album from 2019 and shows all things Beatlesque are not strictly male.\n\n6.Liverpool – She’s My Little Girl\n\nScandinavian band Liverpool put out an album of mostly solo-era or Beatles band covers called In Our Own Way… in 1997. This song was one of two band originals and certainly sounds of a piece with the early Fab Four. Their album Love Is All was released in 2003 and was all originals.\n\n7.Fastball – Behind The Sun\n\nThis Austin, Texas pop-rock trio is mostly known for their 1998 worldwide hit “The Way”. They continue to release quality product including the 2017 album Step Into The Light from which this haunting Miles Zuniga guitar-ballad was taken.\n\n8.Swag – She’s Deceiving\n\nThe members of this pop collective make for an interesting mix on this 2001 Yep Roc release – Catch-All. They were Tom Petersson (Cheap Trick), Ken Coomer (Wilco), Doug Powell and two members of The Mavericks – Jerry Dale McFadden and Robert Reynolds. Reynolds sang this later-era Lennon sounding plodder before getting ousted from The Mavericks for substance abuse issues. Production was handled by well-known pop producer Brad Jones.\n\n9.The Redwalls – Hung Up On The Way I’m Feeling\n\nWell if this song had been a hit, a case could have been made for adding a John Lennon songwriting credit as it sure sounds a lot like “Sun King” from Abbey Road. On the cover of their 2005 album de nova, The Redwalls certainly looked the part of a ’70s power-pop band and were on the right label (Capitol). At their core were the brothers Logan and Justin Baren from Deerfield, Illinois.\n\n10.The Fraternal Order Of The All – Tomorrow Drop Dead\n\nCould this be any more of an obvious tongue-in-cheek homage to “Tomorrow Never Knows” from Rubber Soul? This was a loving tribute to ’60s psychedelia by the late Andrew Gold (“Thank You For Being A Friend”). The album Greetings From Planet Love was essentially a Gold solo record under the name The Fraternal Order Of The All and came out in 1997.\n\n11.Richard Barone – Nobody Knows Me\n\nThis is a very bright jangly tune with a George Harrison sort of vocal. It was from the third solo album by the former lead singer of The Bongos (“Numbers With Wings”) – Clouds Over Eden (1993). He continues to be active in music living in Greenwich Village.\n\n12.The Shakers – Won’t You Please\n\nThese guys proved just how far the music of The Beatles penetrated the rest of the world back in the ’60s. Hugo, Osvaldo, Pelin & Caio doesn’t roll off the tongue like John, Paul, George & Ringo but in their own way they were ground-breakers in Montevideo, Uruguay. With Beatles haircuts and singing in a language they didn’t speak (English), their debut single in 1965 (“Break It All”) was a hit in South America. In 1966, the U.S. label Audio Fidelity took a chance and released an album titled after that single that included the song “Won’t You Please” (also a hit single) which has a nice swinging Help! era feel to it. After breaking up in 1968 members moved into more Latin styles.\n\n13.Vinyl Kings – I Took A Chance\n\nThe early 2000’s Vinyl Kings albums A Little Trip and Time Machine are both excellent tributes to the music of the Fabs and feature some interesting players. Larry Byrom (Steppenwolf), Larry Lee (Ozark Mountain Daredevils), Jim Photoglo (writer for Alabama, HIghway 101, etc.), Josh Leo (writer for Alabama, Crystal Gayle, etc.) plus country bassist Michael Rhodes and drummer Harry Stinson.\n\n14.Redd Kross – Saragon\n\nThese guys have put out some interesting if quirky pop dating back to the early ’80s with Hawthorne, CA brothers Jeff & Steve McDonald at their core. Admittedly more power-pop than Beatlesque, however they deserve to be mentioned. The brothers still lead a version of the band. This is found on their Phaseshifter album from 1993.\n\n15.Gregg Tripp – Time\n\nWhat a shock it was to hear this song over the Muzak system playing at our local King Soopers Grocery a few years back (sounded pretty good, actually). Tripp is mainly known as a songwriter for hair bands like Cinderella and Vixen, but did put out one solo album in 1991 – Tempus Edax Rerum on the defunct Impact label. He likely made a few bucks by placing his song “I Don’t Want To Live Without You” in the Christian Slater movie Kuffs (though it wasn’t on the released soundtrack).\n\n16.The Korgis – If I Had You\n\nWell this is more George Harrison All Things Must Pass -like admittedly, but he was a member of the Fabs, right? The only U.S. success these guys had was “Everybody’s Gotta Learn Sometime” (#18 1980), but this earlier single hit #13 in the U.K. was on their American album Dumb Waiters. Former Stackridge members Andy Davis (the tallest) and especially lead singer James Warren were essentially the Korgis. They acknowledged their debt to JPG&R with their 2006 single “Something About The Beatles” which is also on youtube.\n\n17.Pete Ham – Makes Me Feel Good\n\nOf all the musical losses due to an early death, next to John Lennon at #1 the saddest would have to rank Pete Ham at #2 for your blogger. This was taken from the second album of Ham demos released with added instrumentation to make them sound more like Badfinger songs (Golders Green – 1999). At least they did have the sense to use a couple of Iveys/Badfinger musicians in Ron Griffiths and Bob Jackson.\n\n18.Cheap Trick – Blackberry Way\n\nWhy Roy Wood and his band The Move did virtually nothing here in the U.S. while being mega-stars in the U.K. has always been puzzling. Their offshoot band ELO at least became superstars but only after Wood left (sigh). Cheap Trick are rightly THE most successful power-pop band and continue to release excellent material including their most recent non-holiday album We’re All Alright (2017). For me, by far the best track was only on the deluxe version and was a fantastic cover of the #1 U.K. single by The Move from 1968. The original psych-pop song was inspired by “Penny Lane” most certainly. Cheap Trick have shown wonderful taste over the years in covering Wood’s “California Man” and The Beatles (“Day Tripper”, “Magical Mystery Tour”, etc.). Thanks again, Rick, for the guitar pick (look at last month’s blog post for a picture of him giving it to me) – now why not cover “Turkish Tram Conductor Blues”?\n\n19.The newno2 – Make It Home\n\nWell if anybody is allowed to release a psychedelic Beatley song it would be George Harrison’s son Dhani, right? Okay, so the background plodding beat sounds modern – well the rest of it is pure Magical Mystery Tour. This came out in 2012 on his band The newno2’s second album thefearofmissingout.\n\n20.Merrymouth – That Man\n\nAs our last entry for part 1 of Beatlesque music, here is one few folks in the U.S. will know as it is from a U.K.-only album by a side-project of Simon Fowler of another U.K.-only successful band – Ocean Colour Scene. This psychedelic song is from their second album Wenlock Hill (2014) which also contains a sad remake of the old song “He Was A Friend Of Mine” with new lyrics about John Lennon."
