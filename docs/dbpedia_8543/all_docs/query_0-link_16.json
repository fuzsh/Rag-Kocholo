        "text": "\"I wasn't expecting to make a record,\" said singer-guitarist Molland, a true Liverpudlian rock star who has lived in the Twin Cities for more than 35 years. \"I am getting old. I'm 73. I can make records in basements, but a full-blown record with a full-blown crew with Mark Hudson producing is something I wasn't really expecting.\"\n\n\"I had all the same influences: Irving Berlin and Cole Porter all the way to the early rock 'n' roll and the advent of R&B. Chuck Berry, Elvis, Little Richard, Buddy Holly, Bill Haley & and the Comets,\" Molland said last week. \"I learned to play all that stuff in Liverpool. And I had the Beatles on top of it.\"\n\nThose influences led Molland to join Badfinger just as the British band — the first group signed to the Beatles' Apple Records — had released the McCartney-penned and -produced \"Come and Get It\" in 1969. That hit and the ensuing \"No Matter What\" and \"Day After Day\" made a splash, but over the years, Badfinger had a streak of bad breaks. An unscrupulous manager underpaid the band, one co-founder committed suicide in 1975, another longtime member hanged himself in '83, and two versions of the band existed simultaneously.\n\nOne good thing happened to Molland on a Badfinger U.S. tour in 1970. After a gig in Fargo, the lads spent three days in Minneapolis visiting their agents at Variety Artists. Molland met his future wife, Kathie, bonding over a long dinner at the old Nankin restaurant in downtown Minneapolis.\n\n\"I wanted to be married and have kids,\" said Molland, who lives in Hopkins, his late wife's hometown. \"My brothers all got married before me. My mum and dad were married forever. Kathie and I were married for 37 years.\"\n\n\"He's as down to earth as a guy could get. I've never seen him pull the 'I'm a rock star' card ever under any circumstances,\" said Minneapolis musician Gregg Inhofer, who has known Molland since the '70s and has played in Joey Molland's Badfinger for the past few years. \"He's just a regular guy. Onstage, he's 14; so I get to be 13. He's still got that feeling that we had when we were kids, that excitement.\"\n\nEven though he does occasional gigs as Joey Molland's Badfinger, the guitarist-singer spent a few months last year on an all-star tour with Todd Rundgren, Christopher Cross and others performing the Beatles' \"White Album.\" That's where Molland got to know the Monkees' Dolenz.\n\nAt a Beatles fest years ago, Molland met Hudson, who has not only worked with Ringo but with Aerosmith (he co-wrote \"Livin' on the Edge\"), Ozzy Osbourne, Bon Jovi, Cher and his family group, the Hudson Brothers.\n\n\"Mark always wants to get up and sing the high harmonies on 'No Matter What,' \" Molland pointed out. \"We've become good friends, and I've tried to get him to produce a record for me, and he eventually agreed.\"\n\nHudson helmed the pre-pandemic recording sessions at studios in Brooklyn and Los Angeles. The songs offer a balance of optimism (the '60-evoking \"Better Tomorrow,\" the dancehall-infused \"Shine\" and the Rundgren-esque \"Heaven\") and unhappiness (the power pop \"I Don't Wanna Be Done With You,\" the Traveling Wilburys-echoing \"All I Do Is Cry\").\n\n\"I've had that song for a long, long time. I wrote the melody 30, 35 years ago,\" Molland said. \"But I never had the lyrics except for the first verse.\"\n\n\"We sat down and had a long conversation in his kitchen. He was a very responsible guy, took care of his wife and kids, never got into any trouble. Then I went home and I wrote the words.\"\n\nIn the studio, Harrison sat with the musicians and taught them the songs. \"Like with 'Beware of Darkness,' he'd sing it to you and you were supposed to pick up the chords. You'd learn the song quickly. We'd have a bit of a laugh, too.\""
