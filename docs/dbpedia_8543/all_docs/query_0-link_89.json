        "text": "I went to see my “Idols”, Badfinger play with Savoy Brown Blues Band at Painter’s Mill Theater in Baltimore, in the early 70’s. I adored that band, they were as close to seeing The Beatles as I would ever get. They were the best 4 piece band I ever saw “Live”.\n\nI had worked as an Usher and ran the door at The Morris A. Mechanic Theater, in my teens so I knew if I went and stood by the stage door, I might get a glimpse of the band when they headed for the stage.\n\nA short man with long white hair appeared at my shoulder and asked, in a thick accent, “Are ya here to see Savoy Brown?’. I said “Oh, no. I am a Badfinger freak!”. He smiled, told me his name was Bill and said “Well. I can get ya back there, but watch out for their manager ’cause he’s a fucker and he’ll run ya off”. I told him I was cool and would be low key. We went back and I hung out until they went on. Their show totally blew me away.\n\nAfter the show Bill waved me back again. I was talking to my heroes, Pete Ham, Joey Molland, Tom Evans and Mike Gibbins. I was in heaven. I was subtly eating deli tray meats and drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. I told Pete “Please tell me if your manager comes in because Bill told me he’d kick me out”. I will never forget the smile on Pete;s face as he said “Bill’s our manager”. He loved the joke.\n\nAfter the show we went to their hotel and partied in the room. There was an acoustic guitar going around and I told Pete that I played and wrote songs. He gave me the guitar and and said “Play me a song.” I played him the first and only song I had ever written at that time. (This actually makes me teary as I write it). I don’t even remember the song aside from the fact it was about my dad leaving when I was a baby. He said “Good song… Don’t ever stop writing and don’t ever stop playing.” I haven’t and I have never forgotten his words of encouragement.\n\nThat same night I sat and played with Mike Gibbins, the drummer, who was as new to playing guitar as I was. I was really nice bonding with him. We mostly played Beatles songs.\n\nJoey Molland taught me about being around celebrities. I was a starstruck kid and was asking him about The Beatles and such. He said “Y’know what?” I don’t wan to talk about that. We get that all the time. Tell me? What did YOU do today?” As we went on he told me about a date he had, as a teen, where he had asked his Mom to take the plastic off their good sofa and, sitting with his date, he accidentally kneed her in her nose and she bled all over his Mom’s good couch. Just people..y’know?\n\nI was lucky enough to hang out with them 3 times, when they came to town. Tom Evens always spotted me first. I remember him grabbing my shirt and pulling me in, past others at the stage door, like “C’mon, I know you!” It really thrilled me, that he recognized me.\n\nWhen I got to the point in my life where I was peer level in the “Austin Music Scene” the first “Tribute” show I ever put on was a Badfinger show because those guys supported me before I ever played in a real band, before I became known as a songwriter. They led me here.\n\nTerribly, sadly, Pete Ham and Tom Evans hung themselves, 8 years apart. Mike Gibbins died in his sleep in 2005. Joey Molland has suffered through some unfair disrespect over the years but he was a good guy and he was in a great band.\n\nWOW!!! Joel McColl is my mentor at Austin Subaru and a good musician friend for years.\n\nJoel just walked into my office and told me his his going to meet his birth family in Madison, WI. I knew Joel was adopted.\n\nHe asks me……”Do you know who Joey Molland is, from Badfinger?” I’m like..”HELL YEAH!”\n\nWell, his wife (a true “Love at First Sight” story), Kathy (R.I.P.) is my sister. So, Joel is off to play with Joel Molland….I asked him to PLEASE thank Joey for me because I don’t know that I would be the musician I am today were it not for the guys in Badfinger inspiring me on when I was just a kid dreaming of Rock and Roll……..\n\nLife is funny, it’s all circles…."
