        "text": "The story of Badfinger is one of rock’s saddest and most tragic tales. But one thing is for certain: the group that practically invented “power pop” was abundantly filled with talent. To have three great songwriters in one band was reminiscent of the group’s original label founders, the Beatles. Badfinger’s singles are still regarded as pop gems some 50 years later: “Come and Get It,” “No Matter What,” “Day After Day,” and “Baby Blue.”\n\nPerhaps the most unheralded of the three in Badfinger was Liverpudlian guitarist Joey Molland. His songwriting talent started to blossom with the group’s finest album, 1971’s Straight Up. Molland contributed five songs to the group’s fourth platter including “I’d Die Babe,” “Sweet Tuesday Morning” and “Suitcase.” Joey continued to play and write as Badfinger motored through the ’70s recording and touring. But great albums like 1974’s Wish You Were Here were met with record company and personal mismanagement. And in 1975, the group’s leader, Pete Ham, tragically passed away.\n\nMolland eventually left the group, returned, and left again to launch his own solo career. He’s played in various groups and under the name Joey Molland’s Badfinger since 1983. His several solo albums won critical acclaim but nothing could have prepared us for his latest album.\n\nOmnivore Recordings is proud to announce the release of Be True to Yourself, a tour de force pop album by Molland co-written with producer Mark Hudson (producer of last year’s Losst And Founnd by Harry Nilsson, also on Omnivore). Street date is October 16th.\n\nThe album is filled with delicious pop hooks and features musical contributions from Joey’s friends (Julian Lennon, Micky Dolenz, Jason Scheff and Steve Holley). With front and back cover photography by Julian Lennon, this album is a veritable feast for the eyes andears! So, sit back and “take it all” in from one of the genre’s progenitors … Be True to Yourself by Joey Molland.\n\nToday Glide is excited to premiere the music video for “Rainy Day Man,” a song that takes us on a journey back to the golden days of power pop. Though Molland may have aged, his sound is still fresh and his lyrical approach resonates with youthful vigor. With big jangly guitar hooks, sunny backgroun harmonies, and an exuberant beat, the song soars with a big rock sound that culminates in some fine solo work from Molland. The song was inspired by an idea from songwriter and producer Gary Burr, a big Badfinger fan and great friend of producer Mark Hudson, who finished the writing with Molland. Fans of Badfinger will definitely get a taste of their classic power pop sound in this song.\n\nMolland describes the process behind the song:\n\n“Gary Burr* emailed the original idea to Mark and I, he said “do what you like with it”, so Mark and I did what we liked with it. Mark pretty much rewrote this song for me, he kept all my guitar bits though, and again, we think it turned out pretty well.”\n\nWATCH:\n\nPhoto: Jim Vasquez / Courtesy of Conqueroo"
