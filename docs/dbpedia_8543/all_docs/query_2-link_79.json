        "text": "Vanilla Fudge will perform at 8 p.m. Friday, at Penn's Peak, 325 Maury Road, Jim Thorpe\n\nHailing from Long Island, New York, Vanilla Fudge's lineup consists of: Mark Stein, vocals and keyboards; Mark Stein, bass and vocals; Carmine Appice; and Vince Martell, guitar and vocals. Bassist Tim Bogert, an original member, retired from touring in 2009.\n\nVanilla Fudge — originally formed in 1965 as blue-eyed soul cover band The Pigeons — infused psychedelia into a heavy-rock sound to create “psychedelic symphonic rock,” a genre which would, among its many offshoots, eventually morph into heavy metal.\n\nIn 1967, the band released its covers-heavy, jam-oriented self-titled debut album, which contained the group's top 10 cover of The Supremes' “You Keep Me Hangin' On.” Vanilla Fudge, which recorded five albums between 1967 and 1969, toured with Jimi Hendrix, as well as groups like Cream, Janis Joplin and Jefferson Airplane, as well as the then-fledgling Led Zeppelin.\n\nAfter Vanilla Fudge disbanded in 1970, group members went on to other projects, eventually reforming Vanilla Fudge in 1984. Inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006, the band released its latest album, “Spirit of 67,” in 2015.\n\nJoey Molland's Badfinger will also perform. The band features Molland, a member of the original Badfinger, guitar and vocals; Mark Healey, bass and vocals; Steve Wozny, keyboards and vocals; and Mike Ricciardi, drums. Former Badfinger member Bob Jackson formed his own version of Badfinger in 2015 to honor the memory of original members Pete Ham, Tom Evans and Mike Gibbins.\n\nOriginally formed in 1961 in Wales, England, as The Iveys, Badfinger signed to Apple Records in the late 1960s. The band scored its first top 10 single on Billboard's Hot 100 chart with “Come and Get It,” which Sir Paul McCartney wrote and produced (Badfinger members wrote all the band's songs). Badfinger collaborated with Beatles members on several hits, including “Day After Day,” which George Harrison produced for Badfinger. The band also appeared on albums by George Harrison and John Lennon, as well as Ringo Starr's single “It Don't Come Easy.”\n\nBadfinger released eight studio albums between 1970 and 1981. Though Badfinger didn't release it as a single, 1970's “Without You” went on to become a sizable hit for both Harry Nilsson and Mariah Carey. In all, more than 180 artists have covered the song. In 2000, a new Badfinger album, “Head First” — recorded 26 years prior — hit stores, marking the group's final studio album.\n\nTickets are $29.
