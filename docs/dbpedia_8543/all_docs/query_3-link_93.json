        "text": "One of the best bands to ever come out of the 70’s was Badfinger. It was also a band cursed with more than their share of bad luck, bad timing and bad management that eventually led to tragedy.\n\nThe band originally consisted of Pete Ham, Mike Gibbins, Tom Evans and Joey Molland; evolving from The Iveys; formed by Ham, Ron Griffiths and David “Dai” Jenkins in Swansea, Wales, in the early 1960s. Joey Molland joined the group in 1969, following the departure of Griffiths.\n\nSigned by the Beatles’ Apple label in 1968 as The Iveys, they adopted the name Badfinger in 1969. Badfinger had four consecutive worldwide hits from 1970 to 1972: Come and Get It (written and produced by Paul McCartney), No Matter What ,Day After Day, and Baby Blue. The Ham/Evans-penned Badfinger song Without You became a Billboard number one hit for Harry Nilsson.\n\nIn 1970, the band engaged American businessman Stan Polley to manage their commercial affairs. Over the next five years the band recorded several albums for Apple and toured extensively, but became embroiled in the chaos of Apple Records’ dissolution. For many years Badfinger’s albums were not available on CD because their rights were tied up in the Apple litigation.\n\nBadfinger ultimately signed to Warner Bros., but Polley’s financial machinations resulted in a lawsuit by Warner Bros., over missing escrow account money. Warner’s consequent withdrawal from the marketing of the 1974 album, Wish You Were Here (seven weeks after its release), cut off the band’s income.\n\nOver the previous year, Warner Brothers’ publishing arm had become increasingly troubled by a lack of communication from Polley regarding the status of an escrow account of advance funds. Per their contract, Polley was to deposit $250,000 into a mutually accessible account for safekeeping, which both Warner Publishing and the band could potentially access. But Polley did not reveal the account’s whereabouts to Warner Publishing, and he reportedly ignored warnings to do so. Unknown to the band, threats of litigation had been going on behind the scenes.\n\nPolley’s next ploy was to press the band to pass up a US tour to go back into Apple Recording Studios to record its third album under the Warner Brothers’ contract. Over only eleven days at the Apple studio tracks were recorded for the Head First album (eventualy released in 2000), and rough mixes were distributed to the musicians and Warner Brothers Records in America. The album could not be formally accepted by Warner Bros., because their publishing arm had already filed a lawsuit against Polley and Badfinger in the L.A. Superior Court, in December 1974.\n\nPolley had hoped submitting the Head First tapes would secure at least one more album cash advance before the litigation, but Warner Brothers refused to accept the tapes and never paid for the sessions. The legal action led to the company stopping the promotion of Wish You Were Here after seven weeks,and ending distribution worldwide, thus completely halting Badfinger’s career.\n\nWith their current album suddenly withdrawn and their follow-up rejected, Badfinger spent the early months of 1975 trying to figure out how to proceed under the unclear legal situation. Salaries were no longer arriving and panic set in, especially for Ham, who had recently bought a house in Surrey and whose girlfriend was expecting a child. The band tried to continue without Polley’s involvement by contacting booking agents and prospective managers throughout London, but they were routinely declined because of their restrictive contracts with Polley and impending legal actions. Ham reportedly tried on many occasions to contact Polley by telephone during the early months of 1975, but was never able to reach him.\n\nOn the night of April 25, 1975, Ham received a phone call from the United States, telling him that Polley and all the band’s money had disappeared. Later that night he met Tom Evans and they went to a pub together, where Ham drank ten whiskies. Evans drove him home at three o’clock on the morning and Ham hanged himself in his garage studio later that morning.\n\nIn his suicide note—addressed to his girlfriend, Anne Herriot, and her son, Blair—blamed Polley for much of his despair and inability to cope with his disappointments in life.\n\nThe note read:\n\n“Anne, I love you. Blair, I love you. I will not be allowed to love and trust everybody. This is better. Pete. P.S. Stan Polley is a soulless bastard . I will take him with me”\n\nHam had shown growing signs of mental illness over the past months, with Gibbins remembering him putting out cigarettes on his hands and arms. Ham’s daughter, Petera, was born one month after his death.\n\nThe next three years saw surviving members trying to rebuild their personal and professional lives against a back drop of lawsuits. By 1977, both Molland and Evans were out of the music business. Molland later described his dire economic circumstances: ”\n\nThank God I had guitars and amps and I was able to sell some of that stuff. We were flat broke, and that’s happened to me three times, where my wife and I have had to sell off everything and go and stay with her parents or do whatever. I installed carpeting for a while in Los Angeles and stuff like that. You do what you’ve got to do to survive.”\n\nIn London, Evans briefly had jobs insulating pipes, and driving a taxi. Collins was having trouble paying the lease on the group’s two-room rehearsal studio in London. After advertising for new occupants, he was contacted by Malcolm McLaren, manager of The Sex Pistols, who gave Collins £650 and a Fender Rhodes piano as down payment.\n\nHaving seen Ham ‘s body after Ham’s wife had called him, Evans reportedly never got over his friend’s suicide, and was quoted as saying in darker moments, “I wanna be where he is.” On November 19, 1983, Evans also took his own life by hanging.\n\nSuch a tragic end to a very talented group of musicians. I often wonder why one of the Beatles, particular ly McCartney never stepped into offer assistance to these guys.\n\nHere is Baby Blue… my favorite of their offerings that was written by Pete Ham in 1971 about a woman named Dixie Armstrong (see photo attached) whom he had met and dated during their US tour through the southern states that year.\n\nEnjoy (or not). https://youtu.be/C53QAuOoSgc\n\nRick\n\npete-ham-and-the-inspiration-for-his-song-e2809cbaby-bluee2809d-the-beautiful-dixie.jpg"
