        "meta_description": "In Episode 63, Badfinger’s Joey Molland talks to Mike Derrico about his new solo album Be True to Yourself. Molland is the lead guitarist and vocalist in the classic lineup of Badfinger that rose to the top of the pop charts in the late 1960s and early 70s with hits like “Come and Get It,” “Baby Blue,” “No Matter What,” and “Day After Day.” Molland has stayed musically active over the decades and discusses various records and periods in his career as well as various projects he has been involved with, including recording with George Harrison, John Lennon, Leon Russell, and Badfinger’s role in the Concert for Bangladesh. &nbsp; As a rock and roll podcast, Rock Under Fire makes it a point not to focus on any one particular artist, band, or genre of music, but with that comes the reality that the show may not always appeal to everyone at the same time. The seven decades of rock and roll music along with its even longer history leaves an extremely broad canvas to create discussions on, drawing from different areas with each episode. So there is still always something for everyone. &nbsp; In past episodes we've discussed The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Prince, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Kiss, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, The Eagles, The Who, Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd, the Monterey Pop Festival, Woodstock, Doo Wop, The Beach Boys, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Steely Dan, The Strokes, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, The Doors, Patti Smith, The Ramones, Jimi Hendrix, Metallica, Guns n Roses, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, The Velvet Underground, the Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Cars, Cheap Trick, Heart, Dave Grohl, Jack White, digital streaming, the state of the music industry and record labels, the effect of rap and hip hop on rock, Neil Young, Talking Heads, Counting Crows, Boston, The Temptations, Bon Jovi, AC/DC, the Smithereens, Suzanne Vega, Van Halen, Rick Rubin, The Gun Club, Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Allman Brothers, Eric Clapton, Steve Vai, Yngwie Malmsteen, The Mekons, UFO, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Chuck Klosterman, John Philip Sousa, Billy Joel, The Wipers, Iron Maiden, Kurt Vonnegut, Tom Waits, Thin Lizzy, the Bee Gees, Mozart, Beethoven, Puccini, Bob Marley, 5 Seconds of Summer, Twenty One Pilots, Ed Sheeran, J Geils Band, Billy Miller, Chris Cornell, Turn Me On Dead Man, the Desert Trip concerts, aging rock stars, our favorite debut albums, soundtracks, music licensing, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, disco vs. rock, Ticketmaster, Tom Petty, and most overrated and underrated artists. We've also been joined by special guests such as, author and photographers Bob Gruen, STARZ guitarist Richie Ranno, Joe Long of the Four Seasons, Lydia Criss, author and pop culture critic Alice Echols, writer and director Michael Lee Nirenberg, original MTV VJ Nina Blackwood, author Robert Duncan, P.J. Farley of Trixter and Judas Priest legend KK Downing.    \"Bad News\" is written and performed by Live Animals of NJ",
