        "text": "'Call me out'. Hilarious.\n\nNo, I am not concerned about my tone. It's a classic pundit argument - say something ridiculous and then get all huffy when the response is, 'well, that's a load of self-righteous baloney'. The rest of the band is dead (yes, Ron Griffiths is alive but Joey replaced him), so if Joey wants to tour as Badfinger, that's as honest as you can get. He's the only one left. If you are some cave dwelling ***** who can't bring themselves to google a 40 year old band to see who's there and who isn't, then you get what you deserve. I had that much personal responsibility, or let's say shrewdness, when I was 12 (before the internet gave us ALL the 'inside' scoop. You don't have to be on the 'inside'. How preposterous. It takes 7 seconds to look up Badfinger. If you're prepared to go see a band, but don't have the wherewithal, in this day and age, to check the line-up, then **** ya. You're an idiot. That's not a lofty perch, it's simply not giving a pass on stupidity. You're quite familiar with not giving 'passes', so you should get that.\n\nNo more hilarious than making a post that reads in its entirety \"How inane.\" If I hadn't responded, you would have left it at that, and imagined that you had won a great victory.\n\nGiven your subsequent level of discourse, perhaps that would have been better for you after all.\n\nObviously not. I'm not permitted to say \"give a pass\"; however, it's perfectly OK for you to say \"Who the **** is going to Badfinger and not knowing what they're getting? Ignoramuses,\" \"cave-dwelling *****,\" and \"**** ya. You're an idiot.\"\n\nNice double standard you've got going there.\n\nI'll leave it to others to judge who the description \"all huffy\" better applies to: you or me.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I'm smiling all the way through our exchanges. I'm getting a real kick out of them.\n\nWho has died and who has not is immaterial to truth in labeling. When Ringo dies, will it be OK for Paul to go out as \"The Beatles\"?\n\nI wonder just how far you'd like to take this \"honesty\" of yours. Here's some test cases I'm sure you'll ignore. How would you feel about:\n\n• Jimmy Griffin touring as \"Bread\"\n\n• Ted Gerow touring as \"The Five Man Electrical Band\"\n\n• Jim Kale and a bunch of ringers touring as \"Guess Who\" (which of course, has happened on many occasions)\n\n• Jay Ferguson touring as \"Spirit\" (yes, he was their lead singer, but he played no instrument with them, and the band's best-known songs were written by Randy California)\n\n• Roger McGuinn touring as \"The Byrds\" (something he's never done, despite having a lot more justification for doing so than Joey has).\n\nOn this last point, I'm one of the world's biggest Gene Clark fans, but it was very wrong for him to have appeared as simply \"The Byrds\" any time in his career. In fact, when promoters didn't take things into their own hands, Gene was billed primarily as \"A Tribute to The Byrds\" or \"Gene Clark of The Byrds.\"\n\nThat's how Joey Molland should be billed. The only problem I have with anything he's doing is when it's called simply \"Badfinger.\" His presentation is no more Badfinger than any of the above examples would be of their respective bands.\n\nWell, what a pity that not all of the world is as savvy (not to mention charming) as you are.\n\nThe fact is, there are truth in advertising laws on the books, the basic premise of which is the consumer shouldn't have to go to any extraordinary measures to determine the validity of any advertiser's claim. An advertiser who misrepresents the nature of his product or service is liable for prosecution. They can't get off the hook by saying \"Well, consumers should have looked into what we were saying more closely.\"\n\nAs I noted earlier (don't recall if it was in this thread or another one), there have been major legislative efforts over the years to take a similar approach to how musical groups represent themselves. I could reproduce some of that here, but I can see I won't have to, as I'm sure you'll apply your superior skills and look it up yourself (assuming you're not too afraid of what you'll find!).\n\nI would say that we all \"get\" you quite well.\n\nMost bookings list it as \"Badfinger Featuring Joey Molland\", or \"Joey Molland's Badfinger\". But even on the occasions where the band does get simply billed as \"Badfinger\", who cares? Who exactly is challenging this? Last night I saw Soul Asylum and Dave Pirner was the only original member left in the band. And although one original guy has passed away, they've got other members who could be there and choose not to. With Badfinger, there is no other person (Ron Griffiths and Bob Jackson notwithstanding) who could potentially lay any kind of claim to being part of Badfinger in any way, shape or form. Joey is it. He's the only one left.\n\nWhen he's on stage, he makes no effort to mask the fact that Tom and particularly Pete were the guys who had written and/or sung the hits. Even to the casual observer, it's going to be evident from the start that HE is the only guy from the classic lineup. There's no deception. If there was, I'd be the first to call him on it, because I cherish that band every bit as much as I'm sure you do.\n\nIt's certainly not a requirement -- but the information's out there. It's out in the open, and information is more easily attainable than ever. If you went to see the Stones in 2013 and thought you'd be seeing Brian Jones and Bill Wyman, then that's YOUR problem. Not the Stones'.\n\nYeah, I'm sure he's not upset when it happens. Why are you so against this man making a living playing the songs he recorded with the band 40+ years ago??\n\nAgain, there's no deception. The diehard fans know all about the Badfinger story. The casual fans don't care. We live in a world where Journey plays large summer sheds with a Steve Perry soundalike, so that should tell you how much the casual fan cares who's on stage. The casual fan wants a night of good music, and they get it with Joey's band, plain and simple. And the Badfinger fans get a chance to see the only living member of that band do all the old songs. Everyone wins. No one is having any wool pulled over their eyes. NO ONE.\n\nI've seen Joey live at least 15 times, and although I admit (as I stated earlier in the thread), it was somewhat disappointing when he used to tour as a trio, it was still musically very good. Particularly since he started touring as a five-piece about 13-14 years ago, I have never ONCE seen anyone who appeared to be confused or let down by the quality of the band, or by the interpretations of the songs -- which are FAR closer to the sound of the records than you seem to think. He plays almost everything in the original keys, the harmonies are there, the arrangements are faithful. They're GOOD.\n\nSeriously? That's just nonsense. You're comparing apples and oranges. Joey was in the band and has every right to state \"Here's a song we recorded...\" -- you're seriously going to take the leap and compare this to a phony band that is ACTUALLY a deception? Wow. Just....wow.\n\nWell, yeah -- of course it's frustrating and I wish it didn't exist. But I have to give the guy a pass, because I have to assume that the ONLY reason something like that would be recorded at all would be because he was severely strapped for cash. Tom and Joey had both done something similar in 1978 by re-recording \"Come And Get It\" for a K-Tel comp (with far superior results, compared to Joey's re-recordings) because they were desperate for the money.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure that Joey's savvy enough to have had the foresight to know that the recordings would be endlessly repackaged for decades -- but even if he did, the fact that it seems to have all been done out of desperation, rather than with any malicious intent, makes it hard for me to put much, if any, blame on the guy for it.\n\nMaybe I'm giving people too much credit to think for themselves, but if you're in a store and you see a professional-looking CD on a major label with high quality artwork called The Very Best of Badfinger, and it's $14 -- and you still take a gamble on the $5 budget CD with artwork that looks like your neighbor made it at home, then it really should be no surprise that you didn't get the original recordings. The copy I bought years ago (knowing full well what it was) is credited to \"Badfinger featuring Joey Molland\", so that should be clue number one. Plus, if you're going through Amazon or any online service, I'm sure there are enough bad reviews that should steer a novice clear."
