        "text": "This article is about the band. For their eponymous album, see Badfinger (album).\n\nBadfinger were a Welsh rock band formed in 1961 in Swansea, Wales. Their best-known lineup consisted of Pete Ham (guitar), Mike Gibbins (drums), Tom Evans (bass), and Joey Molland (guitar). They are recognised for their influence on the 1970s power pop genre. It is estimated that the band sold 14 million records.[1][2]\n\nInitially known as the Iveys, the band renamed themselves Badfinger, after the working title for the Beatles' 1967 song \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" (\"Bad Finger Boogie\"). From 1968 to 1973, Badfinger recorded five albums for Apple Records and toured extensively, before they became embroiled in the chaos of Apple's dissolution.\n\nBadfinger had four consecutive worldwide hits from 1970 to 1972: \"Come and Get It\" (written and produced by Paul McCartney, 1970), \"No Matter What\" (produced by Mal Evans, 1970), \"Day After Day\" (produced by George Harrison, 1971), and \"Baby Blue\" (produced by Todd Rundgren, 1972). Their song \"Without You\" (1970) has been recorded many times, and became a US and UK number-one hit for Harry Nilsson in 1972 and a UK number-one for Mariah Carey in 1994."
