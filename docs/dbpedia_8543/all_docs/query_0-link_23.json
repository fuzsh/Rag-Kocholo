Liverpool native Joey Molland joined Badfinger in 1969, just after the group recorded “Come and Get It,” and was a full-fledged member for the group’s final three albums on Apple.\n\nMolland, who continues to tour under the Badfinger name, married a Minnesotan and has lived in the Twin Cities since 1985. We spoke to him about his own memories of the house the Beatles built:\n\n“The only real crazy times were the Christmas parties, with various Beatles and guests drinking, eating and having a lot of fun. Generally, when I went into Apple, it was a quiet place. I have great memories of sitting in (Apple head) Neil Aspinall’s office by the fireplace, watching old Beatles movies. And being in the press office with Derek Taylor and seeing (for my first time) John Lennon come in, and not even having the nerve to look at him.\n\n“There are all kinds of memories, like the Rolling Stones brushing past me in the hallway between the mastering suite and the studio. They weren’t a lot taller than me, either.\n\n“And Apple always had really good tea.\n\n“The Beatles treated us like their own and gave us carte blanche at Abbey Road Studios. We wanted to do nothing but the best, and we aimed high. Of course, we were just a little satellite going around a big planet, but some of that radiance rubbed off on us. The band and the songs got stronger and stronger.\n\n“Eventually, it was kind of embarrassing (that Badfinger was continually compared to the Beatles). The Beatles were the Beatles, we weren’t the Beatles. But we came from the same town, we listened to the same music growing up, we watched the same TV shows, we liked the same things. What can I tell you? I think sometimes people expected to see George Harrison up there playing with us, you know? I always said, ‘We don’t sound like the Beatles, we sound like Badfinger.’ ”\n\n— Ross Raihala\n\nOriginally Published: October 26, 2010 at 11:01 p.m."
