        "text": "I’ve been reading a book about the band, Badfinger called Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger. It’s written by Dan Matovina and it’s an interesting tale because they had the worst luck and got ripped off by a crooked manager and after selling millions of records the band found themselves without any money. They were the first band signed by The Beatles to their Apple label in 1968 and their first hit, “Come And Get It,” was written and produced by Paul McCartney. They had other hits and their song, “Without You,” which was written by Pete Ham and Tom Evans was a huge international hit for Harry Nilsson and later Mariah Carey. Both Ham and Evans would end up distraught over their financial situation and they both committed suicide by hanging themselves. You can read more about the band and its unusual rock ‘n roll tale in the six links below. Then there’s the MBIP Coming Attractions for next week.\n\nBadfinger - The Directors Cut - The Complete 1997 Documentary - This is a great documentary with some really good bonus footage as well. It tells the whole sad story of Badfinger.\n\nBadfinger: bad breaks, dumb luck and sheer tragedy - This is an all-inclusive feature article that details the history and horrible luck the band had. At one point, two of them had committed suicide, one was laying carpet for a living and the other was drumming for a one-hit wonder.\n\nJoey Molland on Badfinger & The Beatles - An interview from 2015 with guitarist, Joey Molland, the last living member of Badfinger. This quote says it all: “It’s a sad story, this band.”\n\nTop 10 Badfinger Songs - A list of ten of their best songs complete with video links for your listening pleasure!\n\nThe Life of a Song: ‘Without You’ - In typical Badfinger fashion, a song that was written by Pete Ham and Tom Evans (the two who committed suicide) was a huge hit for other artists, but not for the band! This is the history of that song.\n\nWhy 'Breaking Bad' Chose Badfinger's 'Baby Blue' - The TV series, “Breaking Bad,” brought a whole new audience to Badfinger when their song, “Baby Blue” was used in the closing of the last episode. Too bad three quarters of the band was dead by then!\n\nTomorrow’s post is from a birthday celebration we had at Jim’s Steakhouse last night! It was my friend Artie Fowler’s birthday and we celebrated with his girlfriend Sandra and their long-lost friend, August! Tuesday we continue our chilly ice cream tour and we’re up to week number three of ten weeks, tune in to find out where we got this week’s brain freeze at! Wednesday is going to be kind of a dead day because I’m taking a tour of the historic Springdale Cemetery, which by the way is the location of the book that Lisa and I are working on! Thursday I’m featuring a rare video with a TV screen test and I’ll be writing and featuring photos and links related to that. Then I’ll be taking Friday and Saturday off and then on next Sunday we’ll do it all again! We’ll see you all tomorrow!\n\nRelated Posts: Sunday Links: July 30, 2017, July 23, 2017 and July 16, 2017."
