        "text": "From Bob Dylan to Prince, Minnesota has produced some great musicians.\n\nOne rock and roll star has called the Twin Cities home for nearly four decades.\n\nJoey Molland of the band Badfinger lives in Hopkins.\n\n\"I love it here,\" Molland said. \"It’s a great place, great musicians, great clubs.\"\n\nGrowing up in Liverpool, England Molland’s rise to stardom would have a Beatles connection when he became a member of the group Badfinger. The band was signed by Apple Records, the Beatles record label. Badfinger’s song \"Come and Get It\" was written by Paul McCartney.\n\n\"It was a big hit all over the world,\" Molland said. \"It was like I won the lottery or something, you know?\"\n\nMolland recently put out a new CD and hopes to tour again soon. As the sole surviving member of Badfinger, Molland looks back on his life as a dream.\n\n\"I feel so lucky and blessed. It’s like a miracle like the good lord leaned down pushed me into it.\""
