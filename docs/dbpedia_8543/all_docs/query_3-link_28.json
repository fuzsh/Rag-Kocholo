        "text": "Badfinger's Singles Tom Brennan's Badfinger Library Badfinger's Albums Dan Matovina's Badfinger Biography \"Without You\"\n\nIveys and Badfinger\n\nby Bryan Waller\n\nPete Ham formed the Iveys in his hometown, Swansea, Wales, in 1966. They were Pete, Mike Gibbins, Ron Griffiths, and Dai Jenkins. By 1967, they wrote their own songs and were successful playing clubs around Swansea and, occasionally, in London. They got a manager, Bill Collins, and he let them stay in his house in London. There, they began writing dozens of songs - except for Dai; he was soon replaced by Tom Evans of Liverpool.\n\nIn 1968, the Beatles' road manager, Mal Evans, became interested in them and had the Iveys signed to Apple Records. They recorded many songs, but none were released. Finally, their first single, \"Maybe Tomorrow\" was released late in 1968. It was a hit in Europe and a minor hit in the US. The follow-up, \"Dear Angie\" was released only in Europe; it was their only record to feature Ron Griffiths prominently. Apple put together an album, \"Maybe Tomorrow\", but issued it only in Germany, Italy, and Japan. Many of the Iveys' stronger songs were left off in favor of more harmonic selections. Today, this album is one of the most sought after collector's items.\n\nPaul McCartney soon took an interest in the band and gave them a song called \"Come and Get It\" which he had written for \"The Magic Christian\", an upcoming film starring Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr. The Iveys changed their name to Badfinger and landed their first international hit record. Simultaneously, Ron Griffiths' newly-married lifestyle forced him from the group. He is seldom credited for his contribution to their success and was never paid.\n\nJoey Molland from Liverpool soon joined the band and immediately contributed a strong, guitar-based influence to their music. 1970's \"No Dice\" is one of three albums that may be considered their best (along with \"Straight Up\" and \"Wish You Were Here\").\n\nPete Ham stands out on \"No Dice\" with his expressive, natural poetry. Pete's ability to communicate simply and elegantly is the ideal to which other artists strive. He and Tom Evans collaborated on \"Without You\" after Pete had disappointed his girlfriend. They treated it modestly while Harry Nilsson took it to number one around the world the next year. Since then, \"Without You\" has become one of the most recorded and recognized pop songs of all time. Pete's \"Midnight Caller\" is a clever, sympathetic tribute to a call girl. It becomes poignant when you learn he was writing about a friend of his who had turned to prostitution. \"No Matter What\" is a worldwide smash that defines the term \"power pop.\" Pete opens the album with a blistering rocker, \"I Can't Take It\" and closes it with the beautiful \"We're for the Dark\".\n\nBadfinger's artistic success was continued with 1972's \"Straight Up\". Despite setbacks such as having to rerecord the album and switch producers from George Harrison to Todd Rundgren, the band delivered a pop-rock masterpiece. \"Day After Day\" is an evergreen hit that sounds fresh after nearly thirty years. In the late 1980s, Goldmine Magazine surveyed record collectors and named \"Straight Up\" the album most desired to be issued on CD. At the time, good copies routinely sold for over $100.\n\nSuccess was firmly in place as Badfinger's contract with Apple neared its end. The band signed with manager Stan Polley in New York and decided to leave Apple Records for a multimillion-dollar deal with Warner Brothers.\n\nBadfinger recorded their final album for Apple, \"Ass\", and prepared to move to Warners. At this point, their fate took a wrong turn. Apple delayed their album for a year. Then Warner Brothers issued their first album, \"For Love or Money\", at the same time; sales of both records suffered. Although Badfinger's management company was taking in millions, the band members lived on a meager allowance and often received nothing.\n\nThe band regrouped and went to Colorado to record \"Wish You Were Here\", a stunning album that flows with high energy from beginning to end. Artistically it was a high point for them, but personally it was a harbinger of tragedy. Friction between Joey Molland and Pete Ham prompted Joey to leave the group. Bob Jackson joined the band, and Stan Polley rushed them back into the studio where they recorded \"Head First\" (finally released for the first time on CD, November, 2000). In early 1975, \"Wish You Were Here\" was getting good critical reviews and picking up sales. $100,000 disappeared from Badfinger's escrow account at Warner Brothers, and the record company pulled \"Wish You Were Here\" from distribution. In April, 1975, Pete Ham took his own life at the age of 27.\n\nTom Evans and Joey Molland did not try again until 1979. Airwaves is a fine album, but without Pete Ham, it's missing something essential to Badfinger's sound and style. 1981's \"Say No More\" is equally good and also misses something.\n\nTom and Joey toured to support \"Airwaves\". Back stage at the Roxy in Los Angeles, they said that Elektra had just dropped them. John Entwistle was in the audience and left early; he told Rick Taylor that they were too loud. Tom and Joey decided not to tour with \"Say No More\"; they would wait for a single to climb the charts. Radio Records pulled their promotional support. Tom and Joey split and played dates on their own. In November, 1983, Tom Evans ended his own life in the same manner as Pete Ham.\n\nIn 1995, Apple Records finally issued the \"Best of Badfinger\"; in November, 2000, Capitol Records issued \"The Very Best of Badfinger\" including songs from their Apple and Warner Brothers albums. Joey Molland lives in the Twin Cities, and still performs as Badfinger; he will release a new album in January, 2001. Mike Gibbins lives in Florida and has just released \"More Annoying Songs\". Tom Evans has a son, and Pete Ham has a daughter, both of whom deserve more than to hear their fathers only on records."
