In the wake of the Breaking Bad, finale where the song Baby Blue was used about as perfectly as I ever seen in a TV production, I realized that I had never owned anything by this band, but always kind of dug their sound.  I decided to pick up Best Of Badfinger Volumes 1 and 2 and have been really enjoying them.  Definitely a Beatles sound to a lot of their stuff, and they also remind me of The Hollies in places.",
