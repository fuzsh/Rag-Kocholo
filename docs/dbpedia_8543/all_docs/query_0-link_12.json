They were a pretty musical family and when Joey was 11 he took up the guitar. \"I heard Elvis doin' Blue Suede Shoes, on the radio and that was it for me.\" Joey joined a group at school when he was 13. When Joey was 16, he got the chance to play with some real downtown players and started to play around town a lot, he was working a day job on the docks of Liverpool at the time, soon though he made the step into being a musician full time, he made his first record in 1965. After a couple of years doing road and studio work, Joey was asked to audition for The Iveys, a group signed to Apple, the Beatles record and publishing company. Joey got the job, and the band became Badfinger. The band went on to record the hits, \"Come and Get it,\" \"No Matter What,\" \"Baby Blue,\" \"Day After Day,\" as well as the original version of the classic, \"Without You.\" Joey also played on George Harrison's All Things Must Pass and The Concert For Bangla-Desh albums and John Lennon's Imagine album.
