        "text": "OK...we all know it was Pete Ham. But who would you vote for the number 2 position? I think I would go with Joey Molland. I really a lot of his tunes particularly on NO DICE, STRAIGHT UP, and AS$. The medleys he co-wrote on WISH YOU WERE HERE are great too. What's your pick?\n\nEvans Apple Highlights - Without You, Beautiful and Blue, Believe Me, It's Over (w/Molland), Flying (w/Molland)\n\nMolland Apple Highlights - Sometimes, Love Me Do, Suitcase, I Don't Mind, The Winner, Sweet Tuesday Morning,\n\nOn this basis, although Evans co-wrote Without You, the Molland Songs are stronger, IMHO. (plus Molland did write the \"comeback\" hit, \"Love is Gonna Come at Last\" from Airwaves)\n\nStill, it's REAL close between the two.......................\n\nSurprisingly I found myself voting for Joey Molland, but only since:\n\nA. his compositons came most easily to mind\n\nB. Tom Evans was somewhat under-represented especially on the last few albums, but that seemed to be partly his choice (I think?).\n\nNot to take away from Tom who could write some great songs (Blind Owl particularly), but although he was not as good a vocalist, Joey Molland wrote some very catchy songs (I'd Die Babe being an example - not to mention all the tunes he wrote for the A$$ album).\n\n---------- Chris\n\nTommy gets my vote. I like Joey Molland's songs but they are often fairly formulaic rockers. Of course, Badfinger are better than most bands with that type of material but my real favourites are the ones with slightly more interesting melodies and chord structures. On top of that I feel that Joey isn't always opening himself up emotionally with his vocal perfomances - \"I Can Love You\" would be an exception to that rule.\n\nIn contrast, Tommy wrote some great tunes and performed them in a really heartfelt way that makes the songs get to me. For example, \"Believe Me\" is a really great song made even better by the performance. \"Where Do We Go From Here\" could be a fairly un-memorable song if it wasn't for Tommy's great performance.\n\nAs you can see, I give Tommy my vote based not only on his songwriting ability but also his honest and raw delivery. I think these two elements are inseperable when assessing a perfoming artist's songwriting.\n\nI love \"I'd Die Babe\". I believe I heard in an interview George Harrison plays acoustic guitar on that one. Other JM favorites for me are...\n\nSuitcase\n\nSometimes\n\nI Don't Mind (which he wrote with Tom Evans)\n\nBetter Days (also written with Tom I Think)\n\nFlying (Hey he wrote some great ones with Tom!)\n\nIcicles\n\nMeanwhile Back At The Ranch/Should I Smoke (written with Pete)\n\nConstitution\n\nIf anyone is a big JM fan I would suggest picking up his last album called THIS WAY UP. It is really solid IMO. Joey still writes great tunes. I would even say that some of the songs on TWU are as good as some of his Badfinger tunes.\n\nHarry Nilsson really made the song \"without you\" what it is. The melodies are almost a different song, especially the chorus. Sorry to be harsh but lets be honest the band was great because of Pete Ham's songs and vocals and a couple of songs from the other guys were kind of good."
