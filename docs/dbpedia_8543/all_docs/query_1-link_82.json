        "text": "MUSIC HISTORY\n\nBadfinger was the first signing to The Beatles’ Apple label. They had a distinctly Beatle sound that became even more pronounced due to the connections with the band.\n\nOriginally The Iveys from Wales and Liverpool, they were renamed Badfinger by The Beatles’ road manager, Neil Aspinal. Badfinger was a term commonly used by The Beatles to describe a wounded finger that hampered their playing.\n\nBad Finger Boogie was the working title of With A Little Help From My Friends because John Lennon was suffering from a damaged finger during the recording. The expression was also evident in the Get Back film when Lennon referred to a Badfinger hampering his guitar playing at one stage.\n\nGeorge Harrison said it was originally a nickname they gave to a stripper they knew in Hamburg in the ’50s. I don’t want to know why.\n\nBack to Badfinger the band.\n\nDespite selling 14 million albums in the early seventies, their success collapsed into acrimony, debt and death.\n\nThe Promise"
