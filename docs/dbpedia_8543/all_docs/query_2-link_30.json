        "text": "By Rebekah Bretl, '13\n\nJoey Molland, the last surviving member of the iconic rock band Badfinger, will perform an acoustic concert on Thursday, Feb. 28, at 8 p.m. in Rosch Recital Hall on the SUNY Fredonia campus.\n\nMolland’s appearance has been made possible through SUNY Fredonia’s Music Business Department and its Student Record Label class. The concert, which is free and open to the public, will feature Molland and accompanist Paul Davie, who will perform songs from his upcoming CD, “Return to Memphis,” along with past Badfinger hits.\n\nIn addition, on Tuesday, Feb. 26, Molland will give a talk at 6:15 p.m. in G-24 McEwen Hall, during which he will discuss his career and, in particular, his harsh experiences with recording labels and the business side of the industry. This lecture is also free and open to the public.\n\nTo learn more, contact SUNY Fredonia Music Industry Professor Armand Petri, at Petri@fredonia.edu.
