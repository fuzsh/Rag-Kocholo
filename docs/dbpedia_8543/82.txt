Joey Molland is best known for being a member of Badfinger, the Beatles' protege band on Apple Records. He auditioned for Badfinger in November of 1969, joined the group shortly after, and remained with them until 1974. From Come and Get It and No Matter What to Day After Day, their driving sound made them an instant sensation in the early 1970s.

In addition to his work with Badfinger, Molland played guitar on George Harrison's albums All Things Must Pass and The Concert for Bangladesh and played on John Lennon's Imagine.

Joey is a native Liverpudlian who will be telling great stories from those hectic Apple days. He will be performing his hits (and a few Beatles songs) with Liverpool on Saturday and Sunday evenings.
