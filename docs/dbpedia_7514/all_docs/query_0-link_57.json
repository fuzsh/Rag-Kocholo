S. Navy during World War II he received a PhD degree from Princeton University in 1949.\n\nMassey dissertation, entitled Classification of mappings of an (n+1)-dimensional space into an n-sphere, was written under the direction of Norman Steenrod.\n\nMassey spent two additional years at Princeton as a post-doctoral research assistant.\n\nMassey then taught for ten years on the faculty of Brown University. From 1960 till his retirement he was a professor at Yale University.\n\nWilliam S. Massey passed away at 96 years old."
