This document discusses the axiomatic definition of homology theory given by Eilenberg and Steenrod in 1945. The key points are:\n\n1. Eilenberg and Steenrod defined what properties a category must satisfy in order to support a homology theory, including containing points and pairs/triples of spaces. \n\n2. An admissible category for homology theory must be closed under certain constructions like products and mappings between lattices of pairs. \n\n3. A homotopy between maps is defined as a map of pairs of spaces times an interval satisfying boundary conditions.",
