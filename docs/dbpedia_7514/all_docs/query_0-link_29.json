This in turn leads to large uncertainties in the\ncontributions of the direct and indirect aerosol forcing on climate. Using\nthe Global Aerosol Synthesis and Science Project (GASSP) database â the\nlargest synthesised collection of in situ aircraft measurements currently\navailable, with more than 1000 flights from 37 campaigns from around the\nworld â we investigate the vertical structure of submicron aerosols across\na wide range of regions and environments. The application of this unique\ndataset to assess the vertical distributions of number size distribution and\ncloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the global aerosolâclimate model\nECHAM-HAM reveals that the model underestimates accumulation-mode particles\nin the upper troposphere, especially in remote regions. The processes\nunderlying this discrepancy are explored using different aerosol\nmicrophysical schemes and a process sensitivity analysis. These show that\nthe biases are predominantly related to aerosol ageing and removal rather\nthan emissions.",

These aerosols previously had a cooling effect, which the regulations might reduce, revealing more greenhouse gas warming. Here we find that while there is regional warming, the global 2020–2040 temperature rise is only +0.03°C. This small change is difficult to distinguish from natural climate variability, indicating the regulations have had a limited effect on observed warming to date.\n\nVirtual Integration of Satellite and In-situ Observation Networks (VISION) v1.0: In-Situ Observations Simulator\n\nMaria Rosa Russo, Sadie L.

Proper comparison requires generating, storing and handling a large amount of data. This manuscript describes the first step in the development of a new set of software tools, the ‘VISION toolkit’, which can enable the easy and efficient integration of observational and model data required for model evaluation.\n\nIsolating aerosol-climate interactions in global kilometre-scale simulations\n\nRoss J.

Here we use a new km-scale global model representing an important step towards the necessary scale. We focus on how aerosol particles modify clouds, radiation, and precipitation. We find the magnitude and manner of responses tend to vary from region to region, highlighting the potential of global km-scale simulations and a need to represent aerosols in climate models.\n\nOpinion: Why all emergent constraints are wrong but some are useful – a machine learning perspective\n\nPeer Nowack and Duncan Watson-Parris\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1636,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1636, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn our Opinion article, we review uncertainties in global climate change projections and current methods using Earth observations to constrain them, which is crucial for climate risk assessments and for informing society. We then discuss how machine learning can advance the field, discussing recent work that provides potentially stronger and more robust links between observed data and future climate projections. We further discuss challenges of applying machine learning to climate science.\n\nBiomass Burning Emissions Analysis Based on MODIS AOD and AeroCom Multi-Model Simulations\n\nMariya Petrenko, Ralph Kahn, Mian Chin, Susanne E.

In regions where plumes are thick and background aerosol is low, models and satellites compare well. However, the input emission inventory tends to underestimate in many places, and particle property and loss-rate assumptions vary enormously among models, causing uncertainties that require systematic in-situ measurements to resolve.\n\nInteractions between atmospheric composition and climate change â progress in understanding and future opportunities from AerChemMIP, PDRMIP, and RFMIP\n\nStephanie Fiedler, Vaishali Naik, Fiona M.

Thus, climate model experiments are performed and compared. The results of climate model experiments differ, as assessed in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report. This article gives insights into the challenges and outlines opportunities for further improving the understanding of climate change. It is based on views of a group of experts in atmospheric composition–climate interactions.\n\nHow well are aerosolâcloud interactions represented in climate models? â Part 1: Understanding the sulfate aerosol production from the 2014â15 Holuhraun eruption\n\nGeorge Jordan, Florent Malavelle, Ying Chen, Amy Peace, Eliza Duncan, Daniel G.

This two-part study uses observations and models to quantify this relationship’s impact on the Earth’s energy budget. Part 1 suggests the models capture the observed spatial and chemical evolution of the plume, yet no model plume is exact. Understanding these differences is key for Part 2, where changes to cloud properties are explored.\n\nAn Extensible Perturbed Parameter Ensemble (PPE) for the Community Atmosphere Model Version 6\n\nTrude Eidhammer, Andrew Gettelman, Katherine Thayer-Calder, Duncan Watson-Parris, Gregory Elsaesser, Hugh Morrison, Marcus van Lier-Walqui, Ci Song, and Daniel McCoy\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2165,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2165, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe a dataset where 45 parameters related to cloud processes in the Community Earth System Model v2 (CESM2) Community Atmosphere Model v6 (CAM6) are perturbed. Three sets of perturbed parameter ensembles (263 members) were created; current climate, pre-industrial aerosol loading and future climate with sea surface temperature increased by 4-degree K.\n\nRapid saturation of cloud water adjustments to shipping emissions\n\nPeter Manshausen, Duncan Watson-Parris, Matthew W.

Phys., 23, 12545–12555, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12545-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12545-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol from burning fuel changes cloud properties, e.g., the number of droplets and the content of water. Here, we study how clouds respond to different amounts of shipping aerosol. Droplet numbers increase linearly with increasing aerosol over a broad range until they stop increasing, while the amount of liquid water always increases, independently of emission amount. These changes in cloud properties can make them reflect more or less sunlight, which is important for the earth's climate.\n\nIdentifying climate model structural inconsistencies allows for tight constraint of aerosol radiative forcing\n\nLeighton A.

We show that structural deficiencies in a climate model are exposed by comprehensively exploring parametric uncertainty and that these deficiencies limit how much the model uncertainty can be reduced through observational constraint. This provides a future pathway towards building models with greater physical realism and lower uncertainty.\n\nIdentifying climate model structural inconsistencies allows for tight constraint of aerosol radiative forcing\n\nLeighton A.

Chem. Phys., 22, 10789–10807, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10789-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10789-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtensive stratocumulus clouds over the south-eastern Atlantic (SEA) can lead to a cooling effect on the climate. A key pathway by which aerosols affect cloud properties is by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Here, we investigated the source attribution of CCN in the SEA as well as the cloud responses. Our results show that aerosol nucleation contributes most to CCN in the marine boundary layer. In terms of emissions, anthropogenic sources contribute most to the CCN and cloud droplets.\n\nModel evaluation of short-lived climate forcers for the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme: a multi-species, multi-model study\n\nCynthia H.

Atmospheric models are often used to provide information to policy makers about current and future conditions under different emissions scenarios. In order to have confidence in those simulations, in this study we compare simulated air pollution from 18 state-of-the-art atmospheric models to measured air pollution in order to assess how well the models perform.\n\nOpportunistic experiments to constrain aerosol effective radiative forcing\n\nMatthew W.

Examples include volcanoes, industrial chimneys, forest fires, and ship stacks. These sources provide opportunistic experiments with which to quantify the role of aerosols in modifying cloud properties. We review the current state of understanding on the influence of aerosol on climate built from the wide range of natural and anthropogenic laboratories investigated in recent decades.\n\nModel calibration using ESEm v1.1.0 â an open, scalable Earth system emulator\n\nDuncan Watson-Parris, Andrew Williams, Lucia Deaconu, and Philip Stier\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7659–7672, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7659-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7659-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Earth System Emulator (ESEm) provides a fast and flexible framework for emulating a wide variety of Earth science datasets and tools for constraining (or tuning) models of any complexity. Three distinct use cases are presented that demonstrate the utility of ESEm and provide some insight into the use of machine learning for emulation in these different settings. The open-source Python package is freely available so that it might become a valuable tool for the community.\n\nAerosol absorption in global models from AeroCom phase III\n\nMaria Sand, BjÃ¸rn H.

A total of 15 different aerosol models from AeroCom phase III have reported total aerosol absorption, and for the first time, 11 of these models have reported in a consistent experiment the contributions to absorption from black carbon, dust, and organic aerosol. Here, we document the model diversity in aerosol absorption.\n\nOn the contribution of fast and slow responses to precipitation changes caused by aerosol perturbations\n\nShipeng Zhang, Philip Stier, and Duncan Watson-Parris\n\nAtmos.

We introduced a method to decompose rainfall changes into contributions from clouds, aerosols, and clear–clean sky from an energetic perspective. It provides a way to better interpret and quantify the precipitation changes caused by aerosol perturbations.\n\nThe CLoudâAerosolâRadiation Interaction and Forcing: YearÂ 2017 (CLARIFY-2017) measurement campaign\n\nJim M.

This study provides an overview of a measurement campaign called the cloud–aerosol–radiation interaction and forcing for year 2017 (CLARIFY-2017) and documents the rationale, deployment strategy, observations, and key results from the campaign which utilized the heavily equipped FAAM atmospheric research aircraft.\n\nCloud adjustments dominate the overall negative aerosol radiative effects of biomass burning aerosols in UKESM1 climate model simulations over the south-eastern Atlantic\n\nHaochi Che, Philip Stier, Hamish Gordon, Duncan Watson-Parris, and Lucia Deaconu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 17–33, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe south-eastern Atlantic is semi-permanently covered by some of the largest stratocumulus clouds and is influenced by one-third of the biomass burning emissions from African fires. A UKEMS1 model simulation shows that the absorption effect of biomass burning aerosols is the most significant on clouds and radiation. The dominate cooling and rapid adjustments induced by the radiative effects of biomass burning aerosols result in an overall cooling in the south-eastern Atlantic.\n\ntobac 1.2: towards a flexible framework for tracking and analysis of clouds in diverse datasets\n\nMax Heikenfeld, Peter J.

It provides a flexible new way to include the evolution of individual clouds in a wide range of analyses. It is developed as a community project to provide a common basis for the inclusion of existing tracking algorithms and the development of new analyses that involve tracking clouds and other features in geoscientific research.\n\nWater vapour adjustments and responses differ between climate drivers\n\nÃivind Hodnebrog, Gunnar Myhre, BjÃ¸rn H.

Here we investigate how various gases and particles impact atmospheric water vapour and its lifetime, i.e., the average number of days that water vapour stays in the atmosphere after evaporation and before precipitation. We find that this lifetime could increase substantially by the end of this century, indicating that important changes in precipitation patterns are excepted.\n\nEvaluation of global simulations of aerosol particle and cloud condensation nuclei number, with implications for cloud droplet formation\n\nGeorge S.

This study evaluates the skill of global models to simulate aerosol, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs). Model results show reduced spread in CDNC compared to CCN due to the negative correlation between the sensitivities of CDNC to aerosol number concentration (air pollution) and updraft velocity (atmospheric dynamics).\n\nThe global aerosolâclimate model ECHAM6.3âHAM2.3 â Part 1: Aerosol evaluation\n\nIna Tegen, David Neubauer, Sylvaine Ferrachat, Colombe Siegenthaler-Le Drian, Isabelle Bey, Nick Schutgens, Philip Stier, Duncan Watson-Parris, Tanja Stanelle, Hauke Schmidt, Sebastian Rast, Harri Kokkola, Martin Schultz, Sabine Schroeder, Nikos Daskalakis, Stefan Barthel, Bernd Heinold, and Ulrike Lohmann\n\nGeosci.

The updated version of HAM contains improved descriptions of aerosol processes, including updated emission fields and cloud processes. While there are regional deviations between the model and observations, the model performs well overall.\n\nCommunity Intercomparison Suite (CIS) v1.4.0: a tool for intercomparing models and observations\n\nDuncan Watson-Parris, Nick Schutgens, Nicholas Cook, Zak Kipling, Philip Kershaw, Edward Gryspeerdt, Bryan Lawrence, and Philip Stier\n\nGeosci.

Users can now use a single tool to not only view plots of satellite, aircraft, station or model data, but also bring them onto the same spatio-temporal sampling. This allows robust, quantitative comparisons to be made easily.

None of the loss and production pathways explored can explain the nitrate bias alone. The model’s inability to capture the variability in the observations remains and requires future investigation to avoid biases in policy-related studies (i.e., air quality, health, climate impacts of these aerosols).\n\nDetermination of the Atmospheric Volatility of Pesticides using Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometry\n\nOlivia Mae Jackson, Aristeidis Voliotis, Thomas J. Bannan, Simon P. O'Meara, Gordon McFiggans, Dave Johnson, and Hugh Coe\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2380,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2380, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper details a method of measuring volatility of pesticides using chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (CIMS) to calculate vapour pressure. This was then compared to current literature values and commonly used models. The exact nature of the literature values often remain uncertain due to being hidden in industrial reports. The results show that the method used primarily matches current literature values and any difference can be explained by method differences either in the methodology.\n\nA systematic evaluation of high-cloud controlling factors\n\nSarah Wilson Kemsley, Paulo Ceppi, Hendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Philip Stier, and Peer Nowack\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We find a discrepancy between optimal domain size for predicting locally and globally aggregated cloud radiative anomalies and identify upper-tropospheric static stability as an important high-cloud controlling factor.\n\ntobac v1.5: introducing fast 3D tracking, splits and mergers, and other enhancements for identifying and analysing meteorological phenomena\n\nG.

Here, we present the latest version of tobac, v1.5, which substantially improves scientific capabilities and computational efficiency from the previous version. These enhancements permit new uses for tobac in atmospheric science and potentially other fields.\n\nWeak surface temperature effects of recent reductions in shipping SO2 emissions, with quantification confounded by internal variability\n\nDuncan Watson-Parris, Laura J.

These aerosols previously had a cooling effect, which the regulations might reduce, revealing more greenhouse gas warming. Here we find that while there is regional warming, the global 2020–2040 temperature rise is only +0.03°C. This small change is difficult to distinguish from natural climate variability, indicating the regulations have had a limited effect on observed warming to date.\n\nGeneral circulation models simulate negative liquid water pathâdroplet number correlations, but anthropogenic aerosols still increase simulated liquid water path\n\nJohannes MÃ¼lmenstÃ¤dt, Edward Gryspeerdt, Sudhakar Dipu, Johannes Quaas, Andrew S.

These particles change how much sunlight clouds reflect to space, an important human perturbation of the climate, whose magnitude is highly uncertain. We found that the latest climate models show a negative correlation but a positive causal relationship between aerosols and cloud water. This means we need to be very careful when we interpret observational studies that can only see correlation.\n\nLong-term evaluation of commercial air quality sensors: an overview from the QUANT (Quantification of Utility of Atmospheric Network Technologies) study\n\nSebastian Diez, Stuart Lacy, Hugh Coe, Josefina Urquiza, Max Priestman, Michael Flynn, Nicholas Marsden, Nicholas A.

The objective was to evaluate the performance of a range of commercial products and also to nourish the different applications in which these technologies can offer relevant information.\n\nPerformance Evaluation of Atmotube Pro sensors for Air Quality Measurements\n\nAishah Shittu, Kirsty Pringle, Stephen Arnold, Richard Pope, Ailish Graham, Carly Reddington, Richard Rigby, and James McQuaid\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1685,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1685, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Measurement Techniques (AMT).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study highlighted the importance of data cleaning in improving the raw Atmotube Pro PM2.5 data. The data cleaning method was successful in improving the inter-sensor variability among the Atmotube Pro sensors data. This study showed 62.5 % of the sensors used for the study exhibited greater precision in their measurements. The overall performance showed the sensors passed the base testing recommended by USEPA using one-hour averaged data.\n\nVirtual Integration of Satellite and In-situ Observation Networks (VISION) v1.0: In-Situ Observations Simulator\n\nMaria Rosa Russo, Sadie L.

Proper comparison requires generating, storing and handling a large amount of data. This manuscript describes the first step in the development of a new set of software tools, the ‘VISION toolkit’, which can enable the easy and efficient integration of observational and model data required for model evaluation.\n\nGaps in our understanding of ice-nucleating particle sources exposed by global simulation of the UK climate model\n\nRoss J.

However, in many weather and climate models cloud ice is not linked to aerosol that are known to nucleate ice. Here we report the first steps towards representing ice-nucleating particles within the UK's Earth System Model. We conclude that in addition to ice nucleation by sea spray and mineral components of soil dust we also need to represent ice nucleation by the organic components of soils.\n\nIsolating aerosol-climate interactions in global kilometre-scale simulations\n\nRoss J.

Here we use a new km-scale global model representing an important step towards the necessary scale. We focus on how aerosol particles modify clouds, radiation, and precipitation. We find the magnitude and manner of responses tend to vary from region to region, highlighting the potential of global km-scale simulations and a need to represent aerosols in climate models.\n\nOpinion: Why all emergent constraints are wrong but some are useful – a machine learning perspective\n\nPeer Nowack and Duncan Watson-Parris\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1636,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1636, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn our Opinion article, we review uncertainties in global climate change projections and current methods using Earth observations to constrain them, which is crucial for climate risk assessments and for informing society. We then discuss how machine learning can advance the field, discussing recent work that provides potentially stronger and more robust links between observed data and future climate projections. We further discuss challenges of applying machine learning to climate science.\n\nBiomass Burning Emissions Analysis Based on MODIS AOD and AeroCom Multi-Model Simulations\n\nMariya Petrenko, Ralph Kahn, Mian Chin, Susanne E.

In regions where plumes are thick and background aerosol is low, models and satellites compare well. However, the input emission inventory tends to underestimate in many places, and particle property and loss-rate assumptions vary enormously among models, causing uncertainties that require systematic in-situ measurements to resolve.\n\nHigh ice-nucleating particle concentrations associated with Arctic haze in springtime cold-air outbreaks\n\nErin N. Raif, Sarah L. Barr, Mark D. Tarn, James B. McQuaid, Martin I. Daily, Steven J. Abel, Paul A. Barrett, Keith N. Bower, Paul R. Field, Kenneth S. Carslaw, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1502,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1502, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce-nucleating particles (INPs) allow ice to form in clouds at temperatures warmer than -35°C. We measured INP concentrations over the Norwegian and Barents seas in weather events where cold air is ejected from the Arctic. These concentrations were among the highest measured in the Arctic and it is likely that the INPs were transported to the Arctic from distant regions. These results show it is important to consider hemispheric-scale INP processes to understand INP concentrations in the Arctic.\n\nWeak liquid water path response in ship tracks\n\nAnna Tippett, Edward Gryspeerdt, Peter Manshausen, Philip Stier, and Tristan W. P. Smith\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1479,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1479, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nShip emissions can form artificially brightened clouds, known as ship tracks, and provide us with an opportunity to investigate how aerosols interact with clouds. Previous studies that used ship tracks suggest that clouds can experience large increases in the amount of water (LWP) from aerosols. Here, we show that there is a bias in previous research, and that when we account for this bias, the LWP response to aerosols is much weaker than previously reported.\n\nWarming effects of reduced sulfur emissions from shipping\n\nMasaru Yoshioka, Daniel P. Grosvenor, Ben B. B. Booth, Colin P. Morice, and Kenneth S. Carslaw\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1428,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1428, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSulfur emissions from shipping has been reduced by about 80 % as a result of the new regulation introduced in 2020. This has reduced aerosol in the atmosphere and its cooling effect through interactions with clouds. As a result, our coupled climate model simulations predict a global warming of 0.04 K averaged over three decades, potentially surpassing the Paris target of 1.5 K or contributing to recent temperature spikes, particularly notable in the Arctic with a mean warming of 0.15 K.\n\nDeep Convective Microphysics Experiment (DCMEX) coordinated aircraft and ground observations: microphysics, aerosol, and dynamics during cumulonimbus development\n\nDeclan L.

The campaign coordinated a broad range of instrumentation measuring aerosol, cloud physics, radar signals, thermodynamics, dynamics, electric fields, and weather. The project's objectives included the utilisation of these data with satellite observations to study the anvil cloud radiative effect.\n\nA Lagrangian perspective on the lifecycle and cloud radiative effect of deep convective clouds over Africa\n\nWilliam K. Jones, Martin Stengel, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 5165–5180, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5165-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5165-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStorm clouds cover large areas of the tropics. These clouds both reflect incoming sunlight and trap heat from the atmosphere below, regulating the temperature of the tropics. Over land, storm clouds occur in the late afternoon and evening and so exist both during the daytime and at night. Changes in this timing could upset the balance of the respective cooling and heating effects of these clouds. We find that isolated storms have a larger effect on this balance than their small size suggests.\n\nEfficient droplet activation of ambient black carbon particles in a suburban environment\n\nPing Tian, Dantong Liu, Kang Hu, Yangzhou Wu, Mengyu Huang, Hui He, Jiujiang Sheng, Chenjie Yu, Dawei Hu, and Deping Ding\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation fraction of BC was higher than for all particles, suggesting higher CCN activity of BC, even though its hygroscopicity is lower. Our research reveals that the evolution of BC's hygroscopicity and its CCN activation properties through atmospheric aging can be effectively characterized by the photochemical age.\n\nEarth Virtualization Engines (EVE)\n\nBjorn Stevens, Stefan Adami, Tariq Ali, Hartwig Anzt, Zafer Aslan, Sabine Attinger, Jaana BÃ¤ck, Johanna Baehr, Peter Bauer, Natacha Bernier, Bob Bishop, Hendryk Bockelmann, Sandrine Bony, Guy Brasseur, David N.

Intercomparison of SPMSs was conducted. All instruments reported similar size ranges and common spectral features. The instrument-specific detection efficiency was found to be more dependent on particle size than type. All instruments differentiated secondary organic aerosol, soot, and soil dust, but had difficulties differentiating among specific minerals and dusts.\n\nInteractions between atmospheric composition and climate change â progress in understanding and future opportunities from AerChemMIP, PDRMIP, and RFMIP\n\nStephanie Fiedler, Vaishali Naik, Fiona M.

Thus, climate model experiments are performed and compared. The results of climate model experiments differ, as assessed in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report.

We use a model that allows us to see where the improvements are greatest (Central Europe) and analyse what sectors are most important for achieving these co-benefits (agriculture/power).\n\nMicrophysical view of development and ice production of mid-latitude stratocumulus during an extratropical cyclone\n\nYuanmou Du, Dantong Liu, Delong Zhao, Mengyu Huang, Ping Tian, Dian Wen, Wei Xiao, Wei Zhou, Baiwan Pan, Dongfei Zuo, Xiange Liu, Yingying Jing, Rong Zhang, Jiujiang Sheng, Fei Wang, Yu Huang, Yunbo Chen, and Deping Ding\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-314,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-314, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy conducting in-situ measurements of the microphysical properties, we investigated the ice production and phase transformation of stratocumulus during an extratropical cyclone over the North China Plain. We find the key factors in controlling secondary ice production, and the microphysical properties of clouds with convective cells under different stages are elucidated, which will improve the understanding of the key processes in controlling the cloud glaciation and precipitation process.\n\nData supporting the North Atlantic Climate System: Integrated Studies (ACSIS) programme, including atmospheric composition, oceanographic and sea ice observations (2016–2022) and output from ocean, atmosphere, land and sea-ice models (1950–2050)\n\nAlexander T.

This two-part study uses observations and models to quantify this relationship’s impact on the Earth’s energy budget. Part 1 suggests the models capture the observed spatial and chemical evolution of the plume, yet no model plume is exact. Understanding these differences is key for Part 2, where changes to cloud properties are explored.\n\nGlobal modeling of aerosol nucleation with an explicit chemical mechanism for highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs)\n\nXinyue Shao, Minghuai Wang, Xinyi Dong, Yaman Liu, Wenxiang Shen, Stephen Arnold, Leighton Regayre, Meinrat Andreae, Mira PÃ¶hlker, Duseong Jo, Man Yue, and Ken Carslaw\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-401,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-401, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHighly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) play an important role in atmospheric new particle formation (NPF). By explicitly coupling the chemical mechanism of HOMs and a comprehensive nucleation scheme in a global climate model. The updated model shows better agreement with measurements of nucleation rate, growth rate, NPF event frequency. Our results reveal that HOMs-driven NPF leads to a considerable increase in particle and cloud condensation nuclei burden globally.\n\nCloud condensation nuclei concentrations derived from the CAMS reanalysis\n\nKaroline Block, Mahnoosh Haghighatnasab, Daniel G.

In this study we present a new global vertically resolved CCN dataset for various humidity conditions and aerosols. It is obtained using an atmospheric model (CAMS reanalysis) that is fed by satellite observations of light extinction (AOD). We investigate and evaluate the abundance of CCNs in the atmosphere and their temporal and spatial occurrence.\n\nAn Extensible Perturbed Parameter Ensemble (PPE) for the Community Atmosphere Model Version 6\n\nTrude Eidhammer, Andrew Gettelman, Katherine Thayer-Calder, Duncan Watson-Parris, Gregory Elsaesser, Hugh Morrison, Marcus van Lier-Walqui, Ci Song, and Daniel McCoy\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2165,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2165, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe a dataset where 45 parameters related to cloud processes in the Community Earth System Model v2 (CESM2) Community Atmosphere Model v6 (CAM6) are perturbed.

We find that the SO2 injection height has a large impact on surface SO2 concentrations and, in some models, radiative flux. These assumptions are a hidden source of inter-model variability and may be leading to bias in some climate model results.\n\nBiomass-burning smoke's properties and its interactions with marine stratocumulus clouds in WRF-CAM5 and southeastern Atlantic field campaigns\n\nCalvin Howes, Pablo E.

The model transports and mixes smoke well but does not fully capture some important processes. These include smoke chemical and physical aging over 4–12 days, smoke removal by rain, sulfate particle formation, aerosol activation into cloud droplets, and boundary layer turbulence.\n\nRapid saturation of cloud water adjustments to shipping emissions\n\nPeter Manshausen, Duncan Watson-Parris, Matthew W. Christensen, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 12545–12555, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12545-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12545-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol from burning fuel changes cloud properties, e.g., the number of droplets and the content of water. Here, we study how clouds respond to different amounts of shipping aerosol. Droplet numbers increase linearly with increasing aerosol over a broad range until they stop increasing, while the amount of liquid water always increases, independently of emission amount. These changes in cloud properties can make them reflect more or less sunlight, which is important for the earth's climate.\n\nInternational airport emissions and their impact on local air quality: Chemical speciation of ambient aerosols at Madrid-Barajas Airport during AVIATOR Campaign\n\nSaleh Alzahrani, DoÄuÅhan KÄ±lÄ±Ã§, Michael Flynn, Paul Williams, and James Allan\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2197,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2197, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper focuses on emissions from aviation activities from an international airport aiming to assess the effect of aviation emissions on the local air quality. The study provided further in-depth information on particle composition measurements and key pollutants observed within an airport environment. Source apportionment analysis PMF identified three different significant sources: Semi Volatile Oxygenated Organic Aerosol, Alkane Organic Aerosol, and More Oxidised Oxygenated Organic Aerosol.\n\nSensitivities of cloud radiative effects to large-scale meteorology and aerosols from global observations\n\nHendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Alyson Douglas, Timothy A.

We present near-global sensitivity patterns to selected thermodynamic, dynamic, and aerosol factors and discuss the physical mechanisms underlying the derived sensitivities. Our study hopes to guide future analyses aimed at constraining cloud feedbacks and aerosol–cloud interactions.\n\nAssimilation of POLDER observations to estimate aerosol emissions\n\nAthanasios Tsikerdekis, Otto P. Hasekamp, Nick A. J. Schutgens, and Qirui Zhong\n\nAtmos. Chem.

However, the actual aerosol emission amount per species is highly uncertain. Thus in this work we correct the aerosol emissions used to drive a global aerosol–climate model using satellite observations through a process called data assimilation. These more accurate aerosol emissions can lead to a more accurate weather and climate prediction.\n\nConcurrent photochemical whitening and darkening of ambient brown carbon\n\nQian Li, Dantong Liu, Xiaotong Jiang, Ping Tian, Yangzhou Wu, Siyuan Li, Kang Hu, Quan Liu, Mengyu Huang, Ruijie Li, Kai Bi, Shaofei Kong, Deping Ding, and Chenjie Yu\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 23, 9385–9399, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9385-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9385-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study for the first time found large amounts of liquid–liquid phase separation particles with soot redistributing in organic coatings instead of sulfate cores in the eastern Tibetan Plateau atmosphere. The particle size and the ratio of the organic matter coating thickness to soot size are two of the major possible factors that likely affect the soot redistribution process. The soot redistribution process promoted the morphological compaction of soot particles.\n\nIdentifying climate model structural inconsistencies allows for tight constraint of aerosol radiative forcing\n\nLeighton A.

Rostron, Hamish Gordon, Grenville Lister, Philip Stier, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8749–8768, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8749-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8749-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol forcing of Earthâs energy balance has persisted as a major cause of uncertainty in climate simulations over generations of climate model development. We show that structural deficiencies in a climate model are exposed by comprehensively exploring parametric uncertainty and that these deficiencies limit how much the model uncertainty can be reduced through observational constraint. This provides a future pathway towards building models with greater physical realism and lower uncertainty.\n\nPollution slightly enhances atmospheric cooling by low-level clouds in tropical West Africa\n\nValerian Hahn, Ralf MeerkÃ¶tter, Christiane Voigt, Sonja Gisinger, Daniel Sauer, ValÃ©ry Catoire, Volker Dreiling, Hugh Coe, Cyrille Flamant, Stefan Kaufmann, Jonas Kleine, Peter Knippertz, Manuel Moser, Philip Rosenberg, Hans Schlager, Alfons Schwarzenboeck, and Jonathan Taylor\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8515–8530, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8515-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8515-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring the DACCIWA campaign in West Africa, we found a 35 % increase in the cloud droplet concentration that formed in a polluted compared with a less polluted environment and a decrease of 17 % in effective droplet diameter. Radiative transfer simulations, based on the measured cloud properties, reveal that these low-level polluted clouds radiate only 2.6 % more energy back to space, compared with a less polluted cloud. The corresponding additional decrease in temperature is rather small.\n\nChange from aerosol-driven to cloud-feedback-driven trend in short-wave radiative flux over the North Atlantic\n\nDaniel P. Grosvenor and Kenneth S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 6743–6773, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6743-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6743-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe determine what causes long-term trends in short-wave (SW) radiative fluxes in two climate models. A positive trend occurs between 1850 and 1970 (increasing SW reflection) and a negative trend between 1970 and 2014; the pre-1970 positive trend is mainly driven by an increase in cloud droplet number concentrations due to increases in aerosol, and the 1970–2014 trend is driven by a decrease in cloud fraction, which we attribute to changes in clouds caused by greenhouse gas-induced warming.\n\nSimulating organic aerosol in Delhi with WRF-Chem using the volatility-basis-set approach: exploring model uncertainty with a Gaussian process emulator\n\nErnesto Reyes-Villegas, Douglas Lowe, Jill S. Johnson, Kenneth S. Carslaw, Eoghan Darbyshire, Michael Flynn, James D. Allan, Hugh Coe, Ying Chen, Oliver Wild, Scott Archer-Nicholls, Alex Archibald, Siddhartha Singh, Manish Shrivastava, Rahul A. Zaveri, Vikas Singh, Gufran Beig, Ranjeet Sokhi, and Gordon McFiggans\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5763–5782, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5763-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5763-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOrganic aerosols (OAs), their sources and their processes remain poorly understood. The volatility basis set (VBS) approach, implemented in air quality models such as WRF-Chem, can be a useful tool to describe primary OA (POA) production and aging. However, the main disadvantage is its complexity. We used a Gaussian process simulator to reproduce model results and to estimate the sources of model uncertainty. We do this by comparing the outputs with OA observations made at Delhi, India, in 2018.\n\nImpact of HO2 aerosol uptake on radical levels and O3 production during summertime in Beijing\n\nJoanna E.

Harrison, Simone Kotthaus, Sue Grimmond, Yele Sun, Weiqi Xu, Siyao Yue, Lianfang Wei, Pingqing Fu, Xinming Wang, Stephen R. Arnold, and Dwayne E. Heard\n\nAtmos. Chem.

In less polluted regions, atmospheric models over-predict HO2 concentrations. In this modelling study, the impact of heterogeneous uptake of HO2 onto aerosol surfaces on radical concentrations and the ozone production regime in Beijing in the summertime is investigated, and the implications for emissions policies across China are considered.\n\nSatellite observations of smokeâcloudâradiation interactions over the Amazon rainforest\n\nRoss Herbert and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4595–4616, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4595-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4595-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide robust evidence from multiple sources showing that smoke from fires in the Amazon rainforest significantly modifies the diurnal cycle of convection and cools the climate. Low to moderate amounts of smoke increase deep convective clouds and rain, whilst beyond a threshold amount, the smoke starts to suppress the convection and rain. We are currently at this threshold, suggesting increases in fires from agricultural practices or droughts will reduce cloudiness and rain over the region.\n\nContribution of regional aerosol nucleation to low-level CCN in an Amazonian deep convective environment: results from a regionally nested global model\n\nXuemei Wang, Hamish Gordon, Daniel P. Grosvenor, Meinrat O. Andreae, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4431–4461, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4431-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4431-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNew particle formation in the upper troposphere is important for the global boundary layer aerosol population, and they can be transported downward in Amazonia. We use a global and a regional model to quantify the number of aerosols that are formed at high altitude and transported downward in a 1000 km region. We find that the majority of the aerosols are from outside the region. This suggests that the 1000 km region is unlikely to be a closed loop for aerosol formation, transport and growth.\n\nLate summer transition from a free-tropospheric to boundary layer source of Aitken mode aerosol in the high Arctic\n\nRuth Price, Andrea Baccarini, Julia Schmale, Paul Zieger, Ian M. Brooks, Paul Field, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2927–2961, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2927-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2927-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nArctic clouds can control how much energy is absorbed by the surface or reflected back to space. Using a computer model of the atmosphere we investigated the formation of atmospheric particles that allow cloud droplets to form. We found that particles formed aloft are transported to the lowest part of the Arctic atmosphere and that this is a key source of particles. Our results have implications for the way Arctic clouds will behave in the future as climate change continues to impact the region.\n\nA semi-Lagrangian method for detecting and tracking deep convective clouds in geostationary satellite observations\n\nWilliam K. Jones, Matthew W. Christensen, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 1043–1059, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-1043-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-1043-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGeostationary weather satellites have been used to detect storm clouds since their earliest applications. However, this task remains difficult as imaging satellites cannot observe the strong vertical winds that are characteristic of storm clouds. Here we introduce a new method that allows us to detect the early development of storms and continue to track them throughout their lifetime, allowing us to study how their early behaviour affects subsequent weather.\n\nIncorporation of aerosol into the COSPv2 satellite lidar simulator for climate model evaluation\n\nMarine Bonazzola, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Chepfer, Po-Lun Ma, Johannes Quaas, David M. Winker, Artem Feofilov, and Nick Schutgens\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 1359–1377, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1359-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1359-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol has a large impact on climate. Using a lidar aerosol simulator ensures consistent comparisons between modeled and observed aerosol. We present a lidar aerosol simulator that applies a cloud masking and an aerosol detection threshold. We estimate the lidar signals that would be observed at 532 nm by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization overflying the atmosphere predicted by a climate model. Our comparison at the seasonal timescale shows a discrepancy in the Southern Ocean.\n\nIdentifying climate model structural inconsistencies allows for tight constraint of aerosol radiative forcing\n\nLeighton A. Regayre, Lucia Deaconu, Daniel P. Grosvenor, David Sexton, Christopher C. Symonds, Tom Langton, Duncan Watson-Paris, Jane P. Mulcahy, Kirsty J. Pringle, Mark Richardson, Jill S. Johnson, John Rostron, Hamish Gordon, Grenville Lister, Philip Stier, and Ken S.

Combined consideration of parametric and structural uncertainties provides a future pathway towards building models that have greater physical realism and lower uncertainty.\n\nIntercomparison of airborne and surface-based measurements during the CLARIFY, ORACLES and LASIC field experiments\n\nPaul A.

Often measurements take place in isolation, but here we compared data from two aircraft and one ground-based site. This was done in order to understand how well measurements made on one platform compared to those made on another. Whilst this is easy to do in a controlled laboratory setting, it is more challenging in the real world, and so these comparisons are as valuable as they are rare.\n\nMultiyear emissions of carbonaceous aerosols from cooking, fireworks, sacrificial incense, joss paper burning, and barbecue as well as their key driving forces in China\n\nYi Cheng, Shaofei Kong, Liquan Yao, Huang Zheng, Jian Wu, Qin Yan, Shurui Zheng, Yao Hu, Zhenzhen Niu, Yingying Yan, Zhenxing Shen, Guofeng Shen, Dantong Liu, Shuxiao Wang, and Shihua Qi\n\nEarth Syst.

These emissions were concentrated in specific periods and areas. Positive and negative correlations between income and emissions were revealed in urban and rural regions. The dataset will be helpful for improving modeling studies and modifying corresponding emission control policies.\n\nComparison of particle number size distribution trends in ground measurements and climate models\n\nVille Leinonen, Harri Kokkola, Taina Yli-Juuti, Tero Mielonen, Thomas KÃ¼hn, Tuomo Nieminen, Simo Heikkinen, Tuuli Miinalainen, Tommi Bergman, Ken Carslaw, Stefano Decesari, Markus Fiebig, Tareq Hussein, Niku KivekÃ¤s, Radovan Krejci, Markku Kulmala, Ari Leskinen, Andreas Massling, Nikos Mihalopoulos, Jane P.

Scott, Henrik Skov, Erik Swietlicki, Thomas Tuch, Alfred Wiedensohler, Annele Virtanen, and Santtu Mikkonen\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We investigated aerosol modes (nucleation, Aitken, and accumulation) separately and were able to show the differences between measured and modeled trends and especially their seasonal patterns. The differences in model results are likely due to complex effects of several processes instead of certain specific model features.\n\nRobust evidence for reversal of the trend in aerosol effective climate forcing\n\nJohannes Quaas, Hailing Jia, Chris Smith, Anna Lea Albright, Wenche Aas, Nicolas Bellouin, Olivier Boucher, Marie Doutriaux-Boucher, Piers M. Forster, Daniel Grosvenor, Stuart Jenkins, Zbigniew Klimont, Norman G. Loeb, Xiaoyan Ma, Vaishali Naik, Fabien Paulot, Philip Stier, Martin Wild, Gunnar Myhre, and Michael Schulz\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 12221–12239, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12221-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12221-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPollution particles cool climate and offset part of the global warming. However, they are washed out by rain and thus their effect responds quickly to changes in emissions. We show multiple datasets to demonstrate that aerosol emissions and their concentrations declined in many regions influenced by human emissions, as did the effects on clouds. Consequently, the cooling impact on the Earth energy budget became smaller. This change in trend implies a relative warming.\n\nSatellite-based evaluation of AeroCom model bias in biomass burning regions\n\nQirui Zhong, Nick Schutgens, Guido van der Werf, Twan van Noije, Kostas Tsigaridis, Susanne E.

Notwithstanding biases in satellite products, they allow model evaluations. We observe large and diverse model biases due to errors in BBA. Further interpretations of AOD diversities suggest large biases exist in key processes for BBA which require better constraining. These results can contribute to further model improvement and development.\n\nEvaluating uncertainty in aerosol forcing of tropical precipitation shifts\n\nAmy H. Peace, Ben B. B. Booth, Leighton A. Regayre, Ken S. Carslaw, David M. H. Sexton, CÃ©line J. W. Bonfils, and John W. Rostron\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1215–1232, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1215-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1215-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnthropogenic aerosol emissions have been linked to driving climate responses such as shifts in the location of tropical rainfall. However, the interaction of aerosols with climate remains one of the most uncertain aspects of climate modelling and limits our ability to predict future climate change. We use an ensemble of climate model simulations to investigate what impact the large uncertainty in how aerosols interact with climate has on predicting future tropical rainfall shifts.\n\nSource attribution of cloud condensation nuclei and their impact on stratocumulus clouds and radiation in the south-eastern Atlantic\n\nHaochi Che, Philip Stier, Duncan Watson-Parris, Hamish Gordon, and Lucia Deaconu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 10789–10807, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10789-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10789-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtensive stratocumulus clouds over the south-eastern Atlantic (SEA) can lead to a cooling effect on the climate. A key pathway by which aerosols affect cloud properties is by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Here, we investigated the source attribution of CCN in the SEA as well as the cloud responses. Our results show that aerosol nucleation contributes most to CCN in the marine boundary layer. In terms of emissions, anthropogenic sources contribute most to the CCN and cloud droplets.\n\nImportant role of stratospheric injection height for the distribution and radiative forcing of smoke aerosol from the 2019â2020 Australian wildfires\n\nBernd Heinold, Holger Baars, Boris Barja, Matthew Christensen, Anne Kubin, Kevin Ohneiser, Kerstin Schepanski, Nick Schutgens, Fabian Senf, Roland SchrÃ¶dner, Diego Villanueva, and Ina Tegen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 9969–9985, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9969-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9969-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe extreme 2019–2020 Australian wildfires produced massive smoke plumes lofted into the lower stratosphere by pyrocumulonimbus convection. Most climate models do not adequately simulate the injection height of such intense fires. By combining aerosol-climate modeling with prescribed pyroconvective smoke injection and lidar observations, this study shows the importance of the representation of the most extreme wildfire events for estimating the atmospheric energy budget.\n\nThe ice-nucleating activity of African mineral dust in the Caribbean boundary layer\n\nAlexander D.

In this paper we show that African desert dust that has travelled across the Atlantic to the Caribbean nucleates ice much less well than we might have expected.\n\nA quadcopter unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based methodology for measuring biomass burning emission factors\n\nRoland Vernooij, Patrik Winiger, Martin Wooster, Tercia Strydom, Laurent Poulain, Ulrike Dusek, Mark Grosvenor, Gareth J. Roberts, Nick Schutgens, and Guido R. van der Werf\n\nAtmos. Meas.

Previous studies have indicated savanna emission factors to be highly variable. Improving fire emission estimates, and understanding future climate- and human-induced changes in fire regimes, requires in situ measurements. We present a drone-based method that enables the collection of a large amount of high-quality emission factor measurements that do not have the biases of aircraft or surface measurements.\n\nBiomass burning and marine aerosol processing over the southeast Atlantic Ocean: a TEM single-particle analysis\n\nCaroline Dang, Michal Segal-Rozenhaimer, Haochi Che, Lu Zhang, Paola Formenti, Jonathan Taylor, Amie Dobracki, Sara Purdue, Pui-Shan Wong, Athanasios Nenes, Arthur Sedlacek III, Hugh Coe, Jens Redemann, Paquita Zuidema, Steven Howell, and James Haywood\n\nAtmos.

We found that the volatility of organic aerosol increases with biomass burning plume age, that black carbon is often mixed with potassium salts and that the marine atmosphere can incorporate Na and Cl into smoke particles. Marine salts are more processed when mixed with smoke plumes, and there are interesting Cl-rich yet Na-absent marine particles.\n\nThe MONARCH high-resolution reanalysis of desert dust aerosol over Northern Africa, the Middle East and Europe (2007â2016)\n\nEnza Di Tomaso, JerÃ³nimo Escribano, Sara Basart, Paul Ginoux, Francesca Macchia, Francesca Barnaba, Francesco Benincasa, Pierre-Antoine BretonniÃ¨re, Arnau BuÃ±uel, Miguel Castrillo, Emilio Cuevas, Paola Formenti, MarÃ­a GonÃ§alves, Oriol Jorba, Martina Klose, Lucia Mona, Gilbert MontanÃ© Pinto, Michail Mytilinaios, Vincenzo Obiso, Miriam Olid, Nick Schutgens, Athanasios Votsis, Ernest Werner, and Carlos PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a-Pando\n\nEarth Syst.

This work provides evidence of the high accuracy of this data set and its suitability for air quality and health and climate service applications.\n\nEvolution of source attributed organic aerosols and gases in a megacity of central China\n\nSiyuan Li, Dantong Liu, Shaofei Kong, Yangzhou Wu, Kang Hu, Huang Zheng, Yi Cheng, Shurui Zheng, Xiaotong Jiang, Shuo Ding, Dawei Hu, Quan Liu, Ping Tian, Delong Zhao, and Jiujiang Sheng\n\nAtmos.

By concurrently measuring detailed mass spectra of aerosol and gas phases in a megacity online, we identified the primary and secondary source sectors and investigated the transformation between gas and aerosol phases influenced by photooxidation and moisture. The results will help us to understand the respective evolution of major sources in a typical urban environment.\n\nModel evaluation of short-lived climate forcers for the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme: a multi-species, multi-model study\n\nCynthia H.

Atmospheric models are often used to provide information to policy makers about current and future conditions under different emissions scenarios. In order to have confidence in those simulations, in this study we compare simulated air pollution from 18 state-of-the-art atmospheric models to measured air pollution in order to assess how well the models perform.\n\nEstimating aerosol emission from SPEXone on the NASA PACE mission using an ensemble Kalman smoother: observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs)\n\nAthanasios Tsikerdekis, Nick A. J. Schutgens, Guangliang Fu, and Otto P. Hasekamp\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 3253–3279, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3253-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3253-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn our study we quantify the ability of the future satellite sensor SPEXone, part of the NASA PACE mission, to estimate aerosol emissions. The sensor will be able to retrieve accurate information of aerosol light extinction and most importantly light absorption. We simulate SPEXone spatial coverage and combine it with an aerosol model. We found that SPEXone will be able to estimate species-specific (e.g. dust, sea salt, organic or black carbon, sulfates) aerosol emissions very accurately.\n\nAerodynamic size-resolved composition and cloud condensation nuclei properties of aerosols in a Beijing suburban region\n\nChenjie Yu, Dantong Liu, Kang Hu, Ping Tian, Yangzhou Wu, Delong Zhao, Huihui Wu, Dawei Hu, Wenbo Guo, Qiang Li, Mengyu Huang, Deping Ding, and James D. Allan\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 4375–4391, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-4375-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-4375-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we applied a new technique to investigate the aerosol properties on both a mass and number basis and CCN abilities in Beijing suburban regions. The size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions and CCN activation measurement enable a detailed analysis of BC-containing particle hygroscopicity and its size-dependent contribution to the CCN activation. The results presented in this study will affect future models and human health studies.\n\nThe effect of BC on aerosolâboundary layer feedback: potential implications for urban pollution episodes\n\nJessica Slater, Hugh Coe, Gordon McFiggans, Juha Tonttila, and Sami Romakkaniemi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2937–2953, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2937-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2937-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper shows the specific impact of black carbon (BC) on the aerosol–planetary boundary layer (PBL) feedback and its influence on a Beijing haze episode. Overall, this paper shows that strong temperature inversions prevent BC heating within the PBL from significantly increasing PBL height, while BC above the PBL suppresses PBL development significantly through the day. From this we suggest a method by which both locally and regionally emitted BC may impact urban pollution episodes.\n\nOpportunistic experiments to constrain aerosol effective radiative forcing\n\nMatthew W.

Examples include volcanoes, industrial chimneys, forest fires, and ship stacks. These sources provide opportunistic experiments with which to quantify the role of aerosols in modifying cloud properties. We review the current state of understanding on the influence of aerosol on climate built from the wide range of natural and anthropogenic laboratories investigated in recent decades.\n\nModel calibration using ESEm v1.1.0 â an open, scalable Earth system emulator\n\nDuncan Watson-Parris, Andrew Williams, Lucia Deaconu, and Philip Stier\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7659–7672, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7659-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7659-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Earth System Emulator (ESEm) provides a fast and flexible framework for emulating a wide variety of Earth science datasets and tools for constraining (or tuning) models of any complexity. Three distinct use cases are presented that demonstrate the utility of ESEm and provide some insight into the use of machine learning for emulation in these different settings. The open-source Python package is freely available so that it might become a valuable tool for the community.\n\nModel emulation to understand the joint effects of ice-nucleating particles and secondary ice production on deep convective anvil cirrus\n\nRachel E. Hawker, Annette K. Miltenberger, Jill S. Johnson, Jonathan M. Wilkinson, Adrian A. Hill, Ben J. Shipway, Paul R. Field, Benjamin J. Murray, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 17315–17343, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17315-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17315-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe find that ice-nucleating particles (INPs), aerosols that can initiate the freezing of cloud droplets, cause substantial changes to the properties of radiatively important convectively generated anvil cirrus. The number concentration of INPs had a large effect on ice crystal number concentration while the INP temperature dependence controlled ice crystal size and cloud fraction. The results indicate information on INP number and source is necessary for the representation of cloud glaciation.\n\nPhysical and chemical properties of black carbon and organic matter from different combustion and photochemical sources using aerodynamic aerosol classification\n\nDawei Hu, M. Rami Alfarra, Kate Szpek, Justin M. Langridge, Michael I. Cotterell, Claire Belcher, Ian Rule, Zixia Liu, Chenjie Yu, Yunqi Shao, Aristeidis Voliotis, Mao Du, Brett Smith, Greg Smallwood, Prem Lobo, Dantong Liu, Jim M. Haywood, Hugh Coe, and James D. Allan\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 16161–16182, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16161-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16161-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we developed new techniques for investigating these properties in the laboratory and applied these to BC and BrC from different sources, including diesel exhaust, inverted propane flame and wood combustion. These have allowed us to quantify the changes in shape and chemical composition of different soots according to source and variables such as the moisture content of wood.\n\nAerosol absorption in global models from AeroCom phase III\n\nMaria Sand, BjÃ¸rn H.

Tsyro, and Duncan Watson-Parris\n\nAtmos. Chem.

A total of 15 different aerosol models from AeroCom phase III have reported total aerosol absorption, and for the first time, 11 of these models have reported in a consistent experiment the contributions to absorption from black carbon, dust, and organic aerosol. Here, we document the model diversity in aerosol absorption.\n\nControls on surface aerosol particle number concentrations and aerosol-limited cloud regimes over the central Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nHeather Guy, Ian M. Brooks, Ken S. Carslaw, Benjamin J. Murray, Von P. Walden, Matthew D. Shupe, Claire Pettersen, David D. Turner, Christopher J. Cox, William D. Neff, Ralf Bennartz, and Ryan R. Neely III\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 15351–15374, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15351-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15351-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the first full year of surface aerosol number concentration measurements from the central Greenland Ice Sheet. Aerosol concentrations here have a distinct seasonal cycle from those at lower-altitude Arctic sites, which is driven by large-scale atmospheric circulation. Our results can be used to help understand the role aerosols might play in Greenland surface melt through the modification of cloud properties. This is crucial in a rapidly changing region where observations are sparse.\n\nReduced volatility of aerosols from surface emissions to the top of the planetary boundary layer\n\nQuan Liu, Dantong Liu, Yangzhou Wu, Kai Bi, Wenkang Gao, Ping Tian, Delong Zhao, Siyuan Li, Chenjie Yu, Guiqian Tang, Yunfei Wu, Kang Hu, Shuo Ding, Qian Gao, Fei Wang, Shaofei Kong, Hui He, Mengyu Huang, and Deping Ding\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 14749–14760, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14749-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14749-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThrough simultaneous online measurements of detailed aerosol compositions at both surface and surface-influenced mountain sites, the evolution of aerosol composition during daytime vertical transport was investigated. The results show that, from surface to the top of the planetary boundary layer, the oxidation state of organic aerosol had been significantly enhanced due to evaporation and further oxidation of these evaporated gases.\n\nThe driving factors of new particle formation and growth in the polluted boundary layer\n\nMao "
