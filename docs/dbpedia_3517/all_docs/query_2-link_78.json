        "text": "Just in time for the Halloween season, the Whitefish Theatre Company is delighted to present the musical thriller “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street” at the O’Shaughnessy Center in Whitefish. This infamous, award-winning show opens with a sneak preview night on Oct. 20 at 7:30 p.m. Performances continue on Oct. 21, 22, 27, 28, 29 and 30 at 7:30 p.m. and on Oct. 23 at 4 p.m. Please note that this musical may not be appropriate for all ages as it contains theatrical depictions of violence and death.\n\n“Sweeney Todd” has captivated audiences around the world with its murderous melodies and a haunting tale of love, revenge and hilarious mayhem. Considered to be one of the greatest scores in Broadway history, this eight-time Tony Award-winning musical with lyrics and score by Stephen Sondheim and book by Hugh Wheeler, tells the story of masterful barber Sweeney Todd as he returns to London to take his revenge against the corrupt judge who destroyed his life. In his vigilante quest, he meets the cheerfully amoral pie shop owner Mrs. Lovett, who soon becomes an accomplice in his deadly schemes. Together, they sing their way through murder and mischief to the top of the food chain in this morbidly funny musical that promises to be a tasty and theatrical treat.\n\n“This show has everything: love, revenge, intrigue, and surprisingly, a great deal of humor,” says Director Kim Krueger. “However, you can’t pull off this kind of volatile, satirical story without a keen understanding of human nature and delicate chemistry. Sondheim, in this masterpiece, has not only tackled the human preoccupations of obsession and personal vendettas, but societal issues of power and class as well, all with dark humor, wit, and one of the most stunning scores ever written.”\n\nBased on 18th-century tales from the “penny dreadfuls” of serial Victorian fiction, the character of Sweeney Todd has captured the imaginations of both playwrights and moviemakers for decades. Early versions of a Sweeney Todd play surfaced in the 1800s and there were two British films about the character in 1926 and 1936. The musical “Sweeney Todd” opened on Broadway in 1979 and in the West End in 1980, winning a Tony Award for Best Musical and an Olivier Award for Best New Musical. In 2007, Tim Burton released a highly acclaimed movie adaptation of Sondheim’s play starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. The cast is comprised of 28 actors from around the Flathead Valley. Rob Koelzer plays Sweeney Todd, Amy Spicer plays Mrs. Lovett, Mikey Winn plays Anthony Hope, Angie Green plays Johanna, Grayson Wood plays Tobias Ragg, David Reese plays Judge Turpin, Connor Donahue plays the Beadle, Amy Beth Chisholm plays the Beggar Woman, Tristen Ray Hollist plays Adolfo Pirelli, and Christoper DeJohn plays Jonas Fogg. Other ensemble characters include Laura Jane Abernathy, Becky Rygg, Sophie Sieh, Joy James, Hunter Cripe, Jill Dieser, Lisa Calaway, Collette Strean, Valeri McGarvey, Marnie Klein, Joel Welle, Alden Lamson, Lily Strong, Cole Pickert, Adam Robinson, Kate Keith, Tucker Connell, and Courtney Coburn.\n\n“This cast is amazing — some of the finest voices and actors in the valley are in this show,” Krueger said.\n\nKarla West is the Music Director of this production, performing live with musicians Natilee Radosevich, Dinah Weimer, and Sarina Hart. Also contributing to the design of “Sweeney Todd” are Robbie Moody, Set, Lighting and Sound Designer, Scott Plotkin, Stage Manager, and Sandra Stratton, Assistant Stage Manager. The exceptionally detailed costumes are designed by Sarah Bell and her talented cast of dedicated seamstresses who’ve worked tirelessly to make nearly 70 costumes for the show.\n\nTickets are $25 for adults, $23 for seniors and $10 for students with reserved seating. Tickets for the sneak preview performance on Oct. 20 are sold only at the door and are $12 for adults and $10 for students. Tickets can be purchased online at whitefishtheatreco.org, at the WTC Box Office at 1 Central Avenue in Whitefish, or by calling (406) 862-5371. Box office hours are from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday and one hour before performance times.\n\nThe show is sponsored by Judy and John Melin, Big Sky Compounding & IV Care, and Schellinger Construction."
