After a corrupt judge becomes infatuated with Lucy, the judge has Barker imprisoned for a crime he did not commit and takes custody of Lucy and Johanna. Fifteen years later, Barker returns to London after being freed so he can take his revenge. Barker, now going by the name Sweeney Todd, starts a partnership with Mrs. Lovett, who tells him that Lucy is dead but Johanna is still living with the judge. Barker and Mrs. Lovett start a barber shop where crimes are committed against those who wronged Barker."
