        "text": "Production Research\n\nThere have been many different productions and adaptations of Sweeney Todd, the demon barber who owned a barber shop on 186 Fleet Street London. The character made his firs debut in the story of ‘The String of Pearls’ published in 1846-7 where he murdered clients by dropping them from a trap door and slitting their throats if they survived. He then supplied the bodies to the partnering Pie Shop. In this version of the story, Tobias (or Toby in Tim Burton’s 2007 production) is an assistant but eventually ends up in the madhouse. Johanna is not Todd’s daughter, she is the lover of a boy named Mark who is imprisoned by Todd to work as a cook. Johanna dresses up as a boy and begins to work for Todd which eventually leads to the exposure of Todd’s secret and results in Todd’s death by hanging. The String of Pearls was published in parts over 18 weeks, presumed to of been written by James Malcom Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest for ‘The People’s Periodical and Family Library’.\n\nThere are clear similarities with this story and Tim Burton’s adaptation but it could also be seen as a completely different plot.\n\nI have taken the following list of all the different adaptations and productions of Sweeney Todd from Wikipedia:\n\nIn dance\n\nSweeney Todd (1959), a ballet version performed by the Royal Ballet with music by Malcolm Arnold. The choreography was directed by John Cranko.\n\nIn film\n\nSweeney Todd (1926), the first silent film version of the story, starring G.A. Baughan in the title role. The film is now lost.\n\nSweeney Todd (1928) a silent film starring Moore Marri0tt as Sweeney Todd and Iris Darbyshire as Mrs. Lovett. This is the first surviving film adaptation.\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1936), a film version of the Victorian melodrama starring Tod Slaughter as Sweeney Todd and Stella Rho as Mrs. “Lovett”.\n\nBloodthirsty Butchers (1970), a horror film with John Miranda as Sweeney Todd and Jane Helay as Maggie Lovett, directed by Andy Milligan.\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street in Concert (2001), a filmed concert version of Sondheim’s musical, starring George Hearn as Sweeney Todd/Benjamin Barker, Patti LuPone as Mrs. Lovett, Timothy Nolen as Judge Turpin, and Neil Patrick Harris as Tobias.\n\nIn Jersey Girl (2004), Ollie Trinke (Ben Affleck) and his onscreen daughter sing “God, That’s Good!!” from the Sondheim version for her school play, accompanied by Liv Tyler.\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), a film directed by Tim Burton, adapted from Sondheim’s musical. It stars Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd, Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin, and Ed Sanders as Toby. The cast also includes Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli and Timothy Spall as Beadle Bamford, Turpin’s henchman. The film received two Golden Globe Awards – one for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical (Johnny Depp), and one for Best Picture, Comedy or Musical. The film was also nominated for three Academy Awards, winning for Art Direction.\n\nIn music\n\n“Sweeney Todd, The Barber”, a song which assumes its audience knows the stage version and claims that such a character existed in real life. Stanley Holloway, who recorded it in 1956, attributed it to R. P. Weston, a songwriter active from 1906 to 1934.\n\nIn radio and audio plays\n\n“The Strange Case of the Demon Barber” (8 January 1946), an adaptation of the Sweeney Todd story featured in an episode of the radio drama The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. In this interpretation, an actor playing the character on stage begins to believe he is committing similar murders while sleepwalking, while Holmes and Watson uncover something different that may prove his sanity.\n\nIn 1947, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s CBC Stage Series broadcast a radio adaptation of the Pitt play starring Mavor Moore as Todd, Jane Mallett as Mrs. Lovett, John Drainie as Tobias, Lloyd Bochner as Mark Ingesterie and Arden Kaye as Johanna Oakley. The production was adapted by Ronald Hamilton and directed by Andrew Allan, with original music composed by Lucio Agostini.\n\nThe second episode of the BBC Radio comedy series 1835, entitled “Haircut, Sir?” (broadcast in 2004) and written by Jim Poyser, had aimless aristocrat Viscount Belport (Paul Rider) and his servant Ned (Jason Done) joining the police force under Sir Robert Peel and encountering demon barber Sweeney Todd (Jonathan Keeble) on their first case.\n\nSweeney Todd and the String of Pearls: An Audio Melodrama in Three Despicable Acts (2007), an audio play by Yuri Rasovsky, won three 2008 Audie Awards for best audio drama, best original work, and achievement in production\n\nIn stage productions\n\nThe String of Pearls (1847), a melodrama by George Dibden Pitt that opened at Hoxton’s Britannia Theatre and billed as “founded on fact”. It was something of a success, and the story spread by word of mouth and took on the quality of an urban legend. Various versions of the tale were staples of the British theatre for the rest of the century.\n\nSweeney Todd, the Barber of Fleet Street: or the String of Pearls (c. 1865), a dramatic adaption written by Frederick Hazleton which premiered at the Old Bower Saloon, Stangate Street, Lambeth.\n\nSweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1973), a play by the British playwright Christopher Bond. This version of the story was the first to give Todd a more sympathetic motive: he is a wrongfully imprisoned barber who returns to London after 15 years in an Australian penal colony under the new name Sweeney Todd, only to find that the judge responsible for his imprisonment has raped his young wife and driven her to suicide, and adopted his daughter. He at first plans to kill the judge, but when his prey escapes, he swears revenge on the whole world and begins to slash his customers’ throats. The character’s new, tragic backstory was Bond’s way of grafting dramatic themes from The Revenger’s Tragedy onto Pitt’s stage plot.\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. A Musical Thriller (1979), the acclaimed musical adaptation of Bond’s play by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler starring Len Cariou as Sweeney Todd (here christened Benjamin Barker) and Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett. George Hearn and Dorothy Loudon later succeeded Cariou and Lansbury in the lead roles. In 1982, the musical was televised on The Entertainment Channel, starring Hearn and Lansbury, and directed by Terry Hughes and Harold Prince. It was produced by RKO Pictures and RKO/Nederlander Productions.\n\nSweeney Todd Musical, a 2009 musical rendition by the Repertory Philippines group, starring Audie Gemora in the title role and Menchu Lauchengco-Yulo as Mrs. Lovett. Gerard Salonga of Filharmonika conducted the orchestra. It was directed by Baby Barredo and Michael Williams.\n\nThe Sweeney Todd Shock’n’Roll Show, a musical by Peter Miller and Randall Lewton written to be performed by young people. The show is available from Samuel French, Ltd.\n\nA Broadway revival of the Sondheim musical, directed by John Doyle, was mounted at the Eugene O’Neill Theatre in 2005. The ten-person cast, who played their own instruments in new orchestrations, consisted of John Arbo (Jonas Fogg; bass player), Donna Lynne Champlin (Pirelli; piano, accordion, flute), Alexander Gemignani (The Beadle; piano, trumpet), Mark Jacoby (Judge Turpin; trumpet, percussion), Diana DiMarzio (Beggar Woman/Lucy Barker; clarinet), Benjamin Magnuson (Anthony Hope; cello, piano), Lauren Molina (Johanna Barker; cello), Manoel Felciano (Tobias; violin, clarinet, piano), Patti LuPone (Mrs. Lovett; tuba, percussion), and Michael Cerveris (Sweeney Todd; guitar). Cerveris, LuPone, and Felciano were all nominated for Tony Awards; the show itself was nominated for Best Revival and won Tonys for Best Direction and Best Orchestration.\n\nOn television\n\n“Sweeney Todd” (1970), an episode of the ITV series Mystery and Imagination starring Freddie Jones as Sweeney Todd and Heather Canning as Nellie Lovett. In this adaptation, written by Vincent Tilsey and directed by Reginald Collin, the title character is portrayed as insane rather than evil. Lewis Fiander played Mark Ingesterie with Mel Martin as the heroine Charlotte and Len Jones as Tobias.\n\nSweeney Todd (1973), an hour-long TV production by the CBC Television series The Purple Playhouse with Barry Morse as Todd. This was again Pitt’s version of the play.\n\nThe Tale of Sweeney Todd (1998), a television movie directed by John Schlesinger, commissioned by British Sky Broadcasting for which Ben Kingsley received a Screen Actors Guild Best Actor nomination for his portrayal of the title role. Joanna Lumley portrayed Mrs. Lovett.\n\nSweeney Todd (2006), a BBC television drama version with a screenplay written by Joshua St Johnston and starring Ray Winstone in the title role and Essie Davis as Mrs Lovett.\n\nReferences\n\nWikipedia.
