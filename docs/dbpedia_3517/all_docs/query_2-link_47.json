English film &amp; stage actor best known for playing over the top maniacs in macabre film adaptations of Victorian melodramas.&nbsp;In 1925, he adopted the stage name of Tod Slaughter and appeared in many major theatre&nbsp;productions often in leading&nbsp;heroic roles. He finally found his true calling in 1931 at the New Theatre London&nbsp;playing Long John Silver in Treasure Island&nbsp;(during the day) and then body snatcher William Hare in The Crimes of Burke and Hare (at night).&nbsp;Publicised as &quot;Mr Murder&quot;, he lapped up his new-found notoriety by boasting he committed &quot;15 murders each day&quot; for the duration of the run. Shortly afterwards, he played &quot;Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; for the first of 2,000 times on stage. Actor and role had finally found each other (much in the same way as Bela Lugosi as Dracula)&nbsp;and&nbsp;the seal was set on Slaughter&#39;s subsequent career.&nbsp;In 1934 (aged 49), he began in films, usually cast as a villain. His first film was Maria Marten (1935), a Victorian melodrama filmed cheaply with Slaughter as the obvious evil-doer.&nbsp;His next and defining&nbsp;film role was as Sweeney Todd in the classic &quot;Demon Barber of&nbsp;Fleet Street&quot; (1936),&nbsp;directed and produced by George King&nbsp;whose partnership with Slaughter was continued in&nbsp;subsequent shockers : The Crimes of Stephen Hawke (1936) / It&#39;s Never Too Late to Mend (1937) / The Ticket of Leave&nbsp;Man (1938) / The Face at The Window (1939) and Crimes at The Dark House (1940).&nbsp;He was busy on stage during WW2 in Jack the Ripper / Landru and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.&nbsp;After the war,&nbsp;he resumed his melodramatic roles and starred in&nbsp;The Curse of the Wraydrons (1946)&nbsp;in which Bruce Seton&nbsp;played the legendary Victorian bogeyman Spring-Heeled Jack. During the early 1950s,&nbsp;he appeared as the villain in two crime films King of The Underworld (1952) and Murder at Scotland Yard (1953)&nbsp;and&nbsp;still regularly toured the provinces and London suburbs. However, times had changed and&nbsp;the public&#39;s appetite for melodrama seemed to have abated&nbsp;and he went bankrupt in 1953 owing to a downturn in his touring income.&nbsp;He continued to perform&nbsp;on the stage almost to the very end.
