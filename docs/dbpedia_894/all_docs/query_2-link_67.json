Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies\n\nHow We Use Cookies\n\nLike many other companies, we use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as pixels and web beacons) (collectively, “Cookies”). “Cookies” are small files of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer hard drive, mobile or other devices (e.g., smartphones or tablets).\n\nWe use Cookies to:\n\n- Estimate audience size and usage patterns;\n\n- Understand and save your preferences for future visits, allowing us to customize the Site and Services to your individual needs;\n\n- Advertise new content and services that relate to your interests;\n\n- Keep track of advertisements and search engine results;\n\n- Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions to resolve issues and offer better site experiences and tools in the future; and\n\n- Recognize when you return to the Site.\n\nWe set some Cookies ourselves and others are set by other entities. We use Cookies set by other entities to provide us with useful information to help us improve our Site and Services, to conduct advertising, and to analyze the effectiveness of advertising. For example, we use Cookies from Google and other similar companies.\n\nHow You Can Opt-Out of Cookies\n\nWhen you first visit our Site, you will be presented with a banner which offers you choices about whether to accept or reject cookies or tracking technologies of different types.\n\nBrowser Settings\n\nCookies can be blocked by changing your Internet browser settings to refuse all or some Cookies. If you choose to block all Cookies (including essential Cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of the Site.\n\nYou can find out more about Cookies and how to manage them by visiting www.AboutCookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org.\n\nPlatform Controls\n\nYou can opt out of Cookies set by specific entities by following the instructions found at these links: Google: https://adssettings.google.com.\n\nAdvertising Industry Resources\n\nYou can understand which entities have currently enabled Cookies for your browser or mobile device and how to opt-out of some of those Cookies by accessing the Network Advertising Initiative’s website or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website. For more information on mobile specific opt-out choices, visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Mobile Choices website.\n\nPlease note that these opt-out mechanisms are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised. Therefore, you will need to opt out on every browser and device that you use.\n\nGoogle Analytics\n\nWe use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses Cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with the Site and Services, compile reports on their activity, and provide other services related to their activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a returning visitor, and any referring website. The technologies used by Google Analytics do not gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies.\n\nGoogle reCAPTCHA\n\nWe use Google reCAPTCHA, a free service provided by Google, Inc., to protect our Site from spam and abuse. Google reCAPTCHA uses advanced risk analysis techniques to decipher humans and bots. Google reCAPTCHA works differently depending on what version is deployed. For example, you may be asked to check a box indicating that you are not a robot or Google reCAPTCHA may detect abusive traffic without user interaction. Google reCAPTCHA works by transmitting certain types of information to Google, such as the referrer URL, IP address, visitor behavior, operating system information, browser and length of the visit, cookies, and mouse movements. Your use of Google reCAPTCHA is subject to Google’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nHotjar\n\nWe use Hotjar in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g., how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and do not like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device’s IP address (processing during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our Site. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.\n\nSmart Look\n\nWe use Smart Look in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Smart Look is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g., how much time they spend on mobile app screens, which links they choose to click, what users do and do not like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Smart Look uses technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices under Event Vesta Inc.’s direction and covered by our privacy policy. Smart Look only processes your data to provide our services to us. To make sure your data is adequately protected, Event Vesta Inc. and Smart Look enter into a Data Processing Agreement. If you don’t want to be recorded by Smart Look, you can opt-out. Please note that if you clear your cookies or use a different browser, you will need to opt-out again. Similarly, you have to contact the website provider if you want to exercise your rights with respect to your personal data.\n\n3. Third Party Processors\n\nTo ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information receives an adequate level of protection, we have put in place appropriate procedures with the service providers we share it with to ensure that it is treated consistent with applicable data security and privacy laws. For example, we use payment processors, marketing, data analytics, customer service, employment, development, and social media service providers.\n\n4. “Do Not Track” Signals\n\nSome internet browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that browsers communicate the “Do Not Track” signal, the Site does not currently interpret, respond to or alter its practices when it receives “Do Not Track” signals.\n\n5. Choices About Your Personally Identifiable Information\n\nReview and Request Changes to Your Personally Identifiable Information\n\nTo review or request changes to any of your Personally Identifiable Information, please contact us at info@eventvesta.com.\n\nMarketing Communications\n\nTo unsubscribe from our marketing emails, please click the unsubscribe link included in the footer of our emails. You also may submit a request to us at info@eventvesta.com.\n\n6. Security\n\nWe maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect the Personally Identifiable Information we collect and store from loss, misuse, destruction, or unauthorized access. However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.\n\n7. Third Party Links\n\nThe Site and Services may contain links that will let you leave the Site and Services and access another website. Linked websites are not under our control. This Privacy Policy applies solely to Personally Identifiable Information that is acquired by us on this Site and Services. We accept no responsibility or liability for these other websites.\n\n8. Children’s Privacy\n\nThe Site and Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under 13.\n\n9. Notice to Nevada Residents\n\nNevada law allows Nevada residents to opt-out of the sale of certain types of personal information. Subject to several exceptions, Nevada law defines “sale” to mean the exchange of certain types of personal information for monetary consideration to another person. We do not currently sell personal information as defined in the Nevada law. However, if you are a Nevada resident, you still may submit a verified request to opt-out of sales and we will record your instructions and incorporate them in the future if our policy changes. Opt-out requests may be sent to info@eventvesta.com.\n\n10. Notice to California Residents\n\nWe do not disclose personal information obtained through our Site or Services to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Accordingly, we have no obligations under California Civil Code § 1798.83.\n\n11.

Injunctive Relief\n\nYou acknowledge that we may be irreparably damaged if these Terms are not specifically enforced, and damages at law would be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provision of these Terms by you, we shall be entitled, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that may be sought under Section 22, to an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach, without being required to show any actual damage or to post an injunction bond, and/or to a decree for specific performance of the provisions of these Terms. For purposes of this Section, you agree that any action or proceeding with regard to such injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Omaha, Nebraska. You consent to the jurisdiction of such court and waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such court. You agree that service of any court paper may be effected on such party by mail or in such other manner as may be provided under applicable laws, rules of procedure or local rules.\n\n22. MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER\n\nMost concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by contacting us as set forth in the “Questions” section below.\n\nIn the event that we are not able to resolve a dispute, and with the exception of the claims for injunctive relief by us as described above and otherwise set forth herein, you hereby agree that either you or we may require any dispute, claim, or cause of action (“Claim”) between you and us or any third parties arising out of use of the Site, the Services, and any other actions with us (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory) to be arbitrated on an individual (non-class) basis. However, both parties retain the right to seek relief in a small claims court (or a state court equivalent) for a Claim within the scope of its jurisdiction so long as the small claims action does not seek to certify a class, combine the claims of multiple persons, recover damages in excess of the limit for a small claim under applicable state law or is not transferred, removed, or appealed from small claims court to any different court. Additionally, if you are a California resident, you retain the right to obtain public injunctive relief from any court with proper jurisdiction.\n\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS VERY LIMITED. ADDITIONALLY, ANY ARBITRATION OF A CLAIM WILL BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND, THEREFORE, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. AS PART OF THIS WAIVER, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO ACT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN AN ARBITRATION; THAT EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, CLAIMS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST YOU MAY NOT BE JOINED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH CLAIMS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST ANY OTHER PERSON; AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT A CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARBITRATION OR MULTIPLE-PARTY ARBITRATION.\n\nYou and we agree that your use of the Services involves interstate commerce, and that this arbitration agreement shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) set forth in Title 9 of the U.S. Code to the fullest extent possible, notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, regardless of the origin or nature of the Claims at issue. The arbitrator must follow, to the extent applicable: (1) the substantive law of the state in which we entered into the transaction giving rise to this arbitration agreement; (2) the applicable statutes of limitations; and (3) claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator will not be bound by federal, state or local rules of procedure and evidence or by state or local laws concerning arbitration proceedings.\n\nIf either you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, the dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered under the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). Either you or we may elect to resolve a particular Claim through arbitration, even if the other party has already initiated litigation in court related to the Claim, by: (a) making written demand for arbitration upon the other party, (b) initiating arbitration against the other party, or (c) filing a motion to compel arbitration in court.\n\nIf this is a consumer-purpose transaction, the applicable rules will be the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. The applicable AAA rules and other information about arbitrating a claim under AAA, including how to submit a dispute to arbitration, may be obtained by visiting its website at https://www.adr.org/ or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If AAA will not serve as the administrator of the arbitration, and you and we cannot then agree upon a substitute arbitrator, you and we shall request that a court with proper jurisdiction appoint an arbitrator. However, we will abide by the applicable AAA rules regardless of the forum. Arbitration shall be conducted in the county and state where you accepted these Terms, you reside, or another reasonably convenient place to you as determined by the arbitrator, unless applicable laws require another location. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Except as provided in applicable statutes, the arbitrator’s award is not subject to review by the court and it cannot be appealed. The parties will have the option to request and receive a statement of reasons for the arbitration award.\n\nIf you elect to file the arbitration, and this is a consumer-purpose transaction, you will pay the filing fee to the extent required by AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules but not to exceed the cost of filing a lawsuit. Any amount above what it would cost you to file a lawsuit, we will pay. All other arbitration fees and expenses shall be allocated to us according to AAA rules. Except for the arbitration fees and expenses, each party shall pay its own costs and fees incurred (including attorneys’ fees), unless the arbitrator allocates them differently in accordance with applicable law. This paragraph applies only if this is a consumer-purpose transaction.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, and except as otherwise set forth in this paragraph, the agreement to arbitration may be amended by us only upon advance notice to you. If we make any amendment to this agreement to arbitration (other than renumbering the agreement to align with any other amendment to the Terms) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding or action against us prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other Claims governed by this agreement to arbitration that have arisen or may arise between you and us. However, we may amend this agreement to arbitration and not provide you notice; in that case, the amendments will not apply to you and the agreement to arbitration contained in these Terms to which you agreed will continue to apply to you and us as if no amendments were made.\n\nIf any part of this arbitration provision is invalid, all other parts of it remain valid. However, if the class action limitation is invalid, then this arbitration provision is invalid in its entirety, provided that the remaining Terms shall remain in full force and effect. This arbitration provision will survive the termination of your use of the Site, the Services, and any other actions with us.\n\nYou may reject this arbitration provision within thirty (30) days of accepting the Terms by emailing us at info@eventvesta.com and including in the subject line “Rejection of Arbitration Provision.”\n\n23. Miscellaneous Provisions\n\nSeverability. If any term or provision in these Terms is found to be void, against public policy, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction and such finding or order becomes final with all appeals exhausted, then the offending provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If the offending provision cannot be so modified, then the same shall be deemed stricken from these Terms in its entirety and the remainder of these Terms shall survive with the said offending provision eliminated.\n\nGoverning Law and Venue. These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. Except as set forth in the agreement to arbitration and without waiving it, you agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms (including but not limited to if you opt out of the agreement to arbitration) shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts of Omaha, Nebraska, except where the jurisdiction and venue are mandated by applicable assignment.\n\nAssignment. We may freely assign our obligations and rights under these Terms, including all personal information in our possession that we have collected during your use of the Site as further described in our Privacy Policy.\n\nNo Waiver. ​No failure, omission or delay on the part of Event Vesta in exercising any right under these Terms will preclude any other further exercise of that right or other right under these Terms.\n\nHeadings. Provision and section headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of these Terms.\n\nTypographical Errors. Information on the Site may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. We attempt to make the Site’s postings as accurate as possible, but we do not warrant the content of the Site is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.\n\n24.
