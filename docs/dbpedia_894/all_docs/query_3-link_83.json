        "text": "FolkWorld #76 11/2021\n\nUncle Mick's Christmas Album\n\nThis Christmas album was recorded in the 95-degree heat of a Memphis summer, we thought it would be cool. The album is 100% Memphis, every musician, engineer, technician, and guest call Memphis home. Once again Mick Kolassa teamed up with Jeff Jensen to produce a fun-filled and unique album. Combining some originals with Christmas classics the band put a Memphis spin on everything. Trust us, this ainât your daddyâs jingle bells!\n\nThe album opens with Mickâs take on Mariah Careyâs âAll I Want for Christmas is Youâ. It is delivered in a very Memphis bluesified fashion. Then the band took âFrosty the Snowmanâ right down Beale Street in a Second Line kind of way. Mickâs original âThe Best Christmas Everâ is a fun and funky love song about a very special Christmas present.\n\nThe blues classic âMerry Christmas Babyâ is followed by a VERY different take on the previously unbluesy âJingle Bellsâ â the band brought this song to Memphis in a big way! âWinter Wonderlandâ, which provides some lightness to the mix, is followed by âHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmasâ, delivered with an R&B feeling and featuring Rick Steff on multiple key instruments â including a Mellotron.\n\nMickâs blues rocker âChristmas Morning Bluesâ is a story of a Christmas that fell victim to a classic blues problem. The album closes with the bandâs âBeale Street Christmas Jamâ, in which the musicians each take a shot at fitting a classic Christmas song into a 12-bar 1-4-5 shuffle. All in all, we hope this album is as much fun to listen to as it was to produce!\n\nMick Kolassa\n\nIâm Mick Kolassa, a lifelong musician and hardcore blues fan who, in addition to being an active blues artist, also am head of Endless Blues Records and a former member of the Board of Directors of the Blues Foundation. I live in Memphis but was born in Michigan and lived in Mississippi for nearly 30 years, where I was given the nickname âMichissippi Mickâ.\n\nMy love of the blues began when I was a teenager and with my music I share that love with the world. Rather than staying within a single genre of blues, I love and celebrate all styles of blues, so I call my style âFree Range Bluesâ. Whether it is a Delta Blues song from the 1930s, Piedmont Blues, Chicago Blues, Memphis style Soul Blues, slick city blues or cool country blues, I love and play them all. I also love to find the blues hidden in songs of other genres, âbluesifyingâ songs and doing what I call âuncoversâ.\n\nI have played my blues in solo and duo acoustic formats and with bands at clubs, theaters and festivals throughout the US and Europe.\n\nThe Blues Foundation\n\nThe Blues Foundation is Memphis-based, but world-renown as THE organization dedicated to preserving our blues music history, celebrating recording and performance excellence, supporting blues education and ensuring the future of this uniquely American art form. The Blues Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization that works to support the blues and the blues community in many ways. The Foundation holds several regular events to celebrate the blues and recognize excellence in blues through the Blues Music Awards, the International Blues Challenge, Keeping the Blues Alive Awards and the annual induction of individuals and their works into the Blues Hall of Fame. The Blues Foundation also provides or sponsors programs on blues education, including Blues in the Schools and Generation Blues, and in health care for blues artists through Sound Healthcare and the HART Fund. MORE INFO ->\n\nAll Proceeds from my albums will go to support two of these important programs: The HART Fund and Generation Blues. THE HART FUND (Handy Artists Relief Trust) is for Blues musicians and their families in financial need due to a broad range of health concerns. The Fund provides for acute, chronic and preventive medical and dental care as well as funeral and burial expenses. GENERATION BLUES provides scholarship to artists under the age of 21 to study at reputable camps, seminars and workshop programs such as Port Townsend Acoustic Blues Festival, Augusta Heritage Center and Fernando Jonesâ Columbia College Blues Camp.\n\nFrank Roszak Promotions\n\nFrank Roszak, former Director of Radio, Promotion, & Press for Delta and Eclecto Groove Records is available for hire for independent radio and press promotion.
