Guitarist John Primer’s robust vocals are steeped in classic Chicago sounds energized in particular by harmonica ace Bob Corritore’s fiery play and Anthony Geraci’s distinctively propulsive piano. Drawing from vintage fare including B.B. King’s “Chains And Things”, Muddy Waters’ “Stuff You Gotta Watch” and the John Lee Hooker-penned title track, this should rate as one of this year’s better offerings.\n\n– Duane Verh\n\nWTJU (March 12, 2024)\n\nBob Corritore was born in Chicago and got hooked on blues Harmonica when he was twelve years old. He studied and received playing tips from Carey Bell, Big Walter Horton, Junior Wells and others. At the age of twenty-five Corritore moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Ten years later he opened his own club there called The Rhythm Room. With his house band The Rhythm Room All-Stars, he backed musicians when they came to town. Since 2017 Corritore has been nominated for at least half a dozen Blues Music Awards. He won his first BMA in 2011 for Historical Album of The Year. This is Corritore’s 18 album although he appears on over seventy-five others. Alfonso “John” Primer was born in Camden, Mississippi but moved to Chicago where he was a regular at Teresa’s Lounge located at 48th and South Indiana Avenue.

Primer was nominated multiple times for Traditional Blues Male Artist of The Year first winning it in 2016. Primer was also the lead vocalist, guitarist and featured artist on the Grammy nominated “Muddy Waters 100” project. This is Primer’s nineteenth album. This album is the fourth collaboration for Primer and Corritore since they started working together in 2013. The band also includes Bob Stroger, bass; Jimi Primetime Smith, second guitar; Anthony Geraci, piano; and Wes Starr, drums. Primer was recently inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.” I always look forward to these CDs that Bob puts out. Super authentic, nothing modern to these tunes!! All the tunes are great, feels like buying your favorite Blues record from the 60’s, it’s hard to pick a favorite but I think my favorite on this CD is “Rosalee Blues” but I couldn’t find it on line so here is the title song “Crawlin’ Kingsnake”, listen here. I will probably give this a 10+ on Blues Content and a 10+ on Music Content.\n\nMaking A Scene (March 13, 2024)\n\nBob Corritore was born in Chicago and got hooked on blues Harmonica when he was twelve years old.

Primer werd geboren in Camden, MS en speelde in Chi Town in de befaamde bluesclub Theresa’s waar hij werd beïnvloed door Muddy Waters en Sammy Lawhorn, die hem slidegitaar leerde pelen. In 1979 vervoegde Primer, The Chicago Blues All-Stars, de band rond blueslegende Willie Dixon. Niet veel later speelde John bij de legendarische Muddy Waters en Magic Slim’s band The Teardrops. Tot hij een lucratief platencontract ondertekende bij het label Wolf Records. John Primer heeft gecontribueerd aan de concretisering van de sound en de stijl van die hedendaagse Chicago blues. De echo’s van legendarische plekken als Maxwell Street, Theresa’s, Checkerboard en Rosa’s Lounges pulseren vandaag in elk akkoord op zijn gitaar. John Primer is dan ook een levende legende van de Chicago blues. Radiopresentator, talentscout en vooral mondharmonica-ace Bob Corritore werd geboren in Chicago op 27 September 1956. Hij schuimde er toen als tiener de bluesclubs af. Hij studeerde en kreeg speeltips van Carey Bell, Big Walter Horton, Junior Wells en heel wat andere bluesartiesten. Op vijfentwintigjarige leeftijd verhuisde Corritore naar Phoenix, Arizona. Tien jaar later opende hij daar zijn eigen club The Rhythm Room. Met zijn huisband The Rhythm Room All-Stars begeleidde hij muzikanten als ze in zijn club performden. Sinds 2017 is Corritore genomineerd voor minstens een half dozijn Blues Music Awards. Hij won zijn eerste BMA in 2011 voor Historical Album of The Year. Dit is nu Corritore’s 18de album, hoewel hij op meer dan vijfenzeventig andere langspelers voorkomt.\n\nHet duo heeft nu met de schitterende langspeler een vierde samenwerkingsproject ‘Crawlin’ Kingsnake’. Ze vonden hun soulmates in Bob Stroger op bas, Wes Starr (drums en percussie), Jimi Smith op gitaar en backing vocals en pianist Anthony Geraci. De Chicago bluesshuffle ‘Take A Message’ is gecrediteerd James Cotton, net zoals ‘Crawlin’ Kingsnake’ origineel van John Lee Hooker is, maar de vibe van Muddy Waters heeft geaccordeerd. Primer is prima bij stem in de Willie Dixons klassieker ‘Down In The Bottom’, dat een hit was in 1961 voor Howlin’ Wolf. De track ‘Hiding Place’ werd bij elkaar gepend door Primer, net zoals de slowblues ‘Chains And Things’ origineel van B.B. King is. En dan volgt een triptiek Muddy songs. ‘Stuff You Gotta Watch’ is een moddervette boogie, ‘Rosalee Blues’ een heerlijke ballade en het meesterlijke ‘Feels Like Going Home’. Na het funky ‘You’re The One’ duiken we de diepe Delta in met het gospel begeesterde ‘Bow Down On Your Knees’, trekken we naar de Windy City voor de bluesshuffle ‘This Little Voice’ en haalden ze Magic Slims ‘Gravel Road’ van onder het stof. ‘Crawlin’ Kingsnake’ is een muzikaal testament. The blues still alive!\n\n– Philip Verhaege\n\nChicago Blues Guide (March 29, 2024)\n\nThe dynamic duo of John Primer and Bob Corritore have worked some major musical magic once again! Their fourth CD release, Crawlin’ Kingsnake is a striking showcase of old-school blues from a pair of charming, long-term collaborators who remain at the top of their game.\n\nGuitarist John Primer, who turned 79 on March 5th, could easily be resting on his laurels and looking back on everything from playing behind Muddy Waters to serving as Magic Slim’s bandleader. Flash forward to 2024 and it is still Primer’s time as he continues to burnish and broaden his blues legacy. For the past few years, he’s been on a tear with accomplishments that include his 2023 induction into the Blues Hall of Fame, a Grammy nod and recently walking off with the Living Blues “Male Blues Artist of the Year.”\n\nMeanwhile, the always busy Bob Corritore released five albums in 2023, toured extensively and hosted a slew of jam sessions at his Rhythm Room in Phoenix. As witnessed by the incredible set with Corritore and several local legends at last summer’s Windy City Blues Fest, this harp player extraordinaire and all-around blues booster, knows how to bring out the best in any band he plays with.\n\nThere certainly is an “A List” of musicians doing their part to make Crawlin Kingsnake so great. In a recent interview with Steve Hoare on his Blues Lounge Radio Show, Corritore said that he chose artists who were true to the Chicago blues tradition. He added that it was very important to get a “bunch of people in the room that are great players and we all feed off of it.” Corritore also said that it is “really kind of spiritual how it all happens.”\n\nThe spirited group of bona fide blues players on Crawlin’ Kingsnake include Jimi “Primetime” Smith on second guitar and backing vocals, Bob Stroger on electric bass, Anthony Geraci on piano with Wes Starr on drums and percussion. It was produced by Corritore, Clarke Rigsby and John Wroble and recorded over four sessions from 2021 to 2023.\n\nThis group of cool cats with a rock-solid Chicago blues background, serves notice that they mean business from the get-go. On the very first track, they put their own spin on James Cotton’s “Take a Message” with Primer’s vocals straight out of the Mississippi Delta and summoning up the golden age of blues in the 312.\n\nCorritore praised Primer as being a “powerful leader” who has “such a strong stage presence.” Such is the case with the titular “Crawlin’ Kingsnake,” Corritore said, “I always loved the way John did the song with so much authority.” He added that “it’s a great song and we hear a lot of versions of it. But, in today’s world, you don’t hear anybody sing it like John Primer. He just takes charge and when you play with that power, it just elevates you to another level.”\n\nAs befits a bandleader of his stature, Primer knows when to let the other players take center stage. Throughout the course of this 12-track tour de force, all members of this brilliant blues ensemble showcase their considerable skills. Meanwhile, as Primer’s partner in keeping time, Corritore continues to amaze with his versatile harp work and keen knowledge of the Chicago blues tradition.\n\nCorritore’s love of Chicago blues goes back to seeing Muddy Waters play in his high school gym while Primer famously appeared on stage with Waters and the Rolling Stones at the old Checkerboard Lounge in 1981. As Muddy’s guitarist and bandleader from 1980 until his passing in 1983, Primer is well-versed in the old master’s music and mannerisms. That’s why it’s a special treat to hear three terrific renditions of Muddy Water’s tunes— ‘’Stuff You Gotta Watch,” “Rosalee Blues” and “Feel Like Going Home—all included on Crawlin’ Kingsnake.\n\nCrawlin’ Kingsnake also serves up some great takes on B.B. King’s “Chains and Things,” Willie Dixon’s “Down in the Bottom” and “Gravel Road” made famous by Magic Slim. As someone who played with both Dixon and Slim, Primer is uniquely qualified to bring his versions of these songs to a new generation of listeners.\n\nThe liner notes on Crawlin Kingsnake call out that “it’s true to both the sacred tradition and the moment in time of right now” and this description rings true on every track. Thanks to its skilled musicians, stellar song selection and their keen familiarity with the Chicago blues legacy, Crawlin Kingsnake is sure to strike a chord with long-time blues lovers as well as new converts to the genre. This fine effort by Primer, Corritore and company is a “must have” for any music collection and you’re hereby advised to pounce on Crawlin Kingsnake and put it on play repeatedly.\n\n– Robin Zimmerman\n\nAmerican Blues Scene (March 29, 2024)\n\nCrawlin’ Kingsnake is the fourth collaboration album for John Primer and Bob Corritore, two artists who have always had the Chicago spark. It was evident on their first release together of 2013 and on each release since.\n\nBut with this particular album, a new height has been achieved: a simultaneous, rocking forcefulness, while also exhibiting an uninhibited, gliding easiness. Crawlin’ Kingsnake also features arguably the best possible A team for Chicago blues! With Bob Stroger on the bass, Jimi Primetime Smith on second Guitar, Anthony Geraci on the piano, and Wes Starr on drums, this band sounds like the Muddy Waters band of decades ago!\n\nBoth Primer and Corritore appear at the top of their game, with Primer recently inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, as well as numerous award wins, and a Grammy nomination. Likewise, Corritore has been actively hitting the European festival circuit, released five critically acclaimed albums in 2023, was the subject of numerous articles and received numerous nominations, and a number of wins. But all of that is secondary to what happens in the studio, and what you have in your hand is a powerful straight-ahead album of sacred Chicago blues done by two artists who have devoted their entire lives to the purity of the blues.\n\nBob Corritore is one of the most active and highly regarded blues harmonica players on the scene today. His style passionately carries forward the old school of playing that Corritore learned as a young man directly from many of original pioneers of Chicago Blues. His sympathetic, yet fiery harmonica playing is featured on over 100 releases to date, on labels such as VizzTone, Delta Groove, Delmark, HighTone, HMG, Blue Witch, Blind Pig, Earwig, Ruf, Putumayo and many others. Many of Bob’s acclaimed releases have been nominated or winners for various Handy, Grammy, Living Blues, Blues Music Awards and Blues Blast Music Awards. Bob is also widely recognized for his many roles in the blues, as band leader, club owner, record producer, radio show host, arts foundation founder, and occasional writer. His website and his weekly e-newsletter reflect a life thoroughly invested in the blues.\n\nLiving legend John Primer has undisputedly helped build the sound and style of Chicago blues as we know it today. The echoes of tradition bellowing from the birthplaces he played — such as Maxwell Street, Theresa’s, Checkerboard and Rosa’s Lounges — pulse from every chord in his fingers today.\n\nIn case you missed it, the title track breathes new life into this blues classic, reaching deep into the tradition while at the same time infusing vibrant energy. No doubt a launching pad for great solos, but it’s Primer’s Mississippi-drenched vocals that simply steal the show.\n\nZicazic (France) (March 29, 2024)\n\nIls font partie l’un et l’autre des plus grands artistes de Chicago Blues en activité et leur premier enregistrement commun remonte à 2013, le guitariste et chanteur John Primer et l’harmoniciste Bob Corritore signant cette fois leur quatrième réalisation avec une formation épatante qui rappelle les plus belles heures du Muddy Waters Band, c’est dire s’ils ont mis les petits plats dans les grands. Jugez-en par vous-même, ce sont pas moins que Jimi Primetime Smith à la guitare, Anthoni Geraci au piano, Bob Stroger à la basse et Wes Starr à la batterie qui se retrouvent aux côtés des deux complices pour nous servir des trésors de blues inondés de slide, allègrement saupoudrés de piano et gorgés d’harmonicas, des pièces piochées au beau milieu des répertoires de bluesmen célèbres parmi lesquels on remarque forcément James Cotton, John Lee Hooker, Willie Dixon, B.B King, Jimmy Rogers, Magic Slim et, last but not least, Muddy Waters lui-même que le band revisite à trois reprises, complétant même l’hommage avec l’adaptation en acoustique de « Bow Down On Your Knees » que l’artiste interprétait régulièrement quand il séjournait à Clarksdale du côté de Stovall Plantation. Ajoutez-y un titre de John Primer pas piqué des vers et c’est pendant un peu moins d’une heure que l’on se sent transporté du côté du South Side de Chicago, dont les deux artistes et Bob Stroger sont originaires, pour une véritable démonstration de blues comme on les aime là-bas mais aussi un peu partout ailleurs. Enregistré aux studios Tempest en Arizona, « Crawlin’ Kingsnake » est une véritable bombe à retardement qui laisse exploser dans la platine des titres épatants comme « Take A Message », « Chains and Things », « You’re The One » et « Gravel Road », comme la pièce originale de l’effort, « Hiding Place », comme le tittle track emprunté à John Lee Hooker, et bien évidemment comme les « Stuff You Gotta Watch », « Rosalee Blues » et autres « Feel Like Going Home » qui nous rappellent à quel point Muddy Waters et son œuvre ont pu marquer l’histoire du blues. A découvrir dans les bacs le 29 mars et, pour les plus chanceux, le soir même sur la scène du Rhythm Room à Phoenix … Indispensable !\n\n– Fred Delforge\n\nLa Hora Del Blues (Spain) (April 1, 2024)\n\nValoración: BUENÍSIMO\n\nCada vez que el armonicista Bob Corritore publica un nuevo disco, los aficionados saben que están ante un auténtico álbum del mejor blues. Esta vez no podía ser diferente y Bob nos obsequia con un trabajo grabado junto al cantante y guitarrista de Chicago John Primer. No es necesario decir que el disco es un compendio del más genuino y auténtico blues de Chicago y que ambos músicos están soberbios, dando un recital del mejor y más apasionado blues que uno pueda imaginar. Ambos músicos han dedicado su vida a difundir esta música para purificar los corazones de todos aquellos que se acerquen a comulgar con el espíritu y la carne del blues.\n\nPor si esto no fuera suficiente, los músicos que les acompañan son todos ellos primeras figuras, Bob Stroger al bajo, Jimi “Primetime” Smith a la guitarra, Anthony Geraci al piano y Wes Starr a la batería, un auténtico lujo, lo que es garantía de una calidad fuera de toda duda.\n\nLos amantes del blues de Chicago South Side como yo están de enhorabuena por poder saborear un álbum de estas características en el que se perpetua el blues en lugar de renovarlo. Este es el mensaje de las doce canciones que se incluyen en el mismo, canciones del propio John Primer, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, John Lee Hooker, Jimmy Rogers, Magic Slim o B.B. King.\n\nEn definitiva, un disco absolutamente necesario e imprescindible.\n\n– Vicente Zumel\n\nRock Doctor (April 1, 2024)\n\nFive Stars\n\nThis is the 4th collaboration between these two blues brothers from other mothers, and it’s a KILLER. Crawlin’ Kingsnake has a simultaneous rocking forcefulness and an uninhibited gliding ease that makes these songs sheer magic that sound just like Muddy Waters’ old band.\n\nIf you love Chicago-style blues (and who doesn’t)Crawlin’ Kingsnake should be an essential addition to your playlist. The band is a stunning, authentic gathering of blues masters; aside from Bob on harmonica and John on guitar and vocals we have Bob Stroger on bass, Jimi “Primetime” Smith on second guitar, the amazing Anthony Geraci on piano and Wes Starr on drums. To say that all concerned are playing at the top of their game here is an understatement. When you have artists like Primer and Corritore who have devoted their entire lives to the purity of the blues surrounded by sympathetic musicians like these in the studio, their track record of award nominations and wins as well as hall of fame inductions is secondary to the authentic Chicago blues sounds they have conjured up here for our enjoyment.\n\nThe blues is not a complex style of music to play, but to get it right is not an easy thing to do. John Primer and Bob Corritore have proven time and again that they each possess the key, through their 4 collaborations and well as the work they’ve done apart. Crawlin’ Kingsnake, so named after an old John Lee Hooker number, embodies that Chicago blues spirit as few other albums can, particularly in the modern age. Primer wrote Hiding Place but most of the other numbers here are stone cold blues classics by legends like Willie Dixon, BB King and, of course, Muddy Waters. The way this band plays combined with the source material makes for a spine-tingling, genuine blues experience of the highest order.\n\nIt all comes down to this; Crawlin’ Kingsnake isn’t just good blues, it’s GREAT blues. John Primer & Bob Corritore have just hit another one over the centerfield fence.\n\nHOT TRACKS: Crawlin’ Kingsnake, Stuff You Gotta Watch, Feel Like Going Home\n\nRock And Blues Muse (April 4, 2024)\n\nIt’s getting increasingly harder to hear traditional, real deal blues these days, but fortunately lifelong blues purists, John Primer and Bob Corritore bring us their fourth collaborative effort with Crawlin’ Kingsnake. Blues Hall of Famer Primer, fresh off his recent Grammy nomination for Tears for Magic Slim, continues to tour relentlessly with his Real Deal Blues Band and along with Lurrie Bell and Billy Flynn, is one of the few remaining traditional Chicago blues guitarists. Primer has the pedigree too; having played with Muddy until his death in 1983, preceded by Willie Dixon and followed by a long stint with Magic Slim.\n\nCorritore wears many hats. He grew up in Chicago but has lived in Phoenix for three decades now. He is the proprietor of that city’s most famous blues club, The Rhythm Room. As such, he jams and collaborates with many blues artists. You’ll find Bob’s name on multiple albums because he is one of the top traditional harp players and maybe even more importantly, because he has no problem leaving his ego at the door. Corritore’s acclaimed releases have been nominated or winners of major blues awards. He is also a record producer, radio show host, arts foundation founder, and occasional writer.\n\nThe two play together so comfortably and seamlessly, you’ll feel transported back to the heyday of that Chess Chicago blues sound. They sound every bit as vital as they did on their first team effort eleven years ago. Reinforcing their sound is a “super group” of traditional players – Bob Stroger on the bass, Jimi Primetime Smith on second guitar, Anthony Geraci on the piano, and Wes Starr on drums. They kick off with a vintage Chicago shuffle, “Take a Message,” with Corritore harmonica filling all the spaces surrounding Primer’s gritty vocal. Of course, the harp master gets a chance to display his extensive chops soloing as well as does Primer. The blues standard title track sounds as menacing as any of the countless versions of the tune. If Primer were performing this live, he may well preface it with, “Now, we’re gonna take you back deep in the alley.” His vocals, as on others, sound eerily like his mentor and former bandleader, Muddy Waters.\n\nIn fact, they cover three of Muddy’s tunes. They raise the tempo on “Stuff You Gotta Watch,” making it a joyous romp. Listeners may want the writer’s version on The Muddy Waters’ Woodstock album, performed with members of the Band for comparison. “Rosalee Blues” is a lesser-known Waters tune, a slow blues with Geraci playing Pinetop style to a tee. Primer turns to his slicing, fiery slide guitar in the closing standout “Feel Like Going Home.” We can relive the glory days of those great Muddy Waters’ bands with harp players like James Cotton, Jerry Portnoy and even Little Walter with pianists such as Otis Spann and Pinetop Perkins with these excellent, pure blues tracks.\n\nTrue to form Primer honors another of his mentors, Magic Slim on “Gravel Road,” delivering that vintage, simple but infectious Slim shuffle. While the album has a mix of blues chestnuts and more obscure material, Primer does contribute one original, “Hiding Place,” written and performed, of course, in vintage Chicago blues style, thereby sounding right at home with the repertoire. Primer’s guitar is especially strong on “This Little Voice.” There is one minor quibble, the lack of burning, slow blues among the many shuffles, with B.B. King/Dave Clarke’s “Chains and Things” the only entry there. Aside from that, this is a winner and strong candidate for Best Traditional Blues album in 2024. Primer, Corritore, and the band bring immense vitality to these vintage songs.\n\n– Jim Hynes\n\nPhilly Cheeze’s Rock & Blues Reviews (April 5, 2024)\n\nThere are not many artists around who instill Chicago blues authenticity into their music as Blues Hall-of-Famer John Primer and Bob Corritore do. Paired together for the fourth time since 2013, this dynamic duo returned to the studios and cut yet another fabulous album. Crawlin’ Kingsnake is the name, and it contains a dozen ripping tracks. With Corritore on harp and Primer on guitar and vocals, they are joined by bassist Bob Stroger, Jimi “Primetime” Smith on second guitar, Anthony Geraci on piano and Wes Starr on drums.\n\nAfter the smoke clears from the opening James Cotton song “Take a Message”, their title-track cover of John Lee Hooker’s “Crawlin’ Kingsnake” digs its claws in deep. Primer’s experienced vocals and precision guitar are fantastically supported by Geraci and the rhythm section. Then they roll right into Willie Dixon’s “Down in the Bottom” with Corritore keeping the song barreling down the tracks on harp. It sounds fantastic. They bring the fire to “Hiding Place”, a Primer original from his 1991 album Poor Man’s Blues. The song absolutely cooks. When they hit B.B. King’s “Chains and Things”, they play it sweet and slow. This one really brings me into my blues zone. When the big entrance of guitar and keys on Muddy Waters’ “Rosalee Blues” kick in, and I hear Primer start belting out the lyrics, I’m gob smacked for a simmering delightful listen. I absolutely love their performance of Magic Slim’s “Gravel Road”. It’s a signed, sealed, and delivered favorite.\n\nIt’s hard to beat the lineup of artists on Crawlin’ Kingsnake. This album is about as real-deal blues as an album can get. I highly recommend it.\n\n– Phillip Smith\n\nBlues Blast Magazine (April 11, 2024)\n\nThis is the fourth time since 2013 that John Primer and Bob Corritore have combined to record an album and it’s everything that fans of classic Chicago blues could want. The pair pay tribute to mentors like Muddy Waters and Magic Slim (Primer played with both for years), as well as giants of the blues like Howling Wolf, John Lee Hooker and BB King. Recorded over four sessions between 2021 and 2023, the album benefits from a stellar band of seasoned veterans, all steeped in the Chicago tradition: John Primer is on guitar and vocals, Bob Corritore on harp, Anthony Geraci on piano, Jimi ‘Primetime’ Smith on rhythm guitar and occasional backing vocals, Bob Stroger on bass and Wes Starr on drums. Needless to say, the playing throughout is exemplary.\n\nThe album opens with ‘Take A Message, written by Dave Steen (a frequent collaborator on Coco Montoya albums). John’s vocals and solo are excellent while Bob channels James Cotton who recorded the tune on his 1994 album Living The Blues. The title track is, of course, a JLH tune, superbly covered here, check out Anthony whose playing is the epitome of what blues piano should sound like. Next up it’s the Wolf with Willie Dixon’s ‘Down In The Bottom’, a song often covered, but rarely better than here, the familiar “pull and push” rhythm present and correct. John offers just one original in the set and it fits like a glove with the covers as he invites his girl to join him in his ‘Hiding Place’, accompanied by plenty of strong harp, pounding piano and searing guitar.\n\nThe middle portion of the album contains a run of four tunes from the greats of the blues: BB King’s ‘Chains And Things’ comes from Indianola Mississippi Seeds and is a classic slow blues; the band sets a furious pace on Muddy’s ‘Stuff You Gotta Watch’, then covers a second, less familiar Muddy tune, the slow grinder ‘Rosalie Blues’; Jimmy Rogers’ ‘You’re The One’ rattles along with jagged guitar and another strong vocal from John.\n\n‘Bow Down On Your Knees’ is a traditional gospel tune, performed here by just John and Bob while A.C. Reed is the source for ‘This Little Voice’ which rolls along brilliantly, one of the best cuts on the album. John pays tribute to Magic Slim with ‘Gravel Road’ before the band returns for a third time to the Muddy Waters catalogue for an extended take on ‘Feel Like Going Home’ that gives space for all the front line players to shine, John leading on some cutting slide, Bob and Anthony demonstrating just why they are such in-demand players.\n\nFans of Chicago blues played in the traditional way should buy this album without hesitation – highly recommended!\n\n– John Mitchell\n\nBlues Roadhouse (April 11, 2024)\n\nIf you’re a true-blues fan, there’s nothing quite like a dose of old-school blues to satisfy your soul.\n\n“Crawlin’ Kingsnake,” the fourth and latest collaboration between harp-master and album-producer extraordinaire Bob Corritore and veteran guitar-slinger/singer John Primer, is so old school that you can smell the eraser dust in the 12 vintage tracks on this outstanding collection of Chicago-style blues.\n\nPrimer and Corritore get stellar help from sidemen Bob Stroger on bass, Jimi “Primetime” Smith on second guitar, Anthony Geraci on piano, and Wes Starr on drums. It’s a tight and tasty aggregation that cuts right to the blues bone.\n\nIt all begins when “Take a Message” shuffles out and rocks hard to break things open, with Corritore’s tough harp riffs and Primer’s still-potent 79-year-old chops sounding appropriately down and dirty. The title track is next — it’s a wicked take on the classic “Kingsnake” blues, with a fierce guitar break that only serves to highlight Primer’s surrounding vocals.\n\n“Down In the Bottom” and “Hiding Place” (a Primer original) roll out next, both hard-driving romps teeming with the vitality of the blues. Like all the cuts here, everybody steps into the music, and the results are definitely blues with a feeling. “Chains and Things” slows the pace with a mournful blues lament about a ” cold-hearted wrong-doin’ woman,” teased with a sensuous Geraci piano solo.\n\n“Stuff You Gotta Watch” is the first of three Muddy Waters songs — this one updated with a quicker pace and Corritore’s blazing harp work. Next up, Waters’ “Rosalee Blues” is a lesser-known tune, but filled to the brim with Muddy’s spirit by Primer’s soulful vocals and stinging slide guitar. Geraci’s piano work adds a vital classic element.\n\n“You’re the One” lays down a funky feel before the music shifts into the gospel strains of “Bow Down On Your Knees,” a brief departure from the “devil’s music” that pays tribute to some of the spiritual headwaters of the blues.\n\nThe medium-tempo “This Little Voice” returns to full-throated blues rich with Primer’s vocals wrapped in Corritore’s passionate harp and swampy guitar riffs. The sturdy shuffle of the gritty “Gravel Road” is a tribute to the infectious music of the great Magic Slim, whose guitar work delivered the blues with powerful simplicity.\n\nThe closer is the third Waters’ cover, “Feel Like Going Home,” a masterful 6 1/2-minute finale to this effervescent set that gives everyone a chance to demonstrate the vitality of this classic music.\n\n“Crawlin’ Kingsnake” is simply an excellent album; that rare studio session that captures the attitude of a smoky blues club filled with half-century-old music that remains as vital as ever.\n\n– Jim White\n\nBluestown Music (Netherlands) (April 15, 2024)\n\nEvery record collector has them. Records you can play anytime and anywhere. Whether you have a dinner with friends, you own a bar and you still have guests sitting at the bar in the wee wee hours, or you are just alone all by yourself. This is it.\n\nJohn Primer and Bob Corritore did it. An uncomplicated, go-for-it blues album that will work on any occasion. A special shout out to Anthony Geraci, who delivers excellent piano parts, his notes dripping over the tracks like cool rain on a hot summer night.\n\nTwelve songs on this record. Covers by John Lee Hooker (Crawlin’ Kingsnake), Willie Dixon (Down in the Bottom), B.B. King (Chains and Things) and Muddy Waters (Stuff You Gotta Watch, Rosalee Blues, Feel Like Going Home) and a few others. One Primer original (Hiding Place).\n\nThis is the fourth collaboration between John Primer and Bob Corritore. An album of pure Chicago blues with beautiful 50’s artwork by Vince Ray.\n\nThe album was recorded over four sessions between 2021 and 2023, but it feels it was recorded in one session; great live feeling with a genuine windy city vibe and a good variety in grooves. Can’t say much more about this record.\n\nIf you have a friend you want to introduce to Chicago Blues, give him or her (or they) this album. The warm voice of John Primer will enchant you and Bob Corritore delivers great harmonica playing, not to say the least of the band; Bob Stroger on bass, Wes Starr on drums and Jimi “Primetime’ Smith on guitar and backing vocals. I already mentioned Anthony’s sweet drippin’ piano parts.\n\nChicago blues is alive baby!\n\n– Pascal Wilhelm\n\nRock ‘N’ Force Magazine (France) (April 17, 2024)\n\nFrench to English Translation:\n\nTalking about sincerity and authenticity when dealing with two monuments like JOHN PRIMER & BOB CORRITORE is almost unwelcome, if not inappropriate. The renowned and experienced guitar/harmonica tandem is one of the best representatives of this Chicago Blues, both inimitable and so identifiable. Through a dozen gems born in the Illinois city, “Crawlin’ Kingsnake” takes us into a festive, moving, dancing and literally luminous whirlwind.\n\nFor almost an hour, JOHN PRIMER & BOB CORRITORE once again make the Chicago Blues shine, surrounded by a group that will make all competition pale, even if it is rather the respect and sharing that inhabits all these beautiful people . For this fourth joint album, our two bluesmen maintain and make this current so dear to the great Muddy Waters sound. And when we know their pedigree and their journey, it seems more like a walk in the park, guided by a desire to transmit and a pleasure present in each note.\n\nTo carry out this sumptuous “Crawlin’ Kingsnake”, JOHN PRIMER & BOB CORRITORE, both from the Windy City, are accompanied by an elite group with Jimi Primetime Smith on guitar, Anthoni Geraci on piano, Bob Stroger on bass and Wes Starr on drums. I invite you to take a look at their splendid CVs to get a more concrete idea of ​​the very high level of the combo at work here. And it was between 2021 and 2023 that the sessions were recorded at Tempest Studios in Arizona.\n\nThroughout “Crawlin’ Kingsnake”, we find ourselves surrounded by James Cotton, John Lee Hooker, Willie Dixon, BB King, Jimmy Rogers, Magic Slim and of course Muddy Waters, covered three times. Warm and groovy, JOHN PRIMER & BOB CORRITORE put all their know-how, dexterity and relentless technique and above all a breathtaking feeling. Fiery slide, supercharged piano, harmonica transfixed with happiness and a captivating voice: nothing is missing from this new opus, which sounds so live and so authentic.\n\n– Francois Alaouret\n\nBlues 21 (Italy) (April 18, 2024)\n\nThe tradition of Chicago blues. This is John Primer, at seventy-nine, a working legend. This is Bob Corritore, at sixty-seven, a true harmonica master. Both together are already legendary. Guitarist and soul of the Teardrops in the best episodes of Magic Slim, Primer was Muddy Waters’ guitarist and band-leader during the last three years of the bluesman’s life. During his early years in Chicago, where he arrived in 1963, he also played alongside Junior Wells – seven days a week in Theresa’s Lounge house band – Magic Sam and James Cotton among others. Primer began his solo career in 1991 and became one of the most active and requested bluesman in Chicago. As a leader he has released twenty-three albums and his guitar appears in the credits of artists such as Little Milton, Big Mama Thorton, Big Daddy Kinsey, James Cotton, Eddie Shaw, Hubert Sumlin, Lester Davenport, Michael Coleman, Valerie Wellington, Willie Buck, Big Voice Odom and Jerry McCain among many others. Bob Corritore was chosen to continue the tradition of Chicago harmonica players started by Little Walter in the forties and later Sonny Boy Williamson, Big Walter Horton, James Cotton, Junior Wells and Carey Bell defined the most undoubtedly inimitable and genuine sound of the blues in Chicago. Born in the Windy City, active since the late seventies, Corritore settled in Phoenix in the early eighties where he had unprecedented musical activism. First with Louisiana Red and later with Kid Ramos, Henry Gray, Dave Riley, Jimi Primetime Smith, Janiva Magness and many others with whom he maintained a frenetic activity of recordings and live performances. In 1991, Corritore opened his own blues club, The Rhythm Room, which remains active to date. “Crawlin’ Kingsnake” is the fourth album that John Primer and Bob Corritore release together and is another museum piece for any fan of classic Chicago blues in the hands of two legends of the genre.\n\nRhythm Highways (April 30, 2024)\n\nJohn Primer has been incredibly prolific the past 10 years, and this new album with Bob Corritore ranks among his finest. John Primer has moved elegantly into his role as classy elder-statesman of the blues.\n\n– East Side Slim\n\nBlues Bytes (March/April 2024)\n\nDo you miss the classic Chicago blues from the 1950s? Do the old Chess recordings from the likes of Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Little Walter, Jimmy Rogers, and other blues icons from that era occupy a prime spot on your turntable, CD player, or online streaming platform?\n\nIf so, this is the album for you. Crawlin’ Kingsnake (VizzTone / SWMAF) from John Primer & Bob Corritore comes as close to capturing the sound and spirit of the classic Chicago blues as anything I’ve heard in a long time. I first saw Primer in person in 1987, have caught many of his live shows since then, and have listened to just about everything he’s recorded. This is by far the best the 79-year-old Primer has sounded in his long blues career, testament to the work that he and harmonica player Corritore have done together for much of the last decade. The pair have been successful in bringing out the best in each other.\n\nIt also helps to have a crack band of session veterans backing them on this album, notably Bob Stroger (bass) Jimi “Primetime” Smith (second guitar and backing vocals), Wes Starr (drums and percussion), and Anthony Geracia (piano).\n\nWhen reviewing an album, I’ll generally mark in my notes which cuts are my favorites and give an extra star to the best of the bunch. With Crawlin’ Kingsnake, no special notations were needed. Each of the dozen songs are outstanding. I can’t pick a favorite.\n\nOpening the set is “Take A Message,” an up-tempo shuffle with plenty of energy coming from Primer’s vocals and guitar, and we also hear a frantic piano solo from Geraci. That’s followed by the title cut, a John Lee Hooker original that is highlighted by a harmonica solo in which Corritore puts every breath he has into his instrument. The Howlin’ Wolf classic, “Down In the Bottom,” written by Willie Dixon, is an up-tempo number with a hypnotic rhythm.\n\nPrimer’s original “Hiding Place” opens with Elmore James-style guitar licks before Geraci jumps in with a rockin’ piano solo. The tempo slows for B.B. King’s “Chains And Things,” beginning with a tasteful guitar solo before Primer does some of his best vocal work with plenty of emotion coming from him. Later in the song, Geraci gives it that true ‘late nite’ feel with his piano work.\n\nOf course, we need to have a Muddy Waters song somewhere in the mix, getting a strong version of “Stuff You Gotta Watch,” with multiple instruments jamming away before both Primer and Smith start shouting out their vocals. Muddy cut number two is next, the slow number “Rosalee Blues,” with extra special vocals from Primer and a smokin’ harp solo from Corritore. The Jimmy Rogers classic “You’re The One” is given a funkier treatment, with Primer’s vocal lines answered by Smith’s rhythm guitar chords.\n\nThe traditional gospel standard “Bow Down On Your Knees” lasts just over a minute and a half, but Primer packs plenty of raw emotion into his voice while accompanied by just his guitar and Corritore’s harmonica. A.C. Reed’s “This Little Voice” is next, with Primer putting a little more bass into his voice on this nice mid-tempo shuffle.\n\nPrimer spent a lot of years as a member of Magic Slim’s Teardrops, so it’s appropriate that we get one of Slim’s originals, the up-tempo “Gravel Road,” with Corritore echoing each vocal line with tasteful harmonica riffs. Closing the album is a real gem, an extended version of Muddy’s slow blues classic “Feel Like Going Home.” It’s a fine vehicle for Primer’s expressive and emotional vocals to go with some of Corritore’s best harmonica work, especially his solo around the midway point. Geraci also lays down a tasty piano break, preceding a dose of wonderful slide guitar from Primer. This one’s a killer!\n\nThe 2024 blues season has just begun with plenty of new releases coming down the line, but I can’t imagine anything better than Crawlin’ Kingsnake. This is an absolutely essential addition to your blues collection.\n\n– Bill Mitchell\n\nBack To The Roots (Belgium) (April 2024)\n\nHarmonicaspeler Bob Corritore is super-productief en brengt meerdere albums per jaar uit. Vaak zijn die samengested uit op-names die hij doorheen de jaren maakte met de groten der blues die zijn club in Phoenix, AZ aandeden. Dit is zijn vierde gezamenlijke album met Chicagoveteraan John Primer. Het bevat twaalf nieuwe op-names van klassiekers en de bezetting is fenomenaal. Naast John en Bob vinden we de 93-jarige bassist Bob Stroger, Jimi ‘Pri-metime’ Smith op ritmegitaar, pianist Anthony Geraci en – verrassend – Wes Starr als drummer. Waarom verrassend, vraag je? Wel, omdat hij een pure Texasblues-drummer is. Zijn uitstapje naar Chicago valt trouwens reuze mee en dat geldt trou-wens voor het hele album. Mensen die erin slagen om covers een meerwaarde te geven vanwege originele en frisse vertol-kingen verdienen alle respect. Neem nu het platgewalste ‘Down In The Bottom’ (Willie Dixon). Met meesterlijke tussentij-den en een virtuos pompende bas in de backbeat herleeft het nummer als nooit tevoren. ‘You’re The One’ (Jimmie Rogers) – doorgaans een doodgewone shuffle – hoorde je nog nooit zo funky. En ook ‘This Little Voice’ (bekend van Byther Smith) krijgt een opmerkelijke versie toebedeeld. We hoorden het nummer nog niet eerder met zoveel ruite voor de harmonica – Bob maakt trouwens mooie bendings – en alweer vallen de bijzondere arrangemen-ten van Strogers bas op. Als we onze ogen sluiten, kan kunnen we hem door wat we horen ook echt zién bassen. ‘Crawlin’ Kingsnake’ is een steengoed album, boor-devol echte, pure Chicagoblues in zijn meest organische en inventieve vorm. Hier worden we heel blij van!\n\n– Franky Bruneel\n\nSound 36 Magazine (Italy) (May 5, 2024)\n\nCrawlin’ Kingsnake è un vecchio successo di John Lee Hooker ed è il brano che dà il titolo all’album\n\nInizia con la recensione di Crawlin’ Kingsnake la mia collaborazione con la rivista Online\n\nSOund36.Ringrazio la redazione e il suo Direttore per la fiducia e la disponibilità.\n\nMe&Blues è un format radiofonico, da qualche anno anche una rubrica che racconta il Blues e il Rock Blues in tutte le forme e tradizioni. Almeno ci provo. La musica è l’arte popolare più vicina all’uomo. La tecnologia e i social sono fonti inesauribili per la sua diffusione mentre, soggettive sono le scelte che spesso nascono casualmente. Come è successo al sottoscritto. Ma questa è un’altra storia. Il Blues comincia a far parte della mia vita, verso la fine degli anni 70. 1I\n\ngrido di quel popolo che cantava il dolore e la miseria, la spinta energica e coraggiosa per spezzare le ignobili catene della schiavitù, mi hanno totalmente coinvolto e continuano ad arricchirmi ancora. Questo è il vecchio Blues: vero, intrigante, attraente e irresistibilmente seducente.\n\nA rendere il tutto facilmente accessibile è l’estro, la fantasia e la bravura di molti musicisti. Ne cito solo due: John Primer e Bob Corritore. Bob è uno degli armonicisti blues più attivi e apprezzati della scena attuale. Il suo è uno stile con la chiara impronta proveniente dalla scuola dei vecchi maestri del Chicago Blues. John Primer è una leggenda vivente, un chitarrista che con il suo estro ha contribuito alla costruzione e diffusione del suono della Città del Vento nel Mondo. Non per altro recentemente il suo nome è stato inserito nella Blues Hall Of Fame.\n\nLa loro è principalmente una vera amicizia, ma nello stesso tempo una collaborazione professionale nata nel 2013 con l’album Knockin’ Around These Blues.\n\nCrawlin’ Kingsnake è uscito il 29.03.2024, senza dubbio il migliore dei loro quattro album realizzati insieme. Grazie anche a una band di tutto rispetto, che vede insieme: Bob Stroger al basso,Jimi Primetime Smith alla seconda chitarra, Anthony Geraci al piano e Wes Starr alla batteria. Fidatevi…. il meglio.\n\nL’album è suonato magistralmente bene, la chitarra di John Primer e la sua voce primeggiano, mentre Bob Corritore fa vibrare le ance della sua armonica senza esitazione. Basta solo questo per rendersi conto che questi due artisti hanno dedicato una vita per mantenere vivo il Blues. Con Crawlin’ Kingsnake ci sono riusciti alla grande.\n\nUna tracklist composta da dodici pezzi, un solo brano originale scritto da John Primer, gli altri vengono dalla storia di gente come BB King, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Magic Slim ecc. Anche se il disco è stato registrato in più sessioni,a più riprese nell’arco di tre anni,la schietta atmosfera che emana il suo ascolto porta a pensare ad un unica sessione, in diretta live e senza tagli e cuci.\n\nLoro possono farlo. Crawlin’ Kingsnake è un vecchio successo di John Lee Hooker ed è il brano che dà il titolo all’album. La storia del Blues è fatta di pezzi storici che ripetutamente vengono rifatti. Spesso bene, spessissimo male. Anche Crawlin’ Kingsnake è entrata nella girandola delle cover. A memoria, mentre scrivo, ricordo la versione unica di Jim Morrison (Doors). La superba rielaborazione di John Primer e Bob Corritore cancella ogni dubbio, ci mette al sicuro: John Lee\n\nHooker non avrà nessun motivo di rivoltarsi nella tomba.\n\n– Gianfranco Piria\n\nLiving Blues Magazine (May/June 2024)\n\nOver the last decade, bluesmen John Primer and Bob Corritore have built up one of the finest duo discographies in contemporary blues. Their latest tandem release, Crawlin’ Kingsnake,adds another notch to the win column. Twelve tracks of crackling, meaty musical might, this is the kind of album that reminds listeners why they fell in love with the blues in the first place.\n\nPrimer is in magnificent voice here, one moment belting like an old-school blues shouter on the tons-of-fun Hiding Place, the next packing the weight of the doomstruck world into his delivery of Bow Down on Your Knees. His guitar work is every bit as electrifying. The Willie Dixon classic Down in the Bottom finds Primer mixing up a savory swamp sludge alongside guitarist Jimi “Primetime” Smith. Then, he brings shimmering, late-hour elegance to the mid-tempo B.B. King cooker Chains and Things.\n\nLocked into a comfortable groove alongside Primer, Corritore leans into his harmonica with everything he’s got. He sears the air with pealing high notes and volcanic rips on Rosalee Blues(written by Primer’s old boss Muddy Waters), and This Little Voice finds his tone utterly filling the room. His clipped notes nip at Primer’s vocals like viper bites on the John Lee Hooker–penned title cut, and he brings an arresting blend of taste and strength to the Spanish-tinged You’re the One.\n\nPrimer and Corritore have assembled a crew of jackhammer-heavy hitters to accompany them on Crawlin’ Kingsnake. The aforementioned Smith provides peerless rhythmic support throughout the recording, interlacing with Primer’s ax in a formidable fortress of sound. Veteran bassist Bob Stroger forges the bedrock with unshakeable assurance, and he spreads a bit of soul over the undercurrent of Take a Message. Wes Starr’s drums are a critical component to the vibe, as the steady-rolling Waters tune Stuff You Gotta Watch makes clear. And Anthony Geraci cuts loose like the barrelhouse pianist from hell, his flourishes an ideal seasoning for Gravel Road’s ramblin’-man stew.\n\nCrawlin’ Kingsnake closes with the album’s third Waters composition, the aptly titled Feel Like Going Home. Indeed, it’s like a trip back to that storied Land Where the Blues Began: relentless rhythm, virtuosic solos, just enough tenderness to ease the lyrics’ pain. If this were a concert, right about here is where the crowd would break out the lighters. Primer and Corritore fully warrant this ecstatic salute. Long may they burn.\n\n– Matt R. Lohr\n\nOleg’s Blues Blog (Russia) (June 14, 2024)\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nEleven years ago, John Primer (79) and Bob Corritore (67) began their collaboration. This spring they released their fourth album together with the brand new ‘Crawlin Kingsnake’. During these 11 years, both elderly gentlemen won many awards in the field of blues, and now they have recorded an old-school blues disc.\n\nIt has eleven covers and one song written by John Primer (Hiding place). The album begins with the track “Take a message”, which immediately makes us understand what awaits us. Two blues electric guitars, John’s warm Mississippi voice, and Bob making the most of his harmonica.\n\nNext is John Lee Hooker’s “Crawlin’ Kingsnake”, followed by Willie Dixon’s “Down in the bottom”. The album included three covers of Muddy Waters, including the dynamic track “Stuff you gonna watch” and “Rosalee blues”, a slow blues starring Anthony Geraci on piano. “Gravel road” and “Feel like going home” complete the traditional blues album.\n\nBoth Primer and Corritore are at the peak of their careers: Primer was recently inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, as well as receiving numerous awards and a Grammy nomination. Likewise, Corritore has been active in European festivals, releasing five critically acclaimed albums in 2023, being the subject of numerous articles, receiving numerous nominations, and even winning in some places.\n\nThe band sounds like Muddy Waters’ band in its heyday, and with its playing it proves once again (or tries to prove) that such blues will always exist. At least, with this album they completely convinced me."
