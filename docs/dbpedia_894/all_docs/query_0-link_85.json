        "text": "Henry Gray, born in Louisiana in 1925, pulled a stretch in World War II and then migrated to Chicago, which was where Howlin' Wolf found him. Gray had been honing his piano chops for years in a variety of barrelhouse and back-room settings throughout the South, but it was Chicago that whipped him into a professional. In 1956 Gray joined Wolf's regular band, playing piano for the venerable bluesman until 1968. During that sojourn Gray contributed to recordings by several other artists on the Chess label, pulling time with Little Walter, Jimmy Rogers and Muddy Waters, among others. In the years since, he's performed and recorded with such luminaries as B.B. King, Elmore James, Jimmy Reed, Buddy Guy, Taj Mahal and Koko Taylor.\n\nNow a sprightly 76 years old, Gray turns his attentions to the city that provided his entree into those settings on his own showcase, Henry Gray Plays Chicago Blues. Produced by Rhythm Room impresario Bob Corritore, who contributes harmonica on the album, Henry Gray Plays is a South Side stroll through the history of electric blues in the Windy City. Originals and covers (by the likes of Lowell Fulson, Elmore James and Gray's old mentor, Howlin' Wolf) flow so seamlessly into one another that they might have been recorded on a single summer night -- a pleasant surprise, given that the sessions for this album stretched over a period of five years.\n\nWisely, the production on Henry Gray Plays keeps the piano levels low enough so that the band's ensemble work shines throughout, and Gray here enjoys formidable backing indeed. Muddy Waters' longtime associate Bob Margolin contributes guitar, as does the Fabulous Thunderbirds' Kid Ramos. Drummer Chico Chism (who also worked with Howlin' Wolf for a time) provides tight and certain rhythm. In addition to his piano work, Gray sings all the vocals here as well, and if his voice sometimes pales in comparison to the playing, that's less a criticism than a simple case of you-can't-outshine-the-sun."
