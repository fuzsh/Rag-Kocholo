Please listen to the episode audio for precise quotes and email any queries to jamie@bluesdisciples.org.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nWelcome back and thanks for joining us here today. I’m Jamie and I am a Blues Disciple. Now, please join me for a little while to hear some excellent blues from some of the masters. Blues Disciples is a 501c3, non-profit organization. Please note that earphones or earbuds will enhance your listening pleasure.\n\nToday, we are fortunate to play some excerpts from a recent joint interview we had with major blues legend, Mr. John Primer, and the great blues harp genius, Mr. Bob Corritore. These two gentlemen have been performing and collaborating on various projects for a number of years. And only last week, they introduced their latest collaboration which is the excellent CD entitled Crawlin’ Kingsnake. On this great album the musical team that John and Bob pulled together for the album including\n\nJohn Primer – excellent vocals and slide guitar.\n\nBob Corritore – brilliant blue’s harp.\n\nBob Stroger – steady electric base.\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith – great guitar work at supporting vocals.\n\nAnthony Geraci – piano.\n\nWes Starr – keeps everything together with his drums and percussion.\n\nThis will be the first of two podcasts with John and Bob focused on this album and the great music they chose to record here.\n\nSo we’ll kick things off with Mr. John Primer’s reaction when I asked why they chose “Take a Message” as their first song on the album.\n\nJohn Primer\n\nThe reason why it’s there is because it’s one of my favorite tunes that I heard Albert King do back in the days. And so, she came to my mind. I started singing again, Bob said that he liked it. So we decided to recorded it.\n\nBob Corritore\n\nMy little bit on that is John just came up with that suggestion. “I got this one for you, Bob.” Then he just went and I loved it. That ended up being the opening track.\n\n[Take a Message – John Primer & Bob Corritore]\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nFolks, our friend and Chicago Blues Legend, Mr. John Primer, is one of the greatest blues men alive today. He was born in Mississippi in 1945 and started plucking at a diddley bow on the side of his house when he was only four years old. Then borrowed his cousin’s guitar whenever he could get a chance and he taught himself how to tune and play it.\n\nJohn Primer is one of the last group of blues artists who were self taught for the most part grew up in Mississippi in a Jim Crow era, sharecropper family and then moved to Chicago as a team to find opportunities for a better life performing and recording the blues.\n\nOver his career John has been a principal member and band leader for early blues legends Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters and Magic Slim, before focusing on his own solo career. Today at the age of 79, John Primer is very active performing all over the world. Just last year he was honored with his well-deserved induction into the International Blues Foundation’s Blues Hall of Fame.\n\nHere’s the album’s next song.\n\nHow about John Lee Hooker’s Crawlin’ Kingsnake, your album title?\n\nJohn Primer\n\nWell, it was my earliest song when I was young. You can hear my walkin I was in Mississippi there. Maybe I heard in the cotton field and stuff singing.\n\nSo I got it from them. I didn’t know who made the song. I love that song and it’s a good song and I heard he and Muddy Waters sing it. And so, I got the idea to sing it when I heard Muddy sing it. I like the way Muddy did it cuz John Lee Hookie, he do a great song, but he’s strange the way he do it.\n\n[Crawlin’ Kingsnake – John Primer & Bob Corritore]\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nAnd to refresh your memory Bob Corritore was born in 1956 in Chicago. As a teen Bob studied and learned Blue’s heart by listening to blue’s heart legends on the radio and records and watching blue’s harp masters like Bg Walter Horton on Maxwell Street. A little later on Bob was mentored by blues legends Mr. Junior Wells and Mr. Big Walter Horton when he was invited to sit in with them at performances in South and West Side Blues clubs. Bob then moved to Phoenix in 1981 and eventually started up his now world famous Blues Club The Rhythm Room in 1991. Bob Corritore has performed and recorded with a who’s who of past and present blues greats and legends such as Bo Diddley, Little Milton, Jimmy Rogers, Pinetop Perkins, Ike Turner, Honeyboy Edwards, Willie “Big Eyes” Smith, Nappy Brown and many others.\n\nSo we continue.\n\nHow about “Down in the Bottom”?\n\nJohn Primer\n\nThat’s a Howlin Wolf song that I heard him sing. Most all those songs. I knew all those songs. We used to see them all the time at Theresa’s Lounge in Chicago. Seven long heart all up…. I know a lot of songs, so when you come up with one I’ve been I’ve been doing it for decades.\n\nBob Corritore\n\nJohn is a human jukebox. He knows so many songs, for all the years I’m playing with John. He always surprises me with new material. He just has such a huge repertoire.\n\n[Down in the Bottom – John Primer & Bob Corritore]\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nHow about your song “Hiding Place”?\n\nJohn Primer\n\nThat’s the song I write a song and I say, come on, I’ve got an idea from uh come on for him. And let me take you to my heart and play back and thinking about about the girls back then you know.\n\nSo when I heard that song you know take it to the hiding place. I got it. The idea from either way. Yeah I got the idea of stuff so I’m going to make shit. Yeah, so I got that idea.\n\nBob Corritore\n\nI just loved the song. Interesting story behind it is, John had just had the weekend from hell. His flight got delayed due to a snowstorm and it was late at night when John finally got there from the airport. They had a incredibly frustrating day. That was the first song we did in that session. John was getting out all this frustration. We just kicked some butt on that song. You did that was after a long day, if you remember.\n\n[Hiding Place – John Primer & Bob Corritore]\n\nBob Corritore\n\nBob Stroger is kind of the secret weapon of our album, John. I think I mean he just he’s just laying it down.\n\nJohn Primer\n\nRight. He is a great man. Bob\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nHe’s 93 now?\n\nJohn Primer\n\n93 years old. Yeah.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nWe can only wish.\n\nBob Corritore\n\nJamie, next year we are playing the Notodden Blues Festival in 2025. So John B, 80 then and Bob Stroger will be 94. I’ll be 68 then at that point.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nAnd next, how about “Chains and Things”, the BB King song, right?\n\nJohn Primer\n\nThere’s a BB King, I like the way BB King sings it. But my idea comes from when I was on tour with the Magic Slim Band in 1982. So Magic Slim was the first one who brought Little Milton on the tour Black & Blue. So Little Milton was singing everynight on his show. So I just got it from him.\n\nBob Corritore\n\nA lot of times in these sessions we just let it rip. John will suggest something and we just do it. Sometimes I’ll write down some songs that we had done the night before and I’m like John how about we do this? But that was one that John just came up with and it’s like, hey, let’s do this. So it’s like okay and it came out.\n\n[Chains and Things – John Primer & Bob Corritore]\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nHow about Rosalee Blues?\n\nJohn Primer\n\nOh that’s another one. I got that’s who they might have one of you so it’s on on that CD2. Yeah. Oh yeah.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nAnd you guys kicked ass with that thing. I mean it was it was it was great.\n\nBob Corritore\n\nWe did night before at the club and I suggested John that we do it again and then just laid it up, like John does.\n\n[Rosalee Blues – John Primer & Bob Corritore]\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nSo sow about Bow Down on Your Knees, a little gospel there, right?\n\nThat song there is from Boyd Rivers “You Gotta Take Sick and Die One of These Days.” Yeah, that song “Bow Down.” I’m related to him. You know, he moved to nearby Canton, MS. He also came to my hometown Camden when I was a kid. He was walking around and singing Murder Water songs and that song there, too.\n\nBob Corritore\n\nSome of those song have been found forever. They’re just traditional church songs.\n\n[Bow Down on Your Knees – John Primer & Bob Corritore]\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nWhat about This Little Voice? I guess that’s A.C. Reed, right?\n\nJohn Primer\n\nA.C. Reed, right. I knew the song partially and a lot of times I’ll be singing it out. A.C. Reed was singing the correct way. So Bob wrote all the lyrics for me to sing it right. I was used to singing but I wasn’t sing halfway right but it was working.\n\nBob Corritore\n\nJohn don’t be a modest there. You sang your butt off on that.\n\nJohn Primer\n\nI know. Yeah, that is what I said. But you could live with something like that. But that’s why because I don’t like the same song the more I record. I want the lyrics right. Because when you sing the song from the record. Well, you put in your mic knowing for sometimes, you don’t understand what they said. You don’t have the lyrics right so the best way to get the lyrics is to put the lyrics down the way they sing it. And then you got it. A lot of songs the lyrics were not quite quite right, but it works.\n\n[This Little Voice – John Primer & Bob Corritore]\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nYou, Bobby Rush and Buddy Guy are probably the top three people that actually are authentic, came up from the sharecropping life and so forth. And God almighty, we owe you guys a great deal. You are a national treasures.\n\nJohn Primer\n\nThank you. Yeah, we can do what we do and like Bobby Rush, you can’t tell that he is that old. And Bob Stroger, too. And Buddy (Guy), he that way too, he still can go.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nYeah, you guys are out cracking it all the time. And that keeps you young too doesn’t it?\n\nJohn Primer\n\nIt definitely does. Yeah, but the most part of things is try to not let music stress you out. I’ll tell you that if you let music stretch you out, it’ll stretch you out. A lot of musicians that I knew, to me, I feel that. I think there most of them who have gone on to blues heaven, that was there problem. Drinking a lot of alcohol and stuff like that and not taking care of themselves.\n\nBut I never was a drinker and never smoke cigarettes and stuff like that. Never did no other drugs. I got a lot of cousins the same age as I am, and they got gone of drinking and drinking, and drinking. I am happy to be playing music. Not sad, happy.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nAs I said, like fellow living major blues legends, Buddy Guy and Bobby Rush, Mr. John Primer is a true national treasure who is giving back a tremendous amount to the blues community and to other blues artists through his artistic sharing and helping to promote others in their careers. Back in the mid 1980s, John Primer and Magic Slim headlined a number of European Blues festivals and recordings that brought in blues artists like Hubert Sumlin, Pinetop Perkins and others who were left behind in the late 60s and 70s, by the industry’s focus on pop and British rock.\n\nMr. Bob Corritore has also done a great deal to help other artists through his bookings at his world famous blues club, The Rhythm Room, in Phoenix and through his recording vault filled with the many blues artists like Hubert Sumlin, Pinetop Perkins, Little Milton and many others who have performed at Bob’s club.\n\nSo, to wrap up today, here again is John Primer and Bob Corritore to introduce another great song from their just released CD album, Crawlin’ Kingsnake. Thank you again for listening.\n\nHow about Feel Like Going Home?\n\nJohn Primer\n\nYeah one of Muddy’s tunes. I love that tune too. I play it a lot. We play it on every show that I do right now.\n\nBob Corriotre\n\nJohn just really nails at the slide guitar. The band just really got that one too. Listen to Bob Stroger’s base on that."
