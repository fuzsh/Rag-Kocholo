        "text": "All Ages\n\nGeneral Admission\n\n20\n\nLegends of Chicago Blues - Chicago Blues Trio\n\nOscar Wilson, Jimi Primetime Smith, Bob Corritore\n\nA trio of powerful Chicago blues musicians with incredible musical pedigrees who are responsible the most acclaimed real deal house rocking and soul quenching Chicago blues of recent times. True blues fans won’t want to miss Southside Chicago born Oscar Wilson, the lead singer of the much-loved Alligator Recording artists “The Cashbox Kings”. Fellow Chicagoan, Westside born Living Blues Magazine cover star Jimi “Primetime” Smith, the son of Jimmy Reed’s one time drummer, songwriter and manager Johnnie Mae Dunston. Jimi’s 2023 album “The World In A Jug” with our third legendary member Chicago born Bob Corritore, the fabled blues harmonica ace, record producer and owner of Phoenix’s legendary The Rhythm Room is tearing up the blues world with much critical acclaim and high charting radio play. Joining forces for a rare set of UK dates – the real deal Chicago blues played by the real deal musicians is coming to the UK!\n\nTo support the trio, we are proud to present the duo of Giles Robson & Sandy Tweeddale, who recently sold out 10 nights of Giles Robson's smash hit, 5 star show, 'Up Close with the Blues' at this year's Edinburgh Fringe."
