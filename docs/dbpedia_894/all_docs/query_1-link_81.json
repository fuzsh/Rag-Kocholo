        "text": "HUGHESVILLE — The 28th Annual Billtown Blues Festival is set for June 10 at the Lycoming County Fairgrounds, 1 E. Park St. Gates open at 11 a.m., with non-stop music on two stages beginning at noon and running until 10 p.m. The Billtown Blues Association, a non-profit organization whose mission is to celebrate, honor and present American Roots Music, delivers once again with a focus on quality, diversity, and presenting some of the nation’s most prominent up and coming blues artists, those of legendary status, plus local and regional acts devoted to this special American born art form.\n\nFeatured on the Main Stage this year will be 3rd Street Blues, a group of students from the Uptown Music Collective, local favorites Greg Burgess and Friends, the winner of the Billtown Blues Association’s recent audition competition the Jeff Fetterman Band, The Billy Price Band, Mississippi Heat, Mike Zito, The Chris O’Leary Band and Bob’s of the Blues: Bob Margolin, Bob Corritore and Bob Stroger. The Acoustic Tent will present Dave Brumbaugh’s Guitar Workshop, which is open to all ages, Hannah Bingman and Doug McMinn’s 10th anniversary celebration, the solo/duo recent audition winners The Twin Sinners and Bob Margolin & Special Guests.\n\nFor the past 28 years, the Billtown Blues Festival has used a formula that has served them well — if it’s not broken, don’t fix it. Their many patrons who come year after year know exactly what to expect and there are rarely any surprises. The festival also is a place where friends come to meet once a year.\n\n“They come in, often go to their ‘spot,’ greet their friends and family who join them, sit back and enjoy the music,” said Bonnie Tallman, secretary of the Billtown Blues Association and chair of the talent committee for the festival. “Coming to our festival is like coming ‘home’ for them. The folks coming for the first time find everything easy, simple, and adapt quickly. We find through the years many attendees ‘reunion’ and meet up with friends they initially met at the festival and look forward to catching up year after year.”\n\nIn June of 1990, the first Billtown Blues Festival was started, with just a very small group of people and a makeshift stage surrounded by cornfields. After four years, the festival moved to its current location at the Lycoming County Fairgrounds. Since the event’s humble beginnings, the Billtown Blues Association has seen the festival grow and change in many ways. It is small by design, manageable and focused totally on the music, with as little distraction from that as possible. They try to never repeat a lineup, as performances each year are completely different from the year before. One exception is their opening educational workshop held in the Acoustic tent which runs in three year cycles.\n\n“Currently that workshop is Dave Brumbaugh’s Blues Guitar Workshop,” Tallman said. “In the past, we have had a percussion workshop led by Steve Mitchell, and a harmonica workshop led by Andy Barnhart.”\n\nThe performance format focuses on diversity, as they include young, up and coming artists who are beginning to create a buzz in the blues world, such as Mike Zito and the Chris O’Leary band on the bill this year. Also featured are artists of prominence or legendary status, such as Muddy Water’s alumni, Bob Margolin and 85-year-old Bob Stroger, closing the festival. On the main stage this year are musicians ranging in age from 14 to 85.\n\n“We always try and present ethnic and gender diversity, and finally, and often the most difficult, is presenting a variety of blues music styles and a variety of instrumentation focus,” Tallman said. “It would be rare for us to offer our attendees an entire day of one blues guitar focused band after the other. “\n\nThis year, two of the bands include major horn sections, two feature more traditional upright bass players, one act is blues piano led, and most of the acts on the bill this year have featured blues harmonica players. They have also added two new food vendors — The Grilled Cheese Cafe and the Real Taste Mexican Street Food.\n\n“So, always something ‘new,’ always something ‘old,’ and always lots of something ‘blue,’ ‘” Tallman said.\n\nOver the years, the festival has become much bigger in terms of attendance, which in turn has translated into moving to a bigger space, providing more services and more security. Two and a half decades later, the festival remains all about celebrating blues music as an iconic and indigenous American art form and finding the best local and national talent available.\n\nEach year, the festival needs a certain number of attendees to remain solvent, and they strive to achieve that number; but they try not to focus so much on growth as they do maintaining a loyal audience and serving them well.\n\n“We do however expand our advertising each year to new markets with the hope of drawing blues fans from outside of the immediate area,” Tallman said. “We do work at targeting a younger audience.”\n\nExposing younger people to the blues and encouraging them to put the Billtown Blues Festival on their “to do” list is very important to them. Education is a big part of what they do to accomplish encouraging younger people to get involved.\n\n“There is a perception about blues music that is completely wrong – that it is slow, simple, sad and primitive,” Tallman said. “The truth is, it is just the opposite — it is lively, powerful, sometimes funny, emotionally stimulating and very, very difficult to play well.”\n\nThe festival has been making some progress in this regard with the Uptown Music Collective stressing blues in their curriculum; with young blues bands forming, like the Gabe Stillman led band, the Billtown Giants. Other young blues performers include The Twin Sinners, a young duo performing in the acoustic tent this year, and opening the festival on the main stage, the 3rd Street Blues Band, with ages ranging from 14-17.\n\n“We also attract a number of young people to join us as valuable volunteers who are being exposed to the blues via osmosis all day long,” Tallman said. “It is our hope it sticks.”\n\nGreg Burgess, of Selinsgrove, has been singing and playing the piano ever since, as he said, he “first felt the pangs of unrequited love.” For 15 consecutive years Burgess has lead the Jazz Workshop Brunch held each Sunday in Williamsport along with Steve Mitchell on drums and Bill Stetz on bass. In the 1980s, Burgess was a sideman with nationally known bluesman Joe Beard, and during his tenure, backed up blues legends Big Joe Turner, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, and Taj Mahal, soul artist Roy C, and opened for Millie Jackson.\n\n“Every year we invite and spotlight a musician who has played in the region for a long time – maintained a devotion to playing the blues and has solid visibility in the blues world,” Tallman said. “This year, that person is Greg Burgess and Friends featured on the Main Stage.”\n\nBob Margolin, who is from North Carolina, just came off the 40th Anniversary “Last Waltz” tour, where he played on the original film alongside Muddy Waters. Margolin also just won a Blues Music Award (BMA) in Memphis, Tennessee for Traditional Male Blues Artist of the Year. Margolin will perform a set in the Acoustic tent with his touring bandmates, Tad Walters on harp, and Chuck Cotton on drums. Closing the Festival on the main stage, under the name “Bobs of the Blues,” will be 85-year-old Bob Stroger from Chicago on bass, and Bob Corritore from Arizona on harmonica.
