        "text": "SuNDAY NOVEMBER 10, 2024 @ 7PM\n\nThe Bromley Blues Club present the very best of Chicago Blues, direct from the USA\n\nJimi “Prime Time” Smith was born in Chicago in 1959 His mother, Johnnie Mae Dunson aka; The Big Boss Lady,” worked alongside blues legend Jimmy Reed, as his song writer, drummer and manager.\n\nJimi began playing guitar at 12 under the teachings of Jimmy Reed, Hubert Sumlin and Eddie Taylor, and spent his teenage years playing around the blues clubs of Chicago with the likes of Big Walter Horton, Floyd Jones, Playboy Vinson, Sunnyland slim, Jimmy Johnson, Queen Sylvia, Playboy Benson, Eddie Taylor, Fenton Robertson and many more Chicagoland blues legends.\n\nBlues with a feeling is something that Oscar Wilson has known about from an up-close-and-personal perspective since he was a young child, growing up on the south side of Chicago on 43rd Street in a six-room apartment split by two families.\n\nHis mother knew a lot of bluesmen including Junior Wells, Big Smokey Smothers, Elmore James, Little Mack Simmons and Honeyboy Edwards all used to come their house on Friday night for ‘fish fries’ and they’d all sit there and play/sing.\n\nNow the highly acclaimed frontman of The Cashbox Kings, whose also the albums have showcased Oscar’s knack for powerful and humorous song-writing.\n\nBorn in 1956 in Chicago, Bob Corritore cut his teeth sitting in on Maxwell Street with John Henry Davis and others, until old enough to attend blues clubs.\n\nHe hung around great harmonica players such as Big Walter Horton, Little Mack Simmons, Louis Myers, Junior Wells, Big John Wrencher and Carey Bell. He would regularly see Howlin’ Wolf, Muddy Waters, Billy Boy Arnold, Sunnyland Slim and other blues legends in action.\n\nIn many cases he became personal friends with these blues veterans. Corritore worked with Tail Dragger, Big Moose Walker, Willie Buck, Louis and Dave Myers in the late 70s and early 80s.\n\nHe produced his first recordings during that time, taking unheralded harmonica greats such as Little Willie Anderson and Big Leon Brooks into the studio to produce their now classic debut albums.\n\nNow owner of the Rhythm Room in Phoenix and the producer of a huge catalogue of powerful albums of authentic blues with a huge array of blues giants, Bob is considered one of the most important pillars of the USA and international blues scenes."
