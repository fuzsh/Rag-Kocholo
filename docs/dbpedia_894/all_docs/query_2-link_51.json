Please listen to the episode audio for precise quotes and email any queries to jamie@bluesdisciples.org.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nHi. Welcome back and thanks for joining us here today. I’m Jamie and I am a Blues Disciple. Now, please join me for a little while to hear some excellent blues music from some of the masters of the blues. Blues Disciples is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Please note that earphones or earbuds will definitely enhance your listening pleasure.\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith & Bob Corritore\n\nToday, we are very pleased to have two great Chicago blues artists join us for discussion and airing of their latest album. Those artists are bluesman guitarist, composer and singer Mr. Jimi “Primetime” Smith and our buddy, Chicago Blues Harpist extraordinaire, Mr. Bob Corritore. We have substantial background and other recording interviews with Bob Corritore on a number of our podcasts including podcast numbers 143, 148, 177 and 187.\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith was born in 1959 into a wonderful Chicago blues family whose incredible mother, blues lady, Chicago blues drummer and composer, Ms Johnnie Mae Dunson-Smith, known in Chicago as “The Queen of Maxwell Street.” In his teens, Jimi started performing with Jimmy Reed and other extended family members such as Big Walter Horton, Eddie Taylor and Sunnyland Slim. In the 1970’s Jimi and Bob Corritore first met when they were both working the clubs around Chicago and now, years later, Jimi “Primetime” Smith has found his way to Phoenix and a new phase of his life and career.\n\nThe World in a Jug\n\nThis new album is a continuation of Bob Corritore’s “From The Vaults” Series and is titled “The World In A Jug.” There are 10 songs on the album and Jimi composed 6 of them based on his life experiences and two of the songs were composed by Jimi’s very talented mother.\n\nJimi starts off by sharing with us a little bit about his early years growing up around so many legendary Chicago blues artists.\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nFor a long time, as a child, there were always musicians at my home. A lot of times I didn’t know that they were famous musicians. Like Willie Dixon, Koko Taylor, Hubert Sumlin and Eddie Taylor. Jimmy Reed was just another member of the family, like an uncle. Then he decided to leave his family and come and move in with us and quit drinking. Probably about 1970-71. I was 11 or 12 years old. My dad took him to the VA To get clean because my dad worked at the VA. After that, Jimmy moved in with us and he started teaching me how to play guitar, his style of music.\n\nLike I said, Eddie Taylor and all them used to always be around the house because they were just family friends. And then they started teaching me how to play my own style of guitar without trying to play without the Capo and learning how to develop my own style of playing.\n\nI picked up a lot of stuff from him. And from Hubert learning how to play with my fingers, more than picks. Yes, it was just a great musical journey always seeing my mom get ready for her gigs when I was a little child.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nTell us more about the major blues legend, Jimmy Reed. I think I was 19 years old the first time I saw Jimmy Reed. He was a great musician and he did so much for the blues.\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nYes, he did. You know, a lot of people didn’t understand that he and Eddie Taylor, with Eddie Taylor being a guy who taught Jimmy. He taught Jimmy Reed how to play because Jimmy Reed was playing harp and Eddie taught him how to play the rhythm guitar and learn how to develop his style. And I was like, wow man. I didn’t realize who Willie Dixon was until I saw him on the Jubilee Showcase in Chicago on TV, playing behind gospel groups playing with the Staple Singers and different people. Wow. That’s my Uncle Willie.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nWhat a great childhood memory.\n\nFast forward to the late seventies when Bob met Jimi in their hometown of Chicago.\n\nBob Corritore\n\nFirst time I met Jimi was in the late ’70s, when he was playing guitar behind Big Walter Horton. That was a regular Sunday ritual. You had to go see Big Walter Horton each Sunday over at Blues on Halsted. All of a sudden, he shows up with this new guitar player. This six foot two tall guy. He looked older than me but he was actually younger than me. That was to Jimi “Primetime” Smith. But back then he was called James Smith. He hadn’t incorporated the name “Primetime” yet. We met there first and hung out a little bit and talked a little bit. Friendly guy. Then I didn’t see him for a lot of years. The next thing, I get a phone call and it’s hey, Bob, it’s Jimi “Primetime” Smith and I’m coming out to Phoenix. No kidding, I said. I think that the very same day he called me that he was in town, we put him on stage and we haven’t looked back since. It’s been a joy having him in this town and exploring the combination of what we can do together and where that can go. It’s a powerful little thing. We’re really looking forward to taking that to Europe on different stages in this coming year. So we have a tour of Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg. And then we’re also going to be playing in Sweden together a few weeks after that.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nJimi brings us up to date when I asked “what moved you to Phoenix?”\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nI came out to visit one time because my fiance was out here. Then I decided I’m gonna just move out because this long distant relationship ain’t working. I remembered that my friend Bob was out there. I hadn’t seen Bob since the the 70s or 80s. I called him up and I said, “Hey Bob, I’m moving out there.” And he says okay. Come on down. So, the first time I went to the club, I think it was Bob’s or the club’s birthday. I sat in with him and played with him. After that we’ve just been playing ever since.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nThis album was created by a great team of blues artists who came together in different sessions and performances. Jimi “Primetime” Smith’s great vocals and incredible guitar work along with Bob Corritore’s excellent Chicago blues harp are with us on each song.\n\nContributing Artists\n\nHere is a quick rundown of the other great contributing artists, including the number of songs (1 if not otherwise noted)\n\nGuitar\n\nJohnny Rapp, 9\n\nPatrick Skog\n\nBass\n\nBob Stroger, 2\n\nYahni Riley, 5\n\nTroy Sandow, 2\n\nTony Tomlinson\n\nPiano\n\nHenry Gray, 2 (Howlin’ Wolf’s longtime pianist and Jimi Smith’s longtime family friend)\n\nFred Kaplan, 3\n\nOrgan\n\nShea Marshall, 3\n\nDrums\n\nBrian Fahey, 7\n\nMarty Dodson, 2\n\nAllen West\n\nTenor Sax\n\nDoug James\n\nBackup Vocals\n\nEboni McDonald\n\nCelia King\n\nSongs\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith will provide us some background on each of the 10 songs and Bob Corritore will provide his timely comments.\n\nPlease note that we had substantial technical issues last week and I wound up having to call Bob in Switzerland yesterday where he was on tour so that we could re-record some of his comments. So, please excuse the vocal changes.\n\nNow, here is Jimi.\n\nI Got The World in a Jug\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nHow about “I Got The World in a Jug”\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nMy mom wrote that for Jimmy Reed after he got clean. They had developed different bands that they were playing with, different musicians. They did a recording in 1975. She wrote four songs which was “World in a Jug, “We Gotta Stick Together,” “Same Old Thing.” And there was one that she sang by herself called “Milking the Cow.” We decided to take “World in The Jug.” I said well I can do that. I’ve been doing that for a long time. I said let’s do that. We’d play it at the club a few times. Bob said, “I kind of like that. Let’s record it.”\n\n[I Got The World in a Jug – Jimi “Primetime” Smith & Bob Corritore]\n\nLove Her With A Feeling\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nHow about “Love Her with a Feeling”\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nAs I remember I used to play that song for years and hear it for years, as a child growing up and then I played it with Eddie Taylor and different other artists growing up in Chicago and through my time of playing music all through the years. Sometimes it just hits me. Then I’ve heard Junior Wells do it, and I’m like, I really like that. That’s one of the live songs. We decided to use that one too.\n\n[Love Her with a Feeling – Jimi “Primetime” Smith & Bob Corritore]\n\nFire and Ice\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nHow about “Fire & Ice” recorded live at the Rhythm Room?\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nSometimes they say life brings stuff on to you, especially with relationships and different stuff. I had been having some difficulties with relationships. All of a sudden, you sit down and lyrics just start hitting you in your head. So you have to put it down before you forget it. That song was actually written because we were having some difficulties but we got through it.\n\n[Fire & Ice – Jimi “Primetime” Smith & Bob Corritore]\n\nYou for Me\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nHow about “You for Me”?\n\nBob Corritore\n\nSo at Henry Gray’s 92nd birthday, I put together a band including Jimi “Primetime Smith.” We went into the recording studio and we did a bunch of tracks, some with Jimi singing, some with Henry singing, some with Oscar Wilson singing, and we had a blast recording a bunch of stuff. And one of the numbers was called “You for Me” in a Jimmy Reed’s style number. It features a beautiful solo by Henry Gray and Jimi was really touched by that because he remembered Henry Gray from when he was just a little child. They hadn’t seen each other in many, many years. And it was a great night. It was a great reunion. And of course, the piece is just beautiful and just flows off of everybody. It just was a really relaxed Jimmy Reed style song and Henry Gray played with Jimmy Reed’s band. So did Jimi “Primetime,” Tom Smith. The whole band just caught the whole thing. I’m doing my best “Jimmy Reed,” of course, nobody will play like Jimmy Reed. He played in a unique way. I think we caught a good one with this one.\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nYeah, man. I love that. That was so great. And that was a good thing. That was wonderful of him coming out. Like I said, the Lord does things in mysterious ways, and I think he brought me out here to Phoenix to be with Bob, and to meet some people and reconnect with people that I haven’t seen in so long. And that was one of the treasures being able to reconnect with Henry Gray, man. I mean, because he used to be at our house when I was a child all the time, you know? And he and my mom were great friends.\n\n[You for Me – Jimi “Primetime” Smith & Bob Corritore]\n\nSouthbound\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nAnother song with Mr Gray was “Southbound.”\n\nBob Corritore\n\nAnd what’s cool about this song is if you listen to it, Henry is playing beautiful, very rhythmic piano lines that are just kind of underneath the surface and at times they stick out. But they’re just really, really gorgeous. And when you separate all of this out, you can make out all of this cool stuff that Henry Gray is playing. Of course, Jimi sings the song. So cool. He’s from that area. He’s from the Westside of Chicago, but he used to spend some time with his family in Alabama. Especially in the summers. Become a cool groovy song and, yeah, it was fun to get behind on the harmonica. And then, of course, the whole band is just grooving along with this song.\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nYeah, “Southbound” is a song that I’ve done years ago on a different album and then I decided to do this. The song actually came from I developed that from being in the South because I lived in the South with my grandmother as a child off and on. My mom would have to go and tour and do gigs. She would send me south to spend time with my grandmother. So I have to stay with my grandmother Bessemer Alabama, that’s where my mom originally was born and raised in Alabama. The town was Mobile Junction, just outside of Bessemer. That’s how that came about. I started thinking about the South, about living down there. So that’s how that one just came to me.\n\n[Southbound – Jimi “Primetime” Smith & Bob Corritore]\n\nWalkin’\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nHow about “Walkin”?\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nI always wanted to do something kind of slide, Elmo James-ish type thing. I’ve always wanted to do that and I was sitting and just playing the guitar and that just kind of came to me. That’s kind of nice. You know. So I just started thinking about lyrics, just started getting in the head, words and stuff. You got to figure out which way to put them, and how that shit fits. And so that’s actually how “Walkin’” came about.\n\nI told a story in the magazine, when I was a child and Jimmy (Reed) was trying to teach me how to play guitar, I could not get it. I just could not figure it out. No matter how he showed me, I left the room and went in the back, where my mom was, to get some coffee. And I sat there and I cried like a baby. I prayed to God and I said am I just that dumb that I can’t figure this out. Then it was like lightning hit me in the head and I was just playing it and playing it and playing it man. If I could hear it, I could see it in my mind and figure out how things went. And that’s how I’ve been playing all my life, man, it’s just the way that it was a gift from God.\n\nThat and lyrics, man. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. But most of the time they are coming to me when. I’ve been sitting pretty much at home here now and it’s kind of like when they say when Superman had to go to his Fortress of Solitude. In my Fortress of Solitude stuff started just coming to me now.\n\n[Walkin’ “Primetime” Smith & Bob Corritore]\n\nWe Got to Stick Together\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nAnother one of your mother’s song, “We Got to Stick Together.”\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nThat’s one of the ones that she had written at that time of the four songs that she had done with Jimmy Reed back in 1975. It was a song that they sang together. They released the song but then it was pulled off the market because of some illegalities about the label. I don’t know what happened to all those records back then. But after that I started performing all of her songs.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nYou hear. Jimmy. Reed. In that song too!\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nOh, yeh, definitely.\n\n[We Got to Stick Together – “Primetime” Smith & Bob Corritore]\n\nSoul Food\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nThe next one I’m showing here is “Soul Food.”\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nBob has to talk about that one.\n\nBob Corritore\n\nThe song “Soul Food” was originally recorded by Rex Garvin & The Mighty Cravers. It’s kind of this rock and roll soul number because it’s pumping organ, and cool, saxophone, and background singers, and the whole thing. I just fell in love with the song and I wanted Jimi “Primetime” Smith to sing it. I wasn’t sure how it was going to go. It’s a difficult song to sing. I put together this band that I felt could really pump the song along like in the original. Of course it will not be the original but we added a little twist to it and it was real Walkin’ in its own right.\n\nJimi just took over and took charge in this song. He sang it with so much energy and power and then of course his guitar solo and then the little guitar Vamp at the end and we all just had a blast off the song. Then the female vocalist we added a little bit later on. Celia and Eboni just came in and added those parts. They were really into the song. While they were singing it, they were dancing along while they were doing the vocal parts on the song. So the whole thing is just a party.\n\nAnd if you love food of any kind here is a total celebration of soul food. And here’s Jimi speaking firsthand about how much he loves it. At the very end, he added his own little touch talking about all different types of soul food – bring me some of this and bring me some of that. I think you’ll find that this whole song is just a party.\n\n[Soul Food – “Primetime” Smith & Bob Corritore]\n\nIn a Spin\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nThe next one is “In a Spin.”\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nOnce again, it’s about relationships. My lady at the time went through some difficult times. Oh my God, girl, you gotta be in a spin. As soon as I said that, I realized, oh, I gotta go write this down. Then the arrangement on that one, I gotta give credit to Johnny Rap for that because originally I had it more like a BB King or Robert Cray minor blues thing. Johnny said why don’t we try it like this and then so we started playing. I said, oh yeah. That’s pretty cool. More of a jazzier thing.\n\n[Soul Food – “Primetime” Smith & Bob Corritore]\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nAs we start to wrap up our interview with Jimi “Primetime” Smith and Bob Corritore, I’d like to thank Bob again for his great talent, and his efforts to bring together a diverse set of excellent blues artists to provide all of us with more quality real blues music. We appreciate the opportunity to meet and spend time with Mr. Smith and the music he and his mother have created. Folks, Mr. Jimi “Primetime” Smith exemplifies the integrity and faith we love in the real blues. And, it does it so well!\n\nAgain, we’re looking forward to seeing Jimi and Bob along with Chicago blues legends John Primer and Bob Stroger, plus keyboardist Anthony Geraci and drummer Wes Starr in Phoenix at Bob Corritore’s Rhythm Room on March 31st, 2023.\n\nThank y’all for listening and now, here’s Jimi to introduce the last song, “Blinded” and take us on out of here.\n\nBlinded\n\nJimi “Primetime” Smith\n\nBlinded. Yep. Another one about a woman. Different relationship that time. I was in Minnesota when I wrote that song and I saw this lady, man. And I was like, wow, look at that girl, man. She got me blinded, man. Oh, Lord, you know, there’s another one. So I sat down and I started writing the lyrics for it and, and I went in the studio and did it with some other people at the time. It’s on a different album. On my “Back on Track” album. Then Bob heard and he said I think that’s a pretty cool song, we should try that. And so we went and did it.\n\n[Blinded – “Primetime” Smith & Bob Corritore]"
