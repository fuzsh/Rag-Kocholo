Love fearlessly” (Earl Edmonson, April 23rd, 2023).\n\nAs a curious and brilliant man, his interests ran wide and deep. This is best\n\nexemplified by the range of his academic career, from a bachelor’s in marine\n\nbiology to his master’s degree in Spanish Literature. With his profound\n\nknowledge of Spanish language and Latin American culture, he was able to\n\nconnect with folks from every walk of life on his frequent trips to Mexico.\n\nI feel very privileged to have lived a life inside of the music” (Earl Edmonson,\n\nApril 10th, 2023). The Edmonson family is an enviable bunch – full of wit,\n\nadventure, scholarly success, and most notably – music. Earl embodies all the\n\nabove. Of his many achievements, Earl won the fingerpicking contest at the\n\n1991 Telluride Bluegrass festival. This earned him a Larrivee guitar that\n\nmatched his beautiful singing voice throughout his storied career. The same\n\nyear, he joined the Titan Valley Warheads band and entertained thousands\n\nof people from historic steakhouses to festival main stages, over the course\n\nof 30 years. He was a founding member of the Tucson Folk Festival, which is\n\nnow one of the longest-running, free folk music festivals in the country.”\n\nTravis Edmonson\n\nTravis Edmonson was born on September 23, 1932, in Long Beach,\n\nCalifornia, but grew up in Nogales, Arizona, just across the border\n\nfrom Mexico.

The two\n\nplayed folk music, infused with the influence of Mexican styles that\n\nEdmonson enjoyed, particularly mariachi. After seven years together, the\n\ntwo split up and Edmonson continued to perform solo.\n\nEdmonson was considered a folk music &quot;pioneer&quot; and influenced groups such\n\nas the Kingston Trio.[4] Bob Shane, the only surviving member of the trio,\n\nsaid in an interview that he &quot;idolized him,&quot; saying &quot;he had command of the\n\nstage better than anyone I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;[1] Edmonson suffered a stroke in\n\n1982, after which he experienced health problems and performed little until\n\nhis death on May 9, 2009, in Mesa, Arizona.\n\nDennis Francis – DJ Papa Ranger\n\nDennis Francis aka Papa Ranger was born in Kingston, Jamaica in 1956 and\n\nbegan his musical journey in the streets of Trenchtown, a west Kingston\n\nJamaican slum in 1969.
