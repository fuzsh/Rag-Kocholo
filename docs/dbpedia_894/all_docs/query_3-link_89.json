        "text": "Listen here to this week’s edition of The Blues Come Calling:\n\nWith a tip of the hat to convention, there was a big bluesy welcome to one and all, with an admission that it had been mighty fun this week pulling together the playlist for this week’s show. There was so much good stuff about, so there was more than I could fit into our time together. But, I started off with a track from my album of the week from California guitarist and singer, Christopher ‘Bubba’ Clerc, known on stage as Bubba & The Big Bad Blues. This was their long-awaited second album, titled ‘Drifting’, and my first choice was a great piece of big band blues called ‘Lose These Blues’. Then, there was a taster from the upcoming debut album by Laura Evans, called ‘State of Mind’. The album is due for release early in July and I brought a preview of what to expect . . . ‘I’m Alright’.\n\nVaneese Thomas was another familiar name on our playlist. She was there, burnishing her credentials and keeping her famous family name alive with her new album, “Fight The Good Fight”. It’s got plenty of gutsy and bluesy songs from Vaneese delivered with some powerful performances and strong messages, including my choice . . . the superb . . .’Bad Man’. While I was breezing through the other new releases there was a real delight, in the form of the new album from Canadian blues troubadour, David Owen. Sadly, he’s been away from the music scene for a while, but he’s back with a collection of 11 songs that show off David’s very fine acoustic guitar and harp. The album is called ‘Oh Suzannah Blues’ and I couldn’t resist playing the track that’s become a bit of an earworm for me . . . ‘Sweet Sugar Mama’.\n\nJust So You Know\n\nLose These Blues – Bubba & The Big Bad Blues (Drifting – 2022)\n\nI’m Alright – Laura Evans (State Of Mind – 2022)\n\nJust So You Know – The Cinelli Brothers (Villa Jukejoint – 2022)\n\nSo Much To Do – Steven Troch (The Call – 2022)\n\nBad Man – Vaneese Thomas (Fight The Good Fight – 2022)\n\nSweet Sugar Mama – David Owen (Oh Suzannah Blues – 2022)\n\nShe’s Your Problem Now – Bubba & The Big Bad Blues (Drifting – 2022)\n\nPinetop’s Pick\n\nCrank It Up/Scratch My Back – The Sons Of The Blues (Billy Branch & The Sons Of The Blues – 200)\n\nLookin’ Good\n\nTalkin Woman – Lowell Fulson (Black Nights – 2002)\n\nCan’t See What You’re Doing – Bonham & Bullick (Bonham & Bullick – 2022)\n\nAin’t Gonna Work – Deuce Denninger & Jason Heeter (Deuce & Heeter: The ’79 Sessions – 2022)\n\nFools Are Getting Scarcer – Duke Robillard (They Called It Rhythm & Blues – 2022)\n\nIf You Need Me – Bubba & The Big Bad Blues (Drifting – 2022)\n\nHard Road – Dana Fuchs (Borrowed Time – 2022)\n\nLookin’ Good – Alber Solo (Lookin’ Good – 2022)\n\nAmong the blues birthdays this week (and there are plenty of them) was Lowell Fulson and it was as good an excuse as I needed to pull out a favourite of mine from his catalogue. That was his 1966 Kent 45 ‘Talkin’ Woman’. Then, we were jumping forward some 56 years to today and something from Deborah Bonham and her renowned guitarist, husband Peter Bullick. They’re on my giglist soon on one of the dates of their UK and European tours, when I’m hoping they will deliver a particular favourite of mine from the album . . . ‘Can’t See What You’re Doing’.\n\nAs our blues time together was slipping away fast, I squeezed in a few more gems from the ‘pending tray’, including Dana Fuchs with a track from her new album ‘Borrowed Time’. It came with a warning that my choice, ‘Hard Road’, was a serious head nodder and foot tapper . . . and it was! But, all too soon, it was time to collect up the music, tidy up the studio and start planning next week’s playlist, but before that, there was a big thanks for your good company and the hope that we’ll meet again the next time The Blues Come Calling. Until then . . . remember . . . have fun . . . and we headed home with Alber Solo and his great little instrumental ‘Lookin Good’.\n\nBroadcast by Miskin Radio on 31 March 2022\n\nBroadcast by Blues at Rock Radio on 2 April 2022\n\nBroadcast by Blues at Rock Radio on 3 April 2022\n\nListen here to this week’s Cruising with The Commissioner:\n\nWell, here we are heading into April and in our twelfth year of Cruising with The Commissioner. The days are getting longer and sunshine is lingering longer, so the opportunities for cruising in the sunshine are improving considerably. This put us in even better spirits when Tuesday night rolled around and the Cruise Mobile rolled out with it’s radio playing plenty of tasty treats for your listening pleasure. It all started with Pricilla Bowman & The Spaniels with their 1958 Abner release ‘A Rockin’ Good Way’ . . . . and there was more . . .\n\nDuring the week we have had quite a few encounters with friendly faces recently, who have been keen to offer us suggestions for our playlists and they may pop up on our playlists in future weeks. One got slipped in here, courtesy of Dave, who suggested something by Detroit band, Frijid Pink. The band are probably best known for their version of ‘House Of The Rising Sun’, but we decided to choose their interpretation of ‘Go Now’.\n\nLove The Life I Live\n\nA Rocking Good Way – The Spaniels\n\nSpeedo – The Cadillacs\n\nHoodoo – Al Reed\n\nLive The Life I Love – Georgie Fame\n\nHeaven Must Have Sent You – The Elgins\n\nGo Now – Frijid Pink\n\nGirls & Guitars\n\nBig Girls Blues – Joanna Connor\n\nWhere Were You?\n\nWhere Were You? – Danny Adler\n\nPack Fair & Square – Nine Below Zero\n\nHit The Road Jack – Rhoda Scott\n\nAll Night Worker – Rufus Thomas\n\nMichael (The Lover) – The CODs\n\nDon’t Want To Sit Down – O.V. Wright\n\nI Need Your Loving – Don Gardiner & Dee Dee Ford\n\nSaturday Night Boogie Woogie Man – Mitch Woods & The Lazy Jumpers\n\nCadillac Boogie – Jimmy Liggins & His Drops Of Joy\n\nYou Made A Boo Boo – Bob & Earl\n\nNow, our Girls & Guitars feature this week turned the spotlight on Chicago-based blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist Joanna Connor. She was born in Brooklyn and was drawn to the Chicago blues scene in the early 1980s, where she eventually got to share the stage with some great names, like James Cotton, Junior Wells, and Buddy Guy. To show off her talents, we chose the title track from her 1996 album ‘Big Girl Blues’.\n\nWell, it’s surprising just how quickly our cruising time can pass and although we ran out of time, we most certainly didn’t run out of music. So, there’s plenty more in store for next week, when we’ll call by in the cruise mobile, same time same place, with a seat saved especially for you, just so we can all go Cruising with The Commissioner. Until then . . . remember . . . have fun!\n\nBroadcast by Miskin Radio on 29 March 2022\n\nListen here to this week’s edition of Doctor Roberts Sonic Tonic:\n\nWell, the sunshine has helped to brighten the days lately and there were big smiles, bright eyes and a big cheery welcome from here, when the weekend came peeking around the corner and it was time for this week’s special dose of Doctor Roberts Sonic Tonic. It’s the trusted elixir for those who dare to be different and are keen to escape from the mundane and predictable music of ‘ordinary radio’. It comes with proven track record of raising the spirits and exciting the senses, as was ably demonstrated when we kicked off with The New Orleans Suspects doing a little ‘Neighbour Strut’. There was plenty more of the ‘good stuff’ lined up too and for those who were ready to throw a few funky moves . . . their moment arrived with The Hawkmen who don’t want you to take off your shoes!\n\nNow, this week’s Tell It Like It Is brought a song with a story from back in 2011, when Levon Helm was recovering from his New York recording studio burning down and some dire health problems that robbed him of his singing voice. To avoid foreclosure on his home he gathered together some friendly faces to form a band and started home concerts, called ‘The Midnight Rambles’. The word went out and folks were soon buying tickets, with plenty of notable names coming to sit in at the events. It proved to be a great success, and among those names who came along to sing there and help raise the spirits and some money too, was Mavis Staples. So, it was a joy later, with the return of Levon’s voice, that he and Mavis decided to record an album together and it’s being released soon under the title, ‘Carry Me Home’ and it includes their duet ‘You Got To Move’.\n\nBack On Track\n\nNeighbourhood Strut – The New Orleans Suspects\n\nFunky Feet – The Hawkmen\n\nEvery Breath You Take – The Vintage Reggae Soundsystem\n\nYou Don’t Know What You Mean To Me – Bill Wyman’s Rhythm Kings\n\nBack On Track – Emma Noble & Nick Corbin\n\nTell It Like It Is\n\nYou Got To Move – Mavis Staples & Levon Helm\n\nJust Enough\n\nJust Enough – Angel Forrest (ft Kal David & Lauri Bono)\n\nTennessee Girl – Mike Farris\n\nRighteous Loving – 8 Ball Aitken\n\nMellow Moment\n\nYou Send Me – Hiram Bullock\n\nWish I Could\n\nAll My Love – Liz Mandville Greeson\n\nZulu Coconuts – Jon Cleary\n\nI Wish I Could Remember Loving You – Lloyd Jones & Teresa James\n\nBlack Suit & Pink Champagne – Kingen\n\nNow, if ever there was an outstanding candidate for our Mellow Moment . . . this week’s choice was certainly one. It came from guitarist and singer Hiram Bullock who has played with the great and the good, as well as forging his own solo career. Along the way he cut a superb version of that Sam Cooke favourite ‘You Send Me’. So, this time, I was deputising Hiram to soothe you smooth you and help you relax . . . and if there was someone special nearby, you had my permission to smooch.\n\nThere were plenty of irresistible rhythms in the choices for this week’s Sonic Tonic and a good deal of dangerous dancing was no doubt by Lloyd Jones & Teresa James, among those out there in listening land. If it may have been little comfort to know they were definitely not alone. But. all too soon, a glance at the studio clock, signalled that it was time to gather up the music, tidy up the studio and squeeze in my last choice for this week’s Sonic Tonic. But, just before that , there was a big thanks for your good company for this show and the hope that we’ll meet again soon for another dose of Doctor Roberts Sonic Tonic. Until then . . . remember . . . have fun!\n\nBroadcast by Miskin Radio on 25 March 2022\n\nListen here to this week’s edition of The Blues Come Calling:\n\nWell, it surely came as no surprise that there was a big bluesy welcome to one and all, especially for those looking for a little taste of the best blues around. But, if I’d told you that I was opening up with a song called ‘Monday Monday’, you might have expected a Mama or Papa or two, but on this occasion is was British blues legend Roger Cotton, with a track from his 2008 debut album ‘A Long Way Back’ and featuring vocals there by another local talent, Paul Cox.\n\nThere was plenty of enthusiasm too, for my first choice from my album of the week. This was the new release by Duke Robillard and very appropriately titled ‘They Called It Rhythm & Blues’. It has plenty to get the deep dyed bluesers nodding and smiling, including my first choice ‘I Can’t Understand It’.\n\nThere was a respectful marking of the birthday this week of one of the big names of the blues, Otis Spann, who was born this week back in 1930. I had the great pleasure of meeting Otis back in the day and a most charming and self effacing gent he was too. So, I pulled out a personal favourite . . . a number he cut in 1969 with Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac . . . ‘Someday Baby’.\n\nTell Me Why\n\nMonday Monday – Roger Cotton & Paul Cox (A Long Way Back – 2008)\n\nI Can’t Understand It – Duke Robillard (They Called It Rhythm & Blues – 2022)\n\nLone Star Blues – Edgar Winter & Keb Mo (Brother Johnny – 2022)\n\nHootchie Coochie Man – Popa Chubby (Emotional Gangster – 2022)\n\nHeaven Water – Angelique Francis (Long River – 2022)\n\nSomeday Baby – Otis Spann & Fleetwood Mac (The Biggest Thing Since Colossus – 1969)\n\nTell Me Why – Duke Robillard & Kim Wilson (They Called It Rhythm & Blues – 2022)\n\nPinetop’s Pick\n\nSleep In Job – Sticks McGhee (Classics 1951-1959 – 2006)\n\nWelcome To The Party\n\nRooster Blues – Bob Corritore & Robert Bilbo Walker (Bob Corritore & Friends – Down Home Blues Review – 2022)\n\nYou Don’t Deserve To Be My Man – Miss Bix (Bring It – 2022)\n\nSomeday After A While – Duke Robillard (They Called It Rhythm & Blues – 2022)\n\nWelcome To The Party – Eddie Blues Barney (Give It All You Got – 2022)\n\nStrain On My Heart – Bernard Allison (Highs & Lows – 2022)\n\nMr. Easy – Larry McCray ft. Joe Bonamassa (Blues Without You – 2022)\n\nNow, there’ll be plenty of smiles among the deep dyed bluesers for Bob Corritore and his enthusiastic rummaging in the archives . . . he’s been doing that for his series of releases ‘Bob Corritore & Friends’ . . . and that’s a track from his one titled ‘Down Home Blues Review’. That track featured Robert Bilbo Walker along with Bob on that old favourite, ‘Rooster Blues’. Then, there was the welcome return of Bernard Allison with a big favourite of mine from his current ‘Highs & Lows’ album. This was a track with all the hallmarks of a memorable number from Bernard and it’s one that’ll get plenty more plays before it gets put on the shelf, but that’ll be a good while yet . . . ‘Strain On My Heart’.\n\nThen, a quick glance at the studio clock confirmed that once again with our blues time together was running out fast and still with plenty more choices lined up. So, there’ll be a few in the pending tray for next week, but I was playing out this week with something from last week’s album of the week. This was another choice from the mighty Larry McCray and his ‘Blues Without You’ album . . . but before that there was a big thanks for your good company on this week’s show and the hope that we’ll meet again the next time The Blues Come Calling. Until then . . . remember . . . have fun!\n\nBroadcast by Miskin Radio on 24 March 2022\n\nBroadcast by Blues at Rock Radio on 26 March 2022\n\nBroadcast by Blues at Rock Radio on 27 March 2022\n\nListen here to this week’s Cruising with The Commissioner:\n\nWell, after the red Sahara sand sprinkled on everything here this past week, the sun has had his hat on in the Grand Duchy and we the most of it with some generous ‘quaffing and scoffing’ on the South terrace. The Cruise Control wine cellar offered up some fine pink fizz and The Cruisettes and Mr Merlot were on hand to celebrate our twelfth year of Cruising with The Commissioner.\n\nThe Cruise Mobile has travelled many miles, since we started our weekly cruising, and we’ve played some extraordinarily good rock, soul and ‘real’ rhythm and blues along the way. There have been many welcome guests and many memorable moments, especially all the planning and preparations before we set off on our very first Cruising with The Commissioner show. In the event, it all seems to have gone well, but we keep The Samaritans’ number handy, just in case!\n\nSo, we set off this week for a celebratory adventure in the Cruise Mobile and encouraged everyone to throw caution to the wind as they jumped aboard. We launched ourselves down the road in the company of Hank Ballard and the very first track played on our very first show, suitably titled ‘Let’s Go, Let’s Go, Let’s Go’. Then, we were heading for New Orleans . . . . . and why not?\n\nLet’s Go\n\nLet’s Go, Let’s Go, Let’s Go – Hank Ballard\n\nOn The Second Line – Gavin Povey\n\nZulu Coconuts – Jon Cleary\n\nThat’s What You’re Doing To Me – The Dominoes\n\nHold On – The Radiants\n\nI Can’t Help Myself – Donnie Elbert\n\nGotta Have Your Love – The Sapphires\n\nTalk To Me – Little Willie John\n\nSmooth Sailing (From Now On) – The Temptations\n\nGirls & Guitars\n\nYou Need To Be With Me – Susan Tedeschi\n\nTippety Top\n\nMorning Dew – Bonnie Dobson\n\nIt Must Have Been The Wind – The Fun & Games\n\nToo Many Tears – Miles Stone\n\nTippety Top – The Rays\n\nShe Walks Right In – Diz & The Doormen\n\nNo Particular Place To Go – Chuck Berry\n\nNow, our Girls & Guitars feature has been a regular here since we started and we’ve included many great talents since and to prove the point, we pulled out another from the Cruising Library . . . this week it was Susan Tedeschi with an early featured number . . . ‘You Need To Be With Me’.\n\nAll too soon, we ran out of time on our anniversary show and had to turn for home. But not before we offered a big thanks to all those who helped to get us up and running and have contributed to our cruises over the past three years. That we’re still going may have surprised a good many folks, including us, but it has been fun and we’ve discovered plenty of good music along the way. So, there was a special thanks to you, dear listener, for joining us as we’ve meandered through some of the best in rock, soul and ‘real’ rhythm and blues. All being well, we’ll be back again next week, same time, same place, with the Cruise Mobile all tuned up and a seat saved especially for you, just so we can all go Cruising with The Commissioner. Until then . . . remember . . . have fun!\n\nBroadcast by Miskin Radio on 22 March 2022\n\nListen here to this week’s edition of Doctor Roberts Sonic Tonic:\n\nWell, I arrived with a big smile, bright eyes and a big cheery welcome for one and all. That came with seductive invitation to sample this week’s special dose of Doctor Roberts Sonic Tonic. As always, it came with its secret ingredients, guaranteed to raise the spirits and excite the senses and we kicked off events with The Kennedy Administration and they came with the promise of plenty more of the ‘good stuff’ lined up for the rest of the Sonic Tonic. Then, for those inclined to some dangerous dancing . . . their moment arrived with Reel Big Fish.\n\nThis week’s Tell It Like It Is brought us a song with a story and a taste of Motown. This came from a group that was dubbed “Motown’s best kept secret”. They were The Originals . . . who were formed in 1966 and found plenty of work in the latter half of the 60s as background singers for artists like Jimmy Ruffin, Stevie Wonder, Edwin Starr, Marvin Gaye and others. As artists in their own right, the Originals were recording and performing up to the early 80s. They had a million seller hit with the Marvin Gaye composition “Baby I’m For Real”, but my choice was a Smokey Robinson produced gem, written by the band members and featured on their 1970 album ”Portrait of The Originals”. In my humble opinion it deserved to be released as a single, but it wasn’t.\n\nWhere You At\n\nIt’s Over Now – The Kennedy Administration\n\nBrown Eyed Girl – Reel Big Fish\n\nLet Her Go – Thornbird\n\nI Didn’t See That Coming – Dan Penn\n\nWhere You At – Jon Cleary\n\nTell It Like It Is\n\nDon’t Stop Now – The Originals\n\nDon’t Stop\n\nJust Don’t Stop – Joe Tatton Trio & The Haggis Horns\n\nGood Boy Jack – Alibi Music\n\nMy Turn My Time – Diunna Greenleaf\n\nSleep On It – The Dip\n\nBack In Love Again – Liz Mandville Greeson (Back In Love Again – 2022)\n\nMellow Moment\n\nDays Like This – Dermot Kennedy\n\nNothing But A Thing\n\nNothing But A Thing – Dave Isaacs\n\nShaboogie – Ben Sidran\n\nHoney Honey – Geraint Watkins\n\nHonky Tonk Women – Simon Crashly & The Roadmasters\n\nDefinitely deserving a place among the ‘good stuff’ for this week’s sonic tonic, was the ‘newie’ from Liz Mandville Greeson . . . it was the title track of her new album ‘ Back In Love Again’ and whether or not that generated even a flicker of romance, then it seemed a very good time for our Mellow Moment, where I came to soothe you, smooth you and help you relax. Aiding and abetting me in that task this week was Dermot Kennedy with another Van Morrison number for the playlist . . . ‘Days Like This’ . . . and I mentioned that if there happened to be someone special nearby, then you had my permission to smooch.\n\nMeanwhile, here with a tip of the hat in the direction of New Orleans from one of the names on this week’s giglist . . . Geraint Watkins. He may have been given much encouragement by yours truly and possible, one or two others. Then, there was the sobering sideways glance at the studio clock which brought the unwelcome news that I was about to make my last choice for our sonic tonic. This heralded the welcome return of Simon Crashly & The Roadmasters . . . but before I let them loose, there was a big thanks for your good company for this week’s show and I hope we’ll meet again soon for another dose of Doctor Roberts Sonic Tonic. Until then . . . remember . . . have fun!\n\nBroadcast by Miskin Radio on 18 March 2022\n\nListen here to this week’s edition of The Blues Come Calling:\n\nWell, whether you arrived by accident or design, there was a big bluesy welcome to one and all and a bundle of some of the best blues around. But, any of those who might have turned up late, would have missed the most excellent Hurricane Ruth with a track from her new album ‘Live at Third & Lindsley’. My choice was a song she wrote for her mother Norma Jean . . . . ‘Dance Dance Norma Jean’ . . . and I hope she did!\n\nFor those who like their blues with swing, I followed up with the ‘newie’ from Big Daddy, which I predicted would bring a smile and good deal of foot tapping, once you heard . . . ‘Left Me With The Blues’.\n\nThere have been some early teasers from Larry McCray’s new album ‘Blues Without You’ and it was this week’s ‘album of the week’ with plenty of gems to choose from, including my first choice, featuring Joanna Connor . . . ‘Drinkin’ Liquor And Chasin’ Women’.\n\nLeft With The Blues\n\nDance Dance Norma Jean – Hurricane Ruth (Live at Third & Lindsley – 2022)\n\nLeft Me With The Blues – Bad Daddy (It’s A Mad Mad Bad Dad World – 2022)\n\nLive With Yourself – Trudy Lynn (Golden Girl -2022)\n\nEverything Is Broken – David Lumsden (Rooted In The Blues – 2022)\n\nNo Where To Go – Duke Robillard & John Hammond (They Called It Rhythm & Blues – 2022)\n\nDrinkin’ Liquor And Chasin’ Women feat. Joanna Connor – Larry McCray (Blues Without You – 2022)\n\nStop Breaking Down – Blue Touch (The Music Of Robert Johnson – 2022)\n\nPinetop’s Pick\n\nWorried Life Blues – The Animals (Animal Tracks – 1965)\n\nRockin’ The House\n\nRocking & Rolling This House – Kenny ‘Blues Boss’ Wayne (Blues From Chicago To Paris – 2022)\n\nGood Die Young – Larry McCray (Blues Without You – 2022)\n\nJohnny And Me – Liz Mandeville Greeson (Back In Love Again – 2022)\n\nBlues Without You (For Paul) – Larry McCray (Blues Without You – 2022)\n\nJust The Way It Is – Geminii Dragon (Just The Way It Is – 2022)\n\nNow, last week I promised that Kenny ‘Blues Boss’ Wayne would be back, and he was . . . with another of his tributes to the legendary Memphis Slim and delivering it with some spicy boogie piano and soulful vocals. This week, my choice was Kenny’s great version of a number that Memphis Slim recorded in Chicago in October 1946 . . . . ‘Rockin’ The House’.\n\nThere was a warm welcome too for Liz Mandeville Greeson, who along with her band the Supernaturals have a reputation as high voltage performers across America and Canada. This has given Liz an opportunity to work with a veritable Who’s Who of contemporary blues artists and those influences are evident on Liz’s latest album ‘Back In Love Again’ . . . where you’ll find my choice ‘Johnny & Me’.\n\nOur blues time together was fast running out, when it was time to say a big thanks for listening and play out with Geminii Dragon’s ‘Just The Way It Is’. So, until the next time The Blues Come Calling . . . remember . . . have fun!\n\nBroadcast by Miskin Radio on 17 March 2022\n\nBroadcast by Blues at Rock Radio on19 March 2022\n\nBroadcast by Blues at Rock Radio on 20 March 2022\n\nListen here to this week’s show:\n\nWell, around the Grand Duchy this week, the social activities seem to have hit a high, with plenty of friendly faces to share the rare moments. The weather may have been unpredictable, but nothing to discourage us from winding the windows down on the Cruise Mobile and turning up the volume. Amongst the surprises of the week was realising that we were fast approaching our 12th year of Cruising with The Commissioner. So, if you’ve got any suggestions for our anniversary playlist, or anecdotes to share, do get in touch.\n\nThere was some ‘real’ rocking R&B on the playlist this week and we launched our cruise with a most frantic welcome from Little Richard and yours truly and went rolling on down the road with Bob Seger and more. So, like all our cruising adventures we know where we started, but where we’ll end up you never can tell !!\n\nCome On Home\n\nHey Hey Hey Hey – Little Richard\n\nC’est La Vie – Bob Seger\n\nCome On Home – Louis ‘Blues Boy’ Jones\n\nTrickle Trickle – The Videos\n\nDownstairs – Plas Johnson\n\nFever – Patti Drew\n\nWhat’s Wrong – James ‘Sugar Boy’ Crawford\n\nI Can’t Hear You No More – Betty Everett\n\nLet Love Come Between Us – James & Bobby Purify\n\nWondrous Place – Jimmy Jones\n\nTell Me How Do You Feel – Billy Fury\n\nGirls & Guitars\n\nA Whiter Shade Of Pale – Francesca De Fazi\n\nYou Can’t Sit Down\n\nMy Boy Lollipop – Barbie Gaye\n\nMichael (The Lover) – Geno Washington & The Ram Jam Band\n\nPink Champagne – Georgie Fame & The Blue Flames\n\nYou Can’t Sit Down – The Phil Upchurch Combo\n\nShock To The System – Eli Paperboy Reed\n\nLet Me Know – Oscar McLollie & Jeanette Baker\n\nThis week our Girls & Guitars spotlight fell on Italian, Francesca De Fazi, whose style has been compared to Bonnie Raitt and Janis Joplin . . . . and we chose a track from her 2002 live album called ‘Blues Dues’ and her rather excellent take on ‘A Whiter Shade Of Pale’. There were a couple of reminders of the British 60s soul scene, with irrepressible Geno Washington & The Ram Jam Band and Georgie Fame & The Blue Flames.\n\nAs the sands of time started running out for our cruising adventure, we turned for home and completed our cruise in fine style with some high energy R&B from Eli Paperboy Reed. We managed to squeeze in a real foot tapper by Oscar McLollie & Jeanette Baker and their 1958 Class recording ‘Let Me Know’. Then, before we knew it, we were home safe and sound from our cruise and already thinking about how to pass the next seven days before we can do it again. So, if you’ll be there, we’ll be here, with a seat saved especially for you in the Cruise Mobile. Just so we can all go Cruising with The Commissioner . . . until then . . . . have fun!\n\nBroadcast by Miskin Radio on 15 March 2022\n\nListen here to this week’s edition of Doctor Roberts Sonic Tonic:\n\nWell, you would have been surprised if there wasn’t a big cheery welcome to one and all to open our Sonic Tonic . . . . so no surprises there. With the weekend peeking round the corner I came ready and willing to make sure you were tuned up and tuned in to this week’s bumper dose of Doctor Roberts Sonic Tonic. It came dripping with plenty of the ‘good stuff’ to make your smile a little brighter and your mood a little lighter . . . and it kicked off with Adam Norsworthy doing just that with a track from his latest album called ‘You’re My Song’. Then, barely concealing my thinly veiled enthusiasm for the upcoming album by Sugaray Rayford, I brought you a rather aptly titled number ‘Gonna Lift You Up’.\n\nNow, this weeks Tell It Like It Is was inspired by a memory that this week, back 2003 I was at London’s Shepherd’s Bush Empire for a concert by Texas band, the Dixie Chicks. Now, apart from a superb stage show by the band, the evening became even more memorable when lead singer Natalie Maines announced that the band was “ashamed the President of the United States was from Texas” and President Bush’s actions in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. The comment got little reaction in the UK, but it sparked intense controversy among Americans, including a large share of country music fans. But, the band weathered the storm and rightly too, in my humble opinion, but in their own words . . . ‘Some Days You Just Gotta Dance’.\n\nThe Feeling Is Right\n\nYou’re My Song – Adam Norsworthy\n\nGonna Lift You Up – Sugaray Rayford\n\nThe Feeling Is Right – Anders Lewen & James KIng\n\nOver My Shoulder – Giuliano Palma & The Bluebeaters\n\nYou Make Me Look Good – Paul Carrack\n\nTell It Like It Is\n\nSome Days You Gotta Dance – The Dixie Chicks\n\nCome Back\n\nCome Back – Trombone Shorty\n\nLove’s Got A Hold – Kate Lush\n\nNo Way You Can Hurt Me Now – Kara Grainger\n\nUnder My Thumb – Gov’t Mule\n\nMellow Moment\n\nYou’re All I Need To Get By – Blame Jones\n\nToo Tight To Mention\n\nSame Blood Same Bone – Vaneese Thomas\n\nMoney’s Too Tight To Mention – The Valentine Brothers\n\nAin’t No Lady – Sister Suzie\n\nI Don’t Wanna Be In Love – Geraint Watkins & The Dominators\n\nChicken & The Bop – Lloyd Price\n\nWell, it was a busy week for my giglist and I couldn’t leave without adding a little rocking flavour to our Sonic Tonic from Sister Suzie, who can rock your socks off if you catch her live on stage as I did. There was another another name that I’m hoping to catch on stage in the days ahead . . . Geraint Watkins . . . so I had a little rummage in the music library for one of his, along with his band, The Dominators.\n\nWay too soon, our time together was nearly all gone, so the last choice for this week’s Sonic Tonic came with a memory of the great Lloyd Price, who, if he was still with us, would have been celebrating his birthday this week. So, I played out with Mr Price in fine rocking mood on ‘The Chicken & The Bop’ . . . but not before saying a big thanks for your good company here and very much hoping that we’ll meet again soon for another dose of Doctor Roberts Sonic Tonic. Until then . . . remember . . have fun!\n\nBroadcast by Miskin Radio on 11 March 2022\n\nListen here to this week’s edition of The Blues Come Calling:\n\nAs ever, there was a big bluesy welcome to one and all, along with a playlist positively overflowing with some of the best blues around. So, with breathless enthusiasm I kicked off with something straight out of the box marked ‘album of the week’ . . . it was the new release from Mike Guldin and the first choice was the title track of the album . . . ‘Tumblin’ . . . with more later, but not before a taster from blues-rock band Ghost Hounds with their up-tempo, bumpy grinder . . . “Baby We’re Through.”\n\nThis week we took another listen to Steve Bailey’s tribute album to Sonny Boy Williamson II, which has MIssissippi MacDonald providing some first class support and one of the joys of the past week was catching Mississippi MacDonald and his band delivering an impeccable night of blues, on stage. During his gig, Mr MacDonald gave a most respectful tip of the hat to bluesman Little Milton and it was a fine example which I was happy to follow with ‘Gonna Find Me Someone To Love’.\n\nTumblin’\n\nTumblin’ – Mike Guldin (Tumblin’ – 2022)\n\nBaby We’re Through – Ghost Hounds (Baby We’re Through – 2022)\n\nStop Right Now – Steve Bailey & Mississippi MacDonald (Crazy ‘Bout You Baby – 2022)\n\nGonna Find Me Someone To Love – Little Milton (Think Of Me – 2005)\n\nHow Can You Do It – Henry Gray (Shake A Hand – 2022)\n\nTurn Your Love Around – Adam Norsworthy (Infinite Hotel – 2022)\n\nKey To The Highway – Mike Guldin (Tumblin’ – 2022)\n\nPinetop’s Pick\n\nCry To Me – Norman Beaker Band (Into The Blues – 2014)\n\nJust Playin’\n\nSomebody Tell That Woman – Kenny Blues Boss Wayne (Chicago To Paris – 2022)\n\nLittle Pack Of Lies – Kara Grainger (Shiver & Sigh – 2013)\n\nBreaking News – Larry McCray (Blues Without You – 2022)\n\nJackson – Kate Lush (Thredbo Blues – 2022)\n\nThat’s All She Wrote – Mike Guldin (Tumblin’ – 2022)\n\nJust Playin’ – Mick Pini (Pastoral – 2022)\n\nKara Grainger is heading this way on tour later in the year and she’s already on my giglist and, who knows, ‘Little Pack Of Lies’ might on her setlist. Meanwhile, the news of a new album from Larry McCray, is bound to bring plenty of excitement, especially as this one is produced by Joe Bonamassa . . . so it’s sure to be a stunner. The album’s called ‘Blues Without You’ and ‘Breaking News’ is the second of the tracks being released as very worthy teasers.\n\nAs Mike Guldin came along with the last of my choices from my album of the week, it signalled our blues time running out. So, we headed for home with Mick Pini ‘Just Playing’, but first there was a big thanks for you good company and the hope that we’ll meet again the next time The Blues Come Calling. Until then . . . remember . . . . have fun!\n\nBroadcast by Miskin Radio on 10 March 2022\n\nBroadcast by Blues at Rock Radio on12 March 2022\n\nBroadcast by Blues at Rock Radio on13 March 2022"
