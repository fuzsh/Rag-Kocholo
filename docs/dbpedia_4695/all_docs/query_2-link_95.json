In his new position, Heisner will oversee the marketing, branding and sales for all current product lines. He will manage the sales and marketing departments at the company and will report directly to co-founder and CEO Jerry Lee.\n\n“Craig’s appointment underscores Newton Running’s commitment to continually creating and marketing products that improve the sport of running,” said Jerry Lee, Cofounder and CEO of Newton Running. “His proven success in the development and marketing of iconic athletic brands made him the perfect candidate to oversee the expansion of our current categories as well as contribute to future innovations.”\n\nHeisner brings more than 20 years of marketing and sales experience from working with leading athletic footwear and apparel brands, including New Balance, Reebok, and Brooks Sports. He most recently served as vice president of marketing, sales and product merchandising at Li-Ning, where he led the Chinese company’s introduction into the U.S. market.\n\n“Newton Running’s leadership in the field, along with its unique combination of state-of-the-art proprietary technology and strong brand identity rooted in social responsibility, positions the company to become a lasting athletic brand,” said Heisner. “I have admired the brand since its launch and look forward to being a part of the company’s continued success.”\n\nHeisner holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Economics from the University of New Hampshire, and an M.B.A from the Graduate School of Business at Northeastern University."
