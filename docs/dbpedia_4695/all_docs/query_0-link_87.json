        "text": "NEWTON, Iowa (KCCI) - National layoffs at John Deere are having a trickle-down effect as a manufacturing company has announced it plans to close its facility in Newton, laying off all its employees.\n\nThat announcement is likely tied to its relationship with John Deere, which has laid off thousands of workers across several states in recent months.\n\nAs Newton Economic Development Corporation Executive Director Frank Liebl says, the shutdown wasn’t that big of a shock considering one of the company’s primary partnerships is with Deere.\n\nLiebl says the Gates Corporation has been a John Deere supplier since the business first game to Newton in 2017.\n\nNow, according to the Iowa Workforce Development’s WARN Notification List, Gates has notified 41 of its Newton workers that they will be getting laid off.\n\n“When things happen, when you just your client, your customer stops ordering, you probably don’t have a choice,” Liebl said.\n\nHe said for those that are left jobless, the city will work hard to find them new positions.\n\n“We’ll do what we can to assist those that are employed, and will reach out to us and try to work with them the best way we can,” Liebl said.\n\nHe said every business comes with its own highs and lows, and while it’s difficult to know exactly what’s coming for John Deere, he sees a brighter future ahead.\n\n“John Deere obviously depends on the farm economy,” he said. “If prices improve, and costs come down, I think things will bounce back.”\n\nAccording to the posting, all the workers will be officially laid off in November.\n\nJohn Deere and Gates Corporation have not responded to requests for comment about the layoffs."
