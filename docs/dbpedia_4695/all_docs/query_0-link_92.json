        "text": "The Basics\n\nGender: Men’s | See Women’s\n\nType: Road\n\nManufacturer: Newton\n\nPrice: 175.00\n\nBuy it Here\n\nRunner’s World Review\n\nThe Gravity is Newton’s high-mileage trainer, with five lugs under the foot that deliver a highly responsive ride and fast feel. It’s also historically had plenty of cushioning in both the heel and forefoot. The newest model gets even softer, thanks to a new bouncy foam that sits close to the foot. Testers appreciated the extra padding, but also liked the upper fit.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAll the Stats You Need!\n\nWeight: Light | 9.4 oz\n\nHeel-To-Toe-Drop: Low | 6.4 mm\n\nHeel Height: Moderate | 33.2 mm\n\nHeel Cushioning: Soft\n\nForefoot Height: Very High | 26.8 mm\n\nForefoot Cushioning: Moderate\n\nFlexibility: Moderate\n\nStability Features: Few\n\nEnergy Return: More\n\nWe put each shoe through real-world usage and a battery of mechanical tests in our lab to provide you with objective — and exclusive — data. In addition to a shoe's weight, we measure sole thickness (everything that sits between your foot and the road), how well the foam cushions your stride, and the flexibility of the forefoot. All this is taken into account in our reviews of each shoe."
