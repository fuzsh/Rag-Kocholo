        "text": "Newton Running of Boulder announced Thursday that it will distribute its leading running shoe models through Dick’s Sporting Goods in select stores and online at dicks.com starting in May.\n\nAs part of the new partnership, Newton Running also will have a presence at this weekend’s Dick’s Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon, showcasing the Newton brand to more than 30,000 runners.\n\nNewton has historically maintained exclusive retail and online sales channels; however, the brand sees its partnership with Dick’s Sporting Goods as a way to expand its presence in the running shoe market, grow its customer base and increase brand awareness.\n\n“We are confident that our presence in Dick’s Sporting Goods stores will create more of an opportunity for runners to feel Newton Running, which will lead to broader awareness and increase sales among all of our retailers,” Jerry Lee, CEO and co-founder of Newton Running, said in a press release. “We are excited to partner with a great company to offer more shoes to more people.”\n\nFive of Newton’s shoe models — the Gravity IV, Motion IV, Fate, Kismet and Aha — will be available at Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in the east, south central and midwest United States.\n\nAlso beginning in May, Newton Running shoes will be available via the DICK’S locations at Flatiron Crossing and Park Meadows.\n\nNewton Running launched in Boulder in 2007. Pittsburgh-based Dick’s Sporting Goods has more than 600 stores across the U.S."
