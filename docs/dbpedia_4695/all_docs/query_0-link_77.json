        "text": "The Newton Fate II’s are by far the best shoes I have tested under Newton. I feel like every time I have the opportunity to test Newton’s, I fall in love with them more and more, but the Fate II’s have sealed the deal for me.\n\nThese shoes are the perfect balance of lightweight, minimal, and supportive. The Fate II’s offer an incredibly comfortable fit, while also providing adequate support and grip through rough terrain.\n\nNewton Fate II General Info\n\nThe Newton Fate II is a fairly new model within Newton’s line of trainers. The Fate II’s are one of Newton’s mid-level shoe when it comes to cost, but are nothing short of a top competitor when it comes to the trainer market.\n\nWhen comparing the Fate II’s to other Newton models, such as the Distance and the Motion’s, I feel that the Fate II stacks up very well when taking into consideration the technical features, and, personally, was much more practical and smooth.\n\nI knew I was going to appreciate these shoes as soon as I opened the box. As is typical with Newton, they were sleek and flashy, but when I first slipped my foot into the shoe, I knew they were the shoe for me. The inside was a slightly tighter fit than previous models, but felt more form-fitting as well.\n\nNewton Fate II Sole Unit\n\nThe Newton Fate II’s inner-sole is lined with a soft material, but provides less cushioning than many other models such as the Distance, Motions, and many of their trail shoes. The inside of the shoe helps accommodate the shape of your foot and allows for a nice stretch during those hard runs.\n\nThe lugs, which Newton focuses heavily on, are much less pronounced than in many other models, and allow runners who are just transitioning into Newton’s to get a feel for them without feeling like there is a block strapped to your mid-foot.\n\nIf you’re looking for an ultra-cushion shoe, the Fate II is not for you, but if you want a shoe that will introduce you to Newton’s lug-technology and allow you to feel every step in a comfortable but strong manner, then look no further.\n\nMy calves certainly notice the difference as opposed to runs in my Gravity V‘s, but I’ve never felt stronger and more in control than in my Fate II’s.\n\nNewton Fate II Upper Info\n\nPreviously, I have had issues with Newton’s upper tongue material causing rubbing pains during long-runs, but it seems they have taken notice of this issue.\n\nThe Fate II’s are lined with a comfortable inner-material, which are able to keep your feet dry but is also breathable. The upper is a slightly tighter fit than other models, but personally, it fit me better than other models as well.\n\nI have run some very technical trails here in Montana, and I’ve never had an issue with my shoe or heel slipping.\n\nNewton Fate II Conclusions\n\nIf you haven’t already gotten the message yet, I love these shoes. The Newton Fate II’s are certainly my favorite pair of Newton’s yet, providing the perfect balance of lightweight trainer combined with stable and form-fitting features.\n\nI am currently training for the Rut 50k, a brutal 31-mile race with 11,000 feet of elevation gain, and I think the Fate II’s will be my shoe of choice for this race next year.\n\nIt can withstand the unstable ground and wear and tear, and will also stay true to it’s fit and comfort. If you want a reliable pair of shoes that will strengthen and guide your gait, look no further. As Newton said, these shoes are no mistake, they’re fate."
