        "text": "When Jerry Lee was a kid growing up in a family of 15 (yes, that’s correct) in the small town of Aledo, outside of Rock Island, Ill., there was not much to go around. Everything had to be reused, patched up, and handed down; shoes, shirts and baseball gloves were all shared. (Jerry, as the eldest, did get to wear the rare pair of new blue jeans before passing them along to his siblings). As Lee, the owner and founder of Newton Running, said when I stopped by Newton headquarters just off Pearl Parkway last week, “We were extremely frugal.”\n\nAlso extremely diligent and hard-working. After leaving his close-knit family and moving to Boulder in 1980 to work for real estate developer Bill Reynolds, Lee found himself drawn to the health and wellness culture percolating here that included recycling, reusing and taking care of the environment as well as taking care of oneself.\n\n“There was a little race called the Bolder Boulder,” Lee recalled. With encouragement from his two children, Wendy and Matt, Lee quit smoking — “it was part of the culture in the Midwest” — and started out on the Jeff Galloway walk-and-run training program. He began by running one block at a time. Soon, like many of us, he was hooked; he had embraced the Boulder lifestyle.\n\nLee has gone on to complete 15 marathons and three full Ironman Triathlons while recovering from prostate surgery. Along the way, he started Newton Running in 2007, based on a design from inventor Danny Abshire. The Boulder-based company was one of the first to make shoes influenced by the “natural running” movement. Newton quickly made a splash, becoming known for its brightly colored, light shoes that can help runners lean into a more efficient running form.\n\nAll of Newton Running’s shoes are “vegan,” manufactured without animal products, said Wendy Lee, Newton’s director of social responsibility. This means no leathers, suedes or animal byproduct adhesives. In 2020, Newton took its commitment to sustainability a step further by making a “biodegradable shoe.”\n\nThe uppers are composed of recycled plastic bottles while the midsoles are transitioning to being built from sugar cane and other plant-based products such as algae. Folks are taking notice, including organizers of the 64th annual Grammy Awards, held on April 3, who reached out to Newton asking whether the company could send shoes to the roughly 300 Grammy Award presenter and performers.\n\n“The Grammy response was overwhelmingly positive,” Laura Tingle, Newton’s social media and product director, wrote in an email. “The artists were initially drawn to our colors, but once they learned about our sustainability story, they were exponentially more excited to learn about Newton, what we are doing and why we do it.”\n\nAnd why Newton does it, with a cost of roughly 20% to its bottom line, is that Newton “walks the talk,” or, shall we say, ”runs the talk.” Lee, 73, said, “It does constrain our bottom line, but it is the right thing to do. We’re excited about it; when you buy a product you can think about its effect on the environment.”\n\nA 2013 study put out by MIT estimates the “carbon footprint” of a running shoe at 30 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. To further lessen its impact on the environment, Newton has partnered with a nonprofit to plant one tree for every pair of shoes sold. “Each tree will absorb 10 times the carbon it takes to make our shoes,” Wendy Lee explained.\n\n“This is what we care about,” Jerry Lee said. “We can do a lot of good if we concentrate our energy in the right direction. We are extremely excited to say that every shoe is carbon neutral.”\n\nThe Newton Running headquarters and retail shop, at 3675 Frontier Ave., showcases Lee’s commitment to sustainability and concern for the environment — it uses 100% wind-powered electricity, and employees recycle more than 90% of waste generated. Newton, Lee said, strives to be “as socially responsible and eco-friendly as we can be while being a viable business.”\n\nThis fall, just in time for the return of University of Colorado students, Newton is initiating its “Buff Shoe.” As with its other shoes, recycled plastic bottles comprise the uppers; the laces are sustainable; and the midsoles contain a product called Eco-Pure, which hastens the decomposition process. Being a proud CU alum, I had to try out a pair of the Buff shoes. I found them to be light, with plenty of cushion and perhaps, a bit of a psychological effect, as I seemed to be channeling my inner Adam Goucher and running with a bit more spring in my step.\n\nAccording to shoe tester Brian Metzler, Newton’s commitment to sustainability and the environment is part of a bigger trend in the industry. “Consumer demand is pushing for sustainability, more recycled, plant-based materials.”\n\nLee said, “It’s a trend in all the footwear companies,” adding that it is easier for Newton to “turn its ship,” than for a larger shoe company to do so.\n\nBefore leaving, I asked Lee what he thought about the changes in Boulder, easy to see just west from the Newton offices, where new buildings continue to go up, drawing in more people, attracted by the same amenities that have kept so many of us here.\n\n“I hope it doesn’t change the culture,” Lee said. “Boulder is a special place.”\n\nFollow Michael Sandrock on Instagram: @MikeSandrock"
