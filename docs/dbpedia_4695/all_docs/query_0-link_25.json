        "text": "During the month of November, Newton Running, the Boulder, Colorado-based run shoe company, will be offering giveaways for performance and safety-related gear as a part of National Runner’s Safety Month.\n\nFor a limited time, all of the brand’s women’s shoes will include a free alarm from Sabre, while supplies last. Newton is also partnering with a local Colorado karate studio, Ripple Effects Martial Arts, to provide a series of educational content as well as gift certificates for in-person self-defence training.\n\nNovember has long served as Runner’s Safety Month in the USA due to the hazards that runners may face thanks to shortened daylight hours and a return of inclement weather.\n\nWith the theme of #RUNBRIGHT, the Running Industry Association (RIA) is asking participants to create important content that aims to educate runners and provide practical, actional advice.\n\nwww.NewtonRunning.com\n\nwww.runningindustry.org"
