        "text": "Anyone here with experience of switching to Newton Running shoes? I used to run a lot, but I stupidly let life get in the way and stopped completely for a long time. Recently, I've started to ease my way back into running. I'm heavier now than when I ran marthons, and am conscious of putting too much stress on my heels, legs and hips. So, after much research Ive bought some Newton Running shoes and am following the recommended path towards running mid-foot and not landing on my heels. Any opinions/advice?\n\nI purchased a pair of Newton running shoes back in December. They were my second pair of running shoes (Brooks were my first). Comfortable, but after less than 200 miles (since December) on the shoes, using them for running only, my right shoe broke down (my foot apparently rolls to the outside) and the heel was worn down to the plastic. Although worn down a little, my Brooks completely out lasted the Newtons and I still wear the Brooks to work out. Tried a pair of Hoka's. They had great support but were too narrow and pinched the sides of my feet so had to take those back. May try to go back to Brooks again, although I tried on a pair of New Balance that were very comfortable alhtough not a lot of support. The price of the average running shoe is too high considering they say you should get a new pair every 300 miles! Wished my Newons would have lasted that long!\n\n200 miles..... given the price of Newton shoes, that equates to a 'running cost' of almost a Dollar per mile! Most reviews of Newton shoes say they outlast most other brands of running shoes, and only need to be replaced every 500-600 miles, making the net cost about the same as Nike, etc. Dissapointing to hear the opposite is true (I've had pairs of much cheaper shoes last me many 100s of miles without a noticable change in support or shock absorption).\n\nThanks for the input!\n\nNot on shoes, but on come-back with new method.\n\nStart out slower than you ever have before. Unless you used to imitate mid-foot strike in prior shoes too even if not intended for that. I did, so my transition was fast to minimalist shoes with none of the regular issues.\n\nBut I also overdid it because it felt like I was doing so well and got plantar sprain anyway. Increased pace to match cardio system ability, which was already in shape. Feet weren't that ready.\n\nI'd suggest Jog / Walk intervals as weight drops. Smaller amount of jogging increasing to more and more as weight drops closer to goal weight.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHelp the next searcher of answers, mark a reply as Solved if it was, or a thumbs up if it was a good idea too.\n\nI'm taking the transition slowly...... more slowly than I thought I could accomplish. My worry is my cardio-vascular system is way stronger than my running legs can cope with (I cycle and/or workout hard 4 or 5 times a week, every week). So, like you, my temptation is to keep running further/faster than my legs/feet are ready to handle. Sorry you had issues, but thanks for reinforcing the notion to build slowly.\n\nWell, once my prior injury of plantar fasciitis was gone, this method really made them stronger and no more issues. Still wore orthotics in non-bendable like dress shoes.\n\nBut stronger is nothing that 15-20 lbs extra and 3 x weekly 10K can't ruin when you keep going faster.\n\nIn fact, I recovered nicely in 6 weeks from the plantar sprain, really shocked considering the almost year for fasciitis issue initially.\n\nI went with Saucony Kinvara after VFF and Merril Trail Gloves. I discovered unequal leg issue and can only do full length insert in normalish running shoe. They have a 4 mm drop still, but thicker cushioning for longer runs.\n\nSketchers GoBionic are flat and less padded and almost barefoot they are so flexible, like them too for shorter runs up to 10K.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHelp the next searcher of answers, mark a reply as Solved if it was, or a thumbs up if it was a good idea too."
