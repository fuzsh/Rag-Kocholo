        "text": "It has been a minute since I ran in Newton. For those who don’t know, the Newton Gravity was one of my first running shoe ever. In fact, I almost run exclusively in Newtons until working at the running store 6 years ago. I ran the in Newton Gravity 1 and Newton Gravity 2. I believe I ran in a pair of the Newton Gravity 3, but that was the extent of it. In total, I ran in 17 pairs of Newton Gravity (I distinctly remember counting one day).\n\nI found this gem from the early days of blogging: I learned: a: I ran in a lot of Newtons. b: my photography has gotten better. (or maybe c. phone camera quality is better)\n\nAnyway, when I started working at the running store in 2014, I began running in different brands. I haven’t come back to Newton until this year. For those who don’t know, Newtons have a unique sole with “lugs.” They take some time to work into and you will have issues if you start running all of your mileage in them immediately.\n\nNewton Gravity 8 Quick Facts:\n\nHeel to Toe Drop: 3 mm\n\nWeight: 9.1 ounces\n\nWhat are the Newton Gravity Lugs?\n\nAll models of Newtons hae lugs in the forefoot. The lugs allow your body to be at a more flat heel to toe differential. If you are looking for a lower heel to toe drop, the Newton Gravity 8 has a 3 mm with the lugs.\n\nNewton Gravity 8 Fit:\n\nFirst, it would be unfair to compare the Newton Gravity 8 to the original Newton Gravity. Like most brands, the upper is much more breathable and engineered mesh uses no seam on the foot to fit your foot better. For the Newton Gravity 8, Newton introduces Adaptive Fit, engineered mesh.\n\nThe seamless upper molds to your foot for a secure ride. Newton wants the Gravity to feel “amazingly” soft, breathable and snug experience. I do appreciate the Newton Gravity 8 is wider than previous models and molds to the contours of my foot well. I typically wear between a women’s size 10-11 wide and the 10.5 fits well.\n\nNewton Gravity 8 Ride:\n\nLike any Newton Running Shoe, the Newton Gravities take time to get work into. Since the Newton Gravity has a 3 mm heel to toe drop, which puts more stress on your calves. If you have already been running in lowering heel to toe drops and minimal shoes, it should take less time to get used too. What is different when the Newton Gravity, is even though it has a minimal heel to toe drop, it has full foot cushioning. The trampoline-like cushioning system causes the foot to bounce back and lose less energy.\n\nMost people’s first impression is they feel “weird” or “different.” It’s different than the traditional foam-core running shoe. You feel the lugs under your feet and you feel them walking around. Even though I’ve run in Newton Gravities, it still felt weird to come back to them 5 years later. Weird in a good way. Take your time getting used to them. I started running 1 mile in them (then switching into another shoe) for the rest of my run to make sure my body felt good.\n\nWhen you first start running in the Newton Gravity 8, you’ll notice the lugs.\n\nWhat do the lugs do?\n\nThe lugs help promote a midfoot strike and propel you forward. All Newton Running shoes use proprietary “Action/Reaction Technology.” The movement of the lugs generates the Action/Reaction Technology. It creates a responsive ride that provides less energy loss than most traditional running shoes. Similar to an adidas running shoe but that quality and durability is much higher in Newton.\n\nNow that I’m used to them, I’e run anywhere between 1-10 miles in the Newton Gravity 8. I like how cushioned they are while still being responsive.\n\nOne issue that has always been a problem is Newtons can collect debris. I’ve gotten many rocks stuck between the lugs. I recommend sticking to the roads where the technology of the lugs can be used and less debris gets stuck between the lugs.\n\nNewton Gravity 8 Conclusion:\n\nI like the Newton Gravity 8 and it’s fun to run in a shoe that was so familiar to me for so many years. I will continue to run in them and use them more for daily runs. I think they fit best there. Finally, it’s essential to mention the Newton Gravity 8 is $175. Newton has claimed you can get more mileage out of the shoes.\n\nWhen I ran consistently in the Newton Gravity, I found I could get between 500-600 miles; when many shoes, I could only get 300-400. Every foot is different and when your body doesn’t feel good, it might be the shoes. Do I think the price of the Newton Gravity 8 is worth it? I do think if you get the full amount of mileage in them, you aren’t paying much more.\n\nCurrent Rotation:\n\nEasy/Daily Runs: Diadora Mythos Elite TRX, Hoka Bondi 6, Newton Gravity 8\n\nSpeed Work: New Balance FuelCell Rebel, Reebok Float Ride Run fast Pro, Hoka Rincon, Nike Pegasus Turbo 2\n\nLong Runs: New Balance FuelCell Rebel, Mizuno R2, Hoka Cavu 2\n\nRaces: New Balance Fuelcell 5280, Nike Next%, Reebok Run fast Pro,\n\nYou Can See All Current Shoe Reviews Here.\n\nFinally, have you subscribed to the LOLZletter? It’s a free newsletter that comes out each Monday. In the newsletter, I share running industry trends and things relevant to the sport.\n\nQuestions for you:\n\nHave you tried Newtons before? Have you tried the Newton Gravity 8?"
