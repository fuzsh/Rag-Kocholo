        "text": "Boulder-based Newton Running, a maker of specialty running shoes, is trying to pull ahead of the pack by winning a hard-to-get B Corporation certification.\n\n“We aren’t just going to talk the talk, but walk the walk,” said Jerry Lee, a Boulder real estate developer turned running shoe entrepreneur, during a ceremony Wednesday to celebrate the certification.\n\nConcepts such as corporate responsibility, community engagement, employee empowerment and environmental sustainability can prove soft and squishy. Some companies use them for a marketing advantage, until the trade-offs start squeezing the bottom line.\n\nTraditional corporations, as codified in Colorado law, must maximize profits for their shareholders. Last year, the state legislature passed a law creating public benefits corporations able to pursue other priorities without fear of being sued by their investors.\n\nCertified B Corps take it even further, with applicants graded on key areas such as governance, workers, community, environment and business model. The rigorous process can take months to pass.\n\n“It redefines what it means to be a successful company,” said Kim Coupounas, a co-founder of Boulder outdoor-gear maker GoLite and the Colorado director for B Lab, the nonprofit that oversees the certification.\n\nCoupounas said one misconception is that certified B Corps are nonprofits or charitable efforts, but that isn’t so. The twist is that by balancing multiple objectives against profits, many certified B Corps actually end up making more money than they might have otherwise.\n\n“It opened doors for us,” said Mark Fischer, CEO of Inspire Commerce, a Boulder electronic payment firm and certified B Corp since 2008.\n\nAt Namaste Solar, certification helps boost worker loyalty at the employee-owned cooperative, said Jason Brown, manager of information technology.\n\nNewton Running, started in 2007, is the first dedicated running shoe maker to certify as a B Corp. The startup built its brand on word of mouth among runners willing to pay $100 to $200 or more for a pair of its brightly colored shoes.\n\nNewton customers, called the tribe, are very loyal and are the type to care that a company they buy from is looking at concerns beyond the bottom line, Lee said.\n\nHe also sees an advantage in certification when it comes to recruiting and retaining workers in their 20s — the millennial generation, which has shown a greater concern that an employer’s values align with their own.\n\nAlthough the B Corp movement is growing, it remains small. About 1,116 companies are certified in 35 countries. The movement has a strong representation in Boulder, home to 23 of the state’s 45 certified B Corps.\n\nCompanies must score 80 on a 200-point scale and are audited every two years, with the criteria getting tougher each time. It took Newton Running eight months to obtain its certification, and the company turned to a group of eight business students at the University of Colorado for help.\n\nLee said the certification helped codify many practices the company, active in philanthropy, already had in place. But it also showed where the company could do more, including environmentally.\n\n“We thought we were cool, but this made us a better company,” Lee said. “We want to be as close to the tip of the arrow as we can be.”\n\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/aldosvaldi\n\nB Corporation\n\nThe B stands for “benefit” and signifies the company has primary objectives beyond profits. To become a certified B Corporation, an applicant must meet stringent guidelines in five areas: governance, employees, community, environment and business model. There are 1,116 certified B Corps in 35 countries, including 45 in Colorado. Some of the better-known brands are Ben & Jerry’s and Patagonia and, in Colorado, New Belgium Brewing and GoLite."
