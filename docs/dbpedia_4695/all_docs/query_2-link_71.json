        "text": "One of the most beautiful aspects of running is that it doesn’t require a ton of gear. With some athletic apparel and a good pair of shoes, anyone can head out for a run – anytime, anywhere. Though runners can choose to deck themselves out with the latest gadgets and gear, the heart of a solid run experience is in the shoes. Finding the just right shoes with the just right features for your feet can be a “trial and error” process, leading to wear-testing several models before settling on the perfect pair.\n\nLucky for us, Newton Running just launched a 60 Days of Better campaign encouraging runners to experience how their shoes can help you achieve your best running motion. Based on the principles of natural running, Newton shoes are built on a near level-to-the-ground platform that supports an organic position while providing lightweight comfort to encourage a fast, quick cadence.\n\nStuart Johnson, VP of marketing for Newton Running, says, “Our goal is to reach a broader running audience with the message that if you give Newton Running shoes a try, you’ll experience the joy of better running.” Customers purchasing Newton Running shoes from any of its 450 retailers in the U.S. and Canada between September 1 and October 31, 2012, have up to 60 days from the date of purchase to return the shoes if they are not completely satisfied."
