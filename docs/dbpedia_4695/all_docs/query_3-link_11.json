        "text": "RUNNING SHOE SUMMARY\n\nDavid: The Newton Gravity+ is performance trainer that has quite a bit of responsiveness for a recyclable shoe. The ride is a little on the firmer end but still provides good protection throughout the miles. The pacing ability is pretty versatile and can run both slow and fast. The lower drop ratio and ART forefoot lugs does do great with creating a fast feel throughout the shoe, but those sensitive to using the calves may need to work on strengthening or gradually breaking in the shoe.\n\nAndrea: The Newton Gravity+ is responsive, low drop shoe that can be used for easy miles and intervals. Newton makes one of the best fitting uppers on the market, and the Gravity+ is no exception. The forefoot lugs reward you for picking up the pace with a lively, slightly propulsive feel. Due to the low drop (made even lower feeling due to the forefoot lugs), this shoe rides like a zero drop shoe. Runners with limited calf strength or ankle range of motion should be cautious when trying the Gravity+.\n\nFIT\n\nDavid: Newton always produces great uppers and the Gravity+ is no different. The upper is a 100% polyester mesh material that lies very comfortable on the foot throughout. The width in the heel and midfoot are normal with the forefoot being normal to slightly wide. The tongue is moderately padded but does a good job of providing enough cushion for lockdown. There is a lightly padded heel counter that hasn't provided irritation. In a lot of ways it is a pretty simple upper, but one that works really well.\n\nAndrea: The Gravity+ continues Newton's excellence in uppers. Newton recommends going up a 1/2 size and sent me a women's size 10, which I found to fit like my usual 9.5. The shoe provides enough room in the toe box for mild toe splay without allowing for any foot translation. The width in the heel and midfoot is normal and fit very comfortably for me. The mesh upper is lightweight, breathable, and provides ample lockdown without any hot spots or irritation. There is a semi-rigid heel counter that wraps around the calcaneus on both sides. The heel collar has light padding and I found the fit of the heel to be comfortable and unobtrusive. The tongue is on the thinner side and is lightly padded. It is partially gusseted with elastic strips attaching the tongue to the shoe upper. There is also a lace loop on the tongue which also helps hold it securely in place. I did not have any issues with irritation or movement of the tongue while I was running. Overall, I was extremely pleased with the fit and comfort of the Gravity+.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nDavid: The Gravity Plus is a really fun shoe to run in. The foam is the EVA EcoPure that they have produced from recyclable materials. This does run a little on the firmer side but does get a little softened up with the Duponts Hytrel foam strobel. The Action-Reaction technology on the shoe is pretty well-integrated and does give you a really quick rolling transition through the toe off phase of the gait cycle. The heel is balanced pretty well and transitions smoother than some other Newtons I have had in the past. The geometry is still a little on the aggressive side and feels somewhat similar to a track spike on the road. With that said the shoe does feel really fun when picking up the pace. The heel and midfoot transition could probably be a tiny bit smoother but does really well with the turnover starts to pick up a little bit. I have done up to 14 miles okay in this shoe, though I have trained up to it. This is a nice performance trainer for workouts. Even though the lugs in the forefoot are present, there is still some mild flexibility to the forefoot and feels somewhat natural. For me this is a nice shoe to workout in or do some moderate to longer uptempo efforts.\n\nAndrea: I was excited to receive the Gravity+ because I really enjoyed testing the previous model in 2021. I found this year's model to be a little more forgiving as compared to last year's, which appears to be due to the new Hytrel footbed. The Gravity+ is unique in a performance shoe in that it is also comfortable at easy paces. It can be used for a full workout, including warmup and cooldown. That being said, it does run like a zero drop shoe and those not accustomed to such a shoe should ease into running in the Gravity+. At easy paces, the lugs are noticeable but not in the way. I would not choose this shoe for a long easy run, but it is perfectly comfortable for a 60-90 minute interval workout. At faster paces, the lugs give a rolling and mild propulsive sensation, which is most noticeable for me below 5k pace. There is a flex groove towards the end of the forefoot (positioned after the lugs) that give the forefoot some needed flexibility. The lugs help roll you into the flex groove, which then assists with push off.\n\nTraction in the Gravity+ is okay, but I definitely noticed a little slippage when running on wet roads. The outsole material, particularly on the lugs, does not appear to provide much grip. I have 30 miles on my pair and there is minimal wear on the outsole, so I would expect greater than average durability.\n\nSTABILITY\n\nDavid: The forefoot stability in the Gravity+ is really good. There is enough rigidity with the lugs and sole flaring that you really feel solid in that region. The rest of the shoe certainly runs neutral. The platform is normal width in the heel and midfoot and the upper provides a nice but comfortable lockdown. Overall the shoe runs decently stable, but there still is a little medial translation in the foot through the midfoot. For those that need a little more stability may want to look into the Motion + model. The stability throughout is pretty good for a neutral model though. Traction is also done decently well for some off road conditions.\n\nAndrea: This is a neutral, low drop shoe that feels like a zero drop shoe. That being said, the Gravity+ feels balanced in terms of stability due the stiffness of the XPS+ plate and lugs in addition to the secure fit of the upper. The medial and lateral sole flare in the rearfoot and forefoot as well as a wider overall platform in the forefoot also help provide mild stability throughout stance phase. I am also currently testing the Newton Fate 8, which has a significantly more flexible midsole and feels a little less stable due to this feature. Overall, the Gravity+ provides mild guidance which is more noticeable at faster paces.\n\nTHOUGHTS AS A DPT / FOOTWEAR SCIENCE\n\nTowards a Recycled Future\n\nBy David Salas\n\nIn the running industry we are currently seeing big push towards recycling materials. Newton has made some large efforts to accomplish this task as well with recycled polyester, EVA, and rubber in the outsoles. The process can be a little costly upfront but can actually have some material benefits. Guo et al. (2019) found that if you recycle an EVA based material with an EVA vitrimer (triethyl borate with a catalyst) you may experience improvements in mechanical properties. Guo et al (2019) found that the cross linking described above showed greater thermal stability and storage than the normal thermoplastic EVA. More research needs to be done but this is a good example of showing that although something may be recycled, it doesn't necessarily mean the performance or mechanical properties of the material will be lessened in performance.\n\nReferences:\n\nGuo, H., Yue, L, Rui, G., & Manas-Zloczower, I. (2019). Recycling Poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate) with improved properties through dynamic cross linking. Macromolecules. A-G.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nDavid: The Newton Gravity+ stepped it up again from last year. I really enjoyed this model and feel the new strobel did help soften things a little, though I do think the transition through the midfoot could still be cleaned up. I think either the heel could be rounded a tad more or the drop just ever so slightly raised to clean up the transition point and make the lugs feel a tad less aggressive on a training shoe. Overall, a good shoe though.\n\nAndrea: I agree with David that this year's Gravity+ is an improvement on the previous model due to the improved Hytrel footbed. This is a great shoe for intervals, but I also agree that slight modifications to the lugs could make the shoe feel smoother at slower paces. Overall, this is one of my favorite workout shoes and I am particularly pleased with the well-fitting and breathable upper.\n\nWHO THIS SHOE IS FOR\n\nDavid: The Newton Gravity+ is a performance trainer for a runner looking to have a lot of versatility in potential speed and likes having a slightly more aggressive track like ride. The drop ratio is on the lower end and the lugs essentially make the platform level. This makes having calf strength and stability important when running in these. The ride, however, feels very quick and is still pretty smooth at all speeds.\n\nAndrea: The Newton Gravity+ is ideal as a performance trainer for runners accustomed to low drop shoes. Runners who prefer a more responsive interval shoe will like the firmer feel of the Gravity+. If you are looking for a shoe that can handle warmup, cooldown and intervals, this is a great option.\n\nGRADING\n\nDavid\n\nFit: A- (Incredibly comfortable, though a little bit of room medially through the midfoot)\n\nPerformance: B+/A- (Very fast and quick transitions, great responsiveness for material base, though still a tad abrupt transitioning from the midfoot into the forefoot. Might be a little firm and aggressive for some, but otherwise great.)Stability: A- (Great forefoot stability, though a little translation medially through the midfoot)DPT/Footwear Science: B+ (A good job of integrating recyclable materials into a performance shoe, though transitions can still be smoothened out)Personal: B+/A-(A really fun shoe for long workouts or uptempo efforts, still a tad on the firmer end)Overall: B+/A- (A fun performance trainer with quick transitions and a responsive ride using recyclable materials)\n\nAndrea\n\nFit: A (remember to go up 1/2 size for a great fitting upper that allows for toe splay and superior lockdown)\n\nPerformance: A- (feels best at paces faster than 5k pace. Can be used for slower paces but lugs are noticeable.)Stability: A- (stiffer sole, sole flare, and lugs provide nice guidance without any true stability features)DPT/Footwear Science: A- (Newton is doing great work using recycled materials for its shoes without sacrificing performance)Personal: A- (love the shoe for faster intervals, but would like to see lugs refined)Overall: A- (great fitting performance shoe with recycled materials and responsive ride)\n\nSHOP | SUPPORT DOR\n\nPrice: $190 at Newton Running\n\nShop Men | Shop Women\n\n*Using the link to purchase helps support Doctors of Running.
