        "text": "I used to say that using technology like “actuator lugs” to promote a neutral, natural foot strike was ironic and totally unnecessary.\n\nOf course, I’m talking about Newton running shoes which have a very distinctive sole:\n\nI refused to wear them because of those wacky lugs and thought they weren’t for “real” runners. But then I thought I should test my assumptions about such a unique shoe and Newton was gracious enough to supply a pair for me to review.\n\nAnd tested they were!\n\nYou see, Newtons all have these lugs on the forefoot that put you in a more neutral position because the heel-toe drop differential is reduced – you’re not standing with an elevated heel like many other shoes on the market. I thought the lugs seemed silly before I ran in them. Now, I’m a fan of the Newton Gravity’s I’ve worn for the last three weeks.\n\nNewton Gravity Running Shoe – Specs and Overview\n\nI wear a size 10 shoe and wore the Gravity’s almost exclusively for three weeks. Admittedly, this was a quick transition to a shoe that claims it promotes a more “natural” running form. Usually, that phrase simply means that the shoes promote a midfoot strike and reduce heel striking (even though heel striking isn’t necessarily bad).\n\nSo, why can I make this transition much more quickly than most runners? I had just spent three months running in neutral shoes, wearing flip flops the rest of the time, and I did a lot of barefoot walking.\n\nDuring the last four weeks I’ve also run once a week in even more minimalist shoes (currently the Brooks PureFlows).\n\nIf you’re looking to run in more low-profile shoes, here’s my step-by-step post on how to run in minimalist running shoes.\n\nAnyway, here are the most important Newton Gravity specs:\n\n3mm heel-toe drop\n\n9.1 ounces\n\nAnti-microbial sockliner (I still have no problems with smell – just sniffed!)\n\nMy first impression was that they felt weird. I wasn’t used to the lugs underneath my forefoot and walking in them was odd. But I ran a tempo during a 14 miler for my first run in them and they felt really good – much different than when walking.\n\nOther than a bit of lower leg soreness afterward, which was to be expected, I liked the feel of the Gravity’s. They’re not a very low-profile shoe and have a significantly raised footbed but I personally prefer a little more cushion. After a few days I got used to the low heel-toe drop and kept running in them 5-6 days per week.\n\nYou’ll definitely notice the actuator lugs while running but I quickly adapted and they don’t feel awkward anymore. In fact, I like that they promote a midfoot strike while offering some cushion (typically a rare combination). For me, they work.\n\nI’ve since worn them on 21 mile long runs with three miles on the back half in under six minutes. I had no problems and appreciated the “Action/Reaction” material in the sole that claims to lose less energy than EVA foam, gel, or air. It felt responsive and when I’m feeling good, I can really cruise in the Gravity’s!\n\nOne of the small details that I really appreciated was an insert in the shoebox that I took a picture of and included above. There’s some great advice about running form that you don’t get from most of the other major shoe manufacturers.\n\nThe best piece of advice: don’t run on your toes. Unless you’re sprinting, an aggressive forefoot strike is probably worse than an aggressive heel strike!\n\nPros and Cons of the Newton Gravity\n\nNo shoe is perfect and I want to be clear that while I really liked the Gravity’s, I won’t be purchasing a pair for future training. I’ll stick to some of the other running shoes I’ve reviewed. But before I get into that, I want to go over their pros and cons the way I see them.\n\nPros\n\nCushioned, neutral trainer with a light, responsive ride\n\nPromotes a midfoot strike without forcing you to make noticeable form changes\n\n3mm heel-toe drop (just remember to transition slower than I did!)\n\nComfortable upper – no problems with blisters\n\nDurable – low wear and tear even after 200+ miles\n\nCons\n\nPrice – at $175 they’re inaccessible for most of the market. I don’t think they’re worth it.\n\nDebris can get stuck in the actuator lugs, especially if you run a lot of trails\n\nCould be too cushioned for some runners\n\nI recommend the Newton Gravity running shoes for runners with a neutral foot strike or those who are mild overpronators who want a “cautious minimalist” shoe.\n\nThey may not be great for trail running (rocks and sticks get stuck in the lugs) or racing (they’re too high-profile for my tastes), but as a neutral trainer that can promote more lower leg strength, they’re a valuable tool in any runner’s toolbox.\n\nThe reason why I won’t be purchasing a pair is simply because of the price tag. They’re about double what most running shoes cost and I just can’t figure out why they’re priced at $175. I’m sure it has to do with the actuator lugs and proprietary sole material but regardless, it’s out of my reach and I suspect that’s true for most runners.\n\nBut as I continue to run in the Gravity’s, I have to admit that my first impression of them was wrong. The lugs do promote a neutral running stride without being overly obtrusive. I wouldn’t go walking in them or wear them casually, but for running they’re a comfortable addition to my collection of running shoes.\n\nIf you want to give them a try, the best deal seems to be on Amazon where they qualify for free shipping.
