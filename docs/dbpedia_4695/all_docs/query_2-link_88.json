        "text": "It never really occurred to me all the different options for running shoes until I became more involved in both racing triathlons and running races. There are various brands that offer consumers anything from a casual walking shoe to racing flats used at the professional level. These companies include Nike, Saucony, Asics and Mizuno as well as other more unique companies such as Newton and Hoka One One. Both Newton and Hoka One One are two examples of shoe companies that offer very unique products to their customers with features unique to just these individual brands. In order for a consumer to buy one product instead of another, in this case shoes, the product needs to have value to the consumer in terms of features. Running shoes specifically differ in terms of weight, recommended use (racing flat, trainer) and structure of the shoe. The structure of the shoe is specifically where both Newton and Hoka One One gain a competitive advantage in the running shoe industry.\n\nHowever based on the structure of the shoes both companies have a very clear, specific, almost pinpointed target market, reason being the shoes offer features that either perfectly fit the consumers needs and running form or are simply irrelevant because of their running form. Personally because of my running form and midfoot strike I used Newton running shoes. According to Newton’s website, Newton running shoes are the “worlds most responsive running shoe.” This is because unlike other shoes Newton running shoes have lugs on the bottom of the shoe. Newton calls this feature “P.O.P technology” which stands for Point of Power technology. Basically this feature adds value to the shoe because if you are a runner that strikes midfoot rather than heel first this shoe offers a very responsive feel to it. The website states, “P.O.P, or Point of Power, is the patented design that differentiates the shape, ride, and feel of our Action/Reaction Technology or lug system. Our shoes have three different P.O.P designations for three different rides.” Newton categorizes their shoes based on the type of P.O.P one, two or three. P.O.P 1 offers the consumer “Prominent, powerful lugs with square corners deliver our most responsive, performance ride.” On the other hand P.O.P 3 “Foam-backed and less pronounced lugs produce our softest ride.” This exemplifies how Newton as a company offers different features within their product line to best fit the needs of various consumers within their target market of midfoot strike runners. As stated on their website, “ we set out too create a running shoe that was different, not for the sake of being different but to make every stride better.” Newton focuses their shoes on three major features to give their brand a competitive advantage over competitors in the industry like Nike. These features are “Action/Reaction Technology” “Level Platform” and “Full Foot cushioning.” Newton does a great job recognizing that due to the fact that their shoes are very different than most shoes consumers are going to want to demo them before buying a pair. Personally this is how I got introduced to Newton running shoes before buying a pair myself. The company uses shoe demos as a marketing strategy to create a personalized experience with the customer while also simultaneously promoting their product. In terms of the product life cycle this is an effective method as to introduce and grow the brand. Once a runner becomes accustomed to a shoe and doesn’t have any issues in terms of injuries they will usually use the same shoe. Therefore its essential for Newton to focus on the growth phase of the product life cycle because once they get a customer hooked that customer would most likely continue to buy their product. These demos work to create brand loyalty. For me personally I began using the shoe because of a demo and now am a lifelong customer that would recommend Newton running shoes to runners or triathletes . That’s what brand loyalty is about and it’s a result of Newton’s successful and effective marketing tactics."
