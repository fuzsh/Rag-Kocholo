        "text": "Newton Running, the natural running shoe specialist, has unveiled ‘60 Days of Better’, a program encouraging runners to try Newton Running shoes. Under the new program, customers purchasing Newton Running shoes from any of its 450 retailers in the US and Canada between 1 September and 31 October 2012, have up to 60 days from the date of purchase to return the shoes if they are not completely satisfied.\n\n“Our goal is to reach a broader running audience with the message that if you give Newton Running shoes a try, you’ll experience the joy of better running,” said Stuart Johnson, VP of Marketing for Newton Running.\n\n60 Days of Better is an extension of the ‘Hello Better’ marketing campaign launched earlier this year, which encourages runners to experience how Newton’s principles of ‘active, level and light’ help runners achieve their best running motion.\n\nAs the company points out, all Newton Running shoes are active thanks to the patented Action/Reaction technology, a dynamic, trampoline-like cushioning system that protects the body from impact. Newton Running shoes are built on a near level-to-the-ground platform that supports a natural running position and they provide lightweight comfort to encourage a fast, quick cadence.\n\nThe 60 Days of Better campaign coincides with the release of a limited edition of the men’s and women’s Gravity Neutral Performance Trainer (lime and black for men, pink and black for women), available on a limited-time basis at select Newton Running retailers. Information about these, as well as Newton Running’s complete lines of Performance, Light Weight and Guidance Trainers, is available at www.NewtonRunning.com.\n\nA 60 Days of Better print and digital advertising campaign is launching now and will run through October in vertical running and triathlon media outlets such as Runner’s World, Competitor, LAVA, Trail Runner, MapMyRun, RunnersWorld.com, Active.com and others.\n\nIn tandem, Newton Running will also host a 60 Days of Better Facebook sweepstakes that will award various prizes, ranging from a MapMyRun premium membership to a race entry in Competitor Group’s Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series.\n\nwww.NewtonRunning.com"
