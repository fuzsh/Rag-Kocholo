        "text": "I was excited to try the Newton Issac because of how much cushion it has. I’ve enjoyed Newtons, and the Newton Gravity was my first ever “real running shoe” in 2011. Time flies, and I was loyal to the Newton Gravity for the first four years of running. So, Newton has always held a special place in my heart.\n\nNewton Issac Quick Facts:\n\nWeight: 7.8 oz\n\nHeel to Toe Drop: 8 mm\n\nCost: $145\n\nNewton Issac Fit:\n\nThe Newton Issac uses an anatomically designed air mesh plush, seamless, and anti-frictionation lining. I don’t know if I’ve ever heard of an anti-frictional lining. What does that even mean? Is it just hype? Well, the fit is comfortable, and I haven’t gotten any blisters or chafing so I guess the anti-frictional lining is successful.\n\nThe best running shoes disappear off your feet; for the most part, Newton does just that. It has a perforated, soft tongue, which is excellent for breathable. There are no hot spots. It does fit slightly wider but has no hot spots that I was concerned with. The upper is generally soft, and the upper fits and feels good…what more do you need in running shoes?\n\nI generally wear between a women’s size 10-11 in running shoes and have found the 11 to fit perfectly. If you have a wider foot, you’ll appreciate the extra space. They do have a wider midfoot than most other shoes.\n\nNewton Issac Ride:\n\nBefore trying the Newton Issac, I didn’t know what kind of shoe it was. A fast shoe? Easy run shoe? Well, it’s actually Newton’s first super foam shoe. But what does that mean? This high cushion daily trainer is made for logging a lot of miles. Similar to the New Balance Supercomp or ASICS Superblast.\n\nThe Newton Issac contains two foams:\n\nNRG+\n\nHytrel\n\nThe rocker geometry is designed to help roll you forward. If you flip any Newton shoe over, you’ll notice the lugs on the bottom. That is what makes Newton running shoes unique. The Issac has eight independent lugs designed to compress and help spring you forward. They work together with the Peebax plate to give you a responsive ride. As far as lugs go, the Newton Issac are less pronounced than most other Newton’s so it makes it easier to work into. Newtons in general will force you more on your toes so you might find your calves are more sore. It’s essential to work into them, otherwise, you might find yourself injured.\n\nTraction and Durability:\n\nWhen you see Newton running shoes and their lugs, you’ll know they heavily affect the traction. Having uneven lugs means the traction is not always the best just because you aren’t running on a smooth surface. Is it bad? No, but it’s not the best. Plus, the Newton Issac does have blown rubber at the bottom. I’ve used the Issac on the trails as well as some rainy weather and had no issues, but if it was torrentially raining or I was only going on trails I would use a different shoe. Truthfully the Newton Issac does have some of the better traction of Newton running shoes.\n\nRegarding durability, Newton claims their shoes generally last longer than average, and I would agree. I’ve never had a Newton running shoe last less than 400 miles. The Newton Issac seems to be following that trend.\n\nFor me, the Newton Issac falls into an easy-run shoe. There is so much cushion, and I love that it’s responsive enough to pick up the pace if I want to. My body feels good after running in it. It’s a shoe I generally take after a hard workout or when I want a few easy miles.\n\nNewton Issac Conclusion\n\nI’m a big fan of the Newton Issac. It’s got a ton of cushion and a great easy-run shoe. Newton’s used to be more expensive, but now for a shoe with a Peebax plate and a lot of cushion, $145 is cheaper. It’s definitely a high cushioned trainer that you could pick up the pace if you wanted.\n\nWho should buy the Newton Issac? If you are looking for an easy run shoe or a daily trainer. Plus, it’s great if you have wider-than-average feet.\n\nWho should not buy the Newton Issac? If you are looking for a racing shoe or have super narrow feet. If you are prone to calve problems, Newton in general, is not the first brand I would recommend. But if not, the Newton Issac is a good one to add to your rotation.\n\nMy Current Shoe Rotation:\n\nEasy/Daily Runs: Antepes Muscle Runners, Tracksmith Eliot Runner, New Balance 1080v12 , Newton Gravity 12, 361 Degrees Centauri, ASICS Superblast\n\nSpeed Work: Hoka Solimar, Altra Vanish Carbon, 361 Flame, Nike Tempo Next%, Reebok Float Ride Run fast Pro, Nike ZoomX Streakfly\n\nLong Runs: ASICS Superblast\n\nTrail Running/Hiking: 361 Futura, Brooks Caldera 6, Hoka Tecton X2 Shoe Review Speedland SL: PDX,\n\nRaces: Nike ZoomX Streakfly, New Balance Fuelcell 5280, Reebok Run fast Pro , Nike Vaporfly 3 Hoka Rocket X 2 ASICS Metaspeed Edge+\n\nYou Can See All Current Shoe Reviews Here.\n\nLooking to learn more about running shoes?
