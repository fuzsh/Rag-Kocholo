        "text": "The Energy facilitates seamless transition from conventional shoes to the Newton experience\n\nNewton Running Energy Running Shoe\n\nNewton Running Boulder, CO\n\nAPRIL 4, 2013—Newton Running, the leader in performance running shoes that actively support and strengthen natural running motion, is launching the EnergyNR, available at running-specialty retailers and NewtonRunning.com starting July 17. Designed to meet the needs of runners who want to experience the unique technology platform and ride found only in Newton running shoes, the $119 EnergyNR facilitates a seamless transition from more conventional running shoe brands into the Newton line.\n\n“Our goal is always to look for ways to expand the Newton experience to a broader group of runners and the EnergyNR is an addition to our line that offers similar features and ride to all of our products but in a more conventional design package,” says Newton Running co-founder Danny Abshire. “Runners who are new to the brand as well as loyal Newtonites will truly enjoy the lightweight and responsive ride that the EnergyNR offers.”\n\nThe EnergyNR includes a version of Newton’s Action/ReactionTM technology in the forefoot. Originally offered in Newton’s MV2 racing shoes, the more streamlined design employs five low-profile forefoot lugs to provide superior impact-zone cushioning and a smooth, stable ride. The lightweight, breathable mesh upper has a roomy toebox that provides ample room for toes to splay, while midfoot overlays ensure a secure fit.\n\nThe EnergyNR weighs just 9 oz for men and 7 oz for women. It is available in two colors for each men women and will be available at specialty retailers and www.newtonrunning.com starting July 17, 2013.\n\nAbout Newton Running\n\nBoulder, Colorado-based Newton Running is the leader in performance running shoes that are designed to actively support and strengthen natural running motion.
