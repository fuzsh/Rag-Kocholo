Newton Running is set to move its flagship store, but the Boulder, Colo.-based company isn’t running away from home. Newton is vacating its Walnut Street digs for the downtown destination of locals and tourists alike: Pearl Street Mall.

The 1222 Pearl Street location will host a grand opening celebration on March 14.

“We are so excited to be a permanent feature on Pearl Street, an iconic street in a town that inspires our brand and the products we make each day,” said Jennifer Abshire, director of retail for Newton Running in a statement. “The grand opening event on March 14 is the perfect way to celebrate this step in our brand’s history with Newtonites old and new.

The company, which manufactures its own running-shoe lines and sells them internationally through retail stores and online, said in a statement that the 3,300-square-foot storefront will retain many of the features that make the Pearl Street Mall building so popular with locals, from its original 1990s floorboards to its brick walls. But it will also boast new, environmentally friendly wall paneling and displays made from plant fiber.

The flagship will showcase some of the the company’s original shoe models, highlighting Newton’s exponential growth since its start in 2007.

The company is owned and operated by runners, so it’s only fitting that Newton will celebrate the store’s opening with a run. A 10 a.m. fun run, starting at the new location, will be led by the Team Newton-sponsored runners, many of whom will stick around for a meet-and-greet.

Sponsored runners who will be in attendance include Kara Henry, Tyler McCandless, Melody Fairchild and Kristin Arendt.
