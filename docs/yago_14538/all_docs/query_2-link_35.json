        "text": "Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro (Don’t Cry for Salim, the Lame)\n\nA discourse set in the urban slum of then Bombay. This masterpiece directed by Saeed Akhtar Mirza, tells the story of Salim, a small-time ruffian and aspiring gangster and the circumstances that follows him. With an ensemble cast consisting of legendary theatre actors Pawan Malhotra (as Salim Pasha), Vikram Gokhale (Salim’s father), Surekha Sikhri (Salim’s mother), Tom Alter, Makrand Deshpandey, Ashutosh Gowariker, Neelima Azeem, Rajendra Gupta, Nishigandha Wad, etc.\n\nThe opening credits roll with… a film by Saeed Akhtar Mirza… for Safdar Hashmi.\n\nIt is important to discuss Safdar here, because Safdar himself was a playwright and director, popular for his street theatre in India. He was also an activist and an important voice in the Indian political theatre. Safdar was attacked during a performance in the Jhandapur village of UP along with his troupe. He was fatally injured and died the following day. Till today he is known as a symbol of cultural resistance against authoritarianism for the Indian Left. During his own lifetime, Safdar wanted to awaken people around him with his plays and poetry to fight against the poverty, illiteracy, ignorance and fascism. A small portrayal of him, I could connect and found in the role of Aslam, when he advocates for the female literacy and fights against his own people for girls’ education.\n\nTalking about the storyline, the film begins with a self-introduction of Salim and then revolves around him for sometime before focusing on other things, his family, the social landscape he lives in and his future aspirations and dreams. It vividly depicts the social stigmas and the conditions of downtrodden poor class of society. In a scene, a social documentary is displayed on the public street about the riots in Bhiwandi, Maharasthra and the aftermath of it. A young man (probably the film director) comes out and explains how politicians and ill-minded people wage war against each other among public in the name of religion and caste. He tells how the cost of such riots is usually being paid by innocent children, women and general public in large.\n\nOn the contemporary, the struggle in Salim’s family keeps on evolving. With an unemployed father, a sister of marrying age, a dead brother, with the only support of a mother sewing clothes to run the small household, Salim wanders in the street in search of self-awakening and identity. He constantly rues how he lacked good education and often blames his father for it. He is ambitious but his plans are nefarious. He collects money from small shopkeepers along with his gang of two other mates (Makrand and Ashutosh). In the other corner of the town, a young musician named Johan (probably of British or American descent) lives alone in an old house. He plays guitar and tells Salim and his friends that the world has learnt nothing from so many wars and strife that it still continues to murder people. Salim joins him regularly to smoke and discuss life. At one point, he asks Johan (played brilliantly by Tom Alter) to leave the town and go to far away in some other country (or his home town) to escape the ordinary mundane miserable life of slum. To this Johan replies, there is no other country in this world better than India to die.\n\nThe characters of Saeed Akhtar Mirza are common people passing to you next in the street. They have adapted to this life through time and have become accustomed to this world. Take for example, Salim, he is rowdy, speaks like fire and never feels afraid to set out other people straight, but he cries out in alone. He loves a beautiful courtesan, Mumtaz and proposes to her despite knowing he cannot bear the expenses of his own alone. He dreams for his loving sister. He repents, as towards the end, he joins a garage to work as a simple mechanic leaving his old ways. He declares to Aslam (a proofreader in a local newspaper and his to be brother-in-law), that, he is mending his ways and coming to the light leaving back the darkness of his life. But to which point can we escape the past?\n\nThe other film which had touched me so poignantly was Sudhir Mishra’s Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi (2003) with Kay Kay Menon, Chitrangada Singh and Shiney Ahuja as the leading cast.\n\nThis was the first film of Pawan Malhotra as a leading man and it went on to win two National Film Awards. Naseem (1995), an another film of Mirza Sahab received similar critical acclaim. I was fascinated by the titles of his films, viz., Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyoon Aata Hai (1980), Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho! (1984), Arvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Dastaan (1978) and this, Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro.\n\nThese titles look like an interesting story points in themselves. There are many similar titles directed by others in the parallel cinema which I would like to follow next. One of them as I remember is, Suraj Ka Satvan Ghoda."
