        "text": "Safdar Hashmi (12 April 1954-2 January 1989) was the embodiment of those communist values which shaped his craft – that of cultural activist and street theatre artist. Although he wrote books for children and criticism of the Indian stage, he will be remembered best for his work with Jan Natya Manch (People’s Theatre Front) which was formed in 1973 as an outgrowth of the Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA) and which became closely linked to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPM] during the 1970s. Janam (which means ‘Rebirth’ and works as an acronym for the troupe’s name) came into its own with the production of Machine to a trade union meeting of over 200,000 workers on 20 November 1978, but went from strength to strength after that with plays on the distress of small peasants (Gaon Se Shahar Tak), on clerical fascism (Hatyare & Apharan Bhaichare Ke), on unemployment (Teen Crore), on violence against women (Aurat) and on inflation (DTC ki Dhandhli). Safdar saw these plays as “the manifestation of protest against the bourgeois concept of theatre, against the bourgeois appropriation of the proscenium theatre.”\n\nOn 1 January 1989, Safdar and Janam performed one of their plays, Halla Bol (Raise Hell!), to offer solidarity to industrial workers on strike as well as to the CPM election campaign in the hinterland of Delhi. The play was about the government’s role in the repression of the workers’ organs for the economic struggle. During the show, Mukesh Sharma, supported by the Congress Party, as well as a crowd of Congress supporters arrived at the scene, armed with guns and bamboo poles. They began a confrontation which led to the murder of Safdar; a terrified bourgeoisie enacts its fear, once more, through terror. The shallowness of liberal democracy was made evident by the death of Safdar, which inaugurated a series of important massacres of the Indian left: the police murder of striking CPM industrial workers at a Cement Factory at Dalla on 2 June 1991, the murder of Shankar Guha Niyogi, leader of the Chattisgarh Mukti Morcha, on 28 September 1991 and more recently, the murder of Datta Samant, maverick hero of the 1982 Bombay Textile Strike and leader of Kamgarh Aghadi, on 17 January 1997. Safdar’s death led to the formation of the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (SAHMAT) which attempts to further progressive values."
