        "text": "The Indian Film Industry is among one of the biggest filmmaking industries of the world. It does produce more films annually than any other movie industry. It also has its own style and grammar which is radically different from any other country’s cinema.\n\nSadly, the popular idea about the industry is that Indian movies are just a bunch of song and dance routines interspersed with melodramatic and unrealistic narratives. A fraction of commercial Indian cinema, whose sole purpose is to entertain the general public can definitely fall under this bracket, provided we are very strict with our judgements. Not that they can’t be thoroughly enjoyable in many cases!\n\nBut as with any other industry, which has lived a life as long and fruitful as Indian cinema, it has other sides as well. There have been great auteurs here who have inspired modern filmmakers all over the globe and can still teach some valuable lessons to young filmmakers like ourselves.\n\nSo, to get to know about the masterpieces of Indian cinema and to take my share of learnings from them, I have compiled a list of 25 Indian films which had a great run at the festival circuit all over the globe.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list, but this is just a barometer to judge the value of a film as an art piece, as objectively as possible. These might not be the best works of the director’s filmography but a lot of established and experienced jury members of reputed festivals chose them, so there must be something special about them. Please do let me know if you think I’ve missed a gem out of this list.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s jump right into it.\n\nPather Panchali\n\nDirector – Satyajit Ray\n\nYear Released – 1955\n\nMajor Festival Achievements – Best Human Document winner at Cannes Film Festival, Selznick Golden Laurel for Best Film at Berlin International Film Festival, Golden Gate for Best Director and Best Picture at San Francisco International Film Festival\n\nOther acclaimed films by the director – Aparajito (Golden Lion at Venice Film Festival), Ashani Sanket (Golden Bear at Berlin International Film Festival), Charulata (Silver Bear at Venice Film Festival), Mahanagar (Silver Bear at Berlin International Film Festival)\n\nPather Panchali depicts the childhood travails of the protagonist Apu and his elder sister Durga amidst the harsh village life of their poor family.\n\nWhat other film to start this list other than the one film which singlehandedly put Indian cinema on the world map?

Ironically, this film couldn’t get an Indian release, but it still remains the only Indian film with a Palm d’Or.
