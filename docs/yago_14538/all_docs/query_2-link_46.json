        "text": "आदमी की साडी शख्सियत उसकी तहज़ीब,यादों का करवाई तो है ।\n\nThe sheer amount of mise-en-scene in each frame.\n\nThe whole film is worth studying.\n\nMasterpiece!!\n\nTop first watches (2023) boxd.it/kBAig\n\na heavily imbalanced film that tries to depict the rising tensions and the contrasting emotions of Naseem and her ailing grandfather. But it fails to fruit either of the situations, as one storyline pulls out way too quickly to change the string to show the other part of the film. The thick, dark, pastel colored frames are beautiful but the cinematography is a bit too commonly orchestrated, but has nonetheless a handful of captivating screengrabs. The story and the pacing was just too prematurely structured with extremely short scenes. A half-baked attempt but still an okay one-time watch that you'll probably going to forget.\n\nBeautiful movie!!!\n\nMight write my paper on this, would save the analysis for there.\n\nBut what I absolutely loved was how Saeed Mirza chose to tell this story, otherwise it could just have been a \"political\" movie trying to make a point about the Babri Masjid demolition and all that it would usher. Placing an endearing relationship- that of teenager Naseem and her tender and astute storyteller Dada Jaan, at the center of the movie which probes ideas as behemoth…\n\na movie about the rising tensions leading up to December 6th 1992. idk what I was expecting, but it definitely did help paint a picture into the daily life of a Muslim family. Also having a young Muslim girl as a protagonist had to be unheard of at the time.\n\nvery visually appealing, storylines were interesting, funny enough, clearly entertaining\n\nThe language and colours in this film are so beautiful.\n\nThe tragic event that surrounds the film is really messed up and provides the film different layers of emotions, thoughts and questions about humanity as a whole. I love the poetry and melancholy of this film.\n\nKay Kay Menon was such a surprise and was very convincing. Great acting across the film and amazing dialogues. Saeed Akhtar Mirza is a genius!"
