        "text": "Number of episodes Title Released Overall In season 1 1 Maya is Born April 1 1975 An uproar in the bee-hive. Miss Cassandra returns home and after a long discussion, Cassandra is allowed to enter the hive, just in time to witness the birth of the new bees. One bee after the other hatches out of the combs, only one doesn’t: Maya, the exception. The first episode shows Maya's birth, her first escape and her great longing to see the world.[1] 2 2 Maya Learns How to Fly May 8 1975 Summer time. It is hot, which means danger for the bee hive. The wax is threatening to melt. So everyone must keep together and restore the correct temperature by beating their wings faster. Maya and Willy are amazed, but they've got lots more to learn. At school Cassandra tells them all they must know about bad weather, wasps, flies and flowers and they also have flying lessons. 3 3 Maya and the Dragonfly Shnuck May 15 1975 Maya would like to be free to fly around. So she contrives everything possible to secretly run away from the hive. At first of all she lands in the penal comb and lazy little Willy comes to her aid. Then she discovers flowers, grass and most important of all Sirena, the dragonfly who deeply impresses Maya by her skilful flying and her glittering wings. 4 4 Maya and the Ants May 22 1975 Maya's wish is to be the captain of an ant army for just one day. After all, she did help the ants to reach land on her floating leaf. This wish is fulfilled. MAYA turns out to be a trusty captain. Despite the fact that she leads the ants through water and has difficulties climbing up a tree but she is the one who finally helps the ants with the feared ant-lion. 5 5 Maya and the Housefly Puck May 29 1975 Maya persuades Pucka to show her a humans house. When they enter a house Maya finds this all very entertaining. She enjoys being in a house, although she is forced to realise that it can also be dangerous in there. But everything turns out well. Humans willingly give back freedom to a little bee who busily collects honey. 6 6 Maya and the Spider Thekla June 5 1975 During an excursion with Willy a lady beetle is caught by a fat spider in its web. The spider has been waiting for this opportunity for a long time. Maya does not yet know how unpleasantly sticky a spider’s web can be, and so she volunteers to take the place of the lady beetle. But now she recognices how sticky it is. Who can help her? Maybe Willy and Flip? 7 7 The Forest Fire June 12 1975 Danger in the garden. A fire has broken out. The insects are at their wits end. Only the violin snider is glad about the fire, for she welcomes anything which distracts the insects’ attention. Perhaps someone will wander into her web by mistake. The agitation grows and grows. The fire spreads and spreads. The first floor of a plant house is already in flames. The insects need help. 8 8 Willi with the Ants June 19 1975 Maya, Willy and the fly are playing In the middle of a horse’s back when a heavy lash of the horse tail let Willie fall to the ground unconscious. Of course the ants clear him off the area: anything lying around is promptly disposed of. At the very last moment Willy regains consciousness and discovers himself surrounded by ants. Aha, says Willy, that means I am an ant. 9 9 Maya and the Earthworm Max June 26 1975 Max, the earthworm, tends to depressions. Continuous rain is the cause. So Maya and Willy try to cheer him up, but the games which they play with Max are more to their taste than his and so he wants nothing to do with the others anymore and runs off. At the end it remains for a human who places Max in his garden to give him the feeling that he is useful. 10 10 Green Frog July 3 1975 Maya and Willy meet a frog, a small, green frog whom they think quite cute. But this frog is everything but cute. He’s got only one thing in his head: to eat Maya and Willy for breakfast. Luckily for them, this frog is not very clever and so lands at the end of our story in a dark well. Even so, Maya and Willy help him. 11 11 Shelter From the Rain July 10 1975 It’s raining. It's been raining the whole day. At the beginning it’s all very entertaining. The insects crowd together for shelter under a toadstool and relate their experiences to one another. But after a while the water starts rising. Things look menacing. The little group is in danger. 12 12 Expedition Into Underground July 17 1975 For the first time in their lives, Maya and Willy are confronted with the illuminating power of the glow worm and of course Maya promptly gets an idea.

And where is the exit? 13 13 Old Lady Grasshopper July 24 1975 One day Maya and Willy discover an unknown old lady locust. She has been left behind by the large group of wandering locusts and is now sitting rather dejected and dissatisfied with herself in the garden.

But suddenly the old lady reveals herself as being very robust and determined. 14 14 Jumping Competition July 31 1975 Big leaping competition. Of course Flip boasts terribly and considers himself to be the best, the fastest, the longest and in particular the most elegant leaper. But even Flip must learn that sometimes there are better hoppers, like a flea for example. 15 15 Stray Baby August 7 1975 Maya and Willy have found a small caterpillar who they think is homeless. So they take the caterpillar with them and look after it. They lovingly care for it and develop a fond affection for it. But one day they witness how their little caterpillar first of all turns into a monster, then into a beautiful butterfly. 16 16 Earwig Family Comes August 14 1975 Maya has promised a beetle couple to look after their young. Poor Willy! If he had known how difficult it is to look after a wild band of little beetles, he would have most certainly not even bothered to get out of bed. 17 17 Centipede August 21 1975 Maya meets a sick centepede. But the centepede doesn't right know what really is the matter with him. One of his many legs won't work properly, the problem is, that he is due to appear as a one- man band.

While training for the grasshopper long hop championship he has got trapped in the grips of a carnivorous plant. Poor Flip! His end seems to have drawn near. He depicts it in the worst possible way.

He uses a liana as a trampoline. Maya learns this game very quickly from Willy, but as is so often the case with her she overdoes it and lands in the web of the brown spider.

But then Kurt is lying flat on his back and must be turned over. 20 20 Shelter From the Wind September 11 1975 In the insects’ garden utter chaos reigns. A storm is blowing.

The situation becomes perilous, but even a stinkbug has its good points. 21 21 Cicada September 18 1975 For the first time in their lives Maya and Willy hear that cicadas grow up deep under the earth. Of course they would like to meet a cicade. Is it surprising then that Maya and Willy get into trouble right from the beginning? This time it is a land slide which has blocked the exit of the cicade nest. What can be done about it? 22 22 Jama the Ant September 25 1975 Maya learns a lot about the life of the ants which she also comes to love. Here there is always something going on and Maya feels happy in their kingdom. Of course, Willy is anything but in agreement but on the other hand he does not want to be without friend, Maya. Will he find a solution to the problem? 23 23 Cricket October 2 1975 One day Maya discovers a small cage on a window in which a cricket is sitting sadly drooping its wings.

She calls her friends together and the four of them try freeing the cricket. 24 24 Where is the Wood October 9 1975 Maya and Willy get lost in the fog. Everything is gloomy, sinister and strange. Flying is out of the question because you can not even see your hand before your eyes and walking is too much trouble. No matter whom they ask no one knows the direction. Does Flip know the answer this time? 25 25 Tiger Longicorn Beetle October 16 1975 Maya makes a strange discovery. Some leaves are no leaves at all, but butterflies. Some branches are no branches and there is a wasp who is not a wasp at all. The world appears completely changed to Maya.

They eat and nibble until within a few minutes everything is bare. The paradise of our insects is threatened.

But the question remains whether this idea is really the right one. 27 27 Flower Sprite October 30 1975 Maya is even staying outside at night and this is the night during which the flower elf will be awakened to life.
