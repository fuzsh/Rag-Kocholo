The series itself has been dubbed into over 40 languages all around the world and has even spawned a number of video games.\n\nThe premise of the anime was that Maya was tasked to collect pollen for her hive, but she ended up doing such a good job that she gathered all of the pollen around her hive, and there was none left.
