        "text": "Waiting for Maya the Bee, the latest film by Alexs Stadermann which will be released on september 18th by Notorious Picture, a little taste of the most loved insect in the world will be given today at Giffoni Film Festival. The 8 minutes preview will show the fight between bees and wasps as well as the life of little unconventional Maya, born in a beehive where being different is not easy. Her funny efforts to be like the other and become a good bee set her against the Queen Bee's malignant counselor, who is conspiring to steal a big quantity of royal jelly. As soon as Maya stumbles on what's been going on, she summons up all the insects, wasps included, that will prove to be loyal allies.\n\nDuring the evening, film protagonist Maya will be in the Cittadella del Cinema, where children will have the chance to meet her and take pictures. At 7.15pm, Maya the Bee will be on the Blue Carpet to hand out gadgets and Arkoroyal lollipops before the preview in Sala Truffaut, where she will meet the children. In the Italian version, little Maya has been dubbed by Antonella Baldini, Maya the Honey Bee TV series' dubber too. After Captain Harlok and Belle & Sebastien, another Eighties' unquestioned icon debuts on the big screen to move yesterday and today's children to tears."
