        "text": "Maya King\n\nI’m a politics reporter for The New York Times covering the Southeast and based in Atlanta.\n\nWhat I Cover\n\nI write about campaigns, elections and movements in the American South. I also write about national trends relating to Black voters and young people. As a native Southerner, I have been most fascinated by the ways the region has changed politically, culturally and demographically over the last few presidential election cycles — and how those changes are connected. I’m based in Atlanta, considered the economic and cultural epicenter of the South and home to many of the forces shaping national politics today.\n\nMy Background\n\nI joined The Times in 2022 and moved from Washington to Atlanta to cover the midterm races for governor and U.S. Senate in Georgia. Before that, I wrote about race and national politics at Politico. I was born and raised in Tallahassee, Fla., and graduated from Howard University (HU!).\n\nJournalistic Ethics\n\nAt The Times (and every news organization I have worked for), I have aimed to maintain the highest standards of accuracy and fairness, as outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook. In keeping with these standards, I protect my sources and do not accept gifts, money or favors from anyone who might factor into my reporting. I do not contribute to any political campaigns or endorse any causes."
