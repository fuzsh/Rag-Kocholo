Netflix offers child-friendly programming with movies and TV shows considered acceptable viewing for children. One series that is featured, “Maya the Bee,” has received a lot of attention because of an inappropriate image found in one of its episodes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ArielWray/status/908808754736566274\n\nThe show experienced controversy due to episode 37 of season one called “King Willy.” There was a glimpse of a clearly drawn penis carved into the inner part of a log in one of the scenes. Confused and angry parents were demanding an explanation from the producer of “Maya the Bee.”\n\nThe show experienced controversy due to episode 37 of season one called “King Willy.” There was a glimpse of a clearly drawn penis carved into the inner part of a log in one of the scenes.\n\nConfused and angry parents were demanding an explanation from the producer of “Maya the Bee.” Some took to their parenting blogs, Twitter or to YouTube to warn others of the series.\n\nJulie Scagell, a mother and blogger from scarymommy.com said, “Understandably, no parent wants to see X-rated material in children’s programming, but seeing as how countless supervisors, producers, Netflix executives and 149 other artists didn’t notice… we’re thinking the kids wouldn’t likely have noticed it either.”\n\nYouTubers commented on the inappropriateness of such an object in a children’s show.\n\nOn Sept. 22, Studio 10, the production group of “Maya the Bee” released a statement about the inappropriate image.\n\nThe statement said, “The origin of this image obviously results from a very bad joke from one of the 150 artists working on the production.”\n\nThe production apologized and stated that they will take legal action against the perpetrator. Netflix has not commented on the image but has taken down that episode of the “Maya the Bee” series, leaving the remaining episodes online for streaming."
