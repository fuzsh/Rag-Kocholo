Plot

Maya the Bee was about a bee named Maya. It was mainly just about little adventures that her and her cowardly bee friend Willi would have. Other characters included Cassandra (Maya's teacher) and Flip (a grasshopper). And of course, since this was a children's show, every episode taught wholesome life lessons.
