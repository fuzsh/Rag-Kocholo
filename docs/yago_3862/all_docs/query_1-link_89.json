        "text": "CNN host Christiane Amanpour and husband Jamie Rubin are divorcing after 20 years of marriage, according to a friend.\n\nThe couple, who are both journalists, fell in love over ‘late night margaritas’ while working in war-torn Sarajevo.\n\nThey tied the knot in a swanky wedding ceremony in 1998, in Italy, attended by John F. Kennedy Jr. and wife Carolyn, diplomat Richard Holbrooke, Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal and former Deputy National Security Adviser James Steinberg.\n\nDespite the plans to divorce, as first reported by the Washington Post, the couple appeared together last weekend at their only child Darius’ graduation from the 500-year-old English boarding school for boys, Tonbridge School in Kent.\n\nChristiane Amanpour, 60, the host of CNN’s global affairs show ‘Amanpour,’ recently took over Charlie Rose’s prime-time PBS slot after he was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women.\n\nJamie, 58, a former diplomat, journalist and Bill Clinton-era assistant secretary of state for public affairs, is writing and consulting for lobbying firm Ballard Partners.\n\nChristiane Amanpour, who was born to an Iranian father and a British mother in London and raised in Tehran, is a highly accomplished journalist who has won countless awards, including Emmys and Peabodys, as well as numerous honorary doctorates and degrees for her work.\n\nAmanpour moved to the US to study journalism at the University of Rhode Island, which she graduated summa cum laude, before being hired by CNN on the foreign desk in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1983.\n\nAmanpour’s first big assignment was covering the Iran–Iraq War, and she has since reported on major crises from many of the world’s hotspots, including Iraq, Afghanistan, the Palestinian territories, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Somalia, Rwanda, and the Balkans.\n\nShe has also interviewed major political figures and world leaders from across the globe, from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and ex Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to Moammar Gadhafi and even the Dalai Lama.\n\nIn 2013, the couple announced they were moving back to London and Christiane called Jamie a ‘true hero’ for moving to England for her.\n\nJamie, who helped raise their son, served in the State Department under President Bill Clinton, before he joined Sky News as a presenter, and later a commentator.\n\nHe graduated from Columbia University, from which he also received a master’s degree in international affairs and was a member of Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nSource: Dailymail"
