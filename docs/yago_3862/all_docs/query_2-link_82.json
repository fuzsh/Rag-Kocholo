        "text": "Nowadays, we’re seeing stay-home-dads more and more, both celebrities and those in our daily life.\n\nIn fact, according to Pew Research Center, stay-at-home dads — or, “househusbands,” if you will — have been on the rise — rising to 16% of stay-at-home parents in 2012, up from 10% in 1989.\n\nKeeping that trend going, our next stay-at-home dad might just be the beloved actor Tom Holland.\n\nThe “Spiderman” star has recently been hinting at taking some time away from his career to possibly be a stay-at-home dad, saying, “I want to take a break and focus on starting a family and figuring out what I want to do outside of this world.”\n\nSounds like as good a time as any to let him know that he’d be in good company; a surprising number of famous heartthrobs have been stay-at-home dads at some point!\n\n1Ben Affleck\n\nDFree/Shutterstock\n\nBack when Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner had been everyone’s favorite celebrity power couple, they would often have to take turns staying home with the kids while the other was off somewhere filming a movie.\n\nAnd no, Affleck was not exempt from this rule! We can’t help but appreciate parents who share the work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2John Lennon\n\nemka74/Shutterstock\n\nIn his first marriage, John Lennon was so busy touring with The Beatles that he was not around for his kids as much as he would have liked, so with his second wife, Yoko Ono, he took a break from his career and became a full-time stay at home dad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3LeBron James\n\nDFree/Shutterstock\n\nFor a significant amount of time, LeBron James played for his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, despite building up an impressive reputation on the Miami Heat. He did this so that he could keep his family grounded and spend more time with his kids!\n\nIn the off-season, he was focused on being a stay-at-home father for his kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4David Beckham\n\nAndrea Raffin/Shutterstock\n\nDavid Beckham is almost as famous for being a great father as he is for being a great soccer player!\n\nAfter he retired from soccer in 2013, he has been a full-time stay-at-home-dad! Meanwhile, his wife, the former Posh Spice, Victoria Beckham, focuses on her career as a world-famous fashion designer.\n\n5Adam Levine\n\nA.PAES/Shutterstock\n\nKnown as the lead singer of Maroon 5 and a judge on “The Voice,” Adam Levine is a newer stay-at-home father, and he seems to be loving it!\n\nIn 2019, he told Ellen, “\"Just to be able to stop in this moment to spend time with my new young family and just have the greatest time ever. Now I’m just, like, a stay-at-home dad. I just stay home and do very little. It’s great.\"\n\nWhile that sounds a bit more simple than the average stay-at-home parent’s life, we’re just glad he’s embracing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6Rick Moranis\n\nYouTube\n\nRick Moranis, star of “Ghostbusters” and “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,” had been a stay-at-home dad for years, only doing occasional voice acting roles.\n\nAfter his wife, Ann Moranis, sadly died of breast cancer in 1991, Rick stayed home to raise his children for many years, though he will be returning to acting for a “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” sequel.\n\n7Ryan Reynolds\n\nKathy Hutchins/Shutterstock\n\nKathy Hutchins/Shutterstock\n\nThe “Deadpool” actor and his wife, Blake Lively, seem to have a similar system to what Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner once held to.\n\nIn order to have someone looking after the kids, each parent takes them on full-time while the other is off doing a movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8Dave Chappelle\n\nFeatureflash Photo Agency/Shutterstock\n\nIn 2005, comedian Dave Chappelle suddenly left “Chappelle’s Show,” despite its success.\n\nFor a while, he didn’t do many shows at all, opting to focus on being a father instead, saying that the spotlight “wouldn’t have been conducive to raising a family.”\n\n9James Rubin\n\nRena Schild/Shutterstock\n\nOnce married to the famous journalist Christiane Amanpour, James Rubin had been the Secretary of State for Public Affairs under Bill Clinton. After their son was born in 2000, Rubin retired from politics to become a full-time dad.\n\nMeanwhile, his wife was often traveling for stories, so even though he was staying at home, a lot of responsibilities were on him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10Cary Grant\n\nOlga Popova/Shutterstock\n\nCary Grant had been a mega famous actor back in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, but when he became a father in 1966 (at 62 years old!) he wanted something different for himself and his daughter.\n\nSo, he focused the last 20 years of his life to be a fully devoted stay-at-home father for his only child.\n\nAmanda Hartmann is a writer and editorial intern with YourTango who writes on entertainment and news."
