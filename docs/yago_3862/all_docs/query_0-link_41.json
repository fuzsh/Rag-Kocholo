        "text": "James P. Rubin, a former professor, diplomat and journalist who was once forced out as an editor of the Bloomberg News opinion section, has resigned as a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey just a year and a half after he was appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.\n\nIn an interview on Saturday, Mr. Rubin said he plans to move to London with his wife, Christiane Amanpour, CNN’s chief international correspondent, and their son to work on several projects, including a book about America’s use of military force abroad.\n\nMr. Rubin’s resignation was first reported by Politico on Friday. Anthony Hayes, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said that Mr. Rubin’s last day was Wednesday. Ms. Amanpour’s position with CNN will be unchanged with the move to London, and she will continue to host “Amanpour,” a daily current events program on CNN International, a spokeswoman for the network said.\n\nThe New York State Senate confirmed Mr. Rubin as a Port Authority commissioner less than a year ago. He served as chairman of the security committee and was also senior adviser at the Empire State Development Corporation, the agency that leads New York’s economic development efforts.\n\nMr. Rubin, who served under President Bill Clinton as the State Department’s chief spokesman, has changed roles frequently since marrying Ms. Amanpour in 1998 and subsequently leaving government. He was a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics from 2001 to 2004 and a news anchor and commentator for Sky News from 2005 to 2007. He also worked short stints as a host on PBS and a professor at Columbia University.\n\nIn December 2010, Mr. Rubin was appointed as an editor of Bloomberg View, a new opinion writing section that was intended as a kind of editorial conduit for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s own political views and philosophies. He left the following September after clashing with co-workers, some of whom disliked his editing and organizational style.\n\nSpeaking by telephone on Saturday, Mr. Rubin said he would be leaving for London in “a matter of days.” There, he will be a scholar in residence at the Rothermere American Institute at Oxford University, where he will work on his book. Mr. Rubin will also work as a contributing editor of the New Republic and “do something in the world of television,” he said.\n\nAs for politics, he said he would like to “contribute to a future administration.”\n\nBut that, he said, would be up to whoever heads that administration."
