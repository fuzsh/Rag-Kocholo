        "text": "From war emerges more – why the world needs Christiane Amanpour\n\nFrom challenging presidents to holding dictators to account, Christiane Amanpour has always held true to her values of seeking out and speaking the truth. The British-Iranian journalist and global news anchor recently addressed an audience of her peers and summed up the responsibility she values in her field:\n\n“investigating wrongdoing, holding power accountable, enabling decent government, defending basic rights and actually covering the world.”\n\nChristiane Amanpour is one of the most instantly recognisable news anchors on global TV. Amanpour has covered the world’s most notable events in her now four decades of broadcasting to become one of the most distinguished journalists in her field.\n\nChief International Anchor on Cable News Network (CNN), Amanpour is best known for her first-hand coverage of global conflicts, interviews with world leaders, and hosting the eponymously-titled nightly interview programme on the news channel.\n\nAmanpour has long been a champion of freedom of expression and the role of a strong press in democracy. Amanpour has provided a constant clear-headed commentary based on her own experiences of religion as the daughter of a Catholic mother and a Shi’ite Muslim father.\n\nThe Washington Post once said of her, “where there’s a war, there’s Amanpour”. The mother of one rose to prominence during her coverage of the first Gulf War and the atrocities taking place in Bosnia before reporting on bloodshed in Afghanistan, Rwanda and Somalia.\n\nBackground\n\nBorn in Ealing, London, on January 12th 1958, Amanpour was later raised in Tehran until the age of 11. She was born to Patricia Anne Amanpour (née Hill) and Mohammad Taghi Amanpour.\n\nHer mother is English and her father was a pilot for an Iranian airline. In 1969, Amanpour returned to England to attend boarding school in Buckinghamshire and Essex.\n\nChristiane Amanpour began her broadcasting career in the news department of WBRU, a radio station based in Rhode Island during which time she completed her degree in journalism.\n\nAmanpour has spoken of her motivation to become a war correspondent as being inspired by her own experiences of the war in Iran and the subsequent Iranian revolution from which her family had fled.\n\nIn 1983, Amanpour moved to Atlanta after securing a post on the international desk at CNN. Amanpour recalls early rejections from media companies because of her Middle Eastern looks and British accent.\n\nPromoted to foreign correspondent in 1989, Amanpour was initially assigned to Frankfurt. This posting enabled her to report on the democratic revolutions suddenly sweeping Eastern Europe. It would be her work covering the Gulf War after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 that made her famous.\n\nChristiane Amanpour and the Gulf War\n\nThe television coverage of the first Gulf War revolutionised media reporting of conflict. CNN was at the forefront at a time when other American networks were intentionally making themselves absent from Baghdad. For the first time, TV cameras and reporters were broadcasting from behind enemy-lines.\n\nAmanpour’s first posting as war broke out in the Gulf was aboard an aircraft carrier. As cruise missiles were launched against Iraqi targets Amanpour and her colleagues were censored from reporting details of the military activity. So she pushed boundaries and broadcast compelling reports about what the personnel were enduring and finding stories where perhaps they shouldn’t.\n\nAmanpour has described her coverage of the crisis in Bosnia during the 1990s as her most important and significant work. Amanpour was motivated to cover the war in Bosnia out of a growing unease that the conflict was not being reported accurately in the American media.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1997, she filed one news report every day from the battlefield but also gained renown for presenting the personal stories of civilians – notably children – caught in the cross-fire.\n\nAfter an initial onslaught in which her life was put in danger several times, Amanpour took a break from the Balkans but was soon motivated to return. After seeing a camerawoman shot in the face, Amanpour said that if she didn’t go back, her fear meant she might never feel able to resume.\n\nAmanpour won multiple awards for her reporting on the Balkans and can count the Television Academy Honour, nine News and Documentary Emmy Awards, four George Foster Peabody Awards and two George Polk Awards as recognition of her work.\n\nFollowing her work in the Balkans, Amanpour’s role at CNN began to change. She has long been courted by other networks for her following from viewers, and clear personal knowledge and beliefs in obtaining stories that resonate with the public on a personal level.\n\nAmanpour became noted for her ability to question and challenge world leaders.\n\nIn 2002, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat hung up on her during a telephone interview after she questioned his inability to stop the violence surrounding him during fighting with Israel. During the Arab Spring in 2011, she was the only reporter to interview Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at his palace and she openly discussed genocide with the Dalai Lama in 2008."
