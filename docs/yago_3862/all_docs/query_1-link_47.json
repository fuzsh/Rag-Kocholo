        "text": "(1958-)\n\nWho Is Christiane Amanpour?\n\nChristiane Amanpour is considered one of television's leading news correspondents. After first gaining notice for her 1985 report on Iran, which won the DuPont Award, Amanpour has received multiple Emmys and countless other honors for her work, including several Peabody awards and an Edward R. Murrow Award. She is CNN's chief international correspondent and has worked for CBS' 60 Minutes and ABC News.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nAmanpour was born on January 12, 1958, in London, England. The daughter of an English mother and Iranian father and the oldest of four sisters, she spent time in Tehran, Iran, while growing up. An accomplished equestrian who competed as a child jockey, she was sent to a Catholic girls’ boarding school in England at 11 years old. Her world was turned upside down in 1979 when the revolution toppled the shah of Iran, spurring her family into exile and sparking Christiane’s future career interest.\n\nAs a college student, Amanpour studied journalism. After receiving a bachelor's degree from the University of Rhode Island, graduating summa cum laude, Amanpour went to work behind the cameras as an electronic graphics designer at WJAR-TV in Providence. Remaining in the city, Amanpour became a radio reporter and producer for WBRU in 1981.\n\nInternational Reporter at CNN\n\nAmanpour went to work as an assistant at the international assignment desk for CNN in 1983. Though initially facing resistance from being put on the air due to her accent and dark hair, she first gained notice for her 1985 report on her home nation of Iran, winning the DuPont Award. But it was her historical coverage of the Bosnian crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s that helped make her the internationally recognized correspondent she is today. The world also tuned in to watch her reports during the first war with Iraq, with Amanpour covering other troubled spots like Haiti, Rwanda, Somalia and Afghanistan, among other regions.\n\nAlong with her coverage of key international events, Amanpour has interviewed many of the world's top leaders, including then-British prime minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac after the attacks of September 11. She also obtained the first interview with King Abdullah of Jordan and interviewed other Middle Eastern heads of state, including Mohammad Khatami and Hosni Mubarak.\n\nAwards and Later Work\n\nAmanpour has received several awards for her journalism. She has won nine Emmys, several Peabody awards, an Edward R. Murrow Award and recognition from the Library of American Broadcasting. Besides her role as CNN's chief international correspondent, helming a number of arresting documentaries on global social issues, she has worked for CBS News on their award-winning program 60 Minutes as a reporter.\n\nIn March 2010, after 27 years, Amanpour announced her departure from CNN to ABC News, where she became the anchor of This Week, staying with the program for more than a year. She was later appointed global affairs anchor of ABC News and made a return to CNN via its international station.\n\nIn December 2017, after PBS severed professional ties with Charlie Rose over sexual harassment allegations, the organization announced that member stations had the option of rebroadcasting Amanpour's CNN International show, rebranded Amanpour on PBS, in Rose's old time slot.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAmanpour married to James Rubin, a former adviser to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in 1998. The couple has a son, Darius.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Christiane Amanpour\n\nBirth Year: 1958\n\nBirth date: January 12, 1958\n\nBirth City: London\n\nBirth Country: United Kingdom\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: London-born broadcast journalist Christiane Amanpour has covered some of the world's most newsworthy events for CNN, ABC and CBS.\n\nIndustries\n\nTelevision\n\nRadio\n\nAstrological Sign: Capricorn\n\nSchools\n\nUniversity of Rhode Island\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Christiane Amanpour Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/christiane-amanpour\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: April 8, 2021\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"
