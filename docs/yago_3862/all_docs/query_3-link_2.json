        "text": "Christiane Amanpour and husband, Jamie Rubin, are calling it quits after 20 years of marriage.\n\nThe Washington Post cited \"a friend of the pair\" that said the CNN host and her longtime partner are divorcing, though the split is \"amicable\" and \"the two remain close friends.\" The couple wed in Rome in 1998 one year after meeting in Sarajevo, Bosnia, over \"late-night margaritas.\"\n\nAmanpour, 60, and Rubin, 58, share an 18-year-old son, Darius.\n\nSee photos of the former couple together:\n\nThe Post reports that the host of CNN's \"Amanpour\" -- and the network's chief international correspondent -- currently lives in London, while Rubin recently moved to Washington, D.C. The television personality filled Charlie Rose's one-hour slot on PBS after Rose was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women and lost his jobs at both PBS and CBS.\n\nRubin used to be the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and is now reportedly writing for lobbying firm Ballard Partners.\n\nNeither Christiane Amanpour nor Jamie Rubin, who were considered to be a Washington power couple of sorts, has responded to reports of their split."
