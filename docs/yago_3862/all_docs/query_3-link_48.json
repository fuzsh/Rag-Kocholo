Our advice is that you just ignore this poster but whatever you do, don't click on any link to this putrid rag.]\n\nNi. He looks like a third rate JK Jr and she loved John John. Some guys find her British/French/Iranian mix to be hot. I honestly think she needs a makeover of sorts. She is so frumpy at times.\n\nHe used to be very hot when younger now he looks average\n\nThis is a relationship of egos. They were a ‘power couple’ back then.
