        "text": "OPC SCHOLARS\n\nRawya Rageh, 2006 Dan Eldon scholar, is a senior crisis adviser for Amnesty International where she is investigating human rights abuses and war crimes in situations of emergencies. A former reporter for Al Jazeera English, she was at the center of AJE’s coverage of the Egyptian uprising in 2011. Her reporting of the events was named one of the top 50 stories produced by graduates of Columbia Journalism School during its first 100 years of operation.\n\n2001 Reuters Fellowship winner Lingling Wei landed a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal on Nov. 17 about the 8-year low in the yuan, which many analysts tie to efforts by the Chinese government to combat economic sluggishness. Wei covers Chinese finance from The Wall Street Journal’s Beijing bureau.\n\nThe New York Times carried a front-page story from 2007 Stan Swinton scholar Ben Hubbard on Nov. 14 about the devastating airstrikes in Yemen being carried out by U.S.-trained pilots using American weaponry. Hubbard, the Times’ Middle East correspondent, reports that the Saudi-led campaign is raising accusations of war crimes amid a burgeoning humanitarian crisis.\n\nLevi Bridges, the 2016 Swinton winner, filed a story for Public Radio International about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s broken promises to give sanctuary to Ukrainians after the war. Bridges developed the story while working as an OPC Foundation fellow in the AP’s Moscow bureau.\n\nDake Kang, the 2016 Fritz Beebe winner, has started an OPC Foundation fellowship in the Associated Press bureau in Bangkok. He filed a story on Dec. 1 about Vitit Muntarbhorn, the first U.N. expert charged to look into violence and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\n\nWINNERS\n\nOPC Foundation board member and OPC member Nicholas Schifrin has won a 2017 Ochberg Fellowship from the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism. The weeklong program offers journalists the opportunity to “explore the many dimensions of psychological trauma; to discuss ethical and craft challenges raised by their work; and to forge relationships with colleagues who share their interests and commitment.” Schifrin is a special correspondent at PBS NewsHour.\n\nOPC member Nisid Hajari’s Midnight’s Furies was shortlisted for the Shakti Bhatt First Book Prize, an award for first books published by Indian authors. The book examines the bloodshed around the 1947 partition of India. Hajari is the Asia Editor for Bloomberg View, and writes about Asian politics, history and economics.\n\nUPDATES\n\nNEW YORK: John Daniszewski, vice president for standards for The Associated Press, has issued guidance on how to handle the term “alt-right.” Daniszewski, an OPC member, says it should be used within quotation marks and must always be accompanied by a definition, such as “an offshoot of conservatism mixing racism, white nationalism and populism” or “a white nationalist movement.” He warns that the term should not be used generically because it “may exist primarily as a public-relations device to make its supporters’ actual beliefs less clear and more acceptable to a broader audience.”\n\nOPC affiliate member Brion Tingler is the new head of external affairs for Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Tingler previously worked in senior communications roles for Lenovo, and will continue to be based in New York.\n\nOPC member Patricia Milton’s recent documentary for 60 Minutes focused on Americans who are lured overseas to fight for ISIS. “It kind of takes control of you. And you think you’re doing something for a greater cause. And you think you’re doing it for good,” one Minneapolis teenager told three-time OPC award-winner Scott Pelley, after finding Islamic extremism through online videos. Milton is a senior producer with the CBS News Investigative Unit. She previously spent two decades at the Associated Press.\n\nNews outlets including The Washington Post, the Huffington Post and Newsday have turned to OPC member and Stony Brook University lecturer Richard Hornik as an expert source on the “fake news” that fueled Donald Trump’s presidential win. Hornik, who works at the university’s Center for News Literacy, says news consumers need to understand that “If something seems too weird, too funny, too perfect,” it probably is – and that placing high on a list of Google search results is no guarantee of a story’s authenticity. Hornik spent more than 20 years at TIME Inc., including stints as bureau chief in Warsaw, Boston and Beijing.\n\nThomson Reuters announced on Nov. 1 that it would cut 2,000 non-news jobs at its locations around the globe. The losses amount to a 4 percent cut in the company’s workforce of 48,000. “It’s about simplification and taking out bureaucracy and taking out layers, all of which have added complexity and slowed us down,” said Reuters president and CEO Jim Smith in a Reuters interview. “These actions are not driven by any reaction to market conditions or in any way coming on the back of underperformance.”\n\nPROVIDENCE, R. I.: Brown University’s alumni magazine has high praise for 1980 graduate and OPC member Alissa J. Rubin of The New York Times. When you’re reading one of her reports, the magazine writes, “you might feel as if you’re reading a short story. That’s how vividly she portrays the characters and settings.” Rubin focused on Renaissance studies and classics at Brown and says she sees parallels between her work and the ancient Greeks: Antigone, for example, “is a play about the need to go through burial rites. Think of all the wars in which people have wanted to find their children and bury them.”\n\nWASHINGTON, DC: President Barack Obama has nominated OPC member Markos Kounalakis to the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy. According to the State Department’s website, the commission is tasked with “appraising activities intended to understand, inform, and influence foreign publics and to increase the understanding of, and support for, these same activities.” Kounalakis is a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and president and publisher emeritus of the Washington Monthly. He previously reported for Newsweek and NBC Radio in Eastern Europe, the USSR and Afghanistan.\n\n2011 Lowell Thomas Award winner Lourdes Garcia-Navarro is taking on a new role at NPR. In January, the South America correspondent will replace Rachel Martin as the host of Weekend Edition Sunday, the network has announced. Garcia-Navarro has been with NPR since 2004, reporting from Israel, Iraq, Brazil and Mexico.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio: If you think fact-checking only reinforces people’s existing biases, better check your facts. A new study says the so-called “backfire effect,” wherein people believe an idea more strongly after it’s been debunked, is actually quite rare. “By and large, folks across the political spectrum were happy to move, at least some of the way, consistently with a factual intervention,” lead researcher Thomas Wood of Ohio State University told Poynter.org. The research was presented at the American Political Science Association this summer.\n\nBOSTON: As Harvard Business Review trims its annual print output from 10 editions to six, OPC member Adi Ignatius is helping redefine the magazine for the digital age. According to the Nieman Lab blog, HBR is planning “six new online series, each of which will be a multi-day, multimedia package organized around a single concept.” It hopes to use these deep dives to attract a new generation of readers – and subscribers. The print product is still doing well, “but we’re also not idiots,” Ignatius tells Nieman.“We’re just trying to get ahead of how people consume things.”\n\nSANTA MONICA, Calif.: A director has been chosen for the upcoming film version of OPC governor Charles Graeber’s book, The Good Nurse. According to deadline.com, Danish director Tobias Lindholm will helm the Lionsgate production. The book tells the story of serial killer nurse Charlie Cullen, who may have taken the lives of as many as 300 patients over 16 years in New Jersey and Pennsylvania hospitals.\n\nMIAMI: When Fidel Castro died in late November, the Miami Herald was ready. “We’ve been planning for this story longer than some of the people covering it have been alive,” managing editor Rick Hirsch told Poynter.org. The “Cuba Plan” has been dusted off and updated many times over the years – the periodic eruption of Castro-is-dead rumors always provided a useful reminder – and like the industry itself it gradually moved from a print-focused to a digital-first approach. The stories and opinion pieces “reflect the emotional outpouring” of the moment, Poynter’s Al Tompkins wrote, and offer a rich range of viewpoints and experiences.\n\nDHAKA: OPC member Hasan Mahmud was recently honored with an international pin by former Lions Club governor Abdul Halim Patwary. Mahmud has served as president of the Dhaka Delkus Green Lions Club since 2015. He is the editor of the national Sunday Line weekly newspaper.\n\nTORONTO: OPC member Simcha Jacobovici’s Associated Producers is teaming with Keshet Studios and producer Robert Lantos on a 10-hour television series about Kabbalah. According to Variety magazine, “Kabbalah” will focus on “10 different moments in history where major players were adherents of the ancient mystical practice, including some of the U.S. founding fathers during the American Revolution and Michelangelo during his painting of the Sistine Chapel.”\n\nLONDON: Has the world stopped caring about mass murder? OPC member Andrew Nagorski raises that question in a recent opinion piece for Reuters. Nagorski contrasts the silence that greeted the AP’s revelation of mass graves in Iraq and Syria to the shock people felt over the revelation of Nazi death camps at the end of World War II. He blames the lack of outrage on an “inability to focus” on such stories for longer than a news cycle. Nagorski spent more than three decades as a foreign correspondent and editor for Newsweek, based in Berlin, Rome, Moscow, Warsaw and Hong Kong. His latest book is The Nazi Hunters.\n\nTOKYO: Motoko Rich began her new role as The New York Times Tokyo bureau chief in August. Rich previously covered education for the Times.\n\nChanges continue at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan as the organization wrestles with a steep decline in the number of Western correspondents. Freelancer Peter Langan has resigned as president to take a position in Hong Kong. New president Khaldon Azhari, the founder of U.S.-based Pan Orient News, wrote in November that he was taking a fresh look at the club’s proposed move to new quarters.\n\nPEOPLE REMEMBERED\n\nPioneering journalist Ruth Gruber died at her home in Manhattan on Nov. 17 at age 105. Gruber covered Stalin’s gulags, the Nazi trials at Nuremberg and the plight of Jewish refugees in the aftermath of World War II. Gruber joined the OPC in March 1958 and remained a member until her death. In 2009, she received the inaugural Fay Gillis Wells Award, given in honor of one of the OPC founders, to a female journalist of exceptional achievement. Gruber is survived by her son, David Michaels, an assistant secretary of labor in the Obama administration; daughter Celia Michaels, a former CBS News editor; two stepdaughters, Jeri Drucker and Elaine Rosner-Jeria; nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.\n\nPBS NewsHour co-host Gwen Ifill died on Nov. 14 at age 61 in Washington, DC. Ifill served as co-anchor and co-managing editor of PBS NewsHour with Judy Woodruff, forming the first all-female anchor team on network nightly news. Before coming to PBS in 1999, she worked for the Washington Post, The New York Times and NBC. Ifill was scheduled to receive the John Chancellor Award on Nov. 16. The award, given out by the Columbia Journalism School, honors lifetime achievement in journalism.\n\nLongtime NPR and BBC foreign correspondent Alan Tomlinson died in Miami on Nov. 26. He was 69 years old. Tomlinson covered Central America and the Caribbean, reporting on the civil war in El Salvador and unrest in Haiti. He and colleagues from NPR received the OPC’s Ben Grauer Award for their reporting on Haiti. In the mid-1990s he shifted his focus to television, producing documentaries on topics ranging from Ebola to street music. “The combination of his wit, friendliness, and perfectionism is what created the fuel that ignited Alan’s storytelling genius,” said John Labonia, general manager of Miami public television station WLRN, where Tomlinson had worked since 2013.\n\nReporter and editor Dileep Padgaonkar died on Nov. 25 in Pune, in the Indian state of Maharashtra, at age 72. Padgaonkar got his start in journalism in 1968 as the Times of India’s Paris correspondent. From 1978 to 1986, he worked at Unesco in Bangkok and Paris. He was awarded the Legion d’Honneur, France’s highest civilian distinction, in 2002 for his service to journalism. In 2010 he was appointed by the Indian government to a three-person panel to develop a roadmap to peace in Kashmir, traveling the region extensively and speaking to thousands of people.\n\nTatiana Hoffman, a longtime international affairs reporter, editor and host at Israel’s Channel 2, has died at age 69 in Jerusalem.

She became a foreign correspondent for Israel Radio, moving to Channel 2 in 1993.\n\nFormer Philadelphia Inquirer reporter John P. “Jack” Corr died on Nov. 20 at age 82, in Rittenhouse, Pennsylvania. Corr started as a copyboy at the Inquirer and worked his way up to feature reporter and foreign correspondent. He reported from Belfast, Northern Ireland; Pretoria, South Africa; and the Vatican.\n\nOPC SCHOLARS\n\nEmily Witt, who won the Flora Lewis Memorial Scholarship in 2009, has been getting a lot of press for her new book. Future Sex explores the online and offline sexual subcultures, from orgasmic meditation to Kink.com to polyamorous weddings. “Witt is as thoughtful as she is audacious” writes Vogue’s Julia Felsenthal, “and Future Sex is ultimately a carefully crafted literary and intellectual endeavor.”\n\nTess Taylor, winner of the 2004 Harper’s Magazine Scholarship in honor of I.F. Stone, recently published her second book of poetry. Work & Days, from Red Hen Press, is a cycle of 28 poems following the rhythms of life and work on a farm.

Freedman scholar Marina Walker Guevara, who helmed the massive Panama Papers investigation at the International Center for Investigative Journalism. Guevara received a special citation from Columbia University’s Maria Moors Cabot Prize for the project, which the prize committee said “prompted a much needed debate about transparency and accountability in the region and around the world.” She was also honored with the Susan Talalay Award for Outstanding Journalism from the Alfred Friendly Foundation. The Panama Papers consisted of 11.5 million leaked documents from offshore entities, showing where the world’s richest individuals and companies sheltered their wealth. Guevera is deputy director of the ICIJ.\n\nWINNERS\n\nOPC member Alissa J. Rubin made what she called a “heartfelt plea” to news organizations to keep funding war reporting in her acceptance speech for the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award for courageous journalism on Oct. 24. “It’s expensive, it’s dangerous and it’s scary, but it also is at the heart of the journalistic mission,” she told the audience at Maine’s Colby College, which gives out the annual award. Rubin is the Paris bureau chief for The New York Times; she previously served as chief of the Kabul bureau and deputy chief of the Baghdad bureau.\n\nAssociated Press photographer Rodrigo Abd has won the 2016 Maria Moors Cabot Prize, recognizing excellence in coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean. Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, which awards the prize, said in a statement that Abd had worked with “untiring commitment and uncommon empathy” to create “close-up images of people in Latin America that illuminate urgent social issues.” Abd won the OPC’s Feature Photography Award in 2010 and 2015.\n\nUPDATES\n\nNEW YORK: Former OPC president Alexis Gelber is the new editor in chief of Straus News, which publishes 17 weekly newspapers websites in contiguous towns in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

He has previously held top editorial positions at Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and TIME, and will continue in his current role as vice chairman of Time Inc.\n\nAli Velshi, an OPC member and former anchor at CNN and Al\n\nJazeera America, has joined MSNBC. “Ali’s sharp economic analysis will be a valuable asset” to the news channel, wrote MSNBC president Phil Griffin in a memo to staff, citing Velshi’s “unique mix of experience and perspective on both domestic and international issues.”\n\nOPC member Lydia Tomkiw reports she is now “spending a lot of time in glass towers in midtown” after moving into financial journalism from breaking news. She is covering the hedge fund industry for the Financial Times’ property FundFire. Tomkiw has previously reported from Ukraine and Indonesia for outlets including the Christian Science Monitor, Foreign Policy, The Smithsonian, International Business Times and Nieman Journalism Lab.\n\nThe New York Times has tapped Jim Yardley as its next Europe editor. Yardley was previously the paper’s Rome bureau chief. He shared the Whitman Bassow award in 2007 with colleagues at the Times for reporting on the environmental impacts of development in China, and shared a citation for the OPC Bob Considine Award in 2005. The Times has also moved foreign desk editor Greg Winter to deputy international editor.\n\nThe formerly newspaper-centric Pulitzer Prize has opened all of its journalism categories to print and online magazines. The decision caps a gradual process that has seen two categories accept magazine entries in 2015, and five this year. “The broad expansion of digital journalism has led to a growing overlap in the work and roles of newspapers, digital-only news sites, and magazines,” said Joyce Dehli, co-chair of the Pulitzer board. The prize is also dropping its traditional application letter in favor of a Q and A format tailored to each category.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal sought a “substantial number of buyouts” in October in an effort to limit layoffs, editor in chief Gerard Baker told employees in a memo obtained by various news organizations. The option was offered to all news employees worldwide. The paper has also announced a “broader review of operations” to “rebalance revenue streams” in light of declining revenues from print advertising. A revamped design with some consolidation of sections is expected to launch in the next few weeks.\n\nWOODBURY, Conn.: After 47 years of international living and 34 years in Belgium, longtime OPC member Jonathan Kapstein retired and moved to Connecticut in August.

He remains on the PCBE board with a special assignment to coordinate with similar North American press groups such as the OPC. Jonathan also continues as a vice president of the International Federation of Press Clubs.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC: Jeffrey Goldberg is the new editor in chief of The Atlantic – becoming just the 14th person to occupy that spot since 1857. Atlantic Media chairman David G. Bradley announced the hiring after an extensive search. “It is fair to say that, together, we met a great deal of the nation’s top editorial talent,” Bradley wrote to the magazine’s employees. “But, at least for us, Jeff is something set apart.” Goldberg won the 2003 Joe and Laurie Dine Award. He has been a correspondent for the magazine since 2001 and has also written for The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine and New York magazine.\n\nOPC Governor Hannah Allam recently broke the inside story of what happened to three U.S. contractors who were kidnapped in Iraq early this year. The three say they were shackled and beaten by a militia led by longtime U.S. foe Muqtada al Sadr. They accuse the Iraqi government of inventing a widely-reported story that they were kidnapped in a brothel in order to distract from the fact that it took Baghdad a month to secure their release. Waiel El-Maadawy decided to speak out because he wants the U.S. to seek compensation from Iraq. “We were beaten and tortured for 31 days,” Waiel El-Maadawy told Allam. “We want the Iraqi government to take responsibility for a crime that was unjustified and unwarranted.”\n\nMinky Worden attended the Sporting Chance Forum in mid-October, where she rubbed elbows with tennis great Martina Navratilova.

Worden, an OPC member and director of Global Initiatives at Human Rights Watch, moderated a panel on mega-sporting events at the OPC in September.\n\nThe Newspaper Association of America has changed its name to the News Media Alliance and begun accepting digital-only publications as members.

The organization had stopped updating revenue numbers for the industry in 2013.\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo.: The American Society of News Editors is also changing to reflect the ascendance of digital. The organization has announced it will now use web traffic numbers, rather than print circulation, to set its membership fees. It has also adopted a new lower-priced membership level for news executives who are not in top positions at their companies, in an effort to reach out to up-and-coming leaders of the industry.\n\nSEATTLE: Getty Images has launched a new agency called Verbatim to represent its photographers to commercial clients. The venture will channel a percentage of its profits into photojournalism projects. OPC Third Vice President Pancho Bernasconi, vice president of news, Americas, will be one of two executives overseeing Getty Images Reportage, which will house the agency’s Emerging Talents program.\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla.: A new global code of principals promotes fairness, transparency and non-partisanship among fact-checking organizations.

It has been endorsed by 39 organizations, including Africa Check, South Asia Check, Politifact and Snopes.\n\nTORONTO: A film produced by OPC member Kathy Eldon premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September. “The Journey Is The Destination” is based on journals left by her son, photojournalist Dan Eldon, who was killed by an angry crowd in Somalia while documenting the aftermath of a U.S. bombing in 1993. “My great desire is that this film will be a spark to ignite a movement of young people and the young-at-heart to believe they have a role to play in changing the world around them,” Eldon told a Reuters reporter following the premiere.\n\nCALAIS, France: “The Jungle has been the worst of all the journey, because this is Europe,” a teenage migrant tells OPC Governor Vivienne Walt at the infamous refugee camp perched on the English Channel. “When we hear about Europe in our country, we think about democracy, we think they will protect us.” Walt’s recent stories from the camp have painted a vivid picture of the frustrations migrants have faced living in tents and shacks in The Jungle while trying to get into England. The camp is now being closed and its occupants dispersed, mostly to locations in Britain and France.\n\nLONDON: The BBC World Service radio program, Witness, is working on an episode about legendary photojournalist and OPC member Dicky Chapelle.

She frequently traveled with troops and was known for her fearlessness.\n\nPARIS: OPC member and renowned photo editor John G. Morris will celebrate his 100th birthday with an open house at his home in Paris in December. Morris worked with such giants of photojournalism as Robert Capa, W. Eugene Smith, and Henri Cartier-Bresson, telling stories from D-Day, the Vietnam War and countless other hotspots around the globe. He has lived in Paris since 1983.\n\nMUMBAI: “I have consciously tried to create a mix of photographs which are of social relevance – be it about the environment or about taboo topics such as homosexuality,” OPC member Chirag Wakaskar tells The Floating Magazine in a recent feature about Everyday Mumbai, an Instagram account he curates. Wakaskar, an independent photographer, says he also looks for photos that going beyond a tourist’s-eye view of the city and that reflect the photographer’s “personal thoughts and opinions.” Everday Mumbai has more than 100,000 followers.\n\nSYDNEY: Jason Motlagh, co-winner of the 2014 Madeline Dane Ross Award, spent 12 days crossing the notorious Darién Gap with a film crew for the Dateline program on Australia’s SBS network. The Darién is a 10,000-square-mile wilderness spanning the border between Colombia and Panama. As other routes into the U.S. have become more difficult, more people are taking a chance on this grueling and dangerous trip through mountains and rainforest. SBS negotiated for months with FARC rebels, who control access to the most direct path through the gap, to secure safe passage for the crew. The story aired in September.\n\nPEOPLE REMEMBERED\n\nRichard P. O’Mara, a foreign correspondent and foreign editor for the Baltimore Sun, died on Oct. 27 in Towson, Maryland at the age of 80. O’Mara held numerous positions with The Sun in the ‘60s and ‘70s, including chief of the Rio de Janeiro bureau. In 1979 he began a 12-year stint as foreign editor, then served as London correspondent for three years. “Rich O’Mara was a very graceful writer who could take mundane stories and make them interesting,” retired foreign correspondent Robert A. Erlandson told The Sun. “He was an example of The Sun at its best.”\n\nOPC SCHOLARS\n\nAfter several years with Bloomberg in Japan, Jacob Adelman, 2005 HL Stevenson winner, has returned to his hometown of Philadelphia where he is now a staff writer for the Inquirer covering real estate, urbanism and commercial development. He also covered real estate and land-use issues for the Associated Press in its Los Angeles bureau.\n\n1998 Reuters Scholarship winner Kristina Shevory published a long piece in Playboy in August about Afghanistan’s commando units. These specially-trained fighters receive higher pay and are meant to be better-supplied than the regular Afghan National Army. After traveling with commandos in the field, however, Shevory reports that the elite units are stretched thin, especially for the job of facing enemies like Islamic State. A longtime freelancer, Shevory has written for The New York Times, The Atlantic, Foreign Policy, Newsweek and other outlets. She has previously worked for The Associated Press, the Seattle Times and TheStreet.com.\n\nJ.p. Lawrence, who won the H.L.

The New York Times won in the Breaking News category for its coverage of the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris. Pro Publica and the Virginian-Pilot won in Topical Reporting for their coverage of the long-term effects of Agent Orange exposure on US Navy veterans. The massive Panama Papers project, led by the Center for Public Integrity’s International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and Süddeutsche Zeitung, claimed an Al Neuharth Innovation in Investigative Journalism Award. The Intercept’s reporting on Obama’s drone warfare program in Afghanistan earned a University of Florida Award for Investigative Data Journalism.\n\nUPDATES\n\nNEW YORK: CNN Digital has hired former OPC President Marcus Mabry as its next director. Mabry was previously at Twitter, where he oversaw its Moments platform; before that, he held several editorial roles at The New York Times. He led OPC’s Board of Governors from 2014 to 2016.\n\nTweets will now be subject to the same review and correction standards as other published materials, The Associated Press announced in September after a tweet about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton came under fire. OPC member John Daniszewski, the agency’s vice president for standards, wrote that “whether to delete or update tweets” had previously been left to news managers to decide on a case-by-case basis. The new rules “require removal and correction of any AP tweets found not to meet AP standards.”\n\nWhen OPC member Lucy Westcott reached out online in search of stories of sexual harassment in journalism, she was soon “inundated with recollections of inappropriate jokes, comments on race and appearance, and unwanted touching and worse.” Westcott wrote about these reports, and her own experience of harassment, for Newsweek in August – after Roger Ailes resigned from FOX News due to harassment allegations. Westcott noted that journalists face dangers both in the office and on the job. Many continue working with their harassers because, as one victim said, “It feels so dangerous to burn bridges in journalism.”\n\nIn his latest film for PBS FRONTLINE, OPC governor Martin Smith returns to his investigation of for-profit colleges.

In an email to staff, the company said “seismic shifts in the business model are adversely impacting our revenues.”\n\nFormer OPC governor Peter S. Goodman landed a front-page story in The New York Times in late September.

She previously held the position in 2013-2014. Keith Bradsher, Hong Kong bureau chief for The New York Times, was elected First Vice-President. In a letter from the president in The Correspondent magazine, Joseph said the club planned to refurbish its headquarters and ramp up its social media efforts.

Senior editor Caitlin Roper describes Callimachi’s use of social media to inform her reporting on ISIS and calls her “arguably the best reporter on the most impor­tant beat in the world.” Callimachi says she uses Twitter and the encrypted app Telegram to better understand the group. While she’s received pushback from readers and editors who feel she is giving ISIS a voice, she argues that “my reporting doesn’t deny that they’re perpetrating crimes against humanity, but I think that our job as journalists is to understand and to bring gray where there is only black and white. Because there’s always gray.”\n\nOPC member Norman Pearlstine is now vice chairman at Time Inc., focusing on “international growth opportunities for the company’s brands and content.” He previously served as Time’s executive vice president and chief content officer, after a stint as chief content officer at Bloomberg L.P.

He added, however, that the Times is adapting and that “this may result in changes in the size and shape of our operation, changes that we are committed to keeping you informed about.” At least 49 journalists accepted buyout offers from the paper in July.\n\nNow that CEO Roger Ailes has departed under a cloud of sexual harassment allegations, are changes ahead at Fox News? Anousha Sakoui of Bloomberg notes that the network’s aging audience will likely push it to diversify its programming to broaden its base.

The military then shelled the site, killing Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik. The wrongful-death lawsuit seeks punitive and compensatory damages. Colvin spent 26 years covering wars around the world and was known for her bravery.\n\nATLANTA: CNN has launched a new division devoted to aerial drones. CNN AIR, as it’s called, has already generated footage for numerous stories, including coverage of the Flint lead crisis and the Republican national convention. “We were able to show perspective, breadth and scope,” CNN’s Greg Agvent told Poynter.org. “We’re able to use the drone to capture things that you simply cannot capture from a helicopter, which would create that much more noise and cost you that much more money.”\n\nROCHESTER, NH: The James W. Foley Freedom Run honors the legacy of freelancer James Foley, who was murdered by ISIS in 2014.

A protege of pioneering candid photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, Riboud roamed the world for decades, shooting trouble spots but almost always focusing on ordinary people rather than the powerful. His iconic images include one of a laborer painting the Eiffel Tower, framed by iron beams, and one of a young woman presenting a flower to rifle-wielding National Guard members at a Vietnam War protest. “He was comfortable with any subject,” Jean-François Leroy, founder of the Visa pour l’Image photojournalism festival, told Time magazine, “and even 50 years later, his work has not aged one bit.”\n\nFormer New York Times reporter Sydney H.

Jennings is an independent producer and director for PBS FRONTLINE. He’ll study new nonfiction storytelling techniques, including virtual reality, and the need for updated ethical standards in documentary product\n\nUPDATES\n\nNEW YORK: Lack of economic diversity poses a threat to photojournalism, OPC Governor Paul Moakley told Time Magazine in a May 4 article. “Many people I encounter from non-Ivy League schools are stifled by not having a path to break through,” said Moakley, Time’s deputy director of photography. “It is very elitist in a sense, and we have to be careful about that as editors, as curators and as photographers.” While little is known about the economic backgrounds of the world’s news photographers, a recent World Press Photo report found nearly 65 percent of the photographers surveyed originated from Europe and North America, and only 15 percent were women.\n\nAssociated Press standards editor Tom Kent is celebrating a long-planned retirement – while taking on a new role as president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

Bernasconi is vice president for editorial at Getty Images and was a longtime editor of Hondros’ work.\n\nTwo years after changing their rules to allow certain magazines to enter five journalism categories, the Pulitzer Prizes will likely continue to evolve, says administrator Mike Pride. “Two questions we are asking ourselves are: How well and how fairly can our juries judge the works of various media – newspapers, news sites, magazines – against one another?” he told Poynter.org in a recent interview. “How well does journalism from various media fit our Plan of Award and categories?” But, Pride concluded, “further expansion is probable.” This year The New Yorker became the first magazine to win a Pulitzer, taking home awards in both the feature writing and criticism categories.\n\nIreland’s 1916 Easter Rising was a watershed in the history of foreign correspondence, OPC Governor Liam Stack wrote recently in The New York Times. Even though communication links between Dublin and London had been cut, the Times printed more than 50 stories about the five-day rebellion. The paper supplemented the news from Ireland by talking to Irish-American leaders and people who had recently returned from the country. “We talk about technology allowing us to do things so quickly in journalism today, but here is a major story on an event that leads the Sunday magazine of the paper the week that it occurred,” Dr. Robert Schmuhl of the University of Notre Dame tells Stack, calling that a “pretty amazing” accomplishment.\n\nPHILADELPHIA: NPR’S Deborah Amos, an OPC Governor, was the master of ceremonies for this year’s Eisenhower Awards.

Katz is currently writer in residence at Duke University’s John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute.\n\nLOS ANGELES: Journalists are in “a war to continue to tell the truth,” OPC member Christiane Amanpour told a audience at the annual Daniel Pearl Memorial Lecture at UCLA.

Amanpour, CNN’s chief foreign correspondent, was a friend of the slain Wall Street Journal reporter and is a longtime supporter of the Daniel Pearl Foundation.\n\nTransfixed, a documentary co-produced by OPC member Felix Golubev, debuted this spring in Los Angeles and New York.
