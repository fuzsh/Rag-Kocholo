        "text": "Last week U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin announced he would leave his job in April to join his wife, CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, in London. The couple is expecting their first child in the early spring. Rubin spoke with NEWSWEEK's diplomatic correspondent Michael Hirsh about his decision. Excerpts:\n\nI really don't know. I've been kidding the secretary that it's going to be interesting to try to remember where the government's views end and my views start.\n\nThere is often increased focus on terrible humanitarian disasters... I think that there's no question that journalists' coverage of the Bosnia conflict helped to galvanize the world to act. I think that some of those lessons were drawn and in the next similar case, Kosovo, action was taken much earlier.\n\nIt would be unlikely in the extreme that we didn't talk on the phone. But I don't think I'll play any role of any formal sort."
