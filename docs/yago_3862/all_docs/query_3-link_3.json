        "text": "The Washington Post cited \"a friend of the pair\" that said the CNN host and her longtime partner are divorcing, though the split is \"amicable\" and \"the two remain close friends.\" The couple wed in Rome in 1998 one year after meeting in Sarajevo, Bosnia, over \"late-night margaritas.\"\n\nAmanpour, 60, and Rubin, 58, share an 18-year-old son, Darius. The Post reports that the host of CNN's \"Amanpour\" -- and the network's chief international correspondent -- currently lives in London, while Rubin recently moved to Washington, D.C. The television personality filled Charlie Rose's one-hour slot on PBS after Rose was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women and lost his jobs at both PBS and CBS.\n\nRubin used to be the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and is now reportedly writing for lobbying firm Ballard Partners.\n\nNeither Christiane Amanpour nor Jamie Rubin, who were considered to be a Washington power couple of sorts, has responded to reports of their split.\n\nYea this isn't surprising. First off, she went to URI not Brown - have no idea how she ended up living with JFK Jr in Providence. She was very courageous to have lived and reported from sarajevo. She's better at live shots then interviewing. She took over for This Week was it? and she flopped. Her show onPBS is unbearable with her overdone accent - having heard her in person it is not as pronounced as on air - and behaving as though she is more informed than those she interviews. The biggest obstacle with people like CA is that are a pain in the ass, coddled, minimally talented news readers - they dont create the news - they report on it being made. What happens is they get so caught up in being part of it they forget their role and attempt to eclipse. Having seen her in several social settings she is the type who is always looking over the shoulder of who she is speaking to - looking for the more important person. And, apart from her being a witness to astounding political events , there's not much else there, as is with a majority of reporters. They want to be part of something more than themselves to distract from their limited interpersonal social skills. There truly is nothing more boring than a roomful of reporters - they are purely selfish - and then attempt to be an expert on things told them by the experts. CA had her time but then it was realized she had limitations that didn't translate. And Christ all mighty Jamie looks like Melissa erhridge with bad hair\n\nI'm r15 one more thing: the article mentioned they met in Bosnia over \"late night margaritas\" is so typical. Never trust a reporter as they are always attempting to get something from you so more than likely she entered this relationship over late night margaritas to engage him and provide her with information with the understanding there would be sex. Guys in government are dorks; reporters - male and female - are vultures and will do whatever it takes to get a story. And, no doubt, CA and Jamie shared the story of how their love flowered while drinking margaritas and noms were dropping overhead to add to their war torn romantic coupling. Amd, reporters are exclusionary: when within a group, especially CA \" when I was in Cairo, when I was being shot at in Beirut, Arafat told me\" this is what she/they are like - to always let you know they know or experienced or have an in that you never will - meamwhile, they are told simply pawns, messengers who act as though they were chosen - it truly is a life of ducked up dynamics and they lose themselves in pretending otherwise. I truly believe in the power of journalism and the truth it reveals - and I hope beyond anything it brings this current administration down, but the people who report on it are equally if not more ducked up than what they're reporting\n\nThank you, R23, perfect explanation. R5 again. Saw them both in action in Bosnia. Don’t know where the hell they found margaritas - probably at an IFOR base. He was demanding and whiny, really arrogant to people who were busting their asses to help him with very few resources. She was sneaking around the embassy like a cat, always trying to get into places where she didn’t belong, trying to poke through documents, etc., and then acting like we should be honored to be in her presence. No, lady - get the hell out of here. Everyone was disgusted when they started hooking up - it was a total conflict of interest on his part, with no consequences. Well, until Albright left and he was out in the cold."
