        "text": "Amid the medieval splendor of a hilltop fortress 30 miles north of Rome, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin and CNN star correspondent Christiane Amanpour exchanged wedding vows Saturday in a celebration where, for once, personal priorities triumphed over matters of state and the demands of journalism.\n\nIn back-to-back Catholic and Jewish ceremonies, the power couple sealed a union that was kindled 15 months ago over late-night margaritas in Sarajevo and that later flourished during the course of whirlwind weekend trysts and countless trans-Atlantic phone calls.\n\nOver a four-course dinner that followed the ceremony in a banquet hall filled with busts of Roman generals, Rubin said meeting Amanpour finally resolved his arduous quest to find a soul mate who would represent his \"other half.\" Amanpour said she felt the same way, but wanted her spouse to know he should not harbor any illusions about wifely obedience.\n\nThe difficulty in fitting marriage into their hectic work schedules _ which will keep the couple shuttling between London and Washington _ was highlighted on the eve of the wedding by the terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa.\n\nSensing that Rubin might be torn between professional and marital loyalties, U.N. Ambassador-designate Richard Holbrooke had offered to serve as Rubin's stand-in at the nuptials if his presence were required in Washington. Rubin's boss, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, had flown into Rome early Friday hoping to attend the wedding of her trusted consigliere. But after learning about the devastation wrought by the bombings, Albright turned around after spending only five hours on the ground and flew back to Washington to deal with the attacks.\n\nThe wedding drew 250 friends and family members. On Amanpour's side of the aisle were Tom Johnson and Gerald Levin, chief executives at CNN and Time Warner. Friends from ABC, Robert Iger and Willow Bay, attended along with college chum John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Carolyn.\n\nIn Rubin's corner were senior White House political adviser Sidney Blumenthal and deputy national security adviser James Steinberg."
