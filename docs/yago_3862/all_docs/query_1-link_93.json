Three years ago, she settled for marriage and motherhood with James Rubin, former assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration. The Sunday Times of India caught up with Amanpour to find out how it feels to report on the first war of the millennium: Did CNN correspondents get any warning about the air strikes? If yes, how much? We got no official warning, though for days there had been a âbuzzâ that something was âimminentâ.\n\nan inveterate traveller in the course of her work, she has reported for cnn from iran, haiti, algeria and rwanda. three years ago, she settled for marriage and motherhood with james rubin, former assistant secretary of state in the clinton administration. the sunday times of india caught up with amanpour to find out how it feels to report on the first war of the millennium: did cnn correspondents get any warning about the air strikes? if yes, how much? we got no official warning, though for days there had been a 'buzz' that something was 'imminent'. cnn was in a position to cover all possible angles, given our vast news-coverage infrastructure overseas and in the us. you're on the ground at the moment, though still far from the actual frontline. how easy is it to get seduced by the media feeding frenzy, which charges off behind one story and one conclusion because it seems the obvious one? have there been any instances in the last three weeks where you found yourself correcting preconceived notions about pakistan or islam? i do not believe we are 'charging off' behind a story. this is obviously a huge story, both militarily, politically and in its humanitarian dimension. it also involves almost all our network's resources. since we have so many people stationed around the world for years, we are among the best equipped to cover these complex stories, as well as being less subject to 'preconceived notions'. i personally have covered the world for more than a decade and that experience enables me to recognise stereotypes and avoid them. do you find this war different from the others you've covered so far? this is different because we are unable to be in taliban-controlled afghanistan, the centre of gravity of this story right now. this is obviously a great disadvantage when seeking to report on the impact of the current action. however, there are many other aspects of the story from diplomatic, political and humanitarian angle, which i think we are covering well. is terminology more crucial in this conflict? words are always crucial. they matter and have consequences. i'm always very mindful of that. what has changed for you now that you're a wife and a mother. does that constrict you when you're required to travel to conflict-ridden areas? did you pause for thought this time round? it's much much more difficult and emotional for me to fly off since i became a mother. my son is 18 months old and of course i miss him tremendously. however, i am committed to covering these monumental world events. i feel, i have insight and experience that can help shed light on these complexities and so i feel that is useful. fortunately, my husband does not travel as much as i do. rashmee z. ahmed\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA"
