        "text": "Christiane Amanpour, the chief international correspondent for CNN, was married yesterday to James Phillip Rubin, the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs.\n\nThe Rev. Ambrose O'Farrell, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at the Church of Santo Stefano in Bracciano, Italy. Later in the day, Rabbi Guy D. Hall performed a Jewish ceremony at Castello Orsini-Odescalchi.\n\nThe bride, 40, is a contributing correspondent, based in London, to ''60 Minutes,'' the CBS news magazine. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of Rhode Island, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Ms. Amanpour, who is keeping her name, is a daughter of Patricia and Mohammad Amanpour of Surrey, England. Her father is a retired airline executive who worked in Teheran, Iran.\n\nMr. Rubin, 38, is known as Jamie. He is the State Department's chief spokesman. He graduated from Columbia University, from which he also received a master's degree in international affairs.\n\nHe is a son of Mr. and Mrs. Harvey Rubin of Larchmont, N.Y. His father is the president of Pindar Press, a New York magazine company that publishes guides to the Summer and Winter Olympics. The bridegroom's mother, Judith Rubin, works at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, where she trains students specializing in psychiatry to conduct interviews.\n\nThe couple met in 1997 in Bosnia, where Ms. Amanpour was on assignment and Mr. Rubin was traveling with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright."
