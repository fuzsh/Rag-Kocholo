        "text": "In 1911 Borden became prime minister. At the time, Canada was still tied to Great Britain. Most of the provinces were originally colonies of Great Britain. When the colonies came together in 1867 to form Canada they became a dominion that was allowed to govern itself. But Britain still had some control over the dominion. Borden wanted Canada to be treated as a separate and equal country. This was especially true after World War I began in 1914.\n\nBorden fully supported the war effort. He sent troops to fight on the side of the British. But he also asked for the right to have a say in Britain’s plans for the war. Finally, in 1917, a new British prime minister allowed Borden to participate in war meetings. After that Borden decided to increase the number of troops being sent to Europe.\n\nAt first the government had relied on volunteer troops, but by 1917 there were not enough volunteers to replace the troops who were injured or killed in battle. Borden decided to require Canadians to serve. This led to a crisis in the government as many people did not want to force people to serve. Borden faced challenges in his own party so he combined with members of the Liberal Party. They formed a Union government that won the elections held in 1917."
