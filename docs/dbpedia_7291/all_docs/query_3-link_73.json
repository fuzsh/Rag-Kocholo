        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nSir Robert Borden, Union Government and railway nationalization* JOHN A. EAGLE The nationalization of the Canadian Northern and Grand Trunk railway systems durjng and shortly after the First World War represented a major expansion in the role and function of the federal government in Canada . In 1915 the Canadian government owned and operated just over 3,500 miles of railway : the lntercolonial Railway ( Montrnal to Halifax), Prince Edward Island Railways and the Eastern Division of the National Transcontinental Railway (Winnipeg to Moncton ). 1 Eight years later, the newly formed Crown corporation - the CN R - operated 22,110 miles of railway lines from coast to coast and had a staff of 99,169 employees.2 In general, historians have maintained that the CN R was formed through pressure of circumstances, and not out or any positive decision in favour of state ownership. The Borden administration, it is held, reluctantly embarked on a program of government ownership because there was no practical alternative; public opinion would no longer support gov~rnment assistance to virtually bankrupt private railway companies. G. P. de T. Glazebrook concludes that, \"The people of Canada had not launched into this great expansion of public ownership [nationalization of railways] by design but from the pressure of existing facts ... on the whole it was undertaken with no enthusiasm, and from necessity rather than choice.\"3 The official historian of the CNR, G. R. Stevens, reaches a similar conclusion. Borden and his ministers, he declares, \"had been nagged and badgered into public ownership by circumstances beyond their control, and they had only adopted such a program *The author would like to acknowledge his Indebtedness to Professor Donald Creighton, who supervised the dissertation on which this paper is based. The author would also like to thank Professor L. H. Thomas of the Department of History, University of Alberta, whose comments were very helpful In preparing this paper. Journal of Canadian Studies as a makeshift solution to which there seemed to be no alternative.\"4 Roger Graham in his biography of Arthur Meighen maintains that the Borden government adopted a policy of public ownership \"not willingly and certainly not by philosophical conviction, but out of hard, inescapable necessity.\"5 In his most recent work, Donald Creighton reinforces the conclusions of these three authors. \"Public ownership was not a first choice, but a last resort,\" he writes, \"and the hesi\"' tatng steps with which the federal government took over the Canadian Northern, the Grand Trunk Pacific, and the Grand Trunk Railway were simply the inescapable consequences of the complete collapse of the ambitious Liberal railway-building programme of the previous decade.\" 6 Although there is a \"t:onsiderable amoutit of truth in these assessments, they neglect some very important aspects of the Borden government's approach to railway nationalization . First, the Prime Minister and several of his closest colleagues did look favourably upon the creation of a publicly-owned transcontinental railway system. And second, the Borden government's cautious, temporizing policy on the railway problem changed dramatically after the formation of Union Government in October 1917. In 1918 and 1919 the Unionist administration followed a forceful and consistent policy which had as its goal the creation of a government-owned transcontinental railway system operated by a public corporation free from political patronage. It is not generally recognized that Robert Borden became a firm advocate of public ownership of railways early in his career as Opposition leader. During the Commons debate on the Grand Trunk Pacific-National Transcontinental project in 1904, Borden declared that a second Canadian transcontinental railway should be \"entirely owned by and under the control of the people of Canada .\" The most important benefits which public ownership would bring, he argued, were strict government control of railway 59 rates and the transportation of Canadian products entirely on Canadian territory and through the country's seaports (particularly the Maritime ports of Halifax and St. John) .7 In private, the Conservative leader was hopeful that his new policy would attract considerable support for his party in the forthcoming election. \"Our railway policy,\" he informed Charles Hibbert Tupper, \"is simple, easily comprehended and not only interests but appeals to the people.\"8 Despite the decisive..."
