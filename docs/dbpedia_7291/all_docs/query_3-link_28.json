Foster • by Mr. W. Stewart Wallace is a notable addition. By any test that can be appliedSir George'sright to a placeamongthe firsthalf-dozennotabilitiesin thepoliticalgeneration that hasjust passed is confirmed. In point of actualtime givento the serviceof hiscountry, he is in first place. For twenty-one years he was a minister of the crown--a recordunapproached in the historyof thedominionparliament. For about sixteen of these years he was, in the various governmentsin which he served, the ranking member after the prime minister. The leadershipof the party, in which he held such high rank, changedsix timesduringhisactivepoliticalcareer;yet uponnot oneof theseoccasions was he a contenderfor the leadershipeither at his own instanceor at the demandof followers. Thesefacts,considered in their entirety, give the politicalmeasureof the man. He wasa valuedmemberof the party: hisservices wereregardedasindispensable by hiscolleagues, particularly after they had beenobligedto get along without them for the whole of one parliament; he was loadedwith honours;and in his later years when his temperamenthad mellowedand softened,he commandeda measure of affectionand regard which overran party lines. These were tributes to the qualities that were native to him: a constant adherenceto moral principlesand political philosophies to which he had committed himself; a willingnessto do battle for them; and facility in discussion in all its forms. He was at homein the cut and thrust methodsof controversy at closerange in parliament; no one could make a strongercasefor his side by a set speechin the Commonsor on the hustings;and he was equally at homein the academicdiscussion of abstractquestionscalling for high intellectual qualities. I was interested in Sir George E. Foster's career as a public man becauseI saw it in its making. I becamea memberof the pressgallery of the House of Commonsin the session of 1884. That was GeorgeE. Foster's secondsession;but he had already emergedfrom the ruck of new members who had come in with the general election of 1882. The Conservativesweretaking noteof him; and likewisethe Liberals. Some of the Liberalsfelt that Foster,in the languageof to-day, had put one overon them. They claimedthat he had beenelectedby Liberal votes in the generalelectionof 1882whenhecontestedKing's, New Brunswick, as an independentagainst the Conservativecandidate;and apparently they had counted upon him to gravitate to the oppositionbenches. Mr. Wallace writes of him as a detached member and mentions the \"independent\" supportwhich he for three sessions gave the government of Sir John A. Macdonald. But in the session of 1884 by all the known politicaltestshe wasindistinguishable from the ordinary party member. He sat in the deepcentre of the ministerial group of members;his desk- •The Memoirs of the Rt. Hon. Sir GeorgeFoster,P.C., G.C.M.G. By W. Stewart Wallace. Toronto: The Macmillan Company of Canada. 1083. Pp. vi, 201. ($8.õ0). 101 192 THE CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW mate and intimate associatewas young Charles Hibbert Tupper; and when he intervened in debate in 1884, and this was still more the case in 18815, it was to state the government'scaseor to defendit from attack more competentlythan the task could be done by anybody on the ministerial benches proper. In this there was, of course, nothing reprehensible. Mr. Foster allied himself with the government forces becausethe government'spolicy was congenialto him. He was consciouslyand openly shapinghimself for a political careerduring those sessions; and his progress towardshis goalwasmarkedby the increasing attention paid to him by Sir John when he was speaking. The old chieftain, when Foster was on his feet, would turn in his chair and follow him with keen attention. There camea time in the great franchisedebate in the session of 18815 when, after a continuoussitting of three days, during which time no member on the ministerial side opened his lips, the government took the offensiveby putting up three championsin succession, all picked from the ranksof the private members. While in the eyesof a young and doubtlessprejudiced member of the pressgallery, Edward Blake, in replying, made rather a showof the three champions,the ministerial forceswere plainly delightedby their performances. Within six months two of them were membersof the government. George Foster thus enteredthe governmentthree years after he forcedhis way into parliament..."
