        "text": "Career\n\nThe elder Tupper served as premier of Nova Scotia, was a Father of Confederation, and served briefly as prime minister of Canada in 1896. The younger Tupper practiced law in Halifax, Nova Scotia, after articling to learn the profession. At the time there was no formal legal education in Atlantic Canada.\n\nA decade later, Borden became the firm\"s senior partner after Graham was appointed a judge and Tupper entered politics.\n\nTupper\"s younger brother William Johnston Tupper also became a Conservative politician. He was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament in 1882.\n\nHe was appointed Minister of Marine and Fisheries by Sir John A.

He then became Minister of Justice in the government of Sir Mackenzie Bowell and attempted, unsuccessfully, to resolve the Manitoba Schools Question by drafting a bill to restore Separate School education for Catholics in Manitoba.\n\nTupper resigned in January 1896 to protest Bowell\"s leadership, which had largely failed on this question, among others\n\nHe returned as Solicitor General of Canada in the short-lived government of his father, who became prime minister later in 1896, when Bowell stepped down. Tupper Senior was defeated in the Canadian federal election, 1896, by Liberal Wilfrid Laurier, who became prime minister. Tupper remained an Member of Parliament until his retirement from politics in 1904.\n\nKnighted\n\nIn 1893, while minister of Marine and Fisheries, he was involved in the Bering Sea Arbitration between the United States and Canada as a representative of the British government, which at that time was responsible for Canadian foreign affairs\n\nHe was knighted in recognition for this service, which produced a successful outcome for Canada. From 1898 he practiced law in Vancouver, where he served as a bencher of the Law Society of British Columbia.\n\nHe represented Japanese-Canadians in a series of cases opposing discriminatory practices of the provincial government. In 1923, he was involved in the creation of the short-lived Provincial Party of British Columbia.\n\nIn September 1879, Charles Hibbert Tupper married Janet McDonald, daughter of the Honorary\n\nAnother sister married the Review L.
