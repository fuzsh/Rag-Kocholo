The role was split in two in 1930, with duties related to fisheries going to the new minister of fisheries, and all other responsibilities going to the new minister of marine, which was merged into the role of minister of transport a few years later.\n\nThe minister of fisheries lasted from 1930 to 1969, at which point the post was merged with forestry to create the post of minister of fisheries and forestry. This lasted only two years, until 1971, when the minister of fisheries became a secondary role held concurrently by the minister of the environment. In 1974 the fisheries portfolio was assigned to Roméo LeBlanc as the minister of state (fisheries) assisting the minister of the environment. When LeBlanc was appointed as the minister of the environment in 1976, the post was restyled minister of fisheries and environment.\n\nThe current post of minister of fisheries and oceans was established in 1979, and it has continued under various names since then. Hunter Tootoo was the first Indigenous person to hold this portfolio, from November 4, 2015 until May 31, 2016.\n\nMinisters of Marine and Fisheries (1867–1930)\n\nKey:\n\nLiberal Party of Canada Historical conservative parties: Liberal-Conservative, Conservative (historical), Unionist, National Liberal and Conservative\n\nNo. Portrait Name Term of office Political party Ministry 1 Peter Mitchell July 1, 1867 November 5, 1873 Liberal-Conservative 1 (Macdonald) 2 Sir Albert James Smith November 7, 1873 October 8, 1878 Liberal 2 (Mackenzie) 3 James Colledge Pope October 19, 1878 July 9, 1882 Conservative (historical) 3 (Macdonald) 4 Archibald McLelan July 10, 1882 December 9, 1885 Conservative (historical) 5 George Foster December 10, 1885 May 28, 1888 Conservative (historical) 6 Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper June 1, 1888 June 6, 1891 Conservative (historical) June 16, 1891 November 24, 1892 4 (Abbott) December 5, 1892 December 12, 1894 5 (Thompson) 7 John Costigan December 21, 1894 April 27, 1896 Liberal-Conservative 6 (Bowell) May 1, 1896 July 8, 1896 7 (Tupper) 8 Sir Louis Henry Davies July 13, 1896 September 24, 1901 Liberal 8 (Laurier) 9 James Sutherland January 15, 1902 November 10, 1902 Liberal 10 Raymond Préfontaine November 11, 1902 January 5, 1905 Liberal – Sir Wilfrid Laurier\n\n(acting) January 6, 1906 February 5, 1906 Liberal 11 Louis-Philippe Brodeur February 6, 1906 August 10, 1911 Liberal 12 Rodolphe Lemieux August 11, 1911 October 6, 1911 Liberal 13 John Douglas Hazen October 10, 1911 October 12, 1917 Conservative (historical) 9 (Borden) 14 Charles Ballantyne October 13, 1917 July 10, 1920 Unionist 10 (Borden) July 10, 1920 December 29, 1921 11 (Meighen) 15 Ernest Lapointe December 29, 1921 January 29, 1924 Liberal 12 (King) 16 Arthur Cardin\n\n(1st time) January 30, 1924 June 28, 1926 Liberal – William Anderson Black\n\n(acting) June 29, 1926 July 12, 1926 Conservative (historical) 13 (Meighen) 17 Esioff-Léon Patenaude July 13, 1926 September 25, 1926 Conservative (historical) (16) Arthur Cardin\n\n(2nd time) September 25, 1926 June 13, 1930 Liberal 14 (King) Marine portfolio moved to Minister of Marine, Fisheries portfolio moved to Minister of Fisheries.\n\nMinisters of Fisheries (1930–1969)\n\nKey:\n\nLiberal Party of Canada Historical conservative parties: Conservative (historical), Progressive Conservative\n\nNo. Portrait Name Term of office Political party Ministry 1 Cyrus Macmillan June 17, 1930 August 7, 1930 Liberal 14 (King) 2 Edgar Nelson Rhodes August 7, 1930 February 2, 1932 Conservative (historical) 15 (Bennett) – Alfred Duranleau (acting) February 2, 1932 November 16, 1934 Conservative (historical) – Grote Stirling (acting) November 17, 1934 August 13, 1935 Conservative (historical) 3 William Gordon Ernst August 14, 1935 October 23, 1935 Conservative (historical) 4 Joseph-Enoil Michaud October 23, 1935 October 5, 1942 Liberal 16 (King) 5 Ernest Bertrand October 7, 1942 August 28, 1945 Liberal 6 Hedley Francis Gregory Bridges August 30, 1945 August 10, 1947 Liberal – Ernest Bertrand (acting) August 14, 1947 September 1, 1947 Liberal 7 Milton Fowler Gregg September 2, 1947 January 18, 1948 Liberal 8 James Angus MacKinnon January 19, 1948 June 10, 1948 Liberal 9 Robert Mayhew June 11, 1948 November 15, 1948 Liberal November 15, 1948 October 14, 1952 17 (St. Laurent) 10 James Sinclair October 15, 1952 June 21, 1957 Liberal 11 Angus MacLean June 21, 1957 April 22, 1963 Progressive Conservative 18 (Diefenbaker) 12 Hédard Robichaud April 22, 1963 April 20, 1968 Liberal 19 (Pearson) April 20, 1968 July 5, 1968 20 (P.
