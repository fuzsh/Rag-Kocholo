        "text": "This bibliography is intended to provide as complete coverage as possible of newly available material useful in the study of any aspect of Canadian history. In keeping with the diverse backgrounds and interests of our readers, both scholarly and well-researched popular sources are regularly listed. It should be noted that items of a purely contemporary or speculative nature and lacking appreciable historical content are normally excluded. Furthermore, accessibility considerations logically dictate that materials cited have appeared in published form, theses traditionally being the sole exception. Suggestions for possible inclusion in Recent Publications are welcomed and should be forwarded with the necessary technical information to the compiler at the Canadian Historical Review offices.\n\nSee also the 'New Books Service,' a monthly online list of Canadian publications prepared by Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa; International Perspectives; Journal of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth, issued quarterly by the General Council of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association; and in the University of Toronto Quarterly, 'Letters in Canada,' published in the January issue. Regionally oriented bibliographies are included in each issue of Acadiensis, BC Studies, and Revue d'histoire de l'Amérique française. Any MA and PhD theses listed in the current bibliography were reported as recently completed in a range of sources, including America: History and Life and Dissertation Abstracts International.\n\nUsers of this bibliography should bear in mind that all titles are listed only once. Because of subject overlap, alternative categories should be consulted."
