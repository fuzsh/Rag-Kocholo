The following verses are in memory of little Stacey Newcomb, who departed this life September 11th, 1898: Put away the little dresses That our Stacy used to wear, He will need them on earth, never, He has climbed the golden stair He is with the happy angels, and I long for his sweet kiss, Where his little feet are waiting, In the realm of perfect bliss. Lay aside his little play things, Wet with mother’s pearly tears, How we shall miss little Stacey, All the coming weary years, Fold the dainty little dresses, That he never more will wear, For his little feet are waiting, Up above the golden stair. Kiss the little curly tresses, Cut from his bright dark hair, Do the angels kiss our darling, In the realm so bright and fair, Oh we pray to meet our Stacy, For a long, long sweet embrace, Where the little feet are waiting, And we meet him face to face. -Mrs. A.

Of little Emma May Needham who departed this life, Sept 14th, 1902: There’s a fresh little mound near the willow Where at evening you wonder and weep.

And our darling pet May, of your number, Has gone from the family fold. There’s silence in parlor and chamber, here’s sadness in every room.

Mrs. Annie Bell Henton, daughter of Major L. and Alice White, was born January 20th, 1868, at Morincie, Lenawee County, Michigan.

By this union there were seven children, viz; Dora Agnes, Edna Alice, Wiley Logan, Ray Fuller, Amos Omar, Nettie Eunice and Cassie Esther, who with her husband survive her. Mrs. Henton was converted (which to her was a real experience) at the age of 17, and united with the Methodist. In April 1890, she united with the Baptist Church and was baptized by her husband. She remained in fellowship with this denomination to the time of her death. Mrs. Henton was unassuming in her manner, yet made lasting friends on every hand. She was a devoted wife, a model mother, a good Temperance and Sunday School worker, an excellent singer, and an earnest consevration Christian.
