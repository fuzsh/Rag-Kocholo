Known as Georgie to many and Dee to her oldest friends, she will be remembered for her wide-ranging interests, her ability to say exactly what she thought, and her insights and understanding of the people around her. She was born into one of the oldest Vancouver families; her grandfather was a Commissioner of the Yukon and BC Attorney General. She developed a love of opera, film and theatre from an early age, yet she was equally at ease discussing baseball, politics or cooking. A love of travel began with a solo trip to Europe in 1968. She subsequently visited every continent except Antarctica. She had a special love for London, having spent a year’s sabbatical there, and returned many times over the years. In between, she was always up for a road trip. She served as a WRCN radio operator in World War II, listening for German naval traffic. After the war, she earned a BA from UBC before marrying and having three children. When her children were in school, she returned to earn her Bachelor of Library Science. This led to her career as a law librarian, initially at UBC, then moving to Calgary in 1976 to open the U of C law library, where she worked until her retirement in 1986. She is survived by her three sons Stephen, Bruce (Angela) and Douglas (Vivianne), and five grandchildren, James, Lane, Teal, Philippa and Billie. At her request there will be no formal service. A celebration of her life is planned at East Coulee, Alberta where she spent many happy days. “Sprinkle me around and have a vodka”.
