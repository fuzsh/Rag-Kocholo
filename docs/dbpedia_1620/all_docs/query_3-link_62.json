        "text": "Beethoven-Haus\n\nAn important, fundamental cooperation has existed with the Beethoven-Haus Bonn since the founding of the competition.\n\nThe Beethoven-Haus sees itself as a research centre for Beethoven, a memorial to the Bonn Composer and also as a cultural institution with its own concert hall. Here, the active care and preservation of Bonn's greatest son is combined with research into the composer's life and work.\n\nDirector of the Beethoven-Haus is Malte Boecker.\n\nThe cooperation between the Beethoven-Haus Bonn and the International Telekom Beethoven Competition takes place on several levels: For example, the association donates the audience award \"Beethoven-Haus Prize,\" in which the hall audience votes for its favourite in the semifinals. The prize winner receives prize money of 1,000 EUR, an invitation to a recital in the chamber music hall of the Beethoven-Haus and a bust of Beethoven by the artist Naoum Aronson donated by Gudula Neidert-Buech.\n\nSince 2023, the cooperation has been extended: On the day after the finals, all finalists will be invited to perform in the Chamber Music Hall of the Beethoven-Haus Bonn as part of a shared prize-winners' matin√©e, thereby taking their musical leave of the competition audience."
