Funded the Manufacturing Voucher Program (MVP) at $5.0M to provide funding until June 30th, 2024. Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology (CCAT) will begin accepting starting December 1st. Funded a Statewide First Robotics program at $2,270,638 for two years to support FIRST Robotics programs across Connecticut. ReadyCT will lead this effort for the MIF. Funded the Engineering Internship program for $1,079,900 for two years to continue to provide finding for college internships in the manufacturing sector so we can ensure that if \"you learn in Connecticut, you earn in Connecticut\". Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology (CCAT) is our lead on this program. Funded the Hearts and Minds 2.0 campaign at $2,000,000 for two years to continue to market manufacturing careers in CT. H&M 1.0 was a success, and we look forward to continuing to reach out to change the perception of manufacturing and drive people to life changing manufacturing careers. Looking forward to working with Cronin on this campaign. Funded the Career Roadshow program at $497,219 for two years. In 2023, we reached over 5,000 middle and high school students, introducing them to manufacturing careers. ReadyCT leads this effort. It was a great meeting, with great discussion and engagement from the board. Want to know more?

In the era of rapid technological advancement, the importance of technical education cannot be overstated. Whether it's in the fields of #AdvancedManufacturing, #AutomotiveEngineering, or the #PlasticIndustry, providing high school students with hands-on experiences through internships, pre-apprenticeships, and apprenticeships is essential for building a skilled and innovative workforce. Consider a high school student learning about advanced manufacturing techniques, from 3D printing to automation. These experiences are more than just educational; they are inspirational. They open students' eyes to the possibilities within the manufacturing sector and help them develop the skills needed for high-demand jobs. Technical education programs bridge the gap between theoretical learning and real-world application. Students get to work with cutting-edge technology and see how their contributions can make a difference. This hands-on approach not only enhances their technical skills but also fosters critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. For businesses, supporting technical education means ensuring a steady stream of skilled workers who are ready to meet the challenges of the future. It also means fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation, which is crucial for staying competitive in a global market. As leaders in the industry, it's our responsibility to support these initiatives and create pathways for young talent to thrive. By investing in technical education, we can build a stronger, more innovative workforce and ensure a bright future for our industries. #TalentPipeline #WorkforceDevelopment #TechnicalEducation #FutureEngineers #ManufacturingInnovation\n\nüí° Think about the impact of technical education on high school students and how it shapes their future careers.

Johnny will support our Innovation Team, located at our Elmhurst facility. 1. Tell me about your educational background & what inspired you to pursue your career / education path? I have always been a STEM Person, but it hasn‚Äôt always been clear to me to do Engineering. I attended Princeton University for 1 year and felt confused as to the path I should take going forward, and did not consider engineering, so I decided to take a gap year to see what I really wanted to do. I discovered that Loyola University had a new Engineering Program and enrolled in Loyola instead of going back to Princeton. I fell in love with engineering due to Loyola‚Äôs Program. There, I was able to make great connections with my professors and fellow students. 2. What attracted you to this internship? The Innovation Internship described to me seemed really up my alley. Based on the tasks at hand, I could use the skills I learned in college and apply them to real work situations. In college, I did a lot of prototyping projects and I like that this internship is ground level engineering. I will be able to come up with solutions for future problems. 3. Where do you see yourself 5 years into your career? I hope to either be starting / finishing a Masters in Engineering. I hope to be focusing on projects that I gravitate towards and that I am excited to be a part of. 4. What would you say your greatest non-work accomplishment is? I would say that pushing myself to try new things and get out of my comfort zone has been one of my major personal accomplishments. During my gap year, I lived in South America with a family that did not speak English, while living with them I was able to learn a new culture and how to navigate the unknown and get comfortable with uncomfortable. 5. What do you like to do in your free time? I like to be outdoors as much as possible ‚Äì I like spending time on the lake or skiing whenever I get the chance. I also like to make bad music and can play the guitar. Please join us in welcoming Johnny to our team!"
