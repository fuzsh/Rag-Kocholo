        "text": "During my internship at Delve in 2022, someone told me “People overestimate what they can accomplish in 1 year but underestimate what they can accomplish in 3.” While I can’t remember who said this (please speak up if it’s you!), it has really stuck with me as a way to reflect on how I’ve changed personally and professionally – especially this New Year. One year ago, after taking several classes under the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative and signing up for more, I decided to focus my career on helping companies build sustainable product development strategies. I had finally found a subject I really wanted to sink my teeth into. Three years ago, I was finishing up my application for the MIT - Integrated Design & Management program. I knew I wanted to learn more about product development and human-centered design, but I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with it afterward. I just hoped that I would find a subject that sparked my interest as much as robotics and 3D printing did in undergrad. Today, I’m teaching human-centered design classes and researching sustainable product development at Oregon State University. While this is a short-term position, and I’m still looking for longer-term opportunities, it’s been helpful to look back over the last 3 years to consider how far I’ve come. One-year ago me was excited about what I could do next but still figuring out how to get there. Today, I’m continuing to figure out what’s next after my research position ends. Three-year ago me would be so proud that I was accepted into and graduated from MIT, made a whole bunch of new friends with similarly interdisciplinary mindsets, got married, and finally moved out of the Boston area to the amazing Pacific Northwest. And he would be especially proud that I finally found a new area of interest that really gets me excited about where to take my career. While sometimes the changes I’ve made to my life have felt incremental, 3 years of baby steps will still get you a long way! I hope that quote is as useful to anyone who read it as it was to me! How have you changed in the last 1 year vs the last 3?"
