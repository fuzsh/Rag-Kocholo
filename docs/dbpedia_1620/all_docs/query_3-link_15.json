        "text": "When the Nazis invaded France, Aronson andhis wife, Helen, volunteered at a public refugeecafeteria called The Friendly Center, from thestart of the war until their evacuation.3 Whenthe situation became dire, they fled to Portugalwith Chagall and then to the United States withthe help of aid from HIAS (Hebrew ImmigrantAid Society) and JDC (American Jewish JointDistribution Committee). One Americanmagazine even greeted his arrival in Americawith an article entitled ‘Hitler’s Latest Gift toAmerica.’4 They settled in New York City, whereAronson died a few years later in 1943.Before fleeing, Aronson hid much of his workin the basement of the Louvre for safekeeping.Once Paris was occupied, the Nazis confiscateda large portion of the Louvre’s artworks withthe intention of transferring them to Germany.Aronson’s sculptures were among many worksloaded on trains headed to Berlin; however,French railroad engineers working with theFrench Resistance rerouted the train, and itscontents were transferred to a children’s homein Les Andelys, a village 80 kilometers fromParis, where Jewish Holocaust orphans wereplaced after the war. The rest of Aronson’swork was auctioned off; little of it survivestoday. (English)"
