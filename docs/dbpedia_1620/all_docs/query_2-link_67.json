        "text": "The study provides the first comprehensive survey of the reception of the Holocaust in Hungarian art in the 1960s-1970s. Conclusion From the late 1950s onwards, the topic of the Holocaust had a significant reception in Hungarian art. Besides the artists discussed here, who returned to the subject several times, others also touched upon the topic in singular works. Additionally, there were state commissions, but it seems that the independently produced works and the commissioned ones resulted in developments unfolding in parallel, mostly disconnected from one another. This was due to the fact that the non-commissioned artists’ perspective was typically very different from that of official memory politics, which focused on the anti-fascist struggle and thereby instrumentalized the memory of the Holocaust, as exemplified here by the Mauthausen case study. The examples analysed here also shed light on differences in approach between periods and generations. Artists of the older generation, still temporally close to the traumatic experiences, used a surrealist, symbolic approach from the late 1950s; the primary objective of their works was the commemoration of the victims. Accordingly, they employed a Holocaust iconography referring to the locations and tools of the genocide, and symbols alluding to the victims and their memory. By contrast, a more open representation and a critical approach became prevalent in the mid-1960s, and particularly at the end of the decade; besides remembering, identifying those responsible for the Holocaust and the reasons behind it gained importance, which were frequently connected to present-day problems, such as contemporary anti-Semitism. This tendency was partly due to the fresh approach of the younger generation emerging at this time, but also influenced by the conceptual turn of the late 1960s, which brought new forms of expression. For example, the inclusion of texts helped foster a new, more open tone. It is also important to consider, besides the generational differences, the artists’ personalities, e.g. the works of Endre Bálint and János Major have significant affinities due to their satirical tone despite any differences in generation or genre. The 1960s and 1970s were characterized not only by the coexistence of generations and styles but also by a kind of thematic plurality in the works. In a number of cases the theme of the Holocaust surfaced in connection with further topics, thus visualizing different time periods simultaneously. The two possible perspectives on the Holocaust – social and individual – often appeared together, most notably in the works based on well-known documentary photographs but also recounting personal stories. These simultaneously reflect two tendencies that characterize further works as well: the generalization of the experiences of the Holocaust and personalization through emphasizing aspects of the event related to individuals or families. A number of works link the Holocaust and the Nazi era to contemporary anti-Semitism and to events such as the Six-Day War. These works represent the Holocaust as part of a broader narrative of anti-Semitism running from the past to the present. Another important characteristic of the period was the indirect articulation of messages that were nevertheless quite accessible to contemporaries. Such works leave it to the viewer to complement and interpret the visual representation by ‘reading between the lines’. A characteristic example of this elliptical mode of expression is János Major’s photograph of a gravestone marked ‘…ER ADOLF’, referencing Hitler. The use of biblical and historical allusions also belongs to this tendency. In these cases, the remote event is not used primarily to illustrate something about itself, but as a reference to the Holocaust: for instance, works dealing with the late nineteenth-century blood-libel case of Tiszaeszlár do not simply present an interesting historical episode, but use it as a parable to address the Holocaust and issues from the artists’ own era. A significant number of the works discussed here were shown to a Hungarian and (primarily in the case of conceptual works) international audience at the time of their production or a few years later. Even so, the public display of works was restricted: the works of neo-avant-garde artists, for example, often reached only a narrow subcultural audience, regardless of their topic. Despite occasional, temporary access to most of these works, no broad public discourse about the Shoah emerged during this period, and this lack of discourse was not exclusively the result of the socialist system in Hungary. In fact, such a discourse would have been anachronistic as it would have occurred before the memory of the Holocaust became globalized and the term Holocaust was widely established. The works discussed here are exceptionally significant for the very reason that (in time and in critical attitude) they were ahead of the prevailing social discourse, or – as seen in the case of the Roma Holocaust – even ahead of scholarly research on the subject.\n\nAbstractDominick LaCapra has brought into focus the relationship between the notions of trauma, absence, and loss, highlighting the need to differentiate these respective cultural phenomena. For the last two decades, Polish critical art has galvanized public opinion and shocked traditionally minded art critics. With time, artists have moved from waging a frontal attack on cultural taboos to a reassessment of the wartime past and its aftermath. Zbigniew Libera’s Lego Concentration Camp might serve as a proof of this transition. Recently, the focus has shifted again to the manifestations of Jewish presence in Poland, either in the past or in the future. As much as Mirosław Bałka’s monumental How It Is (2009) represents absence, Yael Bartana’s series of films, Jewish Renaissance Movement in Poland: Mary Koszmary (“Nightmares”), The Wall and Tower, and Assassination, attempts to imaginatively reinstate Jewish life in Poland. Wojciech Wilczyk’s photographic project, There’s No Such Thing as an Innocent Eye (2008), cataloging the re-maining synagogues and houses of prayer in Poland, traces the posthumous life of Jewish architecture not only in the wake of the Holocaust but also after four decades of Communism and twenty years of capitalist ingenuity. Łukasz Baksik’s Matzevot 163for Everyday Use (2010) is another photographic project of interest. Last but not least, Rafał Betlejewski’s I Miss You, Jew! (2005–ongoing) proposes a reparative psychoanalysis of the body politic via a series of interventions in the public space.This paper is going to examine the aesthetic underpinnings of these represen-tations of absence/loss and a recent shift of emphasis to political interventions in Polish Holocaust art. The aforementioned artworks expand the problematization proposed by LaCapra by engaging the audiences in the process of reinstating Jewish presence. The invitation extended to the Jews is possible in the realm of art, as it can play with the sociopolitical, triggering a reconsideration of the traumatic past."
