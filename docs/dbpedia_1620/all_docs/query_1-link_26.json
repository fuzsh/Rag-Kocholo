        "text": "Chronology from Le Maitron of Key Dates in French Labour History\n\nAuthors: Stéphane Sirot, complétée par Michel Cordillot, René Lemarquis, Claude Pennetier and Céline Lenormand; italicised additions by Steve Jefferys\n\nJanuary\n\nA Meunier chocolate factory building with a metal frame is erected by the architect Jules Saulnier at Noisel-sur-Marne.\n\nJanuary 5 Southern districts of Paris begin to be shelled by the Prussians. The siege began on September 18 1870.\n\nJanuary 6-7 Overnight a red poster signed by the Central Committee of Paris’ 20 arrondissements appears on walls all over Paris. It calls for the creation of an all-Paris Commune.\n\nJanuary 18 The proclamation of the German Empire occurs in the Mirror Gallery of the Versailles Château takes place before William I and Bismarck.\n\nJanuary 22 Parisian revolutionaries try to seize power for a Commune in Paris as part of the ‘action day’ protesting against the government of National Defence’s decision to offer to surrender Paris to Bismarck. A decision is taken to order the troops to fire on the crowd outside the Town Hall, allegedly (and probably fake news) given by Gustave Chaudey, a friend of Courbet.\n\nJanuary 23 Jules Favre, a leading republican who was Foreign Minister of the Government of National Defence in Bordeaux, begins peace talks with Bismarck. It is agreed by the government two days later, and signed by Favre and Bismarck in Versailles on January 27.\n\nJanuary 28 The official journal announces a 21-day armistice with Bismarck to allow national elections to take place to create an Assembly to meet in Bordeaux that would ratify the peace. Paris is instructed to surrender and to allow the Germans into the defensive forts around Paris. The Germans would be allowed to march through Paris in early March. Paris would have to pay for the siege.\n\nFebruary\n\nFebruary 6 Opposed to the decision to cease fighting, and aware of the pro-peace monarchist majority being elected, Leon Gambetta resigns from the government.\n\nFebruary 8 Elections for the National Assembly provide a right-wing monarchist majority (214 Orleanists, 182 Bourbonists, 20 Bonapartists) who want peace and are opposed to the majority republican deputies from Paris and other major cities.\n\nFebruary 15 The Paris battalions of the National Guard decide to combine under a single command and decide to reject the surrender.\n\nFebruary 17 Adolphe Thiers is elected head of the Executive by the National Assembly meeting in Bordeaux.\n\nFebruary 22 Jules Vallès launches the daily newspaper ‘Le Cri du peuple’, critical of Thiers and the monarchist National Assembly. It sells at 5 centimes and its print run is between 50,000 and 100,000, making it the most read newspaper during the Commune. 65 issues are produced between February 22 and March 12, when it is banned, and from March 21 to May 23, when it ceases publication with the start of the Bloody Week that ends the Commune.\n\nFebruary 24 Several battalions of the Paris National Guard march from the Place de la Bastille in commemoration of the 1848 February Revolution. They demand the continuation of the war and oppose the disarming of Paris. The demonstrations continue over the next few days.\n\nMarch\n\nMarch 1\n\nThe National Assembly in Bordeaux confirms the abolition of Napoleon III’s Empire and agrees to ratify the peace treaty by 546 votes to 107.\n\nMarch 1 – 3 Prussian troops symbolically occupy parts of western Paris and hold a victory parade on the Champs-Élysées.\n\nMarch 3 The Paris battalions of the National Guard meet in the Tivoli-Vauxhall dance hall (in what since 1970 is the Rue Léon-Jouhaux) and draw up new rules.\n\nMarch 9 Universal male suffrage is granted to two ‘French’ communes (Saint-Louis and Gorée and extended later to Dakar and Rufisque) in Senegal. Their deputies will sit in the National Assembly.\n\nMarch 10 The Bordeaux National Assembly decides to move to Versailles.\n\nMarch 11 Vinoy, the government’s military commander of Paris, bans six republican newspapers.\n\nMarch 15\n\nThe National Guard elects a Central Committee whose members install themselves in the Hotel de Ville.\n\nThiers and his government return to Paris.\n\nMarch 17 Auguste Blanqui, who had left Paris because he was unwell, is arrested staying with a friend in the Dordogne.\n\nMarch 18\n\nThe Paris Commune begins in response to an attempt by the Thiers government’s army to take control of the 227 canons stockpiled at Montmartre and Belleville.\n\nThe 88th regiment is surrounded by National Guardsmen and the crowd. Louise Michel among them. The soldiers start to fraternise. The officers are disarmed and their general and another former general who had played a part in the vicious suppression of the June 1848 workers’ insurrection are arrested and taken to the Chateau Rouge. The generals are shot later, despite the intervention of several leading Communards.\n\nThiers and the members of his government flee to Versailles.\n\nMarch 19 The Central Committee of the National Guard announce communal elections for Paris.\n\nMarch 22 The Paris National Guard dispersed a ‘Friends of Order’ demonstration in the Place Vendome, killing around ten of the demonstrators.\n\nMarch 23 Communes are proclaimed in Lyon and Marseille.\n\nMarch 24 An attempt to declare a Commune in Nîmes fails. Other Communes are declared in Narbonne and in Toulouse.\n\nMarch 25 The Lyon mayor is able to end the Commune there by welcoming the soldiers returning from the siege of Belfort, who then put an end to the Commune at the town hall.\n\nMarch 26\n\nThe results of the election for the Paris Commune are declared. 229 167 men had voted out of the 484 569 entitled to vote. Of the 80 members elected, 25 are workers. Among them are Eugène Varlin, Zéphirin Camélinat, Benoît Malon and Léo Frankel, leading members of the International Working Men’s Association. Others elected included Charles Delescluze, one of around 20 admirers of the Jacobins, and Théophile Ferré, one of a dozen followers of the absent Blanqui . So too were some Proudhonista like Pierre Denis and a handful of independents like Gustave Courbet and Jules Vallès. Twenty of those elected were free masons.\n\nIn Creusot a Commune is declared by Jean-Baptiste Dumay.\n\n28 mars.\n\nThe Communes in Creusot and Toulouse are overthrown.\n\nThe elected Paris Commune declares itself the government of Paris at the Hotel de Ville. It is given this authority by the National Guard’s Central Committee.\n\nMarch 29 The Commune adopts the manifesto drafted by Pierre Denis, based on Proudhon’s philosophy of communal federalism.\n\nMarch 31 The Commune of Narbonne fails\n\nApril\n\nThe Versailles Government commands the support of some 130,000 troops under the orders of MacMahon, the general who had been defeated at Sedan. Perhaps as many as half of these had been prisoners of the Prussians who agreed to their release so they could assist in the battle against the Paris Commune. The Commune was defended by approximately 20-30,000 members of the National Guard, most of whom had never been involved in military action.\n\nApril 2 Some 9,000 regular Versaillais army soldiers attack around 600 men defending a barricade of carts and wooden barrels at Courbeovie, to west of Neuilly. The Commune’s Federal soldiers retreat under artillery fire. Casualties are 5 killed and 21 wounded among the Versaillais and 17 killed and 25 captured among the ‘Fédérés’. Five Communards killed were prisoners who were immediately shot on the orders of General Vinoy.\n\nApril 3\n\nThe Commune decrees the separation of the Church from the State and ends the statement payment of priests.\n\nUnder the Blanquist Émile Eudes three loosely connected column of 10,000 Communard soldiers and 8 canon march on Versaillais, largely hoping the regular army will fraternise with them. Surprised by the artillery fire directed against them the Versaillais win both the Battle of Meudon and the Battle of Rueil. Having surrendered at Chatillon, Emile Victor Duval, is shot at Petit-Clamart on the orders of Vinoy as he was being taken to Versailles the following day. Unarmed, one of the Communard leaders at Rueil, Gustave Flourens, is executed on the spot by a gendarme captain.\n\nAril 4\n\nThe Marseille Commune fails.\n\nAn insurrection in Limoges initially stops troops being taken by train to Versaillais, but is then defeated.\n\nApril 5 The siege of Paris by the Versailles army begins. The Versaillais start shelling Paris. The Commune declares that Theirs and his government will be held responsible.\n\nApril 6 Following the summary executions of Duval and Flourens, the Commune passed the hostage decree. This stipulates that for every one Communard executed, three hostages will be executed. This is only put into effect during the Bloody Week from May 21. On May 14 the Commune proposed exchanging all 74 hostages against one man, Blanqui. This proposal was rejected by Thiers and finally on May 24 six hostages were executed, the Archbishop of Paris Georges Darboy, four other priests and the judge Louis-Bernard Bonjean.\n\nApril 8\n\nThe Commune passed a law stating that municipal councillors in communes of populations less than 20,000 could elect their mayors.\n\nShells hit the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nApril 11 Nathalie Lemel and Elisabeth Dmitrieff set up the ‘Women’s Union for the Defence of Parris and Care of the Wounded’.\n\nApril 16 The Commune decrees that any workshop abandoned by their owner should be requisitioned by their workers in order to become workers’ cooperatives that would pay an indemnity to their former owners.\n\nApril 19 The Commune issued its Declaration to the French People. It stood for: the consolidation of the republic, an association of autonomous communes throughout France, each of which would vote its budget, taxes and other key issues; the election or selection by competition with the right to recall of all justices, magistrates and communal functionaries; the guarantee of individual freedom of conscience and of the freedom to work; the organisation of an elected national guard whose job was to keep order.\n\nApril 24 Abandoned houses by those who had fled Paris were to be requisitioned to house those made homeless by the shelling.\n\nApril 27 The Commune outlaws fines and withholding of wages by employers; it bans night work for bakers, it establishes a commission to examine how to organise secular primary and professional education in Paris.\n\nApril 30, May 7 Municipal elections take place.\n\nMay\n\nMay 1 The Jacobins and Blanquists win a majority of 45 to 23 on the Commune to establish a Committee of Public Safety of five elected delegates in response to the multiple dangers faced by the Communards. The Proudhonists are opposed to this step. The role of the Committee is not defined, and a new Committee is elected on May 9.\n\nMay 10 The Versailles government signs the Treaty of Frankfort. Under it Germany annexes the Alsace and a significant part (the actual Moselle departmnet) of Lorraine. Some 160,000 inhabitants who refuse to become German leave their homes and move to other parts of France.\n\nMay 15 Twenty-one Commune delegates protest the authoritarian turn of the Committee of Public Safety.\n\nMay 16 The statue of Napoleon on the Vendome Column is pulled down. The decision was confirmed/accepted by Gustave Courbet.\n\nMay 18 The National Assembly in Versailles ratifies the Frankfort Treaty.\n\nMay 19 The Commune issues a decree requiring the secularisation of education.\n\nMay 21 to May 28 The Bloody Week\n\nMay 21 The Versailles troops enter Paris through the Saint-Cloud gate, and then start attacking the over 500 barricades that block most of the main streets.\n\nMay 23 The Commune decides to set fire to several public buildings, including the Tuileries, the Hotel de Ville, the Cour des Comptes and the Conseil d’Etat on the ground floor of the Orsay Palace, and the Finance Ministry. Many other buildings are destroyed by shellfire from the Versaillais.\n\nMay 24 The six hostages, Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, four Jesuit priests and a judge, are executed at La Roquette prison.\n\nMay 24-May 25 484 Communard prisoners are executed by the Versailles soldiers in the Parc Monceau and in Montmartre.\n\nMay 26 In retaliation the Communards execute 52 Versaillais prisoners in the Rue Haxo.\n\nMay 27 The fighting ends in the Père-Lachaise cemetery.\n\nMay 28 The last barricade of the Commune at the Rue Ramponeau is overrun by the Versailles army. Eugène Varlin, who lived in the Rue Dauphine, was totured and shot.\n\nMay 29 The Communards supporting garrison of the Vincennes Castle finally surrender.\n\nBy the end of this ‘bloody week’ the Versailles troops have retaken Paris. There are thousands of dead, tens of thousands of arrests. Many activists, followed by the police, flee Paris and try to escape in province or abroad. Estimates of those killed range from 6,000-7,500 (Robert Tombs) to 20,000-35,000 (Henri Rochefort).\n\nJune\n\n22 military courts are set up in Versailles to try the 38,000 arrested insurrectionaries. 270 are condemned to death (23 death sentences are carried out); 410 are condemned to forced labour, 3,989 are sentenced to prison terms, 322 are exiled and 7,500 are deported to Algeria or New Caledonia. 56 children are jailed in houses of correction.\n\nJuly\n\nIn partial elections in 47 departments the republicans secure support in 39, carrying 99 seats out of 114. These republican gains are repeated in municipal elections in Paris on July 23 and July 30.\n\nAugust\n\nAugust 7 The Versailles riding school sees the opening of the third military tribunal judging 17 leading Communards including Théophile Ferré and Gustave Courbet. Others tried included the elected Commune members Adolphe Assi, François Jourde, Paschal Grousset, Dominique Régère, Alfred-Édouard Billioray, Raoul Urbain, Victor Clément, Alexis Trinquet, Henry Champy, Paul Rastoul, Augustin Verdure, Baptiste Descamps and Ulysse Parent, as well as members of the National Guard’s Central Committee, Charles Lullier and Paul Ferrat.\n\nSeptember\n\nSeptember 2 The trial ended with sentences: two death sentences (Ferré was executed, Lullier spared); Urbain and Trinquet were given forced labour for life; seven were sentenced to deportation to overseas prisons, two to simple deportation, four to prison (six months for Courbet) and two (Descamps and Parent) were acquitted.\n\nSeptember 4 The 4th military tribunal trial opens of five women who were ambulance or canteen workers during the Commune. Élisabeth Rétiffe, Joséphine Marchais, Eugénie Suétens were sentenced to death, with the penalties commuted, Eulalie Papavoine was sentenced to deportation to a prison and Lucie Maris-Bocquin who with Rose Rétiffe had been seen building barricades in the Rue de Lille wearing a red scarf and carrying a rifle, was sentenced to ten years in jail and eventually released in 1878.\n\nSeptember 17-23 The International Workingmen’s Association (IWMA) meets in London. Karl Marx wins a vote to create a working class political party in all countries affiliated to the IWMA. The opposition comes from supporters of the more libertarian views of Proudhon and Bakunin.\n\nOctober\n\nThe huge disinvestments that followed the payments of the war debt (25% of France’s GDP had to be borrowed) to Germany create a monetary crisis.\n\nÉmile Zola publishes the first of his 20 volume Rougon-Macquart series of books attacking the values and morality of France under the Empire. It’s called La fortune des Rougon.\n\nOctober 8, October 15 Regional elections confirm the success of the Republicans.\n\nNovember\n\nNovember 7 Gambetta founds what became the most influential French newspaper, La Republique Francaise.\n\nNovember 28 The only army officer to support the Commune, Louis Rossel, is executed at the Satory military camp at Versailles, along with Sergeant Pierre Bourgeois and Théophile Ferré.\n\nNovember 30 Gaston Crémieux, a leader of the Marseille Commune, is executed after six months in prison.\n\nDecember 23 The Circles of Catholic Workers come into existence.\n\nArrondissements 6, 15\n\nNumbers: 1-3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 15-17, 36, 85, 86-88, 93, 102, 150, 393, 399\n\nThe Luxembourg Palace (Nos. 15-17) is the most well-known building in the old Roman road that is the longest street in Paris. The road now stretches 4.360 Km westwards from the Boulevard Saint Michel to the junction of the Boulevards Lefebvre and Victor on the inner ring-road called the ‘Petite Ceinture‘ on which route a small train used to run round Paris.\n\nRue Vaugirard is so well known that it also features as a possible building or hotel site in the French version of Monopoly.\n\nThe end of the road was where, at Nos. 393 and 399 barricades were built across the street in March 1871 to prevent the Versaillais troops from entering.\n\nThe road’s name comes from the ancient village of Vaugirard, called after the mid-13th century owner of the land there, ‘Val du Girard’.\n\nAmong the tens of thousands who have lived in this old road are some who we feature in Left in Paris, often living alongside forgotten bits of left history.\n\nThe Trianon-hôtel, for example, at No. 1- 3 witnessed one of the first attacks by the resistance against a hotel requisitioned by the German army. The bombing took place on 14 November 1942 organised by the largely foreigner and Jewish Francs-tireurs et partisans – main-d’œuvre immigrée (Fighters and partisans – Migrant Workers) group.\n\nAt No. 4, then called the Hôtel Lisbonne, Paul Verlaine lived off and on between periods in hospital from 1889 to 1894.\n\nFrom 1906 Jacques Prévert lived at No. 7 and went to the school next door, No. 9.\n\nI’ve very fond memories of the Vaugirard school where my son Michael spent a happy four months when he was ten. The area has completely changed since then. The school was constantly complaining about the bourgeois dog owners who allowed their tiny animals to deposit all over the surrounding streets as they walked them to the Luxembourg Garden. The disappearance of less well off and younger residents has led the authorities to close the whole school down in 2019.\n\nÉmile Zola lived in rooms at No 10 in 1866 with Alexandre Meley whom he married in 1870.\n\nAfter the5 metre high and 24km long tax wall was built under Louis XVI there were two customs posts across Rue Vaugirard. One was at No. 102 and another (la barrière du Maine) from Nos. 111-132. While unused during the Revolution, they were reinstated after the 1815 Restoration and only finally largely demolished in 1860 with the expansion of Paris to the Thiers walls, built in the early 1840s roughly 5km from the city centre.\n\nVictor Hugo and his wife Adèle lived for the first three years of their marriage, from 1824-1827, at what was 90 rue de Vaugirard but is now numbered 86-88. This period of his life followed the anonymous publication of the 21-year-old’s first novel, Han d’Islande set in 17th century Norway.\n\nWhile living there Hugo wrote and published his second romance novel, Bug Jarval, with a black slave insurrectionist in St Domingo as its hero who falls passionately in love with a white women.\n\nOn December 10 1904 Lenin sat for the Russian sculptor, Naoum Aronson (1872-1943) at his studio in No. 93.\n\nWhen she first arrived in Paris around 1860, the feminist bookbinder and Communard Nathalie le Mel mother of three worked at Pasquier et Vigneau’s bookbinding works at No. 150 (in the 15th arrondissement).\n\nA long way along the road was also where Michel Foucault lived, at no. 289 from 1970 until his death in 1984.\n\nFrench measurements of distance\n\nFor the real historical nerds among us, in the wall at No. 85 is an early 18th century ‘half-league stone’. The Fleur de Lys on it was removed during the French Revolution. The marker (borne) indicates the first half-league (lieue) – that is 500 toises.\n\nA toise was the distance between a man’s outstretched arms, approximately 6 feet) or 2 Km from the entrance to Notre-Dame cathedral. 1 lieue = 1,000 toises, or approximately 4 Km. A toise is the equivalent of the fathom in English, but in France it was used both on land and at sea.\n\nAt the French Revolution France still used hundreds of different weights and measures, originally derived from Roman units where the leuga (lieue/league) was the distance that a man can run in an hour. King Charlemagne (742-814) had added the pied du Roi (the King’s foot) and the toise. The pouce (inch) was the width of a human thumb, and was 1/12th of the pied du roi. The ligne (line) was 1/12th of a pouce, and the point (Truchet point in English) was 1/12th of a ligne.\n\nAfter Charlemagne the fragmentation of France and of Europe accelerated. So distances varied from town to town, with the variation in 1 league (lieue) being from 3.268 km to 5.849.\n\nOn August 4 1789 a successful resolution from the Jacobin Club at the Constituent Assembly abolished all the privileges of the Crown, including its right to determine measures of distance and weight.\n\nIn 1790 Talleyrand proposed the drawing up of a Universal Measure, and the National Assembly proposed doing this jointly with the United Kingdom, who refused.\n\nIn 1791 a law established a Commission to establish the universal measure. They decided it should be based on a quarter of the length of a meridian and gave two geographers the task of measuring it exactly. They took seven years to measure the distance between Barcelona and Dunkerque.\n\nThis exercise was considered too long-winded for both military and political reasons. So on August 1 1793 the National Convention passed a decree determining the ‘provisional’ length of what in 1795 was named the metre. This was based on a millionth of the 1739-1740 distance measured by Lacaille from the North Pole to the Equator. It was exactly 3 pieds, 11 lignes and 44 hundredths of the principal toise then used in Paris.\n\nFinally, on 7 April 1795, the new system of weights and measures adopted by the French National Convention were named: metres and grams. A metal metre-long yardstick embedded in marble was then placed in the wall at no. 36 rue de Vaugirard. And in a shop window at No. 215 there is an 1840 cast iron kilometer stone marking 3.5 km from the centre of Paris.\n\nThe old and new systems were used concurrently in France over the next half century. Metric leagues were used from 1812 to 1840 with one metric lieue = 4000 metres or 4 Km. The use of the old system was finally ended across the whole of France by the law of 1837.\n\nBut when in 1988 Joe, Joan and I bought a half-finished farm/barn in the Haute Savoie, and I had to finish off the plumbing, I can still remember the plumbing shop in Thonon-les-Bains where the width of copper pipes and joints were still in pouces (inches). In the UK metrication became government policy under Wilson in 1965 and in 1973, with accession to the European Economic Community, the UK was given 5 years to adopt metric units and by 1980 virtually no schools continued to teach in feet and inches.\n\nPLACES"
