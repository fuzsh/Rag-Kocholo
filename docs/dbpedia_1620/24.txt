Naoum Aronson (1872-1943), was a Russian-born Jewish sculptor, who lived most of his adult life, totally nearly fifty years, in Paris. Aronson was most notable for his busts of important and famous personae (including Tolstoy, Beethoven, and Rasputin). Before moving to Paris, Aronson studied at the Vilna Art School. After the German invasion of France in 1940, Aronson fled to the United States, resettling in the Upper West Side of New York City, where Roman Vishniac also happened to have resettled in 1941. Vishniac was establishing himself as a portrait photographer, often photographing German and Russian Jewish immigrants, and in those early years (circa 1941) Vishniac captured the Aronsonâ€™s portrait.
