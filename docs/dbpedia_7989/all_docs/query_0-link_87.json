In a series of videos, we will discuss 20th-century must reads by authors like Carl Gustav Jung, Noam Chomsky and Thomas Kuhn, to seminal work by idealists such as Schopenhauer. And, of course, we will pay tribute to foundational ancients texts as discussed by, for instance, Peter Kingsley and Patrick Harpur. As a starter, Hans Busstra asked Bernardo Kastrup to pick 10 books from his own shelf that most influenced his philosophical work. In this video, Bernardo briefly runs through the main ideas put forward in these books and how they changed his life. In the upcoming videos, Hans will do the homework by reading and reviewing these 10 books. You are, of course, invited to read along and send in your own insights and questions (please do so via our YouTube community page: https://www.youtube.com/@essentiafoundation/community). The first book to be discussed after this video will be ‘Answer to Job,’ by Carl Gustav Jung.\n\nEssentia Foundation communicates, in an accessible but rigorous manner, the latest results in science and philosophy that point to the mental nature of reality. We are committed to strict, academic-level curation of the material we publish.\n\nRecently published\n\nReading\n\n|\n\nEpistemology\n\nIf all of our scientific theories are but convenient fictions—in the sense that nature behaves as if these fictions were true—but say nothing about the actual structure of reality, are we free to decide which way to think about this structure suits us best? Rob Hamilton addresses this and related questions in this short essay.\n\nRobert Hamilton, B.Sc.\n\n516\n\nSeeing\n\n|\n\nPsychology\n\nWhat if your child could feel their friend’s headache in their own head? Would you be able to explain where the boundaries of self begin and end? Or how would you react if your child experienced ‘loving darkness’ during an NDE? Natalia Vorontsova explored these and other fundamental questions about the nature of reality, consciousness, and science with a researcher of children’s transpersonal and extrasensory experiences, Dr. Donna Thomas.\n\nNatalia Vorontsova, MA\n\n389\n\nFrom the archives\n\nSeeing\n\n|\n\nPhilosophy\n\nNatalia Vorontsova talks to Dr Tom Cheetham about active imagination, consciousness and life-changing experiences in the context of the philosophy and theology of Henry Corbin, Ibn Arabi and Surhawardi. Tom offers a unique perspective on post-materialist science, having come full circle from scientific materialism through Jungian psychology and Sufi mysticism to the realization that science is not an obstacle to accessing the transcendent. It’s a thought-provoking conversation about the nature of reality and what it means to be human.\n\nNatalia Vorontsova, MA\n\n1229\n\nReading\n\n|\n\nNeuroscience\n\nNeuroscience has conceded that the same cognitive structures that generate dreams also generate our experience of waking reality. It’s just that, unlike in the former case, in the latter the ‘hallucination’ is modulated by external factors. Be that as it may, the implication is still that all we colloquially refer to as ‘matter’ is a cognitive construct of our minds. However, as Aditya Prasad highlights, despite such acknowledgment most neuroscientists still surreptitiously seem to assume that the chunk of matter we call a ‘brain’ is special: unlike all other matter, which is ‘hallucinated,’ the brain is the thing that generates the hallucinations. But for the account to remain consistent, we must understand that the brain, too, as a material object, is part of the hallucination. The implications of this consistency, Mr. Prasad argues, are ineffable.\n\nAditya Prasad\n\n4875\n\nSeeing\n\n|\n\nQuantum Theory\n\nA new groundbreaking theory on consciousness proposes that qualia — for instance, the scent of a rose — reside in quantum fields. Federico Faggin is one of the greatest luminaries of high technology alive today. A physicist by education, he is the inventor of the microprocessor and the MOS silicon gate technology, both of which underlie the modern world’s entire information technology. With the knowledge and experience of a lifetime in cutting-edge fields, Federico now turns his attention to consciousness and the nature of reality, sharing with us his profound insights on the classical and quantum worlds, artificial intelligence, life and the human mind. In this discussion, he elaborates on an idealist model of reality, produced after years of careful thought and direct experience, according to which nature’s most fundamental level is that of consciousness as a quantum phenomenon, while the classical physical world consists merely of evocative symbols of a deeper reality.\n\nHans Busstra, MA\n\n2843\n\nReading\n\nEssays\n\nSeeing\n\n|\n\nComputer Science\n\nBernardo Kastrup argues why the idea of conscious AI, though we cannot refute it categorically, is silly. This has a lot to do with the fact that most computer scientists are power users of computers but they’ve never built a computer themselves. If they had, they would be familiar with the nuts and bolts, and they would understand that the idea of microscopic transistors becoming conscious is not that different than proposing that a sufficiently complex sewage system—consisting of water pipes and valves—would become conscious.\n\nHans Busstra, MA\n\n2276\n\nReading\n\n|\n\nMetaphysics\n\nWhen we dream of a triangle, we experience a geometric shape with the measurable characteristics—angles and lengths—of a triangle. But the neural correlates of this dream in the physical brain are not triangular. So if all that exists is physicality, where in the physical world is the dream triangle? In this essay, Arthur Haswell not only elaborates rigorously on this thought experiment, but also anticipates and addresses various possible objections. The conclusion, he claims, is that the experiment demonstrates that there is more to reality than what we colloquially call ‘the physical.’\n\nArthur Haswell, BA\n\n3784\n\nSeeing\n\n|\n\nPhilosophy\n\nNatalia Vorontsova talks to Dr Tom Cheetham about active imagination, consciousness and life-changing experiences in the context of the philosophy and theology of Henry Corbin, Ibn Arabi and Surhawardi.

The fall into the phenomenal world of perceptual experience appears from this psychoanalytical perspective as the “I” development of the human being. The subsequent expulsion from paradise and the loss of the immediate presence of God are the trauma of this fundamental loss.\n\nDr. Ludwig Sachs\n\n2752\n\nReading\n\n|\n\nPhilosophy\n\nProf. James Tartaglia advocates for a revival of metaphysical idealism, arguing that it is misunderstood and often unfairly dismissed by the scientific establishment. By clarifying common misconceptions, Tartaglia reveals how idealism could offer significant social benefits, encouraging a more philosophical society focused on the primacy of experience.\n\nProf. James Tartaglia, PhD\n\n3049\n\nReading\n\n|\n\nMetaphysics\n\nThe materialist worldview robs reality of its colour, temperature, smell, leaving us with a picture that is radically at odds with our common sense understanding of the world. Helen Yetter-Chappell proposes an alternative: reality is made of experiences, woven together into an experiential tapestry that persists even when we aren’t looking.\n\nDr. Helen Yetter-Chappell\n\n3733\n\nLet us build the future of our culture together\n\nEssentia Foundation is a registered non-profit committed to making its content as accessible as possible and without advertisements.
