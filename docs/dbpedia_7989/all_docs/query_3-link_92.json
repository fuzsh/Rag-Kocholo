        "text": "Islamic philosopher. As the first of the great Arab philosophers, al-Kindi sought to reconcile Greek philosophy with Islamic theology and originated the neoplatonic school of Islamic thought, emphasizing the priority of faith over reason, as later defended by Ibn Sina.\n\nRecommended Reading: George N. Atiyeh, Al-Kindi: The Philosopher of the Arabs (Kazi, 1977).\n\nAlso see EB, SEP, and ELC.\n\nAmerican theologian and political activist. After completing his theological education at Boston University, King served as pastor of Baptist congregations in Montgomery, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia and founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, organizing and leading significant social protests against racial discrimination in the American South until his assassination in Memphis, Tennessee. His \"Letter from Birmingham City Jail\" (1963) defends the use of Gandhi's method of non-violent protest as a powerful means of achieving social cooperation, and the \"I Have a Dream\" speech (1963) expressed a lofty vision of interracial unity. His writings include Why We Can't Wait (1964), Strength to Love (1966), and Where Do We Go from Here (1967). King was awarded the Springarn Medal, the Nobel Prize for Peace (1964), and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nAlso see EB.\n\nAmerican logician and philosopher. His early work, \"A Completeness Theorem in Modal Logic\" (1959) and \"Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic (1963), focussed on technical issues in modal logic. In Naming and Necessity (1972) Kripke proposed a causal theory of referential meaning, on which proper names and natural kinds are not merely definite descriptions but rather rigid designators, whose reference must obtain in all possible worlds. On the basis of such semantics, Kripke holds that the necessary / contingent and a priori / a posteriori distinctions do not coincide. This raises significant doubts about theories that try to establish the contingent identity of mental events and brains states.\n\nAlso see EB and ELC.\n\nBulgarian-French literary critic and psychoanalyst influenced by the deconstructive methods of Derrida. In La Révolution du language poetique (The Revolution in Poetic Language) (1974) and Semeiotiche: Recherches pour une Semanalyse (Desire in Language: A Semiotic Approach to Literature and Art) (1980), she distinguishes between the pre-linguistic (feminine) semiotic of subjectivity on the one hand and the (masculine) symbolic representation of logic and language on the other. Kristeva describes ways in which literature (especially \"feminine writing\") can combine both in a joyful symbolic representation of the more fundamental semiotic reality. Powers of Horror (1981), Histoires d'amour (Tales of Love) (1983), and Soleil Noir (Black Sun) (1987) offer thorough analyses of horror, romantic love, melancholy, and depression. Kristeva's application of her central themes to political thought may be found in Etrangers à nous-même (Strangers to Ourselves) (1988).\n\nAlso see FTW and EB.\n\nQueen of Sweden (from 1632) who pursued wide-ranging intellectual interests and corresponded with many of the seventeenth century's leading thinkers. Both Grotius and Descartes (to their peril) visited her court, and she published her Lettres de Descartes (Correspondence with Descartes) (1663). Kristina greatly admired the skepticism of Sextus Empiricus and Gassendi. After her refusal to marry led to a decision to abdicate the throne in 1654, Kristina first became an outspoken atheist and then converted to Catholicism.\n\nRecommended Reading: Susanna Akerman, Queen Christina of Sweden and Her Circle: The Transformation of a Seventeenth-Century Philosophical Libertine (Brill, 1991).\n\nAlso see Bill Uzgalis, ELC, and EB.\n\nAmerican philosopher of science. In The Structure of Scientific Revolution (1962, 1970) Kuhn emphasized the discontinuity of scientific progress, characterized by long periods of \"normal research\" (conducted entirely within the framework of a prevailing theoretical paradigm) that are punctuated by brief and largely inexplicable periods of paradigm-shifting scientific revolution. On this view, there can be no rational grounds for choosing between incommensurable paradigms, each of which solves its own set of problems. Such themes are illustrated and expanded in The Essential Tension: Selected Studies in Scientific Tradition and Change (1977) and The Road Since Structure: Philosophical Essays, 1970-1993 (2000).\n\nAlso see SEP, EB, Andy Blunden, ELC, and Frank Pajares."
