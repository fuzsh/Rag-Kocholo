        "text": "World change, reaction a: dismissal\n\nIsrael Scheffler in Science and Subjectivity, 1967, p. 19: “I cannot, myself, believe that this bleak picture, representing an extravagant idealism, is true.”\n\nThe full argument contains four premises and one conclusion (this is for the philosophers):\n\nP1: Incommensurability encompasses world change\n\nP2: World change (in revolutions) implies idealism.\n\nP3: Idealism is bullshit.\n\nP4: Bullshit can be dismissed.\n\nConclusion: Incommensurability can be dismissed.\n\nAd P2: Yes, perhaps, but what sort of idealism?\n\nAd P3: The high-school version of idealism is certainly very questionable: “What reality is depends on how you think of it” – period\n\nWas this Kuhn’s view?\n\nPaul Hoyningen-Huene, \"What is uncontroversial about Kuhn?\" (2012)\n\nWorld change, reaction c: “Neo-Kantian”\n\nFrom 1979 onward, Kuhn described his position as Kantian with “temporally mutable categories” (or in Peter Lipson’s words: Kuhn’s position is “Kant on wheels”)\n\nNote first that this cannot be entirely correct because\n\nKant’s forms of intuition and forms of thought (categories) are responsible for the constitution of what physical things in general, i.e. spatio-temporal things, are: Kant’s forms of intuition and thought are constitutibe of “thinghood”\n\nBy contrast, Kuhn’s world change does (usually) not affect thinghood itself, it only affects the existence, the qualities, and the relations of specific things."
