Let me try to persuade you to be slow in assigning me to it. I would not write this sort of letter if I did not think the view of science developed in my manuscript might prove particularly important.1\n\nLike so many authors, Thomas Kuhn, then associate professor of the history of science at the University of California, Berkeley, had come to regret an earlier publishing commitment. When he had agreed some eight years previous in 1953 to contribute an article to the International Encyclopedia of Uniﬁed Science2 titled “The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions,” Kuhn was a freshly minted assistant professor at Harvard in General Education and the history of science, subjects in which he held no degrees.3 He was ﬂattered, no doubt, by the invitation to contribute to a venture so closely associated with the Vienna Circle in exile.4 His article would appear in the best of philosophical company: Ernest Nagel on the principles of probability theory, John Dewey on the theory of valuation, Rudolf Carnap of the foundations of logic and mathematics. But as the years (and the original deadline) went by, the manuscript waxed, and so did the author’s ambitions. His ﬁrst book, The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought,5 had enjoyed sufﬁcient success to net him a joint appointment in the Departments of History and Philosophy at Berkeley; the renown of the Encyclopedia had in the meantime waned (Kuhn claimed that his primary audience of “historians, sociologists, and scientists” had never even heard of it). The “special treatment” that Kuhn was requesting in his 1961 letter to Carroll Bowen of the University of Chicago Press was not exactly a release from what he considered to be “at the very least, a strong\n\n2 / Introduction\n\nmoral commitment” to the Encyclopedia but rather “simultaneous publication in another format.”6 This is the book that became The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions,7 a book judged by the Times Literary Supplement to be among the twenty most inﬂuential books published in the second half of the twentieth century.8 The press had obliged, and with astonishing and gratifying alacrity: as Kuhn recalled a couple of years later, “Three days after I mailed a draft of my manuscript with a covering letter asking for a special publication arrangement, I had a telephone call from Chicago telling me that the Press was immensely excited to have the manuscript and that the special conditions I asked would, though unprecedented, present no problem at all.”9 Perhaps the excitement was not quite so immense as the author fondly imagined: the initial print run was prudently set at 1,000 clothbound and 2,000 paperback copies, priced at $4.00 and $3.00, respectively.10 Even the author confessed on the press’s author’s questionnaire (which has remained remarkably unchanged for over a half-century) that he had “no good ideas” in response to the standard question about which professors and institutions might be interested in using the book for classroom instruction.11 At ﬁrst, these modest estimates were conﬁrmed by sales: a respectable but not spectacular 919 copies sold in the ﬁrst year and another 774 copies a year later. But by the early 1970s, the book was selling over 40,000 copies a year and was being assigned in courses across university campuses all over the country and beyond. The ﬁrst edition sold a total of 88,538 paperback copies and the second edition (up to mid-1987), 546,455.12 The book was a sensation, its leading ideas hotly debated among natural and social scientists as well as humanists and parodied in New Yorker cartoons. Even its author, buoyantly self-conﬁdent about the signiﬁcance of his book (“the book is more ambitious and important than most of those you print,” he assured the marketing department of the press in a pitch for more than the usual publicity13), must have been taken by surprise (and sometimes aback) by his celebrity.\n\nBiographical Background Not that Kuhn was a man of small academic ambition.14 Born July 18, 1922, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Thomas Samuel Kuhn grew up in Manhattan and Croton-on-Hudson, attending the Taft School in Connecticut and later Harvard College, whence he graduated summa cum laude with a concentration in physics in 1943, after only three years of study while editing the student newspaper the Harvard Crimson on the side. Immediately\n\nIntroduction / 3\n\nthereafter, he plunged into war-related work on radar, which took him to France and then Germany at the end of the war. He returned to Harvard as a graduate student in physics in the fall semester of 1945, with John Hasbrouck Van Vleck as his thesis advisor. While there, he secured special permission to take philosophy (not history) courses, having been much impressed by an undergraduate encounter with the writings of Kant. Although he clearly was entertaining serious interests outside of physics, he completed his dissertation with dispatch and confessed later to dreaming of a Nobel Prize someday (surely his name was and is legion among physics graduate students). But the course of his academic pursuits had begun to shift decisively, largely through the intervention of the then-president of Harvard, chemist James Bryant Conant. It was Conant who saw to it that Kuhn was awarded a junior fellowship in the Harvard Society of Fellows in 1948, and it was Conant who recruited Kuhn to teach in a new General Education course that taught non–scientiﬁcally inclined Harvard undergraduates about how scientists think through a series of historical case studies. Conant had been a prominent scientiﬁc administrator during World War II and believed that a scientiﬁcally literate citizenry was essential to the future of American democracy. Kuhn was assigned the task of preparing the case study in the history of mechanics from Aristotle to Galileo, a task that soon had him reading the historical work of the German medievalist Anneliese Maier and the Russian-French philosopher and historian Alexandre Koyré, ﬁgures to whom, along with French historian of chemistry Hélène Metzger, philosopher Émile Meyerson, and American historian of ideas A. O. Lovejoy, he confessed his intellectual debt in the preface of The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions. In his own telling, however, it was reading Aristotle in the summer of 1947 that sparked Kuhn’s historical epiphany. With the sudden allat-onceness that Kuhn later likened to a Gestalt switch, he realized that Aristotle’s account of motion was not simply wrong; it was about something else entirely. Aristotle, Kuhn realized, understood motion not just as displacement from point A to point B but as a special case of all kinds of change, from the maturing of organisms to the succession of the seasons. This habit of reading the past sympathetically, in its own terms and context, made Kuhn permanently wary of what he called (borrowing the phrase from the British political historian Herbert Butterﬁeld) “Whig” history of science: narrating the history of science teleologically, as a triumphal conquest of error culminating in present scientiﬁc beliefs.15 Thereafter, Kuhn struggled to ﬁnd other narratives that would do justice\n\n4 / Introduction\n\nto scientiﬁc advances without succumbing to the siren song of the conventional (among scientists as well as historians and philosophers) story of cumulative progress approaching ever nearer to eternal truths. He ﬂirted with the analogy to Darwinian evolution, although it accorded ill with his scheme of periodic revolutions. Although the germs of the ideas for Structure were planted in the context of Conant’s General Education course at Harvard (Kuhn’s The Copernican Revolution also began as one of the case studies), the manuscript took shape in California, where Kuhn quickly rose through the academic ranks at Berkeley after his joint appointment as assistant professor in the History and Philosophy Departments in 1956 and where he spent the academic year 1958–59 as a fellow at the Stanford Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. In the early 1960s, Kuhn undertook an oral history of quantum mechanics in collaboration with John Heilbron, Paul Foreman, and Lini Allen, resulting in Sources for the History of Quantum Physics (1967). Once Structure came out in 1962, Kuhn turned his attention to the history of quantum mechanics, a project that sent him to Copenhagen in 1962–63 (where he interviewed Niels Bohr), and eventually resulted in the book Kuhn himself considered his ﬁnest work, Black-Body Radiation and the Quantum Discontinuity, 1894–1912 (1978). By the time it was published, Kuhn was about to leave Princeton, where he had accepted an appointment in 1964, for MIT, where he spent the remainder of his academic career, from 1979 until his death in 1996. Structure had brought him international fame and innumerable honors, but he apparently considered it an essay, a preliminary attempt in need of expansion and improvement. His ﬁnal, unﬁnished book manuscript was a philosophical and linguistic exploration of problems raised by the controversy over Structure, especially among philosophers provoked by Kuhn’s insistence that successive scientiﬁc paradigms were in some sense “incommensurable.”16 Despite the fact that all of his training and most of his publications concerned the physical sciences, he once again drew inspiration from biology, this time from the idea of natural kinds and taxonomic trees.\n\nThe Reception of Kuhn’s Structure Kuhn’s Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions had a gentle birth but a traumatic childhood. When Rudolf Carnap, an editor of the International Encyclopedia of Uniﬁed Science and philosopher at the University of Chicago, received Kuhn’s completed manuscript, he was undoubtedly relieved, since two previous historians who had been solicited to contribute a monograph on\n\nIntroduction / 5\n\nthe history of science had failed to deliver. Carnap congratulated Kuhn on the aptness of his essay and especially singled out a conception that he thought conformed to his own developing ideas about scientiﬁc language, namely, Kuhn’s suggestion that theory change paralleled species change as explained in Darwin’s evolutionary theory.17 Theory change, in Carnap’s assessment, was the improvement of an instrument not a better approximation to an ultimately true theory. Kuhn had deployed the evolutionary comparison only brieﬂy in the last part of the essay, but without any proposal that paradigms gradually replaced one another in an evolutionary fashion, as Darwin’s theory might have suggested. The University of Chicago Press, under Carnap’s guidance, chose Norwood Russell Hanson as one of the referees for Kuhn’s manuscript.18 The choice of Hanson, a prominent philosopher of science at Indiana University, was not accidental. Like Kuhn, Hanson had deployed examples from Gestalt psychology to exemplify comparable ideas about the theoryladenness of observation; he even used the term “paradigm” in rather similar ways, if without systematic intent.19 Hanson judged the monograph “a work of surpassing merit, scholarship, and creative ingenuity,” but he did have a salient criticism: in Popperian fashion he wanted to know what would falsify the thesis that scientiﬁc revolutions resulted from a paradigm shift. Since Kuhn did not provide independent criteria for a revolution or a shift, the thesis appeared to be analytic and not an empirical assertion: a revolution occurred when a paradigm shift took place, and a shift took place when a revolution occurred.20 Popperian considerations would continue to trouble Kuhn’s theory. In the ﬁrst three years after publication, the book garnered a generous swathe of reviews for such a slim production with a drab, gray cover— reviews from philosophers of science, historians of science, and scientists. Immediately on its publication, the historian Charles Coulston Gillispie of Princeton wrote a long, leading review in Science of “this very bold venture.” Like Carnap, he emphasized what he took to be Kuhn’s “Darwinian historiography” as congenial to his own.21 In the American Historical Review, Maria Boas Hall gave the book a gentle recommendation, ﬁnding the inﬂuence of George Sarton ﬂavoring Kuhn’s analysis—though one suspects Sarton would have found it bitter tasting.22 The sociologist Bernard Barber characterized the book as “an essay in the sociology of scientiﬁc discovery,” though he wished Kuhn had dealt more with the “external factors” inﬂuencing scientiﬁc change.23 The physicist David Bohm regarded the book as “without doubt one of the most interesting and signiﬁcant contributions that has been made in recent years in the ﬁeld of the history and philoso-\n\n6 / Introduction\n\nphy of science.”24 His own heterodox interpretation of quantum theory undoubtedly led him to appreciate Kuhn’s discontinuity thesis. While these early reviewers tended to greet Kuhn as a fellow traveler, several philosophers of science were less tolerant of the abandonment of a more traditional picture of scientiﬁc progress; they exposed contradictions, inconsistencies, and loose ends in Kuhn’s conception. Dudley Shapere at the University of Chicago provided a token last cigarette—allowing that it was an “important” book—before he ﬁred relentlessly into the heart of Kuhn’s thesis, aiming to show that the term “paradigm” covered a range of factors yet without a clearly speciﬁable meaning—a charge that would later be made even more deadly. Shapere delighted in exposing the logical conundrums endemic to the concept of incommensurability, scattering Kuhn’s conﬂicting statements about progress through the last pages of a brutal review.25 Mary Hesse, at the University of Cambridge, also found the book “important,” though she trod more gently on the several major inconsistencies she found in the argument.26 H. V. Stopes-Roe, a littlepublished philosopher at Birmingham University, did not even grant a polite condescension before enumerating the mind-stopping contradictions he found in Kuhn’s thesis.27 The reactions of reviewers were prelude to an event that set the attitude for a signiﬁcant portion of Kuhn’s readers. In 1965, a meeting of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science was held in London titled “Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge,” a theme central to the convictions of Karl Popper, who presided as the meeting’s chair. Kuhn was invited to be a principal speaker, along with Paul Feyerabend (Kuhn’s colleague at Berkeley) and Imré Lakatos, both of growing reputation for taking a deviant stance. Neither of the latter two ﬁnished their papers on time for the conference, so Kuhn’s contribution became a central focus of the discussants, who included the aforementioned along with Stephen Toulmin, L. Pearce Williams, Margaret Masterman, and John Watkins. All of the papers were published four years later, after the tardy authors ﬁnished their contributions (Lakatos’s “Falsiﬁcation and the Methodology of Scientiﬁc Research Programmes” ran to over one hundred pages, and became itself quite inﬂuential and more dependent on Kuhn than the author admitted). Kuhn was allowed to answer his critics in the published volume Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge.28 Kuhn came ready for combat. After pointing out several features of his theory consonant with those of Popper, he set his sights on the principle of falsiﬁcation itself, arguing that only an observation statement, rather than a physical observation of the kind Popper thought crucial, could refute a\n\nIntroduction / 7\n\ngeneral theory. After all, we might decide that an actual observation was mismeasured, that it was actually irrelevant, that something interfered with the outcome, and so on.29 Popper simply ignored the objection, but did grant that Kuhn made an important distinction between normal science and extraordinary, paradigm-shifting science. Popper, however, knew how to avoid a critical objection: he contended that so-called normal science arose from poor training, in which tyros had not been taught to exercise their critical faculties; in proper science, there were only degrees of difference between smaller changes in theory and groundbreaking changes. What really disturbed Popper—something that became a burr under the saddle of many high-riding philosophers and a stimulus for the new sociologists of science—was Kuhn’s explicit contention that the logic of falsiﬁcationism cannot explain paradigm change but that the explanation must, “in the ﬁnal analysis, be psychological or sociological.”30 Popper simply rejected the appeal to social factors to explain fundamental change as the merest “relativism.”31 The charge of relativism would reverberate through the philosophical literature—given force by Lakatos’s epitome of Kuhn’s work as “science by mob-rule”—and it continued to bedevil Kuhn to the end. Masterman’s analysis struck a comparably tender spot. She found twenty-one different meanings for “paradigm” in the book, which is to say, there was no clear meaning at all.32 Kuhn had to grant that his treatment was “badly confused.” He also recognized that he had to salvage the idea of scientiﬁc progress, a concept he did not really wish to abandon. As a solution to the problem of progress, he came to rely more and more on the conception he had mentioned only in passing in his book but that others had emphasized: “my view of scientiﬁc development,” he declared, “is fundamentally evolutionary.”33 The deﬁnition of paradigm and the problem of progress would occupy the epilogue of the second edition of Structure. While philosophers through the 1970s continued to confront Kuhn forcefully on the issue of incommensurability, the new movement of social constructionism looked to Kuhn as having established the role of social factors in major scientiﬁc change. Barry Barnes, in a little book that echoed the London conference volume—Interests and the Growth of Knowledge— maintained that Kuhn had “demonstrate[d] that fundamental theoretical transitions in science are not simply rational responses to increased knowledge of reality.”34 Sociology of science need not remain at the sidelines of knowledge formation, rather under Kuhn it could become a major player in the explanation of scientiﬁc development. A survey of some 1,785 journals in history, history of science, philosophy, social sciences, and biology shows that articles mentioning Kuhn’s\n\n8 / Introduction\n\nStructure climbed steadily from 1962 to about 1980 and then leveled off till about 2000, with a gentle decline thereafter—with the exception of mention in journals of biology, which, after reaching a plateau, maintained a constant number of citations through 2010.35\n\nThe Occasion of this Volume These days it is barely imaginable that a manuscript of approximately ﬁfty thousand words with no footnotes or bibliography36 by a relatively unknown scholar would ever make it past the straight and narrow gate of a reputable academic press, much less that the publishers would so graciously accede to the demanding author’s every wish (including a belated request that additional copies be sent to reviewers in the ﬁelds of psychology, psychoanalysis, and social science, even though Kuhn ingenuously admitted that he had “no notion of what the corresponding journals are”37) and whim (concerning the customary index, Kuhn queried hopefully, “Does a volume of this sort need an index? I wouldn’t be surprised but I’m damned if I know how one would devise one? Paradigm, 11–74, passim”38). Kuhn had good reason to be pleased with his publishers. The University of Chicago Press was ﬁrst the indulgent (or shrewd, depending on one’s point of view) and later (as sales ballooned) the grateful publisher of The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions, and so it seemed entirely appropriate that it sponsor an event to commemorate the ﬁftieth anniversary of its publication in Chicago in December 2012, in collaboration with the Fishbein Center for the History of Science and Medicine at the University of Chicago and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. The editors are especially grateful to Karen Darling and Christie Henry of the press and to Special Collections at the Regenstein Library of the University of Chicago for putting together an exhibition of correspondence relating to the book’s publication and multiple editions and translations to accompany the conference, as well as for permission to quote materials from the archives of the press. Speakers at the conference were given complete freedom as to what aspect of Kuhn’s book they wished to address—its prehistory, its claims, its inﬂuence, its current signiﬁcance—so the resulting papers are probably a fair sample of the diverse concerns that the book still raises for historians, philosophers, and sociologists. Some of the papers situate the book in the context of Kuhn’s own intellectual biography: his experiences as a physics graduate student doing quintessential “normal science” (Peter Galison), his close relationships with psychologists both before and after the pub-\n\nIntroduction / 9\n\nlication of Structure (David Kaiser), the Cold War framework of concepts such as “worldview” and “paradigm” (George Reisch). Andrew Abbott makes the citation history of the book the occasion for an analysis of its shifting audiences—and changes in scholarly reading habits. Other papers address the import of key Kuhnian concepts both then and now: “revolution” (Daniel Garber), “scientiﬁc community” (M. Norton Wise), and, inevitably, the elusive yet still enticing “paradigm” (Angela Creager, Lorraine Daston, and Ian Hacking). All of the participants in the two-day conference were struck and perhaps somewhat startled by the intensity of the discussion. At ﬁfty, The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions still engages, excites, and occasionally enrages its readers. This is grounds for surprise. At least among historians, philosophers, and sociologists of science, words like “paradigm” and “incommensurability” nowadays have a quaint ring to them. Shouting matches over the alleged irrationality of the resolution of scientiﬁc revolutions no longer enliven scholarly meetings. We are all post-Kuhnian—yet no one is indifferent to Kuhn’s provocative essay. This volume is a testament to the enduring power of the book to stimulate long after it has ceased to be the center of raging disputes—and also to the courage and canniness of a press that knew a good thing when it saw one.\n\nNotes 1.\n\n2.\n\n3. 4.\n\n5. 6. 7.\n\nThomas S.

In Structure (pp.171–72), he used it to observe that like Darwin’s theory his own did not postulate a goal directed process; there was development from but not development toward. In his “Reﬂections” essay, he further suggested that each succeeding species had solved increasingly more problems in its environment, just as succeeding paradigms had, and so in both a sense of progress might be retained. The Darwinian analogy became ever more salient for Kuhn, as might be suggested by the tentative title to the manuscript he was working on when he died: “The Plurality of Worlds: An Evolutionary Theory of Scientiﬁc Discovery.” See Heilbron, “Thomas Samuel Kuhn, 18 July 1922–17 June 1996.” 34.

For the plateaus reached in the interval of 1975–1980: of 484 social science journals, 613 articles mentioned Structure; of 402 history journals, 232 articles; of 103 philosophy journals, 201 articles; and of 484 biology journals, 53 articles. From 2000 until 2010, the level was about 400 articles in social sciences, 160 in history, 175 in philosophy, and 68 in biology (which thus had a rise in the number of articles mentioning the book). Andrew Abbott, in “Notes on Structure and Sociology” (this volume), has shown that citation to Kuhn’s work in humanities, religion, and social sciences climbed linearly until about 1985 and then leveled off at about 450 a year thereafter. 36.

Riggs.\n\nONE\n\nAristotle in the Cold War: On the Origins of Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions GEORGE A. REISCH\n\nThe famous opening of The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions announces the inspiration behind Thomas Kuhn’s revolutionary account of science: History, if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or chronology, could produce a decisive transformation in the image of science by which we are now possessed.1\n\nFor myself, and I suspect many others, this has long been a crucial feature of Kuhn’s pioneering work. While he may have gotten some things wrong and gone a little overboard in his talk about “changing worlds,” he was right that looking at historical realities, at what he called “research activity itself,”2 is essential for understanding science. Lately, I’ve come to reject this picture of Structure’s achievement. Speaking about his historiographic style, Kuhn said he always tried to “get inside the heads” of earlier scientists.3 But Structure’s claims about what occurs in scientists’ heads during scientiﬁc revolutions appear to be less informed by primary historical sources and more by something inside Kuhn’s head, namely, a conception of scientiﬁc revolutions that dates to a particular moment in his life. It occurred in 1947, ﬁfteen years before Structure was published. Kuhn called it his “Aristotle experience” and regarded it as crucial for his intellectual development. His publications and papers, including his drafts and outlines for Structure as well as his correspondence with his mentor, Harvard president and Manhattan Project administrator James Bryant Conant, conﬁrm that the Aristotle experience was the seed from which Structure\n\nAristotle in the Cold War / 13\n\ngrew. My claim here is that the more we understand the Aristotle experience and how Kuhn responded to and utilized it, the more we can see how ﬁrmly Structure and its conception of science was rooted in the distinctive culture of the early Cold War. One of these roots is an image of what I call “the scientiﬁc mind” and, in particular, the mind’s relationships to experience and the ideas within it. Some of this mind’s properties have been long familiar to readers of Structure—it experiences Gestalt shifts in perception and understanding, its observations are “theory laden” and shaped by background beliefs, it accepts new paradigms not on the grounds of strict logical proof, but rather, persuasion. In the context of the early Cold War, however, a similar image of the mind circulated, albeit in a form highly politicized and, in some cases, militarized. Kuhn’s image of the scientiﬁc mind whose theoretical commitments and perceptions were transformed when history replaced one paradigm with another was not unlike the mind of American GIs in Korea who were thought to have been “brainwashed” by captors who replaced their liberal ideas and values with those of communism. This was also the mind of the American public that anticommunists such as Senator McCarthy and J. Edgar Hoover sought to protect from communist ideology. And it was the young, impressionable mind of college students, the future leaders of America, whom Conant and other university administrators struggled to shield from communist faculty and the powerful ideology that rendered those professors, as the conventional wisdom then held, unﬁt to teach.\n\nThe Aristotle Experience Kuhn’s most detailed description of his Aristotle experience appears in a lecture from 1981. The experience occurred in the summer of 1947, he recalled, shortly after he began working alongside Conant to develop and teach Natural Science 4, Conant’s pioneering attempt to teach science using historical case studies. Being a chemist, Conant asked Kuhn, then ﬁnishing his Ph.D. in physics, to develop case studies in the history of physics. That’s when it happened. I was sitting at my desk with the text of Aristotle’s Physics open in front of me. . . . Looking up, I gazed abstractedly out the window of my room—the visual image is one I still retain. Suddenly the fragments in my head sorted themselves out in a new way, and fell into place together. My jaw dropped, for all at once Aristotle seemed a very good physicist indeed, but of a sort I’d never dreamed possible.4\n\n14 / Reisch\n\nKuhn was suddenly convinced that Conant’s account of science evolving freely from one conceptual scheme to another, accumulating knowledge and perspective along the way, had to be at least partly wrong. This was the account Kuhn knew from On Understanding Science, a book Conant published that year and which Kuhn proofread as its pages came off the Yale University Press. That summer afternoon, however, Kuhn glimpsed something that Conant’s image of science could not explain, namely, that Aristotle’s physics was not simply mistaken. Instead, it could be understood in a way that made much sense—but only when apprehended along with an array of basic theoretical concepts that were excluded by, and inconsistent with, those presupposed by Newtonian physics. As he would later say of the famous duck-rabbit illusion, Kuhn could see either the Aristotelian duck or the Newtonian rabbit, but not both at the same time.5 Structure was conceived at that moment. “Oh, look,” Kuhn later told interviewers as he contrasted Structure to his ﬁrst book, The Copernican Revolution, which largely follows Conant’s picture of science: I had wanted to write The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions ever since the Aristotle experience. That’s why I had gotten into history of science—I didn’t know quite what it was going to look like, but I knew the noncumulativeness; and I knew about what I took revolutions to be . . . but that was what I really wanted to be doing.6\n\nEven as early as 1953, when The Copernican Revolution and Structure were unﬁnished, Kuhn contrasted them in a grant application and nodded to Structure as “closest to my ultimate purpose as a scholar.”7\n\nThe Aristotle Experience: 1957–1979 An early reference to the Aristotle experience appears in Kuhn’s notes for a talk, “A Historian Views the Philosophy of Science,” which Kuhn gave at Berkeley in 1957. Eight years earlier, the notes indicate, Kuhn had been a physicist, but “then got invited to assist in a course that involved much H of S. Read it for ﬁrst time, and particularly read sources.”8 This, Kuhn exclaimed, was a “shocking experience.” His notes read, “Nothing in my physics education or my philosophy reading had prepared me for the way science looks when viewed through writings of dead scientists.” The word “shock” appears twice again as he elaborated the differences between science described in textbooks and science revealed in “letters, diaries, laboratory notebooks and, above all, in the articles in scientiﬁc\n\nAristotle in the Cold War / 15\n\nperiodicals published ten, twenty, thirty years before theory was ready to be embodied in a text.”9 The shocking experience appears again in a letter Kuhn wrote to Conant in June of 1961. Months before, he had sent Conant a draft of Structure with the hope that his mentor would like the book and allow a dedication. But Conant was not much impressed. After some opening pleasantries and encouragement, he ﬁrmly criticized Kuhn’s overuse of the word “paradigm,” his neglect of the “practical arts” and their role in science’s history, and his claim that all scientiﬁc revolutions involve a change of worldview—a claim that Conant found “too grandiose” and responsible for creating in the manuscript “needless trouble about progress,” that is, scientiﬁc progress.10 At the end of this critique, Conant offered a suggestion, one that Gary Hardcastle has aptly compared to criticism Tennessee Williams might have received about a dress rehearsal for A Streetcar Named Desire—along the lines of, “Look, this play has promise. But that character Blanche has just got to go.” Indeed, Conant gently encouraged Kuhn to drop paradigms from the book’s cast of characters and make do with the familiar language of “conceptual schemes,” “climate of opinion,” and other such formulations. The Aristotle experience appears in Kuhn’s defensive reply to Conant’s charge of “needless trouble about progress.” Kuhn wrote: You opened On Understanding Science by discussing cumulativeness as the distinguishing feature of science. You then sent me off to look at preNewtonian dynamics. I returned from that assignment convinced that science was not cumulative in the most important sense. Newton was not trying to do Aristotle’s job better; rather Aristotle had been trying to do a different job and one that Newton did not do so well. Would you say that home industry was merely a less effective way of doing what the factory system later did?11\n\nNow Steve Fuller has claimed that Kuhn wrote Structure effectively at the behest of Conant,12 but this exchange shows Kuhn rebelling against his mentor and defending his new theory of paradigms. Kuhn’s defense continued into the manuscript itself, to which he added another chapter, “The Priority of Paradigms,” which elaborates what Kuhn told Conant in this exchange: paradigms are indispensable for understanding science because they are prior to and more fundamental than the theories, conceptual schemes, or climates of opinion recognized in extant accounts of how science works.\n\n16 / Reisch\n\nWhen Structure was published, Kuhn alluded to the Aristotle experience in its introduction. He thanked Conant for exposing him to the history of science and wrote: “to my complete surprise, that exposure to out-ofdate scientiﬁc theory and practice radically undermined some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and the reasons for its special success.”13 In a lecture at Michigan State in 1968, “shock” and “surprise” were joined by Kuhn’s “astonishment” to discover “that science, when encountered in historical source materials, seemed a very different enterprise from the one implicit in science pedagogy and explicit in standard philosophical accounts of scientiﬁc method.”14 By the time he wrote his preface to The Essential Tension, his collection of essays in 1977, Kuhn had begun to describe the Aristotle experience not as the result of extended historical studies in primary sources but rather as a sudden epiphany or “revelation”—a singular moment when the “perplexities” he had always encountered in Aristotle’s Physics “suddenly vanished.”15 The chronicle within his account now ﬂowed in reverse. What had been a shocking discovery that ﬂowed out of historical study became an epiphany that now preceded his study of history. “Since that decisive episode in 1947,” he explained, the “lessons learned while reading Aristotle have also informed my readings of men like Boyle and Newton, Lavoisier and Dalton, or Boltzmann and Planck.” The decisive episode, in other words, had itself become a guiding paradigm for Kuhn’s future historiography. It revealed “a global sort of change in the way men viewed nature and applied language to it”; it was a revelation, he explained, that informed his “subsequent search for best readings” of historical source material.16\n\nThe Scientiﬁc Mind and Experience So was Kuhn’s Aristotle experience a result of his historical research or was it a guiding intuition about knowledge, about “the way men viewed nature,” that preceded it? My view is that the Aristotle experience came ﬁrst. This shocking experience of 1947 rather quickly led Kuhn to formulate the essential core of the philosophy of science he would debut in Structure ﬁfteen years later. Before the Aristotle experience, his conception of science was fairly conventional and, indeed, conventionalist with regard to theories. When it came to the status of “sense experience” or “data,” Kuhn was a proud positivist. In an undergraduate essay from the early 1940s titled “The Metaphysical Possibilities of Physics,” a young Kuhn was comfortable with the idea that the deep metaphysics of the world, whatever it may be,\n\nAristotle in the Cold War / 17\n\nsupported many different and possible theories, all of which he described as “ﬁctions.” Yet this young Kuhn was not yet Kuhnian, for these “ﬁctions,” he said, were constrained by a stable, independent realm of scientiﬁc “data” and “sense impression”: But while the concepts of physics expand and the narrow ﬁctions are replaced by broader ones, the structure of physics remains unshaken, for the basis of this structure is data, not concepts, and no change in concepts can invalidate the data.17\n\nThe Aristotle experience, however, revealed that this was not true. Concepts could, in a way, “invalidate” scientiﬁc data. In 1949, shortly after it occurred, Kuhn’s papers show him toying with various philosophical and psychological mechanisms that might explain how this ‘invalidation’ might work. In a sprawling, highly edited, and late-night document that he ﬁled under “Incomplete Memos and Ideas, 1949,” he outlined a theory of language, speciﬁcally of connotation and denotation that might explain his shocking experience. His guiding idea was that our normal experience of the world was overwhelmingly dense, complex, and ﬁlled with epistemic possibilities. We can manage this overﬂow only because our natural language “cuts” or simplify experience for us: What I’m getting at is that natural language provides a ﬁnite means of mediating an inﬁnitely complex universe. . . . Put more accurately—we in fact live in a world much more complex than our language admits. If we are to act in it, we must simplify it, and our choice of a particular manner of simpliﬁcation (a cut) is pragmatically determined and is embodied in our language.18\n\nTwo systems of physics, in other words, can be consistent and sensible within themselves but utterly different and incompatible side by side if each cuts and reduces the original fullness of experience in mutually inconsistent ways. The scientiﬁc mind as Kuhn was beginning to understand it was unaware of these cuts and simpliﬁcations of experience. They were presupposed and embedded in ordinary language. Two years later, Kuhn slightly modiﬁed this picture when describing his current research interests to an administrator in the General Education program. He began again with the overwhelming complexity of a world that “permits an inﬁnity of independent observations” and required “a choice of those aspects of experience which are to be deemed relevant.” But this choice was not made deliber-\n\n18 / Reisch\n\nately and consciously by scientists. It was rather made for them by what Kuhn now called an unconscious “predisposition” toward one and only one of the many theories available. “The judgment of relevancy,” he explained, “is made on a largely unconscious basis in which commonsense experience and pre-existing scientiﬁc theories are intimately intermingled.” As a result, objective observation is, in an important sense, a contradiction in terms. Any particular set of observations in science (or everyday life) presupposes a predisposition toward a conceptual scheme of a corresponding sort . . . [that] leads the scientist to ignore or discard certain portions of experience in formulating or verifying his theories. But the same ‘predisposition’ exerts a far more fundamental inﬂuence in directing the scientist’s attention to particular abstract aspects of experience and blocking his perception of alternate abstractions.19\n\nBy 1951, then, Structure’s philosophy of science was largely in place: experience underdetermines theory, theory and observation were dependent and “intermingled,” theories were understood as holistic sets of ideas or conceptual schemes, and the scientiﬁc mind was unaware that it operates within only one possible system of ideas and that its “perception of alternate abstractions” was “block[ed]”—a lack of awareness that in Structure would lead Kuhn to characterize scientiﬁc revolutions as “invisible” to most scientists. This philosophy of science guided the case studies presented in Structure, and it plausibly explained the shock and astonishment of the Aristotle experience: until that very moment, the integrity and consistency of Aristotle’s physics had been obscured, or “blocked,” in Kuhn’s mind by Newton’s physics and the different cuts and selections from experience on which it rests. Now, Kuhn was becoming Kuhnian and he had effectively taken back his undergraduate proclamation. In his own mind, and in the history of science, Newton’s physics had invalidated and obscured some empirical data—data that was available to ancients and medievals but not to those who cut the world up along the lines of classical physics. What was missing at this early stage, of course, was Kuhn’s theory of paradigms. But as his difﬁcult exchange with Conant illustrates, paradigms were a late development. Kuhn had used the word before, but in the summer of 1960 he hit on the distinctive formulation that allowed him to ﬁnish the monograph he had long before promised Charles Morris, his main contact in Chicago for the International Encyclopedia of Uniﬁed Science. His\n\nAristotle in the Cold War / 19\n\nnew conception of paradigms ﬁnally clariﬁed to his satisfaction the “tacit” and nonpropositional character of consensus within a scientiﬁc community and allowed him to ﬁnish Structure.20 There can be no doubt, however, that paradigms performed the same essential, experience-simplifying roles he had earlier assigned to language and then to “predispositions.” During “normal science,” a paradigm guided scientists to understand nature in certain ways, and to apply that understanding to only limited regions of experience. As he put it in the chapter “The Route to Normal Science,” it guided scientists to “only some special part of the too sizable and inchoate pool of information” that the world presented to us. This guidance, moreover, was largely unconscious: “Scientists work from models acquired through education and through subsequent exposure to the literature often without quite knowing or needing to know what characteristics have given these models the status of community paradigms.”21\n\nThe Captive Scientiﬁc Mind To borrow from another famous Cold War book, Czesław Miłosz’s collection of anticommunist essays titled The Captive Mind from 1953, Kuhn’s normal scientists were mentally held captive by the paradigm under which they worked. Miłosz and Kuhn were both at Berkeley in the late 1950s. My claim, though, is not that Kuhn adopted this image of the mind from Miłosz or from popular anticommunists like Hoover and McCarthy, who routinely appealed to it. For the image of the captive communist mind had taken root in academic culture generally—and at Harvard speciﬁcally, where Conant grappled with this national worry about communist faculty precisely during the years he and Kuhn collaborated, from 1947 to 1953. Conant was no stranger to this notion that certain ideas could captivate the human mind and prevent it from recognizing other ideas and possibilities—in politics or in the history of science. In his On Understanding Science, for example, he was fascinated (as Kuhn was later in Structure) with the powerful idea of phlogiston and its “almost paralyzing hold on [the] minds” of early chemists. “A chemist reading the papers of the phlogistonists clutches his head in despair,” Conant exclaimed, as “he seems to be transported to an Alice-through-the-looking-glass world!” Here, one sees how otherwise very intelligent scientists “twisted and squirmed to accommodate the quantitative facts of calcinations with the phlogiston theory” and remained mired in “a hopeless position.”22 For anticommunist intellectuals like Conant, Miłosz, and many others, communists were also mired in a hopeless position—inside the all-\n\n20 / Reisch\n\nembracing ideology of Marxism that warped perceptions, impaired judgment, and furnished the true believer with a never-ending supply of rationalizations. Conant’s biographer, James Hershberg, has explained that, while the Harvard president had always rejected communism, until 1949 he saw it largely as a mistaken but benign ideology, one that the democratic West could hope to defeat and outlast by cultivating and demonstrating the superior virtues of liberal democracy. Yet that year Conant too experienced a relatively sudden conversion. It was triggered by a cluster of ominous events: Klaus Fuchs, one of Conant’s Manhattan Project physicists, was revealed to be a Russian spy; the unexpected news that the Soviets had devised an atomic bomb; and in 1950, the invasion of Southern Korea by Northern Korean and Manchurian forces, a development widely seen as proof that the Soviets were intent on world domination. Before his “conversion to cold warrior,” according to Hershberg, Conant had always resisted calls for campus investigations of suspected communist professors; and he had defended academic freedom as an exceptionless principle.23 But those worrisome events as well as increasing pressure from the Harvard Corporation, from anticommunists in Washington, and from the public (see ﬁgure 1.1), led Conant to qualify how far he would go to protect communist faculty. “As long as I am President of the University,” the Harvard Crimson reported him saying that June of 1949, “I can assure you there will be no policy of inquiry into the political views of the members of the staff and no watching over their activities as citizens.” There was, however, a “single exception” to Conant’s current thinking on the matter: In this period of a cold war, I do not believe the usual rules as to political parties apply to the Communist party. I am convinced that conspiracy and calculated deceit have been and are the characteristic pattern of behavior of regular Communists all over the world. For these reasons, as far as I am concerned, card holding members of the Communist party are out of bounds as members of the teaching profession. I should not want to be a party to the appointment of such a person to a teaching position with tenure in any educational institution.24\n\nCommunists were “out of bounds,” because they had sacriﬁced their intellectual freedom to their politics. They engaged in “conspiracy and calculated deceit” not by choice or reason but because the dogmatic strings of dialectical materialism, the ofﬁcial philosophy of the Soviet Union, had turned them into puppets of Moscow. Conant did not create this rationalization. It was largely the invention\n\nAristotle in the Cold War / 21\n\nFigure 1.1. “Do Colleges Have to Hire Red Professors?” The cover of American Legion Magazine, November 1951, illustrating popular concerns about communist faculty and their subversive inﬂuence on young students’ minds.\n\nof New York University philosopher Sidney Hook, who tirelessly organized against communism and left-leaning academics during these years. As can be seen in ﬁgure 1.2, the banner behind Hook indicates that the problem with communists and fellow traveling sympathizers was that their minds were not “free.” Their political ideas formed a “frontier” beyond which their natural intellects could not go. As with Kuhn’s normal scientists, certain realms of experience were “discarded” and alternative theoretical possibilities were “blocked” from contemplation. That is why, as Hook argued in his books and in magazine and newspaper articles, communist faculty were simply unable to fulﬁll their professional responsibilities as critical, independent, and creative thinkers. Hook began to review Conant’s books in the New York Times in 1948, and they later met in person at MIT’s midcentury convocation in 1949.\n\n22 / Reisch\n\nFigure 1.2. Sidney Hook speaking at the counterdemonstration he organized against the Scientiﬁc and Cultural Conference for World Peace, New York City, March 1949. (Photo from British Pathé newsreel “Battle of the Pickets,” used with permission.)\n\nThey subsequently exchanged letters, with Hook usually alerting Conant to some issue, event, or article related to the anticommunist perspective they shared.25 According to Hershberg, this New York–Cambridge alliance and “the Conant–Hook thesis that Communist Party members were ipso facto unqualiﬁed to teach” largely set the terms of debate over communist teachers, loyalty oaths, and campus investigations in the 1950s.26 I’ve argued elsewhere that these debates helped transform philosophy of science in North America during the Cold War, largely by making intellectual and social life difﬁcult for philosophers who carried the torch for the unity of science program that was originally promoted by the left wing of the Vienna Circle.27 In the case of Kuhn and his Aristotle experience, however, America’s Cold War preoccupation with mental captivity and sudden ideological conversion was constructive for postwar history and philosophy of science. On the way toward formulating his mature theory of paradigms, Kuhn\n\nAristotle in the Cold War / 23\n\nheld a conception of these “predispositions” that unmistakably nods to the era’s fascination with powerful ideologies. In 1953, Kuhn wrote to Morris to propose as the title of his essay “The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions” and to explain that its main subject would be “the functions of a theory as a professional ideology for the practicing scientist.” Understood as an ideology, theories performed the same two functions, both directing and restricting scientiﬁc thought and perception, that he had earlier assigned to language and predispositions and would later assign to paradigms. He explained: A theory serves to direct the scientist’s attention to certain sorts of problems as “useful” and to certain sorts of measurements as “important;” it dictates preferred techniques of interpretation, and it sets standards of precision in experiment and of rigor in reasoning. Above all, the theory, as ideology, is a source simultaneously of essential direction and of disasterous [sic] inhibition to the creative imagination.\n\nKuhn even considered using “ideology” in the title of his monograph, but he had second thoughts.28 Still, he used the word and its variants liberally in notes and outlines for the monograph, as well as in a grant application to the Guggenheim Foundation that he wrote later that year. His forthcoming monograph, he wrote, would be “devoted to the role of established scientiﬁc theories as ideologies” that provide “restraints upon the creative imagination.”29\n\nParadigms and Conversion Experiences By the time Kuhn completed Structure, of course, “ideologies” had given way to “paradigms” (no doubt to Charles Morris’s great relief). But Structure and the Aristotle experience that inspired it remain wedded to the surrounding discourse about the possibilities for “ideological conversion” of the captive Cold War mind. Consider the genre of confessional literature that helped many postwar intellectuals, especially former communists, establish their liberal bona ﬁdes. The locus classicus of this genre is The God that Failed: A Confession, published in 1950, a volume in which Arthur Koestler, Richard Wright, Andre Gide, and other former leftist intellectuals described their growing doubts and then their decisive, and often dramatic, breaks with communism. Koestler’s story is suggestive. Like Kuhn, he was a physicist turned (among other things) historian of science—his Sleepwalkers (1959) remains\n\n24 / Reisch\n\na classic account of Copernicanism alongside Kuhn’s ﬁrst book, The Copernican Revolution (1957). In The God that Failed, Koestler recalled his original conversion to Marxism using much the same language Kuhn would later use to describe his revelation from Aristotle. Koestler’s conversion also occurred when he was reading: Tired of electrons and wave mechanics, I began for the ﬁrst time to read Marx, Engels, and Lenin in earnest. By the time I had ﬁnished with [Marx’s Theses on] Feuerbach and [Lenin’s] State and Revolution, something had clicked in my brain which shook me like a mental explosion. To say that one had “seen the light” is a poor description of the mental rapture which only the convert knows (regardless of the faith he has been converted to). The new light seems to pour from all directions across the skull; the whole universe falls into a pattern like the stray pieces of a jigsaw puzzle assembled by magic at one stroke.30\n\nKuhn did not become a dogmatic Aristotelian in the same way that Koestler became, for many years, a dogmatic Marxist. But the scientists Kuhn portrayed in his case studies of revolutions became dogmatic partisans of a paradigm and spoke of “the ‘scales falling from the eyes’ or of the ‘lighting ﬂash’ that ‘inundates’ a previously obscure puzzle.”31 Kuhn placed this “parallelism” between scientiﬁc and political revolutions in the title of his monograph and defended it in the ﬁrst few pages of his chapter “The Nature and Necessity of Scientiﬁc Revolutions.” Though he made no attempt to connect these ideological dynamics in science to the ongoing problem of communist professors, Koestler found the connection obvious. It was precisely this exquisite “rapture” of mental captivity that explained how “with eyes to see and brains with which to think,” Koestler wrote, there could remain unreconstructed communist intellectuals who “still act in subjective bona ﬁdes, anno Domini 1949.”32\n\nIn substance, Kuhn’s conversion experience—his Aristotle experience— was scholarly and apolitical. But its form was inherited from the surrounding preoccupation with ideology and ideological conversion. The intellectual and psychological dynamics—the manner by which one system of belief and its attendant “cuts” in experience could be replaced wholesale and almost instantaneously with an exclusive alternative—are the same whether the ideas in question are political (with Koestler) or scientiﬁc (with Kuhn).33 Thus, having personally experienced something\n\nAristotle in the Cold War / 25\n\nlike an ideological conversion in struggling to understand Aristotle’s physics on that hot summer day in 1947, Kuhn would soon glimpse the exciting prospect of a highly original theory of science, one that embraced and normalized this current image of the human mind as pathologically held captive by its ideas and applied that image to the understanding of science and its history. Consider again Conant’s descriptions of phlogiston chemists struggling irrationally to preserve their beliefs in the face of counterevidence. Inspired by the Aristotle experience, Kuhn realized that in offering descriptions such as those, Conant had picked up the wrong end of the stick. While these particular chemists may have been in a “hopeless position,” chemistry itself was going strong—not in spite of, but because of, these stubborn, dogmatic phlogistonists who were laying the groundwork for an important revolution in chemistry. That the human mind could be held captive and prevented from exploring other points of view and other regimes of primitive experience—precisely what the Aristotle experience had ﬁrst revealed to Kuhn—was necessary for scientiﬁc revolutions to occur and therefore necessary for science’s dramatic historical success.\n\nFrom “Indoctrination” to “Dogmatism” Was Kuhn aware that his insights about the human mind were deeply rooted in the Cold War culture? His use of the word “ideology,” albeit temporarily in the mid 1950s, would suggest that he did,34 as does an earlier controversy at Harvard over ofﬁcer training on campus. It began the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 when Conant announced to the university community that he would “pledge all of the resources of Harvard University” to the new war effort.35 In coming months, he pushed forward to militarize the campus for ofﬁcer training and called on other colleges to do the same. Kuhn was then an undergraduate, but as the controversy escalated he joined the Crimson’s editorial board and, by July of 1942, had become editorial chairman. Unlike his predecessor at the helm of the paper, Kuhn consistently approved of Conant’s vision for the wartime colleges. Kuhn fully supported Conant in 1942 when the president welcomed the incoming class with a warning that a rigorous education of future military ofﬁcers by “indoctrination” would be a necessity. This was not the kind of “broadening” liberal education that these freshmen expected.36 In the paper the next day, Kuhn agreed that this was no mere “compromise of a peacetime ideal” for liberal education. It was rather a “conversion” for war—“a conversion as com-\n\n26 / Reisch\n\nplete and necessary as that of American industry” that had switched from producing things like refrigerators to bombers. “‘Indoctrination’ is an ugly word,” Kuhn wrote. But “only a plan like President Conant’s can ensure the continued use of university facilities when the guns are ready and the college men are called.”37 At least two elements of the Aristotle experience as Kuhn would later describe it are embedded in this campus controversy: the narrow, purposive cast of the “indoctrinated” mind and the swift “conversion” (Conant used the term “transformation”) between these exclusive modes of education and mental styles. Five summers later, when Kuhn was working with Conant and reading Aristotle, he was shocked as these elements suddenly “sorted themselves out in a new way.” They had moved from the campus’s discussion about military and political discipline into Kuhn’s new understanding of how scientiﬁc cognition and perception actually work. And their valuation began to shift. “Indoctrination” in particular was no longer so “ugly.” For the kind of “specialized education” that created “highly trained manpower”38 for the war effort had a counterpart, Kuhn realized, in the kind of science education that simpliﬁed experience, restricted intellectual creativity, made scientiﬁc revolutions “invisible,” and thus made “normal science” possible. Another word no longer so ugly was “dogma.” Once Structure was ﬁnished and sent off to the University of Chicago Press, Kuhn chose this word to introduce the key ideas behind his new theory of science. It is the centerpiece of his essay “The Function of Dogma in Scientiﬁc Research” in which he took issue with the popular stereotype of the open-minded (and undoubtedly noncommunist) scientist whose beliefs follow empirical facts and are never enslaved by dogmas. For dogmatism, Kuhn explained, played an essential role in the historical success of science. It was “instrumental in making the sciences the most consistently revolutionary of human activities” and (as he put it in Structure) the “drastically restricted vision” of normal science was “essential to the development of science.”39 It made the community sensitive to potential anomalies and helped ensure (as Conant’s phlogistonists illustrated so well) that scientists did not abandon their paradigm capriciously or prematurely. “The Function of Dogma” did not go over very well. Kuhn read the paper just four years after the ﬁrst Sputnik satellite had convinced Congress and the public that American science education had to be revamped to avoid all traces of dogmatism and authoritarianism. Even though he read the paper in England, far from the anticommunist consensus about American education, the American biologist Bentley Glass, then in charge of the\n\nAristotle in the Cold War / 27\n\nSputnik-inspired BSCS reforms in biology textbooks, was present and responded formally to Kuhn’s paper with no small amount of indignation. Then and there, he persuaded Kuhn to stop using the word “dogma” and variants when discussing science.40 As far as Kuhn’s career went, however, this controversial paper may have had a revolutionary and ironic effect. For Kuhn’s provocative defense of dogmatism and intellectual conservatism at this British conference destined him to participate in another British conference, the one organized by Imre Lakatos, who chose Kuhn four years later to appear as a foil to Karl Popper and his militantly antidogmatic philosophy of science. That event and the published proceedings, Lakatos and Musgrave’s Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge, helped to establish Structure’s enormous scholarly prestige and inﬂuence—even though most essays in the volume were quite hostile. Whether or not the assembled scholars suspected the highly politicized matrix from which Kuhn’s central ideas and early terminology were born, this history has remained relatively invisible.\n\nNotes 1.\n\nThomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions, introduction by Ian Hacking, 4th ed.

Kuhn\n\nT WO\n\nA Smoker’s Paradigm M. NORTON WISE\n\nInhaling I want to begin my essay by attempting to capture in a very material and sensual way something of the intensity of Thomas Kuhn’s presence and his intellectual engagement. The image I am after comes from his unique mode of smoking cigarettes—many cigarettes—in his graduate seminars at Princeton. I participated in several of them between 1971 and 1975, when as a young nuclear physicist I had come to study with him and ended up doing a second Ph.D. in history of science. The subjects already say a lot about his focus: electromagnetic theory, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and quantum theory, that is, the foundations of modern theoretical physics. We read only primary sources, many in the original French or German, often quite technical mathematical physics. Now imagine that there are about eight of us sitting around a seminar table with Tom at the head. The subject is Max Planck’s ﬁrst proof in 1900 of his famous law of black-body radiation, which ultimately would lead to recognition (by Einstein and Ehrenfest in 1906 and Lorentz in 1908) of a fundamental discontinuity of energy, the quantum. Tom has discovered that Planck’s proof cannot be assimilated to subsequent canonical proofs and that it involves no discontinuity. Having put a few pertinent equations on the blackboard, he sits down, lights a cigarette, and begins: “Since no such assimilation is possible . . . [Intensely concentrated now, looking down at his notes, he begins a truly extraordinary drag on the cigarette, inhaling longer and deeper than one would have thought possible, before continuing.]\n\n32 / Wise\n\n. . . [later analysts] have dismissed his argument as hand-waving.”1 In this remarkable performance at least half the cigarette is reduced to ash, and we all stare in rapt attention, focused on both the cigarette and the argument. This image of Tom at work is inscribed indelibly on my mind. It is an image, not of smoke exhaled into the broad surrounding world, but of smoke followed down into the smallest passages of the lungs.2 The incredibly long and deep drag on the cigarette, right in the middle of his sentence, I suggest, embodied a characteristic mental movement of drilling down into the minute detail of an argument. He might then, as in my example, come up with its confusing or dissonant character and the way in which it had been misread by Whiggish scientists or historians looking at it from a later perspective. This is of course the lesson he regularly aimed to convey to his students and readers. It was his starting point for the recognition of anomalies and thereby for the origin of a paradigm change (although he rarely mentioned paradigms). I have used the Planck example not only because it is fairly close to a real instance in the seminar but also because Tom regarded the book in which it appeared, his BlackBody Theory and the Quantum Discontinuity, 1894–1912 (1978), as epitomizing what he was after in The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions, as Ian Hacking has also observed in his introduction.3 It was his last attempt to get a ﬁrm historical grip on a paradigm change and to rescue the concept from its undisciplined proliferation of meanings.4\n\nA Narrow Technical Thing With this vignette I have attempted to evoke a sense of how intense was Tom’s focus when actually analyzing conceptual shifts. I want to argue that a paradigm, in its most essential role for him as the locus of the production of new knowledge in science, was a very narrow technical thing, the possession of a small group of people who had access to its precise and esoteric content, accessible to professional practitioners of a subspecialty alone. He believed that it was within these conﬁnes that the shared paradigm of the subspecialty became productive, as he made particularly clear in the 1969 postscript. “Communities of this sort [“of perhaps 100 members”] are the units that this book has presented as the producers and validators of scientiﬁc knowledge. Paradigms are something shared by the members of such groups.” Size was important. It even shrank when he reiterated the point a few pages later, distinguishing the view of some readers that he was concerned primarily with “major revolutions such as those associated with Copernicus, Newton, Darwin, or Einstein,” from “the rather different im-\n\nA Smoker’s Paradigm / 33\n\npression I have tried to make,” of small changes within a small community, “consisting perhaps of fewer than twenty-ﬁve people.”5 The terms I have picked out above—precise, esoteric, professional—are key words for the role of paradigms within such groups in Structure. Consider ﬁrst precise. A paradigm when it ﬁrst appears is likely to be rather vague, heuristically valuable but lacking deﬁnition. It is during the period of normal science that it acquires precision in its articulation, scope, and relevant measurements. And just because of this precision it can reveal the anomalies that lead to crisis, revolution, and paradigm change. “Anomaly appears only against the background provided by the paradigm. The more precise and far-reaching that paradigm is, the more sensitive an indicator it provides of anomaly and hence of an occasion for paradigm change.”6 The research accomplished through the nuanced use of such a paradigm requires intensive training and practice in order to master the associated equipment, skills, vocabulary, and theoretical articulations. It is esoteric. “Acquisition of a paradigm and of the more esoteric type of research it permits is a sign of maturity in the development of any given scientiﬁc ﬁeld.”7 But even in the early days of electrical research, for example, Benjamin Franklin’s single ﬂuid theory of the charging of a Leyden jar provided a paradigm that made the transition to maturity possible, suggesting which experiments might be fruitful and which not. Possession of the Franklinian paradigm “encouraged scientists to undertake more precise, esoteric, and consuming sorts of work.”8 In other words, the precision of esoteric paradigms supports what was for Tom the all-important professional specialization of science. Professional occurs more than ﬁfty times in Structure. It marks the inherently closed character of groups whose communications are largely internal. Unlike Franklin or Darwin, their audience is other specialists. Under these conditions, when individual researchers can take a paradigm for granted, their investigations “will usually appear as brief articles addressed only to professional colleagues, the men whose knowledge of a shared paradigm can be assumed and who prove to be the only ones able to read the papers addressed to them.” These are the narrow specialists of normal science, which leads to Tom’s formulation of the question he posed at the beginning of section III on Normal Science. “What then is the nature of the more professional and esoteric research that a group’s reception of a single paradigm permits?” Answer: the paradigm enables them to determine signiﬁcant facts, match facts with theory, and articulate theory, typically all together, thereby producing “a more precise paradigm.”9\n\n34 / Wise\n\nExemplars My stress on the narrow technical character of paradigms occasions a remark on the exemplars in textbooks that Tom famously associated with acquiring a paradigm, especially in the postscript, discussed further below. Certainly he ascribed great importance to the role these shared problemsolutions and laboratory exercises play for students learning the basic laws and theories in a discipline. They supply empirical content and implicit understanding. But I believe the textbook exemplars have been widely misunderstood to be the immediate referent in normal science for the shifts in perception that he associated with paradigm change and revolution. This is the business of professionals, not students. Although professionals begin to acquire their paradigms through practice in solving the problems set out in textbooks, they necessarily move on to the much more abstruse problem-solutions that are paradigmatic for their specialty. Tom was clear about this progression, which preserves the analogical function of student exemplars while moving them into esoteric territory: That process of learning by ﬁnger exercise or by doing continues throughout the process of professional initiation. As the student proceeds from his freshman course to and through his doctoral dissertation, the problems assigned to him become more complex and less completely precedented. But they continue to be closely modeled on previous achievements, as are the problems that normally occupy him during his subsequent independent scientiﬁc career.10\n\nTextbooks, then, are not the ultimate carriers of the paradigms in which Tom was centrally interested, shared by twenty-ﬁve to a hundred people. Textbooks are not written for such tiny specialties. Indeed, the most telling exemplars in different subspecialties of a ﬁeld are so speciﬁc that they signal different paradigms for understanding the most basic theories in the general ﬁeld: for example, “though quantum mechanics . . . is a paradigm for many scientiﬁc groups, it is not the same paradigm for them all.”11 For an example of this speciﬁcity I return to the black-body book and to Tom’s “fundamental reinterpretation” of Planck’s supposed introduction of the quantum. Planck’s referent for past achievement—the paradigm he employed in 1900—was Ludwig Boltzmann’s statistical theory of gases and his attempt to obtain from it the second law of thermodynamics. Planck needed an exemplary problem-solution far more speciﬁc than\n\nA Smoker’s Paradigm / 35\n\nwhat was covered in textbooks. Only professional mathematical physicists were conversant with Boltzmann’s probabilistic arguments, and even he seldom employed them. Planck was attempting to use Boltzmann’s method for establishing the distribution of energy among gas molecules, adapting it for his own model of a black body: a closed cavity containing radiating resonators in the walls in equilibrium with radiation in the cavity. He treated the resonators as analogous to the gas molecules. The problem was to ﬁnd how the energy was distributed over the resonators/ molecules. Like Boltzmann, Planck actually made the calculation by distributing the resonators over the energy, which he divided into cells of small but ﬁnite size. But while in Boltzmann’s case the size did not matter, and actually disappeared from the result, Planck found that ﬁnite size was required for obtaining the correct distribution. That is the result that physicists and historians regularly and Whiggishly misinterpreted as quantization of the resonator energy, limiting resonator energy to an integral number of ﬁnite elements. Planck himself made no such interpretation until 1908, after Albert Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest, and Hendrick Lorentz had all drawn that consequence.12 What Tom was at pains to make clear was that the difference in interpretation rested on subtly different techniques for counting and different implicit images: distributing ﬁnite elements of energy over resonators versus distributing resonators over ﬁnite cells of energy. The ﬁrst image suggested quantization of resonator energy, while the second led only to a puzzle about the partitioning of phase space. This is precisely one of those duck/rabbit shifts in perception that lay at the heart of Tom’s conception of paradigm change. The whole narrative, from the esoteric Boltzmann paradigm with its technical details of calculation as exemplar, to the inversion of meanings and radically new conception of quantized resonator energy, to the inability to recognize (even resistance to recognizing) that Planck was not thinking in those terms, is just the story of revolutions that Tom placed at the center of conceptual change in science.\n\nInsulation Highlighting the Planck example raises what for me has always been the most enigmatic aspect of Structure. It is the continual reference to community, in the sense that a paradigm is what a community shares. That identiﬁcation would seem to invite social and cultural analysis of the community, in terms of both its own structure and how it interrelates with the larger society in which it participates. But Tom’s presentation actually\n\n36 / Wise\n\nallows neither the narrower nor the broader analysis. I will consider ﬁrst the larger society. Consistent with common usage in the 1960s Tom employed the internal/ external distinction to separate—to insulate, in his word—professional scientists from society. Already in the preface he warned readers what they would not ﬁnd in Structure. I have said nothing about the role of technological advance or of external social, economic, and intellectual conditions in the development of the sciences. . . . Explicit consideration of effects like these would not, I think, modify the main theses developed in this essay, but it would surely add an analytic dimension of ﬁrst-rate importance for the understanding of scientiﬁc advance.”13\n\nA footnote citing a few of his own historical works that have considered such factors points out again that it is “only with respect to the problems discussed in this essay that I take the role of external factors to be minor.” The repeated qualiﬁers apparently reveal a deep ambivalence toward the social. Again further on, while acknowledging that a full account of the Copernican astronomical crisis would include a variety of social and cultural conditions, he nevertheless insisted that such conditions are of secondary signiﬁcance: “technical breakdown would still remain the core of the crisis. In a mature science . . . external factors like those cited above are principally signiﬁcant in determining the timing of breakdown. . . . Though immensely important, issues of that sort are out of bounds for this essay.”14 Apparently this means that it is only the technical content of paradigms and paradigm change that is roped off from external society. Why is that? Or rather, what is the function of this internal/external boundary setting? Tom argued that it was necessary in order for the paradigms of professional science to do the work he assigned to them in the puzzle-solving activity of normal science, namely, to set up puzzles with well-deﬁned solutions, the only problems the community would authorize as scientiﬁc. “A paradigm can . . . insulate the community from those socially important problems that are not reducible to the puzzle form, because they cannot be stated in terms of the conceptual and instrumental tools the paradigm supplies.” The same analysis applies to the progressive character of science, for the concentration of the community on the most subtle and esoteric puzzles governs its effectiveness and efﬁciency. This “very special efﬁciency” depends crucially on “the unparalleled insulation of mature scientiﬁc communities from the demands of the laity and of\n\nA Smoker’s Paradigm / 37\n\neveryday life.”15 Thus, natural scientists are quite unlike engineers, doctors, theologians, lawyers, or, indeed, social scientists, who choose their problems chieﬂy on the basis of an external social need.16 And this basic difference is intensiﬁed by the nearly complete reliance in the education of natural scientists on textbooks, the original source of their skill in using exemplary problem-solutions as analogies, but which exclude social context. In contrast, students in the social sciences maintain contact with the wider world through study of the classical works in their ﬁelds and through current research articles. It is apparent, I think, that any larger sense of the social and the cultural can have no essential role in Tom’s scheme for paradigms. It must be eliminated in order for the community to be properly insulated, thereby maintaining its esoteric, professional character, which is the very source of its effectiveness.\n\nCommunity What now does community stand for and what did Tom understand by introducing what he calls the sociological aspect of paradigms in his postscript? I would say that community actually extends no further than this or that individual who represents it, who either further articulates and reﬁnes its paradigm or challenges it and initiates a paradigm change. Boltzmann, Planck, Lorentz, Ehrenfest, and Einstein are such people for the black-body book, performing the various roles required for the paradigm change from classical-mechanical continuity to quantum-mechanical discontinuity. In analyzing these roles, in digging down into the concrete mathematical work that the classical-mechanical and statistical-mechanical paradigm enabled, Tom’s analysis is an extraordinary accomplishment. I admire it immensely. He could not have done it without the intense focus that he brought to all of his work, as well as his seminars, and that I have suggested he displayed in his equally intense manner of reducing an entire cigarette to ash in a single drag, or maybe it was two drags. Still, what constitutes the community? There are no networks, no exchange relations, no circulation of people or materials, nothing more than the beliefs of individuals, as individuals.17 And most surprisingly for the black-body case, which has been the subject of some criticism, there are no constitutive interactions with the people who did the measurements on black-body radiation at the national materials testing laboratory in Berlin, the Physikalische-Technische Reichsanstalt. Readers will not discover how a bolometer functioned or why it was perfected there or what it may have\n\n38 / Wise\n\nhad to do with Planck’s ideas about resonators and radiation ﬁelds. To have opened up such questions would have brought in precisely the kind of external relations that Tom was at pains to exclude from his analysis of paradigms as the essential referent for esoteric professional work. Text and context do not interrelate like foreground and background but are juxtaposed, like the interior of a black body insulated from its surroundings. This conundrum is only enhanced by the sociological sense of a paradigm that Tom introduced in the postscript. Recall that in order to avoid circularity, he wanted to disentangle the concept of a paradigm from the concept of the scientiﬁc community that shares the paradigm. The community was to be identiﬁed by community structure, including such things as education, membership in scientiﬁc societies, journals read, conferences attended, and informal communication networks, without reference to any paradigm the community might share. But research on community structure was not the sort of thing to which Tom devoted any time and it plays no signiﬁcant role in Structure. It is also not the sense of sociological that he was aiming at. That sense occurs in relation to paradigms themselves, when he distinguished two senses of a shared paradigm that occur throughout Structure. The ﬁrst is the more general sociological sense, also “more global,” while the second is the more limited and technical sense of exemplary problem-solutions, the exemplars discussed above. These he calls the deeper of the two, at least philosophically.18 The sociological sense answers to the question of what the members of a community of specialists share that accounts for “the relative fullness of their professional communication and the relative unanimity of their professional judgment.” For this usage he no longer considered the term “paradigm” appropriate and wished instead to recapture the term “theory” broadly construed (which already suggests a problem for the meaning of “sociological”). To avoid confusion he substituted “disciplinary matrix.”19 The matrix has three components (or four, when exemplars are added): “symbolic generalizations,” often expressed as laws; “metaphysical” commitments, described as beliefs in particular models; and “values” used in judging theories, like simplicity, consistency, and plausibility, whose application is often strongly dependent on individual personality or biography.20 These three components of the matrix, I want to emphasize again, are just the intellectual commitments of individuals, without any reference to group dynamics. There is nothing sociological about them other than that different individuals may agree about them, thereby easing communication; nor of course do they invoke any external relations. The same is true of exemplars, whether considered as a fourth component of the ma-\n\nA Smoker’s Paradigm / 39\n\ntrix or as a distinct and deeper sense of paradigm, now used appropriately. Exemplars are deeper because, as they become ever more precise and esoteric in specialized research, “they provide the community ﬁne-structure of science,”21 and because in this role they do the heavy lifting of normal science, revealing the anomalies that lead to scientiﬁc revolutions. Once again, we see Tom drilling down into the center of his concerns, pushing aside the distraction of even an extremely weak sense of sociological.\n\nHostility I hope now to have shown why Tom’s community paradigms not only do not require anything seriously social but actually exclude it externally and transform it internally into intellectual commitments. Social considerations threatened the core signiﬁcance of a paradigm as productive of new scientiﬁc knowledge. All of this was in place before the sociology of scientiﬁc knowledge (SSK) got off the ground—before, that is, sociologists who advertised that they were following Tom’s lead in Structure put forward claims about the social causes of scientiﬁc belief that were abhorrent to him. I have another vivid memory of walking innocently by his open ofﬁce door sometime about 1972 when I heard, “Norton, come in here. Did you see this? Just look at what they’re saying,” as he stabbed at an article on his desk by a sociologist. Some twenty years later, in his Rothschild Lecture, “The Trouble with the Historical Philosophy of Science,” he damned the Edinburgh “strong program” as “absurd: an example of deconstruction gone mad.” And he thought the more qualiﬁed formulations of others “scarcely more satisfactory.”22 No doubt this public hostility represented his pressing concern that SSK opened up his project (to transform the way we understand science) to renewed charges of relativism, which he had been battling since the publication of Structure. But more profoundly in my view, he had been working for years to eliminate social considerations from having any purchase on the exquisitely technical function of paradigms. SSK threatened the heart of his enterprise. There is a great deal more one could say abo"
