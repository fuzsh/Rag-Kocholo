        "text": "Abandon Aristotle.\n\nPhilosopher Bertrand Russell has stated emphatically (and, empirically, and also, empathetically):\n\n`Almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine’.\n\n(Russell 1996: 157 – emphasis mine)\n\nAnd – sure; Aristotle was great and all…\n\nLike, he did a lot of really good things. Like: inventing-pizza delivery, with Plato (See: Figure 1)\n\n“But I’m Plato, I deserve ONE whole pizza to myself, Aristotle.”\n\nAristotle: “Whoa – no way! One slice each, dude.”\n\nBut – for film screenwriters – Aristotle – the famous inventor of among other things, pizza delivery (seriously, see: Raphael’s: The School of Athens) – has caused many problems than he has solved in the Domain of Film/Screenwriting.\n\n“Philosophy is… the gadfly image, the Socratic gadfly: refusing to accept any platitudes or accepted wisdom without examining it.” – Donna Dickenson\n\nSo – in 2012, the time has now come to: ABANDON Aristotle.\n\nNote that: all the other Domains (physics, chemistry, biology, philosophy) blew off Aristotle about 500 years ago.\n\nWhat are we Screenwriters doing – still listening to the guy?\n\nAn example of how out of date Aristotle’s ideas are now:\n\nIn the 1500’s, Galileo replaced Aristotle’s view of pendulums. Aristotle reckoned everything in the universe was being sucked to the centre of the Universe, i.e. Which Aristotle said: was the Earth (Kuhn and Hacking 2012: 123)\n\n(I never said it was a good story, just: a good example of theoretical out-dated-ness.)\n\nAnd – with Galileo – this was back in the 1500’s, that Aristotelian theory was abandoned in physics, for example.\n\nFIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO PHYSICS TOTALLY `BONED’ ARISTOTLE’S IDEAS…\n\nIn 2012, Why has `the screenwriting convention’ not yet abandoned Aristotelian theory?\n\nAnd yet – 7 in 10 films lose money. (Something is not working right, there.)\n\nThe `Theory-Nature fit’ is a mismatch…? (Am I the only one who has noticed this?)\n\nActually, John Truby has also noticed it. See this post about that.\n\nAristotle also famously said that, everything was made of Earth, Wind and Fire. (like the 1970’s pop group). Now we know about atoms, forces (strong nuclear, weak nuclear, electromagnetic and gravity) and quantum mechanics.\n\nAnd even-more-likewise, in a great little book called What Is This Thing called Science? (Chalmers 2000):\n\nWhat is this thing on the cover?\n\n(A: It’s a badly-drawn cat. But – the book itself is amazing.)\n\nAnyway in this excellent book – Chalmers points out:\n\n`(An influential claim is that), as a matter of historical fact, modern science was born in the early seventeenth century, when the strategy of taking the facts of observation seriously as the basis for science was first seriously adopted. It is held by those who embrace and exploit this story about the birth of science that prior to the seventeenth century the observable facts were not taken seriously as the foundation for knowledge.\n\nRather, so the familiar story goes, knowledge was based largely on authority, especially the authority of the philosopher Aristotle and the authority of the Bible.\n\nIt was only when this authority was challenged by an appeal to experience, by pioneers of the new science such as Galileo, that modern science became possible.’\n\n(Chalmers 2000: 2)\n\nAll I’m saying is:\n\nWe have got to abandon Aristotelean doctrine on feature film screenplays.\n\nABANDON IT-!\n\nSeriously!\n\n(I mean, sure, in context – two-and-a-half THOUSAND YEARS AGO – relatively – he was a genius…)\n\nBut now – 2012 – we have got to stop using Aristotle’s ideas about old Greek plays as a basis for movies/screenwriting.\n\nMovies only started in 1906.\n\n2300 years after Aristotle died.\n\nMovies – and old old old (tragic) Greek plays – have almost nothing to do with each other.\n\nI contend: the continued use of Aristotle’s theory of drama has now placed the Domain of Film Screenwriting in a confused mess.\n\nThese Aristotle `followers’ have gots to go.\n\nWriting a movie using Aristotelian `logic’ will likely get your movie to flop.\n\nSeriously. 7 in 10 movies lose money.\n\n…USING ARISTOTLE’S `DRAMATIC PRINCIPLES’…\n\nAlso – please note: after a `paradigm change’ – ALL THE TEXTBOOKS HAVE TO BE REWRITTEN. (See: Syd Field’s `Screenplay’, Robert McKee’s `Story’, and any others that use Aristotle and `Poetics’ as a theoretical basis.)\n\nThese *old* ideas about Drama have got to go.\n\nFortunately, science progresses; knowledge evolves – there is now a far better way than using Aristotle’s ideas about ancient Greek plays.\n\ni.e. – Using a scientific and empirical method, examining and comparing the top 20 and bottom 20 most successful (most viral) films:\n\n…Thoughts, feedback, comments?\n\n——————————————–\n\nJT Velikovsky\n\nHigh-RoI Story/Screenplay/Movie and Transmedia Researcher\n\nThe above is (mostly) an adapted excerpt, from my doctoral thesis: “Communication, Creativity and Consilience in Cinema”.
