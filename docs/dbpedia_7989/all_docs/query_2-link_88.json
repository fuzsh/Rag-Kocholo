        "text": "Post with 2 notes\n\nOtt on Heidegger\n\nI’ve been reading Hugo Ott’s Martin Heidegger: A Political Life, which is a fascinating work of biography that draws on unpublished letters and diaries and so gives a great deal of detail not previously made public. More importantly, Ott is not a head-in-the-sand Heidegger worshiper, and he was already working on Heidegger’s Nazi past when Viktor Farias pubished his landmark study Heidegger and Nazism. Ott focuses on Heidegger’s early life, and sees in it signs of Heidegger’s later Nazism.\n\nIn my post Conduct Unbecoming a Philosopher I recently wrote about Heidegger’s Nazism and the need to accept the fact that Heidegger was a Nazi and that his philosophical thought is integral with Heidegger’s vision of Nazism (which was, admittedly, not everyone’s vision of Nazism). Denial and evasion are more damning than admission.\n\nI came across a passage in Ott’s book that particularly interested me, about the relationship between Husserl’s thought (Edmund Husserl was the founder of phenomenology and one of Heidegger’s mentors) and Heidegger’s thought. Here is the entire paragraph:\n\nHusserl was unquestionably the dominant philosophical figure to whom both friends turned with conviction. The Christian philosopher Josef Geyser was clearly out of the picture and of no further account. On the subject of Geyser’s inaugural address, as Ochsner writes in his letter of 6 December 1917, ‘the less said the better’. From the very clear accounts that Ochsner later gave from memory to his friend Bernhard Welte it becomes apparent to what extent Heidegger was able to develop Husserl’s phenomenological approach through fruitful dialogue with the older philosopher. Heidegger had understood right from the beginning that 'Husserl’s approach, for all its significance, could not be a prima philosophia, because Husserl’s “object” was the abstract object of theoretical scientific knowledge, and as such was a very derivative concept’, whereas the materialized object that is constituted in the concrete forms of existence 'is something far earlier and more primordial’. Husserl, we are told, had ignored the problem of access to his phenomena, since for him the scientific existence of objects had been an unquestioned fact taken wholly for granted. Consequently, Heidegger had gone further than Husserl from the very beginning, radicalizing the latter’s approach: for the question of the historical certainty of the existence of objects, and their accessibility, had assumed central importance for him. (p. 103)\n\nIn the above passage I would like to bring your attention to this sentence in particular:\n\nHusserl, we are told, had ignored the problem of access to his phenomena, since for him the scientific existence of objects had been an unquestioned fact taken wholly for granted.\n\nFar from characterizing Husserl’s philosophy, this is exactly what Husserl argued against, i.e., that objects were an unquestioned fact taken for granted. Husserl’s entire philosophical project was a critique of this idea, not a confirmation of this idea, so we cannot say that this interpretation of Husserl is just a little off; it is, rather, completely wrong.\n\nHusserl finds the existence of objects to be so problematic that he proposes that phenomenology “bracket” the whole of the naturally existing world and proceed to an analysis of phenomena as they present themselves to consciousness, apart from any consideration as to whether the phenomena are purportedly existing or non-existent. The opposite point of view, that of treating the objects of scientific knowledge as “an unquestioned fact taken wholly for granted” is what Husserl called the natural standpoint (or the natural attitude, depending on how you translate natürlichen Einstellung). Husserl devoted a considerable portion of his book Ideas I to an exposition of the natural standpoint (cf. Part Two, Chapter One, sections 27-32). The whole point of phenomenology is to suspend the natural standpoint, not to accept it without question, which latter is the view that Ott presents from the Heideggerian perspective.\n\nIt is not clear to me from the context whether the quoted passage represents Ott’s own interpretation of Husserl and his relation to Heidegger, or if Ott is presenting this from a Heideggerian perspective. I would suspect that former, except for Ott’s qualifying phrase, “we are told,” which here speaks volumes. (The only footnote to this passage references the diary of Bernhard Welte, and sheds no specific light on the interpretation of this passage.)\n\nLater in Ott’s book, Ott quotes a letter from Husserl (of 04 May 1933) that makes exactly this point:\n\nBefore this he broke off all relations with me (and very soon after his appointment) and in recent years has allowed his anti-Semitism to come increasingly to the fore, even in his dealings with his group of devoted Jewish students and his Faculty colleagues. That was hard to swallow. What was also hard to take was the way Heidegger and the other proponents of 'Existenz’ philosophy – largely derived from caricatured versions of the ideas contained in my writings, lectures and personal teachings – twisted the radical scientific purport of my life’s work into its very opposite, damning that work by praising it fulsomely as something that had been entirely superseded, something that it was quite unnecessary to study any more … But the events of the last few weeks and months have struck at the deepest roots of my existence. (p. 185)\n\nThe inclusion of Husserl’s own interpretation of the Heideggerian interpretation of his thought suggests that Ott is fully aware that Husserl is not taking the existence of the objects of science as an unquestioned fact.\n\nHusserl has hit the nail on the head in writing that Heidegger and others had twisted the radical scientific purport of my life’s work into its very opposite, and this observation not only proved to be true in 1933, but apparently remains true today, eighty years later, in 2013.\n\nThis letter of Husserl reminds me of something that Bertrand Russell wrote about the followers of Wittgenstein:\n\nIt is not an altogether pleasant experience to find oneself regarded as antiquated after having been, for a time, in the fashion. It is difficult to accept this experience gracefully. When Leibniz, in old age, heard the praises of Berkeley, he remarked: ‘The young man in Ireland who disputes the reality of bodies seems neither to explain himself sufficiently nor to produce adequate arguments. I suspect him of wishing to be known for his paradoxes.’ I could not say quite the same of Wittgenstein, by whom I was superseded in the opinion of many British philosophers. It was not by paradoxes that he wished to be known, but by a suave evasion of paradoxes. He was a very singular man, and I doubt whether his disciples knew what manner of man he was. (Russell, My Philosophical Development, Ch. XVIII)\n\nThere is a strange parallelism in the history of analytical and continental thought in which Wittgenstein stands in relation to Russell as Heidegger stands in relation to Husserl, and Husserl might have said with as much justification as Russell that he had been superseded by Heidegger in the opinion of many German philosophers, and that he found himself regarded as being antiquated.\n\nAnd so it continues. Husserl is regarded as antiquated while Heidegger is read as a contemporary. Despite Heidegger having compromised himself in almost every way imaginable – allying himself with the Nazis, making excuses after the war, and apparently never having understood the significance of his actions – Heidegger continues to be a name to conjure with in contemporary philosophy, and many if not most who study Heidegger today do so without reference to the ideological context of his thought.\n\nI have written previously (in An Interview in Starbucks) about how much I have admired Husserl’s attitude to being sidelined by Heidegger’s Nazification of Freiburg University, which was part of the overall Nazi campaign to Nazify the German university system and the professions.\n\nHusserl’s was a mind immersed in philosophy; Heidegger’s was a mind overlain by ideology; it is important to recognize the different between the two, even if both are expressed philosophically (or even if, as it more likely to be the case, neither is expressed philosophically).\n\nApparently it is easy to misconstrue Husserl, and his writing style is honestly quite difficult at times. I remember a conversation that I had with a friend some years ago, in which he claimed that he rejected phenomenology because of its purported “subjectivity.” This is another common charge made against Husserl, and it is ironically the polar opposite of charging Husserl with a naive scientific realism.\n\nIn that conversation of many years ago I prevailed upon my former friend and spent some time explaining how the whole point of transcendental subjectivity was to grasp objectivity – that we must go through the subjective to arrive at the objective – and eventually I got him to read Husserl a little more sympathetically, but he remained a dyed-in-the-wool Heideggerian. Did I fail? Perhaps so. In any case, I will continue to hammer away at a correct interpretation of Husserl."
