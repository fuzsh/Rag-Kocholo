        "text": "Written by Sonya Ng\n\nBoth Lakatos’ and Kuhn’s conceptions of what makes a good scientific theory appear to conflict, because the former has the opinion that the latter is presuming that science is irrational. Yet this is not the case. In this essay, I shall compare both their theories and make a case for Kuhn by highlighting the similarities between what Lakatos proposes in response to Kuhn’s criterion – mainly between Lakatos’ Demarcation Criterion and Kuhn’s above-mentioned characteristics – and make the argument that Lakatos’ proposed system, structure and criteria for “Research Programmes” do not really overcome the very problems he brought up when criticizing Kuhn’s argument, and might in fact, stand to be comparatively more problematic. Hence, Kuhn’s conception of a good scientific theory is better.\n\nLakatos\n\nFor Lakatos, scientific theories are thought of as “Research Programmes”, in which there exist rules for acceptance (Demarcation Criterion) and rules for sophisticated falsification (Elimination). The former falls under the characteristics that make up the positive heuristics of a “Research Programme”, and the latter the negative heuristics of a “Research Programme”. Under the negative heuristics of Lakatos’ “research programme”, there exists a “Hard Core” that scientists strive to protect at all costs. When dealing with refutations and potential counterarguments in their research programme, scientists avoid letting them attack and weaken the hard core, but instead formulate auxiliary hypotheses that serve as a “Protective Belt” that is constantly adjusted to protect the hard core (Lakatos 133). Under the Demarcation Criterion, a research programme is good if it has corroborated excess empirical content – that is, if this new research programme has borne a discovery of novel facts – more so than its rival theories and predecessor, therefore being progressive. At least some of these novel facts must be empirically verified (Lakatos 116).\n\nWhether a theory is ultimately accepted or rejected is independent of the result of a test (Lakatos 119). Following the previously mentioned rule, a theory T is falsified only if another theory T’ possesses the following characteristics:\n\nT’ predicts novel facts that are improbable, or even forbidden by T\n\nT’ explains the success previously enjoyed by T\n\nSome of the excess content in (1) has been corroborated. (qtd. Lakatos 116)\n\nUnder such circumstances, a theory ought to be eliminated to guard against the “growing chaos” of science, with its continuous propagation of new theories. On a similar note, research programmes which fail to predict and explain new facts are considered “degenerative” and ought to be abandoned.\n\nKuhn\n\nAccording to Kuhn, what makes a good scientific theory is based on the following five characteristics: accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity and fruitfulness.\n\nAccurate – the deduced consequences are consistent with the results of present observations and experiments\n\nConsistent – the theory itself is both internally consistent and consistent with other presently accepted theories that are related to it\n\nScope – it must be broad and provide far-reaching implications that extend beyond the laws and sub-theories that explain it\n\nSimple – a scientific theory should bring order to phenomena\n\nFruitfulness – it should present new phenomena and prior un-noted research findings (Kuhn 321).\n\nAll the above criteria must be used to assess said theory; they cannot be individuated and given an unfair amount of emphasis. Yet Kuhn says that this set of criteria is not of much use (Kuhn 324). This is because consciously or unconsciously, when assessing how good a scientific theory is and whether it should be chosen over its rival theories, we use a mixture of objective and subjective factors, with shared and individual criteria (Kuhn 325). Our personal characteristics and experiences play a necessary role in terms of contributing to these subjective factors, in the form of maxims, norms and values.\n\nYour choices are made according to a set of maxims that you hold, both in terms of the outcome of your decision and how you have arrived at it. These maxims are specific to you as an individual. The norms in your society, and your values play a role in influencing your choice and, in a sense, formulating your criteria of choice and assessment. Hence a good scientific theory according to Kuhn is one that possesses these above five characteristics, subject to certain rational but non-scientific factors that come into play in its assessment.\n\nComparisons and Criticisms\n\nAfter having expounded on both Lakatos’ and Kuhn’s criteria for what makes a good scientific theory, I shall now draw similarities between both their criteria. Lakatos’ Demarcation Criterion regards a scientific theory as good if it is progressive, and has led to a discovery of novel facts, some of which has to have been verified. This seems to fall under the umbrella of Kuhn’s above-mentioned five characteristics – specifically “Fruitfulness” and “Scope”, in which Kuhn argues that a good scientific theory should present new phenomena and research findings and have wide implications. Naturally, this would result in the prediction of facts that are new and improbable. In a similar vein, Lakatos’ negative heuristics, in which he sets a criterion for theories that ought to be eliminated, and his justification for this seems to fall under Kuhn’s characteristic of “Simplicity”, in that he wishes to eliminate growing chaos – a good scientific theory ought to bring order to the phenomena being observed. Hence in these aspects, there is nothing particularly different or new about the points that Lakatos makes following Kuhn. The only crucial aspect in which they appear to differ is that while Kuhn believes that good scientific theories should be accurate when subject to present observations and experiments, Lakatos does not, and that Kuhn thinks that good scientific theories ought to be consistent with related theories, while Lakatos does not. However, does Lakatos make the mistake of isolating and emphasizing certain criteria more than others?\n\nIt is strange that a scientific theory is considered good, despite being faced with refutations, merely because it would predict novel facts if it were true. Lakatos seems to advocate this to make a kind of safety net, to ensure that any theory that appears to hold promise should be investigated, should it wind up being true. The problem with this is that it is then considered perfectly rational for a scientist to remain in a “degenerating research programme” indefinitely merely because it could hold some future promise of being progressive. Whether it truly does, or does not, will be epistemically impossible to determine. The process of choosing research programmes and assessing them will then look like this:\n\nA scientist ought to choose a research programme that is progressive.\n\nA research programme is either progressive or degenerative.\n\nIf research programme X is progressive, it is good. The scientist should choose to be in it.\n\nIf research programme X is degenerative, it could hold some promise of being progressive in the future, hence the scientist should choose to be in X, because it could be a good theory and lead to a discovery of novel facts.\n\nHow then does one rationally determine if a research programme is “progressive” and therefore “good”? Lakatos’ positive heuristics, insofar as ignoring refutations, and determining the goodness of a theory based on whether it could lead to a discovery of novel facts, then seems to become unavoidably irrational – or, if not irrational, subject to the subjective elements that Kuhn brings into his discussion, namely one’s norms, values and maxims which are subjective and not strictly scientific, but nevertheless rational in nature – which is what Kuhn posits. There is an epistemic barrier that cannot be broken using rationality, and this is further seen when one considers another of the conditions of his Demarcation Criterion – that at least some of these novel facts must be empirically verified. Lakatos himself admits that that might require an “indefinite amount of time” (Lakatos 116). In that case, it begs the question of how many of these predictions do we have to verify to consider a theory progressive? If an “indefinite amount of time” could be taken to verify these novel facts, then it seems to be that none of these facts can be disproved.\n\nThere is also another problem – how exactly does one isolate the “hard core” from its “protective belt”? When one assumes a set of auxiliary hypotheses to form the latter, they are necessarily derived from the “hard core” itself. Hence when an auxiliary hypothesis is proven false, can the hard core be completely protected from refutation? In comparison, Kuhn accepts that should problems arise and accumulate within a pre-existing paradigm, a revolution occurs and a new paradigm is created or adopted to deal with these problems. The notion of a “hard core” that must be protected at all costs is therefore in itself problematic and, arguably, irrational.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the course of this essay, I have compared both Lakatos’ and Kuhn’s criteria for a good scientific theory, and where they differ and overlap. In isolating and placing sole emphasis on progressiveness and potential progressiveness, Lakatos is subjected to a host of problems, which ultimately boil down to making a rational decision when confronted with unavoidable and inevitable epistemic barriers. While Lakatos’ criterion is one that stands to have pragmatic merit in terms of fuelling scientific progress, it is nevertheless problematic. In contrast, Kuhn has made the case that deciding between paradigms isn’t a matter of irrationality, but rather a rational decision-process which stands to be influenced by subjective elements that tend to be unique to an individual. Inevitably, not every aspect of decision-making will be purely scientific in nature, and they do not have to be. Kuhn therefore has a more compelling account of what makes a good scientific theory.\n\nReferences:\n\nLakatos, I., & Musgrave, A. (2004).
