        "text": "This is part five of a five-part series.\n\n5.\n\nTHIS CONTEST OF INTERPRETATION\n\nSteven Weinberg has written eloquently in The New York Review of Books about Kuhn and paradigm shifts. A Nobel Prize-winning physicist was outlining the difference between “Kuhnian science” (that is, science as Kuhn imagined it) and actual science. And argued that Kuhn’s theories did not characterize science as Weinberg knew it. Weinberg wrote, “What does bother me on rereading Structure and some of Kuhn’s later writings is his radically skeptical conclusions about what is accomplished in the work of science…conclusions that have made Kuhn a hero to the philosophers, historians, sociologists, and cultural critics who question the objective character of scientific knowledge, and who prefer to describe scientific theories as social constructions, not so different from democracy or baseball.”\n\nOr not so different from parapsychology, astrology or witchcraft.\n\nHe was also bothered by Kuhn’s arguments against progress. “[Kuhn] went on to reason that… there can be no sense in which theories developed after a scientific revolution can be said to add cumulatively to what was known before the revolution… More recently, in his Rothschild Lecture at Harvard in 1992, Kuhn remarked that it is hard to imagine what can be meant by the phrase that a scientific theory takes us ‘close to the truth.’”\n\nAnd yet, Weinberg fails to drive the stake through the heart of the vampire. If paradigms are incommensurable how can we talk about their incommensurability? If the Pythagoreans did not understand (or could not have understood) Hippasus’s proof because it was “incommensurable” with the Pythagorean paradigm, then why bother killing him?\n\nWeinberg was taken (as was I) with an example that appears in Kuhn’s “What Are Scientific Revolutions?” It involves Aristotle and a Gestalt-flip. It also has a breathless, “gee whiz” character. Not unlike accounts of alien abductions and the experiences that follow. You won’t be able to understand it. Just take my word for it.\n\nI first read some of Aristotle’s physical writings in the summer of 1947, at which time I was a graduate student of physics trying to prepare a case study on the development of mechanics for a course in science for nonscientists… I was sitting at my desk with the text of Aristotle’s Physics open in front of me and with a four-colored pencil in my hand. Looking up, I gazed abstractedly out the window of my room—the visual image is one I still retain. Suddenly the fragments in my head sorted themselves out in a new way, and fell into place together. My jaw dropped, for all at once Aristotle seemed a very good physicist indeed, but of a sort I’d never dreamed possible. Now I could understand why he had said what he’d said, and what his authority had been. Statements that had previously seemed egregious mistakes now seemed at worst near misses within a powerful and generally successful tradition. That sort of experience—the pieces suddenly sorting themselves out and coming together in a new way—is the first general characteristic of revolutionary change… [82]\n\nAlas, there is nothing here to tell us about the nature of the epiphany. Could it be like a religious conversion? Weinberg wrote to Kuhn for an explanation – excuse me, sir, just what is going on here – but got none. I guess a true epiphany cannot be explained. It is ineffable. It just happens. And yet, I had (and still have) this nagging feeling that it is possible to compare Aristotle’s science with current modes of explanation. Even to make the claim that there has been progress during the last 2,000 or so years – say in the field of dentistry. To cite Bertrand Russell, “Aristotle maintained that women have fewer teeth than men; although he was twice married, it never occurred to him to verify this statement by examining his wives’ mouths.” Or the variant from Russell I prefer, “Aristotle could have avoided the mistake of thinking that women have fewer teeth than men, by the simple device of asking Mrs. Aristotle to keep her mouth open while he counted.” [83]\n\n*******\n\nNorton Wise was a post-doctoral student at Princeton and eventually the director of graduate studies of the Program in the History and Philosophy of Science (from 1991 to 2000), the same program that Kuhn had directed in the ‘70s. I had spent many, many evenings talking with him and, yes, complaining about Kuhn. I hadn’t talked to him in 40 years, but at least for me, it was as if no time had passed. Except that he had young, twin daughters at the time. They are now in their forties.\n\nNorton is much nicer than me. In our conversation, I was reminded of his openness and sincerity.\n\nNORTON WISE: Do you remember the mode of smoking a cigarette, where Kuhn would start drawing on a newly lit cigarette? He would start a sentence, break off in the middle of the sentence, start drawing on the cigarette, and take a drag that would exhaust half the cigarette. Just an amazing drag. And then start again in the sentence. That’s such a clear image to me.\n\nERROL MORRIS: I remember the mountain of butts and ash.\n\nNORTON WISE: Within one seminar.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Oh yes.\n\nNORTON WISE: That’s what I remember too. I never saw anyone smoke like that before or since. Of course the emphysema nearly killed him.\n\nERROL MORRIS: I often think of the attraction of smoking, that it simplifies the world into three parts. There’s you, there’s the cigarette, and everything else is the ashtray.\n\nNORTON WISE: Well, the smoking is to me expressive of the intensity of the seminars. Everyone was on edge. And that was from early on, and then continuing through successive seminars. The most apparent thing is that intensity that Kuhn somehow brought, along with the thorough preparation that he brought to it, and then expected of everyone else. And of course very few people — no one in the seminar would have read and analyzed the material in the very focused, intense way that he had done. A kind of adversarial relationship was explicit. You were challenged to be saying anything, or offering an opinion. And an opinion immediately evoked maybe agreement, but usually not. Usually some kind of challenge. And for me that meant that the relationship, while close and intense over the years, was always adversarial. I found it extremely stimulating but sometimes disturbing. Sometimes very disturbing. Right up until the end, shortly before he died, he and I were carrying on this kind of contest of interpretation.\n\nERROL MORRIS: What an odd expression.\n\nNORTON WISE: I wonder if it was in that seminar that I first became aware of it. I was giving an interpretation of William Thomson’s [Lord Kelvin’s] early electromagnetic mathematical work. He sharply disagreed with my interpretation and said that it couldn’t possibly be right because it didn’t follow the steps through which Thomson had developed his argument. It was, instead, a physicist’s way of going at things as an overview, or as a re-interpretation based on later knowledge. It was the kind of thing he was constantly hammering against. Then the next week I came back with a new interpretation. And again he attempted to shoot that down. But this time I had done a great deal more homework and really had it down in a pretty focused, pretty detailed way. And that maybe was the basis of the respect we gained for each other. All of his students needed to show him that they could stand up to that adversarial mode of interaction, and challenge his own understanding — which he greatly enjoyed. For some people that worked out pretty well; for others it was a complete disaster.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Your use of the word “adversarial?” I experienced it differently. I would say that it went beyond adversarial. There was a threatening element.\n\nNORTON WISE: Yes.\n\nERROL MORRIS: When I first came to Princeton, he had given me an ultimatum that I was not to attend Kripke’s lectures.\n\nNORTON WISE: I’d never heard that. Very strange.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes. “You may not go to those lectures.”\n\nNORTON WISE: So, of course, you immediately did.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes.\n\nOur discussion turned to Butterfield and Whiggishness.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Although you didn’t use the word, I know it was on the tip of your tongue because you studied with him. It was the supreme accusation — Whiggishness. “This is Whiggish history.” I see the argument — and I would love to know the details of the argument about Thomson. That you were Norton Wise, a recent Ph.D. in physics, thinking like a physicist and not like a historian. And that you were providing some kind of anachronistic account.\n\nNORTON WISE: That’s precisely correct.\n\nERROL MORRIS: There seemed to be a kind of weirdness at the heart of all of it. I don’t know how else to express it. The accusation of Whiggishness was a cudgel.\n\nNORTON WISE: Yes, it certainly was used in that way — to change one’s rhetorical sensibilities.\n\nERROL MORRS: As a cudgel? As a club?\n\nNORTON WISE: Yes. I saw that I had to learn to work in a different mode. I had to learn to write sentences differently. I had to learn to interpret the way in which a text flowed from one line to the next in the course of a page.\n\nERROL MORRIS: But aren’t you just talking about close reading?\n\nNORTON WISE: Yes. [84]\n\nClose reading? Who would argue with that? Close reading is entirely commendable. Three cheers for close reading. But close reading is the opposite of incommensurability. It tells us that by carefully studying a passage we can understand it. Incommensurability tells us that unless we inhabit the paradigm in which it was written, we can never understand it.\n\n*******\n\nWhich brings me back to Kripke. And to “Naming and Necessity.” Why is Kripke relevant to any of this? I believe it is because his work is an attempt to create new links — between words and things and between the present and the past. Although he is rarely described in this way, he is among other things, a philosopher of history. We can believe strange things about the past, but we can still refer to things in the past. [85] There is an objective reality. There is objective truth. And there is objective history. [86] The beliefs of 6th century B.C.E. mathematicians might be inaccessible to us (or at least, difficult for us to understand), but when Hippasus or one of his contemporaries refer to √2, they are referring to the same thing we are. [87] Indeed, it may come back to close reading.\n\n…truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, depository of deeds, witness of the past, exemplar and adviser to the present, and the future’s counselor.\n\nGo back to Goldie. We can believe that Goldie is golden or green or some other color, but we still refer to Goldie. As time goes by, our ideas about Goldie (and history) may change, but that doesn’t mean that we no longer refer to Goldie or that Goldie refers to one fish in one paradigm and a different fish in another. Nor does it mean that reference is contingent on a paradigm – or on a conceptual scheme or disciplinary matrix. I imagine one of those very bad elementary school arguments. Some kid says that the earth is flat. I say that the earth is an oblate spheroid. We argue. It’s flat. No, it isn’t. Yes, it is. No, it isn’t. Yes, it is. No, it isn’t. Stalemate. We have reached an impasse. Kuhn steps in to adjudicate. He tells us that there is no fact of the matter. You come from different paradigms: the flat earth paradigm and the oblate spheroid paradigm. The name “earth” means something different to each of you, and you can’t compare the meanings. There is no common reference. [As Kuhn wrote in “Structure,” “…proponents of competing paradigms practice their trades in different worlds.”] But wait. What about the earth? There is the earth. There is that physical thing floating out in space. Is it flat, or is it an oblate spheroid? Or if it’s neither, tell me what it is. A tetrahedron? Isn’t it one thing or another? It must be something. [88]\n\nI suppose the kid in elementary school, if he gets angry enough, could strangle me. When all else fails, there’s Humpty Dumpty’s reply to Alice. And there’s the Ashtray Argument. With Kuhn’s blinkered cosmologies there really is no way to resolve these questions. Fisticuffs may be required.\n\nPlease remember: This is not an empty intellectual exercise. It is not a matter of indifference whether it was God or natural selection that produced the complexity of life on earth. Nor whether there is such a thing as global warming. The devaluation of scientific truth cannot be laid on Kuhn’s doorstep, but he shares some responsibility for it.\n\nOne more parable. For those who truly believe that truth is subjective or relative (along with everything else), ask yourself the question – is ultimate guilt or innocence of a crime a matter of opinion? Is it relative? Is it subjective? A jury might decide you’re guilty of a crime that you haven’t committed. You’re innocent. (It’s possible. The legal system is rife with miscarriages of justice.) Nevertheless, we believe there is a fact of the matter. You either did it or you didn’t. Period.\n\nIf you were strapped into an electric chair, there would be nothing relative about it. Suppose you are innocent. Would you be satisfied with the claim there is no definitive answer to the question of whether you’re guilty or innocent? That there is no such thing as absolute truth or falsity? Or would you be screaming, “I didn’t do it. Look at the evidence. I didn’t do it.” Nor would you take much comfort in the claim, “It all depends on your point of view, doesn’t it?” Or “what paradigm are you in?” When I was investigating the murder of Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer, and the capital murder conviction of Randall Dale Adams for that murder, would it make sense to describe my viewpoint as one paradigm, and the viewpoint of the Dallas police as another? Surely, we had different ways of looking at the evidence, different interpretations of the evidence, different ways of looking at the crime. Suppose someone said, there’s no way of comparing these two paradigms. They’re incommensurable. You can’t say one is true and the other false. There is no absolute truth. Perhaps they could gussy up the claim by citing police procedures and practices. Different traditions of looking at crime scene evidence. The social construction of the ashtray. [89]\n\nThe difficulty of ascertaining the truth in history is often confused with the relativity of truth. Two very different concepts. (We may have difficulty fixing the exact date and location of the Battle of Hastings, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen at a specific time and place.) “The past,” as L.P. Hartley has written, “is a foreign country. They do things differently there.” [90] But when Homer speaks of the “sun,” is he speaking about a different object than T.S. Eliot? If Newton were to give Einstein a copy of the “Principia” and Einstein were to give Newton a copy of “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” would they be unable to understand each other or their respective theories? There would be a discussion, perhaps even disagreements about ideas and principles. Clarifications would be needed. But would they look past each other in numb stupefaction? The past may be a foreign country, but I do not believe that people there speak a language that we can not understand.\n\n*******\n\nAcknowledgments: Charles Silver provided many of the ideas in this essay.

I want to thank everybody connected with this lecture series for inviting me tonight. I haven’t been back to Princeton for close to 40 years. I tried to write some kind of lecture. I don’t think I really have it in me. I can write essays and articles. I don’t think I can write lectures. Not this one. But I started to write a lecture entitled “The Ashtray,” because the ashtray is very much on my mind. It concerned an ashtray that was thrown at my head at the Institute for Advanced Study. It may not have been the only reason why I left Princeton, but it was the beginning of the end. I started digging through stuff related to my experiences here. I was very much devoted to rock climbing. You may not be aware of this fact, but this is one of the best places to rock climb in the world. The buildings are perfect for climbing. And I was probably in the best shape that I had ever been.\n\nI was arrested at a demonstration at the Institute for Defense Analysis [IDA]. This is in 1972. And I was taken in a paddy wagon to Trenton. [We were protesting the resumption of bombing in North Vietnam. This time, very close to the Chinese border.]\n\nI was waiting to be booked, walked over to a window, and realized it was just a very easy matter to climb out the window, climb down the side of the building, and leave, which I did. And I always felt a little bit ashamed of myself, because I thought, “I should’ve gotten arrested and booked and fingerprinted, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. There’s probably no record of the fact that I was arrested in this demonstration.” [It’s always been unclear to me, in social protest, is the important thing to be there, to be arrested, to be beaten, to be in the newspaper, to be booked, or to be incarcerated? Maybe all of the above.]\n\nThis last week I found an old issue of The Princetonian online, and my name was there, in the paper, and it felt kind of good. I was kind of pleased with myself, reading about the demonstration, reading about how a former president of Princeton had said about the demonstration, “This isn’t Princeton.” Later, he claimed that he wasn’t talking about the demonstrations, merely the fact that the IDA was not formally located on the Princeton campus. I guess meanings are always in flux.\n\nA lot of these experiences informed what I became as a filmmaker. The things that I was concerned with in those days still are very much with me, still are very much part of what I do as a filmmaker.\n\nThe issue of murder, mass murder, has stayed with me over the years. It’s certainly part of the film that I made with Robert S. McNamara, “The Fog of War.” I remember sitting in the Firestone Library and reading volumes upon volumes of the transcripts of the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal. Ultimately I had the opportunity to go with Robert McNamara to the International Criminal Court [ICC] in the Hague, to show “The Fog of War” to the court, and to answer questions with McNamara.\n\nAnd my two favorite moments from that experience – going with McNamara to visit the archivist for the ICC. McNamara told him, “I wish that they had these statutes governing war crimes back when I was secretary of defense,” and the archivist replied, “But, sir, they did.” Another completely bizarre experience, beyond Kafkaesque, seeing Milosevic on the stand. None of the proceedings had anything whatsoever to do with the content of the charges against him. It was all procedural — procedures about procedures about procedures, epicycle upon epicycle upon epicycle. And yet, the knowledge that Milosevic’s crimes were being addressed, even if only in a vague and uncertain way, was gratifying. At least someone was doing something. [Milosevic was claiming that since he was representing himself, and since he was untrained as a lawyer, he should be given 9/5 more time than the prosecutors. The 9/5th figure was arrived at through a complicated algorithm.]\n\nThe other experiences I should mention really briefly: I was taking classes from Thomas Kuhn, who ran the program in the history and philosophy of science where I was a graduate student, and Saul Kripke, who was giving a series of lectures “Naming and Necessity.” It wasn’t the first time he gave them. This is 1972. It might have been the second, maybe even the third time they had been delivered. It was risky for me to attend the Kripke lectures, because I had been told by Kuhn, “Under no circumstances are you allowed to go to these lectures.” It was an odd kind of thing.\n\nYears later, I’ve come to realize that there was a debate embodied here about the nature of language – of whether truth is socially constructed or whether ultimately concerns the relationship between language and reality. I feel very strongly, even though the world is unutterably insane, there is this idea that we can reach outside of that insanity and find truth, some kind of certainty –\n\n“The Thin Blue Line” was one the most important experiences of my life, something that I remain really, really proud of – overturning the conviction of a man who had been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit. There are endless obstacles and impediments to finding the truth – You might never find it; it’s an elusive goal. But there’s something to remember, there’s a world out there that we can apprehend, and it’s our job to go out there and apprehend it. It’s one of the deepest lessons that I’ve taken away from my experiences here.\n\n[82] Thomas Kuhn, “What Are Scientific Revolutions?” Chapter 1, The Probabilistic Revolution, Vol. 1: Ideas in History. Ed. Lorenz Kruger, Lorraine J. Daston, Michael Heidelberger. 1987. “Near misses” is a curious phrase. Is Kuhn comparing – despite incommensurability – Aristotelian and contemporary physics? It’s hard to see how Aristotle’s conception of gravity is a “near miss.” Aristotle believed that a stone falls to the ground because it returns to the place from where it originated. Is this notion incommensurable with contemporary physics? I don’t think so. It is simply false. For example, I could take a stone from the earth to the moon, and presumably it would not “try” to return to the earth.\n\n[83] Bertrand Russell, “The Impact of Science on Society.” London: Allen & Unwin. 1952. Variant from Russell, “An Outline of Intellectual Rubbish.” Girrard, Kan: Haldeman-Julius Publications. 1943. Perhaps Kuhn, given his love of incommensurability, concluded that Mrs. Aristotle had an irrational number of molars. As an example of how this kind of talk can lead to nonsense, the Nobel prize was awarded in 2005 to two researchers who established the cause of peptic ulcers. Gone were Rolaids and the claim that they could consume 47 times their weight in excess stomach acid. Stomach acid was no longer the issue. They traced the disease to the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. This has been described in many articles as “a paradigm shift.” A paradigm shift!? Is this what it amounts to? A change in belief?!\n\n[84] Wise sent me a followup email. “You were interested in two particular features of Tom’s mode of working. The first concerns the ability to qualify his statements so as to almost make a strong claim without actually making it. An example appears in his classic article on energy conservation (p. 100 in “The Essential Tension,” where he says: ‘Unless the Naturphilosophie indigenous to the educational environment of these seven men had a productive role in the researches of some, it is hard to see why more than half of the pioneers should have been drawn from an area barely through its first generation of significant scientific productivity. Nor is this quite all. If proved, the influence of Naturphilosophie may also help to explain why this particular group of five Germans, a Dane, and an Alsatian includes five of the six pioneers in whose approaches to energy conservation we have previously noted such marked conceptual lacunae.” In other words, “I have not done the research to find actual evidence for this role of Naturphilosophie, but it is true nonetheless, unless of course it turns out not to be.” I have never mastered this mode of writing, though I recognize its effectiveness. [Effective!? I assume that Norton is being ironic. – E.M.] Second, I cited an example of my own experience in working on the electrical theory of William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, in order to show why Kuhn’s critique of Whiggish interpretation had great power in the detailed reading of texts. I was presenting in seminar Thomson’s mathematical result on how electrical force F changes to F’ across the boundary of an insulator of inductive capacity k, so that F’/F = 1/k. This presented problems because Thomson claimed to be reasoning on the basis of a flow analogy to conduction of heat across a surface where the conductivity changed and his equation for the effect did not seem to follow from this view. I gave an account of his thinking which was based (implicitly) on a modern physicist’s understanding of electrostatic induction. Tom insisted (strenuously and adversarially) that my account could not be correct because it did not preserve the relation between Thomson’s verbal statements and his equation. It was Whiggish, which is the basic lesson here. The story continues, however, with its characteristically adversarial nature. He asserted an interpretation of his own which I in turn thought could not be right and said so. I then spent a great deal of time and effort on the problem and returned the next week to show why he was wrong and to present yet another account, which turned out to solve the difficulties and to give considerable insight into Thomson’s mode of analysis. The Whig story and the adversarial story are about equally important in my perception of the simultaneously intellectual and psychological struggle in working with Tom. [Are they two separate stories – the Whig and the adversarial – or is it all adversarial? – E.M.]\n\n[85] Of course, it is still possible to be skeptical about Kripke’s claim, namely that a historical chain of intentions guarantees that we can refer to things in the past. But it is, at least, an attempt to provide an alternative to the descriptivist picture of how we refer to things.\n\n[86] Kripke never tells us that we can recover beliefs from the past. I have often wondered: OK, we can refer to Pythagoras without knowing anything about him. But if we don’t know anything about him, what good does it do to be able to refer to him?\n\n[87] “√2” refers to the same thing pre-Hippasus as it does post-Hippasus, even though our beliefs about √2 may have changed.\n\n[88] Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay “Self-Reliance” weighed in on this issue, “Their every truth is not quite true. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four: so that every word they say chagrins us and we know not where to begin to set them right…”\n\n[89] As John Burgess, a professor of philosophy at Princeton, told me in an interview: “Kuhn speaks one way when speaking to historians, and another way when speaking to philosophers. The trouble begins when he starts talking about things being socially constructed. As far as I’m concerned, the stars can’t be socially constructed. The stars are billions of years old, and human society is not billions of years old. And so the latter cannot have constructed the former. On the other hand, if you just say astronomy is socially constructed, well, that’s a trivial truism. Who would deny that? Before there was human society, there weren’t any astronomers, and there wasn’t any astronomy. There is some philosophical issue here, but it’s these modes of expression. They are just a sloppy way of talking. Throwing around these expressions is in fact concealing issues rather than illuminating anything. It is encouraging a fallacious jump from the thought– since astronomy is constructed, therefore, the things astronomy is about are constructed, or something like that. And when speaking with philosophers, Kuhn would deny holding this outrageous belief. But when speaking to historians, he’d go back to using this language.”\n\n[90] From L.P.
