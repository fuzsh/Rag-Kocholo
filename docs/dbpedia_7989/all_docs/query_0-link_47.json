        "text": "The Analytic-Continental Divide\n\nInspired by Reid, but with greater ambition, G.E. Moore (1873-1958) aimed to use common sense as a resource by which to defeat scepticism. He argued that the overlooked but philosophically significant precepts of common sense are built into our ordinary language and that by ignoring this the sceptic undermines the meaning of his or her own words. Accordingly, with appropriate simplicity, Moore believed that common sense can be used to demonstrate the existence of the external world. This he famously attempted to do in ‘Proof of an External World’, in which he argued that the existence of the external world could be proved as follows: “By holding up my two hands, and saying, as I make a certain gesture with the right hand, ‘Here is one hand,’ and adding, as I make a certain gesture with the left, ‘and here is another’” (Moore 1939: 166).\n\nIt was an argument that was refuted by pointing out that Moore was simply begging the question, in his own favour. According to Wittgenstein: “Moore’s mistake lies in this – countering the assertion that one cannot know that, by saying ‘I do know it’” (Wittgenstein 1969 §521).\n\nWittgenstein’s project, particularly in On Certainty (1969), is in some respects continuous with Moore’s – both can be seen as the forefathers of ordinary language philosophy. However, mindful of Moore’s mistakes, Wittgenstein wished to sidestep the problem of scepticism rather than directly confront it.\n\n“One can defend common sense against the attacks of philosophers only by solving their puzzles, i.e. by curing them of the temptation to attack common sense, not by restating the views of common sense” (Wittgenstein 1960: 58-9).\n\nNonetheless, despite not wishing to speak on behalf of common sense, Wittgenstein reminded philosophers that their investigations had begun from a starting point in non-philosophical thinking in which of necessity not everything is doubted at once.\n\n“The questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, are as it were like hinges on which those turn” (Wittgenstein 1969 §341).\n\nApplying this point to the problem of scepticism, and wishing to cure philosophers of “the temptation to attack common sense”, rather than attempt to solve the problem directly Wittgenstein attempted to point towards where the dead-end road begins that leads to the problem whilst taking care not to step onto the road himself.\n\nAlthough Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) did not share Wittgenstein’s view of philosophy, his attitude to scepticism is in some respects comparable to Wittgenstein’s. For, on the sceptical hypothesis that the world, including all our memories, might have come into existence five minutes ago, Russell writes: “Like all skeptical hypotheses, it is logically tenable, but uninteresting” (Russell 1921: 160) – and best ignored. However, at least in his early writings, it seems that Russell was not much impressed by common sense either. In the following passage he praises philosophy as its antidote:\n\n“The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect” (Russell 1912: 129).\n\nYet, in his later, popular, books on politics and ethics he continually referenced common sense, and very often presented himself as speaking on behalf of common sense. The most obvious example is Common Sense and Nuclear Warfare (1959). This contradiction might be resolved by saying that in his books on politics and ethics, although he was trading off his reputation as a great philosopher, he was not talking as a philosopher but as a journalist. According to Charles Pigden, Russell “was not sure whether ethical propositions rose to the dignity of knowledge” (Pigden 2021).\n\nHowever, there is a further contradiction in Russell’s attitudes towards common sense. He would presumably accord Moore’s work in epistemology the name of philosophy, even though Moore aspired to speak on behalf of common sense in philosophy. But this would seem to be at odds with his argument that philosophy and common sense are fundamentally opposed. Note that this contradiction would not have arisen had Russell claimed that, “[t]he man who has no tincture of scepticism goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason.”\n\nMoore, Wittgenstein and Russell were clearly of different opinions as to philosophical methodology. Russell argued that ordinary language was unsuited to much philosophical analysis whereas Moore and Wittgenstein were respectful of the uses of ordinary language (which Moore saw as based on common sense); but none of them, and very few of their contemporaries in the English-speaking world, saw common sense as itself of philosophical interest. In this respect, they differed significantly from some of their continental contemporaries.\n\nThey differed, for example, from the (predominantly) French school of historical epistemology, that begins with Léon Brunschvicg (1869-1944) and that also includes Gaston Bachelard (1884-1962) and Hélène Metzger (1889-1994). The work of this school eventually reaches the English-speaking world indirectly via the influence of Metzger upon Thomas Kuhn (Kuhn 1962: xl).\n\nBrunschvicg was of the opinion that common sense changes over time, sometimes quite radically and that the study of history reveals that there is nothing universal about it (Brunschvig 1922: 471). Bachelard, by contrast, believed that common sense is universal but that modern science is in the process justifiably breaking away from it. He argued that although common sense still persists we should struggle against its hold in order to pursue science (see Chimisso 2001). In this regard, Bachelard was in disagreement with Emile Meyerson (1859-1933) who argued that science builds on common sense (Meyerson 1931); and with Henri Bergson (1859-1941) who argued that “science runs counter to common sense only when strictly necessary” (Bergson 1922: 35).\n\nIn summary, whereas Brunschvicg believed in radical discontinuities between the common sense of one period and that of another, Bachelard believed in a radical discontinuity between common sense and natural science. An alternative position was advanced by Metzger who argued that although there are radical discontinuities between one age and the next – for example, modern common sense would deem alchemy to be absurd – there may yet be some continuities. In advancing this position she was influenced by her own studies in the history of science and by the work of Lucien Lévy-Bruhl (1857-1939). Lévy-Bruhl referred to the different periods of history having different mentalités. Metzger referred to different periods of history as having different a prioris.\n\nNot only was there greater interest in common sense among continental philosophers, there was also, in general (at least in the early twentieth century), a somewhat greater philosophical interest in history. No general agreement was reached as to how common sense should be defined but an interesting problem was raised, particularly by Brunschvicg and Metzger, that if common sense changes through history then (against Reid and Moore) it can no longer be presupposed to consist of a number of universal truths available to everyone for all time.\n\nCommon Sense and Political Philosophy\n\nThe political aspects of common sense were explored by Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937) and Hannah Arendt (1906-1975).\n\nGramsci’s description of common sense resembles a positivist’s description of metaphysics: “Common sense is a disorderly aggregate of philosophical conceptions in which one can find whatever one likes” (Gramsci 1929-35: III, 334). Like Brunschvicg and Metzger, he believed that common sense changes over time: “Common sense is not a single conception, identical in time and space. It is the “folklore” of philosophy, and like folklore it appears in countless forms. The fundamental characteristics of common sense consist in its being a disjointed, incoherent, and inconsequential conception of the world, that matches the character of the multitudes whose philosophy it is” (Gramsci 1929-35: III, 333).\n\nHe also notes that every social stratum has its own ‘common sense,’ “which is ultimately the most widespread conception of life and morals […] Common sense is not something rigid and static; rather, it changes continuously, enriched by scientific notions and philosophical opinions which have entered into common usage. ‘Common sense’ is the folklore of ‘philosophy’ and stands midway between real ‘folklore’ (that is, as it is understood) and the philosophy, the science, the economics of the scholars. ‘Common sense’ creates the folklore of the future, that is a more or less rigidified phase of a certain time and place” (Gramsci 1929-35: I, 173).\n\nGramsci’s focus is upon common sense at the bottom of society. He believes that this contains some good sense but, since much of it has been passed down from above, it is imbued with conservatism: it “is led to believe that what exists today has always existed” (Gramsci 1929-35: III, 58). He argues that, in order to overcome this conservatism, what is required is for the proletariat to create a new common sense of their own, building upon precepts that already exist but that have been overlaid with the common sense of bourgeois conservatism. Philosophers can encourage and aid the creation of a better common sense, but only if they are in continual contact with those at the bottom of society.\n\nGramsci’s conception of common sense can be criticised for being too much like confused or repressed philosophy; however, this seems to omit one of its essential characteristics. As Vico observed, common sense is “judgement without reflection,” which philosophy is not. Even if, as Reid believed, common sense involves a modicum of reasoning, as compared to philosophy, its exercise is largely automatic.\n\nLike Gramsci, Hannah Arendt also wished to understand common sense within a historical context. But, unlike Gramsci, she does not wish to reform common sense so much as have more of it. She argued that it is common sense that enables democracy and that it is the decline of common sense, which she associates with individuals’ increasing social isolation, that enables ideological thinking (Arendt 1951).\n\nHowever, strictly speaking, Arendt’s argument relies not upon common sense but upon the Roman concept of sensus communis, ‘shared community values.’ But, again, something is missing in this view of common sense: for it is not difficult to acknowledge being in the same community as someone whom one believes to be lacking in common sense. In summary, arguably neither Gramsci nor Arendt fully captures the character of common sense: for it is not simply confused or repressed philosophy, nor is it sensus communis.\n\nHowever, we should not on that account revert to the view of Reid and Moore, that common sense is a set of universal truths. For as Brunschvicg and Metzger have shown, historical evidence casts doubt on that claim.\n\nAnd yet, even though common sense may vary over time, still, “you wouldn’t want to leave home without it” (Carey 2015: 38, my italics).\n\nMending Fences\n\nThe changeability of common sense should not be taken to imply that it is indefinable. Granted, after three hundred years it has still not been satisfactorily defined, but it is worth focussing upon its meaning for a while longer. For, as has been seen, what is at stake is not just the unresolved relationship between common sense and philosophy but also the question-begging use to which common sense is put in political polemic.\n\nIt is here suggested that although it may not be possible to define common sense as a body of knowledge, common sense may yet be defined functionally: as advice, to oneself or to others, that fulfils the essentially conservative role of preserving, as far as possible, the status quo. It “is like the loyal opposition in parliamentary democracies – annoying in its constant criticism and in the inertia it adds to the intellectual enterprise, yet important over the long haul in catching unnoticed error” (Coates 1996: 1). Gramsci was aware of the conservative function of the common sense but he thought of ‘conservative’ only in a political sense. However, a conservative political sense is optional.\n\nWhere common sense is, I believe, undeniably useful – not just to political conservatives – is in dealing with the unforeseen. For example, if I suddenly notice a small child near the edge of a cliff or standing next to a box of fireworks with a box of matches it would be highly inefficient to have to run through a formal argument about what to do. Setting aside the issue of whether it is instinctive (as Hume believed) or whether it involves a modicum of reason (as Reid believed), in these situations common sense is “as invaluable as the virtue of conformity in the army and navy” (Thoreau 1849: 387). Conversely, in situations where reflection is needed, common sense alone can rarely can tell us what to think or do. “Uncommon sense” seems a better option.\n\nBut there is no meta-level from which to assign philosophy to one area of life and common sense to another. It is as well to have them both to-hand. Indeed, even in philosophy, in all its manifestations, common sense is not entirely forsaken. The prime example may be the principle of Occam’s razor: all else being equal, we should choose the simpler of two theses. This principle is sometimes formulated as Entia non sunt multipicanda praeter necessitatem (Entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity) but the words Occam actually used were, Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora (it is pointless to do with more things what can be done with fewer) (see Thorburn 1918).\n\nWilliam of Occam (1285-1347) makes much use of this principle but it should be noted that there are similar views to be found in Aristotle, Seneca, Grosseteste and Aquinas, all of whom predate Occam. Indeed, although evidence of popular sayings of the time is sparse, it is not hard to imagine Occam deriving the idea that “it is pointless to do with more things what can be done with fewer” from a similar saying already in common use. Most of William of Occam’s contemporaries would have accepted the principle, although of course any overt suggestion that God works in any respect in the same way as, for example, a peasant mending a fence is likely to have been found controversial. But, nonetheless, despite this potential for controversy, the principle of Occam’s razor conforms to our suggested functional definition of common sense as advice intended to preserve the status quo (including the status quo of pre-existing beliefs). “Common sense . . . points to the rational procedure of tenaciously holding on to our current beliefs until enough evidence is mustered to warrant their abandonment” (Coates 1996: 5).\n\nAccording to this suggested functionalist understanding of common sense, the use of Occam’s razor should not be taken to imply that philosophy and common sense are necessarily continuous with each other. Their focus is different: the exercise of common sense involves a drawing back from unforeseen danger, often automatically; whereas in philosophy we are more interested in seeking out unforeseen dangers in order to then avoid them.\n\nOn this understanding, common sense and philosophy (including scepticism) are not continuous with each other but nor are they necessarily in conflict – no more than are conservatism and creativity."
