        "text": "The work of Thomas Kuhn has been very influential in Anglo-American philosophy of science and it is claimed that it has initiated the historical turn. Although this might be the case for English speaking countries, in France an historical approach has always been the rule. This article aims to investigate the similarities and differences between Kuhn and French philosophy of science or ‘French epistemology’. The first part will argue that he is influenced by French epistemologists, but by lesser known authors than often thought. The second part focuses on the reactions of French epistemologists on Kuhn’s work, which were often very critical. It is argued that behind some superficial similarities there are deep disagreements between Kuhn and French epistemology. This is finally shown by a brief comparison with the reaction of more recent French philosophers of science, who distance themselves from French epistemology and are more positive about Kuhn. Based on these diverse appreciations of Kuhn, a typology of the different positions within the philosophy of science is suggested.\n\nTraditionally, Thomas S. Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) is largely identified with his analysis of the structure of scientific revolutions. Here, we contribute to a minority tradition in the Kuhn literature by interpreting the history of evolutionary biology through the prism of the entire historical developmental model of sciences that he elaborates in The Structure. This research not only reveals a certain match between this model and the history of evolutionary biology but, more importantly, also sheds new light on several episodes in that history, and particularly on the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859), the construction of the modern evolutionary synthesis, the chronic discontent with it, and the latest expression of that discontent , called the extended evolutionary synthesis. Lastly, we also explain why this kind of analysis hasn't been done before.\n\nLate in his career, Thomas S. Kuhn practiced more as a philosopher of science than as a historian of science. However, his earlier work-leading up to The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and during the majority of his tenure in the Princeton history of science group-focused on \"mapping\" the shape of the history of the physical sciences and on modeling the dynamics, or \"motor,\" of scientific traditions. This paper examines the younger Kuhn's excursions in map and motor design. It views Kuhn as a \"critical historian,\" that is, a historian who constructs explanatory categories in order to apply them to large-scale narratives, evaluation of which can suggest modification of those guiding categories. The younger Kuhn's map and motor design was largely shaped by the work of his historiographical idol, Alexandre Koyré. Kuhn's creative articulation of Koyré's position explains his innovations concerning Scientific Revolutions (plural), his loosening of Koyré's central category of \"metaphysics,\" and his invention of the crucial conception of \"normal science.\" Additionally, Kuhn's devotion to Koyré explains some historiographical pitfalls and blind spots that bedeviled his historical work: for example, his ignoring early modern natural philosophizing as an institution and culture in its own right and his failure to capitalize on his correct insight into the nature of scientific discovery as the nonrevolutionary yet tradition-modifying core process in the sciences. The paper is concerned with Kuhn's work as a critical historian and his legacy for younger historians, not with philosophical debates about his texts."
