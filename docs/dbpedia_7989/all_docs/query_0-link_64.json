        "meta_description": "Available in: Hardback. \"This introduction to Kuhn's ideas covers the full breadth of his work, both situating \"\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\"\" within his wider work and drawing attention to the development of his ideas over time. The main criticisms of Kuhn's work are addressed. The author argues that Kuhn's thinking betrays a residual committment to many theses characteristic of the empirists he set out to challenge. The book concludes by looking at Kuhn's influence on history and philosophy of science and asks where the field may be heading in the wake of Kuhn's ideas.\"",
