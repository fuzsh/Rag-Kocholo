Thomas Kuhn

This book had an enormous impact that influenced everything written about science by philosophers, historians, and sociologists. Kuhn’s book also influenced areas of politics and business. Scientists debated over this book, even though it shattered many traditional myths about science. In his book, Kuhn showed that actual scientific behavior had little in common with philosophical theories of rationality and knowledge (Smith 75).

Kuhn is also best known for his theories on paradigm shifts and how they occur in the scientific field. His basic idea was that science was influenced by factors such as social class, politics, gender, racial bias, and other factors that are outside specific scientific context. Kuhn’s study of science and scientists using the tools of sociology led him to conclude that science had become more entwined with culture and historical content.

. Kuhn suggested that until there is a major paradigm shift, scientists will make discoveries that are expected. He also reduced the scientific field down to a puzzle solving game like a crossword puzzle (Thomas Kuhn par 2).Kuhn’s paradigm theory involved an organized method of scientific research and study in some field.

This scientific theory involves changes being made by revolutions as one paradigm replaces another. Kuhn claimed that data and logic alone could not force a paradigm shift because different paradigms include different rules about processing data and accessing theories. Some interpreted Kuhn’s theories by suggesting that paradigm shifts are irrational based on conflicting viewpoints.
