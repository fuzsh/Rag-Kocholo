Tyco.™ tL/ca By Graham Collins FROM THE EDITOR under Attack Once again, the Australian state of Queensland had to pick up the pieces, this time in the aftermath of tropical cyclone Oswald. Coming hard on the heels of bushfires across the state, Queensland's fire and rescue service almost seamlessly had to transfer its attention to flood water rescue operations. The way in which these professional emergency service personnel meet every challenge thrown at them rightfully deserves our highest praise and admiration, the more so as many are volunteers. S o, it stopped me in my tracks when I learnt that a researcher at one of the country's universities had expressed the view that the nation spends too much on fire prevention. His argument appears to be that, dollar for dollar, it would be justified to switch some of the fire prevention budget to improving road safety. Academically, this argument might well have some financial justification, but I feel it misses the point. First, the primary driver of fire prevention is to save lives; it is as simple as that. This therefore begs the question: how much is a human life worth? If anyone believes they can answer that question, I feel they are in serious need of reassessing their attitude to their fellow man. I would also suggest that, having arrived at a figure, they ask themselves if they feel it applies to their own wife or husband, children or parents. rescue\" service and not the old outdated title of \"fire brigade\". If countries go down the route this researcher is indicating, they will have to be willing to risk that their fire and rescue service may not be sufficiently well manned or adequately resourced to deal with bushfires, cyclones, tornadoes, earth- quakes, volcanic eruptions and floods. In case this latter point needs emphasising, the indisputable fact is that natural disasters are getting more ferocious and more frequent, so there will be even greater demands placed on the emergency services. According to the USA's National Climatic Data Centre, in the 15 year period between 1980 and 1995 there were 46 natural disasters in the USA causing damages in excess of US$ one billion. This compares with the 15 year period from 1995 to 2010 where and the number of disasters in How much is a human life worth? If anyone believes they can answer that question, l feel they are in serious need of reassessing their attitude to their fellow man. This is not to deny the need to invest more in other areas - such as road safety - where lives are lost. Indeed not. My argument is that funds should not be siphoned from one essential area to fund another. Rather, we should be looking for politicians in every country to curb spending in non-essential or merely status-building activities and direct it at what should be their constant top-of-the-agenda interest, namely the safety, health and wellbeing of their nation's population. The second point that I feel this cost/benefit analysis misses is that those involved in fire safety across the Asia Pacific region - in fact, worldwide - no longer have the remit to deal solely with fires, which is why we now refer to the \"fire and the USA in this category nearly doubled to 87. In 2011, the USA suffered 14 disasters in the US$ one billion plus category, against the previous 15-year average of fewer than six. 2011 also experienced the most costly disaster of all time, the Japanese earthquake and tsunami that cost a staggering US$235 billion. In financially troubled times spending inevitably goes under the spotlight's glare. Perhaps though, rather than suggesting diluting one essential life safety service to fund another equally deserving activity, it would be better to seek adequate resourcing for all such endeavours at the expense of those activities that do not impac t on safety.

The Problem of Taking NFPA 25 inspections Too Far Sprinkler system maintenance and management of change are critical topics that impact property owners and inspectors around the globe. No matter how well a system is designed, the day the systems are brought on-line, their functionality can only decrease. T he battle against diminishing functionality of a system does not have to be a fore- gone conclusion however thanks to NFPA 25 ( Inspection , Testing , and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems and NFPA 3, Recommended Practice for Commissioning and Integrated Testing of Fire Protection and Life Safety Systems). It is not uncommon to see \"design issues\" noted on an inspector's deficiency report following a review of a sprinkler system as required by NFPA 25. The question is: should \"design issues\" be noted at all? standard? Answering this question requires the person conducting the evaluation to have some knowledge of the original system design, the applicable codes and standards, and the design drawings for the property. In this case, each device would have to be thoroughly reviewed. A design evaluation of a typical office building, for instance, would require the inspector to measure all distances between sprinklers, as well as distances to possible obstructions - hundreds of individual measurements. That is not to say that inspectors should not inform building owners that there may be an issue It is not uncommon to see “design issues” noted on an inspector's deficiency report following a review of a sprinkler system. The question is: should “design issues\" be noted at all? Matt Klaus is a senior fire protection engineer at NFPA and staff liaison on NFPA 13, 13R, 13D For further information, go to www.nfpa.com While it seems like common sense for inspectors to identify such problems, design deficiencies are not part of the scope of NFPA 25. From an inspec- tion standpoint, NFPA 25 is written as a \"wear and tear\" document, not a design evaluation standard - a differentiation that often leaves people scratching their head. While design deficiencies and failures in managing change can create serious life safety concerns and have been attributed to the failure of water-based fire protection systems, it is important to understand where these issues should be documented, and by whom. Inspections conducted in accordance with NFPA 25 should focus on the functionality of the system or component. The central question in an NFPA 25 inspection is, can this component or system function properly in its current state? The answer to this question can usually be made from the floor level relatively quickly, and includes things like leaking sprinklers, paint on deflectors, and corroded control valves. By comparison, a design evaluation, or retro- commissioning event is a confirmation that the system was designed and installed in accordance with the appropriate design standard at the time of construction. Here, the central question is, was this component or system designed and installed appropriately based on the applicable code or design with a system. The problem with providing a client with more information though is that it can open the inspector to liability. If an inspector is identify- ing some design deficiencies on his NFPA 25 inspection report, but not all of them, the line can become blurred as to the depth of the review and the inspector's contractual obligation. Many owners believe that NFPA 25 requires the inspector to conduct a design evaluation, so when an inspector provides a few design issues mixed in with proper NFPA 25 deficiencies, it can further muddy the waters. Many inspectors feel they have a moral and ethical obligation to inform their clients of all potential concerns. One way to comply with the requirements of NFPA 25 while still satisfying that moral obligation is to keep two deficiency reports: one dealing with NFPA 25 issues and another that could be called the \"good Samaritan\" list. The NFPA 25 report catalogues wear and tear issues while clearly identifying the scope of NFPA 25. The \"good Samaritan\" report lists all other items that are beyond the scope of NFPA 25, along with a disclaimer stating that these items are not con- sidered part of an NFPA 25 inspection program. This way the scope of NFPA 25 is clearly acknowledged, as are any and all prob lems observed during the inspection.

Due to the widespread use of highly combustible materials and increasing government regulations the need for residential fire sprinklers is of growing importance. Darley will offer a full line-up of economically priced products with the ability to provide a plug and play system for any NFPA 1 3D application. F ire sprinkler systems make an undeniable contribution to saving lives, and there is considerable growth potential in the market, particularly in the USA as states pass laws mandating the installation of fire sprinkler systems in new residential build- ings. Parley's new line of pumps fills a major void in the market, and its new pumps will make a major change to residen- tial fire protection, and in doing so save lives and reduce property damage and losses. Parley's new Standard unit is an entry level pressure-based system with a very economical price point. The Stan- dard Plus is the market's only panel-based system with a weekly Pumperciser. The Pumerciser is a built-in auto exerciser. Once a week, the pump will automatically exercise itself, which will help ensure reliability. All systems use a commercial-grade high efficiency stainless steel pump. The packaged systems include a pre-plumed stainless steel suction and discharge manifold, sc tm'mD ^ * s mm* t'* 1 • including pressure gauges to moni- tor constant pressure readings. Parley's self-testing systems (STS) features patent-pending technology with the potential to forever change the residential fire safety market. The STS offers the market's only self-calibrating and self-testing sys- tem. It makes installation as easy as pushing a button and ownership as easy as looking for the Green Check. After installation, there is no required human intervention to operate or test the system. Parley kept end users peace of mind at the fore- front when designing the new offering, and integrated several additional safety features. For example, three key safety features are: recovery mode; seal saving mode; and jockey pump mode. Recovery mode prevents unwanted damage to the pump during non-fire conditions by ensuring that the pump runs for the minimum NFPA requirement of ten minutes whenever the pump is activated. Seal saving mode recirculates fresh water inside the seal chamber to help reduce the risk of burning a mechanical seal during recovery mode. Jockey pump mode allows the system to recharge due to a potential slow steady drop in pressure. Parley will offer a full line-up of systems with its Standard, Standard Plus and Self-Testing System. These are complimented with a very basic Stan- dard-Price Saver (PS) model and a packaged dual Self-Testing System model. The Standard-PS comes in a packaged box with a pump, pressure switch and pressure gauge. The Pual STS has the same features as the Self-Testing System and offers end users 100% redundancy. All of these options enable Parley to offer an unlimited range of pump capabilities. No project is too big and Parley is committed to help you with your fire prote ction needs. EE9 ASIA PACIFIC FIRE 9 NEWS Vehicle Boosts Firefighting Efficiency and Safety GRADALL INDUSTRIES is introducing the Strategic Emergency Response Vehicle [SERV] FA 50 firefighting device, designed to be mounted on a fire truck to dramatically increase firefighting efficiency and safety. The rugged Gradall hydraulic boom can telescope out 1 5.2 metres and uses a stainless steel 5th-man nozzle attachment to ventilate buildings by breaking through walls and roofs as well as reaching through windows, rotating up to 220° or swinging to the left and right. Once inside a burning structure, the 5th-man nozzle has 52 aqua-jet nozzles that direct a massive broken stream curtain of water - or Class A or Class B foam for chemical fires - into the fire. Firefighters can control the FA 50 from over 60 metres away using a wireless remote control device. This allows the firefighter to precisely position the apparatus with an easy- to-use system of controls on the belt-held remote device. For extra fire truck stability, the FA 50 is equipped with four stabilisers that are also controlled with the wireless remote. The stabilisers telescope out and down and can be positioned all at once or independently, providing short jacking capabilities. For more information, go to www.gradallserv.com instant vehicle Stabilisation The HOLMATRO V-Strut is designed to help rescue workers stabilise any type of car quickly, easily and safely after a road traffic accident. Incorporating an integrated head, non- slip base plate and tensioning belt with a hook and ratchet mechanism, this lightweight, all-in-one tool is ready for immediate use at a rescue scene. With its unique auto-lock system, the V-Strut takes just 1 5 seconds to set up. All a rescue worker has to do is pull it out to the required length and it locks automatically in a single movement. Fine length adjustment allows accurate positioning of the V-Strut whether the vehicle is on its side or roof. A tensioning belt with a hook and ratchet mechanism secures the V-Strut to the car, rapidly creating a stable triangle. In addition, the serrated, multi-purpose head maintains a firm grip and the non-slip base plate prevents the strut from sliding away on any surface. The V-Strut has a high shoring capacity of 16 kN. Nevertheless it weighs only 7.2 kilogrammes, so is easy to carry and handle. A sliding heat-resistant cover protects the tensioning belt against hot exhausts. For more information, go to www.holmatro.com Research Funding Boosted BUSHFIRE CRC (The Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre) has welcomed the Australian Government announcement to create an expanded national centre for research into bushfires and natural hazards. Aud$47 million will be invested over eight years for a new Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, starting in July 201 3. This Centre will build on the ten years of national research by Bushfire CRC and will expand research into other hazards including floods, earthquakes, cyclones and tsunamis. Funding for Bushfire CRC was scheduled to end in June 201 3, so the announcement was timely and with a long term vision. Gary Morgan, CEO of the Bushfire CRC, said: \"The creation of the first national centre for combined research into fire and natural hazards is a welcome development by the Australian Government. The knowledge and expertise that has been built up over the past decade in national bushfire research can now continue and be expanded into related areas involving other natural hazards.\" Current bushfire research projects including communicating warnings, community education and resilience, incident management, severe weather, urban planning, ecology and biodiversity, and emergency worker safety, have the potential to be extended across other natural hazards. In addition, there are new areas of research that will be opened up under this broader research centre. For more information, go to www.bushfirecrc.com 10 ASIA PACIFIC FIRE PROFILE Matching the Needs of Today's Firefighters Firefighters around the world are exposed to the toughest conditions while on duty. During firefighting and rescue operations they experience varying environments and climatic conditions that impact them physically. In order to reduce fatigue, heat-stress and confinement issues as well as maximize durability and comfort, LION has made it its mission to develop PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) in a way to minimise the physiological constraints on the wearer. For more information, go to www.lhd-group.com T he superior design, durability and holistic service via TotalCare garment management system provided by Lion has led to contracts around the globe with major agencies including the Hong Kong Fire Service Department, Singapore Civil Defence Force, Brandweer Amsterdam and the South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service, to name but a few. Utilising State-of-the-Art Material Lion ensures that garments are continually getting lighter while vastly improving their level of protec- tion, breathability, durability and comfort. Of the multiple assemblies and composite constructions Lion has available to meet with the end users' requirements, the three-layer or two-layer construc- tion, utilising the spacer technology is one of which Lion is specifically proud. Through combining the thermal and moisture barriers into a single com- posite, this technology reduces tremendously he overall weight of garment, therefore making it less bulky and improving overall movability. This patented Lion innovation significantly revolutionises the way firefighting PPE is manufactured. Optimizing Ergonomics Optimizing ergonomics is essential to enable the first responder's freedom of movement. For this reason, Lion's garments are designed and produced to move in synergy with the firefighter's natural body movements. The raglan cut of the jacket allows the wearer to work overhead or in confined spaces without limiting the reach of the wearer - while at the same time preventing the hem of the coat rising up, thus minimising exposure. Together with the high-waist-cut trousers, this ensures that there is always sufficient overlapping of the jacket and pants. A lengthened sleeve and a thumb loop inte- grated into the cuff prevents the sleeve from slipping back to expose the hand and/or arm, provides optimum protection irrespective of the glove length. The legs and arms of each garment are contoured to enhance natural movement and motion for the firefighter. Notched elbows and knees greatly reduce excess material from gathering behind these joints, providing greater freedom of movement while min- imising wearer fatigue. The padded suspenders pre- vent compression when carrying personal equipment like breathing apparatus and assist by carrying the weight of the trousers evenly across the shoulders. Safety Features Safety features are essential for any suit, to assist in situations requiring prevention or quick response. All Lion garments have an inspection portal enabling the assessment of the internal composition fabrics of each individual garment. This ensures that the garments are \"ready for action\" and offer sufficient protection. Should first responders find themselves in a volatile situation, Lion garments are available with integrated drag-rescue-devices (DRD), rescue loops and/or panic-zipper. Creating Innovations Creative innovation is essential to ensure Lion can always cater to the evolving needs of the first responder community. Apart from the spacer technology and the integrated rescue loop in its garments, Lion invented the vented moisture barrier (VMB). This reduces the build-up of heat beneath the turn-out coat by allowing air flow into the jacket - key in reducing heat stress while enroute to a call or while engaged in exterior firefighting operations. Furthermore, our Cooline suspenders actively reduce the temperature beneath the coat, helping to main- tain the comfort level and further reducing heat stress. The TotalCare Service offered by Lion around the globe is another innovation that speaks for the capabilities of our company, giving the customer the ability to choose service modules from design over laundry and inspection to disposal of garments. The TotalCare solution has proven to prolong the durability of garments drastically. By incorporating all these features and services, Lion is able to provide a quality second to none in the PPE industry. Lion's professional products and services, as well as its transparency help to provide customers with cost-effective solutions. Lion works collaboratively with its customers to ensure the final product meets with their operational requirements while consistently exposing them to the late st in world-class designs and global innovations.

Bushfire CRC CEO, Gary Morgan, said the research was of national significance. \"The data collected will help inform future public policy not just in Tasmania and New South Wales, but around Australia and New Zealand. The vital research that follows major fires is only possible through the national approach taken by the Bushfire CRC. This collaboration was not available ten years ago, before the Bushfire CRC was formed.\" For the Tasmanian research, Bushfire CRC researchers were sourced from Bushfire CRC partner universities, including the universities of Tasmania, La Trobe, Western Australia, Murdoch and RMIT. For the NSW research, teams comprised researchers from the Australian National University, as well as the universities of Canberra, Canterbury (New Zealand) and La Trobe. Previously, Bushfire CRC research task forces have been active following the Western Australia bushfires of January 201 1 , the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 in Victoria, and the Eyre Peninsula fires of 2005. The findings from these previous task forces have informed inquiries including the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission.

According to Firetrace, Escort Cranes chose its Firetrace system to ensure 100 percent response reliability, 100 percent of the time; provide around-the-clock, unsupervised protection and be capable of withstanding potentially corrosive working environments and the heavy and sometimes erratic vibration. In this instance, the Firetrace system selected was the ILP (Indirect Low Pressure) system and the suppressant was ABC dry chemical. Firetrace systems comprise an extinguishing agent cylinder that is attached to technically-advanced proprietary Firetrace Detection Tubing. This leak-resistant polymer tubing is a linear pneumatic heat and flame detector that is designed to deliver the desired temperature-sensitive detection and delivery characteristics. Due to the flexibility of the detection tubing, it can be routed throughout the crane's engine compartment. When this tubing is exposed to heat and radiant energy from a fire, it ruptures. And the ABC power suppression agent is discharged from the cylinder through diffuser nozzles, flooding the entire engine compartment.

Argus thermal imaging cameras from e2v have a thirty year history in the emergency service market, and all our technical knowledge and experience working with first responders has led to the launch of our best cameras yet. For more information, go to www.argusdirect.com T he Argus Mi-TIC is the world's smallest high- resolution thermal imaging camera designed for firefighting applications. It is a personal camera that any firefighter using breathing apparatus (BA) can attach seamlessly to his or her BA strap, or fix to the tunic or pocket, boasting a recording facility that continually records once the camera is switched on so incidents can be reviewed and assessed by OICs. The Mi-TIC range offers the option of a simple on/off one-button camera to power up and go or a three-button option that allows the user to personally configure the camera's features. Both are simple to use, robust and extremely convenient units that provide a superb resolution of image while almost becoming part of the firefighter's PPE - a move that everyone will appreciate, most importantly the front-line firefighter. The camera delivers the best image quality and clarity of any personal imager on the market. The ruggedly engineered Argus Mi-TIC is extremely lightweight at less than 750 grams and demands minimal training. It is intuitive, simple to operate and no user maintenance is required other than cleaning the imager after use. No software is necessary to download images; downloading is as simple as downloading from a digital camera. An SD card in the Argus Mi-TIC can accommodate more than four hours of recording and 1000 images. The new camera uses Argus' advanced digital imaging technology and boasts a 69mm LCD screen - one of the largest format LCD screens on a personalised thermal imaging camera in the world. It can be held comfortably in the palm of the hand, (we have tested it using every known brand of firefighter glove) stored in a jacket for quick access, clipped outside a pocket, clipped to a lanyard or hung around the neck. It offers a simple thumb-operated on/off function with a superb start up time of under five seconds. On-screen features includes: spot temperature crosshair and reading; live temperature bar; battery indicator; temperature sensitivity; and date and time. It comes complete with Argus' unique dual use desktop dock/in-truck charger unit. This multi- functional unit charges the Argus Mi-TIC and a spare battery when placed into the unit and locked into position. Up to six charger units can be daisy-chained together. Other features include customer configuration that allows the user to set up the camera to work according to their own procedures and protocols, while tri-mode sensitivity allows temperature variations as high as 1 832°F and as low as -40°F. The dynamic range of the Argus Mi-TIC means that a casualty located in a very high temperature environment can still be seen by the camera's user. \"One button\" camera enables the user to set 'black box' recording on/off, while \"three button\" camera permits the user to set the function of the additional buttons for image capture, image freeze, switch application colour mode, firefighter and search/overhaul, and digital zoom. A whole raft of off-the-shelf accessories, such as a laser pointer or flash light, can be attached to the picatinny rail at the top of the camera. Thanks to the design of a quick-fit sun shroud, the camera can also be use outside in bright sunlight. The new Argus Mi-TIC incorporates tempera- ture and compression safe lithium phosphate battery technology. There is a two-hour and four-hour battery option and the camera's battery pack allows it to be powered by off-the-shelf AA batteries, enabling the user to use the camera in an emergency if the rechargeable batteries have run down. Now that TICs are widely accepted, it is important for departments to become smarter consumers of new TIC technology. We have seen the number of cameras on the market slowly rising over the years, few close to the quality or reliability of Argus. The Mi-TIC is undoubtedly the future of firefighter thermal imaging. Make the right choice - invest in thermal imaging and make sure it i s an Argus.

The project, which was undertaken as part of a major renovation, refurbishment and upgrading of the kitchen of the popular Opera Bar, complies with the latest fire safety standards These include Underwriters Laboratories' UL 300 standard and the Australian standards, AS/NZ 1668 Set: 2005 and AS 3772. The solution supplied was a pre-engineered Ansul R-102 system, to protect the cooking appliances, hoods and ductwork. The system will automatically detect and suppresses a fire in the Opera Bar kitchen before it has time to take hold. It ensures fast flame knock-down, secures vapours, and cools hot surfaces and cooking oils. The agent will not corrode the cooking equipment, and post-fire clean-up requires nothing more than flushing the affected area with water or steam. Although an automatic system, Ansul R-102 can also be triggered manually. Furthermore, immediately the system detects a fire, the gas or electric power to the kitchen appliances is cut-off prior to suppressant discharge.

HD product range comprises of an extensive range of deluge valve models with various construction materials, trim types and features. D eluge valves, which are also known as system control valves in a deluge system, are used for the fast application of water in spray systems. Deluge systems protect areas such as power transformer installation, storage tanks, con- veyor protection and various other industrial applications. With the addition of a foaming agent, deluge valves can also be used to protect areas such as aircraft hangars and inflammable liquid stores. In order to make deluge valve systems more user-friend- ly, it is necessary to consider operational ease as well as faster and convenient installa- tion. With this in mind, HD Fire Protect has designed and manufactured a range of deluge skids. These deluge skids are standard modular packages. The skids are either standard UL Listed models or custom engineered to meet specific requirements. Primarily the skids can be categorised as skid cabinets or open-type frame mounted. In the case of skid cabinets, the whole skid assembly is contained inside a stainless steel, powder coated cabinet. The cabinets have been designed to have an aesthetically pleasing appear- ance. All of the gauges are visible externally through a transparent polycarbonate window, while all of the side panels are easily removable for ease of maintenance. The cabinets can also house a temperature control feature for when skids are likely to be used in extreme or freezing tempera- tures. Open skids are mounted on a steel frame. The deluge valve mounting could be vertical or horizontal. The open skids can also be supplied as multi-line deluge valve skids, where between three and six deluge valves can be mounted vertically on a single skid. There are also a number of special skid designs, for example, where factors such as space constrains need to be taken into account, when compact vertical skids are available. Flanged or grooved connections are provided, and recently HD Fire Protect also launched a skid that is suitable for sea water applications. In that case the complete skid is built using corrosion resistant materials. The HD skids are completely pre-assembled and factory tested, and generally come with down- stream, upstream and bypass valves, which can be gear operated using butterfly valves or gate valves. Instrumentation, such as pressure switches, solenoid valves, pressure transmitters, limit switches and basic control panels are mounted, pre- wired and terminated into a junction box.

A joint initiative of three 'not-for-profit' organisations - the Australian Institute of Emergency Services, the Australian & New Zealand Mental Health Organisation Inc, and the Association for Sustainability in Business Inc. Australian and New Zealand communities are / \\ continually facing heart-breaking losses caused / \\ by the increasing severity and frequency of natural disasters. The impact of bushfires, floods, storms, earthquakes and other hazards not only affect communities, they also affect each country's economy, infrastructure and the environment. Acknowledging that a 'whole-of-nation' resilience-based approach to disaster management and a national, coordinated and cooperative effort is needed to enhance the capacity to withstand and recover from emergencies and disasters, the conference will focus on prevention, preparedness, response and recovery and incorporate keynote addresses, concurrent sessions and workshops covering human and social issues, economic and environmental challenges, infrastructure, communi- ty and communication topics. The conference committee has created a com- prehensive forum that shines a spotlight on resilience and offers professionals - and future pro- fessionals - an opportunity to advance and improve approaches, thoughts and opinions and develop expertise, competencies and aptitudes relating to information and facts surrounding preparedness for future disasters, emergencies and hazards and the ability to recover from them quickly and efficiently. Four interactive optional pre-conference work- shops will feature on Tuesday 28th May, covering important topics on animals in disaster, business continuity, resilience and trauma and disaster mental health. On Wednesday 29th May the confer- ence will be opened by Hon. Jack Dempsey MP, Minister for Police and Community Safety and will follow with keynote presentations from Grant Morrison, Director of Disaster Prevention and Risk Reduction at AusAid, Associate Professor Brett Aimers, the Chief Nurse at St John Ambulance Australia, Commissioner Ian Stewart, Queensland Police Commissioner and Dr Ian Dacre Disaster Management Operations Director, Asia Pacific for the World Society for the Protection of Animals. Concurrent sessions will carry on from the keynote presentations and the day will conclude with a welcome reception where delegates can network, walk through the trade exhibition and view over 30 poster presentations. Concurrent sessions will continue on day two and proceed with further keynote presentations by Craig Lapsley, Fire Services Commissioner of Victoria, Scott Milne the Response Manager and Global Director of the International Association of Emergency Managers, Professor Philip Morris the President of the Australian and New Zealand Mental Health Association and Dr Rob Vertessy the Director and CEO of the Bureau of Meteorology. The conference will conclude on Thursday 30th May. Dr Allison Rowlands, the Director of Disaster Welfare at the Ministry for Police and Emergency Services, will look at the conceptualisation of and planning for major evacuation centres, the under- lying principles, emergency arrangements context, and considerations for the congregate care of a large number of vulnerable people over ten days, uprooted from their home community. The presen- tation will focus on the town of Hay, which has 2,800 residents, where the New South Wales' (NSW) State Emergency Service (SES) issued an evacuation order on 15th March 2012. The Welfare Services' functional area of NSW's Emergency Management Plan embarked on planning the evacuation response and arrange- ments for the care of the community. This resulted in the development and erection of a 500-bed major evacuation centre at Deniliquin. Numerous issues were identified and resolved by the team and implications for future planning and practice articu- lated. During Dr Rowlands' presentation she will explore some of these key issues that include remoteness of the intervention and supervision and support for the welfare team, responding to the needs of vulnerable groups within the evacuated community, planning leisure activities/managing boredom, managing the community meetings, tensions and psychosocial issues within the evacuated community, managing the return process and over- seeing local, regional and state-level processes and relationships within the emergency management agencies. With a quality program packed with over 70 speakers, this year's conference is one not to miss. Presenters will focus on themes such as risk and crisis management, social media, volunteer and community involvement, animals in disa sters, business continuity and relief and recovery.

Manufacturers working in the PPE industry appreciate only too well the huge responsibility that is bestowed upon them. This is not just a responsibility to develop and produce the highest quality fabrics and garments to be worn by firefighters, although clearly this is important. The biggest responsibility is to ensure that the garments worn by our fire services in all the different scenarios they face offer the best possible protection. Tom Hainsworth Hainsworth W hen asked what the number one objective is, my reply is always the same: \"To pro- tect individuals that work in hazardous environments from burn injury so they return home safely to their families\". It therefore follows that buyers and specifiers operating in the PPE industry are both incredibly rigorous and demand- ing in ensuring that the garments selected to be worn by firefighters in their respective territories meet this criteria. One of the many healthy aspects of the Australia and New Zealand fire market is that the standards for structural and wildland firefight- ing are driven by the fire services themselves. This ensures that the structural firefighting standard AS NZS 4967:2009 and AS NZS 4824:2006 for wildland firefighting are as aligned as possible with the day-to-day requirements of the firefighters on the frontline. Those responsible for developing the standards and ensuring that they continue to be as relevant as possible to the challenges faced by firefighters in this part of the world are looking for a number of attributes from industry suppliers. All of these attributes are underpinned by the overriding responsibility highlighted earlier - namely, to ensure firefighters are afforded the best possible standards of protection. ASIA PACIFIC FIRE 21 / STi ° e Pen<l4i b i e *****, Only BRISTOL ticks all the right boxes • Dependable • Financially Sound • Trustworthy & Honest • Reliable Partner Bristol Uniforms Ltd, Bristol, United Kingdom, BS16 5LL Tel: +44 (0) 1 1 7 956 31 01 enquiries@bristoluniforms.com www.bristoluniforms.com One of the most important attributes in an increasingly competitive world is the expectation that manufacturers will continue to demonstrate innovation in their product development. Innova- tion needs to be backed up by a strong under- standing of the science behind the performance of the products that have been developed and a thorough appreciation of the risks being faced by the end user. Only by understanding these two areas well, can you properly assess the performance of the innovation in real life. For example, every product developed by Hainsworth is subject to the most stringent levels of testing in our own accredited laboratory and, like other leading manufacturers, we pride ourselves on the attention to detail. In developing products appropriate for the Australian and New Zealand market, there is a need to give consideration to the different challenges faced by structural and wildland fire- fighters. The design of fabrics is heavily influenced by the environment in which the firefighter operates and how the garments will be worn. For example, the outer shell of a structural firefighter's kit is designed to minimise the effects of heat stress and protect against the risk of flashover, while the inner lining helps to move moisture away as fast as possible. However, in the case of the wildland firefighter, there is only one layer, which is both the outer-shell and next to the skin and therefore has to prevent heat from getting in while also moving moisture away. All kit has to be robust enough to offer high levels of thermal and mechanical 22 ASIA PACIFIC FIRE WHAT'S DRIVING THE PPE MARKET? protection while also being light and breathable enough to minimise heat stress. Heat stress is the biggest killer of firefighters in the world and is a threat to both structural and wildland firefighters. However, the particular design and use of fabrics differs according to the specific environments encountered. For example, a firefighter tackling a fire in a burning building will typically be confronted by extreme levels of heat for a relatively short period, whereas a firefighter battling a wildland blaze will be exposed to extreme heat (in the case of the recent wildland fires in New South Wales and Tasmania, temperatures hit 45°C) over a much longer period of time. Heat stress, if not managed and monitored effectively, not only endangers the life of a firefighter but, on a more day to day basis, can seriously harm the wearer's decision-making ability which, in turn, puts the lives of colleagues on the line. As highlighted earlier, a manufacturer is expected to have a comprehensive understanding of the science that underpins the development of specific products. The body's internal core temperature is closely regulated and remains within a very tightly defined range from approximately 36°C to 38°C. This temperature range is maintained by control- ling the equilibrium between the amount of heat the body produces through physical activity, the amount of heat stored by the body and the amount of heat lost to the surroundings through sweat evaporation and heat radiation, convection and conduction aided by vasodilation. One important attribute in a competitive world is the expectation that manufacturers will continue to demonstrate innovation in their product development. When the ambient temperature of the sur- roundings rises to above 35°C, heat loss through radiation, convection and conduction stops and the only way left for the body to cool itself is through sweat evaporation. This will also stop if the heat and humidity becomes excessive, causing the body to store the excess heat produced and produces a rise in the core body temperature. Firefighter standards in this part of the world are not only rigorous in terms of the importance of the levels of protection offered; they also expect manufacturers to go considerably further. One of the biggest challenges facing those involved in the garment manufacturing process is to marry the best possible protection with the best possible levels of comfort. Last year, the Australian Capital Territory Fire & Rescue chose to wear kit which incorporates Hainsworth Titan following a successful trial in conjunction with Australian garment manufactur- ing partner Stewart & Heaton. This is a patented double cloth construction with Nomex on the face to provide optimal thermal protection, abrasion resistance and colour fastness, and Kevlar on the back to provide strength.

It is absolutely essential that those involved in the PPE industry demonstrate the ability to work in collaboration. Collaboration is essential because a complete understanding is not held by any indi- vidual fire service or member of the supply chain. For example, a firefighter needs to have an under- Australian Merino wool has a big future in the manufacture of firefighters' kit. An example of this is Hainsworth Eco Dry, a range of lining fabrics incorporating the many benefits of wool to pro- vide today's firefighter with the highest possible standards of comfort when wearing their PPE. The unique structure of wool offers distinct properties not mimicked by any other natural or man-made fibres - properties that offer many benefits to the wearer and that will not wash out or decline over time. Another important considera- tion is value - but the right kind of value. There should be no place in the PPE industry for suppliers hoping to make a quick profit or achieve a short-term gain. Anyone who does go down this route will be found out quickly. Ultimately, it is the companies that take the long-term view, and invest serious time in properly understanding the requirements of our firefighters that will build and sustain the lasting relationships. Value should be about understanding the whole life cost of a product. For example, a product with better durability may cost more at the beginning but over a period of time, it will give far greater value than an inferior product which cost less at the outset. There are a number of reasons why this is the case, not least the fact that garments of greater quality usually last longer. But one of the other trends we have identified is that firefighters themselves are more likely to respect the products they are wearing if the manufacturer has taken the time to engage with them, listen to their particular needs and provide them with PPE that they are proud to wear. Just as firefighters know when they are being given quality garments, they also know when the garments they are being One of the many healthy aspects of the Australia and New Zealand fire market is that the standards for structural and wildland firefighting are driven by the fire services themselves.

Meanwhile, the garment manufacturer needs to understand fit, comfort and the relation- ship between that and protection, while a fabric innovator needs to have an appreciation of all of these requirements as well as an in-depth under- standing of how different fibres react in different environments. The importance of collaboration can be seen in the choice of theme for AFAC 201 3 - Shaping Tomorrow Together. Quality control is another important requirement ensuring that the materials used in manufacturing process are from reputable sources. Interestingly, my own company can trace its connections with Australia back more than 200 years and, for the vast majority of this time, the relationship has been about Hainsworth importing Australian Merino wool for use in our Yorkshire textile mill. The qualities of Merino wool have been known for centuries, not least its ability to regulate temperature to keep you cool when it is hot and warm when you are cold. Now, thanks to advances in textile production and finishing, the many benefits of wool are making a comeback into the world of PPE, but with a modern twist. asked to wear are of an inferior standard. We live in challenging times with the fallout from the global economic crisis still reverberating. Budgets are under scrutiny and fire services everywhere are under intense pressure to find cost savings wherever possible. The challenge facing businesses operating in the PPE industry is to con- tinually demonstrate that the fabrics and products that they are bringing to the market offer value for money - not in the crudest sense of the cheapest in price, but in the more sophisticated sense that they provide long-term value for money. From our own on-going research of the market, relationships with partner organisations and engagement with firefighters in different states, we are confident that criteria such as innovation, quality control, durability, comfort and breathability allied to protection, class leading products and customer care all remain as important as ever in the procurement process. If the industry can maintain these high stan- dards then everyone involved in the development of PPE will know that their collective efforts are doing the most important job of all - protecting individuals working in hazardous environments so they can return home safely to their families. That is a common goal of which we can a ll be proud.

WWW.FIKE.COM + 60 - 3 - 7859-1462 Picture courtesy of Fogtec Ragnar Wighus Bettina McDowell International Water Mist Association water Mist Technology - History, Effectiveness & Efficiency In recent years, water mist technology has \"come of age\" and is now widely regarded as a fire protection solution of choice for a fast expanding catalogue of applications. T he idea behind contemporary water mist tech- nology is by no means new. Over 130 years ago in 1880 the US-American company F.E. Myers manufactured a back-pack system with a lance that produced water droplets that was used to fight small forest fires. Only ten years later Grinnell developed its 'pepper pot' nozzle that fought fires also using small water droplets. By 1930 there were already several companies that had started to get involved in the application of water mist or water fog. Among those was the German company, Lechler, whose main innovation was a multiple orifice nozzle that they, at the time - the 1930s - called water dust nozzle. In the 1940s Factory Mutual's engineering division started to carry out its first tests comprising small droplet nozzles. In spite of these first efforts, the interest in water mist remained meagre over the following decades. Scientists in Europe and the USA were busy with research. But from a commercial point of view the water mist technology initially had no great impact, as it did not meet the requirements for fixed instal- lations back then and was therefore mainly used to fight fires manually. It was not until the 1990s that water mist started to become a force to be reckoned with. This was mainly due to two incidents. Incidents Levelled the Way for water Mist The first was the execution of the Montreal protocol on \"substances that deplete the ozone layer\" in the late 1980s; the second was a fire on the passenger ferry \"Scandinavian Star\" on the morning 7th April 1990. During this fire 158 people - nearly 50 percent of all passengers on board - were killed. Up until the Montreal protocol had been signed, Halon - a bromine-based chemical fire suppression agent - had done a good job as a fire extinguishing media. It was effective, efficient, fairly cheap and easy to install. Its phasing out levelled the way for water mist fire suppression systems, which have consequently become an important field of study, research and development. In areas such as fire protection it often takes severe incidents to bring about changes. The catastrophe on 7th April 1990 eventually led to an improvement of the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) fire safety requirements and installation guidelines as well as the development of fire test procedures for alternative sprinkler systems. There had already been a good deal of develop- ment on high-pressure water mist in Sweden between 1975 and 1990. The main objectives had been systems to protect hotels and passenger ASIA PACIFIC FIRE 27 WATER-BASED SYSTEMS Picture courtesy of VID Fire-Kill Ragnar Wighus is Chairman of the International Water Mist Association. Bettina McDowell is Association Secretary For further information, go to www.iwma.net WATER MIST TECHNOLOGY cabins as well as research into flammable liquid hazards. Thus the fire on the Scandinavian Star allowed those having carried out this work to show their results on 20th June 1990 - just over two months after the disaster. This was the starting point of the newly-founded Swedish company UltraFog. Only six months later another company - Marioff from Finland - also started to develop high-pressure water mist fire fighting systems. Since then many have followed their example. Eight years later - on 4th April 1998 - the International Water Mist Association (IWMA) was founded. Its intention was, and still is, to be a platform for companies, research bodies, institutes, insurance companies, authorities having jurisdiction and individuals involved in water mist technology. With its annual conference - the 13th will be held in Paris on 16th and 17th October this year - the IWMA collects and distributes knowledge. How Does water Mist work? Part of this knowledge is to provide answers to questions like: How does water mist work? How effective is it? How much does it cost? And: How about standards? A fire needs three elements to add up to a fire triangle: a combustible material, heat and oxygen. Unlike traditional sprinkler systems, water mist removes two of these items: heat and oxygen (traditional sprinkler systems only remove the heat). It does so by jetting water at low, medium or high pressure through nozzles specially designed for this purpose. As the system pressure increases the size of the droplets decreases, which results in droplets with an altogether larger surface and water turning into steam. The consequence of this is a system that is able to rapidly reduce the temperature as well as the oxygen at the flame front. In this way, energy is taken away from the fire. Due to its cooling effect, water mist also prevents re-ignition. Low pressure water mist systems work with less than 12.5 bar. The span of medium pressure lies between 12.5 bar and 35 bar and high pressure systems can reach a pressure of up to 120 bar. Each of these systems has its eligibility; low pressure being suited for different purposes than medium or high pressure and vice versa. As less water is needed to control or put out a fire than with a traditional sprinkler system, the water mist technology may be a very cost effective way of providing fire protection. It is also environmentally friendly, causes no ozone depletion, does not con- tribute to global warming, does not cause massive water damage, does not harm people and is reliable. Also as far as standards are concerned, water mist has become well established. The first body to create a standard was the National Fire Protection Association with its NFPA 750 Standard for Water Mist Fire Protection Systems, which was published in 1996. Since then other standards and guidelines for the use of water mist have been developed by FM (FM 5560), the European Committee for Standardization (CEN TS 1497) and others. water Mist in Asia and the Middle East Water mist firefighting systems are well established and have been in use for over twenty years in their present stage of technology. They have proven to provide safety systems over a wide range of applications, such as tunnels, offices, machinery spaces, escalators and computer rooms to name just a few. In some of these applications water mist is favourable due to the way the small water droplets interact with fire. In other situations it is the limited water requirement that makes water mist systems the better choice. The Asian ship building industry is the largest in the world. In the Middle East and Japan building technology is among the most advanced in the world. There are many high-rise buildings with a high concentration of inhabitants, large covered spaces, partly underground. Transporting water from ground level to the top floor is a challenge for traditional water-based firefighting systems, which normally operate at relatively low pressure. On top of that, water in desert environments is precious and its supply costly. The reduced requirements for water supply for water mist systems lead to less water having to be pumped up to the higher levels of high-rise buildings, a smaller required water reservoir and smaller supply lines. Water mist can be applied in oil and gas pro- duction, processing and distribution, particularly protecting buildings storing, using or processing liquid hydrocarbons. In the offshore oil and gas industry, water mist has replaced Halon as extin- guishing systems in many applications. The great advantage of using water mist in these places is the immense cooling effect of small water droplets, which can reduce fire damage to a minimum. Water mist can, in contrast with some gaseous firefighting systems, be released immediately after the detection of a fire, without any hazard to human life. Water mist systems protect life as well as proper- ties. The systems that manufacturers offer - many of these companies are members of the IWMA - fulfil the requirements agreed upon by this organisation. All applications of water mist are based on realistic fire tests, to ensure that the water spray produced by the particular water mist system can suppress or extinguish fires of the type that may actually occur in the specific building or industrial plant. In addition to the advent of less water require- ment, many of the water mist suppliers have worked well with design of nozzles and system components, leading to aesthetically favourable installation with thinner pipes, often made of stain- less steel, and nozzles integrated into the building. To promote water mist, the IWMA organises manufacturers and users of water mist and is the leading factor in paving the way for the correct use of these firefighting systems worldwide. The competitors of the water mist technology have always been, and still are, traditional sprinkler systems and systems using powder or gas to control or extinguish fires. However, in many surroundings, water mist systems are an alternative; sometimes even the better choice. It is therefore important to have a close look at all available systems to choose whatever is best. And given the chance, water mist systems can definitely stand up for themselves.

In this Buyers' Guide we aim to show what is new on the market from the leading brands around the world Ripping Success Graham Collins VentMaster chainsaws from TEMPEST are designed specifically for firefighters and the daunting demands that come with the job. Cutting tools in the fire scene must be able to cut a wide array of materials, often while running full-throttle in extremely harsh conditions such as high heat and thick smoke. These scenarios can destroy a standard chainsaw. Equipped with the Husqvarna Pro X-TORQ 576XT or 365XT power head, VentMaster cobalt guide bar and Raptor carbide chain, VentMaster chainsaws are able to rip their way through everything from car bodies to green trees. The saw's exclusive air filtration design allows it to tackle all of this even while taking in heavy smoke, heat and debris. The X-TORQ power head increases torque up to 20 percent over a wider rpm range for maximum cutting power. The Husqvarna power head features larger dis- placement, the highest fuel economy in its class, higher peak power and far superior ergonomics. An exclusive air-injection, centrifugal force air cleaning system elimi- nates the need for expensive external aftermarket filters. Preliminary air intake cleaning rejects 97 percent of cutting residue and other airborne debris including drywall dust, concrete dust, smoke and even water spray. Cleaner intake air means longer intervals between filter cleanings, longer runs at full power, longer chain life, smoother operation and reduced internal engine wear. Cobalt alloy inserts featured on the end of the guide bar provide fantastic wear, galling, and impact resistance. The proper- ties are retained even at high tempera- tures. The Raptor carbide chain features an \"open dual-raker\" design protecting the cutters and allowing greater cut control. Tough enough to cut through tar, asphalt roofing, nails, sheet metal and wire enforced belting, yet versatile enough to cut trees and green wood. The tool-less KIS-40 depth gauge is fast, simple to install, adjust and remove and eliminates the need to \"roll the rafters\". Accurately control cutting depth protects the operator and performs speed cuts safely. A one step start/stop combines the choke, throttle lock and stop switch, eliminating flooding and allowing fast, convenient starting.

Several alternatives are on the market, including fire blanket systems, calcium silicate board, and flexible mats that absorb heat in the event of a fire. Each has its benefits and refinery operators need to weigh up the pros and cons of the available cable fire protection solutions to ensure that they select one that is the best for a particular application. American Petroleum Industry (API) 2218, Fireproofing Practices in Petroleum and # V Petrochemical Processing Plants, provide guidelines for \" . . . selecting, applying, and main- taining fire proofing materials that are designed to limit the extent of fire-related property loss in the petroleum and petrochemical industries.\" Separating refinery operations into fire zones that can be isolated and safely shut down is a key objective, so if a fire breaks out, the flow of the product being refined does not feed the fire. The API 2218 guidelines include a variety of protective measures, including fireproofing to improve the capacity of equipment and its support structure to maintain their structural integrity during a fire. Shielding essential operating systems when they are exposed to fire is another important measure. To protect the refinery and its components, the standard requires control valves that turn off the flow in the event of a fire, along with control cables that signal when to shut off the fuel. Under the API standards, this control valve and cable must itself be able to withstand a fire, usually for 20 minutes, but in some circumstances for 30 minutes or more. Examples of cable tray systems designed to protect the cables from fire include: • Vendor-certified fireproofed cable tray systems. • Standard cable trays completely enclosed with insulating, fire-resistant fibre mats, or endothermic mats. • Cable trays encased with calcium silicate insulating panels with calcium silicate sleepers to hold cables away from bottom of the cable tray. • Trays with exterior surfaces made of galvanised sheet metal coated with mastic or intumescent fireproofing material.

The method is based on a model of the type of fire that could happen at a refinery; one that gets to 815°C at three minutes, and between 1010°C and 1177°C after five minutes. Testing is carried out in accordance with hydrocarbon pool fire tempera- ture-curve conditions outlined in ASTM E 1529 (50,000 +/-2,500 BTU/ft 2 hr). The test is run at positive pressure over at least half the test assembly. Thermocouples are arranged in sets, with thermocouples peened every 1 50mm on both rails of the cable tray, and every 1 50mm on a bare copper wire centred in the tray. The cable tray is intended to be run empty of cables, which provides approval for zero to 100 percent cable loading. Failure is determined when one \"set\" reaches an average temperature rise of 121°C, or any single thermocouple reaches a temperature rise of 163°C. Options for Meeting Fire Protection Standards A wide range of options are available to protect control valves and grouped electrical cables against extended exposure to fire and maintain control of equipment operated by the cables. One option involves wrapping cable trays and conduits with a non-flammable high temperature resistant insulating blanket. The fire exposure period is rated in proportion to the wrap thickness and the material is typically weatherproofed in the field. For example, the FireMaster 607 blanket is a flexible blanket composed of high temperature fibres classified for applications to 1200°C. The core fibres are manufactured using the Superwool fibre technology, which uses a low bio-persistent insulating wool, reducing the risk for installers. The blanket wrap system consists of a single layer of 50mm material and is designed for up to 300mm cable trays and conduits. The lightweight flexible blanket wrap is easy to cut, reducing installation problems in complex designs. A simple wrap design allows easy re-entry for cable modifications. The insulation is supplied with full encapsulation in a glass fibre reinforced foil and polypropylene (FSP) facing as standard, to provide 38 ASIA PACIFIC FIRE REFINERY CABLE TRAY PROTECTION HIGH HAZARD PROTECTION Clay Booth is Fire Protection Market and Sales Manager at Morgan Thermal Ceramics For further information, go to www.morganthermal ceramics.com superior handling strength for installation. Optional weather and mechanical abuse protection may be added. The FireMaster fire protection system results in significant material cost and labour savings compared with composite products or rigid board installations. It is also lightweight, preventing the need for additional support structures and associated costs. The blanket wrap system has achieved third- party certification through Factory Mutual (FM). Another available option is calcium silicate board, an inorganic, non-combustible high temperature insulation. The material can offer some weather resistance and durability in many environments, but it can be heavy, which together with the cutting and fastening methods required, makes it relatively difficult to install. In addition, while the board itself is relatively inexpensive, the waste from cutting and the additional labour required for cutting and fastening makes it expen- sive to install. It is also less adaptive to complex cable tray runs. A third option is an endothermic mat (e-mat), which protects structural steel, cable trays, and conduit circuits by chemically absorbing heat energy, blocking heat penetration. The product requires the installation of between three and five layers, resulting in increased weight and material costs - up to five to ten times higher than insulation or board alternatives. These multilayer solutions also have additional labour costs. On the plus side, flexible mat solutions are not as insulat- ing, so they can often be used to protect power cables, which generate heat. The other options discussed are more appropriate for use to protect control cables, which do not generate a significant amount of heat. The intent of petroleum industry standards is to separate refinery fire zones by enough distance so that if a fire breaks out, it is possible to turn off the flow of chemicals, oil, or gas to the affected area so the fire does not feed itself. In that scenario, the cables and valves controlling the shut- off valves must be adequately protected. When selecting the most appropriate options to maintain control over these components, be sure to evaluate the total material costs, labour and instal- lation costs, durability under the particular facility's location, and any associated differences in long term maintenance and replacement costs.
