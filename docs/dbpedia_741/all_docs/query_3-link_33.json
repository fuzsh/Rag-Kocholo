        "text": "(AUS) Queensland bikie cops accused of overreacting\n\nQueensland police's anti-bikie squad has been accused of overreacting after a former gang member's house was raided and he was arrested over a drug driving offence.\n\nThe 41-year-old man and two younger men were arrested on Tuesday after police from task force Maxima allegedly found an SKS semi-automatic rifle, ammunition and methamphetamines at the Northgate address in Brisbane's north.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, police alleged Scott Robert Paton was a member of the motorcycle gang Highway 61 and said he had been charged with possessing ammunition and failing to appear in court.\n\nHowever, when Paton faced the Brisbane Magistrates Court, the ammunitions charge had vanished and there was no mention of his gang association.\n\nPaton's lawyer Debbie Kilroy said her client quit the bikie gang some time ago, and he'd been charged with failing to show up in court over a drug driving offence.\n\nMs Kilroy told the court Paton claims never to have received the notice to appear in June following a roadside swab that allegedly tested positive for amphetamines.\n\nHe was released on bail after his case was adjourned until January 30.\n\nOutside court, Ms Kilroy said police were reacting to a public fear of bikies that was being whipped up by news reports.\n\n\"When we see men being charged for minor offences or fail to appear warrants that are not doing anything wrong, and when 10, 12 taskforce Maxima (officers) come at them with guns, that's a pretty scary event, not just for my client but for those in the community that witness that,\" she told reporters.\n\nA 23-year-old man charged with possessing a weapon and drugs had his case adjourned until Thursday, while a 28-year-old man who was charged with drug possession is due to appear in court next month.\n\nhttp://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/queensland-bikie-cops-accused-of-overreacting-20131120-2xv2k.html#ixzz2lEzgHirc\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n(USA) Dothan police captain lost job over association with an outlaw motorcycle gxxg\n\nDOTHAN, Alabama -- A Dothan police captain was terminated after the department learned he was a known associate of an outlaw motorcycle gang.\n\nThe Dothan Eagle is reporting former captain Keith Gray’s name surfaced as part of an assault investigation involving the Outcast motorcycle club.\n\nDothan Police Chief Gregory Benton testified at an appeal hearing of Gray’s termination that an internal inquiry was started out of a concern of the criminal activity in the gang, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe former captain who worked for the department for nearly 30 years is not accused of criminal activity.\n\nGray is contesting his termination and in his hearing Tuesday said he didn’t think about the motorcycle group being involved in criminal activity. He wasn’t at the club house when an assault occurred there that sparked the police investigation.\n\nDothan officials also said Gray’s grounds for termination also included the viewing of a pornographic website with his work cell phone and using departmental computer programs for personal use.\n\nhttp://blog.al.com/montgomery/2013/11/dothan_police_captain_lost_job.html\n\n↧\n\n(USA) Chief says he ordered inquiry as part of assault investigation\n\nDothan’s police chief said he ordered an internal inquiry into a former police captain after his name surfaced as part of an assault investigation involving a local motorcycle club.\n\nChief Gregory Benton said former police captain Keith Gray’s name was one of two that surfaced as part of an investigation into an assault.\n\nBenton testified Tuesday during an appeal hearing of Gray's termination from the department held in front of the Dothan City Personnel Board. Benton said Gray’s name came up as a known associate of the outlaw motorcycle gang called Outcast.\n\n“It’s a concern because of the criminal element of a one percent (outlaw) motorcycle gang,” Benton said. “It looks very bad that he associates with known felons. It could very well affect our working relationship with the public.”\n\nBenton did not order an internal inquiry into the second officer mentioned because he was told the officer was no longer a part of the motorcycle club.\n\nAs part of the city’s evidence for the termination , City Attorney Len White played a video of Dothan police officers telling one of the assault suspects he could 'take care' of the pending charge against him if he gave them the name or names of police officers possibly associated with an outlaw motorcycle gang.\n\nWhite told the personnel board Gray’s termination stemmed from his direct association with a known outlaw motorcycle gang.\n\n“We are not alleging and never have alleged he has committed a crime,” White said. “He had knowledge he was directly associated with an outlaw motorcycle gang.”\n\nGray said he received a blessing from the Outcast Motorcycle Club because motorcycle clubs are often territorial.\n\n“I went to Bessemer to talk with a person who is a member of Outcast,” Gray said. “I never thought about his club being engaged in criminal activity.”\n\nGray is contesting his termination with the assistance of Birmingham attorney Sonya Edwards.\n\nThe hearing started with Delvick McKay, the city’s personnel director, outlining the city’s grounds for terminating Gray. Gray was fired a couple of months ago from the department after serving nearly 30 years.\n\nMcKay read the grounds for termination, which included conduct unbecoming of an officer, membership of organizations, electronic messaging, truthfulness and a code of ethics violation dubbed ‘private life.’\n\nMcKay said the charges stemmed from police responding to an assault call at the “Outcast Motorcycle Club” located at 414 N. Appletree St. in late August. Police charged eight men with felony assault from a fight at the clubhouse that night.\n\nBenton said Gray was not at the clubhouse on the night of the assault.\n\nMcKay said the grounds for Gray’s termination also involved the inappropriate viewing of a pornographic website with the department - issued cell phone, along with using departmental computer programs for personal use.\n\nPersonnel Board member Earl Tyson asked Gray if he knew any of the eight suspects arrested from the nightclub fight. Gray said he knew four of the men because of their involvement in motorcycle clubs, particularly ones prior to their joining the Outcast club.\n\nTestimony\n\nDuring his testimony Gray said he never knew the Outcast Motorcycle Club was labeled an outlaw motorcycle gang by the FBI until his interrogation by internal affairs officers.\n\n“My club is not Outcast,” Gray said. “My club is Bama Boys Motorcycle Club Inc.”\n\nWhite showed a picture of Gray shaking hands with the president of the Outcast Motorcycle Club, an outlaw motorcycle gang in Alabama. Gray acknowledged he received that man’s blessing to start a club, Bama Boys, in Anniston.\n\nPersonnel Board Chairperson Barbara Spann asked Gray to explain the difference between an outlaw motorcycle club (OMC) and others. Gray said OMCs are often territorial and are supposed to be the “rough of the rough.”\n\n“They’re bikers. You avoid those people and you have your own life,” Gray said. “My club does charities and has given away toys at Walton Park.”\n\nGray also said women are not allowed to be members of an OMC, but he has several women who are members of his motorcycle club.\n\nTyson asked Gray about the difference between the veteran patriotic motorcycle groups and his motorcycle club. Gray said he didn’t know about their bylaws.\n\nBoard member Tim Shirley questioned why a blessing was needed. Gray said he got the blessing because some motorcycle clubs can be territorial.\n\n“I have not had criminal activity involved in my club,” Gray said. “I wanted to start a chapter of Bama Boys, and didn’t want any trouble out of these guys.”\n\nGray said he’s only had minimal contact with Outcast by asking to coexist with them in Alabama.\n\n“We did the minimum thing we needed to do to make sure our guys in Anniston and Dothan were safe,” Gray said.\n\nWhite questioned whether Gray had to get a blessing from the Patriot Guard motorcycle group.\n\n“My club is fine because we extended a courtesy, and that’s what we do in biking,” Gray said.\n\nGray denied ever viewing or accessing pornography on his department-issued cell phone.\n\n“I feel like someone set me up,” Gray said.\n\nJoseph Thompson, an analyst for the FBI, testified during the hearing that outlaw motorcycle gangs constitute a threat in Alabama.\n\nThompson also said the Bama Boys Motorcycle Club was not considered an outlaw motorcycle club.\n\nHowever, White claims the Bama Boys serve as a support club for Outcast.\n\nGray’s attorney claims the case is just a witch hunt and asked for Gray to be reinstated to his position with back pay.\n\nhttp://www.dothaneagle.com/news/article_e8a8ba0c-5180-11e3-9876-0019bb30f31a.html\n\n↧\n\n(AUS) Outlaw bikie Shane Bowden nowhere to be seen as Special Operations Group raid warehouse\n\nNOTORIOUSLY violent interstate outlaw bikie Shane Bowden is believed to have moved to Victoria.\n\nThe former senior Queensland-based Fink is understood to have joined forces with the newly formed Mongols.\n\nDetectives from the anti-bikie Taskforce Echo and Special Operations Group officers raided a property, where Bowden was thought to be living, in Nott St, Port Melbourne, about 6am yesterday.\n\nWitnesses told the Herald Sun heavily armed police surrounded a warehouse and repeatedly called out on a megaphone: \"Shane Bowden, come out with your hands up\".\n\nBut the bikie was nowhere in sight.\n\nPolice had a warrant to search the property and intelligence suggesting Bowden was living in a mezzanine area above the workshop.\n\nThe raid came as Queensland continued its crackdown on bikies with tough new legislation aimed to drive outlaw motorcycle gangs out of the state.\n\nBowden, 41, has an extensive criminal history and was only released last year after almost seven years behind bars for his involvement in one of the nation's most brutal, all-in bloody brawls.\n\nDubbed the \"Ballroom Blitz\", the showdown saw Bowden shoot Melbourne killer bikie Wayne Hudson, a former Finks member, as payback for defecting to the Hells Angels.\n\nAt the time, he had been on parole for drug trafficking and property offences.\n\nHe had also been convicted of assaulting a woman outside a nightclub in 1998.\n\nBowden, declared by a judge as a serious violent offender, was a key figure in the Finks and of its \"Terror Team\" whose motto is \"violence with attitude\".\n\nBut he is understood to be part of a national \"patch-over\" of the Finks to the Mongols.\n\nHe has even reportedly removed his Finks tattoos from his arms and back.\n\nPolice sources say there is no search for Bowden, who is not wanted over any crimes.\n\nVictorian Mongol MC president Frank Dieni said the raided premises was not linked to the club.\n\nHe said one of its members, not Bowden, had rented out a room at the warehouse temporarily.\n\n\"It's not owned by us,\" Mr Dieni said.\n\n\"It's not our clubhouse. It's not our premises. It's got nothing to do with us.\"\n\nHe could not confirm whether Bowden had been staying at the warehouse.\n\nBut he said Bowden was not a member of his chapter.\n\nIn the United States, the Mongols are the sworn enemy of the Hells Angels.\n\nThere are fears their move into Melbourne could ignite outlaw bikie tensions to flashpoint.\n\nhttp://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/outlaw-bikie-shane-bowden-nowhere-to-be-seen-as-special-operations-group-raid-warehouse/story-fni0fee2-1226766390278\n\n↧\n\n(AUS) Bikie

Strike Force Raptor Highway Patrol were patrolling Kurrajong Avenue, Mount Druitt on Sunday when they observed a vehicle conducting a large burnout.\n\nChecks on the driver revealed his licence was suspended until 2014 and an inspection of the car showed its registration had expired in 2004 and it was carrying an altered front registration plate.\n\nThe burnout had caused a rear tyre to burst and the rear bumper to come off the vehicle.\n\nThe man, 24, was issued a court attendance notice for multiple traffic offences.\n\nHe will appear in Mount Druitt Local Court on December 19.\n\nStrike Force Raptor was established by State Crime Command’s Gangs Squad in 2009.\n\nIt is a proactive and high-impact operation targeting outlaw motorcycle gangs and any associated criminal

before allegedly threatening to kill a woman's dog and family, and bomb her home, will face a Brisbane bail hearing in line with new anti-bikie laws.\n\nBrenton David Jones, 28 of Emerald, was staying with his parents at Buderim last Thursday when he heard a woman outside arguing with his mother, which triggered an angry outburst.\n\nMaroochydore Magistrates Court heard Jones allegedly told the woman, \"No f****** police will come to my f****** home: I'm a Rebel.\n\n\"I'm going to kill your dog, I'm going to bomb your family home and kill your whole family.\"\n\nDuring police questioning, Mr Jones argued that apart from threatening to smash the woman's phone, he did not make any threats.\n\nHe also said he never claimed to be a Rebel, although Police Prosecutor Senior Sergeant Dave Bradley told the court Mr Jones's address suggested otherwise.\n\n\"He said he did not associate with anyone who was a Rebel ... police checked his address and it was the address for the Central Highlands chapter of the Rebels (in Emerald),\" Snr Sgt Bradley said.\n\nHe argued that the prevalence of bikies in recent media meant the claim to be a Rebel was \"aggravating\".\n\n\"This (behaviour) is so prevalent that the legislature have gone to great lengths to bring it into line,\" Snr Sgt Bradley said.\n\nMr Jones's alleged victim told police she had been unable to sleep since the incident in fear of a Rebels visit to her house.\n\nMr Jones had initially pleaded guilty to one charge of \"threatening violence\", but Magistrate Barry Barrett later asked that the wording be modified to include the various threats.\n\nHe then changed his plea to not guilty, forcing the matter into a bail hearing in Brisbane Magistrates Court tomorrow, in line with anti-bikie laws.\n\nhttp://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/alleged-bikie-alters-plea/2095555/\n\n↧\n\n(AUS) Stand up for our freedom\n\nTHE concerns of ordinary citizens of Queensland impacted by the political campaign to rid Queensland of 'criminal bikie gangs' rushed through Parliament without any consolation of any foundation has led to people's civil liberties being violated.\n\nThe media scaremongering directed by Government to gain support of the general public is leading to a 'Controlled institutionalized society'.\n\nWhat ever happen to the responsible journalism reporting?\n\nThe main media is not reporting the true implications of affected ordinary citizen which have contacted them of the actually true situations happening!!!\n\nJack Dempsey MP, stated on ABC radio that there were 21 Rebels arrested for a list of crimes from the Gold Coast to Townsville when there were only two arrested in Brisbane?\n\nThen there is the 16 arrested on the Sunshine Coast, why did he fail to tell the public that there was only one of the 16 charged, and none were actually Rebels?\n\nAgain media scaremongering, let the truth be heard.\n\nAt the Maroochydore Courthouse on Wednesday 13th November involving two witnesses in a case of Rebels MC Sunshine Coast Inc were told they were to leave the court or be arrested even when told they were there to give evidence.\n\nA police officer told them he did not care and that they were breaking the law, denying the Incorporation the right to present its witnesses to the court, thus perverting the course of justice. I simply illustrate this for the lies & deception to the public.\n\nTuesday, 19th November, workers, unionists, lawyers, environmentalists, civil libertarians, community groups along with motorcyclist which whom I am one, attended a protest rally at Parliament House to voice our objections to Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie's new 'VLAD' laws.\n\nThere are so many new laws introduced & amended by this Government that the ordinary Queenslander is unaware of that will affect them or a family member at one point in time, need to be made aware.\n\nI wish to address my concerns regarding motorcyclist of which I have been for fifty years & am not associated with any \"OMC\" and any person whether a \"bikie\" or an ordinary citizen that do wrong are punished for any crimes that they commit, but through the correct judicial process, not Jarrod Bleijie, now Judge, Jury & Executioner, whereas Judges & even amnesty international have condemned the new laws.\n\nThese new laws do not pertain to motorcyclist & can be applied to any situation whereas more than two in a group are able to be detained on suspicion; these laws are already being applied in other circumstances, taking away our fundamental rules of natural justice & our freedom of association.\n\nThis law were portrayed to use against \"OMC' which are less than 1% of the community yet affecting 60% or more of the law abiding public.\n\nI wish to display a couple of examples of how these laws are being implemented:\n\nCampbell Newman quoted \"some innocent riders may be inconvenienced\", & offers no apology.\n\n• In Townsville, police \"harassed\" 14 motorcycle riders escorting the hearse from the funeral parlour to the cemetery of a 70-year-old woman who died of cancer even after they had informed the police prior & they were elderly folk not wearing jackets or patches\n\n• At an Ipswich funeral, police interrupted to photograph the riders attending to honour the deceased wife of a club member, not \"OMC'.\n\n• Any motorcyclist attending a 'Charity Toy Run' is having their information collected from the organization & recorded by the police.\n\nWhere is the dignity or compassion as these are ordinary citizens of all life styles who simple ride a motorcycle?

During his last court appearance, he complained he hadn’t been able to see much of the evidence against him, an allegation dismissed by the Crown.\n\nPerras said getting evidence was complicated – the information includes “sensitive materials,” some of which was blacked out by police. He said it’s normal, given the type of information in the file.\n\n“Certain passages don’t make sense because a great part of it is redacted,” Perras said. “We’re working on getting full disclosure. Eventually we will.”\n\nA number of details have been reported in the media. On Monday, Radio-Canada said it had obtained excerpts of recorded conversations between Roberge and the late biker he’s been linked to – Rene Charlebois.\n\nThe report indicated that Charlebois was ultimately interested in sabotaging ongoing criminal cases against the Hells Angels and sought information about an informant key to a number of criminal trials.\n\nCharlebois committed suicide earlier this year after being on the lam from a minimum-security prison and being the subject of a two-week manhunt.\n\n“A lot of things have appeared in the media that seemed to be more comprehensive than what I received as disclosure,” Perras said, without verifying the information. “How the media got it remains a mystery.”\n\nReports say Roberge received as much as $500,000 in exchange for information.\n\nRoberge has requested a trial by judge and jury but Perras acknowledged it is still several months away.\n\nhttp://globalnews.ca/news/1023381/ex-montreal-cop-charged-with-selling-secrets-to-bikers-to-seek-bail/\n\n↧\n\n(AUS) Alleged Rebels' families hoping for Christmas bail\n\nALLEGED Rebel bikie's wife Tracey Carew rolled up her sleeves last night and stepped behind the counter of a takeaway food outlet.\n\nIt was something she had never had to do before, but she did it to ensure two of the local men in custody for having a beer together with friends at the Yandina Hotel did not lose their livelihoods altogether.\n\n\"I don't know all the ins and outs of it, but someone has to do it,\" said Mrs Carew, the wife of Joshua Carew, 30, of Yandina Creek, one of the five men detained.\n\n\"We don't have a choice.\"\n\nMrs Carew and the other wives and partners have been left wondering if those arrested early on Tuesday will be released on bail before Christmas.\n\nThe other four are Steven Michael Smith, 28, of Yandina, his brother Scott Michael Conley, 36, of Yandina, long-time friend Dan Whale, 26, of Yandina, also known among his friends as Dan Black, and Paul Jeffery Lansdowne, 57, of Eerwah Vale.\n\nThe men, who police allege are Rebel bikies or club associates, have been identified in CCTV footage as associating together in a public place on November 1 - a crime attracting a six-month jail term under the Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment (VLAD) laws.\n\nThe men did not apply for bail when the matter was mentioned briefly in the Brisbane Magistrates Court yesterday.\n\nThey will reappear in court next Wednesday.\n\n\"They're hoping to come up to court one week before Christmas,\" Mrs Carew said.\n\n\"If they don't come home then, they won't be coming home for Christmas.\n\n\"It's devastating.
