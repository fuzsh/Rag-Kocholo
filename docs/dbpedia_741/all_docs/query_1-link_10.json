        "text": "The Colorado Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday in a closely watched case about whether the US Constitution’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office applies to former President Donald Trump because of the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot.\n\nThe seven-member court appeared divided at times, pushing back on arguments from both Trump and the challengers who want to remove him from Colorado’s presidential ballot in 2024. The justices didn’t say when they will issue their decision, which is expected to be appealed to the US Supreme Court, no matter which way they rule.\n\nWith support from bipartisan legal scholars, liberal groups filed lawsuits across the country to enforce the 14th Amendment’s insurrectionist ban. A new suit was filed Wednesday in Oregon during the Colorado hearing. But so far, these cases have fallen flat, keeping Trump on the ballot in Minnesota, Arizona, Michigan and elsewhere.\n\nThe Colorado justices grappled with a key question: Does the ban apply to presidents?\n\nThey are reviewing a ruling from Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace, who presided over a bench trial last month, and concluded that Trump “engaged in an insurrection” on January 6, 2021. However, she also ruled that the 14th Amendment’s disqualification clause doesn’t apply to Trump because the provision doesn’t mention the presidency.\n\n“If it was so important that the president be included, I come back to the question, why not spell it out?” Justice Carlos Samour asked a lawyer for the challengers. “Why not include president and vice president? … They spelled out senator or representative.”\n\nTwo other justices pointed out that other provisions of the Constitution don’t appear to include the president when they refer to federal officers, pushing back on a key pillar of the challengers’ case. The challengers claimed the disqualification clause covers the presidency because it bans insurrectionists from “any office … under the United States.”\n\nBut later, when questioning Trump lawyer Scott Gessler, some justices said it wouldn’t make sense for there to be a loophole allowing insurrectionists to become president.\n\n“I saw no rational reason for that type of an exclusion,” Justice Monica Marquez said.\n\nSeveral of the justices also hammered Gessler over his contention that January 6 was only a riot and wasn’t an insurrection. The 14th Amendment doesn’t define insurrection, and the justices are now reviewing the trial judge’s decision that January 6 fit the bill.\n\nRead more about today’s ruling here.\n\nTrump lawyer Scott Gessler said “the violence on the Capitol was not acceptable,” but argued that January 6, 2021, didn’t rise to the level of an insurrection as contemplated by the 14th Amendment.\n\nA violent event that only lasts for several hours and is restricted to just one building – a reference to the attack on the US Capitol on January 6 — is not an insurrection, Gessler argued.\n\n“The use of force did not involve arms, certainly not the level of arms necessary to overcome” the police, Gessler said.\n\nThat comment drew a rebuke from Justice William Hood, who said, “there were a lot of makeshift weapons that did a lot of damage,” and pointed out that approximately 170 police officers were injured.\n\nDebating the definition of an “insurrection” is important because the 14th Amendment says officeholders who “engaged in insurrection” are disqualified from public service – but the provision doesn’t define insurrection.\n\nOne of the Colorado justices suggested that it might be smart to settle the question of former President Donald Trump’s eligibility under the 14th Amendment sooner rather than later.\n\nThe 14th Amendment’s insurrectionist ban has only been applied twice outside of the context of the Civil War, and has never been implicated in a presidential race. There is not a legal consensus on whether the right time to challenge Trump’s eligibility is before the GOP primaries that begin in January 2024, before the general election in November 2024, or before his potential inauguration in 2025.\n\n“One of the counter-arguments is that by failing to resolve this issue on the merits now, we create the potential for chaos in January of 2025,” Justice William Hood told Trump lawyer Scott Gessler.\n\nHood also said he didn’t agree with Gessler’s argument that kicking Trump off one state’s ballot would lead to “chaos” across the country. Hood pointed out that if the Colorado Supreme Court reverses the lower-court ruling, and removes Trump from the state’s primary ballot, the US Supreme Court will likely take up the case and make a decision that settles the issue for the entire country.\n\nIn another potentially promising sign for former President Donald Trump, one of the Colorado justices signaled that he thinks the trial court defined “insurrection” too broadly.\n\nTrump argued that the trial judge got it wrong and improperly labeled January 6, 2021, as an “insurrection” – and asked the state supreme court to overturn that finding.\n\nHere is what District Judge Sarah Wallace concluded about the definition of insurrection: “An insurrection as used in Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment is (1) a public use of force or threat of force (2) by a group of people (3) to hinder or prevent execution of the Constitution of the United States.”\n\nJustice Carlos Samour said Wednesday, “I’m expressing a concern about the definition of insurrection that the district court adopted. It strikes me as somewhat or potentially overbroad.”\n\nAn attorney for the challengers, Eric Olson, argued that Wallace had the right definition. In response to Samour’s questions, Olson emphasized that private threats from individuals wouldn’t rise to the level of an insurrection – but that January 6 was a very public incident with hopes of undermining the national democracy.\n\nSeveral of the Colorado justices posed tough questions to the anti-Trump challengers and zeroed in on the vagueness in the 14th Amendment, which doesn’t explicitly prohibit insurrectionists from serving as president, even though it specifies that insurrectionists can’t be senators or state officials.\n\nJustice Melissa Hart said, “nowhere in any of the references to officer, does the Constitution list the president.”\n\nJustice Monica Marquez pointed to other provisions of the Constitution that refer to “officers” without including the presidency.\n\nThese comments suggest that a fair number of the justices may be inclined to uphold the lower court’s ruling, that the insurrectionist ban doesn’t apply to the presidency and therefore can’t be used to disqualify former President Donald Trump from the 2024 race.\n\nThe lower court ruled on narrow grounds that Trump should remain on Colorado’s ballot because the ban apparently doesn’t apply to presidents. The provision says, “no person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State,” if they took an oath to “support” the Constitution and then engaged in insurrection. But it doesn’t say anything specific about the presidency.\n\nOral arguments started Wednesday at the Colorado Supreme Court in a closely watched case about whether the US Constitution’s ban on insurrectionists from holding office applies to former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe hearing opened up with arguments from Jason Murray, who is a lawyer for the anti-Trump challengers who want to disqualify him from office.\n\nAfter a weeklong bench trial last month, Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace ruled that Trump “engaged in an insurrection” on January 6, 2021. But she concluded that the insurrectionist ban doesn’t apply to the presidency, based on the text of the post-Civil War constitutional amendment.\n\nThe 14th Amendment says officials who take an oath to support the Constitution are disqualified from office if they “engaged in insurrection.” It explicitly prohibits them from serving as senators, representatives and other offices – but it doesn’t mention the presidency.\n\nThe anti-Trump challengers appealed Wallace’s conclusion that the ban doesn’t apply to the presidency. Trump appealed many of the other findings in Wallace’s stunning 102-page ruling. Both sides will present arguments at Wednesday’s two-hour hearing.\n\nThis is one of several 14th Amendment challenges against Trump’s candidacy, which so far have failed to remove him from a single ballot. Legal experts from both sides expect that one of these cases will ultimately reach the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court is hearing the 14th Amendment challenge to former President Donald Trump’s candidacy Wednesday afternoon.\n\nTrump’s team and the group trying to remove him from the Colorado ballot based on the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” appealed different parts of the lower-court ruling, which found that Trump “engaged in an insurrection” on January 6, 2021, but that the ban doesn’t apply to the presidency.\n\nMany experts believe the case, which was brought by Republican and independent voters in coordination with a liberal-leaning watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, will eventually reach the US Supreme Court in some fashion.\n\nColorado District Court Judge Sarah Wallace issued a stunning 102-page decision last month, that found Trump “engaged in an insurrection” on January 6, 2021, but concluded that the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” doesn’t apply to presidents, based on the text of the amendment, which was ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War.\n\nIt says American officials who take an oath to support the Constitution are banned from future office if they “engaged in insurrection.” The provision explicitly bans insurrectionists from serving as US senators, representatives and even presidential electors – but it does not say anything about the presidency. It says it covers “any office, civil or military, under the United States,” and Wallace ruled that this does not include the office of the presidency.\n\nThat key finding is what the anti-Trump challengers hope the Colorado Supreme Court will overturn.\n\nAll seven justices on the Colorado Supreme Court were appointed by Democratic governors. Six of the seven subsequently won statewide retention elections to stay on the bench. The seventh was only appointed in 2021 and hasn’t faced voters yet.\n\nSean Grimsley, an attorney for the anti-Trump challengers, told CNN’s Erin Burnett that he was “hopeful” his appeal will prevail in overturning the “one issue” that the judge “got wrong” about who the ban does – and doesn’t – apply to.\n\nTrump also has appealed the decision, taking issue with several of the judge’s findings, including that he “engaged” in the January 6 insurrection. Trump’s lawyers say Wallace reached the “correct” conclusion that the insurrectionist ban doesn’t apply to presidents.\n\nThe lawyers said in a court filing that they want these matters corrected now because of the possibility of “further review” in the case, referring to the widely expected eventual appeals to the Supreme Court.\n\nA Colorado judge ruled last month that former President Donald Trump “engaged in an insurrection” on January 6, 2021, but rejected an attempt to remove him from the state’s 2024 primary ballot, finding that the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” doesn’t apply to presidents.\n\nThe provision explicitly bans insurrectionists from serving as US senators, representatives, and even presidential l electors – but it does not say anything about presidents. It says it covers “any office, civil or military, under the United States,” and Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace ruled that this does not include the office of the presidency.\n\n“After considering the arguments on both sides, the Court is persuaded that ‘officers of the United States,’ did not include the President of the United States,” she wrote. “It appears to the Court that for whatever reason the drafters of Section Three did not intend to include a person who had only taken the Presidential Oath.”\n\nThe major decision issued by Wallace came after judges in Minnesota and Michigan also refused to remove Trump from that state’s Republican primary ballots. Legal scholars believe these cases will, in some form, end up at the US Supreme Court. But before that, the GOP and independent voters who filed the Colorado lawsuit in coordination with a liberal watchdog group, appealed to the Colorado Supreme Court.\n\nThese three high-profile challenges against Trump, which had the backing of well-funded advocacy groups, have so far failed to remove him from a single ballot, with the 2024 primary season fast approaching.\n\nHowever, the 102-page ruling in Colorado offered a searing condemnation of Trump’s conduct, labeling him as an insurrectionist who “actively primed the anger of his extremist supporters,” and “acted with the specific intent to incite political violence and direct it at the Capitol.”\n\nWallace concluded that “Trump engaged in an insurrection on January 6, 2021 through incitement, and that the First Amendment does not protect Trump’s speech” at the Ellipse that day. She also found that Trump “acted with the specific intent to disrupt the Electoral College certification of President Biden’s electoral victory through unlawful means.”\n\nThe case against former President Donald Trump in Colorado revolved around his history of stoking political unrest, his public call for supporters to flock to Washington, DC, for a “wild” protest on January 6, and his instruction that they march to the Capitol and “fight like hell” to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s victory.\n\nIn the eyes of the challengers, these actions clearly rose to the level of “engaging in insurrection” against the US Constitution – which is the bar for disqualification set by Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe weeklong bench trial in November featured firsthand accounts from US Capitol Police officers who were wounded fending off the pro-Trump mob on January 6, video clips of Trump’s incendiary speech before the riot and testimony from an expert on right-wing extremism who said far-right brawler groups like the Proud Boys interpreted Trump’s words as “a call to violence.”\n\nAn attorney for the challengers, Sean Grimsley, said at closing arguments that “the Constitution does not allow” Trump to return to office, no matter his standing in the polls.\n\nTrump’s lawyers called witnesses who said his team tried to avoid violence that day and that he had authorized National Guard troops to keep DC safe on January 6.\n\nEven before the trial, they unsuccessfully argued that the case should be thrown out because the allegations against Trump were largely based on his speech before the riot, which they claimed was protected by the First Amendment and did not meet the legal standard for inciting violence.\n\nThe trial was also a history lesson in the Civil War, the tumultuous Reconstruction era, the congressional debate over drafting and ratifying the 14th Amendment, and the application of its insurrectionist ban.\n\nIndiana University law professor Gerard Magliocca, perhaps the nation’s top scholar on the provision, testified in favor of removing Trump from the ballot. He explained how thousands of former Confederates were disqualified from office, including some who never took up arms, even one congressman-elect who had only written a letter-to-the-editor advocating violence against Union troops.\n\nIn some ways, the trial in Colorado that looked at whether the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” disqualifies Donald Trump from serving as president again because of his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection served as a preview of the much higher-profile federal election subversion trial against Trump that is slated for March.\n\nIn that criminal case, Trump wasn’t charged with inciting the riot, or with insurrection. But the indictment from special counsel Jack Smith quotes from Trump’s January 6 speech and describes how he fueled the violence. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThis was a major part of the Colorado case, and federal prosecutors might similarly seek to feature testimony from police officers and lawmakers who can describe how Trump’s actions obstructed the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nTrump’s defense in Colorado relied heavily on January 6 revisionism and featured testimony from an unrepentant US Capitol rioter and others who still maintain the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nIn terms of trial strategy, these witnesses could undercut the challengers’ argument that January 6 was an insurrection. The 14th Amendment doesn’t actually define the term.\n\nOne of the January 6 rally organizers, Amy Kremer, testified in the Colorado case that the crowd at the Ellipse was full of “patriotic, freedom-loving citizens” who were “joyful, singing and dancing,” including after Trump wrapped his remarks. After her testimony, Kremer posted online a photo of the overrun Capitol and said, “The 2020 Election was stolen!”\n\nTrump’s lawyers say this showed that his words didn’t incite violence, a core element of his defense. Plenty of rallygoers ignored Trump’s call to go to the Capitol. Many who did march there stayed peaceful. But thousands participated in a violent riot, as highlighted earlier in the trial by two of the 140 police officers who were wounded in the melee.\n\nOne rioter, Tom Bjorklund, testified for Trump’s defense and admitted on the stand that he breached Capitol grounds, though he said he never entered the building. Bjorklund, now the Colorado GOP treasurer, hasn’t been charged with any crimes and testified that he didn’t engage in violence at the Capitol.\n\n“It’s kind of an insult to insurrectionists around the world,” Bjorklund said. “Because Republicans just mad about an election hardly rises to the level of an insurrection.”\n\nA Colorado judge on November 17 issued a stunning ruling that fell just short of removing Donald Trump from the state’s 2024 ballot based on the 14th Amendment’s insurrectionist ban. The 102-page decision was a win for Trump, but it read more like a condemnation.\n\nNonetheless, it’s the latest legal victory for the GOP frontrunner, who has now defended his spot on the ballot in several key states, including Michigan and Minnesota, though appeals are underway.\n\nNow the Colorado Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments Wednesday on appeals to the November ruling.\n\nThe 14th Amendment, ratified after the Civil War, says officials who take an oath to support the Constitution are banned from future office if they “engaged in insurrection.” But the Constitution doesn’t say how to enforce the ban, and it has only been applied twice since 1919 – which is why many experts view these lawsuits as long shots.\n\nLegal experts believe the Supreme Court will be asked to weigh in, one way or another, before the 2024 primaries begin.\n\nThe Colorado ruling isn’t binding on other courts, but it’s the most comprehensive fact-finding to date by a judge about Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election. And it could factor into future challenges that are brought for the general election or even to block Trump from taking office if he wins next November.\n\nHere are some takeaways from the major ruling in Colorado:\n\nTrump engaged in insurrection, judge says Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace concluded – based on testimony of US Capitol Police officers, lawmakers, clips from Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech and expert testimony about right-wing extremism – that Trump engaged in the January 6 insurrection.\n\nThis was a major legal hurdle that the challengers were able to overcome. And it’s the first time that any court in the country has ruled that Trump engaged in the insurrection, a watershed moment in the quest for accountability for January 6.\n\nWallace determined that Trump “actively primed the anger of his extremist supporters” and “acted with the specific intent to incite political violence and direct it at the Capitol.”\n\nShe also found that Trump “acted with the specific intent to disrupt the Electoral College certification of President Biden’s electoral victory through unlawful means.”\n\nWhile this lawsuit is not a criminal case, it is a highly notable finding. It aligns closely with the federal criminal charges filed by special counsel Jack Smith, who accused Trump of illegally obstructing the Electoral College proceedings.\n\nIt’s unclear how this could impact the criminal case. But very few judges in the country have examined Trump’s post-election conduct as closely as Wallace has in this litigation.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here."
