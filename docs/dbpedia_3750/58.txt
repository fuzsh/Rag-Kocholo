Robert Lowry was born in Philadelphia on March 12, 1826. He graduated from Bucknell University and became a Baptist minister. In 1868, he

became editor of the Sunday School hymn books, having succeeded William B. Bradbury.

In 1874, Lowry was pondering the Easter story. One evening he read the passage in Luke 24 that says “he is not here, he is risen,” during his devotional time. According the hymnologist Kenneth Osbeck, “Soon Robert Lowry found himself seated at the little pump organ in the parlor of his home. And in a very spontaneous fashion, the words and music of “Christ Arose” gave expression to the thoughts that had been uppermost in his mind. The hymn was published the following year and has been an inspirational favorite with God’s people ever since.”

Lowry wrote over 500 hymns and edited over twenty hymnals in his lifetime. Some of his hymns include Shall We Gather at the River, We’re Marching to Zion, All the Way the Saviour Leads Me, and I Need Thee Every Hour.

He died on November 25, 1899 in Plainfield, N. J.

Welcome to my virtual home. My goal is to help women who are hurting to discover there is hope, faith and love regardless of what she may be dealing with and to grow in her faith.

I share encouragement through Life Application and Biblical Application, along with my love of music and history into my site. You will find the Story Behind the Hymn or Song in my blog pages.

I am a novelist at heart, and have been published in a number of anthologies and am now pursuing publication.

On top of being a writer, blogger, musician and speaker, I wear a number of other titles. These include daughter, sister, caretaker, Historian and Living Historian, Certified Activities Consultant, life coach, Bible teacher, consultant and coach, Genealogists, and survivor. But my most important title is child of God.
