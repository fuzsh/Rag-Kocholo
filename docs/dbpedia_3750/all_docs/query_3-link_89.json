In 1868, he\n\nbecame editor of the Sunday School hymn books, having succeeded William B. Bradbury.\n\nIn 1874, Lowry was pondering the Easter story. One evening he read the passage in Luke 24 that says “he is not here, he is risen,” during his devotional time. According the hymnologist Kenneth Osbeck, “Soon Robert Lowry found himself seated at the little pump organ in the parlor of his home. And in a very spontaneous fashion, the words and music of “Christ Arose” gave expression to the thoughts that had been uppermost in his mind. The hymn was published the following year and has been an inspirational favorite with God’s people ever since.”\n\nLowry wrote over 500 hymns and edited over twenty hymnals in his lifetime. Some of his hymns include Shall We Gather at the River, We’re Marching to Zion, All the Way the Saviour Leads Me, and I Need Thee Every Hour.\n\nHe died on November 25, 1899 in Plainfield, N. J.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nWelcome to my virtual home.
