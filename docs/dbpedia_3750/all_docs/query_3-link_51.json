Hawks (1872)\n\nHYMN HISTORY\n\nAnnie Hawks woke up early on a still June morning in 1872. She sat up in bed, looked out her window at the rose buds that were beginning to open and peek their faces up at her over her window sill. She breathed in the morning air of the Hawk’s home in Brooklyn, New York and thanked God for the 37 years she’d been given and for the day ahead. Annie was so thankful for the life God had blessed her with. Caring for her husband Charles, and her three children, and ordering their home was full of enjoyment and ever so satisfying. Sure, Annie had hard days and exhausting days and frustrating days sometimes too, but on this particular day, it seemed her joy was overflowing. As she tackled the everyday chores of folding, dusting, washing, scrubbing, and organizing, words of a poem began to form in her heart. “I need Thee every hour, teach me Thy will; And Thy rich promises in me fulfill.” Annie greatly enjoyed literature and had often written poetry as a young child. By age 14 she had even contributed her poetry regularly to various newspapers. But today, as she felt such joy in the nearness of the Lord as she worked, it seemed the words of this new poem were flowing out of her heart without any effort at all. Delighted with the lines God was giving her, Annie grabbed a pencil to write them down, hung up her apron and brought them to her pastor, Robert Lowry at Hanson Place Baptist Church. Mr. Lowry received her poem gladly. He wrote a tune to accompany Annie’s words and finished the song with a simple refrain.\n\nLater that year, Annie’s hymn was published in a small collection of hymns prepared for the National Baptist Sunday School Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, and eventually became a celebrated favorite worldwide. Sixteen years later, in 1888, Annie suffered a great loss when her beloved husband, Charles Hawks died. Some time afterwards, she reflected concerning her hymn and the loss of her husband, “Whenever my attention is called to it, I am conscious of great satisfaction in the thought that I was permitted to write the hymn “I need thee every hour,” and that it was wafted out to the world on the wings of love and joy, rather than under the stress of a great personal sorrow, with which it has so often been associated in the minds of those who sing it… I did not understand at first why this hymn had touched the great throbbing heart of humanity. It was not until long after, when the shadow fell over my way, the shadow of a great loss, that I understood something of the comforting power in the words which I had been permitted to give out to others in my hour of sweet serenity and peace.”\n\nIt is believed that Annie Hawks, over her lifetime, wrote approximately 400 hymns. I Need Thee Every Hour is the only one of her compositions that is still sung today. Annie’s song provides a wonderful example of how work and worship can go hand in hand. We have the privilege of joining Annie Hawks and all our brethren in Christ, in worshiping Jesus and proclaiming our need for the presence and nearness of our God and Savior.\n\nTHOUGHTS WHILE YOU SING\n\nIt isn’t often that we sing hymns that were written in the midst of gladness and joy. Many hymns that we sing today were written by someone who was suffering through desperate circumstances. But when Annie Hawks wrote “I Need Thee Every Hour,” she was doing chores… And she was HAPPY about it! What does your heart look like when you are sweeping the floor or cleaning dishes or wiping up a mess? Do you thank God for your work and rejoice in the goodness of it? Or do you grumble and wish that someone else could take care of it for you?\n\nWhen God created man and woman, he asked them to keep and cultivate the beautiful garden of Eden. In other words he told them to get to WORK! Work is something God created and it is good and satisfying. You were created by God for both worship and for work! And we can rejoice and praise our Lord while we do our jobs. When you are making your bed, do it as an act of worship unto God. When you clean up after your pets, do it with joy because God has given you animals to enjoy and take care of. When you set or clear the table, you can praise God for the blessing of food and family. Even when you clean the toilet, you can rejoice in all the good things God has given you (even a place to go to the bathroom!) and you can ask God to fill you with joy in doing the work he has given you. Chores may be a difficult thing for you. Ask God to teach you how to do them joyfully for him. He will help you do your work with a happy heart and he’ll fill you with satisfaction when your job is done well.\n\nUltimately we need God when we are having a difficult time and we need him when we are full of joy. And feeling our need for God is good! It is a sign that you have true saving faith! Let’s go to him in our need and he will help us and satisfy us.\n\nRead more here about how we can teach our kids to do chores while rejoicing in the goodness of work.\n\nHOW WE DO HYMN OF THE MONTH\n\nIf you are new to this community, welcome! It is a great time to join in and make family worship a priority if you haven’t already. You may or may not be familiar with this hymn. Either way, we invite you to spend this month meditating on its truths.\n\nTo get you started, we’ve provided free printable lyrics, music and copywork — all found here!\n\nLISTEN IN\n\nYou can find fresh versions of the hymn on our YouTube channel that you and your family can sing along with. There are loads of fresh versions of our favorite hymns on our hymn of the month playlist.\n\nKEEP IT SIMPLE\n\nWhen we began singing hymns with our littles about 11 years ago, we kept it simple… We prayed and sang one hymn together every night at bedtime for a whole month. At the end of that month, our toddler knew just about every verse of the hymn and was even able to join us in singing it at church! Everyone’s family rhythm is different, so we welcome you to gather up your families, for just a few minutes each day, to sing, discuss and memorize this hymn (following your daily time in the Scriptures and in prayer) whether it is first thing in the morning, or around the dinner table or before bedtime – whatever works best for your family. We would so love to know how learning this hymn is going for you! If you have a moment, let us know how it’s going by posting either a video or a photo on Instagram. Just tag it with #happyhymnody! As always, if you have any questions or if you’d like to share your heart with us, please don’t hesitate to reach out!\n\nGod bless you all this month as you worship and follow Jesus together as a family!\n\nSinging along with you,\n\nApril\n\nSources:\n\nFor further reading:\n\nI Need Thee Every Hour — John Bloom\n\n25 Chores to Teach Kids About the Goodness of Work — SARAH EEKHOFF ZYLSTRA\n\nCreated for Work — BOB THUNE\n\nBibliography:"
