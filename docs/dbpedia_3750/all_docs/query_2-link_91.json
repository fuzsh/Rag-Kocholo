        "text": "This song was written by Robert Lowry in 1867, but it still rocks even today…\n\nPeople will tell you that the young these days have no interest in hymns, but they are absolutely wrong! Many hymns really rock, but it’s the way we present them that have to change, and his is one of those hymns.\n\nEvery year I minister at Trout Creek Bible Camp at Corbett in Oregon, USA. We have Junior, Junior High and Senior High kids, and many of these are unchurched. I speak at the Chapel that they have every morning, and every morning a praise and worship band gets up there and plays loud, rocky music. With all the modern songs they sing, his one, written over a century ago, is the most popular, and I based my version of “Nothing But the Blood” on their way of singing it.\n\nThe Story Behind “Nothing But the Blood”\n\nThe Philadelphia-born author and composer of this hymn was a popular Baptist preacher and educator who served churches in Pennsylvania, New York City, Brooklyn, and Plainfield, New Jersey. He became know for producing some of the most popular Sunday school song collections of his day. His name was Robert Lowry (1826-1899).\n\nThe Rev. Carlton R. Young, editor of The United Methodist Hymnal, noted that “Nothing but the Blood” “was near the top of the list … of the most popular religious songs.” In fact, it has all the earmarks of a classic gospel song, with a repetitive theme it drives home in much the same way pop songs do. The chorus breaks this a little, but throughout the song the language is direct and obvious, with all one- or two-syllable words. The theme of cleansing from sin is prominent, making it a truly great gospel outreach song.\n\nHebrews 9:22 appeared initially above the hymn in the original publication by Lowry and William H. Doane entitled Gospel Music (1876). The passage reads: “Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin.”.\n\nThe cool thing about the song is that it takes the form of a question and answer, in effect making it like a cheerleading refrain or a marching song. This makes the common man hum the tune, get the truths about salvation into him and even sing along from the first hearing.\n\nWhile some might think it is an old fashioned song, modern Christian artists like Matt Redman and Hillsong United do versions of it. My version is designed to be fun and, yes, maybe a little bit cheerleaderish, but I don’t mind because we can sing it and enjoy it together! Old fashioned? I don’t think so! Even people who are unfamiliar with hymns tell me this song rocks, and that’s why we include it in out Hymns of our Fathers presentation.\n\nNothing But the Blood\n\nWhat can wash away my sin?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nWhat can make me whole again?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nRefrain\n\nOh! precious is the flow\n\nThat makes me white as snow;\n\nNo other fount I know,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nFor my pardon, this I see,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nFor my cleansing this my plea,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nRefrain\n\nThis is all my hope and peace,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nThis is all my righteousness,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nRefrain"
