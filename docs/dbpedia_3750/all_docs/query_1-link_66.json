        "text": "It is with the utmost sadness that I am writing to you today to announce the sudden loss of our beloved son, Caleb Lowry at the tender age of 28 on Monday, July 8 2024 following health complications at St. Joseph’s Hospital.\n\nCaleb had the biggest heart, he enjoyed spending time with family and friends more than anything. Caleb spent most of his time being creative drawing and getting tattoos, writing poetry, listening and writing his own music and gaming; he especially loved his chains and sneakers. Unfortunately, Caleb struggled with mental health and addiction. He had a hard life, but always persevered and for the past 18 months, he was driven towards his goals to sobriety which was very inspirational to all who knew and loved him.\n\nSurvived by Caleb are his parents Liane (Brett) Hoogenboom, Matt Lowry, sisters Coryna (Aidan) and Cassidy; aunt Tonia (Mike) and cousin Clara; uncle John (Janice) and cousins Chris and Zach, Corrie (Cara) and cousins Brianna, Calvin and Jacob; grandparents, Dana and Murray Donovan, Fred and Debbie Hoogenboom. Reunited with grandmother, Linda Brown, grandfather Robert Lowry and aunt Sue Laurin.\n\nWe wish to express our gratitude to Caleb’s aunt, Tonia who gave unwavering support and love throughout his life.\n\nThe family would like to give a special mention to the St. Joe’s Mental Health Hospital in Hamilton for all of their support and guidance throughout most of Caleb’s adult life."
