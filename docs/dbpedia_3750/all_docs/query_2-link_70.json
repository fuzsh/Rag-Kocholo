        "text": "Today is Maundy Thursday when our hearts begin to feel heavy with sorrow as we think of Jesus and his Last Supper with his beloved disciples.\n\nTomorrow on Good Friday, Christians around the entire world will remember and grieve the agony of our Savior crucified upon the cross for us…\n\nBut on Easter Sunday we shall sing this classic song with great gusto joyfully celebrating the victory of our Risen Lord Jesus over death and the grave….\n\nHallelujah! Christ Arose! He’s Alive!\n\nOne evening, about 12 years after Gilmore had written “He leadeth with me, ” another American Baptist minister, whose name today takes a high place in the realm of sacred song, was seated in a parlor organ in his home. All day long his thoughts had been dwelling on the glorious triumph of the Resurrection . He was a noted musical composer, and as he sat there, visualizing the wondrous scene, spontaneously there came words and music, giving expression to the thoughts of what had been upper most in his mind:\n\n“Low in the grave He lay,\n\nJesus my Savior!\n\nWaiting the coming day,\n\nJesus, my Lord.\n\nUp from the grave He arose\n\nWith a mighty triumph o’er His foes;\n\nHe rose a Victor from the dark domain,\n\nAnd He lives for ever with His saints to reign!\n\nHe arose! He arose!\n\nHallelujah! Christ arose!\n\nThe name of the writer of this gospel song is Robert Lowry. He was born in Philadelphia, on March 12, 1826. At the age of 17 he was brought to the Lord, and after a successful scholastic career at Lewisburg University, he became a pastor of the West Chester Baptist Church, Pennsylvania, from which he went on to various important pastorate ministries. Mr. Lowry died at Plainfield, New Jersey, on November 25, 1899, at 74 years of age.\n\nPossibly the best known composition by Dr. Lowry and one which, is not improbable, has been sung in most of the Sunday schools of the world, is the popular children’s hymn:\n\nShall we gather at the river\n\nWhere bright angel-feet have trod\n\nWith its crystal tide forever\n\nFlowing by the throne of God?\n\nIt was written at Brooklyn on a sultry afternoon, on July, 1864, when an epidemic among children was raging through the city, bringing death and sorrow into many-a-home.\n\nAmong other popular hymns by the same author, is the composition, “Where is my wandering boy tonight? ” and that old Gospel mission favorite:\n\nWhat can wash away my stain?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus!\n\nMr. Lowry was a great composer. He wrote the music for most of his hymns besides setting tunes to many others which are widely sung today."
