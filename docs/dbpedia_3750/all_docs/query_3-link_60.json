        "text": "This hymn is known by several names: Up From the Grave He Arose, Low in the Grave He Lay, and Christ Arose. I knew that I wanted to choose a song about the resurrection in honor of Easter this month and this one kept playing through my head.\n\nWhile it is an older hymn, dating back to 1874, it is still so applicable today. I love the upbeat excitement about the resurrection of Jesus portrayed in the hymn’s lyrics. The hymn was written by Pastor Robert Lowry who wrote many other hymns but felt that his true calling was preaching.\n\nThis hymn sings glory and praise because Jesus arose from the dead. There are three short verses but what most people remember most is the refrain. I think it is a great hymn study for children because the simple but powerful lyrics are easy to remember and share such a powerful truth. Jesus defeated death and lives forever!\n\n“Up from the grave He arose,\n\nWith a mighty triumph o’er His foes\n\nHe arose a Victor from the dark domain,\n\nAnd He lives forever with His saints to reign.\n\nHe arose! He arose!\n\nHallelujah! Christ arose!”\n\nI have shared various versions of the hymn below as well as more about the author Robert Lowry. If you have young children, you might enjoy this recipe for resurrection rolls that would go really well with a study of this hymn. I had such a hard time picking just one hymn for us to study this time of year, so I am hoping to get time to publish a couple of extra hymn studies this month.\n\nHymn Study Resources:\n\nSheet Music and Hymn Background\n\nUp From The Grave He Arose, Hymn Story\n\nUp From The Grave He Arose, Acapella\n\nUp From The Grave He Arose (sung by young children)\n\nUp From The Grave He Arose (More country/blue grass style)\n\nDownload Your Freebies Below!\n\nHymn Study Fact Sheet\n\nUp From The Grave He Arose (Copywork)\n\nResource Library and Affiliate Disclosure\n\nWhen you sign up for the Schoolin’ Swag free resource library you will get a link and password to the library, we are adding to the library each month with new items.
