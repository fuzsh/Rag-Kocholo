The Correctional Service of Canada will investigate the circumstances of this incident,” Messer said. “The safety and security of institutions, their staff and the public remains the highest priority in the operations of the federal correctional system.”\n\nLater CSC regional manager Jean-Paul Lorieau told Postmedia that police were not contacted about the attack on the inmate.\n\nLowry is appealing both his 2020 conviction and his 2021 sentence. His appeal is scheduled to be heard in January.\n\nIn July 2021, B.C. Supreme Court Justice Ward Branch sentenced Lowry, fellow Hells Angel Neil Cantrill and Cantrill’s son Stephan after convicting all three a year earlier for kidnapping, extortion, aggravated assault and overcoming resistance for a vicious attack on Robert Houle, a former Hope man who grew cannabis for Neil Cantrill for more than a dozen years.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn December 2014, Houle travelled to Edmonton to tell his partner that he wanted out of the pot business and offered the growing equipment to the biker.\n\nHe heard nothing more until July 31, 2016, when Neil Cantrill contacted him to arrange a meeting. The next day, Houle arrived at a roadside pullout near Hope, where he was grabbed, choked and beaten, then taken to his house where the trio tried to force him to sign the property over.\n\nRCMP officers arrived and took Houle to hospital for cuts, broken bones and a burn to his forehead.\n\nBranch said Houle had been severely impacted by the brutal assault and was forced to enter the witness protection program.\n\n“When Mr.Lowry was choking him, Mr. Houle thought he was going to die as he waslosing consciousness as well as control of his bowels,” Branch said. “He left town fearing that his life was on the line.”\n\nAt the time of the attack, Lowry was a Hells Angel “hang around.” He later became a full-patch member of the club.\n\nNeil Cantrill was sentenced to 10 years, while his son got six years for their roles in the 2016 kidnapping and attack.\n\nkbolan@postmedia.com\n\nTwitter.com/kbolan\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
