        "text": "Two Cincinnati artists at the beginning of their careers – writer Robert Lowry and illustrator Jim Flora – teamed up in the late 1930s to publish chapbooks under the name The Little Man Press.\n\nThe publications are highly collectible today, some selling for hundreds of dollars, well over the 6 to 8 cents apiece they sold for originally.\n\nLowry was hailed as an important post-World War II writer who counted Ernest Hemingway among his fans. Flora’s art, whimsical and a touch grotesque, was featured on innovative jazz album covers and in children’s books in the 1950s.\n\nWhile Flora’s work has had a resurgence, Lowry’s books are all out of print, forgotten and problematic due to his troubled past.\n\nOur history: This historic plan led to the birth of your favorite Cincinnati parks, Central Parkway\n\nArtists: Looking at Harry Belafonte's 2001 visit to Cincinnati’s Over-the-Rhine\n\nPrinting books in the basement\n\nLowry, born in Cincinnati in 1919, grew up in Linwood. As a child, he pounded out stories for hours on a typewriter. His stories and poems were published on the Sunshine Page of the Cincinnati Times-Star when he was 9.\n\nWhile at the University of Cincinnati, Lowry published a magazine called “The Little Man,” but he dropped out of school after one issue.\n\nIn the spring of 1938, Lowry visited the Art Academy of Cincinnati to find an artist to start his own independent press. He met student Jim Flora.\n\n“I was intrigued by his verve and the wild look in his eyes,” the late Flora recalled in a 1987 profile. “Lowry had been a child prodigy and was enormously talented. ...\n\n“Lowry had no money and I had only a string of zeroes so we decided to sell subscriptions to our nonexistent magazine. We tackled and browbeat everyone we knew and then sold subscriptions on the campus of the University of Cincinnati.”\n\nThey bought a vintage Chandler and Price printing press and two fonts of Baskerville type, enough to lay out two pages at a time. The two set up shop in Lowry’s basement in Linwood.\n\n“Lowry wrote many of our items in the basement we called our pressroom and immediately set them in type,” Flora remembered. “I carved wood engravings, woodcuts and linocuts because we couldn’t afford photoengraving. ...\n\n“We were forced to set and print the first and last pages of our booklets, then break up the type and set the second and the next to last page and so on, until we met in the middle. If we undercalculated I made an illustration to fill the blank space. We didn’t dare overcalculate and never did.”\n\nHigh praise for The Little Man Press\n\nIt was the Depression, so they reasoned the average little man (the source of the press’s name) couldn’t afford an expensive magazine. Their novel solution was to print each article or story as a separate booklet, in different sizes and different formats, that the buyer could then assemble into a box to complete the issue.\n\nThe first issue, published the summer of 1939, features stories by future acclaimed authors William Saroyan and Jesse Stuart, and what was claimed to be James Caldwell’s memoir of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War (but was written by Lowry, although Ezra Pound praised it, thinking it was authentic).\n\nAlso included was a testimonial letter from Nobel Prize laureate Thomas Mann (translated from German, it read: “The material which thus far you have collected for your magazine seems decidedly interesting to me and has given me the impression that The Little Man can become the center of interest of young and progressive artistic aspirations in America.”)\n\nThe booklets had small print runs of 125 to 400 copies.\n\nThe Enquirer’s review of the first issue didn’t exactly endorse the content: “Let the buyer beware – the writing is ultramodern, highly experimental, which is to say that anything goes, words not used in polite social circles being used to describe events such circles don’t discuss.”\n\nThe Little Man Press was noted for the imaginative design and artwork done by Flora. The issues “served as artistic rites of exorcism for the budding illustrator,” wrote journalist Irwin Chusid. “Flora’s images veered from childish whimsy to disturbing freakishness.”\n\nIn 1942, Lowry was drafted into the Army and Flora moved to Connecticut to work in Columbia Records’ art department. The Little Man Press dissolved.\n\n“We were very proud of our accomplishment and, if World War II hadn’t come along, the press might have metamorphosed into some lasting form,” Flora wrote. “Alas! It was not to be. The Little Man Press sank with only a few bubbles to mark its demise.”\n\nFlora went on to create a number of influential and off-beat jazz covers for Columbia and RCA Victor, featuring Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa with misshapen bodies and wobbly arms, and published several children’s books.\n\nLowry’s tragic fall\n\nAfter World War II, Lowry moved to New York and published several novels and short stories, achieving acclaim as a new American literary voice. He kept company with Gore Vidal, William Saroyan and Truman Capote.\n\nBut Lowry’s behavior had always been erratic, and things got worse.\n\n“Lowry’s fame was growing, and he was caught up in the literary world. Unfortunately, Bob did not have the mental stability to handle all that publicity,” Flora told CityBeat in 1995. “He drank too much, and he never could hold his liquor. In Cincinnati, he would take one drink and go berserk, throwing himself on the floor, saying, ‘I’m a rug! I’m a rug! Step on me!’”\n\nIn 1952, Lowry’s family had him committed to a mental institution and he underwent electric shock treatments. His behavior changed, and about this time he started to express antisemitic thoughts that worked into his writing.\n\n“He was NEVER like that before,” his second wife, Frankie, who was Jewish, told CityBeat.\n\nLowry spent years in institutions, but publishers finally wouldn’t touch his writing. His career was over.\n\nHe moved back to Cincinnati, working odd jobs and living in his mother’s house. In the late 1980s, Flora visited his old partner.\n\n“We sat around at his mother’s house, and he spoke about the mistakes he had made,” Flora told CityBeat. “Eventually I had to leave. He followed me to the door, and as I stepped out he said, ‘I guess I really blew it, Jim.’ This was a terrible tragedy for a man of that quality and drive.”\n\nLowry spent the last few years of his life living in low-rent hotels downtown or in the Drop Inn Center, and drinking at the Bay Horse Cafe. He died in the Veterans Administration Medical Center in 1994.\n\nFinding Flora\n\nIrwin Chusid of Hoboken, New Jersey, had collected record albums with Jim Flora cover art, knowing nothing about the artist. In the late 1990s, he created a website of Flora’s album art and met the artist once at his home in Connecticut before Flora died in 1998 at age 84.\n\nFlora’s family showed Chusid a storage facility where all his art was kept.\n\n“Boxes of art ... just sitting there, unacknowledged, forgotten,” Chusid said in an interview with The Enquirer. “Forgotten? I don’t think this stuff had ever been seen.”\n\nHe made an agreement with the family to bring out Flora’s art once again. His work was collected in four books – including art from The Little Man Press – and sold as fine-art prints at www.jimflora.com.\n\n“He was devoted to art and found a way to earn a good living at it,” Chusid said. “… There was plenty of time after he completed his assignments to create paintings, sketches, drawings and woodcuts which reflected his wild artistic impulses without commercial restraint. He told me that after he retired, he created art every day for the rest of his life.”\n\nThe Walker Art Center in Minneapolis mounted the first-ever Little Man Press exhibit in May 2008. Print Magazine published a feature on Flora written by former New York Times art director Steven Heller in 2018. Some people remember."
