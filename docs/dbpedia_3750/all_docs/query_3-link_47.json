        "text": "While Washington D.C. is alarmed at the news of a possible Confederate invasion (which comes of naught in the days ahead), further to the north this month the pastor of the Hanson Place Baptist Church in Brooklyn, New York composes a song that will be long remembered.\n\nRobert Lowry (1826-1899) is a Philadelphia native who at the young age of seventeen became a Christian. While his parents attended a Presbyterian church, Lowry busied himself with the study of scripture and decided to become a Baptist. He was subsequently baptized by Rev. George B. Ide, D.D and joined the First Baptist Church of Philadelphia.\n\nInitially deploying his Christian energies into Sunday School work, Lowry soon felt called to the ministry. Following college, he was ordained by and became pastor of the First Baptist Church of West Chester, Pennsylvania in 1854. Four years later in 1858, Lowry accepted the call to pastor the Bloomingdale Baptist Church in New York City, and then in 1861 became the pastor of the Hanson Place Baptist Church.\n\nAnd so it is that on a hot July afternoon in New York an exhausted Lowry, pausing for a rest, experiences a vision.\n\nThe weather was oppressively hot, and the author was lying on a lounge in a state of physical exhaustion. He was almost incapable of bodily exertion, and his imagination began to take to itself wings. Visions of the future passed before him with startling vividness. The imagery of the Apocalypse took the form of tableaux. Brightest of all were the throne, the heavenly river, and the gathering of the saints. While he was thus breathing heavily in the sultry atmosphere of that July day, his soul seemed to take new life from that celestial outlook. He began to wonder why the hymn-writers had said so much about “the river of death,” and so little about “the pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.” As he mused, the words began to construct themselves. They came first as a question of Christian inquiry, “Shall we gather?” Then they broke out in chorus, as an answer of Christian faith, “Yes, we’ll gather.” On this question and answer the hymn developed itself. The music came with the hymn. The author never has been able to tell which had priority of birth. They are twins. When song had formulated itself, the author sprang up, sat down at his organ, played the time through, and sang the first stanza and the chorus. Then he wrote it out.\n\nThe song that came to Lowry goes like this:"
