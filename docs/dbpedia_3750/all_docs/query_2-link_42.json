        "text": "\"How Can I Keep From Singing?\" (also known by its opening line \"My Life Flows On in Endless Song\") is a Christian hymn with music written by American Baptist minister Robert Wadsworth Lowry. The song is frequently, though erroneously, cited as a traditional Quaker hymn. The original composition has now entered into the public domain, and appears in several hymnals and song collections, both in its original form and with a revised text.\n\nContents\n\n1 Authorship and Lyrics\n\n2 History\n\n3 Enya version\n\n4 Recordings\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nAuthorship and Lyrics\n\nApparently the first publication of the words was on August 7, 1868, in the New York Observer. Entitled \"Always Rejoicing,\" and attributed to \"Pauline T.\",[1][2] the text reads:\n\nMy life flows on in endless song:\n\nAbove earth's lamentation,\n\nI catch the sweet, tho' far-off hymn\n\nThat hails a new creation.\n\nThrough all the tumult and the strife\n\nI hear the music ringing;\n\nIt finds an echo in my soul--\n\nHow can I keep from singing?\n\nWhat tho' my joys and comfort die?\n\nThe Lord my Saviour liveth;\n\nWhat tho' the darkness gather round?\n\nSongs in the night he giveth.\n\nNo storm can shake my inmost calm,\n\nWhile to that refuge clinging;\n\nSince Christ is Lord of heaven and earth,\n\nHow can I keep from singing?\n\nI lift my eyes; the cloud grows thin;\n\nI see the blue above it;\n\nAnd day by day this pathway smooths,\n\nSince first I learned to love it.\n\nThe peace of Christ makes fresh my heart,\n\nA fountain ever springing;\n\nAll things are mine since I am his--\n\nHow can I keep from singing?\n\nThese are the words as published by Robert Lowry in the 1869 song book, Bright Jewels for the Sunday School.[3] Here Lowry claims credit for the music, but gives no indication as to who wrote the words. These words were also published in a British periodical in 1869, The Christian Pioneer,[4] but no author is indicated. Ira D. Sankey published his own setting of the words in Gospel Hymns, No. 3 (1878), writing that the words were anonymous.[5] In 1888, Henry S. Burrage listed this hymn as one of those for which Lowry had written the music, but not the lyrics.[6]\n\nDoris Plenn learned the original hymn from her grandmother, who reportedly believed that it dated from the early days of the Quaker movement. Plenn contributed the following verse around 1950, which was taken up by Pete Seeger and other folk revivalists:[7]\n\nWhen tyrants tremble, sick with fear,\n\nAnd hear their death-knell ringing,\n\nWhen friends rejoice both far and near,\n\nHow can I keep from singing?\n\nIn prison cell and dungeon vile,\n\nOur thoughts to them go winging;\n\nWhen friends by shame are undefiled,\n\nHow can I keep from singing?\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the 20th Century, this hymn was not widely used in congregational worship. Diehl's index to a large number of hymnals from 1900 to 1966 indicates that only one hymnal included it: the 1940 edition of The Church Hymnal of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (hymn no. 265).[8] The United Methodist Church published it in its 2000 hymnal supplement, The Faith We Sing (hymn no. 2212), giving credit for the lyrics as well as the tune to Robert Lowry.[9] The Faith We Sing version changes some of the lyrics and punctuation from the 1868 version.\n\nPete Seeger learned a version of this song from Doris Plenn, a family friend, who had it from her North Carolina family. His version made this song fairly well known in the folk revival of the 1960s. Seeger's version omits or modifies much of the Christian wording of the original, and adds Plenn's verse above. The reference in the added verse intended by Seeger and by Plenn - both active in left-wing causes - is to 'witch hunts' of the House Un-American Activities Committee (Seeger himself was sentenced to a year in jail in 1955 as a result of his testimony before the Committee, which he did not serve due to a technicality) . Most folk singers, including Enya, have followed Seeger's version.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 80s, How Can I Keep From Singing was recorded by Catholic Folk musician Ed Gutfreund (on an album called \"From An Indirect Love\"), and the music was published in a widely used Catholic Hymnal called \"Glory and Praise,\" and was popular among Catholic liturgical music ministers, especially those who used guitar. In this, and in an 1993 recording by Marty Haugan, Jeanne Cotter, and David Haas, the quatrain beginning: \"No storm can shake my inmost calm...\" is used as a repeated refrain.\n\nIn the first season of The Muppet Show, Jim Henson sang the hymn in the voice of Rowlf the Dog.[10]\n\nIt is also sung by Dahlia Malloy (Minnie Driver) in the episode 'Virgin Territory' from Season Two of FX's The Riches.\n\nIn his radio singing debut, actor Martin Sheen performed this song (using the Plenn-Seeger lyrics) on A Prairie Home Companion in September 2007.\n\nIt has been used on the 2009 Christmas advertisement for the UK supermarket, Waitrose, in a performance by Camilla Kerslake.\n\nContemporary Christian artist, Chris Tomlin clearly was inspired by the song when he wrote his song, \"How Can I Keep from Singing Your Praise\" in 2007. So, Pauline T's Christian poem is again regularly sung in churches as a worship song.\n\nEnya version\n\nThe song received new prominence in 1991 when Irish musician Enya released a recording of the hymn on her album Shepherd Moons. It was also released as a single in November of the same year, with Oíche Chiún and 'S Fagaim Mo Bhaile appearing as additional tracks.\n\nThe videoclip featured Enya singing in a church in the countryside, while also including archive footage of political figures such as Nelson Mandela or Boris Yeltsin among others, and references to the Gulf War and famine.\n\nCharts\n\nChart (1991) Peak\n\nposition UK Singles Chart 32 Australian ARIA Singles Chart 47 Swedish Singles Chart 29\n\nRecordings\n\nCarol Pierson on Co-op Hoot (1965)\n\nLiz Getz on How Can I Keep from Singing?
