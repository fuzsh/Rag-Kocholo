        "text": "With over a decade of experience, Rob Lowry has mastered the art of weaving songs together to tell a story and show you something that visuals simply cannot. From a young age, the prolific music supervisor has used music as a vessel to build a narrative. Whether it was making mixtapes for friend’s birthdays in elementary school, directing his own silent films to put music to in high school, or using the perfectly curated thread of songs in the form of a mix CD to tell his mom he was leaving home to pursue his dreams in Los Angeles after graduating college, Lowry understands that music is able to say everything whilst saying nothing at all—mouth shut, heart open, soul out of body. Now, his work on screen carries that same level of intimacy and care.\n\nAt 35, Lowry is a powerhouse in music supervision with credits that range from critically acclaimed to commercially celebrated. Most recently he has leant his ear and talents to widely loved projects such as box office smash The Lost City (Paramount), Sundance winner Cha Cha Real Smooth (Apple+), and cultural sensation Gossip Girl (HBO Max) - amongst a growing plethora of others. The beauty of his scintillating work comes from a passion for diverse storytelling that allows him to partner with a wide range of talent and pull from a rich well of sounds—which can include everything from modern pop and R&B to traditional arabic music —in order to successfully get a message across or evoke a specific feeling that perhaps hasn’t even been named yet. For Rob, music is the ultimate tool to connect people to each other, the art at hand, and—ultimately—the world.\n\nLowry was recently featured as one of Variety's \"Music Supervisors to Watch\" and his work has been covered in a variety of publications including Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, The Hollywood Reporter, MTV, and Paper Magazine, among others. He is a two time Guild of Music Supervisors' Awards nominee.\n\nBridging the world between song and picture is a dream Mia always longed to do, as it creates something so beautiful that words simply aren’t needed. As an LA native, she was heavily influenced by the entertainment industry - from going to shows at The Forum and Greek, to seeing films at AMC 16 and The Americana, even learning how to drive on the same roads that Fast Times At Ridgemount High and Valley Girl were filmed. There was no escaping it, and she wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nAfter working at a music library house and interning with a music supervision company, Mia began working with Sweater Weather Music in 2020 and the rest has been history. She has had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects across both Television and Film as a music coordinator from HBO Max’s Gossip Girl to Sundance winner Cha Cha Real Smooth (Apple+) and Fingernails (Apple +). Mia has also co-music supervised projects Harlan Coben’s Shelter (Amazon) and Bad Genius. She has also had the pleasure of being a featured panelist at the Durango Songwriters Expo, as well as one of the Music Supervisors at the Anacrusis Park City Writing Retreat. Mia is excited to continue on her journey as a music supervisor with Sweater Weather Music and the unique projects that will come with it."
