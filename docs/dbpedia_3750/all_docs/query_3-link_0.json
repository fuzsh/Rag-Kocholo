        "text": "American actor (1913–1971)\n\nRobert Lowery (born Robert Lowery Hanks,[1][2] October 17, 1913 – December 26, 1971) was an American motion picture, television, and stage actor who appeared in more than 70 films. He was the second actor to play Batman, appearing as the character in the 1949 film serial Batman and Robin.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLowery was born in Kansas City, Missouri.[3]\n\nSyndicated newspaper columnist Harrison Carroll reported that Lowery was \"a direct descendant of Nancy Hanks\" (Lincoln).[4]\n\nHe graduated from Paseo High School[5] in Kansas City, and soon was invited to sing with the Slats Randall Orchestra.[3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nLowery debuted in motion pictures in Come and Get It (1936).[6]\n\nDuring his career, Lowery was primarily known for roles in action films such as The Mark of Zorro (1940), The Mummy's Ghost (1944), and Dangerous Passage (1944). He became the second actor to play DC Comics' Batman (succeeding Lewis Wilson), starring in a 1949's Batman and Robin serial.[2]\n\nLowery also had roles in a number of Western films, including The Homesteaders (1953), The Parson and the Outlaw (1957), playing Gangster-mastermind Arnold Rothstein in The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond (1960), Young Guns of Texas (1962), and Johnny Reno (1966). He was also a stage actor and appeared in Born Yesterday, The Caine Mutiny, and in several other productions.\n\nOn television, Lowery was best known for the role of Big Tim Champion on the series Circus Boy (1956–1957).[7] In 1956, he guest starred in \"The Deadly Rock,\" an episode of The Adventures of Superman (which was the first time a Batman actor shared screen time with a Superman actor, although Lowery and Reeves had appeared together in their presuperhero days in the 1942 World War II anti-VD propaganda film, Sex Hygiene.) Lowery also had guest roles on Perry Mason, featured as murder victim Amos Bryant in \"The Case of the Roving River\" and as Andrew Collis in \"The Case of the Provocative Protégé\", Playhouse 90 (\"The Helen Morgan Story\"), Hazel, Cowboy G-Men, as Foxy Smith on Maverick in the 1959 episode \"Full House\" starring James Garner with Joel Grey as Billy the Kid, Tales of Wells Fargo, Rawhide, 77 Sunset Strip, Hawaiian Eye, and Pistols 'n' Petticoats.\n\nHe made his last on-screen appearance in the 1967 comedy/Western film The Ballad of Josie, opposite Doris Day and Peter Graves.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nHe was married three times, to three actresses. Jean Parker and he had a son, Robert Lowery Hanks II, in 1952.[5]\n\nHis other wives were Vivan Wilcox and Barbara \"Rusty\" Farrell, whom he married on March 21, 1947 in Las Vegas, Nevada.[8]\n\nLowery died of heart failure at the age of 58 in his Los Angeles apartment on December 26, 1971.[9][10]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1936 Come and Get It Chicago Restaurant Patron Uncredited Great Guy Mr. Parker Uncredited 1937 Wake Up and Live Chauffeur The Lady Escapes Reporter Uncredited You Can't Have Everything Co-Pilot Uncredited Wife, Doctor and Nurse Interne Uncredited Charlie Chan on Broadway Reporter Uncredited Hot Water Uncredited Life Begins in College Sling Second Honeymoon Reporter Uncredited Big Town Girl Elevator Boy Uncredited 1938 City Girl Greenleaf Uncredited Happy Landing Newspaper Reporter Uncredited Walking Down Broadway Delivery Man Uncredited Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm Attendant Uncredited Island in the Sky Elevator Starter Uncredited Four Men and a Prayer Sailor Uncredited A Trip to Paris Bank Teller Uncredited Kentucky Moonshine Reporter Uncredited Alexander's Ragtime Band Reporter Uncredited Safety in Numbers Harry One Wild Night Bank Messenger Uncredited Josette Boatman Rufe Uncredited Always Goodbye Don Gordon Uncredited Passport Husband Ted Markson Gateway Reporter Uncredited Keep Smiling Man at Auction Uncredited Straight, Place and Show Bob Uncredited Submarine Patrol Sparks, radioman Kentucky Sally's Partner at Ball Uncredited 1939 Tail Spin Sam, Mechanic Uncredited Wife, Husband and Friend Interne Uncredited Everybody's Baby B.
