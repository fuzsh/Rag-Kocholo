        "meta_description": "Nothing But the Blood (Single) by The Journey Collective, released 19 January 2015\n\n1. Nothing But The Blood\n\nWith the Journey Collective&#39;s latest release, writers Russ Mohr and Aaron Smith attempt to reimagine what the classic Robert Lowry hymn, Nothing But the Blood of Jesus might have sounded like as a Civil Rights anthem. Applying themes of racial reconciliation, justice and unity, it&#39;s timely message is simple: at the heart of racial reconciliation is the message of the Gospel. This simple yet powerful arrangement brings new life to an old church favorite and calls us to action, all the while reminding us that true reconciliation can only happen when the power of Christ is at work in our hearts and communities.",
