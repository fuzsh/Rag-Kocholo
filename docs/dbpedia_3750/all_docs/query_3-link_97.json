Years ago there was put into possession of the writer a collection of family documents left by Aunt Mary McNab, of the Lowellville family, and Martha Jane McNab, of the Poland Center family; and a promise was then given that the records of our ancestry, so far as known, would be written at favorable opportunity. The information thus obtained was supplemented later by Alfred J. Lowry of the Leipsic family and, to a less extent, by many other relatives. . All the grandchildren of Robert Lowry being now dead, the tradi- tions and records here printed are offered in fulfillment of the promise to przccrve such knowledge as we have of those auiiiiraijle men and wo- men of our family who have passed away, but still survive in the lives and character of their descendants; and on the appeal of the many In- terested the history has been brought down to date and given to com- prehend six generations. L. H. E. LOWRY. YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO. N. B. The original manuscript has been revised at the h.and of Houston W. Lowry Carlsbad. N. M., 1921. Vm V ** t-J*-\" ^ -A AN APPRECIATION Special recognition is due the author of the aceompanying memoirs. The main record of his life is found in its appropriate place, all but the closing item prepared under his hand, but in view of pains with the his- tory he is deserving of more. He did not long survive the completion of his work v/i'th the records', and who else was so admirably fitted for the part or so concerned to see it accomplished? It is evident that he undertook the annals as a labor of love, and only intense personal interest could account for their accu- racy and comprehensiveness. To collect the facts and put them in order made an immense task, and it occurs that but for him it would scarcely have been undertaken .at all. And the quality of the work lifts it high above routine. Any view of the pages discovers rhe mark of outright genius. The touch is not more vital, personal than literary. The pketehes of pioneer !:fo at the close of the print, forming a unique department of interest, are incident to our ancestry, but they offer rich appeal far outside immediate family circles and, independent of direct acquaintance, are fitted to set hearts aglow everywhere. \"Hez\" was a reserved nature, and he lived much apart. He was a stu- d-ent, a thinker, and in his practice of law be proved his rare ability as a counseller, but he was distinctively more than professional. The friends he made he kept, and in private he warmed and loosened into congenial, instructive, happy fellowship. He inherited the homestead, originally occupied by his grandfather and grandmother, V/illiam and Mary Houston Lowry, and at his death it was still his property; and the rich limestone deposit beneath its surface counted less with him than the fond sentiment of household association. His life knew shadows, but at the sunset the sky was clear, bearing full promise of the bright eternal day. He belonged within the Cove- nant, assured and hallowed to him with the piety and prayerfulness of multiplied, antecedent generations, .and of his own faith and longing he was entrusted to the hands of the Covenant-keeping G-od and as heir ol salvation was gathered to his fathers in peace. â€” H. W. L. TAr FAMILY TRADITIONS; The Huguenot The Scotch-Irish group of Lowr}' families in America, includlni^ our own family, trace their lineage hack to the north of Ireland and have a wide spread tradition that their remote ancestors were Huguenots driven out of France during the religious wars and persecutions follow- ing the Protestant Reformation. The most authentic statement of this family tradition is in a letter from Rev. J. W. S. Lowry of the Canadian Presbyterian Church at Fitzroy, Ontario: \"From what you say of your forefathers we are undoubtedly of the same stock. The parishes of Killyleagh, Killinchy and Kilmore all border on each other, and are full of Lowrys. Kilmore is my native place, and I have many relatives in Killyleagh and Killinchy. My father, William Lowry, was a merchant and for many years an elder in the church at Kilmore, and I was born and brought up in that congregation. My maternal grandfather, Rev. Joseph Lowry, was pastor in that paristi over h3if a ceutui'y. Cur progenitors v.'ere French Huguenots, Tivytestant refugees, w-io at the time of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew in August, 1572, fled to Great Britain and subsequejitly to the Emerald Isle. This is the tradi- tion related for generations past by the fathers to the children at ilie firesides of the old land aud in my childhood days it was fondly cher- ished in my old liome.\" THE N,\\ME TItADITIOX. A second family tradition is that our Huguenot ancestors, at the time of the Reformation, were living at \"Lory\" or in \"Lory River settle- ment,\" the exact location being unknown. Our family name is most gen- erally said to he derived from this place, (wherever it may have been), from which our remote ancestors fled, seeking refuge in Scotland where John Knox and the Lords of the Congregation had already established Presbyterianism. In those former days, when seals were used instead of signatures, the device upon the Lory seal, according to a third tradition, consisted of a wreath between two branches of laurel. It may be of some interest to note that this emblem appears now as part of the .armorial bearings of several distinguished families in the province of Ulster. When learning became more general and writing supplanted seals, m3.ny variations arose in written surnames. Thus we find, in the case of our own name, Low-rie and Lau-rie in the Scotch shires of Lanark. Ayr and Kirkcubright, and Low-ry in the Irish counties of Tyrone, Fer- managh and Down, while Lo-ry still survives as the name of more dis- tant family stocks. Variation in the form of the root name is extensive. It occurs as Lowery, Lowary, Lourie, Loughrie, Loughrey, Lauglirie aud possibly others. Fcur AUTHENTIC ACCOUNT The parishes of Killinchy, Kilmore, and Killyleagh in County Down. Ulster, are the first places that can be identified in our family history. Our direct ancestors settled in the. parish of Killinchy about three hundred years ag-o, which corresponds in date with the first (1611) Scotch-Irish \"Plantation\" of Ulster. In process of time the Killinchy Lowrys increased and spread into the adjoining parishes of Killyleagh and Kilinore. The little parish of Killyle.agh lies upon the western shore of Strangford Lough. La this parish was bora Robert Lowry, the first ancestor of whom we have definite knowledge. At Killyleagh he held an estate for the lives of three men. There he married and upon this eetiate he lived until, at the age of fifty-five, the estate was sold for enough to bring the family to America and establish them in another home upon tne frontier of a new nation. The family documents, copies of which are appended, reproduced fac simile, show th,at this family were people of reputable connection, of unblemished character, sober, honest and industrious; that they were never concerned in any of the numerous rebellions that occured in Ire- land, and that all of them were members of the church at Kilmore. Robert Lowry, according to iis pastor's certificate, was a useful and confidential member of the session of that church, a man of piety and of the purest morals. CHtTRCfl LETTER The bearer, Robert Lowry, his wife and sons, have been many years regular members of my congregation, of very reputable connection and ijnMornished cbT-actor, admitted to the- sacramoi^L of the Supper and eve- ry privilege suited to their circumstances, his sons being yet in a state of celibacy. He himself has been a very useful and confidential member of our session, a man of piety and the purest morals. This family now sails for America where I hope they will soon prove themselves worthy of friendly attention in whatsoever worshipping society Piovidence may order their lot. 29th of April, 1804. .

ROBERT LOWRY, the- first o? our family to come to this country. Wiis born on the third day of June, A. D., 1749, in Killyleagh, and was married in the year 1771 to MARY JOHNSTONE, who was born on the seventeenth day of March, A. D, 174'J. The voyage to the United States was made in the year 1804. His wife and his sons, Robert, James and William, came over with him. His son, Johnstone, had come a year or two before. They sailed from Eel- fast and were nine weeks upon the Atlantic, a storm having risen durmjr the voyage which drove the ship back within sight of the Irish coast several weeks after they had sailed. They landed at Philadelphia and settled at Poland Center, Mahaning County, Ohio. The original homestead farm was two hundred acres of land, known as Great Lot No. 34, on the norrh-weat corner of the Center. The cost of the farm was six hundred and fifty dollars. It was fully paid for, and the deed was received from the Connecticut Land Company on the fifth day of April, 18 li. This family were .among the founders of the Poland Center Seceder Church, and Robert Lowry was chosen one of its first elders. He was killed by a tailing tree, May I8th, 1S14. on 'the farm nf John Arrel, and his wife died September K^th, LSI 4. They lie buried at Poland Center. THE LOWPvY FA:\\IILY. ROBERT LOWRY and MARY JOHNSTONE hid six childrenâ€” four sons and two daughters. MARTHA LOWRY, the oldest of the family, was born February eleventh, 1774. She was married in Ireland to John Martin and neve- came to this country. Nothing further is known of her or of her descendants. JANE LOWRY, the youngest of the family, was (born December tenth, 1787. She was married in Ireland to George Hutton. Tt was intoaded that she and her husband should come to America; but Hutton was opposed to the migration; and the night before they were to sail he cauie with a body of armed men and carried his wife away, and nothing further has been heard of this branch of the family. JAMES LOWRY, the third child, was born June second, 1778. He came to this country in 1804 with his parents, but settled in Baltimore. Maryland, and engaged in a mercantile business. He married a girl who offended his father, ,and all communication ceased. Jar'.es Lowry diod before his father and left children. After liis death his widow wrote to his father, but her letter was unanswered, and all trace o'f this branch of the family has been lost. ROBERT, JOHNSTONE, and WILLIAM, ihe second, fourth, and fifth children, settled with their parents at Poland Center where they found at last the peaceful refuge that former generations had sought In vain amidst the religious strifes and turbulent rebellions of the old cnuUry. EUM POLAND TOWNS HIP in which these pioneer members of our family settled in the southeastern township of that famous region in northeastern Ohio known as the Con- necticut Western Reserve. The Mahoning River, which in that part of its course formed a deep and most beautiful valley, flows diagonally through the north half of the township and is the most striking natural feature. The surface was covered with a dense forest growing upon a fer- tile soil, which the pioneers and their descendants converted into bounti- ful farmsteads. The hills were underlaid with the ore and the coal and the limestone to which is due the founding in the Mahoning and Slien- ango Valleys of those great iron and steel industries that date their be- ginning in 18 03 at the primitive furnace of Dan Eaton on the Yellow Creek, which winds down through the western part of Poland tov/nship to what is now the village of Struthers. The original survey was made in 179 8 under the supervision of Turhand Kirtland as agent of the Connecticut Land Co. The lands were offered for sale in the following year when the first settlers, Jonaihan Fowler and John Strutliers, came, and the township .Â«pen;s to have been settled o'litP rapidly, for a tiTne-ye'lowcd tr.x list or 1SC3 records the names of fifty-six tax payers. PIONEER NEIGHBORS When the Lowry family arrived in 1804 they found therefore many congenial neighbors with a debating society fully org'anized and a militia company already enrolled. On the opposite corner of the Center was Gilbert Buchanan, across the road were William Reed and the McCon- nells, while the adjacent farms north and west were occupied by William Guthrie and Brian Slaven. Over near Fowler's store, where Poland Vil- lage stands, was James McNab, and out the South road, the first physi- cian. Dr. Isaac Cowden. Toward the' state line lived John Arrel, and down along the river, John McGill who ran the grist mill that grew up in Lowellville. Beyond the Valley in the adjoining township of Coitsville dwelt William Stewart and William Houston, in whose families the three bachelor sons found their wives. James Shields and David Cooper were then living in Coitsville, and along the state line, on the Pennsylvania side, Samuel McBride and Francis McFarland, and near New Bedford, Robert Walker had settled some years before. Other families not men- tioned were located in the neighborhood, to whose descendants likewise many among the later generations of our family have been bound by the ties of blood or life-long friendships. NUM THE POIi.WD CKXTKR CHLRCII with which so many of our family were connected, was organized In the summer of 1804 under the Rev. James, Duncan. This church was orig- inally of the Associate (Seceder) Presbyterian denoraination. Its found- ers were the sturdy Scotch-Irish settlers, including the Lowrys, Stewarts, Houstons, McConnells McNabs, Cowdens, McBrides, and also Struthers, McCombs, and Gibsons. The congregation was organized and its summer meetings were held in \"God's own temple,\" the primeval \"woods.\" In the winters they met at the pioneer homes of the members. A log meeting house was built in 1810 on the south road, opposite the graveyard, a short distance from the \"Center.\" The services were held in this structure until 1826 when a ibrick building took its place, and this in turn was replaced in 184 9 by the frame church v.'hich we all remember. The first minister was followed by Rev. Robert Douglas, and he by that great pastor. Rev. David Goodwillie, who spent his life ministering to the people of Polaud Center, Deer Creek and Liberty, preaching to them the plain and simple gosp-el of faith and righteousness, and helping to lay, deep and solid, the spiritual foundations of a great community. The Union of 1858 brought the Associate and the Associate Reform- ed churches together into the United Presbyterian church, after which Po- land Center (Associate) and Mahoning (Associate Reformed) were united in one pastoral charge. In 1884 the Poland Center site was abandoned, the building reproduced at Struthers and given to serve for many years the new coug.egation and retained still as United Presbyterian. VÂ«i THE LEIPSTC FAMTTiY ROBERT LOWRY the oldest son of ROBERT LOWRY and MARY JOHNSTONE, was born at Klllyleagh, March thirteenth, 1776; came to this country in 1804 with his parents, and married. October thirteenth, 1813, Rebecca Stew- art, a sister of William Stewart of CoitsviUe. At the division of his father's estate in 1810. he obtained the west half of the Poland Center farm, on wliich the original dwelling house stood, and li^ed there until 1836, when he sold this land, and in May, 1837, joined in the westward movement in which many families chang- ed their residence to northwestern Ohio, where this branch of the family established a new home, in Liberty Township, Putnam county, Ohio, and southwest of the present site of Leipsic. He and his wife joined the Associate Church of Poplar Ridire, Aug- ust fifth, 1837, by certificate from the Associate church of PoLand Center. He was soon elected an elder in the congregation, an office he filled with faithful service until his death. As t\" appearance, he v/as large, tall and square-shouldered, full- iUAied ani wore a full beard, wus genial in disposition and popular with all. He enjoyed reading and is said to have been the best educated member of the family. A few months after the death of his wife, June ninth, 184G, he went to live with his daughter, Mary Lowry (McConnell), until his death, August twenty-seventh, 184 8. He is buried in the McConnell cemetery three miles south-west of Leipsic. REBECCA STEWAKT was remotely descended from the Stewarts of Scotland and more imme- diately from a John Stewart who settled (1665) in County Down, from which his grandson Samuel emigrated (1735) to Lancaster County, Pa. The father of Rebecca was Robert Stewart (1732-1811) the third sou of Samuel, and her mother was Sarah Stewart of Chester County, Pa. Robert Stewart and Sarah Stewart were married in 17 65 and pur- chased lands on Marsh Creek near Gettysburg, Adams County, Pa., where Rebecca Stewart was born in 1786 or 1787, the youngest of ten children, and judging from her father's will seems to have been a favo.ed child. Her mother died when the girl was ten years of age. She re- mained in the home until her father's death, 1811, after which she came to CoitsviUe, where she met Robert Lowry, and on October thirteenth, they were married. Until May, 18 3 7, she and her' husband lived at Poland Center, moving from there to their new home in Putnam couTr- ty where she spent the remainder of her life, dying June ninfli, 184 6. She lies buried in the McConnell cemetery by the side of her husband. Those who know her, remember her as a woman of remarkable activity, very bright and energetic; possessing a fine character and di.s- position; loved by those of her own house and admired by a wide circle of friends. Eievtn THE COITSVTTiLE STEWARTS William Stewart, (1765-1841), of Coitsville, whose family were closely related by marriage to so many members of our family, was the oldest of ten children of Rol)e t and Sarah Stewart of Adams County. Pa. He married (1799) his cousin. iMury Stewart (177^5-1851) -of Dauphin County, Pa. About 1802 the six brothers settled in north- western Coitsville ,and south-western Hubbard townships, where their youngest sister, Rebecca, who married Robert Lowry, joined tfiera later, with her older sister, Sarah. William Stewart settled in Coitsville, and William Houston, Joseph Jackson and William Stewart were the first Board of Trustees of Coits- ville Township. This family were memibers of the Associate Church in Adams Coun- ty, and had heard Rev. David Goodwillie's father preach when they were young men. They were .among Ihe founders 'Of the Liberty Church at Seceder Corners which was organized (1S05) by the Rev. James Dun- can of Mahoning, William Stewart of Coitsville and James Davidson of Youngstown, b^ing the first elders. William and Sarah Stewart had eight children, of whom the oldest, Sarah raa.ried Johnstone Dowry of Poland Cen'^'^r; th'* third, Rol)ert, married Jane Lowry of Lowellville, and the youngest, Margaret, married Robert Lowry, also of the Lowellville I'amily. These marriages of the Lowrys and Stewarts are examples of the inter-marriages among pioneer neighbors by which many of the later generations of our family have be- come related in several different ways. THE LEIPSIC LOUTIYS This branch of the f.amily came to Putnam County, (organized 1834) while it was yet in its infancy. Thoy found a p.imeval forest. in the midst of which they established their home. The Indians were their neighbors and their friends. The soil was of the rich black variety which has since brought fame to this section of Ohio because of its fer- tility. They cleared the land and tilled the soil, working with a per- severance and deteimiuatiou that gave their children an inheritance- of broad acres. They soon identified themselves with the interests of Leipsic. Coming to this place while the children were yet young, the family grow into the ver>' life of the community and here, in turn, established their homes; gave officers to church and county, and won for themselves places of leadership. Here these children of Robert and Rebecca Dow- ry grew to maturity: R - I. Robert Johnson Lowry. R - HI. Mary Johnson Lowry. R - XL Jame.s Dowry. R - IV. Sarah Jane Lowry. The original home farm has pas.-led into the hands of strangers, and few of the descendants live in the vicinity. Merchants, farmers and some of the professions are represented among later generations. In man: states of the union wo find their homes preserving in the main the tra- ditions of a loyal Scotch-Irish ancestry. TuLtloe THK IÂ»0:Â»L.\\ri RIDfiK CHUUrH w.as organized on the fourth Sabbath of October, 183G, by Rev. Samuel Wilson, Missionary of the Presbtery of iVIianii, who ^'isited the settlement of Associate Church members. Amons; the charter members admitted were James Strain and family on certificate from the Poland Center Church ,and Nicholas McConnell and others from the Associate Congre- gation of Newton, Portage Co\\inty, Ohio. On Saturday November fifth, 155 3 6, at the house of David Hostetter, was held an election of elders which resulted in the choice of Nicholas McConnell and James Strain who had been ordained in the congrega- tions from which they came. On the following day, at the house of Hugh Ramsey, these elders were installed, and the members agreed that this church should be the Associata Congregation of Poplar Ridge and a building of poplar logs was erected. On August fifth, 1837, at a meeting of the session. Rev. James Wallace, moderator pro tern, at the home of Nicholas McConnell, the following members, Robert Lowry, and his wife, Rebecca Lowry and their son, Robert J. Lowry, were received on certificate from Poland Center and the other members of the family united with this congrega- tion within the a:xt t./u or three years, and many of the Putnam County Lowrys aua tiicir family connections have been officers, teachers and active members of this congregation. The location of the church was changed (1856) from McConnell's Corners to Leipsic, and since the Union the organization (1858) has been the United Presbyterian Church of Leipsic. R â€” I. ROBERT JOHXSOX LO\\\\TlY was born September tenth, 1816, at Poland Center. He married, De- cember twenty-sixth, 1838, Olive A. McConnell, During the early part of his life he was a farmer near Leipsic and ran a store on his farm in connection therewith. In 1850 he moved to Leipsic opening a general store which he owned for several years. In 1861 he moved his family to Urbana, Ohio, conducting a similar business there. He died at Ur- bana, April thirteenth, 1862, of rheumatism of the heart. His body was brought to Leipsic, and buried in the McConnell cemetery. R. J. Lowry was a man of large stature, standing six feet two inches, broad shouldered and well proportioned. Like his father he en- joyed reading and spent his spare time in this way. He was a lover of music and with Isaac McConnell his sister's husband led the singing in the old Associate Church at McConnell's corners and afterward at Leip- sic. He was sociajble, hospitable and public-spirited. In politics he was a Repuiblicun and filled for some eight or ten years the office of Justice of the Peace. He served the ciiurch as deacon for several years, and both he and his wife were mombe.s of the Leipsic United Presby- terian Church, and the members of hTs family, for t\"he most part, still adhere to this faith. 'Chlrleen OT.n'E A. >IrOONXELL was born January twenty-forth. 1819, at Windham, Portage County, Ohio, being the daughter of Nicholas McConnell. Her father in 1836 moved with his family to Liberty To-wnship, Putnam County, Ohio, then an almost unbroken forest Here he bought a large tract of land near what is now known as Leipaic.

Fift),fo THE LO^^^:LL\\^LT,E FAMILY AVITiLTAM LOWUY the fifth child of ROBERT LOWRY and MARY JOHNSTONE, was born October eleventh, 1784, at Killyleagh, came to this country in 1804 with his parents and was married, March twenty-third, 18 09, to Mary Hous- ton, daughter of William Houston, of Coitsville. After their marriage they lived on a part of the Poland Center farm until their homestead farm at Lowellville was bought March elev- enth, 1813. They moved to this place in the summer of 1813 and made it their permanent home. On June second, 1825, he received from his father-in-law a deed for a second farm iu Kinsman Township, Trumbull County, Ohio, and on December eighth, 182 5, he bought a third farm in Coitsville township and thus provided a farm for each of his three sons. So far as known he never held any public office, but a list of those from Poland Township who served in the war of 1812 includes the name of William Lowry. He was a member of the church at Kilmore, and became a member of the Poland Center Church at its organization. William Liovfiy had a common school education, understood music and was a good singer. He was of medium height, with smooth face, dark hair and blue eyes. He is said to have been quiet and unassum- ing in manneir and a very kind, good natured man. William Lowry died November third, 1827, of quick consumption brought on by exposure during a trip with a wagon-train to Lake Erie for neighborhood supplies, and is buried in the Deer Creek graveyard. MARY HOUSTOX wife of WILLLVM LOWRY, Is entitle)d to more than a passing notice, being the first, but by no means the last, of the remarkable women of our family, who bereaved by death took up the responsibilities of widow- hood and made good. She was born at Pequay, Lancaster Couaty, Pennsylvania, on May eighteenth, 1785, and when a young girl was brought by her parents to Coitsville where she married William Lowry. After eighteen years of married life she was left a widow with the care of nine minor children. A wom,an of strong will and business ability, she assumed the manage- ment of the estate which had been entrusted to her by the will of her husband, reared her large family of children and kept tree from debt. Her familiar name was \"Polly\" among her relatives and friends. She .was of medium height and slender build, with dark hair and blue eyes. She was a woman of more than ordinary learning and was al- ways in good health but became deaf in her old age. All her grandchil- dren will remember the ear trumpet into which was often shouted a de- mand for a Bible story or more often for a bear story â€” the Bible and the bear both appearing in her warning masterpiece about Elisha and the little heathen children who mocked the prophet of the Lord. On May Twentieth, 187 6, fifty years after the death of her husband, she died of the infirmities of age, at the home of her daughter Margaret Cowden and was laid to rest iu the Deer Creek graveyaid. Ftfti)-fllM TFrE HOrSTOX 1 A.MIY were of Scotch descent. Their original settlement in this country was at Pequay, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. William Houston, (1757- 1834), the father of Mary Lowry, was born in Scotland while his parents were on a visit to that country. He was a soldier in the revolutionary war and was a prisoner on the Brifish prison ship off Long Island. He married Jane Watson (1760-1841) and about 1800 moved to Coitsville. He was an elder in the Deer Creek Church and one of the prominent men of the vicinity. In the burying ground across from the site of the old church, his dust lits awaiting the resurrection call, and the horizonital slab above bears the following rich memorial: In memory of WILLIAM HOUSTON, Esq. Who departed this life Dec. 28, 1834, Aged seventy seven years and seven months After devoting his early life to the service of his country And hi.s later years to the service of hiÂ«> ^ofi They had nine children of whom David Houston and his family have been most associated with our branch of the Lowry family as he settled at the same date on a farm adjoining the Lowry farm at Lowel- ville. He became an extensive land owner and was State Represen- tative for several years beginning in 1849. He was an elder ftrst at Poland Center, and built the old brick church but about 1859 transfer- red to the Mahoning Church where he served as elder until 18 63 when he was suspended for \"pro slavery principles and adherence to the Dem- ocratic party,\" after which he went to the more tolerant Presbyterian Church.. He died in 1872 and is buried at Poland Center. He was married three times and by his third wife, Margaret Cowden, had eleven children many of whose descendants still live in the neighborhood Fiftv-Mix THE LOW'ELIA n.LE LOWRYS The homestead farm of this branch of the family, situated on the north hill at Lowellville, overlooked the site of the present village, and afforded a view for miles up and down and across the valley, where in the days of our grandfather flowed a river of clear water. A century later a lifeless stream runs stained with the wastes of cities, and the valley is clouded by the smoke of great industries and world wide traffic. On this farm were reared by their mother the nine children of William Lowry: W-I. Jane Lowry W-II. Mary Johnstone Lowry W-III. Amy Houston Lowry W-IV. Martha Ann Lowry w-v Robert Lowry W-VI. Margaret Lowry W-VII. William Houston Lowry W-VIII. TamP\"^ Johnson Lowry W-IX Elizabeth Lowry This was a home keeping family. There were no wanderers among them. All were born and all married, lived and died within a few miles of the Lowellville farm, which is the only land that has de- scended in the family name from the original survey to the present time. Fift))-t THE OI>D â€¢'TENT\" CHinOI The Mahoning Church, which many of our family joined after the union of 1858, is across the state line in Mahoning Township, Pa. The congregation grew out of house-to-house prayer-meetings held by the early settlers. This is the oldest congregation in this region and was organized as early as 1798 by the Rev. James Duncan, who regardless of orthodox doctrine, presbyterial authority or personal habits, became the great home missionary of this part of the country and the founder of many churches wherein the gospel is still proclaimed with sincerity. The original congregation was composed of both Associate and As- sociate Reformed members. They worshiped in a grove where the pulpit was covered by a tent of boughs for the shelter and dignity of the minis- ter and the singing clerks. Thus came the name \"Old Tent Church.\" In 1808 the Associate members including Samuel McBride, who was clerk of the session, William Houston, Robert Walker, and James Shields, established the Deer Ci'oek Church and left the McFarlands, the McWilliarijij, the Dicksons, and other Associate Fteformed members in possession at Manoning. The Associate Reformed congregation called the Rev. Mr. Galloway to Mahoning and (1800) built a log church and about the same time the \"Tent\" school house, was built in the same grove. In 1850 was built the plain frame church wherein some of us received our first Sabbath school lessens. There is remembered also a great spring which gushed out of the rock and the shady woods, more attractive to the boys oftentimes than the sermon and the Sabbath school. Fif^-elfht THE DEER CREEK CHURCH to which nearly all of our Coitsville relatives belonged, had a rather tur- bulent history during its first half century. It appears in the records and writings of Uncle John Shields as a forum where every theological, moral and political issue was contended to the bitter end. After the inevitable split at Mahoning, a log church was built (1810) at Deer Creek, and the Rev. James Duncan divided his time among Deer Creek, Poland Center and Liberty until 1815 when his li- cense was revoked by the Associate Synod for erroneous doctrine, and he thereupon moved on west. Then came the Rev. Robert Douglas who died young (1823) in the year the first frame church was finished. The Rev. David Goodwillie ministered to Deer Creek (1825-1832) and resigned. The congregation next called Rev. James Ramsey (1834-1855) as pastor of Deer Creek only. During this pastorate the controversies about occasional hearing, the lining out of the Psalms and the introduc- tion of new tunes, became intense and finally culminated in a bitter struggle ovpr the slavery question, even to nailing down tlie church win- dows .and barricading its doors to prevent abolition meetings. The pro- slavery faction eventually were defeated and immediately seceded. Some of them founded the Beulah Church under Rev. Thomas Mehard, but others, including the maternal grandfather of the writer, never set their feet again within the door of any church. During all these years the Deer Creek spring bubbled peacefully up into its placid little pool â€” more placid than the troubled face of the min- ister or elder who stooped to drink from it â€” and in 1858 Deer Creek, iBeulah and Mahoning, with Poland Center and Liberty, .all came together as a congregation of the United Presbyterian Church.
