His \"Foster Father\" James Lowry aka Lawrie (Lowary) was found in the 1851 Census but it would seem that only the Agricultural portion survived (so no Robert could be located in the household portion). James Lowry owned land (6th consession of Beverly) next to William McGuire, who may be a relative (father or brother) Sarah McGuire of the woman who cared for Robert in his youth; wife of James Lowry.\n\nResidences\n\nLack of previous Census history makes it difficult to understand why Robert shows up in the 1861 Canada Census in Ontario living in the home of Sarah Lowry (no apparent relation or connection other than Sarah's husband's surname Lowry matches). Sarah's mother Elizbet McGuire also lived in the one storey log cabin and the household was considered one family. [1] The household was enumerated as follows:\n\nSarah Lowry Ireland no religion 50 F Widow\n\nElisbth McGure Ireland Church of England 80 F Widow\n\nRobt Lowry U Canada Church of England 14 M Single\n\nThe family unit is transformed when after the census in 1861 Sarah McGuire (relict Lowry) remarried James T. Smith. Robert remained in the household with them.\n\nThe family was found in the 1871 Census in Beverly, Hamilton-Wentworth, Ontario. [2], Robert (age 24) is still listed with the \"new family\" along with another household member (no apparent relation) Sophia Sutherland aged 11. The elders are listed as both being 60 years old. Robert states in this Census that he is Irish and that his Religion is the Church of England and that his birthplace is Ontario. The household was enumerated as follows:\n\nSmith, James T M 60 Ireland E. Meth. Irish Farmer Married\n\nSmith, Serrah F 60 Ireland C. of E. Irish - Married\n\nLowry, Robert M 24 Ontario C. of E. Irish Laborer -\n\nSutherland, Sophia, F, 11, Ontario, C. of Eng, Scottish, Going to School.\n\nMarriage (1)\n\nRobert first married Margaret Pringle on June 3, 1874 in Galt, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. He was 27 and she was 22. Only Margaret's parents (Robert and Elizabeth Pringle) are noted in the marriage document. Witnesses were David Bell and Ellen McClenangher. Both Robert and Margaret Pringle were Presbyterian. They were married by Rev'd D. Smyth. [3] Margaret died after the birth of their first son James Kenneth in June 1875.\n\nChildren with Maggie Pringle\n\nJames Kenneth, b.15 June 1875\n\nRobert's Baptism\n\nRobert chose to be Baptised on 5 Mar 1877 in Wentworth, Beverly Twp, Canada.\n\nMarriage (2)\n\nWhen Robert was 30 years old he secondly married, 18 year old Margaret Smith (a possible relation to Sarah McGuires's second husband James T. Smith) (see above). She was the daughter of Mary and Andrew Smith. The couple wed on October 3, 1877 by the hand of Rev'd Robert C Parson's in the residence of Margaret's father Andrew Smith in Beverly, Wentworth, Ontario, Canada. The Bride and Groom are now Methodists. The Witnesses were Alexander Smith and Phebe Smith.[4] Robert's parents are not mentioned in this record either.\n\nChildren with Maggie Smith\n\nWilliam Thomas Lowry\n\nSarah Jane (Lowry) Baker\n\nAlbert John Lowry\n\nMaryAnn (Lowry) Kitchen\n\nMaggie Lowry\n\nGeorge Lowry\n\nCharles Lowry\n\nSusan (Lowry) Campbell\n\nMorgan Lowry\n\nLorne Lowry\n\nRose Lowry\n\nElla (Lowry) Campbell\n\nResidences after Marriage to Maggie Smith\n\nThe family was found in the 1881 Canada Census in Beverly, Gore[5] this new little family are on their way and James Kenneth is completely accepted and loved and cherished by his new mother, Margaret Smith. The family is living in Beverly, Wentworth North, Ontario. The household was enumerated as follows:\n\nRobert 34 Farmer E. Methodist\n\nMargaret 22\n\nJames Kenneth 5\n\nWilliam 2\n\nSarah Jane 1\n\nGeorge Ladle, 23\n\nThe family was found in the 1891 Canada Census in Ontario.[6]The household was eumerated as follows:\n\nRobert M 45 Married Head Ontario Parents: - Meth. Farmer\n\nMargaret F 32 Married Wife Ontario Parents:Scotland\n\nJames M 15 Single Son Ontario Parents: Ontario\n\nWilliam T.

Smith's) Will as \"friend\". He and James Kenneth (Robert's child by Margaret Pringle) are the beneficiaries.\n\nFrom the Pioneers of Beverly, Series of Sketches: \"Then going up the stone road west from Rockton we come to the farm that Calvin More settled on . There are none of this family here at present , but the farm is owned by W. Stockwell and Andrew Smith. Farther west we come to the farm that was settled on by James T. Smith, who has been dead for some years . Robert Lowry is now upon the farm.\"[7]\n\nThe family was found in the 1901 Canada Census in Ontario.[8]The household was enumerated as follows:\n\nRobert M Head M 01 Feb 1847 54 O Irish Irish Methodist\n\nMargert F Wife M 20 Feb 1859 42 O Irish Irish Methodist\n\nMary A F Dau S 28 Aug 1883 17 O Irish Irish Methodist\n\nGeorge M Son S 23 May 1887 13 O Irish Irish Methodist\n\nCharles M Son S 16 Mar 1889 12 O Irish Irish Methodist\n\nSuzie F Dau S 17 Sep 1891 9 O Irish Irish Methodist\n\nMorgan M Son S 03 Mar 1894 7 O Irish Irish Methodist\n\nLorne M Son S 04 Jul 1896 4 O Irish Irish Methodist\n\nElla F Dau S 28 Mar 1900 1 O Irish Irish Methodist\n\nIt is believed in 1903 this resilient family headed to Alberta. It is thought that the family followed eldest son James Kenneth who had gone to the Edmonton area. They settled in Strathcona, Alberta, Canada which is today, the Red Deer area.\n\nThe family was found in the 1906 Alberta Census in Canada.[9] The household was enumerated as follows:\n\nRobert 59,\n\nMargaret 48\n\nWilliam 27\n\nFlorence (Williams wife)\n\nWilliam 5 (William and Florence's son, born in Ontario).\n\nGeorge 19,\n\nCharles 17,\n\nSussie 14\n\nMorgan 12\n\nLorne is 11\n\nElla 6 is on the next page of the 1906 Census from the rest of the family.[10].\n\nNote: In the 1906 Census the Census Enumerator started to fill in the forms for the Rieken family but crossed it out. They are related to the Lowry's and Degraff's as well.\n\nThe family was found in the 1911 Alberta Canada Census.[11] The household was enumerated as follows:\n\nRobert M Head M 64 Feb 1846 Ont Irish (Interesting - y.o.b. is different)\n\nMaggie F Wife M 52 Feb 1859 Ont Scot\n\nSusie F Dau S 19 Sep 1892 Ont Irish\n\nMorgan M son S 17 Mar 1895 Ont Irish\n\nLorne M Son S 14 Jul 1896 Ont Irish\n\nElla F Dau S 11 Mar 1900 Ont Irish\n\nThe family was found in the 1916 Alberta Canada Census.[12] The household was enumerated as follows:\n\nRobert Head M M 69 Ont Meth\n\nMargaret Wife F M 55 Ont Meth\n\nSusie Dau F S 23 Ont Meth\n\nLorne Son M S 19 Ont Meth\n\nElla Dau F S 16 Ont Meth\n\nDeath and Interment\n\nIn 1919, Robert fell from a Horse and Buggy and hit his head on a rock. His son William Thomas was with him and it is said he passed on quickly.\n\nRobert Lowry was interred in the Great Bend Cemetery, Delburne, Red Deer Census Division, Alberta, Canada[13][14]\n\nLetters from Family\n\nA letter written by William (Bill) Harold Lowry in the late 70's or early 80's when Bill lived in Niagara Falls, Ontario. \"Grandpa Lowry [Robert 1847-1919] was Irish. He was a lumber jack in Michigan USA. He lived at Rockton, Ontario (near Galt). Rockton is now call Cambridge, Ont. It is located West of Toronto. He moved to a farm somewhere just east of Brantford, Ont. Then moved to Alberta in 1903. Just two years before my father (William T.) and dad's oldest sister moved out West - Mother (Florence Racher Lowry) and I and Aunt Sarah (Mrs. Harry Baker) and Willard and Alvin went out on the train. Grandpa Lowry (Robert) met us at Red Deer (AB) the nearest railroad station. The railroad was built from Lacombe in 1906 to Erskine, Stettler or farther. This was some year, first Brige [sic: bridge] w [sic: was] built over the Red Deer River at Content. I believe Willard Baker lives in Delborne, Alta. Grandpa Lowry died in 1919 just before Lorne Lowry got home from first world war. In 1914, Lorne married Olive Johnston [sic: Jestin] not too far from Grandpa's home. Dad (William T) was in Saskatchewan - went out on the Harvest Excursion then came to grandpa's a few days later. Granddad Lowry cut logs for the Barn in 1910. Let them dry and squared them with a broad ax. Every timber in the barn - he was 64 years old. He built the stone house in 1910, the barn in 1913. Uncle Harry (Baker) has relatives near Brantford, Ontario.\"\n\nNote: Robert is the second great grandfather (4 degrees) of PM Lowry-3068\n\nResearch Notes\n\nQuestions about Robert 1847\n\nWhy did Robert put \"unknown\" in the parent spot in both of his marriage records? He had to have been old enough to understand and be angry about something that had happened.\n\nIt was also rumored that he hated his \"step father\" ('he was a mean one') and that he left at age 13 or 14.\n\nSarah Smith (relict Lowry; nee McGuire and James' Will\n\nFostered Robert Lowry from at least 1861.\n\nWas Sarah McGuire's husband James Lowry related to Hamilton Lowry?? yes, it seems he was Hamilton's son.\n\nNeither Sarah McGuire nor her husband James Lowry could write so their Will's were signed with an X LOWERY, James Wentworth 1234 1856 MS 638, Reel 19\n\nAccording to family research: James Lowry's Will bequeaths everything to his wife Sarah (nee McGuire) and after her death, all was to be sold and divided equally amongst the children of his sister Ann Logan in Livingston Co. New York State.\n\nAs Robert was found in the home of Sarah McGuire/relict Lowry/relict Smith from 1861 on, this information about Ann Logan in the Will may be pertinent.\n\nQuestions about Ann Logan\n\nJames Smith and Sarah Smith (relict Lowry, nee McGuire) Will's state that Robert is a \"friend\" and name Robert and his son James Kenneth as Sole beneficiaries. \\\n\nWhat happened with James request of dividing things between Ann and all her children? It appears only Robert 1847 inherited so this needs to be researched.\n\nDid Ann die as a Logan or other?\n\nWhere did Ann Logan (sister mentioned in James Lowry's Will) disappear to?Was she actually the mother of Robert 1847?\n\nDid Ann and her husband Mr. Logan immigrate from Ireland to the US instead of to Canada like everyone else? Which Logan did she marry? Was this marriage a second marriage for her?\n\nWas Ann the only sister of James? Not if James was Hamilton's son.\n\nWas Ann Logan a Twin to James?\n\nGreen or Gould Family Rumor\n\nAs told to Clint Lowry and shared by letter in 1989 with PM Lowry-3068. \"It was once told to me but we are not shure, [sic: sure] that he was sent over from Ireland by his parents to a family by name of Smith. It is also said he was later adopted by a family called Lowry and that his real name was Green. Apparently, he [Robert 1847] became a rather famous Canadian Runner and when his family in Ireland wanted to associate with him again - he rejected them and maintained his adopted name of Lowry. Another story is that either the family Smith or a family Green adopted him but he kept his own real name Lowry. We can't find out which story, if either, is true.\"\n\nThe rumors in the family include the name Green and the only Green in the area was one born in 1811 who married a Margaret Gould born in 1845 (who it is speculated may be this Robert's sibling).\n\nResearch shows only 1 child named Robert born in 1847 in Ancaster who was a Gould as well.\n\nSearching for a Robert age 4 in Ancaster, Ontario in the 1851 Census provided 1 clue only. A Robert Gould. Also if one views the 1851 Census included herewith, [15]Enumeration does not provide splits for households. The following is surmised to be the same home:\n\nEliza Gould Spinster C East 27\n\nMargaret Gould Dau. C East 6 (Married a Green)\n\nRobert Gould Son C East 4\n\nLibius Curtis Dau C East 5\n\nJoseph Curtis Son C EAst 3\n\nAll of the above were W. Methodists.\n\nIreland\n\nThere was a record that was found online of a Robert Malcom Lowry born in 1847 in Ireland, parents \"'Samuel Lowry and Mabel Malcom.\"' Birth date is off but then that may just be coincidence or Robert changed his month and day of birth to reflect his entering James Lowry and Sarah McGuire's home. Note: The name Malcom seems to run in the family Name: Robert Malcom Lowry Gender: Male Birth Date: 19 Jul 1847 Birth Place: Presbyterian, Boardmills, Down, Ireland Father: Samuel Lowry Mother: Mabel Malcom FHL Film Number: 823750\n\nRobert Malcom may have died in Canada. (it was an ancestry profile so I could not access to see it it was a manual entry or an actual proper source document) If so and it was 1919, this is our brick wall solution!\n\nLowry/Caseley Family\n\nHamilton Lowry who was 3 in the 1851 Canada Census, does not show up with his family in the 1861 Census, nor was there a death record found. It is a possiblity that he is this Robert. Hamilton's parents were Robert Lowry and Isabella Caseley. (possibly Robert Lowry and Isabella Caseley. (surmised because their son Hamilton of similar age is missing from 1861 w/o death record.)\n\nLazarus Lowry Lineage\n\nAug 22/22: https://archive.org/stream/lowrysrobertmary00lowr/lowrysrobertmary00lowr_djvu.txt\n\nAfter looking at information on the Poland, Ohio, USA Lowry family tree perhaps this family is part of the missing link of: James Lowery b 1778 in Ireland whose family settled in Poland Ohio...and the same one that moved to Baltimore after marrying someone who offended his father. The story everyone spoke about in my family \"back when\", was the family wouldn't have anything to do with someone and so they lost contact. That very same family (the Poland group)...don't know if they are related to Lazarus Lowry yet of course...however someone out there thinks My line is related but I have to find a few missing links first. According to that other person...\n\nIt is believed that Lazarous b. 1688 in Scotland went to Ireland and had a son named William b. 1724 who had a son named Robert b. 1749 who had a son named James b 1778 (the one who ceased contact with family) and who may have had a son named James D. b. ~1818 it is possible that he had a son who could be our Robert b. 1847 who shows up in Canada at age 4 in 1851\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"Ontario Census, 1861,\" database, (https://central.bac-lac.gc.ca/.item/?app=Census1861&op=img&id=4108432_00701): 03 May 2023), Robert Lowrey, Beverly, Wentworth, Ontario, Canada; citing p. 109, line 36; Library and Archives Canada film number C-1086, Public Archives, Toronto; FHL microfilm 349,334.\n\n↑ \"Canada Census, 1871,\" database, http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/1871/jpg/4396609_00016.jpg : 24 October 2018), Robert Lowry in household of James T Smith, Beverly, Hamilton-Wentworth, Ontario, Canada; citing 1871; citing National Archives of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\n↑ \"Ontario Marriages, 1869-1927,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FMNZ-QP4 : 11 March 2018), Robert Lowry and Margaret Pringle, 03 Jun 1874; citing registration , Galt, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Archives of Ontario, Toronto; FHL microfilm 1,862,894.\n\n↑ \"Ontario Marriages, 1869-1927,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FMJ9-7JP : 11 March 2018), Robert Lowry and Margaret Smith, 03 Oct 1877; citing registration , Beverly, Wentworth, Ontario, Canada, Archives of Ontario, Toronto; FHL microfilm 1,863,651.\n\n↑ \"Canada Census, 1881,\" database with images, http://data2.collectionscanada.gc.ca/e/e328/e008189823.jpg : 4 October 2018), Robert Lowry, Beverly, Gore, Upper Canada, British Colonial America; from \"1881 Canadian Census.\" Database with images.
