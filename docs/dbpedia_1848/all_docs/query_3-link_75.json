Download Sample Control VCF File\n\nOptional VCF containing variants to be excluded from analysis.\n\nMust be.vcf, .vcf.gz, or a formatted text file with variants to ignore.\n\nThe text file should be a tab-delimeted .txt file with 4 columns:\n\nChromosome Number/Identifier\n\nPosition\n\nReference Allelle\n\nAlternate Allele\n\nNote: Please make sure your chromosomes identifiers are in [1,2,3,4] format, rather than [chr1, chr2, chr3] format.\n\nspecifics on formatted variants text file...\n\nClick to upload pedigree file... Download Sample PED\n\nThe PED file is tab delimited with 6 mandatory columns:\n\nFamily ID\n\nIndividual ID\n\nPaternal ID (0=unknown)\n\nMaternal ID (0=unknown)\n\nSex (1=male; 2=female; other=unknown)\n\nPhenotype (1=unaffected; 2=affected, other=unknown)\n\n(NO header is expected)\n\nIDs are alphanumeric: individuals in the same family should have the same family ID; the individual ID should\n\nuniquely identify a person regardless of family ID, and\n\nmatch one of the sample IDs in VCF file(s) referring to the same person.\n\n(!) Any IDs found in the VCF file NOT in the pedigree will be treated as control\n\nAn optional seventh column can specify the ethnicity of the person. This column is important to choose population-specific allele frequency for the filtering of variants that are rare in the specific ethnicity group of that person. An ethnicity identifier consists of a frequency database name and a population code linked by \"_\". For example, exac_AMR refers to American in ExAC database, and exac_ALL refers to overall frequency in ExAC database.\n\nA list of available ethnicity identifiers available in our analysis:\n\nExAC 1000 Genomes ESP6500 TAGC exac_ALL: Overall kg_ALL: Overall esp_ALL: Overall tagc_AJ: Ashkenazi exac_AFR: African/African American kg_AFR: African esp_AA: African American exac_AMR: Latino kg_AMR: Ad Mixed American esp_EA: European American exac_EAS: East Asian kg_EAS: East Asian exac_FIN: Finnish kg_EUR: European exac_NFE: Non-Finnish European kg_SAS: South Asian exac_SAS: South Asian exac_OTH: Other\n\nIf none of the above identifiers found in the seventh column, exac_ALL will be used as default frequency database and ethnicity group for the allele frequency filtering.\n\nspecifics on .ped format customization...\n\nHuman Genome Build\n\nGRCh38\n\nGRCh37\n\n*** Data submitted to GeMSTONE has a 2 month expiration date, after which it will be deleted from our servers.
