Myeloid malignancies are clonal diseases of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Myeloid tumors represent the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer in economically developed countries. The majority of myeloid tumors contain high numbers of somatic mutations, which are genetic changes that are not inherited but created within the tumor itself. Unlike inherited “germline” mutations, these somatic mutations are not transmitted to offspring. Somatic mutations significantly contribute to the pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis of myeloid malignancies.\n\nNo. of genes: 35 TAT: 10 business days Coverage: ≥97.00% ≥200x\n\nOrder now Sample Requirements\n\nGene OMIM (Gene) Associated diseases (OMIM) Inheritance ASXL1 612990 Bohring-Opitz syndrome AD Myelodysplastic syndrome, somatic - ATM 607585 Breast cancer, susceptibility to AD, SM Ataxia-telangiectasia AR CBL 165360 Noonan syndrome-like disorder with or without juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia AD ?Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia AD, SM CDKN2A 600160 Melanoma and neural system tumor syndrome AD Melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome AD Melanoma, cutaneous malignant, 2 AD CEBPA 116897 ?Leukemia, acute myeloid AD, SM Leukemia, acute myeloid, somatic - CREBBP 600140 Menke-Hennekam syndrome 1 AD Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 1 AD DNMT3A 602769 Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome AD Heyn-Sproul-Jackson syndrome AD Acute myeloid leukemia, somatic - ETV6 600618 Leukemia, acute myeloid, somatic - Thrombocytopenia 5 AD EZH2 601573 Weaver syndrome AD FLT3 136351 Leukemia, acute lymphoblastic, somatic - Leukemia, acute myeloid, reduced survival in, somatic - Leukemia, acute myeloid, somatic - GATA2 137295 Myelodysplastic syndrome, susceptibility to - Leukemia, acute myeloid, susceptibility to AD, SM Emberger syndrome AD Immunodeficiency 21 AD HRAS 190020 Thyroid carcinoma, follicular, somatic - Spitz nevus or nevus spilus, somatic - Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome, somatic mosaic - Bladder cancer, somatic - Costello syndrome AD Nevus sebaceous or woolly hair nevus, somatic - Congenital myopathy with excess of muscle spindles AD IDH1 147700 Glioma, susceptibility to, somatic - IDH2 147650 D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria 2 - JAK2 147796 Erythrocytosis, somatic - Polycythemia vera, somatic - Leukemia, acute myeloid, somatic - Thrombocythemia 3 AD, SM Budd-Chiari syndrome, somatic - Myelofibrosis, somatic - KIT 164920 Gastrointestinal stromal tumor, familial AD, IC Germ cell tumors, somatic - Piebaldism AD Leukemia, acute myeloid, somatic - Mastocytosis, systemic, somatic - Mastocytosis, cutaneous AD KRAS 190070 Arteriovenous malformation of the brain, somatic - Gastric cancer, somatic - Oculoectodermal syndrome, somatic - RAS-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disorder AD Gastric cancer, somatic - Pancreatic carcinoma, somatic - Lung cancer, somatic - Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome 2 AD Bladder cancer, somatic - Leukemia, acute myeloid, somatic - Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome, somatic mosaic - Breast cancer, somatic - Noonan syndrome 3 AD NF1 613113 Watson syndrome AD Leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic AD, SM Neurofibromatosis, type 1 AD Neurofibromatosis, familial spinal AD Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome AD NOTCH1 190198 Adams-Oliver syndrome 5 AD Aortic valve disease 1 AD NPM1 164040 Leukemia, acute myeloid, somatic - NRAS 164790 Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome, somatic mosaic - Colorectal cancer, somatic - Neurocutaneous melanosis, somatic - ?RAS-associated autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome type IV, somatic - Noonan syndrome 6 AD Melanocytic nevus syndrome, congenital, somatic - Thyroid carcinoma, follicular, somatic - Epidermal nevus, somatic - PDGFRB 173410 Myeloproliferative disorder with eosinophilia AD Myofibromatosis, infantile, 1 AD Premature aging syndrome, Penttinen type AD Basal ganglia calcification, idiopathic, 4 AD Kosaki overgrowth syndrome AD PHF6 300414 Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome XLR PTPN11 176876 Leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic, somatic - LEOPARD syndrome 1 AD Metachondromatosis AD Noonan syndrome 1 AD RAD21 606462 Cornelia de Lange syndrome 4 AD ?Mungan syndrome AR RUNX1 151385 Leukemia, acute myeloid AD, SM Platelet disorder, familial, with associated myeloid malignancy AD SF3B1 605590 Myelodysplastic syndrome, somatic - SMC1A 300040 Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 85, with or without midline brain defects XLD Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2 XLD SMC3 606062 Cornelia de Lange syndrome 3 AD STAG2 300826 Mullegama-Klein-Martinez syndrome XL Holoprosencephaly 13, X-linked XLD, XLR TET2 612839 Myelodysplastic syndrome, somatic - Immunodeficiency 75 AR TP53 191170 Hepatocellular carcinoma, somatic - Bone marrow failure syndrome 5 AD Basal cell carcinoma 7 AD Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, somatic - Choroid plexus papilloma AD Glioma susceptibility 1 AD, SM Pancreatic cancer, somatic - Breast cancer, somatic - Li-Fraumeni syndrome AD Adrenocortical carcinoma, pediatric AD Osteosarcoma SM Colorectal cancer AD, SM WT1 607102 Denys-Drash syndrome AD, SM Mesothelioma, somatic - Frasier syndrome AD, SM Meacham syndrome AD Wilms tumor, type 1 AD, SM Nephrotic syndrome, type 4 AD\n\nOur solid tumor panel provides full sequencing of 106 selected cancer-associated genes as well as the hotspot analysis of relevant cancer regions in 43 genes. It detects over 5,000 validated oncogenic variants and includes the latest evidence-based variants associated with treatment decisions in solid tumors. The panel has more than 25 genes with approved targeted therapies or those that are being currently tested in clinical trials. Furthermore, somatic variants with an impact on prognosis of the individual tumor or on the efficacy of standard anti-tumor therapy are captured. It covers more than 100 different types of somatic cancers, including adrenal, colon, hepatic, prostate, renal, skin, testicular, thyroid, glioma, esophageal, endometrial, and breast cancer, among others. The panel provides a better understanding of tumor behavior as well as its likelihood to respond to a treatment, contributing to tailored medicine for the patient, thus frequently leading to a better outcome or reduced adverse effects.\n\nNo. of genes: 149 TAT: 10 business days Coverage: ≥97.00% ≥200x Details:\n\nHotspot analysis (somatic) via NGS: ALK, ARAF, AXL, BTK, CBL, CCND1, CDK6, ERCC2, ESR1, FLT3, FOXL2, GATA2, H3-3A, H3C2, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, KNSTRN, MAGOH, MAP2K4, MAPK1, MAX, MDM4, MED12, MYC, MYCN, MYD88, NTRK1, NTRK2, PDGFRB, PIK3CB, PPP2R1A, RAC1, RAF1, RHEB, RHOA, ROS1, SF3B1, STAT3, TERT, TOP1, U2AF1, XPO1\n\nOrder now Sample Requirements\n\nGene OMIM (Gene) Associated diseases (OMIM) Inheritance ABL1 189980 Congenital heart defects and skeletal malformations syndrome AD Leukemia, Philadelphia chromosome-positive, resistant to imatinib SM AKT1 164730 Breast cancer, somatic -
