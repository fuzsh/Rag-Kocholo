The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The invention further relates to methods and/or compositions for inhibiting or promoting the production and/or function of the polypeptides of the invention.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n&lsqb;0004&rsqb; The Human Musculoskeletal System is comprised of skeleton (e.g., bone), muscle, tendon, ligament, and other components of joints, which constitute the basic structural framework of the body. Together, the components of this system provide the strength, stability, frame, and elasticity necessary for movement. Additionally, the musculoskeletal system protects the internal organs, stores minerals, and produces blood.\n\n&lsqb;0005&rsqb; The primary component of the musculoskeletal system is the skeleton itself. The skeleton is a highly organized connection of bones responsible for many functions, including supporting the body against gravity, providing sites for muscle attachment, producing blood cells, protecting the organs and other soft body tissues, and permitting flexible movement.\n\n&lsqb;0006&rsqb; Anatomically, two types of bones can be distinguished in the skeleton: flat bones (e.g., skull bones, scapula, manible, and ileum) and long bones (e.g., tibia, femur, and humerus). The long bone is composed of two wider extremities (e.g., the epiphyses), a cylindrical tube in the middle (e.g., the midshaft or diaphysis), and a developmental zone (e.g., the metaphysis) between them. In a growing long bone, the epiphysis and the metaphysis are separated by a layer of cartilage (e.g., epiphyseal cartilage or growth plate), responsible for the longitudinal growth of the bones. The external part of the bones is formed by a layer of calcified tissue (e.g., the cortex or compact bone). In the diaphyisis, the cortex encloses the medullary cavity, the location of the hematopoietic bone marrow. Toward the metaphysis and epiphysis, the cortex becomes progressively thinner, containing a network of thin, calcified trabeculae (e.g., trabecular bone or spongy bone) and hematopoietic bone marrow. At the center of most bones is yellow marrow, which is used to store fats. Therefore, the cortical bone fulfills mainly a mechanical and protective function, and the trabecular bone fulfills a metabolic function.\n\n&lsqb;0007&rsqb; Bone is a balanced, dynamic system, constantly degrading and regenerating. Bone is degraded by cells called osteoclasts that remove from the center of the bone, forming the central cavity of the long bones. Osteoblasts are cells found in the osteoid tissue (e.g., bone matrix prior to calcification) and are responsible for the production of the matrix constituents of bone (e.g., collagen and ground substance). As bone matrix is produced, osteoblasts become progressively embedded and differentiate into osteocytes, or bone cells. As calcification occurs, these osteocytes then differentiate into cortical bone or trabecular bone within the calcified collagen fiber matrix. Blood vessels penetrate the newly calcified bone, bringing the blood supply that will form the hematopoietic bone marrow.\n\n&lsqb;0008&rsqb; Joints are formed when two bones come together and allow for bending and movement. Tough bands of connective tissue, called ligaments, surround the joints, join the two bones together, and keep the bones properly aligned. The joint capsule is lined by a synovial membrane, which produces synovial fluid for lubricating the joint. Joints may also contain fluid-filled sacs (e.g., bursa) that reduce friction in areas where skin, muscles, tendons, and ligaments rub over bones. Most joints are freely moving synovial joints; however, some joints (e.g, vertebrae) are partly movable and allow some some degree of flexibility with cartilage, or menisci, between the bones, while other joints (e.g., skull sutures) do not allow movement at all.\n\n&lsqb;0009&rsqb; Composed of striated bundles of myosin and actin fibers, skeletal muscles have very long fiber-like cells that contract quickly, but only when stimulated by nerve cells. Muscle is attached to the bone by tough connective tissue, called tendons, and arranged in opposing, balancing groups around joints that facilitate balanced movement.\n\n&lsqb;0010&rsqb; Although the musculoskeletal system was designed for strength and endurance, the components of this system can become worn, injured, or inflamed. These disorders can range from mild to severe and from acute to chronic. Generally, the treatment depends on the type and severity of the disorder.\n\n&lsqb;0011&rsqb; Diseases and Disorders of the Bone\n\n&lsqb;0012&rsqb; Several types of bone disorders occur from an imbalance of the growth and breakdown cycles of bone. The most common, osteoporosis, is a progressive decrease in the density of bones, causing them to weaken. Osteoporosis occurs in several different types and is seen more often in older women. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is generally found in women between the ages 51 and 75 and is caused by the lack of estrogen. Senile osteoporosis results not only from the imbalance between growth and breakdown but also from the calcium deficiency associated with age. Secondary osteoporosis is caused by secondary effects of another medical condition (e.g., chronic renal failure, hormonal disorders) or by drugs (e.g., barbiturates, anticonvulsants). Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis is a rare form that occurs in children and young adults who, for no obvious reason, have weak bones. Treatment for all forms of osteoporosis is aimed at increasing bone density (e.g., estrogen intake, bisphosphonates, fluoride supplements).\n\n&lsqb;0013&rsqb; Paget's Disease also results from an imbalance of the growth and breakdown of bone. The turnover rate is areas affected by Paget's Disease increases tremendously; resulting in abnormal, enlarged bone that is soft and weak. Although no specific genetic pattern has been determined, Paget's Disease tends to appear in family lineages. There is no direct treatment for Paget's Disease, rather treatment is given only alleviate pain and discomfort.\n\n&lsqb;0014&rsqb; Bone disorders can also result from infection. Bone can be infected through three routes: bloodstream, direct invasion, and adjacent soft tissue infections. Osteomyelitis is a bone infection usually caused by bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) which results in swelling of the soft bone marrow tissue, compression of the blood vessels, and possibly death of parts of bone. Pott's disease is an infection of the vertebrae by the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, or M. africanum.) For acute infections, antibiotics are generally the most effective treatment for this disease. However, if the infection is severe or chronic, surgery may also be required to remove the infected tissue and replaced with healthy bone, muscle, or skin.\n\n&lsqb;0015&rsqb; Most bone carcinomas are benign. The most common type of benign bone tumor, usually occurring in people aged 10 to 20, is osteochrondroma. Osteochrondromas are growths on the surface of a bone that protrude as hard lumps. Benign chondromas, usually occurring in people aged 10 to 30, develop in the central part of the bone. Chrondroblastomas, usually occurring in people aged 10 to 20, are rare, painful tumors that grow in the ends of bones. Osteoid osteomas are very small tumors that commonly develop in the arms or legs but can occur in any bone. Giant cell tumors, usually occurring in people aged 20-40, most commonly originate in the ends of the bones and may extend into adjacent tissue. Treatment of these tumors generally involves pain management and, possibly, surgery to remove the tumor.\n\n&lsqb;0016&rsqb; Although rare, malignant bone tumors may be primary or metastatic. In children, most malignant bone tumors are primary; in adults, most are metastatic. The most common type of malignant primary tumor, multiple myeloma, originates in the red bone marrow cells and most commonly occurs in older people. Osteosarcoma, usually occurring in people aged 10-20, commonly occurs in or around the knee and cause pain and swelling. These tumors tend to spread to the lungs. Chrondrosarcomas are slow-growing tumors composed of cancerous cartilage cells. Ewing's sarcoma, occurring most commonly in males aged 10 to 20, develop most often in arms and legs. These tumors can become large and can affect the entire length of a bone. Metastatic bone tumors most often originate from breast, lung, prostate, kidney and thyroid cancers.\n\n&lsqb;0017&rsqb; Treatment for bone tumors depends on the type of cancer. Most treatments are complex and involve a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. Prompt treatment is especially important for malignant bone tumors.\n\n&lsqb;0018&rsqb; Diseases and Disorders of Joints, Ligaments, and Tendons\n\n&lsqb;0019&rsqb; The most commonly diseased tissue in the musculoskeletal system is the joint. Disorders affecting the joints and their associated components are considered connective tissue disorders because of the presence of large amounts of connective tissue in these structures. Most of the disorders of joints involve inflammation and may be the result of an immune or autoimmune reaction.\n\n&lsqb;0020&rsqb; Treatment of joint disorders varies according to type and severity. Drug treatment is generally aimed at reducing inflammation. For mild inflammation and pain, drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g., aspirin and ibuprofen) are commonly used. Alternative drug treatments, used in more severe cases, are corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) and immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclophophamide). Other treatment plans, used in conjunction with drugs, include exercise, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery.\n\n&lsqb;0021&rsqb; Arthritis, or inflammation of the joint, occurs in several forms. The most common form of arthritis, characterized by the degeneration of joint cartilage and adjacent bone, is osteoarthritis, or degenerative arthritis. Osteoarthritis causes the formation of rough, pitted cartilage in the joint resulting in limited joint movement, stiffness, and pain.\n\n&lsqb;0022&rsqb; Another form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder, is caused when the immune system attacks the tissue (e.g., ligaments, synovial membrane, bursas) that surrounds the joints. The joints, including those in the extremities, become symmetrically inflamed, resulting in swelling, pain, and eventually, destruction of the interior of the joint. Psoriatic Arthritis, occurring in people who have psorasis, resembles rheumatoid arthritis; however, it doesn't produce the antibodies characteristic of arthritis.\n\n&lsqb;0023&rsqb; Other autoimmune diseases may also affect the joints and tendons. For example, systemic lupus erythematosus may result in episodes of inflammation in the joints and tendons in addition to other connective tissues and organs. Joint inflammation is common with systemic lupus erythematosus and can lead to deformity and permanent damage to the joint and its surrounding tissue; however, the bone does not erode as it does in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n&lsqb;0024&rsqb; Joint disease may also result from infection. Reiter's syndrome, or reactive arthritis, is an inflammation of the joints and tendon attachments resulting from a bacterial infection originating in an area of the body other than the joints. There are two forms of Reiter's syndrome that occur more commonly in men aged 20 to 40. One occurs with sexually transmitted infections (e.g., clamydial infection); the other usually follows an intestinal infection (e.g., salmonellosis). Once a person is exposed to these infections, there appears to be a genetic predisposition to this type of disease.\n\n&lsqb;0025&rsqb; Infectious arthritis develops from an infection of the synovial fluid and tissue of a joint. Different bacteria can infect a joint, depending on the person's age. Infants and young children are most commonly infected by gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococci, and Hemophilus influenzae. Older children and adults are most commonly infected by gonococci, staphylococci, and streptococci. Viruses (e.g., HIV, parvoviruses, and the viruses that cause rubella, mumps, and hepatitis B) can infect joints in people of any age. The joints most commonly infected are the knee, shoulder, wrist, hip, finger, and elbow and become red, warm to the touch, swollen, and painful.\n\n&lsqb;0026&rsqb; Crystal deposits in the joints can cause arthritis and pain. Gout, characterized by sudden, recurring attacks of painful arthritis, is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints. This accumulation generally accompanies hyperuricemia. In addition to managing the pain associated with this disorder, treatment also involves the administering of drugs to reduce the levels of uric acid in the blood by increasing the excretion of uric acid in the urine. Pseudogout, characterized by intermittent attacks of painful arthritis, is cause by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals. This disorder usually occurs in older people and causes the degeneration of the affected joints. Unfortunately, there is no effective long-term treatment available for the removals of the calcium pyrophosphate crystals. The only treatment available for pseudogout is pain management.\n\n&lsqb;0027&rsqb; Diseases and Disorders of Muscles\n\n&lsqb;0028&rsqb; Damage to muscles can cause pain, limit control over movement, and reduce the normal range of motion. Diseases of the muscles can develop from injury, inflammation, spasms, or inheritance.\n\n&lsqb;0029&rsqb; Several muscle disorders are inherited. Muscular dystrophies are a group of inherited muscle disorders leading to muscle weakness. Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophies are caused by different gene defects on the same gene resulting in weakness of the muscles closest to the torso. The gene for both diseases is recessive and carried on the X chromosome. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is characterized by an almost total lack of dystrophin protein, resulting in progressive muscle loss, including the heart muscle, and ultimately resulting in death by the age of 20. Becker's muscular dystrophy is a less severe illness characterized by production of an oversized dystrophin protein that does not function properly. Landouszy-Dejerine muscular dystrophy is transmitted by an autosomal dominant gene and results in the muscles of the face, shoulder, and legs weakening. Neither Becker's nor Landouszy-Dejerine muscular dystrophy is fatal. Currently, there is no cure for muscular dystrophies. Treatment regimens involve physical therapy and exercise to prevent the muscles from contracting permanently around the joints, and sometimes surgery to release tight, painful muscles.\n\n&lsqb;0030&rsqb; Myotonic myopathies are a group of inherited muscle disorders in which the muscles are not capable of fully relaxing after contraction, leading to weakness, muscle spasms, and contractures. For example, Steinert's disease is an autosomal dominant disorder producing both weakness and tight, contracted muscles, especially in the hands. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. In the most severe cases, extreme muscle weakness and many other symptoms (e.g., cataracts, irregular heartbeat, diabetes, and mental retardation) can occur, resulting in death by the age of 50.\n\n&lsqb;0031&rsqb; Pompe's disease is a severe, autosomal recessive, glycogen storage disease in infants where glycogen accumulates in the liver, muscles, nerves, and heart, preventing them from functioning properly. This disease is fatal by age 2; however, there are less severe forms of Pompe's disease that can affect older children and adults, causing weakness of the extremities and diminished ability to breathe deeply. Current treatments for the less severe forms of Pompe's disease and other glycogen storage diseases involve limiting exercise and diuretics to reduce the level of myoglobin released into the blood due to the muscle damage.\n\n&lsqb;0032&rsqb; Periodic Paralysis is another rare autosomal dominant disorder that causes sudden attacks of weakness and paralysis where the muscles do not respond to normal nerve impulses or artificial stimulation. In some families, periodic paralysis has been linked to the level of potassium in the blood with some families influenced by high levels (hyperkalemia) and some families by low levels (hypokalemia). Diet (e.g., avoidance of carbohydrate-rich food) and treatment with acetazolamide are the most common treatment to control periodic paralysis episodes.\n\n&lsqb;0033&rsqb; Muscle disorders may result from inflammation. For example, Polymyositis is a chronic connective tissue disease characterized by painful inflammation and disabling muscle weakness and deterioration. Although the direct cause is unknown, cancer, viruses, or autoimmune reactions may play a role. Current treatment regimens include restricting activities during periods of intense inflammation and treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs to improve the strength and relieve the pain and swelling associated with the disease.\n\n&lsqb;0034&rsqb; Although the majority of muscle disorders involve deterioration and weakening of the muscle, some disorder result in only stiffness and pain. For example, Polymyalgia rheumatica causes severe pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and hips, especially in the morning and after periods of inactivity. No damage to the muscle is detected; however, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels in the blood are high. Drug treatment involving corticosteroids are generally used to treat this disease.\n\n&lsqb;0035&rsqb; The discovery of new human musculoskeletal system associated polynucleotides, the polypeptides encoded by them, and the antibodies that immunospecifically bind these polypeptides, satisfies a need in the art by providing new compositions which are useful in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and/or prognosis of disorders of musculoskeletal system, particularly disorders of the musculoskeletal system, including, but not limited to, bone disorders (e.g., osteoporosis, osteomyelitis, Paget's disease, and sciolosis); joint disorders (e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, infectious arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, gout, and Reiter's syndrome); ligament, tendon, and bursa disorders (e.g., bursitis, tendinitis, and tenosynovitis); muscle disorders (e.g., muscular dystrophy, Pompe's disease, periodic paralysis, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis, and Steinert's disease), neoplasms and/or cancers of musculoskeletal tissues (e.g., osteochondroma, benign chondroma, chondroblastoma, osteoid osteoma, and giant cell tumor), and/or as described under “Musculoskeletal System Disorders” below.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n&lsqb;0036&rsqb; The present invention relates to novel musculoskeletal system related polynucleotides, the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides herein collectively referred to as “musculoskeletal system antigens,” and antibodies that immunospecifically bind these polypeptides, and the use of such musculoskeletal system polynucleotides, antigens, and antibodies for detecting, treating, preventing and/or prognosing disorders of the musculoskeletal system system, including, but not limited to, the presence of cancer and cancer metastases. More specifically, isolated musculoskeletal system nucleic acid molecules are provided encoding novel musculoskeletal system polypeptides. Novel musculoskeletal system polypeptides and antibodies that bind to these polypeptides are provided. Also provided are vectors, host cells, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing human musculoskeletal system polynucleotides, polypeptides, and/or antibodies. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods useful for diagnosing, treating, preventing and/or prognosing disorders related to the musculoskeletal system, including cancer of musculoskeletal system tissues, and therapeutic methods for treating such disorders. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The invention further relates to methods and/or compositions for inhibiting or promoting the production and/or function of the polypeptides of the invention.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n&lsqb;0037&rsqb; Tables\n\n&lsqb;0038&rsqb; Table 1A summarizes some of the polynucleotides encompassed by the invention (including cDNA clones related to the sequences (Clone ID NO:Z), contig sequences (contig identifier (Contig ID:) and contig nucleotide sequence identifier (SEQ ID NO:X)) and further summarizes certain characteristics of these polynucleotides and the polypeptides encoded thereby. The first column provides a unique clone identifier, “Clone ID NO:Z”, for a cDNA plasmid related to each musculoskeletal system associated contig sequence disclosed in Table 1A. The second column provides a unique contig identifier, “Contig ID:” for each of the contig sequences disclosed in Table 1A. The third column provides the sequence identifier, “SEQ ID NO:X”, for each of the contig polynucleotide sequences disclosed in Table 1A. The fourth column, “ORF (From-To)”, provides the location (i.e., nucleotide position numbers) within the polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:X that delineate the preferred open reading frame (ORF) shown in the sequence listing and referenced in Table 1A as SEQ ID NO:Y (column 5). Column 6 lists residues comprising predicted epitopes contained in the polypeptides encoded by each of the preferred ORFs (SEQ ID NO:Y). Identification of potential immunogenic regions was performed according to the method of Jameson and Wolf (CABIOS, 4:181-186 (1988)); specifically, the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) implementation of this algorithm, embodied in the program PEPTIDESTRUCTURE (Wisconsin Package v10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, Wis.). This method returns a measure of the probability that a given residue is found on the surface of the protein. Regions where the antigenic index score is greater than 0.9 over at least 6 amino acids are indicated in Table 1A as “Predicted Epitopes.” In particular embodiments, musculoskeletal system associated polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, one, two, three, four, five or more of the predicted epitopes described in Table 1A. It will be appreciated that depending on the analytical criteria used to predict antigenic determinants, the exact address of the determinant may vary slightly. Column 7, “Tissue Distribution” shows the expression profile of tissue, cells, and/or cell line libraries which express the polynucleotides of the invention. The first number in column 7 (preceding the colon), represents the tissue/cell source identifier code corresponding to the code and description provided in Table 4. Expression of these polynucleotides was not observed in the other tissues and/or cell libraries tested. For those identifier codes in which the first two letters are not “AR”, the second number in column 7 (following the colon), represents the number of times a sequence corresponding to the reference polynucleotide sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO:X) was identified in the tissue/cell source. Those tissue/cell source identifier codes in which the first two letters are “AR” designate information generated using DNA array technology. Utilizing this technology, cDNAs were amplified by PCR and then transferred, in duplicate, onto the array. Gene expression was assayed through hybridization of first strand cDNA probes to the DNA array. cDNA probes were generated from total RNA extracted from a variety of different tissues and cell lines. Probe synthesis was performed in the presence of 33P dCTP, using oligo(dT) to prime reverse transcription. After hybridization, high stringency washing conditions were employed to remove non-specific hybrids from the array. The remaining signal, emanating from each gene target, was measured using a Phosphorimager. Gene expression was reported as Phosphor Stimulating Luminescence (PSL) which reflects the level of phosphor signal generated from the probe hybridized to each of the gene targets represented on the array. A local background signal subtraction was performed before the total signal generated from each array was used to normalize gene expression between the different hybridizations. The value presented after “&lsqb;array code&rsqb;:” represents the mean of the duplicate values, following background subtraction and probe normalization. One of skill in the art could routinely use this information to identify normal and/or diseased tissue(s) which show a predominant expression pattern of the corresponding polynucleotide of the invention or to identify polynucleotides which show predominant and/or specific tissue and/or cell expression. Column 8, “Cytologic Band,” provides the chromosomal location of polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO:X. Chromosomal location was determined by finding exact matches to EST and cDNA sequences contained in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) UniGene database. Given a presumptive chromosomal location, disease locus association was determined by comparison with the Morbid Map, derived from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM™. McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md.) and National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine (Bethesda, Md.) 2000. World Wide Web URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/). If the putative chromosomal location of the Query overlapped with the chromosomal location of a Morbid Map entry, an OMIM identification number is provided in Table 1A, column 9 labeled “OMIM Disease Reference(s)”. A key to the OMIM reference identification numbers is provided in Table 5.\n\n&lsqb;0039&rsqb; Table 1B summarizes additional polynucleotides encompassed by the invention (including cDNA clones related to the sequences (Clone ID NO:Z), contig sequences (contig identifier (Contig ID:) contig nucleotide sequence identifiers (SEQ ID NO:X)), and genomic sequences (SEQ ID NO:B). The first column provides a unique clone identifier, “Clone ID NO:Z”, for a cDNA clone related to each contig sequence. The second column provides the sequence identifier, “SEQ ID NO:X”, for each contig sequence. The third column provides a unique contig identifier, “Contig ID:” for each contig sequence. The fourth column, provides a BAC identifier “BAC ID NO:A” for the BAC clone referenced in the corresponding row of the table. The fifth column provides the nucleotide sequence identifier, “SEQ ID NO:B” for a fragment of the BAC clone identified in column four of the corresponding row of the table. The sixth column, “Exon From-To”, provides the location (i.e., nucleotide position numbers) within the polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:B which delineate certain polynucleotides of the invention that are also exemplary members of polynucleotide sequences that encode polypeptides of the invention (e.g., polypeptides containing amino acid sequences encoded by the polynucleotide sequences delineated in column six, and fragments and variants thereof).\n\n&lsqb;0040&rsqb; Table 2 summarizes homology and features of some of the polypeptides of the invention. The first column provides a unique clone identifier, “Clone ID NO:Z”, corresponding to a cDNA disclosed in Table 1A. The second column provides the unique contig identifier, “Contig ID:” corresponding to contigs in Table 1A and allowing for correlation with the information in Table 1A. The third column provides the sequence identifier, “SEQ ID NO:X”, for the contig polynucleotide sequences. The fourth column provides the analysis method by which the homology/identity disclosed in the row was determined. Comparisons were made between polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotides of the invention and either a non-redundant protein database (herein referred to as “NR”), or a database of protein families (herein referred to as “PFAM”) as further described below. The fifth column provides a description of PFAM/NR hits having significant matches to a polypeptide of the invention. Column six provides the accession number of the PFAM/NR hit disclosed in the fifth column. Column seven, “Score/Percent Identity”, provides a quality score or the percent identity, of the hit disclosed in column five. Columns 8 and 9, “NT From” and “NT To” respectively, delineate the polynucleotides in “SEQ ID NO:X” that encode a polypeptide having a significant match to the PFAM/NR database as disclosed in the fifth column. In specific embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, an amino acid sequence encoded by the polynucleotides in SEQ ID NO:X as delineated in columns 8 and 9, or fragments or variants thereof.\n\n&lsqb;0041&rsqb; Table 3 provides polynucleotide sequences that may be disclaimed according to certain embodiments of the invention. The first column provides a unique clone identifier, “Clone ID NO:Z”, for a cDNA clone related to musculoskeletal system associated contig sequences disclosed in Table 1A. The second column provides the sequence identifier, “SEQ ID NO:X”, for contig polynucleotide sequences disclosed in Table 1A. The third column provides the unique contig identifier, “Contig ID”, for contigs disclosed in Table 1A. The fourth column provides a unique integer ‘a’ where ‘a’ is any integer between 1 and the final nucleotide minus 15 of SEQ ID NO:X, represented as “Range of a”, and the fifth column provides a unique integer ‘b’ where ‘b’ is any integer between 15 and the final nucleotide of SEQ ID NO:X, represented as “Range of b”, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:X, and where b is greater than or equal to a &plus;14. For each of the polynucleotides shown as SEQ ID NO:X, the uniquely defined integers can be substituted into the general formula of a-b, and used to describe polynucleotides which may be preferably excluded from the invention. In certain embodiments, preferably excluded from the polynucleotides of the invention (including polynucleotide fragments and variants as described herein and diagnostic and/or therapeutic uses based on these polynucleotides) are at least one, two, three, four, five, ten, or more of the polynucleotide sequence(s) having the accession number(s) disclosed in the sixth column of this Table (including for example, published sequence in connection with a particular BAC clone). In further embodiments, preferably excluded from the invention are the specific polynucleotide sequence(s) contained in the clones corresponding to at least one, two, three, four, five, ten, or more of the available material having the accession numbers identified in the sixth column of this Table (including for example, the actual sequence contained in an identified BAC clone).\n\n&lsqb;0042&rsqb; Table 4 provides a key to the tissue/cell source identifier code disclosed in Table 1A, column 7. Column 1 provides the key to the tissue/cell source identifier code disclosed in Table 1A, Column 7. Columns 2-5 provide a description of the tissue or cell source. Codes corresponding to diseased tissues are indicated in column 6 with the word “disease”. The use of the word “disease” in column 6 is non-limiting. The tissue or cell source may be specific (e.g. a neoplasm), or may be disease-associated (e.g., a tissue sample from a normal portion of a diseased organ). Furthermore, tissues and/or cells lacking the “disease” designation may still be derived from sources directly or indirectly involved in a disease state or disorder, and therefore may have a further utility in that disease state or disorder. In numerous cases where the tissue/cell source is a library, column 7 identifies the vector used to generate the library.\n\n&lsqb;0043&rsqb; Table 5 provides a key to the OMIM™ reference identification numbers disclosed in Table 1A, column 9. OMIM reference identification numbers (Column 1) were derived from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM™. McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md.) and National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, (Bethesda, Md.) 2000. World Wide Web URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/). Column 2 provides diseases associated with the cytologic band disclosed in Table 1A, column 8, as determined from the Morbid Map database.\n\n&lsqb;0044&rsqb; Table 6 summarizes ATCC Deposits, Deposit dates, and ATCC designation numbers of deposits made with the ATCC in connection with the present application.\n\n&lsqb;0045&rsqb; Table 7 shows the cDNA libraries sequenced, tissue source description, vector information and ATCC designation numbers relating to these cDNA libraries.\n\n&lsqb;0046&rsqb; Table 8 provides a physical characterization of clones encompassed by the invention. The first column provides the unique clone identifier, “Clone ID NO:Z”, for certain cDNA clones of the invention, as described in Table 1A. The second column provides the size of the cDNA insert contained in the corresponding cDNA clone.\n\n&lsqb;0047&rsqb; Definitions\n\n&lsqb;0048&rsqb; The following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of certain terms used throughout this specification.\n\n&lsqb;0049&rsqb; In the present invention, “isolated” refers to material removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring), and thus is altered “by the hand of man” from its natural state. For example, an isolated polynucleotide could be part of a vector or a composition of matter, or could be contained within a cell, and still be “isolated” because that vector, composition of matter, or particular cell is not the original environment of the polynucleotide. The term “isolated” does not refer to genomic or cDNA libraries, whole cell total or mRNA preparations, genomic DNA preparations (including those separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto blots), sheared whole cell genomic DNA preparations or other compositions where the art demonstrates no distinguishing features of the polynucleotide sequences of the present invention.\n\n&lsqb;0050&rsqb; As used herein, a “polynucleotide” refers to a molecule having a nucleic acid sequence encoding SEQ ID NO:Y or a fragment or variant thereof, a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:X (as described in column 3 of Table 1A) or the complement thereof, a cDNA sequence contained in Clone ID NO:Z (as described in column 1 of Table 1A and contained within a library deposited with the ATCC); a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide encoded by a nucleotide sequence in SEQ ID NO:B as defined in column 6 of Table 1B or a fragment or variant thereof; or a nucleotide coding sequence in SEQ ID NO:B as defined in column 6 of Table 1B or the complement thereof. For example, the polynucleotide can contain the nucleotide sequence of the full length cDNA sequence, including the 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences, the coding region, as well as fragments, epitopes, domains, and variants of the nucleic acid sequence. Moreover, as used herein, a “polypeptide” refers to a molecule having an amino acid sequence encoded by a polynucleotide of the invention as broadly defined (obviously excluding poly-Phenylalanine or poly-Lysine peptide sequences which result from translation of a polyA tail of a sequence corresponding to a cDNA).\n\n&lsqb;0051&rsqb; As used herein, a “musculoskeletal system antigen” refers collectively to any polynucleotide disclosed herein (e.g., a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:X or the complement therof, or cDNA sequence contained in Clone ID NO:Z, or a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide encoded by a nucleotide sequence in SEQ ID NO:B as defined in column 6 of Table 1B, or a nucleotide coding sequence in SEQ ID NO:B as defined in column 6 of Table 1B or the complement thereof and fragments or variants thereof as described herein) or any polypeptide disclosed herein (e.g., an amino acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:Y, an amino acid sequence encoded by SEQ ID NO:X, or the complement thereof, an amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA sequence contained in Clone ID NO:Z, an amino acid sequence encoded by SEQ ID NO:B, or the complement thereof, and fragments or variants thereof as described herein). These musculoskeletal system antigens have been determined to be predominantly expressed in musculoskeletal system tissues, including normal or diseased tissues (as shown in Table 1A column 7 and Table 4).\n\n&lsqb;0052&rsqb; In the present invention, “SEQ ID NO:X” was often generated by overlapping sequences contained in multiple clones (contig analysis). A representative clone containing all or most of the sequence for SEQ ID NO:X is deposited at Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (HGS) in a catalogued and archived library. As shown, for example, in column 1 of Table 1A, each clone is identified by a cDNA Clone ID (identifier generally referred to herein as Clone ID NO:Z). Each Clone ID is unique to an individual clone and the Clone ID is all the information needed to retrieve a given clone from the HGS library. Furthermore, certain clones disclosed in this application have been deposited with the ATCC on Oct. 5, 2000, having the ATCC designation numbers PTA 2574 and PTA 2575; and on Jan. 5, 2001, having the depositor reference numbers TS-1, TS-2, AC-1, and AC-2. In addition to the individual cDNA clone deposits, most of the cDNA libraries from which the clones were derived were deposited at the American Type Culture Collection (hereinafter “ATCC”). Table 7 lists the deposited cDNA libraries by name and links each library to an ATCC Deposit. Library names contain four characters, for example, “HTWE.” The name of a cDNA clone (Clone ID NO:Z) isolated from that library begins with the same four characters, for example “HTWEP07”. As mentioned below, Table 1A correlates the Clone ID NO:Z names with SEQ ID NO:X. Thus, starting with an SEQ ID NO:X, one can use Tables 1A, 6 and 7 to determine the corresponding Clone ID NO:Z, which library it came from and which ATCC deposit the library is contained in. Furthermore, it is possible to retrieve a given cDNA clone from the source library by techniques known in the art and described elsewhere herein. The ATCC is located at\n\n&lsqb;0053&rsqb; University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA. The ATCC deposits were made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for the purposes of patent procedure.\n\n&lsqb;0054&rsqb; In specific embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention are at least 15, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, at least 125, at least 500, or at least 1000 continuous nucleotides but are less than or equal to 300 kb, 200 kb, 100 kb, 50 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, 7.5 kb, 5 kb, 2.5 kb, 2.0 kb, or 1 kb, in length. In a further embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention comprise a portion of the coding sequences, as disclosed herein, but do not comprise all or a portion of any intron. In another embodiment, the polynucleotides comprising coding sequences do not contain coding sequences of a genomic flanking gene (i.e., 5′ or 3′ to the gene of interest in the genome). In other embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention do not contain the coding sequence of more than 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 genomic flanking gene(s).\n\n&lsqb;0055&rsqb; A “polynucleotide” of the present invention also includes those polynucleotides capable of hybridizing, under stringent hybridization conditions, to sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X, or the complement thereof (e.g., the complement of any one, two, three, four, or more of the polynucleotide fragments described herein), the polynucleotide sequence delineated in columns 8 and 9 of Table 2 or the complement thereof, and/or cDNA sequences contained in Clone ID NO:Z (e.g., the complement of any one, two, three, four, or more of the polynucleotide fragments, or the cDNA clone within the pool of cDNA clones deposited with the ATCC, described herein) and/or the polynucleotide sequence delineated in column 6 of Table 1B or the complement thereof. “Stringent hybridization conditions” refers to an overnight incubation at 42 degree C in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5× SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 &mgr;g/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1× SSC at about 65 degree C.\n\n&lsqb;0056&rsqb; Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to the polynucleotides of the present invention at lower stringency hybridization conditions. Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration (lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency), salt conditions, or temperature. For example, lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37 degree C in a solution comprising 6× SSPE (20× SSPE&equals;3M NaCl; 0.2M NaH2PO4; 0.02M EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 30% formamide, 100 ug/ml salmon sperm blocking DNA; followed by washes at 50 degree C. with 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS. In addition, to achieve even lower stringency, washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations (e.g. 5× SSC).\n\n&lsqb;0057&rsqb; Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and/or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt's reagent, BLOTTO, heparin, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above, due to problems with compatibility.\n\n&lsqb;0058&rsqb; Of course, a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA&plus; sequences (such as any 3′ terminal polyA&plus; tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing), or to a complementary stretch of T (or U) residues, would not be included in the definition of “polynucleotide,” since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly (A) stretch or the complement thereof (e.g., practically any double-stranded cDNA clone generated using oligo dT as a primer).\n\n&lsqb;0059&rsqb; The polynucleotide of the present invention can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, polynucleotides can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be composed of triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A polynucleotide may also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. “Modified” bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications can be made to DNA and RNA; thus, “polynucleotide” embraces chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms.\n\n&lsqb;0060&rsqb; The polypeptide of the present invention can be composed of amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres, and may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. The polypeptides may be modified by either natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination.

Sci. 663:48-62 (1992).)\n\n&lsqb;0061&rsqb; “SEQ ID NO:X” refers to a polynucleotide sequence described, for example, in Tables 1A or 2, while “SEQ ID NO:Y” refers to a polypeptide sequence described in column 5 of Table 1A. SEQ ID NO:X is identified by an integer specified in column 3 of Table 1A. The polypeptide sequence SEQ ID NO:Y is a translated open reading frame (ORF) encoded by polynucleotide SEQ ID NO:X. “Clone ID NO:Z” refers to a cDNA clone described in column 1 of Table 1 A.\n\n&lsqb;0062&rsqb; “A polypeptide having biological activity” refers to a polypeptide exhibiting activity similar to, but not necessarily identical to, an activity of a polypeptide of the present invention, including mature forms, as measured in a particular biological assay, with or without dose dependency. In the case where dose dependency does exist, it need not be identical to that of the polypeptide, but rather substantially similar to the dose-dependence in a given activity as compared to the polypeptide of the present invention (i.e., the candidate polypeptide will exhibit greater activity or not more than about 25-fold less and, preferably, not more than about tenfold less activity, and most preferably, not more than about three-fold less activity relative to the polypeptide of the present invention).\n\n&lsqb;0063&rsqb; Table 1A summarizes some of the musculoskeletal system associated polynucleotides encompassed by the invention (including contig sequences (SEQ ID NO:X) and clones (Clone ID NO:Z) and further summarizes certain characteristics of these polynucleotides and the polypeptides encoded thereby.\n\n&lsqb;0064&rsqb; Polynucleotides and Polypeptides 2 TABLE 1A AA Tissue Distribution SEQ Library code: count OMIM Clone ID Contig SEQ ID ORF ID (see Table IV for Cytologic Disease NO: Z ID NO: X (From-To) NO: Y Predicted Epitopes Library Codes) Band Reference(s): HANGA63 927404 11 168-254 1034 S0318: 1 and S0316: 1.
