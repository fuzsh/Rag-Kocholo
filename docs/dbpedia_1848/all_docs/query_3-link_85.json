More specifically, isolated ovarian nucleic acid molecules are provided encoding novel ovarian polypeptides. Novel ovarian polypeptides and antibodies that bind to these polypeptides are provided. Also provided are vectors, host cells, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing human ovarian polynucleotides, polypeptides, and/or antibodies. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods useful for diagnosing, treating, preventing and/or prognosing disorders related to the ovaries and/or breast, including ovarian and/or breast cancer, and therapeutic methods for treating such disorders. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The invention further relates to methods and/or compositions for inhibiting or promoting the production and/or function of the polypeptides of the invention.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n&lsqb;0004&rsqb; The female reproductive system is comprised of both external and internal organs. The external organs function in permitting sperm to enter the body and protecting the internal genital organs from infection and injury. The internal organs form a pathway (the genital tract) for reproduction, beginning at the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes (oviducts) and uterus, to the birth canal (vagina).\n\n&lsqb;0005&rsqb; The sexual and reproductive functions in the female can be divided into two major phases: first, preparation of the body for conception, and second, the gestation and parturition. Gestation and parturition only occur if an ovum becomes fertilized. If fertilization does not occur, the reproductive system undergoes a cycle to ensure frequent readiness for conception and fertilization.\n\n&lsqb;0006&rsqb; The complexity of the female reproductive system renders it susceptible to several diseases and disorders. In particular, the ovaries and breast are subject to diseases and/or disorders such as infections, hyperproliferative disorders, as well as regulatory and genetic abnormalities.\n\n&lsqb;0007&rsqb; Disorders of the Ovary\n\n&lsqb;0008&rsqb; A woman's ovaries are located on both sides of the uterus, below the opening of the fallopian tubes (tubes that extend from the uterus to the ovaries). In addition to producing egg cells for reproduction, the ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone, which affect many of the female characteristics and reproductive functions.\n\n&lsqb;0009&rsqb; Anovulation (the absence of egg release by the ovaries) is a serious condition leading to infertility. The exact etiology of anovulation, especially in women with otherwise normal menstrual cycles, is unclear, however several potential causes are under study, including: impaired follicular development (probably due to low or absent estrogen production or binding), normal follicular development with lack of egg release (probably due to progesterone deficiency), or insufficient production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. Current treatments include clomiphene injections or hormonal therapy, although both can lead to serious side effects such as ovarian cancer and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\n\n&lsqb;0010&rsqb; Anovulation is also associated with polycyctic ovary syndrome (also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome). This syndrome is and endocrine disorder characterized by an elevated level of male hormones (androgens). Other than anovulation, symptoms include growth of male-patterned body hair (hirsutism), excessive acne, irregular or absent menses, excessive bleeding, and obesity. Usually, the ovaries appear enlarged and may contain many follicular cysts.\n\n&lsqb;0011&rsqb; Ovarian cancer develops most often in women between the ages of 50 and 70. It is the third most common cancer of the female reproductive system, but more women die of ovarian cancers than of any other. Ovaries include a variety of cell types, each of which may give rise to a distinct type of cancer, including, but not limited to, ovarian epithelial cancer, ovarian germ cell tumors, ovarian papillary serous adenocarcinoma, ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma, ovarian Krukenberg tumor, malignant mixed Mullerian tumors, and ovarian low malignant tumors.\n\n&lsqb;0012&rsqb; Other disorders of the ovaries also include, but are not limited to, inflammatory disorders, such as oophoritis (e.g., caused by viral or bacterial infection), ovarian cysts, and autoimmune disorders (e.g., premature ovarian failure and autoimmune oophoritis).\n\n&lsqb;0013&rsqb; Disorders of the Breast\n\n&lsqb;0014&rsqb; The breast is comprised of different structures, each with its own specific function. One-third of the breast is comprised of fatty tissue. The other two-thirds is made up of structural components called ducts and lobules. Milk is produced in the lobules and funneled through the ducts to the nipple. Disorders of the breast typically involve the formation of lesions within breast tissue. While many of these lesions are benign in nature, they may lead to cancer if left untreated.\n\n&lsqb;0015&rsqb; Benign breast lesions include, for example, cysts, which are non-cancerous, fluid-filled sacs that form a mass within breast tissue. The cause of breast cysts is unknown, though injury may be involved, and their main symptom is pain. While considered harmless, a professional should drain cysts and the fluid examined because cancer of the cyst wall, although quite rare, is possible.\n\n&lsqb;0016&rsqb; Other benign breast lesions include fibrous breast lumps (fibroadenomas), breast infection (mastitis), intraductal papilloma, and abscesses. Fibrous breast lumps are small, solid lumps of glandular tissue. These lumps usually appear in young women, often in teenagers, and are easy to remove. Intraductal papilloma are small lumps located within a milk duct, often causing inappropriate discharge from the nipple. Breast abscesses are collections of pus in breast tissue that develop from breast infections that go untreated.\n\n&lsqb;0017&rsqb; Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, other than skin cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, after lung cancer. The American Cancer Society predicts that there will be about 182,800 new cases of invasive breast cancer in the year 2000 among women in this country and about 40,800 deaths from the disease. Breast cancer also occurs among men, although much less often. It is generally believed that this malignancy arises from a multi step process involving mutations in a relatively small number of genes, perhaps 10 or less. These mutations result in significant changes in the growth and differentiation of breast tissue that allow it to grow independent of normal cellular controls, to metastasize, and to escape immune surveillance. The genetic heterogeneity of most breast cancers suggests that they arise by a variety of initiating events and that the characteristics of individual cancers are due to the collective pattern of genetic changes that accumulate.\n\n&lsqb;0018&rsqb; The discovery of new human ovarian associated polynucleotides, the polypeptides encoded by them, and antibodies that immunospecifically bind these polypeptides, satisfies a need in the art by providing new compositions which are useful in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and/or prognosis of disorders of the ovaries and/or breast, including, but not limited to, neoplastic disorders (e.g., ovarian Krukenberg tumor, malignant mixed Mullerian tumors, and/or as described under “Hyperproliferative Disorders” below), infectious diseases (e.g., mastitis, oophoritis, and/or as described under “Infectious Diseases” below), and inflammatory diseases (e.g., abcesses and/or as described under “Immune Disorders” below) and as described in “Reproductive System Disorders” below.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n&lsqb;0019&rsqb; The present invention relates to novel ovarian related polynucleotides, the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides herein collectively referred to as “ovarian antigens,” and antibodies that immunospecifically bind these polypeptides, and the use of such ovarian polynucleotides, antigens, and antibodies for detecting, treating, preventing and/or prognosing disorders of the reproductive system, particularly disorders of the ovaries and/or breast, including, but not limited to, the presence of ovarian and/or breast cancer and ovarian and/or breast cancer metastases. More specifically, isolated ovarian nucleic acid molecules are provided encoding novel ovarian polypeptides. Novel ovarian polypeptides and antibodies that bind to these polypeptides are provided. Also provided are vectors, host cells, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing human ovarian polynucleotides, polypeptides, and/or antibodies. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods useful for diagnosing, treating, preventing and/or prognosing disorders related to the ovaries and/or breast, including ovarian and/or breast cancer, and therapeutic methods for treating such disorders. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The invention further relates to methods and/or compositions for inhibiting or promoting the production and/or function of the polypeptides of the invention.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n&lsqb;0020&rsqb; Tables\n\n&lsqb;0021&rsqb; Table 1 summarizes some of the polynucleotides encompassed by the invention (including cDNA clones related to the sequences (Clone ID NO: Z), contig sequences (contig identifier (Contig ID:) and contig nucleotide sequence identifier (SEQ ID NO: X)) and further summarizes certain characteristics of these polynucleotides and the polypeptides encoded thereby. The first column, “Gene No.”, numbers each disclosed cDNA clone related to the sequences sequentially. The second column provides a unique clone identifier, “Clone ID NO: Z”, for a cDNA plasmid related to each ovarian associated contig sequence disclosed in Table 1. The third column provides a unique contig identifier, “Contig ID:” for each of the contig sequences disclosed in Table 1. The fourth column provides the sequence identifier, “SEQ ID NO: X”, for each of the contig polynucleotide sequences disclosed in Table 1. The fifth column, “ORF (From-To)”, provides the location (i.e., nucleotide position numbers) within the polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: X that delineate the preferred open reading frame (ORF) shown in the sequence listing and referenced in Table 1 as SEQ ID NO: Y (column 6). Column 7 lists residues comprising predicted epitopes contained in the polypeptides encoded by each of the preferred ORFs (SEQ ID NO: Y). Identification of potential immunogenic regions was performed according to the method of Jameson and Wolf (CABIOS, 4:181-186 (1988)); specifically, the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) implementation of this algorithm, embodied in the program PEPTIDESTRUCTURE (Wisconsin Package v10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, Wis.). This method returns a measure of the probability that a given residue is found on the surface of the protein. Regions where the antigenic index score is greater than 0.9 over at least 6 amino acids are indicated in Table 1 as “Predicted Epitopes.” In particular embodiments, ovarian associated polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, one, two, three, four, five or more of the predicted epitopes described in Table 1. It will be appreciated that depending on the analytical criteria used to predict antigenic determinants, the exact address of the determinant may vary slightly. Column 8, “Tissue Distribution” shows the expression profile of tissue, cells, and/or cell line libraries which express the polynucleotides of the invention. The first number in column 8 (preceding the colon), represents the tissue/cell source identifier code corresponding to the code and description provided in Table 4. Expression of these polynucleotides was not observed in the other tissues and/or cell libraries tested. For those identifier codes in which the first two letters are not “AR”, the second number in column 8 (following the colon), represents the number of times a sequence corresponding to the reference polynucleotide sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: X) was identified in the tissue/cell source. Those tissue/cell source identifier codes in which the first two letters are “AR” designate information generated using DNA array technology. Utilizing this technology, cDNAs were amplified by PCR and then transferred, in duplicate, onto the array. Gene expression was assayed through hybridization of first strand cDNA probes to the DNA array. cDNA probes were generated from total RNA extracted from a variety of different tissues and cell lines. Probe synthesis was performed in the presence of 33P dCTP, using oligo(dT) to prime reverse transcription. After hybridization, high stringency washing conditions were employed to remove non-specific hybrids from the array. The remaining signal, emanating from each gene target, was measured using a Phosphorimager. Gene expression was reported as Phosphor Stimulating Luminescence (PSL) which reflects the level of phosphor signal generated from the probe hybridized to each of the gene targets represented on the array. A local background signal subtraction was performed before the total signal generated from each array was used to normalize gene expression between the different hybridizations. The value presented after “&lsqb;array code&rsqb;:” represents the mean of the duplicate values, following background subtraction and probe normalization. One of skill in the art could routinely use this information to identify normal and/or diseased tissue(s) which show a predominant expression pattern of the corresponding polynucleotide of the invention or to identify polynucleotides which show predominant and/or specific tissue and/or cell expression. Column 9, “Cytologic Band,” provides the chromosomal location of polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO: X. Chromosomal location was determined by finding exact matches to EST and cDNA sequences contained in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) UniGene database. Given a presumptive chromosomal location, disease locus association was determined by comparison with the Morbid Map, derived from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM™. McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md.) and National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine (Bethesda, Md.) 2000. World Wide Web URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/). If the putative chromosomal location of the Query overlapped with the chromosomal location of a Morbid Map entry, an OMIM identification number is provided in column 10 labeled “OMIM Disease Reference(s)”. A key to the OMIM reference identification numbers is provided in Table 5.\n\n&lsqb;0022&rsqb; Table 2 summarizes homology and features of some of the polypeptides of the invention. The first column provides a unique clone identifier, “Clone ID NO: Z”, corresponding to a cDNA disclosed in Table 1. The second column provides the unique contig identifier, “Contig ID:” corresponding to contigs in Table 1 and allowing for correlation with the information in Table 1. The third column provides the sequence identifier, “SEQ ID NO: X”, for the contig polynucleotide sequences. The fourth column provides the analysis method by which the homology/identity disclosed in the row was determined. Comparisons were made between polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotides of the invention and either a non-redundant protein database (herein referred to as “NR”), or a database of protein families (herein referred to as “PFAM”) as further described below. The fifth column provides a description of PFAM/NR hits having significant matches to a polypeptide of the invention. Column six provides the accession number of the PFAM/NR hit disclosed in the fifth column. Column seven, “Score/Percent Identity”, provides a quality score or the percent identity, of the hit disclosed in column five. Columns 8 and 9, “NT From” and “NT To” respectively, delineate the polynucleotides in “SEQ ID NO: X” that encode a polypeptide having a significant match to the PFAM/NR database as disclosed in the fifth column. In specific embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, an amino acid sequence encoded by the polynucleotides in SEQ ID NO: X as delineated in columns 8 and 9, or fragments or variants thereof.\n\n&lsqb;0023&rsqb; Table 3 provides polynucleotide sequences that may be disclaimed according to certain embodiments of the invention. The first column provides a unique clone identifier, “Clone ID NO: Z”, for a cDNA clone related to ovarian associated contig sequences disclosed in Table 1. The second column provides the sequence identifier, “SEQ ID NO: X”, for contig polynucleotide sequences disclosed in Table 1. The third column provides the unique contig identifier, “Contig ID”, for contigs disclosed in Table 1. The fourth column provides a unique integer ‘a’ where ‘a’ is any integer between 1 and the final nucleotide minus 15 of SEQ ID NO: X, represented as “Range of a” , and the fifth column provides a unique integer ‘b’ where ‘b’ is any integer between 15 and the final nucleotide of SEQ ID NO: X, represented as “Range of b”, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO: X, and where b is greater than or equal to a&plus;14. For each of the polynucleotides shown as SEQ ID NO: X, the uniquely defined integers can be substituted into the general formula of a-b, and used to describe polynucleotides which may be preferably excluded from the invention. In certain embodiments, preferably excluded from the polynucleotides of the invention (including polynucleotide fragments and variants as described herein and diagnostic and/or therapeutic uses based on these polynucleotides) are at least one, two, three, four, five, ten, or more of the polynucleotide sequence(s) having the accession number(s) disclosed in the sixth column of this Table. In further embodiments, preferably excluded from the invention are the specific polynucleotide sequence(s) contained in the clones corresponding to at least one, two, three, four, five, ten, or more of the available material having the accession numbers identified in the sixth column of this Table (including for example, the actual sequence contained in an identified BAC clone).\n\n&lsqb;0024&rsqb; Table 4 provides a key to the tissue/cell source identifier code disclosed in Table 1, column 8. Column 1 provides the key to the tissue/cell source identifier code disclosed in Table 1, Column 8. Columns 2-5 provide a description of the tissue or cell source. Codes corresponding to diseased tissues are indicated in column 6 with the word “disease”. The use of the word “disease” in column 6 is non-limiting. The tissue or cell source may be specific (e.g. a neoplasm), or may be disease-associated (e.g., a tissue sample from a normal portion of a diseased organ). Furthermore, tissues and/or cells lacking the “disease” designation may still be derived from sources directly or indirectly involved in a disease state or disorder, and therefore may have a further utility in that disease state or disorder. In numerous cases where the tissue/cell source is a library, column 7 identifies the vector used to generate the library.\n\n&lsqb;0025&rsqb; Table 5 provides a key to the OMIM™ reference identification numbers disclosed in Table 1, column 10. OMIM reference identification numbers (Column 1) were derived from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM™. McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md.) and National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, (Bethesda, Md.) 2000. World Wide Web URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/). Column 2 provides diseases associated with the cytologic band disclosed in Table 1, column 9, as determined from the Morbid Map database.\n\n&lsqb;0026&rsqb; Table 6 summarizes ATCC Deposits, Deposit dates, and ATCC designation numbers of deposits made with the ATCC in connection with the present application.\n\n&lsqb;0027&rsqb; Table 7 shows the cDNA libraries sequenced, tissue source description, vector information and ATCC designation numbers relating to these cDNA libraries.\n\n&lsqb;0028&rsqb; Definitions\n\n&lsqb;0029&rsqb; The following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of certain terms used throughout this specification.\n\n&lsqb;0030&rsqb; In the present invention, “isolated” refers to material removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring), and thus is altered “by the hand of man” from its natural state. For example, an isolated polynucleotide could be part of a vector or a composition of matter, or could be contained within a cell, and still be “isolated” because that vector, composition of matter, or particular cell is not the original environment of the polynucleotide. The term “isolated” does not refer to genomic or cDNA libraries, whole cell total or mRNA preparations, genomic DNA preparations (including those separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto blots), sheared whole cell genomic DNA preparations or other compositions where the art demonstrates no distinguishing features of the polynucleotide sequences of the present invention.\n\n&lsqb;0031&rsqb; As used herein, a “polynucleotide” refers to a molecule having a nucleic acid sequence encoding SEQ ID NO: Y or a fragment or variant thereof; a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO: X (as described in column 4 of Table 1) or the complement thereof; or a cDNA sequence contained in Clone ID NO: Z (as described in column 2 of Table 1 and contained within a library deposited with the ATCC). For example, the polynucleotide can contain the nucleotide sequence of the full length cDNA sequence, including the 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences, the coding region, as well as fragments, epitopes, domains, and variants of the nucleic acid sequence. Moreover, as used herein, a “polypeptide” refers to a molecule having an amino acid sequence encoded by a polynucleotide of the invention as broadly defined (obviously excluding poly-Phenylalanine or poly-Lysine peptide sequences which result from translation of a polyA tail of a sequence corresponding to a cDNA).\n\n&lsqb;0032&rsqb; As used herein, an “ovarian antigen” refers collectively to any polynucleotide disclosed herein (e.g., a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO: X or the complement therof, and fragments or variants thereof as described herein) or any polypeptide disclosed herein (e.g., an amino acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO: Y, an amino acid sequence encoded by SEQ ID NO: X, or the complement thereof, an amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA sequence contained in Clone ID NO: Z, or the complement thereof, and fragments or variants thereof as described herein). These ovarian antigens have been determined to be predominantly expressed in ovarian tissues, including normal or diseased tissues (as shown in Table 1 column 8 and Table 4).\n\n&lsqb;0033&rsqb; In the present invention, “SEQ ID NO: X” was often generated by overlapping sequences contained in multiple clones (contig analysis). A representative clone containing all or most of the sequence for SEQ ID NO: X is deposited at Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (HGS) in a catalogued and archived library. As shown, for example, in column 2 of Table 1, each clone is identified by a cDNA Clone ID (identifier generally referred to herein as Clone ID NO: Z). Each Clone ID is unique to an individual clone and the Clone ID is all the information needed to retrieve a given clone from the HGS library. Furthermore, certain clones disclosed in this application have been deposited with the ATCC on Jun. 5, 2000, having the ATCC designation numbers PTA-1982 and PTA-1985. In addition to the individual cDNA clone deposits, most of the cDNA libraries from which the clones were derived were deposited at the American Type Culture Collection (hereinafter “ATCC”). Table 7 provides a list of the deposited cDNA libraries. One can use the Clone ID NO: Z to determine the library source by reference to Tables 6 and 7. Table 7 lists the deposited cDNA libraries by name and links each library to an ATCC Deposit. Library names contain four characters, for example, “HTWE.” The name of a cDNA clone (Clone ID NO: Z) isolated from that library begins with the same four characters, for example “HTWEP07”. As mentioned below, Table 1 correlates the Clone ID NO: Z names with SEQ ID NO: X. Thus, starting with an SEQ ID NO: X, one can use Tables 1, 6 and 7 to determine the corresponding Clone ID NO: Z, which library it came from and which ATCC deposit the library is contained in. Furthermore, it is possible to retrieve a given cDNA clone from the source library by techniques known in the art and described elsewhere herein. The ATCC is located at 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA. The ATCC deposits were made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for the purposes of patent procedure.\n\n&lsqb;0034&rsqb; In specific embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention are at least 15, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, at least 125, at least 500, or at least 1000 continuous nucleotides but are less than or equal to 300 kb, 200 kb, 100 kb, 50 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, 7.5 kb, 5 kb, 2.5 kb, 2.0 kb, or 1 kb, in length. In a further embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention comprise a portion of the coding sequences, as disclosed herein, but do not comprise all or a portion of any intron. In another embodiment, the polynucleotides comprising coding sequences do not contain coding sequences of a genomic flanking gene (i.e., 5′ or 3′ to the gene of interest in the genome). In other embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention do not contain the coding sequence of more than 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 genomic flanking gene(s).\n\n&lsqb;0035&rsqb; A “polynucleotide” of the present invention also includes those polynucleotides capable of hybridizing, under stringent hybridization conditions, to sequences contained in SEQ ID NO: X, or the complement thereof (e.g., the complement of any one, two, three, four, or more of the polynucleotide fragments described herein), the polynucleotide sequence delineated in columns 8 and 9 of Table 2 or the complement thereof, and/or cDNA sequences contained in Clone ID NO: Z (e.g., the complement of any one, two, three, four, or more of the polynucleotide fragments, or the cDNA clone within the pool of cDNA clones deposited with the ATCC, described herein) or the complement thereof. “Stringent hybridization conditions” refers to an overnight incubation at 42 degree C. in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5×SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5×Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 &mgr;g/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1×SSC at about 65 degree C.\n\n&lsqb;0036&rsqb; Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to the polynucleotides of the present invention at lower stringency hybridization conditions. Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration (lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency), salt conditions, or temperature. For example, lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37 degree C. in a solution comprising 6×SSPE (20×SSPE&equals;3M NaCl; 0.2M NaH2PO4; 0.02M EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 30% formamide, 100 ug/ml salmon sperm blocking DNA; followed by washes at 50 degree C. with 1×SSPE, 0.1% SDS. In addition, to achieve even lower stringency, washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations (e.g. 5×SSC).\n\n&lsqb;0037&rsqb; Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and/or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt's reagent, BLOTTO, heparin, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above, due to problems with compatibility.\n\n&lsqb;0038&rsqb; Of course, a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA&plus;sequences (such as any 3′ terminal polyA&plus;tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing), or to a complementary stretch of T (or U) residues, would not be included in the definition of “polynucleotide,” since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly (A) stretch or the complement thereof (e.g., practically any double-stranded cDNA clone generated using oligo dT as a primer).\n\n&lsqb;0039&rsqb; The polynucleotide of the present invention can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, polynucleotides can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be composed of triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A polynucleotide may also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. “Modified” bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications can be made to DNA and RNA; thus, “polynucleotide” embraces chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms.\n\n&lsqb;0040&rsqb; The polypeptide of the present invention can be composed of amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres, and may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. The polypeptides may be modified by either natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination.

Sci. 663:48-62 (1992).)\n\n&lsqb;0041&rsqb; “SEQ ID NO: X” refers to a polynucleotide sequence described, for example, in Tables 1 or 2, while “SEQ ID NO: Y” refers to a polypeptide sequence described in column 6 of Table 1. SEQ ID NO: X is identified by an integer specified in column 4 of Table 1. The polypeptide sequence SEQ ID NO: Y is a translated open reading frame (ORF) encoded by polynucleotide SEQ ID NO: X. “Clone ID NO: Z” refers to a cDNA clone described in column 2 of Table 1.\n\n&lsqb;0042&rsqb; “A polypeptide having biological activity” refers to a polypeptide exhibiting activity similar to, but not necessarily identical to, an activity of a polypeptide of the present invention, including mature forms, as measured in a particular biological assay, with or without dose dependency. In the case where dose dependency does exist, it need not be identical to that of the polypeptide, but rather substantially similar to the dose-dependence in a given activity as compared to the polypeptide of the present invention (i.e., the candidate polypeptide will exhibit greater activity or not more than about 25-fold less and, preferably, not more than about tenfold less activity, and most preferably, not more than about three-fold less activity relative to the polypeptide of the present invention).\n\n&lsqb;0043&rsqb; Table 1 summarizes some of the polynucleotides encompassed by the invention (including contig sequences (SEQ ID NO: X) and clones (Clone ID NO: Z) and further summarizes certain characteristics of these polynucleotides and the polypeptides encoded thereby.\n\n&lsqb;0044&rsqb; Polynucleotides and Polypeptides\n\n&lsqb;0045&rsqb; Table 1\n\n&lsqb;0046&rsqb; Table 1 is provided on CD-R, hereby incorporated by reference herein.\n\n&lsqb;0047&rsqb; The first column in Table 1, “Gene No.”, numbers each disclosed cDNA clone related to the sequences sequentially. The second column in Table 1 provides a unique “Clone ID NO: Z” for a cDNA clone related to each contig sequence disclosed in Table 1. This clone ID references the cDNA clone which contains at least the 5′ most sequence of the assembled contig, and at least a portion of SEQ ID NO: X was determined by directly sequencing the referenced clone. The reference clone may have more sequence than described in the sequence listing or the clone may have less. In the vast majority of cases, however, the clone is believed to encode a full-length polypeptide. In the case where a clone is not full-length, a full-length cDNA can be obtained by methods known in the art and/or as described elsewhere herein.\n\n&lsqb;0048&rsqb; The third column in Table 1 provides a unique “Contig ID” identification for each contig sequence. The fourth column provides the “SEQ ID NO: X” identifier for each of the colon cancer associated contig polynucleotide sequences disclosed in Table 1. The fifth column, “ORF (From-To)”, provides the location (i.e., nucleotide position numbers) within the polynucleotide sequence “SEQ ID NO: X” that delineate the preferred open reading frame (ORF) shown in the sequence listing and referenced in Table 1, column 6, as SEQ ID NO: Y. Where the nucleotide position number “To” is lower than the nucleotide position number “From”, the preferred ORF is the reverse complement of the referenced polynucleotide sequence.\n\n&lsqb;0049&rsqb; The six column in Table 1 provides the corresponding SEQ ID NO: Y for the polypeptide sequence encoded by the preferred ORF delineated in column 5. In one embodiment, the invention provides an amino acid sequence comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polypeptide encoded by the portion of SEQ ID NO: X delineated by “ORF (From-To)”. Also provided are polynucleotides encoding such amino acid sequences and the complementary strand thereto.\n\n&lsqb;0050&rsqb; Column 7 in Table 1 lists residues comprising epitopes contained in the polypeptides encoded by the preferred ORF (SEQ ID NO: Y), as predicted using the algorithm of Jameson and Wolf, (1988) Comp. Appl. Biosci. 4:181-186. The Jameson-Wolf antigenic analysis was performed using the computer program PROTEAN (Version 3.11 for the Power MacIntosh, DNASTAR, Inc., 1228 South Park Street Madison, Wis.). In specific embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, at least one, two, three, four, five or more of the predicted epitopes as described in Table 1. It will be appreciated that depending on the analytical criteria used to predict antigenic determinants, the exact address of the determinant may vary slightly.\n\n&lsqb;0051&rsqb; Column 8 in Table 1 provides an expression profile and library code: count for each of the contig sequences (SEQ ID NO: X) disclosed in Table 1, which can routinely be combined with the information provided in Table 4 and used to determine the normal or diseased tissues, cells, and/or cell line libraries which predominantly express the polynucleotides of the invention. The first number in column 8 (preceding the colon), represents the tissue/cell source identifier code corresponding to the code and description provided in Table 4. For those identifier codes in which the first two letters are not “AR”, the second number in column 8 (following the colon) represents the number of times a sequence corresponding to the reference polynucleotide sequence was identified in the tissue/cell source. Those tissue/cell source identifier codes in which the first two letters are “AR” designate information generated using DNA array technology. Utilizing this technology, cDNAs were amplified by PCR and then transferred, in duplicate, onto the array. Gene expression was assayed through hybridization of first strand cDNA probes to the DNA array. cDNA probes were generated from total RNA extracted from a variety of different tissues and cell lines. Probe synthesis was performed in the presence of 33P dCTP, using oligo(dT) to prime reverse transcription. After hybridization, high stringency washing conditions were employed to remove non-specific hybrids from the array. The remaining signal, emanating from each gene target, was measured using a Phosphorimager. Gene expression was reported as Phosphor Stimulating Luminescence (PSL) which reflects the level of phosphor signal generated from the probe hybridized to each of the gene targets represented on the array. A local background signal subtraction was performed before the total signal generated from each array was used to normalize gene expression between the different hybridizations. The value presented after “&lsqb;array code&rsqb;:” represents the mean of the duplicate values, following background subtraction and probe normalization. One of skill in the art could routinely use this information to identify normal and/or diseased tissue(s) which show a predominant expression pattern of the corresponding polynucleotide of the invention or to identify polynucleotides which show predominant and/or specific tissue and/or cell expression. The sequences disclosed herein have been determined to be predominantly expressed in ovarian tissues, including normal and diseased ovarian tissues (See Table 1, column 8 and Table 4).\n\n&lsqb;0052&rsqb; Column 9 in Table 1 provides a chromosomal map location for certain polynucleotides of the invention. Chromosomal location was determined by finding exact matches to EST and cDNA sequences contained in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) UniGene database. Each sequence in the UniGene database is assigned to a “cluster”; all of the ESTs, cDNAs, and STSs in a cluster are believed to be derived from a single gene. Chromosomal mapping data is often available for one or more sequence(s) in a UniGene cluster; this data (if consistent) is then applied to the cluster as a whole. Thus, it is possible to infer the chromosomal location of a new polynucleotide sequence by determining its identity with a mapped UniGene cluster.\n\n&lsqb;0053&rsqb; A modified version of the computer program BLASTN (Altshul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990), and Gish et al., Nat. Genet. 3:266-272 (1993)) was used to search the UniGene database for EST or cDNA sequences that contain exact or near-exact matches to a polynucleotide sequence of the invention (the ‘Query’). A sequence from the UniGene database (the ‘Subject’) was said to be an exact match if it contained a segment of 50 nucleotides in length such that 48 of those nucleotides were in the same order as found in the Query sequence. If all of the matches that met this criteria were in the same UniGene cluster, and mapping data was available for this cluster, it is indicated in Table 1 under the heading “Cytologic Band”. Where a cluster had been further localized to a distinct cytologic band, that band is disclosed; where no banding information was available, but the gene had been localized to a single chromosome, the chromosome is disclosed.\n\n&lsqb;0054&rsqb; Once a presumptive chromosomal location was determined for a polynucleotide of the invention, an associated disease locus was identified by comparison with a database of diseases which have been experimentally associated with genetic loci. The database used was the Morbid Map, derived from OMIM™ (supra). If the putative chromosomal location of a polynucleotide of the invention (Query sequence) was associated with a disease in the Morbid Map database, an OMIM reference identification number was noted in column 10, Table 1, labeled “OMIM Disease Reference(s)”. Table 5 is a key to the OMIM reference identification numbers (column 1), and provides a description of the associated disease in Column 2.\n\n&lsqb;0055&rsqb; Table 2\n\n&lsqb;0056&rsqb; Table 2 is provided on CD-R, hereby incorporated by reference herein.\n\n&lsqb;0057&rsqb; Table 2 further characterizes certain encoded polypeptides of the invention, by providing the results of comparisons to protein and protein family databases. The first column provides a unique clone identifier, “Clone ID NO: ”, corresponding to a cDNA clone disclosed in Table 1. The second column provides the unique contig indentifier, “Contig ID:” which allows correlation with the information in Table 1. The third column provides the sequence identifier, “SEQ ID NO: X”, for the contig polynucleotide sequences. The fourth column provides the analysis method by which the homology/identity disclosed in the row was determined. The fifth column provides a description of PFam/NR hits having significant matches identified by each analysis. Column six provides the accession number of the PFam/NR hit disclosed in the fifth column. Column seven, “Score/Percent Identity”, provides a quality score or the percent identity, of the hit disclosed in column five. Comparisons were made between polypeptides encoded by polynucleotides of the invention and a non-redundant protein database (herein referred to as “NR”), or a database of protein families (herein referred to as “PFam”), as described below.\n\n&lsqb;0058&rsqb; The NR database, which comprises the NBRF PIR database, the NCBI GenPept database, and the SIB SwissProt and TrEMBL databases, was made non-redundant using the computer program nrdb2 (Warren Gish, Washington University in Saint Louis). Each of the polynucleotides shown in Table 1, column 4 (e.g., SEQ ID NO: X or the ‘Query’ sequence) was used to search against the NR database. The computer program BLASTX was used to compare a 6-frame translation of the Query sequence to the NR database (for information about the BLASTX algorithm please see Altshul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990), and Gish et al., Nat. Genet. 3:266-272 (1993)). A description of the sequence that is most similar to the Query sequence (the highest scoring ‘Subject’) is shown in column five of Table 2 and the database accession number for that sequence is provided in column six. The highest scoring ‘Subject’ is reported in Table 2 if (a) the estimated probability that the match occurred by chance alone is less than 1.0e-07, and (b) the match was not to a known repetitive element. BLASTX returns alignments of short polypeptide segments of the Query and Subject sequences which share a high degree of similarity; these segments are known as High-Scoring Segment Pairs or HSPs. Table 2 reports the degree of similarity between the Query and the Subject for each HSP as a percent identity in Column 7. The percent identity is determined by dividing the number of exact matches between the two aligned sequences in the HSP, dividing by the number of Query amino acids in the HSP and multiplying by 100. The polynucleotides of SEQ ID NO: X which encode the polypeptide sequence that generates an HSP are delineated by columns 8 and 9 of Table 2.\n\n&lsqb;0059&rsqb; The PFam database, PFam version 5.2, (Sonnhammer et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 26:320-322, (1998)) consists of a series of multiple sequence alignments; one alignment for each protein family. Each multiple sequence alignment is converted into a probability model called a Hidden Markov Model, or HMM, that represents the position-specific variation among the sequences that make up the multiple sequence alignment (see, e.g., R. Durbin et al., Biological sequence analysis: probabilistic models of proteins and nucleic acids, Cambridge University Press, 1998 for the theory of HMMs). The program HMMER version 1.8 (Sean Eddy, Washington University in Saint Louis) was used to compare the predicted protein sequence for each Query sequence (SEQ ID NO: Y in Table 1) to each of the HMMs derived from PFam version 5.2. A HMM derived from PFam version 5.2 was said to be a significant match to a polypeptide of the invention if the score returned by HMMER 1.8 was greater than 0.8 times the HMMER 1.8 score obtained with the most distantly related known member of that protein family. The description of the PFam family which shares a significant match with a polypeptide of the invention is listed in column 5 of Table 2, and the database accession number of the PFam hit is provided in column 6. Column 7 provides the score returned by HMMER version 1.8 for the alignment. Columns 8 and 9 delineate the polynucleotides of SEQ ID NO: X which encode the polypeptide sequence which shows a significant match to a PFam protein family.\n\n&lsqb;0060&rsqb; As mentioned, columns 8 and 9 in Table 2, “NT From” and “NT To”, delineate the polynucleotides of “SEQ ID NO: X” that encode a polypeptide having a significant match to the PFam/NR database as disclosed in the fifth column of Table 2. In one embodiment, the invention provides a protein comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotides of SEQ ID NO: X delineated in columns 8 and 9 of Table 2. Also provided are polynucleotides encoding such proteins, and the complementary strand thereto.\n\n&lsqb;0061&rsqb; The nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO: X and the translated SEQ ID NO: Y are sufficiently accurate and otherwise suitable for a variety of uses well known in the art and described further below. For instance, the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO: X are useful for designing nucleic acid hybridization probes that will detect nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID NO: X or the cDNA contained in Clone ID NO: Z. These probes will also hybridize to nucleic acid molecules in biological samples, thereby enabling immediate applications in chromosome mapping, linkage analysis, tissue identification and/or typing, and a variety of forensic and diagnostic methods of the invention. Similarly, polypeptides identified from SEQ ID NO: Y may be used to generate antibodies which bind specifically to these polypeptides, or fragments thereof, and/or to the polypeptides encoded by the cDNA clones identified in, for example, Table 1.\n\n&lsqb;0062&rsqb; Nevertheless, DNA sequences generated by sequencing reactions can contain sequencing errors. The errors exist as misidentified nucleotides, or as insertions or deletions of nucleotides in the generated DNA sequence. The erroneously inserted or deleted nucleotides cause frame shifts in the reading frames of the predicted amino acid sequence. In these cases, the predicted amino acid sequence diverges from the actual amino acid sequence, even though the generated DNA sequence may be greater than 99.9% identical to the actual DNA sequence (for example, one base insertion or deletion in an open reading frame of over 1000 bases).\n\n&lsqb;0063&rsqb; Accordingly, for those applications requiring precision in the nucleotide sequence or the amino acid sequence, the present invention provides not only the generated nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ ID NO: X, and a predicted translated amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO: Y, but also a sample of plasmid DNA containing cDNA Clone ID NO: Z (deposited with the ATCC on Jun. 5, 2000, having the ATCC designation numbers PTA-1982 and PTA-1985; and/or as set forth, for example, in Table 1, 6 and 7). The nucleotide sequence of each deposited clone can readily be determined by sequencing the deposited clone in accordance with known methods. Further, techniques known in the art can be used to verify the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO: X.\n\n&lsqb;0064&rsqb; The predicted amino acid sequence can then be verified from such deposits. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by a particular clone can also be directly determined by peptide sequencing or by expressing the protein in a suitable host cell containing the deposited human cDNA, collecting the protein, and determining its sequence.\n\n&lsqb;0065&rsqb; RACE Protocol for Recovery of Full-Length Genes\n\n&lsqb;0066&rsqb; Partial cDNA clones can be made full-length by utilizing the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) procedure described in Frohman, M. A., et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:8998-9002 (1988). A cDNA clone missing either the 5′ or 3′ end can be reconstructed to include the absent base pairs extending to the translational start or stop codon, respectively. In some cases, cDNAs are missing the start codon of translation. The following briefly describes a modification of this original 5′ RACE procedure. Poly A&plus; or total RNA is reverse transcribed with Superscript II (Gibco/BRL) and an antisense or complementary primer specific to the cDNA sequence. The primer is removed from the reaction with a Microcon Concentrator (Amicon). The first-strand cDNA is then tailed with dATP and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (Gibco/BRL). Thus, an anchor sequence is produced which is needed for PCR amplification. The second strand is synthesized from the dA-tail in PCR buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus), an oligo-dT primer containing three adjacent restriction sites (XhoI, SalI and ClaI) at the 5′ end and a primer containing just these restriction sites. This double-stranded cDNA is PCR amplified for 40 cycles with the same primers as well as a nested cDNA-specific antisense primer. The PCR products are size-separated on an ethidium bromide-agarose gel and the region of gel containing cDNA products the predicted size of missing protein-coding DNA is removed. cDNA is purified from the—agarose with the Magic PCR Prep kit (Promega), restriction digested with XhoI or SalI, and ligated to a plasmid such as pBluescript SKII (Stratagene) at XhoI and EcoRV sites. This DNA is transformed into bacteria and the plasmid clones sequenced to identify the correct protein-coding inserts. Correct 5′ ends are confirmed by comparing this sequence with the putatively identified-homologue and overlap with the partial cDNA clone. Similar methods known in the art and/or commercial kits are used to amplify and recover 3′ ends.\n\n&lsqb;0067&rsqb; Several quality-controlled kits are commercially available for purchase. Similar reagents and methods to those above are supplied in kit form from Gibco/BRL for both 5′ and 3′ RACE for recovery of full length genes. A second kit is available from Clontech which is a modification of a related technique, SLIC (single-stranded ligation to single-stranded cDNA), developed by Dumas et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 19:5227-32 (1991). The major differences in procedure are that the RNA is alkaline hydrolyzed after reverse transcription and RNA ligase is used to join a restriction site-containing anchor primer to the first-strand cDNA. This obviates the necessity for the dA-tailing reaction which results in a polyT stretch that is difficult to sequence past.\n\n&lsqb;0068&rsqb; An alternative to generating 5′ or 3′ cDNA from RNA is to use cDNA library double-stranded DNA. An asymmetric PCR-amplified antisense cDNA strand is synthesized with an antisense cDNA-specific primer and a plasmid-anchored primer. These primers are removed and a symmetric PCR reaction is performed with a nested cDNA-specific antisense primer and the plasmid-anchored primer.\n\n&lsqb;0069&rsqb; RNA Ligase Protocol for Generating the 5′ or 3′ End Sequences to Obtain Full Length Genes\n\n&lsqb;0070&rsqb; Once a gene of interest is identified, several methods are available for the identification of the 5′ or 3′ portions of the gene which may not be present in the original cDNA plasmid. These methods include, but are not limited to, filter probing, clone enrichment using specific probes and protocols similar and identical to 5′ and 3′ RACE. While the full length gene may be present in the library and can be identified by probing, a useful method for generating the 5′ or 3′ end is to use the existing sequence information from the original cDNA to generate the missing information. A method similar to 5′ RACE is available for generating the missing 5′ end of a desired full-length gene. (This method was published by Fromont-Racine et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 21(7):1683-1684 (1993)). Briefly, a specific RNA oligonucleotide is ligated to the 5′ ends of a population of RNA presumably containing full-length gene RNA transcript. A primer set containing a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to a known sequence of the gene of interest, is used to. PCR amplify-the 5′ portion of the desired full length gene which may then be sequenced and used to generate the full length gene. This method starts with total RNA isolated from the desired source, poly A RNA may be used but is not a prerequisite for this procedure. The RNA preparation may then be treated with phosphatase if necessary to eliminate 5′ phosphate groups on degraded or damaged RNA, which may interfere with the later RNA ligase step. The phosphatase, if used, is then inactivated and the RNA is treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase in order to remove the cap structure present at the 5′ ends of messenger RNAs. This reaction leaves a 5′ phosphate group at the 5′ end of the cap cleaved RNA which can then be ligated to an RNA oligonucleotide using T4 RNA ligase. This modified RNA preparation can then be used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis using a gene specific oligonucleotide. The first strand synthesis reaction can then be used as a template for PCR amplification of the desired 5′ end using a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to the known sequence of the ovarian antigen of interest. The resultant product is then sequenced and analyzed to confirm that the 5′ end sequence belongs to the relevant ovarian antigen.\n\n&lsqb;0071&rsqb; The present invention also relates to vectors or plasmids, which include such DNA sequences, as well as the use of the DNA sequences. The material deposited with the ATCC (deposited with the ATCC on Jun. 5, 2000, having the ATCC designation numbers PTA-1982 and PTA-1985; and/or as set forth, for example, in Table 1, 6 and 7) is a mixture of cDNA clones derived from a variety of human tissue and cloned in either a plasmid vector or a phage vector, as shown, for example, in Table 7.
