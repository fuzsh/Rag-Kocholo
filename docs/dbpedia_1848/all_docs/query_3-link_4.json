        "meta_description": "The spectrum of CSF1R-related disorder ranges from early-onset disease (age <18 years) to late-onset disease (age ≥18 years). Early-onset disease is associated with hypotonia, delayed acquisition of developmental milestones, and non-neurologic manifestations (such as skeletal abnormalities); both early- and late-onset disease have similar neurodegenerative involvement. Most affected individuals eventually become bedridden with spasticity, rigidity, and loss of the ability to walk. They lose speech and voluntary movement and appear to be generally unaware of their surroundings. The last stage of disease progresses to a vegetative state with presence of primitive reflexes, such as visual and tactile grasp, mouth-opening reflex, and sucking reflex. Death most commonly results from pneumonia or other infections. About 500 individuals with CSF1R-related disorder have been reported to date.",

        "text": "Option 1\n\nA multigene panel that includes CSF1R and other genes of interest (in probands with early or late onset, a leukodystrophy and leukoencephalopathy or Parkinson disease and parkinsonism panel; in probands with early onset specifically, a skeletal disorders or brain malformations panel; in probands with late onset specifically, a movement disorders or dementia panel; see Differential Diagnosis) is most likely to identify the genetic cause of the condition while limiting identification of variants of uncertain significance and pathogenic variants in genes that do not explain the underlying phenotype. Note: (1) The genes included in the panel and the diagnostic sensitivity of the testing used for each gene vary by laboratory and are likely to change over time. (2) Some multigene panels may include genes not associated with the condition discussed in this GeneReview. (3) In some laboratories, panel options may include a custom laboratory-designed panel and/or custom phenotype-focused exome analysis that includes genes specified by the clinician. (4) Methods used in a panel may include sequence analysis, deletion/duplication analysis, and/or other non-sequencing-based tests.\n\nFor an introduction to multigene panels click here. More detailed information for clinicians ordering genetic tests can be found here.\n\nFindings Shared by Early- and Late-Onset CSF1R-Related Disorder\n\nSpeech abnormalities usually include dysarthria and/or aphasia. Of note, not infrequently, dysarthria co-occurs with aphasia.\n\nDysarthria denotes slurring of speech and affects more than 50% of individuals [Konno et al 2017, Dulski et al 2023c, Wu et al 2024]. It is most often of mixed type, including spastic, hypokinetic with cerebellar features that may manifest as a strained voice, hypophonia (soft speech), slow rate of speech, monotonicity, excessive or reduced stress on syllables, or inappropriate variation in pitch.\n\nAphasia refers to disturbances of language production (motor or non-fluent aphasia) or comprehension (sensory or fluent aphasia). Although there are no systematic studies on the subtypes of aphasia in CSF1R-related disorder, limited evidence suggests the motor subtype is more common [Lee et al 2015, Daida et al 2017, Konno et al 2017, Jiang et al 2022].\n\nCognitive impairment occurs to some extent in virtually all individuals and may be the first manifestation or appear later in the disease course. The major components of cognitive decline are processing speed, executive function, word retrieval, and visual problem solving [Rush et al 2023]. These progressive findings are the primary cause of loss of independence in activities of daily living [Konno et al 2017, Konno et al 2018, Dulski et al 2023c, Rush et al 2023].\n\nPyramidal signs include spasticity, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response, hemiparesis, and/or quadriparesis.\n\nExtrapyramidal signs\n\nParkinsonism (hypomimia, rigidity, bradykinesia, shuffling gait, postural instability, resting and/or kinetic tremor) is common and most often of the non-tremor dominant subtype [Sundal et al 2013].\n\nDystonia may be isolated to one body part, one side of the body, or generalized. It may be a part of a corticobasal syndrome [Baba et al 2006, Sundal et al 2013].\n\nMyoclonus may resemble tremor in individuals with polymyoclonus (repetitive low-amplitude myoclonus).\n\nCerebellar involvement can include ataxia (lack of coordination), dysmetria (imprecise movement control), cerebellar tremor (involuntary shaking during movement), dysdiadochokinesia (difficulty with rapid alternating movements), scanning speech (abnormal speech pattern), and nystagmus (involuntary eye movement) [Wu et al 2024].\n\nNotably, in most individuals motor signs may occur in varying combinations (e.g., pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs). For instance, it is common to observe increased muscle tone of mixed spastic-rigid type.\n\nDysphagia (swallowing disturbances) is more common in individuals with severe neurologic deficits [Konno et al 2017, Dulski et al 2023c]. It may encompass difficulty initiating swallowing, sensation of food sticking in the throat or chest, regurgitation, coughing or choking during meals, recurrent pneumonia (due to aspiration), unintentional weight loss, and malnutrition or dehydration.\n\nSensory deficits include impairment of vibration, position, touch, and pain perception as well as impairment of higher integrative sensory functions such as graphesthesia, stereognosis, and sensory neglect on double stimulation.\n\nApraxia (inability to perform certain voluntary purposeful movements despite preserved ability to use the affected body part) may occur in up to one third of individuals [Konno et al 2017].\n\nAstereognosis (inability to identify objects by touch) and agraphesthesia are common. Disturbance of right-left body side recognition, a characteristic feature, is most likely due to involvement of the corpus callosum.\n\nVisual disturbances include homonymous quadrantanopsia or hemianopsia. These manifestations may be due to optic nerve atrophy, for which the pathophysiologic underpinnings are not understood [Shu et al 2016, Dulski et al 2023c].\n\nSeizures. Initial seizure types vary. Generalized seizures seem the most common and tend to occur more frequently in individuals with more severe neurologic deficits. Occasionally, they may be the first manifestation of the disease [Konno et al 2017, Dulski et al 2023c].\n\nNeurobehavioral/psychiatric manifestations. Many individuals report anxiety and symptoms of depression [Rush et al 2023]. There are some reports of findings reminiscent of the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, with personality changes, executive dysfunction, and loss of judgment and insight [Rush et al 2023].\n\nPseudobulbar affect (i.e., uncontrolled crying or laughing disproportionate to the individual's emotional state) has been reported occasionally [Ahmed & Simmons 2013, Robinson et al 2015, Rosenstein et al 2022, Sriram et al 2022].\n\nOther. On average, women develop the first manifestations of late-onset CSF1R-related disorder earlier (age 40 years) than men (age 47 years) [Konno et al 2017].\n\nIntrafamilial variability. Individuals from the same family who have the same CSF1R pathogenic variant(s) do not necessarily have the same clinical manifestations early in the disease course; however, in the end stage, all individuals with CSF1R-related disorder typically have devastating neurologic involvement.\n\nPrognosis. Presence of malformations of cortical development, skeletal deformities, and cognitive impairment as the initial and predominant presentation is usually associated with a worse prognosis, with faster disease progression and earlier disability [Dulski et al 2022a, Dulski et al 2023c, Dulski et al 2024].\n\nMost affected individuals eventually become bedridden with spasticity and rigidity. They lose speech and voluntary movement, and appear to be generally unaware of their surroundings. In the last stage of disease progression, individuals lose their ability to walk and progress to a vegetative state. Primitive reflexes, such as visual and tactile grasp, mouth-opening reflex, and sucking reflex, are present. Death most commonly results from pneumonia or other infections."
