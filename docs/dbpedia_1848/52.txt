How to query this table

All list views have search fields which can be used to search data. You can search for a complete word or you can search for a part of a search term. If you enclose two or more words in double quotes, LOVD will search for the combination of those words only exactly in the order you specify. Note that search terms are case-insensitive and that wildcards such as * are treated as normal text! For all options, like "and", "or", and "not" searches, or searching for prefixes or suffixes, see the table below.

Operator Column type Example Matches Text Arg all entries containing 'Arg' space Text Arg Ser all entries containing 'Arg' and 'Ser' | Text Arg|Ser all entries containing 'Arg' or 'Ser' ! Text !fs all entries not containing 'fs' ^ Text ^p.(Arg all entries beginning with 'p.(Arg' $ Text Ser)$ all entries ending with 'Ser)' ="" Text ="" all entries with this field empty ="" Text ="p.0" all entries exactly matching 'p.0' !="" Text !="" all entries with this field not empty !="" Text !="p.0" all entries not exactly matching 'p.0?' combination Text *|Ter !fs all entries containing '*' or 'Ter' but not containing 'fs' Date 2020 all entries matching the year 2020 | Date 2020-03|2020-04 all entries matching March or April, 2020 !

Numeric !23 all entries not exactly matching 23 < Numeric <23 all entries lower than 23 <= Numeric <=23 all entries lower than, or equal to, 23 > Numeric >23 all entries higher than 23 >= Numeric >=23 all entries higher than, or equal to, 23 combination Numeric >=20 <30 !23 all entries with values from 20 to 29, but not equal to 23

Some more advanced examples:

Example Matches Asian all entries containing 'Asian', 'asian', including 'Caucasian', 'caucasian', etc. Asian !Caucasian all entries containing 'Asian' but not containing 'Caucasian' Asian|African !Caucasian all entries containing 'Asian' or 'African', but not containing 'Caucasian' "South Asian" all entries containing 'South Asian', but not containing 'South East Asian'

To sort on a certain column, click on the column header or on the arrows. If that column is already selected to sort on, the sort order will be swapped. The column currently sorted on has a darker blue background color than the other columns. The up and down arrows next to the column name indicate the current sorting direction. When sorting on any field other than the default, LOVD will sort secondarily on the default sort column.

At his first examination half a year after onset we observed a debilitating frontal syndrome with total loss of insight, along with discrete pyramidal (HP:0007256) and deep sensory signs. During the subsequent 2 years he was in a permanent hyperactive state (HP:0000752), incessantly walking, opening cupboards or clapping his hands, still with only moderate motor, sensory and extrapyramidal signs (HP:0002071). In the fourth year of his disease he had developed complete hemianopia (HP:0012377), and showed gradually increasing rigidity (HP:0002063) in all extremities, as well as primitive brain stem and grasp reflexes (HP:0002476). For 6 years he remained in a vegetative state (HP:0031358) with a general decortical type of rigidity, a weak doll’s eye reaction and spontaneous respiration of Cheyne-Stokes type (HP:0012196) until he succumbed from respiratory infections at 57 years of age. Five consecutive MRI examinations up to 26 months disease duration with DTI showed a symmetric leukoencephalopathy (HP:0002352) with an unusual feature, a progressive rim of decreased diffusion expanding centrifugally through the white matter from the periventricular area of the frontal and occipital horns, leaving apparently disorganized tissue behind the rim.
