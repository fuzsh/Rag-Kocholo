        "text": "That famous Kinks' Flying V is up for sale in July\n\nBetter go raid your piggy bank! The famous Flying V used by Dave Davies from the Kinks is up for sale in July. This guitar is famous on both sides of the Atlantic, as Dave was seen playing it on the TV in 1965 when appearing on Shindig!\n\nDave Davies’ Kinks Gibson Flying V\n\nThe Kinks appeared on the TV in 1965 on the American Shindig show. Dave Davies was seen by the entire nation playing his 1958 Gibson Flying V, strumming it with his arm between the two ‘wings’ of the guitar. Some say that is the ‘proper’ way to play one, but whatever your view is, many associate this guitar with the band.\n\nShindig\n\nThat TV performance in 1965, which you can see below, introduced the band to the American audience and had many talking about Dave’s unique way of playing the guitar.\n\nRefinished and with a repaired heel crack, this Kinks V is well documented. The components are correct. The PAF pickups are undisturbed. The ABR-1 Bridge is correct and original to this instrument. The pickguard was not removed but the electronic components appear to be original.\n\nApart from a few minor repairs, it is listed as ‘all original’ and intact. You can see the Gibson logo has been broken for example, but other than that it is all the real deal. The guitar comes with plenty of documentation to prove its provenance and even includes a bill of sale from 1995 when it sold for $33,150. I suspect t will go for a lot more now though!\n\nWith David Gilmour recently announcing he is auctioning off all his guitars for charity, could 2019 be the year to pick up some classic guitars from rock history?\n\nMore Information\n\nDave Davie’s Kinks Flying V\n\nVideo"
