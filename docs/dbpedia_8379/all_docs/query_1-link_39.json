        "text": "Michael Daves\n\nBluegrass Singing, Guitar & Mandolin\n\nHeralded as “a leading light of the New York bluegrass scene” by the New York Times, Daves has garnered attention for his work with Chris Thile, Steve Martin, Tony Trischka, and Rosanne Cash in addition to his solo performances.\n\nDaves' most recent project is a two-album set, Orchids and Violence, released February 2016 on Nonesuch Records. Both discs are self-produced and have identical track listing of mostly traditional bluegrass songs. The first features straightforward interpretations of them and was recorded live to tape in a 19th-century church by Daves and a band of roots-music innovators: bassist Mike Bub, violinist Brittany Haas, mandolinist Sarah Jarosz, and banjo player and Punch Brother Noam Pikelny. The second disc was recorded in Daves's home studio and includes bass, drums, and electric guitar, mostly played by Daves, and takes a raw, experimental rock approach to the same old-time material. \"The identical track listing makes for a good comparison study,\" says the New York Times music critic Nate Chinen in his review, \"and to his credit, it can be hard to pick which version of a tune is best.\"\n\nDaves previously recorded bluegrass standards on Sleep with One Eye Open, his Nonesuch debut, a duo session with mandolinist Chris Thile (Punch Brothers, Nickel Creek) that earned the pair a 2011 Grammy nomination. The duo makes for \"a rip-roaring partnership,\" writes the New York Times. \"Bluegrass, in their hands, gets roughed up in the best possible way, with skill and fervor, and a touch of abandon.\"\n\nSince 2006 Daves has maintained a weekly residency on Tuesday nights at The Rockwood Music Hall in Manhattan where he continues to draw a devout following, and uses the informal setting to showcase special guest appearances with a who’s who of bluegrass musicians including Noam Pikelny, Chris Eldridge, Sarah Jarosz, and Aoife O’Donovan.\n\nDaves is also an in-demand teacher and noted booster of NYC’s thriving bluegrass music community. In addition to offering private instruction and group classes in Brooklyn (as well as the occasional festival or music camp workshop) Daves recently launched an online school in bluegrass vocals on ArtistWorks.com, the leading music learning website.\n\nwww.michaeldaves.com\n\nWORKSHOP DESCRIPTIONS:\n\nSinging:\n\nIntro to Bluegrass Singing: Style, Technique and Expression (Beg): This class is a good starting point for people who would like to use their voices more and explore what bluegrass style entails. We’ll learn a handful of bluegrass standards transcribed from classic source recordings and study the details of ornamentation, rhythm, and phrasing that give them life and character. We’ll also address some basics of technique including breathing and resonance that can help you get more out of your voice. Finally we will offer some vocal practice strategies, and address the basics of instrumental accompaniment of vocals.\n\nClassic Vocal Duets: Bill Monroe & Jimmy Martin (All Levels): The “Father of Bluegrass Music” Bill Monroe had many great duet partners in his long and storied career, but one of the most notable was Jimmy Martin, who worked with Monroe from 1950-54. The two defined the fiery molten core of bluegrass vocal style through classic recordings such as “I’m Blue I’m Lonesome,” “Sitting Alone in the Moonlight,” “I Hope You Have Learned” and others. We’ll learn a handful of these bluegrass gems and break down the details of ornamentation and phrasing that make these performances pop. Chances are you’ll be hearing these songs in new ways and bringing some authentic details to your own singing by the time we’re done!\n\nVocal Performance Workshop (All Levels): This class will be in a roundtable format where students bring in songs they like to sing, and share them in a welcoming and supportive environment. They will receive individualized critique and encouragement, often resulting in exercises and techniques we can try out as a group. Typical feedback can include work on breathing, resonance, treatment of vowel sounds, learning to recognize and resolve strain -- ways to get more out of the voice you have. The goal is for students to come away with a confidence boost and a few new ideas about how to continue developing their voices on their own.\n\nGuitar:\n\nRhythm Guitar: Charlie Monroe Style (All Levels): Charlie Monroe, as one half of The Monroe Brothers (with his brother Bill), helped invent and define rhythm guitar style in bluegrass music in the 1930s, before it was even called that. In this class we’ll take \"three chords and the truth\" to the next level by learning some of Charlie's signature moves for changing between G, C, D, and A chords. His style was fairly simple, yet very effective, and while the Monroes were often operating at breakneck tempos these simple moves can provide the magic glue for basic chord progressions at any speed."
