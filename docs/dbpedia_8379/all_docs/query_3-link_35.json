If Dave was owed respect before, he deserves even more after this album.”\n\nSPILL MAGAZINE “This is an album in every sense of the word…A terrific album\"\n\nCONSEQUENCE OF SOUND “Never have they sounded as locked-in as they do on new track Path Is Long. Good, honest, traditional songs that play to each songwriter’s strengths.”\n\nSONG WRITING MAGAZINE “A revealing and rewarding listen – a sentimental and carefully crafted album”"
