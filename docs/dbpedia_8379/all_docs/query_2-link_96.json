        "text": "This post comes half on the back of a Facebook share the other day, with a posting of a great clip featuring some of this country’s greatest Lanarkshire-based songwriters, musicians and hip young gunslingers playing together as a sort of supergroup for an early 90s BBC Scotland show. The group, led by an unusually instrument-free Norman Blake tear their way through a faithful and loud version of The Kinks Till The End Of The Day. It had me quite rightly scampering back to the original version and for today at least, it’s been blaring out the patio windows and entertaining any neighbours within earshot.\n\nIt’s a proper Kinks stomper.\n\nIn those early-ish days, you could roughly categorise yr Kinks recordings into two distinct camps. On the one side you had the slashing, F-shaped proto-punk riffing, made more menacing and crucial with Dave Davies’s unplanned razor blade attack on the speaker cone of his Elpico amp. In those feral, thrilling early Kinks stompers – You Really Got Me, All Day And All Of The Night, I Need You et al – you can hear in their livewire guitars and monophonic thunk the birth of the Stooges and all that followed. They are undeniably influential, but more important than that, they are extremely exciting records.\n\nOn the other side you had the more reflective songs. Waterloo Sunset, Well Respected Man, Dead End Street and Dedicated Follower Of Fashion ring with brightly scrubbed major-to-minor acoustic guitars behind whistleable electric riffs, shifting the mood with their descending woody basslines and carefully worked out whimsical backing vocals. It’s these songs – every one of them a solid gold standard – that set Ray Davies apart from the leaders of any other beat groups bar The Beatles.\n\nSome of their songs straddle both sides. The choppy riffing and wistful reflection of Set Me Free and the meaty yet melancholic Where Have All The Good Times Gone? spring straight to mind. The Kinks had the golden touch of fusing muscle with melody. Till The End Of The Day, as you well know, falls firmly into the former camp.\n\nThe Kinks – Till The End Of The Day\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1-29-till-the-end-of-the-day.mp3\n\nThree lightly vibratoed guitar chords, almost at the edge of Vox-ish breaking point, almost in tune, precede a Ray Davies line that’s totally at odds (as it turns out) with his actual frame of mind. “Baby I feel good!” he announces brightly, before the other Kinks fall in behind him like the beat group to end all beat groups. Guitars clang and buzz and see and saw, their choppy rhythm held in place by the tumbling of heavy furniture and silver cutlery that announces the drums’ arrival. The band gives it their all from start to finish, playing as if this might be the last time anyone allows them inside a recording studio, and it’s a riot.\n\nThe Kinks – and this being the murkier end of showbiz, so that might mean Clem Cantini or Jimmy Page or Nicky Hopkins as well as/instead of the actual Davies brothers and Quaife and Avory – do their fair share of the heavy lifting. It’s all in the incidentals. The drum fills are spectacular, ride and crash cymbals splashing golden metallic sunshine on the high end before taking the whole thing to heaven in double time for the closing seconds. The electric guitars are supremely disciplined, squeezing out chunky chords in the verses then galloping at a hundred miles an hour at the end of each fourth line. Dave Davies (?) rattles off a fat-free solo, the thin single coils of his Telecaster cutting through the stew for a dozen ear-splitting seconds.\n\nIf you can shake free of the heavy riot that’s unfolding around them, then it’s the backing vocals that are especially worthy of your undivided attention. Ray sings those opening lines – “Baby I feel good…right through from…” and then immediately, someone – Dave, I think, as he has that Davies family tone to his voice (and surely Ray won’t have double tracked himself on the 4 tracks, or however it was they recorded this holy riot) harmonises with a perfect “mo-or-ning“…and at the same time, the other two Kinks underpin the harmony with an almost buried descending “oooh-ooh-ooh” harmony. Four Kinks, doing their equal share of the heavy lifting. Here they come again in the bridge…and again at the end of the first verse…and anywhere else they can fit a harmony or a double-tracked key word to the proceedings. The Kinks: a beat group who can arrange the fuck out of a simple set of chords.\n\nSo, yeah, it’s essentially the band’s own All Day And All Of The Night recast as if the group had continued playing long after the needle had buried itself in that single’s dead wax, but man! It’s a ripper, a properly great modish stomper that’s as electric as The Who, as melodic as The Beatles but with a beating r’n’b heart the equal of anything the mid ’60s Stones put out. What’s maybe surprising is that it was written to order. The Kinks’ management had no sympathy for a writer suffering a rare bout of writer’s block and sent American songwriting heavyweight Doc Pomus to his door in an attempt to shake him out of it. It seems to have worked. A song that ended up with a lyric about someone feeling trapped and frustrated in a relationship was essentially Davie’s autobiographical dig at his management.\n\nAnd that Bellshill Beatles Norman Blake-fronted cover that’s had me digging out my old Kinks Kompilation these past few days? I like to think that particular supergroup tackled The Kinks track purely because their hero Alex Chilton was such a fan. Chilton was certainly around that circle of musicians at the time and his influence can’t be underplayed. Should you wish, you can find Big Star’s version of Till The End Of The Day on the expanded CD of Third/Sister Lovers, but – heresy!- I much prefer the late 00’s version that Alex recorded with Ray Davies.\n\nAlex Chilton & Ray Davies – Till The End Of The Day\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ray-davies-and-alex-chilton-till-the-end-of-the-day.mp3\n\nSome shimmering Hammond, some great Alex ‘n Ray harmonies, a rockin’ Chilton solo that maybe even outdoes the original; it’s a great cover.\n\nThe good old days. A world of half-day closing and half-pints at lunchtime. A world of “‘allo Mrs Jones, ‘ow’s your Bert’s lumbago?“, black and white telly where “Leeds are playing in yellow” and pop groups are “bigger than Jesus.” A world where you got today’s news tomorrow and change from a two bob trip to see two top films at the La Scala. A world of Dansettes ‘n desert boots, when the 7″ was king and the clothes you wore were an extension of the music you listened to. Aye, the good old days, when R’n’B meant rhythm and blues rather than Rihanna and Beyoncé.\n\nSittin’ On My Sofa by The Kinks is a fantastic piece of throwaway pop. On the b-side of 1966’s Dedicated Follower Of Fashion, it’s rarely mentioned when the genius of Ray Davies is discussed. And why would it? It’s hardly a lyrical tour de force. There’s no wry observational wordplay going on. And there’s no interesting baroque pop arrangement or well-constructed melodic break to hang your hat on. It’s a 3 chord R’n’B stomper, flung together with insistent urgency. That’s all. And that’s all y’need.\n\n*( I find if you read the above paragraph in the style of the much-loved Brian Matthews, it adds to the overall feel of the piece).\n\n“OK chaps,” Shel Talmy perhaps said from the control room that day, inbetween long drags on a Rothman’s King Size. “We need a b-side. We’ve got half an hour then we’re outta here. Whadayagot?”\n\nThey had this.\n\nThe Kinks – Sittin’ On My Sofa\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1-33-sittin-on-my-sofa.mp3\n\nIt’s battered and bruised but plays as good as it first did, 51½ years ago.\n\nWall to wall AC30s at room-rattlin’ volume. Snarling guitars. Ropey backing vocals. A bit of feedback in the sloppy solo. They even found time to overdub a barrelhouse pianer. Four perfectly turned-out heads, bobbing in time to the glorious racket they’re making. It sounds as though the band enjoyed playing it. By 1966 The Kinks were writing increasingly sophisticated songs and on the cusp of a run of concept albums, so it must’ve been great to get back to the days of dusty coffee houses and 12 bar blues. I’d love love love to have been in the same room when they recorded it. Great, innit?\n\nBands nowadays who describe themselves as ‘mod’ because they’ve got a Pretty Green top and a Small Faces CD between them really need to up their game. Look, listen and learn, losers. Look, listen and learn."
