In full:

Offenbach am Main

Offenbach, city, Hessen Land (state), west-central Germany. Offenbach, a river port, lies on the left bank of the canalized Main River just southeast of Frankfurt am Main. First mentioned in 977, it was part of the imperial forest of Dreieich, and a mint was established there in 1407. It was acquired by count (later prince) von Isenburg-Birstein in 1486 and began its prosperity with an influx of Huguenot craftsmen in 1698–1703. Annexed to Hessen in 1816, it grew steadily until the proximity (downstream to the west) of metropolitan Frankfurt am Main checked further development after World War I. The city was rebuilt after heavy damage in World War II. New buildings include the city hall and several federal offices, including those for meteorological services and customs. Offenbach has a noted tanning and leather-goods industry and is the site of leather and shoe museums and of leather-trade exhibitions. Other important industries include the manufacture of machinery and electrical products, chemicals, and textiles. Landmarks include Isenburg, a castle dating from 1564–78; the alkaline Kaiser Friedrich Spring, feeding a well of 787 feet (240 metres); and the Klingspor Museum of modern calligraphy and book printing. Pop. (2003 est.) 119,208.
