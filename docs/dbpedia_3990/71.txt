History

thumb|left|The 120-meter high "City-Tower". The first documented reference to Offenbach appears in 977. In 1486 the Isenburg Family took control of city, and 1556 Count Reinhard of Isenburg relocated his Residence to Offenbach, building a palace, the Isenburger Schloß, which was completed in 1559. It was destroyed by fire in 1564 and rebuilt in 1578.

In the mid 17th century Offenbach passed into the possession of the Landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt who ruled it until 1815 when the Congress of Vienna gave the city to the Austrian Emperor, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. A year later it was returned to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. The city was ruled by Grand Dukes of Hesse and by Rhine until the monarchy was abolished in 1918.

During the Second World War a third of the city was destroyed by Allied bombing which claimed 467 lives.

With the new district Lauterborn the city was expanded to south in the 1960s.

Offenbach is also the seat of the Deutscher Wetterdienst (German weather service) and home to the soccer club "Kickers Offenbach" and their stadium "Bieberer Berg".

Offenbach is on the Rhine-Main S-Bahn with six stations: Offenbach-Kaiserlei, Offenbach-Ledermuseum, Offenbach-Marktplatz, Offenbach-Ost, Offenbach-Bieber, Bieber-Waldhof.
