        "text": "Reflecting on the shape of human products is as old as western philosophy. Admittedly, for a long time the way artifacts were designed was not a problem. This had to do with the idea that in the last instance human products are always only imitations of what Nature creates. The ancient Greeks, for example, as we learn from Aristotle, were of the opinion that even a structure that seems somewhat unnatural, like a house, is nonetheless in essence basically the same as what it is based on, for example a cave. Accordingly, a house is just an improved form of the natural enclosure, which accounts for the core of its being. Correspondingly, thinkers such as Plato considered human improvements to be attempts to do justice to the primeval form of things or the idea underlying them. As such, column portals imitated and at the same time geometrically improved tree trunks, which once gave the porches of huts a befitting appearance, as joined walls imitated the hewn interior of a cave, and windows a view which otherwise only paintings could.\n\nNor did earlier Modernity have any real theoretical problem with the design of artifacts. Equipment and devices that were so improbable they had no precedent in Nature, in the way that the renaissance relied on Classicist predecessors, were considered to be deformities and monsters of nature, which could be viewed together with the wonders of technology in specially established art chambers.\n\nNot until the Industrial Revolution did it become obvious that at long last things shaped by human hand had an inherent right to lay claim to validity. New materials and production technologies enabled even the most everyday objects to boast previously unseen designs that could look absolutely sensational. And at the same time popular taste became radically freed as soon as objects such as these were no longer manufactured just for local markets and needs, but on a global scale and as mass-produced goods. The presentation of industrial products at world expositions from the mid-19th century onward marked the cultural seal of approval for both trends.\n\nAt the same time architects and authors such as Gottfried Semper were first weighing up the basic methods for this new creative freedom. The approach pursued back then, namely of entrusting the design of things the engineers, did not have the makings of a permanent solution, just as the opposing tendency to conceal technical innovation behind old shapes came to nothing. Gas lamps which looked like candles, for example, aroused Semper’s theoretical ire. The desire grew in him to give the technical progress a form that would be appropriate to the object in a totally new way. Since Semper formulated his fundamental ideas there have essentially been two established approaches in design theory. One still attempts to consciously pursue the old scheme of an ur-form of things or just as self-consciously distance itself from that. Classicism, on the one hand, and forms of decadence, on the other, alternate or at least interact with one another. Even the late 19th century was confronted with opposing trends, something that goes back to the reduction of forms to the original idea behind things, or vice versa adopts it with relish, embellishing and reproducing it in a Baroque style. In a similar strategic vein, the late 20th century saw the heyday of postmodernism, which ultimately even succeeded in elevating what was formerly kitsch to the absolute pinnacle of good contemporary taste.\n\nThe other approach in design theory attempts to add a time component to this development of trends. What previously seemed only ideal or decadent is now combined with a basic orientation to the past or what is to come. Accordingly, in the second half of the 19th century the Arts and Crafts Movement dared cast a determined look backwards. The desired retrogression to an ur-form of things was associated with a return to a crafts method of production in the hope that this would enable the right forms to be re-created if only by making them in the same way as had previously been the case. A basic difficulty with this approach is discernible in the context that whereas earlier a specific shape had served as a guide for craftsmanship, the return to this craftsmanship was now itself intended to spawn the guideline. Every form of Romanticism ultimately thrives on the notion that it is cultivating a past, to which it basically no longer has any real access. Seen this way, however primordial a form may seem to be, it always has something magical about it, too. Attempts to come to terms conceptually with this basic difficulty stretch from John Ruskin to Richard Sennett.\n\nAs well as looking back, as cultivated by the Modernists design theory looks forwards. Inasmuch as it counters the decline of design, this too can be considered a conservative approach. Unlike with the Romantic movements, Modernist manufacturing technologies were regarded as capable of providing decisive information about the design and essence of objects. In the early 1920s the Werkbund, for example, gave rise to the Bauhaus movement, with Walter Gropius thus laying the theoretical foundations for it. To his mind, the new design principle was particularly vivid in architecture, because glass and concrete were not just new materials that were increasingly being used for reasons of cost, they were also the basis for totally rethinking the building principle itself – and with it the associated experience of living in such edifices. Load-bearing features such as concrete and steel girder structures gave rise to spatial designs that enabled clear geometric lines and generous lighting. In Gropius’ opinion, the essence of Modernist architecture and interior design initially only exposed the thrust of a Modern life-style, which, however, intrinsically always had people in mind. It is a feeling that can repeatedly be provoked, by occasionally succumbing to the nostalgia of old living-room Rromanticism while, at the sight of cool elegance, being unable to do anything other than breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThe time was ripe for the final theoretical step in design theory to date: in the post-War era the notion of basing design on past or future ideals itself became suspicious, thus necessitating deep thought about its meaning and purpose. Since the 1950s, HfG Ulm and later HfG Offenbach have made important contributions to critical enquiries in this regard. With Dieter Rams, Otl Aicher and others, on the one hand, this involved retaining clear lines in design without, however, taking on the predecessors’ metaphysics (whereby we assume here that metaphysics means elevating design to a major art form which also claims to foster significance and improve the world). At HfG Ulm and elsewhere, the opinion was that if a fire extinguisher was designed such that it worked perfectly and was easy to use, then that was enough. As such, it did not have to look like a piece of Art Deco as well.\n\nOn the other, describing the objects in a sober but apt way instead of idealizing and aestheticizing them was an obvious move. The theory of product language developed primarily by Jochen Gros und Bernhard E. Bürdek in the 1970s and 1980s at HfG Offenbach attempted to do justice to this. A description in terms of product language brought to light the design principle the object was based on. Together, symbols for how the product should be handled in practical terms, the symbolic form required for it to assert itself in social contexts and an appreciation of the form and aesthetics of the lines and appearance now defined the basic idea of design. The approach proved flexible enough to absorb the anti-classic trends of post-Modernism in the 1990s without, however, at the same time endorsing them.\n\nThe early 21st century ultimately confronted design theory with new, fundamental challenges. Innovations were the result not least of all of technical progress, which has now advanced sufficiently to fundamentally change the requirements previously made on design. To date it was considered agreed that the designer first had to make technical devices with a complex internal life accessible and easy to handle. The underlying idea is that design is an interface, as developed, for example by Gui Bonsiepe and Peter Sloterdijk. However, with the devices having become smart enough to render their complicated use readily understandable, there is no longer any need for external simplification that draws on the designer’s technical and practical intelligence. As such, many of the questions that previously revolved around the objects’ technical appearance, now appear in a new light, or simply become obsolete. Basically, there is no longer a need to define what the objects’ natural form is when deciding “for or against” the external technical appearance. Technical features no longer have to be concealed or face outwards, as advocated by many of the above trends. Objects to be designed in the future will be seen far more in the context of their handling and an appreciation of them based on the possibility of their being networked with other similar objects, which is a fundamental aspect for the user.\n\nCritical questions such as design’s share in marketing will change, as the external incentives previously provided by the use of design means and advertising will foreseeably lose out in terms of standing as soon as the focus is on the objects being interconnected internally and functionally. Even today it is foreseeable that on the outside lots of devices of a particular category will be identical to one another; one need only think of smartphones, robot vacuum cleaners, and car dashboards. In this context, what is proving to be decisive with regard to the issue of “design” is how the applications are designed, i.e., how, in terms of a display the exterior, which now must apparently always look the same, features meaningful applications and their visual forms.\n\nSo design theory is challenged, against the backdrop of what is now classic teaching, to open up new horizons. At HfG Offenbach one of the basic assumptions has been that the practical training will involve taking a look behind the façade of objects, thereby getting back to their meaningful function. Theory as well must now do justice to this in a new way."
