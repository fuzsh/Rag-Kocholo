        "text": "Having been longtime admirers of each other’s work, designer duo Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas and Kostas Murkudis met for the first time in Paris in 2021. There was strong chemistry between the three and the idea of working on a common project was born very soon. The collaboration should be in-depth, in order to create something truly exceptional that would not have been possible apart from this structure.\n\nThey began to meet regularly and developed a variety of ideas, tested materials and finally crystalized a central topic that fascinated and challenged them: The contrast between density and transparency. SESSION 01 was born, a collection of garments and bags crafted of Scandinavian calfskin and delicate French lace.\n\nWith Kostas as an experienced fashion designer and Esther and Dimitrios as founders of leather bag brand TSATSAS, all pieces of the collection are masterfully constructed by the three designers down to the smallest detail. The choice of leather was an obvious one, given Esther’s and Dimitrios’ background in Germany’s leather capital of Offenbach/Main. The designers agreed, however, to juxtapose the calfskin with a certain lightness, transparency and delicacy – and so came the French lace.\n\nManufactured in the town of Caudry, France, in a family business with more than 130 years of tradition, the cotton lace is a visual and tactile experience. And in combination with the natural soft surface of the leather, the delicate look and feel of the lace is even more special. As a by-product of the meat industry from cattle raised in Scandinavia, the calfskin is tanned in Sweden by one of the most innovative tanneries worldwide. The whole collection is handcrafted in Germany in the family-owned leather workshop of TSATSAS, lovingly made by hand with great skill and dexterity.\n\nIn addition to these materials, another key feature of SESSION 01 is the versatility of each piece. The exceptional cuts of the dresses and tops were created to offer two possibilities of wearing the piece, depending on the preferences of the wearer by allowing the front and back to be variably turned. So each dress and top can be worn back-to-front, depending on which part of the body should be covered or accentuate by leather or lace. A line of bags complements SESSION 01 with exceptional designs, defining the use of materials in new ways.\n\nIt is reminiscent of the structure of a marble stone that has evolved over thousands of years, interspersed with veins and lines, irregular and peculiar, as it can only be found in nature: a hand-sanded marbled nubuck leather provides the basis for the MARMORATO collection and pays respectful homage to the art of craftsmanship.\n\nLeather and marble – the contrast of the materials couldn’t be any greater at first glance, both in their feel and in the way they are processed and utilised. When Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas, while researching for new materials, came across a nubuck leather that seems to unite these exact contrasts, they were fascinated not only by the uniqueness of the material but also by the velvety surface of the hand-sanded leather, and they started working straight away on a small select collection.\n\nThe ivory coloured base tone of the leather is marbled by a distinctive, dark grain structure. Tanned in southern Germany, the nubuck leather is produced from the hides of Central European cattle as a byproduct of the meat industry and coloured in several work-intensive steps during the tanning process. Its characteristic feature is a distinctive tumbled grain pattern, which is elaborately sanded by hand in Italy to achieve an exceptional two-tone effect – the darker coloured natural structure of the hide steps into the focus and turns each hide into a unique piece.\n\nNatural characteristics such as scarring or distinctive wrinkles are not negated, but brought to the attention through refined craftsmanship – the imperfect becomes a distinguishing feature.\n\nDavid Chipperfield, Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas first met in 2017. The chemistry as well as the demands on design and quality coincided, and soon the idea of a joint project was born: the ultimative suitcase, based on the personal needs of the much-travelled architect. SUIT-CASE was presented in 2020 as the result of a multi-year collaboration.\n\nBut the launch was not to be the end of the partnership – the collaboration had convinced the three creatives to jointly develop even more products that complement the travel case and help to organise, structure and enhance everyday life.\n\nIn summer 2022, TSATSAS is presenting the result: THE CASE COLLECTION, an edition of six essentials with a design based on the elegant, minimalist aesthetics of SUIT-CASE. Handcrafted in Germany, the products are of the highest quality and craftsmanship, and their design, reduced to the essential, turns them into constant companions for your everyday life.\n\nBRIEF-CASE was developed in the shape of a traditional attaché case that was first seen in the mid-19th century as a companion of British men. The designers transferred its solid structure into an elegant briefcase, which is understated in design and perfected in terms of craftsmanship and materials, offering enough space for a 16-inch laptop, an organiser and work documents.\n\nThe clear silhouette of the DOCUMENT-CASE conceals an interior perfectly sized to fit an organiser, documents or a 13-inch laptop, with additional inner pockets for a mobile phone and work utensils.\n\nWith CASE 1, 2 and 3, THE CASE COLLECTION offers three flat, minimalist pouches in different sizes, which are zipped for the optimum storage and structure of daily necessities such as charging cables, pens or work utensils.\n\nThe GLASSES-CASE provides a safe place to store your glasses, easy to use thanks to a smart snap closure even in situations on the go.\n\nHandcrafted in Offenbach/Main, Germany, all bags and pouches of the edition are made of calfskin leather, tanned in Germany or Sweden. The incomparable, natural feel of the calfskin is complemented by soft, ivory-coloured lamb nappa leather, which lines all products in the collection. Metal parts such as the polished zippers or the base studs of the items are crafted from recycled brass in Italy.\n\nSince 2012, Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas have been creating leather bags and accessories that are well outside the conventional fashion designs and possess a persuasive formal vocabulary of their own, free of any aesthetic restrictions. Ten years after the launch of TSATSAS, the Deutsches Ledermuseum (German Leather Museum) in Offenbach/Main is now hosting a comprehensive solo exhibition that presents the work of the designer couple and offers detailed insights behind the scenes of the label that has an international reach but is still producing locally in Offenbach/Main.\n\nWith its impressive historical collection of more than 30,000 artefacts, the Deutsches Ledermuseum has been documenting the cultural and historical relevance of leather as a material for over 100 years. However, it also feels obliged to highlight the present around the topic of leather and now integrates with “TSATSAS. Past, Present, Future” the modern yet timeless designs of a young accessory label into the museum.\n\nAs curators of the exhibition, Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas were given the opportunity to let visitors experience their creative work process from their very own personal perspective – from the initial idea for a bag to the transformation of a traditional artisanal craft to the sources of cultural inspiration in contemporary art, design, architecture and music.\n\nWithin the exhibition, elaborate installations show the challenging creative process behind the designer duo’s leather goods. The first design steps that ultimately led to the founding of the label are shown, collaborations with architects and designers are highlighted and the design process up to the final product is illustrated by the example of the TAPE bag.\n\nThe centrepiece is the kinetic installation OBJECTS IN THE MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR. Inside a glass cabinet, models of the TSATSAS collection, created between 2012 and 2022, glide past visitors in a terminal loop. Arranged neither chronologically nor hierarchically, but staged purely intuitively, the 32 different objects melt through their monochromatic presentation into a symbol of the TSATSAS’ visual conciseness. There is no beginning and no end – the retrospective view of the past merges fluidly into the now.\n\n“TSATSAS. Past, Present, Future” is shown at Deutsches Ledermuseum until March 26, 2023. More information on the exhibition can be found at www.ledermuseum.de.\n\nIn the form of ÉTUI, Saskia Diez and Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas are presenting a collaboration that combines the three designers’ respective fields of expertise – a protective leather case for the favorite items of jewelry, that would both store the pieces at home and keep them safe on trips away from home.\n\nÉTUI comes in two different formats – the smaller version, which is a square case, and the larger rectangular version with compartments of several sizes. The cases thus boast enough space for jewelry items of all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe ÉTUI cases are made of soft lamb’s nappa leather that has gone through a special tanning process, allowing it to be used with precious metals. This soft leather not only protects jewelry items, at the same time it provides information about the contents of the relevant case, with the shape of the jewelry pieces showing through the soft leather – a kind of game with the feel of the different materials and something for which the designers have consciously opted.\n\nÉTUI can be closed with a seamed leather strap, easily wrapped around the case and decorated with a tube made in Italy of recycled brass.\n\nwww.saskia-diez.com\n\nFour years after the launch of the first SO_FAR project, TSATSAS presents a second bag edition in a combination of calfskin leather and fabrics designed by Raf Simons for the Danish textile company Kvadrat.\n\nDaring to abandon customary terrain and embark on something completely new gave rise to the SO_FAR project in 2016. Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas expanded their repertoire of materials by getting the opportunity as the very first bag label worldwide to work exclusively with the Kvadrat/Raf Simons fabrics collection – and focused on translating the contrast of textile and leather into a new signature aesthetic for their FLUKE bag.\n\nIn 2020 the designer duo revisited the project, and launched a second edition of SO_FAR, taking it one step further in the form of five variations of the SACAR S shoulder bag.\n\nIn the case of SACAR S, the two materials meet up again – the colour schemes are Concrete, Tan, Black, Ivory and Slate Blue – and add a new nuance to the eye-catching bag, which was to date available only in supple calfskin leather.\n\nPortuguese photographer Andree Martis captured the image of SO_FAR 2. Based in London, she staged the bag edition on a cloudy day on the beach in Brighton – with two dancers from London as the models.\n\nwww.kvadratrafsimons.com\n\nWith the hand-luggage-sized SUIT-CASE architect David Chipperfield and TSATSAS not only define their requirements for a piece of luggage but also their desire for a more mindful approach to travel.\n\nTravel is part and parcel of David Chipperfield’s life. In addition to his architectural projects that take him around the globe the architect’s four offices located variously in Berlin, London, Milan and Shanghai necessitate constant shuttling between these cities. David Chipperfield has spent a large part of the last decades in the air, airports have been his constant companion and a suitcase a means of conveying all those objects needed on a daily basis. “I guess the idea of the bag is personal to me because I have spent most of my life travelling. Instead of complaining that every bag I buy does not work, it has been an opportunity to design a bag that suits my lifestyle,” explains David Chipperfield.\n\nThis idea has been at the back of his mind for years, decades. When he first met Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas in 2017, not only was Chipperfield immediately taken by both the quality of their work both as regards design and material, but the chemistry was likewise right. In this way, the idea of a joint project was born: the ultimate SUIT-CASE.\n\nIn the project spanning more than three years, Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas contributed their design and material expertise while Chipperfield laid down what he required of a suitcase: Hand-luggage size yet with enough space for a short trip with a suit. But as they explored the topic more deeply it became clear that SUIT-CASE was not just about an item of luggage but also about the desire for a different approach to travel in the future. For conscious decisions about which flights are really necessary. A move away from travel as something that is stressful and a mad rush, in the direction of a more conscious perception and experience of travel. Accompanied by a suitcase that as regards material and finish stands for longevity and an appreciation of lasting values.\n\n“Sustainability through design” is a central credo of TSATSAS that applies likewise to the architecture of David Chipperfield. And it is central to the design of SUIT-CASE: The timeless, clear design of a product whose look will not fall out of favor ensures it will survive for many years and it is this enduring quality that makes it stand for true sustainability.\n\nThe minimalist, clear silhouette conceals an interior perfectly organized for storing all needed travel utensils. The case of SUIT-CASE is made of a completely biodegradable, emission-free wood fiber, covered with gold-certified calfskin leather from a German tannery. Its interior is lined with soft lamb nappa leather combined with natural canvas; the metal fittings are made in Italy of recycled brass. SUIT-CASE is completely plastic-free.\n\nConceived as hand luggage, SUIT-CASE is ideally suited for business or weekend trips. Weighing in at just 2,7 kg the suitcase compares well with almost every hard-shell case.\n\nSUIT-CASE is made on demand and available on www.tsatsas.com.\n\nA collaboration with one of today’s most important product designers:\n\nIn December 2018, TSATSAS presented the model 931, a bag designed by Dieter Rams.\n\nDieter Rams, born in 1932 in Wiesbaden/Germany, is considered one of the most influential industrial designers of the past decades. His products for the companies Braun and Vitsoe inspire creatives around the globe to this day. The “Ten principles for good design,” which he formulated from the mid-1970s onwards, pointed even then to the challenges design in particular and our society as a whole are facing today more than ever.\n\nHaving worked in the field of product design for more than 40 years, Dieter Rams is still highly topical. With missionary zeal, he continues to claim to this day that the correct understanding of design can help create a better world.\n\nIn 1963 Dieter Rams designed a handbag made of leather for his wife Ingeborg, whom he met in 1955 when she was working for Braun as a photographer. It was while working for Braun himself, where he was chief designer from 1961 until 1995, that Rams engaged more strongly with the material leather, collaborating with leather crafting workshops in Offenbach/Main for the company’s shaver cases. And it was there that he had the idea of surprising his wife with a leather bag, yet it remained a one-off.\n\n55 years later, TSATSAS introduced this very bag to the market. The label’s design philosophy – to create timeless bags and accessories with a clear design language that give rise to lasting shapes without any aesthetic expiry date – was easy to reconcile with Rams’ expectations of a product.\n\nSo reduced and simultaneously concise that it unavoidably calls to mind Rams products, 931 is as up-to-date today as it was in 1963 and effortlessly bridges five decades of design history.\n\n“If I had a flower for every time I thought of you,\n\nI could walk through my garden forever.”\n\nAlfred Lord Tennyson, 1809-1892\n\nSince time immemorial the beauty of the flower has always been a symbol of admiration and affection – it is said that as long ago as the 15th century people had gifts of flowers delivered to their beloved. In 1908 the first flower gifting service was established in Berlin and on the 1920s streets of New York numerous messengers could be seen delivering flowers that were gifted to women from their male admirers – however, it was not normally a bouquet that was handed over to the recipient but rather a single lavishly-wrapped rose.\n\nIt was the design studio Deutsche & Japaner that came up with the initial idea of reviving this ritual for the AROSE project. However, the focus was to be just as much on the wrapping and ritual of unpacking a single bloom as on the flower itself.\n\nFrom discussions with the bag and accessories label TSATSAS, the idea emerged of creating AROSE as a joint project – but both partners felt that nowadays it was no longer appropriate to devote such lavish packaging to a single flower which would, after all, very quickly wilt.\n\nIn a move to end the transience of the gift Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas, the designers behind TSATSAS, brought the material leather into play: by employing a different material for AROSE the flower would be imbued with timeless beauty.\n\nNow petals of supple lamb nappa leather form an opulent rose – inspired by nature’s own creation. Handcrafted in a fine bag maker’s studio in Offenbach/Main every bloom is not only a one-off but also reflects the uniqueness of nature.\n\nThe leather blossom comes in a matt black box, which reveals a mirror interior when its slip-on lid is removed. The flower rests on an elevated section bearing a mirror-image quotation by British poet Alfred Lord Tennyson from the 19th century, which describes the poetry of the flower: “If I had a flower for every time I thought of you, I could walk through my garden forever.”\n\nwww.deutscheundjapaner.com\n\nIn 1963, Ferdinand Kramer® surprised his wife Lore with a handbag he had specially designed for her. The Frankfurt architect and designer, renowned for his minimalist and Modernist architecture and product designs, created a timeless bag destined to accompany Lore Kramer both during the day and in the evening.\n\n55 years later, TSATSAS is presenting a re-edition of the KRAMER bag. With its timeless feel, functionality and flexibility it very much seems to be a contemporary design and blends seamlessly with the others in the TSATSAS collection.\n\n“OBJECTS THAT ARE TRULY MODERN\n\nREMAIN SO ENDURINGLY.”\n\nAdolf Loos\n\nAn Essay by Katharina Pennoyer\n\nThe re-edition of this handbag by Ferdinand Kramer® is a rather special event: Not many people know that back in the early 1960s Kramer, whose reputation to date has previously derived from his functional buildings and utility objects, designed two handbags and an evening dress for his young wife Lore. He simply didn’t like what was available on the market at the time.\n\nFashion, the world between the twin poles of innovation and endurance, that interplay of colors, shapes and materials, was a field that Kramer, son of the owner of the renowned “Hut-Kramer” store in Frankfurt, explored early on. During the 1920s, this interest was fostered most crucially by Kramer’s relationship with the interior and fashion designer Lilly Reich, later the partner of Mies van der Rohe, and her young, talented student Beate Feith, whom Kramer married in 1930. It was Beate for whom he designed a variety of hats, and he sent her fashion sketches from his trip to Paris in 1925, where he sought out Le Corbusier. During his exile in New York too, and later in Frankfurt, he sketched Beate’s designs for publication in magazines such as LOOK.\n\nNo less important for Kramer’s oeuvre were his encounters in Vienna and Frankfurt with Adolf Loos, that ingenious architect and member of the “Lebensreform” movement, who was 28 years his senior and whom he revered. Indeed, it was Adolf Loos who, in the year of Ferdinand Kramer®’s birth, 1898, defined in his article “The Gentlemen’s Hats” thus:\n\n“Objects that are truly modern remain so enduringly.”*\n\nThe versatile handbag Ferdinand Kramer designed more than five decades ago is one marvelous example of the principle – and which has now been updated by TSATSAS in three different sizes.\n\n*Adolf Loos, Sämtliche Schriften, ed. Franz Glück, Verlag Herold,\n\nVienna, 1962, p.83\n\n“Every day we come into contact with various things. We do not really pay much attention to most of them. They are simply close at hand, we use them, and set them aside again.\n\nHowever, a small number of these things come to mean more to us, become more closely bound up with our lives. They accompany us day by day, over a long period of time. They become our constant companions, we grow fonder and fonder of them, and eventually they become a firm part of us.\n\nIt makes us happy when, time and time again, we meet people who have, over a period of months and years, found a constant companion in a TSATSAS product.\n\nWe have asked a number of these people to show us where and how they share their lives with such a product. The result: Snapshots of our bags and accessories, scenes straight from everyday life, captured on camera.“\n\nEsther and Dimitrios Tsatsas\n\nThe following protagonists were part of the ”Constant Companions“ project,\n\nreleased in December 2017\n\nByron Amanatidis, Berlin, Germany\n\nMichael Anastassiades, London, United Kingdom\n\nSarah Böttger, Wiesbaden, Germany\n\nSilke Bücker, Cologne, Germany\n\nGarth Condit, New York, USA\n\nStefan Dotter, Berlin, Germany\n\nProf. Markus Frenzl, Frankfurt/Main and Munich, Germany\n\nAndreas Friberg Lundgren, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nElise Garcia, Paris, France\n\nVicente Garcia Jimenez, Udine, Italy\n\nAntonia Henschel, Frankfurt/Main, Germany\n\nOliver Jahn, Munich, Germany\n\nElizabeth Jeffer, Chappaqua, USA\n\nGerhardt Kellermann, Munich, Germany\n\nIsabelle Kountoure, London, United Kingdom\n\nMichael Maharam, New York, USA\n\nClaudia Neumann, Cologne, Germany\n\nSven Prothmann, Offenbach/Main, Germany\n\nAna Relvão, Munich, Germany\n\nRemo Röntgen, Dannenberg, Germany\n\nCristina Salvati, Udine, Italy\n\nArtur Tadevosian, Antwerp, Belgium\n\nRobert Volhard, Frankfurt/Main, Germany\n\nCostas Voyatzis, Athens, Greece\n\nMovement is what drives our existence. We are constantly on the move, strolling or scurrying from one place to the next. And our clothes follow us, they swirl around our bodies, crease, flutter in the breeze and reflect the way we move.\n\nEsther and Dimitrios Tsatsas, the team of designers behind TSATSAS, address the subject of movement in the design for their clutch bag TAPE which premiered at the Paris Fashion Week in March 2017.\n\nWhat is striking about TAPE is the contrast between the actual bag’s severe geometric lines and the soft tapes that flow from it. Imaginatively knotted, these long leather tapes take on a life of their own – they break up the bag’s elegant clarity with their flexibility and their movement, allowing its users to grip it like a classic clutch bag or to hold it by its tapes in a more relaxed fashion.\n\nThe Video is a result of a collaboration between musician Chinaski, photographer Gerhardt Kellermann and designer Ana Relvão. The video plays with TAPE’s idiosyncrasies, perfecting the interaction between sound and movement. Relvão and Kellermann, who are based in Munich, artistically contrast the sometimes sinuous and sometimes haphazard movements of the leather tapes in individual slow-motion sequences. And in musician and video artist Chinaski they have found a partner who has succeeded in lending the video a dramatic quality with its own specially composed music.\n\nMusician and video artist Chinaski lives in Frankfurt am Main. He made his name with records and EPs on labels such as Live At Robert Johnson and Common Thread and with repeated live appearances at clubs such as the Robert Johnson and the Berghain. His music reflects his affinity with the warm synthesizer sounds of the 1980s.\n\nPortuguese product designer Ana Relvão has been collaborating with Gerhardt Kellermann, a graduate in Industrial Design and photographer, in Munich since 2012. At their interdisciplinary studio they put together photography and industrial design projects for customers such as Bulthaup, Seymoure and Huawei.\n\n“But if you could just see the beauty,\n\nThese things I could never describe.”\n\nJoy Division. “Isolation.” Closer. 1980.\n\nShowing the ephemeral, the transient nature of a moment was the starting point for the project CLOSER, in which Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas, the designer duo behind TSATSAS, explored the topic of proximity.\n\nBased on photographs of the collection taken in Paris in early 2017 by Dimitrios Tsatsas, CLOSER plays with the elision of distance. Digitally-enlarged images are photographed again, appearing as on the screen with their fragmented structures and their typical digital coloring. By zooming in the image is decomposed into its visual components – a process of decoding at the visual level.\n\nAs a result, the actual subject fades into the background. It becomes the canvas of a transient moment, which our eyes would not otherwise perceive. And thus a small detail suddenly becomes omnipresent and the special essence of its beauty is captured. This is no longer about a product or a volume, CLOSER directs our gaze to the seam fashioned by hand, the open pores of the leather, the shine of blood-red nail polish. Things that we seldom perceive, when we take in the object as a whole.\n\nWith the project CLOSER Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas would like to draw our attention to details, something they have been doing for years with their designs. Nothing is left to chance in their bags and accessories: be it the specially designed pulls on zips; the delicate, connecting brass tubes of the core leather straps; or even the single seam along a handle, which the two discuss and examine together.\n\nCLOSER seeks to encourage us to look more closely. And to capture the beauty of a transient moment before it disappears never to return again.\n\nKnown for its handmade bags and accessories of high-quality leather, TSATSAS expanded its repertoire of materials and entering into an extraordinary union with textiles. The project SO_FAR presented five limited versions of the tote bag FLUKE, each in a combination of calfskin and fabrics from the Raf Simons collection of Danish textile company Kvadrat.\n\nSO_FAR represented a new approach in the development of TSATSAS. While the label’s work focused on natural leather and a modern interpretation of traditional crafted leather, translated into contemporary designs, in their work with textiles designer Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas treaded new paths.\n\nWhen in 2014 Kvadrat launched its first fabric collection with Raf Simons, the designer duo was thrilled with the patterns, colours and quality. “When we got the chance as the first bag label worldwide to work exclusively with the fabrics of the Kvadrat/Raf Simons collection, our focus was on transferring the contrast between textiles and leather into a new aesthetic,” they explained.\n\nThe project SO_FAR was a separate edition intended to complement the existing TSATSAS collection, which was limited in terms of numbers. Starting from January 2017, five versions of the iconic FLUKE bag were available at selected international stores in an edition of 50 each.\n\nwww.kvadratrafsimons.com\n\nFLUKE\n\nSO_FAR EDITION 01\n\nFIVE VERSIONS OF THE FLUKE BAG IN\n\nA LIMITED EDITION OF 50 EACH\n\nFABRICS BY RAF SIMONS FOR KVADRAT\n\nIN COMBINATION WITH NATURAL CALFSKIN LEATHER\n\nHANDCRAFTED IN GERMANY\n\nEACH BAG INDIVIDUALISED BY SERIAL NUMBER AND\n\nITS EDITION NUMBER\n\nWHERE DO THINGS END AND WHERE DO THEY BEGIN? CAN AN OBJECT HAVE TWO BEGINNINGS, TWO ENDS? ARE THERE BOUNDARIES WITHIN ONE ENTIRETY?\n\nBag and accessory label TSATSAS addressed the above mentioned theme in its installation WHERE I END AND YOU BEGIN. Shown for the first time during Berliner Mode Salon 2016, the installation was also on display at the TSATSAS atelier in Frankfurt/Main in January 2017.\n\nIn every single one of their designs Esther and Dimitrios Tsatsas explore an object’s boundaries. Their bags and accessories, produced using precise patterns, are made up of countless individual pieces which are assembled using in a complex production process to create a coherent piece.\n\nWith WHERE I END AND YOU BEGIN, the colour of the leather becomes a medium for highlighting the transitions within the bags and accessories. Because, to date, all TSATSAS leather designs have been monochrome, this has hidden the fact that the products are made up of different sections.\n\nHowever, using different colours for the various elements highlights that diversity, rendering the boundaries suddenly visible. Such boundaries are either called for by the design, as with the LUCID tote bag, where different shades of leather come together in the front and back, or are set by the designers on the basis of aesthetic considerations, as with the HAZE clutch bag.\n\nTSATSAS had the pleasure to be part of the first edition of 10 by Yatzer. The project of the global online destination for fine and applied arts Yatzer.com was launched on the occasion of Milan Design Week 2016 at Spazio Pontaccio, in the heart of Milans renowned art disctrict of Brera. 10 by Yatzer presented a collection of exceptional products which were sold through a pop-up shop.\n\nEach of the 10 limited edition pieces created for this year’s collection were a unique collaboration with contemporary international designers and brands. The customizations of either existing or brand new products stood on the subject of “black/white/gold” and were available in a limited amount.\n\nThe participation of TSATSAS occured with a special edition of 20 pieces of the OTHER ONE pouch bag which has first been introduced as part of the TSATSAS collection at Paris Fashion Week in October 2014.\n\nThe special version of the fully reversible OTHER ONE unisex bag was customised for 10 by Yatzer in black calfskin and white lamb nappa leather with gold-toned hardware. Each item was debossed with its individual production number as well as its limited edition numbering for 10 by Yatzer.\n\nwww.yatzer.com\n\nAs part of the “Wallpaper* Handmade“ exhibition 2013, TSATSAS presented the trolley suitcase KAGE designed specially for the project. The exhibition was shown at the Gallery Leclettico in Milan on the occasion of Salone Internazionale del Mobile.\n\nKAGE (Japanese for “shadow”) is a symbiosis of luxury and function, of refined materials and practical use. Elegant travel in the late 19th century involved chests made fully of leather bearing the most intricate of brass fittings – KAGE brings this feel into the present in the form of a trolley suitcase that meets all today’s travel requirements while combining premium quality and high-grade materials.\n\nThe entire interior of the case is lined with the finest of pacific blue lamb nappa leather while the exterior boasts cowhide from Lombardy, Italy. All KAGE’s fittings are handmade from brass; likewise the entire leather case was crafted in Germany by hand in keeping with the long-standing crafts tradition.\n\nKAGE complies with all the customary regulations on hand luggage.\n\nIn 2010, Wallpaper* magazine developed an ambitious, never-been-seen-before project based on the idea and notion that more and more people in today’s modern society were demanding a unique way to stand out from the crowd.\n\nThrough the essence of customisation, Wallpaper* initiated the Handmade project, bringing together the best of the global artisinal world, injecting a healthy dose of contemporary thinking to realise some unique one-off objects.\n\nWallpaper* has since commissioned some of the world’s finest craftsmen, designers, producers and manufacturers to create over 300 one-off pieces and products.\n\nwww.wallpaper.com"
