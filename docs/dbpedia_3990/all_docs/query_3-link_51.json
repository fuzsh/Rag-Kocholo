        "text": "Apprentices with heart and commitment\n\nThe first KIESELMANN social internship took place from 18 to 22 March. Our budding industrial mechanics in their first year of training visited a social organisation to gain valuable experience in social skills and commitment.\n\nLinus and Jan-Luca worked at the Lebenshilfe organisation in Gölshausen in the area of support and care. They accompanied people with various disabilities through their everyday lives and took part in joint activities.\n\nThese included having breakfast together, playing games, stringing chains and going for walks.\n\nAt the end of the special internship, KIESELMANN donated €400 to the Lebenshilfe Gölshausen support and care centre on behalf of the trainees.\n\nDrinkTank - Drinks 4.0\n\nLast week, we visited KASPAR SCHULZ Brauereimaschinenfabrik & Apparatebauanstalt GmbH as part of the \"DrinkTank - Drinks 4.0\" working group.\n\nThis working group brings together companies and research institutes in our industry to work together on a digital and sustainable future for the beverage industry. The DrinkTank pools knowledge and expertise to identify deficits in the process chain, develop the latest digitalisation measures and AI approaches and test them in practice at Kaspar Schulz's own 10 HL pilot brewery.\n\nDuring the meeting in Bamberg, the company representatives not only received exciting presentations on the topic of AI and digitalisation, but also a presentation of the future pilot brewing plant as well as a tour of our plant and a brewery tour at Hellerbräu Bamberg.\n\nWe are already looking forward to the next meeting in September at Micro Matic.\n\nBrauBeviale\n\nWe look forward to seeing you at our exhibition booth at BrauBeviale in Nuremberg.\n\nCertificate of honour for final exam\n\nAnton Schütz is one of the best trainees of the year 2023 of the IHK Northern Black Forest. He passed the final examination for industrial mechanic with the overall result \"very good\" (95 out of 100 points). This outstanding performance was recognised by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce and honoured with a further training voucher.\n\nOn Thursday, 19.10.2023, the IHK North Black Forest honoured all graduates with a graduates with a very good examination result were honoured result at the Kurhaus Bad Liebenzell.\n\nLast week, we congratulated Anton here at the company and presented him with a KIESELMANN gift. Anton will continue to support us in continue to support us in final assembly.\n\nWe are very proud and look forward to continuing to shape the future of KIESELMANN together.\n\nBrauBeviale 2023\n\nThe KIESELMANN Fluid Process Group will present comprehensive 360-degree solutions for the brewing and beverage industry at BrauBeviale 2023 in Hall 9 / Booth 349. The offering ranges from individual components to customized systems.\n\nThis year, the group companies will exhibiting again an impressive range of innovative products and services.\n\nKIESELMANN GmbH presents its new aseptic control valve series with diaphragm technology. At the heart of this series is a flexible PTFE diaphragm that ensures hermetic sealing of housing and stem while creating a dead space-free cavity. Also on display will be the aseptic double-seat valves, as well as the single-seat valves.\n\nGuth Ventiltechnik presents besides their double-butterfly and butterfly control valves with Digipos also the balanced changeover valves, as well as high-pressure disk valves VSR-LID.\n\nOther highlights at the booth include the carbonisation unit with advanced carbonisation fitting from KIESELMANN Anlagenbau, cleaning technology from AquaDuna, and a four-meter high yeast, storage and propagation tank from the tank manufacturers GROSS and RIEGER.\n\nAs in previous years, you are invited to visit the KIESELMANN exhibition workshop. The assembly experts for valve and fluid technology will demonstrate live assemblies throughout the trade fair and also offer on-site training.\n\nFrom now on: Every year again!\n\nOn 16.12.2022, KIESELMANN Managing Director Caroline Pötzl awoke one of the company's favourite traditions from its \"Sleeping Beauty slumber\". After two winters of hibernation, the employees met again for the big festive end-of-year party in the Weissachtalhalle in Freudenstein, Germany.\n\nThe remake of a classic. This new beginning with proven virtues was underlined by the welcome from KIESELMANN Fluid Process Group Managing Director Klaus Dohle. A brief warm hello, then he handed the microphone to Caroline Pötzl. A clear gesture of a turning point in the company's management. KIESELMANN Anlagenbau also has a new managing director since 2022, Dirk Vogler. His predecessor, Georg Zitsch, sat at the shareholders' table that evening with regular shareholders Renate Dohle and Karin Helms-Kieselmann. At KIESELMANN Pharmatec GmbH, Michael Schletz joined René Schuler on the management board this year. Regular shareholder Rosemarie Zitsch had to cancel due to illness. Caroline Pötzl sent her heartfelt wishes for a speedy recovery.\n\nThe little eulogy that the managing director gave to each individual celebrant was also heartfelt. The focus was not on the employee and his or her performance, but on the person who performs these services. Thunderous applause accompanied the honours for the 10-year, 25-year and 40-year anniversaries. Christian Rastätter (plant production), Demetrius Scharf (turning shop), Uwe Heisswolf (development), Mathias Schweinfurth (controlling), Olaf Kiefer (EDP), Marius Büttel (CNC turning shop), Tobias Leins (plant production), Robin Seiler (plant production), Pierre Schuster (plant production), René Schuler (Pharmatec) have been with the company for a decade. Daniel Schiffel (Maintenance), Georg Zitsch (Plant Manufacturing), Timo Lorenz (Purchasing), Achim Moll (Final Assembly), Karsten Reichenbach (CNC Milling), Eugen Arnold (CNC Turning), Thorsten Haack (CNC Turning) and Edgar Kratzmeier (Final Assembly) were honoured for a quarter of a century at KIESELMANN. Susanne Füllbeck (Sales) has been with the company for 40 years. Gerhard Münchinger (CNC turning shop) retired after 21 years, Norbert Kellner (final assembly) after 32 years, Josef Beisel (welding shop) after 35 years, Joachim Burkhardt (welding shop) after 43 years and Petra Schmidt-Blumhofer (accounting) after an impressive 48 years.\n\nThe joyful view of all the successful years together could not cloud the past, challenging year. \"One crisis follows the other and the mood of crisis is developing into a permanent state. We would much rather have stability and predictable future prospects.\" In 2022, the KIESELMANN team has resisted all inhospitable conditions and achieved a successful turnover result. The list of successes includes major national and international projects, which confirm that people around the world \"still value quality from Knittlingen\". Looking at the economic forecasts for 2023, Caroline Pötzl said: \"We know from past crises that unity is our strength. With the stability and heart of a family business and with a passion for quality: the quality of our products, the quality in our dealings with each other and the quality of a great Christmas party. I wish you a wonderful evening and from the bottom of my heart a wonderful Christmas season\".\n\nThe wish of a wonderful evening was also promptly fulfilled. Beautiful was a varied festive buffet by canteen chef Wolfgang Wittig. The best-of-2022 video presentation by apprentice Jacqueline Berktold and the apprentice performance - a humorous melange of theatre, cabaret and ballet - were beautiful. It was great to celebrate together again, dance to the music of the DJ and toast together to a successful KIESELMANN year. It was great, see you next year.\n\nWe wish you happy holidays and a good start into the new year.\n\nControl valves optimally designed: Make it easy...\n\n... with our technical questionnaire.\n\nKIESELMANN control valves are based on the modular system of single-seat valves. A major advantage of our control valves is that they can realise different flow coefficients as well as control characteristics and seal types within one nominal size.\n\nIn order to optimally design KIESELMANN control valves for your process conditions, we have developed a technical questionnaire which you can easily access via this page \"please click here\" and complete online.\n\nYour custom-fit control valve is then calculated from your specifications. Without obligation, immediate and accurate. Try it out right away: Technical questionnaire for control valves.\n\nFinally it's that time again, a trainee reports\n\nOn Friday, 14.10.2022, it was finally time again. After a two-year forced break due to the pandemic, our trainee day took place.\n\nA total of 41 trainees from Rieger Behälterbau and KIESELMANN met here in Knittlingen. It started at 8:00 a.m. in the canteen with a warm welcome from our Managing Director, Mrs. Pötzl, and the Human Resources Manager, Mrs. Lotspeich. The trainee day started with a short, interesting presentation by Mrs Pötzl about the KIESELMANN group of companies, the Fluid Process Group.\n\nWhat is people skills and how can they be trained? These questions were answered by Ms Oberhardt in her lecture \"People skills at first go\". With the successful trainer from Güglingen, we did exciting tests and exercises on the topic of people skills and emotional intelligence, individually and in teams.\n\nShortly before 12 o'clock we met in front of the KIESELMANN administration building. Equipped with a delicious packed lunch, we boarded the waiting bus and headed off to the Palatinate. To be more precise, to Offenbach an der Queich. There, the company Guth Ventiltechnik had invited us to a factory tour. Guth Ventiltechnik is part of the Fluid Process Group and has moved into its brand new office and production building this year.\n\nAfter the factory tour, we scurried back into the bus to arrive on time at our next stop: the Hoepfner private brewery in Karlsruhe.\n\nThe brewery is an impressive building that looks like a medieval castle. Brewers and apprentices from Hoepfner led us through the production rooms and explained the steps of brewing beer. On our way through the brewery we also discovered KIESELMANN valves. After the tour, we stopped at the Burghof, the restaurant of the private brewery. There we had a delicious \"Maultaschen\" buffet and Hopefner drinks. The successful conclusion of an interesting, informative and beautiful day.\n\nWhen we got back on the bus in the early evening to start the journey home to Knittlingen, we all agreed: it was good that the trainee day could take place again. We are already looking forward to the \"Azubitag 2023\".\n\nGet to know our international partners\n\nToday, 26 September, is the \"European Day of Languages\". A fitting occasion for some of our international partners to introduce themselves to you in their national language. Together with our partners, we keep our promise internationally: KIESELMANN always close to you with high-quality valve technology, technical advice and on-site service.\n\nPlease click here for the YouTube video presentations of our partners.\n\nDrinktec 2022\n\nWe are looking forward to your visit at our booth at drinktec 2022. The KIESELMANN Fluid Process Group welcomes you in hall A3 at booth 103.\n\nFrom September 12 to 16, we will present new products and services. For the first time at the trade fair and in front of a professional audience, the new KIESELMANN aseptic valve series, consisting of control, single-seat, double-seat, and takt outlet valves.\n\nOnce again, tips & tricks from the KIESELMANN trade fair workshop. Our experts will demonstrate the professional assembly, disassembly and maintenance of control and double-seat valves directly at the exhibition workbench.\n\nWe are looking forward to your visit.\n\nKIESELMANN International Partners Video\n\nKIESELMANN Partners Worldwide. Do you already know our foreign representatives and branches? KIESELMANN is on site for you worldwide. We are proud of our international partners and are very pleased to introduce some of them here. Allow me: Video.\n\nWould you like to meet us and our international partners in person? We look forward to seeing you at our stand at Drinktec 2022, Hall A3, Stand 103.\n\nThe good old days - 5th KIESELMANN pensioners' meeting\n\nOn Friday, 22.07.2022, we invited former employees to the fifth pensioners' meeting. At 11:30 a.m., Managing Director Caroline Pötzl and Managing Director Klaus Dohle welcomed the guests.\n\nFormer employees who had only recently said goodbye to the company were present, as were those who had already been retired for decades. Among the 32 guests of honour were KIESELMANN shareholders Rosemarie Zitsch and Renate Dohle. \"I am delighted to see so many of them again. And I am looking forward to showing them today how KIESELMANN has developed in the meantime. The fact that they have all come is a sign of their attachment to the KIESELMANN family,\" said Caroline Pötzl.\n\nShe then accompanied the pensioners to the company restaurant. There, canteen manager Wolfgang Wittig entertained the guests with refined and hearty dishes from his kitchen. After lunch, Bernd Wenzdorfer (head of plant production) and André Becker (production manager) took the pensioners on a tour of production. Past the old workplace and many companions, they returned to the canteen. There, Caroline Pötzl reviewed the past years and outlined the future in a short, entertaining presentation.\n\nAfter the thirst for knowledge was quenched, there were treats from the KIESELMANN bakery. Stories from the good old days were served with coffee and cake. And as the afternoon drew to a close in a family atmosphere, promises were made: \"We'll see each other again at next year's pensioners' meeting. Then we will tell each other about the good old days and about today.\n\nInternational Training Days 2022\n\nWe look back on the \"International Training Days\" 2022. Colleagues and sales partners travelled from 16 countries to learn about new KIESELMANN products here at our headquarters in Knittlingen.\n\nWe look back on an instructive, focused and cheerful week of international exchange.\n\nWe look forward to a successful partnership in the future.\n\nAnuga FoodTec 2022 Highlights\n\nInteresting first contacts and familiar faces made for four varied days at Anuga FoodTec in Cologne. We thank you for your visit and look forward to further discussions and projects. For all those who did not have the opportunity to drop by, we would like to briefly present the two trade show highlights from our double-seat valve family:\n\n1. The piggable double-seat valve. Detailed information on the combination of our valve king class with pigging technology can be found on the KIESELMANN Insights page \"Pigging technology\". (please click).\n\n2. New actuators for KIESELMANN double-seat valves. The new actuators for KIESELMANN double-seat valves are more compact and up to 2 kg lighter, which facilitates handling during maintenance. Furthermore, operating costs can be saved, as the reduced consumption of the new actuators promises significant savings for larger productions: up to 45% control air can be saved depending on the nominal size and cycle operation.\n\nDo you have any questions about the piggable double-seat valve? Or about the smaller actuators for double-seat valves? Or would you like to know what other highlights were on display at our booth? Then send an e-mail to salesno__pam@kieselmann.de or call us directly at +4970 43 371-0.\n\nAnuga Foodtec 2022\n\nAt the leading global trade fair Anuga FoodTec in Cologne, we will be presenting highlights for the food and beverage industry from 26 to 29 April.\n\nOne of these trade fair highlights is the piggable double-seat valve. Find out in a technical discussion the potentially extraordinary savings that pigging systems using piggable double-seat valves have in store for you.\n\nYou are welcome to make an appointment for your personal meeting in advance: +49 7043 371 138\n\nWe are looking forward to your visit at the KIESELMANN FLUID PROCESS GROUP booth C-029 in hall 4.1.\n\nWe start the new year big...\n\nFor the Scottish Edrington Group, we have manufactured and delivered the largest valve manifold in our company's history to date.\n\nThe XXL-valve manifold was assembled from 25 individual manifolds and measures 4.90 metres x 7.90 metres.\n\nEdrington trusts the KIESELMANN manufacturing and service quality and our man on the island, Colin Jeffrey from KIESELMANN UK.\n\nColin Jeffrey has already agreed on two more valve clusters with the Scottish whisky group.\n\nThe XXL valve manifold in numbers:\n\n359 double-seat valves with k-flex seals\n\n36 butterfly valves with pneum. Actuator\n\n407 control heads\n\n18 Inline housings in 3″\n\n25 single nodes Translated\n\nVideo about the XXL-Valve-Manifold: please click here\n\n21 Chapters in our success story\n\nOn 26 November 2021, KIESELMANN honoured 21 employees for their loyalty: a total of 285 years of service. For us as a family business, this is a reason for pride and joy. And a sign of employee satisfaction. We know that appreciation, satisfaction and commitment are values with which you write success stories.\n\nThe employees Edin Mehmedovic (film packaging), Manuel Stumpf (logistics), Thomas Link (logistics), Wolfgang Häge (welding shop), Jörg Schmidt (plant engineering), Leo Brunetti (sheet metal shop), Samir Mehmedovic (welding shop), Achim Ernst (sawmill), Timo Höfle (CNC turning shop) were honoured, Klaus Wiederspohn (CNC turning shop), Silvio Brunetti (quality assurance), Lucas Eisenmann (sales), Daniel Hidalgo (surface finishing), Marco Vincon (marketing), Michael Huber (final assembly) and Fabian Mehl (CNC turning shop), for their 10 years of service to the company. The company is also particularly proud of Dora Rittner (Final Assembly), Jürgen Leypoldt (Work Preparation), Stefan Kohm (Plant Manufacturing), Thomas Blechner (Development) and Jürgen Raichle (Plant Engineering). They have been loyal to KIESELMANN for 25 years. In addition to the IHK certificate of honour, the jubilarians received a \"basket full of Spanish delicacies\".\n\nKlaus Dohle and Caroline Pötzl (management) as well as Karsten Reichenbach (works council) and Lena Lotspeich (human resources management) congratulated the jubilarians at a distance, but warmly. The words addressed to the 21 guests of honour testified to the fact that recognition does not require a handshake. \"Long-serving employees provide stability, embody the corporate culture and make a special contribution to the success story of our family business with their wealth of experience. They are the family we enjoy working with every day,\" said Managing Director Caroline Pötzl.\n\nOnce around the globe and even further ...\n\nOnce around the globe and even further is the distance that 68 KIESELMANN ACTIVE participants have jogged, cycled and swum together: 44,879 kilometres.\n\nFrom 28.06. to 26.09. eight teams competed against each other. And the winner is: Wadentest Foundation. Second place in the overall standings went to Team Anlagenbau, just ahead of Wenzdorfers Rasselbande in third place. Julius Heim and Miriam Dorwarth were also members of the Winner Team and came in first and second in the participant rankings. They were closely followed by Sven Nelson from the Men's Health team. Congratulations!\n\nTo make the great achievements of the participants tangible with a number: Julius Heim covered 3,225 km on his racing bike and on foot during the 13 weeks of the Challenge. Besides the top finishers, there was another winner: the Team Spirit. Many team members met to cycle, jog and swim together.\n\nSo neither the sporting ambition nor the togetherness fell by the wayside. And in addition to the leg muscles, the laughing muscles were also exercised in many places. No matter how you look at it, one thing is certain: \"KIESELMANN, we rocked the Challenge!\"\n\n... Offering support\n\nWe are also happy to keep our promise to donate to the Familienherberge Lebensweg in Illingen-Schützingen when the distance reaches 40,000 kilometres. With the words \"Offer support. Give freedom.\" the family hostel describes itself as a loving and needs-based retreat for all families with seriously ill children.\n\nKIESELMANN UK: Here's to the next 10 years\n\nThe relationship between Great Britain and mainland Europe has been better before. The fact that this is different at the KIESELMANN company is mainly due to one man: Colin Jeffrey. Our man on the island ensures good business even in challenging times. Now he is celebrating his 10th anniversary.\n\nSince 11 September 2011, Colin Jeffrey has been in the service of Her Majesty... in the service of KIESELMANN. Previously, he worked as Project Manager for CAL Systems at InBev. In this role, he got to know Ian Scott, the then Head of KIESELMANN UK. Numerous meetings, such as in 2007 for a 600 double-seat InBev project in Magor, formed a friendship. And it wasn't just the interpersonal fit, the working methods also complemented each other. The logical step followed in 2011, when Colin Jeffrey joined KIESELMANN UK as Sales Engineer.\n\nShortly afterwards, Ian Scott passed away after a short, serious illness. A painful loss that left a big gap. A gap that only one person could fill, the \"new man\".\n\nFrom the headquarters in Germany came the clear signal that the management of the UK office was in good hands with Colin Jeffrey. KIESELMANN Managing Director Klaus Dohle expressed his full confidence in him. And this trust has paid off. Today, KIESELMANN is a \"household name\" in the UK, especially in the whisky sector.\n\nOr in the words of Colin Jeffrey: \"Business has been steady and in particular the whisky industry has grown year on year for us. In October 2014 Paul joined us and has been invaluable in keeping the office going while I go out and about around the country.\" Colin Jeffrey and his colleague Paul Wainwright have been leading KIESELMANN UK to new successes for years.\n\nProjects such as the new Tullamore Dew Distillery in Ireland, the new Macallan Distillery and Filling Store in Scotland and the fully automated expansion at Aspall Cider in Suffolk are testament to this. As does the continuing collaboration with AB InBev, the largest brewing group in the world. Congratulations on a successful decade & here's to the next 10 years, Colin.\n\nCFIA 2021\n\nVisit the KIESELMANN France team from 09.06.2021 to 11.06.2021 in hall 8 at booth B35 at CFIA 2021 in Rennes, France.\n\nKIESELMANN France is looking forward to an exciting exchange on the topics of valve technology and process control, in compliance with all Corona rules.\n\nStainless steel tubes quickly available\n\nThe KIESELMANN promise\n\nDespite the difficult market situation, we keep our promise to provide you with stainless steel tubes of the highest quality at short notice.\n\nThe Plus\n\nOur special service for your next project: the KIESELMANN swap body. A stocked, mobile warehouse at your site on commission - during the entire construction phase.\n\nWe will be happy to advise you personally under the telephone number +49 (0)7043 371-0\n\nFor more information about our delivery offer, please refer to our new brochure: please click here.\n\n4th generation at KIESELMANN\n\nThe year begins with a welcome change.\n\nCaroline Pötzl, née Dohle, has been promoted to the Kieselmann management.\n\nAmong the first well-wishers were three women who helped pave this way, Karin Helms-Kieselmann, Rosemarie Zitsch and Renate Dohle. The shareholders have appointed Caroline Pötzl as Managing Director of Kieselmann GmbH with effect from 1 January 2021.\n\nTogether with Klaus Dohle, the 33-year-old business economist now forms the dual leadership of the fluid technology company. \"I am pleased that entrepreneurial spirit and passion for quality can be inherited,\" says Klaus Dohle with a smile. He is visibly proud that the family business is now entering its fourth generation.\n\nDespite its rapid growth and global orientation, the KIESELMANN company has always remained true to its traditional values and the Knittlingen location. \"Family business is not just a label you can attach to yourself. It is a conviction that you have to live by,\" says Caroline Pötzl.\n\nFor the mother of two, the intergenerational management and the family-friendly workplace design underline this statement. An in-house canteen, kindergarten places for the employees' offspring and an attractive range of leisure activities have made Kieselmann one of the top employers in the region. Caroline Pötzl is determined to continue this success story.\n\n165 years KIESELMANN\n\nOn Thursday, 03 December, the Kieselmann company honoured its jubilarians 2020.\n\nIn accordance with the applicable regulations, Klaus Dohle (Management), Karl-Heinz Hamschmidt (Works Council) and Lena Lotspeich (Human Resources) congratulated the nine employees with a temporal and spatial offset.\n\nAs the first celebrant, Friederike Körner (Quality Assurance) received a gift basket with tapas from Spain, a bouquet of flowers and the IHK certificate of honour for 25 years at Kieselmann.\n\nAfterwards, the \"10-year-olds\", Lisa Böhler (Purchasing), Christian Opatz (CNC Milling) David Sailer (Plant Manufacturing), Axel Vollmer (Sales), Michael Stößer (CNC Turning) and Alexander Barho (AV / Construction) were happy about their honour and a \"basket full of Spanish delicacies\".\n\nAhmet Ekiz (CNC turning shop) and Jose Guzman-Aguilar (grinding shop) also received numerous words of thanks and a full gift basket for 40 years of service at Kieselmann.\n\nIn total, the jubilarians had 165 years of service with the company.\n\n\"It makes us proud that the employees feel comfortable with us and show this through their commitment and loyalty to the company.\n\nTwo in the team who have supported us for almost half a century and four who have already completed their training with us and are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year, that is simply a great record,\" says Klaus Dohle.\n\nAnd he adds: \"In a year in which many things are different, one thing must not fall by the wayside - appreciation.\"\n\nKeeping distance and promises\n\nEven in the Corona crisis, we are maintaining our high training ratio. In 2020, KIESELMANN will enable ten young people to start their professional life.\n\nIn the commercial sector, two industrial clerk trainees and a specialist for warehouse logistics have started. No fewer than four prospective cutting machine operators, two industrial mechanics and a technical product designer are undergoing training in the industrial-technical field.\n\nBut simply carrying on as before is not possible in 2020. We had to adapt our \"sponsor concept\". This year again, apprentices in the higher years of their apprenticeship will take over an \"apprentice sponsorship\" and will support the new ones with advice and assistance. Now in compliance with the distance rules.\n\n\"The past months have shown us that cohesion is also possible with minimum distance. Our promise is: We offer you the apprenticeship place that suits you and is fun. We are keeping this promise in this special year as well,\" says Lena Lotspeich, Kieselmann Human Resources Manager. The fact that they keep their word in Knittlingen was evident from the very first day. At the introductory event, good-humoured \"newcomers\" met committed \"godparents\" who answered all questions and gave tips.\n\nA successful start to a training course that is fun.\n\n40 years KIESELMANN\n\nOn 1 September 1980 Mr. Guzman-Aguilar had his first working day in the KIESELMANN grinding shop. Soon after, he took over the position of foreman in the department. And that is what he still is today, a master craftsman with joy and commitment.\n\nJosé Guzman-Aguilar's reliable and conscientious way of working is as well known in the company as his culinary art. The paellas with which he has already conjured up culinary delights at numerous company parties are legendary.\n\nMr. Guzman-Aguilar deliberately refrains from celebrating an anniversary. Instead of a celebration in his honour, he has requested a vesper for each employee. A double thank you from the KIESELMANN team for the good cooperation and this nice gesture.\n\nThe management would like to thank Mr. Guzman-Aguilar for 40 years of commitment and wishes him all the best, much success and joy in his work!\n\nStrong partner for difficult times\n\nDear customers and partners of KIESELMANN,\n\n\"Strong for you\" has been a motto of our company for many years. A motto that is more than ever valid these days. We remain strong for you.\n\nPart of this strength is that we do our utmost to be there for you without restrictions. We have changed many things and have done everything to protect our employees in the best possible way. Even if the virus should find a way to us despite all precautions, we are prepared. A closure of entire departments or even the entire company is largely impossible.\n\nYou can be assured that we will continue to do our best to supply you with the products from our company. Your personal contact person can be reached as usual by phone and e-mail. For the protection of our and your employees all on-site services are currently suspended.\n\nOur production department works in two shifts to produce for you in compliance with the necessary safety precautions. Since its foundation, the KIESELMANN company has stood for \"Made in Germany\". In times of the Corona crisis, this is another strength you can rely on.\n\nThank you very much for placing your trust in us even in these difficult times. We remain strong for you.\n\nI also wish all those who are directly affected by the COVID-19 disease much strength and power.\n\nKlaus Dohle, General Manager KIESELMANN\n\n10 years KIESELMANN Russia\n\nПОЗДРАВЛЕНИЯ. Congratulations KIESELMANN Russia. Our Russian subsidiary celebrated its 10th anniversary on 21 February. On this occasion, Managing Director Sergey Baranov and his team invited customers and companions to an atmospheric evening. The celebration took place in the premises of the Crocus Expo Center in Moscow.\n\nThe past ten years were celebrated in the spirit of the KIESELMANN slogans \"Strong for you\" and \"Passion for quality\". Many customers have accompanied Mr. Baranov and his team since the very beginning. Especially in the Russian and transnational dairy sector, the company is the \"first choice supplier\" for many. Culinary delicacies, a \"birthday cake\" and live music provided the right festive atmosphere.\n\nThe celebration flanked this year's DairyTech exhibition, a mandatory event for the dairy and meat industry. KIESELMANN GmbH sales manager Dieter Biszwurm was also at the anniversary celebration and the trade fair. He praised the success and good cooperation between KIESELMANN Russia and the German colleagues.\n\n3rd place at the XVII Brauer-Ski Cup\n\nFrom 24 to 26 January it was once again: Beer and skis, we love it! For the 17th time, the piste forwards of the brewers' guild met to compete in the giant slalom. The KIESELMANN \"Ski Quartet\" also started at this year's Brauer Ski Cup in Rettenberg.\n\nOn your mark, get set, and go for the podium. Pascal Bühler, Axel Vollmer, Dan Mayer and Klaus Dohle showed themselves in top form and chased single-mindedly to the podium. Wearing KIESELMANN ski suits, they mastered the giant slalom and secured 3rd place in the sponsors' team classification.\n\nOn Saturday evening our team still competed in the brewers' Olympics. In the \"competition with guaranteed laughter\" they only just missed the podium and placed 4th - a short breath before they went back to the podium. In the combined classification Giant Slalom/Brauer-Olympics it was said once again: \"The 3rd place goes to the team \"KIESELMANN\" from Kieselmann GmbH in Knittlingen.\"\n\nThe résumé of the KIESELMANN starters: Simply great, the Brauer Ski Cup. Also in 2020 everything was right again: From the great organisation to the piste conditions and the great atmosphere in the team. This makes the 18th Brauer-Skip-Cup a welcome \"must\" for 2021.\n\nNew chapters in a success story\n\nOn 13 December 2019 a new chapter has begun. For 28 years, the Kieselmann company celebrated its end of the year in the Knittlinger Stadthalle. This is now over. Not with the Christmas party. But with the venue. The space is no longer sufficient.\n\nThis year the first celebration was held in the Weissachtalhalle in Freudenstein. The guest list included 380 employees. That is 220 more than at the first celebration in the Knittlingen Stadthalle in 1991. Managing director Klaus Dohle mentioned this healthy growth in his welcoming speech.\n\nHe congratulated the employees on another successful business year. Major brewery projects in Germany and Switzerland and an XXL order for almost 2000 ball valves and 50 pigging systems for a customer in the cosmetics industry testify to the company's reputation in the industry. It is thanks to this reputation and the continued commitment of the workforce that the company was able to hold its own very well in a weakening market.\n\nIn challenging times, such as the unscheduled disruption of the high-bay warehouse, the KIESELMänner and KIESELFrauen had shown what they were made of. And the effort was worth it. The expansion of the picking and packing workstations has resulted in a 30% increase in capacity. An increase in performance that also appeals to the customers: as faster delivery.\n\nIn addition to the high-bay warehouse, the company has expanded its machinery. In 2019, the original shareholders, Renate Dohle, Karin Helms-Kieselmann and Rosemarie Zitsch, released an investment sum of 5 million euros. Addressing the three Grand Dames of the company, Klaus Dohle thanked them for their extraordinary support.\n\nThe company intends to maintain its moderate growth course for 2020. An important innovation, which stands for the future-oriented view of the company and will be online in 2020, is the Kieselmann Business-to-Business Webshop.\n\nAfter the look into the future followed the look into the past and with it the honours of the jubilees. Thorsten Krieg from the design department and Christine Häusler from the sales department have been accompanying the company for a decade. For a quarter of a century KIESELMANN was honoured Kerstin Grosch (assistant to the management), Dirk Vogler (plant engineering), Yakup Yemenici (CNC turning shop), Holger Kritzer (development), Andreas Rauch (turning and milling shop) and in absence Uwe Braun (sales). Joachim Burkhardt (welding shop), Martin Hruschka (sheet metal shop) and Bernd Wenzdorfer (plant manufacturing) have been loyal to the company for 40 years.\n\nThunderous applause was also heard for Günter Plag. The retired personnel manager had returned last year to support his former department once again. Now the KIESELMANN Urgestein was bid farewell after almost 50 years of service.\n\nAfter the honours Klaus Dohle opened the buffet. Canteen chef Wolfgang Wittig and his team had prepared a varied festive menu. For dessert, there were ice cream variations and a varied entertainment programme for the trainees. The prelude was a humorous review of the year. This was followed by a sketch and a Christmas carol medley. Musically cheerful, the event continued with a party DJ and delicious cocktails. Until further past midnight, people danced, laughed and remembered a beautiful year. A successful start to this new chapter in the Weissachtalhalle.\n\nPhotos from the KIESELMANN celebration 2019 can be viewed on Facebook: please click here\n\nReview BrauBeviale 2019\n\nThree successful and intensive trade fair days lie behind us. From 12th to 14th November the KIESELMANN FLUID PROCESS GROUP with the companies AquaDuna, GROSS Behälterbau, Guth Ventiltechnik, KIESELMANN, KIESELMANN Anlagenbau, KIESELMANN Rus, KIESELMANN UK and RIEGER Behälterbau was at the BrauBeviale in Nuremberg. Our colleagues from India and the USA were at our booth, too.\n\nThroughout the fair, the visitors showed great interest in our exhibits. The KIESELMANN exhibition workshop was also a crowd-puller. Alexander Hauser and Daniel Hidalgo demonstrated live how to fit a blind insert in a valve node, how to change seals and how to change the function of a single-seat valve actuator. For three days, the workshop professionals answered questions and provided practical assistance on all aspects of valve technology and maintenance.\n\nAs the saying goes: a picture says more than a thousand words. We don't know how to calculate the number of words in moving images. But we think the trade fair video is at least as meaningful as a thousand words. See for yourself on Youtube: please click here\n\nYou can have a look at some photos of BrauBeviale on our Facebook page.Please click here.\n\n5th KIESELMANN Bicycle Campaign: Together from Knittlingen to Australia\n\nFrom 15 May to 15 September 2019 the motto was again: get on the saddle, ready, go! 70 employees got on their bikes and took part in the campaign \"With the bike to work\". This is a new record number of participants. For four months they cycled what their calves could: a total of 14,881 kilometres. This als a new record. The number of kilometres corresponds to the distance from Knittlingen to Australia.\n\n\"By bike to work\" is also cycling for a good cause. As part of the campaign, the company is donating 1,000 euros to the \"Familienherberge Lebensweg\". \"The KIESELMANN active program promotes the health and well-being of our employees. It is our duty to protect our own health. Out of respect for those who are not healthy. Our donation to the \"Family Hostel Lebensweg\" is an important contribution to relieve the burden on families with seriously ill children,\" says KIESELMANN Managing Director Klaus Dohle. More information about the work of the family hostel can be found at: www.familienherberge-lebensweg.de\n\nThree lucky cyclists could be happy about a 150 Euro voucher each. All those who live no less than 1 km away from the company and have come to work at least 25 times by bicycle or e-bike within the campaign period came into the lottery pot.\n\nIn the presence of the participants, Klaus Dohle (Managing Director), Gabriele Winkler (Works Council) and Lena Lotspeich (Human Resources), Glücksfee Zoe Deppert (apprentice) reached into the lot three times and pulled: Achim Kauselmann (Development), Andreas Rauch (Turning Shop) and Fabio Paese (CNC Programming). Since there are no losers in this campaign, everyone who has pedalled 25 times received a red KIESELMANN sports shirt.\n\nDates of the KIESELMANN exhibition workshop\n\nWe cordially invite you to visit us at the BrauBeviale 2019, from 12 - 14 November, in the KIESELMANN exhibition workshop. On all three days of the fair we will show you exciting live installations in Hall 9 / 9-349.\n\nHere you will find all information on the individual workshops and the presentation times.\n\nWorkshop1: Manifolds\n\nUpgrading valve manifolds cost-effectively and safely\n\n10:00 - 10:30 AM\n\n4:00 - 4:30 PM\n\nWorkshop 2: Valves\n\nAutomating and maintaining valves\n\n11:00 - 11:30 AM\n\n2:00 - 2:30 PM\n\n5:00 - 5:30 PM\n\nWorkshop 3: KI-DS Valves\n\nChanging functions and seats\n\n12:00 - 12:30 PM\n\n3:00 - 3:30 PM\n\nArt and passion for quality\n\nAnyone entering the foyer of the KIESELMANN company these days will encounter a radiant smile and radiant colours. A painting by the artist Karin Helms-Kieselmann adorns the reception area and gives it additional radiance.\n\nThe daughter of the company founder describes her work of art with the word \"courageous\". Mrs. Helms-Kieselmann leaves the interpretation of the abstract painting to the viewer. Art is something personal. One robs her of her strength if one pretends too much. The colour combination of strong yellow and red tones has something fiery and passionate about it. In keeping with the company's motto: passion for quality. Green tones spread along the upper edge of the picture and blend into the acrylic painting like a haven of peace. One could see in this the company's attachment to the green hills of its region. The traditional, combined with the fiery reds of progress.\n\nMrs. Helms-Kieselmann was active in interior design for a long time. From this experience she chose the painting for KIESELMANN. The bold play of colours and the explosive corners and edges of her painting enliven the reception area.\n\nMrs. Helms-Kieselmann not only has an aesthetic eye for the company. Together with Renate Dohle and Rosemarie Zitsch, she is also involved in the company's economic affairs as a shareholder. And the partners and managing director Klaus Dohle know that this is also an art in itself.\n\nSymbols of sustainability\n\nOn Tuesday, September 10, Kieselmann Managing Director Klaus Dohle presented Daniel Krüger, headmaster of the Edith-Stein Gymnasium Bretten, with 135 stainless steel drinking bottles.\n\nA special welcome gift for the new pupils of the school year 2019. The fifth graders received their drinking bottle on the following first day of school. Peter Maier from the Friends of ESG Bretten was also present at the presentation. The Circle of Friends had brought the school management and the fluid technology company together to set another example of sustainability.\n\n\"We have been using our water dispensers from Stadtwerke since 2017. The drinking bottle enables the new pupils to fill in an environmentally friendly way right from the start. For fewer plastic bottles in the school satchel,\" says Daniel Krüger. According to Deutsche Umwelthilfe, around 10 million tons of plastic waste end up in the world's oceans every year.\n\n\"We must act now to create a future worth living. As a partner and supplier to the food and beverage industry, we know how important clean drinking water is. We are delighted that this campaign is making it easier for young people to gain access and making a small contribution against plastic waste,\" says Klaus Dohle, adding with a smile: \"And we know our way around stainless steel. The Kieselmann company produces valves and plant technology made of stainless steel. Also the drinking bottles of the Knittlinger company are a success. Already on the first day of school many pupils could be seen filling their new, environmentally friendly bottles.\n\nLiving history - 4th KIESELMANN alumni meeting\n\nOn Friday, 19.07.2019, KIESELMANN invited former employees to the fourth KIESELMANN alumni meeting. Managing Director Klaus Dohle welcomed the guests of honour at 10:30 a.m. in the new company restaurant. KIESELMANN shareholders Rosemarie Zitsch and Renate Dohle also followed the invitation. \"It is nice to see you all well again\", said Klaus Dohle.\n\nFormer employees who had only recently left the company were also present, as were those who had been retired since the 1990s. Klaus Dohle opened the day with a presentation on the past year and a brief outlook on the future. The company recently expanded the picking and packing workstations of its high-bay warehouse. At the same time, the complete conveyor technology of the warehouse was renewed. The measures have resulted in a 30% increase in capacity. After the review of the year, KIESELMANN canteen manager Wolfgang Wittig served delicacies from his kitchen. There was roast roast with Spätzle.\n\nAfter lunch, Bruno Falk (logistics manager) and André Becker (production manager) guided the former employees in two groups through the production and presented the extended high-bay warehouse and the new robot technology. The company has recently invested in new machines in the welding shop.\n\nAfter the company tour and a group photo, things got challenging. Klaus Richter (Marketing Manager) turned into a showmaster in the style of the famous german showamster Hans Rosenthal and welcomed the guests to the first KIESELMANN Quiz. Ten questions about bigger and smaller milestones of the company had to be answered.\n\nSo they puzzled, appreciated and typed and in the end one winner was determined: Günter Plag. The former personnel manager had answered almost all questions correctly. A second prize went to Rudi Payer. He only just lost to Günter Plag when asked how many individual parts the KIESELMANN artwork consists of.\n\nWould you like to guess? You can have a look at a small picture of the picture here:KIESELMANN artwork(You will find the answer at the end of this text)\n\nAfter the award ceremony they stayed together for a while with coffee and cake, talked about the numerous impressions of the alumni meeting 2019 and let a nice day end in a family circle.\n\nAnswer: The KIESELMANN artwork consists of four hundred individual parts.\n\nKIESELMANN is on track: Kraichgau CityCup 2019\n\nLast Saturday, July 13th, 20 KIESELMANN runners started at the Sparkasse Kraichgau CityCup in Bretten. 8 KIESELMANN Kids also took part.\n\nAfter a week soaked in rain, there was a central question: \"Will it stay dry?\". Yes, it stayed that way. Also the thermometer did not climb into the red area. Optimal conditions, which ensured a good mood in the KIESELMANN team even before the start. The KIESELMANN Kids started the race. For them it was 16:45 o'clock on the 800-metre distance. At the finish Fynn Bohner (6th place), Julian Philipp Sedello (8th place), Erika Luisa Sedello (7th place) and Leni Rauch (9th place) were happy about top ten placings in their age groups.\n\nAt 17:15 the starting signal was given for the 1600-metre distance of the U16 runners. Maurice Reinmuth sprinted in the red KIESELMAMN Kids Shirt to 3rd place in his age group classification. Elisabeth Julia Sedello (6th place) and Marlon Reinmuth (7th place) also achieved great results in their year.\n\nThen 14 KIESELMANN runners gathered behind the starting line for the 5-kilometre run.

Dirk Vogler from plant engineering achieved the best result. He crossed the finish line after 45:35 minutes and finished 4th in his age group.\n\nWe thank all KIESELMANN runners for the great atmosphere in the team - and congratulate them on the great results.\n\nMore photos of the KIESELMANN Runners can be found on our Facebook page: Please click here\n\nA good team: KIESELMANN and VfB Bretten\n\nOn Wednesday, 10.07.2019, players of the youth teams of VfB Bretten visited KIESELMANN GmbH to inform themselves about the training offer of the Knittlinger company. The coaches and parents of the players were also invited to the evening to get to know each other. Dirk Vogler, project manager of KIESELMANN Anlagenbau and youth trainer of VfB Bretten, brought the sports club and the industrial company together.\n\nWe started at 6:00. KIESELMANN personnel manager Lena Lotspeich welcomed the guests in the company restaurant of the family business and presented the training occupations from A for plant engineer, plant mechanic, I for industrial clerk to Z for machining mechanic. The trainers, Alexander Hauser, Sebastian Marquart, Wolfgang Wilhelm and Klaus Zimmermann, then took the young goal scorers to various workplaces and talked about the relevant training profiles.\n\nTeam spirit and fair play were the main topics at the joint dinner in the company restaurant. Just like on the football pitch, rules for fairness and equal opportunities also apply to training. \"So far, we have offered all our trainees working conditions,\" says Lena Lotspeich. In addition to an attractive training place, the company also offers numerous benefits, such as the company restaurant with daily fresh food, trainee days, numerous sports activities and a company football team.\n\n\"Of course, we don't want to poach any players now, just offer another career opportunity next to the football pitch,\" commented Fabian Gerst, (Human Resources) the event with a wink.\n\nYou can view more photos of the event on our Facebook page: Please click here\n\nKIESELMANN Kickers versus Felss Rotaform: Seven in one sweep\n\nOn Friday, 24 May, the KIESELMANN company football team met the team from Felss Rotaform. The kick-off was at 17:30 on the green of the SV Gölshausen.\n\nIn the beginning the KIESELMANN Kickers had difficulties to find their rhythm. This discrepancy was also punished promptly. In the 5th minute the first goal was scored. The Felss fans cheered, the KIESELMANN 11 woke up.\n\nAfter the wake-up call, the tide turned. The answer to the 1:0 was given by Lucas Eisenmann. After the equalization, our kickers set the pace until the halftime whistle. At the start of the second half, the Felss team could once again place the ball in the goal of Matti Dobler.\n\nTime to gather and prove your will to win. Our team, cheered on by numerous colleagues, determined the game over long distances. This effort was rewarded. Valentin Rigo, Luca Rexer, Julian Frick and Zoltan Nagy joined Lucas Eisenmann on the scoring list. With two goals each Julian and Zoltan also turned once again properly at the result. The final score was 7:2 for KIESELMANN.\n\nA great team effort.\n\nWe would like to thank our kickers and the numerous \"fans\" who pushed the team from the sidelines. A big thank you goes also to the players of the Felss Rotaform company team for the fair, friendly game and to the SV Gölshausen 1947 e. V. for the hospitality and great caterings.\n\nOn the KIESELMANN Facebook page you can view more photos of the friendly match: Please click here\n\nCapacity increase for faster deliveries\n\nThe expansion of picking and packing stations at the KIESELMANN high-bay warehouse has been completed. We also took this opportunity to renew the warehouse’s conveyor technology in full, and these measures will increase capacity by 30%. An improvement in performance that reaches you: with faster deliveries.\n\nAt this point, we would like to apologise for the delivery delays that have occurred in the past few days as a result of unexpected problems with commissioning. We are working hard to get through the backlog. Thanks to the new workstations, faster conveyor technology and optimised control, we are on a very good and direct path. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nWe will make up for this in June. Two additional lines will create space for approx. 1000 new pallets. We will quite literally have more in store for you!\n\nNew Look & Update\n\nOn Friday, March 1, 2019, the colleagues of the field and office staff met with members of the Fluid Process Group here in Knittlingen for the first national sales meeting in 2019. The event was attended by representatives of AquaDuna, VA Food Processing, Rieger Behälterbau, Gross Behälterbau, Ruland, Guth Ventiltechnik and Kieselmann Anlagenbau.\n\nThe meeting also provided the perfect setting for the inauguration of the recently completed \"cafeteria\" of the KIESELMANN training room. The newly designed recreation area was an invitation to a relaxed discussion during the breaks and was immediately well received by the participants. The new design and appearance are pleasing.\n\nNot in a new look, but with updated contents our online product catalogue comes along. The update 02/2019 is now online. Take a look at it now!: bit.ly/KIESELMANN_PC17-0219\n\nEvery year, we get on our skis\n\nKnittlingen, Friday 22 February 2019, local time 5:45 a.m., outside temperature 2 degrees plus. There is no snow to be seen far and wide. But in Paul-Kieselmann-Straße there is a group of men and women with winter sports equipment. A clear sign that the annual KIESELMANN Ski Weekend is imminent.\n\nAt 6:00 a.m. it's off to the asphalt slope in the direction of snow flurries. Almost five hours by bus and a hearty breakfast later the KIESELMANN troop stops in the Austrian Vorarlberger Land. It rains at the Damüls valley station. But the Elsenalpstube mountain inn is located at an altitude of 1850 metres. So with the lift \"aufi\" and let's see what it looks like up there. No rain. But snow and modest visibility. The weather is cloudy, the mood is not. And so it says: On the skis, ready and go on the piste. In the afternoon we meet for après-ski at the bar.\n\nA feel-good factor of 100 in awesome weather\n\nOn Saturday morning Saint Peter is in a good mood and is conjuring up a great weather for the firmament. The KIESELMANN team doesn't last long in the Elsenalpstube. Saturday evening begins with a wine tasting in Gilbert's wine cellar. The extraordinary ambience of the \"wine cave\" carved into a rock, the exquisite wines and the anecdotes of the host of Elsenalp weave an unforgettable evening. There is agreement on that. And in vino veritas.\n\nSunday lives up to its name and shines with the faces of the KIESELMANN piste strikers. And so under a blue sky the snow is whirled up once more. Great atmosphere, skiing fun and great hosts: Damüls, see you in 2020!\n\nYou can view more photos of the KIESELMANN ski weekend on our Facebook page: bit.ly/KKSki2019\n\nFast and furios: KIESELMANN at the Brewer-Ski Cup 2019\n\nThis year, the skiers of the brewing guild once again strapped their skis under their feet to compete in the Brauer-Ski-Cup from January 25th to 27th. In the giant slalom our KIESELMANN \"Ski Quartet\" just missed the third place. But this did not detract from the good atmosphere in the team and in the exchange with the other ski enthusiasts, especially the Schönram brewery. And next year it's off to the podium.\n\nA Highlight at the 20th Knittlinger apprenticeship exchange\n\nOn Saturday, 26th January 2019, the Knittlinger Ausbildungsstellenbörse took place for the 20th time in the foyer of the Dr. Johannes Faust School. And of course we from KIESELMANN were also represented again with our own stand. This year we had a very special highlight at our booth: Using virtual reality glasses, we \"beamed\" the students and their parents into the Swiss Doppelleu Brewery. The viewers could overcome space and time and float through the three-dimensional fermentation and storage cellar of the brewery. You can now watch the 360-degree video on YouTube: Please click here More than 30 training companies from the region were on site. The numerous schoolchildren and parents who attended the fair were able to find out about various job profiles at the stands. KIESELMANN presented the following training occupations and study courses: • Industriekaufmann/-frau\n\n• Fachkraft für Lagerlogistik\n\n• Technische/-r Produktdesigner/-in\n\n• Industriemechaniker/-in\n\n• Anlagenmechaniker/-in\n\n• Zerspanungsmechaniker/-in\n\n• Duales Vollzeitstudium (Bachelor of Arts/ Bachelor of Engineering) In some classrooms, speakers gave lectures on different training occupations. Mrs. Lotspeich, trainer of the company KIESELMANN, introduced the profession \"plant mechanic\". At the beginning of the presentation Mrs. Lotspeich showed our training film. It offers a good overview of the various training opportunities at KIESELMANN. Have you already seen it on YouTube?

The interior of the festively decorated multi-purpose hall was already filled with KIESELMANN employees. The management and the works council of the company had invited to the annual celebration in 2018. In his welcoming address, Managing Director Klaus Dohle spoke of another labour-intensive year of success. He praised the dedication of the staff, to whom it was thanks that one could once again draw such a successful balance. In the past twelve months, the number of employees in Knittlingen had risen from 347 to 377. The KIESELMANN Fluid Process Group has also grown: the company Gross Behälterbau GmbH in Steißlingen on Lake Constance. KIESELMANN has had another record year. The company was able to achieve its sales targets early on and even surpass them in the year ahead. In Knittlingen alone, KIESELMANN recorded a turnover high of 70 million euros. Within the entire Fluid Process Group (FPG), 180 million euros were achieved.\n\nLargest single order\n\nLast year's highlight was the \"Expansion of the fermentation and storage cellar\" project at the Königs Pilsener Brewery in Duisburg. An impressive project by the company KIESELMANN Anlagenbau, in which almost 1,000 valves from Knittlingen are installed. The project is the largest single order in the company's history to date. \"Despite Brexit chaos, international conflicts of action and timid economic forecasts, we at KIESELMANN are optimistic. We also expect full capacity utilization in 2019,\" Klaus Dohle concluded his global analysis. In 2019, the company is investing 3.5 to 4 million euros, including in the expansion of its high-bay warehouse. In this context, Klaus Dohle expressed his special thanks to the shareholders who approved these funds.\n\nInvestments pay off\n\nBy 2017, the shareholders had already released 7 million euros for the new production hall with canteen and offices. This largest single investment has already paid off. Final assembly was relocated to the new hall. The canteen is also always well frequented. A fact that is not least due to the cooking skills of canteen boss Wolfgang Wittig. He was also responsible for the refinements of this evening's festive menu. But before Klaus Dohle opened the buffet, the jubilarians of the year were honoured.\n\nHonours and farewells\n\nNoreen Weinmann, Philipp Sedello, Fabio Paese, Marina Jenner, Sebastian Marquart, Oliver Stezelberger, Marc Traub, Dominic Rieth and Timo Pirchmoser were awarded for 10 years of service. Gerhard Zymla has been with the company for 25 years. Werner Nitsch and Lucie Dürr received an honorary certificate from the Chamber of Industry and Commerce for 40 years of loyalty to the company. Jürgen Dähne, Roland Kratzmeier, Albert Bajas, Miftar Gashi, Edwin Beisel, Klaus Kehrer and Günter Plag retired. \"As a future-oriented company, we are grateful for any kind of stability and continuity. We are proud of our traditionally low fluctuation and the above-average length of service of you, our employees,\" Klaus Dohle addressed his words to those celebrating the anniversary. After the honours of the anniversary celebrants, Klaus Dohle opened the festive buffet.\n\nStrong team\n\nThe KIESELMANN tradition also includes a short presentation of the first year trainees and a review of the year compiled by trainees. A joyful reminiscence and hearty laughter of the KIESEL men and women accompanied the review of the year. Also during the following dance performance of the trainees no eye remained dry. The trainees heated up the invited guests to the soccer hit \"Waka Waka\" by the Colombian singer Shakira. Now it was time for the employees to swing their dancing legs. The DJ played the first party hits and the bartenders mixed alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The seats were quickly emptied and the dance floor filled with the good-humoured KIESELMANN staff, who danced in the disco light until well after midnight. When the lights went on again in the Festhalle, everyone agreed: This was a celebration worthy of a successful year.\n\nYou can see more photos of the celebration on the KIESELMANN Facebook page: Please click here.\n\n10th day of training at Kieselmann\n\nOn Thursday, 9.11.2018, we had 54 trainees visiting us for the 10th day of training. Lena Lotspeich welcomed the guests, who had also arrived from Rieger and Guth, punctually at 8 o'clock. Caroline Pötzl then took the floor and introduced the KIESELMANN Fluid Process Group.\n\nAt 8:45 a.m. the day's program began with a communicative get-to-know game, moderated by Eva Reinhardts from the vocational training company hiwentis in Sternenfels. Afterwards she conducted an interactive training with the trainees on the topic of tolerance. At 11:45 a.m., canteen manager Wolfgang Wittig invited them to a delicious lunch. For the subsequent group photo, a small digestive walk into the new final assembly was scheduled. Markus Haller from BARMER Krankenkasse then spoke about the dos and don'ts in everyday business life, the business etiquette.\n\nAt 2:15 p.m. all trainees were sitting in the bus in the direction of Vaihingen Enz. The destination of the short trip was the Ensinger Mineralquelle site. Here the trainees could take a look at the production and see the products of their companies live in action. Around 17.00 o'clock it went back to Knittlingen. Once there, the 10th day of training ended with a delicious dinner in a good mood.\n\nYou can see more photos of the 10th training day on our Facebook page: Please click here\n\nIntervitis 2018\n\nMeet the KIESELMANN exhibition team from 4 to 6 November at the leading trade fair for the entire process chain: the INTERVITIS INTERFRUCTA HORTITECHNICA. Every two years, technology for wine, juice and specialty crops is presented there. The German Viticulture Association (DWV) and the German Agricultural Society (DLG) support the association.\n\nWe congratulate Paul Schreiter to a 1st place and a 3rd place\n\nPaul Schreiter from Dürrenbüchig took third place in the state competition of the German craft trades in the training occupation of tank and apparatus constructor. As early as the beginning of October, the 22-year-old qualified for the state competition as the winner of the Karlsruhe Chamber of Skilled Crafts. Craftsmanship and the skilful processing of his journeyman's piece, a stainless steel container with a diameter of 300 mm, had brought him victory at chamber level.\n\nHere at KIESELMANN, he produced the award-winning final thesis. Paul Schreiter completed his early training as a tank and apparatus builder in July. \"We are very proud of Mr. Schreiter. The chamber victory and the top position in the state competition underline his very good training performance\", congratulates Lena Lotspeich, Human Resources Manager at Kieselmann GmbH.\n\nSince 1951, the best up-and-coming craft talents at chamber, state and federal level have been determined in Germany in the \"Profis leisten was\" (PLW) competition. This year, 45 men and 19 women took part in 38 competitive professions in the district of the Karlsruhe Chamber of Crafts. The associates and journeymen had to prove their skills in specific competition tasks.\n\nKIESELMANN Fluid Process Group: 360-degree solutions\n\nThe Kieselmann Fluid Process Group presents 360-degree solutions at the BrauBeviale in Hall 9/9-304. The range of products offered by the group extends from individual components to customised systems for the brewery and beverage industry.\n\nThe group grew to 12 companies in 2018. The new addition: Gross Behälterbau. Kieselmann, Kieselmann Anlagenbau, Rieger Behälterbau, Guth Ventiltechnik, AquaDuna and Gross Behälterbau will present a selection of their services tailored to breweries at the fair. Highlights include long-stroke valves, control valves with Bluetooth control, the trend-setting Kieselmann double-seat valves and valve control heads. The latter are available in many different versions, from PLC, ASI bus, IO-Link, with position feedback and with configurable LED colour display.\n\nVisitors can experience the concentrated strength of the Fluid Process Group in a “Virtual Reality Experience”. Computer-controlled 3-D glasses give the impression of being beamed directly from the Kieselmann exhibition stand into the fermenting cellar of the “Brauwerkstatt Doppelleu” 400 kilometres away. “We tested the 3-D glasses and are thrilled. A slight head movement is enough to discover new details in the fermentation cellar. It’s a fascinating way to visualise a project and convey information in a living way,” reports Klaus Dohle, managing director of KIESELMANN GmbH, about his personal experience. The Doppelleu fermenting cellar was designed by Kieselmann Anlagenbau and carried out with tanks, pipes, valves and cleaning technology from the Fluid Process Group companies.\n\nNew records at the 4th KIESELMANN Bicycle Campaign\n\nFrom 15 May to 15 September 2018, KIESELMANN once again ridden a lot of bicycles! The fourth year of the \"Take your bike to work\" campaign was marked by new records. The number of participants, 63 employees, exceeded the previous years.\n\nAlready the number of participants of 63 employees exceeded the previous years. \"We are very pleased about the great response. Every 6th employee took part in the campaign,\" says Human Resources Manager Lena Lotspeich. The cyclists pedalled for four months and, with a total distance of 12,370 kilometers, surpassed the previous year's mark.\n\nThis \"KIESELMANN aktiv\" programme item combines the pleasure of cycling with a good cause. Following the campaign, KIESELMANN will donate a sum of money to the \"Family Hotel Lebensweg\". \"We have created the KIESELMANN active program for the well-being and health promotion of our employees. Our donation to the \"Family Hostel Lebensweg\" supports an institution that relieves families with seriously ill children in their daily work\", says KIESELMANN Managing Director Klaus Dohle.\n\nA prize draw created an additional incentive to demand as many kilometres as possible from the bicycle. Anyone who lives no less than one kilometre away from the company and came by bicycle or e-bike at least 25 times during the campaign period found their name in the lottery pot. On September 28th the lucky fairy Zoe Deppert drew the names of the three winners: Philipp Sedello (plant engineering), Alexander Neff (AV) and Norbert Schmid (logistics) are now owners of a new eBook Reader.\n\nA strong partnership: German-Russian Days at KIESELMANN\n\nFrom 17 to 21 September we had the colleagues from KIESELMANN Rus, KIESELMANN Rus Süd and KIESELMANN Belarus on a visit. On the agenda were trainings, hands on trainings, plant visits and company visits. A German-Russian week at KIESELMANN, dedicated to new valve technology and sales strategies.\n\nOn Monday, September 17, KIESELMANN Managing Director Klaus Dohle and Sales Manager Dieter Biszwurm welcomed the delegation in Knittlingen. After a company tour Dieter Biszwurm spoke about the national and international objectives of KIESELMANN Germany. In this context he also praised the successful German-Russian cooperation since the foundation of KIESELMANN Rus. The Tuesday morning began with a lecture by process engineer Michael Reinmuth on pigging technology. Afterwards Dieter Biszwurm talked about the strengths of our valves and presented innovations. On the following day, the Russian colleagues were able to put the products through their paces. During the \"Hands on Training\" with Alexander Hauser, they were able to put their knowledge to practical use.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon they went to the AquaDuna company. In Sternenfels, a small town only a few kilometres away from the KIESELMMANN headquarters, the KI-Top valve actuators are conceived and their inner workings manufactured. The company, which belongs to the Fluid Process Group, also develops the cleaning technology for the group of companies. After the tour stop at AquaDuna, they went on to Stuttgart.\n\nThe Russian delegation used the program-free Thursday to take a look at the state capital and read the information of the preceding days. On Friday, a visit to VA GmbH Gesellschaft für Food-Processing in Stuttgart was on the agenda. Mr. Schenzle from the management presented the Fluid Process Group company and its membrane filtration technology. In the dairy industry, membrane filtration complements or completely replaces the tried and tested thermal processes. The Russian delegation spent the last evening of this eventful week in a relaxed atmosphere in downtown Stuttgart. On the following day, the plane took off again from Stuttgart in the direction of Moscow.\n\nDo Skorogo!\n\nKIESELMANN Kickers: Brilliant parades and late goals\n\nOn Friday, September 7th, the KIESELMANN company football team competed in the local derby at the Weisach Stadium in Knittlingen. The friendly match against the Neumo company has been an integral part of the Knittlingen Sports Festival for years.\n\nWhen the game was kicked off at 6 pm, numerous colleagues had already mixed among the spectators to cheer on the KIESELMANN Kickers. Our 16 man strong squad was hungry for victory and sent a highly motivated starting eleven to the field. Even the Neumo team presented itself in the first half of the game strong and defensive. So the KIESELMANN Kickers could not reward themselves with a goal despite good passes, passionate runs and playful cleverness. But not only the attack was ambitious, also the defense was closed and prevented that Neumo came to the end.\n\nHalf time: 0:0. Kick-off for the second half and appearance of Fatih Yesildag. The KIESELMANN goalkeeper parried a penalty and flew and hechtete from one brilliant parade to the next. After the penalty our team got new wind. Jens Schabinger, who had spent the first half coaching at the edge of the field, changed, took a heart and scored a dream goal to 1:0 by long-range shot. Why not immediately so, thought Andre Link and shot shortly afterwards the 2-0 winning goal.\n\nA successful interplay. Also new players, like Julian Stimpfl, were immediately integrated into the team and showed full commitment. The morning before the match, Julian Stimpfl had taken part in the introductory event for new trainees and had met some of his teammates for the first time during the company tour. We think such a victory is a good start to training for a prospective industrial clerk. We wish him and all the new trainees further victories and congratulate our KIESELMANN Kickers on their great team performance.\n\n11 new members in the Kieselmann team\n\nAt the beginning of September we welcomed our new trainees. 11 young people started their careers at KIESELMANN these days. We are looking forward to one trainee as an industrial clerk, one prospective industrial clerk, four machining mechanics, two industrial mechanics, two plant mechanics and one trainee, who will start his career with us as a specialist for warehouse logistics.\n\nThe first KIESELMANN day began with a friendly \"Hello and welcome\" from their future colleagues. The \"godparents\" also welcomed the trainees and answered their first questions. The KIESELMANN \"trainee sponsorship\" makes trainees of the higher apprenticeship years the first point of contact for the new trainees. \"From apprentice to apprentice it is sometimes easier to ask a question. Sponsorship is also a great thing for apprentices in their senior years. We show them that we value their know-how and commitment,\" says Kieselmann Human Resources Manager Lena Lotspeich. During the company tour and the joint meal in the company canteen, the \"new\" and the \"old\" employees already exchanged a lot. We wish all trainees a good start. Welcome to the team!\n\nLiving history: Third KIESELMANN pensioners meeting\n\nOn Friday, 20 July 2017, KIESELMANN managing director Klaus Dohle welcomed former employees to the third KIESELMANN alumni meeting.. Among the numerous guests of honour were KIESELMANN shareholders Rosemarie Zitsch and Renate Dohle. \"It's nice to see so much lively KIESELMANN history”, said Klaus Dohle. Former members who recently retired from the company took part in the day of recognition as well as those whose last working days were in the 1990s.\n\nIn the new company canteen, they were served a hearty “Weißwurst breakfast” with pretzels, Leberkäs, Obazda, beer and soft drinks. It was proper fortification for taking a tour together with Klaus Dohle through the pastKIESELMANN year. The building complex where the meeting took place was inaugurated in late 2017. The pensioners had just visited the building shell last year. Now they sat in the inviting company canteen and marvelled at the machinery of the new production hall and the offices of Pharmatec GmbH. The two production managers Dietmar Kappus and André Becker and Pharmatec managing director René Schuler led the alumni through the premises in three groups.\n\nFollowing the companytour, Christian Ernst, senior project manager for large-scale brewing projects at KIESELMANN Anlagenbau, presented the Doppelleu Braukeller Virtual Reality Experience. It offered an animated 360-degree tracking shot through the fully glazed fermenting cellar of the Swiss Craft Beer Brewer. The imposing system was planned by KIESELMANN Anlagenbau and implemented with components from the FLUID PROCESS GROUP. “It is crazy what you can do now. It was a very special experience” said a spectator about the presentation.\n\nAfter all the new impressions, the pensioners could exchange their thoughts over coffee and cake in a relaxed way. A lot of laughter and memories of old times at the KIESELMANN Kaffeeklatsch: There were very personal KIESELMANN stories, which formed a colourful mosaic of the company.\n\nYou can see more photos of the third KIESELMANN pensioners meeting on Facebook: Please click here.\n\nKIESELMANN continues to be goal-oriented: Top times at CityCup 2018\n\nOn 14 July, 36 KIESELMANN runners went to the starting line at the Kraichgau CityCup 2018.. Including 8 KIESELMANN kids, who received their starting numbers under a bright sunny sky. Things got started at 4:45 pm with the 800-metre run for under ten-year-olds. Four-year-old Fynn Bohner from the KIESELMANN Kids Team also scored 3rd place in his age group.\n\nAt 5:15 pm the starting signal was given for the U16 runners. Jonas Stezelberger ran the 1600 metres unrivaled for 1st place in his age group. High temperatures and an arm injury could not stop Maurice Reinmuth. He scored second place in the 2007 group. Mia Stezelberger and Selina Kratzmeier in their yellow KIESELMANN shirts were also happy about their 3rd and 4th place finish in their age groups.\n\nIn the 5-kilometre race, 21 KIESELMANN runners competed with 228 other participants. Andre Link sprinted through the finish as the best KIESELMANN runner. He received first place in his age group with a time of 24:10 minutes. Tilo Oehme scored second place in the U23 juniors. Daniel Hidalgo and Marcel Gottke finished in 6th place, Markus Bohner and Matthias Pötzl in 7th place and Michael Reinmuth in 8th place in their age groups. Edgar Kratzmeier made a point landing in the top ten. He was tenth in the age group M55. For Fabian Hidalgo, the 1600 metres for the U16 was too short. He started the 5000 circuit and sprinted directly to first place among the U16 runners with a time of 26:41 minutes.\n\nThere were two toprankings for the KIESELMANN women. Caroline Pötzl and Isolde Dohle passed the finish line as second best in their respective age group. Lena Lotspeich was seventh and Jennifer Domes 10th in her age group.\n\nIn the supreme event of the CityCup, the 10,000 metre race, 7 KIESELMANN runners started with 119 other runners.

Olaf Kiefer (5th place), Christian Löffler (6th place) and Leo Olfert (8th place) also came in the top ten for their respective age groups.\n\nWe want to congratulate all KIESELMANN runners on theirgreat results. The great atmosphere in the team is also reflected in the overall ranking. The KIESELMANN team took second place in the list of kilometres covered this year. Tilo Oehme won the Rewe shopping voucher associated with this placement by lottery.\n\nYou can view more photos of the Kraichgau CityCup on KIESELMANN’s Facebook page: please click here .\n\nSecond “Experience Education” cooperative event\n\nTechnical classes from theDr. Ing. Johannes Faust Realschule visiting KIESELMANN.\n\nIt is said that everyone holds the key to their own success. The matching key fob was given to 19 ninth graders from the Dr. Johannes Faust Realschule when they visited us on 13 June.\n\nFor a whole morning, the teenagers had time to get to know our company and its industrial-technicaltraining programme. The technology-enthusiastic students looked over the shoulders of apprentices and their instructors and also tried out the workstations. The students received live and direct answers to their questions at different workstations.\n\nWhat is the job of an industrial machinist? How big are the plants that one handles as a plant machinist? What do you do as a cutting machine operator? This morning, the answer to this question was: 19 key fobs. By turning and milling, raw material was used to create a laser-marked stainless steel key fob with the name of the student. The students and their teacher, Mr Fisser, were enthusiastic. “This is a great opportunity for the students to get a taste of the apprentice trades and to see first-hand what the requirements are. It is also nice to see how much fun it can be to learn a profession”, commented Mr Fisser on the cooperation.\n\nLena Lotspeich, HR manager at Kieselmann also drew a positive summary: \"This was the second event of this kind, which we organised in cooperation with Dr. Ing. Johannes Faust Realschule. We are completely satisfied and would like to thank Mr Fisser and the management of Dr. Ing. Johannes Faust Realschule for the very good cooperation. And of course we would be happy to see some of the students again as KIESELMANN apprentices next year”, said Lena Lotspeich with an eye toward the start of training in 2019.\n\nKIESELMANN International Sales Days 2018\n\nThree days of global success: the International Sales Days 2018. From the 26-28 June we had sales partners from 12 countries visiting Knittlingen. The new and established strengths of the KIESELMANN portfolio stood at the centre of addresses for the colleagues from Kieselmann France, Kieselmann UK, Kieselmann Liquid Processing Equipment (Beijing), Carein, Denwel, BCG, DFB, Aegir, S.K.S, Difusa, Fagerberg, Técnica de Fluidos, Rodger Industries\n\nIt started on Tuesday morning with training by the development manager Uwe Heisswolf on valve control heads. Immediately afterwards, he introduced the AquaDuna cleaning technology and the recently optimised KIESELMANN tank dome fitting. The morning ended with a presentation by sales manager Dieter Biszwurm about valve manifolds. After the lunch break, a tour of the factory was on the agenda. The participants went into the heart of the company: production and manufacturing. The newmachine park in hall 7, which was inaugurated in 2017, received a particularly appreciative appraisal. In the evening people met in Bretten in the restaurant Brettener Hundle to close the first day in a cosy atmosphere.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Thomas Dreisigacker, sales manager at Guth Ventiltechnik, welcomed the international colleagues. The presentation by the Landauer Fluid Process Group member was followed by a lecture by Uwe Heisswolf on control valves. In the afternoon, Uwe Heisswolf and Sebastian Gensheimer, Head of QS, talked about aftersales services and quality assurance. After the lunch break, Jürgen Raichle introduced his specialist area in plant construction to the audience: pigging technology. The evening concluded in the restaurant Schweizer Hof in Bretten.\n\nOn Thursday, the last day of the international sales training, regular, double and single-seat valves as well as the popular “hands on training” were on the day’s programme. During the hands on training, the listeners became users, moving away from theory to practice. At the final dinner at the Restaraunt Bona in Diedelsheim, the international company spent a long time exchanging views on the new products and features on Thursday evening. The International Sales Days 2018 can be summed up in a few words:a good mood and lots of information .\n\nMore photos can be seen on Facebook: Please click here.\n\nKIESELMANN takes over Gross Behälter- und Anlagenbau\n\nunder the new name GROSS Behälterbau GmbH.\n\nWith retroactive effect from May 15, Gross Behälter- und Anlagenbau GmbH was integrated into the KIESELMANN Fluid Process Group under the new name GROSS Behälterbau GmbH. As a result, the continued existence of the company, which was facing insolvency-related closure before the takeover, is secured.\n\nFrom now on, Gross will complement the Fluid Process Group company Rieger Behälterbau in stainless steel tank construction. “With Gross we welcome another experienced and well- trained team to the Fluid Process Group. Building on decades of experience Gross will continue to design, manufacture and assemble quality stainless steel containers in Steißlingen”, said KIESELMANN manager Klaus Dohle.\n\nDan Mayer, who has already successfully directed Rieger Behälterbau, will take over the management of Gross: “We know what Gross can do. We will continue to use these strengths to successfully realise projects”, commented Dan Mayer on the takeover.\n\nKIESELMANN players and the Neff vs. Neff duel\n\nLast Friday, 18 May, the KIESELMANN company football team played against the Neff company team in the Talbach Stadium of the TSV 1891 Rinklingen. The start was at 7:00 pm, and from the start the KIESELMANN Kickers had the ball under control. However, the team failed to exploit the first good opportunities. A shot by Patrick Dolt broke the spell and gave KIESELMANN a 1-0 lead.\n\nThe tempo increased and every ball was won and defended in the best football weather. Many passionate duels called the referee to the scene. So the first goal for the Neff team was also a penalty. In the second half of the game, there was another penalty in favour of the Brettener and thus a direct duel of Neff against Neff. Substitute KIESELMANN goalkeeper Alexander Neff lost out and Neff's penalty-taker shot the ball safely in the goal. Once again, the referee had to call a penalty. Patrick Dolt stood for KIESELMANN, kept his nerve and kicked the ball safely in the Neff goal.\n\nThe KIESELMANN Kickers scored four more goals in the game, leaving it at 6-2 for the final whistle. A great result for the KIESELMANN 11. In the end, Patrick Dolt and Pascal Legner had two goals each. Christian Hidalgo and KIESELMANN captain Jens Schabinger hit the scoresheet with one goal. Despite the three penalised fouls, the game was characterised by a fair, sporting competition. This was also reflected in the handshakes and congratulations exchanged after the game.\n\nMore photos of the game can be seen on our Facebook page: please click here.\n\nOpportunities for advancement: FV Knittlingen and KIESELMANN cooperate\n\nOn Thursday, 26 April 2017, FV Knittlingen was our guest.\n\nIt all began at 6:00 pm with a short welcome speech from KIESELMANN HR Manager Lena Lotspeich in the company restaurant. 11 A and B youth players, coaches and club officials as well as interested parents received an invitation. Lena Lotspeich presented the company and the commercial and occupational training at the Knittlinger family business to the players. Instructors from various departments accompanied the players during the tour of the factory and introduced them to the workplaces and areas of activity. There is a wide range of training options: from plant machinists to industrial clerk to cutting machine operator, there is something for everyone. After the tour, KIESELMANN chef Wolfgang Wittig served everyone present.\n\nThe motto of the evening was: Success as a team. The players and instructors at KIESELMANN exchanged views on team spirit and fair play. They quickly found the similarities between sports and education together. Both in education and on the football field, there are rules that are important in order to create fairness and equal opportunities. This resulted in interesting discussions, in which all present took active part. It was agreed that a team grows together if you have common goals. The cup, the successful degree, the promotion, hiring after the end of the training.\n\nKIESELMANN is proud of its high hiring ratio. “Our continuous growth enables us to hire our apprentices after training into a permanent employment relationship”, said HR Manager Lena Lotspeich. And we want to continue this high hiring ratio. “Of course, this also requires that our apprentices complete their training successfully and remain loyal to us”, explained Lena Lotspeich. For this reason, in addition to an attractive training position, the company also offers a wide range of benefits.\n\nThe FV Knittlingen not only offers its players perspectives in sports with this cooperation, but also supports them in the search for training positions. After an enthusiastic reception about training and football, the FV players and the KIESELMANN team parted ways around 8 pm with a friendly: “Goodbye”. FV Knittlingen executive Marcus Egler thanked KIESELMANN for the invitation and the nice exchange, and Lena Lotspeich also thanked the players and their companions for their interest.\n\nMore pictures of the evening can be found on our Facebook page: Link\n\nNEW: KIESELMANN bung valve now with plastic adjusting nut\n\nFrom now KIESELMANN bunging devices will have a plastic adjusting nut (POM polyoxymethylene). The POM plastic has very good mechanical properties and the advantage that the “seizure” of the thread can be excluded with frequent adjustment of the pressure range. Another advantage of the plastic is its high chemical resistance to common cleaning agents. The housing of the adjusting nut with the scale is still made of stainless steel.\n\nDo you have any questions about our new plastic adjusting nut? We are happy to answer you in writing or by phone: 07043 371-0\n\nTake care, Günter!\n\nFor more than four decades he was the heart of the KIESELMANN HR department.\n\nAfter 48 years, Günter Plag is now entering his well-deserved retirement. The company officially bid him farewell on 7 March at the Leadership Event at Palazzo Mannheim. “Thank you very much for what you have done over the years for KIESELMANN. It's hard to let you go”, said KIESELMANN managing director Klaus Dohle to the guest of honour that evening.\n\nGünter Plag joined KIESELMANN in 1969 and graduated in 1972 with an industrial management degree. His expert and cordial manner paved the way for him to the position of HR manager. “There were difficult decisions, but also many beautiful ones - like the radiant faces of those who had just signed their employment contract”, recalled Günter Plag about the past 48 years at KIESELMANN.\n\nIn the 1980s KIESELMANN still had only 160 employees. Today, 2018, it has more than twice as many: 347 employees. The hiring ratio of 100% for apprentices who are looking for a career at KIESELMANN after completing their training is also an important calling card of the company, which the former HR manager helped to shape. “I learned a lot from Günter and I will miss his heartfelt and attentive approach. I'm stepping in to fill some very big shoes. But I'm looking forward to it”, said the new HR manager Lena Lotspeich.\n\nLeadership Event 2018\n\nOn Wednesday, 7 March, KIESELMANN management invited people to the annual “Leadership Event”. The evening event is a much-awaited surprise bag every year. Until the departure of the bus in front of the KIESELMANN main building, the participants do not know where the journey was headed. This year brought the leadership and their male or female companions to Mannheim. No sooner had they passed the town sign of the square city, they could already see the destination of the evening: the Radio Regenbogen Harald Wohlfahrt Palazzo. In the Art Nouveau pavilion, refined four-course menus provide culinary delights from the 3-star chef Harald Wohlfahrt and a varied show programme ensured the participants were amazed. A quarter of a million enthusiastic visitors have been immersed in the unique world of enjoyment and sensual pleasures since its start 19 years ago. The Palazzo guests make their pilgrimages to Mannheim from Berlin, Hamburg, Münster, Munich - and on 7 March also from Knittlingen.\n\nReception and farewell\n\nWords of farewell were said at a reception area reserved for KIESELMANN that evening: Günter Plag officially said goodbye. For 48 years he was the HR manager at KIESELMANN. Now he has retired. He and his wife were seated in two stylish red leather armchairs. Visibly stirred, Mr. Plag and his wife listened to the words of KIESELMANN managing director Klaus Dohle. He talked about their time together and the things that Günter Plag had initiated as HR manager. For over four decades, he shaped the HR department of the company through his unique personality.\n\nAcrobatics and culinary arts\n\nAfterwards, the good-humoured company around KIESELMANN managing director Klaus Dohle took a seat to enjoy breathtaking acrobatics and refinements from the kitchen. 30 international artists showed an intoxicating potpourri of artistry: starting with “Golden Dream”, an air piece by the athletes Ambra Faggioni and Yves Nicols, who moved up and down from the ceiling on ropes - then to Pavel Voladas on the quad, who flew weightlessly from pole to pole sometimes blindfolded - followed by the “Kung Fu Boys” from China, who hopped up a flight of stairs on their heads - then a clumsy slapstick trampoline number from “Professor Wacko” - and finally acrobats from the “Above the Clouds” ensemble from St. Petersburg, who catapulted from two so-called Russian swings across the heads of the visitors through the air. The whole thing was framed by the Palazzo dancers and humorous anecdotes by the comedy and drag artists Chris Kolonko and Joy Peters.\n\nNo less acrobatic were the tastes: marinated black tiger prawns in panko flour, red ice sea trout on pickled pumpkin vegetables; glazed guinea fowl breast on kaffir lime risotto, and as a vegetarian variant couscous on oriental spices with glazed pak choi. Perfectly flavoured and served at the same time to500 guests.\n\nAn extremely successful event, which brought the team closer together. The management thanked the leadership team for the successes of the anniversary year with this special surprise evening. In 2017 KIESELMANN celebrated its 80th anniversary.\n\nOn weekends like this ...\n\nIf you have kept hearing the words “great mood”, “excellent weather” and “optimal piste conditions” during the past few days, you can assume that your colleague was also present at this year's KIESELMANN ski weekend in Damüls.\n\nIn recent years, Damüls has become a kind of “KIESELMANN ski home”. Ski and snowboard enthusiasts made their way to the Austrian Vorarlberg region last Friday for the sixth time. After an entertaining bus ride and an invigorating champagne breakfast, our cheerful travelling party reached the Damüls valley station. From there we took the lift at 1850 m altitude to the mountain inn Elsenalpstube.\n\nIn Damüls everyone, from beginners to downhill specialists, will find the right slope to enjoy their days in the snow. And the fun doesn’t stop when the sun disappears behind the Damüls mountain. The entire KIESELMANN team meets for aprés-ski at the bar then. In a word: Legendary.\n\nLet's experience the best ...\n\nAfter an amusing evening and a long or short night, Saturday quickly passes by. The participants conquered the pistes, laughed a lot, danced, ate, drank and sighed again and again at the sight of the mountain panorama. A perfect weekend. The mood was also great on Sunday, and the weather was fantastic - so it was difficult for everyone to break free after a final descent and start the journey home.\n\nSee you again soon Damüls!\n\nMore photos of the KIESELMANN ski weekend can be seen on our Facebook page: Click here\n\nKIESELMANN: New long-stroke valve at Anuga FoodTec\n\nKieselmann presents new long-stroke single-seat valves at the Anuga FoodTec in Cologne. The KI-DS single-seat valve is available in all standard sizes from DN 25 to DN 100. The modular long-stroke valves with dead-space-free housing and maintenance-free drive are ideal as a tank outlet and control valve for the production of chunky media such as fruit yoghurts. The drive can be disassembled in a few simple steps, turned 180 degrees and reinstall. By “turning it upside down” you change its mode of operation from air-opening-spring-closing to spring-opening-air-closing or vice versa.\n\nOther new products include aseptic small seat valves, aseptic sampling valves, inch inline housings and a new Bluetooth configurable positioner for lift and rotary control valves. Also included is the brand-new reference work for the plant manufacturer, the new Kieselmann product catalogue with more than 8,000 articles. Together with Kieselmann GmbH, further companies of the Kieselmann Fluid Process Group, FPG will be at the booth B020 / C029 in hall 10.2. At Rieger Behälterbau, Guth Ventiltechnik and Kieselmann Anlagenbau, the name says it all. The companies present tanks, fittings and plant construction services from the Fluid Process Group. The FPG group of companies acts as a full-range supplier in all aspects of process engineering, from individual components to turnkey systems.\n\nGünter Plag: the HR manager says goodbye\n\nFor almost fifty years he was the heart of the human resources department at KIESELMANN. He had his last day of work on 16 February 2018. After 48 years, Günter Plag is now entering his well-deserved retirement. The native Knittlinger has helped shape the company through his style. He is one of those people you would call “original” . It’s hard to describe, you had to experience him. And everyone just likes like him. “Der Günter” was appreciated by everyone. He approached his work as if it were a Udo Lindenberg song: he did his thing. And he did his job really well: professionally, humanly and with the instincts needed to make personnel decisions.\n\nThere is still a lot to say and to praise, but Günter Plag never liked to make a big deal about himself. So we will keep it short and say: Thank you, Günter Plag!\n\n2nd place at the Brewery Ski Cup\n\nFor ski enthusiasts in the brewing guild, the last weekend of January is a special date. The Brewery Ski-Cup has been taking place over these three days since 2004. A sociable sporty slope - competition for the industry. 190 participants took part in Rettenberg this year to compete with other teams in the giant slalom from 26 to 28 January. Among them was the KIESELMANN team with Klaus Dohle, Pascal Bühler, Axel Vollmer and Jürgen Zehetner.\n\nEarly Saturday morning, the KIESELMANN team started in a good mood and in top form at the giant slalom. The slopes and weather conditions were almost ideal and the three participants shot to the finish line at a rapid pace. Dressed in a chic blue KIESELMANN jacket and signal red trousers, the team headed by managing director Klaus Dohle mastered the giant slalom in toptime and thus took second place in the team ranking by the sponsors. The fastest of the KIESELMANN racing team, Pascal Bühler, was also happy about his 5th place ranking in the overall standings.\n\nOn Saturday evening they met in Kranzegg for the cheerful BrewerOlympiad. They hammered with a double-handled hammer, tackled a slalom course on a skateboard on the Zipfelbob and laughed and celebrated. An award ceremony followed the amusing Olympiad. With great pleasure the KIESELMANN team entered the podium as the second sponsorship team. “A great end to an equally great day with excellent weather. Once again, everything was well-organised and integrated in an entertaining supporting programme. The mood in the KIESELMANN team was great again . We are looking forward to next year”, said Klaus Dohle.\n\nMany thanks to the Brauer Cup GbR Rettenberg and Akams Medien for the pictures!

Knittlinger trainee job fair\n\nOn Saturday, 27 January 2018, the Knittlinger trainee job fair took place for the 19th time in the foyer of Dr. Ing. Johannes Faust School. KIESELMANN was represented again with its own booth this year.\n\nThe students as well as their parents were able to find out about various occupational profiles at the company booths. Over 30 training companies from the region were on site. KIESELMANN presented the following training occupations and study programmes:\n\n• Industrial clerk\n\n• Technical product designer\n\n• Specialist for warehouse logistics\n\n• Industrial machinist\n\n• Machinist\n\n• Plant machinist\n\n• Dual full-time studies (Bachelor of Arts / Bachelor of Engineering)\n\nIn addition, lectures on different training occupations were shown in several classrooms.\n\nMs Lotspeich, trainer at KIESELMANN, presented the machinist profession. At the beginning of the presentation, our training film was shown for the second time this year. With our apprentices in the lead roles, the film offers a good overview of the training opportunities at KIESELMANN.\n\nFurther information on the subject of training at KIESELMANN can be obtained from Ms Lotspeich, Tel: 07043 371 322 or by e-mail: Lotspeich@kieselmann.de.\n\nWerner Nitsch honoured for 40 years of service\n\n“40 years of service is no longer a matter of course nowadays. We are pleased and filled with pride to congratulate Mr Nitsch at what is still a young age. He continues the long series of KIESELMANN anniversaries in 2018. On behalf of the entire company, I would like to thank you for the past four decades, during which Mr Nitsch actively supported us”, said Klaus Dohle, managing director of KIESELMANN GmbH. And after 40 years, the 62-year-old is still staying with KIESELMANN. “I have decided to continue working for another 10 years”, said Nitsch. Klaus Dohle replied that he would be happy to announce that Mr. Nitsch was celebrating his 50th anniversary in 2028.\n\nWerner Nitsch started working for KIESELMANN on 2 January 1978. Over the next 40 years, the trained retailer made his contribution to the company's growth and advancement. After the ceremony, he even went straight back to his workplace in the final assembly and mounted more stainless steel valves.\n\nWerner Nitsch did not want to make a “big deal” about his 40 year anniversary with KIESELMANN. Quietly and gratefully, he accepted the honorary certificate of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce and the acknowledgements and congratulations of the management and HR department on 16 January 2018. “I think it's great that KIESELMANN appreciates the loyalty and dedication of its employees”, said Werner Nitsch, praising his employer.\n\nCelebratory finish for the anniversary year\n\nOn 15 December 2017, the management and the works council at KIESELMANN invited employees to the end of the year party. At 5:30 pm, the Knittlinger Stadthalle filled up with company employees. When KIESELMANN managing director Klaus Dohle welcomed the party in the early evening, every seat in the hall was filled: “Dear colleagues and shareholders. We have another year of records behind us. I would like to thank you for that. KIESELMANN stands for innovation, punctual delivery reliability and quality. This is also reflected in our new motto: Passion for quality”\n\nA great year\n\nThe Knittlinger companies KIESELMANN GmbH, KIESELMANN Anlagenbau GmbH and KIESELMANN Pharmatec GmbH jointly generated an annual turnover of 70 million euros. The Fluid Process Group recorded a turnover of 180 million euros. The component area alone gained a remarkable 15 percent last year. “Kieselmann Pharmatec” had the largest single contract of the past financial year at seven million euros. The largest single investment in the history of the company was also made this year. KIESELMANN invested around eight million euros in a new office and production building with a floor area of 3,000 square metres. Another five million were provided for machinery and equipment. This investment was also a sign of loyalty to the location. Another sign wa"
