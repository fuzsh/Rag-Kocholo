        "text": "CalRBS: Artists’ Books in Education: Strategies for Institutional Libraries Course Information\n\nJuly 15-18, 2024 — co-taught by Ruth Rogers and Inge Bruggeman\n\nIn collaboration with the California Rare Book School and UC Berkeley's Environmental Design Library and The Bancroft Library.\n\nCreation and distribution of the contemporary artist book is flourishing on a global scale. From a vast range of media and subject matter, how does one develop the critical insights needed to maintain or build a collection of contemporary artists’ books? This course will explore creative approaches to harness the visual and communicative power of artists’ books, by integrating them into broader curricular objectives.\n\nClass sessions will be held in local research collections where we will meet with librarians and faculty who acquire and teach with artists’ books. Additional programming will include guided hands-on analysis of selected books, with an emphasis on refining curatorial skills. We will share strategies for identifying artists’ books that fit into a cross-disciplinary educational mission, and how they relate to existing historical collections.\n\nPRINTING POETRY WORKSHOP #1 – Sherwin Bitsui\n\nSaturday & Sunday July 27 & 28, 2024\n\n9:30 am – 5:00 pm\n\nFull workshop fee: $320\n\nScholarship workshop fee: $60\n\nTo sign up, please email contact@codexfoundation.org\n\nOur first in a series of letterpress printing workshops with the goal of bringing people together to promote poetry and the printed word. Open to all levels: this class is great for poets, designers, artists, publishers, printers, and others who might be interested in collaborating together while learning the basics of letterpress printing and press equipment.\n\nJoin master letterpress printer Jonathan Gerken at The CODEX Foundation Logan Book Arts Center to create a limited edition broadside in our printshop in Berkeley. The class will honor Sherwin Bitsui who is a Navajo writer and poet. We will print a poem from his book titled Flood Song, which won the American Book Award and the PEN Open Book Award. The class will hand-set the poem using metal type and print enough broadsides for each participant to take a handful of prints. Participants are also invited to attend Sherwin Bitsui’s reading for the UC Berkeley Lunch Poems Series on Thursday, September 5 at 12 pm, where we will hand out copies of the broadside for free. This poetry reading series is held at the Morrison Library on campus and is free and open to the public.\n\nThere are 8 total spots available with 2 reduced fee scholarships reserved for individuals from underserved communities. Please contact us if you are interested in a scholarship position.\n\nUnion de Hojas: UH Book Structure with Sol Rebora\n\nSaturday & Sunday, February 10 – 11, 2024\n\n10 am – 6 pm (with a 1 hour lunch break)\n\n$410 (includes most materials)\n\nPlease contact us for more information and to sign up for this amazing workshop!\n\nDesign + Conservation\n\nLeather spine and Japanese textured paper, hard covers and rounded spine binding.\n\nThis structure proposes a case binding construction with fine finishing details, combining design and conservation concepts along the process construction. We are going to work with a book printed by Ediciones Urania: Ral Veroni - The Princess with an illustration of Ral Veroni.\n\nThe sewing for the signatures provides a flat spine with a very even volume to create a nice rounded spine, and a small shoulder, which is going to be connected to the textblock by a hollow back.\n\nOn this structure the endpapers have a particular construction to work with very thin papers playing with possible transparencies, colors and textures, using this part of the construction as a beautiful way to get into the book. Conservation, design, and technology of the materials works for the structure to provide a perfect opening of the book.\n\nThe Dafi Kühne Printing Show™\n\nThe CODEX Foundation is pleased to announce our first-ever visiting artist talk at The CODEX Foundation Logan Book Arts Center.\n\nThe Dafi Kühne Printing Show™\n\nSunday, January 15, 2023, 4:30 pm\n\nStandard Tickets: $25\n\nStudent Tickets: $20\n\n*Sliding scale tickets will be offered to those in need of assistance.

Limit one ticket per person.\n\nEMAIL US if you would like to sign up to attend this in-person talk.\n\nAbout the artist, Dafi Kühne:\n\nDafi Kühne is a Swiss designer and letterpress printer. He studied in the Visual Communication Department of Zurich University of the Arts, Switzerland and he holds a Research-Masters Degree in Typeface Design from University of Reading, UK. In his studio (babyinktwice.ch) he uses a wild mix of analog and digital tools to produce posters for for music, art, architecture, theatre and film projects, and also for products. With this one main rule in his studio «No PDF ever leaves the studio as a final product», he prints all his posters with letterpress printing presses. His mostly typographic letterpress printed posters have won many international poster design awards and been in exhibitions all around the globe. His designer monograph True Print has been published by Lars Müller Publishers in 2016.\n\nDafi runs his own Typographic Summer Program (www.typographic-printing-program.com) in Switzerland and Pasadena, CA—a two week intense program for students and professionals to learn new approaches to Swiss Typography. While the summer program is a physical workshop Dafi has been looking for a way to document his craziest techniques in a faster online format. With «The Dafi Kühne Printing Show™», he entertainingly documents and explains his process and techniques. Freely available for anyone to enjoy! Besides other international awards, «The Dafi Kühne Printing Show™» won one of the prestigious Swiss Design Awards in 2021.\n\nFor his talk at The CODEX Foundation, Dafi will give us some technical insights into the processes used to create his poster work.\n\nLuminous Books at the Boston Athenæum\n\nMaterialia Lumina | Luminous Books: Concept & Craft in Contemporary Artists’ Books\n\nNOVEMBER 15, 2022 – MARCH 11, 2023\n\nMaterialia Lumina | Luminous Books showcases a selection of outstanding contemporary artists’ books created by some of the world’s most accomplished makers over the past twenty-five years. The books embody a distinctive marriage of “high craft” with “high concept.” They demonstrate a mastery of the traditional arts of the book—printing, printmaking, typography, calligraphy, bookbinding, papermaking, and graphic design—intersecting vigorously with the conceptual daring and exploratory nature of the best contemporary art. The exhibition explores the extraordinary level of skill and persistence involved in creating these beautiful works, as well as their unique power to speak to a range of contemporary issues and concerns.\n\nThese forty selections from the Athenæum’s holdings and the collection of a generous private lender were drawn from a curated list of 75 exemplary works, out of more than 6,000 pieces exhibited at the CODEX International Book Fair, the world’s largest venue for contemporary artists’ books, since the fair’s inception in 2007. The Athenæum is one of three venues for this international exhibition, along with Stanford University Libraries and the Klingspor Museum in Offenbach, Germany. A substantial catalog, with descriptive essays and extensive illustrations, accompanies the exhibition.\n\nUnfortunately, because of space constraints and local availability of works the Athenaeum was not able to show all of the works in the catalog, so we encourage you to experience the imagery and in-depth writings about all the wonderful works in the entire exhibition through the printed catalog.\n\nArtists featured in the exhibition:\n\nSue Anderson and Gwen Harrison, Karen Bleitz, Ken Botnick, Inge Bruggeman, Carolee Campbell, Julie Chen, Donald Glaister, Peggy Gotthold and Lawrence Van Velzer, Leilei Guo, Romano Hänni, Thomas Ingmire, Peter Koch, Clemens-Tobias Lange, Russell Maret, Suzanne Moore, Tim Mosely, Didier Mutel, Robin Price, Sandra Reese and Harry Reese, Felicia Rice, Gaylord Schanilec, Veronika Schäpers, Leonard Seastone, Two Ponds Press, Claire Van Vliet, Sam Winston\n\nSpecial Project: EXTRACTION\n\nEXTRACTION: Art on the Edge of The Abyss\n\nEXTRACTION: Art on the Edge of the Abyss is a multimedia, multi-venue, cross-border art intervention that will investigate extractive industry in all of its forms (from mining and drilling to the reckless exploitation of water, soil, trees, marine life, and other natural resources). The project will expose and interrogate extraction’s negative social and environmental consequences, from the damage done to people, especially indigenous and disenfranchised communities, to ravaged landscapes and poisoned water to climate change and its many troubling implications.\n\nA constellation of simultaneous and overlapping exhibits, installations, performances, site-specific work, land art, street art, publications, and cross-media events, EXTRACTION will take place in multiple locations throughout the U.S. and abroad during the Summer of 2021. The project will be de-centered, non-hierarchical, and self-organizing, which means that artists, art venues, curators, and art supporters will participate and collaborate as they see fit, including helping the project expand geographically. Everyone can be both creator and catalyst. At a time of growing despair and paralysis, people from all backgrounds and levels of experience—from the amateur to the virtuoso—can take action. We invite everyone to join us in creating an international art ruckus.\n\nNothing like EXTRACTION has been attempted before: All art forms, all happening at roughly the same time, with hundreds of artists spread across at least four continents (North and South America, Europe, and Australia). And all addressing a single theme—the suicidal consumption of the planet’s natural resources, which is the most pressing environmental issue of our time, encompassing all others, including climate change.\n\nEXTRACTION: A collective global exclamation: “ENOUGH!”\n\nProminent writers, critics, historians, educators, environmentalists, and other experts have been enlisted as advisors, to provide related texts, and to help us forge affiliations with non-art organizations. The Nevada Museum of Art, a national leader in the exhibition, collection, study, and promotion of environmentally related art, has agreed to archive all project documentation.\n\nEXTRACTION: Art on the Edge of the Abyss is a special project of the CODEX Foundation.\n\nAt the CODEX International Book Fair we have observed that certain books inhabit a distinct and until recently, unexplored territory on the complex map of the book as a work of art. We refer to high-concept and high-craft books dwelling within the uncharted area where the wild variety of artist’s books on the one hand, and the more traditional private press books and livre d’artiste on the other, influence one another and propel the book into a new category altogether. We have begun to refer to this phenomenon as the Third Stream – one that is neither an avant-garde artist’s book nor an illustrated typographic book of the private press/livre d’artiste lineage.\n\nThe third stream book incorporates and even accelerates techniques learned from new technologies while at the same time provides a locus that encourages a refreshing and deeper exploration of traditional artisanal crafts. Classically trained artists and printers who are both accomplished masters and experimentally minded are rare, and when successful, able to propel their ideas of the possibility of a book beyond the easy and comfortable categories while exhibiting an extraordinary sense of place and making.\n\nNew currents indicate the emergence and evolution of highly gifted artists and artisans who embrace the tools and production skills of the traditional arts while dancing on the razor’s edge of intellectual and technological change."
