        "text": "Germany—or Germany as we now know it—is up first, but only because Richard Wagner dominated so much of the conversation during the late Romantic era. Love him or hate him, composers of all backgrounds and nationalities were obliged to have an opinion on Wagner. And they also had to decide whether to follow in his footsteps or take an entirely different musical path.\n\nBy breaking away from Italian traditions such as standalone arias, hummable melodies, and a supreme devotion to the human voice, Wagner helped create an operatic aesthetic that read as 100% German: a style where dramatic scenes blended effortlessly without interruption, the singer was just another instrument in a vast and powerful orchestra, and beautiful tunes were only there to move the story along… if they were there at all.\n\nIt wasn’t to everyone’s taste, but it certainly got everyone talking.\n\nThat’s not to say Wagner was some sort of musical anomaly that came out of nowhere. He was definitely a product of his time and a direct descendant of the (mostly German) composers who came before him, including Weber and Beethoven. And much like Weber, Wagner actively worked to elevate his culture by writing operas rooted in Germanic myth—an attempt to deepen nationalistic fervor and strengthen Germany’s position in the musical canon.\n\nYet no German composer has achieved quite the same unforgettable mixture of fantasy, innovation, and sheer, ear-splitting volume before or since. So we give his art space here, though we hold no quarter for his monstrous behavior as a human being.\n\nWhile Verdi may be the most recognizable name to come out of Italy’s late Romantic era, he wasn’t the only game in town.\n\nSure, Verdi almost single-handedly carried the torch for Italian opera from around 1842 to 1893, and his name was all but synonymous with his native land—to the point where he didn’t really need an address. (Seriously, there’s a legendary rumor that, when someone asked Verdi where to send him some mail, he simply said, “Just label it: Maestro Verdi, Italy.” That’s pretty baller.)\n\nStill, a few of Verdi’s contemporaries have also withstood the test of time, among them composers Amilcare Ponchielli (1834-1886) and Arrigo Boito (1842-1918), Verdi’s sometime librettist. Plus Verdi’s work also paved the way for verismo, a new form of Italian opera that explored the lives of everyday people as well as their interpersonal relationships, socio-political struggles, and fatalistic flaws (see above).\n\nTwo verismo composers to remember are Ruggero Leoncavallo (1857-1919) and Pietro Mascagni (1863-1945). Why commit these names to memory? Because they’re the guys behind opera’s most famous double bill: Cavalleria Rusticana (Rustic Chivalry by Mascagni) and Pagliacci (The Clowns by Leoncavallo).\n\nAlmost never not performed together, these one-act operas are certified authentic™ examples of verismo, spinning tales of normal humans facing normal challenges that lead to shockingly abnormal conclusions. (No spoilers, but you know that sad clown who wields a knife? Not Sideshow Bob, but the other one? Yeah, that guy comes from Pagliacci.)\n\nThe next Italian name you should remember from this period? Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924).\n\nUnlike Leoncavallo and Mascagni, Puccini is considered in a class by himself. Not sure if this is entirely fair, but that’s fame for you.\n\nHowever, if we’re being totally objective, it’s hard not to give the man who wrote La Bohème and Tosca some sort of award for lifetime achievement.* So, in the interest of giving him his due: Puccini’s operas, if not strictly in verismo style, brought much of the verismo spirit into the early decades of the 1900s, often making heroes and heroines out of “ordinary” folks like riverboat captains, painters, poets, seamstresses, and even cowboys.\n\nIn addition, Puccini’s musical experimentation—particularly in his final opera, Turandot—pushed 19th century sonic boundaries while still remaining true to the late Romantics’ taste for gritty drama. If you’re looking for a composer to help bridge the gap between the late Romantic era and the early 20th century, Puccini just might be your uomo (or “man”).\n\nItaly and Germany have stolen much of the late-Romantic limelight as far as history is concerned, but that doesn’t mean France didn’t have plenty to say about opera during the mid-to-late 19th century.\n\nParis was still very much a central operatic hub at the time, and grand opéra (though not as popular in its original form during this period) was still going semi-strong—only now emotional drama could sometimes outweigh dazzling spectacle.\n\nMuch like we do with TV and film today, 19th-century France tended to divide opera into either heavy dramas or laugh-out-loud comedies. French comedies hit their late-Romantic stride thanks to Jacques Offenbach (1819-1880) who pioneered a new-ish genre called the opéra-bouffe or, later, the operetta—a lighter comic opera that would be made mega-famous by the British team of Gilbert and Sullivan. (Offenbach is also responsible for the catchy “can-can” tune we all know and love.)\n\nAcross the aisle, French dramatic opera composers of this era churned out works influenced by music, literature, and philosophy from all over Europe and beyond. Examples included:\n\nLes Pêcheurs de Perles (The Pearl Fishers) by Georges Bizet (1838-1875), set in South Asia and leverages a Eurocentric vision of an “exotic” faraway culture.\n\nRoméo et Juliette (Romeo and Juliet) by Charles Gounod (1818-1893), modeled after the Shakespeare play and mixes sweepingly romantic duets (à la Italian opera) with big and boisterous crowd scenes (a recognizable feature of earlier French grand opéra).\n\nWerther by Jules Massenet (1842-1912), based on a novella by German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, featuring intimate scenes between a small number of lead characters and highlighting “Sturm und Drang” tropes such as unrequited love.\n\nPelléas et Mélisande (Pelleas and Melisande) by Claude Debussy (1862-1918), which carries traces of Wagnerian influence and reflects the rising tide of artistic Impressionism (think Monet, Renoir, or Cézanne) with its dream-like, non-stop score.\n\nIf someone tells you operas are only written in Italian, German, French, or English, do not believe them.\n\nIn keeping with our theme of late Romantic patriotism, composers out of 19th-century Russia and (what would become) Czechoslovakia championed their national cultures with operas inspired by Eastern European poetry, folk songs, and traditions.\n\nWhen talking about this period, Russian music scholars love to cite a five-man group of nationalist composers known as “The Mighty Handful” or “The Mighty Five,” each heavily influenced by maverick Russian musician Mikhail Glinka (1804-1857). But for our purposes, we’ll focus on just three of them: standout Russian opera innovators Alexander Borodin (1833-1887), Modest Mussorgsky (1839-1881), and Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844-1908).\n\nThese mighty three were instrumental in building a Russian operatic style steeped in native history and folk melody, though Mussorgsky is probably *the* late Romantic to know; his epics Boris Godunov (1874) and Khovanshchina (1886) helped establish him as an unofficial “Russian Verdi.”\n\nBut let’s not forget Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikosvky (1840-1893), whose works were decidedly more Westernized and less overtly Russian, but who still composed a beautiful love letter—literally!—to his homeland with an operatic version of Alexander Pushkin’s tearjerker Eugene Onegin (1879).\n\nOver in Czech territory, Bedřich Smetana (1824-1884) helped develop an exclusively Czech form of opera (Czech language, Czech storylines, Czech-inspired melodies and dances, etc.) as a sort of pushback against German occupation. His works are still celebrated as an emblem of Czech national pride, and his 1866 opera The Bartered Bride remains an international favorite.\n\nTo the rest of the world, though, the Romantic Czech composer with the most enduring legacy is Antonín Dvořák (1841-1904) who, like Tchaikovsky, drew on a variety of influences outside his home country. However, he did compose an operatic rendition of a Slavic folktale called Rusalka (1901), which features one of the most hypnotically beautiful arias you’ll ever hear."
