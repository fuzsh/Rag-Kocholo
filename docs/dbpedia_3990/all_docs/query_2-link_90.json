In the Eastern bloc the Satellites are in varying degrees largely dependent for their abrasives on the West, and the USSR also relies chiefly on the West for specialized abrasive products. Restrictions on the movement of abrasives from West to East, particularly from North America, have probably accelerated the efforts of the Eastern bloc toward self- sufficiency, which may be expected in less than 5 years. The abrasives industry, although physically small, is strategically important, Modern warfare depends for its weapons on an efficient machine industry that is in turn dependent on abrasive products to insure mass precision production. Moreover, since North America, Western Europe, and the Soviet bloc must each in varying degrees import abrasives and abrasive products, the abrasives industry would be of critical importance during a period of global warfare or other emergency. The term \"abrasive\"' includes a multitude of products -- any sub- stance used to rub off, smooth, wear down, or polish. Abrasives may be hard or soft, coarse or fine; they may consist of pure elements or be complex inorganic compounds; they may be natural substances or artificial, manufactured materials. It is, for the most part, the artificial abrasives -- hard substances formed in electric furnaces at temperatures measured in thousands of degrees -- and the products manufactured therefrom that dominate the field of high-grade abra- sives. Natural abrasives, except for diamonds and corundum, play only a minor role in machine operations. Artificial abrasives may be classified into (a) crude, in the form of large lumps, and (b) grain and powders. The production of crude abrasives is a primary activity of those plants producing fused SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 SECRET aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, or boron carbide in electric furnaces.1 The crude abrasives industry is concentrated in a few plants, estimated at 39. Grain and powders are obtained by crushing the crude lumps produced in the furnaces and by grading the crushed material according to size of particles into grain, powders, and micro (powder of rigidly controlled grit sizes). Abrasive products may be classified into bonded products -- wheels, sticks, segments, and the like -- bonded together with materials such as ceramics, resin, rubber, and shellac; coated products made of cloth or paper; and polishing powders. Since coated products and powders are readily produced in all countries, they are of little importance in a strategic study. Bonded products, however, are not so easily manufactured. The process of bonding the abrasive grain together in the form of wheels requires a high degree of technical skill and is the most important end product of the industry. Only a few firms in the world are capable of manu- facturing with high precision the myriad products with differing specifications for size, type, bonding, and grain required by the machine industries. Because there are so few plants engaged in the manufacture of bonded abrasives, and even fewer which develop a high-quality product, their continuous operation is thereby rendered increasingly important in sustaining a flow of war materials. 2. World Production. a. Artificial Abrasives. Artificial abrasives constitute 80 to 85 percent of world production of the abrasives industry. Virtually all of the output 1. About 56 percent of the silicon carbide and 97 percent of the aluminum oxide are used to make abrasive products. The balance is utilized in producing special refractory by-products which are used in high-temperature furnace linings, cement, crucibles, and electrical resistors. Less than 0.03 percent of all crude abrasives produced is boron carbide, which is used for special polishing powders and abrasive-resistant products. -2- SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 - SECRET of artificial abrasives consists of two substances: fused aluminum oxide and silicon, carbide. (For an .estimate of world production of these two commodities, see Table 1, Appendix II.) About 60 percent of the crude abrasives is used in the produc- tion of bonded products, which consist largely of wheels.1 The other 40 percent is used in products which, with the exception of powders for polishing and obtaining highest precision, have little strategic significance in the abrasives industry. Precise statistics on the out- put of wheels are not available from most countries, not even from the country with the largest production- -the US. However, world production of wheels may bye computed by taking the 1949 world pro- duction of crude abrasives, 311,100 short tons (see Table 1, Appendix II), multiplying this by 60 percent, the proportion of crude used for the production of wheels, and adding 16 percent for the weight of the bonding materials (rubber, resinoid, etc.). By this reasonably accurate computation, inasmuch as processing methods are similar the world over, total global production of wheels in 1949 may be estimated at about 223,000 short tons. The US and Canada produce about half of thistotal of wheels. The USSR is the world's next largest producer, and, of other Soviet bloc countries, Czechoslo.Arakia and East Germany have sizable out- puts, and Hungary has a small production. Producing countries of Western Europe in order of importance are the UK, France, Western Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and Austria. The only other countries of any importance that produce wheels are Japan and Australia, and output in both is relatively small. b. Natural Abrasives. Corundum is used in a few special operations where its tough- ness and shape of crystals give better results than the artificial abrasives. Although deposits are widespread over the earth's crust, the cost of production is high in most places, and exploitation, 1. Since a veryTarge percentage of bonded products consists of wheels, bonded products plants are also designated as wheel plants. -3- SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 SECRET accordingly, is quite limited, Corundum is produced in substantial amounts only in the USSR and in the Union of South Africa. Produc- tion in the former is estimated to be about 10,000 short tons annually; in the latter, about 3,000 tons. Diamonds, because of their high cost and scarcity, are used only where extreme hardness not attainable in other abrasives is required. World production of industrial diamonds has in the post- war period averaged around 7.5 to 8.5 million carats per year. Of this total, about 80 to 85 percent is crushing bort, the particular form of diamond used in the production of abrasive products. The source for diamond crushing bort is primarily the Belgian Congo, and production and export are under the authority of the Diamond Corporation, an English syndicate that controls about 95 percent of the world production of diamonds. About 65 percent of the world production of diamond crushing bort in postwar years has been shipped to the US for processing. Diamond wheels are a special product requiring a technique different from that for regular grind- ing wheels and are produced in separate plants in the US, the UK, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, and possibly the USSR. 3. North America. a. Survey of Production. The US-Canadian abrasives industryl far exceeds the rest of the world in output, both in quantity and in quality of product. About two-thirds of the world production of crude abrasives (see Table 1, Appendix II) and one half of the world production of wheels come from North American plants. It should not be in- f erred, however, that the industry is a large one by US standards. 1. Much of this section has been taken from a confidential report, Abrasives dustr Survey, prepared for the Abrasives Section, Production Division, National Security Resources Board, 1949, by R. Kirkpatrick and W.T. Montague. -4- SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Releaee 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T0093GA000100040001-9 SECRET On the contrary, at the primar level, the production of crude abra- sives, the industry consists of but 13 plants concentrated in 6 areas for the most part near the vAterfalls of the Niagara and the lower St. Lawrence tributaries, and, at the secondary level, the production of wheels, three-quarters of the production capacity is grouped at three places -- the Niagara Falls area; Worcester, Massachusetts; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Though the North American abrasives industry is largely in the hands of US owners, 85 to 90 percent of crude abrasives comes from Canada. Accessibility to large quantities of cheap electric power is a primary factor in the crude abrasives industry, a fact which accounts for the concentration of this industry in Canada. Much of the crude abrasives produced in Canada is brought to the US for crushing and prot;essing to various sizes and quality of grain and powders. In 193, when output was at a peak of 284,073 short tans (see Table 2, Appendix II), practically the full capacity of the US- Canadian crude abrasives industry was employed. Capacity was increased during the postwar years and in 1048 reached 332,492 short tons (see Table 3, Appendix II), as compared with an actual output of 219,200 tons (see footnote b, Table 1, Appendix II). As most of the idle capacity is in aluminum oxide facilities, no increase is planned for this commodity. The capacity for silicon carbide, however, is being enlarged and probably reached about 106,000 short tons by the end of 1950. This expansion would increase the total capacity for the US-Canadian crude abrasives industry to 356,500 short tons, considerably more than the peak annual pro- duction of 284,073 tons during the war. Further expansion of pro- duction could be achieved rapidly in an emergency. The wheel industry in North America is almost entirely in the US. Annual production in recent years has been about 120,000 short tons. US wheels are of unsurpassed quality, a matter of paramount importance to both domestic and foreign consumers. Manufacturers of wheels in Western Europe, although often able -5- SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : ,CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T0099y35A000100040001-9 SECRET to produce sufficient quantities, usually lack the ability to produce both the, variety and quality of products needed. The range of US products, both by type and by size, is greater than in any other country. As in the case of crude abrasives, US production of wheels also is below capacity, but output could be doubled in a short time. b. Dependence on ExternaSources. North American industry has a high degree of self-sufficiency with respect to abrasives and abrasive products. The machine in- dustries are supplied with US and Canadian products almost exclusive- ly, and the producers of wheels use abrasive grain made in the US and Canada. Only at the initial stage of acquiring raw materials is there any significant importing, limited mainly to three strategic commodi- ties:. bauxite, corundum, and diamond crushing bort. The other raw materials, such as petroleum coke and silica sand, which are used in the production of abrasives are obtained from domestic sources ex- cept for small quantities of such items as rubber and shellac. Bauxite ore is the material purchased from abroad in largest amounts for the abrasives industry,: being imported from British and Dutch Guiana.. During the war, however, with shipping at a premium, the industry was able to meet rapidly expanding require- ments without resort to extensive imports of bauxite ore. The primary sources of supply were several localities in the US which, if necessary, could again adequately serve the needs of the North American abrasives industry. Since the war, imports from the Guianas have been stepped up sharply (bee Table 4, Appendix II), notwithstanding large workable deposits in the US. The shift in sources is due to postwar improvement in availability of shipping .and the comparatively higher quality and lower price of Guiana bauxite. . Virtually all corundum ore used in North America comes from the Union of South Africa (see Table 5, Appendix II). If this supply were interfered with, some corundum could be pro- duced in Canada, but at greatly increased costs, and at best it would be insufficient. Failing this, corundum could be replaced SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T009 m7 4000100040001-9 SECRET entirely with artificial abrasives, but only with additional technical work and at the price of efficiency, since to a considerable- extent artificial abrasives are not suitable substitutes. Corundum produc- tion in the Union of South Africa, now at full capacity, scarcely meets present North American requirements and probably could not be expanded rapidly enough to supply wartime needs. The third commodity which the US and Canadian abrasives industry must obtain from foreign sources is diamond crushing bort. The southern part of Africa is the only important source, the Belgian Congo being the principal center of production. Less than 2 percent of US imports of diamond crushing bort comes from countries of the Western Hemisphere -- Brazil, Venezuela, and British Guiana, in particular. Total US imports of diamond fragments used for crushing bort, powders, and dust increased from an annual average of 1,527,000 carats in 1935-39 to a peak of 10,445,000 carats in 1944 and fell again to a postwar low of 3,233,000 carats in 1947. The heavy war requirements were met only because, in addition to regular supplies from the Belgian Congo, stocks had accumulated prior to Pearl Harbor in the hands of the Diamond Corporation. Now the situation differs: present inventories are low. Diamond crushing bort is not readily obtainable for current industrial requirements, as present world demand is in excess of production capacity. Nor could require- ments ever be entirely satisfied through substitutes. In time of war, as occurred in 1944, North American demand for diamond crushing bort would be several times greater than at present.. In the event of war or other emergency, there would probably be no insurmountable problems in North America re- garding artificial abrasives. It should be pointed out, however, that the small number of primary plants and their hydroelectric sources are concentrated in a few areas in Canada which makes them particularly vulnerable. Moreover, North America could not hope to import substantial quantities of abrasives, since the other producing countries of the West depend considerably on the few North American plants. However, barring destruction of facilities, production in North America could keep up with -7- SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T009935A000100040001-9 1%W ,w SECRET expanding domestic requirements and at the same time continue to supply allies in need. 4. Western Europe, g. Survey of Production. With access to exports from North America, there are no critical shortages of abrasives in Western Europe at the present time. About 40 percent of the requirements of Western Europe for crude abrasives and abrasive grain, as well as a small but im- portant percentage (about 2 percent) of its requirements for wheels, are imported. The foreign sources of artificial abrasives for Western Europe are the US and Canada. For natural abrasives, corundum and diamond crushing bort, Western Europe depends on the southern part of Africa, the corundum ore being: processed in the USa That all of the abrasive products required in Western Europe are not, produced within the area is largely a matter of technical incompetence. The greater skills and more advanced knowledge of North American producers cannot be matched except in a few instances, One plant in Norway, for example, the only one outside the US with a sizable export of silicon carbide, makes a high- quality product. French white aluminum oxide, well-known through- out Europe under the trade name of Crystalba, also is of the best quality and in normal times is marketed widely. US subsidiaries producing wheels in the UK turn out products almost comparable with those of the parent corporations, and Swedish wheels are like wise of unusually high quality. As in North America, production of crude abrasives in Western Europe is concentrated in a few plants, estimated at 19, one of which is in the UK. Seven more plants, all in the UK, crush and grade crude abrasives imported from Canada and the US, In West Germary the crude abrasives industry consists of five plants with a combined capacity of 37,000 short tons (production in 1949 was 21,000 tons), and in France five plants produced 22,000 short tons of crude - 8 - SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T0094000100040001-9 SECRET abrasives in the. fiscal year 1948-49. The remainder of the crude abrasives industry in Western Europe is rather widely scattered. (The distribution of the plants and the estimated capacities for each of the countries is given. in Table 6, Appendix II. Output in West Germany has probably been increased since mid-1949, so that unused capacity by now is doubtless smaller than the table indicates.) A small. amount of expansion is occurring within the crude abrasives industry in Western Europe. The Austrians. are expanding capacity, with the hope of attaining self-sufficiency in the production of abrasive grain. The French plan to double their capacity of silicon carbide to 600 short tons by 1951 and are building a new aluminum oxide plant. In West Germany, where production of crude abrasives is well under capacity, the restoration of output can be' expected to increase with the expansion of Western European arms production. Every country in Western Europe has at least a small output of wheels., and its wheel industry is considerably more fragmented than the crude. It is impossible to estimate the production capacities for most individual plants or even for many countries. Data on the number of wheel plants per country are available but in some cases are incomplete. The greatest production comes from the UK, where 16 wheel plants turn out abrasive products. Statistics for West Germany indicate the existence of 38 wheel plants, with a combined capacity of 21,600 short tons, although production by June 1950 had risen only to an annual rate of 8,000 tons. The 17 wheel plants in France provide that country's requirements for wheels except for a few. special types. Production of wheels in each of the remaining Western European countries varies from moderate. to minor importance. Plans for new construction'in the wheel industry in Western Europe have not been disclosed, but little expansion of capacity can be expected. However, in West Germany there is some unused capacity available. b. Dependence on North America. Since Canadian crude abrasives are so inexpensive- and 'US wheels so superior in quality and variety, Western European traffic -9 - SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79TOO935A000100040001-9 SECRET with North America in abrasives has been and will continue to be wholly one-way. The greater part of this traffic is made up of crude abrasives and abrasive grain. Of artificial abrasives cure rently being used in Western Europe, about 40 percent was imported from North America. US and Canadian exports of crude abrasives and abrasive grain in 1949 were nearly 50,000 short tons, or about 20 percent of production. More than half of these exports went to. the UK, and most of the remainder was imported by other Western .European countries (see Table 7, Appendix II). Though there is some trade among Western European countries in crude abrasives and abrasive grain, chiefly Norwegian silicon carbide, French aluminum oxide, and West German crude and grain, the quantity is small in relation to total imports from North America. Imports of raw materials for the production of crude abrasives in Western Europe are not large. Deposits of bauxite are found in France, Greece, the Netherlands, Italy, and Yugoslavia, and also small quantities in the UK. Some petroleum coke is imported into Norway from the US. The machine industries, of Western Europe purchase most of their abrasive products, including wheels, from domestic firms. However, imports of wheels from the US, although only about 2 percent of requirements, include special types and sizes for high precision work that are not produced elsewhere. Even in the three countries in the area the UK, France, and West Germany whose output of wheels substantially covers domestic requirements, there is some need for a continuing supply of special US items. However, the heavy postwar exports of wheels from the US to Western Europe have fallen off, as West Germany is now resuming full pro- duction and turning out sufficient quantities of wheels to provide an. ample surplus for export (see Table 8, Appendix II). In the event of a peripheral war of limited action against one or more Satellite countries, Western Europe would not be greatly affected regarding abrasives. Although the loss of such countries as Finland, Yugoslavia, or Greece would have little significance in production, the loss of West Germany would neces?- sitate increased importing from the US. Should widespread destruction. of Western European abrasive plants occur in a global SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T009_4000100040001-9 i SECRET war, the US-Canadian abrasives industry would be hard-pressed to replace simultaneously most of the productive capacity of the UK, West Germany, and France. Should Western Europe be overrun, destruction of its abrasives industry would be advantageous to the US, since the combined Soviet-Satellite production is already in- sufficient for the needs of the Soviet bloc and will most likely continue so for several years. This shortage in Eastern Europe, in addition to certain special products required in Western Europe which the Soviet industry does.not ordinarily manufacture, would preclude the Soviet orbit from effectively supplying Western Europe with abrasives required for production of war materials. 5. Eastern Europe. a. Survey of Production. Only three countries in Eastern Europe have a substantial production of abrasives-and abrasive products: the. USSR, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia. USSR production in 1949. consisted of. about 40,00.0 .short tons of abrasives, of which about 10,000 tons were corundum and the remainder artificial abrasives) (see Table 1, Appendix II). This output exceeds that of any other European nation but is only about. 18 percent of the US-Canadian output. In the USSR there..ar.e known to be four furnace plants producing aluminum oxide and silicon carbide and two plants processing corundum from indigenous deposits, and more such. plants may actually be in opera- tion. The USSR also is probably the largest producer of wheels in Europe, the output coming from at least six plants. Production, .however, is perhaps only one-fourth that of the US and. Canada. com- bined. Postwar reports of new products and of elementary improve- ments in production methods indicate that in many respects the Soviet 1. This estimate is based on 1939 production figures, which have been revised upward in accordance with reported changes in individual plant capacities and reported percentage increases in nation-wide production.

Further more, Soviet use of. many different types of grinding. machines, built in numerous countries, requires a wide, assortment of abrasive products to fit the machines, and the Soviet industry is particularly deficient in variety of products. In order to reduce the large number of types and sizes of wheels needed, the machines are being adapted to certain standards. The Soviets also have developed electrolytic methods of grinding and tool-sharpening that appear to have some merit and that reduce the need for wheels, especially diamond wheels. How- ever, the fact that since 1946 the USSR has not sought to import any diamond wheels from the US indicates that the USSR is producing diamond wheels. In East Germany the production of abrasives is represented largely by one plant with a sizable output of crude abrasives (about 10,000 short tons annually but with high production costs). Czech production of aluminum. oxide, of much lower quality than prewar, is estimated at 6,500 short tons for 1949. Czechoslovakia is the other large producer of wheels in the Soviet bloc, and the only Satellite with much to export, most of the wheels going to the Soviet Union. The trend of production of abrasives and abrasive products in the Soviet bloc is upward. Although East German production has fallen off as a result of Soviet control, primarily because of dis- mantling of plants, output in the USSR proper has risen in the postwar period, and will continue to do so. Moreover, primary plant capacity for the production of crude abrasives is being expanded in Czecho- slovakia and initiated in Hungary and Poland. b. Dependence on External Sources. The major raw materials used in the abrasives industry are found in Eastern Europe, but deposits of corundum ore may possibly be running low, larger deposits having been used up before the war. Silica sand and petroleum coke are both indigenous to the area, and bauxite of abrasive grades is mined in the USSR and Hungary. Very few diamonds are mined in Eastern Europe, but there is doubt whether Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T009i,,4000100040001-9 SECRET diamond wheels are used as extensively in the Soviet bloc as they are in the West. The production of abrasives and abrasive products by the Soviet bloc has increased at an even faster pace than consumption. Imports by the USSR from the West are confined mainly to specialized abrasive products such as silicon carbide grain and powders in critical sizes and high-precision types of wheels which the USSR has not yet been able to produce. The wheels are mainly rubber bonded types used in ball- and roller-bearing production. The Satellites, on the other hand, are largely dependent on the West, for abrasives. All evidence indicates that the USSR has no surpltis of abrasive products to supply its allies. The US and Norway were the primary sources of supply of silicon carbide for Czechoslovakia and East Germany, and it has been increasingly difficult for them to obtain their requirements (approximately 3,000 short tons per year in the case of Czechoslovakia), because of US export controls and the Norwegian system of allocating exports in accordance with prewar trade patterns. Norwegian allocations have been far less than the quantities sought by the Soviets in trade negotiations. White aluminum oxide also is purchased by Czech industries from the UK and France, the latter supplying the well- known Crystalba, procurable only in small quantities since the war. Canada also has sold some crude abrasives to Czechoslovakia. Polish requirements for abrasives, all of which must be imported, are from 500 to 1,000 short tons annually. The Polish-Swiss trade agreement for 1949-50 provided for Swiss exports to Poland of 300 short tons of silicon carbide. Presumably much of the balance of Poland's abrasives requirements is procured from Czechoslovakia. Hungary must import her entire requirement of abrasive grain. Requirements of Rumania and Bulgaria are quite small and, except for the most elementary items, must all be imported. US and Canadian export controls on abrasive items have! made it.difficult for the Soviet bloc to obtain sufficient silicon carbide and -13- SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T005A000100040001-9 SECRET certain types of wheels. Other abrasives and abrasive products, however, are readily available from Western European producers and have generally replaced US products, although some firms in Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Austria, among others, have been re-exporting US products. Adequate information on exports of abrasives from the West to the Soviet bloc is lacking. However, it is known that the USSR, in addition to importing Norwegian silicon carbide, has imported wheels from Switzerland. Wheels also have been supplied to the USSR in smaller quantities by other Western European exporters. At least 300 tons of Austrian wheels went to Eastern Europe in 1949. In the event that war or other emergency should cut off Western European abrasive exports, the Satellite machine industry, particularly in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, and Poland, would probably be disrupted, at least for several months. There would be no alternative source which could supply the necessary products until Soviet production could be expanded. It appears probable, however, that in less than .5 years, the Soviet bloc could become completely self-sufficient in abrasives except for indus- trial diamonds. Attainment of this objective would be delayed some-, what by the necessity of producing efficient abrasives-manufacturing equipment which the USSR has been trying to import. Other problems in attaining self-sufficiency would be the manufacture of special abrasive products which the Soviet engineers are not yet competent to make. - 14 - SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 SECRET APPENDIX I COUNTRY STUDIES 1. Western Europe. a. Austria. In prewar years Austria did not produce abrasive grain but relied chiefly on Germany. Since World War II it has been the policy of the Austrian government to make the country self-sufficient in abrasives. In 1946 an aluminum oxide plant with a capacity of 19500 short tons was established in a chemical works at Seebach-bei-Villach in Carinthia. Recently another plant with a 200--ton capacity was built by the leading Austrian producer of wheels. Both of these plants, however, cannot meet requirements of the well-established Austrian wheel industry, so that there is still a reliance on imports of aluminum oxide. Although there is as yet no domestic production of silicon car-, bide, a plant is expected soon. There are five plants producing wheels, three of the largest having a combined capacity of 39000 to 4,000 metric tons. A considerable export business has developed between Austria and countries of the Eastern bloc. In 1949, about 300 metric tons of wheels destined for Eastern Europe were officially reported but were not all Austrian, being largely re-exports manufactured elsewhere in the West. b. Belgium. Abrasive grain is not produced in Belgium, but one large plant and six small plants produce wheels of the rough and snagging types, used principally in foundries. Annual output is about 900 metric tons, Belgian imports of bonded products in 1949 totaled 442 tons; exports, 280 tons. 15 SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79TO09 4000100040001-9 I\" SECRET c. Denmark. Abrasive grain is not produced in, Denmark, but two small plants produce wheels for domestic machine industries. Imports in 1948 were 400 metric tons of abrasive grain and 360 metric tons of wheels and stones. Principal suppliers were Sweden, Czechoslovakia, the UK, and Norway. d. Finland. Finland's requirements of high-quality: abrasives are small, and only ordinary wheels of -non-.precision -type are produced,. Imports in 1947 included approximately 200 metric tons of wheels and 360 metric tons of abrasive grain. Principal suppliers, in order of importance, were the UK, the: US,. Sweden, Norway, Denmark, France, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Switzerland, and Canada. A large percentage of the wheels required by Finland is used in the production of wood pulp. e. France. The French crude abrasives industry, with a capacity ex- ceeding 22,000 metric tons, is second only to the West German industry in output. Three plants, with a combined capacity of 15,000 short tons,, produce regular-aluminum oxide; another plant, with a capacity of 4,000 tons, produces white aluminum oxide;; and still another plant, with a capacity of 3,000 tons, produces silicon carbide. Annual production statistics:' are not available, but it is known that a shortage of electric power has curtailed production somewhat in the postwar period. French white alumi- num oxide, well-known throughout Europe under the trade name of Crystalba, is of the highest quality. Formerly, 50 percent of production was exported, and at present, even with limited pro- duction, some exports are maintained to.keep contact with former markets. The principal importers -are- Switzerland, the UK, the Benelux countries, Norway, Italy, and Sweden. Czechoslovakia is the only country outside Western Europe with -sizable imports of Crystalba. Some abrasive grades of bauxite, of which the SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 \"01 A4W Marseilles area has the best in Europe, also are exported. Production capacity for aluminum oxide is being considerably increased by the addition of a new plant under construction. Although the French must still import most of their requirements of silicon carbide, present plans for doubling production of domestic silicon carbide by 1951 wild alleviate this shortage. Some boron carbide also is produced. The wheel industry in France consists of 17 plants. Except for a few special types, production takes care of domestic requirements. Production in 1949 probably exceeded 12,000 metric tons. Aside from the products of the sole US-owned plant, the quality of wheels is only average. Small quantities of white aluminum oxide wheels are ex- ported, but most wheels are sold to domestic machine industries. f. Germany, West. In prewar years Germany ranked first in Europe as a producer and exporter of abrasives, and the substantial rate of output was nearly doubled during the war. In 1943, about 58,000 short tons of abrasive grain, of which 46,000 tons were aluminum oxide and 12,000 silicon carbide, were produced by nine plants. After the postwar division into zones of occupation the German abrasives industry was about equally divided between West and East Germany. That portion of the industry remaining in West Germany is quite extensive, five crude abrasives plants being located in the territory at the time of division. The capacity for the production of aluminum oxide is estimated at 28,800 short tons, and that of silicon carbide at 7,800 short tons. Output was quite low until 1949, a symptom of the disruption of the economy. In 1950, however, thenv was a remarkable increase in production, and German abrasive products are again appearing in world markets. Output is now only slightly below prewar, current annual production being estimated at 15,000 tons of aluminum oxide and 6,000 tons of silicon carbide. There also is one plant producing boron carbide in grades suitable for honing and polishing. The rate of production is approximately 8 short tons annually, about half the US rate. - 17 - SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T0094000100040001-9 SECRET In acquisition of wheel plants West Germany fared is little better. Of Germany's peak wartime production of wheels, 36;,000 metric tons in 1943, only 40 percent came from territory now in the Soviet. Zone. In. West Germany there are 47 wheel plants, the combined output of which had recovered by the end of 1949 to 6,900 tons. Production in June 1950 had risen to an annual rate of 8,000 tons. Furthermore, as armament production in Western :Europe increases, production of abrasives in West Germany can be expected to keep pace. Because total capacity of the industry, 27,000 metric tons, is well above present output, a good deal of slack can be utilized whenever the demand increases. The quality of production in West Germany is at present: below standards. Most raw materials -must be imported. Materials from East Germany are no longer available. Furthermore, some postwar disorganization and inadequate technical control still impair production. With increasing production, West German.exports have risen. It is estimated that exports of abrasive grain in 1950 will. reach 2,400 short tons of silicon carbide and.4,800 short tons of aluminum oxide. Exports of wheels are expected to be about 800 metric tons, or. 10 percent. of production. Shipments of crude abrasives and wheels go to both Eastern and Western European countries. While quality is inferior to US and UK products, prices are much lower. Regular and white aluminum oxide and silicon carbide have been offered in Sweden at about 40 percent below US-delivered prices, and wheels in Switzerland at considerably below US and UK prices. Were it not for export controls, the West German industry would once more be a principal supplier of abrasives to Eastern Europe. g. Italy. The Italian crude abrasives industry consists of one company that has two plants producing abrasive grain. Production capacity is 8,840 short tons, of which 8,000 is for aluminum oxide and 840 for silicon carbide. Production in 1948 was 4,800 tons of aluminum oxide and 510 tons of silicon carbide. Because the industry uses domestic bauxite of low grade, the quality of aluminum oxide produced -18- SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T0095A000100040001-9 SECRET is one of the poorest in the world. Italian boron carbide, produced by one-Chemical company, also is low-grade. There are eight wheel plants in Italy, the most important being a subsidiary of a US corporation. A wide range of types and sizes of wheels is produced, but, with a few exceptions, they are poor in quality. Italy is not self-sufficient in abrasives. Total imports of abrasive grain and products were 1,498 metric tons in 1948. A breakdown of import-export statistics is not available, but the principal imports of abrasives were 678 tons of abrasive grain and 96 tons of precision wheels from the, US. Other imports of abrasives come from Switzerland, Germany, and Czechoslovakia. Exports of abrasive grain and products .are small, totaling only 115 metric tons in 1948, 109 tons of which went to Yugoslavia. h. Netherlands. The importance of the Netherlands in world abrasives markets is in production of diamond abrasives, some of which are exported to the Soviet bloc as well as to Western countries. Abrasive grain is riot produced in the Netherlands, and there are only two small plants that produce wheels. The completion of a larger, more modern wheel plant was expected before the end of 19960, with import requirements of about 275 metric tons of abrasive grain annually. Currently, most wheels used by Dutch machine industries are imported. Imports in .1948 were 690 metric tons of wheels and 248 metric tons of abrasive grain, wheels being imported mainly from the US and the UK, and abrasive grain. from the US, Switzerland, and Norway. i Norw .. . The Norwegian abrasives industry is important only as a pro- ducer of high-quality silicon carbide. Norway's entire production, 8,000 short tons in 1949, a typical postwar year, comes from one US-owned plant. Norway is the only country, except the US and Canada, with a sizable surplus of silicon carbide, and ordinarily over 90 percent of the output is exported (see Table 9, Appendix II). .. 19 - SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T0094000100040001-9 I SECRET Since the imposition of export controls on US abrasives, the demand in Western and Eastern Europe for the Norwegian product has been heavier, and the industry has been forced to resort to some extent to allocation of exports in accordance with sales during previous years., in 1950, Norway ceased shipments entirely to the USSR and Czechoslovakia and allotted far less to Poland than was requested (see Table 9, Appendix II). In 1949 the production of three small Norwegian wheel plants was about 600 metric tons. The output consisted of most types of wheels,. and the quality was fair. In 1948, wheels were exported to France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and the USSR. l Por Portugal's requirements of high-quality abrasives are small. Two wheel plants-manufacture products only of the lowest type, suitable. for the blacksmith and hardware trades. Imports of 'wheels in 1948., mainly from the UK, totaled 96 metric tons. . Swain. Spain's requirements of high-quality abrasives are small. Three wheel plants, with a total capacity of about 1,000 metric tons,. produce vitrified wheels of poor quality. 1. Sweden. The Swedish crude abrasives industry consists of one plant, which in 1949 produced 1,200 short tons of silicon carbide and 2,000 short tons of aluminum oxide. A second plant once produced about 1,000 tons of aluminum oxide per year but discontinued operations in 1947 either because of a power shortage or because of unsats- factory reslults. The Swedish wheel industry turns out a product unexcelled anywhere in Europe or Asia. Only US wheels are on the whole superior to the Swedish product,. which is on a par with the British. - 20 - SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 :CIA-RDP79T009 5A000100040001-9 SECRET .Six plants, which provide over half of the nation's requirements, manufacture, wheels in a wide range of types and sizes, including rubber bonded. One plant also produces diamond wheels. Swedish imports of abrasives in 1949 included about 1,900 metric tons of aluminum oxide and silicon carbide and. 3.60 tons of wheels from the US, as well as 800 tons of silicon carbide from Norway. About 300 metric tons of wheels were exported in 1948. m. Switzerland_ The importance of Swiss abrasive products is in their high quality. Production of crude abrasives is limited to one silicon carbide plant with a capacity of 3,000 short tons. Its annual exports have recently averaged about 2,000 tons. The principal customers are. France, Italy, Austria, Denmark, West Germany, ' and the Satellite countries Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and East Germany. Although aluminum oxide has-been produced in experi- mental quantities by an aluminum company and also by a chemical concern, neither has marketed the product. There are six producers of wheels in Switzerland, only one of which has large capacity. Although their combined output is less than 1,000 metric tons of wheels annually, all major classes of wheels e)cept rubber bonded are produced. There also are three producers. of diamond wheels in Switzerland. Certain specialities, such as small precision wheels,. are comparable in quality to the best.US wheels, About 20 percent of Swiss production is exported, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands being the largest purchasers. Some 250 metric tons of wheels are imported annually by Switzerland from the US, West Germany, the UK, Czechoslovakia, and Belgium. About 1,500 tons of abrasive grain also are imported annually, the principal sources being the US, France, the UK, Norway, and West Germany. n. United Kingdom.

Although there...is..some..,domestic. production of white aluminum oxide, over 85. percent of.. the crude abrasives.: consumed in.British processing plants is imported from North America because of the lower. production costs, particularly in Canada, where electric power is cheap. However, in the case of the purest and highest- priced grade of white aluminum oxide, the factor of power rates is not of the same importance. Because of a shortage of electric power, production in the UK was discontinued during the war, and even now output is relatively small because demand is not great. As a rule, white aluminum. oxide accounts for something like 12 percent of the total UK consumption of crude abrasives. Boron carbide also is produced in. small amounts. Eighteen plants in. the UK manufacture wheels, the ones with the highest-quality. products and also the greatest output being US subsidiaries. The. products of these US-owned plants are comparable in quality, variety, and precision to US products and are generally superior to other European products with the exception of the Swedish. Most British abrasive products are used by domestic machine industries. For -example, of the 35,000 short tons of wheels and other abrasive products produced in 1948, only, 2,400 tons were exported. The UK also is an important producer of diamond wheels. 0. Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia has one small furnace for production of aluminum oxide and one wheel plant with a capacity of about 300 metric tons producing low-grade wheels. Annual requirements of abrasives are estimated to be 500 to 1,000 metric tons. Imports of abrasive grain in 1947 from the US and Norway totaled 220 tons; of wheels from the US, 135 tons. Good abrasive grades of bauxite are mined and exported to Western countries. 2. -Eastern Europe. a. Bulgaria.

Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was the first European country to produce abrasives. Early in the twentieth. century the Czechs built and operated abrasive furnace plants and abrasive products plants in Dresden, Germany, and in La Bathie, Savoie, France, and a wheel plant in Moscow. These plants, as well as.. one abrasives plant and two abrasive products plants within Czechoslovakia, were built by the United Carborundum and Electric Works of Benatky. In the years between the wars a Czech plant also produced carborundum but was dismantled by the Germans after they took over the Norwegian carborundum production. In 1947 the United Carborundum and Electric Works contracted with a leading US producer for the plans and specifications of an abrasive products plant with a capacity of 6,000 metric tons of wheels when operating on a single-shift and 15,000 metric tons on a three- shift basis. Erection of the plant proceeded very slowlydn 1948 and 1949, but inquiries sent out early in 1950 for the purchase of machinery indicate that the work is now progressing at a faster rate. Delays may have been due to lack of sufficient furnace capacity for raw material. In 1948. the Czechs erected a. plant for refining and grading crude silicon carbide. Imports of, silicon carbide from Norway since 1949 have all been of crude abrasives. The high cost of electric power probably makes it uneconomic to produce silicon carbide, but the refinery makes it possible to utilize cheap imported crude. In July 19.48 .the Czechs made inquiry in the US for plans for a silicon carbide furnace plant and a processing plant and for technical aid in the production of silicon carbide. They are probably considering producing their own requirements in spite of high costs. In 1948 they also were striving to regain possession of their Dresden abrasives plant, dismantled by the Soviets. - There is no production. of white aluminum oxide or silicon carbide in Czechoslovakia, but output of regular aluminum oxide - 23 - SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Relee(se 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T009A000100040001-9 SECRET grain in 1949 was about 6,500 short tons.

This new installation may almost triple1949 capacity. Because of limitations on exports of silicon carbide from the US and Norway, Czechoslovakia has been hard-pressed to obtain its annual requirements of 3,000 short tons. The Czech industry produces a wide variety of abrasive products. Wheels are, for the most,part, of the vitreous type. No rubber bonded wheels are produced; Reports indicate -'that postwar production is not so high in quality as prewar, one important: reason being that available bonding. materials lack the variety necessary for quality production. Also, many skilled workers have found em- ployment elsewhere. Furthermore, the bauxite, which is imported from Hungary, is not of the best abrasive grade, being high in iron content. Czechoslovakia is the only country in the Soviet bloc that has a surplus Of. abrasive products for export, and the USSR gets the largest share. Whereas exports to the .Balkans were large in 1948, they are no longer a. major factor in Balkan trade. Extorts to Italy have been bartered for'ball bearings. With long experience in the production of abrasives, the Czechs should be able to give valuable technical aid to other Satellite countries. c. Ger many, East. Of the three crude abrasives plants in East Germany before the war, the two most modern were almost completely dismantled by the Soviets. These two plants had. a combined wartime capacity of 5,600 short tons of aluminum oxide grain and 7,100 short tons of crude silicon carbide, equal to 12 percent and. 60 percent respectively, of German production. The large aluminum oxide plant not dismantled has a capacity of 15,000 tons and produces about 10,000'tons annually. This plant:'is.an old one, and production costs are high. One of the other plants has been partially re-equipped and is producing 1,200 to 1,800 tons of aluminum oxide-.

In 1950, production probably exceeded 3,500 tons. At the end of the war there were eight wheel plants of importa.:'ice in East Germany. Three of the largest and most modern, with a coin? bined capacity of 7,760 metric tons of wheels, or 22.5 percent of peak wartime German production, were completely dismantled. After dis- mantling, they were re-equipped at about 25 percent of their former capacity. Present wheel capacity in East Germany is about 4,600 metric tons, which is below requirements, and the plants operate at only about 85 percent of capacity, producing some 3,900 tons annually.. Silicon carbide for use in the plants must be imported. The quality of the wheels is poor as compared with that of the prewar period, do Hungary Although production of bauxite of abrasive grade in Hungary is large, there is no production of abrasive grain. The Five-Year Plan stated that an aluminum oxide plant, to be a part of the gigantic Alma.sfuzito alumina works, was to be started in 1950, In 1949 the Hungarian government negotiated with a German firm in Berlin for a number of electric furnaces with a capacity of 1,500 kilo-volt- amperes per furnace to be used in this plant. There are several wheel plants in Hungary, the largest of which. has a capacity of 300 metric tons per year. Catalogs indicate that a fairly complete assortment of wheels is produced. Some were exported to the Netherlands and Rumania in 1948. Annual Hungarian requirements for abrasive grain appear to be about 1,000 metric tons. The 1950 trade agreement with East Germany provides for imports of 500 metric tons of aluminum oxide grain and 10 tons of wheels, as well as unspecified amounts of silicon carbide.

Output of abrasive products in Rumania consists of stones and wheels of very inferior quality. The largest wheel plant has a capacity of, 48 metric tons. per year. Formerly,. US wheels were imported, but recent imports have come from East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Small quantities of abrasive grain also are imported. Annual. Rumanian requirements of abrasives are estimated at 200 to 300 metric tons. S. USSR. Information on the more important abrasives plants in the USSR isso-fragmentary that in most instances it has been impossible to make any summary of plant capacity, recent production, and quality. Those details which appear to be reasonably accurate follow. (1) Chelyabinsk Abrasives Combine, Chelyabinsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast. Plant construction at Chelyabinsk was started in 1932, and production capacity by 1936 was 6,000 metric tons of aluminum oxide and. 14,500 metric tons of wheels. In 1942 the number of furnaces for the production of. crude abrasives had been increased to six with a capacity of 10,000 tons of aluminum oxide. During the war, equipment from the Imeni Ilyich. Abrasives Plant and two small plants in Luga, Leningrad Oblast, were moved to Chelyabinsk. In May 1946 the plant's output of wheels was at an annual rate of 9,000 tons. Production in 1948 was 110 percent of \"planned\" value, but only 50 of the 148, items projected .were made. Raw material for the production of aluminum oxide is received from the Chelyabinsk bauxite processing plant. -26- SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00, 935A000100040001-9 w (2) Zaporozh'ye Carborundum Plant, Zaporozh'ye, Ukrainian SSR (also reported as Dnepropetrovsk). .AA4 electric furnace plant for silicon carbide was built at Zaporozh',ye in.1935-39 at a reported cost of 5.3 million rubles. A fair grade of silicon carbide reportedly was produced in 19369 though the plant was still under construction at the beginning of 1940. The fur- nace design. and. capacity of the prewar plant are:reported to have been the, same as the: Norwegian silicon carbide plant, which has a capacity of .8,000 metric. tons. The 2 porozh'ye plant was damaged during the war, and restoration was begun in 1946, The Soviet press in 1949 characterized it as, the- largest carborundum plant in the USSR. (3) Imeni Ilyich Abrasives Plant, Leningrad. This plant ranks with the Chelyabinsk Abrasives Combine as one of the two most important producers in the USSR. The plant was founded in.1930 and expanded in the 1932-37 period and again in 19.39. After the war, .construction was. started on a much larger scale on an entirely .new plant with new equipment, including a modern tun - nel kiln, and. building was still going on in 1949. Before the war, 3,000 workers were. employed, but employment in 1949 was slightly over 2,000. ..Prewar production included both aluminum oxide and sili con carbide, The 1934 production plan was 3,300 metric tons of aluminum oxide and 1,000 metric tons of silicon carbide grain. The new plant produces only aluminum oxide, at a rate of about 3,600 metric :tons a year. Wheel production in 1948 was 5,51:0 metric tons. The wheels produced-are mainly. vitreous bonded, some Bakelite bonded, and a few. rubber .bonded, but the quality and range of sizes and type-3 .ar.e still inadequate. In.. 1947, 20 to 30 percent of the wheels produced was rejected. In 190 this percentage was reduced through technical help received. from the Leningrad Experimental Abrasives Plant. Reports in 1948 and 1949 mention new developments in production that have been in use in the US for many years, such as. the introduction of titanium oxide as .apart of the furnace raw material in the production of aluminum oxide. Furthermore, improvements in the molding of wheels resulted in the saving of 30 to 40 percent of valuable corundum. A method of producing wheels of high porosity also was developed. -27- SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Relea%e 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T009 t &000100040001-9 SECRET Abrasive materials used by the plant include (a) black and green silicon carbide from the Tashkent Carborundum'Factory, (b) corundum from Semiz-Bugu, Karaganda Oblast, and from the Akmolinsk Oblast in Kazahk SSR, and (c) emery. (4) Tashkent Carborundum Plant, Tashkent, Uzbek SSR. In 1948, production at this electric furnace plant near Tashkent was about 6,000 metric tons of silicon carbide and 500 metric tons of white aluminum oxide. In 1946, production was started on small quantities of boron carbide and on very fine white alumi- num oxide powder known at the factory as micro powder. Earlier reports indicated that the USSR was in short supply of fine powdered abrasives for honing and finishing operations. The plant controls quartzite mines in the vicinity, and the Aktash corundum mines are located very near Tashkent:, mines in the Karaganda and Pavlodar Oblasts being a few miles north. Whether corundum is the raw material used in the production of white aluminum oxide is not known. The plant, which has four sets of electric furnaces (four furnaces per set), of which the last set was installed in 1947, requires about 30 metric tons of sulfuric acid and 700 metric tons of anthracite, local coal, and oil coke per month. (5) Kyshtym Graphite and Corundum Combine, Kyshtyrri Chelyabinsk Oblast. Plant construction at Kyshtym was started in 1.932, and production in 1936 was 6,000 metric tons of corundum and 4,000 metric tons of graphite. Corundum and bauxite mines are found in the vicinity of Kyshtym, and new deposits of corundum were dis- covered in 1944. A subsidiary plant is located at Techeriskoye (15 miles from Kyshtym). (6) Semiz-Bugu Corundum Processing Plant, Bayan-Aul, Pavlodar Oblast, Kazakh SSR. This plant processes corundum from mines in the vicinity of Pavlodar and Karaganda.

Corundum is shipped to the Imeni Ilyich.Abrasives Plant, Leningrad, and possibly to other plants. (7) Moscow Abrasives Plants, Moscow. Little is known about production of abrasives in the, Moscow area. A plant established many years ago in Moscow by the United Carborundu'm and Electric Works of Benatky, Czechoslovakia, pro- duced low-grade vitrified snagging, foundry, and hardware types. of wheels. One report states that a Moscow plant was extended and re - constructed in 1939. Another report states that the \"Balashikha\" plant produced 3 9000 metric tons of abrasive products in 1943. A recent report describes a small plant producing wheels and powd.ert under the name of Moscow Abrasives Plant. ($) Tashkent Abrasives Plant, Tashkent, Uzbek SSR. This plant produces abrasive products and uses raw material from the Tashkent Carborundum Plant located nearby. Products include a wide variety of vitreous and bakelite bonded wheels of aluminum oxide and silicon carbide, segments, sticks, coated products, and polishing and lapping boron carbide. Production in 1947 was 950 metric tons; about 5 percent of 1948 production was rejected because of weak bonding and incorrect balance of wheels (rejects after ship- ment are not included). In December 1948 the plant employed 440 persons, of whom about 330 were engaged in production. (9) Siberian Abrasives Plant, Khaita, Irkutsk Oblast. Wheels are the main product of this plant. The plant- is well-equipped, new machinery having arrived from Leningrad in 1946 and early 1947. Production in 1948 was 3,780 metric tons, and the plant employed 1,160 industrial and 400 nonindustrial workers. (10) Zlatoust (near Chelyabinsk), Chelyabinsk Oblast. Two.plants for abrasive products are located in Zlatoust.

Experiments were conducted in 1927 on the produc- tion of aluminum oxide. A recent report mentions wheel production. (11) Kras~el Abrasives Plant, Luga, Leningrad Oblast. This plant was probably dismantled during the war. A recent report states that it is producing abrasive lapping paste. (12) Other possible plants on which no recent or definite informa- tion is available are as follows: (a) Shuya Grinding Wheel Plant, Shuya, Ivanovo Oblast, Central Industrial Region. A plant for production of bonded and coated products, including rubber bonded wheels, was under construction at this loca- tion in 1940. (b) Khait Abrasives Plant, Khait, Garm Oblast, Tadzhik SSR. A new factory at this location may have produced emery wheels and other abrasives products in 1944. (c) Smychka Abrasives Plant, Luga, Leningrad Oblast. A wheel plant was removed from this location during the war. There is no information on its present status. 3. Far East. a. Australia. Crude abrasives are not produced in Australia, and abrasive grain is imported from the US, the UK, and Norway. Imports in 1949 included 1,470 short tons of abrasive grain and 36 short tons of wheels from the US, and 136 metric tons of silicon carbide from Norway. Imports from the UK were undoubtedly higher than from the US. Total. requirements might, therefore, exceed 3,000 short tons. -3t?- Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T0,,035A000100040001-9 SECRET b.. Indi India has a small wheel industry, but production costs are very high. In order to protect the industry, the import duty on wheels and segments was increased in 1949 from 80 to 100 percent ad valorem. c. Japan. Japan has 11 plants producing a good quality of green and black silicon carbide and poor-quality regular and white aluminum oxide. Production in 1949 was 1,500 metric tons of aluminum oxide, 800 metric tons of silicon carbide, and 6,000 metric tons of wheels, sufficient for present requirements, as compared with prewar production of 4,800 tons of abrasive grain and 8,400 tons of wheels. Peak production during.the war was 25,600 metric tons of abrasive grain and 24,000 metric tons of wheels. The. range of types and sizes of wheels pro- duced is,. however, very limited. During prewar years, Japan imported about 2,000 tons of abrasive grain from the US and Germany. Prewar imports of wheels were very small and included only a few special types and sizes. d. Korea. There is an aluminum oxide furnace plant in operation north of the 38th Parallel, but its output has not been determined. 4. Other Countries. In unindustrialized countries of Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, there. is practically no production of abrasives. The order of importance of these countries as importers of US abrasives is as follows: Argentina, India, Union of South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and Cuba. - 31- SECRET Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 Approved For Release 1999/09/27 : CIA-RDP79T00935A000100040001-9 SECRET APPENDIX II TABLES World Production of Aluminum Oxide and Silicon Carbide j/ 1949 Aluminum Silicon ShortT?ne e-, Carbide Total North America US and Canada ij) North America Total 125,900 125,9QQ 67,500 67,500 193,400 W , Western Europe (Fiscal Year 1948-49) 0 France 19,000 3,000 0 22,0 West Germany 15,000 6,000 21,000 Norway 8,000 8,C00 Italy 4,800 500 5,:00 UK 3, 600 - 3, E X00 Sweden 2,000 1,200 3,200 Switzerland 3, 000 3, 0700 Austria 1,500 - 1,.OO Western Europe T tal 45,900 21.700 67.600 , o Eastern Europe (Estimate) USSR 16,000 14000 30,9000 East Germany 10,000 1,300 11,:i00 Czechoslovakia 6, 500 - 6, )OO Eastern Europe tal T 32.50 , o Japan 1, 500 800 2, : 300 World Total 205.8800 105.300 311..L00 / Includes less than 100 tons of extremely hard boron carbide used mainly in the form of powders for special polishing operations and in molded form as nozzles to resist abrasion.
