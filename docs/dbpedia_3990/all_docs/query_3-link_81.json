Despite a rail strike lasting several days, around 140,000 visitors from all branches of trade and sales channels were inspired by a wealth of trends and innovations at the biggest event in the history of Messe Frankfurt. As the most international networking and ordering platform, the industry's one-stop shop with over 170 participating countries and regions provided orientation, inspiration and solutions to current challenges in the market.\n\n15 Jan 2024\n\n10 years of Nordstil: Strong start into the anniversary season\n\nA large number of exhibitors and visitors, a wealth of new products for the coming seasons and a good ordering mood characterised the anniversary edition of Winter Nordstil: 752 exhibitors from Germany and abroad met around 13,500 buyers [1] who were inspired by product worlds of new quality and variety.

The response from international buyers to the quality and variety of the new Carpets & Rugs product segment was overwhelming. In numerous talks, tours and workshops, Heimtextil as well focused on two of the most important key topics of the coming decades: sustainable production and action as well as artificial intelligence. At the leading trade fair for home and contract textiles, transformations could be experienced more intensively than ever before.\n\n5 Dec 2023\n\nBetter, cheaper, more versatile: new rigging options in Hall 8 at Messe Frankfurt\n\nIn collaboration with its service partner UEBERKOPF, Messe Frankfurt has installed a new rigging substructure in the 30,000 square metre in Hall 8. The truss grid will enable exhibitors' rigging requirements to be realised more easily, quickly and cost-effectively in future. Another advantage is the reduction of the changeover time between the events in Hall 8.. This ensures greater flexibility in Messe Frankfurt's busy event calendar.\n\n30 Nov 2023\n\nMesse Frankfurt raises the bar for growth\n\nMesse Frankfurt has left the difficult and demanding last three years behind it and is now enjoying both qualitative and quantitative growth in Germany and abroad. By the end of financial year 2023, approximately 340 events will have been held worldwide under the Messe Frankfurt Group umbrella, with more than 84,000 exhibitors and an estimated four million visitors. After a strong core business in 2023 with sales in excess of €600 million, the company is planning further growth in 2024 – a year in which a relatively high number of events are scheduled – and expects sales to be comparable with the previous record year 2019. Messe Frankfurt will increase its international competitiveness by investing in its worldwide core business, modern technology and sustainable event management.\n\n25 Oct 2023\n\nIMPACT FESTIVAL 2024 to be held on Frankfurt exhibition grounds\n\nThe fourth edition of the IMPACT FESTIVAL is to be held on the Messe Frankfurt exhibition grounds between 30 and 31 October 2024, marking another successful acquisition for the Messe Frankfurt group.

Through business processes that are strictly geared towards customers, through global Group standards and through the fast and secure availability of knowledge about customers and markets, Messe Frankfurt is increasing the Group’s internal management efficiency and further expanding the benefits it offers exhibitors, visitors and guest organisers. At the same time, the company is laying the foundations for additional data-based B2B marketing services that are provided all year round.\n\n24 Jul 2023\n\nCollaborative, business-building, profitable: Summer Nordstil is a fixed order date in the North\n\nIt is the hub in the north: The industry met again in Hamburg for this year's Sommer Nordstil from 22 to 24 July.

Around 340 events are being held under the Messe Frankfurt umbrella in 2023. After a very dynamic first six months, projections for the second half of the year are also good. The Group is able to operate at full force largely thanks to the decision by top management not to lay off any staff during the three-year crisis period. With investments in its core business and digital transformation and a strong focus on sustainability, Messe Frankfurt is continuing to optimise its long-term corporate strategy.\n\n29 Jun 2023\n\nTexcare International 2024 with new day sequence Wednesday to Saturday\n\nThe leading trade fair for laundry, dry-cleaning and textile-services is reorganising itself anew.

Next year's new date is 6 to 9 November 2024.\n\n17 Mar 2023\n\nImpressive comeback of ISH 2023\n\nTangible solutions for achieving climate protection goals in the building sector were the focus of the ISH in Frankfurt am Main. The sanitary, heating and air-conditioning technology industry is pointing the way to a more sustainable future: decarbonisation, the use of renewable energies and greater energy efficiency are the order of the day. The leading international trade fair celebrates an impressive comeback and exceeds expectations.\n\n7 Feb 2023\n\nSensational comeback: Frankfurt consumer goods fairs set international benchmark\n\nThe leading international consumer goods fairs Ambiente, Christmasworld and Creativeworld have joined forces for the first time from February 3-4 to 7, 2023, to inspire as the global hub for upcoming lifestyle trends.

With 18,110 square metres in exhibition space, the hall now offers highly flexible options for all event formats. As well as this, Hall 5 has set a new record for exhibition space: the trade fair trio that opens its doors today is the largest ever Messe Frankfurt consumer goods event to be held at its Frankfurt base.\n\n26 Jan 2023\n\nMesse Frankfurt introduces internationally recognised environmental management system EMAS\n\nAs part of its ongoing sustainability campaign, Messe Frankfurt aims to obtain a certificate for the internationally recognised environmental management system EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) by the end of 2023. According to EMAS, this means that Messe Frankfurt will be the first company in the German trade fair sector to introduce this system.\n\n16 Jan 2023\n\nEnergetic start to the new business season - exuberant order joy dominates Winter Nordstil 2023\n\n14,500 visitors were delighted with the creative product worlds and original and modern approaches of the 720 exhibitors from Germany and abroad. On the trade visitor and exhibitor side, the order fair recorded very high satisfaction ratings. The Nordstil Forum provided valuable impulses on current topics such as sustainability and digitalisation. The retail trade in the north is thus well prepared for successful, sustainable business in the coming months.\n\n13 Jan 2023\n\nOutstanding start in January: Heimtextil 2023 ends with great internationality and sets the course for sustainable transformation\n\nStreams of visitors from all over the world, intensive business encounters with top international decision-makers, an overwhelmingly positive atmosphere and inspiration as far as the eye can see: With 44,000 visitors and 2,400 exhibitors together from 129 nations, the global textile industry was guest in Frankfurt for four days at Heimtextil 2023 and filled the exhibition halls. In numerous workshops, tours, lectures and networking formats, buyers also explored circular approaches, the important role of certificates and new applications for textile materials - and thus experienced wholly integrated sustainability at Heimtextil.\n\n9 Jan 2023\n\nMesse Frankfurt completes development of exhibition grounds\n\nThe Sparda-Bank Tower and the new Messeplatz entrance will be built on the exhibition grounds on Europa-Allee by 2025. This will create a new entrance in the south for the exhibition grounds, located directly at the future underground station in the Europaviertel. In addition to the construction of the new Hall 5, which will start operations in February, the realisation of the Messeplatz entrance, including a connection to the Via Mobile, is the last milestone in the modernisation of the exhibition grounds.

The innovation forum programme of conference, industry exhibition and networking was very well received by the experts in vertical-horizontal building mobility. 350 attendees and 40 exhibiting companies came to the second E2 Forum in Frankfurt am Main.\n\n17 Sep 2022\n\nA strong show: the international automotive aftermarket is back in Frankfurt\n\nThe turning point has been reached: Automechanika Frankfurt’s new formats and extensive programme were very well received by international automotive professionals. 78.000 visitors from 175 countries came to the industry’s leading platform in Frankfurt to experience products and services from workshops, industry and retail live and in person. In fact, these past five days are the fullest the exhibition grounds have been since the restart in Frankfurt.\n\n15 Sep 2022\n\nNextrade becomes nmedia.hub and combines its services with nmedia\n\nIn future, nmedia.hub (formerly Nextrade) will connect online orders from the order and content platform with the world of EDI orders from nmedia. This means that retailers and brands no longer have to differentiate between two platforms and can manage many of their daily tasks centrally in the nmedia.hub even more easily. Independent of the technical infrastructure of the retail partners.\n\n7 Sep 2022\n\nGood to know where it comes from: Messe Frankfurt obtains environmentally friendly solar power from the Uckermark region of Germany from Mainova AG\n\nMesse Frankfurt will continue to rely on a climate-neutral energy supply from 100 per cent green electricity. From 2024, Messe Frankfurt will obtain 30 per cent of its electricity requirements from the \"Boitzenburger Land\" solar park being built in the Uckermark region. To this end, it has concluded a corresponding Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Frankfurt-based energy service provider Mainova AG with a term of ten years.

Over the last two decades since its launch, Neonyt has developed into the most important B2B community platform for fashion, sustainability and innovation. The international fashion business is big, as is the responsibility of the event as an order platform and trend spotter in the sustainability sector, and the interest in the brand around the world. Messe Frankfurt has recognised the potential of Neonyt as a beacon and pioneer, and plans to roll out the event internationally. The next German edition of this B2B event will be held in Düsseldorf from 28 to 30 January 2023.\n\n25 Jul 2022\n\nGreat atmosphere and successful business – the summer Nordstil was the place-to-be for the industry in the north\n\nRefreshing lifestyle and trend products for the North on three hot summer days: With 640 exhibitors (1) and an inspiring outlook on the fall and winter business as well as on the upcoming Christmas season, Nordstil put its 8,000 visitors (2) in a buying mood.

We make a difference!” – these were two of the most important messages that the Neonyt Lab community took away after three colourful days of events under the motto “New Patterns” in the Union Halle in Frankfurt am Main. The premiere of the direct-to-consumer format as a great success: Neonyt Lab counts designers, activists, consumers and content creators as well as representatives from the fashion industry from 22 countries amongst its visitors.\n\n24 Jun 2022\n\nGlobal textile business back in Frankfurt: Techtextil, Texprocess and Heimtextil Summer Special close with strong international presence and high visitor satisfaction\n\nWith a total of 117 participating nations, around 63,000 visitors and 2300 exhibitors, a brilliant re-launch of the international textile fairs at the Frankfurt exhibition center was achieved. Across all three events - Techtextil, Texprocess and the one-time Heimtextil Summer Special - Italy, France, Turkey, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Poland, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Pakistan and the USA formed the top visitor nations. On all three business platforms, in addition to brisk order activity and high visitor quality and satisfaction, the concentrated positive energy of personal global encounters was particularly noticeable.\n\n24 May 2022\n\nIn 2022, Frankfurt is once again a favourite destination for the international event sector\n\nThe restrictions on holding events necessitated by the spread of COVID-19 were lifted at the beginning of April. Since then, it has been business as usual on the Messe Frankfurt exhibition grounds. 35 guest events with a total of 110,000 participants are taking place in May. While almost 70 percent of guest events had to be postponed or cancelled in 2021, around 140 trade fairs, congresses, concerts and other events are scheduled to be held in Messe Frankfurt locations in the second half of 2022. This is on a par with a normal six-month period before the last two challenging years.\n\n19 May 2022\n\nSuccessful and emotional: IFFA 2022 exceeds expectations\n\nThe global meat and protein industry seized every minute of IFFA from 14 to 19 May: for intensive networking, to see innovations and to do business. Sustainable production, automated processes and digitalisation in all areas of processing, packaging and sales characterized the range of products at the booths. The high interest in alternative proteins also showed the great future and growth potential of this market. Around 50,000 visitors from 129 countries travelled to Frankfurt am Main for the leading international trade fair IFFA – Technology for Meat and Alternative Proteins.\n\n5 May 2022\n\nMesse Frankfurt celebrates the 100th anniversary of its international sales partner network\n\nThis year, Messe Frankfurt looks back on 100 years of doing business through its international sales partners.

The health authorities operated on the assumption that, when people breathe, they emit potentially virus-infected aerosols in the same way they emit CO2 and that this would lead to widespread infections with SARS-CoV-2.\n\n9 Mar 2022\n\nCity prepared for deployment order from the state – first aid centre for Ukraine refugees at Messe Frankfurt\n\nMore and more people seeking protection from Ukraine are currently arriving in Frankfurt by train, bus, plane or private car. The city is the central contact point for refugees in Hesse. For days, those responsible have been preparing intensively to prevent a situation like the one in Berlin. A corresponding operational order from the state to the city's lower disaster control authority to create a first aid centre was issued on Wednesday.\n\n2 Mar 2022\n\nMusikmesse, Musikmesse Plaza and Musikmesse Festival not to be held in April 2022 – new event and festival concept being planned\n\nThe consumer trade fair formats Musikmesse Plaza and Musikmesse Festival will not be held in April 2022 owing to the current situation and the short lead time involved. Hygiene rules made planning very difficult above all for large-scale concerts by international artists, concerts in clubs and unusual locations, and music education events. The dramatic transformation in the instrument market, where over 70 percent of sales are now attributed to a small number of online retailers, has already had a very negative effect on the Musikmesse trade exhibition in recent years and is one of the factors driving the transformation from a B2B to a B2C event. In view of this, Messe Frankfurt will no longer be continuing the B2B part of the Musikmesse but instead will restructure music-related B2C formats at a later point in time.\n\n16 Feb 2022\n\nMesse Frankfurt realigns marketing services for customers\n\nMesse Frankfurt sees itself as a partner and advisor to the business sectors and offers its trade fairs and B2B events the event-related services needed for a successful corporate presence: from stand construction and catering to advertising opportunities. By structuring the new MFS Mediaservices department, the company is responding to its customers' growing need for high-reach marketing offers - on site and online.\n\n15 Feb 2022\n\nNextrade supports uncomplicated re-ordering\n\nFrankfurt am Main, 15 02 2022: Nextrade is the ideal digital order and data platform, especially for re-ordering, as the ordering process is easy and uncomplicated for suppliers, brands and retailers. After the major spring fairs, such as Ambiente, Christmasworld, Paperworld and Creativeworld, have not taken place because of Corona, brands and retailers still come together in the virtual space via Nextrade.\n\n10 Feb 2022\n\nUnder the motto \"Home of Consumer Goods\", Messe Frankfurt will offer the world's most innovative and comprehensive range of consumer goods from 2023 onwards\n\nMesse Frankfurt is actively fulfilling its mission to promote the economy by creating new platforms for the global consumer goods industry. As a first step, starting in February 2023, the three leading consumer goods trade fairs Ambiente, Christmasworld, and Creativeworld will be held simultaneously for the first time at the Frankfurt exhibition center from 3/4 to 7 February 2023. Under the new motto \"Home of Consumer Goods,\" the redesigned offering will provide a unique, comprehensive portfolio of products and solutions and actively leverage synergy effects for exhibitors, visitors and the media. In a second step, the Global Sourcing section of the three leading trade fairs will be merged into a joint offering and marketed internationally. This strategic development step will be supplemented by a new, regionally based Design & Lifestyle offering in Frankfurt in the second half of the year.\n\n7 Dec 2021\n\nTrade fair activities more important than ever\n\nMesse Frankfurt is looking ahead to the coming financial year 2022 with cautious optimism.

This is a difficult situation for exhibitors and trade visitors to maintain business relations during this time.

Ambiente was the first leading trade fair to be affected by the impact of the coronavirus on travelling. Another clearly noticeable factor was Storm Ciara. Business in the halls, however, did not suffer as much as expected, and, in all, large numbers of orders were placed throughout the trends and new products platform. Nevertheless, exhibitors were disappointed with the strong sense of uncertainty among visitors and therefore the absence of quite a few retail channels. Yet those who did travel to Frankfurt benefited from an outstanding ordering environment.\n\n30 Jan 2020\n\nNew Hall 5 construction project begins\n\nDemolition of Hall 5 has now begun on the exhibition grounds.

Sustainability was placed firmly at top of the agenda, outshining all other topics. 63,000 visitors gathered information about the major themes dominating the international industry from 2,952 exhibitors at the world's leading trade fair for home and contract textiles. As expected, the unusually early date led to a drop in visitor numbers.*\n\n2 Jan 2020\n\nMichael Biwer is the new Vice President of Guest Events\n\nMichael Biwer (39) has been at the helm of the Guest Events division at Messe Frankfurt Venue GmbH since January 2020.
