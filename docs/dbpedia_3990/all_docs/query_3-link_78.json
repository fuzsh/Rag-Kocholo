Rosa completed the distance from Friedrichshafen to Romanshorn and back, a total of around 22 km, in an incredible 6:52 hours, making her the fastest of seven swimmers (5 men and 2 women). This achievement was made even more difficult by strong winds and challenging navigation conditions. Despite these challenges, Rosa shone and crossed the finish line in first place. An incredible achievement that only a few have reached, as most of the nearly 80 participants swam only half-way. The water quality was excellent with a pleasant temperature of 24°C, which provided optimal conditions for this great performance. Congratulations, Rosa! Bodo Möller Chemie congratulates you on this great success and wishes you all the best for your future swimming career. #BodoMöllerChemie #OpenWaterSwimming #Bodensee #Success #Sponsoring #Swimming #Congratulation\n\nAs of August 1st, we are happy to announce that Bodo Möller Chemie has been officially appointed as the Distributor for Huntsman Tooling Products across a broad range of countries.

Since 1973, we have been working closely together, initially starting with packaging and distributing of Irganox® plastic additives to small and medium-sized customers. Throughout the years, our partnership has grown as we expanded our distribution to include a wider range of products from the BASF portfolio. Today, we offer a diverse selection of high-quality additives for plastics and coatings. These include antioxidants, light stabilizers, and UV absorbers under the brand names Irganox®, Tinuvin®, and Chimassorb®. These plastic stabilizers, which were introduced in the 1970s, have since developed into innovative market solutions that have significantly improved the performance and promoted the sustainability of plastic applications. For decades, we have been accompanying BASF products and greatly valued our trusted and successful collaboration. Together, we look forward to a promising future filled with continuous success and many years of partnership!
