Rosa completed the distance from Friedrichshafen to Romanshorn and back, a total of around 22 km, in an incredible 6:52 hours, making her the fastest of seven swimmers (5 men and 2 women). This achievement was made even more difficult by strong winds and challenging navigation conditions. Despite these challenges, Rosa shone and crossed the finish line in first place. An incredible achievement that only a few have reached, as most of the nearly 80 participants swam only half-way. The water quality was excellent with a pleasant temperature of 24¬∞C, which provided optimal conditions for this great performance. Congratulations, Rosa! Bodo M√∂ller Chemie congratulates you on this great success and wishes you all the best for your future swimming career. #BodoM√∂llerChemie #OpenWaterSwimming #Bodensee #Success #Sponsoring #Swimming #Congratulation\n\nAs of August 1st, we are happy to announce that Bodo M√∂ller Chemie has been officially appointed as the Distributor for Huntsman Tooling Products across a broad range of countries.
