        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nNatural tannins, stricto sensu, are polyphenolic compounds of vegetal origin with the property to precipitate proteins. It is assumed that the oldest application of this tannins chemical property in technology is the stabilization of animal skins protein against putrefaction [1].\n\nAccording to some authors [2,3,4,5], it may have been by the end of Neolithic period and in the eastern Mediterranean region that man began to use, incipiently, plant materials, such as leaves, twigs, fruits, barks or roots, to prevent animal skins degradation, transforming them into a more durable and useful material. Empirical development of this process during Classical Antiquity resulted in one of the most important animal skin transformation technique: vegetable tanning. This millenary technology, which is still in use, is one of the oldest processes used to produce leather. It was introduced in the north western regions of Europe after the Roman conquest [6], reaching thereafter a great importance in leather production which lasted until the end of the 19th century, when mineral tanning based on chromium (III) salts was developed and implemented in tanneries. Mineral tanning is nowadays the most used tanning process. In the early of the 20th century synthetic tannins, based on different organic molecules, were introduced in leather industry with the purpose of aiding vegetable tanning [1,7].\n\nSuccinctly, the vegetable tanning method can be described as the treatment of animal skin—previously washed, limed, dehaired, fleshed, delimed-, with crushed vegetable materials, or liquors/macerations (oozes), infusions, or decoctions, or extracts prepared with those materials. The result is the transformation of animal skin into what is termed by leather: a stable and non-putrescible material, resistant to deterioration promoted both by microorganisms and heat, when wetted. This is due to the chemical bonds established between collagen, the main constitutive protein of skin, and the tannins present in the vegetable materials. Collagen stabilization occurs when 15% to 40% of tannins, per dry weight of skins, are absorbed and incorporated into the collagen fibres matrix, depending of the type of leather produced [1,8,9,10].\n\nThe origin of the term ‘tannin’ it is also close related to the vegetable tanning process and came into use in France at the end of the 18th century by the French chemist Armand Séguin (1767–1835), who had previously worked with Antoine Lavoisier. Séguin firstly used the word tannin to define the organic substance present in the aqueous extracts of plants responsible for the transformation of skin into leather. The word derives from the French word tan, which corresponds to the ground oak bark, an important widespread and extensively used European vegetable source for leather making.\n\nThe term tanning (and tannage in French) itself has also a root in the word tan, and it was originally reserved for leather production with tannins but, since the 19th century with the development of other processes, the word has been applied for all different processes of leather making [11,12].\n\nVegetable tanning could be performed in different ways mostly depending on the size of animal skins, but since the medieval period three main techniques could be found in Europe: pit, vat and bag tanning [13,14,15,16].\n\nTanning in pits—large tanks set on the ground—was a slow and static process mostly reserved to the treatment of large animal skins (hides) and to produce heavy and strong leathers for shoe soles, belting or harness. Succinctly, hides were set in horizontal layers inside the pits (or layaways) with the ground vegetable material, one layer of hide another layer of crushed barks or leaves. Water or oozes was then added to the pits until all the skins were immersed and left for about 6 to 12 months.\n\nThe tanning of small to medium skins was mostly performed in wooden or clay vats where they were put together with the vegetable material, or an aqueous liquor of these materials, and stirred together for a few weeks until the required amount tanning material had been absorbed.\n\nThe last process, bag tanning, mostly used in south of Europe, was a faster process since it took only two to three weeks to complete. This method was used to produce light and fancy leathers that were then applied in lavish items such as jewellery and cases coverings, etc. To obtain these exquisite leathers, the skins were folded, sewed like a small bag and filled up with water and with the ground vegetable material inside. Then “bags” were immersed in an identical infusion or liquors used to fill it and shake to speed up the process of tanning. Basils (badanas, in Iberian languages), cordovans and morocco are some examples of vegetable tanned leathers traditionally produced by bag tanning technique [17,18,19,20].\n\nWith the Industrial Revolution, and the need of faster tanning processes, all vegetable tanned leathers started to be produced in drums which consist of a wooden cylinder rotating around its own axis filled with skins, tanning agents and water.\n\nLeather produced with tannins, or vegetable tanned leather, was one of the most important pre-industrial materials in Western world, very much appreciated and demanded due to its versatility. Its characteristics, ranging from rigid to flexible, depend on the raw materials used, both skins and vegetable tannins, and the tanning techniques. It was a fundamental material for the production a wide range of artefacts such as footwear, garments, book bindings, saddlery, wall-hangings, furniture upholstery, cases coverings, carriages or liquids containers [7,21]. Beyond its utilitarian function, it was also used as support material for artistic and decorative paintings, wall hangings or screen coverings. Different ornamental techniques such as dyeing, painting, gilding, moulding, tooling, embroidering, cutting-out, scorching or sewing, have been often incorporated transforming vegetable tanned leather into a valuable and luxurious material. Gilt leather (Spanish leather, guadameci) is one of the finest examples created in Europe: it is a silvered and then “golden” varnished, painted and tooled or moulded vegetable tanned leather, mostly produced between the 16th and 18th centuries [13,22,23].\n\nTherefore, vegetable tanned leather is the most common type of heritage leather found in museums and collections [24,25].\n\n2. Vegetable Tanning Materials: The Sources of Tannins\n\nVegetable tannins are polyphenolic secondary metabolites produced by higher plants. They can precipitate not only proteins, as it was stated before, but also polysaccharides and alkaloids. They are large molecules with a molecular weight comprised from 500 to 30,000 Da. However, not all tannins are useful for tanning, only those with a molecular weight lower than 3000 Da are efficient in leather making since large molecules are unable to penetrate into the skin’s fibre structure and tend to be water insoluble [1,26].\n\nTannins can be divided in four classes: hydrolysable, condensed, complex and phlorotannins [27,28,29]. Complex tannins have a molecular structure that can be considered a mixture of hydrolysable and condensed, including gallic, ellagic and catechin sub-units. Phlorotannins are a small group of tannins isolated mainly from brown seaweeds. None of the two groups is important for leather tanning.\n\nHydrolysable tannins consist in a monosaccharide core, usually glucose, esterified with gallic acid, forming the gallotannins, or with hexahydrodiphenoic acid, the precursor of ellagic acid, and gallic acid, forming the ellagitannins. Upon heating in acidic aqueous medium, they hydrolyse to yield gallic and ellagic acid. Thermal decomposition originates pyrogallol which gave the traditional and former name to this class of compounds.\n\nCondensed tannins have a flavonoid origin. They are oligo- or polymeric proanthocyanidins were the phenolic hydroxyls are totally or partially esterified with gallic acid.\n\nMany plants rich in tannins had been used over time. lists the most important sources of tannins used in European tanneries until development of mineral tanning since before the 18th century the autochthonous plants were the main raw vegetable tanning materials. However, with the growing need for leather and the increase in trading between Europe and other continents such as Africa, Australia and South America, other exotic sources arrived at Europeans tanneries in large amounts and low cost [15,30,31].\n\nTable 1\n\nBotanical NameCommon NameOrigin and DistributionPart of the Plant UsedMain TanninsGeographical UsesObservationsAcacia mearnsiimimosa, wattleAustralia, cultivated in South Africa since 1864 and South Americabarkscondensedimported since second decade of 19th century, commercial extractsBetula spp.birchnorthern Europe, Russiabarkscondensednorthern Europe, Russiaused to produce Russia leatherCaesalpinia coriariadivi-diviCentral and South Americapodshydrolysable: gallotanninsimported since late 18th centuryCastanea sativachestnut, sweet chestnutMediterranean regionwoodhydrolysable: ellagitanninssince 19th century, commercial extractsused mixed with other vegetable materials to produce firm leatherCoriaria myrtifoliaMediterrenean coriaria (emborrachacabras, redoul, roldor, rodor)southern France and Mediterranean coastal Spain leaves (redoul)hydrolysablesouthern France and Mediterranean coastal SpainCotinus coggygria (syn Rhus cotinus)smoke treesouthern Europe, Mediterranean regionleaves (Venetian or Turkish sumac)hydrolysable: gallotanninssouthern EuropeLarixlarchnorthern Europebarkcondensednorthern EuropeMirtus communismyrtlesouthern Europeleaveshydrolysable: ellagitanninsItalic PeninsulaPicea abiesNorway spruceAlps, Pyrenees, Germany, Scandinaviabarkscondensednorthern and central EuropePinus halepensisAleppo pinecoastal areas of the western Mediterranean regionbarkscondensednorthern Europeyields a reddish leatherQuercus aegilopsvalonea oak, Turkish oakeastern Mediterranean regionacorn cupshydrolysable: ellagitanninsMiddle Ages in Turkey, Greece, ItalyQuercus cocciferagarouilleMediterranean regionhusk of root (rusque)hydrolysablesouth of FranceQuercus infectoriaAleppo oakeastern Mediterranean regiongalls (Allepo galls)hydrolysable: gallotanninsEuropeQuercus ilexholm oakcentral-western part of the Mediterraneanbarkscondensed and hydrolysableIberian PeninsulaQuercus spp. (Q. ilex, Q. robur, Q. petraea, Q. pyrenaica)oakEuropebarkscondensed and hydrolysable: ellagitanninsEuropewoodhydrolysable: ellagitanninsQuercus subercork oakinner barkcondensed and hydrolysable: ellagitanninsIberian PeninsulaRhus coriariasumacMediterranean regionleaves (Sicilian sumac)hydrolysable: gallotanninssouthern Europeyields light coloured, soft and supple leathers.

Leathers produced with hydrolysable tannins are light brown, yellow or greenish, and are lightfast. Leathers produced with condensed tannins have a brown to reddish colour, becoming darker if exposed to light. This latter type of leather tends to absorb more easily atmospheric pollutants like sulphur dioxide, promoting the acidic hydrolysis of collagen, leading to its degradation. The so-called red rot is an advanced stage of degradation where cohesion is lost due to the disintegration of collagen fibres. Leather produced with condensed tannins is more prone to this occurrence than the one produced with hydrolysable tannins [9,25].\n\n2.1. Barks\n\nBarks from different tree species were, and some still are, very important raw materials in the production of vegetable tanned leathers.\n\nIn Europe, oak (Quercus spp.) barks were the most used. In the British Isles and other western European countries, the prevailing species were English (pedunculated) oak (Quercus robur syn. Q. pedunculata) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea syn. Q. sessiliflora), while in the south predominated Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) and Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea). In the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions of south Europe, the bark of smaller and endemic species belonging to the Quercus genus such as cork oak (Quercus suber), holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia syn. Q. ilex subsp. rotundifolia) and kermes oak (Quercus coccifera) were also used since these species grow spontaneously [12,18,33].\n\nBarks were removed from trees with 12 to 15 years old, between spring and early summer, since it is the time when barks are richer in tannins and, at the same time, easier to separate from the trunk. Barks were dried and then ground into a powder containing 6–17% weight of a mixture of condensed tannins and ellagitannins [1,7].\n\nEarly analysis of Quercus robur and Q. petraea barks found that they contained proanthocyanidins of the procyanidin and prodelphinidin type. Nevertheless only 23% of the water-soluble oak bark tannins consisted of oligomeric proanthocyanidins [34,35].\n\nQuercus spp., namely Q. robur, such the other species known by the common name of oak, are also a rich source of ellagitannins. The main ellagitannins that account for 40–60% of components of the bark are vescalagin and castalagin. These are complex molecules comprising a linear glucose unit with OH at the 4 and 6 positions esterified with a hexahydrodiphenoic acid (HHDP acid). At the same time, it also exists a C-C coupling between C-1 of glucose and C-2 of a nonahydroxytriphenoyl moyaty. This unit esterifies the remaining OH of glucose at the 3, 4 and 5 positions ( ). Vescalagin and castalagin are epimers at the C-1 position of glucose unit [26,36].\n\nSteriochemistry of the C-C bond between the two galloyl unit, linked to C-3 and C-5 OH of glucose has recently been reinvestigated [37].\n\nQuercus suber, cork oak, was also used in tanning. The inner part of the bark was removed and used in Portugal, Spain and Corsega. It was also exported to Ireland [20,33,38]. Investigation of cork from Spanish specimen indicates that the main tannins were common to the other Quercus species, the ellagitannins grandinin ( ), vescalagin, and castalagin, being grandinin and castalagin the main components [39].\n\nQuercus coccifera, kermes oak, was very used in the French Provence where it was known as garouille. Rusque, the name of the husk of the root, was used to produce shoe sole of high quality [19,20].\n\nIn northern Europe and Russia, the main vegetable tanning materials were the barks of local trees like Betula spp., birch, Salix spp., willow, Larix spp., larch, or Picea spp., spruce. The use of these barks was restricted to these regions [20,33].\n\nOne of the finest examples of vegetable tanned leathers produced in Eastern Europe was Russia leather, which was obtained by tanning the hides or skins with birch or willow barks. It was a highly valued leather, being exported from Moscow to Western Europe from the 17th to the 19th centuries where it was very appreciated for furniture upholstery and lavish coverings [7,18].\n\nThe above species biosynthesise condensed tannins although these compounds were found in small percentages [40].\n\nIn Scandinavia, barks from Salix arenaria and Salix resseliana containing 7–11% of condensed tannins were traditionally used to produce leather for gloves [20].\n\nTannins from the bark of Picea abies (Norway spruce) were identified as combinations of (epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin units with a polymerization degree of up to 13 units [41].\n\nDuring the late 18th and 19th century there existed a great demand on tanning vegetable material. To overcome the problem, barks from what was called exotic trees were imported from South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. One of the most imported material was the bark of Acacia mearnsii, black wattle, endemic in Australia and New Zealand and cultivated in South Africa. This material is still very used today in Europe by leather industry. Barks were collected from August to October. The outer part was discarded, and the inner part was milled. It could be used as a powder or boiled to produce liquor that was evaporated to dryness and traded for all Europe [20,42]. Acacia bark contains 22–48% of condensed tannins. This source of tannins is a very effective tanning agent and is used to produce different types of leathers, with a light red colour when new becoming darker with time.\n\nWattle tannins consist of about 9% monomers, 42% dimers, 40% trimers, 9% tetramers and 1% pentamers and higher oligomers by mass. The starter unit is either catechin or gallocatechin and the extender units, fisetinidol or robinetinidol ( a). The second extender unit is always linked to the starter unit to give angular trimers ( b). The predominance of trimers in the vegetable material is essential for leather tanning since high molecular weight oligomers would not be able to penetrate skin collagen fibres. A. mearnsii proanthocyanidin has recently been investigated. The percentage of the different monomers in the tannin of mimosa are around 15% of catechin, 65–70% of robinetidinol and 15–20% of fisetinidol. It can be considered as a mixture of procyanidin or profisetidin and prorobinetidin or prodelphinidin substructures ( ) most probably as a mixture of procyanidin and prorobinetidin or prodelphinidin since the proportion of OH/H substitution at position 5 is 6.8:1 and the proportion of OH/H substitution at position 5′ is 3:2 [43,44].\n\nTable 2\n\nTannins NameProcyanidinProfisetidinProrobinetidinProdelphinidinChemical structure of the building blockCoupling position4–84–64–64–8\n\n2.2. Wood\n\nWood was mainly used in furniture and buildings, so its use in tanning was scarce until the beginning of the 19th century when an urge need for new tanning materials appeared. Both chestnut and oak wood began to be used as ground or aqueous extracts [45]. The wood of these species, like the barks, are also rich in ellagitannins. Nowadays, chestnut extracts are still used in industry being mainly produced in Italy, Central Europe and Baltic region. Research of chestnut heartwood indicated that has a polyphenolic constitution similar to oak wood. Monomeric vescalagin and castalagin predominate in oak wood representing 40–60% of the ellagitannins. Dimers (roburin A and roburin D, ( a) and other compounds were other sugar unit like lyxose/xylose derivatives grandinin, roburin B, roburin C, and roburin E ( a,b), were also identified in oak woods [46]. Some of the previous roburins like roburin A and roburin E were also identified in small amounts in oak bark [39].\n\nDuring the last decades of the 19th century Europe began to import an exotic wood, quebracho, Schinopsis lorentzii and S. balasae, from south America [18,47]. This tree has hard and reddish wood rich in condensed tannins, about 14–26% weight of the heartwood. Quebracho tannins extracts contains oligomers based on catechin as starter unit linked to one, two, three, etc. ent-fisetinidol extender units ( , ). The trimer is angular with one fisetinidol linked to the C-8 position and the other to the C-6-position of catechin. Analysis of the tannin indicates that is composed by about 33% dimers, 37% trimers, 21% tetramers, 8% pentamers, and 1% heptamers. Compounds with higher degree of polymerisation, if present, exist in low concentration [1,48,49].\n\n2.3. Leaves\n\nIn Europe, until the 20th century, sumac (Rhus coriaria) leaves, together with oak bark, were one of the most important materials used to produce leathers. Sumac has been used since Antiquity and it is even mentioned in Pedanius Dioscorides book “De Materia Medica” written between 50–70 AD. During the Middle Age it was a valuable material used to produce delicate, light colored and great durability leathers. It was also used in the dying of leathers and textiles. In Iberian Peninsula it was used to prepare the famous cordovan, leather prepared with goat skins, and basils. The word sumac refers to several species belonging to the genera Rhus of the Anacardean family. It also refers to the powder obtained milling the leaves and small branches of the shrub collected from July to September. Good quality sumac contains 25–35% of gallotannins. Rhus coriaria grew spontaneously or cultivated in several regions of the South Europe, namely Portugal, Spain and Sicilia, produced a light yellow to green tanning powder.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries there was a great demand for Portuguese sumac produced in the north of the country and it is described in the firsts encyclopedias as having a superior quality. It was exported to France and British Islands to be used by the textile and leather manufactures of Northern Europe. However, during the 20th century Spanish and Sicilian sumac surpassed the demand for Portuguese sumac [18,33,50].\n\nIn Turkey and in the Oriental Mediterranean another specie of sumac was used, named Turkish or Venezian sumac, Rhus cotinus (syn. Cotinus coggygria) used in the Mediterranean region but containing less amount of tannins. Both sumacs tanning materials produces pale and soft leathers, contrasting with other tanning agents that originate brown coloured leathers. Pale leathers were much appreciated since they could be dyed in light and bright colours without dark background interference. There are however some drawbacks: sumac infusions ferment and hydrolyse easily and the resulting material has no tanning properties. They were used in vat or bag tanning.\n\nBesides sumac leaves other plants leaves were also used for leather production, such as myrtle, mastic and rédoul. The last one is of French provenance, very used in the French regions of Languedoc and Provence and also in Catalonia where was called redon. It was also known as French or fake sumac and it was poorer tanning material, with only about 15% of tannins [7,20,51].\n\nAs stated above, sumac is a source of gallotannins. The simplest gallotannin is pentagalloyl glucose, β-1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloyl-O-d-glucopyranose (PGG). This compound has the five free hydroxyls of glucose esterified with a galloyl residues. The α anomer is not usual in nature. More galloyl residues can be attached to PGG through a meta- or para depside bond ( ) [26].\n\nTannic acid is considered the tanning agent in sumac. Commercial tannic acid has a molecular weight of 1701.206 g/mol and a molecular formula of C76H52O46, corresponding to a decagalloyl glucose, sumac leaves contain a mixture of gallotannins, from penta to decagalloyl-glucoside [52,53,54].\n\nIn Spain, true sumac was many times forged with mastic (Pistacia lentiscus) leaves. However this plant contains condensed tannins and leathers thus obtained were darker and got a reddish colour with light.\n\nLeaves of Myrtus communis were widely used for leather production in Italic Peninsula. This plant contains the following ellagitannins: oenothein B, eugeniflorin D2, and tellimagrandins I and II [55].\n\n2.4. Fruits\n\nA few fruits were also used as tanning materials, the most important being valonia and divi-divi. Valonia is the acorns of Quercus aegilops, a tree also known as Turkish oak, which grows abundantly in Turkey, Greece and adjacent countries. Acorns are usually picked up in August and then dried out from the domes. It has been widely used in the production of leather in Austria, Germany and France and allows producing faster, harder, firmer, heavier and quite impermeable to water leather. Valonia is a source of ellagitannins, whose main constituents are castalagin, vescalagin and pentagalloylglucose ( and ) [56]. This material was often mixed with ground oak bark to produce soles that were considered of excellent quality and durability [18,20].\n\nThe divi-divi is a pod of a shrub, Caesalpinia coriaria, native to South America. It became to be imported and used in English tanneries in the 19th century. This material, mainly a source of gallotannins containing a small amount of condensed tannins, produces very porous leathers of brown or reddish-brown colour [20,57].\n\n2.5. Galls\n\nGalls are pathological excrescences formed in the branches, leaves or domes of plants as a response to the bites of certain insects or other parasites. They are anomalous grow of plant tissues and have different size, shape and composition depending on the plant and the agent that causes them. Galls used in tanning have a spherical (globose) shape, are smooth or have a crown and are characterized by a high content of tannins, 40% to 70% of gallotannins. The most important are the so-called Turkish galls, Aleppo or Levant galls, and are produced by the insect Cynips gallae tinctoriae in the branches of the Quercus infectoria (syn Q. lusitanica) growing mainly in Asia Minor. These galls have a greenish or brownish colour, are rigid, compact, very astringent, bitter to taste and are one of the raw materials used to obtain tannic acid [33].\n\nThe so-called white galls, brownish-yellow, lighter, less astringent and with bitter taste, having less tannin content than greenish galls, are another type of galls produced by Q. infectoria [19,20]. Since Ancient Greece that both have commercial importance and, in addition to tanneries, were widely used in traditional medicine, dyeing and to make writing ink (iron gallic ink).\n\nAnother important gall is known as knoppern, or acorn gall, which is caused by the insect C. quercus-calycis and found in many Central European Quercus (Q. robur, Q. pyrenaica) (Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Slovenia) and Greece [20]."
