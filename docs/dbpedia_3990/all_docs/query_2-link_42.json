        "text": "A musician and a talented composer\n\nEven though the name of Pleyel is known worldwide today, few people know who is behind this legendary name in music. Ignaz Pleyel was born June 18th 1757 in Ruppersthal in Lower Austria. A teacher’s son, the young man was very soon noticed for his musical skills by Count Ladislaus Erdöly who became his patron. He took prestigious lessons and became the favourite pupil of Joseph Haydn. With the support of his patron, Ignaz Pleyel made many trips to Europe where he was to meet the main actors in musical life at that time.\n\nIn 1783, Ignaz Pleyel arrived in Strasbourg where he took charge of the Prince of Rohan Music School and then in 1789 became the master of the Strasbourg Cathedral orchestra. By accepting this departure for France, the musician obtained the right of \"Bourgeoisie\" allowing him to become a French citizen and change his name to Ignace.\n\nMozart : \"What a joy for music\"\n\nDuring the last 15 years of the 18th century, Ignace Pleyel was the most popular and most played musician; his talent was greatly appreciated by his colleagues, the first of whom was Mozart, who said about Pleyel: \"What a joy for music.\"\n\nCrowning this reputation, Pleyel played a series of concerts in London in 1792 with his master Joseph Haydn. Both were virtuosos at the height of their art. While the French Revolution was in full swing, the best French artists were asked to celebrate this new era of liberty, equality and fraternity.\n\nThus, Ignace Pleyel composed the Hymn to Freedom in 1791 and The Revolution of August 10th in 1793. And while the revolutionary composers were appointed as teachers at the new Conservatory, Ignace preferred to settle with his family in the neighbourhood of the Chaussée d’Antin in Paris, where he founded a music publishing house.\n\nA talent at the service of his art\n\nIn 1797, Ignace opened a small music publishing house in Paris. Naturally he began by publishing his own works, but also those of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Boccherini.\n\nBrimming with ideas, it was not long before he invented the paperback score. His cost-effective collection in paperback format was called the \"Music Library\". Fashion changes in music pushed Ignace Pleyel to shelve his playing career to devote himself to his publishing business.\n\nHowever he soon expanded his activities, launching into the sale of various instruments, including harps, guitars and pianos.\n\n1807, the first Pleyel pianos\n\nTo manufacturing his own pianos, Ignace Pleyel teamed up with Charles Lemme, who owned a workshop in Paris. This partnership only lasted a short time, a mere three years, before Pleyel set up his own workshop at the end of 1807. Increasingly absorbed by his piano manufacturing workshop, he gave up his publishing house in 1809. Unfortunately for Ignace Pleyel, the sale of instruments went through a major crisis shortly afterwards and he struggled to sell his instruments.\n\nWithout the financial help of his musician friends, such as Kalkbrenner, Rossini and Mehul, Pleyel pianos would have had an extremely short existence. In 1824, his son Camille joined him to take over all his sales activities. Ignace Pleyel gradually moved away from musical life and retired to his Somereau home near Paris.\n\nCamille Pleyel, a musician who amazed Chopin\n\nBorn in 1788 in Strasbourg, Camille Pleyel first studied with his father before receiving lessons from virtuoso Jan Ladislav Dussek.\n\nA talented musician and concert performer, Camille made numerous trips through Europe and was particularly noticed in the court of the King of England. Less prolific than his father in terms of composition, Camille was nevertheless a better musician.\n\nMoreover, his friend Frédéric Chopin said about him, \"today, there is only one man who can play Mozart, and that is (Camille) Pleyel, and when he wants to play a four-hand sonata with me, I take a lesson.\"\n\nA new boost for Pleyel pianos\n\nIn 1824, at the age of 35, Camille joined his father in the adventure of Pleyel pianos. Camille had taken advantage of his many trips to visit piano manufacturers, such as Broadwood, and he was inspired to improve his own pianos. The arrival of Camille was thus the herald of an in-depth reorganisation of the company, which quickly paid off. Indeed, as of 1825, his research and innovative work allowed the company to expand.\n\nBut Camille had another important asset: his connections and friendly relations with the great musicians of the time. Kalkbrenner, who had already helped his father, became his partner in 1824, while other artists like Cramer, Moscheles or Chopin promoted the brand worldwide. Thus, soon after his arrival, the company boomed and acquired an international reputation.\n\nThe artists, the best promotion for the brand\n\nn this first half of the 19th century, Parisian musical life was in full swing. On January 1st 1830, Camille Pleyel organised the first public concert played on a Pleyel piano, ushering in what would become a custom: performing in public concerts on the company’s pianos. This ability to surround itself with artists, discovering talents and having them play its instruments is one of the characteristics of the Pleyel Company. Camille regarded musical events where the public could appreciate and judge the sound qualities of the instruments he sold as complementary to his industry.\n\nThe first concert halls in the world\n\nIn 1830, there were not any concert halls in the strict sense of the word, but more premises scraped together for this purpose. Quickly, these halls took on the appellation of \"salons\" borrowing from the literary salons of the Age of Enlightenment. It is in this context that Camille inaugurated his famous salons, located at 9 Rue Cadet, on January 1st 1830. They were to become a centre of Parisian musical life, where many virtuosos would be heard for the first time. Camille opened his doors to foreign artists visiting Paris: Cramer, Steibelt, Moscheles, Hummel and John Field. The salons of Rue Cadet prefigured what was to later become the first auditorium in the world dedicated to music. Located at 22 Rue Rochechouart and financed through the sale of the musical publications business, it boasted 550 seats. This undeniable link between Pleyel and high-quality concerts culminated in the opening of the legendary Salle Pleyel in October 1927 at Rue du Faubourg Saint- Honoré. This temple of classical music and jazz has hosted the greatest artists in the world for many years.\n\n1831: A turning point in the life of Camille\n\nThe year 1831 marked a turning point in the life of Camille. On November 17th, Ignace Pleyel passed away, leaving behind the work of a major composer.\n\nHe was buried in Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris. Shortly before the death of his father, Camille married Marie Mock, who had previously been engaged to Berlioz. This concert pianist, accomplished virtuoso and famous throughout Europe, opened the doors of romantic salons to him. Following these changes, a new era began. Particularly attentive to artistic undercurrents, the young man loved to surprise and stand out from the classicism of his competitors. Thus, on February 26 th 1832 in the salons of Rue Cadet in Paris he organised the first concert of Frederic Chopin.\n\nPleyel and Chopin, inseparable\n\nCamille Pleyel met Frédéric Chopin in the autumn of 1831 and in the Pleyel salons of his friend Camille, he gave his first concert on February 26th 1832. Before an audience of great Parisian pianists and music journalists, his success was immediate. His success continued until his death, but Chopin remained faithful to his friend Camille and to Pleyel pianos, whose touch married perfectly with Chopin’s playing, sometimes airy and refined and sometimes of measured violence. \"When I feel in good form and strong enough to find my own sound, I need a Pleyel piano,\" Chopin liked to repeat. Camille became Chopin’s appointed provider, who gave in return all his Parisian public concerts in the Pleyel salons. He packed the house until his very last performance, a few months before his death in 1849.\n\nContinuous improvement of pianos\n\nCamille intended to offer musicians a concert hall worthy of the name, but he continued in parallel to pay great attention to improving the instruments he produced.\n\nHe was the first to dare to use a metal frame for his pianos.\n\nHe gradually transformed the piano to meet the new demands of composers.\n\nFor powerful and rich sound, essential for some romantic works, he chose to place iron soundboard braces in grand pianos, which by their better resistance offered greater volume.\n\nHe also gave the keyboard perfect equality.\n\nCamille never ceased to file patents.\n\nHe introduced the upright piano in France and perfected its production by inventing the \"extended\" sound.\n\nPianos for all\n\nIn 1838, he put on sale a baby grand piano of which the sound and timbre were comparable to larger models.\n\nAnxious to allow everyone to work on a Pleyel piano, he proposed, as of 1839, a square study piano with two sets of strings and six octaves of excellent quality, very solidly built and at a very affordable price.\n\nAware of entering a decisive period for his company in severe competition with Erard, Camille launched his small upright pianos, the famous pianinos.\n\nIn 1855, the workshops employed 350 workers and produced 1,400 pianos a year.\n\nConquering the world\n\nFrom 1830-1835, Camille was looking to expand his piano manufacturing. To do so, he aimed to win over new customers by trying the international market, so far dominated by the English.\n\nSeeing a possible outlet for his business, he was particularly attentive to the manufacture of instruments for foreign countries, adapting and modifying their construction according to the climatic conditions to which they could be subject.\n\nVery quickly, his efforts paid off. A newspaper of the time quoted that Pleyel pianos were not only in major cities in Europe, but also in New Orleans, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Brazil, India and even Australia.\n\nAn exceptional entrepreneur\n\nAssociated with Camille Pleyel in 1853, Auguste Wolff became head of the company in 1855. Like the Pleyels, he was also from a family of musicians. Born in Paris in 1821, Wolff, a talented composer and an excellent musician, was awarded first prize in piano at the Paris Music Conservatory in 1839.\n\nHe had active entrepreneurial skills that allowed him to extend the work of Pleyel. He became an exceptional piano maker and contributed greatly to the development of the company, especially by the ingenuity and the quality of his innovations.\n\nA large factory in Saint-Denis\n\nIn 1865, to support the resounding commercial development of the company, the Pleyel manufacturing workshops were transferred to Saint-Denis. A large factory was erected on the 55,000 square meter site. It included workshops equipped with steam engines, large areas for storing equipment from around the world and offices for management.\n\nAdvances in industrial technology with the development of steam and dynamo-electric engines allowed the production of a number of units that had never been achieved before, with a peak in 1866, the year during which 3,000 pianos left the factory.\n\nPleyel, the \"French\" sound\n\nFollowing the disappearance of Auguste Wolff, Gustave Lyon took charge of the Pleyel Company. Born in 1857, Lyon was an alumnus of the Ecole Polytechnique and held an engineering degree from the Ecole de Mines. Also an accomplished musician, he used his scientific knowledge to improve the quality of pianos and deepen the acoustic secrets.\n\nOne of his first innovations was to make a stainless steel metal frame for pianos - the famous \"Pleyel steel\", a specific less carburised metal cast in one piece and not assembled.\n\nHis inventions earned him an honorary award at the 1889 Paris Universal Exhibition when the Pleyel Company produced its 100,000 th piano. An exceptional title of glory since Pleyel was the first piano manufacturer in the world to reach this figure.\n\nAt the turn of the new century, the Pleyel brand had its fans. It was indeed Lyon that led pianists to adopt the famous Pleyel sound, embodying \"the French sound\" with its romantic colouristic characteristics. Pleyel pianos had lightness, roundness, a powerful bass and an amazing sparkling treble, which gave them a real harmony. The sound of Pleyel pianos seduced the whole young generation composed mainly of Russian composers.\n\nIn 1907, Gustave Lyon organised a concert in their honour at the Salle Pleyel in Rue de Rochechouart. Camille Saint-Saëns, launched by the Pleyel Company when he was 11 years old, organised the event that brought together prestigious pianists: Rimsky-Korsakov, Rachmaninov and Wanda Landowska.\n\nThe Salle Pleyel\n\nIn addition to manufacturing pianos, Gustave Lyon was fascinated by the acoustics of concert halls. At this time the sound was more a matter of art than a science. Lyon became an acoustics specialist of auditoriums and his recommendations were regularly followed by architects.\n\nThe construction of the Salle Pleyel at Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in 1927 marked the apotheosis of this dynasty.\n\nThis imposing auditorium of music in Paris presented at its opening a capacity of 2,600 seats.\n\nAt that time, the Salle Pleyel was one of the three most prestigious auditoriums in the world, next to the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and Carnegie Hall in New York.\n\n...and decadence\n\nThe crisis of 1929\n\nBut the crisis of 1929 will announce, with a bankruptcy filing in 1933, a long decadence which sadly ended in 2013 with the closure of the production workshop in Saint Denis, the last desperate survival of a past greatness, which produced only a few examples for a rich clientele more interested in unique pieces by famous famous designers than real instruments.\n\nIn 2017, Gérard Garnier and his son Benjamin decided to revive the phoenix from its ashes.\n\nDespite its wreckage, the brand has remained iconic, and our intrepid entrepreneurs, at the head of the Algam group, one of the world leaders in the distribution and manufacturing of musical instruments, will take all their time to avoid falling back into the mistakes of the past. Thanks to a solid international network of industrial partners but also thanks to four long years of research and development, the first prototypes that came out of the Pleyel workshop in Nantes were applauded by the piano world. But it was not enough to find the famous crystalline but also mellow timbre which made the happiness of Chopin in the intimacy of the salons. It was also necessary to endow the Pleyel of the 21st century power and a perfect homogeneity of the registers, by marrying the sound with a more orchestral brilliance and a great reliability of touch to make the instrument sing, in order to see them regain their among the world’s great brands.\n\nAfter several decades of wandering, the rebirth of Pleyel marks the return of French elegance to the piano world.\n\nFrench design\n\nThe design of Pleyel pianos combines today’s technologies with the traditional know-how of piano makers. The thousands of parts of each piano are modeled in 3D using Solidworks, the powerful software developed by Dassault Systèmes. The specifications and plans produced in Nantes allow each model to benefit from cutting-edge technology in the service of the wonderful Pleyel sound.\n\nIn keeping with its tradition of excellence, Pleyel has always been a leader in the manufacture of its pianos, Pleyel is extremely demanding in the choice of components and the selection of materials: For all its soundboards, which give the piano its soul, Pleyel uses the finest spruce from the Val de Fiemme in Italy, renowned for its exceptional vibratory qualities, which has the ability to amplify musical emotion and give the instrument greater power.\n\nThe mechanism is made according to Pleyel designs and specifications, guaranteeing the highest level of performance and reliability. Pleyel uses keyboards made of top quality spruce wood that provides a very high resistance to hygrometric variations. These keyboards are particularly appreciated for their comfort and precision of execution.\n\nThe cast-iron frame, a true \"backbone\" of the instrument, on which the strings exert a pressure of up to 20 tons, is meticulously controlled : perfection of the casting, careful execution of its surface, maturation cycle and and strict verification of the dimensions.\n\nAll Pleyel pianos are made with strings from renowned German brands : Hellerbass for the bass strings and Röslau for the medium-high strings, to ensure the best sound, while providing stability and durability of the tuning. The Trocadero models, on the other hand, benefit from the Paulello silver-spun bass strings.\n\nUsing only the highest quality materials, Pleyel selects the different species and qualities of wood species with particular care. From storage to cutting, from humidity level to assembly, each step of the woodworking is subject to precise quality control.\n\nFrench finishing\n\nStabilization\n\nAs soon as the semi-finished pianos are received at the Pleyel workshop in Nantes, they are unpacked and placed in a rigorously controlled environment in terms of hygrometry and temperature in order to stabilize. After at least three months of stabilization, the tuning and harmonization procedures carried out by our expert technicians will progressively give Pleyel pianos the famous French sound emblematic of the brand.\n\nAdjustment and tuning\n\nAt the Pleyel workshop in Nantes, our technicians will perform a precise adjustment of the height of each key, as well as the depth of depression, in order to obtain a perfect balance of the keyboard and thus a fluid and pleasant touch. They will also make sure that the hammer heads are in optimal contact with the string plane.\n\nFour tunings are carried out for each Pleyel piano: the first at the reception inspection, the second after adjustment, the third after finishing harmonization and the fourth tuning before the piano is shipped from Nantes.\n\nFinishing harmonization\n\nThe adjustment of the timbre, called \"harmonization\" or \"intonation\", is the ultimate point of the preparation of the piano: it is the step that will give it its sound, its tone, its harmonic richness. Harmonization consists of acting on the texture of the felt of the hammer heads, by softening or hardening them. The Pleyel technician will thus modulate the musical color of the piano by positioning, adjusting and orienting the settings, sanding and then stitching the hammer felts. This is a long and meticulous operation, taking many hours for each piano in the Pleyel workshop alone.\n\nPolishing and final inspection\n\nA piano must be beautiful not only musically but also aesthetically, so the last step in the preparation process is the complete reworking of the cabinet. Each instrument is thoroughly inspected, all traces, scratches and imperfections are removed and the lacquer is completely polished.\n\nFinally, a thin layer of wax-based protection is applied to the entire case to ensure that the piano is protected against minor aggressions that could alter its shine."
