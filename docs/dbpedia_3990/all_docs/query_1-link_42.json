        "text": "3 on the Bund are a young, up-and-coming Irish traditional music band from Ireland. Founded in 2019, they came together through the Irish World Academy at the University of Limerick and “rapidly went from unknown to hot property” (Folk World).\n\nThe band’s five members (Ella McGrory – piano, Rebecca McCarthy-Kent – fiddle, Susan Coleman – concertina and vocals, Seán Kelliher – guitar, Simon Pfisterer – uilleann pipes and flute) are from varied musical backgrounds which contributes to their diverse sound. As individuals, all are award-winning and accomplished performers. As a group, they have travelled to Beijing, Shanghai, the UK, the US, Switzerland, Germany, and several other countries across Europe.\n\nImpressively managing to record, produce, and release their debut album Frenzy during the Covid-19 pandemic, they received widespread recognition: “a superb debut from a spanking-fresh band with infinite potential!” (Anita Lock, Irish Music Magazine).\n\nOver the past two years, 3 on the Bund have been fast establishing a name for themselves within the Irish music scene in Europe. In April 2022, 3 on the Bund headlined the Irish Heartbeat Festival tour, a month-long tour across Germany and Switzerland. In 2023, they performed to sold-out crowds at Germany’s Rheingau Musik Festival and Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, and headlined the 26th Guinness Irish Christmas tour across Austria.\n\n2024 is also shaping up to be a big year for 3 on the Bund, with several tours booked across the continent including headlining the six-week long Irish Folk Festival tour of Germany. The band are also currently working on their second album, due to be released in 2024."
