        "text": "What to buy here: Picard leather-wear and bags.\n\nLeather making was an important industry through the middle of the 20th Century in Frankfurt and the surrounding region. Just east of the city limits is the city of Offenbach, which was a centre for the industry. By 2000, there were less than 20 companies making leather goods in and around Offenbach. One of those companies is Picard, founded in 1928 and located in Obertshausen about 7.5 miles from Frankfurt. Picard makes leatherwear for men and women that has a reputation for quality and durability. Its products are found in many Frankfurt leather shops. Gabler, located downtown at Toengesgasse 33, 60311 Frankfurt, is a good venue. Gabler predates Picard by about 50 years and is located one block away from the Zeil, the pedestrian zone that is the heart of the Frankfurt shopping district. The ladies handbags shown here range in size and are priced from 119 euros to 199 euros. Gabler store hours are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays.\n\nImage Courtesy of Joe Mapother.\n\nOld Town Walking Tour\n\nThe German city of Frankfurt, also known as Frankfurt am Main, has a long and complex history, spanning more than a thousand years.
