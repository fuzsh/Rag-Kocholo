        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nOffenbach am Main (German pronunciation: [ˈɔfənbaχ am ˈmaɪ̯n] ( listen)) is a city in Hesse, Germany, located on the southside of the river Main and part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area. Offenbach has a population of 126,934.[2]\n\nIn the twentieth century the city's economy was dominated by the machine-building and leather industries, and it was also a major centre of the typography and design industries. Other important industries are the automobile and pharmaceutical industries. More than half of the city's population have a non-German background, with Turks, former Yugoslavs, Arabs, Italians, Greeks and Poles as major groups.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe first documented reference to a suburb of Offenbach appears in 770.[3] In a document of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II dating to 977 exists the first mention of the place of Offenbach.[4] During the Middle Ages Offenbach passed through many hands. Only in 1486 could the Count Ludwig of Isenenburg finally take control of city for his family, and 1556 Count Reinhard of Isenburg relocated his Residence to Offenbach, building a palace, the Isenburger Schloß (Isenburg Palace), which was completed in 1559. It was destroyed by fire in 1564 and rebuilt in 1578.\n\nIn 1635 Offenbach given to the Landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt but it was returned to the Isenburg-Birstein Count (later Prince) in 1642 and remained in that Principality until 1815 when the Congress of Vienna gave the city to the Austrian Emperor, Francis I. A year later it was given to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nAlways very close to the city centre of Frankfurt, Offenbach was a popular location for business. The town has its own trade fair, and many companies have opened facilities here because there are fewer restrictions and no closed businesses. French Protestants (Huguenots) came in the 17th century and settled in Offenbach and contributed to making Offenbach a prosperous city, e.g., bringing knowledge of tobacco with them and turning Offenbach into a centre for rolling cigars. The town was more cosmopolitan than Frankfurt; famous people such as Goethe and Mozart visited it several times.\n\nThe Rumpenheim Palace and its park were a popular destination for monarchs in the 19th century. The city was thereafter ruled by Grand Dukes of Hesse and by Rhine until the monarchy was abolished in 1918. Offenbach became the center of the traditional design with figures such as the architect Hugo Eberhardt, the typographer Rudolf Koch, the bookbinder and designer Ignatz Wiemeler and Ernst Engel and the painter Karl Friedrich Lippmann.\n\nDuring the Second World War a third of the city was destroyed by Allied bombing, which claimed 467 lives. With the new district Lauterborn the city was expanded to the south in the 1960s. On the border with Frankfurt, the office district Kaiserlei was built. Offenbach is a so-called ´Sozialer Brennpunkt`(= multiple social problems area) because of unemployment, poverty, gang related crime and migration.[5]\n\nRank Nationality Population (2014) 1 Turkey 6,309 2 Greece 4,698 3 Poland 4,359 4 Romania 3,742 5 Bulgaria 3,193 6 Croatia 2,459 7 Serbia 1,390 8 Template:Country data Bosnia & Herzegovina 1,284 9 Morocco 1,222 10 Portugal 886\n\nBoroughs of Offenbach[]\n\nThe inner town of Offenbach is quite large and has only a few suburbs. In the east the three incorporated: Bürgel (incorporated 1908), Bieber (incorporated April 1, 1938), and Rumpenheim (incorporated April 4, 1942). In the south are the newer suburbs Lauterborn and Rosenhöhe, Tempelsee, the office town Kaiserlei and the industrial area Waldheim.\n\nEconomy[]\n\nUntil the early 1970s Offenbach was dominated by the machine-building and leather industries. The city hosts the German Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies to this day. The Deutscher Wetterdienst, commonly abbreviated as DWD, (translated from German as German Meteorological Service), residing in the Westend district.\n\nOffenbach was also the European center of typography, with Gebr. Klingspor and Linotype (inventors of Optima or Palatino typeface) moving to nearby Eschborn in the 1970s and MAN Roland printing machines still a major employer today. Typography and design still remain important with a cluster of graphic design and industrial design companies, as well as the university level HfG Offenbach design school and the Klingspor Museum.\n\nIn recent years Offenbach has become a popular location for a wide array of services, especially from the transport sectors. Offenbach is the host to the European headquarters of Honda,[6] Hyundai Motors[7] and Kumho Tires.[8]\n\nMain sights[]\n\nIn Offenbach there is no specific Old Town, but there are several buildings which survived bombing during the war and have been restored. One of them is the Neo-baroque palace Büsingpalais with the Büsingpark, reconstructed in the 1980s. Today it is used as a congress center close to the Sheraton hotel. Between the shopping area and the Main, is the Lilipark and the Lilitemple, named after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's fiancee Lili Schönemann. The most important building is the Isenburger Schloss (de) (Isenburg Palace), a renaissance palace from 1576. It is today used by the Offenbach Design University which is next to it. There is also a neoclasssic palace in the borough Rumpenheim, the Rumpenheimer Schloss it now serves exclusively as domestic dwellings but the park is public.\n\nIsenburger Schloss, a Renaissance building, now used by the Offenbach Design University\n\nBüsingpalais with Büsingpark\n\nWilhelmsplatz a square with coffee houses and three times a week a market.\n\nBuildings of the French Protestant Church and the French Protestant Community.\n\nRumpenheim Palace.\n\nFormer Synagogue \"Capitol\" (now a concert hall next to the new Synagogue).\n\nThe Westend Quarter (19th century).\n\nSeveral art deco apartment houses.\n\nBuildings by early 20th century architect Hugo Eberhardt: \"Heyne\" Factory, main building of the Design University, AOK Insurance building.\n\nPrefabricated houses by Egon Eiermann in Lauterborn\n\nCulture[]\n\nThere are several festivals in Offenbach, some of these are:\n\nLichterfest im Büsing-Park (festival of lights in the park of the Büsing palais)\n\nNacht der Museen (with Frankfurt)\n\nMainuferfest\n\nCross Media Night\n\nMuseums[]\n\nGerman Leather Museum\n\nKlingspor Museum, museum of typography and calligraphy\n\nHaus der Stadtgeschichte, municipal historical museum\n\nRosenheim-Museum for the painter Bernd Rosenheim\n\nGallery[]\n\nPopulation history[]\n\nUntil the end of the 17th century, Offenbach remained a small town with less than a thousand habitants. With the coming into power of the earl Johann Philipp in 1685, the city began to develop and the population rose steadily. In the 19th century the city became industrialized and the population increased even tenfold.[9] Offenbach is one of the German cities where Germans without migrant background make up a minority of the population. As of 31 December 2012, approx. 44.3% of residents or 55,047 people had no foreign background.

Some areas, especially around the shopping streets, are pedestrian-only streets. There are numerous car parks located throughout the city. The Offenbacher Kreuz is an Autobahn interchange where the Autobahnen A 3 (Cologne-Würzburg) and A 661 meet. The A661 crosses the A 3 (Cologne-Würzburg) and A 5 (Basel-Hannover).\n\nPublic transport[]\n\nThe city is connected by a major line of the S-Bahn railway system to Frankfurt. The station in the city center is Marktplatz. In general, six stations are located in Offenbach: Offenbach-Kaiserlei, Offenbach-Ledermuseum, Offenbach-Marktplatz, Offenbach-Ost, Offenbach-Bieber, Offenbach-Waldhof. Trains run every 5-10 minutes between Offenbach and Frankurt. A 24 hours Service between both cities was introduced in 2013. The journey from Offenbach Marktplatz to Frankfurt Main Station takes 15 minutes, Frankfurt Airport can be reached within 26 minutes.
