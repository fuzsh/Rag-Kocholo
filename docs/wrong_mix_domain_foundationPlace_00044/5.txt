This directory (the “old directory”) is a historical record consisting of digital scans of paper forms used by service providers to designate agents with the U.S. Copyright Office to receive notifications of claims of copyright infringement pursuant to section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) under interim regulations that were in effect between November 3, 1998 and November 30, 2016. On December 1, 2016, the interim regulations were superseded by new regulations governing the use of a new online registration system through which all DMCA agent designations must now be made. All designations contained in the old directory were made prior to December 1, 2016, and as of January 1, 2018, have expired and are no longer valid.
