        "text": "Bari is a coastal city and the capital of the Puglia region, Southern Italy. It is nestled on the Adriatic Sea, with a population of over 320,000, and receives hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. It has a fascinating and complicated history dating back to the Bronze Age.\n\nThough not a major tourist destination in Italy, Bari has much to offer historians, art enthusiasts, and nature lovers. You can tour a local museum or an art gallery in the city center, head to one of the scenic beaches, explore historic sites, and lose yourself in the winding streets of the Old Town Bari Vecchia. For foodies, Apulian cuisine is a must-try with simple ingredients with rich flavors, like tiella and focaccia barese.\n\nSatisfy your wanderlust during the peak tourist season from June through August, though April and early fall are often considered the best time to visit Bari if you’re looking for cheaper flights and accommodation and fewer crowds. But whenever you decide to come, be a smart traveler and protect your belongings by entrusting them with Bounce luggage storage in Bari. It’s a convenient way to enjoy everything the capital has to offer without your heavy bags.\n\nLove discounts and traveling?\n\nSign up for our newsletter and get 10% off your next booking.\n\nIs Bari safe to visit right now?\n\nItaly is one of the world’s most peaceful cities, based on the 2021 Global Peace Index, with a safety score of 1.65. And as part of Italy, Bari is a safe city to travel to. You’ll unlikely become a victim of violent crime, and you’ll be safe in most parts of the town.\n\nLike other cities, Bari isn’t perfect and has the occasional petty theft and minor crimes, like pickpocketing.\n\nKeep in mind that your well-being and the safety of your belongings should be your utmost priority. We’ll provide you with essential travel tips and advice, but still do additional research and use your common sense when visiting Bari, especially if you’re new to traveling. We also recommend that you read your government’s official travel guidelines for the city or country you decide to visit to help you make informed decisions about your travel plans.\n\nTop petty crimes and scams in Bari affecting tourists\n\nItaly is one of the most famous European countries, and most cities here, including Bari, receive many tourists. They are an easy target for thieves and scammers, so if you’re also visiting the city, be wary. Although Bari is still considered safe in general, there are petty crimes and scams here and there. Look at these Bari safety tips to be well informed.\n\nPicture scam\n\nWhile walking around Bari, a local may approach you, asking that you take a picture of them. It may seem like a harmless request and doesn’t require much from you, but this may actually be a scam. After you take the photo and hand the camera back to them, they purposely drop it and demand that you pay for the damages. To avoid this scam, it’s best to refuse any offer to take a photo of you unless you’re confident they’re also tourists. Then you can return the favor by taking their picture.\n\nATM scam\n\nTourists are the main targets of ATM scams in Bari. When making a purchase or withdrawing money, there’s a local bank fee, and scammers take advantage of this. They can talk you into giving their credit or debit card details in the pretense of helping them avoid the additional costs.\n\nThere’s another ATM scam in Bari where you encounter an issue with the machine, and a local will offer to sort it out for you but steals your bank details in the process. If you encounter these people on your trip, politely refuse the stranger’s help. Try getting a credit card with no foreign currency fees and cover the number pad when typing your pin code.\n\nPickpocketing\n\nPickpockets operate around famous tourist destinations, public markets, and other high-traffic areas. Beware of pickpockets and keep your personal items close when you’re in crowded areas. Leaving your belongings with Bounce will also relieve the worry.\n\nVehicle theft\n\nBari has the second-highest number of motor vehicle theft in Italy. If you’re renting a car and driving on your trip, park it in a location with reliable security. You’ll also want to always keep it locked and avoid leaving your valuables unattended inside.\n\nIs Bari safe to travel alone\n\nBari is a safe Italian city for tourists from around the world, whether you’re traveling as a couple, with friends, or alone. Solo female travelers can also leave their worries behind, as Italy is one of the most peaceful countries for women, with a Women’s Peace and Security index score of .842 and ranking 23rd among the best female safety travel destinations in the world on the Bounce Women Travel Safety Index.\n\nBesides the usual caveats of avoiding dark corners or walking alone at night, you can explore the city without experiencing any threat to your safety in Bari. Tourists aren’t at risk of being a victim of violent crime.\n\nSafest neighborhoods in Bari\n\nIf you’re looking for a place to stay, here are the safest Bari neighborhoods to enjoy.\n\nBari-Palese\n\nA quiet neighborhood is a place to be if you want a safe stay in a city. In that case, head to the Palese district. It’s more of a local spot than a tourist destination, so there’s not much in the way of crowds, and thus, fewer safety risks overall. However, this doesn’t mean Bari-Palese doesn’t have anything to offer. In fact, there are several attractions, local shops and restaurants, and beaches in the area for you to enjoy.\n\nCarassi\n\nAnother quiet neighborhood in Bari is the Carassi district. It’s not as crowded as it’s away from the city center, but you can quickly get there via public transportation. Also, Carassi may be quiet but offers several nightlife options, ranging from pubs to bars and clubs. Here, you can have fun without being too worried about your safety.\n\nMurattiano\n\nThe Murattiano or Murat district is a renowned neighborhood in Bari for its entertainment options, many attractions, and proximity to the city center. Compared to the other two, it’s more crowded, but it’s not any less safe. In fact, because of its wide streets and many stations, it provides a safer way to explore the city.\n\nIs Bari public transportation safe?\n\nIt’s not necessary to rent a car when getting around Bari, and some areas are hard to get into because of the narrow streets. Going by public transportation like the train is also not ideal for the same reason and due to their limitations. Preferably, get around Bari by taxi or on foot.\n\nImportant emergency numbers in Bari\n\nIt is always a good idea to plan for any emergencies that may occur during your trip. So before heading off on a Bari adventure, be sure to have the number of proper authorities saved on your phone. You should also be aware of your embassy number because you never know when you’ll need it.\n\nItaly country code: +39\n\nBari area code: 80\n\nMedical Emergency Service: 118\n\nPolice: 113\n\nCarabinieri: 112\n\nFire Department: 115\n\nLocal Tourism Authority: 080.5589745"
