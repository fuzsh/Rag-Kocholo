        "text": "Bari is the capital of Puglia and the third largest city in southern Italy after Naples and Palermo. Almost 350,000 people live here, combined with the hundreds of thousands of people regularly visiting on business or passing through its railway, port, and airport.\n\nBari is big and busy, which doesn’t make it the easiest or most serene place to explore, but to me, it’s the most vibrant, interesting, and authentic place to visit in Puglia, and a visit here gives you a real taste of local culture.\n\nThousands of years of history have left amazing monuments throughout the city, but the past is not the only thing to look for. Bari is a modern city full of energy, and it offers countless events, shows, performances, exhibits, music, etc. It is without a doubt the cultural center of Puglia.\n\nOnce rarely visited and largely described as “unsafe” in the past, Bari’s reputation has changed a lot in recent years and it now sees its fair share of international visitors in addition to domestic ones.\n\nThe city is never overrun by tourists, but it is well accustomed to welcoming foreign guests, so you will find everything you need here: from tiny local shops to high-end boutiques, street food to fine restaurants, simple bars where you can grab a slice focaccia and a cold local beer to fancy cafes with creative cocktails and an aperitivo.\n\nMore Puglia travel info:\n\nIf you could use some help planning your itinerary, schedule a Puglia travel consultation with me!\n\nPrivate guided tours in Puglia\n\nPuglia travel guide\n\nOne week Puglia itinerary\n\n28 fantastic Puglia towns\n\n27 things to know when visiting Puglia\n\nCity guide to Matera\n\nCity guide to Lecce\n\nGuide to the Valle d’Itria\n\nGuide to the Salento peninsula\n\nBest restaurants in Bari\n\nMany visitors to Puglia skip Bari entirely, at the very most using it as a transit point for getting to or departing from the region. This is a mistake, as Bari is well worth visiting and is entirely different from everywhere else you’ll visit in Puglia.\n\nHere 4 reasons why I think every traveler should spend at least a day or two here:\n\n1. The history\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Bari was an important port, which made it a prominent and wealthy city. Pilgrims heading east to Jerusalem would depart from here, and valuable goods from the east such as spices, silk, and exotic items, arrived into the Italian peninsula through the port.\n\nMore than 1,000 years later, a lot of that history is still standing and can be found throughout the city. In more recent history, Bari’s Murat Quarter (especially along Sparano street – the area’s main artery) is an incredible example of 1800’s architecture. As you wander down Sparano street, you’ll pass by the city’s best stores and its finest Art Nouveau buildings.\n\nAnd for those of you interested in WW2-era Italy, just remember that the Allies settled down in Bari and the entire area of the city from the Margherita Theatre (now used for art exhibits) to the old port has stories to tell about the war.\n\n2. Unexpected visitors\n\nBari is a place where east and west meet. Here, the church where the body of Saint Nicholas (yep… Santa!) is buried attracts thousands of people from all over the world, especially from Greek Orthodox countries. This gives an exotic touch to the atmosphere and a bit of foreign flavor.\n\nThere is also a Russian church in Bari and if you listen to the people around you speaking, you might also notice a surprisingly high number of visitors from Eastern Europe. They come for religious reasons, but they stay for the lovely shops, elegant cafes, and beautiful architecture.\n\n3. The cuisine\n\nBari’s old town is still authentic and lively and it’s one of the very few examples of a well-preserved historic center that was never abandoned following WWII. That fact explains why you can still walk around the alleys and notice people cooking, neighbors sitting in front of their homes chatting, and plenty of small neighborhood vendors like barbers, grocers, and butchers.\n\nYou may be wondering “what does that have to do with food?”… Well, since the city’s center remained inhabited and residents never left or spread out elsewhere, their traditions, especially surrounding food, never changed - life simply continued.\n\nBari and its residents revere food, and here you’ll find an abundance of everything. Street food, amazing bakeries making the typical focaccia (be careful for the olive pits – they leave them in!) and fried dough (popizze), incredibly fresh seafood, the now super popular “orecchiette street” where old ladies make handmade pasta, people frying polenta (“sgagliozze”), etc. There is no shortage of options.\n\nThe fish market is a blast to explore, fancy restaurants serve up raw seafood just like sushi, rustic trucks roast meat in front of you (don’t miss the local meat wraps called “braciole”, but check if they are made with horse meat!), octopus panini are on the menu, and even grocery stores will turn a simple sandwich into a masterpiece.\n\nRead more in my guide to Bari’s best restaurants.\n\n4. Logistics & transportation\n\nBari is the central transit point throughout all of Puglia, and it has by far the most connections with the rest of the region and Italy at large. It’s very likely that you’ll wind up in Bari at some point during your trip, so if you’re already here, why not stay a while?\n\nAlso, if you’ve decided to visit Puglia on your own and won’t be renting a car, Bari is the best base from which to explore the rest of the region. While Puglia doesn’t have very good public transportation overall, Bari is the exception to this rule. Bari is right in the middle of the region, and almost all transit passes through here, so you can get to quite a few other cities, towns, and attractions in Puglia via public transportation.\n\nOne word of warning for anyone who decides to rent a car and stay here: the traffic can be quite heavy and drivers can be a bit of a challenge, so you’ll need to take your time and go with the flow.\n\nHow to get here\n\nBeing a major transportation hub for Puglia and southern Italy in general, Bari is extremely well connected and very easy to get to. The city has an international airport that is connected to all the major capitals of Europe and other large cities in Italy.\n\nIf you’re arriving to Italy from outside of Europe, however, you will likely first fly into Rome or Milan and will then have to decide how you want to continue on to Bari: either by a short domestic flight, a train ride, or renting a car and driving down.\n\nDomestic flights\n\nDomestically within Italy, Bari’s airport is connected with Rome, Milan, Venice, Bologna, and Pisa. Rome and Milan offer by far the most connections, with multiple flights every day arriving into Bari from each destination.\n\nFlights take 1.5 hours from Milan and 1 hour from Rome, and tickets typically cost between 20 and 150 euros.\n\nArriving by train\n\nIf you’ll be traveling elsewhere in Italy before coming to Bari, it’s likely that the train will be the best way to reach the city. Bari has frequent direct daily connections with Rome, and can also be reached from Milan, Venice, Florence, Bologna (as well as other major cities throughout Italy), albeit most of those trips will require changing trains in Rome.\n\nTrenitalia, Italy’s national rail carrier, runs high-speed Frecciarossa trains run from Rome to Bari, with about 6 daily departures. The journey takes around 4 hours and tickets can cost as little as 15 euros if purchased in advance. Italo, a private train company, also runs high-speed trains.\n\nYou can also reach Bari from Naples by train, but the journey is very slow (it’s mostly run by Regionale trains which make frequent stops) and you will need to make a change in the city of Caserta.\n\nGenerally, if coming from Naples or the Amalfi Coast, the better option is to take a bus, which will take around 3.5 hours and can cost as little as 5 euros.\n\nWhere to buy train tickets\n\nIt’s always best to book your trains directly with Trenitalia or Italo, but if you want to compare options from both companies, the aggregator website Omio is really easy to use and has a good interface. It shows routes and options for trains, buses, ferries, and even flights from a host of different companies and lets you keep all your bookings in one place.\n\nRenting a car\n\nIf you’ll be arriving to Bari as your first stop in Puglia and planning a road trip from there, I’d recommend picking up your car at Bari Airport. It has the largest selection of rental cars in Puglia, with both big and local companies.\n\nBecause parking is limited in Bari, driving in town is stressful, and the city is very walkable, you don’t want a car while visiting. Instead, you should get your car on the day you leave town. The airport is a short drive outside of town so a taxi to the car rental location won’t cost you much and you’ll also be able to get straight on the highway, avoiding city center driving. This will save you money and a lot of stress!\n\nWhere to book your rental\n\nTo check prices and book, I recommend using DiscoverCars. It’s a car rental website that includes offerings from all the major international rental companies as well as lots of smaller local agencies, which often have much better pricing. You can often find great deals.\n\nI use it myself and have always had good experiences.\n\nIf you look at Bari on a map and find the central train station, you’ll notice that the railway line sort of cuts the city in two, creating one side to the north, and another to the south. At the far end of the northern half of the city, the other boundary is the Adriatic sea, and this area between it and the railway lines is where I would suggest that you stay.\n\nCloser to the train station and rail lines is the area called Murat, which is a bit more modern, while the area toward the sea, Bari Vecchia, is older and more historical.\n\nBari Vecchia is charming and full of locals. All the buildings are historical and there is lots of action all throughout the day. Murat, is where all the shopping is, as well as the modern restaurants, bars, and high-end cafes.\n\nGenerally speaking, I would say that if you are going to stay for only one day, being closer to the old town is a must. However, if you are planning to stay longer, then you could consider staying in Murat, which has a bit more of the comforts and convenience of modern life.\n\nPersonally, I really like the area by the sea, just outside of the old town, where there are a lot of very cool places to go for a meal or a drink.\n\nThere are all kinds of accommodation options in Bari, from budget to high-end, but bear in mind that most visitors to the city are here on business rather than vacation, so hotels are often geared toward business travelers. This means that it’s not super common to find charming boutique hotels.\n\nRecommended hotels:\n\nVis Urban Suites is a new hotel with a very boutique feel, a good on-site spa, and excellent breakfast. The rooms are lovely and stylish and the location in the Murat neighborhood is very convenient; a few minutes’ walk to both Bari’s main shopping streets and the old town. It’s certainly one of the nicest options in the city. Rooms start at $300 per night.\n\nDilman Luxury Stay in Murat bills itself as a luxury hotel. The location is great, but the design is a bit particular; very modern with clean lines and lots of white. It’s not my personal taste, but I get the appeal. You can typically find a room for $300 USD.\n\nJR Hotels Bari Grande Albergo delle Nazioni is a nice modern hotel just by the waterfront and a quick walk to Bari Vecchia. Rooms cost around $220 USD a night.\n\nPalazzo Calò is inside of Bari Vecchia and offers pretty studios with kitchenettes. The design is stylishly rustic with exposed wood beams and stone walls. Nightly rates run between $220 and 350 USD depending on the season.\n\nAl Pescatore B&B at the edge of Bari Vecchia and just behind the Castelo Svevo is a cute option at a reasonable price. Rooms are modern, spacious, and airy and the staff is knowledgeable and helpful. Rates range from $150-200 USD.\n\nTravel B&B is a charming little bed and breakfast in a great location for shopping, eating, and people watching. It overlooks a leafy square and is only a 2-minute walk from the train station. Figure that you’ll pay around $150 a night.\n\nB&B Murex in the old town is clean, comfortable, and excellently located. But be aware that there is no elevator, so you have to be ok potentially carrying your bags up the stairs. Rates from around $100 USD."
