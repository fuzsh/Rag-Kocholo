        "text": "The Catepanate (or Catapanate) of Italy (Greek: κατεπανίκιον Ἰταλίας Katepaníkion Italías) was a province of the Byzantine Empire, comprising mainland Italy south of a line drawn from Monte Gargano to the Gulf of Salerno. Amalfi and Naples, although north of that line, maintained allegiance to Constantinople through the catepan. The Italian region of Capitanata derives its name from the Catepanate.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn 873, the Byzantines retook Bari from the Saracens. Along with the already existing theme of Calabria, the region of Apulia, around Bari, formed a new theme, that of Longobardia. In ca. 965, a new theme, that of Lucania, was established, and the stratēgos (military governor) of Bari was raised to the title of katepanō of Italy, usually with the rank of patrikios. The title of katepanō meant \"the uppermost\" in Greek. This elevation was deemed militarily necessary after the final loss of nearby Sicily, a previously Byzantine possession, to the Arabs.\n\nSome Norman adventurers, on pilgrimage to Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano, lent their swords in 1017 to the Lombard cities of Apulia against the Byzantines. From 1016 to 1030 the Normans were pure mercenaries, serving either Byzantine or Lombard, and then Duke Sergius IV of Naples, by installing their leader Ranulf Drengot in the fortress of Aversa in 1030, gave them their first foot hold and they began an organized conquest of the land. In 1030 there arrived William and Drogo, the two eldest sons of Tancred of Hauteville, a petty noble of Coutances in Normandy. The two joined in the organized attempt to wrest Apulia from the Byzantines, who had lost most of that province by 1040. Bari was captured by the Normans in April 1071, and Byzantine authority was finally terminated in Italy, five centuries after the conquests of Justinian I. The Byzantines returned briefly to besiege Bari in 1156.\n\nThe title Catapan of Apulia and Campania was revived briefly in 1166 for Gilbert, Count of Gravina, the cousin of the queen regent Margaret of Navarre. In 1167, with his authority as catapan, Gilbert forced German troops out of the Campania and compelled Frederick Barbarossa to raise the siege of Ancona.\n\nCatepans[]\n\n970 – 975 Michael Abidelas\n\nbefore 982 Romanos\n\n982 – 985 Kalokyros Delphinas\n\n985 – 988 Romanos\n\n988 – 998 John Ammiropoulos\n\n999 – 1006 Gregory Tarchaneiotes\n\n1006 – 1008 Alexius Xiphias\n\n1008 – 1010 Ioannes Curcuas\n\n1010 – 1016 Basil Mesardonites\n\nMay 1017 – December 1017 Leo Tornikios Kontoleon\n\nDecember 1017 – 1027 Basil Boioannes\n\nc. 1027 – 1029 Christophoros Burgaris\n\nJuly 1029 – June 1032 Pothos Argyros\n\n1032 – May 1033 Michael Protospatharios\n\nMay 1033 – 1038 Constantine Opos\n\n1038 – 1039 Michael Spondyles\n\nFebruary 1039 – January 1040 Nicephorus Doukeianos\n\nNovember 1040 – Summer of 1041 Michael Doukeianos\n\nSummer of 1041 – 1042 Exaugustus Boioannes\n\nFebruary 1042 – April 1042 Synodianos\n\nApril 1042 – September 1042 George Maniakes\n\nAutumn 1042 Pardos\n\nFebruary 1043 – April 1043 Basil Theodorokanos\n\nAutumn of 1045 – September 1046 Eustathios Palatinos\n\nSeptember 1046 – December 1046 John Raphael\n\n1050 – 1058 Argyrus\n\n1060 Miriarch\n\n1060 – 1061 Maruli\n\n1062 Sirianus\n\n1064 Perenus\n\n1066 – 1069 Michael Maurex\n\n1069 – 1071 Avartuteles\n\n1071 Stephen Pateran\n\nSee also[]\n\nMagna Graecia\n\nGrecìa Salentina\n\nSources[]"
