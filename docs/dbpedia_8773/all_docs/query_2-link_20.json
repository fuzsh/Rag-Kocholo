        "text": "Questions concerning the birth and development of Lombard Capua have been mainly based on Nicola Cilento’s historiographic works: politics and economics evolution about beginning and enlargement of the Lordship of Capua have been deeply analyzed by the distinguished scholar who also understood how an archaeological approach could increase the knowledge of Medieval Capua through examination of material evidence. However, as we read the copious Capuanian bibliography, we cannot avoid noticing that Cilento’s suggest has been wholly ignored, with rare exceptions, and Capua’s Lombard facies still do not include archaeological contributions, partially due - obviously - to the objective lack of excavations’ projects.\n\nThe history of Tuscany during the Middle Ages has been a topic of great interest for many Italian and foreign scholars since at least the beginning of the nineteenth century. Research on the subject has thrived because of this Italian region's exceptional dynamics and high level of urbanization during the XIIth to XIVth centuries, which are practically unique from the political and the economic standpoints, and because of its social structure and its cultural heritage. The paper tries to explain the reasons for the great demographic, economic and social development of Tuscan cities in the city-states age, comparing the situation of major agglomerations with the one of important towns. The text analyzes the massive increase in urban production, trade and banking at an international level, connected to the control of agricultural resources coming from cities' countryside. Attention is also paid to the civic religion, to the historical culture and to political rules of the most important communities, to show the peculiarities of the region on the eve of the Renaissance. The history of Tuscany during the Middle Ages has been a topic of great interest for many Italian and foreign scholars since at least the beginning of the nineteenth century 2. Research on the subject has thrived because of this Italian region's exceptional dynamics, which are practically unique from the political and the economic standpoints, and because of its social structure and its cultural heritage 3. Moreover, these dynamics are well described in many, particularly thirteenth-and fourteenth-century, archive documents and memorialists' accounts.\n\nWith the arrival of the Lombards in the Italian peninsula (AD 568), the region between Lazio and Campania, geographically characterised by the presence of the Garigliano and Volturno River Valleys flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea, starts to be configured as a ‘borderland’. Indeed, more than a real frontier, this wide area, located between the Roman towns of Aquinum and Capua, would play the role of a buffer zone between the Lombard Duchies of Spoleto and Benevento and the Duchy of Rome, namely part of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna, practically ruled by the popes of Rome. A revision of former studies and a new season of research are bringing to light a composite reality, where conversion of economic activities, transformations of settlement patterns, acculturation phenomena, alteration of the social and ethnical assets, and changes in the communication networks occurred in towns and countryside. This paper presents this new data and discusses the changes, focusing on the period between the infiltration and the settling of the Lombards (during the last 30 years of the 6th century AD) and the arrival of the Carolingians (at the start of the 9th century).\n\nThis work presents a temporary settlement analysis of Casentino and Valtiberina, from the 7th to the 5th century BCE. During this period, these regions may have constituted an area of Apennine interconnectivity. Over time, they became the hinterland to one or more local political entities. To demonstrate these points, I begin by creating a theoretical model of the relationship between aristocratic and civic networks and the movement of professional artisans in the hinterland. The activity of these professionals in Casentino and Valtiberina becomes clear through singling out relevant patterns in material culture and building techniques. The final diachronic analysis of these patterns shows a drastic change in local settlement strategies in the middle of the 6th century BCE. This change can be related to simultaneous processes recorded along the rest of the Tiber Valley, perhaps resulting from the political influence of Clusium and its allies. To conclude, two different areas of settl..."
