        "text": "How were people of those southern italian kingdoms called during the middle ages and later, before the unification of Italy?\n\nI heard that \"Sicilians\" but would people who lived in non-Sicilian parts of the kingdom also called so? And similarly unlikely for them to be called Italians, if only by some distant foreigners.\n\nOr there was not a single term and they were called by corresponding region - Sicily, Naples, Apulia etc?\n\nIt's quite difficult, as for a large part of that time, southern Italy and Sicily was muslim, so whatever they were called it would be in arabic, for example\n\nThe Emirate of Sicily (Arabic: إِمَارَة صِقِلِّيَة, romanized: ʾImārat Ṣiqilliya) was an Islamic kingdom that ruled the island of Sicily from 831 to 1091.[2] Its capital was Palermo (Arabic: Bal'harm), which during this period became a major cultural and political center of the Muslim world.[3]\n\nAfter that it was a Norman territory for a long period\n\nIn Latin documents it became common to make reference to a beacon [if I remember well, the one of Messina] to differentiate between Siciliae \"citra Pharum\" and \"ultra Pharum\".\n\nSo that there was a Regnum Siciliae citra Pharum [Naples] and a Regnum Siciliae ultra Pharum [proper Sicily].\n\nBut obviously these were official legal definitions. I guess common people was less accurate and that they use their dialectal terms.\n\nIt's quite difficult, as for a large part of that time, southern Italy and Sicily was muslim, so whatever they were called it would be in arabic, for example\n\nThe Emirate of Sicily (Arabic: إِمَارَة صِقِلِّيَة, romanized: ʾImārat Ṣiqilliya) was an Islamic kingdom that ruled the island of Sicily from 831 to 1091.[2] Its capital was Palermo (Arabic: Bal'harm), which during this period became a major cultural and political center of the Muslim world.[3]\n\nAfter that it was a Norman territory for a long period\n\nYes, although I was talking particularly about the Kingdom of Sicily, that was created by Normans some time after the conqest of those lands, when there was no emirate anymore, and no Longobard or Byzantine possessions in the mainland.\n\nthe confusing bit about south italy is that one of the byzantine themata was called longobardia [Λογγοβαρδία] and so when we read about longobards as in raoul de caen (bohemond' crusaders) or anna komnena (guiscard' invasion) levied by the normans we are actually reading of apulians and not north italians; nonetheless they must have been part of the early norman armies as skylitzes does not simply use an ambiguous ethnonym when he describes where the auxiliaries came from; fulcher of chartres lists for the first crusade 'itali' and 'apuli' the latter surly an ethnonym for south italians\n\non sicily the people of the kingdom were referred to by their ethnonym eg saracen, latin or greek a miniature showing scribes of each group; saracen was an exonym for a muslim which on sicily incl (nisbas) arabs, berbers, persians and local converts when the last muslims of sicily were relocated (after two long rebellions in west sicily) into lucera the town was called Lucaera Saracenorum; latin applied to christian settlers chiefly the normans and lombardians (north italian settlers)\n\nin the two sicilies 1800s south italians and sicilians were referred to as italians or each as neapolitans and sicilians; during spanish rule people from south italy were usually referred to as 'napolitanos' (cf Tercio napolitano de Torralto) and the neapolitan language was infact next to tuscan the only other language with a literary tradition in italy incl one of the earliest compilations of fairy tales notably 'puss in boots' and 'rapunzel'\n\non a sidenote\n\nsicilian identity became very strong during the 1848 revolution when bourbon rule was de facto overthrown jan-mar and beacem a quasi idnependent state for a good year; it might have been called 'two sicilies' but the island was severly neglected under bourbon rule centered in naples; in 1837 a cholora epedemic cost the lives of >70k people on the island; in sept 48 carlo filangieri was dispatched with ~10-15k neapolitan troops to crush the revolution and regain sicily for the bourbon regime the campaign lasted until apr 49; the sicilians adaopted the triskelion (trinacria) as their symbol of revolution (+tricolor) and independence vs the bourbon regime [prints from the revolution messina 48 / catania 49]\n\nThough spanish Habsburgs used the title \"Rex utriusque Siciliae\" (King of both Sicilies), there was no integration between the kingdom of Naples and the kingdom of Sicily, remaining separate kingdoms with their own laws and institutions, and in the aragonese tradition, each one was assigned a viceroy. In an upper level, both kingdoms and the duchy of Milan were administered by the Council of Italy\n\nIt seems, that after the break of the old norman kingdom of Sicily in two, where both kingdoms claimed the formal name of Sicily, the kingdom that comprised the island of Sicily and the maltese archipielago was sometimes called kindom of Trinacria, but it doesn´t seem to be a name that would hold on."
