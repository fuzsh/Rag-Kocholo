All attempts to unite the ancient Empire crashed in 568 with the arrival of an “invader” people: the Longobards. Since that moment the history of Italy will no longer be the same.\n\nThe “long-bearded men” kick off the long period of political fragmentation of the Peninsula that lasts until the Risorgimento. But the story of this people is also the story of great economic and social challenges, relations and mediations between the Mediterranean and Northern Europe, centuries of wars and clashes, strategic alliances and cultural contamination between different populations and great personalities. An epic that saw Pavia become the capital of the Kingdom of Longobardo and southern Italy, with the Benevento Duchy, memory and heritage until more than half of the XI century of the pavilion dominated by Charlemagne in 774.\n\nOver 300 works from more than 80 museums and Italian and foreign service providers are ready to unveil the great history of the Longobards. A journey through the crucial moments of the Longobard saga made even more unique by the multimedia insights accompanying the visitor on display: holograms, video and touchscreen.\n\nA great international event in three locations, the first stage of which is Pavia, which is ideally capital for one of the most original exhibitions ever made on the Longobards.\n\nVisconteo Castle in Pavia, Italy from 1 September to 3 December 2017\n\nAntonio Gala"
