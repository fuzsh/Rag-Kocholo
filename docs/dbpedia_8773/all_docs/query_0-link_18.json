        "text": "In Roman times the provinces of Apulia & Calabria and Lucania were a part of Italia suburbarica\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire southern Italy became a part of the Empire of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great. In 552 it was captured by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian who made it a part of the Prefectureof Italy (552-569) whcih soon declined into the exarchate of Ravenna. Byzantine domination was challenged for a long time by the Lombards (569-759) who annexed the area of Cosenza to their Duchy of Benevento but had to cede their position to the Franks. From then to the Norman conquest of the 11th century, the south of the peninsula was constantly plunged into wars between The Byzantine Empire, the Frankish kingdom of Italy, and the Islamic Caliphate. The latter established several Islamic states in southern Italy, such as the Emirate of Sicily and Emirate of Bari. Amalfi, an independent republic from the 7th century until 1075, and to a lesser extent Gaeta, Molfetta, and Trani, rivalled other Italian maritime republics in their domestic prosperity and maritime importance.\n\nIn 873, the Byzantines retook Bari from the Saracens. Along with the already-existing theme of Calabria, the region of Apulia, around Bari, a new theme was formed, that of Longobardia. In ca. 965, a new theme, that of Lucania, was established, and the stratēgos (military governor) of Bari was raised to the title of katepanō of Italy, usually with the rank of patrikios. The title of katepanō meant \"the uppermost\" in the Greek language. From 970 until 1071 there have ben some 33 catepans\n\nThe Catepanate of Italy, comprised mainland Italy south of a line drawn from Monte Gargano to the Gulf of Salerno. Amalfi and Naples, although north of that line, maintained allegiance to Constantinople through the catepan. The Italian region of Capitanata derives its name from the Catepanate.\n\nSome Norman adventurers, on pilgrimage to Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano, lent their swords in 1017 to the Lombard cities of Apulia against the Byzantines. From 1016 to 1030 the Normans were pure mercenaries, serving either Byzantines or Lombards, and then Sergius IV of Naples, by installing the leader Ranulf Drengot in the fortress of Aversa in 1030, gave them their first pied-à-terre and they began an organized conquest of the land. In 1030 there arrived William and Drogo, the two eldest sons\n\nAs the Longobard kingdom to which the mainland and the island belonged for a long time, were strongly influenced by the Roman Empire it is probable that the eagles were maintained for certain offices but nothing is known sofar about it. However we may suppose that the Byzantine empire reintroduced the heraldic system consisting of an eagle, a griffin, and a lion for the three most important offcials. [1]\n\nOf the exarchs of Ravenna many tombs have been preserved showing christograms supported by peacocks, which are the emblems of a prefect, the christogram symbolizing his military authority. In other instances the tombs are decorated with a crux immissa (consisting of a latin cross and the greek letter P) which is the emblem of a bishop or archbishop.\n\nThe emblem of the catepans, who were of a lower rank, however seems to have been an eagle, depending of their title of patrikios.In the 11th century this eagle seems to have been multicoloured as is demonstrated by this detail of a 11c. enamel, with some probability portraying one of the last catepans of Italy.\n\nIn the central enamel from this XI- XII c. icon, purchased in Rome and, according to the seller, coming from Southern Italy, is a crucifixion with four figures, the one on the right a bearded soldier with a norman shield blasoned with an eagle (or bird) within a broad border set with precious stones. His blue mantle is strewn with golden hearts. His head is covered with a white kerchief. [2]\n\nThe use of the eagle is confirmed, be it not directly by a catepan, by the episcopal seat of Canosa di Puglia cathedral, which shows two eagles guardant.\n\nOn the mainland there are some other 11th century testimonies that a eagle-griffin-lion heraldic system was used. These can be found on the façades of churches and on some thrones.\n\nKingdom of Sicily 1130 - 1282\n\nChanging the Ruling House (1253-1266).\n\nIn 1253 the Sicilian crown was offered to Charles of Anjou who refused at first. In 1254 the Pope made a new offer to Henry III of England who accepted for his nine-year old son Edmund (Crouchback), r. Attempts to capture the kingdom from King Conrad IV and King Manfred were fruitless and in 1263 the offer was retired by the Pope. Edmund, when an Earl of Lancaster and Leicester used a very peculiar seal showing a lion tricorporate which is a lion with three bodies radiating from one head respecting. It is on his seal of 1273 with the legendSigillvm Edmvndi Filii. [4] This lion tricorporate was perhaps inspired by the Sicilian triquetra and in that case it may have been adopted to the memory of te time he was a pretender of the Sicilian crown. On the other hand it can as well be inspired by the triskeles of the King of Man which apeared in about the same time.\n\nOn 28 june 1265 Pope Clemens IV enfeoffed Charles of Anjou with the Kingdom all te same and the next year he could take possession of his kingdom.\n\nArms of Charles I according to Walfords Roll.\n\nBeing the fifth son of King Louis VIII of France Charles bore at first a semy with fleurs de lys within a bordure of Castile (of his mother Blanche of Castile). After his elder brother Robert had died in 1250 and his mother in 1252, he changed these arms into: Azure strewn with fleurs de lys Or, a label Gules. These arms are documented for the first time in Bigot roll (1254) where it is mentioned as Li quens d'Aion, l'escu d'azur a fleurs de lis dor semees au lablel de geules. Baneres et Angevins (the people from Anjou, the blue shield strewn with golden fleurs de lys and a red label. Banneret and Angevins). It is on the reverse of his royal seal.\n\nSeal of Charles I of Sicily\n\nObverse: Charles on his throne with lily-sceptre and globe L.: X karolvs  dei  gracia  sicilie  rex.\n\nReverse: Arms: [Azure] 10 fleurs de lys 4.3.3.1. [Or] and a label of three [Gules]. L.(continues r°): X DVCATVS  APVLIE PRINCIPAT CAPVE.\n\nThe same arms are documented by Wijnbergen Roll (n° 1260), the label of four, and Walfords Roll: Le Roy de Sicilie, d'azure poudre a florets d'or un labell gules[5]\n\nOn 18 March 1277 Mary of Antioch sold her rights on the throne of Jeruzalem to Charles for 1000 pieces of gold and an annuity of £ 4000 tournois. [6] The same year coins were minted under his personal supervision showing the arms of Jeruzalem impaled with the arms of France dimidiated. The arms were crested with a crescent which was the Byzantine symbol of the state.\n\nThe reason why the label was omitted probably was that the impaling of the arms was enough to distinguish the arms from the royal arms of France. Later the label was often omitted in the impaled arms but when not the label was always added.\n\nThe simple coat of arms is also at his feet on his tomb in St. Denis Cathedral, coming from the ancient church of the Jacobins.\n\nThe Sicilians on the island rebelled in 1282 against the feudal rule of Charles at the famous Sicilian Vespers. Initially they tried to establish a civil government but when a request to the Pope was rejected the Sicilians adressed themselves to Pedro III of Aragon who had a claim on the kingdom through his wife Constance, a daughter of King Manfred. When Pedro III (I in Sicily) accessed the throne in Palermo the kingdom was actually divided because nor Pedro nor Charles could take possession of the entire kingdom. This division in a Sicily-Trinacria and a Sicily-Naples was later formalized by several treaties.\n\nAs the arms of Charles were his personal arms and had nothing to do with the kingdom itself, the division of the kingdom had no effect on it.\n\nCharles II was succeeded by his son Robert who is the ancestor of the short line of the House of Anjou-Naples. The arms of Robert were the simple arms of the fleurs de lys and a label, the label moved to the upper rim of the shield. These arms are on his seal:\n\nReverse of the seal of Robert, 1317\n\nObverse: The king on his throne with crown, sceptre and orb. L.: X ROBERT[US]  DEI GR[ATI]A  REX I[E]R[USA]L[EM] SICIL[IE] DUCAT[US] APU[LIE] P[RINCIPAT[US] CAPUE\n\nReverse: Arms, strewn with fleurs de lys a label of four in chief. L.: X PROUI[N]CIE FORCALQUERII AC PEDIMONTIS COMES. [7]\n\nArms of Gubbio, of the church and of Robert of Anjou\n\nAbove the entrance of the Palazzo dei Consoli in Gubbio (1332-36).\n\nNevertheless there is also an impaled version of his arms above the entrance of the Duomo in Altamura (rebuild after 1316), the fleurs de lys - no label - in the first and the cross in the second this time.\n\nOmdat Johanna ook na haar huwelijken met Jacob van Majorca in 1363 en Otto van Brunswijk in 1376 kinderloos bleef, adopteerde zij een verre neef, Lodewijk van Anjou-Valois als erfgenaam. In 1378 koos zij na het kerkelijke schisma de kant van de tegenpaus Clemens VII. Door Urbanus VI werd zij daarop van haar leen vervallen verklaard en in haar plaats werd Karel van Anjou-Durazzo tot koning benoemd. Ondanks de tegenstand van Lodewijk van Anjou-Valois die door Johanna te hulp werd geroepen, bezette Karel in 1381 Napels en liet zich daar tot Koning Karel III kronen. Het volgende jaar liet hij Johanna terechtstellen.\n\nHis arms from the time of the rule of Joanna are in the Armorial de Gelre.[8] They are:\n\nArms: Azure, strewn with fleurs de lys Or, and a bordure compony Gules and Argent.\n\nAs a king of Naples he impaled these arms with the arms of Jeruzalem. This can be seen on a picture of the siege of Naples in 1381 where Queen Joanna and her husband Otto of Brunswick-Grubenhagen were captured and imprisoned. On the picture are the banners of of his allies Hungary and the Holy See, which both had send armies to help Charles, and the banner of Charles himself. Also there is the banner of his adversary Otto of Brunswick.\n\nThe Conquest of Naples by Charles of Durazzo (detail)\n\nMaster of Charles of Durazzo. Coll. Metropolitan Museum of Art n° 07.120.1\n\nThe banners are:\n\n1. For Naples: Per pale, the first strewn with fleurs de lys within a bordure company Gules and Argent for Anjou-Durazzo; the second Argent strewn with square crosses a cross moline Or for Jeruzalem. And a streamer Azure, fleurs de lys Or.\n\n2. For the Holy See: Gules, two crosses in saltire Azure connected with a cord Or. And a streamer Azure eight-pointed stars Or.\n\n3. For Hungary: Per pale, the first barry Argent and Gules for Arpad; the second Azure, strewn with fleurs de lys Or for Anjou. And a streamer Azure, fleurs de lys Or.\n\n4. For Brunswick: Gules, two lions passant Or. And a streamer Azure eight-pointed stars Or.\n\nIn the lower right hand corner is a portrait of Charles.\n\nIn 1383 Charles III was chased away from Naples by Louis I of Anjou Valois. Louis, however died the next year and Charles could return without resistance.\n\nInitially the arms of Louis were\n\nArms: Azure, strewn with fleurs de lys Or, a bordure Gules.\n\nThese arms are on his seal dated 19 May1374 with the legend CONTRASI­GILLUM LUDOVICI REGIS FRANCORUM FILII DUCIS A... COMITIS CENOMANIE. [9]\n\nWhen appointed successor of Joanne I he could impale his arms with Jeruzalem. This he seems to have done on these arms in the Armorial de Gelre:\n\nArms: 1|2: 1. Jeruzalem; 2. Anjou with a label of three Gules.\n\nCrest: On a helmet lambrequined Azure strewn with fleurs de lys a crown and a three-dimensional fleur de lys plumed Gules.\n\nL.: Aenyouwen. [10]\n\nThese arms seem to have been corrected by erasing parts of the bordure and the label, resulting in a parti of Anjou-Naples and Anjou-Valois. This may have been done when he effectively was a king of Naples (1383-84).\n\nCharles III departed for Hungary in 1385 to be a successor of Louis the Great as a co-regent of Mary, the daughter of Louis. A few month later however he was taken prisoner and murdered by order of Queen Mary.\n\nHis arms used when a pretender of the crown of Hungary combined the arms of the Arpad family for Hungary and the arms of France and Jeruzalem, thus uniting the arms of Anjou-Naples and Anjou-Hungary.\n\n.\n\nPhoto H.d.V.\n\nArms of Charles III (II of Hungary) on a façade of a house in the Mezzocannone in Naples.\n\nThe arms are:\n\nArms: tierced per pale of Arpad, France and Jeruzalem\n\nCrest: On a helmet lambrequined [Azure] strewn with fleurs de lys [Or], a crown supported by two angels descending from the clouds and an elephants head issuant.\n\nThe field strewn with eight-pointed stars. The arms are a quasi-achievement the crown supported by two angels meaning: crowned by the grace of God (in fact: by the grace of Pope Urban VI).\n\nHis achievement showed his crowned arms supported by two angels.\n\nThe Achievement of Charles III on the Cappella Sta Margherita in Tropea (V.V)"
