        "text": "Are you planning a trip to Puglia with a brief stop in Bari? While there are many spectacular destinations in the region, don’t forget to explore Bari itself!\n\nBari, the capital of Puglia, is a vibrant port city with a rich history and a lively contemporary scene. Here are the must-sees and must-dos in less than 1 day.\n\nMorning\n\nBasilica di San Nicola\n\nStart your day with a visit to this stunning 12th-century church, a masterpiece of Romanesque architecture and a pilgrimage site for both Catholics and Orthodox Christians. This church holds a special charm as the resting place of Saint Nicholas, the guardian of the city.\n\nBari Vecchia (Old Town)\n\nWander through the narrow streets of the old town. Don’t miss the chance to see the local ladies making orecchiette pasta by hand, and be sure to visit Largo Albicocca for an authentic taste of local life. Don’t forget to indulge in local delights and street food like panzerotti or sgagliozze (a type of fried polenta).\n\nCattedrale di San Sabino\n\nExplore this beautiful cathedral and marvel at its architectural details and the sense of peace within its walls.\n\nVia Sparano\n\nThe authentic shopping street of Bari, Via Sparano is a vibrant thoroughfare, bustling with boutiques and shops offering everything from luxury fashion to foodie souvenirs. You’ll also find charming bars and cafes along the way, perfect for a leisurely break during your shopping.\n\nAfternoon\n\nCastello Normanno Svevo di Bari\n\nVisit this imposing castle built by the Normans and delve into the history of Bari’s defenses.\n\nPiazza Mercantile & Piazza del Ferrarese\n\nThese lively squares are perfect for a midday break. Enjoy a coffee and watch the world go by.\n\nLungomare (Waterfront)\n\nTake a leisurely stroll along this waterfront promenade and soak in the breathtaking views of the Adriatic Sea. Why not enhance the experience by savoring some delicious focaccia as you enjoy the scenery?\n\nN’derr la Lanz\n\nThis charming area got its name from the local dialect, meaning “under the boats.” It used to be where fishermen docked their wooden boats, called “lanz,” and sold their catch right on the shore. Nowadays, it’s a vibrant spot where you can experience the city’s energy, with locals playing cards, having a beer at the iconic “El Chiringuito,” and enjoying the fresh catch of the day.\n\nEvening\n\nTeatro Petruzzelli\n\nInaugurated in 1903, Teatro Petruzzelli survived a devastating fire in 1991 and was carefully restored, maintaining its position as one of Italy’s most prestigious theaters. If you can, attend a show here or simply admire its elegant facade.\n\nDinner in Bari Vecchia\n\nEnd your day with a delicious meal in the old town. Try some local specialties like tiella (a rice, potato, and mussel casserole) or fresh seafood.\n\nNight\n\nPasseggiata\n\nJoin the locals in their evening walk, a tradition that turns the streets into a social scene. It’s the perfect way to digest your dinner and soak up the atmosphere of Bari at night.\n\nIn just 24 hours, you’ll discover that Bari is not just a gateway to Puglia but a captivating destination in its own right. So come and experience the charm of Bari and… Buon viaggio!"
