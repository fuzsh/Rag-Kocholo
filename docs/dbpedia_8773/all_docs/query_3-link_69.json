        "text": "Bari, the special city of Southern Italy\n\nBari is a very charming city, the third-largest city in Southern Italy, in order of the population.\n\nIt’s incredible the contrast between the folkloristic old town and the cozy city center, full of branded shops and polished aristocratic buildings.\n\nA bit of its history\n\nBari city, located in Puglia Region, Southern Italy, in the old days called Barium (Latin name) has been developed on the Adriatic coastline after the Via Traiana was built.\n\nNone knows the exact origins of the town, probably the Bronze Age or a colony of Crete.\n\nSurely it’s developed under the Roman Empire. Then it was dominated by Arabians and Normans but, it reflourished under the Swabian domination when Frederick II has built the magnificent Swabian Castle as a gateway to the old town.\n\nAfter years, all the impressive buildings on the beautiful seafront were built under the Fascist Regime. One of those is the majestic building of Fiera del Levante, the international fair which still gives the city an important and strategic role connecting all the Mediterranean countries.\n\nWell, as y’all imagine, Bari is an ancient city featured by a rich history.\n\nIt’s easy to enjoy the city center and the old village by walk or riding a bike. These slow tours could be the right choice to admire the historical buildings, both religious and residential, rupestrian churches, and hypogea. If you need a suggestion about a company that can provide these kinds of exploring tours, we may advise you to contact Velo Service. They’re masters in walking, bike, rickshaw, and segway tours in Bari and Lecce.\n\nWhile you stroll through the old town narrow streets, you’ll meet the magnificent romanesque Basilica of Saint Nicholas (the city’s patron saint).\n\nIt was built during the 11th century and remodeled several times over the centuries. It is a significant destination for religious tourism.\n\nPilgrims from all over the world come to Bari, especially from Eastern Europe, to pray on the foot of Saint Nicholas’s tomb beside the Russian Orthodox Chapel.\n\nFew steps from the Swabian Castle and the Basilica stands another extraordinary sample of Apulian Romanesque architecture: the Cathedral of Saint Sabinus. The Cathedral, with its baroque crypt, it’s one of the most important jewels of Bari city.\n\nThe Murat district with its posh streets\n\nBari is also famous for its cultural and artistic scene.\n\nClose to the old town, just on the border, there’re many heritage theaters.\n\nThe Petruzzelli Theatre is probably the most iconic for its history and color, but not much more than the Piccinni and Margherita Theatre that became a Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nBari is not only art, history, and ancient culture. In fact, a great social life awaits you.\n\nThe posh Murat district is the modern city center. Via Sparano, Corso Cavour, or Corso Vittorio Emanuele and the streets around them offer many branded shops, attractions, cafes, and restaurants.\n\nFolklore and local food\n\nBari has its own culinary tradition.\n\nAlmost everywhere, you can taste typical Bari food. Focaccia, panzarotti, sgagliozze, popizze are examples of simple and humble street food, but many are the dishes and delicacies. You can taste them in almost all the restaurants, trattoria and osteria in the old town.\n\nOne tip for you!\n\nEvery Sunday, you can taste fresh and raw fish at a little fish market on the jetty Saint Nicholas, also known as N’dèrr’a la lanze. Here you can easily touch the folklore and local culture while you admire the docked typical fishing boats.\n\nWell, writing about Bari city is hard, many places to visit and things to do here.\n\nWe live in Bari, and there are still places we never visited, but it’s an especial city.\n\nIt is a little melting pot: many cultures cohabit in this great city, even if it is a small city compared with the big metropolis.\n\nBari is our own city, and we recommend to sign it on your bucket list. So, come to visit Bari and its beauties.\n\nTo arrange a guided tour or have more info about specific places, just contact the local Info Point using the contact area below."
