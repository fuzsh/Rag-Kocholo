The old town offers winding narrow streets, leading to hidden piazzas and enchanting medieval structures. Among them, the Bari’s Cathedral and St. Nicholas Basilica house interesting legends worth discovering.\n\nNot far off stands the Swabian Castle, a well-conserved architectural jewel showcasing a blend of Byzantine, Norman and Arab designs. Don’t forget to take a walk in the modern part of the city, the Murat district. It’s characterized by wide boulevards, lined with boutique stores and neoclassical buildings.\n\nTake a moment to unwind in Bari’s parks and open spaces, providing a much-needed break from the city buzz. Bari’s beach is a great spot to breathe in the Mediterranean charm.\n\nGastronomical Delights in Bari\n\nA trip to Bari remains incomplete without indulging in the local cuisine. Known for the prevalent use of local produce and seafood, Puglia’s food experience is nothing short of delightful culinary surprises. Don’t miss out on trying orecchiette, a type of pasta typical to Puglia, paired with a glass of local Puglia wine.\n\nMany traditional meals are enjoyed in Masseria, a farmhouse-style eateries common in Puglia.
