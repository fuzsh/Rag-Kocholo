        "text": "The actual geo-administrative constitution of the present Province of Salerno can be traced back as far as the early Middle Ages with Charles II of Anjou. After its secessionfrom the Principality of Benevento and Salerno with/decreed by the âLongobardia minorâ in 849 the territory of Salerno, magnificently and barbarically constituted as it was by the Lombards â with Guaimario V (1027-1052) â acquired great status as the most important territory in the South of Italy. Feudalized first by the Normans (1076-1189) and then by the Svevans (1190-1286) with the organised establishment of the court of the Anjou Dynasty in the Kingdom of Naples and the election of Naples as the capital, and the constitution of Benevento as âpontificial enclaveâ, Salerno was divided into: Principato Ultra (the present day Province of Avellino together with part of Benevento) and Principato Citra (the present day Province of Salerno).\n\nSuccessive transitory dominion of the newly created Kingdom of Naples; by the Aragonese (in 1400), the Spanish of the Vice Kingdom (from 1500 to 1600), to that of the Bourbons (in 1700), have in no way modified the actual make up of the territories. From the Parthenon Republic (late 1700) to Gioacchino Murat (early 1800s) up to the last of the Bourbons, the denomination of Principato Citra remained, and was changed to the actual denomination Province of Salerno, only after the annexing of the new Kingdom of the Due Sicilie to the Sabaudia Dynasty, under the newly created Kingdom of Italy (1860). Geography Morphologically speaking, the Province is characterised by plains, hills, plateaux and mountain chains, some of which present karstic characteristics, (the most impostant in the South of Italy being Castelcivita, Pertosa): water courses including the ancient and solemn Sele (lat. Silarus) with its great outlets; the Calore and The Tanagro. The Tyrrhenian Sea washes the Amalfitan Coast the backbone to Salerno to the North, and the Cilentan Coast which delimits Salerno in the South.\n\nThe Cilento constitutes a sub â region characterised by hilly â marine â mountaineous areas, such as the Diano Valley, an ondulating plateau of longitudinal shape and forming one of the most extended in the Appenines (37km), crossed by The Tanagro, and running the length of the inland southern part of the area. The Sele Plain is wedged between the Picentan Mountains which divide the Plain in the North from the Avellino Area and the Cilento in the South which confines it at Agropoli, The Agro-Nocerino-Sarnese area, with its fertile and ancient soil (Tomatoes of San Marzano) makes up Salernoâs other plains beyond the Lattari Mountains.\n\nThe Irno and Picentino valleys behind Salerno constitute her borders with the Avellino Area in the North while in the South, the Gulf of Policastro with its wonderful inland areas, joins the province with the Basilicata Region. Thus, this province unites its territorial diversification with the stratigraphy of the previous civilisations that have made it what it is, a unique specimen of territorial variety and historical settlements, unequalled/without equal in the other Provinces of Italy"
