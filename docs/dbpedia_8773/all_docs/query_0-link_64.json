        "text": "In 1155 Byzantine Emperor Manuel I allied with Pope Adrian IV and sent an expedition under Michael Palaiologos and John Doukas against the Normans of Sicily. OTL, the invasion was initially successful but stalled after Michael alienated their Italian allies. After Palaiologos was killed and Doukas captured, Manuel sent Alexios Axouch but the Byzantines were finally defeated at the Battle of Brindisi.\n\nWhat if Manuel's expedition had succeeded? If he had sent Alexios Axouch earlier, along with or instead of Michael Palaiologos. Or if Michael Palaiologos didn't have such an attitude. Or what if he himself went to Souther Italy.\n\n1. If his negotiations with the Popes still went sour, would he still support the Lombard League against Fredrerick Barbarossa? I guess he would have to.\n\n2. How much was Manuel planning to annex? The Papal States and all of Southern Italy (or at least Bari) were eager for a restored Byzantine presence in Italy and the city of Ancona acted as a base during the expedition.\n\nWould Manuel have tried to annex the entire Norman kingdom, including Sicily and Malta, or just restore the traditional Catepanate of Italy (Apulia/Longobardia, Lukania and Calabria) and leave two rump kingdoms in Sicily and Naples?\n\n3. Would his later campaigns against the Hungarians, Seljuks, Danishmendids and Fatimids still take place? Would he have given any support to a Miaphysite uprising in Egypt like Michael VIII did during the War of the Sicilian Vespers?\n\nWhat happens to Bela III?\n\nInteresting premise. You seem to have a good handle on it. Explore it, develop it.\n\nI might, but at the moment I'm looking for other people's opinions on the subject matter in case there's anything I've forgotten.\n\nIf I did write a timeline about this or any other ideas I might have it wouldn't be up to the quality of The Reign of Romulus Augustus, Age of Miracles: Revival of Rhomanion or The house of Palaiologos, Against the Tide. But I'll give it a go:\n\nThe Right Man for the Job - A Manuel Komnenos timeline\n\nVolume 1: Manuel I Komnenos\n\n1143: John II Komnenos dies in Cilicia after being wounded by a poisoned arrow. He is succeeded by his youngest son, Manuel, chosen for his courage, his ability to listen to advice and the bad temper of his older brother Isaac.\n\n1148: The Normans of Sicily capture the island of Corfu from the empire. Manuel allies with Holy Roman Emperor Conrad III and the Republic of Venice. The superior Venetian ships sink the Norman fleet, allowing Manuel to reclaim Corfu and prepare for a joint attack on Sicily and Southern Italy with Conrad.\n\n1152: Conrad III dies. Manuel's wife, Bertha of Sulzbach gives birth to a daughter, Maria.\n\n1154: Roger II of Sicily dies and is succeeded by his untested son, William. The local barons are encouraged to revolt by Pope Adrian IV. Several refugees from Apulia flee to Constantinople. Bertha gives birth to a second daughter, Anna.\n\n1155-1156: A new Holy Roman Emperor is elected - Frederick I Hohenstaufen, nicknamed 'Barbarossa' for his red beard. Frederick prepares to invade Southern Italy but is stalled by the unhealthy Italian summer, rebellious cities in Northern Italy such as Milan and an uprising in the city of Rome. In the end, he returns to Germany with his depleted, demoralised army.\n\nManuel decides now is the time to launch his campaign against the Normans. He places the expedition in the hands of John Doukas and Alexios Axouch (1st POD). If successful, the emperor and generals will gain prestige and wealth and the empire will gain a rich source of wheat, fruits and other foodstuffs.\n\nThe army lands at Ancona and from there heads south into Apulia. The cities of Apulia eagerly welcome the Rhomans, including Bari, capital of the old Catepanate of Italy. William tries to halt the advance with an army of 2,000 men but is heavily defeated by the Rhomans with the help of several disaffected barons, including Robert of Loritello.\n\nThe allied army begins to besiege Brindisi. William leads a joint land and naval attack to relieve the siege but is defeated (2nd POD).\n\nWilliam signs a treaty with Manuel which recognises his rule over Southern Italy. At the same time, Manuel discreetly encourages and bribes certain barons in Sicily to crown a new king. William arrives at Palermo but is refused entry. The barons have crowned his illegitimate half-brother, Simon as King of Sicily. William, rather than attempt a siege, instead retreats to IfrÄ«qiya (Arabic for Africa) and those Normans who are still loyal to him, establishing his new capital at Mahdia.\n\nManuel, though tempted to invade Sicily, instead discusses what to do next with his advisors. Manuel offers a new treaty to Simon - Simon will remain King of Sicily and receive support against William in exchange for recognising Rhoman sovereignty over Southern Italy. Simon reluctantly agrees but has no intention of keeping to the treaty forever...\n\n1157-1158: Manuel begins reorganizing the newly-aquired lands into themes (details in the next update). Back in Constantinople, his daughter Anna falls ill but miraculously recovers (3rd POD).\n\n1st POD - In OTL, the expedition was led by John Doukas and Michael Palaiologos. The latter ended up alienating Robert and other allies with attitude and the campaign lost its momentum, leading to its overall failure. Manuel did later send Alexios Axouch but by then it was too late.\n\n2nd POD - OTL, the Byzantines, or Rhomans as I'm going to call them, lost that battle. I can't find many details on the battle itself, but there was a combination of the Rhomans being abandoned by the barons and their mercenaries, thus being outnumbered.\n\n3rd POD - OTL, Manuel's daughter Anna died in infancy. This will come into play later.\n\nHow will this successful Western enterprise effect Manuel's attention on his Eastern frontier? Will the prestige from his victories in the West translate into better fortune when and if he turns his tender mercies on Anatolia? Or will the West prove to be a distraction or even begin to transform the center of political weight of the Empire westwards?\n\nIn the west, I don't want to give too much away, but Manuel will still fight Hungary and will have more involvement in Italy since he has something to lose there.\n\nIn terms of the East, the expedition with the Kingdom of Jerusalem against Fatimid Egypt will not happen. Manuel will consider it but ultimately focus on bringing the Anatolian borders back, at most, to where it was around Basil I's reign, as well as making Cilicia and Antioch a permanent part of the empire once again.\n\nI think Myriokephalon will be butterflied away. Call me odd but I tend to notice certain things in history that, to me, don't add up. Manuel, for example, was chosen as heir by John because he listened to advice, yet he lost the Battle of Myriokephalon because he did the exact opposite. For another example, Antiochus III lost the Battle of Raphia by riding off and leaving his army, then 24 years later, after campaigning in the East all that time, at Magnesia, he lost by doing the same thing again. The main historical sources for these battles (Polybius, Livy and Appian) were Romans or in the employ of the Romans.\n\n1158:\n\nManuel finishes organising Southern Italy. Robert of Loritello, Alexios Axouch and John Doukas are made strategoi* of Longobardia, Lukania and Calabria respectively. Benevento and Capua are made themes under their previous counts. Ancona remains independant, but as a Byzantine protectorate.\n\nFrom here, Manuel makes it a policy to integrate all the enthnicities living within the empire - Greeks, Turks, Franks, Italians, Bulgarians, Vlachs, Serbs and Cumans. To the outrage of many of his nobles, Manuel begins organising Latin-style jousting tournaments and even taking part in them.\n\nManuel's main motives for this, however, were to rebuild his army in preparation for a campagin against the Seljuks and Danishmendids. These two rival Turkish powers held Central and Eastern Anatolia and Armenia, which were prime breeding and recruiting grounds for cavalry mounts and infantry skirmishers. To counter this he started recruiting other peoples into the army, regarded that they convert to Eastern Orthodoxy, with the exception of Venetian, Genoese, French and German mercenaries.\n\nHis preparations were stalled when Bertha-Irene went into labour once more. After two days, she successfully gave birth to a boy, Alexios, but the strain had taken its toll and she died shortly after from exhaustion. Manuel was inconsolable, shutting himself in his room for days. One courtier described him as 'roaring like a lion' in grief.\n\nBy the time he attended his wife's funeral, many nobles saw Manuel as weak and Latin-friendly. A conspiracy led by Michael Palaiologos and Stephen Hagiochristophorites** began to plot the emperor's death.\n\n1159-1160:\n\nAfter years of training, Manuel decides to personally reaffirm Cilicia and Antioch's allegiance to the empire and to negotiate with the rising power of Nur-ad Din of Aleppo. Manuel sets out with a small contingent, including the Varangian Guard and Archontopoulai, while leaving the majority of his army in Dorylaion under the command of his newphew, John Kontostephanos, secretly a member of the conspiracy to remove him.\n\nThe new army comprised of:\n\nPsiloi, armed with javelins, slings and cleavers, recruited from the Rhoman Greeks, Vlachs and Serbians.\n\nToxotai, archers recruited from Rhoman Greeks and Muslims living in Southern Italy, using bows of Turkish design.\n\nA small contingent of crossbowmen from Venice and Genoa.\n\nSkoutatoi, Rhoman Greek heavy spearmen.\n\nAlamannoi, mercenary Frankish, German and Italian knights fighting on foot and horseback.\n\nKataphractoi, heavy cavalry armed with lances, javelins, swords and maces recruited from Thrace, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia and the Crimean Goths.\n\nHippo-toxotai, horse archers recruited from Cumans and Turks living in Rhoman territory.\n\nAn artillery train including trebuchets, ballistae and mangonels.\n\nAfter forcing Duke Thoros II of Cilicia to submit to him, Manuel arrives in Antioch. Once there, he decides to select a new wife. He sends the akolouthos (attendant) of the Varangian Guard, Basil Kamateros, to find some candidates. He returns with two - Princess Maria of Antioch and Melisende of Tripoli, a cousin of King Baldwin III of Jerusalem.\n\nTo keep up good relations with Baldwin, who was married to his niece Theodora, Manuel chooses Melisende as his bride and Maria as a political hostage***, but not before giving Maria a good tumbling, discreetly, of course. Manuel leaves Melisende in Antioch while he heads to Turbessel to meet with Nur-ad Din.\n\n1160-1161:\n\nTurbessel was originally the new capital of the County of Edessa before it was sold to Manuel in 1150, but Nur-ad Din ended up conquering it anyway. Manuel offers a deal to Nur-ad Din. He will give up all claims to Turbessel and any territory he captures from the Danishmendids in exchange for lending no aid to the Seljuks of Iconium. Nur-ad Din does not agree straight away and the negotiations go on longer than expected.\n\nBack in Constantinople, the conspirators are debating who to replace Manuel with. Michael wishes to use Isaac Komnenos, grandson of the emperors deceased brother, as a puppet while Stephen wishes to release the handsome and charismatic Andronikos, imprisoned for an early conspiracy against the emperor.\n\nManuel returns to pick up Melisende and Maria, his negotiations with Nur-ad Din having come to nothing. They head back to Dorylaion through Cilicia, but when a storm forces them to divert past Iconium, they come under attack by a large group of horse archers led by Sultan Kilij Arslan II himself. Tired and caught unprepared, the Rhomans are quickly overwhelmed. Some of the Archontopoulai manage to escape but the Varangian Guard, including Basil Kamateros, fight to the death, refusing to surrender.\n\nKilij Arslan begins marching back to Iconium with the emperor, Melisende and Maria as hostages. When news reaches Constantinople, the conspirators spring into action. The emperor's children are placed under house arrest. Andronikos remains imprisoned while the conspirators try to come to an agreement. John Kontostephanos orders his troops to march for Ankara...\n\n*: I'm not sure if the correct term for the leader of a theme was strategos or doux. Could someone clarify this for me, please?\n\n**: OTL, he was Andronikos I's main henchman.\n\n***: OTL, Manuel picked Maria.\n\nReading it.\n\nIt's always a big challenge for me to have the Byzantines try to take Italy again semi-plausibly and this seems a good a take on it as I've see.\n\nThank you. I'm trying my best.\n\nLooking forward to more. It seems that he still got captured - expecting an alignment with the Seljuks?\n\nThanks. Alliances have been and will be made with different people. Who and what will be revealed soon.\n\nThe second and third POD can be consequences of the first POD. Butterflies, you know.\n\nAnd is that a good thing?\n\nWhy is he seen as weak when he's won these victories in Italy?\n\nI probably should have explained it better, but the conspiracy is a combination of those who dislike his policies towards non-Greeks and would get more power under a different emperor (Stephen Hagiochristophorites), some who are bribed or threatened (John Kontostephanos) and people who see him as weak or unmanly for setting aside a long and potentially expensive campaign, possibly forever, just because of the death of one woman. Michael Palaiologos himself is sore for being passed over for the Italian campaign (his OTL death in Bari thus being avoided). I'll try to explain a bit more in the next update.\n\n1160-1161 (continued): Kilij Arslan continues onto Iconium with his hostages. When he hears of the advance on Ankara, he leads half of his army to ambush the Rhomans while he sends the hostages to Iconium under his brother Sancar.\n\nBack in Constantinople, news has broken out of Manuel's capture and possible death. The people begin rioting in the streets. While negotiating with Eirene Komnenos, Michael Palaiologos stirs up gangs to hunt down anyone who would support Manuel or his children. He is unable to control all of them, however, and they end up storming the quarters of 'Latins', beating and killing all in their path - men, women, children. Homes and churches were looted and burned to the ground. By the end, tens of thousands of Latins were dead.*\n\nIn Iconium, Manuel, Melisende and Maria are being treated fairly well for hostages, though they don't know why. One night, Prince Sancar is woken by news of a large contingent of soldiers approaching the gates. The host is difficult to make out, even with a few torches lit, but they can recognise some siege engines. A catapult launches a projectile which lands just over the gate. The soldiers find among the rocks a sack, and within the sack, the head of their sultan.\n\nSancar is shocked when the head is presented to him. 'Damn the emperor! Damn Palaiologos!' he screams. He calms down and heads to where the emperor is being held. 'Let these backstabbers fight amongst themselves,' he mutters.\n\nJohn Kontostephanos and the army are relieved when Sancar personally escorts the emperor, his ladies and the other survivors through the gates. John explains that Ankara has fallen, partly through siege and partly through the cowardice of Kilij Arslan's other brother Shahanshah, who he explains to Sancar that he has fled to Tyana to stake his claim to the throne. Manuel's last act before leaving is to 'persuade' Sancar to surrender Ankara for good. The following exchange is later recorded in Kontostephanos' journals:\n\nSancar: Do not test my generosity, your Majesty. My men still surround you.\n\nManuel: And my men surround you, Sancar. As well as the Danishmendids. And I do believe Nur-ad Din might be on the way as well. Should I go on?\n\nFuming, Sancar sends the Rhomans on their way and prepares to face his brother.\n\nWhen the army arrives on the shores of the Bosporus, Constantinople is in chaos. Stephen Hagiochristophorites grew tired of waiting and released Andronikos Komnenos. The gangs began fighting amongst themselves and eventually pushed back Michael and Eirene, who have taken refuge in the Hagia Sophia. On the shores, a small body is found with his throat slit and his eyes gouged out. It is soon identified as Manuel's great nephew Isaac.\n\nThe army is ferried across the Golden Horn. The fighting begins to die down when the emperor's presence is announced. Those near the gate are deathly silent. When the gates open and Manuel comes into view, they erupt into cheers. Manuel immediately heads for the Blachernae palace, fearing for his children's lives. When he finds them safe and sound, he collapses and hugs them, weeping with joy.\n\nIt takes a few days, but Constantinople is restored to order. Eirene Komnenos and Michael Palaiologos are banished to a monastary, but Michael is blinded and his tongue is cut out so he can spread no more lies. Stephen Hagiochristophorites is accused of murdering Isaac by Eirene, though no one can confirm it. Regardless, he is imprisoned after having his nose and his right hand cut off. The soldiers are unable to find Andronikos...\n\nWhen he learns of the massacre, Manuel is horrified. He hopes to placate those remaining with a minor rebuilding program in the Latin quarter followed by his marriage to Melisende. He will also use this opportunity to reduce Venetian influence in Constantinople by bringing in more merchants from Genoa, Pisa, Ancona and Amalfi.\n\nAs 1161 draws to a close, Manuel heads to bed with an enormous headache.\n\n*: An earlier massacre of the Latins. This will definitely affect Manuel's policies in the West.\n\n1162-1167:\n\nThe Kingdom of Hungary was mired in a succession crisis. Following the death of King Geza II, his oldest son Stephen had been crowned. Unfortunately, the Rhoman Emperor Manuel, looking to extend his influence over Hungarian lands beyond the Sava river, was supporting the claims of his uncles Stephen and Laudislaus. Negotiating with the Hungarian barons, Manuel sent the brothers back from Constantinople. Stephen III fled to Pozsony and Ladislaus was crowned King Ladislaus II, granting his brother Stephen one third of the kingdom to rule.\n\nArchbishop Lukas of Esztergom believed Stephen III was the legitimate king of Hungary and excommunicated Ladislaus. Ladislaus responded by arresting the archbishop, releasing him on Christmas Day, 1162 at the request of Pope Alexander III. Shortly afterwards, Ladislaus died, some believe of poisoning, and his brother was crowned Stephen IV. Lukas still remained loyal to Stephen III and excommunicated this new King as well.\n\nThe Hungarian barons began to chafe against Stephen IV's pro-Rhoman policies. The Csak clan rebelled against him was defeated. His newphew, meanwhile, had sought the aid of Frederick I.\n\nIn 1164, Stephen III defeated his uncle in battle with the help of troops lent to him by the German emperor. On the advice of Lukas, the restored king exiled his uncle and appeased Manuel by sending his younger brother Bela to Constantinople as a political hostage.\n\nManuel received Bela warmly, betrothing him to his eldest daughter Maria, but negotiations broke down when he also demanded Bela's paternal inheritance - Croatia, Bosnia, Syrmia and Dalmatia. Stephen refused and war broke out once more.\n\nManuel sent an army of 15,000 men under Andronikos Kontostephanos (brother of Manuel's saviour) through Serbia to meet the Hungarian army. The two armies met and clashed at Sirmium, ending in a decisive victory for the mixed Rhoman army over the cavalry-heavy Hungarian force. tired of war, Stephen agrees to surrender all Hungarian territory south of the Drava river to the Rhomans. Only Zara, under the Serene Republic of Venice, remains out of Rhoman control.\n\nTo better incorporate all these new Catholic inhabitants, Manuel grants the theme of Dalmatia to general Alexios Branas while keeping Ban Kulin in charge of Bosnia and granting Bela the new themes of Syrmia and Croatia, as is his birthright.\n\nBack in Constantinople, Manuel turns to rebuilding the damage done by the conspirators and to managing his growing family. Shortly after his marriage to Melisende, nicknamed Melissa, Maria of Antioch gives birth to a boy. Manuel names him Isaac in memory of his deceased brother and grand-nephew, but refuses to legitimise him.\n\nIn 1164, Melisende-Xene gives birth to twins, a girl and a boy. The girl they name Viviana, meaning 'life', and the boy Thomas, meaning simply 'twin'. But all is not well. She knows about Manuel and Maria. She is angry, but, not wanting to cause more discord, she and Manuel promise to never tell the other children about the incident, or that Isaac is their brother.\n\nList of Manuel's children by 1167:\n\nMaria (b. 1152 - 15 years old) - Betrothed to Bela Arpad of Croatia & Syrmia (b. 1148 - 19 years old).\n\nAnna (b. 1154 - 13 years old)\n\nAlexios (b. 1158 - 9 years old)\n\nIsaac (b. 1161 - 6 years old) - Illegitimate. Uneligible for the throne.\n\nThomas & Viviana (b. 1164 - 3 years old)\n\nNote: Please comment!"
