        "text": "This paper examines three exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam that are related through their ludic art and exhibition tactics: Die Welt als Labyrinth (1960, canceled before it opened), Bewogen Beweging (1961), and Dylaby (1962). Despite never having been realized, Die Welt als Labyrinth provided a basis for experimental exhibition strategies that focused on artistic intervention in the Stedelijk’s galleries; subsequent ludic exhibitions built upon their predecessor’s innovations. By narrowing the focus on one institution over a short period of time, we can survey the development of playful exhibition strategies, as well as reveal a glimpse of the social, historical, and political conditions of Amsterdam in the early 1960s. In this article, I will turn my attention to audiences’ responses to the exhibitions, largely drawing upon contemporary reviews. My aim is to understand how ludic exhibitions operated at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, exploring the meaning and resonance of this practice. The exhibitions demonstrate the limitations of play: viewers and critics can misread them as mere amusement lacking any value as social commentary. I argue that the ludic exhibition is paradoxical in that it presents critique indirectly, making it palatable, but its implicit critique risks misinterpretation.\n\nThis book establishes play as a mode of humanistic inquiry with a profound effect on art, culture and society. Play is treated as a dynamic and relational modality where relationships of all kinds are forged and inquisitive interdisciplinary engagement is embraced. Play cultivates reflection, connection, and creativity, offering new epistemological directions for the humanities. With examples from a range of disciplines including poetry, history, science, religion and media, this book treats play as an object of inquiry, but also as a mode of inquiry. The chapters, each focusing on a specific cultural phenomenon, do not simply put culture on display, they put culture in play, providing a playful lens through which to see the world. The reader is encouraged to read the chapters in this book out of order, allowing constructive collision between ideas, moments in history, and theoretical perspectives. The act of reading this book, like the project of the humanities itself, should be emergent, generative, and playful.\n\nFour performance artists who have used computer games in their work were interviewed for their reflections on aspects of that process, including the decision to make use of games; difficulties and challenges entailed by that choice, and aesthetic values realized in implementing it. Their reflections are related to foundational questions of computer game studies, especially the question of what computer gameness consists in. The main argument draws on Adorno's writing on theatre, specifically his suggestion that audience participation might carry utopian potential. The idea of 'ludic form' is put forward as an attempt to grasp positive fulfilments of this in contemporary performance, especially the performance of space. The aesthetics of ludic form turn on use of a succession of mild shocks to stimulate and guide the audience through that process, rather than creation of an immersive or 'gamified' audience experience. Introduction This paper sets out to explore contemporary performance artists' decisions to incorporate video games or elements of digital play into their practice. The discussion is based on interviews with a choreographer, a theatre director, a scenographer and a composer of orchestral music, each of whom has consciously borrowed from computer games in the creation of one or more performance work. The key questions addressed in the interviews concern what computer games represent to each artist, what motivated them as established practitioners to take the step of incorporating a game or game-related element into their work, and what they thought the risks were in making such a move. These questions are important for a number of reasons related to the study of contemporary culture and the sociology of art. A central concern is the extent to which the prior cultural coordinates of the videogame pertain to and inform the decision to use it as artistic raw material. From the mid-1980s until some point in the early 21 st century, computer games were strongly associated with a specific social and cultural group, gamers, who are thought of as young, male and technophile (Crawford 2012; Kirkpatrick 2013; 2015). Within that cultural setting games have been positively appraised for their 'addictive' properties, especially their 'gameplay'. This cultural location and these aesthetic values seem at first blush quite remote from art, including performance art.\n\nPlay has often been snubbed as a serious research topic. The combination of its supposed uselessness and its association with the world of childhood has led to a general lack of reflection about play on the part of high culture. Nevertheless, play experience is symbolic, polysemic, ambivalent, laden with affect and a potential generator of contradictory and transformative knowledge (Huizinga, 1980; Fink, 1987, 1992; Suits, 1978). Due to its rich variety of expression and multiple meanings, it eludes the rigorous conceptualizations and reductionism favoured by contemporary mainstream educational science, which views play mainly as a teaching aid or as an opportunity for socialization, culturalization, transmission of contents or as a means of furthering linguistic, cognitive or affective development. When we speak about the relationship between playing and childhood, we have to go beyond the real and concrete child, and also go beyond a univocal kind of game - as symbolic play. Although we expose ourselves to the risk of considering playing an important but limited activity, that has to be abandoned in favour of growing up, to evolve activity in more useful ways. But play is linked to the world of childhood in a deeper way, where childhood is understood as an archetypical dimension (Hillman 1988, 1999; Bachelard 1960), as an age which is not only biological, but represents the most imaginative season of life, mainly characterized by wonder and excitement about the world. Childhood is the season in which reality is not analysed, categorized or divided into disciplines, but is seen as a wonderful and fantastic playroom, viewed with passion and understood at a deep symbolic level. In this sense artists, poets, visionaries, dreamers such as players and gamers, nurture a symbolic childhood gaze, open to understanding Play as a fundamental experience for the development of human capabilities. In the chapter I will argue how this is possible, supported by philosophers, anthropologists, educators.\n\nMOST OF THE IDEAS IN THIS PAPER HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN: ANDREW MURRAY, The Tragedy, Pathosformeln and Politics of Huizinga's Autumntide of the Middle Ages, published open access and available here: https://jnr2.hcommons.org/2023/7895/ With the publication of Homo Ludens in 1938, Johan Huizinga (1872-1945) became one of the foundational theorists for the concept of 'play'. Although it has been recognized that Huizinga was influenced by Friedrich Schiller's notion of the 'play-drive', the influences on Huizinga's definition of play can be traced back to Kant's formulation of this concept in the Critique of Judgement, as well as Hegel's Aesthetics and Phenomenology of Spirit. Showing how Huizinga was influenced by these thinkers reveals how they each used their theories of aesthetics to respond to and characterise the perceived conditions of disenchantment in the modern world. Similar to Kant's notion of non-purposiveness purposiveness, Huizinga claims that during play 'play turns to seriousness and seriousness to play'. And just as Kant was seeking to develop a concept that allowed for the transition in thought between pure and practical reason, Huizinga was considering how play united reason and the ethical life of any given culture. However, Huizinga's concept became more pessimistic that Kant's. Whereas for Kant the playful transition between reason and morality in the experience of the beautiful and sublime allowed one 'to feel at home in the world', the function of play in Huizinga's wider studies on the Burgundian Court, Vedic Buddhism and twentieth-century America characterize these culture as dilettantish and despairing, ones that could not make such transitions and ones whose laws and philosophies were becoming vacuous and formulaic. It is here that one can find strong links between Huizinga's reading of such cultures in decline and Hegel's descriptions of the unhappy consciousness and Greek tragedy in his Aesthetics and his Phenomenology. Both Hegel and Huizinga use the same imagery of masking, insincerity and nostalgia to describe cultures in which aesthetics had become 'mere play', detached from the ethical and rational purposes that once breathed through them. The concept of play has therefore been an ambiguous one in the history of German aesthetics. It is one which has been used to assuage fears about enlightenment and disenchantment, but one which has also be used to embody these concerns.\n\nJohan Huizinga (1872 – 1945, Dutch historian, founder of modern cultural history) began his brilliant study of man the player – Homo Ludens with no provisos and no preambles, but in a straightforward, almost absolutely abrupt manner. Those who are accustomed to using the traditional concepts in their traditional senses will surely be shocked by the major idea about Homo Ludens. How should the nature of culture, or at least one very significant element of it, be sought and found in play? How could humans define themselves as players, as Homo Ludens? It cannot be claimed that the idea of art and culture as play belongs to Johan Huizinga, or that it was born in the twentieth century. Is man Homo Ludens? Yes, and the play is a component of its culture. But the play and the play element are not opposing, not different, from knowledge and doing; Homo Ludens is not an antagonist, or defined separately from Homo Sapiens and Homo Faber. On the contrary, in order to be man the player, and even when he plays, man knows and is able; he cognizes and works. Homo Ludens is born in a great historical compatibility with Homo Faber and Homo Sapiens. Because the play presupposes obligatory observance of rules in order to be fair play, this in itself is impossible without knowledge and is knowledge by itself."
