        "text": "The Dutch Hugh Maaskant (1907–1977) is best known as the architect who made the biggest mark on the post-war reconstruction of Rotterdam with such buildings as the Groothandelsgebouw, the Hilton Hotel and the Lijnbaan flats. Maaskant produced the lion’s share of his work in the 1950s and ’60s, the very period architectural critics generally regard as a time of crisis, when architects worldwide fell prey to confusion and lack of direction. The overriding factor in this criticism was the close link that had grown up since the war between architects originating with the modern movement and the economic-political leaders of that time. The upshot, according to the critics, was that the utopian quality that had originally informed the modern movement had ceded to an empty formalism. This critical stance on post-war modernism was also directed in part at Maaskant. The year 1971 marked the point in his career when the long-smouldering dissatisfaction with the abstract, large-scale, anonymous and ‘inhuman’ aspects of architecture erupted. This was part of a broader cultural about-turn in the Netherlands in which ’60s policy, which was largely directed at material growth, came under critical review. The openness and spatiality of modern architecture that for a decade had served as metaphors for the ‘open society’ fell from favour and came to be perceived as an emptiness that needed programming if existential needs for visual stimuli, security and the ‘human’ scale were to be met. The great scale that had invaded every terrain of social reality and had been accommodated by the architecture of practices like that of Maaskant, was no longer read as an optimistic sign of growth and advancement. Indeed, his buildings were regarded as the degrading products of an antisocial architect. Add to that the widespread discontent with the quality of mass- produced housing – built by Maaskant among others in tens of thousands of units at a time – and it was inevitable that in the 1970s Maaskant would be swiftly toppled from his illustrious position at the crest of Dutch architecture. This book shows how his buildings were an almost perfect reflection of Dutch society in the 1950s and ’60s, which progressed steadily from the frugal reconstruction period to an affluent consumer society. When the tide of Dutch society began to turn at the close of the ’60s, Maaskant found himself carried along with it as an epigone of a bygone era. This was driven home in around 1970 when the baby-boomers, architecturally enlightened by Aldo van Eyck and others of Team X, made their entrance into the municipal departments and government institutions. From there they contributed to a colossal shift in policy away from the architecture of the reconstruction period and the prosperous ’60s. ‘Small-scale’ became the new watchword after the spaciousness and large scale of the previous decade. Needless to say, Maaskant was more inclined towards the latter. With the critique of modernism gaining ground since the 1970s, Maaskant’s canon was one-sidely looked upon as functional, rational and technocratic, clouding the view of other themes in his work. Since then, however, the dogmas of the ’70s have themselves become outmoded, ushering in a fresh appreciation of Maaskant’s buildings as examples of a fascinating metropolitan architecture. This has to do with the renewal of interest in typical ’60s design themes now back in play such as mass, large scale, infrastructure and designing for industry. Meanwhile faith in architecture’s utopian claims, its capacity to improve the world, has dwindled dramatically if not disappeared altogether. An ‘anti- social’ designer like Maaskant, who had always been aware of architecture’s limitations, could then return to the stage; more than that, his amoral attitude devoid of patronizing undertones was construed as a ‘modern’ stance, meaning in tune with the 1990s. Ideas that had been regarded in the ’70s as cynical were now looked upon as realistic. The optimism conveyed by his buildings, his acceptance of social trends as the architect’s programme and a faith in the future, have made his work popular again. Unquestionably, his image as a no-nonsense businessman also has its appeal; to say nothing of the flip side of that image, Maaskant as the society architect who with un-Dutch audacity succeeded in making grand gestures. Neither image is entirely true of course but they did make him a cult figure. In recent years architectural critics have been keenly re-examining post-war modernism, particularly the many variants and the wide diversity covered by the term. The heterogeneity of the modernist canon, evident as far back as the early 1930s through regional differentiation and the reintroduction of a whole host of forgotten or displaced design themes, became so extreme in the post-war years that there was no longer any question of a movement with shared formal or stylistic premises. This multi-faceted presence, the disbanding of the architects’ associations (CIAM in an international context, ‘de 8’ and Opbouw in the Netherlands) and more generally the departure from the original social ideals were expressed from the ’70s onwards in the literature as a profound scepticism about the very existence of ‘the modern’ and as a demystification of all the constructs assiduously assembled in the writings of, say, the theorist Sigfried Giedion or the archi-tects of Team X. At the end of the day, this demythologizing failed to yield a new ‘narrative’ to replace the old; nor did it erect a new framework in which to better understand architects like Maaskant, who after all had had their roots in pre-war modernism. This book seeks to advance criteria, perspectives and arguments with which to analyse Maaskant’s work, distinct from the received traditions of existing architecture criticism. This it does in the first place through his designs and buildings and the relative autonomy of their visual form, and in the second place through the close ties his built work enjoyed with the social trends and themes of the time. Maaskant figured prominently in developing new urban typologies for the contemporary briefs of traffic, city reconstruction and the creation of business districts and modern city centres. His architecture was less directed at therapeutically administering to the city than at questing for ‘signs’ that were to mark urban modernity. Aided by 15 portraits of selected buildings, this book paints a picture awash with complexities and contradictions, in a dual bid to showcase the fascinating work produced by Hugh Maaskant and help chronicle a multiform reading of Dutch post-war modernism."
