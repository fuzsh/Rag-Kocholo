As such, it is not surprising that aberrant regulation of Ca2+ signals can lead to pathological phenotypes, including cancer progression. However, given the highly context-specific nature of Ca2+-dependent changes in cell function, delineation of its role in cancer has been a challenge. Herein, we discuss the distinct roles of Ca2+ signaling within and between each type of cancer, including consideration of the potential of therapeutic strategies targeting these signaling pathways.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nCa2+ is a ubiquitous and dynamic second messenger molecule that regulates a variety of cellular functions including proliferation, cell cycle control, focal adhesion and others (Bong & Monteith, 2018). As such, it is perhaps not surprising that the contribution of Ca2+ signals to cancer progression has long been under investigation for many years. Hence, dysregulation of Ca2+ signaling is now well established to modulate oncogenic signaling pathways and promote invasive behavior (Bong & Monteith, 2018). The oldest record of the use of Ca2+ in cancer treatment is from 1896, when Calcium Carbide (CaC2) was used as a clinical palliative treatment for uterine cancer (Das, 1896), while the role of Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) in cancer growth was proposed in 1918 (Cramer, 1918). As of today, there are over 42,000 publications featuring both Ca2+ and cancer listed in PubMed, a number that has increased fourfold over the last 20 years.\n\nIn considering the role of Ca2+ in cancer, it is important to recognize that the expression and function of Ca2+ permeable channels vary considerably between cell types, driving considerable heterogeneity across different cancer types. This results in what seems to be mutually exclusive roles in cancer biology; Ca2+ can drive proliferation, migration and invasion, but can also induce apoptosis. Overall, this fuels the perception that there is no relationship at all. However, the reality is that Ca2+ signals serve distinct roles in different contexts, a point that we hope to clarify over the course of this review.\n\n2. Ca2+ signal generation\n\nCa2+ signals are generated in response to a wide variety of autocrine, paracrine, hormonal, neurocrine and environmental factors. Here, we will briefly discuss some of the major underlying approaches that cells use to generate Ca2+ responses.\n\n2.1. Receptor-mediated control of Ca2+ signals\n\nG-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) families are widely expressed and facilitate Ca2+ responses in virtually all cell types through phospholipase C (PLC). Briefly, as shown in , when Gαq-coupled GPCRs (driving PLCβ activation) or RTKs with PLCγ docking sites are activated, PLC degrades phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into Inositol Triphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). InsP3 diffuses within the cell toward the ER where it encounters InsP3 Receptors (InsP3Rs), ER-localized Ca2+ channels that mediate ER Ca2+ release. The resultant ER Ca2+ depletion leads to a highly conserved process known as store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) (Parekh, 2008; Parekh & Putney, 2005; Putney, 1986; Takemura & Putney, 1989). SOCE is initiated by Stromal Interaction Molecule (STIM), a single pass membrane protein that acts as an Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensor, responding to ER Ca2+ depletion by translocating within the ER toward the plasma membrane (PM) where it binds to and activates members of the Orai family of Ca2+-selective channels (Putney, 1986; Soboloff, Rothberg, Madesh, & Gill, 2012). STIM1 and Orai1 serve as the predominant mediators of SOCE in most cell types (Soboloff et al., 2012), although the other members of the STIM and Orai families can function analogously, although with distinct characteristics. For example, a decrease in the Ca2+ affinity of STIM2’s EF hand causes its activation at near-resting ER Ca2+ levels (Bird et al., 2009; Brandman, Liou, Park, & Meyer, 2007; Stathopulos & Ikura, 2013). Given that, it is perhaps not surprising that STIM2 also exhibits a decreased capacity to activate Orai1 (Zhou et al., 2009) which has been attributed to the presence of a leucine in place of a key phenylalanine within the Orai-binding region of STIM-Orai Activating Region (SOAR) (Wang et al., 2014). Orai2 and Orai3 can each be activated by STIM proteins expressed heterologously (DeHaven, Smyth, Boyles, & Putney Jr., 2007; Lis et al., 2007), although the roles of the endogenous proteins are less clear. Transformed cells can exhibit fundamental changes in the expression and activation of all components of these pathways (GPCRs, RTKs, STIM, and Orai) ( Jardin & Rosado, 2016; Nieto Gutierrez & McDonald, 2018; Regad, 2015), making this an important current area in the investigation of Ca2+ signaling in cancer cells. As such, this will be discussed considerably throughout this review.\n\nAlthough SOCE is a major source of Ca2+ entry, members of other classes of channels also mediate receptor-dependent Ca2+ signals. The Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channel superfamily of non-selective cationic channels includes 28 different members organized into 6 families expressed in mammals: TRPA, TRPC, TRPM, TRPML, TRPP, and TRPV (Zheng, 2013). The canonical TRP (TRPC) family is particularly relevant in this context since, similar to SOCE, they are activated downstream of PLC-coupled receptors (Vazquez, Wedel, Aziz, Trebak, & Putney, 2004), facilitating Ca2+ entry through SOCE-like mechanisms (Cheng, Liu, Ong, Swaim, & Ambudkar, 2011). Hence, DAG directly activates TRPC3/6/7 (Dietrich, Kalwa, Rost, & Gudermann, 2005; Venkatachalam, Zheng, & Gill, 2003) while TRPC1/4/5 activation is thought to be mediated by PIP2 depletion (Myeong et al., 2018; Trebak et al., 2009). TRPC2 is not expressed in higher mammals (Vazquez et al., 2004) in rodents, it is found primarily within the vomeronasal organ (Mast, Brann, & Fadool, 2010). As discussed below, many TRPC family members exhibit dysregulated expression in cancer, making this area of considerable potential interest.\n\n2.2. Environmental triggers\n\nSeveral members of the TRPV, TRPM, and TRPA family are widely expressed, facilitate Ca2+ entry in a variety of cell types, and respond to a variety of environmental factors (see ). For example, TRPV1–4, TRPM8, and TRPA1 are thermosensitive channels activated by temperature changes, each within a specific range (McKemy, 2005; Wetsel, 2011). In addition, there are several chemical activators of TRPs, which ultimately accounts for the sensory confusion between temperature changes and different sensations.\n\nTable 1\n\nTRP channelActivatorsCancers affectedMechanism of activationTRPV1≥43°C1Prostate (S)1.

(More likely) Enthalpy/Entropy induced channel conformation changes (Activation intensity is inversely related to temperature) or (Less likely) lysophospholipids/PUFAs leading to lower activation threshold temperature3. PIP2 synthesisTRPA1Mustard OilWasabiCinnamonGinger\n\nFor example, Capsaicin (the active ingredient in pepper) is a vanilloid (Szallasi & Blumberg, 1999) that stabilizes TRPV1 in its open conformation (Yang & Zheng, 2017). In this conformation, ATP binds to the intracellular ankyrin-repeat domain (ARD) of TRPV1 (Phelps, Wang, Choo, & Gaudet, 2010; Zheng, 2013), lowering the threshold of temperature for channel activation (Tominaga & Caterina, 2004). Resultant increases in cytosolic Ca2+ content cause channel inactivation due to competition between Ca2+/Calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) and ATP for ARD binding (Phelps et al., 2010). Independent of capsaicin, TRPV1–4 sense temperature increases, with TRPV2 activated in response to the most extreme temperature changes (Wetsel, 2011). Indeed, TRPV2 is only activated above 52°C and although the exact mechanism is not fully understood, it is hypothesized that the channel exhibits structural flexibility, resulting from enthalpy and entropy shifts allowing for conformation change in the channel. In support, TRPV2 enthalpy and entropy capacity are twofold larger than TRPV1, whose capacity is fivefold larger than most other ligand- or voltage-gated channels (Liu & Qin, 2016), suggesting thermodynamics play a role in channel activation. Interestingly, the mechanisms that activate TRPV channels in response to temperature and agonists diverge in mechanism but converge onto the same activation gate (Cui et al., 2012; Grandl et al., 2010; Matta & Ahern, 2007; Yang, Cui, Wang, & Zheng, 2010) demonstrating the flexibility and versatility of these channels. TRPV3 responds to less extreme changes in temperature (~33°C) (Wetsel, 2011) and is activated through GPCR-induced breakdown of PIP2 that facilitates a voltage-independent activation of the channel in response to colder temperatures (Doerner, Hatt, & Ramsey, 2011), albeit temperatures resembling physiologic conditions. TRPV4, meanwhile, responds to a wide range of temperature (28–42°C) and is also activated by cAMP-induced PKA phosphorylation of Arachidonic Acid (AA) at S824 (Cao et al., 2018). Hence, all four thermosensitive TRPV channels are activated in response to similar stimuli, although through different mechanisms. While temperature changes are not directly cancer relevant, different types of cancers exhibit different signaling dysregulation, which would have differential effects upon different TRPV channels, precisely exemplifying the context-dependent nature of Ca2+ signaling in a tumor environment.\n\nConversely, TRPM8 and TRPA1, also thermosensitive, are activated by temperature decreases and agonists such as menthol and mustard oil/wasabi, respectively. TRPM8 is activated at 28°C and its level of activation increases in response to temperatures colder than 15°C. It is hypothesized that it can be activated by depletion of membrane lysophospholipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), since lysophospholipids lower the threshold of activation (Andersson, Nash, & Bevan, 2007). This would fit into evolutionary biology that membrane fluidity decreases at cold temperatures, however, it is more likely that TRPM8 is directly activated by cold temperatures leading to enthalpy and entropy changes (Zakharian, Cao, & Rohacs, 2010), similar to the TRPV2 response to heat. Menthol-induced TRPM8 activation occurs through PIP2 synthesis as depletion inhibits the sensitivity of the channel (Liu & Qin, 2005), precisely the opposite relationship to that between PIP2 and TRPV1. TRPA1 also senses cold temperatures, although only in more noxious cold conditions (<17°C) (McKemy, 2005). More importantly, TRPA1 is a potent sensor of exogenous stimuli as it is activated in response to many agonists, mainly mustard oil and wasabi, but also cinnamaldehyde (cinnamon) and ginger (McKemy, 2005) through binding to cysteine residues in the N-terminus of the channel via covalent interactions and/or disulfide bonds (Hinman, Chuang, Bautista, & Julius, 2006; Macpherson et al., 2007; Samanta, Kiselar, Pumroy, Han, & Moiseenkova-Bell, 2018; Takahashi et al., 2008). TRPA1 also has the unique ability to function as a cannabinoid-sensitive pain receptor in response to inflammation (Akopian, Ruparel, Patwardhan, & Hargreaves, 2008; Ruparel, Patwardhan, Akopian, & Hargreaves, 2011). These cannabinoids activate Ca2+/CaM signaling cascades which attenuate the response of TRPA1 to the exogenous agonists (Akopian et al., 2008). There is also some evidence that cannabinoids can also inhibit TRPV1 activity (Ruparel et al., 2011), which in addition to TRPA1, can regulate inflammation (Akopian et al., 2008).\n\n2.3. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels\n\nMembers of the Voltage-Gated Ca2+-permeable Channel (VGCCs) superfamily are primarily expressed in excitable (neurons and muscle) cells and are activated by membrane depolarization (Catterall, 2011). VGCCs can have up to four subunits, but all contain the α1 subunit which is the pore-forming portion of the channel, consisting of four domains (I–IV) each containing six transmembrane segments (S1–S6). The S4 segment of each domain acts as a voltage sensor that rotates outward upon exposure to electrical current and facilitates a conformation change opening the pore, while the S5 and S6 subunits form a membrane-associated pore lining loop containing a series of glutamate residues that determine Ca2+ selectivity (Heinemann, Terlau, Stühmer, Imoto, & Numa, 1992). Both α2δ and β subunits have been demonstrated to increase Ca2+ current VGCCs by recruiting and allosterically regulating α1 subunits (Walker & De Waard, 1998). α2δ subunits are extracellular subunits (Catterall, 2011) that are linked by disulfide bonds and mainly responsible for anchoring VGCCs to membranes using Glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring sites most likely through hydrophobic sequences (Dolphin, 2013). β subunits are intracellular (Catterall, 2011), facilitate channel trafficking to the PM (Dolphin, 2013) and can also shift voltage dependence to make activation easier (Dolphin, 2003). Finally, γ subunits are transmembrane glycoproteins that have been shown to actually limit Ca2+ current through stabilizing the inactivated state of VGCCs in skeletal muscle cells. Further, this subunit is only present in skeletal muscle cells and is not expressed heterologously in other cell types (Campiglio & Flucher, 2015).\n\nWithin the VGCC superfamily, there are five different classes consisting of L-, N-, P/Q-, R-, T-type channels. CaV1 channels, or L-type channels, are long-lasting dihydropyridine channels and are mainly responsible for excitation-contraction coupling in smooth muscle cells and consist of CaV1 α1 pore-forming subunits (Zamponi, Striessnig, Koschak, & Dolphin, 2015). N-, P/Q-, and R-type channels are all members of the CaV2 channel family. N-type channels are named for the nervous system, where they are mainly expressed, however, they can also be found in cell types throughout the body (Phan et al., 2017). P/Q-type channels are named after Purkinje cells where they were discovered and are mainly located in cardiac (Purkinje) and neuronal (cerebellar granule) cells (Catterall, 1998), where R-type channels are also expressed (Zamponi et al., 2015). Finally, CaV3 channels are T-type (transient or short-lasting) and can be activated at lower membrane potentials during membrane depolarization. Similar to L-type channels, they are expressed in most excitable cells (Dziegielewska et al., 2016) and involved in excitation-contraction coupling. In neurons, VGCCs are critical for synaptic transmission (Catterall & Few, 2008; Dunlap, Luebke, & Turner, 1995; Tsien, Lipscombe, Madison, Bley, & Fox, 1988) while in muscle, they drive contraction (Catterall, 1991, 2011; Tanabe et al., 1993). However, it has become increasingly clear that many non-excitable cell types, including cancer cells (Phan et al., 2017) also express T-type channels. How they function in these systems and might contribute to cancer biology will be discussed further in subsequent sections.\n\n2.4. Ca2+ pumps\n\nAs mentioned previously, the ER represents a major Ca2+ storage site in the cell. This is generated and maintained by the Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump, which catalyzes ATP to drive Ca2+ from the cytosol to the ER. SERCA exists in three isoforms (SERCA1, SERCA2, SERCA3) that are encoded by three different genes (ATP2A1, ATP2A2, ATP2A3, respectively), which all have highly conserved sequences and share similar functions within a variety of cells. SERCA1 is mainly expressed in fast twitch skeletal muscle, SERCA2a is mainly expressed in cardiac muscle cells, and SERCA2b and SERCA3 are ubiquitously co-expressed in most cells (Periasamy & Kalyanasundaram, 2007). As the primary regulator of ER Ca2+ content SERCA is not only critical for the generation of Ca2+ signals, but also, as discussed further in subsequent sections, protein processing, mitochondrial metabolism and/or Ca2+ overload. Hence, dysregulated expression and/or function of SERCA function can contribute to the behavior of transformed cells while also offer potential insights into therapeutic opportunities.\n\nCa2+ clearance across the PM is mediated by members of the Plasma Membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) family. PMCA proteins pump Ca2+ from the cytosol into the extracellular milieu. PMCA exists in 4 isoforms (PMCA1, PMCA2, PMCA3, PMCA4) encoded by 4 different genes (ATP2B1, ATP2B2, ATP2B3, ATP2B4 respectively) that together contain 20 different splice variants (Strehler & Thayer, 2018). PMCA1 is ubiquitously expressed in all cell types and ATP2B1KO is embryonic lethal (F Talarico, Kennedy, Marfurt, Loeffler, & Mangini, 2005), PMCA2/3 are expressed mainly in excitable cells such as neurons and striated smooth muscle, but also has been found in mammary gland and uterus (Brini & Carafoli, 2011). PMCA4 is expressed in most cells. ATP2B4KO is survivable, but leads to male infertility (Okunade et al., 2004). These pumps are primarily activated by Ca2+/Calmodulin when cytosolic Ca2+ concentration increases (Brini & Carafoli, 2011), although several recent studies have demonstrated that PMCA is also modulated by protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Strehler et al., 2007). PMCA dysregulation leads to a variety of diseases including deafness, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (Stafford, Wilson, Oceandy, Neyses, & Cartwright, 2017) as well as a variety of cancers, which will be detailed below.\n\n3. Effectors\n\n3.1. Calcium and cell migration\n\nCell migration is a critical Ca2+-regulated cellular function for embryonic development (Ridley et al., 2003), wound healing (Barrientos, Stojadinovic, Golinko, Brem, & Tomic-Canic, 2008), angiogenesis (Lamalice, Le Boeuf, & Huot, 2007) and cancer metastasis (Paul, Mistriotis, & Konstantopoulos, 2017; Vicente-Manzanares & Horwitz, 2011). Cell migration involves three distinct steps; responding to environmental cues to determine direction of movement, generating and maintaining cell polarity and activating motility processes for linear movement (Wei, Wang, Zheng, & Cheng, 2012). Cells can become polarized by extracellular stimuli, which drive movement toward the source of the signal mediated by Ca2+ flickers caused by InsP3 production (Tsai, Kuo, Chang, & Tsai, 2015) and multiple ion channels, including TRPCs (Li, Abuarab, & Sivaprasadarao, 2016), and STIM/Orai (Chen et al., 2011; Tsai et al., 2014). Upon polarization, the cell commences moving forward with the initial process of protrusion which utilizes actin polymerization on cellular projections such as lamellipodia and filopodia (Small, Stradal, Vignal, & Rottner, 2002). Subsequently, to terminate protrusion, the front of the cell retracts and attaches to lamella (Webb, Parsons, & Horwitz, 2002), located behind lamellipodia. Lamella recruit myosin to contract and turnover F-actin, leading to formation of further focal adhesions (Burnette et al., 2011). Focal adhesions are stabilized by integrins and associated cytoskeletal proteins to withstand strong forces and facilitate forward motion (Webb et al., 2002). This occurs primarily in the front of the cell (Vicente-Manzanares & Horwitz, 2011), fixing the front during forward motion and facilitating retraction of the rear portion of the cell.\n\nSmall GTPases are ~20kDa GTP binding proteins that hydrolyze GTP to GDP and serve critical roles in many cellular processes (reviewed in Song et al., 2019), including migration. Many GTPases such as RhoA, Rac and Cdc42 have positive bidirectional relationships with Ca2+ (Aspenström, 2004; Ridley, 2015), and thus, serve critical roles driving cell migration in response to polarity-induced Ca2+-flickers. These small GTPases are known to coordinate myosin-induced contractions (Tsai & Meyer, 2012) through activity of Myosin Light Chain Kinases (MLCK) (Kasturi, Vasulka, & Johnson, 1993; Tsai et al., 2015) for cell movement, which is important for cells to thrive, especially during development, (further reviewed in Tsai et al., 2015). MLCK are Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinases that phosphorylate MLC, leading to myosin cross bridging and cell contraction (reviewed in Chavez, Smith, & Mehta, 2011), and have been demonstrated to facilitate cell movement and migration through regulating membrane tension and protrusion through binding and stabilizing F-actin (Chen et al., 2014). Hence, changes in Ca2+ lead to a signaling cascade culminating in increased cell movement and enhanced cell migration.\n\n3.2. Calcium signaling and epithelial to mesenchymal transition\n\nAn important step in cancer progression is metastasis, which heavily utilizes an invasive process called Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Unaffected tissue tends to adopt an ordered structure of epithelial cells that exhibit polarity through apical and basolateral membranes attached by tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes that form an epithelial layer (Dongre & Weinberg, 2019). However, when epithelial cells adopt a mesenchymal cell phenotype, they exhibit a change to a front to back polarity conformation (Dongre & Weinberg, 2019), that enhances migration and invasiveness to increase cancer metastasis as discussed further below.\n\n3.2.1. Growth factors\n\nEMT is induced by a variety of growth factors (GFs) including Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), and Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) (reviewed in Dongre & Weinberg, 2019). These GFs can induce EMT by facilitating downstream signaling of EMT-associated pathways. For example, EGF can activate Signal Transducer and Activation of Transcription 3 (STAT3) (Wendt, Balanis, Carlin, & Schiemann, 2014; Zhong, Wen, & Darnell, 1994) or Similar to Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic 2/3 (Smad2/3) (Kim, Kong, Chang, Kim, & Kim, 2016), both of which are transcription factors that transcribe mesenchymal signature genes. TGFβ uses a similar mechanism in that it can activate Smad2/3 (Xu, Lamouille, & Derynck, 2009). FGF uses a different mechanism of action in that it mainly contributes to loss of cell polarity, promotes cell division, and inhibition of cell-cell contact (Sun & Stathopoulos, 2018). Hence, GFs play several important roles in promoting EMT by facilitating downstream EMT-associated pathways.\n\nAlthough these GFs use different mechanisms to promote EMT, it is important to note that in both cases, GFs rely on Ca2+ signals to exert their effects. This is perhaps unsurprising as these GFs bind to RTKs that facilitate Ca2+ signaling as discussed above (see Section 2.1 (Bryant, Finn, Slamon, Cloughesy, & Charles, 2004; Ornitz & Itoh, 2015; Perez-Garcia, Muñoz-Couselo, Soberino, Racca, & Cortes, 2018; Qi et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). Ca2+ signals serve a critical role in EMT by driving the expression of mesenchymal signature genes and facilitating ECM degradation, as outlined below.\n\n3.2.2. Mesenchymal signature\n\nEMT induction is associated with several transcription factors that comprise a mesenchymal signature. The most common of which are Twist, N-Cadherin, Zeb1/2, and Snai1/2 (Snail and Slug); loss of the epithelial marker, E-Cadherin also occurs (Dongre & Weinberg, 2019). This leads to the transcription of genes associated with survival and invasion pathways such as Mitogen Associated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), AKT, and Smads among others (reviewed in Kalluri & Weinberg, 2009). Thus, cells can activate an entire program of transcriptional machinery to change the genetic profile of the cell, which inflicts invasive properties that allow for dissemination to other organs.\n\nIn addition to these transcription factors, another important marker comprising the mesenchymal signature is intermediate filament, Vimentin (Dongre & Weinberg, 2019). Vimentin mediates cytoskeletal organization and focal adhesion through modulating the expression of integrins and reorganizing the orientation of microtubules (Liu, Lin, Tang, & Wang, 2015), which can lead to changes in cell polarity and increased motility which facilitate EMT (Liu et al., 2015; Mendez, Kojima, & Goldman, 2010). Therefore, in addition to reprogramming the transcriptional machinery of a cell, the EMT process leads to changes in morphology and polarity.\n\nAs discussed above (see Section 3.1), many of the processes involved in focal adhesion and migration are dependent on Ca2+. Hence, CAMKII has been shown to phosphorylate and activate Vimentin (Goto et al., 1998) and Vimentin activation and STIM1/TRPC1-dependent Ca2+ entry has been show to increase Vimentin activity (Stewart, Ralyea, & Lockwood, 2019). Further, much of the transcriptional machinery activated during EMT is associated with Ca2+; an effect that appears to be very context-dependent. For example, TRPM7 activates STAT3, driving Twist, Zeb1/2, and N-cadherin expression in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Davis et al., 2013). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that Orai3 and STIM1 can mediate Ca2+-dependent TGFβ-induced Snai1 activation, yet blocking Orai1 leads has same effect (Bhattacharya et al., 2018), suggesting Orai3-specific control of EMT.\n\n3.2.3. ECM degradation\n\nSometimes, cells require degrading the surrounding Extracellular Matrix (ECM) in the tissue microenvironment (TME) to facilitate movement. This is facilitated by the modulation of adhesion molecules by degrading appendages; invadopodia and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).\n\nCells contain migratory appendages called podosomes that consist of actin and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that mediate cellular adhesion to the ECM (Tarone, Cirillo, Giancotti, Comoglio, & Marchisio, 1985). However, in transformed cells, podosome activity is altered due to oncogenic induction of aberrant tyrosine kinase activity, ultimately leading to ECM degradation; podosomes capable of this are commonly referred to as invadopodia (Chen, 1989; Murphy & Courtneidge, 2011).\n\nCa2+ serves a critical role in the formation of both podosomes and invadopodia (Siddiqui, Lively, Vincent, & Schlichter, 2012; Sun et al., 2014). For example, SOCE inhibitors block podosome formation through inhibition of MLCK activity (Chen et al., 2017). Further, STIM1/Orai1-dependent Ca2+ oscillations drive invadopodia formation, as well as Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) activity (Sun et al., 2014). Because constitutive Ca2+ entry would be cytotoxic for the cell due to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, cells rely specifically on oscillations to regulate ECM degradation and invasion (Sun et al., 2014). Interestingly, it has been shown that downstream signaling is regulated by these oscillations and is reliant on oscillation frequency and amplitude (Bird et al., 2009; Dupont, Combettes, Bird, & Putney, 2011). This explains the importance of Ca2+ signaling, and specifically SOCE, for invadopodia-induced ECM degradation as SOCE provides the metaphorical fuel for the Ca2+ oscillations to induce ECM degradation. Findings of this nature have driven numerous investigations of the potential link between Ca2+ signaling and metastasis in many different cancer lineages.\n\nAnother factor in ECM degradation are MMPs, which are Ca2+-dependent endopeptidases responsible for remodeling of the ECM (Cathcart, Pulkoski-Gross, & Cao, 2015). Although MMPs are involved in non-pathological processes such as wound repair, development, and immune responses (Cathcart et al., 2015), MMPs can also exhibit pathological activity and have been found to directly contribute to invasion and metastasis in cancer by degrading adhesion molecules leading to changes in cell–cell contact and cell-ECM interactions (Gialeli, Theocharis, & Karamanos, 2011). For example, MMPs are known to cleave E-Cadherin (Noe et al., 2001), the most widely studied epithelial marker, as well as bi-directionally associating with GFs such as TGFβ using Ca2+-dependent MAPK pathway in cancer (Gomes, Terra, Wailemann, Labriola, & Sogayar, 2012; Illman, Lehti, Keski-Oja, & Lohi, 2006). Hence, Ca2+-dependent control of MMP activity plays an important role in EMT and cancer progression.\n\n3.3. Control of metabolism\n\nMitochondria are best known as the site of energy production, but also serve complex roles in ion signaling and cancer biology. The role of metabolism in cancer has been widely investigated, predating the discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressors by many years (DeBerardinis & Chandel, 2016; Huebner & Todaro, 1969; Warburg, 1925). This “Warburg effect” can be summarized as a metabolic shift away from oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells, leading to lactic acid fermentation (Liberti & Locasale, 2016). Although less efficient at energy generation, this favors anabolic growth and catabolism-induced cell survival (Boroughs & DeBerardinis, 2015; DeBerardinis & Chandel, 2016). The underlying mechanisms responsible for the Warburg effect remain under investigation, however, it is important to recognize that increases in matrix Ca2+ content drive NADH, and thus ATP, production (Griffiths & Rutter, 2009; McCormack, Halestrap, & Denton, 1990). This is facilitated by a series of mitochondria-specific channels, exchangers and pumps that control mitochondrial ion content (reviewed in Rizzuto et al., 2009).\n\nAs shown in , to enter the mitochondrial matrix, Ca2+ must pass through the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), the intermembrane space (IMS) and the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels (VDACs) are located on the OMM. They are weakly selective for anions at lower membrane potentials (channel is in “open” state), but favor cations at higher membrane potentials (when the channel is in a “closed” state) (Rizzuto et al., 2009). Although upon closure, VDACs allow entry of other cations, such as Na+ and K+, Ca2+ is favored (Tan & Colombini, 2007). VDACs also serve a critical role in linking mitochondria to InsP3Rs and the ER, critical for mitochondrial Ca2+ loading (Rapizzi et al., 2002; Rizzuto et al., 2009). These links permit preferential loading of the mitochondria since they experience Ca2+ concentrations at near ER Ca2+ levels, critical for the entry of Ca2+ into the matrix. Hence, the major Ca2+ channel on the IMM is the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), a high capacity, low affinity Ca2+ channel (reviewed in Kamer & Mootha, 2015) that does not permit Ca2+ entry at less than 10μM (Kirichok, Krapivinsky, & Clapham, 2004), a concentration not normally observed in the cytosol (on average). This movement across the IMM is driven by its highly negative membrane potential (~−180mV) produced due to proton pumping during oxidative phosphorylation. Upon entry into the matrix, Ca2+ binds directly to pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphatase (PDP) (Denton, 2009), the first step in the generation of acetyl CoA at the beginning of the TCA cycle along with the rate-limiting TCA cycle enzymes α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (αKGDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) (Gellerich et al., 2010) increasing their activity and driving NADH generation. Notably, decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase activity at lower mitochondrial Ca2+ content leads to conversion into lactate via lactic acid fermentation (Saunier, Benelli, & Bortoli, 2016; Shan et al., 2014). Hence, changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ loading may contribute to the Warburg effect and can be greatly altered in transformed cells.\n\nThe sensitivity of mitochondria to Ca2+ levels has been considered a significant therapeutic opportunity. Hence, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload leads to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation due to overproduction of electrons from the ETC during oxidative phosphorylation (Adam-Vizi & Starkov, 2010). In contrast, if too little Ca2+ enters the mitochondria, decreased ATP generation can lead to autophagy (Rossi, Pizzo, & Filadi, 2018) due to AMPK activation (Bootman, Chehab, Bultynck, Parys, & Rietdorf, 2018; Rossi et al., 2018). Although mitochondrial Ca2+ loading is primarily dependent upon MCU and VDAC, ultimately, it is dependent upon the overall availability of Ca2+ to the cell. As such, mitochondrial function represents a significant potential implication of any change in cytosolic Ca2+ signaling in cancer cells.\n\n3.4. Calcium and transcription factors\n\nCa2+ regulation throughout the cell has the ability to not only drive cellular processes, but also affect cellular physiology through control of transcription factor activity. Although crosstalk between signaling pathways can lead to pleiotropic effect on gene expression, several transcription factors are directly Ca2+-sensitive as shown in and as discussed further below.\n\n3.4.1. NFAT\n\nThe Nuclear Factor of Activated T-Cells (NFAT) family of Ca2+-dependent transcription factors consists of 4 classic NFAT family members: NFATc1 (NFATc or NFAT2), NFATc2 (NFATp or NFAT1), NFATc3 (NFAT4), and NFATc4 (NFAT3) and the Ca2+-insensitive NFAT5. Originally discovered in T cells, NFAT family members are widely expressed, with well-defined roles in muscle, neurons, heart, osteoclasts and adipocytes (reviewed in Pan, Xiong, & Chen, 2013).\n\nStructurally, NFAT members share a highly conserved Rel-Homology Domain (RHD) that gives them a similar DNA-binding specificity ( Jain, Burgeon, Badalian, Hogan, & Rao, 1995; Qin et al., 2014). NFAT homology region (NHR), which regulates NFAT activity, consists of approximately 12 regulatory regions including: an N-terminal Transactivation Domain (TAD) (1) with a Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) binding site (2), a Calcineurin Docking Site (CDS) (3), an additional CK1 binding site outside of the TAD (4) 2 serine rich regions (SRR1 and SRR2) (6), 4 serine rich motifs (SRM (SP1, SP2, SP3, KTS)) (10), a Nuclear Localization Sequence (NLS) (11), and Nuclear Export Signal (NES) (12) (Pan et al., 2013) (Muller & Rao, 2010) (see ).\n\nAs shown in , at rest, NFAT members reside in the cytoplasm (Okamura et al., 2000). In response to increased intracellular Ca2+, PKC is activated and Ca2+/Calmodulin regulated protein phosphatase complex (CaM) associate with calcineurin. Following PKC activation and complex association, PKC activates Ca2+/CaM/Calcineurin complex to dephosphorylate NFAT, leading to translocation to the nucleus and subsequent transcription of target genes (Muller & Rao, 2010; Pfeifhofer et al., 2003; Villaseñor et al., 2017). Within NFAT, CDS facilitates calcineurin docking interactions (Garcia-Cozar et al., 1998) for dephosphorylation of NFAT at conserved phosphoserine residues (Qin et al., 2014). Mechanistically, dephosphorylation of NFAT SRR and SRM lead to a conformational change and subsequent exposure of its NLS (Li et al., 2011). Following NFAT NLS exposure, NFAT proteins then translocate to the nucleus and transcribe NFAT target genes (Pan et al., 2013). In fact, it has also been shown that not only does NFAT dephosphorylation lead to nuclear localization, but it also leads to higher NFAT affinity for specific regions of DNA, further promoting transcription of NFAT target genes (Neal & Clipstone, 2001; Okamura et al., 2000; Porter & Clipstone, 2002; Shaw et al., 1995). Following return to basal Ca2+ levels, SRR and SRM serve as phosphorylation sites (Okamura et al., 2000; Qin et al., 2014) leading to exposure of the NES which facilitates NFAT exit from the nucleus (Beals, Clipstone, Ho, & Crabtree, 1997; Okamura et al., 2000). Hence, sustained NFAT-mediated gene transcription requires sustained Ca2+ signals. NFAT is linked to a variety of oncogenic pathways in different capacities including but not limited to: Janus Kinase (JAK)/STAT (Lagunas & Clipstone, 2009), COX2 (Greenhough et al., 2009), and MAPK (Flockhart, Armstrong, Reynolds, & Lovat, 2009). Because NFAT activity is dependent on Ca2+, it underscores the importance of Ca2+ in the context of cancer. In this regard, targeting NFAT could be an efficacious therapy for a variety of cancers which will be discussed in great detail below.\n\n3.4.2. NF-κB\n\nNF-κB is a family of transcription factors that give rise to seven proteins from the combination of five gene-coding subunits, RelA/p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52 (Xia, Shen, & Verma, 2014). This family of inducible transcription factors with pleiotropic functions. Although heavily studied in lymphocytes, NF-κB signaling is present in a wide variety of cells (Zhang, Lenardo, & Baltimore, 2017). Further, its capacity to regulate cell survival can facilitate resistance to apoptosis in transformed cells.\n\nAs shown in , although canonical NF-κB activation is Ca2+independent, Ca2+-dependent PKC activation facilitates CARMA1 phosphorylation to produce the CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) complex in lymphocytes (Altman & Villalba, 2003; Villalba et al., 2000). Further, calcineurin can promote NF-κB activation by promoting IKK phosphorylation of IκB (Berry, May, & Freedman, 2018; Frantz et al., 1994; Steffan et al., 1995; Trushin, Pennington, Algeciras-Schimnich, & Paya, 1999), ultimately leading to proteasomal degradation. Upon IκB degradation, NFκB complexes translocate to the nucleus where they can drive gene transcription. NF-κB targets include cell cycle progression regulators such as Cyclin D, E, c-myc, and c-myb (as reviewed in Dolcet, Llobet, Pallares, & Matias-Guiu, 2005). Cyclin D and E induce cell cycle progression during mid-late G1 phase ( Joyce et al., 2001), and while Cyclin D suppresses differentiation (Guttridge, Albanese, Reuther, Pestell, & Baldwin Jr., 1999). Concurrently, c-myc promotes many survival processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and death (Romashkova & Makarov, 1999) and c-myb regulates growth through a variety of mechanisms depending on tissue type (Kim et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2015).\n\n3.4.3. WT1/EGR1\n\nWilm’s Tumor Suppressor 1 (WT1) and Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) proteins are dueling zinc finger transcription factors that regulate Ca2+ homeostasis in a variety of cell types. Over the last 10 years, our group has demonstrated that WT1 expression leads to decreased STIM1 expression and SOCE, while EGR1 expression leads to enhanced STIM1 and SOCE (Ritchie, Zhou, & Soboloff, 2011; Samakai et al., 2016), discussed in great detail in our recent review (Go, Gross, Hooper, & Soboloff, 2019). Briefly, EGR1 is activated downstream of a wide variety of growth and stress signals (Thiel, Mayer, Müller, Stefano, & Rössler, 2010). Although primarily associated with MAPK signaling, Ca2+ signals can also drive EGR expression (Flavell et al., 2008; van Loo et al., 2019), revealing an intriguing feedback loop between Ca2+ and EGR1 expression. The EGR1 promoter consists of five Serum Response Elements (SREs) and a cAMP Response Element (CRE). Currently, there is considerable evidence that Ca2+ regulates the transcription of CRE- and SRE-containing genes (Hardingham, Arnold, & Bading, 2001; Hardingham, Chawla, Johnson, & Bading, 1997), likely through Ca2+-dependent (Chuderland & Seger, 2008; White & Sacks, 2010) ERK activation (Müller, Lipp, & Thiel, 2012). Dysregulated expression and function of WT1 and EGR1 are observed in a wide variety of cancers (reviewed in Go et al., 2019), providing a potential causative explanation for why cancer cells often exhibit changes in Ca2+ signaling regulation.\n\nWT1 and EGR1 contribute to a variety of cellular processes including but not limited to cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis. EGR1 controls cell cycle progression by downregulating CDK4, which maintains quiescence (Min et al., 2008), Further, EGR1 promotes the transcription of genes driving differentiation in response to a variety of growth factors the development of breast epithelial cells and immune cells among others (Dinkel et al., 1998; Tarcic et al., 2012), whereas WT1 inhibits differentiation by displacing EGR transcription factors from its response elements (Scharnhorst & Jochemsen, 2001). Under some conditions, EGR1 can induce apoptosis through activating pro-apoptotic factors such as p53 in response to increased intracellular Ca2+ in melanoma cells (Nair et al., 1997) whereas specific WT1 splice variants can facilitate apoptosis through repressing both intrinsic and extrinsic survival factors such as Bcl2 and IGF1, respectively, in hepatoma cells (Menke, 1997). As these processes are important for normal cellular physiology, they are also important for cancer progression. As discussed in our most recent review (Go et al., 2019), EGR1 and WT1 play dual and opposing roles in cancer progression. Thus, targeting EGR1 and WT1 could be an effective, and further improved upon, therapeutic target in a variety of cancers and the current landscape of EGR1 and WT1 role in specific cancers, as well as any therapeutics targeting these transcription factors will be discussed in great detail throughout this review.\n\n4. Cancer\n\nCa2+ plays a major role in both the initiation and progression of many different cancer types. Due to the plethora of literature regarding the relationship of Ca2+ with all different types of cancers, as well as the confined space of this review, it is impossible to thoroughly cover the effect Ca2+ signaling has on every cancer. Here, we thoroughly delve into examples of the complex and impactful role Ca2+ signaling plays in cancer, while touching on facets of other cancers reliant on Ca2+. These examples include cancers relying on both low and high Ca2+ content for disease progression, cancers relying on Ca2+-dependent pathways as described above, as well as cancers dependent on a variety of initiating factors including hormones, neural or immune cell differentiation, as well as genetic and environmental factors.\n\n4.1. Breast cancer\n\n4.1.1. Introduction\n\nAccording to 2019 cancer statistics from the American Cancer Society, breast cancer has the highest incidence and second highest total mortalities among women nationwide (Alteri, 2019). Although breast cancer can be easily treated when detected early, high mortality rates indicate that breast cancer still presents challenges in treatment, especially in advanced stage disease. Clearly, the need for novel treatments exists.\n\nBreast cancer is considered an adenocarcinoma, a cancer that starts in glandular tissue, and is heavily reliant on receptor-mediated signaling to proliferate. Like normal cells, cancer cells receive extracellular signals to facilitate their growth. Within breast cancer, there are three major subtypes broken down by receptor status. The three major receptors involved in breast cancer are steroid hormone receptors, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR), as well as non-steroid hormone receptor Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2). To this end, clinically breast cancer is either: hormone receptor positive or negative (HR±; expressing estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR)), HER2±, or triple negative (TNBC, negative for all three receptors) (Waks & Winer, 2019). In addition to hormone and HER2 receptor status, a recently discovered marker for breast cancer classification is Ki67, which is normally a marker for proliferation, leading to additional classification subtypes: Luminal A (ER+, HER2−, PR+/Ki67−), Luminal B (ER+, HER2−, PR− or Ki67+), Luminal B-like (ER+, HER2+, PR+/−, Ki67+/−), HER2+ (ER−, HER2+, PR−, Ki67+/−), and TNBC (ER−, HER2−, PR−, Ki67+/−). Further, there is some evidence of a basal-like sub-form of TNBC, that overexpresses basal cytokeratins, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and caveolin (CAV) 1/2 separate from traditional TNBC (Horton, Jagsi, Woodward, & Ho, 2018; Inic et al., 2014). Although the luminal subtypes tend to be the most common, TNBC is the most aggressive (Tong, Wu, Cho, & To, 2018). While treatment strategies are improving for breast cancer, it is important to note the highly mutually exclusive genetics between the subtypes, which can become even more variable between individual cases. This clearly presents a challenge that still exists in the breast cancer field in generating treatments amenable for the majority of breast cancer patients. Here, we delve into the current understanding of the role of Ca2+ signals in breast cancer biology and discuss its potential as a therapeutic target.\n\n4.1.2. SOCE\n\nGiven the heavy reliance of breast cancer on receptor-mediated signaling, particularly in early stages, it’s reliance on multiple Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways including SOCE, TRP channels and VGCCs is, perhaps, not surprising. For example, it has been demonstrated that Orai1 RNAi attenuates proliferation, migration, invasion, and formation of lung metastases in vivo due to impaired focal adhesion turnover caused by impaired SOCE (Yang, Cao, Zhou, Feng, & Wang, 2009). Hence, not only does impaired SOCE limit the size of focal adhesions formed, the ability of focal adhesions to act as traction points for cellular movement was also compromised (Yang, Cao, et al., 2009). Most likely, impaired SOCE inhibits polarization, causing retention of ER Ca2+, which inhibits InsP3-induced store depletion and Ca2+ flickers to allow cell movement. These observations implicate SOCE as a fundamental driver of breast cancer metastasis and could justify targeting SOCE to impede disease progression, although the efficacy of this strategy in patients has not been established.\n\nInterestingly, different subtypes of breast cancer exhibit distinct expression patterns of STIM/Orai, which serve distinct roles in cancer progression. Hence, it has been demonstrated that elevated STIM1/STIM2 ratio is associated with poor patient prognosis in TNBC (McAndrew et al., 2011). This is most likely because STIM1 is the more effective facilitator of SOCE and SOCE is associated with poor prognosis in TNBC. Furthermore, induction of EMT has been shown to elevate the expression of STIM1 along with associated SOCE in MCF7 HR+ breast cancer cells (Hu et al., 2011; Mo & Yang, 2018). Thus, STIM1 appears to be important in both HR+ and HR− subtypes of breast cancer. Further, differences in androgen signaling between ER+ and ER− breast cancer lead to a switch in Orai expression from Orai3 to Orai1 (Motiani, Abdullaev, & Trebak, 2010; Motiani et al., 2013). Hence, androgens are converted into estrogen using the enzyme aromatase (Nelson & Bulun, 2001), the primary therapeutic target for HR+ breast cancer (Tong et al., 2018). Androgen deprivation has been shown to inhibit Orai1 production in other tissues such as prostate cancer (Flourakis et al., 2010). Hence, differences in androgen-mediated Orai1 expression may contribute to fundamental differences between HR+ and HR− breast cancer, with Orai3 expression being driven as a compensatory mechanism due to loss of Orai1 in early stage disease (Motiani, Zhang, et al., 2013). Notably, Orai1-mediated SOCE in TNBC drives Notch-mediated invasiveness under hypoxic conditions (Liu et al., 2018). Hence, breast cancer progression is marked by significant changes in how SOCE is generated and resultant invasive behavior.\n\n4.1.3. TRP channels\n\nTRPV channels, known for their thermosensitive properties, also have been demonstrated to contribute to breast cancer progression. For example, TRPV4 is a marker for many epithelial breast cancer tumors, where it is upregulated relative to normal tissue (Pla, Avanzato, Munaron, & Ambudkar, 2011). TRPV4 upregulation has been shown to promote AA-induced cytoskeletal reorganization, angiogenesis, and motility in HR+ breast cancer cells (Fiorio Pla et al., 2011; Pla et al., 2011). Conversely, TRPV4 knockdown has also proven to reduce breast cancer cell invasiveness through inhibition of TRPV4-dependent Ca2+-induced phosphorylation of AKT (Lee et al., 2017). Interestingly, although TRPV4-mediated signals promote invasive behavior in HR+ cells, its overexpression promotes cell death in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells due to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, metabolic crisis and, ultimately, apoptosis (Peters et al., 2017). Hence, hormonal and genetic factors can contribute to the design of optimal therapeutic strategies, with TRPV4 attenuation optimal at early stages and stimulation representing a potential therapeutic opportunity in HR- breast cancers\n\nAs reviewed extensively in Duncton (2015), a number of exogenous and endogenous pan-TRP agonists exist such as phorbol esters and AA, respectively. Efforts to generate specific TRPV4 modulators are ongoing. Specifically, Glaxo Smithkline (GSK) and Renovis (RN) have generated TRPV4 agonists, including GSK1016790A and RN1747, with the former used primarily to treat dysfunctional bladders. Conversely, TRPV4 antagonists exist such as Ruthenium Red (primarily known to interact with VGCC and used to study excitation of neurons (Tapia & Velasco, 1997), but also is a small molecule antagonist of TRV4), as well as more recently synthesized small molecule antagonists from GSK and RN such as GSK205, RN1734, and RN9893, respectively. Pfizer and Hydra Biosciences have alsogeneratedTRPV4antagonists,”Compound31”andHC067047,respectively (Duncton, 2015), although there remains no published evidence of their efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer.\n\nTRPV6, exhibiting higher Ca2+ permeability compared to TRPV4, is well established to function as a tumor promoter. TRPV6 expression is regulated by estradiol in T47D ER+ breast cancer cells (Bolanz, Hediger, & Landowski, 2008), and amplified in HER2+ breast cancers (Peters et al., 2012). It has been demonstrated that TRPV6 expression and activity is stimulated by hormones, including estrogen and progesterone. Hence, estrogen induces TRPV6 expression through binding of estrogen receptor α (ERα) to an estrogen response element (ERE) within the TRPV6 promoter (Klinge, 2001). However, estrogen/ERα also binds directly to TRPV6 to facilitate activation (Kumar, Singh, Singh, Goswami, & Singru, 2017). Interestingly, although similar observations have been made for progesterone, the TRPV6 promoter does not contain progesterone response elements (PRE) (Kim, Lee, Ji, Choi, & Jeung, 2006; Lee, Lee, Jung, Choi, & Jeung, 2009). Precisely how progesterone regulates TRPV6 expression and function is not currently clear, although one possibility is that the progesterone receptor (PR) may weakly associate with the ERE (Petz et al., 2004). Thus, not only is TRPV6 expression increased in T47D cells compared to normal breast epithelial cells, but TRPV6 siRNA-mediated knockdown significantly reduced T47D cell proliferation (Bolanz et al., 2008). Hence, TRPV6 promotes the growth of receptor-dependent breast cancer. However, this same effect occurred in HR− cancers whether they were HER2+ or HER2− (Peters et al., 2012). Thus, it is likely that although estrogen and progesterone stimulate TRPV6, TRPV6-induced breast cancer progression is not reliant on hormone signaling. Instead, it has been proposed that Ca2+ influx leads to cell cycle progression (Santella, Ercolano, & Nusco, 2005), which may be a mechanism used across breast cancer subtypes (Peters et al., 2012). Thus, TRPV6 inhibitors have been suggested as a novel therapy for both ER+ (Bolanz et al., 2008) and ER− breast cancers (Peters et al., 2012).\n\nUnlike TRPV4, TRPV6 has very few biologics generated. One TRPV6 inhibitor, SOR-C13 (see ), is derived from a paralytic peptide (soricidin (ascension number {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"P0C2P6\",\"term_id\":\"143585536\",\"term_text\":\"P0C2P6\"}}P0C2P6)) from the Northern Short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) saliva and has been tested in a clinical trial. Although it is still in phase 1, results have been promising as the drug appears to be well-tolerated and provided anti-tumor activity (Fu et al., 2017; Wissenbach et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2015).\n\nTable 2\n\nNon-SOCE/SOCEClass of Drug TargetDrugSpecific target of drugMechanism of actionNon-SOCEVoltage gatedAmlodipineL/N-TypeBinds directly to channel and blocks external surfaceDiltiazemL/T-typeDecreases basal [Ca2+]cTRPSOR-C13TRPV6Inhibits TRPV6 activityCapsazepineTRPM8Inhibits TRPM8 activityP2XBBGP2X7R antagonistCompetitive inhibitionoATPAZD9056P2X7R agonistBind to N-terminal domaineATPAlu-RNAP2X7R agonist-bind to C-terminal domainCa2+-related Transcription FactorsCyclosporin ANFATBlocks nuclear translocation of NFATPumpsThapsigargin/MipsagarginSERCABlocks ATPase activityCyclopiazonic Acid2,5-di-tertbutylhydroquinone (BHQ)CXL-017Enhanced lysosomal Ca2+ release, blocks SERCA ATPase activityIpramine BlueSodium OrthovanadatePMCAInhibits PMCA activitySOCESOCE activityCAISOCETargets anti-apoptotic, Mcl1DrebrinRP4010Promotes actin reorganization and increased SOCESynergistic with RTK inhibitor, preventing SOCE activationOrai channelDiethylstilbestrolOraiDES may bind to steroid binding pockets in Orai channels or may modify Orai channel propertiesBTP2/Pyr2, Pyr3PyrazoleBlock STIM1, Orai1, TRPC3, can interact with extracellular surface of Orai channelsSKF-96365Imidazole\n\nFinally, other TRP channels, have been shown to exhibit increased expression, most notably TRPC1, TRPC6, and TRPM7, in both HR+ and HR− breast cancers reviewed in Ouadid-Ahidouch, Dhennin-Duthille, Gautier, Sevestre, and Ahidouch (2013). TRPC1 has been shown to promote proliferation through activation of ERK1/2 in HR+ MCF7 breast cancer cells (El Hiani, Lehen’kyi, Ouadid-Ahidouch, & Ahidouch, 2009), while mechanisms explaining TRPC6- and TRPM7-induced proliferation are less clear. Further, TRPC1, TRPC6, and TRPM7 have also are associated with proliferation as siRNA-mediated knockdown of all these channels significantly inhibited proliferation in HR+ MCF7 and HR− MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Aydar, Yeo, Djamgoz, & Palmer, 2009; El Hiani et al., 2009; Guilbert et al., 2009), demonstrating direct roles in promoting proliferation. Although it is not yet determined what the mechanisms of TRPC6- and TRPM7-induced proliferation are, it is important to further investigate them. TRPC6 is actually the most highly expressed TRP channel in breast cancer (Dhennin-Duthille et al., 2011; Guilbert et al., 2009), however, mainly what is known about this channel in the context of breast cancer is correlations in expression with breast cancer compared to normal tissue. TRPM7, meanwhile, has also been shown to facilitate migration through increasing cell polarity in a Ca2+-dependent manner leading to changes in myosin-based cell tension and facilitating cell–cell adhesion and cell movement (Middelbeek et al., 2012). Even though TRPM7 has been shown to be important for breast cancer progression, there is limited evidence of this, especially in the context of how Ca2+ is involved in regulating this phenomenon. Further understanding of these mechanisms could lead to potentially new therapeutic targets in the context of breast cancer.\n\n4.1.4. Purinergic receptors\n\nPurinergic receptors are non-selective cationic channels located on the PM that mainly allow Ca2+ entry and are directly activated by the binding of purine-containing molecules, such as ATP. Purinergic compounds include but are not limited to: Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), Guanine Triphosphate (GTP), as well as their diphosphate (ADP and GDP, respectively) and monophosphate (AMP and GMP respectively) derivatives (Shaw, 1984). As reviewed in Burnstock (2014), within this class of Ca2+ channels, exist two subfamilies which are P1, binding specifically to adenosine, and P2, binding mainly to ATP. Further P2 can be broken down into 2 subclasses of families. P2XR which are Ca2+ channels specifically activated by ATP, or P2Y which are actually ligand-gated GPCRs (Erb & Weisman, 2012). However, in the scope of this review, we will mainly focus on P2XR. Because, P2XRs are specifically activated by ATP (Coddou, Yan, Obsil, Huidobro-Toro, & Stojilkovic, 2011), they contain an ATP binding pocket on the extracellular side of the channel, illustrating that this channel is mainly activated by extracellular ATP from the surrounding environment (Di Virgilio, Dal Ben, Sarti, Giuliani, & Falzoni, 2017). Upon ATP binding to the extracellular ATP binding pocket, the channel undergoes a conformation change leading to opening of the pore (Di Virgilio et al., 2017). Normally, these receptors are present on excitable cells, such as neurons and smooth muscle, to facilitate synaptic transmission and smooth muscle contraction respectively (Hattori & Gouaux, 2012; North, 2016), however, it has been recently discovered that these receptors are also expressed in non-excitable, cancer cells (reviewed in Adinolfi, Capece, Amoroso, De Marchi, & Franceschini, 2014). As these receptors are ATP-gated, it is important to note that ATP levels are low in unaffected tissue interstitium residing in the nanomolar range, but can reach micromolar range in pathologic tissue (reviewed in Di Virgilio & Adinolfi, 2016). Although multiple links between cancer and P2XR subtypes are a result of rising extracellular ATP levels in the TME, the most commonly upregulated and targeted subtype is P2X7R. In fact, P2X7R is considered to be a marker for the onset of multiple cancers including early stage prostate cancer and all stages of breast cancer (Burnstock & Di Virgilio, 2013). Further, roles for P2X7R have been demonstrated in both the initiation and progression of cancer. For example, P2X7R activation in T47D ER+ human breast cancer cells enhanced cell migration and increased the development of metastasis via induction of AKT and dysregulation of the adhesion molecules E-Cadherin and Matrix Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) (Xia, Yu, Tang, Li, & He, 2015). Therefore, similar to SOCE-mediated breast cancer progression, it appears P2X7R-mediated cancer progression occurs through EMT and enhanced cell survival. Because Ca2+ plays an important and parallel role in many of these EMT pathways, and is the main cation entering cells through this channel, it is likely that Ca2+ plays an important role in this progression.\n\nP2X7R is a bifunctional channel with differential effects on cell survival depending on cell type and level of activation (reviewed in Di Virgilio & Adinolfi, 2016). Persistent elevation of ATP levels can cause “tumor killing” (Burnstock & Di Virgilio, 2013; Di Virgilio, 2012; Di Virgilio & Adinolfi, 2016) through cytochrome C release leading to subsequent apoptosis (Selzner et al., 2004; Slee et al., 1999). Likely, this reflects persistently elevated ATP concentrations found in some tumor tissues which can drive over-activity of P2X7R, ultimately driving Ca2+ overload-induced cytotoxicity (Peng & Jou, 2010). However, P2X7R can also promote cell survival at lower ATP concentrations through NFκB activation, reflecting the dependence on very tightly regulated ATP concentration to promote P2X7R-mediated Ca2+ influx and subsequent activation of Ca2+-dependent survival pathways.\n\nAs shown in , the P2X7R antagonists Brilliant Blue G (BBG), oxidized ATP (oATP) (Soares-Bezerra et al., 2015) and AZD9056 (Burnstock & Knight, 2018) have been tested clinically in the context of inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s Disease and liver fibrosis among others (reviewed in Savio, de Andrade Mello, da Silva, & Coutinho-Silva, 2018) and have advanced to phase 2 trials (Gunosewoyo & Kassiou, 2010). In addition, P2X7R can be activated through traditional nucleotide agonists, such as eATP (Coddou et al., 2011), as well as non-nucleotide agonists such as Alu-RNA, which activate the channel through direct binding on the intracellular N- and C-terminal domains (Di Virgilio, Giuliani, Vultaggio-Poma, Falzoni, & Sarti, 2018; Fowler et al., 2014). Considering the bifunctional nature of P2X7R signaling in the specific case, either agonists or antagonists could have potential therapeutic benefit. Hence, any therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer based on P2X7R signaling would require consideration of the size and signaling environment of the tumors being targeted.\n\n4.1.5. VGCC\n\nAs discussed previously, there are many other classes of VGCCs, however, published evidence of their expression and function in breast cancer is limited to T-type (CaV3) channels, a class of VGCCs that are heterologously expressed among multiple cancer types. Specifically, CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 are both overexpressed in both ER+ and ER breast cancer cell lines with antagonists causing growth arrest in both subsets (Bhargava & Saha, 2018; Taylor et al., 2008). Since breast cancer cells are not excitable, it is important to consider other potential mechanisms that would control the function of VGCCs. One possibility is ambient pressure increases. Hence, raising extracellular pressure to 40mm Hg (normal atmospheric pressure is roughly 30mm Hg) activates CaV3.3, leading to PKCβ-mediated NFκB activation (Basson, Zeng, Downey, Sirivelu, & Tepe, 2015). In ER- breast cancer cells, NFκB activity is required since its inhibition leads to apoptosis due to prevention of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) (Fan et al., 2018), which is a stress response due to misfolded ER proteins that occurs due to lack of ER Ca2+. Hence, targeting CaV3.3 in ER- breast cancer could lead to loss of NFκB and promote cell death, particularly in combination with agents that drive ER stress, which would be expected to be more effective inducing cell death in the absence of protection from the UPR. Alternatively, targeting NFκB itself could have utility. Although immune suppression would be a concern, it is notable that suppression of NFκB prevents osteoclast differentiation; breast cancer metastases in bones is highly dependent upon osteoclast activity (Simone et al., 2015). Considered collectively, these findings reveal an unexpected link between a channel whose expression and function is typically limited to excitable cells and the survival and growth of breast cancer cells.\n\n4.1.6. Ca2+ clearance\n\nTypically, only PMCA1 and PMCA4 are expressed in non-excitable cells like breast cancer. However, both HR+ and HR− breast cancer heterologously express PMCA2 (Lee, Roberts-Thomson, & Monteith, 2005). Further, PMCA2 overexpression attenuates apoptosis induced by ionomycin in both T47D breast cancer and mammary epithelial cells (VanHouten et al., 2010). Patients with high PMCA2 expression have a poor prognosis, potentially due to control of calpain activity (VanHouten et al., 2010). Calpains are Ca2+-dependent proteases known to induce apoptosis (Gil-Parrado etal., 2002), and PMCA2lowers intracellularCa2+, thusleading to downregulated calpain, inhibited apoptosis, and enhanced progression (Gil-Parrado et al., 2002). Due to its ability to rapidly clear Ca2+, PMCA2 has also been shown to promote HER2 signaling through inhibition of receptor endocytosis in HER2+ breast cancer ( Jeong et al., 2016). Indeed, it appears that high intracellular [Ca2+] leads to direct binding between PMCA2 and HER2 within actinin-rich domains, which helps retain HER2 on the PM. Given its fundamentally protective roles, when PMCA2 is depleted, HER2+ can become more easily internalized, which increases sensitivity to pro-apoptotic reagents, such as anthracyclines (Doxorubicin), in invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, most likely through downregulation of EGFR (Peters et al., 2016). Intriguingly, PMCA2 seems to play different roles in different forms of breast cancer. For example, in HR- basal cancers, EGFR and PMCA2 levels are negatively correlated,while inother (presumably HR+)breast cancerforms, EGFRand PMCA2 expression are positively correlated. The mechanistic basis for heterologous PMCA2 expression remains unclear, but the fact that its expression is linked to EGFR is intriguing and suggests context- and EGFR-dependent transcription mechanisms. Overall, these reports support the potential value of PMCA2 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer, particularly those that are HER2+.\n\nDownregulating PMCA4 is protective against colon cancer (Aung et al., 2009) and melanoma (Hollander et al., 2016) through induction of apoptosis, most likely due to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload (Aung et al., 2009; Monteith, McAndrew, Faddy, & Roberts-Thomson, 2007; Rizzuto & Pozzan, 2006). Although PMCA4 expression has no independent effect on breast cancer cell survival, it’s depletion enhances the apoptotic effects of the Bcl-2 inhibitor, Navitoclax, a caspase-dependent apoptosis promoter, in invasive MDA-MB-231 ER- breast cancer cells, (Curry, Luk, Kenny, Roberts-Thomson, & Monteith, 2012; Curry, Roberts-Thomson, & Monteith, 2016). Although Bcl2 inhibition represents a promising approach to breast cancer treatment, Bcl2 inhibitors have performed poorly in clinical trials due the presence of the B-galactosidase binding protein, Galectin-3 (Gal-3), which is an anti-apoptotic protein that can supplement or replace Bcl2, thus inhibiting apoptosis and conferring chemoresistance. The extent to which Gal-3 contributes to this link between PMCA and Bcl2 inhibition is not clear, although it is tempting to speculate on this possibility.\n\nOverall, it is notable that, although the various channels and pumps described above all regulate cytosolic Ca2+ content, their roles in breast cancer function seem to be distinct. Differences in expression patterns, functions and intracellular location create context-dependent roles, necessitating in depth investigation of their functions before attempting to target them therapeutically.\n\n4.2. Ovarian cancer\n\n4.2.1. Introduction\n\nAlthough breast cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer diagnosis among women, ovarian cancer is the most lethal (Alteri, 2019; Slatnik & Duff, 2015; Stewart et al., 2019). Generally, ovarian cancer is broken up into three subtypes. First, epithelial tumors account for up to 90% of ovarian cancers that consist of many different histological subtypes including serous, endometroid, clear cell, and mucinous carcinomas (reviewed in Matulonis et al., 2016). Less commonly, ovarian cancer can also exist as germ cell and sex cord stromal tumors (Stewart, Azimi, et al., 2019). Importantly, although it was previously thought that ovarian cancer arises from one entity, it is now accepted that ovarian cancers can form in different reproductive organs including the fallopian tube and peritoneum (Mallen et al., 2018; Stewart, Azimi, et al., 2019). Formation of tumors in these other gynecologic areas yield similar molecular profiles, which clinically categorizes them as the same disease even if the site of origin is different. Because tumors can originate in multiple areas of the reproductive system, ovarian cancer is very difficult to detect early, and most clinically diagnosed cases are of higher grade. Hence, the most common form of ovarian cancer is High Grade Serous Carcinoma (HGSC) which accounts for roughly 70%–80% of all ovarian cancer compared to 5% for its low grade counterpart. This is significant as ovarian cancer typically presents as an aggressive malignancy that likely has generated invasive properties and because it can originate in many different organs, treatment is very challenging. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to treat this disease.\n\nSeveral different Ca2+-related pathways such as EGR1/WT1, TRP channels, and VGCC channels have been shown to cause ovarian cancer progression. Interestingly, much of what is known about ovarian cancer and Ca2+ is based on expression and prognosis correlations, yet no real consensus has been reached on mechanistic contributions of many of these channels, or even transcription factors regulating Ca2+ signals, which will be discussed below.\n\n4.2.2. TRP channels\n\nAlthough the role of TRP channels in ovarian cancer is somewhat under-investigated, preliminary research demonstrates that multiple subclasses of TRP Channels promote ovarian cancer progression. TRPC3 has been shown to promote ovarian cancer progression by increasing cell cycle progression through Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc2 by CAMKIIα, driving progression from G2 to M phase (Yang, Zhang, & Huang, 2009). Interestingly, TRPV6 expression is elevated in ovarian cancer andTRPV6 inhibition impedes ovarian cancer tumor growth in xenograft models (Xue et al., 2018). Further, TRPV6 inhibitors, such as SOR-C13 and Lidocaine are recognized as diagnostic and/or therapeutic reagents for TRPV6-rich tumors including ovarian cancer (Bowen et al., 2013; Jiang, Gou, Zhu, Tian, & Yu, 2016). Finally, TRPM7 is also highly expressed in ovarian carcinomas (Wang et al., 2014) and is associated with phosphorylation of Ca2+-dependent survival pathways including AKT, p38/MAPK, and Src (Wang et al., 2014), the former of which has been linked to EMT in ovarian cancer (Liu et al., 2019). Because TRPC, TRPM, and TRPV channels all have therapeutics targeting them, future research into their potential as therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer could be fruitful.\n\n4.2.3. SOCE\n\nThere have been a number of studies demonstrating dysregulation of SOCE during ovarian cancer progression, although the relationship between SOCE and ovarian cancer progression remains unclear. Hence, STIM1 and Orai1 expression are both upregulated in therapy-resistant ovarian cancer cells compared to therapy-sensitive cells, leading to increased AKT activity that promotes therapy resistance (Schmidt et al., 2014). Further, Placental Growth Factor (PlGF), which is produced by gynecologic tumor cells, also upregulates expression of both STIM1 and Orai1, but has been proposed to promote ovarian cancer progression through STIM1- and Orai1-induced HIF1α expression (Abdelazeem et al., 2019). However, SOCE inhibition is protective against ROS-induced apoptosis (Wang et al., 2016) likely as a result of decreased mitochondrial Ca2+. Hence, SOCE both promotes ovarian cancer progression and sensitizes cells to apoptosis Future investigations may help to delineate the complex relationship between SOCE and ovarian cancer progression and survival.\n\nInterestingly, there have also been a number of studies linking EGR1 and WT1 with ovarian cancer progression; as discussed in Section 3.4, EGR1 and WT1 regulate STIM1 expression (Go et al., 2019; Ritchie et al., 2011; Samakai et al., 2016). The extent to which changes in STIM1 contributes to these effects is not currently clear, although these possibilities should be considered. For example, EGF-induced EGR1 expression has been demonstrated to upregulate the E-cadherin repressor Slug, leading to EMT which increases the invasive capacity and EMT activity of ovarian cancer in vitro (Cheng, Chang, & Leung, 2012) (Yan, Chen, Chen, & Chen, 2016). Downstream of EGR1, STIM1 expression has also been shown to be upregulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer leading to subsequent activation of AKT (Schmidt et al., 2014). However, the effect of STIM1 on ovarian cancer progression is somewhat understudied, there is preliminary evidence that STIM1 is associated with disease progression. In this context, EGR1 would increase ovarian cancer invasiveness. Interestingly, the role of EGR1 shifts in late stage ovarian cancer; analysis of patient databases reveal several-fold decreases in EGR1 expression in advanced carcinomas (He et al., 2015). Further, EGR1 can inhibit cyto-protective autophagy in the absence of autophagy regulator, ATG14, (He et al., 2015) indicating that these effects can be highly context-dependent.\n\nInterestingly, WT1 has been shown to drive EMT in early ovarian tumorigenesis (Hylander et al., 2006; Miller-Hodges & Hohenstein, 2012). Further, because WT1 can be correlated with poor prognosis, it is used as a marker to track ovarian cancer progression (Andersson et al., 2014). The extent to which WT1-mediated suppression of STIM1 expression and SOCE affects EMT in ovarian cancer is unknown. However, given the established relationship between Ca2+ signals and EMT (see section IIID), it is reasonable to speculate on this possibility.\n\nTherapeutically, Carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) (see ), has been proposed as a treatment for ovarian cancer (Bonnefond et al., 2018; Mignen et al., 2005), has undergone phase II clinical trials and has been suggested as a maintenance drug for relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer (Hussain et al., 2003), but has not been investigated as a first-line therapy. Although CAI has been well-established as a SOCE inhibitor, as an ovarian cancer therapeutic, CAI utilizes a different mechanism of action. Thus, CAI inhibits the expression of the Bcl2 family member myeloid leukemia cell differentiation 1 (Mcl-1) (Thomas, Lam, & Edwards, 2010), itself a negative regulator of mitochondrial Ca2+ loading (Morciano et al., 2016). As such, Mcl1 is highly protective against mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and is associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer (Shigemasa et al., 2002). Further, CAI-induced Mcl-1 inhibition is correlated with inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway (Bonnefond et al., 2018) because mTORC1 controls Mcl-1 translation through 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in ovarian carcinoma (Hsieh et al., 2010). This process relies on Ca2+ as Ca2+/calmodulin regulates mTORC1 activity since CAMKs activate mTORC1 (Li et al., 2016). In conclusion, CAI-inhibition of SOCE occurs through changes in Mcl1 expression which likely inhibits both Ca2+-dependent survival pathways and leads to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload as its primary mechanisms of action. This can prove to be promising as a novel potential target in treating ovarian cancer.\n\n4.3. Prostate cancer\n\n4.3.1. Introduction\n\nAnalogous to breast cancer in women, prostate cancer is treatable when detected early, yet prostate cancer has the highest cancer incidence and second highest total mortalities among cancers in men in the United States (Alteri, 2019). This portrays the challenge of treatments for advanced stages of disease and the need for novel treatments. Prostate cancer is also a form of adenocarcinoma mainly divided into subgroups consisting of Androgen Receptor positive (AR+) and negative (AR−). The differences between the subgroups and their dependence on Ca2+ will be discussed in great detail below.\n\nAlso, similar to breast cancer, prostate cancer is heavily reliant on receptor-mediated signaling. Specifically, normal prostates use nuclear receptor, AR, which are activated in response to androgens (Lonergan & Tindall, 2011). Activation of this receptor leads to translocation to the nucleus where it facilitates transcription of androgen related genes, such as Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), human glandular kallikrein (hK2), kallikrein related peptidase/serine protease 18 (prostase/PRSS18), and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). These genes encode for serine proteases that regulate the prostate gland including facilitating proteolytic cascades leading to production of semen (Lin et al., 1999) and promoting sperm motility and cell movement (Lin et al., 1999; Pezaro, Woo, & Davis, 2014). However, because these proteases are involved in cell movement, it also has been characterized as invasive by degrading the surrounding ECM (Lin et al., 1999; Pezaro et al., 2014). Among these proteases, there is some evidence that the presence of TMPRSS2 can act as a switch between normal prostate epithelium and prostate cancer. If untranslated, this gene fuses with E26 Transformation Specific (ETS)-transcription factors to form fusion proteins that make up the vast majority of prostate cancer subtypes (Attard et al., 2016). The most common ETS transcription factor is ERG. Thus, TMPRSS2-ERG (T2E) is the most common genetic background of prostate cancer (Tomlins et al., 2008). Furthermore, it has been shown that T2E is associated with Ca2+. Indeed, use of Ca2+ channel blockers has actually been shown to reduce risk of developing T2E prostate cancer (Geybels, McCloskey, Mills, & Stanford, 2017), since T2E is heavily reliant on CaV1.3; CaV1.3-mediated Ca2+ entry activates AR (Chen et al., 2014). Additionally, other ETS-transcription factor subtypes, as well as sub-forms with mutations of Ras/Raf, and Speckle Type POZ Protein (SPOP), a cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, also make up many individual prostate cancer genetic backgrounds (Attard et al., 2016). Hence, Ca2+ regulation has been shown to play an important role in governing AR activity, which implicates Ca2+ as a promising target for prostate cancer.\n\nCurrently, for AR+ prostate cancer, there are treatments involving inhibition of androgen production, namely Androgen-Deprivation Therapy (ADT). However, this appears to only be effective in early stages of prostate cancer and delay in treatment can lead to progression into castration resistance stages (Eisenberger et al., 1998; Pagliarulo et al., 2012; Schröder, Crawford, Axcrona, Payne, & Keane, 2012; Wen, Niu, Lee, & Chang, 2014). This is significant as it appears that hormonal regulation of prostate cells can prevent progression into later stages of disease. Most likely this is because AR actually suppresses later stages of prostate cancer progression (Niu, Altuwaijri, Yeh, et al., 2008; Niu, Altuwaijri, Lai, et al., 2008; Niu et al., 2010; Wen et al., 2014), as androgen deprivation leads to EMT since AR inhibits EMT marker, Zeb1 (Sun et al., 2012). This is further supported by evidence that androgens also contribute to homeostasis as deprivation activates damage-repairing cellular programs. For example, in the absence of androgens, cells upregulate anti-stress genes regulating detoxification, hypoxia response, DNA damage-repair, and p53 activation (Mulholland, 2012). Hence, targeting androgens appears to be very dependent on timing for effectiveness.\n\nAlong with timing, one of the biggest downfalls of androgen deprivation is in addition to AR+ subtype, AR− subtype also interacts with RTKs such as JAK/STAT pathways (reviewed in Hoang, Iczkowski, Kilari, See, & Nevalainen, 2016), which makes targeting specific pathways difficult. For example, whereas Stat5a/b are known to directly bind to AR and facilitate translocation to the nucleus in response to androgens (Tan et al., 2008), this effect can also occur in the absence of androgens due to genomic reprogramming in response to androgen deprivation (Sharma et al., 2013). Thus, progression to AR- prostate cancer occurs through the upregulation of AR-independent pathways that bypass or parallel AR signaling and lead to progression into CRPC and AR-prostate cancer (Arora et al., 2013; Hoang et al., 2016; Saraon, Jarvi, & Diamandis, 2011; Whitworth et al., 2012). An example of a bypass pathway includes activating the compensatory GPCR, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), in the absence of AR that induces a similar effect on disease progression (Arora et al., 2013; Hoang et al., 2016; Isikbay et al., 2014; Sahu et al., 2013). However, in addition to receptor-mediated signaling, it is also proposed that prostate cancer cells can undergo a Darwinian-type event where cells are selected for surviving in androgen deprived conditions (Hoang et al., 2016) most likely by the onset of Bcl2 expression (Whitworth et al., 2012). Because AR- prostate cancer is more advanced, it is more resistant to therapies including radiation, chemotherapy, and cytotoxic exposure attributing to stress responses activated in the absence of androgens (Mulholland, 2012). This makes treating AR- prostate cancer especially challenging. As a result, AR- prostate cancer therapies are limited at best. One attempt at treating AR-prostate cancer is Diethylstilbestrol (DES) (see ), which is a synthetic ethinyl estrogen used to treat hormone-induced cancers such as CRPC in men and breast cancer in postmenopausal women (Roh, Eliades, Gupta, Grant-Kels, & Tsao, 2017). In prostate cancer, DES reduces production of testosterone (androgen), which slows prostate cancer growth, however this was discontinued as it showed limited clinical response (Bossi et al., 2009), demonstrating the clear need for novel therapeutics. Because AR+ and AR− subtypes of cancer rely on receptor-mediated signaling, Ca2+ homeostasis has been implicated in the progression of prostate cancer with several Ca2+-sensitive pathways dysregulated in prostate cancer, (reviewed in Maly & Hofmann, 2018) which will be discussed in great detail below.\n\n4.3.2. SOCE\n\nProstate cancer appears to rely heavily on Ca2+-dependent signaling that dynamically regulates disease progression based on disease stage and genetic background. To this end, STIM1 and Orai1 expression have been shown to be correlated with AR levels (Berry, Birnie, Droop, Maitland, & Collins, 2011; Perrouin Verbe, Bruyere, Rozet, Vandier, & Fromont, 2016; Kappel et al., 2017). This is likely because STIM1 and Orai1 activate signaling cascades that activate AR. For example, normally, InsP3 is generated from the cleavage of PIP2 as discussed above. However, PIP2 also can be phosphorylated by PM-associated PI3 kinase (PI3K) leading to the production of PI triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 leads to activation of many downstream oncogenic pathways such as AKT and mTOR. In this regard, it has been shown that PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway contributes to prostate cancer progression. In a previous cohort of prostate cancer patients, profound alterations were reported, in each of the three genes within this pathway. Further the entire pathway was deregulated in some capacity in 42% of localized and 100% of metastatic disease cases (Edlind & Hsieh, 2014; Taylor et al., 2010). PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is Ca2+-dependent; an effect demonstrated in prostate cancer as STIM1 suppression inhibited migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro through suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (Zhou et al., 2017). Thus, Ca2+-regulation of pro-invasive pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR appear to play an instrumental role in prostate cancer progression. Further, this pathway also interacts with AR signaling (Crumbaker, Khoja, & Joshua, 2017), providing PI3K/AKT/mTOR as a potential mediator for how Ca2+ activates AR, a process that is known to occur in conjunction with gene fusions, such as T2E (Carver et al., 2009; King et al., 2009). This implicates SOCE as extremely important since it may serve as a marker for disease progression.\n\nA driving force for SOCE is receptor-mediated depletion of ER Ca2+ store release as a result of PIP2 cleavage. In contrast to PI3K converting PIP2 into PIP3, Phosphatase And Tensin Homolog (PTEN) is a PM-associated Phosphatidylinositol (PI) phosphatase which reverses this conversion leading to higher production of PIP2, and eventually InsP3, and is widely portrayed as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer ( Jamaspishvili et al., 2018). In essence, it opposes PI3K, which is discussed above. However, depletion of PTEN is also exhibited in prostate cancer (Li, Li, Sun, & Li, 2018; Wise, Hermida, & Leslie, 2017). PTEN actually uses a two-pronged approach to suppressing prostate cancer progression. First, it blocks oncogenic pathways such as PI3K and AKT, but also helps restore normal Ca2+ homeostasis by facilitating SOCE through PIP2 production leading to InsP3-induced ER Ca2+ store release. Clinically, there are no current agonists that directly bind to and activate PTEN, however, there are many agonists that activate upstream proteins that upregulate PTEN expression (reviewed in Boosani & Agrawal, 2013). Hence, PTEN agonists could present a new therapeutic target in treating prostate cancer, partially through regulating Ca2+ homeostasis.\n\nIn addition to AR directly regulating both STIM and Orai, it appears androgens also regulate upstream transcriptional regulators of STIM and Orai such as WT1/EGR1. Since EGR1/WT1 play a vital role in regulation of STIM1, and thus SOCE, it is unsurprising they significantly impact prostate cancer progression. In support, examination of WT1 and EGR1 expression in several prostate cancer cell lines revealed mainly elevated WT1 expression coinciding with low EGR1 expression (Gregg, Brown, Mintz, Piontkivska, & Fraizer, 2010). However clinically, in some prostate cancer patient cohorts, EGR1 is overexpressed, and in EGR1-deficient mice, prostate tumorigenesis was impaired (Abdulkadir, Carbone, et al., 2001; Abdulkadir, Qu, et al., 2001). In this case, EGR1-induced STIM1 expression may be vital for AR activity and disease induction, while serving as an inhibitory feature of disease progression. There is also evidence this effect could be further exacerbated by faulty imbalance between EGR1 and its corepressor, NAB2 (Abdulkadir, Carbone, et al., 2001). Conversely, corroborative studies show that WT1 is important to tumor angiogenesis and cell migration in prostate cancer (Brett, Pandey, & Fraizer, 2013; Fraizer et al., 2016), as well as inhibition of STIM1 and SOCE (Go et al., 2019), which promote disease progression. Because WT1 and EGR1 work in a dual and opposing fashion to regulate STIM1 (Go et al., 2019), considered together, timing appears to be paramount as EGR1 promotes tumorigenesis and may be reliant on NAB2 expression while WT1 promotes prostate cancer progression. Although the main role of EGR1 is transcriptional regulation of STIM1, interestingly, a group studying EGR1 binding to CpG sites in prostate cancer saw that CpG methylation was inversely correlated with disease severity, and that EGR1 binding was reduced in later stages of disease (Lin et al., 2013). This presents the possibility that CpG methylation and EGR1 binding could contribute to the mechanism of how EGR1 is inversely associated with disease progression as demethylation of EGR1 CpG-binding sites could be a potential target of prostate cancer therapy to facilitate EGR1 binding to suppress progression.\n\nSOCE as a marker for disease progression also has been substantiated clinically. STIM1 and Orai1 expression are inversely correlated with Gleason Score (Xu, Zhang, et al., 2015). Because Gleason Score is a representative marker for prostate cancer progression, this supports the model that in early stages of disease exhibiting AR+ status, STIM1 and Orai1 levels, as well as SOCE, are increased, whereas advanced AR− stages of prostate cancer exhibit lower STIM1, Orai1, and ultimately SOCE. In support, it has been further demonstrated in an androgen-sensitive cell line derived from a lymph node carcinoma of prostate cells, androgen deprivation resulted in downregulation of Orai1, and that Orai1 knockdown conferred resistance to apoptosis. This suggests that acquired resistance to apoptosis arises in part from decreased Ca2+ influx (Flourakis et al., 2010). Collectively, both in basic and translational research loss of SOCE appears to be a marker for disease progression.\n\nTherapeutically, there are several promising SOCE-targeting candidates for treatment of prostate cancer. For early stages of disease, Drebrin, an actin reorganizing protein (see ), may be a potential prostate cancer target. Drebrin has been shown to facilitate invasion through colocalizing with actin filaments and filopodia increasing Ca2+ influx (Dart et al., 2017). Although this would inhibit disease progression as AR status changes expression of STIM1 and Orai1, this is likely a key step in facilitating early stage progression of prostate cancer. A potential method to thwart Drebrin-induced invasion, is through the use of pyrazoles, such as 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazole (BTP2), inhibit SOCE. Pyrazoles are pharmacological inhibitors of Orai, and can be used to therapeutically block SOCE in a dose-dependent manner (Ohga, Takezawa, Arakida, Shimizu, & Ishikawa, 2008; Ritchie, Samakai, & Soboloff, 2012). However, not only is Drebrin associated with a variety of cancers including prostate (Dart et al., 2017) and bladder (Xu et al., 2015) among others, but knockdown of Drebrin inhibits SOCE to the same extent as inhibition by BTP2, suggesting BTP2 may inhibit Drebrin (Mercer et al., 2010). Although it has not been fully proven that BTP2 is associated with Drebrin, it would strengthen an already known connection between Ca2+ channels and cytoskeletal organization and integrity. Therefore, using pyrazoles could effectively act as a Drebrin antagonist, leading to lower SOCE in presumably early stages of prostate cancer including High Grade Prostate Intraepithelial Neoplasia (HGPIN), which is a precursor for prostate cancer (Brawer, 2005), or early AR+ stages. Although the distinction of Drebrin association with prostate cancer has been recently made known, this could be a potentially promising therapeutic target in early stages of prostate cancer, as well as other cancers where SOCE potentiates disease progression. For treatment of later stages of prostate cancer, in a first-in-human phase I clinical trial, mipsagargin, a prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted SERCA inhibitor, was able to stabilize disease in patients with advanced prostate cancer and other solid tumors (Mahalingam et al., 2016). By inhibiting SERCA, Ca2+ stores are depleted leading to activated SOCE, a known suppressor of prostate cancer progression during AR- stages. Thus, mipsagargin is a promising therapeutic tool for late stages of prostate cancer by inducing the UPR and SOCE.\n\nReflecting this, SOCE plays dual and opposing roles in prostate cancer that are receptor-status dependent. However, it is intriguing that prostate cancer and breast cancer, which both use hormone-based mechanisms for disease progression demonstrate different effects resulting from changes in SOCE. Although different, these changes are stark and conclusive which underscores the importance of studying SOCE in the context of disease progression. Because SOCE plays different roles in different prostate cancer stages, it is important to develop therapies that both potentiate and attenuate SOCE, as these could make treatment for a wide range of prostate cancer cases more feasible. Although biologics targeting SOCE are beginning to emerge, efforts should continue to be made to investigate other drugs targeting SOCE, such as PTEN agonists, as well as Drebrin and SERCA inhibitors, as novel therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.\n\n4.3.3. TRP channels\n\nAs prostate cancer relies on receptor-mediated signaling for disease progression, similar to SOCE, TRP channels have been highly implicated in prostate cancer. In this regard, as reviewed in Hantute-Ghesquier, Haustrate, Prevarskaya, and Lehen’kyi (2018), several TRP Melanin (TRPM) channels; TRPM2, TRPM4, TRPM7, and TRPM8 are all highly associated with prostate cancer. TRPM2 has been demonstrated to induce prostate cancer cell proliferation. Likely, TRPM2 translocates to the nucleus in prostate cancer cells and utilizes its C-terminal domain, which exhibits enzymatic activity, to promote proliferation in response to ADP-ribose or thermosensation (Tan & McNaughton, 2018; Zeng et al., 2010). This is intriguing as it suggests that TRPM2 proteins can facilitate transcription of pro-proliferation genes. Although it is conclusive that TRPM2 leads to increased proliferation, the mechanism is poorly understood and warrants further investigation to draw conclusions on the overall role of TRPM2 in prostate cancer progression.\n\nWhile TRPM2 may regulate proliferation, TRPM4 and TRPM7 have been shown to promote migration and invasion. Specifically, TRPM4 regulates SOCE-mediated migration as upregulation leads to depolarization of the cell, decreasing the driving force of Ca2+, which in turn decreases SOCE (Holzmann et al., 2015). It is likely that TRPM4 is upregulated in later stages of disease as STIM1, Orai1, and AR levels all decrease and disease is in AR− stages, which is suggested by (Holzmann et al., 2015). Concomitantly, TRPM7 also regulates migration and invasion, but through EMTby downregulating MMP9 and upregulating E-Cadherin (Chen, Chen, Chiu, Chen, & Shen, 2017). Although a specific connection between TRPM7 and SOCE in migration has not been established, it is known that TRPM7 associates with SOCE. Like TRPM2, TRPM7 has a C-terminal domain capable of kinase activity, and this kinase activity promotes SOCE through phosphorylating STIM1 or binding partners of STIM1 and Orai1 including Septins (Faouzi, Kilch, Horgen, Fleig, & Penner, 2017). TRPM7 may also regulate SOCE-mediated invasion indirectly as MMP and E-Cadherin production are reliant on Ca2+-flickers and many EMT pathways are receptor-mediated and Ca2+-dependent as discussed above. Together, TRPM4 inhibits, while TRPM7 promotes SOCE leading to differential effects on Ca2+ entry and invasion.\n\nFinally, many studies have focused on TRPM8 function and expression in prostate cancer. Not only is TRPM8 significantly overexpressed in many forms of prostate cancer (Tsavaler, Shapero, Morkowski, & Laus, 2001) and important for cell survival (Zhang & Barritt, 2004), but it has the unique ability to be regulated by hormone-induced changes in cancer (Monteith et al., 2007). It has been reported that TRPM8 is regulated by androgens, and associated with SOCE in early stage of prostate cancer disease (Zhang & Barritt, 2004). Further, TRPM8 knockdown and inhibition using pharmacological inhibitor, capsazepine (see ), has been shown to increase apoptosis, suggesting it plays a role in cell survival in AR+ prostate cancer. Intriguingly, menthol-induced activation of TRPM8 also increased apoptosis in AR+ prostate cancer, due to pathophysiological sustained increase in Ca2+ that leading to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. It is proposed that menthol-induced activation leads to a and is not representative of normal channel function (Zhang & Barritt, 2004). this finding This presents menthol as an interesting treatment for prostate cancer as a method of inducing mitochondrial Ca2+ overload by sustained activation of the TRPM8 channel. In conclusion, TRPM8 appears to require a tightly regulated window of activity to induce cell survival as it has dual and opposing roles in apoptosis at both poles of activity. Thus, TRPM8 knockdown and pathophysiological activity could prove effective in targeting prostate cancer.\n\nIn addition to TRPM channels promoting prostate cancer progression, TRPV channels are also associated with prostate cancer as well. TRPV6, which is more Ca2+ permeable than its other TRPV channel counterparts, is positively correlated with Gleason Score, and levels are higher in metastatic and higher stage disease compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Fixemer, Wissenbach, Flockerzi, & Bonkhoff, 2003). This is likely because TRPV6-mediated Ca2+ entry is required for NFAT activation (Fixemer et al., 2003; Lehen’kyi, Flourakis, Skryma, & Prevarskaya, 2007), which contributes to prostate cancer progression through NFAT targeting survival genes such as AP1, Fos, and Jun (Hogan, Chen, Nardone, & Rao, 2003). To this end, TRPV6 inhibitors (SOR-C13) have gone through phase 1 clinical trials in patients suffering from prostate cancer and have exhibited antitumor activity (Fu et al., 2017). Thus, TRPV6-induced NFAT activation is a promising, novel therapy for prostate cancer.\n\nConsidered together, TRP channels appear to have vastly different, yet important roles in prostate cancer progression. Inhibitors targeting TRP channels could be proven effective in combating prostate cancer by targeting pathways such as EMT, NFAT, and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. Therefore, it is imperative that we continue to investigate molecular mechanisms and their ensuing therapeutics targeting TRP channels, as this could provide, novel and effective drugs in treating prostate cancer.\n\n4.3.4. Purinergic receptors\n\nIntriguingly, purinergic receptors also appear to play a role in prostate cancer. Specifically, the presence of P2X7R may be a marker of prostate cancer since this protein is not expressed in normal prostate tissue, but expressed in 100% cases regardless of Gleason Score (Slater, Danieletto, Gidley-Baird, Teh, & Barden, 2004). Although there is not much research on how P2X7R induces prostate cancer tumorigenesis or progression, a potential mechanism of progression proposed is that P2X7R facilitates ATP-driven migration and invasion, because ATP drives induction of EMT-associated genes, such as SNAIL, as well as downregulates production of epithelial markers, such as E-Cadherin (Qiu et al., 2014). Further, it has also been shown to promote phosphorylation PI3K, AKT, and ERK1/2 (Qiu et al., 2014). Although the exact mechanism of how P2X7R promotes phosphorylation of EMT-associated pathway proteins, it is likely that the mechanism is similar to that of breast cancer, where ATP is produced at a higher rate in response to anchorage deprivation. This is supported as it is proposed that P2X7R promotes ATP-driven changes in EMT pathways including changes in protein phosphorylation and gene expression (Qiu et al., 2014). Similar to breast cancer, it is possible that the channel has differential dependence on ATP depending on stage of cancer, however, this is yet to be examined. Considered collectively, the fact that P2X7R is a marker for all stages of prostate cancer illustrates the importance of investigating this channel. As a result, antagonists could play therapeutic roles in all stages of this disease, yet no currently efficacious antagonists exist.\n\nTogether, although there is profound clinical significance in the expression of P2X7R, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this channel’s effect on prostate cancer progression is poorly understood. This presents an important, yet highly understudied avenue for understanding Ca2+ regulation of prostate cancer progression and improving prostate cancer treatments.\n\n4.4. Melanoma\n\n4.4.1.
