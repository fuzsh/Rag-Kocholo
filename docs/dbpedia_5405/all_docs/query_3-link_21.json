        "text": "Necrosis can be distinguished from apoptosis both biochemically and morphologically. The conversion of apoptotic cells into apoptotic bodies requires energy and enzymatic activity from caspases. On the other hand, necrosis is characterized by catastrophic loss of energy and cellular integrity [16]. These differences suggest that the clearance of the necrotic cell debris may differ from the clearance of apoptotic bodies. The apoptotic bodies, which are composed of closely packed organelles, cytoplasm and often nuclear fragments [56], are cleared by resident phagocytes (e.g. macrophages) and parenchymal cells by a process termed efferocytosis (“carrying to the grave”) [16, 57]. Although general phagocytosis and efferocytosis are mechanistically similar processes, their outcome is different. Phagocytosis of bacteria or necrotic cells triggers a pro-inflammatory response, whereas efferocytosis triggers resolution of inflammation, regeneration of functional tissue and restoration of homeostasis [58]. Whereas apoptotic bodies are completely engulfed during efferocytosis, necrotic cell debris was shown to be cleared by a process resembling macropinocytosis in vitro, which involves the co-ingestion of extracellular fluid and necrotic target material [59, 60]. Besides local phagocytosis by leukocytes, there is accumulating evidence that systemic mechanisms are also involved in necrotic cell debris clearance. In this review, we focus on systemic clearance mechanisms present in the bloodstream and vasculature that often cooperate to drive the removal of necrotic cell debris, as illustrated in Fig. 2.\n\nDeoxyribonucleases (DNases)\n\nIn general, the removal of extracellular DNA is essential to limit inflammation and to prevent autoimmunity, which is primarily achieved through DNA cleavage by DNases or capture by macrophages. Hence, DNases play a crucial role in the intra- and extracellular clearance of DNA during physiological processes, such as cell differentiation, but also following excessive cell death [61]. The DNase 1 protein family comprises DNase 1 along with its three related nucleases DNase 1-like 1 (1L1), DNase 1L2, and DNase 1L3, all characterized by similar biochemical properties. More specifically, their nuclease activity requires the presence of Ca2+ in combination with Mg2+, Co2+ or Mn2+ as co-factor. The specific combination of the co-factor and DNase dictates its pH optimum, ranging from pH 5 to pH 9, but in general, a neutral pH of 7–7.5 [62]. DNase 1 protein family members are endonucleases and cleave double-stranded DNA into two oligonucleotides with 5’-phospho and 3’-hydroxy ends, resulting in the formation of di-, tri- or tetra-oligonucleotides [63].\n\nDNase 1 and DNase 1L3 are the extracellular DNases responsible for the majority of DNase activity in the circulation [64,65,66]. DNase 1 is produced by a variety of endocrine and exocrine glands that line the gastrointestinal and urogenital tract (e.g. the liver, parotid gland, and kidney). This broad expression profile causes DNase 1 to be the major nuclease found in almost all mammalian body fluids, such as blood, urine, and saliva [67, 68]. DNase 1L3 is also known as DNase γ, DNase Y, nh-DNase or LS-DNase, and is secreted by mononuclear phagocytes, more specifically dendritic cells and macrophages in the liver, spleen and intestine [69]. In terms of substrate specificity, DNase 1 preferentially cleaves double-stranded “naked” linker DNA, whereas DNase 1L3 is more effective against membrane- and/or protein-associated DNA (e.g. chromatin) [70,71,72].\n\nAlthough the core domains of both DNases resemble each other, there are some key structural differences that explain their enzymatic activity. First, actin has the well-known ability to inhibit DNase 1 [73] (Fig. 3). DNase 1 and monomeric G-actin bind with high affinity by forming a 1:1 stochiometric complex, thereby inhibiting both its nuclease activity and G-actin polymerization [74, 75]. Moreover, DNase 1 binds to F-actin and induces its depolymerization to G-actin [75]. In contrast, DNase 1L3 is naturally resistant to actin inhibition due to multiple differences in the actin recognition site. Determinants for actin resistance include electrostatic repulsion between DNase 1L3 and actin, as well as the lack of stabilizing salt bridges between both molecules [76]. Second, previous research suggested that the specific activity of DNase 1L3 could be attributed to its C-terminal domain (CTD) [69]. McCord et al. identified the CTD to be a positively charged polypeptide that extends from the enzymatic core and possesses conformational versatility. Interestingly, they found that the CTD interacts with DNA to increase the net affinity of DNase 1L3 for its DNA substrate, and thereby allows DNase 1L3 to interact with a diversity of DNA complexes [76]. However, Englert et al. discovered by engineering a dual-active DNase with combined DNase 1 and DNase 1L3 activities that the ability of DNase 1L3 to degrade chromatin is embedded into three distinct areas of the enzyme’s core body. Two of these domains correspond to actin recognition sites in DNase 1, which are absent in DNase 1L3. The third domain in DNase 1L3 contains three additional lysine residues compared to DNase 1, resulting in an increase in both its DNA-binding affinity and DNA-degrading activity [72].\n\nDuring apoptosis, DNA is cleaved by the nucleases apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), endonuclease G and caspase-activated DNase (CAD) [77]. However, necrotic cell death does not typically involve the activity of these intracellular nucleases. In addition, under physiological circumstances, three prime exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is involved in the degradation of cytosolic DNA, but oxidized DNA is resistant to TREX1-mediated degradation, resulting in lack of DNA fragmentation in cells that undergo necrosis [78]. Therefore, the burden of clearing necrotic DNA is likely left to DNase 1 and DNase 1L3 after necrotic cells lose plasma membrane integrity. Although these circulating DNases are abundantly present, necrotic DNA accumulates in tissue injury sites for days [79, 80]. Delayed DNA degradation plays an important role during injury, and may be caused by either genetic defects in the production of DNases, or inhibition of DNase activity by molecules that are released into the bloodstream. Table 1 summarizes a list of acute injury conditions in which DNase protein levels or activity were altered. Overall, DNase activity is reduced in blood upon a variety of injuries, both in patients and mice.\n\nAs mentioned above, an initial reason for problematic DNA degradation is due to deficiencies in DNase production. For example, mice that lack DNase 1 exhibited delayed chromatin clearance after the injection of purified chromatin [81]. Moreover, DNase 1 and DNase 1L3 have been reported to degrade NETs following neutrophilia and sepsis, and deficiencies in the production of both DNases resulted in intravascular clot formation by these traps, which led to blood vessel obstruction and severe organ damage [64]. Importantly, removal of DNA released during cell death is essential to avoid autoimmunity. SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the production of anti-nuclear antibodies (e.g. anti-DNA autoantibodies) [82]. DNase 1- and DNase 1L3-deficient mice develop SLE-like disease, characterized by the presence of anti-nuclear antibodies [69, 83], and mutations in DNase 1 and DNase 1L3 have been associated with this condition in humans [84, 85]. Notably, the reduction in DNase activity could also be attributed to the generation of anti-DNase 1 antibodies. These antibodies were identified in both SLE and Sjögren’s syndrome, another autoimmune disease that is also characterized by diminished DNase 1 activity [82].\n\nA second reason for reduced DNase activity is the occurrence of nuclease inhibition in serum. DNase 1 is inhibited by actin, which is found elevated in the bloodstream in a number of diseases including trauma and burn injury. Similarly, DNase 1L3 activity is inhibited due to proteolysis by plasmin, also commonly activated during injuries [66]. Interestingly, DNase 1 and the plasminogen system work together in vitro to facilitate chromatin breakdown by simultaneously degrading DNA and DNA-binding proteins. More specifically, proteolysis by plasmin facilitates internucleosomal chromatin breakdown by the cleavage of linker histone H1 [65]. In addition, the displacement of DNA-binding proteins from chromatin was mimicked by the addition of heparin [66, 81]. In contrast to the plasminogen system, heparin displaces both core and linker histones, and thus results in random chromatin cleavage. Although heparin and the plasminogen system improved chromatin degradation by DNase 1, both inhibited chromatin degradation by DNase 1L3 [66] (Fig. 3).\n\nNumerous studies have reported DNase use as a promising treatment for pulmonary diseases, in particular for CF. However, the presence of actin in, for example, the sputum of CF patients can inhibit DNase 1-mediated DNA degradation, impeding its therapeutic effect in CF and other diseases. To minimize actin inhibition, DNase 1 was reengineered as Pulmozyme (dornase alfa). However, the addition of either gelsolin, which enhances actin depolymerization, or polyanions to disrupt the electrostatic interactions within the polymers further improved its DNase efficacy, indicating that inhibition by DNA-actin complexes still remains [49]. Dornase alfa has been approved for the treatment of CF, where it led to improved lung function and decreased pulmonary exacerbations (i.e. periods with breathing difficulties) [86]. Interestingly, the subtype DNase 1L2 is resistant to actin inhibition and showed 4-fold higher potency in reducing viscosity of actin-containing artificial mucus compared to dornase alfa [87]. Besides positive effects in CF, it has been proven that DNase 1 treatment reduces inflammation in multiple animal models of disease [88]. Table 2 summarizes a list of murine models in which DNase 1 was used as a treatment. In general, DNase 1 treatment reduced levels of circulating DNA, decreased pathology and inflammation.\n\nThe actin-scavenger system\n\nThe sequestration of actin released into the extracellular environment is essential to avoid organ damage and to restore DNase activity. However, the relationship between chromatin, actin, DNases and the actin-scavenger system is complex due to their dynamic interactions. The extracellular actin-scavenger system consists of two plasma proteins, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) or Gc-globulin, and gelsolin, whose combined action protects the organism from the deleterious effects of extracellular actin polymerization [89]. Gelsolin was first described as a cytoplasmic actin-binding protein, composed of six homologous domains and three actin-binding sites: two monomer-binding sites and one filament-binding site. Further studies revealed a secreted isoform of gelsolin that was identified to be structurally similar but not identical to cytoplasmic gelsolin [90]. The majority of plasma gelsolin is produced by skeletal muscle [91] and it is involved in severing F-actin to G-actin extracellularly, thus, disassembling F-actin fragments in plasma. The resulting G-actin monomers are bound by DBP, which releases gelsolin from actin. DBP, a 58 kDa multifunctional plasma protein mainly synthesized by the liver [92], forms high affinity (Kd = 10−9 M) 1:1 stochiometric complexes with monomeric G-actin, also preventing actin polymerization [93]. Subsequently, the DBP-actin complex is rapidly cleared from the circulation (half-life of ≈ 30 min) by the hepatic reticuloendothelial system, which consists of the liver’s sinusoidal endothelial cells, as well as the tissue-resident Kupffer cells [94]. Thus, the two proteins work in a concerted fashion in circulation, with gelsolin depolymerizing actin filaments and DBP complexing and targeting actin for clearance (Fig. 3).\n\nIt has been shown that injury often results in overloading of the actin-scavenger system, which becomes quickly saturated. More specifically, injection of monomeric G-actin into the bloodstream of rats resulted in a decrease in the plasma levels of the actin-scavenger system molecules and polymerization of G-actin into F-actin in the vasculature. This led to intravascular obstruction by the filaments and endothelial injury in the pulmonary circulation [95]. A summary of conditions in which the actin-scavenger system was affected has been listed in Table 3. Acute tissue injury settings, such as acute liver failure [96, 97], burn injury [22] and traumatic brain injury [18], are accompanied by a reduction in plasma gelsolin and/or DBP levels. Even during chronic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, plasma gelsolin levels were reduced [48, 98]. Moreover, the actin-scavenger system molecules may also be released into other body fluids, where actin is exposed, and form complexes to neutralize its toxic effects. The presence of actin and gelsolin-actin complexes in synovial fluids of rheumatoid arthritis patients corroborates the local consumption of the potentially anti-inflammatory gelsolin in the inflamed joint [48]. Furthermore, following burn injury, actin complexed with gelsolin or DBP was detected in burn wound fluid [99].\n\nWidespread release of actin and depletion of the extracellular actin-scavenger system proteins can be correlated with poor outcomes in diverse clinical conditions, such as trauma [100]. In intensive care unit patients, lower serum gelsolin levels were correlated with a deceased chance of discontinuation from mechanical ventilation within 28 days. Furthermore, these patients were less likely to be discharged from intensive care by day 14 compared to patients with higher baseline gelsolin levels [101]. In addition, children with acute liver failure presented reduced serum DBP levels, and patients with poorer outcomes generally had lower DBP levels than those with more favorable prognoses. In this way, serum DBP level is a promising marker to identify high-risk patients [97]. Taken together, these findings support the potential use of actin-scavenging molecules as therapeutic agents for a plethora of clinical conditions.\n\nThe treatment with components of the actin-scavenger system is less studied than treatment with DNases. In two murine models of sepsis (endotoxemia and cecal ligation/puncture), repletion of plasma gelsolin led to solubilization of circulating actin aggregates and a reduction in mortality. Additionally, plasma gelsolin treatment promoted an anti-inflammatory shift in endotoxemic mice, characterized by elevated IL-10 levels [102]. In the context of neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia, serving as a murine model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, F-actin promoted pro-inflammatory signaling through CLEC9A on CD103+ dendritic cells. Treatment with gelsolin, and thus F-actin scavenging, effectively blocked neonatal hyperoxia-induced inflammatory responses to rhinovirus infection, in particular by inhibiting IL-12, TNF-α and IFN-γ production. Moreover, gelsolin blocked hyperoxia-induced CD103+ dendritic cell expansion, further preventing inflammatory responses, and aided in preserving alveolarization in the mice [103]. As described before, DNase is known as a highly effective and well-tolerated mucolytic agent in CF. When gelsolin was added to DNase 1 treatment, a synergistic effect was observed, resulting in a two-fold higher rate of sputum fluidization [104]. This is supported by the observation that gelsolin activated DNase 1 by disassembling the actin-DNase 1 complex [105].\n\nThe fibrinolytic system\n\nThe acute-phase response involves the synergistic activation of inflammation and coagulation, and is a common pathological feature of injury. During injury, vascular rupture and increased permeability allow hemostatic factors to enter the damaged tissue and initiate tissue repair [106]. The intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways culminate in the activation of prothrombin into thrombin, which converts fibrinogen into fibrin that serves as a scaffold for thrombus formation [107]. Thus, fibrin deposition within damaged tissues is a common feature in numerous diseases, such as inflammatory arthritis, colitis, neuroinflammatory and musculoskeletal disease, bacterial infection and chemical liver injury [108]. Alongside coagulation, the fibrinolytic system is initiated to drive plasmin activation and destroy the fibrin clot, balancing out the vascular occlusion and promoting injury resolution. In more detail, the zymogen plasminogen is activated into plasmin, a serine protease responsible for fibrin degradation [109]. The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin is primarily mediated by tissue or urokinase plasminogen activators (tPa or uPA), while inhibition of fibrinolysis is predominantly governed by three inhibitors: plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), α2-antiplasmin and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). Active PAI-1 regulates plasminogen activation by direct binding to free tPa, resulting in the formation of tPa-PAI-1 complexes and the subsequent loss of activity of tPa and plasmin. α2-antiplasmin prevents fibrin breakdown by binding irreversibly to the active site of plasmin [110]. Thrombin or thrombin-thrombomodulin complexes inhibit fibrinolysis by activating TAFI, which cleaves C-terminal lysine residues of fibrin and results in decreased accumulation of plasminogen and thus fibrinolysis [111].\n\nDuring mild injury, plasmin is activated at the site of damage, where it is involved in fibrinolysis and resolving inflammation. However, during severe injury, plasmin activation increases damage by excessive fibrinolytic activity [46]. In addition, plasmin has a wide range of inflammatory actions, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and complement activation, potentiating TLR signaling and NF-κB-mediated cytokine activation [107]. Furthermore, in burn injury patients, plasmin activation is a key component of the systemic cytokine storm, and inhibition of plasmin limits the tissue-damaging inflammation following injury. This was illustrated in a mouse model of burn injury, by a reduction in both plasma IL-6 levels and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [112]. Nonetheless, plasmin could also play a crucial role in facilitating tissue healing through the elimination of necrotic cell debris. For example, in a mouse model of drug-induced liver injury, plasmin inhibition completely prevented upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF, CXCL1 and CXCL2) and reduced serum CCL2 protein levels. This was confirmed by treatment of Kupffer cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages with plasmin, which resulted in increased expression of these mediators and formation of pseudopodia. Furthermore, co-treatment with HMGB1 and plasmin showed a synergistic effect on plasmin’s cytokine upregulation. Crucially, inhibition of plasmin prevented clearance of necrotic cells from the liver as late as 72 hours, as well as monocyte and macrophage trafficking into the injured liver, indicating that plasmin was implicated in immune cell recruitment and recovery in injured sites [113]. Finally, in mouse models of traumatic and ischemia-reperfusion injury in the liver, plasminogen played a central role in macrophage and neutrophil recruitment to the damaged tissue [114]. In essence, evidence suggests that plasmin activation fuels the innate immune response during injury and indirectly facilitates the clearance of necrotic cell debris. However, plasmin was also shown to have significant direct effects on necrotic cells. As previously mentioned, plasmin collaborates with DNase 1 to degrade chromatin. More specifically, plasmin degrades the linker histone H1, thereby enhancing DNase 1 access to “naked” DNA for more efficient cleavage [65]. Moreover, it was shown by Samson et al. that cell death and loss of plasma membrane integrity lead to protein misfolding and crosslinking via disulfide bonding. The crosslinking and aggregation of cellular proteins including tubulins, HSPs, actin, and GAPDH led to the binding and activation of tPA, which in turn activated plasmin on necrotic cells. Proteolytic cleavage by plasmin was demonstrated to be central to degrade cellular debris in vitro in multiple cell types. Importantly, this mechanism was validated in vivo in plasminogen-deficient mice, which presented elevated levels of insoluble debris in the brain after traumatic brain injury [115, 116]. In addition, activation of plasmin on necrotic cells increased phagocytosis by monocyte-derived dendritic cells. This effect required plasmin to be proteolytically active but not to degrade the target, since phagocytosis of plastic microparticles was also increased in the presence of active plasmin. Interestingly, plasmin-treated dendritic cells retained an immature phenotype and produced more TGF-β, indicating that plasmin activity on necrotic debris assists its removal while restraining the capacity of the debris to induce an immune response by dendritic cells [117].\n\nHyperfibrinolysis (i.e. excessive fibrinolytic activity) is characteristic of early phases of severe injury, nonetheless, it was shown that fibrinolysis is also inhibited later “beyond a physiologic level” [118]. Severe blunt trauma in rats was found to induce a significant increase in plasma tPa levels, overwhelming its inhibition by PAI-1. Afterwards, plasma PAI-1 levels increased exponentially, restoring the balance between tPA and PAI-1 in the plasma [119]. This was confirmed in patients suffering from traumatic brain injury, in which hypercoagulability, fibrinolysis and fibrinolysis shutdown were activated consecutively [118]. Because actin is released from dying cells, it may be trapped in fibrin clots that form at sites of tissue injury. More specifically, F-actin was shown to interact with fibrin (but not fibrinogen) in a 2:1 stochiometric manner [120]. In vitro experiments provided further support, confirming that the presence of actin in plasma modifies the structure and degradability of fibrin clots, resulting in thinner fibers and delayed plasmin-induced fibrinolysis [46]. Moreover, actin serves as a noncompetitive inhibitor of plasmin by binding to the lysine-binding sites in the kringle domains, effectively obstructing plasmin binding to fibrin [121]. Thus, actin contributes to both clot propagation and fibrinolysis shutdown, through its role in plasmin inhibition. Additionally, it is known that histones, which are rich in positively charged lysine and arginine residues, interact with fibrin and increase resistance to fibrinolysis [122]. The presence of histones in clots alongside fibrin and DNA disrupts the lateral organization of protofibrils, resulting in a fibrin network that exhibits increased resistance to fibrinolysis, despite made up of thick fibers [123]. To summarize, fibrin deposition influences the degradation of necrotic cell debris, as it interacts with components such as actin and histones, potentially hindering the process by increasing resistance to fibrinolysis (Fig. 3).\n\nThe reticuloendothelial system\n\nAlthough multiple molecules and factors promote systemic clearance of cell debris, the role of the cellular reticuloendothelial system in debris clearance cannot be overstated. A century ago, Aschoff introduced the concept of the reticuloendothelial system, outlining a principle of particle uptake and degradation by both tissue-specific macrophages and endothelial cells of the liver, adrenal gland, pituitary gland, spleen and bone marrow sinusoids [124]. The liver is home to the largest reticuloendothelial system in the body, comprising both the Kupffer cells and the fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Kupffer cells are the tissue-resident macrophages of the liver, constituting 80% to 90% of all resident tissue macrophages in the entire body, which highlights their importance. Positioned in the sinusoid vasculature, particularly near the portal areas, Kupffer cells are directly exposed to the circulation and form the first line of hepatic defense by utilizing their array of PRRs to scavenge DAMPs released by dying cells [125]. Upon activation, Kupffer cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF) and chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8, and CCL2), resulting in the recruitment of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes to the site of injury [126]. In parallel, with a total surface area of 210 m2 in an adult human liver, the LSECs are responsible for filtering vast amounts of particles passing through the bloodstream. They are the only fenestrated endothelium in the body with open passage between the blood and underlying parenchyma, with the numerous 100–150 nm diameter fenestrations of the LSECs clustered together in “sieve plates”. These facilitate the internalization of a myriad of macromolecules [127, 128]. Of note, not all species have their SECs in the liver, as mammals do. Bony fish have theirs situated in the endocardium of the heart and renal sinusoid, while in cartilaginous fish, lamprey, and hagfish, this is in the gills [129].\n\nDue to their strategic position within the liver sinusoids and thus close interaction with the circulation, both LSECs and Kupffer cells embody the dual-cell principle of waste clearance, and serve as systemic clearance mechanisms, as illustrated in Fig. 4. More specifically, the LSECs are responsible for clearing bloodborne debris primarily via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<200 nm), whereas Kupffer cells mostly phagocytose particles larger than 200 nm in size [125, 128]. Moreover, LSECs contain approximately twice the amount of clathrin-coated pits per membrane compared to hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, indicating a high endocytic capacity. This notably high endocytic activity is mediated by scavenger receptors such as stabilin-1, stabilin-2, FcγRIIb2 and the mannose receptor (CD206). Interestingly, both Kupffer cells and LSECs contribute to FcγR-mediated clearance of circulating IgG immune complexes, with LSECs exclusively using FcγRIIb2. Moreover, size dependency has been observed, with a higher number of antibodies complexed to the antigen resulting in an increased direction of the complexes to Kupffer cells [127].\n\nLSECs and Kupffer cells exhibit both complementary and overlapping scavenging activity, and their receptors have already been extensively characterized. However, there are conflicting reports on the expression of CD206 on Kupffer cells, and Kupffer cell homogeneity in general [124, 130]. In healthy murine livers, the existence of two subsets of Kupffer cell populations has been proposed, based on the expression of CD206 and endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM): a major CD206loESAM– population (KC1) and a minor CD206hiESAM+ population (KC2) [131, 132]. However, all genes specifically found in KC2s (e.g. CD36) are also expressed by LSECs, suggesting the possibility of cross-contamination between these populations [130, 131]. In contrast, a transcriptome and proteome profiling study in rats found that LSECs and Kupffer cells equally express CD206, but revealed that CD36 was expressed on Kupffer cells while absent on LSECs [133]. Further research is required to elucidate the receptor profiles of Kupffer cells and LSECs. While both cell types have had their receptors and scavenging activity investigated individually, comparative studies considering both components of the dual-cell system remain a rarity. Furthermore, in the context of injury and necrotic cell debris clearance, there is limited knowledge regarding which DAMPs are scavenged by the expressed receptors. Table 4 presents a comparative summary of the receptors expressed by LSECs and Kupffer cells with their respective necrotic cell debris ligands. It is important to note that while the expression of receptors and the binding of ligands have been confirmed, the clearance of necrotic debris ligands by these cells and receptors remains unverified. Once the debris is taken up, the LSECs and Kupffer cells utilize an array of lysosomal enzymes to degrade the endocytosed contents, including but not limited to acid phosphatase, acid lipase, acid DNase (i.e. DNase 2), cathepsin D, β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase and β-acetylglucosaminidase. Interestingly, the high protein content of parenchymal cells gives them higher individual cell enzyme activity than either LSECs or Kupffer cells, though specific activities are higher in the latter two. Even between the two, there are stark differences; acid phosphatase, DNase 2 and β-acetylglucosaminidase have increased activity in LSECs, while acid lipase, β-glucuronidase and cathepsin D are more active in the Kupffer cells [134]. The clearance activity of both cell types is highlighted by the fact that lysosomes constitute 6.9% of the volume in LSECs and 13.6% in Kupffer cells. Furthermore, 26% of the total lysosomal volume of an adult rat liver is found in the Kupffer cells, while 17% is found in LSECs [127]."
