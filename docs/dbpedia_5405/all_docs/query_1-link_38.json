So this study was conducted to know the etiology of cases of non - traumatic Quadriparesis and its outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 adult patients admitted in medical and neurology wards with non - traumatic quadriparesis were prospectively studied b etween October â2012 to September â2014at Government General Hospital, Kakinada, a teaching hospital with rural referrals. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS: In the study cohort of 50 cases the age of patients ranged from 13 to 80 years with more number of male patients. 29 patients (58% presented with flaccid and 21 cases (42% with spastic quadriparesis. Guillian barre syndrome with 18 (36% cases was the most common cause of quadriparesis followed by Spondylotic myelopathy 11 cases ( 22% and Hypokalemic perio dic paralysis in 8 cases (16%. Transverse Myelitis. Caries spine. Secondaries cervical spine, spinal epidural abscess were in other cases.7 (14% patients had cranial nerve dysfunction. 4(8% patients had facial nerve palsy . CONCLUSION: Guillian barre syn drome constituted the most common cause of nontraumatic quadriparesis, followed by Spondylotic myelopathy, Transverse Myelitis. Caries spine. S econdaries cervical spine, spinal epidural abscess . AIDP and Hypokalemic periodic paralysis were the most frequen t causes of flaccid quadriparesis while Spondylotic myelopathy was the most common cause of spastic quadriparesis .

It has been reported to be related to chronic repetitive mechanical stress of the periscapular tissue, trauma, overuse, and focal muscle weakness. The authors experienced an atypical case of scapulothoracic bursitis with shoulder and periscapular pain after quadriparesis. This case implies that muscular atrophy around the scapula and chest wall from quadriparesis may contribute to the development of scapulothoracic bursitis with shoulder and periscapular pain. In addition, clinician should be alert to it as a possible cause when a patient with quadriparesis complains of shoulder and periscapular pain and consider proper diagnostic options such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging.

As reported here, clinical features may be delayed after the causal head injury (often weeks, and the trauma may even be forgotten. Cases manifesting bilateral haematomas are quite rare. The mechanism for quadriparesis is not fully understood. Motor deficit in the arms can be explained by direct compression or distortion of the cerebral hemispheres. This would not, however, account for motor weakness in the legs because the cortical areas responsible for the lower limbs would be relatively protected from the direct effect of compression. CSDH can present in many clinical scenarios, and may develop in the absence of a reported head injury. The diagnosis of CSDH should be considered in the differential when investigating cases of quadriplegia of uncertain aetiology, especially in the elderly population.\n\nRapidly worsening bulbar symptoms in a patient with spinobulbar muscular atrophy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMontserrat Diaz-Abad\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedyâs disease affects muscles and motor neurons, manifesting as weakness and wasting of bulbar, facial, and proximal limb muscles due to loss of anterior horn cells in the brain and spinal cord.

The disease is caused by the expansion of a CAG/glutamine tract in the amino-terminus of the androgen receptor. That SBMA exclusively affects males reflects the fact that critical pathogenic events are hormone-dependent. These include translocation of the polyglutamine androgen receptor from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and unfolding of the mutant protein. Studies of the pathology of SBMA subjects have revealed nuclear aggregates of the mutant androgen receptor, loss of lower motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, and both neurogenic and myopathic changes in skeletal muscle. Mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis include toxicity in both lower motor neurons and skeletal muscle, where effects on transcription, intracellular transport, and mitochondrial function have been documented. Therapies to treat SBMA patients remain largely supportive, although experimental approaches targeting androgen action or promoting degradation of the mutant androgen receptor protein or the encoding RNA are under active study.

Although tremor is known to occur in this disease, the number of reported cases of SBMA with tremor is rare, and the number with videotaped documentation is exceedingly rare. Our aim was to describe/document the characteristic signs of tremor in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.Case Report: We report a case of a 58âyearâold male with a positive family history of tremor. On examination, the patient had jaw and hand tremors but he also exhibited gynecomastia, progressive bulbar paresis, and wasting and weakness primarily in the proximal limb muscles. The laboratory tests revealed an elevated creatine phosphokinase. Genetic testing was positive for XâSBMA, with 42 CAG repeats.Discussion: Essential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders, yet it is important for clinicians to be aware of the presence of other distinguishing features that point to alternative diagnoses. The presence of action tremor associated with muscle atrophy and gynecomastia should lead to a suspicion of SBMA.\n\nOccupational mercury vapour poisoning with a respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum and severe quadriparesis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJakub Smiechowicz\n\n2017-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Objectives: Despite restrictions, mercury continues to pose a health concern. Mercury has the ability to deposit in most parts of the body and can cause a wide range of unspecific symptoms leading to diagnostic mistakes. Methods and results: We report the case of severe mercury vapour poisoning after occupational exposure in a chloralkali plant worker that resulted in life-threatening respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum and quadriparesis. Conclusions: Prolonged mechanical ventilation and treatment with penicillamine and spironolactone was used with successful outcome.\n\nPathogenesis-targeting therapeutics for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSuzuki, Keisuke; Kastuno, Masahisa; Banno, Haruhiko; Sobue, Gen\n\n2009-08-01\n\nSpinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an hereditary, adult-onset, lower motor neuron disease caused by an aberrant elongation of a trinucleotide CAG repeat, which encodes the polyglutamine tract, in the first exon of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. The main symptoms are slowly progressive muscle weakness and atrophy of bulbar, facial and limb muscles. The cardinal histopathological findings of SBMA are an extensive loss of lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord as well as in brainstem motor nuclei and intranuclear accumulations of mutant AR protein in the residual motor neurons. Androgen deprivation therapy rescues neuronal dysfunction in animal models of SBMA, suggesting that the molecular basis for motor neuron degeneration in this disorder is testosterone-dependent nuclear accumulation of the mutant AR. Suppression of disease progression by leuprorelin acetate has also been demonstrated in a phase 2 clinical trial. In addition, the clarification of pathophysiology leads to appearance of candidate drugs to treat this devastating disease: heat shock protein (HSP) inducer, Hsp90 inhibitor, and histone deacetylase inhibitor. Advances in basic and clinical research on SBMA are now paving the way for clinical application of pathogenesis-targeting therapeutics.\n\nReview: Non-transecting bulbar urethroplasty using buccal mucosa ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nReview: Non-transecting bulbar urethroplasty using buccal mucosa.

During the diagnostic approach, it is crucial to obtain a detailed case history, including: onset of weakness, history of associated febrile states, ingestion of toxic substances/toxins, immunizations, and family history. Neurological examination must be meticulous as well. In this review, we describe the most common diseases related to acute muscle weakness, grouped into the site of origin (from the upper motor neuron to the motor unit. Early detection of hyperCKemia may lead to a myositis diagnosis, and hypokalemia points to the diagnosis of periodic paralysis. Ophthalmoparesis, ptosis and bulbar signs are suggestive of myasthenia gravis or botulism. Distal weakness and hyporeflexia are clinical features of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, the most frequent cause of acute muscle weakness. If all studies are normal, a psychogenic cause should be considered. Finding the etiology of acute muscle weakness is essential to execute treatment in a timely manner, improving the prognosis of affected children.\n\nA protocol for identification of early bulbar signs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBall, L J; Willis, A; Beukelman, D R; Pattee, G L\n\n2001-10-15\n\nThe purpose of this project is to identify characteristics that may be of assistance in establishing the diagnosis and monitoring early progression of bulbar dysfunction in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Early identification of bulbar dysfunction would assist in clinical trials and management decisions. A database of 218 clinic visits of patients with ALS was developed and formed the basis for these analyses. As a framework for the description of our methodology, the Disablement Model [World Health Organization. WHO International classification of impairment, activity, and participation: beginner's guide. In: WHO, editor. Beta-1 draft for field trials; 1999] was utilized. Our data identified that the strongest early predictors of bulbar speech dysfunction include altered voice quality (laryngeal control), speaking rate, and communication effectiveness. A protocol for measuring these speech parameters was therefore undertaken. This paper presents the protocol used to measure these bulbar parameters.\n\nMulti-disciplinary clinical protocol for the diagnosis of bulbar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChiaramonte, Rita; Di Luciano, Carmela; Chiaramonte, Ignazio; Serra, Agostino; Bonfiglio, Marco\n\n2018-04-23\n\nThe objective of this study was to examine the role of different specialists in the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to understand changes in verbal expression and phonation, respiratory dynamics and swallowing that occurred rapidly over a short period of time. 22 patients with bulbar ALS were submitted for voice assessment, ENT evaluation, Multi-Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP), spectrogram, electroglottography, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. In the early stage of the disease, the oral tract and velopharyngeal port were involved. Three months after the initial symptoms, most of the patients presented hoarseness, breathy voice, dysarthria, pitch modulation problems and difficulties in pronunciation of explosive, velar and lingual consonants. Values of MDVP were altered. Spectrogram showed an additional formant, due to nasal resonance. Electroglottography showed periodic oscillation of the vocal folds only during short vocal cycle. Swallowing was characterized by weakness and incoordination of oro-pharyngeal muscles with penetration or aspiration. A specific multidisciplinary clinical protocol was designed to report vocal parameters and swallowing disorders that changed more quickly in bulbar ALS patients. Furthermore, the patients were stratified according to involvement of pharyngeal structures, and severity index.

Here, we investigate the use of pedicled rectus abdominis muscle and fascia flap sling of the bulbar urethra for treatment for male-acquired urinary incontinence. Ten patients with acquired urinary incontinence were included in the study. Urinary incontinence was secondary to TURP in three patients and was secondary to posterior urethroplasty performed following traumatic pelvic fracture in seven patients. Pedicled rectus abdominalis muscle and fascial flaps, approximately 2.5 cm wide and 15 cm long, were isolated. The flaps were inserted into a perineal incision through a subcutaneous tunnel. The free end of the flap was sectioned to form two muscle strips, each 3 cm in length, and inserted into the space between bulbar urethra and corpus cavernosa. After adequate sling tension had been achieved, the two strips of muscle were anastomosed around the bulbar urethra using a 2-zero polyglactin suture. The patients were followed up for between 12 and 82 months (mean 42.8 months). Complete continence was achieved with good voiding in seven of the 10 patients. In other three patients achieved good voiding following catheter removal, but incontinence was only moderately improved. A pedicled rectus muscle fascial sling of the bulbar urethra is an effective and safe treatment for male patients with mild to moderate acquired urinary incontinence, but it may not be suitable for severe incontinence or for patients with weak rectus abdominalis muscles.\n\n[Effective acupoints for bulbar paralysis by professor GAO Weibin].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKang, Lianru; Zheng, Shuang\n\n2016-04-01\n\nProfessor GAO Weibin academically advocates, based on basic theory of TCM and theories of different schools, modern science technology should be used for the methods and principles of acupuncture and Chinese medicine for neuropathy, so as to explore and summarize the rules, characteristics and advantages of TCM for nervous system disease, especially bulbar paralysis.

We describe a case of thyrotoxicosis with bulbar palsy, encephalopathy, and pyramidal tract dysfunction. Case Report. 64-year-old white male with toxic multinodular goiter presented with rapid atrial fibrillation. He had mild tremor, normal cranial nerve examination, 4/5 strength in all extremities, normal reflexes, and down going plantars. TSH was low at 0.09 (normal: 0.34â5.6âuIU/mL, and free T4 was high at 5.22 (normal: 0.47â1.41âng/dL. Despite optimal AV nodal blockade, he had persistent rapid atrial fibrillation. He later developed cervical dystonia, rigidity, clonus, dysarthria, dysphagia, vocal cord palsy, and absent gag reflex. Thyroid storm was suspected. Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were nondiagnostic. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies were negative. Swallow ability was impaired with heavy secretions. Remarkable improvement in symptoms was noted after initiation of treatment for thyroid storm. Conclusion. Pyramidal tract symptoms and bulbar palsy may occur with thyrotoxicosis. Cranial nerve involvement and encephalopathy raise a question of primary brain mechanism causing bulbar palsy. This is reversible with prompt treatment of thyroid storm.\n\nBulbar impairment score and survival of stable amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients after noninvasive ventilation initiation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSancho, JesÃºs; MartÃ­nez, Daniel; Bures, Enric; DÃ­az, JosÃ© Luis; Ponz, Alejandro; Servera, Emilio\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThere is general agreement that noninvasive ventilation (NIV) prolongs survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and that the main cause of NIV failure is the severity of bulbar dysfunction. However, there is no evidence that bulbar impairment is a contraindication for NIV. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of bulbar impairment on survival in ALS patients with NIV. ALS patients for whom NIV was indicated were included. Those patients who refused NIV were taken as the control group. 120 patients who underwent NIV and 20 who refused NIV were included. The NIV group presented longer survival (median 18.50â months, 95% CI 12.62-24.38â months) than the no-NIV group (3.00â months, 95% CI 0.82-5.18â months) (pNIV, adjusted for NIV failure, were severity of bulbar dysfunction (hazard ratio (HR) 0.5, 95% CI 0.92-0.97; p=0.001) and time spent with oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry NIV (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24; p=0.02). Severe bulbar impairment in ALS does not always prevent NIV from being used, but the severity of bulbar dysfunction at NIV initiation and %sleep S pO 2 NIV appear to be the main prognostic factors of NIV failure in ALS.\n\nKinematics of Disease Progression in Bulbar ALS\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYunusova, Yana; Green, Jordan R.; Lindstrom, Mary J.; Ball, Laura J.; Pattee, Gary L.; Zinman, Lorne\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe goal of this study was to investigate the deterioration of lip and jaw movements during speech longitudinally in three individuals diagnosed with bulbar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Three percent of IDHs occur in the cervical, 5% in the thoracic, and over 92% in the lumbar spinal canal. There have been a total of 31 cervical IDHs reported in the literature. The pathogenesis and imaging characteristics of IDH are not fully understood. A preoperative diagnosis is key to facilitating prompt intradural exploration in patients with ambivalent findings, as well as in preventing reoperation. The purpose of reporting our case is to remind clinicians to consider the possibility of cervical IDH during spinal manipulation therapy in patient with chronic neck pain.The patient signed informed consent for publication of this case report and any accompanying image. The ethical approval of this study was waived by the ethics committee of Chonbuk National University Hospital, because this study was case report and the number of patients was manipulation for chronic neck pain over the course of a month. The day prior, he had noticed neck pain and tingling in the bilateral upper and lower extremities during the manipulation procedure. The following day, he presented with bilateral weakness of all 4 extremities, which rendered him unable to walk. Neurological examination demonstrated a positive Hoffmann sign and ankle clonus bilaterally, hypoesthesia below the C5 dermatome, 3/5 strength in the bilateral upper extremities, and 2/5 strength in the lower extremities. This motor weakness was progressive, and he further complained of voiding difficulty.Urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed large, central disc herniations at C4-C5 and C5-C6 that caused severe spinal cord compression and surrounding edema. We performed C4-C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.The patient's limb weakness improved rapidly within 1 day postoperatively, and he was discharged 4 weeks later. At his 12-month follow-up, the patient had\n\nUrethroplasty, by perineal approach, for bulbar and membranous urethral strictures in children and adolescents.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShenfeld, Ofer Z; Gdor, Joshua; Katz, Ran; Gofrit, Ofer N; Pode, Dov; Landau, Ezekiel H\n\n2008-03-01\n\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of urethroplasty for bulbar and membranous urethral strictures using the perineal approach in children and adolescents. Urethroplasty by the perineal approach is considered the best treatment for bulbar and membranous urethral strictures in adults. It is not as clear whether this also holds true in children, because the published data addressing this question are scant. We retrospectively reviewed our urethroplasty database to identify patients who had undergone urethroplasty using the perineal approach surgery at age 1 to 13 years (children) and 14 to 18 years (adolescents). A total of 14 patients who had undergone urethroplasty by the perineal approach were identified, including 5 children (mean age 10.8 years) and 9 adolescents (mean age 16.7 years). Of the 14 patients, 7 had membranous and 7 bulbar urethral strictures. The membranous strictures were all secondary to pelvic fractures. The bulbar strictures were \"idiopathic\" in 57%, traumatic in 29%, and secondary to hypospadias in 14%. All bulbar strictures had been previously treated for 2.5 years, on average, by repeated dilation or urethrotomy that failed. Anastomotic urethroplasty was used in 79% of the patients and tissue transfer techniques in the remainder. The mean follow-up was 30 months (range 12 to 54). Surgery was primarily successful in 93% of the patients, and subsequently successful in 100%. The mean maximal urinary flow increased from 2.65 mL/s preoperatively to 27.65 mL/s postoperatively. No significant complications occurred, and success was similar in both groups. In pediatric patients, as in adults, bulbar and membranous strictures can be treated successfully with urethroplasty using the perineal approach. These patients should probably not be treated \"conservatively\" with urethral dilation or endoscopic incision. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm that these good results are maintained as these patients cross into adulthood, especially for those who\n\nA unique case of isolated sebaceous adenoma of the bulbar conjunctiva\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHatice Deniz Ilhan\n\nFull Text Available ABSTRACT Our patient was a 34 year-old male who presented with a painless conjunctival mass that had developed 3 months before his first visit. On performing slit-lamp biomicroscopy, a lobulated pink-yellowish solid mobile mass was observed on the nasal bulbar conjunctival surface of his left eye. The tumor was excised, and histopathologic examination of the tumor revealed a sebaceous adenoma. Systemic examination was normal. No recurrence was observed during the 24-month follow-up period. Sebaceous adenoma of the bulbar conjunctiva is an extremely rare benign tumor, which may be observed to be isolated in the absence of malignancy.\n\nA protocol for comprehensive assessment of bulbar dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYunusova, Yana; Green, Jordan R; Wang, Jun; Pattee, Gary; Zinman, Lorne\n\n2011-02-21\n\nImproved methods for assessing bulbar impairment are necessary for expediting diagnosis of bulbar dysfunction in ALS, for predicting disease progression across speech subsystems, and for addressing the critical need for sensitive outcome measures for ongoing experimental treatment trials. To address this need, we are obtaining longitudinal profiles of bulbar impairment in 100 individuals based on a comprehensive instrumentation-based assessment that yield objective measures. Using instrumental approaches to quantify speech-related behaviors is very important in a field that has primarily relied on subjective, auditory-perceptual forms of speech assessment(1). Our assessment protocol measures performance across all of the speech subsystems, which include respiratory, phonatory (laryngeal), resonatory (velopharyngeal), and articulatory. The articulatory subsystem is divided into the facial components (jaw and lip), and the tongue. Prior research has suggested that each speech subsystem responds differently to neurological diseases such as ALS. The current protocol is designed to test the performance of each speech subsystem as independently from other subsystems as possible. The speech subsystems are evaluated in the context of more global changes to speech performance. These speech system level variables include speaking rate and intelligibility of speech. The protocol requires specialized instrumentation, and commercial and custom software. The respiratory, phonatory, and resonatory subsystems are evaluated using pressure-flow (aerodynamic) and acoustic methods. The articulatory subsystem is assessed using 3D motion tracking techniques. The objective measures that are used to quantify bulbar impairment have been well established in the speech literature and show sensitivity to changes in bulbar function with disease progression. The result of the assessment is a comprehensive, across-subsystem performance profile for each participant. The profile, when compared to\n\nSurvival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with home mechanical ventilation: the impact of systematic respiratory assessment and bulbar involvement.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFarrero, Eva; Prats, Enric; Povedano, MÃ³nica; Martinez-Matos, J Antonio; Manresa, Frederic; Escarrabill, Joan\n\n2005-06-01\n\nTo analyze (1) the impact of a protocol of early respiratory evaluation of the indications for home mechanical ventilation (HMV) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and (2) the effects of the protocol and of bulbar involvement on the survival of patients receiving noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Retrospective study in a tertiary care referral center. HMV was indicated in 86 patients with ALS, with 22 patients (25%) presenting with intolerance to treatment associated with bulbar involvement. Treatment with HMV had been initiated in 15 of 64 patients prior to initiating the protocol (group A) and in the remaining 49 patients after protocol initiation (group B). In group A, the majority of patients began treatment with HMV during an acute episode requiring ICU admission (p = 0.001) and tracheal ventilation (p = 0.025), with a lower percentage of patients beginning HMV treatment without respiratory insufficiency (p = 0.013). No significant differences in survival rates were found between groups A and B among patients treated with NIV. Greater survival was observed in group B (p = 0.03) when patients with bulbar involvement were excluded (96%). Patients without bulbar involvement at the start of therapy with NIV presented a significantly better survival rate (p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed bulbar involvement to be an independent prognostic factor for survival (relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 2.54; p = 0.04). No significant differences in survival were observed between patients with bulbar involvement following treatment with NIV and those with intolerance, except for the subgroup of patients who began NIV treatment with hypercapnia (p = 0.0002). Early systematic respiratory evaluation in patients with ALS is necessary to improve the results of HMV. Further studies are required to confirm the benefits of NIV treatment in patients with bulbar involvement, especially in the early stages.\n\nAnatomy of cerebellar nucleo-bulbar projections in the rat\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nT.M.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 53 male patients who presented, between January 2001 and December 2005, with blunt traumatic injury to the bulbar urethra. The definitive diagnosis of urethral rupture was made by retrograde urethrography, where urethral rupture was classified into partial or complete. The minimum follow-up period was 3 years. The initial management was either suprapubic cystostomy or endoscopic urethral realignment over a urethral catheter using a cystoscope to pass a guide-wire over which the catheter was inserted. Stricture formation was managed by visual internal urethrotomy (VIU for passable strictures and urethroplasty (stricture excision and re-anastomosis for impassable strictures or recurrence after VIU. The follow-up period was three years. The results were analyzed by SPSS software (chi-square and Student's-t-test. Results: Stricture formation occurred in 19 of 22 patients (86% with complete urethral rupture and in 10 of 31 (32% with partial rupture (p < 0.001. Strictures occurred in 11 of 31 (35% patients treated initially with suprapubic cystostomy and in 18 of 22 (82% treated with primary urethral realignment (p < 0.001. The success rate after VIU was 15% (4 of 26 patients and after urethroplasty it was 96% (24 of 25 patients (p < 0.001. Conclusions: Suprapubic cystostomy is better than urethral realignment and catheterization as primary management after straddle injury to the bulbar urethra. Stricture excision and re-anastomosis is better than VIU as delayed management for strictures that develop after straddle injury to the bulbar urethra.\n\nSurgical Repair of Bulbar Urethral Strictures: Advantages of Ventral, Dorsal, and Lateral Approaches and When to Choose Them\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKrishnan Venkatesan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Objectives. To review the available literature describing the three most common approaches for buccal mucosal graft (BMG augmentation during reconstruction of bulbar urethral strictures. Due to its excellent histological properties, buccal mucosa graft is now routinely used in urethral reconstruction. The best approach for the placement of such a graft remains controversial. Methods. PubMed search was conducted for available English literature describing outcomes of bulbar urethroplasty augmentation techniques using dorsal, ventral, and lateral approaches. Prospective and retrospective studies as well as meta-analyses and latest systematic reviews were included. Results.

They were investigated by [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (FDG PET), comparing the patient groups with each other and with the controls by statistical parametric mapping. Highly significant relative increases in glucose metabolism distribution were found in the group comprising all 32 ALS patients as compared with the controls in the bilateral amygdalae, midbrain, pons and cerebellum. Relative hypermetabolism was also found in patients with spinal onset as compared with the controls in the right midbrain. In patients with bulbar onset compared with the controls and with patients with spinal onset, large relatively hypometabolic areas were found in the bilateral frontal cortex, right insula, anterior cingulate, precuneus and inferior parietal lobe. Patients with spinal onset had significantly higher scores in a neuropsychological test assessing verbal fluency compared with patients with bulbar onset. This large FDG PET investigation provided unprecedented evidence of relatively increased metabolism in the amygdalae, midbrain and pons in ALS patients as compared with control subjects, possibly due to local activation of astrocytes and microglia. Highly significant relative decreases in metabolism were found in large frontal and parietal regions in the bulbar onset patients as compared with the spinal onset patients and the controls, suggesting a differential metabolic and neuropsychological state between the two conditions.

Twenty-four patients with acquired urinary incontinence (8 after radical prostatectomy, 7 after transurethral resection of the prostate, and 9 after posterior urethroplasty) were included in our study. Eighteen of these patients (75.0%) had mild to moderate urinary incontinence, and 6 (25.0%) had severe urinary incontinence. All patients received adynamic gracilis urethral myoplasty with a pedicled gracilis muscle flap wrapped around bulbar urethra and had a close follow-up. The mean postoperative maximum urethral pressure after the gracilis muscle wrapped around bulbar urethra was significantly higher than that of the preoperative measurements (Pâurethra can raise the urethral pressure. Adynamic graciloplasty with a pedicled gracilis muscle flap wrapped around bulbar urethra is a safe and effective surgical option in the treatment of male patients with mild to moderate incontinence, but is not suitable for severe incontinence.

Functional slitlamp biomicroscope was used to image hundreds of venules per subject. The bulbar conjunctiva in five healthy human subjects was imaged on six different locations in the temporal bulbar conjunctiva. The histograms of the diameter and velocity were plotted to examine whether the distribution was normal. Standard errors were calculated from the standard deviation and vessel sample size. The ratio of the standard error of the mean over the population mean was used to determine the sample size cutoff. The velocity was plotted as a function of the vessel diameter to display the distribution of the diameter and velocity. The results showed that the sampling size was approximately 15 vessels, which generated a standard error equivalent to 15% of the population mean from the total vessel population. The distributions of the diameter and velocity were not only unimodal, but also somewhat positively skewed and not normal. The blood flow velocity was related to the vessel diameter (r=0.23, Psampling size of the vessels and the distribution histogram of the blood flow velocity and vessel diameter, which may lead to a better understanding of the human microvascular system of the bulbar conjunctiva.\n\nPeripheral Androgen Receptor Gene Suppression Rescues Disease in Mouse Models of Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndrewÂ P. Lieberman\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA is caused by the polyglutamine androgen receptor (polyQ-AR, a protein expressed by both lower motor neurons and skeletal muscle. Although viewed as a motor neuronopathy, data from patients and mouse models suggest that muscle contributes to disease pathogenesis. Here, we tested this hypothesis using AR113Q knockin and human bacterial artificial chromosome/clone (BAC transgenic mice that express the full-length polyQ-AR and display androgen-dependent weakness, muscle atrophy, and early death. We developed antisense oligonucleotides that suppressed AR gene expression in the periphery but not the CNS after subcutaneous administration. Suppression of polyQ-AR in the periphery rescued deficits in muscle weight, fiber size, and grip strength, reversed changes in muscle gene expression, and extended the lifespan of mutant males. We conclude that polyQ-AR expression in the periphery is an important contributor to pathology in SBMA mice and that peripheral administration of therapeutics should be explored for SBMA patients.\n\nAnastomotic fibrous ring as cause of stricture recurrence after bulbar onlay graft urethroplasty.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBarbagli, Guido; Guazzoni, Giorgio; Palminteri, Enzo; Lazzeri, Massimo\n\n2006-08-01\n\nWe retrospectively reviewed patterns of failure after bulbar substitution urethroplasty. In particular we investigated the prevalence and location of anastomotic fibrous ring strictures occurring at the apical anastomoses between the graft and urethral plate after 3 types of onlay graft techniques. We reviewed the records of 107 patients who underwent bulbar urethroplasty between 1994 and 2004. Mean patient age was 44 years. Patients with lichen sclerosus, failed hypospadias repair or urethroplasty and panurethral strictures were excluded. A total of 45 patients underwent dorsal onlay skin graft urethroplasty, 50 underwent buccal mucosa onlay graft urethroplasty and 12 underwent augmented end-to-end urethroplasty. The clinical outcome was considered a success or failure at the time that any postoperative procedure was needed, including dilation. Mean followup was 74 months (range 12 to 130). Of 107 cases 85 (80%) were successful and 22 (20%) failed. Failure in 12 patients (11%) involved the whole grafted area and in 10 (9%) it involved the anastomotic site, which was distal and proximal in 5 each. Urethrography, urethral ultrasound and urethroscopy were fundamental for determining the difference between full-length and focal extension of re-stricture. Failures were treated with multistage urethroplasty in 12 cases, urethrotomy in 7 and 1-stage urethroplasty in 3. Of the patients 16 had a satisfactory final outcome and 6 underwent definitive perineal urinary diversion. The prevalence and location of anastomotic ring strictures after bulbar urethroplasty were uniformly distributed in after 3 surgical techniques using skin or buccal mucosa. Further studies are necessary to clarify the etiology of these fibrous ring strictures.\n\nPrimary non-transecting bulbar urethroplasty long-term success rates are similar to transecting urethroplasty.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAnderson, Kirk M; Blakely, Stephen A; O'Donnell, Colin I; Nikolavsky, Dmitriy; Flynn, Brian J\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo review the long-term outcomes of transecting versus non-transecting urethroplasty to repair bulbar urethral strictures. A retrospective review was conducted of 342 patients who underwent anterior urethroplasty performed by a single surgeon from 2003 to 2014. Patients were excluded from further analysis if there had been prior urethroplasty, stricture location outside the bulbous urethra, or age urethroplasty. In the non-transecting group, surgical techniques used included non-transecting anastomotic urethroplasty and dorsal and/or ventral buccal grafting. The primary endpoint was stricture resolution in transecting vs. non-transecting bulbar urethroplasty. Success was defined as freedom from secondary procedures including dilation, urethrotomy, or repeat urethroplasty. One hundred and fifty-two patients met inclusion criteria. At a mean follow-up of 65Â months (range: 10-138Â months), stricture-free recurrence in the transecting and non-transecting groups was similar, 83% (nÂ =Â 85/102) and 82% (nÂ =Â 41/50), respectively (pÂ =Â 0.84). Surgical technique (pÂ =Â 0.91), stricture length (pÂ =Â 0.8), and etiology (pÂ =Â 0.6) did not affect stricture recurrence rate on multivariate analysis. There was no difference detected in time to stricture recurrence (pÂ =Â 0.21). In this retrospective series, transecting and non-transecting primary bulbar urethroplasty resulted in similar long-term stricture resolution rate. Prospective studies are needed to determine what differences may present in outcomes related to sexual function and long-term success.\n\nEffects of Choto-san (Diao-Teng-San) on microcirculation of bulbar conjunctiva and hemorheological factors in patients with asymptomatic cerebral infarction\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nYANG, Qiao; Kita, Toshiaki; Hikiami, Hiroaki; Shimada, Yutaka; Itoh, Takashi; Terasawa, Katsutoshi\n\n1999-01-01\n\nIn this study, the effects of Choto-san ( é£è¤æ£ ) on the microcirculation of bulbar conjunctiva in 16 patients with asymptornatic cerebral infarction were investigated with a video-microscopic system.

However, it has been shown that sniffing in the behaving rodent is highly dynamic and varies both in frequency and flow rate. Bulbar odor response could vary with these sniffing parameter variations. Consequently, it is necessary to understand how nasal airflow can modify and shape odor response at the olfactory bulb level.To assess this question, we used a double cannulation and simulated nasal airflow protocol on anesthetized rats to uncouple nasal airflow from animal respiration. Both mitral/tufted cell extracellular unit activity and local field potentials (LFPs were recorded. We found that airflow changes in the normal range were sufficient to substantially reorganize the response of the olfactory bulb. In particular, cellular odor-evoked activities, LFP oscillations and spike phase-locking to LFPs were strongly modified by nasal flow rate.Our results indicate the importance of reconsidering the notion of odor coding as odor response at the bulbar level is ceaselessly modified by respiratory dynamics.\n\nA histopathological study of bulbar conjunctival flaps occurring in 2 contact lens wearers.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMarkoulli, Maria; Francis, Ian C; Yong, Jim; Jalbert, Isabelle; Carnt, Nicole; Cole, Nerida; Papas, Eric\n\n2011-09-01\n\nTo study the histopathology of paralimbal bulbar conjunctival flaps occurring secondary to soft contact lens wear. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy using sodium fluorescein, cobalt blue light, and a Wratten filter was used to observe the presence, location, and dimensions of bulbar conjunctival flaps presenting in a cohort of contact lens wearers. Two subjects who exhibited such flaps agreed to undergo conjunctival biopsy. Tissue samples, obtained from the region of the flap, and an adjacent unaffected area were processed by standard histopathological methods. In the first subject, analysis of the flap tissue showed even collagen distribution and overall normal histology. The flap of the second subject displayed a mild focal increase in collagen and mild degeneration of collagen, but no increase in elastic tissue. Conjunctival epithelium was normal in both cases. In these 2 subjects, conjunctival flap tissue either was normal or showed only minimal abnormality. There is insufficient evidence for significant pathological change on the time scale of this study.\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Regional Variants (Brachial Amyotrophic Diplegia, Leg Amyotrophic Diplegia, and Isolated Bulbar Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJawdat, Omar; Statland, Jeffrey M; Barohn, Richard J; Katz, Jonathan S; Dimachkie, Mazen M\n\n2015-11-01\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rapidly progressive, invariably fatal disease, involves mixed upper and lower motor neurons in different spinal cord regions. Patients with bulbar onset progress more rapidly than patients with limb onset or with a lower motor neuron presentation. Recent descriptions of regional variants suggest some patients have ALS isolated to a single spinal region for many years, including brachial amyotrophic diplegia, leg amyotrophic diplegia, and isolated bulbar palsy. Clearer definitions of regional variants will have implications for prognosis, understanding the pathophysiology of ALS, identifying genetic factors related to slower disease progression, and future planning of clinical trials.

To illustrate the history and the evolution over time of bulbar dorsal onlay urethroplasty, comparing outcomes when using buccal mucosa or skin grafts. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Ninety-four patients underwent bulbar urethral reconstruction using two dorsal onlay techniques, namely augmented anastomotic urethroplasty and dorsal onlay graft urethroplasty. Preoperative evaluation included clinical history, physical examination, urine culture, residual urine measurement, uroflowmetry and urethrography. Thirty-four patients underwent augmented anastomotic urethroplasty using penile skin (10 cases) or buccal mucosa (24 cases) grafts. Sixty patients underwent dorsal onlay graft urethroplasty using penile skin (38 cases) or buccal mucosa (22 cases) grafts. Forty-eight out of 94 patients received skin grafts and 46 buccal mucosal grafts. RESULTS. Sixty-four (68%) out of 94 cases were successful, whereas 30 (32%) failed. The 34 augmented anastomotic urethroplasties provided successful outcomes in 24 cases (70.6%), but poor outcomes in 10 (29.4%) cases. The 60 dorsal onlay graft urethroplasty proved to be successful in 42 cases (70%), failing in 18 (30%) cases. Twenty-eight (58.3%) out of 48 penile skin grafts were successful and 20 (41.7%) failed. Thirty-six (78.3%) out of 46 buccal mucosa grafts were successful and 10 (21.7%) failed. The 30 failed cases were then treated with internal urethrotomy in 14 cases (46.7%), perineal urethrostomy in 8 cases (26.7%), two-stage repair in 4 cases (13.3%), and one-stage repair in 4 cases (13.3%). CONCLUSIONS. The dorsal onlay technique used for bulbar urethral stricture repair has changed over time. In our experience, the buccal mucosa seems to be the best substitute graft material for bulbar urethroplasty using dorsal approach.\n\nOutcomes of Direct Vision Internal Urethrotomy for Bulbar Urethral Strictures: Technique Modification with High Dose Triamcinolone Injection\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRishi Modh\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Objective. To evaluate the recurrence rate of bulbar urethral strictures managed with cold knife direct vision internal urethrotomy and high dose corticosteroid injection. Methods. 28 patients with bulbar urethral strictures underwent direct vision internal urethrotomy with high dose triamcinolone injection into the periurethral tissue and were followed up for recurrence. Results. Our cohort had a mean age of 60 years and average stricture length of 1.85âcm, and 71% underwent multiple previous urethral stricture procedures with an average of 5.7 procedures each. Our technique modification of high dose corticosteroid injection had a recurrence rate of 29% at a mean follow-up of 20 months with a low rate of urinary tract infections. In patients who failed treatment, mean time to stricture recurrence was 7 months.

To evaluate the recurrence rate of bulbar urethral strictures managed with cold knife direct vision internal urethrotomy and high dose corticosteroid injection. Methods. 28 patients with bulbar urethral strictures underwent direct vision internal urethrotomy with high dose triamcinolone injection into the periurethral tissue and were followed up for recurrence. Results. Our cohort had a mean age of 60 years and average stricture length of 1.85âcm, and 71% underwent multiple previous urethral stricture procedures with an average of 5.7 procedures each. Our technique modification of high dose corticosteroid injection had a recurrence rate of 29% at a mean follow-up of 20 months with a low rate of urinary tract infections. In patients who failed treatment, mean time to stricture recurrence was 7 months. Patients who were successfully treated had significantly better International Prostate Symptom Scores at 6, 9, and 12 months. There was no significant difference in maximum flow velocity on Uroflowmetry at last follow-up but there was significant difference in length of follow-up (p = 0.02). Conclusions. High dose corticosteroid injection at the time of direct vision internal urethrotomy is a safe and effective procedure to delay anatomical and symptomatic recurrence of bulbar urethral strictures, particularly in those who are poor candidates for urethroplasty.\n\nThe Efficacy of Bulbar Urethral Mobilization for Anastomotic Anterior Urethroplasty in a Case With Recurrent Anterior Urethral Stricture.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFukui, Shinji; Aoki, Katsuya; Kaneko, Yoshiteru; Samma, Shoji; Fujimoto, Kiyohide\n\n2014-05-01\n\nA 2-month-old boy was diagnosed with febrile urinary tract infection.

The records of 15 boys, age 18 years and below, admitted to our tertiary trauma center with urethral injuries from 1989 to 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Out of these 15 boys, 7 were excluded (2 for iatrogenic trauma, 2 for minor straddle injuries who were not operated on, 2 for incomplete records, and 1 lost to follow-up) and 8 analyzed patients were operated for bulbar or posterior urethral injury. The mean follow-up after the operation was 4.5 years (range 0.5-10). To obtain up-to-date follow-up information, all the analyzed patients were contacted by a letter and telephone in January 2015 and asked about lower urinary tract or erectile dysfunction (ED) using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 questionnaire. Mean age at the time of injury was 12.3 years (range 5-17). Four patients with pelvic fracture had complete posterior urethra disruption, three patients after straddle injury developed obliterating stricture of the bulbar urethra and one patient had torn his bulbar urethra apart by a sharp hook. Except for the immediate exploration of the open perineal wound, all patients were operated via perineal approach 1 to 6 months after initial suprapubic catheter insertion. Five patients needed a cystotomy to identify the proximal urethral stump by a probe, and two patients had partial pubectomy to gain urethral length. Postoperative complications included stricture in anastomosis in six patients (all reoperated, four more than once including attempts of endoscopic internal urethrotomy). Six days after surgery, one patient developed massive external bleeding around a permanent urinary catheter due to a posttraumatic ruptured arterial aneurysm that was later stopped by urgent angiography and coil insertion. After discharge, three patients had transient\n\nThe Efficacy of Bulbar Urethral Mobilization for Anastomotic Anterior Urethroplasty in a Case With Recurrent Anterior Urethral Stricture\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nShinji Fukui\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFull Text Available A 2-month-old boy was diagnosed with febrile urinary tract infection.

Between 1999 and 2008, 216 patients with bulbar strictures underwent BM graft urethroplasty using the ventral-sagittal urethrotomy approach. Of these patients, 32 (14.8%; mean stricture 3.2Â cm, range 1.5-5) had a dorsal graft urethroplasty (DGU), 121 (56%; mean stricture 3.7, range 1.5-8) a ventral graft urethroplasty (VGU), and 63 (29.2%; mean stricture 3.4, range 1.5-10) a dorsal plus ventral graft urethroplasty (DVGU). The strictured urethra was opened by a ventral-sagittal urethrotomy and BM graft was inserted dorsally or ventrally or dorsal plus ventral to augment the urethral plate. The median follow-up was 37Â months. The overall 5-year actuarial success rate was 91.4%. The 5-year actuarial success rates were 87.8%, 95.5% and 86.3% for the DGU, VGU and DVGU, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences among the three groups. Success rates decreased significantly only with a stricture length of >4Â cm. In BM graft bulbar urethroplasties the ventral urethrotomy access is simple and versatile, allowing an intraoperative choice of dorsal, ventral or combined dorsal and ventral grafting, with comparable success rates.\n\nComparison of cold-knife optical internal urethrotomy and holmium:YAG laser internal urethrotomy in bulbar urethral strictures\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYenice, Mustafa Gurkan; Sam, Emre; Colakoglu, Yunus; Atar, Feyzi Arda; Sahin, Selcuk; Simsek, Abdulmuttalip; Tugcu, Volkan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIntroduction To compare the results of cold-knife optical internal urethrotomy (OIU) and Holmium:YAG laser internal urethrotomy (HIU) in primary bulbar urethral strictures. Material and methods A total of 63 patients diagnosed with primary bulbar urethral stricture between August 2014 and September 2015 were assigned to the OIU (n = 29) and HIU (n = 34) groups. The demographic variables, biochemistry panels, and preoperative and postoperative uroflowmetry results including the maximum flow rate (Qmax) and mean flow rate (Qmean) values, retrograde urethrography, and diagnostic flexible urethroscopy findings were recorded prospectively. Demographic features and preoperative values were not statistically different between groups (p >0.05). Mean surgical times were 18.4 Â±2.3 min for OIU and 21.9 Â±3.8 min for HIU groups, which was statistically significant (p 0.05). There was no recurrence in the first 3 months in either group. The urethral stricture recurrence rate up to month 12 was not statistically significant for the OIU group (n = 6, 20.7%) as compared to the HIU group (n = 11, 32.4%; p = 0.299).

Mer\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction: Myesthenia Gravis (MG is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by weakness and fatigability of skeletal muscles. The underlying defect is a decrease in number of available acetylcholine receptors (AChRs at neuromuscular junction due to an antibody-mediated autoimmune attack. Case Report: A 26 year old male patient from Dhar (M.P., a tribal district, presented to civil hospital Ahmedabad (CHA with complaints of unable to drink water since 5 months. Patient complained of water coming out from nose. Gradually he developed inability to eat also, with no evidence of vomiting.2 months later patient developed slurring of speech which was followed by total inability to speak. Along with that he developed diplopia on binocular vision. No such symptoms in siblings were there. On examination general examination was normal. On CNS examination he was conscious oriented with normal planter and deep tendon reflexes. On cranial nerve examination 3, 7, 9, 10th nerve palsies seen in the form of absence of medial & upward movement of left eye (3rd, inability to close eyes completely (3rd, reduced power and tone of buccinators muscle (7th, gag reflex absent (9th, presence of dysphagia (10th. Rest of the CNS findings were normal. He was given ryleâs tube feeding and investigated.CBC, LFT, RFT, urine routine-micro were normal.CSF examination showed mild increase of protein.MRI brain was normal. Vitamin B12, TSH, Calcium, HbA1c, ESR, RA factor were normal.ANA was (+ with nuclear speckled pattern. Fundus examination was normal with abnormal ocular movement as described.VEP study was normal.EMG NCV showed reduced amplitude of bilateral facial nerve, involvement of right oculomotor nerve suggesting bulbar myasthenia >generalized myasthenia. Then we did AChR antibody test which came highly positive. He was started T.Pyridostigmine 60mg TDS and T. Prednisolone 5mg/kg and discharged. On follow up we found marked improvement of symptoms.

Such cases frequently involve significant morbidity and mortality. From October 2000-June 2008, we collected 10 consecutive patients diagnosed with enterovirus 71 rhombencephalomyelitis complicated by left heart failure, with or without pulmonary edema, and surviving more than 3 months after receiving extracorporeal life support. Follow-up neurologic outcomes were analyzed prospectively. The median duration of neurologic follow-up was 7 years and 2 months. Significant morbidities included bulbar dysfunction, respiratory failure, and flaccid quadriparesis. Eight patients exhibited bulbar dysfunction, and feeding tubes could be removed from four patients (median, 15.5 months). Respiratory failure was observed in seven patients. Three patients were gradually withdrawn from their tracheostomy tube (median period, 30 months). Intelligence tests revealed four patients with normal cognitive function, one with borderline cognitive function, and one with mild mental retardation. Four were bedridden survivors. Extracorporeal life support for critical enterovirus 71 rhombencephalomyelitis demonstrated decreased neurologic sequelae during long-term follow-up, allowing for decannulation of feeding and tracheostomy tubes, and resulting in improved cognitive function.

The histopathological finding in SBMA is loss of lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord as well as in the brainstem motor nuclei. Animal studies have revealed that the pathogenesis of SBMA depends on the level of serum testosterone, and that androgen deprivation mitigates neurodegeneration through inhibition of nuclear accumulation of the pathogenic AR. Heat shock proteins, ubiquitin-proteasome system and transcriptional regulation are also potential targets of therapy development for SBMA.\n\nMulti-institutional Outcomes of Endoscopic Management of Stricture Recurrence after Bulbar Urethroplasty.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSukumar, Shyam; Elliott, Sean P; Myers, Jeremy B; Voelzke, Bryan B; Smith, Thomas G; Carolan, Alexandra Mc; Maidaa, Michael; Vanni, Alex J; Breyer, Benjamin N; Erickson, Bradley A\n\n2018-05-03\n\nApproximately 10-20% of patients will have a recurrence after urethroplasty. Initial management of these recurrences is often with urethral dilation (UD) or direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU). In the current study, we describe outcomes of endoscopic management of stricture recurrence after bulbar urethroplasty. We retrospectively reviewed bulbar urethroplasty data from 5 surgeons from the Trauma and Urologic Reconstruction Network of Surgeons. Men who underwent UD or DVIU for urethroplasty recurrence were identified. Recurrence was defined as inability to pass a 17Fr cystoscope through the area of reconstruction. The primary outcome was the success rate of recurrence management. Comparisons were made between UD and DVIU and then between endoscopic management of recurrences after excision and primary anastomosis urethroplasty (EPA) versus substitutional repairs using time-to-event statistics. There were 53 men with recurrence that were initially managed endoscopically. Median time to urethral stricture recurrence after urethroplasty was noted to be 5 months. At a median follow-up of 5 months, overall success was 42%. Success after UD (n=1/10, 10%) was significantly lower than after DVIU (n=21/43, 49%; p urethroplasty. DVIU is more successful for patients with a recurrence after a substitution urethroplasty compared to after EPA, perhaps indicating a different mechanism of recurrence for EPA (ischemic) versus substitution urethroplasty (non-ischemic).

We conducted a prospective study comprised of 112 male patients seen from June 2013 to December 2014. Inclusion criterion was short-segment bulbar urethral stricture (â¤1.5cm). Exclusion criteria were prior intervention/urethroplasty, pan-anterior urethral strictures, posterior stenosis, urinary tract infection, and those who lost to followup. Patients were divided into two groups; Group A (n=58) included cold knife DVIU and group B (n=54) included holmium laser endourethrotomy patients. Patient followup included uroflowmetry at postoperative Day 3, as well as at three months and six months. Baseline demographics were comparable in both groups. A total of 107 patients met the inclusion criteria and five patients were excluded due to inadequate followup. Mean stricture length was 1.31 Â± 0.252 cm (p=0.53) and 1.34 Â± 0.251 cm in Groups A and B, respectively. Mean operating time in Group A was 16.3 Â± 1.78 min and in Group B was 20.96 Â± 2.23 min (p=0.0001). Five patients in Group A had bleeding after the procedure that was managed conservatively by applying perineal compression. Three patients in Group B had fluid extravasation postoperatively. Qmax (ml/s) was found to be statistically insignificant between the two groups at all followups. Both holmium laser and cold knife urethrotomy are safe and equally effective in treating short-segment bulbar urethral strictures in terms of outcome and complication rate. However, holmium laser requires more expertise and is a costly alternative.\n\nMyasthenia Gravis With Thymoma, Manifesting as AChR-Ab-Positive, Distinct Bulbar Palsy Accompanied by Dysgeusia: A Case Series and Review of Literature\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKai Zhu\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFull Text Available In this review, we summarized three cases of myasthenia gravis (MG with taste disorder and describe their clinical features in detail. Three MG patients presented with significant bulbar palsy symptoms, high AChR-Ab titers, and negative MuSK-Ab, were diagnosed with thymoma. Furthermore, we observed that dysgeusia could manifest earlier than the occurrence of typical MG symptoms, even predict a MG relapse or a myasthenic crisis in the course of MG. We believe that dysgeusia is a non-motor symptom of MG, which especially exists in MG patients with thymoma and serious bulbar palsy. Therefore, being alert to this symptom may facilitate the early diagnosis of MG and judge the progress of the disease.\n\nSilencing neuronal mutant androgen receptor in a mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSahashi, Kentaro; Katsuno, Masahisa; Hung, Gene; Adachi, Hiroaki; Kondo, Naohide; Nakatsuji, Hideaki; Tohnai, Genki; Iida, Madoka; Bennett, C Frank; Sobue, Gen\n\n2015-11-01\n\nSpinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease that affects males, results from a CAG triplet repeat/polyglutamine expansions in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. Patients develop progressive muscular weakness and atrophy, and no effective therapy is currently available. The tissue-specific pathogenesis, especially relative pathological contributions between degenerative motor neurons and muscles, remains inconclusive. Though peripheral pathology in skeletal muscle caused by toxic AR protein has been recently reported to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SBMA using mouse models, the role of motor neuron degeneration in SBMA has not been rigorously investigated. Here, we exploited synthetic antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit the RNA levels of mutant AR in the central nervous system (CNS) and explore its therapeutic effects in our SBMA mouse model that harbors a mutant AR gene with 97 CAG expansions and characteristic SBMA-like neurogenic phenotypes. A single intracerebroventricular administration of the antisense oligonucleotides in the presymptomatic phase efficiently suppressed the mutant gene expression in the CNS, and delayed the onset and progression of motor dysfunction, improved body weight gain and survival with the amelioration of neuronal histopathology in motor units such as spinal motor neurons, neuromuscular junctions and skeletal muscle. These findings highlight the importance of the neurotoxicity of mutant AR protein in motor neurons as a therapeutic target. Â© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

A total of 30 patients underwent sling surgery with rectus fascia in a four-year period at the Shohadaye Ashayer Teaching Hospital in Iran. Urinary incontinence occurred in 8 patients after open prostatectomy, in 12 patients after prostatectomy through urethra, in 8 patients after radical prostatectomy. For the purpose of the study, 2 patients in whom incontinence occurred after pelvic fracture were excluded. The 28 patients were followed up for a one-year period after the operation. All patients had incontinence from one to six years. After hospitalisation, an 18 gauge Foley's catheter was introduced in the urethra in every patient. The perineum was incised longitudinally, and the bulbar urethra was freed and a 2x7 cm span of rectus fascia was separated and placed under the bulbar urethra. Treatment was defined as use of one or no pad per day and recovery, as a reduction of at least 50% in the number of the used pads after sling operation. After operation, all patients suffering from moderate to severe stress incontinence were treated with 0-1 pad per day. Four patients were unable to urinate; in 2 patients the sling was modified and loosened, and in two others dilatation resolved their problems. Bulbar urethra sling can be carried out in moderate to severe urinary incontinence treatment in any hospital at a modest cost with satisfactory results.\n\nSynergic prodegradative activity of Bicalutamide and trehalose on the mutant androgen receptor responsible for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nGiorgetti, Elise; Rusmini, Paola; Crippa, Valeria; Cristofani, Riccardo; Boncoraglio, Alessandra; Cicardi, Maria E.; Galbiati, Mariarita; Poletti, Angelo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSpinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked motoneuron disease due to a CAG triplet-repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, which is translated into an elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in AR protein (ARpolyQ).

Each system is devoted to the detection of volatile odorants and pheromones, respectively. However, a growing number of evidences supports a cooperative interaction between them. For instance, at least four non-canonical receptor families (i.e., different from olfactory and vomeronasal receptor families have been recently discovered. These atypical receptor families are expressed in the sensory organs of the nasal cavity and furnish parallel processing-pathways that detect specific stimuli and mediate specific behaviors as well. Aside from the receptor and functional diversity of these sensory modalities, they converge into a poorly understood bulbar area at the intersection of the main- main olfactory bulb (MOB and accessory olfactory bulb (AOB that has been termed olfactory limbus (OL. Given the intimate association the OL with specialized glomeruli (i.e., necklace and modified glomeruli receiving uncanonical sensory afferences and its interactions with the MOB and AOB, the possibility that OL is a site of non-olfactory and atypical vomeronasal sensory decoding is discussed.\n\nAnastomotic Urethroplasty for an Obstructing Calculus Within a Bulbar Urethral Diverticulum and Urethral Stricture\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPooya Banapour\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available A 61-year-old male with prior history of endoscopic urethral calculus removal presented to the emergency room with urinary retention and a palpable perineal mass.

We reviewed our database of consecutive patients presenting to our tertiary care institution with recurrent bulbar and bulbomembranous urethral strictures who underwent DVIU with MMC from 2011 to 2016. Patients were stratified by radiation-induced strictures (RIS) vs non-RIS. Cold-knife incisions were made at 12-, 3-, and 9-o'clock positions followed by intralesional injection of 10âmL MMC (0.4âmg/mL) in 0.2-0.4âmL aliquots and 1 month of postoperative daily clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). All 44 patients (RIS nâ=â18, non-RIS nâ=â26) failed prior endoscopic management or urethroplasty. Median stricture length was 2.0âcm (interquartile range [IQR] 1.0-2.5). Over a median follow-up of 25.8 months (IQR 12.9-47.2), 75.0% of patients (33/44) required no additional surgical intervention (RIS 12/18, 66.7%; non-RIS 21/26, 80.8%). Median time to stricture recurrence among those who recurred was 10.7 months (IQR 3.9-17.6; RIS 9.4 months, IQR 3.5-17.6; non-RIS 11.2 months, IQR 8.0-25.6). Four patients (RIS nâ=â2, non-RIS nâ=â2) elected to undergo urethroplasty for recurrence. A second DVIU with MMC was performed in the remaining recurrences (nâ=â7) with no further surgical intervention required in 37 of 40 of patients (92.5%) overall (RIS 14/16, 87.5%; non-RIS 23/24, 95.8%). No long-term complications were attributable to MMC. DVIU with MMC and short-term CIC for recurrent, short, bulbar and bulbomembranous urethral strictures is a safe endoscopic modality with promising early results. This approach may be useful for patients who are suboptimal candidates for open reconstruction. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Besides different studies reported declines in olfactory performances during a short period of sleep deprivation. Mechanisms underlying these clinical manifestations are poorly understood although the impairment in the dopamine (DA neurotransmission in the olfactory bulb and in the nigrostriatal pathway may have important roles in olfactory as well as in REM sleep disturbances. Therefore, we have led to the hypothesis that a modulation of the dopaminergic D2 receptors in the olfactory bulb could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the olfactory deficits in PD and after a short period of REM sleep deprivation (REMSD. We decided to investigate the olfactory, neurochemical and histological alterations generated by the administration of piribedil (a selective D2 agonist or raclopride (a selective D2 antagonist, within the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, in rats submitted to intranigral rotenone and REMSD. Our findings provided a remarkable evidence of the occurrence of a negative correlation (r = - 0.52, P = 0.04 between the number of periglomerular TH-ir neurons and the bulbar levels of DA in the rotenone, but not sham groups. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.34, P = 0.03 was observed between nigral DA and olfactory discrimination index (DI, for the sham groups, indicating that increased DA levels in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc are associated to enhanced olfactory discrimination performance. Also, increased levels in bulbar and striatal DA induced by piribedil in the rotenone control and rotenone REMSD groups were consistent with reduced amounts of DI. The present evidence reinforce that DA produced by periglomerular neurons, and particularly the bulbar dopaminergic D2 receptors, are essential participants in the olfactory discrimination processes, as well as SNpc\n\nGuillain Barre Syndrome in the elderly: Experience from a tertiary-care hospital in India.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNagappa, M; Rahul, W; Sinha, S; Bindu, P S; Mathuranath, P S; Rao, S; Periyavan, S; Umamaheshwara Rao, G S; Taly, A B\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAge influences incidence and prognosis of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), common cause of ascending areflexic quadriparesis. Dedicated studies on elderly GBS are infrequent. This study aimed to describe clinical features and outcome at hospital-discharge in patients agedâ¥60years with GBS. Medical records of 70 elderly GBS over 15years were analysed. Mean symptom-duration was 5.78Â±4.5days and onset-to-peak 5.14Â±4.4days. Antecedent events preceded GBS by 8.07Â±9.9days and included: fever (n=19), respiratory infection (n=6), and gastroenteritis (n=5). Clinical features were weakness of facial (n=34), bulbar (n=13), extraocular (n=4) and respiratory (n=20) muscles and recurrence (n=4). Nine had Hughes disability score (HDS) of three or less. Sensory symptoms and signs included paresthesias (n=40), pain (n=24), and impaired kinaesthetic sensation (n=14). Laboratory abnormalities included albumino-cytological dissociation (n=50), hyponatremia (n=36) and elevated creatine kinase (n=18). Electrophysiological subtypes were: primary demyelinating (n=52), inexcitable (n=3), equivocal (n=2) and axonal (n=1). Fifty-seven patients treated with plasmapheresis (n=48) or intravenous immunoglobulin (n=9) had mean HDS of 3.53Â±0.7 at discharge. Twenty-one were ambulant (HDSâ¥3), one "
