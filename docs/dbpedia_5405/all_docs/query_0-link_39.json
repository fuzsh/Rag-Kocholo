We’re able to do so because your support is our constant. Whether you’re a monthly donor, a member of the Evelyn Peters Kyle Society or made your first gift this year, Pi Phi’s future is already shining brighter because of you. The power of your support is reflected in the perseverance of the Pi Phis who receive Foundation scholarships, the inspiration of the learners who discover a love of reading, the spirit of the chapter and alumnae club officers who realize their capacity to lead and the gratitude of the sisters who receive emergency assistance grants. We’re honored to share some of their stories within our 2022-2023 Impact Report."
