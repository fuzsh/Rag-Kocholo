In the first place, my gratitude goes out to my daily supervisor Ann Rigney. She not only offered me an intellectual training for which I am deeply grateful, but also helped me to keep my eyes on the ball (that is: finishing on time). She moreover provided me and the other members of our research group with many opportunities to present our work and to gain experience in many other aspects of academic life. I have hung out with PhD students long enough to know that I was very lucky to have a supervisor I could trust completely in intellectual manners, and one that was moreover there to guide us through the process of becoming independent academics. Her style in both the scholarly and social sense is a continuous source of inspiration for me. In the many stimulating conversations we have had over the years, my second supervisor Frank van Vree of the University of Amsterdam provided me with crucial insights into Dutch colonial and postcolonial history, while his critical and open-minded attitude kept my senses sharp and my mind active. Like Ann, Frank taught me to combine thorough empirical and historical research with conceptually rigorous reflection – the art of which I have far from perfected but which in my mind is the ultimate goal of our type of research. As this was the last step in my formal training, my acknowledgement also goes out to Dick van Halsema, professor emeritus at the VU University in Amsterdam, who was my first teacher. Now that I have started teaching myself, I find myself increasingly returning to his invaluable lessons. I thank the members of my reading committee Susan Legêne, Elsbeth Locher-Scholten, Paulo de Medeiros, Julia Noordegraaf, Pamela Pattynama, and Berteke Waaldijk for their time and efforts. I want to thank the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research for making this project financially possible. The staff at the Research Institute for History and Culture I thank for providing a pleasant and caring work environment. Maarten Prak and Frans Ruiter were inspiring examples of how to be head of an organization with many aspiring but also meandering and young scholars like myself, while Simone Veld and José van Aelst have guided me through some of the more challenging moments in those four years. This is also the place to thank Hans Bertens for the stimulating and helpful conversations we have had.\n\n8\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nI am grateful to those who have provided me with feedback on my writing during various stages of my project – Elsbeth Locher-Scholten, Ann Jensen Adams, Dick van Halsema, Liedeke Plate, Chiara de Cesari, Marta Zarzycka, Elizabeth Edwards, and an anonymous peer reviewer of Amsterdam University Press – and whose comments have shaped individual chapters and the frames of my book as a whole. Throughout the whole period, the members of the Utrecht research group on cultural memory – Ann Rigney, Laura Basu, David Wertheim, Chiara de Cesari, Jesseka Batteau, Alana Gillespie, and Nicole Immler – have generously devoted their time to read my work, listen to my presentations, and helped me with stimulating discussions and probing questions. Many others have elaborately discussed the ins and outs of my project with me, while providing me with the necessary signposts for fields to which I was a newcomer. Here, I would like to especially mention Astrid Erll. Columbia University and especially Marianne Hirsch were my hosts during six extraordinarily fruitful months in 2008 when I first conceived of my thesis as a whole. Leo Haks offered me generous access to his collection of books and postcards and helped me map out the enormous field of Dutch colonial visual culture. Anneke Groeneveld of the Nederlands Fotomuseum in Rotterdam, Jaap Anten of the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (KITLV) in Leiden, and Steven Vink of the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) in Amsterdam offered me generous access to the photographic collections of their institutes. I want to thank my colleagues at the Netherlands Graduate School for Literary Studies (OSL) for all the great and fun events we organized together. I thank my friends for their love and support. This book is dedicated to my father, Arie, who encouraged me to choose a critical and social topic, my mother Lous, who gave me the courage and ambition to start and finish an enterprise like this, my brother Matthijs and my aunt Mieke.\n\nIntroduction Icons of Memory and Forgetting In the Dutch East Indies – the group of islands that is now part of the Republic of Indonesia – a number of photographs of colonial atrocities were taken in 1904. This study investigates the subsequent appearances of these photographs in Dutch cultural memory, i.e. the way in which groups of people remember the past through all kinds of representations.1 The photographs, which depict the results of massacres in villages in the Gajo and Alas lands on the island of Sumatra, were taken by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) during a military expedition as part of the Atjeh War, which lasted from 1873 to 1908.2 This study follows these photographs over the course of the last century as they were framed by texts, other images, and discourses within Dutch cultural memory by a variety of mnemonic communities: groups that produce cultural memories and are themselves shaped by these.3 The most important of these communities in this book is the nation of the Netherlands as an imagined community, while important other communities include the Dutch military (chapters 1 and 2) and the Indische Dutch – those Dutch adults and children who had lived in the Dutch East Indies (chapter 3). All in all, these photographs reappeared more than seventy times in a wide variety of contexts. 4 The two photographs that stand at the heart of this study were taken on 14 June 1904 by a Dutch medical officer named H. M. Neeb of the Dutch colonial army. They were taken after the massacre of 561 adults and children of the village of Koetö Réh in the Alas land, south of the area called Atjeh (now: Aceh) on the island of Sumatra (Figures 0.1 and 0.2, henceforth 1 For the most complete overview of the field of cultural memory studies, see Erll 2011. In this study, I follow Frederick Cooper in defining a colonial empire as a “political unit that is large, expansionist” and which subjects people to “coercive incorporation into an expansionist state and invidious distinction”. What distinguishes colonial empires in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries from other types of empires, Cooper writes, was the fact that “[s]ubordination was no longer a fate to which anyone might be subject, but a status assigned to specific people, whose marking therefore became an issue” (2005, pp. 27-8). Dutch policies and operations are called “imperial” when I focus on the expansionist aspects of the Dutch colonial empire (especially the many local wars between 1870 and 1914, which from an international perspective can be characterized as the period of “modern imperialism”), and “colonial” in all other cases. 2 On the Atjeh War, see Van ’t Veer 1969; Reid 1969, 1979; Groen 1983; Siegel 2000. 3 For the concept of mnemonic community, see Zerubavel 2003. 4 See “List of where the 1904 photographs have appeared” at the back of this book.\n\nFigure 0.1.

During a military expedition that was part of efforts around 1900 by the Dutch to subjugate all the islands of what is now the Republic of Indonesia, a number of villages in the Alas and neighboring Gajo lands were stormed by the army, which kept on shooting until all resistance had stopped. KR2 shows the walled village in which the bodies of murdered villagers form a diagonal line that runs like a river from the lower right corner all the way to the left side of the image and then upwards to a group of soldiers who are preparing the burial of the dead. In KR3, soldiers of the colonial army and their commander (lieutenant-colonel G. C. E. van Daalen, standing all the way to the left) stand on the palisade of Koetö Réh, while killed Alas lie scattered on the village ground. In the center of the image, next to the soldier standing on the village ground and sitting in a cage-like construction of poles, a surviving child can be seen. In chapter 1, these two images will be more elaborately analyzed and contextualized. By investigating these specific images, this study seeks to change thinking on the nature of cultural memory and forgetting in general and Dutch colonial memory in particular.5 In the Netherlands, commentators have claimed over and over again that the colonial past – especially its violence – has been “forgotten” in the sense that it has vanished without a trace. Uncovering “lost” photographs has thereby become a regularly returning theme aimed at unmasking a hidden truth. There was, moreover, always someone to blame for the supposed amnesia, from politicians and historians to the press and the military. In my view, there are two problems with this analysis: on the one hand it supposes a binary opposition between memory and forgetting, while on the other hand it starts from the assumption that cultural memory is a phenomenon brought about or thwarted by the intentions and actions of specific human actors. Against this either/or, intentionalist perspective on cultural memory, which is also the dominant approach within the broader field of memory studies, this book argues that memories can also have a more ambiguous – and in this case, haunting – presence in society and that it is not always possible to pinpoint specific actors who are to blame (or praise) for cultural memory being the way it is. Building on the work of Ann Laura Stoler, Michel Foucault, and Paul Ricoeur, in particular, I will show that rather than being absent, the 1904 photographs have consistently been present in the Dutch public sphere, but that they have sometimes 5 “Colonial memory” means “memory of colonialism”, and I use it as an umbrella term for all cultural memories of colonialism in both the colonial and postcolonial periods.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n13\n\nappeared as absent because they were not meaningful within established frameworks. The problem with these photographs, therefore, is not one of being lost or found but one of semanticization, i.e. the production of meaning. One concept that will be crucial throughout this book is Ann Laura Stoler’s “cultural aphasia” (2009a, 2011), which can be described as the inability of a mnemonic community to find appropriate words to name events in the world. This book introduces the concept of “emerging memory” to characterize the type of memory that is produced in a situation of cultural aphasia. Emerging memories are those representations of the past that are periodically rediscovered while retaining their shady presence. They keep on irritating a culture’s self-conception because they prove hard to integrate into the existing narratives that a mnemonic community tells about itself and its past. That they nevertheless regularly re-emerge proves their durable relevance for the community in question.\n\nIcons of Memory and Forgetting A number of recent publications accompanied by photographs of Dutch colonial violence illustrate the current understanding of these images. One is a 2010 book by István Bejczy on the history of the Netherlands from prehistory to 2009. Bejczy writes that because of his book’s scope and the limited number of pages, he offers only “elementary knowledge”: of all phases in Dutch history, only the basics are given (5). The two short sections on the Dutch East Indies survey the most important events from that period6 and include two images: one of the signing of the transfer of sovereignty in 1949 (233)7 and KR2, taken after what Bejczy calls the destruction of Koetö Réh by the Dutch colonial army during the Atjeh War (209). In the book, the latter image works on different levels, but one of these is that it sums up the whole of the history of the Dutch in the Indies in one photograph of colonial atrocity. In another overview of Dutch history by Geert Mak et al. entitled Past of the Netherlands, KR3 is called an icon of the Dutch colonial past (2008: 376). Robert Hariman and John Lucaites describe photographic icons as 6 The Dutch East Indies fell into Dutch hands again in 1816, after a British interregnum from 1811. From the perspective of the Dutch state, the Dutch East Indies came to an end in 1949. Indonesia declared itself independent in 1945. 7 This well-known film still shows Queen Juliana sitting between Indonesian Prime Minister Mohammad Hatta and Dutch Prime Minister Willem Drees.\n\n14\n\nEmerging Memory\n\n[those] photographic images appearing in print, electronic, or digital media that are widely recognized and remembered, are understood to be representations of historically significant events, activate strong emotional identification or response, and are reproduced across a range of media, genres, or topics. (2007: 27)\n\nThe authors of Past of the Netherlands compare the 1904 photograph to Picasso’s Guernica (1937) and Nick Ut’s photograph Napalm Girl (1972) from the Vietnam War. In the same way that those images represent not only the bombing of the Basque town of Guernica and a girl running down the road after a napalm attack but also the Spanish and Vietnam Wars respectively, the 1904 photograph, these historians claim, represents in the Netherlands the Atjeh War, colonial warfare, or even the Dutch colonial past.8 As a widespread representation of a historically significant event, the photograph of Koetö Réh is produced here as an icon of memory. In contrast to these two history books, there is a publication that appeared in 2010 in a one-off magazine published on the occasion of Memorial Day and Liberation Day on 4 and 5 May respectively (Figure 0.3).9 Since the purpose of the organizing committee of these holidays was “to place the memory of and discussion on the Second World War and discussion about it in a broad context” (back matter), the magazine includes, among others, articles on the Srebrenica massacres, iconic war photographs, contemporary wars in Africa, war in video games, and – importantly for the present discussion – Dutch colonial warfare. This last article is entitled “The (Not to Be) Forgotten War in Atjeh”, and in it, author Lucia Hogervorst offers an account of how the Atjeh War was represented in Dutch high school history books from the 1950s onwards. Although the war was discussed in these books, she argues that in public memory the war is largely forgotten and that “[i]t is quite possible that the Atjeh War will be removed from the list of subjects [taught in high school], which is overcrowded anyhow” (56). She illustrates 8 See Peirce 1955 on iconic signs. 9 C. van der Heijden 2010. The magazine was freely distributed “at manifestations on the occasion of the commemoration of the [Second World] war at Dutch public libraries, service clubs, museums, and educational institutes” (back cover). Copies could be found in the socalled “liberation train” which housed an exhibition, and which was part of a larger program which included lectures, film screenings, and debates. The motto for the commemoration and celebration as a whole was “Stilstaan bij vrijheid”, which means both “Dwelling upon Freedom” and “Not Taking Freedom for Granted”. See: www.stilstaanbijvrijheid.nl. Retrieved on 17 June 2010. The 4th and 5th of May commemorate the deaths in the Second World War and the liberation of the Netherlands (and the Dutch East Indies) respectively.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n15\n\nFigure 0.3.

NIOD Library.\n\nher article with two photographs, one of which is from 1898 from the Pedir expedition, which was also part of the Atjeh War (Figure 0.4, henceforth referred to as PD). It shows Dutch colonial soldiers standing around and on top of killed Atjehnese opponents as if they were hunting trophies. Within the context of the article, the photograph emerges as a revelation: the reader is told s/he is observing something that is important but that has nevertheless been forgotten. In the context of the magazine, the photograph becomes something of an indictment, for the Atjeh War is the only subject presented as no longer being where it properly belongs: in Dutch cultural memory. Whereas in the two history books discussed above, a photograph of colonial violence was an icon of memory, here it is an icon of forgetting. The paradox produced by these publications is that although these photographs are, in the words of Hariman and Lucaites, historically significant, emotionally charged, and widely reproduced, they are nevertheless considered to be hidden. What I argue in this book is that this is the case not because these images have actually been unavailable or are part of a cover-up but because they have failed to become meaningful within a national framework for most observers, while for others they cannot be viewed in any other manner.\n\n16\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nFigure 0.4.

How has Dutch colonialism and especially its violence been remembered by Dutch colonial historians?11 According to Cees Fasseur, the dominant perspective in Dutch history books from the colonial period was the colonial gaze. The only exceptions, he writes, were the works of J. C. van Leur who had argued that the Dutch image of the Indies was limited to what was visible “from the deck of the ship, the rampart of the fortress, the high 10 I limit myself here to the cultural memory of Dutch colonialism in Asia. 11 There are several publications that primarily address the historiography of Dutch colonialism during both the colonial and postcolonial periods. See Cribb 1994; Van Doorn 1994, pp. 11-17; Fasseur 1995, pp. 252-73; Wesseling 1995; Houben 2002; Raben 2007. On military colonial historiography of the Netherlands; See Groen 1983. On the history exams in Dutch high schools, of which colonial history wat a part in 1976, 1988, 2001, and 2007, see Sutherland 2000 and Locher-Scholten 2006.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n17\n\ngallery of the trading-house”.12 Until the end of the colonial period, there was little nuance in the Dutch image of the Indies, as illustrated by the 1941 collaborative study Something Great Was Achieved There… The Dutch East Indies in the XXth Century (Fasseur 1995: 255).13 All in all, early Dutch colonial historians were part and parcel of the national project of Dutch colonialism. In the first decades after decolonization – the Dutch acknowledged Indonesia’s independence in 1949 after two so-called police actions in 1947 and 1948-1949, while the last Dutch colony in Asia, New Guinea, was annexed by Indonesia in 1962-63 – several non-Dutch scholars such as the American George McTurnan Kahin (1952) and the Swiss Rudolf von Albertini (1966) wrote critical studies of both Dutch colonialism and its ending, to which historians in the Netherlands gave a dismissive response (Fasseur 1995). These Dutch historians themselves, in the meantime, were mostly silent about the colonial past. To counter the foreign critiques, in 1961 H. Baudet and I. J. Brugmans edited a volume entitled Taking Stock of Policy (Balans van beleid) in which Dutch repatriates from the Indies looked back positively on the colonial period, while from 1963 onwards S. L. van der Wal and others published twelve volumes of source material on Dutch colonial policy in the period 1900-1942.14 From 1957 onwards, moreover, plans were made for another collection of sources, namely on the decolonization period (1945-1950). Twenty volumes were eventually published between 1971 and 1996.15 Elsbeth Locher-Scholten notes that source publications can be a way to write about contested issues, as the suggestion is made that no interpretations are offered and the sources “speak for themselves” (1997: 256). According to Fasseur (1995: 259), the outcome of these source publications was a much less positive image of Dutch policies, especially vis-à-vis Indonesian nationalism, than the editors had hoped for. Around 1970, a number of studies were published that focused specifically on Dutch colonial violence.16 The early twenty-first century saw renewed scholarly 12 See Fasseur 1995, pp. 252-73; see Van Leur 1939. The English translation of the quote by Van Leur is derived from Wertheim 1954, p. 168. 13 The Dutch title is Daar wèrd wat groots verricht…Nederlandsch-Indië in de XXste eeuw. See Van Helsdingen 1941. 14 See Van der Wal 1963; Van der Wal 1964-1965; Van der Wal 1967; Creutzberg 1972-1975; Kwantes 1975-1982. 15 On the history and reception of this series, see Locher-Scholten 1997. 16 The 1969 Memorandum of Excesses which listed excessive violence used by Dutch soldiers during the first and second police actions (also called the Dutch-Indonesian Wars); Paul van ’t Veer, The Atjeh War (1969); and J. A. A. van Doorn and W. J. Hendrix, The Derailment of Violence: About the Dutch/Indisch/Indonesian Conflict (1970), which was about Dutch violence in the\n\n18\n\nEmerging Memory\n\ninterest in this latter topic with Stef Scagliola’s book (2002) on what she called the “working through” of Dutch war crimes committed during the police actions and with Henk Schulte Nordholt’s article (2002) on the Dutch East Indies as a “state of violence”. Both authors positioned themselves as breaking through a scholarly silence. What we can conclude is that, except for the first decade after decolonization, Dutch historians have published extensively on the Dutch colonial past, including its violence, but that there has been a sustained difficulty matching events and categories. The endless volumes with source material point to the struggle experienced by Dutch historians in writing about this subject, while the ever-present need to unveil the truth shows that within professional history, colonial violence is unfinished business. What is telling in this respect is the debate about the concept of imperialism: it was only in the 1980s and 1990s that it became an acceptable concept among Dutch colonial historians, with the longstanding tradition of seeing Dutch colonialism as a benign exception to the rule being abandoned.17 At the same time, Schulte Nordholt’s thesis of the Indies as a state of violence has been further developed in a number of key historical publications on Dutch colonial violence towards the end of the colonial period, for instance in Marieke Bloembergen’s history (2009) of the police in the Indies and in the special edition of Journal of Genocide Research on mass violence and the end of the Dutch colonial empire in Indonesia (Luttikhuis & Moses 2012; Raben 2012). Still, in the same issue, Remco Raben writes that “Dutch historiography has demonstrated… an indifference to the humanitarian disasters wrought by colonial assertion” (488). In Dutch colonial history, colonial violence is both a topic of regular debate and frequently experienced as forgotten. Dutch colonial memory in the broader social scene has been studied in many books and articles. An important part of these studies addresses the memory of the Japanese occupation, during which many Dutch suffered both inside and outside the Japanese camps, and the memory of the years of violence between 1945 and 1949.18 According to Gert Oostindie (2010: 79), the late 1940s.

The most important explanation for this is that those who suffered during the Japanese occupation or during the late 1940s are present and vocal within postcolonial Dutch society, but those that made up the largest group under Dutch colonialism – then legally called “natives”, now Indonesians – are not. Next to whites and natives there was a third group that was identified within the racial classificatory system in the Dutch East Indies, namely the mixed-race Indische Dutch or Indo-Europeans. Legally, these people were Europeans. Together with totoks or white Indische Dutch, they form the group of 300,000 repatriates from the Indies usually referred to as “Indische Dutch”. Although Indo-Europeans suffered from racial discrimination in the Indies, they generally did not publicly identify themselves as victims of Dutch colonialism. As Lizzy van Leeuwen has shown, differences of color within the Indische community were ignored as much as possible. In order for this color blindness to be maintained, there was an increasing tendency among the members of this group to identify themselves as victims of the Second World War, during which all Dutch had been “equally” victimized (2008: 345). In short, Indonesian victims of the colonial period did not have spokespersons from 2010; Bijl 2011; De Mul 2011; Scagliola 2012; Bijl 2012; Van Ooijen and Raaijmakers 2012; Raben 2012; Pattynama 2014. A rich source on Dutch cultural memory of decolonization is Remco Meijer’s collection of interviews East-Indisch Deaf: The Dutch Debate on the Decolonization in Indonesia from 1995, in which Meijer took up interviews with eighteen Dutch historians and authors who reflected on the Dutch cultural memory of Indonesia’s decolonization. Stef Scagliola’s 2002 Burden of War: Coming to Terms with the Dutch War Crimes in Indonesia relates how Dutch politicians, historians, and veterans from the Dutch-Indonesian Wars have remembered Dutch violence during those wars. A milestone for reflection on the Japanese occupation is historian Remco Raben’s edited volume Representing the Japanese Occupation of Indonesia: Personal Testimonies and Public Images in Indonesia, Japan, and the Netherlands from 1999, specif ically because in this book not only Dutch but also Indonesian and Japanese perspectives are elaborately discussed. In 2002, Esther Captain published her dissertation on the experiences and recollections as recounted in the journals and memoirs of (former) internees of Japanese camps. Lizzy van Leeuwen’s 2008 book Our Indian Heritage on the cultural heritage of repatriates from the Indies and the dissemination of this heritage in Dutch society includes an elaborate account of the nostalgia towards the Indies in Dutch colonial memory, centered around the term “tempo doeloe” which in the Netherlands means “the good old days” (99-167). In 2010, Gert Oostindie published Postcolonial Netherlands: Sixty-five Years of Remembrance, Commemoration, Repression in which he gives an overview of the immigration, struggle, and gradual integration in the Netherlands of migrants from the Indies, Suriname, and the Dutch Antilles. This book also has a section on Dutch colonial memory (148-58).\n\n20\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nwithin their own midst to make their case in the Netherlands and could only be spoken for by Dutch people, while there was little room for people who were not identified as white to speak up.19 Elsbeth Locher-Scholten has described the long journey and the many efforts on the part of the Indische Dutch to have the Japanese capitulation commemorated in the Netherlands. It has only been since 1999 that a special commemorative ceremony is held each year on 15 August at a monument built for this very purpose in The Hague. She emphasizes the diversity within the group of 300,000 people who came to the Netherlands in the period between 1945 and 1964: former soldiers; those who had been imprisoned by the Japanese; those who were children during the Japanese occupation (kampkinderen); and the group of Indo-Europeans who had not been imprisoned but still had to endure many hardships (buitenkampers) (1999). In addition, there were Moluccan soldiers who had fought for the Dutch against the Indonesian Republic and who had been brought to the Netherlands under misleading pretexts. They had been told that their stay in the Netherlands would only be temporary, as they would soon be returning to their own Republic of the South Moluccas (RMS), and were dismissed from the army as soon as they arrived (see Smeets and Steijlen 2006). Race had far-reaching effects on the groups coming from the Indies: Gert Oostindie (2010: 83) writes that the concerns of totoks, for instance, often supplanted those of Indo-Europeans, so that white suffering was more visible within Dutch society. In the 1940s and 1950s, these groups were given very little attention. Victimhood was not an acknowledged category in the Netherlands at this time, and people were expected to completely adapt to mainstream Dutch society (see Van Leeuwen 2008: 47-98 and chapter 3). (The same was true for the victims of German National-Socialism.) As Esther Captain has shown in the case of former internees of Japanese camps, however, people did speak within their communities – though “in a whisper”, as she emphatically calls it (2002: 189). Moreover, a small group of Indo-Europeans around Tjalie Robinson cherished “Indo culture” and kept the memory of the Indies alive (Van Leeuwen 2008: 47-98). At the end of the 1960s, the colonial past began to be hotly debated once again as a result of the 1969 television appearances of Dutch colonial army soldier Joop Hueting in which he discussed acts of violence committed by 19 On the notion of spokespersonship in relation to cultural memory, see De Haan 1997, pp. 151-4, 229.

These facts, positioned as revelations, led to widespread debate in the Dutch media all throughout 1969 (see chapter 4 of this book). During the 1970s, increasing attention was paid to the psychological effects of war, resulting in the growing conviction among a large part of the population that victims of war should be taken care of in the context of the welfare state (Locher-Scholten 1999: 62-3). The same decade also saw a number of violent actions by Moluccans, for instance the hijacking of trains in 1975 and 1977. Meanwhile, tempo doeloe culture – the Dutch variant of postcolonial nostalgia – became increasingly popular in the Netherlands, making Indische culture available to all Dutch, whether they came from the Indies or not (see Van Leeuwen 2008; Bijl 2013; and chapter 3 of this book). In the 1980s, migrants from the Indies became more organized and put pressure on a very reluctant Dutch state to acknowledge their suffering and to compensate them financially. However, as Hans Meijer concluded in a 2005 study, the so-called backpay has been too late and, to this day, too little. Gert Oostindie (2010: 79) writes that the Indische and Moluccan memories of the Second World War in the Pacific and its aftermath are marked by bitter grievance. Other things were successfully established, however, such as the Indische Monument in The Hague (1988), the Indische Remembrance Centre Bronbeek in Arnhem, and the financing of a research project on the history of Dutch people from the Indies by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).20 Over the years, moreover, other groups of victims and periods of violence also came into view, such as the Bersiap period (1945-1946), a chaotic time of Indonesian violence after the Japanese capitulation during which many Indo-Europeans and Chinese were murdered (Bussemaker 2005); members of the resistance against the Japanese (Immerzeel and Van Esch 1993); girls and women who had been forced to work as prostitutes for the Japanese (Ars 2000; Banning and Janssen 2010); and African soldiers who had been recruited by the KNIL (Van Kessel 2005). The romusha – Indonesians who were forced to work for the Japanese and died in great numbers – were also recognized as having suffered. Emerging Memory is the first book-length study to analyze Dutch colonial memory during both the colonial and postcolonial periods in the Indies and the Netherlands, making it possible to gain insight into its continuities and discontinuities across decolonization. Most importantly, it seeks to offer 20 Willems 2001; Bosma and Raben 2003; Meijer 2004; Bosma, Raben and Willems 2006. See also Willems and Raben 1997; Meijer 2005; Keppy 2006.\n\n22\n\nEmerging Memory\n\na fresh perspective on Dutch colonial memory and to explain why Dutch colonial violence is rediscovered again and again and exposed as “forgotten”.\n\nDutch Colonial Forgetting What role does the notion of forgetting play in the literature and debates on Dutch colonial memory? The publication by Hogervorst discussed above is a variant on a narrative that goes back more than a century in the Netherlands in which the violence of Dutch colonialism is rediscovered time and again. Photographs often play a central role in the argument that is being made. In a 2009 photo book on the Dutch-Indonesian Wars, René Kok, Erik Somers, and Louis Zweers write: For a long time the official image of the war in Indonesia was determined by romantic images of ‘our boys overseas’, who, beneath the palm trees, were warmly greeted by a population which turned out in massive numbers… Before everything else, readers of newspapers had to be reassured… Intentionally a colored and misguiding image was given. (7)\n\nBy contrast, the authors write that the reader will find in their book the product of “[r]ecent research in archives in the Netherlands, the study of private collections, but also research of unknown collections of hard-toaccess archives in Indonesia”, which yielded “a selection of photographs which gives a more unfiltered view on what happened” (7-8). “Lost” photographs are not only presented as revelations in themselves but also set against other images that allegedly represent a dominant yet false image of the Indies in Dutch cultural memory (see also Vanvugt 1993). In his 2009 article “A Photograph (Sometimes) Says Less than a Thousand Words”, for instance, photo historian Hans Rooseboom discusses Dutch photo books from the postcolonial era with photographs from the Indies. These books, he writes, “have had a great influence on our image of the Dutch East Indies”, and “chiefly radiate harmony and serene quiet…: nostalgia and rest all around, nothing to see” (28). The article is accompanied by two photographs from the archives of the Deli Company and the Rubber Culture Company Amsterdam which show “large pieces of land where all trees have been cut, the trunks are lying around like matches and broad, deep roads have been dug out. Photographs like these we hardly ever find in books” (29). One of the photographs reminds Rooseboom of battle scenes from the First World War: “You could easily be mistaken, until on one of the photographs\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n23\n\na car enters the picture with two men in spotless white tropical outfits. Then you know for sure that you are not in Flanders, but in the Indies” (ibid). Historians, moreover, have described this sequence of events – the Indies are hidden; the Indies are exposed – as already taking place during the colonial period, for instance all the way back in 1904. In a 1996 book, historian Martin Bossenbroek contrasts two of the most reproduced photographs from the Dutch East Indies. He captions the first photograph (Figure 0.5) “Van Heutsz and his staff at Batoe Iliq. Eigen Haard, 23 November 1901”. The photograph shows the governor of Atjeh, J. B. van Heutsz, calmly observing his troops during the Atjeh War. This photograph had been published in the magazine Eigen Haard (“Sweet Home”) aimed at Dutch Protestant families. Bossenbroek writes that “that was the kind of violence everybody wanted to believe in, because it expressed the self-evident superiority of the Dutch rulers” (46; see also Bossenbroek 2001). The other photograph is a picture of the soldiers standing on the palisade of Koetö Réh (KR3). Bossenbroek writes: “That there were also other images was a shock, and especially a deep, personal disappointment for those who believed in a sanctified war… that kind of violence, no, that was not supposed to be part of it” (47). In Bossenbroek’s account, efforts to prevent Dutch colonial violence from falling into oblivion were already being undertaken in 1904.\n\nFigure 0.5. C. B. Nieuwenhuis. General van Heutsz and Staff at Baté Ilië, 1901. Postcard, 7.5 x 14 cm. KITLV/Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, Leiden, inv. no. 1403896.\n\n24\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nMany contemporary Dutch historians are not too fond of the critique that the Dutch have yet to uncover their own colonial history. Bossenbroek’s argument can be read as unmasking the unmaskers by showing that colonial violence was already “discovered” in 1904. In a 1995 interview, historian Jan Bank criticized those who only accused without offering an analysis of Dutch colonialism. Typical in this respect, he claimed, was a discussion on the front page of a national newspaper (de Volkskrant) of a 1994 book on the first Dutch police action against the Republic of Indonesia in 1947, which offered only data “which had already been known for a long time. Apparently, the new generation of Volkskrant editors saw something very new in it” (Bank 1995: 82). Locher-Scholten (2002: 669) also argues that the media have a weak memory. Fasseur, responding to accusations that he himself had covered up certain aspects of Dutch colonial history, writes that some participants in the debate “seem to possess the memory of a three-year-old child”, as almost all aspects have already been taken up in historical studies: “Those who wish to refresh their memory this year are therefore recommended to pay a trip to the book store or the remaindered books of De Slegte [the Dutch Strand]” (1995: 273). And J. A. A. van Doorn noted in 1995 that “Those who are now still asking for a debate on the Indies, as happened again at the beginning of this year, have not read a newspaper or watched television for thirty years” (72). The “unmaskers”, in the meantime, are often surprised that their revelations do not lead to anything. Rudy Kousbroek, who published a number of books and articles intended to expose Dutch colonialism, admits to having been surprised that “there were hardly any responses. No polemics, no letters to the editor” (1992: 241). Scagliola, who can be identified as one of the few “unmasking” historians, writes that while investigating what she saw as a “cover-up culture” concerning the Dutch colonial past, she came across “an unexpected factor”: “Not only me, but also [others] apparently have the misplaced expectation that a disclosure about a significant case would automatically lead to a debate” (2002: 244). In a 1995 interview, Joop Hueting, the Dutch colonial soldier who had revealed Dutch war crimes back in January 1969, remarked that when the My Lai case in Vietnam became known in November 1969, “the Dutch stood up front to cry shame over it” as if they had learned nothing and nothing had changed (57). A similar argument is present in the debate on the role of the media: some argue that the media do not show enough of the Dutch colonial past, especially its violence, while others hold that this is the only thing they show. Locher-Scholten (1994a, 1997) sees an important role for the media in “closing the gap between scholarship and the public” concerning knowledge\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n25\n\nof the police actions in the late 1940s. Historians, she says, have done their job. Media historian Chris Vos (1994, 1999) challenges the assumption that the media have not paid enough attention to the Dutch violence back then and writes that since 1969 there have been dozens of television documentaries on the police actions that were critical about the role the Dutch played. On the other side of the spectrum are those who hold that the media pay too much attention to colonial violence. Historian P. J. Drooglever, for instance, claims that in the media “a moralizing approach rules, in which the past is seen in terms of good and evil, and attention is concentrated on a few moments” (quoted in Blokker 1997: 304), leading to an overemphasis on the violence of colonialism. All in all, everybody has found somebody else to blame for what Bank (1995: 86) has called the remarkable fact that the results of historical research do not seem to be coming across to the general public. The photographs are simultaneously said to be on the table and under the carpet. This study seeks to explain this contradiction and to show the complexity behind what has been presented as a binary opposition between memory and forgetting. I argue that rather than focusing on a lack or surplus of documents, this problem can best be analyzed by looking at the way in which these documents have been framed.\n\nForgetting in Cultural Memory Studies A comparable opposition between memory and forgetting as it figures in the Dutch debate on colonial memory is sometimes operative in the field of cultural memory studies. Astrid Erll gives a sketch of the broad field of memory studies, which in her account ranges from “individual acts of remembering in a social context to group memory (of family, friends, veterans, etc.) to national memory with its ‘invented traditions,’ and finally to the host of transnational lieux de mémoire such as the Holocaust and 9/11” (Erll & Nünning 2008: 2). In the last decades, the nexus of intentional remembering, narrative, and identity has been central to the field. In cultural memory studies, less has been written about forgetting than about memory, though when forgetting is brought up, it is usually given great importance.21 One of the first who pointed to the importance of forgetting 21 See, for instance, overviews of the field provided by Olick and Robbins 1998; Misztal 2003; Erll 2005; Erll and Nünning 2008; Radstone and Schwarz 2010; Olick, Vinitzhy-Serouss and Levy 2011; Erll 2011.\n\n26\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nin a national context was Ernest Renan, who in his 1882 lecture “What is a Nation?” asserted that “[f]orgetting, I would even go so far as to say historical error, is a crucial factor in the creation of a nation” (1990: 11; see also Anderson 1991). Literary scholar Harald Weinrich wrote about the word “forgetting” (vergessen in German): Etymologically, the element -gessen (compare to the English -get in forget) expresses a movement towards me: I “receive” something. However, through the prefix ver-, this movement… changes in the opposite direction. Now the word expresses “to receive away”. There is an element of irritation in this turnabout movement which is also expressed in the fact that in German vergessen is an active verb… while our observation of events of forgetting indicates rather that forgetting happens to us without our active doing. (1997: 11-12)\n\nFollowing historian Luisa Passerini, we can point to a paradox in forgetting: we cannot look for something we forgot unless we remember it at least in part (2003: 239). While in the word “forgetting”, there is a tension between presence and absence, this is much less the case in the metaphors used to discuss forgetting. As Weinrich (1997: 16-18) shows, a binary logic is operative: metaphors of space and landscape represent forgetting as a wilderness, a desert where it does not matter whether you write in the wind or the sand; metaphors of the storehouse or the archive represent forgetting as what is hidden: it is in an abyss, in the dark, or even in a crypt or grave; metaphors of writing represent forgetting as a tabula rasa, an erasure, a lack. This binary logic can also be found in a number of publications in cultural memory studies. Aleida Assmann, for instance, uses the metaphor of the storehouse in the distinction she makes between storage memory (Speichergedächtnis) and functional memory (Funktionsgedächtnis) in her 1999 Erinnerungsräume: On the collective level, storage memory consists of what has become unusable, obsolete and strange; the neutral, factual knowledge alien to identity, but also the repertoire of missed possibilities, alternative options and unused chances. In the case of functional memory, however, it is all about appropriated memory, which emerges from a process of selection, connecting, and construction of meaning. (137)\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n27\n\nWhile functional memory is “inhabited”, storage memory is “uninhabited”, and “radically separates the past from the present and the future” (133). The dichotomy between remembering and forgetting and the metaphor of the storehouse return in a more recent article from 2008, in which Assmann writes that “[i]n order to remember some things, other things must be forgotten” (2008: 97). Forgetting is thus associated with neglect, destruction, and trash. While the distinction Assmann has made is in many respects fruitful, it cannot account for the type of case in which there is a simultaneity of memory and forgetting. This binary way of thinking is also present in Paul Connerton’s book How Modernity Forgets in which he argues that in modernity (which he defines as the capitalist world since 1850) the “art of memory”, featuring both “a stable system of places” and “a human scale”, is undermined by “processes that separate social life from locality and from human dimensions: superhuman speed, megacities that are so enormous as to be unmemorable, consumerism disconnected from the labor process, the short lifespan of urban architecture, the disappearance of walkable cities”. All these transformations threaten “the meaning of life based on shared memories” (2009: 5). Connerton offers a bleak image of a hostile world in which everybody is an everlasting victim of forgetful modernity, while the pre-modern world was one full of embodied, territorialized memory. The same dichotomous thinking about memory and forgetting can be found in his 2008 essay “Seven Types of Forgetting” in which he claims that forgetting is usually seen as failing. He goes on to offer a typology of forgetting in which memory is again and again “eliminated”, “consigned to oblivion”, “forbidden”, and “discarded”. In Connerton’s perspective, there is either memory or forgetting. How easily his argument can be turned around, however, becomes apparent if we look at Viktor MayerSchönberger’s argument (2009: 241) that in the digital age we have lost the capacity to forget, as everything is stored in the digital realm. The easy shifting of “the age of forgetting” from modern to pre-digital times alone is indicative that something more complicated is going on than studies like these suggest.\n\nObjects: The 1904 Photographs as Portable Monuments This study investigates the complexity of memory and forgetting by looking at the subsequent appearances of a number of photographs of colonial violence from 1904. According to Hariman and Lucaites, photographs are\n\n28\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nevoked in public debates, and their history of appropriation is also a history of public culture (2007: 173). As this study will show, the 1904 photographs have indeed functioned as such and have from their first public appearance onwards been framed as icons which formed important points of social encounter for debates on Dutch colonialism and Dutch colonial memory.22 They form an example of what Ann Rigney has called the workings of the “scarcity principle” in cultural memory, by which she means: the fact that everything that in theory might be written or said about the world does not actually get to be said in practice. Culture is always in limited supply, and necessarily so, since it involves producing meaning in an ongoing way through selection, representation and interpretation. (2005: 16)\n\nScarcity in cultural memory, Rigney argues, leads to the selection, convergence, and repetition of memories. As will be shown, the 1904 photographs have gone through all such processes. The social biography of photographs such as those from 1904 provides a good case study to investigate the complexity of cultural memory and forgetting because in it we find a set of relatively stable cultural artifacts together with a history of widely differing semanticizations.23 Photographs are “portable monuments”, a concept I derive from the work of Rigney to denote sites of memory that “can be carried over into new situations” (2004: 383).24 Rigney builds on the concept of a lieu de mémoire as developed by Pierre Nora (1996) and defined by Astrid Erll as “any cultural phenomenon, whether material, social or mental, which a society associates with its past and with [its] identity” (2011: 25). The 1904 photographs have been reproduced regularly: in the Indies and the Netherlands more than seventy times, and in media that are connected to crucial events and tendencies in Dutch colonialism and its aftermath. Few photographs from the Indies have been reprinted that often or have\n\n22 I use the term “icon” primarily as it was developed by Charles Sander Peirce, not as it was developed by Hariman and Lucaites. This means that the concept of icon, in this study, is first of all an indication of a photograph’s likeness to its object and not so much of its wide reproduction, dissemination, recognition, and remembrance. 23 For the notion of the social biography, see Appadurai 1986; Kopytoff 1986; Edwards 2001. 24 Rigney distinguishes these portable monuments, which in her case are primarily literary texts, from lieux de mémoire in a more literal sense, e.g. stone monuments that are “fixed in a particular site”.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n29\n\nbeen invested with so many different meanings.25 Unlike artifacts from later periods, moreover, these photographs enable a significant stretch of the colonial period to be dealt with. That they are photographs from the Atjeh War is no coincidence, for as Petra Groen writes, “about the expeditions in Atjeh more has been published than on all the military operations in all the other areas of the Dutch East Indies combined” (1983: 93). The study of the 1904 photographs can be seen as exemplary for the debate on Dutch colonial memory and forgetting as a whole as it has been conducted over the last century.26 This debate covers most of the colonial period in the Indies, from the period of modern imperialism (1870-1914) to the Dutch-Indonesian Wars of the late 1940s. There are, of course, many differences between the expeditions around 1900 and the police actions, but within the debate as such they have similar positions. As military historian Petra Groen said in an interview: “from the Dutch perspective… the [police] actions were in line with what were once called ‘expeditions’ to Atjeh and Lombok” (1995: 114). Most important, however, is my own finding that the model I have developed in this book to explain the ambiguous, shifting position of these photographs has proven to be productive for many other cases of and debates on Dutch colonial memory (see Bijl 2012).\n\nMethod: Frame Analysis The complexity of memory and forgetting in the subsequent appearances of the 1904 photographs is analyzed by investigating the ways in which these images were framed. Since Maurice Halbwachs’s 1925 book Les cadres sociaux de la mémoire, the concept of the frame has been used in cultural memory studies to describe the reciprocal relationship between individual memory and the social scene.27 An important source for the contemporary analysis of framing in culture studies is Jacques Derrida’s The Truth in Painting in which Derrida writes about the frame as the parergon (literally in Greek: “by the side of the work”), which is “neither work (ergon) nor outside 25 Other “candidates” include the three photographs mentioned above: the photograph from the 1890s of the soldiers standing on and around the killed Atjehnese as reproduced in Hogervorst 2010 (one could argue that this image is the same “type” as the 1904 ones); of Juliana at the transfer of sovereignty; and of Van Heutsz standing at Batoe Iliq. 26 There are a number of photo-historical studies on the 1904 photographs by Anneke Groene­ veld (1991, 2001). 27 See Halbwachs 1925; Halbwachs 1992, pp. 35-189; Irwin-Zarecka 1994; Erll 2005, pp. 34-35. Irwin-Zarecka bases her book on Goffman 1974.\n\n30\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nthe work [hors d’oeuvre], neither inside nor outside, neither above nor below, [and] disconcerts any opposition but does not remain indeterminate and… gives rise to the work” (1997: 9). Mieke Bal, in discussing the verb “framing”, prefers it over “context” since framing “produces an event” and involves “time in interpretation and analysis” (2002: 135-7). Framing should therefore not be seen as placing a frame that already existed in itself around an object or practice that already existed in itself, but as an event in which frame and framed produce each other. However, when there is no operational closure in the reciprocal production of frame and framed, the latter may exceed the former, leading to fissures of meaning. In such cases, as Judith Butler writes, “the frame never quite determined what it is we see, think, recognize and apprehend” (2009: 9). So while people perceive photographs in a certain manner because of certain frames, photographs can also have the power to question frames that are produced by a mnemonic community. This questioning may be a sign of a more fundamental ambiguity in a mnemonic community’s self-conceptions. It is this situation of photographs exceeding their framing that can produce cultural aphasia and emerging memory. In this study, framing is seen as operating on several levels, namely on the level of the photographic image, on the level of the accompanying texts and other images, and on the level of discourses. The frame of the physical border of the photograph is shaped during the photograph’s production and reproduction.28 Technologically, cameras and printing technologies in 1904 had certain possibilities, and the same goes for the technologies by which the photographs were reproduced at later moments. Due to longer shutter times in the early twentieth century, for instance, movement could not be registered on camera, which yielded a rather static impression of the scenes depicted. Compositionally, the positioning of the frame (e.g. through cropping or enlargement) and the resulting constellation of volumes and lines related the image to certain genres and visual cultures (i.e. the ways in which the visual is part of social life) (Rose 2007: 4). The positioning of conquerers above the vanquished, for instance, had been an iconic way to portray victory in Europe in 1904, while in the early twenty-first century – one century later – such images are seen with rather different eyes. Economically, not everyone had the means to buy a camera or the skills to take photographs, certainly 28 In the 1980s, critics placed much emphasis on the institutional and discursive framing of photographs (see Burgin 1982; Sekula 1986; Tagg 1988). Their distrust of photography is also strongly present in Sontag 1973. After the trenchant critiques of photography by critics in the 1980s, however, others have returned to the photographic image as an object of analysis (see Mitchell 1994; Batchen 1997; Edwards 2001; Hight and Sampson 2002; Mitchell 2005). On comparable tensions between image and language in art history, see Ginzburg 1990.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n31\n\nnot in 1904. In the Indies, photography was primarily a technology owned and used by Europeans, as in most colonial situations.29 Also today, the 1904 photographs are unevenly accessible: though widely reproduced in print and on the internet, not everyone has access to these media or the means or skills to reproduce or disseminate the photographs. Finally, discourses – the implicit systems that structure the way in which we perceive and produce reality – also condition the physical frame of the photograph. In 1904, imperial discourse – i.e. a discourse focused on expansion of the colonial empire – was the most important in this respect, but later on other discourses, e.g. anti-colonial ones, reproduced the photographs, framing them differently. The frame of the photographic image creates an active awareness of a “blind field”: the space beyond the frame and the moments before and after the one that the single photograph asks the viewer to imagine (Scott 1999: 26). The frame of the photographic image both stops and suggests the flow of time; it both delimits and suggests a space. This makes photographs both richly provocative and susceptible to texts and other images that can overwrite this blind field. As Clive Scott writes: “a language appropriate to the photograph is difficult to find… [and] the photograph is vulnerable to inappropriate languages” (ibid: 37). Because of the blind field, the same photograph can be semanticized, i.e. given a meaning in many ways depending on the way in which it is framed. The photographic image can be framed by a variety of texts and other images, a composition that forms what has been described by W. J. T. Mitchell as an “imagetext” (1994: 89): a mixed medium in which there is no strict division between texts (which can also be seen) and images (which can also be read) (2005: 343). A title or caption can relate to the photograph in three ways: it can label where and when a photograph was made, it can describe its contents, or it can take some distance from it so that the meaning of the photograph and its title or caption are in their “point of convergence” (Scott 1999: 47). These three relations roughly correspond to the semiotic triad index-icon-symbol as developed by the philosopher Charles Sander Peirce (1955). Photographs have a direct physical relation with the people and things in front of the lens 29 On European photography in the Indies, see Zweers 1988; Faber et al. 1989; Reed 1991; Vanvugt 1993; Wachlin 1994; Nieuwenhuys 1998; Mrázek 2002; Theuns-de Boer and Asser 2005; Van den Berg and Wachlin 2005; Groeneveld 2007; Jansen 2007; Bijl 2009.

Indices indicate: if there is no object, there is no index. An indexical caption is, for instance, “Koetö Réh, 14 June 1904”. Photographs also have a likeness to their objects, which makes them icons. The photographs of atrocity, for instance, have a likeness to the massacred village in Atjeh, but as icons they can also be seen as having a likeness to bigger things, such as the Atjeh War, or Dutch imperialism, or the Dutch East Indies as a whole. Photographs are particularly convincing icons, as they are also indices and appear to have this direct physical relation with their objects. Symbols, finally, work through convention: they are arbitrary. Placing your foot on top of a killed enemy, as happens in photograph PD for instance, is a symbol for victory, and “Victory” would be a symbolic caption for that particular photograph. In the case of iconic and symbolic captions, Scott writes, we are “a step away from the image towards its assimilation by, and interpretation through, language” (49), and the blind field of the photograph is overwritten. The grammar and syntax of captions is crucial to their interpretation: deictic elements, verb tenses, and other aspects can suggest acts and events or predicaments and conditions, direct the viewer’s focus towards acts or agents, and frame the photograph as a solitary image or part of a narrative (ibid: passim). With respect to narrativity: it is only through the frame of an imagetext that a single photograph, to which narrative is alien (ibid: 60), can be understood or viewed in a spatial-temporal continuity with a certain development.30 The same photograph can therefore become part of a victorious narrative of colonial conquest, an exceptional narrative of one officer’s bloodlust, or an uncertain questioning of national identity, to name just three of the narratives (or lack thereof) of which the Atjeh photographs have been a part. Once part of an imagetext, photographs are part of a semiotic channel through which a possible world can be accessed by a reader-viewer.31 Each imagetext in which a photograph is taken up provides access to a different possible world in which different protagonists in different times and spaces 30 The importance of narrative framing of photographs in a familial context is the topic of Hirsch 1997 and Langford 2001. 31 See Doležel 1998, pp. 12-24; Ryan 2001, pp. 99-105. Marie-Laure Ryan writes: “The basis of PW [possible-world] theory is the set-theoretical idea that reality—the sum total of the imaginable—is a universe composed of a plurality of distinct elements, or worlds, and that it is hierarchically structured by the opposition of one well-designated element, which functions as the center of the system, to all the other members of the set. The central element is commonly interpreted as “the actual world” and the satellites as merely possible worlds. For a world to be possible it must be linked to the center by a so-called accessibility relation”.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n33\n\nperform different actions. To give one example of space: in different imagetexts, the villages in the 1904 photographs of atrocity have been framed as lying in the Gajo and/or Alas lands, which was positioned either inside or outside of Atjeh. Atjeh itself has been framed as either always a part of the Republic of Indonesia (e.g. by Indonesian nationalists) or always independent (e.g. by members of the Free Aceh Movement GAM); it either never became part of the Dutch East Indies or did so without a doubt; and was sometimes, because of its historically strong ties with the Middle East, thought closer to Southwest Asia than to Java, the neighboring island. The villages have been framed as villages, or fortifications, or fortified villages, etc. What is specific of a possible world entered through an imagetext which includes documentary photographs is that it is mostly experienced as part of the actual world (i.e. an individual’s representation of reality): we read history, journalism, and comparable “realistic” genres as descriptions of (a past) reality, unless we feel the world they depict does not coincide with our actual world, in which case we resist accessing it. In short, all observers of the 1904 photographs have used them to tell a realist story about a past, present, or future world which somehow had spatial and temporal contiguity with their own world. Discourses are the implicit rules that condition how people observe the world and therefore how they interact with it (Foucault 1981). In this study, the concept of discourse is understood in terms of Jacques Rancière’s concept of le partage du sensible, in which partage means both “separation” and “distribution”, and sensible means “perceptible”. The distribution of the perceptible refers to “the implicit law governing the [perceptible] order that parcels out places and forms of participation in a common world” (2004: 85). In the colonial and postcolonial situations studied in this book, class, race, and gender are crucial elements in this distribution. Certain forms of participation in the world were only available to certain people, because the distribution of the perceptible places different bodies in different spaces and times. Natives in the Indies, for instance, were mostly seen as living in a time preceding (and thus more backward than) Europeans, making it impossible for them to achieve high-end positions within the colonial system or even to attain citizenship. Like Foucauldian discourses, the distribution of the perceptible conditions what is apprehended by the senses: “It is a delimitation of spaces and times, of the visible and the invisible, of speech and noise, that simultaneously determines the place and the stakes of politics as a form of experience” (ibid: 13). The implicit rules of the distribution of the perceptible lead to a particular “perceptible order”: how the social\n\n34\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nfield is visually constructed, or in more simple terms, what the world looks like at a certain moment.32 The 1904 photographs, produced by what I call an “imperial distribution of the perceptible” (see chapter 1), themselves exhibit an “imperial perceptible order”. What happened as they moved from frame to frame was that their perceptible order was reprinted in a variety of later distributions of the perceptible which were not compatible with the photograph, such as an ethical, a nostalgic, and an anti-authoritarian distribution of the perceptible (see chapters 2, 3, and 4). Such a confrontation between a distribution and an order that are at odds with each other can cause disturbances such as cultural aphasia. To summarize: in this study, a photograph, as part of an imagetext, is understood as a portable monument that provides access to a past possible world that is temporally and spatially related to the viewer’s actual world and, itself displaying a particular perceptible order, can create moments of irritation in relation to the distribution of the perceptible in which it is semanticized.\n\nEmerging Memory: Between Semanticization and Cultural Aphasia According to Judith Butler, “frames structure modes of recognition” (2008: 24) and “produce certain subjects as ‘recognizable’ persons and… others decidedly more difficult to recognize” (6): “there is no life and death without a relation to some frame” (7). Cultural memory is also dependent on the availability of frames. Yet, as was explained above, Butler also pointed out that there can be “[s]omething [which] exceeds the frame that troubles our sense of reality” (9). It is at such a moment that “other possibilities for apprehension emerge” (12).33 The instability caused by the 1904 photographs hinges on the question whether the dead they depict are part of a national narrative or not, and what the recognizability and memorability of these 32 I see Rancière’s “distribution of the perceptible” and “perceptible order” as running parallel to W. J. T. Mitchell’s “the social construction of the visual field” and “the visual construction of the social field”: “it is not just that we see the way we do because we are social animals, but also that our social arrangements take the form they do because we are seeing animals” (Mitchell 2005: 345). See also Mirzoeff 2009, pp. 15-20. 33 The circulation of photographs has been the subject of a number of anthropological studies such as Pinney (1997), Poole (1997), and Edwards (2001), several of which build on the concept of the social biography of objects as developed by Arjun Appadurai and Igor Kopytoff in the 1986 collection The Social Life of Things.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n35\n\nbodies means for the imagined and mnemonic community that is the Netherlands. The problem with these images is that they are at the same time a part of and outside of the national frame, as they can be neither incorporated nor expulsed. Framing, other than a binary opposition between memory and forgetting, directs attention towards the conditions of memory: not if there is memory but how, where, and for whom. Silences, moreover, do not always indicate absences. Passerini points out that while silences can indicate oblivion (unlike forgetting, oblivion is not a process but a state of mind), they can also point to the fact that “conditions for… expression no longer (or do not yet) exist” (238). This latter type of silence does not indicate a repression of “the event nor the memory nor even single traces, but [of] the very connection between memories and traces” (240). Paul Ricoeur has made a similar distinction between “forgetting through the erasing of traces” (Passerini’s oblivion) and “forgetting kept in reserve (oubli de réserve)” (2004: 414). In the latter case, “it is… no longer oblivion that materiality begets, forgetting by the effacement of traces, but forgetting in terms of a reserve or a resource” (440). These latter memories are “the birds in the dovecote… which I ‘possess’ but do not ‘hold’” (441). So even when the photographs and their semanticizations seem to have submerged at moments, this does not necessarily imply that they have sunk into oblivion but rather that they are kept “in reserve” (see also Edwards 2001: 1-23). When a photograph proves hard to frame, its observers can be confronted with what Derrida calls its “passe-partout”: the blank spaces between these frames and the image.34 Normally when we look at a photograph, it functions as a window on the world, yet when we are contronted with its materiality, we see it as a photograph and will therefore also observe its material surroundings: the passe-partout. This passe-partout is the craquelure of an old photograph, the white between the caption and the image, the air between the photographs as they are archived in a filing cabinet, the cinema between a reel of film with a documentary on the Indies and the projection of that film on screen, the staircase and the corridors of the institute that reproduced the 1904 photographs in a book, and what is in between the 34 In The Truth in Painting, Derrida writes about the passe-partout: “One space remains to be broached… Neither inside nor outside, it spaces itself without letting itself be framed but it does not stand outside the frame. It works the frame, makes it work, lets it work, gives it work to do… Between the outside and the inside, between the external and the internal edge-line, the framer and the framed, the figure on the ground, form and content, signifier and signified, and so on for any two-faced opposition” (11-12).\n\n36\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nparts into which the perceptible is divided. It is exactly these spaces that produce meaning, for as art historian Rosalind Krauss writes: spacing is not an exteriority that signals the outside boundaries of meaning: one signified’s end before another’s onset. Rather, spacing… is the precondition of meaning as such, and the outsideness of spacing is revealed as already constituting the condition of the ‘inside’. (1985: 106)35\n\nSpacing makes visible the passe-partout: the white and the air between signifiers that make meaning possible. This moment, Butler holds, has a critical dimension, for it is “when a frame breaks with itself… that takenfor-granted reality is called into question” (2009: 12). This is the position of the 1904 photographs: alternating between silence and sound, between semanticization and cultural aphasia when there is a confrontation with their passe-partout. The mediated memories of the 1904 photographs can therefore be described as emerging memories: whereas Ann Rigney (2008b) has argued that memory sites only stay alive as long as people invest them with meaning, this study seeks to conceptualize those sites of memory that have become icons of both memory and forgetting. The notion of e-merging has a comparable ambiguity as for-getting, for it means “un-dipping” or “un-sinking”. One of the meanings of the verb “to emerge” in the Oxford English Dictionary is “to come up out of a liquid in which (the subject) has been immersed”: things can only emerge if they are first immersed. The present participle emerging indicates the continuity and repetitiveness of the process. The difficulty in the Netherlands to find a frame that was considered appropriate for these images, leading to an inability to put the photographs into language, will be addressed in this study through the concept of “cultural aphasia”. Contrary to ideas about a “colonial amnesia” which supposedly prevented France from talking about colonialism for a number of decades, Ann Laura Stoler has suggested the concept of “colonial aphasia”. In neurolinguistics, aphasia is a cover term referring to a number of acquired language disorders due to cerebral lesion which leads to the affliction of comprehension and production in the oral and written modalities (Bussmann 1996: 27). Stoler transposes this concept from the medical to the social scene: not to pathologize historical loss as an organic cognitive deficit but rather to emphasize two features: that it is not so much a loss of memory, but an 35 Krauss follows the lead of Derrida 1976.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n37\n\nocclusion of knowledge that is at issue. Aphasia is rather a dismembering, a difficulty speaking, a difficulty generating a vocabulary that associates appropriate words and concepts to appropriate things. Aphasia in its many forms describes a difficulty retrieving an available vocabulary, and most importantly, a difficulty comprehending what is spoken. (2009a; see also 2011)\n\nAphasia in culture studies can be traced back to the pioneering work of linguist and literary theorist Roman Jakobson in what we now call “linguistic aphasiology” (Tesak & Code 2008: 179-90). Building on the linguistic work of Ferdinand de Saussure, Jakobson described two types of linguistic difficulty caused by aphasia: the similarity and the contiguity disorder: “The former affliction involves a deterioration of metalinguistic operations, while the latter damages the capacity for maintaining the hierarchy of linguistic units… Metaphor is alien to the similarity disorder, and metonymy to the contiguity disorder.” (1971b: 254). For patients suffering from a similarity disorder, problems lie in choosing the right word when the context offers little help: they lack paradigmatic capacity and the ability to link metaphorically. Jakobson gives the example of a patient saying “I can hear you dead plain but I cannot get what you say… I hear your voice but not the words… It does not pronounce itself” (249). When another patient was shown a picture of a compass, he said he knew what it was, but could not come up with the represented object’s name. According to Jakobson, the problem for this patient was that “a verbal sign [was] supplanted for a pictorial sign” (247). Patients suffering from a contiguity disorder, on the other hand, are affected by a condition that “diminishes the extent and variety of sentences” (251). The examples Jakobson gives are of people with “medical” aphasia. But not finding a common vocabulary, not retrieving a certain word, or not being able to connect things to each other (grammatically or logically) happens to every speaker for whom certain frames are not available. This lack of a frame leads, according to Stoler, to “the irretrievability of a vocabulary, a limited access to it, a simultaneous presence of a thing and its absence, a presence and the misrecognition of it”. In the case of emerging memory, cultural aphasia can be caused by both a lack and an excess of frames: in the case of both the unavailability of language and of conflicting frames of interpretation, confusion can arise about the meanings of the 1904 photographs and whether they have been part of cultural memory in the first place, leading to them being discovered again and again.\n\n38\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nA Lack of Interest? Framing and cultural aphasia can help put an often drawn conclusion into perspective, namely that the Dutch were not interested in their colonies and are not interested in colonial memory and that this is the reason that information on the colonial period is unevenly distributed.36 Historical records prove the fallacy of the idea of a lack of Dutch interest in colonialism. During the period in which the Dutch subjugated the islands of the Indies (1870-1914), for instance, there were several discursively produced moments (e.g. during the “struggle” over the island of Lombok in 1894, and the “betrayal” of Atjehnese ally Teukoe Oemar in 1896) in which “the Netherlands fell under the spell of unprecedented nationalistic sentiments” (Van den Doel 1996: 126).37 Susan Legêne writes that the Colonial Museum (Koloniaal Museum) in Haarlem, which opened its doors in 1871, “can be regarded as the direct expression of the economic interest of the Dutch colonial elite at a time when colonialism was widely accepted and had become an inherent part of Dutch national identity” (2002: 638). A survey from December 1948 about the military operations the Dutch were undertaking to prevent Indonesia’s independence showed that 62% of the Dutch were in favor, 19% opposed, while 19% had no opinion (Locher-Scholten 1994a). Also later on, colonial affairs swayed Dutch national politics and public debate, for instance around the transfer of New Guinea – the last Dutch colony in the East – to Indonesia in 1962; the 1969 Hueting affair; the Moluccan actions in the 1970s; the question raised in 1994 whether a deserter from the Dutch colonial army, Poncke Princen, should receive a visa or not (see Houben 1997); the debate following the disclosure in 1998 of the excessive violence used in the Atjeh War under the command of Hendrik Colijn, who later became Prime Minister;38 or the debate in recent years around the Javanese village of Rawagedeh, which was massacred in 1947. When this book was defended as a PhD thesis, five Dutch national newspapers (Nederlands Dagblad, Reformatorisch Dagblad, De Telegraaf, Trouw, and de Volkskrant) and several national public radio stations reported on it. Vincent Houben wrote in 1997: “What stands out is that Holland’s colonial past, the period 1945-1949 in particular, is as much taboo today as it was earlier” (64). Silences, in other words, do not always point to absences. 36 See for example Kennedy 1995 and Blokker 1997. For a comparable argument, see Raben 2012. 37 See also Van Goor 1986; Van ’t Veer 1969. 38 See Langeveld 1998-2004; Eickhoff, Henkes and Van Vree 2010.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n39\n\nThe idea of a disinterest in colonialism, moreover, puts the Dutch in a position of standing outside their own colonial history. This is false not only because the Dutch actually colonized other lands (separating colonizing Dutch from those who stayed “at home” is simply turning a blind eye), but also because today the Netherlands is at all levels a country situated in a world where the effects of colonialism are profound. The word “interest” comes from “inter esse”, which means “being in the middle”, and the Dutch, like most people, live in a world thoroughly shaped by European colonialism. Remco Raben writes that “colonialism was seldom experienced as an indispensable daily reality” but also that “the most important contribution of colonialism was (and is), except materially, the conviction that the West was (and is) the source of all progress” (2007: 1227; emphasis added). This means that even if people found themselves uninterested in colonial matters, these were still of vital importance to the formation of national identity. What happened was that people did not always have language available to directly address this history and legacy. Frames, like Foucauldian discourses, should first of all be seen as productive, not as restrictive: they enable as much as they limit thought. Instead of looking for limitations, we should, as Foucault writes, search “for instances of discursive production (which also administer silences, to be sure)” (1998: 12). Sounds and silences should not be seen as standing in a binary opposition, for as Foucault writes: [silence is] an element that functions alongside the things said, with them and in relation to them within over-all strategies. There is no binary division to be made between what one says and what one does not say; we must try to determine the different ways of not saying such things, how those who can and those who cannot speak of them are distributed, which type of discourse is authorized, or which form of discretion is required in either case. (ibid: 27)\n\nThis means that we should not look upon the first decades after decolonization, for instance, when there was relative silence in the Netherlands concerning the colonial period, as a time characterized by a lack of interest, but rather, as Susan Legêne has pointed out, as a time marked by “a deeply felt crisis in thinking about the Dutch nation” (2009: 239).39\n\n39 On silences in Dutch colonial memory, see also Captain 2002; Scagliola 2002.\n\n40\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nOverview In both the academic and the broader social scene, this study seeks to change thinking about memory and forgetting. It does so in two ways: by interrogating the logic of dominant accounts of memory and forgetting – a logic I see defined by a binary opposition between these two terms – and by moving away from a perspective on cultural memory in which specific groups in society cover up (undesirable) aspects of the past which then have to be unveiled to become visible and memorable. Conspiracies exist, but the case of the 1904 photographs is not one of them. Rather than looking for intentions, this study emphasizes how the production of cultural memory is dependent on discourses that are beyond the reach of individual actors, making it impossible for certain memories to become shared, as they do not fit existing distributions of the perceptible. The photographs have been given meanings by various mnemonic communities, the most important of which are the Dutch communities in the Indies, various groups of migrants in the Netherlands from the former Indies, and the Dutch as a group of people produced by nationalist discourse. The analysis of the ways in which these images have been used within this latter, national framework provides insight into how the Netherlands has remembered the violence committed in colonial Indonesia. What this study shows is that an analysis of the framing of these portable monuments is just as revealing when they are put into discourse as when they prove to be hard to semanticize. The basic question asked by all the photographs’ observers within the national framework – “Is what these images depict Dutch?” – has not only led to, on the one hand, strategies of denial and compartmentalization (see chapter 3) and, on the other hand, an incorporation of these images into larger critiques of colonialism (see chapter 4), but also induced moments of cultural aphasia. While the persistence of their presence in the Dutch public sphere is an indication that these images produce affective responses in their observers that make it hard for them to ignore these photographs, the difficulties in naming what these images depict also points towards their sustained uncomfortable position in Dutch cultural memory as well as a continuous uncertainty about what it means to be Dutch. One crucial finding of this study is that the position of these photographs within the Netherlands can be characterized not by their regularly claimed absence but by their continuous probing of established national self-conceptions. Emerging memories arise when there is a lack of language in a community to give meaning to a particular site, leading to a recurring series\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n41\n\nof events. First, such a site is discovered and semanticized as overlooked or neglected; next, different groups within the mnemonic community, using different frames of semanticization, give conflicting meanings to the site; and finally the site disappears from everyday public debate, after which a new discovery can be made and the cycle starts anew. There is, as it were, a periodical return to the scene of the crime without it ever being solved. Whereas, for instance, Bloody Sunday is a contested site of memory that is not discussed in terms of amnesia, Dutch colonial violence is a site that regularly emerges and submerges again, in the same way as German suffering during the Second World War40 or the fact that Algerian soldiers fought on the French side during that same war. 41 Emerging memory can be seen as a special type of contested memory, for not all contested pasts are regularly semanticized as “forgotten”. 42 This study is structured chronologically, beginning with the production of the photographs in 1904 and ending with their position in Dutch cultural memory in recent years. Chapter 1 discusses the production and f irst semanticizations of the 1904 photographs, which both took place within the social frame of the Dutch colonial army. Chapter 2 examines the social biography of the 1904 photographs during the colonial period in the Indies and the Netherlands (1904-1942) and discusses the anxieties and strategies of denial that the images elicited. Chapter 3 analyzes the Atjeh photographs as they were compartmentalized in Dutch postcolonial nostalgia and became sites of multidirectional memory in Dutch national history in the period 1942-1966. Chapter 4, finally, makes clear how in the postcolonial Netherlands after 1966 the photographs increasingly became focal points where discussions on the Dutch colonial past converged and how they became portable monuments of remembrance and amnesia.\n\n40 See Röger 2009. 41 See Rosello 2010, pp. 109-13. 42 For the concept of “contested pasts”, see Hodgkin and Radstone 2003.\n\n1\n\nImperial Frames, 1904\n\nIntroduction This chapter discusses the production of the 1904 photographs and the first frames which semanticized them. The distribution of the perceptible within which they were produced and first given a meaning was that of the Royal Dutch-Indisch Army (KNIL), and accordingly this chapter will primarily observe the photographs from the army’s perspective. What the army, concretely, produced were eight photographs of atrocity (i.e. photographs which depicted the corpses of Gajo and Alas villagers) as part of a larger photographic project during the expedition which yielded 173 photographs. In terms of imagetexts it made a list of captions which it sent along with the photographs to the Royal Batavian Society for Arts and Sciences (Koninklijk Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen) – a highly esteemed and very influential ethnological institute located in the colonial capital Batavia that covered ethnological, linguistic, archaeological and historical research and collections – as well as a number of narrative texts on the expedition by officers who had participated in it, several of which address the photographs and their production. 43 The photographs were reproduced and donated to several institutes, next to the already mentioned Royal Batavian Society also to the Royal Military Academy (Koninklijke Militaire Academie) in Breda, the Museum of Ethnology in Rotterdam (Museum voor Land- en Volkenkunde, now Wereldmuseum), and the National Museum of Ethnology (Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, now Museum Volkenkunde) in Leiden. 44 In this study, the eight photographs of atrocity are coded so that they can be more easily traced: TT, PE, KR1, KR2, KR3, KL1, KL2, and KL3. Each acronym denotes a massacred Gajo or Alas village: Tjané Oekön-Toenggöl (TT), Pènòsan (PE), Koetö Réh (KR1, KR2, and KR3), and Koetö Lengat Baroe (KL1, KL2, and KL3). Although the production of the photographs was already mentioned in a newspaper article in the Deli Courant from June 1904 (see chapter 2), their first physical public appearance was on 5-12 February 1905, when they were exhibited 43 The narrative texts include the military report Van Daalen 1905 by commander G. C. E. van Daalen; the medical report Neeb 1905 by medical officer and maker of the photographs H. M. Neeb; the book Kempees 1905 by lieutenant J. C. J. Kempees; and a number of fragments from diaries by lieutenant J. W. Ebbink (quoted in Zentgraaff 1936: 197), and lieutenant-surveyor G. E. Hoedt (quoted in Zentgraaff 1936: 196-7). On the Royal Batavian Society, see Groot 2009. 44 See Stevens 2007; Groeneveld 2001.\n\n44\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nin Batavia. 45 The first appearance of some of the photographs (namely TT, PE, and KR2) in a publication was in a 1905 book on the expedition by lieutenant J. C. J. Kempees. 46 I have gathered a list of where the photographs can be – or were – found, or where they were discussed or transmediated (see pp. 247-251). As Susan Legêne argues, it was impossible in the Indies in the nineteenth century to think outside colonial discourse. This was still the case for the KNIL in 1904 (2005: 134; see also Said 2003: 240). The physical and the imagetextual frames of the photographs that the army produced were all conditioned by an imperial distribution of the perceptible, i.e. the implicit law conditioning a perceptible order in which the European power of the Netherlands was positioned as the future subjugator and ruler of all the islands of the Indonesian archipelago. Because of this framing by imperial discourse, this chapter is called “Imperial Frames”. 47 One of the consequences of this imperial framing was that for the army, the massacres had only one meaning: they were an inevitable step in the greater imperial project in which it was participating. 48 The army could not frame the 1904 photographs outside imperial discourse, which was the only frame it had at its disposal: it did not have language available to discuss the massacres in any other way. It was only later, in the confrontation with other frames of semanticization, that the passe-partout of the photographs became visible and multiple meanings started to emerge, making the photographs contested and emerging potable monuments. This chapter starts with a narrative overview of the 1904 expedition on the basis of the writings of several of the officers who took part in it as well as a positioning of the expedition within the Atjeh War. Next, I will offer a close visual analysis of two of the 1904 photographs. The photographs will be connected to two pictorial genres (that of the captured local leader and that of the imperial massacre) to show that they were part of a larger visual culture in which these images did not disturb the distribution of the perceptible. Finally, I will discuss how the army semanticized the photographs.

C. J. Kempees, 82 years old, would be celebrating the fact that he was given a high military honor fifty years ago for brave behavior during the Atjeh War. 47 As indicated above, I use the term “imperial” when focusing on the expansionist aspects of the Dutch colonial empire. 48 See Groen 2002 on the normalization within Dutch colonial army circles of this type of violence.\n\nImperial Fr ames, 1904\n\n45\n\nwill become clear in the course of this chapter is that the cultural aphasia and present absentness that are so characteristic of the social biography of the 1904 photographs in the Netherlands were not yet present within the imperial frames of colonial army circles. The army in the Indies, at least in this case, did not search for words: it either recognized the things it observed as belonging to the only world it perceived as possible, or it violently adjusted reality to meet the imperial perceptible order it envisioned. Operational closure is all that is to be found in the army’s documents.\n\nThe 1904 Expedition and the Atjeh War The expedition to the Gajo and Alas lands took place from 8 February to 23 July 1904 under the military command of the Dutch lieutenant-colonel G. C. E. van Daalen. In 1905, Van Daalen published an extensive military report on the expedition, structured day by day as a diary, and with meticulous mappings of the route that was taken and of all the fortified villages that were attacked. A second important source is the 1905 book by Kempees. 49 During the expedition, two groups of fortified villages were attacked and their inhabitants massacred: one in Gajo-Loeös, part of the Gajo land, and one in the Alas land. In 1904, both areas had been declared part of the government of Atjeh and Dependencies, while their conquest took in the last phase of the Atjeh War. The Atjeh War had started in 1873, when a first expedition of the Dutch was fought off by Atjehnese resistance.50 In 1874, the Dutch misread the political situation in Atjeh, thinking that their conquest of the palace of the sultan meant that Atjeh had been subjugated. The sultan, in fact, had little political power outside his kraton (palace). In 1879, Dutch troops devastated large parts of Atjeh, killing thousands of people and burning 400 to 500 villages to the ground. In 1880, victory was declared for the second time but once again too soon, as the Atjehnese guerilla war only intensified. In 1884, the Dutch created a “concentrated line” of forts around the town of Koetaradja and retreated behind it, waiting for better times which did not come. In the 1890s, the tide started turning for the Dutch. First, the Orientalist Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje published a book in 1892, The Atjehnese, explaining the social and political structures in Atjeh as well 49 Detailed information on the Gajo and Alas societies in the early twentieth century can be found in Bowen 1991 and Iwabuchi 1994. 50 On the Atjeh War, see Van ’t Veer 1969; Reid 1969; Reid 1979; Siegel 2000.\n\n46\n\nEmerging Memory\n\nas who needed to be targeted if the area was to be subjugated. Also in 1892, Major J. B. van Heutsz wrote an article in which he forcefully argued for the establishment of a counter-guerilla army that could move around quickly and effectively fight the enemy. In 1898, Van Heutsz got his chance when he was appointed governor of Atjeh. Snouck Hurgronje became his personal adviser, and with the Corps Marechaussee – crack troops of the KNIL specially trained for counter-guerilla operations during the Atjeh War – at his disposal, Van Heutsz started systematically subjugating the territories of Atjeh. Local leaders were forced to sign documents in which they accepted Dutch authority, and every “pacified” area was placed under civilian supervision, overseen by military officers. In 1904, the Gajo and Alas lands were one of the few independent areas left and had in the eyes of the Dutch become the new center of the Atjehnese resistance, leading Van Heutsz to send Van Daalen with ten regiments of the marechaussee to subjugate them. At the beginning of the expedition, Van Daalen’s troops numbered about 200 soldiers and officers of the marechaussee and 433 forced laborers. All of the soldiers were natives; they were recruited in Ambon and other islands of the Moluccas, North Celebes (Menado), and Java. All of their superior officers were Europeans (Bossenbroek 1992: 209-10).51 The forced laborers were mostly Javanese who were convicted; they had to carry equipment. During the expedition, about twenty-five soldiers were killed or died of wounds or diseases, while fourteen forced laborers died. As mentioned above, 173 photographs were produced during the expedition, taken by medical officer H. M. Neeb. Before arriving in Gajo-Loeös, the troops first marched through other areas of Atjeh and the Gajo land. Van Daalen writes about arrests made, fines levied (e.g. paid in the form of a number of water buffalos), village leaders who did or did not report when ordered to do so, the purchasing of rice and other materials from the population, and villages that were cleared so that the soldiers could make a bivouac. The differences between Van Daalen’s report and Kempees’s book are sometimes illumin"
