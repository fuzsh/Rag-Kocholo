I Am Curious (Blue), whose original Swedish title, Jag är nyfiken – en film i blått, translates as I Am Curious – A Film in Blue, is a 1968 Swedish film directed by Vilgot Sjöman and starring Lena Nyman as a character named after herself. It is a companion film to 1967's I Am Curious (Yellow); the two were initially intended to be one 3½ hour film.[1] The films are named after the colours of the Swedish flag.

Blue is a second version of Yellow, taking place before and after the first movie. It has a more somber and bitterly satiric style, and a further explication of the framing narrative.
