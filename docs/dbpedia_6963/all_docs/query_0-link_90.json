She experiments with relationships, political activism, and meditation. Meanwhile, the actors, director and crew are shown in a humorous parallel plot about the making of the film and their reactions to the story and each other. Nudity, explicit sex, and controversial politics kept this film from being shown in the US while its seizure by Customs was appealed.",

        "text": "CHASE THE RAINBOW\n\nRound 2 - Yellow\n\nWhat I thought might be a Swedish Lolita is weighed down by a lot of blatant activism and socialist commentary. If you're there for the erotic elements, don't come without a remote in that other hand for fast forwarding purposes.\n\nIt's interesting to see a snapshot of the swinging sixties in Sweden and to see a foreign perspective on the war in Vietnam.\n\nIn high school we were forced to watch a very vivid Scandinavian porno cartoon in our Sex Ed class, so I found this tame in comparison given my expectations.\n\nIf you stick around for it, the second half is much tighter and emotive than the slogging first of it... A couple of scenes towards the end are truly great if you don't get off before then.\n\nBanned on release in the US, this entirely unsexy Swedish moment in time feels like a Godard film with all the Godard taken out. Like an alcohol-free beer or a Tofu vindaloo, it just doesn't have the same twang as the product from which it was so clearly based.\n\nTelling the story of Lena and her search for enlightenment in a world engulfed by the social dramas of a sexual revolution in Sweden, I Am Curious does exactly what it says on the tin.\n\nAlso released in a modified 'Blue' version, these films take the colours of the Swedish flag as their theme. For a more rounded flag-based series with better acting, more engaging storylines and, erm, Juliette Binoche, I'd recommend Krzysztof Kieślowski's Trois couleurs trilogy.\n\nThe film opens with Director Vilgot Sjöman and his lover Lena Nyman a theater student wanting to make a film on social issues.\n\nAs the movie within the movie starts we see Lena conducting interviews on Is there a class system in Sweden? , Gender equality, conscientious objection and Franco's Spain. She starts an love affair with Börje who already has a lover and a daughter. After learning this Lena travels to a remote place where she tries to live on the minimal requirements to survival. But Börje comes finding her and they resume the affair. But Lena's curiosity about Börje lovers starts a fight between them and she leaves the place.\n\nIf you have see the early new wave…\n\nEver since the episode of \"Mad Men\" where Don Draper and Megan saw this film, I had become increasingly curious about it. Their reactions where what made me want to watch it, for how different they were.\n\nWell, now I've seen it. What can I say? It is not as shocking as I was expecting it to be. There is nudity and sex, but nothing that modern audiences had never seen. It is very experiemental in nature, mixing a fictional narrative with an also fictional but very lifelike story of the director and the making of the film. The second element is what I enjoyed the most, the story was by no means one that had a lot of impact on me. It was a story of self-discovery and growth that can sometimes get stuck on its own thoughts of achieving something else other than what it actually does.\n\nbasically a \"porn parody\" of a godard movie, which interests me both because it took something so stringently avant-garde to break thru american censorship laws, & because this also crossed over to the us mainstream in a way that totally eluded JLG as a result, smuggling along a fairly nuanced socialist message with it. the quality of the picture itself almost seems secondary to its subversive value as samizdat. pretty punk rock any way you slice it.\n\nrecommended by \"cliffin boothantino\""
