Directed by Vilgot Sjöman • 1967 • Sweden

A parallel film to Vilgot Sjöman's controversial I AM CURIOUS, YELLOW, I AM CURIOUS, BLUE also follows young Lena on her journey of self-discovery. In BLUE, Lena confronts issues of religion, sexuality, and the prison system, while at the same time exploring her own personal relationships. Like YELLOW, BLUE freely traverses the lines between fact and fiction, employing a mix of dramatic and documentary techniques.
