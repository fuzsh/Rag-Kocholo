The same movie with the same characters, cast and crew as I am Curious (Yellow), but with some different scenes and a different political slant. The political focus in Blue is personal relationships, religion, prisons and sex. Blue omits much of the class consciousness and non-violence interviews of the first version. Yellow and Blue are the colors of the Swedish flag.—Maple-2

A companion piece to Ich bin neugierig (gelb) (1967), with some answers missing in this film filled in by "Yellow"/"gult". Forty-two year old filmmaker Vilgot Sjöman is making a movie with twenty-two year old drama student and his sometimes sexual partner Lena Nyman. Under the guise of the "Nyman Institute", Lena surveys a broad spectrum of Swedes on issues including sex, sexual pursuit, the class system in Sweden and the role of meritocracy in it, the prison system, and religion in her quest for social justice. Having grown up with her divorced father, Vilgot sends her on a quest for her long lost mother, who Lena has heard has remarried with a young son who she's obviously never met. That quest turns into a further want for social justice and a sexual awakening in meeting others along the way. This trip takes her away from who is her new love, Börje Ahlstedt, Vilgot telling the real life Börje that there will consequences to their sexual union.—Huggo
