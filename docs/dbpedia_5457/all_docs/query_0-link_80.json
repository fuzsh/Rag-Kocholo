        "text": "Amy Eddings hosts Morning Edition on WCPN. Grant Segall/The Plain Dealer\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Amy Eddings hosts Morning Edition on WCPN 90.3-FM and creates The Downtowner podcast with George Hahn for Ideastream. She grew up in Brunswick, hosted All Things Considered in New York City, and ran a B&B in rural Ada, Ohio before joining WCPN early last year.\n\nAmy Eddings and George Hahn produce The Downtowner podcast for Ideastream. Drew Maziasz/Ideastream.\n\nCleveland creds: Raised in Brunswick,\n\nCurrently lives: Warehouse District\n\nAge: 55\n\nSchooling: Brunswick High, bachelor's from Ohio State, master's New York University\n\nFamily: Husband, Mark Hilan\n\nFavorite locally owned restaurants and cafes: Town Hall, Rising Star, Phoenix Coffee\n\nCompared to her old Manhattan, Amy Eddings finds that Cleveland's sidewalks are lively but not crammed.\n\nHow’s it feel to be on the air again?\n\nAmy: It feels great to be back in public radio. The moment I walked into the station, I felt like I was at home.\n\nWhat’s Morning Edition about?\n\nAmy: It's a news magazine created by National Public Radio with local cutaways, in radio parlance, for news, weather and traffic. I love communicating with people and being back in an urban environment, especially Cleveland, with all its renewed energy and pride.\n\nWhat’s it like broadcasting at 5 a.m.?\n\nAmy: I get up at 3:15. I bicycle to work. The first six months, I was falling asleep during haircuts. Now it's fine.\n\nThe Downtowner podcast explores Cleveland's comeback. Photo courtesy of Ideastream\n\nWhat’s the Downtowner podcast about?\n\nAmy: We highlight the downtown revival, ask questions about what's happening and where it's going and what it means.\n\nTell us about some episodes.\n\nAmy: I really enjoyed learning from Cleveland State historian Mark Souther. He wrote a great book called, \"Believing in Cleveland,\" with a historical perspective on Cleveland's various attempts to promote civic pride.\n\nMy local heroes are Chico Lewis and Roger Lowe, who run a needle exchange program [for Circle Health Services, known as the Free Clinic]. I talked to them about the opioid crisis.\n\nIt’s surprising to us the number of surface parking lots downtown. We hope to do an episode on why things were taken down and why those lots haven’t been developed. There’s one right across from the Renaissance.\n\nIt surprises me that there’s so much vacant space in Cleveland. In New York, when the World Trade towers came down, part of what was so stunning was the open space.\n\nWhat’s Ideastream, anyway?\n\nAmy: It's a consolidation of eight programs and services. They include our station; 104.9 WCLV, Cleveland's classical music station; the Public Broadcasting System's WVIZ, with public TV channels and training in education. We also manage the Ohio Channel, a public affairs channel; the Statehouse News Bureau for Ohio public broadcasting; North Ohio Technology Association, an interactive learning network for local schools; and a development program for teachers called SMART: Science and Math Achievement Required for Tomorrow.\n\nThe Downtowner podcast explores Cleveland's struggles to believe in itself. Amy Eddings/Ideastream.\n\nTell us about growing up and getting into radio.\n\nAmy: I went to Brunswick High and Ohio State. My longest, best job was WNYC radio. I started off as an environmental reporter focusing on garbage. I was known as the garbage lady.\n\nMy husband, Mark Hilan, was the Morning Edition anchor there for a long time. I was brought in as a sub when he went on vacation. Later, I became the host of National Public Radio’s All Things Considered there.\n\nMeet any celebrities in New York?\n\nAmy: As a cub reporter covering Mayor Giuliani, I was so nervous about getting my question right that I read it off a piece of paper. He noticed, and said so. I turned bright red.\n\nCourtney Love came through the newsroom to use the bathroom. She had a cigarette there. Her assistant was knocking at the door: “Courtney, come on.”\n\nI once asked Alec Baldwin a question. “Amy Eddings! I listen to you on the radio!” he said.\n\n“Alec Baldwin!” I said, not missing a beat. “I watch you on TV!”\n\nFor The Downtowner, George Hahn interviews Jonathan Whigham, president of the Downtown Residents Association.\n\nWhat brought you back to Ohio?\n\nAmy: My husband's mom and sister had died. I saw what he went through, flying back and forth to Chicago. I thought I'd better get back to Ohio to be around my folks. My dad ended up dying this April.\n\nWe’d been visiting my sister for more than a decade in this little town called Ada, 130 miles from here. We turned a beautiful house there into a B&B. We met great people, mostly families coming through for their child’s graduation from Ohio Northern University. We’d have graduation parties.\n\nThe only coffee in Ada is McDonald’s. Rising Star would ship coffee to us from Cleveland.\n\nI also worked about a year and a half at the Lima News. I covered the KitchenAid factory down in Greenville, a chocolate maker in Piqua, a tour of Amish country in Hardin County.\n\nWhen you joined WCPN, where’d you stay?\n\nAmy: I stayed in my parents' basement in Avon at first. Then George Hahn spoke so highly of his building that we looked and got a unit there.\n\nMark joined me here in July. We had to sunset the B&B. It wasn’t as much fun for Mark to do it all by himself, and it was getting hard for me to work Monday through Friday here, then go home and serve guests Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAmy Eddings wonders why the downtown trolley is sometimes empty. Photo by Amy Eddings/Ideastream.\n\nDo you run into a lot of high school friends?\n\nAmy: Former classmates have looked me up, and we've gotten together for coffee. But, in terms of bumping into them, no.\n\nIn New York, you walked down the street and bumped into somebody you knew from Ohio State. And George, who grew up in Lakewood, runs into people he knows all the time here.\n\nOther differences between the coast and the heartland?\n\nAmy: People's lives here are structured around high school football. In New York City, high schools are lucky if they even field football.\n\nAda is home to the Wilson football factory. Every January, the national media descend and talk about the football for the Super Bowl. I helped create, as a member of Ada’s Chamber of Commerce, the Wilson Football Festival.\n\nFor a downtown, Cleveland’s is pretty mellow. My husband would beg to differ on a Friday or Saturday night, when we can hear the music from the bars on West Sixth. But I don’t mind that. I think it’s part of the tradeoff of living in an entertainment district.\n\nIn New York City, getting from A to B is a series of hurdles. Cleveland moves at a more reasonable pace. At the same time, it has a lot of amenities: theaters, bars, coffee.\n\nIn New York, we pasted broadsides on every available space for bands, lost dogs, anything. For that here, I go to Rising Star. I found a woman who does Thai massage from a poster there.\n\nHow solid is Cleveland’s comeback?\n\nAmy: The revival's real. My mom used to be an operating room nurse at the Cleveland Clinic main campus. That area has completely transformed from the late '70s.\n\nCleveland isn’t the only city seeing renewed interest in its core. It’s a trend across the United States.\n\nCleveland has had many, many comebacks. It’s tried to encourage everybody to be up with Cleveland. Why are we so unconfident or skeptical about Cleveland’s success?"
