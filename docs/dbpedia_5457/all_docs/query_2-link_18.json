The Board of Trustees of Youngstown State University is composed of 11 members who are appointed by the Governor of the State of Ohio, with the advice and consent of the State Senate. WYSU does not control the selection of the board members.\n\nAlthough WYSU as a university licensee is not required to have a Community Advisory Board, it does maintain a Community Advisory Council that meets two times per year. In FY 2023, the Community Advisory Council consists of 14 members. Of those, 7 are female; 7 are male; and 3 are racially diverse.\n\nIn FY2023 the WYSU staff consists of 5 full-time employees. Of those, 2 are white females, and 3 are white male. There are three part-time employees. Of those, 1 is an African-American male, and 2 are white males. WYSU also works with student employees who add additional age, race, and cultural diversity to station operations.\n\nYoungstown State University Policies and Procedures regarding Equal Employment Opportunity, Diversity and Workplace Environment\n\nYoungstown State University Notice of Non-Discrimination Policies\n\nYoungstown State University does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, disability, age, religion or veteran/military status in its programs or activities.\n\n3356-2-03 Discrimination/harassment: Establishes expectations for institutional and individual conduct, defines discrimination and harassment, aids the university community in recognizing and preventing discrimination and harassment, and provides effective reporting and response mechanisms.\n\n3356-2-05 Title IX Sexual Misconduct Policy: The policy establishes university compliance with the U.S. Department of Education’s new regulations on Title IX.\n\n3356-2-02 Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Recruitment and Employment: Establishes the University’s commitment to nondiscrimination, equal opportunity, and affirmative action in recruitment and employment.\n\n3356-7-04 Workplace and off-campus violence, threats, and disruptive behavior: Provides a process and procedure that delineates Youngstown State University’s commitment to providing a supportive work and learning environment that is safe, secure, and free from threats, intimidation, and violence.\n\n3356-7-20 Drug-free Environment: Establishes the University’s commitment to create and maintain an environment which sustains the general health and well-being of students, employees, and visitors and to comply with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989.\n\nEmployment Search Procedures and Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action\n\nIn order to comply with the equal opportunity requirement of The Communications Act, 89.7 and equal opportunity and affirmative action requirements established by the University, WYSU follows the search procedures established by the University when filling an open position:\n\nA posting is established through the Office of Human Resources. The posting includes the job description, duties, minimum and desired qualifications and a summary of the position.\n\nThe position is posted on-line through the Youngstown State University Job site and on various job sites, local newspapers, and other broadcasting publications that are specific to the position being advertised and those that have requested notifications of job opportunities.\n\nA Search Committee is established and completes on-line training in order to understand the relevant equal employment opportunity laws and University polices applicable to their actions; to evaluate applicants in an objective and consistent manner; and to recommend an applicant or applicants for hire/appointment.\n\nApplication materials are collected through the Youngstown State University's on-line application system.\n\nThe Office of Equal Opportunity and Policy Development (EOPD) monitors and approves the Search Committee’s actions to ensure compliance with applicable laws, and University policies and procedures for equal employment opportunity and affirmative action.\n\nOnce the search process has been approved for equal employment opportunity and affirmative action compliance, reference and background checks are completed.\n\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION AT WYSU-FM\n\nYOUNGSTOWN STATE UNIVERSITY\n\nAs a department of Youngstown State University, WYSU embraces and adheres to all the diversity goals, policies and procedures of Youngstown State University.\n\nWYSU GOAL\n\nWYSU’s diversity, equity and inclusion goal is to cultivate, promote, and preserve a welcoming culture of diversity, equity and inclusion throughout the entire organization and its operation. This culture extends to the station’s staff, advisory board, volunteers, listeners, as well as to the station’s programming and community outreach initiatives. WYSU endeavors to represent diverse perspectives in its programming and community activities.\n\nGENERAL INITIATIVES\n\nTo reflect and reinforce this goal, WYSU will:\n\nFoster, welcome, value, and promote diversity among staff, students, volunteers, and our community.\n\nProvide professional programs and trainings; educating WYSU’s management, professional staff, advisory board, students, and volunteers on the best practices for maintaining an inclusive and diverse environment for everyone.\n\nProvide programs with different cultural contexts to serve the educational and lifelong learning needs of our diverse community.\n\nDevelop the capacity to understand and address issues of difference, bias, power, and privilege.\n\nInclude diverse individuals in internships and student work experience positions.\n\nEnsure a diverse pool of applicants for employment, by following FCC/EEO and Youngstown State University guidelines regarding job posting and recruitment; utilize the resources and training materials available from Youngstown State University’s Offices of Human Resources and Equal Opportunity; and make use of local and network public radio resources to address outreach and diversity in all position searches.\n\nACTIONS\n\n1. Education and Training:\n\nTo educate and train WYSU employees on the important issues and consequences of workplace violence, discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct, staff members will complete the following educational/training courses annually:\n\nYoungstown State University Discrimination, Harassment, and Title IX Training\n\nOhio Ethics Law: Building a Culture of Integrity\n\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting Discrimination/Harassment & Title IX Training\n\n2. Programming and Community Outreach:\n\nWYSU is Continuously striving to enhance the diversity and inclusive scope of its programming. WYSU searches for and continues to add programs that focus on diverse topics and have hosts of diverse backgrounds. Some of those programs are: the news module Asian View, aired during Morning Edition; Latino USA; It’s Been a Minute; Snap Judgment; and recently added are: Open to Debate, a program that explores the extreme polarization of the nation; and On Shifting Ground with Ray Suarez.\n\nWYSU regularly inserts local interviews into network news programs that address local topics of special interest to diverse audiences. Recent topics include: Jesse McClain, Holocaust Education Specialist about International Holocaust Remembrance Day; Ken Schneck, professor at Baldwin Wallace University about Pride Month; Dr. Patrick Spearman of YSU about Juneteenth celebrations in the Mahoning Valley; Annie Tapp from YSU about new exercise programs for those suffering with Parkinson's disease; Susan Moorer, Assistant Direct of DEI at YSU; Paul Garchar, CEO of Potential Development School for Students with Autism.\n\nWYSU promotes lectures and events for diverse audiences on air and in the online Community Calendar. Recent examples include: YSU Hispanic Heritage Month Organizing Committee programs, YSU Africana Studies programs for Black History Month, Women’s History Month, events of the local Latino organization OCCHA, The Butler Institute of American Art: The Jewish Contribution to the Art of America, YSU Melnick Medical Museum & Youngstown Historical Center for Industry & Labor: Bridging the Health Gap for Hispanics in Our Community, YSU guest lecturers and musicians, local theater productions, as well as numerous other specific event requests that are submitted to the station.\n\nWYSU’s locally-hosted classical and jazz program hosts, and network hosts, make a special effort to incorporate music that reflects the contributions of all cultures, especially featuring Latin-American, African-American, LGBTQ+, and women composers and musicians. Women composers and musicians are also emphasized.\n\nWYSU provides opportunities for listeners to record and air commentaries on topics of interest to the community.\n\nWYSU actively participates in, supports, and frequently partners in community events of interest to diverse audiences.\n\nWYSU, in a partnership with Goodwill Industries, carries the Youngstown Radio Reading Service on its sideband. A small staff and over 100 volunteers read various materials for the sight impaired and those with other physical ailments like stroke and dyslexia.\n\n3. Operational Initiatives:\n\nWYSU funds, and promotes on-air, two broadcast/journalism scholarships for minority students. The annually-awarded WYSU-FM Broadcasting Scholarship helps to develop the next generation of broadcasters. Applicants must be a full time, traditional or non-traditional minority student, majoring in Telecommunications. WYSU-FM also established the Robert W. Peterson Scholarship, named for a former director of WYSU, which awards an annual scholarship to a second year minority student in English, Journalism, or Communications.\n\nRecent part-time and student additions have expanded the diversity of our workforce.\n\nWYSU works in conjunction with its licensee (Youngstown State University) to ensure that all WYSU facilities and its website are ADA compliant.\n\nFinancial Reports\n\nIn order to comply with open financial records requirements of The Communications Act of 1934, 89.7 WYSU, a service of Youngstown State University, provides the following reports made available for public inspection:\n\nWYSU's Annual Financial Report\n\nWYSU's Annual CPB Financial Report\n\nWYSU is not required to file an IRS Form 990. WYSU has no employees who meet the IRS definition of “highly compensated employees\" in Form 990, Section VII A and B. WYSU has no contractors who meet the definition of “highly compensated\" or are paid over $100,000.\n\nYou may request an accessible document version or hard copy of the PDFs above by contacting Gary Sexton.\n\nLOCAL CONTENT AND SERVICES REPORT TO CPB FY2023\n\nDescribe your overall goals and approach to address identified community issues, needs, and interests through your station’s vital local services, such as multiplatform long and short-form content, digital and in-person engagement, education services, community information, partnership support, and other activities, and audiences you reached or new audiences you engaged.\n\nWYSU-FM’s primary goal, that shapes all other goals, is to be a community leader that supports the fine and performing arts and educational resources that Youngstown State University and the region have to offer. WYSU addresses this goal by maintaining locally-hosted classical music programming; providing a robust public community calendar; sponsoring and organizing lectures and concerts; producing local programs related to the well-being of the community – Doing Good interviews, community issues interviews -- and also providing opportunities for citizen commentaries. WYSU offers informational resources on its website for state and national political events. The station also has established partnerships with local and regional news organizations to provide local and state news headlines on air throughout the day and post local stories on the website. In addition, WYSU provides unique student training opportunities as librarians, audio assistants, assistant engineers, production assistants, development assistants, and more. Everything WYSU does is with a focus on promoting life-long learning opportunities for the audience and for all constituents.\n\nWYSU also shares the mission of its licensee, Youngstown State University, and the following goals drawn from that mission also inform everything WYSU does.\n\n• being a key provider of informational programs to the region at large\n\n• fostering collaboration to enrich the region and the world\n\n• integrating teaching, learning, scholarship, and civic engagement\n\n• fostering understanding of diversity, sustainability, and global perspectives\n\n• advancing the intellectual and cultural life of the city, region, and world.\n\nWYSU has a vibrant partnership with The Business Journal, and ongoing relationships with the Statehouse News Bureau and The Ohio Newsroom. Statehouse News Bureau stories are regularly inserted in news headlines at the top of the hour, a local news segment produced by The Business Journal airs some days during All Things Considered, and a state news segment produced by The Ohio Newsroom airs daily during Morning Edition and also during All Things Considered.\n\nA local interview segment titled Doing Good airs weekly during Morning Edition and is designed to raise social consciousness and public awareness about significant concerns in our community, as well as to draw attention to the good work being done to address these issues. It has been a popular feature and brings many community leaders, YSU scholars, and local activists to the WYSU audience.\n\nOther local interviews that air during morning network news on a weekly basis are hosted by university English professor, Dr. Tim Francisco. The program features interviews with area residents, guest speakers, visiting artists, and YSU faculty involved in the arts, education, community research and development, and politics.\n\nIn addition, listeners can submit and record commentaries on subjects of interest to them and to the general audience. These commentaries are aired during the morning network news program.\n\nAll the above local programs are archived on the WYSU website for access at any time.\n\nAudience growth is measured, not only through traditional methods like the Nielsen rating survey, but also through advanced website and streaming metrics.\n\nWYSU thoroughly reviews the issues and programs process each quarter. Twelve to eighteen topics of community concern are addressed every quarter using a combination of local public affairs interviews strategically placed in network news magazines, single-themed network programs, and the network news magazines themselves.\n\nWYSU is beginning to physically re-connect with the community by again sponsoring and holding open events in order to meet listeners and obtain their feedback. WYSU has also resumed partnerships with other community organizations to bring in speakers, concerts, and other events for the benefit of the entire community, and to provide more engagement opportunities. These events had, of course, been moved to a virtual platform because of the pandemic.\n\nAn active presence is maintained on Facebook, where listeners can interact with WYSU and learn about station events. And finally, WYSU’s Community Advisory Board continues to be a reliable sounding board for WYSU initiatives, and a valuable source of community support.\n\nDescribe key initiatives and the variety of partners with whom you collaborated, including other public media outlets, community nonprofits, government agencies, educational institutions, the business community, teachers and parents, etc. This will illustrate the many ways you’re connected across the community and engaged with other important organizations in the area.\n\nWYSU continues to expand and enhance its on-line, interactive Community Calendar. Available to the public on the station’s website (wysu.org), the calendar concentrates on local university events, fine and performing arts events by local arts organizations, and other community service organization activities. The event sponsoring agency can enter their event data on the Calendar (subject to editing), which is available to anyone in the community. This Calendar is also the source for WYSU’s on-air public service announcements, providing these organizations with free media exposure, valued collectively at more than $40,000 over the course of a year. Continuing in 2023, a YSU student development employee continued a primary responsibility of finding and adding appropriate events to the calendar. The station’s community calendar is now more robust and informative than it has ever been. WYSU also actively shares pertinent community events (live and virtual) on the events page of the station's official Facebook page (which is followed on Facebook by more than 2,070 users).\n\nWYSU is also both a direct sponsor and a media sponsor for many community events (live and virtual).

In many cities and towns across the country, newspapers and television stations are becoming a dying breed. Because of this, it is crucial now more than ever to deliver important news and information to local and regional communities.\n\nAs the number of local media outlets continues to decline statewide, The Ohio Newsroom is committed to filling those information gaps and securing the funds needed to sustain into the future. The Ohio Newsroom mission and structure are the result of research and modeling funded by The George Gund Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for expanding local journalism in Ohio.\n\nEvery public radio station that broadcasts NPR in Ohio was invited to join The Ohio Newsroom, with the following Ohio-based stations signed on to both participate and contribute: WYSU, Cincinnati Public Radio (Cincinnati), Ideastream Public Media (Cleveland/Akron/Canton), WCSU (Wilberforce, Ohio), WGTE (Toledo), WOSU Public Media (Columbus), and WYSO (Yellow Springs).\n\nWYSU has been in a partnership with Goodwill Industries for over 40 years to carry the Youngstown Radio Reading Service on its sideband, providing a valuable service to sight-impaired members of the community.\n\nWYSU partners with its parent university, YSU, to hire and provide valuable workplace experience to YSU students. Students learn hands-on broadcast communication or computer science skills while producing high-quality station content or working on other station projects. This partnership is reciprocal as WYSU benefits from student work hours, and the community doubly benefits as students of the community gain valuable work experience, and the rest of the community benefits from the services the students help provide.\n\nWYSU is a critical link in the Emergency Alert System, a state and national warning system for severe weather and other disasters.\n\nThe station also maintains its own Disaster Response Program to better assist YSU and the region in the event of a widespread emergency.\n\nWhat impact did your key initiatives and partnerships have in your community? Describe any known measurable impact, such as increased awareness, learning or understanding about particular issues. Describe indicators of success, such as connecting people to needed resources or strengthening conversational ties across diverse neighborhoods. Did a partner see an increase in requests for related resources? Please include direct feedback from a partner(s) or from a person(s) served.\n\nWYSU-FM continues to be fully committed to undertaking initiatives and establishing partnerships that provide essential community services. Some of the services and community benefits facilitated by these partnerships are often beyond the scope of those traditionally associated with public radio stations.\n\nDan Kuzma, the Interim Manager of Youngstown State University (YSU) Building Services, and the person who oversees YSU's Recycling Program and the Mahoning Valley Materials Exchange program, comments on his department recently becoming a new sponsor of WYSU. \"It has always been challenging to market the YSU Recycling Program and the Mahoning Valley Materials Exchange. We were very fortunate recently to have an opportunity to work with WYSU to help us expand our outreach, not just to the wider campus community, but also to many business professionals in the Mahoning Valley. WYSU is an outstanding community partner, and we are very fortunate to have such a great local resource that is willing to help us achieve our goals. We look forward to continued partnership with WYSU as we grow and expand our various programs.\"\n\nThe Ohio Newsroom is one of WYSU's primary regional news partners. Here are some thoughts from Clare Roth, Managing Editor of The Ohio Newsroom, about the value of that partnership: \"The Ohio Newsroom is committed to addressing news deserts and making sure all Ohioans have access to quality news about their state and their community. WYSU is one of our most valuable partners in that mission. They help us reach an audience that has few other options for local news. They help connect us with important local news the rest of the state needs to hear, and they partner with us to connect their listeners to crucial news from around the state.\"\n\nJoseph K. DeSalvo, CHC, President of DeSalvo Construction in Hubbard, Ohio shared his thoughts about the value of underwriting on WYSU. \"DeSalvo Construction has been building commercial and industrial projects in Youngstown since 1984. Every time DeSalvo completes a job, we like to think we leave behind more than a professionally built structure. Our true lasting impact is what we represent to the community where we live and work, and WYSU provides the perfect link between DeSalvo and the community, keeping individuals informed on construction builds that will improve the Mahoning Valley.\"\n\nThese partnerships are just three examples of the hundreds of partnerships that WYSU has committed to over the station’s nearly 55-year history. All these partnerships illustrate the station’s devotion to its listeners, to the community at large, and to the general welfare of our entire region.\n\nAnother measurable impact of the value of WYSU’s initiatives and partnerships has been the continued growth and participation on social media platforms, particularly Facebook. Because WYSU’s Facebook page is a keyway for the station to publicize its initiatives and partnerships, the growth of WYSU’s Facebook community is an indication and measure of our constituents’ enhanced awareness, and of the impact its efforts and events have had upon constituents.\n\nOther success indicators are primarily anecdotal and include: partners who note the response to a story on WYSU; requests for information made available on the air, on the WYSU website, or on social media; and feedback from listeners who attend a WYSU sponsored event, or who visit the station.\n\nPlease describe any efforts (e.g. programming, production, engagement activities) you have made to investigate and/or meet the needs of minority and other diverse audiences (including, but not limited to, new immigrants, people for whom English is a second language and illiterate adults) during Fiscal Year 2023, and any plans you have made to meet the needs of these audiences during Fiscal Year 2024. If you regularly broadcast in a language other than English, please note the language broadcast.\n\nWYSU’s diversity, equity, and inclusion goal is to cultivate, promote, and preserve a welcoming culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout the entire organization and its operation. This culture extends to the station’s staff, advisory board, volunteers, listeners, as well as to the station’s programming and community outreach initiatives.\n\nWYSU is continually striving to enhance the diversity and inclusive scope of its programming by adding programs that explore diverse subject matter not always addressed on mainstream programs, that include a wide array of perspectives and opinions, and have hosts and feature guests who represent various cultural and ethnic groups.\n\nNPR anchor news programs Morning Edition and All Things Considered pay great attention to diversity in staff and subject matter. Many other network programs carried by WYSU do the same, including The World, Latino USA, It’s Been a Minute, and Snap Judgment, as well as Freakonomics Radio, The Ted Radio Hour, Radio Lab, and The New Yorker Radio Hour.\n\nClassical music has been a major format for the station since it first went on the air. Classical music has always been defined very broadly at WYSU, frequently crossing over into other music genres, and the music staff has gone much further in the past four years especially, looking to find and present classical music that reaches into the traditions of other cultures not traditionally represented in classical music, and trying to find common ground with other traditions. The weekend jazz programming is naturally very diverse and attracts an audience that appreciates that.\n\nThere are numerous other channels WYSU uses to reach out to diverse audiences.\n\nWYSU puts much emphasis in providing a generous amount of free public service announcements for events and programs for organizations such as the YSU Hispanic Heritage Month Organizing Committee, Black History Month at YSU, regional Juneteenth celebrations, Women’s History Month and other YSU Diversity programs, the Jewish Community Center, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, as well as other specific event requests that are submitted to the station.\n\nWYSU’s two local interview segments included the following people and topics:\n\nPaul Garchar, CEO of Potential Development (a school for students with autism)\n\nBonnie Burdman, Executive Director, Community Relations and Government Affairs at Youngstown Area Jewish Federation\n\nRev. Rose Carter about the organization A.C.T.I.O.N (The Alliance for Congregational Transformation Influencing Our Neighborhoods)\n\nAngelica Diaz, executive director of OCCHA (Organizacion Civica y Cultural Hispana Americana)\n\nMeri Fetkovich, Senior Director of Health and Wellness at the YMCA about the 'Live Strong' program\n\nDr. Patrick Spearman, Director of Africana Studies Program at YSU\n\nSusan Moorer, Assistant Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at YSU\n\nJesse McClain, Holocaust Education Specialist for the Youngstown Area Jewish Federation\n\nAna Torres, Chairwoman of the YSU Hispanic Heritage Planning Committee\n\nMelissa Bateman, Director of Community Engagement at the Youngstown Area Jewish Federation\n\nRev. Lew Macklin about the Juneteenth holiday\n\nLisa Long, Development Director of the Youngstown Area Jewish Federation\n\nDr. Nicolette Powe, associate professor of public health at Youngstown State University, who received a grant to improve health, prevent current diseases, and reduce health disparities among the African American and Hispanic populations in the Mahoning Valley.\n\nKen Schneck, professor at Baldwin Wallace University about Pride Month\n\nAlthough events have not completely rebounded from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, WYSU remains committed to expanding its active participation and support for university and community-based events of interest to diverse audiences.\n\nWYSU-FM continues to fund two minority broadcast/journalism scholarships. The annually awarded WYSU-FM Broadcasting Scholarship helps to develop the next generation of minority broadcasters. Applicants must be a full time, traditional or non-traditional minority student, majoring in Telecommunications. WYSU-FM also established the Robert W. Peterson Scholarship, named for a former director of WYSU, which awards an annual scholarship to a second-year minority student in English, Journalism, or Communications.\n\nFor more than 40 years, in a partnership with Goodwill Industries, WYSU has carried the Youngstown Radio Reading Service on its sideband. A small staff and over 100 volunteers read various materials for the sight impaired, and those with other physical ailments, like strokes and dyslexia. Listeners throughout the WYSU broadcast area receive this service using a specially tuned radio.\n\nWYSU works in conjunction with National Public Radio and its Grove website platform to ensure that the WYSU website is ADA compliant.\n\nFinally, with its news and information and cultural music programs, WYSU believes that all of its programming is a useful, informative, and entertaining resource for all members of the community.\n\nPlease assess the impact that your CPB funding had on your ability to serve your community. What were you able to do with your grant that you wouldn't be able to do if you didn't receive it?\n\nWYSU began broadcasting in October 1969 with the goal to offer the community high-quality arts and educational programming. This mission has only been possible due to the stability of the station’s four main funding sources: university support, membership, underwriting, and the CPB Community Service Grant (CSG). The station continues on the road to recovery from the pandemic, but not all the support pillars are as solid as they once were. Primarily because of a statewide trend in lower higher education enrollment, the amount of university support continues to be significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels, and the outlook isn’t positive for a return to that previous level, which directly impacts staffing levels. Underwriting support continues to slowly improve with the return of arts-related underwriting support, but substantial challenges remain, and new challenges are developing (i.e. the loss of large legacy station underwriters, the increasing popularity of targeted digital advertising, and the significant reduction of local and regional radio advertising in the market [which has resulted in a substantial reduction in the advertising rates charged by commercial radio stations]). The station development staff is doing its best to respond to these challenges. The amount of listener funding is mostly stable, but as has been the trend throughout much of non-profit fundraising, the number of donors has decreased, while those who remain give more. Thankfully, CPB CSG continues to provide steady support to the station.\n\nThe market WYSU serves will always be a challenging one. The Youngstown-Warren region has an aging population (the median age in the MSA is 44, compared to a national median age of 39), and WYSU has not been able to avoid that trend. Other demographic elements impacting audience growth include education attainment levels and poverty rates. The WYSU service area is notably lower than the national average in both these measures. Only 15% of the population of Youngstown holds a Bachelor's Degree or higher while the national average is just below 38%. Additional, the poverty rate in Youngstown is alarmingly high at 34.5%, and the population is also rapidly declining.\n\nDespite all this, the team at WYSU still believes in the importance of its educational, news, and arts programming for the area and its goal to make it accessible to all residents, regardless of income or education level. This is why the support CPB CSG provides to the station is more critical now than ever.\n\nLOCATION\n\n% BACHELOR’S DEGREE +\n\nPOVERTY RATE\n\nU.S. National Average\n\n37.7%\n\n11.5%\n\nOhio\n\n30.4%\n\n13.4%\n\nPennsylvania\n\n33.8%\n\n11.8%\n\nYoungstown City\n\n15.1%\n\n34.5%\n\nMahoning County, OH\n\n26.2%\n\n19.2%\n\nTrumbull County, OH\n\n20.0%\n\n16.2%\n\nColumbiana County, OH\n\n16.5%\n\n15.5%\n\nLawrence County, PA\n\n22.0%\n\n12.7%\n\nMercer County, PA\n\n24.1%\n\n12.5%"
