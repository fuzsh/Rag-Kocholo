        "text": "A packed house watched Drew Carey love Cleveland the way only a Clevelander can during a live taping of NPR's \"Wait Wait . . . Don't Tell Me\" at the State Theatre in Playhouse Square on Thursday.\n\nThe Cleveland comedian was the guest of honor for one segment of the funny news quiz show, engaging in a witty back-and-forth with host Peter Sagal, who said the \"Price Is Right\" host offers a terrific example of how to \"grow up in Cleveland, grow rich and famous and leave and not be a jerk about it.\" Still smarting from the success of the jerk in South Beach, fans ate it up.\n\nAfter some teasing about how Cleveland's sports teams don't achieve success, Carey said it all depends on how you define success. Sagal pressed him for his definition. \"The Browns are gonna be 8 and 8 this year!\" Carey said.\n\nCarey demonstrated the distinctly Cleveland trait of showing his abiding love for the city while exaggerating its flaws at the same time.\n\nAsked about beaches here, he replied: \"There's beaches, per se. They're kind of polluted. You don't want to go unless you love pink eye.\"\n\nAnd, he was asked, how does he make his home in L.A. a bit more Cleveland-like? Carey replied: \"I got a guy to come over and dump sludge in my pool.\"\n\nThe show will be aired at 11 a.m. today on WKSU FM/89.7 and at 2 p.m. Sunday on WCPN FM/90.3.\n\nCaught off camera: Residents of Cleveland's Edgewater neighborhood are so fed up with thefts in their well-to-do patch of the city that they installed security cameras on telephone poles throughout the neighborhood. Each pole also has a sign warning would-be copper gutter thieves and other miscreants that they're being watched.\n\nThe cameras haven't exactly caught a lot of exciting footage since being installed this spring. And when some real excitement happened Sunday, the camera was pointed in the opposite direction. A thief crashed his car into an SUV, then into a telephone pole on West 117th Street just north of Lake Avenue while being chased by police on Sunday. The pole was sheared off.\n\nThe camera atop the pole caught none of it, but it did record its own quick descent.\n\nThe driver had been accused of theft at the Target store on West 117th Street, well removed from bucolic Edgewater. That didn't seem to matter to the throng of residents who gathered at the scene. Neighbors helped chase down the suspect when he tried to run for it. Then the crowd clapped and chanted as the man was led away in cuffs.\n\n\"Not in our neighborhood!\" they shouted.\n\nDogged tradition: Cuyahoga County Council President C. Ellen Connally didn't sign her name when given the chance during the \"topping out\" ceremony of the medical mart and convention center building last week. She signed her dogs' names: \"Best Wishes from Roscoe, Lucky and Mugzy.\"\n\nWhen she was a Municipal Court judge, Connally often worked Roscoe, a Hungarian pointer, into her address to jurors during a jury trial. Roscoe died in 2007 at age 14.\n\nLucky, a Spaniel mix, was found at East 68th Street and Lexington Avenue three months before Roscoe died. Mugzy, a Boston terrier, also is a rescue dog.\n\nSeems appropriate. The ceremony last week was just a dog and pony show anyway.\n\nThe beam Connally and other dignitaries signed was \"ceremonial,\" and the event was made for TV. The real topping out happened Feb. 1, as noted on the medical mart website: \"Turner Construction recognized the completion of steel erection on the medical mart by hosting a traditional 'topping out' ceremony, hoisting the final steel beam to the top of the structure with a fir tree and an American flag affixed to the beam.\" A topping out ceremony indicates that a structure has reached its zenith with no loss of life.\n\nSeeing the future: Connally ought to be a contestant on \"Jeopardy!\" She seems to know the answers and questions before they're even asked.\n\nThis month, marking the bicentennial of the War of 1812 at a ceremony on the steps of the Lakeside Courthouse, Connally -- who is studying for an advanced degree in American history -- said, \"for all those future Jeopardy contestants,\" that the war was concluded in 1814 with the Treaty of Ghent.\n\nThat evening, the $1,600 question on Jeopardy in the category \"The War of 1812 Bicentennial\" was, \"Though fighting continued for several weeks, the Dec. 1814 Treaty of this Belgian city officially ended the war.\"\n\nGhent!\n\nKen Jennings, watch out.\n\nLaura Johnston contributed.\n\nTo reach Michael K.
