He also serves as a back-up local host for NPR's daily news magazines and Ideastream's call-in show, “Sound of Ideas.” He was previously WKSU's news director and has worked for public and commercial radio stations in the New York/New Jersey metro area.\n\nHighlights:\n\n2023 RTDNA Edward R. Murrow regional award winner, news series, “Changing the course of a river”\n\n2022 RTDNA Edward R. Murrow national award winner, news documentary, “The rural doctor is in”\n\nAkron Press Club board member\n\nColonel, Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels\n\nWhy trust Ideastream Public Media?\n\nThe mission of Ideastream Public Media is to be a trustworthy and dynamic multimedia source for illuminating the world around us. Our highest priority is providing news and information that is reliable and accurate, that is gathered with integrity and professional care and that is presented with precision and respect for the intelligence of our audiences. We are transparent about how we discover and verify the facts we present and strive to make our decision-making process clear to the public. We disclose relationships, such as with partners or funders, that might appear, but will never, influence our coverage.\n\nEmail or call Andrew\n\nSevere storms downed trees and power lines across Northeast Ohio Tuesday. More than 300,000 homes remained without power into Wednesday.\n\nAkron Police now say the number of people shot in the drive-by shooting early Sunday Morning is 27. Two were in critical condition. One person was killed.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a Senate Committee hearing Wednesday that the burnoff of vinyl chloride could have been avoided.\n\nThe president toured the site of the derailment in East Palestine and met with local and federal officials to discuss the progress in the cleanup over the past year.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine and half of the Republicans in the Ohio House had called on Rep. Bob Young to resign, following arrests on domestic violence charges.\n\nThe International Soap Box Derby named Scott Taylor to lead the organization, citing his 37 years of experience leading YMCA's and other nonprofits in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York.\n\nSherer beat a fellow council member and a former Ohio state representative to win the Democratic nomination. He'll face Republican Roy Scott Depew in November.\n\nWhile voters have learned much more about the seven Democrats they’ll choose among for Akron mayor, a poll that Ideastream Public Media, the Akron Beacon Journal and the University of Akron put out this week shows their choice is still not clear. And it's critically important they make a choice.\n\nA major issue in Akron's mayoral race is the fatal shooting of Jayland Walker by Akron police. The candidates running in next month's primary shared their thoughts following the grand jury's decision not to indict the officers.\n\nA grand jury is weighing whether to indict eight Akron police officers in the killing last summer of Jayland Walker. Meanwhile, seven mayoral candidates met on stage Wednesday night for one more debate. Whoever wins will have their work cut out for them."
