        "text": "dbo:abstract\n\nWKSU (89.7 FM) is a non-commercial educational radio station licensed to serve Kent, Ohio, featuring a public radio format. Owned by Kent State University and operated by Ideastream Public Media, WKSU's primary signal encompasses the Akron metro area, Greater Cleveland and much of Northeast Ohio as the regional affiliate for National Public Radio (NPR), American Public Media, Public Radio Exchange and the BBC World Service. The station's reach is extended into the Canton, Mansfield, Lorain, Ashtabula, Sandusky, New Philadelphia and Wooster areas via a network of five full-power repeaters and two low-power translators. Founded by Kent State University, the station had its origins as a radio training workshop on the university's campus that provided programming for commercial radio stations, and save for a brief hiatus due to World War II, continued into WKSU's 1950 establishment as one of the first educational FM stations in the United States. An NPR affiliate since 1973, WKSU evolved from a university-operated station into a public radio and classical music outlet, with additional emphasis on folk music during the weekends. WKSU's influence extended into Cleveland, where from 1978 to 1984, it was the NPR information station of record for the entire region. After a public service operating agreement with WCPN owner Ideastream took effect on October 1, 2021, this distinction was again made official as both stations combined programming and personnel, with WKSU as the surviving entity. WKSU's studios are currently located at the Idea Center in Downtown Cleveland, while the station transmitter is in Copley Township. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WKSU broadcasts over four HD Radio channels, is simulcast over WCLV's second HD subchannel and WVIZ's 25.7 audio-only subchannel, and is available online. (en)\n\ndbp:quote\n\nIt is a gem. It is a treasure in Northeast Ohio, and it covers a part of Ohio that Ideastream doesn’t cover. We have developed such a station that is revered, and now, it’s just going to be second to Ideastream. I know there are financial issues. But the university should be proud to have an NPR station on its campus, not try to get rid of it. (en)\n\nOur main objective is to please the majority of people on the campus. It's now up to them to pick out what they want to hear. Here's their chance. (en)\n\nWhat I remember clearly is then-General Manager John Perry calling a meeting. And part of that was that this program called 'All Things Considered' was potentially coming our way. And what did it mean for us? That was a really big step: it was a landmark for NPR. (en)\n\nPeople were trained at WKSR and only the good made it over to WKSU. Now it's not the case at all. After Fresh Air went off the air, WKSU made a conscious decision that they wouldn't hire students anymore. (en)"
