        "text": "Audio-Technica was recently selected as the microphone of choice for the new mobile studio of Folk Alley‘s live streaming web radio program by Kent, Ohio-based WKSU-FM.\n\nThe Audio-Technica microphones are used for announcement/voiceover applications, live music broadcast and in-studio guests/performances in the mobile broadcast vehicle, which has been up and running since August 1, 2009.\n\nWKSU and Folk Alley Executive Director Al Bartholet stated, “When we first developed our plans for Folk Alley‘s mobile recording studio, we put Audio-Technica microphones on the top of our wish list.”\n\n“Music and radio are industries that revolve around audio, and having the ability to use mics of Audio-Technica’s outstanding quality makes it easier for us to do our job well.”\n\nIncluded in the studio’s microphone cabinate are AE5400, AE5100, PRO 35, and AT875R Microphones.\n\nJoe Gunderman, Folk Alley Production Coordinator and Senior Producer commented, “I’m very enthusiastic about the AE5400s.”\n\n“We have in-studio guests, and in the past, we might normally have used a large-diaphragm with shock mount, but the AE5400 sounds just as great and is friendlier visually to put in front of our guests.”\n\n“We’ve used AE5400s also in the studio and at live events, for recent performances by some really great folk artists – Madison Violet, Solas, The Greencards, Ann Heaton and Natalia Zukerman from Winter Bloom, and lots more.”\n\n“Also, the AE5100s are great too – we use them in front of acoustic guitars, acoustic bass, bouzoukis, mandolins, and more, and they’ve always given us a real nice response.”\n\nAdded Linda Fahey, Folk Alley Director of Programming and Marketing, “We built the FolkAlley.com mobile studio to enable us to capture the best folk and roots music performances at venues and festivals around the country.”\n\n“Using Audio-Technica mics – the best in the business – makes our final audio better and provides an enhanced listening experience for the thousands of people streaming Folk Alley‘s interviews and concert recordings online.”\n\nWith its new Mobile Recording Studio, WKSU’s Folk Alley is now able to take its show on the road with the vehicle which was paid for through a generous grant from a Folk Alley fan. The show helps to promote FolkAlley.com and Kent State University."
