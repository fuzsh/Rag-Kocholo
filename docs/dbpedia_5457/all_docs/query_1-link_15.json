So much of the station's approach to presenting classical music makes me think that you do not think it is that important. Other wise why would you present just one short part of a long composition and pretend that this is all there to it.? Bring to the broadcasting booth somebody who is willing to speak intelligently about it. Your presentation of classical music has to go above the elementary level of elevator music we hear in the doctor's office waiting room. I question whether or not your station is really educating people about this music. It comes across as filling time and entertainment for waiting room listening or elevator tunes. I have spoken with three of your announcers and I know that they know much more than they are permitted to say"
