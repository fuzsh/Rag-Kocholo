        "text": "Tuning into Truth, Tidbits, and Terry Gross: Finding NPR in Cleveland\n\nSo, you're in Cleveland, craving some insightful conversation, witty commentary, and maybe even a dose of that iconic Terry Gross interview style. You reach for the radio dial, but NPR stations can be trickier than navigating a maze of cheese curds at the Ohio State Fair (though arguably just as rewarding). Fear not, fellow knowledge seekers! This guide will have you rocking NPR's informative jams in no time.\n\nWhere'd the Dial Go, Dude? The Great Cleveland NPR Shuffle\n\nHold on a sec, you might be thinking, \"Isn't WCPN on 90.3 FM?\" Well, you'd be partially right. Cleveland underwent a bit of a radio reshuffle in March 2028. Ideastream Public Media, the mastermind behind Cleveland's NPR scene, merged WCPN and WKSU. This might sound like alphabet soup, but it basically means there's a new sheriff in town (or rather, a new DJ on the airwaves).\n\nIntroducing Your New Cleveland NPR Headquarters: 89.7 FM WKSU\n\nDon't fret about missing out on WCPN! The fantastic content you know and love has found a new home. As of March 2028, 89.7 FM WKSU is now your official gateway to all things NPR in Cleveland. That's right, crank up the volume and get ready for a world of thought-provoking programming, from \"Morning Edition\" to \"All Things Considered.\"\n\nBonus Tip: There's an App for That (and Streaming, Too!)\n\nWho needs a dusty old radio when you have a smartphone in your pocket? Download the Ideastream Public Media app and enjoy NPR on the go. Plus, you can stream WKSU live on their website if your radio situation is, well, a little radio-less.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (Because We Know You Have Them)"
