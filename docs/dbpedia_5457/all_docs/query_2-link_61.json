        "text": "This page is about the city. For the county, see Sandusky County, Ohio. For the townships, see Sandusky Township, Ohio.\n\nSandusky ( san-DUSS-kee) is a city in and the county seat of Erie County, Ohio, United States. Situated on the southern shore of Lake Erie, Sandusky is located roughly midway between Toledo (45 miles (72 km) west) and Cleveland (50 miles (80 km) east). According to 2020 census, the city had a population of 25,095, and the Sandusky metropolitan area had 115,986 residents.\n\nSandusky was established in the early 19th century and developed as a port city at the head of Sandusky Bay. It is home to Cedar Point, one of the most popular amusement parks in the world, as well as water parks including Cedar Point Shores, Castaway Bay, Great Wolf Lodge, and Kalahari. The headquarters of Cedar Fair Entertainment Company were located in the city until it merged with Six Flags, who retains some administrative offices in Sandusky.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe accepted etymology is that the name \"Sandusky\" is derived from the Wyandot word saundustee, meaning \"water\" or andusti, \"cold water.\" In his 1734 history of New France, Charlevoix transliterated the word as \"Chinouski.\" Sandusky Bay, formed at the mouth of the Sandusky River, is identified as \"Lac (Lake) Sandouské\" on a 1718 map by Guillaume DeLisle. The name \"L.(Lac) Sandoski\" appears on a 1733 map. Sandusky Bay was also called Lac Ondaské, in another French transliteration of the Wyandot.\n\nThe river and bay gave rise to a number of eponymous forts and settlements along their shores. These consisted of the short-lived English trading post Fort Sandusky north of the bay, the French Fort Sandoské that replaced it, the British Fort Sandusky on the south shore of the bay, the American Fort Sandusky (later Fort Stephenson) upriver at Lower Sandusky (now known as Fremont, Ohio), as well as the Wyandot Indian village of Upper Sandusky farther upriver.\n\nAnother, less accepted etymologic version claims that the city's name goes back to a Polish–American trader and frontiersman named Anthony Sadowski, a neighbor of the Boone family and co-founder of Amity village. He was employed by the governor of then British Pennsylvania as a trader and interpreter, speaking several Indian languages, especially Iroquois. He moved to the Pennsylvania frontier in January 1712 and could easily have made it to Lake Erie by 1718 to establish a trading post. One genealogical line of his descendants is actually called \"Sandusky.\"\n\nHistory\n\n18th century\n\nThis area was a center of trading and fortifications since the 18th century: the English, French, and Americans had trading posts and forts built on both the north and south sides of Sandusky Bay.\n\n19th century\n\nGeorge Croghan was one of the more prominent men who operated in this area in the 18th century. A federal fur trade factory was established in 1808 but was lost at the beginning of the War of 1812.\n\nDevelopment by European Americans of the city of Sandusky, starting in 1818, on the southeast shore of Sandusky Bay, followed settlement of the war of 1812. Part of the city quickly enveloped the site of an earlier small village named Portland (established about 1816). Sandusky was incorporated as a city in 1824. Eventually the city of Sandusky encompassed most of the entire township that had been called Portland. Some of the city was built on land formerly occupied by a Native American man named Ogontz, and therefore the city is said to have been built on \"Ogontz' place\".\n\nSandusky's rise in the 19th century was heavily influenced by its location at the head of Sandusky Bay. This made it a key point both for the movement of goods and for the movement of people. The mild climate caused by its proximity to Lake Erie also caused it to become the center of Ohio's wine industry. The presence of limestone was also important in its development. It was also a key location for ice harvesting in the 19th century. Lumber transport, stone quarrying and, in the early 20th century, manufacturing, have all contributed to the city's economic development.\n\nPrior to the abolition of slavery in the United States, Sandusky was a stop for refugee slaves on the Underground Railroad, as some would travel across Lake Erie to reach freedom in Canada. Although Ohio was a free state, they felt at risk from slavecatchers because of bonuses offered under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As depicted in Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1855), many refugee slaves seeking to get to Canada made their way to Sandusky, where they boarded boats crossing Lake Erie to the port of Amherstburg in Ontario.\n\nSandusky's original plat was designed by surveyor Hector Kilbourne according to a modified grid plan, known today as the Kilbourne Plat. Kilbourne later became the first Worshipful Master of the first Sandusky Masonic Lodge, known as Science Lodge #50, still in operation on Wayne Street. His design featured a street grid with avenues cutting diagonally to create patterns reminiscent of the symbols of Freemasonry.\n\nOn September 17, 1835, Sandusky was the site of groundbreaking for the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad, which brought change to the town. Industrial areas developed near the railroad and goods were transported through the port. The coal docks located west of downtown still use a portion of the original MR&LE right-of-way. In 1838, Erie County, Ohio was formed by the state legislature and Sandusky was designated the county seat. This led to the foundation of a court house and Sandusky becoming a regional government center. In 1846 Sandusky had a population of approximately 3,000 people. At that point Sandusky had two railroads and was also a main focus of lake traffic. The town then consisted of many stores, two printing offices, two machine shops, two banks, six churches, one high school, and several iron furnaces.\n\nThe English author Charles Dickens visited the city in 1842, and briefly wrote of it in his subsequent travelogue, American Notes. Said Dickens, who rode the newly constructed MR&LE railroad from Tiffin:\n\nAt two o'clock we took the railroad; the travelling-on which was very slow, its construction being indifferent, and the ground wet and marshy; and arrived at Sandusky in time to dine that evening. We put up at a comfortable little hotel on the brink of Lake Erie, lay there that night, and had no choice but to wait there next day, until a steamboat bound for Buffalo appeared. The town, which was sluggish and uninteresting enough, was something like the back of an English watering-place out of the season.\n\nBy 1880, Sandusky had risen to a population of 16,000. There were then 20 churches and three newspapers in the community. The city boasted 29 businesses with at least 10 employees. Products being produced included lime, railroad locomotives and cars, carriages, wheels, crayons, chalk, beer, paper, baskets, and tools. By 1886 Sandusky was the center of wood wheel manufacture in the United States. It was also the location of the Ohio State Fish hatchery and the Ohio Soldiers and Sailor's Home.\n\n20th century\n\nThe city developed as a center of paper-making. With a mill in the industrial area near the lake, the Hinde & Dauch Paper Company was the largest employer in the city in the early 1900s.\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, the economy of Sandusky came to focus mainly on tourism and fishing. Since the late 20th century, Battery Park Marina was developed on the original site of the MR&LE Railroad after restructuring of the industry reduced traffic on the line. The tracks that ran through downtown Sandusky have since been removed. Most of the downtown industrial area is also being redeveloped for other purposes, including mainly marina dockage.\n\nThe National Arbor Day Foundation has designated Sandusky as a Tree City USA.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 21.91 square miles (56.75 km2), of which 9.73 square miles (25.20 km2) is land and 12.18 square miles (31.55 km2) is water.\n\nSandusky occupies the defunct township Portland and borders the following townships:\n\nMargaretta Township - west and south\n\nPerkins Township - south\n\nHuron Township - east\n\nClimate\n\nSandusky has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa), typical of the Midwestern United States, with warm summers and cold winters. Winters tend to be cold, with an average January high temperature of 32 °F (0 °C), and an average January low temperature of 19 °F (−7 °C), with considerable variation in temperatures. Sandusky averages 23.3 inches (59 cm) of snow per winter. Summers tend to be warm with an average July high temperature of 82 °F (28 °C), and an average July low temperature of 66 °F (19 °C). Summer weather is more stable, generally humid with thunderstorms. Fall usually is the driest season with many clear warm days and cool nights.\n\nThe highest recorded temperature in Sandusky of 105 °F (41 °C) was set on July 14, 1936, and the lowest recorded temperature of −20 °F (−29 °C) was set on January 19, 1994.\n\nLocal areas\n\nHistorically, the Wyandot used the term andoske to refer to the river, the bay, and the general area where the city of \"Sandusky\" later developed. This practice was also used by French and English settlers in the area. Often in historical documents, the word \"Sandusky\" is used without clarification as to which specific site or location is being referred to. Historical references to \"Sandusky\" might mean any one of the following locations, depending also on the date of the reference.\n\nList of locations, with approximate dates of usage:\n\nSandusky/Sandusky City - about 1817* to present, village/city on southeast side of Sandusky Bay (*-any \"Sandusky\" reference dated prior to 1817 would not refer to this village, as it was not officially established by this name until 1818).\n\nSandusky Bay - 1700 to present; early variants were \"(Lac d')Otsanderket\", \"(Lac d')Otsandoske\", \"Lake Sandoskė\".\n\nSandusky River - 1740s to present.\n\nFort Sandusky - various locations: c. 1745, an English trading post on the northern side of the bay. c.1754, a French fort (\"Fort Janundat\") was built on the southern side of the bay. Later in the French and Indian War, the British built Fort Sandusky on the southeastern side of Sandusky Bay. From about 1812/1813, this referred to a fort (later called \"Fort Stephenson\") on the Sandusky River, near present-day Fremont, Ohio.\n\nLower Sandusky - 1760s to 1849, area or village at the site of what is now the city of Fremont.\n\nUpper Sandusky - 1760s? to present, area or village at the falls, which later developed as the current city of Upper Sandusky. Upper Sandusky is south of Sandusky and upriver of it. While a common first impression is that \"Upper\" implies \"north of\", here \"Upper\" refers to \"upstream\", as in upstream of Lake Erie by means of the Sandusky River.\n\nUpper Sandusky Old Town - 1760s? to ?, a historic Wyandot (Huron) tribe village, about 12 miles (19 km) north of where the city of Upper Sandusky developed.\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1830 593 — 1840 1,433 141.7% 1850 5,087 255.0% 1860 8,408 65.3% 1870 13,000 54.6% 1880 15,838 21.8% 1890 18,471 16.6% 1900 19,664 6.5% 1910 19,989 1.7% 1920 22,897 14.5% 1930 24,022 4.9% 1940 24,874 3.5% 1950 29,375 18.1% 1960 31,989 8.9% 1970 32,674 2.1% 1980 31,360 −4.0% 1990 29,764 −5.1% 2000 27,844 −6.5% 2010 25,793 −7.4% 2020 25,095 −2.7% Sources:\n\n2010 census\n\nLargest ancestries (2010) Percent German 34.4% Irish 15.9% English 8.4% Italian 6.8% American 3.7%\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 25,793 people, 11,082 households, and 6,415 families residing in the city.
