        "text": "A career in radio was a surprising turn for me seeing that my first love was science. I studied chemistry at the University of Akron and for 13 years lived the quiet life of an analytical chemist in the Akron area,listening to WKSU all the while in the lab.\n\nA few small explosions and chemical spills helped me decide that it was time to look for a new career. In 1998 I landed a part-time position at WKSU and began hosting the Sunday local performance show, In Performance. The magic of radio did its work on me, and in December 2000 I permanently shed the lab-coat to join WKSU full-time and have never looked back.\n\nAs the local host of NPR's All Things Considered, I love connecting with listeners as they’re heading home. It’s a privilege to introduce listeners to the fascinating guests, artists, experts, and news makers that are heard each day on NPR. It’s a conversation that enriches us all.\n\nI’m also thrilled to share my love of science with listeners through Exploradio, along with reporting on the environment, business, and politics.\n\nReporting the news is perfect for someone like me because I’m intensely curious ( i.e. nosy) and have a very short attention span! I'm grateful to have found my niche.\n\nWKSU is one of those rare places where creativity and technology come together to create a product that touches your intellect and your soul—it makes you laugh and carries you through times of reflection.\n\nI sometimes imagine that a young person listening today will be inspired to make the world a better place because of something he or she heard on WKSU. I'm extremely proud to be part of one of the best stations in the public radio system.\n\nI live in Kent with my wife and my three wonderful children."
