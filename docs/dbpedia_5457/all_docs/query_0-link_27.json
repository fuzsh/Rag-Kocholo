        "text": "OPENINGS\n\nColumbus area greets\n\nsecond Swensons site\n\nSwensons Drive-In celebrated the opening of its second Columbus-area restaurant Monday, The Columbus Dispatch reported.\n\nThe restaurant, on Ikea Way in the Polaris area, follows the first area Swensons, on Sawmill Road north of Hard Road. A third location, on Cemetery Road in Hilliard, is planned.\n\nThe restaurants are the first outside northeast Ohio for the Akron-based chain.\n\nNEWSPAPERS\n\nGannett turns its back\n\non Digital First buyout\n\nThe publisher of USA Today and dozens of other newspapers said no to a hedge-fund backed media group with a reputation for slashing jobs, but the buyout fight may not be over.\n\nGannett on Monday said its board has unanimously rejected an unsolicited $1.36 billion buyout from MNG Enterprises, better known as Digital First Media. Digital First, which has a 7.5 percent stake in Gannett, then said that it might nominate new Gannett board directors to consider its offer.\n\nThe board decided the $12 per share offer was too low, and that it wasn't in the interest of the company or its shareholders, according to Gannett Co.\n\n\"It appears that MNG does not have a realistic plan to acquire Gannett,\" Gannett said in a prepared statement.\n\nAUTOS\n\nGM begins global layoffs\n\nof white-collar workers\n\nGeneral Motors is starting to lay off about 4,300 white-collar workers worldwide this week.\n\nIn November, the company said it wanted to cut 8,000 salaried and contract workers so it can raise profit margins and invest more in autonomous and electric vehicles.\n\nThe company says 2,200 white-collar employees took buyouts, while another 1,500 contract workers were let go.\n\nMany of the layoffs will happen at GM's technical center near Detroit. Most work on components for internal combustion engines and discontinued car models.\n\nGM also plans to close one Canadian and four U.S. car factories (including Lordstown in Northeast Ohio), shedding another 5,000 jobs. But 2,700 U.S. workers will be offered jobs at other factories.\n\nEVENTS\n\nPRSA guest panel to talk\n\nabout working with media\n\nThe Akron Chapter of the Public Relations Society of America will present its annual Working with the Media panel discussion at noon Feb. 14 at The Tangier, 532 W. Market St. in Akron. The luncheon program is open to the public.\n\nThe panel moderator will be Cheryl Powell, metro editor of the Akron Beacon Journal.
