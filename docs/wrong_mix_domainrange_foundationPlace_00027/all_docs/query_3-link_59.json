        "text": "Todayâ€™s technology allows doctors to perform complex surgeries through less invasive and more precise means. Computer surgical navigation is becoming increasingly common in a variety of orthopaedic procedures, from total knee replacements to total hip replacements.\n\nPatients with arthritis and other severe conditions can undergo total hip replacement using more advanced surgical technology, which is easier on both the surgeon and the patient.\n\nSurgery and Recovery\n\nTotal hip replacement using computer navigation provides more precise control for placement of the implants. The surgery involves using infrared cameras to mark specific targeted areas for the implants and targets for the surgical instruments. The instruments are then moved using robotic technology.\n\nThe surgeon is in complete control of the procedure, but the technology provides more precise placement. The result is better stability and mobility after surgery and better overall joint function. This technique also provides a lower incidence of implant malalignment, which means fewer surgeries in the future to revise the position of the implant.\n\nMost patients report good long-term results from this type of surgery."
