However, the dynamics of information flow between these regions remain largely unknown. In this project, we aim to construct a computational model to analyze simultaneous recordings and uncover the intricate interconnections between brain regions. We will develop a multimodal dimensionality reduction technique to handle multi-region recordings effectively. Specifically, we will explore the utilization of a multi-region coupled autoencoder to encode neuronal activities into latent space representations. These representations will then be decoded to reconstruct the original activity, allowing us to investigate the functional roles of different brain regions. Moreover, we will examine the behavioral decoding capabilities of these regions by analyzing latent space representations. By utilizing machine learning techniques such as autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and attention mechanisms, the undergraduate involved in this computational role will gain valuable skills and contribute to expanding our understanding of brain connectivity. This project offers an exciting opportunity for undergraduate students to engage in cutting-edge research at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning while acquiring practical experience in Python programming and advanced data analysis techniques.\n\nApplicants with a strong background in Python/matlab are highly encouraged.\n\nMentor Biography: Ram Dyuthi Sristi is a fifth-year doctoral student in Gal Mishne’s lab at the University of California, San Diego studying electrical engineering.

Previous human action models cannot produce explicit action predictions to understand complex human behaviors in clinical settings.\n\nThis project aims to use a data-driven approach to discover and model subtle human behavioral motifs with minimum human involvement. It will combine statistical modeling involving computer vision and natural language processing, deep learning and probabilistic reasoning to model and cluster human actions from video.\n\nThe Mishne lab has shown that it is possible to differentiate behavioral motifs and quantify hallmark features related to bipolar disorder. SURFiN fellows will explore how to further improve the framework using models such as Gaussian Process Modeling and Graph Neural Networks. Fellows will also have the opportunity to explore natural language processing (NLP) generative models for human actions, and classification models to distinguish patient populations. A successful fellow will be able to make headway on machine learning problems using a combination of application domain knowledge, and state of the art machine learning techniques. In addition, they will be able to build a bridge between neuroscience and machine learning to address real research needs.\n\nMentor Biography: Zhanqi Zhang is a doctoral student in computer science at University of California, San Diego, supported by Halicioḡlu Data Science Institute Ph.D. fellowship.

This means that the cortex and striatum form many distinct subcircuits. These circuits are thought to transform incoming stimuli into goal-directed action. However, we do not know which specific corticostriatal circuits are most important for learning visually-guided decision making tasks. To tackle this question, we will selectively inhibit different corticostriatal circuits (via optogenetics) as mice learn a perceptual decision-making task. We will then quantify learning deficits that are induced by optogenetic inhibition. The fellow can expect to learn and use the following modalities over the course of the project:\n\nRodent handling and behavioral training: how to handle and care for laboratory mice. The fellow will also train mice to perform decision-making tasks.\n\nRodent surgery: the fellow will learn to perform optogenetics implantation surgery, allowing us to perform targeted manipulation of brain circuits.\n\nComputation/data analysis: the fellow will learn to write custom Python scripts to analyze behavioral data and identify if learning deficits are present due to optogenetic stimulation.\n\nCommunication: the fellow will learn to craft clear, compelling scientific presentations in a low-stress environment.\n\nMentor Biography: Max Melin is a fifth year M.D.-Ph.D. student in the UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program.

Specifically, we are studying heterozygous loss of function (loss of one copy) of the gene, Scn2a, which produces a voltage-gated sodium channel (a protein important for communication between neurons). Humans with this genetic variant are very likely to develop autism with intellectual disability. Recent work from our lab has shown that rats with heterozygous loss of function of Scn2a (Scn2a+/-) learn a spatial alternation task more slowly than wild type rats, and now we are using in-vivo physiology (brain recordings in freely moving rats) to characterize the systems-level differences that may be causing this learning impairment. We are using long-term physiology recording techniques to record the activity in awake rats from two brain regions that contribute to spatial alternation task learning: hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. This project would provide the student opportunities to learn rat handling and behavioral training, long-term in vivo physiology data collection, and subsequent analysis of the neural recording data. The primary questions we will address are (1) is neuronal activity different in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in Scn2a+/- rats compared to wild type rats, (2) is communication between these two brain regions different in Scn2a+/- rats, and (3) can any differences we find in neurophysiology explain the learning impairments we have observed in these rats?\n\nMentor Biography: Michael Coulter graduated from Harvard College with a degree in history of science in 2008. He then received a Ph.D. in neurobiology in 2018 from the M.D.-Ph.D. program at Harvard Medical School. During his Ph.D., Michael was in the lab of Chris A. Walsh at Boston Children’s Hospital, and his work focused on the genetics of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. He identified a new set of genes associated with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, found a novel mechanism for growth factor secretion in the developing brain, and characterized single neuron somatic DNA mutations in early neurodegenerative disorders. With a long-term career goal of improving the lives of individuals with autism and intellectual disability Michael joined the lab of Loren Frank at UCSF to learn the experimental techniques and theoretical framework to approach the study of neurodevelopmental disorders from a systems neuroscience perspective to complement his genetic and molecular training during graduate school. In Dr. Frank’s lab, he has focused on developing a new system for neurofeedback in the hippocampus and begun to characterize the systems-level differences in a genetic rat model of autism.

This flexible cognitive process is known as model-based planning and is typically impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders. The hippocampus (HPC)—usually understood to represent past or present experience—has recently been implicated in the ability to imagine possible futures. Despite observing hippocampal future representations before decision-making, we understand little about how these representations are regulated and what functions they subserve. I hypothesize that, to find adaptive solutions in response to a changing environment, input from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) drives hippocampal future representations. I further hypothesize that these representations coordinate with PFC cost-benefit computations to chain imagined actions with predicted outcomes, thereby facilitating model-based decision-making. Employing a dynamic foraging task and multiregional electrophysiology, I will investigate how PFC and HPC interact when rats plan new routes toward rewards in the presence of novel barriers. I will leverage closed-loop optogenetic manipulations to determine the necessity of PFC-HPC interactions for model-based decision-making. This project will uncover the anatomical underpinnings, mechanistic control and functional significance of hippocampal future representations, which will ultimately illuminate the neural basis of mental simulation and flexible planning.\n\nMentor Biography: Xulu Sun graduated from Shandong University in 2013 with a bachelor’s degree in biology.

Recent progress in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) has allowed these individuals to communicate using a brain-to-text framework. Specifically, a neural network and language model is trained to decode neural signals of attempted speech into text of words and sentences in real-time. However, different users may have different preferences when it comes to their speech neuroprosthesis. In this project, we will brainstorm certain features to make the speech neuroprostheses more personalized to an individual user. Potential projects could involve incorporating the decoding of prosodic features into the decoder audio output, analyzing human neural data to understand the neural basis underlying various characteristics of speech, or analyzing error trends and incorporating linguistic or behavioral strategies to improve decoding accuracy. This project will be very interdisciplinary and may involve developing skills in systems and computational neuroscience, machine learning, software engineering or linguistics. The exact scope of the project will be catered to the fellow’s learning goals, experience and skill level.\n\nMentor Biography: Erin Kunz is currently an electrical engineering doctoral candidate in the Stanford Neural Prosthetics Translational Lab (NPTL) with Jaimie Henderson and Shaul Druckmann.

The overall aim of the larger project is to specify cognitive models of social learning across two psychiatric conditions with core social difficulties: autism and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Under the mentorship of Yen-Wen Chen, the postdoctoral associate overseeing this broader project, and additional supervision of Gabriela Rosenblau, the principal investigator for both the hosting lab and project, the fellow will receive training in collecting in-person behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The data collection will focus on social learning in young adults with autism and in a non-autistic comparison. Furthermore, the fellow will gain experience in conducting state-of-the-art neuroimaging analyses using both standardized processing pipelines and novel techniques. The fellow will also be exposed to the broader collaborative aspect of the project and be able to attend international workshops and meetings.\n\nThe fellow’s specific project will explore individual differences in rigidity and how they relate to social learning among autistic and non-autistic individuals. For this purpose, they will be able to leverage self-report measures of rigidity, personality structure and preferences collected in over 3,000 individuals. Using this rich data set will expose the fellow to efficient ‘big data’ computational tools and statistical models. Overall, the fellow will acquire technical skills through hands-on training in programming and statistical analysis with Python, MATLAB and R and have the opportunity to present their findings at both an organized student conference at George Washington University (GW) and an international conference.\n\nMentor Biography: Yen-Wen Chen received her doctorate in integrative neuroscience at Stony Brook University in 2023.

Our electrophysiology-based genetic screening in Drosophila has revealed the crucial role of epigenetic regulation genes in synaptic homeostatic plasticity. While epigenetic mechanisms are known to be essential for neural differentiation and learning and memory, their specific effects on brain function across different cell types remain largely unexplored. Preliminary findings from our electrophysiological and computational analyses have pinpointed potential signaling molecules that may act downstream of these epigenetic regulators in modulating homeostatic plasticity. In this project, we aim to dissect the signaling network governed by these epigenetic regulators, utilizing transcriptomic approaches and quantitative real-time PCR to examine their roles in synaptic homeostatic plasticity across various cell types in Drosophila. Furthermore, we will thoroughly investigate the expression patterns of these epigenetic regulators and their target genes during brain development within the mouse brain. This research will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which epigenetic regulators affect synaptic homeostatic plasticity during brain development, potentially uncovering new therapeutic avenues for neurodevelopmental conditions.\n\nMentor Biography: Yumeng Xie is a postdoctoral fellow in Tingting Wang’s laboratory at Georgetown University’s Department of Pharmacology and Physiology. Her academic journey began with an M.D.-Ph.D. from Wuhan University, where she focused on the molecular underpinnings of depression using mouse models to explore potential treatments for severe depression. This work ignited her passion for understanding the molecular and cellular bases of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, leading her to delve deeper into neuroscience with a particular focus on synaptic plasticity. Currently, Yumeng is part of the Wang lab, which employs Drosophila and rodent models to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms of homeostatic signaling in health and disease. The lab has pinpointed several critical genes involved in epigenetic regulation, necessary for homeostatic synaptic plasticity. These genes are associated with increased likelihood of epilepsy, intellectual disability and autism. Yumeng’s current research focuses on understanding the expression profiles and the transcriptomic networks regulated by these homeostatic genes. Her goal is to uncover their roles in neurological conditions, potentially leading to therapeutic strategies.\n\nMentor Name: Adhikansh Jain\n\nMentor Role: Graduate Student\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Julia Dallman\n\nInstitution: University of Miami\n\nLocation: Coral Gables, FL\n\nLab Website: https://dallmanlab.weebly.com\n\nProject Title: Gut as gatekeeper? Testing the role of serotonin in a zebrafish model of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome\n\nProject Description: The aim of the study is to unravel the intricacies surrounding serotonin and its role in Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), a form of autism linked to mutations in the SHANK3 gene. PMS is characterized by traits such as severe constipation, social interaction difficulties and repetitive behaviors, affecting both the gut and the brain in humans. We have shown that these traits are mirrored in zebrafish SHANK3 models. Serotonin acts as a neurotransmitter with diverse functions including gut motility, synaptic activity, mood regulation and social behaviors. Previous data has shown variations in serotonin levels in zebrafish wild type and SHANK3ab-mutated guts. Using anti-5HT staining, we will test the hypothesis that altered absorption of tryptophan, an essential amino acid and serotonin precursor, results in reduced levels of serotonin in SHANK3 mutant brains. In parallel, we will use bulk RNA sequencing to pinpoint affected serotonergic pathway components in both the gut and the brain. By scrutinizing RNA transcripts, specific genes causing serotonin variations can be identified and can discern if lower serotonin stems from gene inactivity or reduced expression. Subsequent investigations will probe these genes further to determine if they are inactive, diminished or undergoing differentiation. This research promises valuable insights into the interplay of serotonin, SHANK3ab and PMS in zebrafish to provide a foundation for understanding serotonin’s role in SHANK3 mutant phenotypes. Ultimately, this knowledge may pave the way for exploring serotonin administration as a means to alleviate PMS-linked traits.\n\nMentor Biography: Adhikansh Jain, a first-year graduate student at the University of Miami, completed his bachelor’s degree at the University of California, Davis.

This project focuses on developing brain-computer interfaces to investigate how the brain generates dexterous hand and finger behaviors and restore such function to people with paralysis in a clinical trial. To do so, we implant sensors into the motor cortex (the part of the brain that controls movement) of a person with paralysis. Then, we use artificial neural networks to study how biological neuron populations generate behavior and use them to predict the movements a person is trying to make in real-time to control a variety of games. The SURFiN fellow joining our team will assist with developing the games and machine learning algorithms. This project is ideal training for someone interested in real-time brain-computer interfaces and cutting-edge machine learning.\n\nMentor Biography: Sam Nason-Tomaszewski is a postdoctoral fellow in the Systems Neural Engineering Lab advised by Chethan Pandarinath. His current research focuses on developing real-time brain-computer interfaces to recreate hand function in people with upper extremity paralysis. Specifically, he is using deep neural networks that predict high-fidelity arm, hand and finger movements in virtual environments using signals recorded by sensors implanted into the brain. Sam received his doctorate in biomedical engineering from Cindy Chestek’s lab at the University of Michigan where he investigated brain-controlled restoration of dexterous finger function in monkeys using functional electrical stimulation. He received the College of Engineering’s Towner Prize for Outstanding Ph.D. Research for his dissertation work.\n\nMentor Name: Anna Pritchard\n\nMentor Role: Graduate Student\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Chethan Pandarinath\n\nInstitution: Emory University\n\nLocation: Atlanta, GA\n\nLab Website: http://snel.ai\n\nProject Title: Development of virtual tasks for a discretely-controlled upper-limb iBCI\n\nProject Description: In the US, about 180,000 people experience tetraplegia from spinal cord injury, in addition to cases resulting from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), stroke and other neurological injury or disease. Recovery of upper-limb and hand function is a top priority for people with tetraplegia. Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) have emerged as a method to decode motor intent from the brain to control prostheses like robotic arms. Electrodes are implanted in a participant’s cortex to collect neural data which are processed to infer a control signal for the effector (e.g., hand/arm kinematics). Functionality of these iBCI systems is assessed by reach-and-grasp clinical assessments or tasks, like feeding and drinking. The goal of this project is to develop a discretely-controlled virtual upper-limb iBCI for a participant with tetraplegia and test it with functionality and usability metrics. The hand will be the MuJoCo HAPTIX MPL, and the real-time iBCI system is mostly Python based. The SURFiN fellow will contribute to the development of virtual reach-and-grasp assessments and games, the analysis of intracortical neural data, and the development of our real-time upper-limb iBCI system. Relevant areas of interest include game/graphics development, machine learning, signal processing and neural data analysis.\n\nMentor Biography: Anna is a doctoral student in the Systems Neural Engineering Lab at Emory. She is part of the iBCI research team, conducting research as part of the BrainGate 2 clinical trial. Her current focus involves understanding how the brain controls upper-limb movements so that upper-limb functionality can be restored in people with tetraplegia. She is working to develop a discretely-controlled reach-and-grasp iBCI system that is more functional and user-friendly than current approaches.

Despite significant advances over the years, iBCI control performance still falls short compared to that of able-bodied behavior. This project aims to gain a better understanding of how parameters of intended movement are encoded by neural activity recorded from the human motor cortex in order to inform the design of new iBCI control strategies. The SURFiN fellow joining our team will help pursue this goal through the design and coding of graphical motor tasks (e.g., controlling a cursor on the screen or through a virtual, 3D space) that will be performed by participants in an iBCI clinical trial. They will also aid in the analysis of intracortical neural data recorded during clinical sessions. Additionally, they may contribute to the development of user interfaces to assist participants in the practical use of brain-computer interfaces. Relevant areas of interest include brain-computer interfaces, game/graphics development and neural data analysis.\n\nMentor Biography: Mattia is a biomedical engineering doctoral student in the Systems Neural Engineering Lab at Emory and Georgia Tech, advised by Chethan Pandarinath.

This project delves into cognitive functions in mice by employing a novel approach to spatially pattern light for optogenetics. Our objective is to unravel cortex-wide neural activity that influences cognitive processes during behavioral tasks.\n\nAs a participant in the SURFiN fellowship, your primary responsibility will involve conducting experimental trials with mice, leveraging a behavioral task tailored to unravel cognitive computations during decision-making junctures in a virtual reality environment.\n\nAdditionally, your role extends to the enhancement of our research methodologies. One focus will be the refinement of our software’s graphical user interface (GUI), aiming to democratize our technique within the neuroscience research community.\n\nYour participation also encompasses a range of laboratory duties that are integral to the operation of a neuroscience research environment. These responsibilities provide a holistic view of laboratory dynamics in neuroscience research.\n\nThis project is tailored to accommodate undergraduates from diverse academic backgrounds, offering a stimulating yet accessible research experience. You will acquire practical skills in optogenetics, behavioral analysis, software development and general laboratory management, fostering a versatile skill set crucial in scientific research.\n\nMentor Biography: Mathew Rynes is a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Before working at Northwestern University, he obtained a doctorate in biomedical engineering and a bachelor’s in neuroscience and biochemistry from the University of Minnesota. His research interests focus on developing techniques for neuroscience and uncovering brain-wide neural correlates of decision making and related cognitive processes. In his current research, he is developing a method for patterned illumination of the cortex for spatially patterned optogenetics in behaving mice aimed at investigating such brain-wide activity during decision making tasks.\n\nMentor Name: Renan Costa\n\nMentor Role: Postdoctoral Researcher\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Lucas Pinto\n\nInstitution: Northwestern University\n\nLocation: Chicago, IL\n\nLab Website: https://www.pintolab.org\n\nProject Title: Computation timescales as an organizing principle of large-scale cortical dynamics during decision making\n\nProject Description: To generate cognitive behaviors, the brain needs to integrate information over multiple timescales. For example, reading a sign on a rainy evening requires integrating noisy visual information over the timescale of a few seconds, whereas deciding whether to make a turn requires combining that information with memories and plans that happened in the timescale of hours. Despite its ubiquity, our understanding of how neuronal circuits implement computations on flexible timescales remains very limited. We will tackle this open question by leveraging a virtual reality task for mice that dissociates computation identity and computation timescale. The task requires animals to accumulate visual evidence, retain that evidence in memory, and later use it to make a decision. The SURFiN fellow can expect opportunities to learn how to use widefield imaging to monitor neuronal activity in behaving animals, develop behavioral paradigms to probe cognition in virtual reality, use computational tools to analyze behavioral and neuronal data, perform surgery to enable optical access to the brain, and perform general wet lab techniques (e.g., immunohistochemistry).\n\nMentor Biography: Renan M. Costa is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Neuroscience at Northwestern University. After obtaining an undergraduate degree in psychology at Universidade Federal do Paraná, Brazil, he moved to the U.S. to pursue a doctorate in neuroscience at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth). In Houston, he studied the neuronal population mechanisms underlying simple forms of learning. His current research aims at understanding how neurons across the cerebral cortex implement different cognitive computations, such as short-term memory, evidence accumulation and decision making. Ultimately, he hopes to uncover how complex nervous systems execute complex computations and how they learn to perform these computations. His graduate studies were supported by a Science Without Borders Fellowship (CNPq, Brazil) and a Larry Deaven Ph.D. Fellowship in Biomedical Sciences (UTHealth). His graduate research resulted in three first-author manuscripts and contributions to two other research papers.

When do we make bad choices, and why? The Cohen lab studies perceptual decision making and its underlying neuronal basis. We will build a ‘game room’ for our experimental animals to interact with a touch screen and get treats for doing it, all at the ease of their home enclosure in our facility. We will record their behavior when they voluntarily engage with our decision-making game. The animal’s choices will be used to train artificial neural network models, which will tell us how these choices might be computed in the brain. We will also investigate the changes in the animal’s behavior under different states (e.g., drug use, menstrual cycles of females and neurodegenerative diseases) that will lead to important hypotheses about the neuronal changes that occur during these processes. The prospective student will help design and build the experiment system, collect and analyze data, use computational modeling to generate hypotheses about neuronal basis of this behavior, and work in tandem with ongoing, rig-based electrophysiology projects to test model predictions.\n\nMentor Biography: Cheng Xue is currently a staff scientist in Marlene Cohen’s lab in the Department of Neurobiology, University of Chicago. Cheng received his bachelor’s and master’s degree in physics at Nanjing University in China. He subsequently carried out his doctoral work at the German Primate Center before joining Marlene’s lab as a postdoctoral researcher. Cheng is interested in flexible decision-making behavior in the natural environment that are full of changes. He uses multi-faceted approaches, including behaving monkey electrophysiology, computational modeling, and human psychophysics to study decisions in various aspects. Through these research experiences, Cheng developed a keen interest in the pattern of mistakes in decision making across species. He believes that these patterns have a common biological basis and, therefore, can potentially become a window to reveal the neuronal mechanism for decision-making and cognitive flexibility or their malfunction. He is convinced that research in this direction will inspire new treatment for various neurological disorders, as well as better decision-making strategies for healthy individuals.\n\nMentor Name: Jaekyoon Kim\n\nMentor Role: Research Scientist\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Edwin Abel\n\nInstitution: University of Iowa\n\nLocation: Iowa City, IA\n\nLab Website: https://tedabel.lab.uiowa.edu\n\nProject Title: The role of striatal circuits on repetitive and stereotyped behaviors in 16p11.2 deletion mouse model\n\nProject Description: The 16p11.2 hemi-deletion (16p11.2 del) is one of the most common genetic changes associated with autism. Because the human 16p11.2 region is highly conserved in mice, we can model and study this genetic risk factor in mice. Using this mouse model, we previously reported alterations in the structure and function of striatal circuits, which is consistent with recent studies reporting changes in striatal structure and function in study participants with autism. The striatum is the input structure of the basal ganglia, the key neural substrate for reward processing and motor control and these functions are often disrupted in individuals with autism. In this project, we will investigate how the genetic lesions lead to changes in molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie repetitive and stereotyped behaviors in 16p11.2 del mice, applying a combination of genetically-modified mouse models and targeted intra-striatal virus injections with video tracking and fiber-photometry techniques. These findings will identify neuronal mechanisms specific to the striatal dysfunction in autism. We hope that our research will help to develop novel therapeutic approaches for autism.\n\nMentor Biography Jaekyoon Kim is a postdoctoral research scholar in the Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology at Carver College of Medicine, Iowa Neuroscience Institute, University of Iowa. Jaekyoon received his bachelor’s in biochemistry from Yonsei University and his master’s in biotechnology from Seoul National University. Then he received a doctorate in psychology along another master’s at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, working with Karyn Frick, widely considered a world expert on the effects of estrogens on the brain and cognition. This background has given him the important ability to assess neuroscience from both a biomedical science perspective and a psychology perspective. Throughout his Ph.D., his work focused on the effects of sex steroid hormones, especially estrogen, on memory consolidation and he has become interested in sex differences in neurological conditions. Autism is a neurodevelopment condition with sex differences. One of the most common genetic variations associated with autism is the deletion of the 16p11.2 chromosomal region, which can be faithfully modeled in mice. Using the 16p11.2 hemi-deletion mouse model, the Abel lab revealed male-specific impairments in the acquisition of reward-dependent goal-directed behaviors. Therefore, as a research scientist, Jaekyoon is working on elucidating the underlying mechanisms driving behavioral alterations in the 16p11.2 hemi-deletion mice.\n\nEligibility: Students not currently enrolled at the University of Iowa must enroll in the university for a minimum of one semester hour in order to receive funds through this program.\n\nMentor Name: Mollie Meffert\n\nMentor Role: Associate Professor\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Mollie Meffert\n\nInstitution: Johns Hopkins University\n\nLocation: Baltimore, MD\n\nLab Website: https://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/58\n\nProject Title: Noncoding RNA dysregulation in Fragile X Syndrome\n\nProject Description: The Meffert laboratory is interested in how gene programs are recruited and maintained to make long-lasting changes in the nervous system during development, experience-dependent plasticity (like learning and memories), and in injury or disease. The nervous system is a particularly interesting place to study gene expression because of the striking need for spatial as well as temporal control of gene expression to create and maintain accurate functional change at distinct sites of synaptic connection between neurons. While there is one site, the nucleus, for transcriptional control, post-transcriptional control of gene expression can take place in the cytoplasm and offers a mechanism for rapid differential gene expression across the complex space of the neuron with its thousands of synaptic connections. One major focus of our lab is to understand how gene expression is controlled at the RNA level and how misregulation of these processes contributes to complex conditions of the nervous system such as autism. Recently, we published our findings that a family of small RNAs, called ‘microRNAs,’ contributes to aberrant growth and behavioral phenotypes in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome which is the largest monogenic cause of autism. We now have exciting evidence that these microRNAs may be impacting the function of the mitochondria which fuels the intensive energy requirements of neurons. A project in our lab would investigate aspects of this project, working with myself and with other graduate students in the lab.\n\nMentor Biography: Mollie Meffert is an Associate Professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in the Departments of Biological Chemistry and Neuroscience.

In particular, we are studying genes that have been associated with autism to understand how disruptions of these genes and their shared regulatory networks can contribute to autism. To uncover the roles of these genes, we are knocking them down using CRISPR-Cas13, which can specifically degrade the RNA transcripts of target genes. For these studies, we are primarily using human neural progenitor cell (NPC) cultures derived from induced pluripotent stem cells which have the capacity to self-renew as well as produce differentiated cell types like neurons. During the course of this project, you will gain extensive hands-on experience with cell culture techniques including expanding the NPCs as they proliferate, introducing the knockdown constructs through nucleofection, and inducing the NPCs to differentiate into neurons. You will also learn how to analyze the results of these experiments through immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, you will design and create CRISPR-Cas13 knockdown constructs to target new genes of interest. Throughout your training, we will emphasize critical aspects of experimental design and approach to enhance your scientific reasoning.\n\nMentor Biography: Rebecca Andersen is a postdoctoral research fellow in the lab of Christopher Walsh at Boston Children’s Hospital.

Alternatively, the brainstem is an evolutionary ancestral brain structure, and it contains key populations of neurons essential for the execution of several distinct actions. The project is focused on understanding the integration process at the interface of basal ganglia and brainstem motor control circuits. We hypothesize that integration and comparison of multiple inputs is a central mechanism of action switching. We use a wide variety of techniques (e.g., molecular biology, viral tracing, in vitro slice physiology, optogenetics and in vivo recordings) to address and test the biological hypotheses; we often develop new tools to be more rigorous in the experimental design.\n\nMost of the experiments are performed in mice. The SURFiN student will have the chance to learn/explore the following aspects: 1) histology techniques: antibody fluorescent stainings and microscopy (fluorescence and confocal), analysis of viral tracing data; 2) handling and training mice in an action selection/motor task; 3) data analysis, MATLAB/Python; 4) discussing results and research articles will be essential, as the goal will be to understand some interesting biological questions on top of experiencing wet laboratory techniques.\n\nMentor Biography: Paolo Capelli is a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory. Paolo studied molecular biology and neuroscience at the University of Pisa, Italy.

Scientists have now mapped the complete set of genes, around 22,000 in all, which collectively give rise to the various cell types and functions in our body. Moreover, they have identified thousands of variants across patients that increase or decrease risk of various diseases. However, translating this genetic data into actionable biological understanding has proved difficult. This is largely due to the low throughput at which genes and variants can be studied, with model organisms such as mice typically allowing the study of only one gene at a time. We have developed approaches to generate mosaic mice to interrogate the function of hundreds of genes simultaneously. We are applying these tools to uncover novel pathways in the mouse brain and to identify therapeutic targets in a variety of contexts. In this project, the SURFiN fellow will apply pooled CRISPR screening to study the function of disease-related genes in the mouse brain in high-throughput.\n\nMentor Biography: Tomasz Kula is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School working in the labs of Bernardo Sabatini and Beth Stevens. He is interested in developing and applying high-throughput genetic tools to understand complex disease and to identify therapeutic targets. Tomasz received his doctorate from Harvard University in the lab of Steve Elledge, where he developed two high-throughput tools to profile the immune system: VirScan, which maps the targets of antibodies against all viruses at once, and T-Scan, which identifies the targets of CD8 T cells at proteome scale. He is a co-founder of TScan Therapeutics, a company which is applying the T-Scan platform to develop cancer therapeutics that are currently in clinical trials.

While various forms of synaptic plasticity have been characterized throughout the brain, most if not all of them can be summarized as activity-dependent changes in synaptic weight (i.e., connection strength). This is in contrast with neurons in artificial neural networks, in which both the sign and weights change during training. My projects focus on a unique synapse between entopeduncular nucleus (EP) and lateral habenula (LHb) that seems to violate this rule. Unlike most other synapses in the brain, somatostatin neurons in EP co-release opposing neurotransmitter glutamate and GABA within single vesicle; therefore, it both excites and inhibits downstream LHb neurons. My preliminary evidence suggests the possibility that this synapse can become either net excitatory or inhibitory through plasticity during learning. In this project, we will further characterize such novel bi-directional synaptic plasticity and examine the underlying molecular mechanism. Therefore, SURFiN fellows can get hands on experience with using cutting-edge neuroscience techniques including but not limited to optogenetics, fiber photometry, extracellular chronic/acute Neuropixel recording, in vivo pulse-chase labeling and in vitro whole-cell electrophysiology. SURFiN fellows can also expect to deeply participate in the design and analysis of experiments.\n\nMentor Biography: Shun Li is currently a doctoral candidate in Bernardo Sabatini’s lab at Harvard Medical School. Shun received his bachelor’s degree from Duke University, graduating with distinction (summa cum laude) in neuroscience with minor in computer science and psychology. During his time at Duke, Shun joined Fan Wang’s lab and studied neural mechanism behind generation and coordination of orofacial behaviors, like licking and swallowing. His first author review was published in eNeuro and received the Outstanding Thesis Award in Neuroscience. After graduation, Shun joined the Program in Neuroscience at Harvard University. Currently, Shun is broadly interested in various aspects of system neuroscience with a focus on understanding how neural circuits (biological or artificial) learn and how these mechanism might be disrupted in diseases like depression. Specifically, Shun’s thesis project concerns a unique synapse in the brain that co-releases opposing neurotransmitter glutamate and GABA. This property raised a novel possibility that the excitatory/inhibitory nature of this synapse can change depending on experience, which is analogous to artificial neural networks but drastically differs from the biological ones. Shun hopes to characterize potential synaptic plasticity mechanism of this circuit through cutting-edge techniques in system neuroscience.\n\nMentor Name: Shijia Liu\n\nMentor Role: Postdoctoral Fellow\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Bernardo Sabatini\n\nInstitution: Harvard University\n\nLocation: Boston, MA\n\nLab Website: https://sabatini.hms.harvard.edu\n\nProject Title: Time to stop: neural mechanisms of action termination\n\nProject Description: The ability to stop an action is a critical aspect of executive control, the deficit of which is central to neuropsychiatric conditions like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Animals naturally stop their ongoing actions in the appropriate context, but how stop decisions are generated and executed remains unclear. My project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms and pathways underlying the stop decisions by studying how mice voluntarily stop licking in response to the absence of water. I designed a ‘licking-for-water’ task that allows for precise temporal dissection of the stopping process in specific contexts. I observed task-related signals in the medulla that predict upcoming stop decisions and demonstrated a significant role of a prefrontal cortical region in initiating the stopping decision. The SURFiN student will work with me to dissect the neural pathway that relays the stop information from the cortex to the medulla. The SURFiN student will perform mouse behavioral training, brain histology and analysis of neural and behavioral data under my guidance with daily discussions.\n\nMentor Biography: As a postdoctoral fellow in Bernardo Sabatini’s laboratory, Shijia’s research focuses on the neural underpinnings of context-dependent decision-making and the modulation of actions by internal states. Shijia obtained a doctorate at the Salk Institute with Sung Han, where she discovered neural circuits that orchestrate pain and breathing and identified potential targets to mitigate opioid overdose deaths. Her expertise lies in systems neuroscience and neural circuits dissection, through techniques like brain-wide activity monitoring, single-cell in vivo calcium imaging, optogenetics, chemogenetics, and the analysis of mouse behavior. Shijia is deeply committed to mentorship, having guided over ten students towards successful careers in graduate and medical programs. Furthermore, she is an advocate for equity, diversity and inclusion, exemplified by her co-founding of an affinity group dedicated to supporting scientists from Asian, Pacific Islander and Desi backgrounds during her time at the Salk Institute.\n\nMentor Name: Kevin Mastro\n\nMentor Role: Postdoctoral Fellow\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Bernardo Sabatini\n\nInstitution: Harvard University\n\nLocation: Boston, MA\n\nLab Website: https://sabatini.hms.harvard.edu\n\nProject Title: Uncovering mechanisms of cognitive decline vs. resilience\n\nProject Description: Aging is an evitable process where changes in both brain structure and behavior are observed, and its impact on each individual can vary widely. We hypothesize that these differences in cognitive trajectory are due to changes in underlying brain structure. First, we will use a combination of neuronal recordings in freely moving animals paired to define how the brain contributes to behaviorally-relevant events. Second, we will use viral tools (e.g., optogenetics and chemogenetics) to manipulate brain activity and identify what pathways are necessary and sufficient to drive age-related changes in behavior. Mentees will acquire skills in mouse behavior, in vivo physiology, immunohistochemistry and data analysis. To achieve these goals, we will spend approximately half of our time on data collection and the other half on both data analysis and a critical review of the literature. We will work within the context of research team that includes both research assistants and other undergraduates. In doing so, we will learn how to apply cutting-edge neuroscience techniques and unravel how changes in brain structure drive changes in behavior across the lifespan.\n\nMentor Biography: Kevin Mastro is a postdoc jointly mentored by two Simon’s investigators, Beth Stevens and Bernardo Sabatini. Before starting his postdoc, Kevin earned a doctorate at University of Pittsburgh with Aryn Gittis. His interest in neuroscience is focused on understanding how our genes and environment contribute to cognitive changes across the lifespan. Utilizing both ex vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics and behavior, they have uncovered a prolonged period of cognitive maturation that extends across the first six months of the mouse lifespan. Specifically, the prefrontal cortex, a critical hub for cognitive function, changes dramatically across this period of time, but how the changes in prefrontal cortex contribute the behavioral changes is an active area of exploration. More recently, the lab has been able to track the same mouse across many developmental stages and have opened up a whole new area that they are excited to pursue with your help! As a mentor, Kevin would describe his mentorship style as highly collaborative where the focus will be on building a project that will both advance our understanding of cognitive aging and provide tractable means for your progress.

Alipio\n\nMentor Role: Postdoctoral Fellow\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Amar Sahay\n\nInstitution: Massachusetts General Hospital\n\nLocation: Boston, MA\n\nLab Website: www.sahaylab.com\n\nProject Title: Experience-dependent regulation of GABAergic inhibition in aging\n\nProject Description: Hippocampal inhibitory interneurons orchestrate circuit and network activity important for memory processing and cognitive function. In Alzheimer’s disease and in the normal aging brain, memory deficits are associated with reduced inhibitory circuit functions in the hippocampus. Our lab recently demonstrated a unique form of experience-dependent structural plasticity exhibited by hippocampal parvalbumin interneurons that enables these neurons to reorganize inhibitory inputs onto pyramidal neurons to restore circuit function and cognition. We performed a gain-of-function screen to identify candidate gene regulators of this experience-dependent plasticity. Our research project involves harnessing these cell-type targeted gene regulators to restore inhibitory circuit function in aging and aging-sensitive models of Alzheimer’s disease. This project will employ inducible mouse and viral genetics, pharmaco- and optogenetics, ex vivo patch-clamp and in vivo electrophysiology, machine learning software (SLEAPai), and memory-related behavioral paradigms to test our hypotheses. Mentees will have the opportunity to acquire a conceptual framework for thinking about mechanisms of cognition in aging, build a solid foundation in circuit neuroscience, and learn new techniques to probe circuit functions in vivo.\n\nMentor Biography: Jason B. Alipio is currently a postdoctoral fellow in Amar Sahay’s lab at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School studying neural circuit mechanisms of cognitive decline in aging. Jason is a Filipino American, born and raised in California, and is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran of the Global War on Terrorism military campaign. Jason received his doctorate at the University of Maryland School of Medicine as a Meyerhoff Graduate Fellow, Graduate Program in Life Sciences Thesis awardee and received the National Research Service Award from the National Institute on Drug Abuse . His doctoral publications advanced our understanding of how opioids reshape somatosensory cortical circuit functions across the lifespan and led to creation of University of Maryland School of Medicine Center for Substance Use in Pregnancy. His postdoctoral studies, funded in part by a National Institute on Aging diversity supplement, integrate molecular, electrophysiological (ex vivo and in vivo) and behavioral approaches to understand how enhancing inhibitory circuit functions in aging reverses cognitive impairments. Jason has been involved in training and mentoring programs since the beginning of his academic journey and takes pride in mentoring trainees to achieve their own career goals.\n\nMentor Name: Anne Billot\n\nMentor Role: Postdoctoral Fellow\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Randy Buckner\n\nInstitution: Harvard University\n\nLocation: Cambridge, MA\n\nLab Website: https://bucknerlab.fas.harvard.edu\n\nProject Title: Precision brain circuit modulation in people with major depressive disorder\n\nProject Description: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is an established therapy for treatment resistant Major Depressive Disorder. Recently, FDA-approved TMS protocols using personalized targets derived from functional connectivity measures have shown improved clinical efficacy. However, the degree to which TMS engages canonical large-scale networks, as defined through precision estimates of network organization in the individual, remains unclear. This project aims to understand and enhance TMS precision by integrating within-individual network estimates to modulate specific brain networks related to distinct behavioral domains and symptoms. In this study, we will recruit both healthy individuals and individuals with treatment-resistant depression to undergo network-specific stimulation, followed by functional MRI (fMRI) and behavioral measures, to evaluate the neural and behavioral effects of targeted neuromodulation. The prospective student will learn about personalized TMS, brain network organization, and have hands-on experience collecting and analyzing fMRI and behavioral data.\n\nMentor Biography: Before working at Harvard University and the Massachusetts General Hospital, Anne Billot received a bachelor’s and a master’s degrees in speech and language pathology from the Sorbonne University, France and a doctorate in behavioral neuroscience from Boston University. Her work in the Buckner Lab focuses on characterizing the functional and behavioral consequences of precision circuit modulation in patients with depression. She is particularly interested in understanding neuroplasticity mechanisms in clinical populations with neurological or psychiatric disorders and developing personalized treatments for these individuals.\n\nMentor Name: Sara Matias\n\nMentor Role: Postdoctoral Fellow\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Naoshige Uchida\n\nInstitution: Harvard University\n\nLocation: Cambridge, MA\n\nLab Website: https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/uchidalab/home\n\nProject Title: Distributional value coding in the brain\n\nProject Description: Recent studies in our laboratory have suggested that the brain implements a new reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called distributional RL (Dabney et al., 2020; Lowet et al. 2024). While traditional RL algorithms learn the average future rewards, distributional RL learns the entire distribution of rewards. In this project, we have performed Neuropixels recording from dopamine neurons projecting to different regions of the striatum as well as multi-fiber photometry of dopamine signals using 14 fibers covering wide regions in the striatum. We have included various behavioral paradigms to probe how encoding properties of dopamine neurons differ, such as odor-reward association tasks with different reward distributions, delay discounting, novel object exploration and threat learning. The student will learn how to perform analyses on the neural data obtained in these experiments, fit computational models, including RL models, and analyze the behavior and dopamine data to test whether dopamine signals across striatal regions differ systematically in their coding properties. If the time allows, the student will further perform multi-fiber photometry experiments during behavior to further test specific hypotheses derived by earlier analyses.\n\nMentor Biography: Sara Matias is a postdoctoral fellow with Naoshige Uchida studying the functional organization of the basal ganglia-dopamine circuits in mice. In particular, she studies how specific algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL), such as distributional RL are implemented in the brain. Sara majored in biomedical engineering in Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) in Portugal. She received her graduate training in Zachary F. Mainen’s lab in Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme, Portugal, where she was involved in the development of fiber photometry techniques and studied the role of serotonin in learning and behavior. In the Uchida lab, taking advantage of her strong background in engineering, Sara has implemented new techniques for the lab, including GRIN lens-based two-photon calcium imaging from dopamine neurons as well as multi-fiber photometry using 14 fibers.

We can use this foraging context as a natural window into the neurobiological processes in the brain that instantiate flexible cognition and decision making. In this project, the student will expand upon ongoing work in the lab to characterize how mice learn about rewards in complex environments, how they make economic decisions, and how they develop strategies to forage effectively in different environments. The student will run experiments and analyze behavioral data to gain insight into how animals make decisions. Building on this foundation, we will then incorporate state-of-the-art circuit manipulation tools, such as optogenetics, to interrogate the functional role of different neural circuits in reward learning and decision making. Through this research experience, the student will learn basic wet lab skills, how to work with laboratory mice, how to rigorously analyze neuroscience data, and how to carefully design behavior experiments for neuroscience research.\n\nMentor Biography: Lyle Kingsbury is a postdoctoral fellow with Naoshige Uchida studying the biology of cognition in the brain. How do neural circuits process information from the world and perform computations that enable flexible cognition and decision making? To address this, he records neural activity from the brains of mice while they make economic decisions to forage for resources. He uses a variety of neural recording and manipulation tools, such as electrophysiology and optogenetics, to dissect the computational functions of neural circuitry.\n\nBefore coming to Harvard, Lyle completed a doctorate in neuroscience at UCLA, where he worked with Weizhe Hong on the neural mechanisms of social behavior. There, he studied how neurons in the frontal cortex represent social information and shape behavior, as well as how neural activity across individuals becomes synchronized during social interaction. As an undergraduate at Hunter College (CUNY), Lyle studied biology and bioinformatics and worked on research with Carmen Melendez on cell signaling pathways in brain glial cells.\n\nIn addition to neuroscience expertise, Lyle has extensive mentoring and teaching experience. He has taught in several undergraduate and graduate neuroscience courses at UCLA, and has mentored eight students, including one high school student, four undergraduates, and three doctoral students.\n\nMentor Name: Kevin Charland\n\nMentor Role: Graduate Student\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Catherine Kaczorowski\n\nInstitution: University of Michigan\n\nLocation: Ann Arbor, MI\n\nLab Website: https://kaczorowski.lab.medicine.umich.edu\n\nProject Title: Generation of mouse and human tri-cultures to test genes influencing the observed sex differences in pathology\n\nProject Description: I will be generating in vitro tri-cultures with neurons, astrocytes and microglia derived from both genetically-diverse mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) isolated from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Male and female mESCs will be utilized to investigate the influence of sex on various outcomes. hiPSCs will also be used to make organoids to model AD pathology in a 3D system. Cultures will be treated with beta amyloid 1-42 (Aβ42) and used to probe the influences of candidate genes that modify sex-specific differences in Aβ42 pathology. Cellular phenotypes of interest include inflammation, protein homeostasis, cellular senescence, mitochondrial functioning, cellular energetics (NAD+/NADH) and lysosomal functioning. Techniques used in this project will include various molecular assays, viral transfections, live cell imaging, immunocytochemical staining, neuronal functioning, gene expression, protein expression, computational biology, developing/optimizing derivation protocols from stem cells and general cell culturing practices. The ultimate goal of the project is to refine candidate genes identified from analyzing cortical Aβ42 abundance in AD-BXD mice and investigate the mechanisms through which they modify cellular response to Aβ42 pathology in a sex-specific and genetic background-dependent manner.\n\nQianying Wu Biography: Kevin Charland is a second-year predoctoral candidate in the neuroscience program at Tufts University. He received a bachelor’s degree in integrative neuroscience from SUNY Binghamton then a master’s degree in neuroscience from University of Hartford. While he started in the Tufts neuroscience program at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, he will be transitioning to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor with the Kaczorowski lab but will remain in the Tufts program as a visiting scholar. His current research interests include the influences of sex and genetic background in Alzheimer’s disease pathology with a current focus on cortical beta-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ42) pathology. He is also interested in the gut microbiome and its influence on the brain as well as using dietary interventions to help ameliorate various diseases. At Hartford, he received teaching assistantships for biology and anatomy/physiology labs and has experience mentoring undergraduate researchers in the lab. He received his master’s degree studying the influences of a ketogenic diet on Alzheimer’s pathology. Additionally, he was awarded the William S. and Dorothy G. Wallace Memorial Award for Academic Achievement in Neuroscience twice during his time at the University of Hartford.\n\nMentor Name: Stephanie Boas\n\nMentor Role: Postdoctoral Research Associate\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Catherine Kaczorowski\n\nInstitution: University of Michigan\n\nLocation: Ann Arbor, MI\n\nLab Website: https://kaczorowski.lab.medicine.umich.edu\n\nProject Title: Genetic Mechanisms Controlling Resilience to Huntington’s Disease\n\nProject Description: The project I envision as the best fit for a SURFiN scholar in the Kaczorowski lab (under my mentorship) is the NIH-funded project focusing on identifying drivers of resilience to Huntington’s disease (HD). For this project, we have generated a novel mouse panel, crossing an HD mouse line to the genetically-diverse BXD panel for a systems genetic approach to identify modifiers that contribute to HD resilience in a ‘humanized’ mouse population. To quantify resilience across this panel, we are evaluating BXD substrains carrying the HD transgene on various cognitive and motor tasks. The BXD panel allows for quantitative trait loci mapping to correlate genetic variants to a given phenotypic outcome. We will investigate targets identified through trait mapping to inform follow-up genetic knockout/CRISPR editing strategies using both in vitro and in vivo models. The Kaczorowski lab, and this project in particular, are ideal for a student in this program, because there is an opportunity for exposure to diverse techniques depending on the proclivities of the student. A SURFiN student could focus on: 1) behavioral phenotyping, learning to run mice on behavioral tasks; 2) genetic and behavioral characterization of novel HD resilience mouse model; and/or 3) computational analyses (trait mapping, pathway modeling).\n\nMentor Biography: Stephanie Boas is a postdoctoral research associate in the lab of Catherine Kaczorowski at the University of Michigan. Her research interests focus on understanding cell-type-specific pathogenic mechanisms across neurodegenerative diseases, and how genetic risk factors differentially impact diverse cell types and regions of the brain. Stephanie has a strong background in molecular techniques and neurodegenerative disease processes. In her graduate work at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, she studied how heterogeneous neuronal subtypes are differentially affected in rodent models of Parkinson’s in the lab of Rita Cowell. She also took advantage of several informal and formal mentorship opportunities. She trained several Cowell lab undergraduates in molecular techniques and science communication. Stephanie also mentored several summer students through the SPIN program. Additionally, she served as a teaching assistant for two semesters of biostatistics. She finds mentorship opportunities to be really energizing, both to her individually, and to the lab as a whole. While she has had incredible opportunities throughout her education, Stephanie is originally from a rural town in Illinois. She understands what it’s like to have limited exposure to academic opportunities, and how much this exposure can influence young scientists. She’s excited to be a part of programs like these that create such opportunities.\n\nMentor Name: Apoorva Arora\n\nMentor Role: Graduate Student\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Adam Kepecs\n\nInstitution: Washington University in St. Louis\n\nLocation: St. Louis, MO\n\nLab Website: https://sites.wustl.edu/kepecslab/research\n\nProject Title: Study of behavioral strategies supporting few-shot learning in rats using a LEGO-maze paradigm\n\nProject Description: We have devised a LEGO-maze to ask questions related to rapid learning, inferential reasoning and cognitive maps in rats. Our maze task is a naturalistic paradigm for rodents that are adept at exploring and remembering physical spaces. In this setting, a thirsty rat’s objective is to swiftly and correctly solve the maze to receive a water reward. One of the key questions we are after is a century-old one asked by Tolman: In a maze they know well, will rats take a newly revealed shortcut? This question underlies a key feature of biological intelligence that is lacking in modern day AI — inferential reasoning (i.e., recognition of connections between entities without directly experiencing it). Shortcuts in the maze represent such connections that can be inferred, if the maze is known well. Then, preferentially taking shortcuts — over other revealed paths that are either longer or lead to dead-ends — will reflect the rats’ inferential reasoning. In this project, you will learn how to design behavioral experiments with appropriate controls, use machine learning-based tools, like DeepLabCut, to analyze videos, learn some python programming to analyze rat’s position data, and think and talk about what is meant by intelligence.\n\nMentor Biography: Apoorva Arora is a senior graduate student in the Neuroscience Ph.D. program at Washington University in St. Louis doing her thesis project in the Kepecs Lab. She received a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from the University of Delhi, India, a master’s degree in biotechnology from Amity University, India, and a master’s degree in neuroscience from Brandeis University, MA, U.S. During this time, she worked on research related to gene cloning, radiation biology and human speech processing. She then worked as a research technician for the late John Lisman to study the molecular mechanisms of long-term memory storage. In her doctoral research, she is studying value-guided decision making in rats using fiber photometry to record mesolimbic dopamine. She has set up a LEGO maze to study rapid learning in rats. In the future, she wants to study mechanisms of brain-wide coordination of activity. Apoorva is trained on the CIMER curriculum for bench-mentoring undergraduate students in biological sciences. Since 2021, she has been mentoring undergraduates in her lab and high school students as part of the Young Scientist Program. She is also the director of St. Louis Neuroscience Outreach and regularly organizes brain carnivals for the public at the St. Louis Science Center.\n\nMentor Name: Jiayi Zhang\n\nMentor Role: Graduate Student\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Tatiana Engel\n\nInstitution: Princeton University\n\nLocation: Princeton, NJ\n\nLab Website: https://pni.princeton.edu/people/tatiana-engel\n\nProject Title: Representations of learning in RNNs\n\nProject Description: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are often used for modeling complex neurobiological activity. Neuroscientists typically train these networks to perform tasks (like decision making) and/or to reproduce activities recorded from animal brains. We can then probe the trained networks to see what gives rise to their behavior. Despite their popularity and the existence of analytical tools, many fundamental and interesting questions about RNNs remain open. For example, where is ’learning’ represented in these ’black-box’ models? An RNN is defined by its input, output and recurrent connectivity matrices, which are the (only) parameters iteratively updated during training. Therefore, if a network ’learns’ to perform some task, it must be instantiated on the changes that occur in the connectivity matrices. Which of these matrices have to change (the most)? Does a randomly initialized network have to rewire dramatically or only a little (e.g., following the ’lottery ticket hypothesis’)? How would biologically plausible constraints change learning? In this project, we will train RNNs to execute various, well-established cognitive tasks in neuroscience literature and compare their connectivity from initialization to the end-of-training to explore the questions above. Basic coding skills (e.g., Python) will be helpful; no prior experience with RNN is required.\n\nMentor Biography: Jiayi Zhang is a graduate student in the Quantitative and Computational Biology program at Princeton University. She obtained a bachelor’s in computational biology with a minor in linguistics from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2022. During her undergraduate training, Jiayi focused on applying techniques in signal processing and machine learning to solve problems spanning several disciplines, including automatic detection of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (with Rita Singh, CMU), semantic segmentation of oceanographic field images (with Lisa Gilbert, Williams College, now at Cabrillo College), and analysis of hyper-resolution spectrogram (with Marcelo Magnasco, Rockefeller University). She was also interested in science pedagogy, which motivated her to develop content for CMU Computer Science Academy (online Python programming curricula for high school students) and to serve as a teaching assistant for various courses. At Princeton, Jiayi plans to apply quantitative and computational methods she has learned to understand information encoding and computation in biological systems. Specifically, with supervision from Tatiana Engel, she now seeks to uncover circuit mechanisms driving cognitive behavior, such as perceptual decision making. She is currently working on extending a dimensionality reduction method for neural dynamics (Latent Circuit Inference, by Langdon and Engel, 2022) and applying it to large-scale neural recordings.\n\nMentor Name: Erik Toraason\n\nMentor Role: Postdoctoral Fellow\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Coleen Murphy\n\nInstitution: Princeton University\n\nLocation: Princeton, NJ\n\nLab Website: https://murphylab.princeton.edu\n\nProject Title: Identifying neuronal receptors that detect ‘todstoff’ (‘death substance’)\n\nProject Description: Organisms use multipronged strategies to navigate and survive in hazardous environments. Many species display warning signals when injured or threatened, allowing conspecifics to enact defense strategies and avoid a similar fate. For example, zebrafish exhibit panic behaviors when they smell schreckstoff (‘fright substance’); a mixture of glycosaminoglycans released by other injured fish. Warning and avoidance behaviors are therefore vital social interactions that promote the survival and propagation of species. Caenorhabditis elegans is a nematode that serves as a powerful model system to understand the molecular underpinnings of social behavior. C. elegans avoids the lysed remains of other C. elegans worms (‘negative necrotaxis’ behavior), indicating that they recognize a yet unknown signal present in other injured or deceased worms. The molecular identity of this necrotaxis cue (which we have termed ‘todstoff’ or ‘death substance’) and the receptors that sense it remain unknown.\n\nIn this project, the SURFiN fellow will employ a combination of classical genetics, behavioral assays and genome editing technologies to identify which of the over 1,300 chemoreceptor genes encoded in the C. elegans genome detect the necrotaxis cue. The fellow will work with researchers in the Murphy lab to perform a forward genetic screen to generate mutants that cannot sense the remains of other dead worms. They will then sequence the genomes of these worms to identify which genes are disrupted in these mutants. Finally, they will use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to create fluorescent reporter lines and identify the neuronal expression of these genes. Taken together, the fellow will learn classical and cutting-edge genetic and molecular biology skills and will isolate the neuronal receptors that mediate critical survival behaviors.\n\nMentor Biography: Erik Toraason completed his doctorate at the University of Oregon, where he developed genetic and computational tools in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study mechanisms that preserve the genome integrity of developing sperm and egg cells. As a postdoctoral fellow in the Murphy lab, he employs C. elegans to illuminate inter-cellular and inter-organism signaling pathways that promote survival and longevity.\n\nMentor Name: Abigail Brown\n\nMentor Role: Postdoctoral Fellow\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Coleen Murphy\n\nInstitution: Princeton University\n\nLocation: Princeton, NJ\n\nLab Website: https://murphylab.princeton.edu\n\nProject Title: Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying learned pathogenic avoidance\n\nProject Description: The inheritance of complex traits and behaviors has largely been thought to be governed thoroughly by genes. However, there has been increasing evidence of the role that non-genetic materials play in transmitting information to their progeny. Recently, work done by our lab and others have found that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) can learn to avoid the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) through small RNA training. This learned avoidance behavior is passed to their progeny, enabling them to avoid PA14 for four generations. This inherited behavior was shown to be facilitated through epigenetic means. However, how the small RNA which is ingested affects the host neurons at the molecular level to drive this aversive behavior and its inheritance remains unclear. This proposal will examine this by: 1) determining the chromatin accessibility and gene expression changes that occur in neurons, 2) determine germline and neuron-specific proteins needed for learned avoidance, and 3) determine why this inherited behavior halts after four generations. Our findings will give critical insight to the molecular mechanisms that underly complex behaviors, including those that are transgenerational.\n\nMentor Biography: Abigail Brown conducted her doctoral research in the laboratory of Ashley Webb at Brown University. The Webb laboratory seeks to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underly mammalian brain aging. During this time, she made the exciting discovery that the pro-longevity transcription factor FOXO3 functions at the chromatin level in distinct mechanisms in healthy proliferating cells and senescent cells. Presently, she is conducting her postdoctoral work in the laboratory of Coleen Murphy at Princeton University. Abigail’s current research aims to answer two main questions: 1) how animals process external stimuli that leads to behavioral changes and 2) how they pass this learned behavior to future generations.\n\nMentor Name: Xinping Li\n\nMentor Role: Postdoctoral Researcher\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Mala Murthy\n\nInstitution: Princeton University\n\nLocation: Princeton, NJ\n\nLab Website: https://murthylab.princeton.edu\n\nProject Title: Integrating sensory cues and metabolic costs in fruit fly courtship behavior\n\nProject Description: All animals perform precise movements for critical tasks such as foraging, escaping and mating. On one hand, the central nervous system processes sensory information from the external environment to pattern motor commands. On the other hand, executing these motor commands is constrained by the metabolic costs of generating muscle force. Insects, for instance, need to warm their muscles to fly, achieving this by moving their wings. Yet, how the brain integrates sensory input with energy costs to control complex movements remains unclear.\n\nThe Murthy lab uses fruit fly courtship behavior to investigate how the brain integrates sensory information to pattern complex behavior. During courtship, males and females engage in complex interactions influenced by sensory cues. In particular, male flies produce a diverse range of wing movements. We do not know to what extent their movements are constrained by the energy cost requirement to produce an optimum muscle temperature.
