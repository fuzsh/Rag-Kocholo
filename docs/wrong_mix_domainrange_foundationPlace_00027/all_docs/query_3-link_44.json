After the toll booths, take the first right turn onto the ramp for Route 18 north. Soon after you enter Route 18, take the left side of a fork in the road, staying in the right lane. Immediately bear right for an exit to US Route 1 south/Trenton. Drive south on Route 1 to the Scudders Mill Road exit (about 15 miles). Follow the ramp and turn left at the first traffic light onto Campus Drive. Follow Campus Drive to the end and turn right. You will then come to the entrance of PPPL. Stay in the left lane and stop at the Security Guard booth to present I.D. and gain clearance.\n\nFrom the WEST\n\nDriving east on Interstate 78 into New Jersey, exit onto southbound Interstate 287 (toward Somerville). Follow signs for Routes 202/206 south. Go south on 202 for a short distance and then follow signs to 206 south, which will take you around a traffic circle.
