        "text": "World-Leading Mathematicians Join IAS Faculty\n\nIrit Dveer Dinur, Elon Lindenstrauss, and Aaron Naber have been appointed to the Institute Faculty, bringing unique expertise in pure mathematics and computer science to the School of Mathematics. They will begin their Institute appointments this summer. Considered one of the top honors in academia, IAS Faculty appointments are reserved for the world’s foremost leaders in their respective fields.\n\nIAS Launches Jonathan M. Nelson Center for Collaborative Research\n\nDesigned to facilitate work on projects and topics that are beyond the reach of a single scholar, discipline, or institution, the Jonathan M. Nelson Center for Collaborative Research has been launched at IAS, expanding the Institute’s capacity for discovery across fields.\n\nA Homecoming for Amplitudes at IAS\n\nThis June, around 230 physicists and mathematicians gathered at IAS to discuss the latest developments in the field of scattering amplitudes. The roots of the Amplitudes conference, held annually since 2009, can be found in seminal papers by Edward Witten, Professor Emeritus in the School of Natural Sciences, and his collaborators.\n\nEdward Witten Receives Basic Science Lifetime Award in Theoretical Physics\n\nEdward Witten, Professor Emeritus in the School of Natural Sciences, has received the Basic Science Lifetime Award in Theoretical Physics from the International Congress of Basic Science, which is presented to scientists who have brought about fundamental change in their disciplines.\n\nInstitute Letter Spring 2024\n\nExplore how collaborative efforts have maximized mathematicians’ knowledge of minimal surfaces. Join a group of historians, theologians, and other scholars as they think together about the co-production of three religious traditions. Discover how real-life experiences of making and performing music have inspired research into a unique electronic instrument. Dine out on our archivist’s insights into achieving intimacy, illumination, and understanding over dinner.\n\ndownload the pdf explore the digital edition\n\nSnapshots of Scientific Discovery Revealed through IAS Rare Book Collection\n\nAn exhibition currently on display in the Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center celebrates how—from the Institute’s founding in 1930 to today—IAS scholars have brought that which is known into conversation with that which is newly discovered to meet the challenges of the present moment."
