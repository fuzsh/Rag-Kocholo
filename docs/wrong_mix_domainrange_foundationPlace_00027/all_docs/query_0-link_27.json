Supramolecular Polymerization of Porphyrin-Based Organic Dyes\n\nSynthesized a library of structurally complicated porphyrin derivatives with novel aggregation-triggering structural motifs, studied their supramolecular polymerization behaviors and mechanisms, revealed the relationship between their photophysical, morphological, and potentiometric properties, modulated their nanostructures using different fabrication methods (reported the first-ever free-standing monolayer nanostructure formed by covalently bridged porphyrin oligomers), and programmed their self-assembly using physical and chemical triggers.\n\n2. Drug Release from Hydrogel-Coated Microelectrode Arrays\n\nDeveloped a novel approach to surface modification of a polyimide-coated platinum–iridium microelectrode array platform, constructed drug-loaded hydrogel materials covalently anchored on the platform, and optimized the drug release profile of dexamethasone-loaded hydrogel-coated microwire arrays for brain machine interfaces designed to attenuate foreign body response in paralysis studies and treatment.\n\nResearch Publications\n\n• V.
