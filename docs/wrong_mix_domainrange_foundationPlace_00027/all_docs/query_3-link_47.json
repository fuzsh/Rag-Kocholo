        "text": "You will be part of a giant family\n\nThe word “hon” is short for the word honey, but sounds like the word “Hun”. Everyone at Hun is sweet and we stick together when we face difficulties. I chose Hun because Hun welcomes you like no other school. The people at Hun make you feel like you are part of a giant family, and everyone will always stick by your side, just like honey.\n\nElizabeth '21\n\nFeel what it is like to truly belong\n\nMy family lives in three different countries. Work brought my mom to Indonesia, my dad remains in Korea, and my sister and I go to school here in the United States. The family situation has always been like this, and it works in our own way. However, I have always craved a sense of belonging and togetherness that my family, by its nature, could not provide. Three years ago, on my first day as a boarding student at the Hun School of Princeton, I felt out of place and uncomfortable. I was in a new country, surrounded by an unfamiliar culture and foreign faces. Back then, I could not have imagined that I would find a second family here. Of course, there wasn’t a day when I just declared that Hun had become my family.\n\nThe values that constitute a family, such as love, loyalty, and unwavering support and respect for one another, cannot be fully seen at first glimpse. These values reveal themselves to you slowly, through moments and lasting feelings of warmth. When my dog in Korea died freshman year, I met girls from my dorm that I’d never spoken to before, because they came to my room and comforted me until I stopped crying. It did not matter that they did not know me, nor that I did not know them. This is just one of many memories that would follow - some filled with sadness, some with joy, but all precious when looked back upon. Now, when I am back in Korea, I find myself missing Hun, just like I miss my home when I am here. At Hun, you will not only find a sense of belonging, but feel what it is like to truly belong. Everyone who comes here eventually sees that there is a magic about this community that turns strangers into family.\n\nErika ’20\n\nSeoul, Korea"
