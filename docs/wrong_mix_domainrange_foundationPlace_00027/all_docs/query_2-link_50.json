        "text": "An educational approach to teaching and learning that uses science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics as access points for guiding student inquiry and critical thinking, STEAM is at the heart of the PDS experience. Within four state-of-the-art facilities throughout campus, students engage in problem-based and project-based approaches that help them make connections between classroom lessons and real-world experiences.\n\nGrade-level teachers accompany Lower and Middle School students to the Cook Teaching Kitchen and the Bartlett and Johnston STEAM Centers where they partake in a variety of hands-on projects to acquire a baseline of literacy in STEAM disciplines. Students in the Upper School can continue on with a rigorous program of advanced electives and independent study. By using cutting-edge and emerging technologies to design and convey ideas, our students acquire future-ready skills that benefit them long after they depart PDS."
