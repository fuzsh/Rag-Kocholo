        "text": "As a computer science major, you will learn to solve problems by looking at them from different angles, breaking them down into manageable chunks, and creating efficient solutions. As you learn to think computationally and analytically, you will tackle problems of increasing difficulty — some on your own, and others by working collaboratively in teams. And by studying in a liberal arts setting, you’ll gain a broad perspective on the implications of computer science for human well-being.\n\nThirteen courses are required to complete the major.\n\nOne year (two semesters) of calculus.\n\nTwo courses in the fundamentals of computer science and one in discrete mathematics introduce you to the field.\n\nFour intermediate-level courses (core requirements) expose you to the principles of computer science.\n\nFour courses of your choice allow you to explore applications and advanced topics of particular interest to you.\n\nYou also can arrange to take a one-on-one directed readings course with a professor on a specialized topic of your choice, or take additional computer science classes at Worcester Polytechnic Institute through the Higher Education Consortium of Central Massachusetts.\n\nBecause computer science has so many applications, it is naturally interdisciplinary. You might choose to complete a second major, a minor, or a concentration in a related area of interest. Clark’s minor in innovation and entrepreneurship is particularly relevant if you’re interested in starting a business or bringing a product to market. You might also work with a faculty member in another department on a problem of mutual interest.\n\nAt Clark, your education extends beyond the classroom. Visit the Career Connections Center to learn more about internship opportunities that complement your coursework and put your computer science knowledge into practice.\n\nThe computer science major is designed to help you learn outside the classroom. For example, as you become increasingly proficient, you will be encouraged to apply or share your knowledge of computer science. You might create an application that addresses a need on campus or in the community, or facilitates a research question. Some computer science majors volunteer to tutor students in local schools.\n\nMany students take advantage of internship opportunities during the academic year or over the summer to connect what they’re learning with their professional development. You have opportunities to sharpen your computer science skills by working as a teaching assistant, doing research, proctoring a computer lab, or serving as system, support, or technical staff in the department or for Clark’s Office of Technology Services.\n\nOther opportunities include:\n\nClark is committed to action-based learning, which means that as an undergraduate you can join faculty in their research. Our computer science professors, who conduct solid research and are passionate about teaching, have special interests in the subfields of computational complexity, quantum computing, robotics, computer simulation, bioinformatics, computer vision, human-computer interaction for people with disabilities, speech recognition, and natural language.\n\nYou can participate in research in several ways:\n\nCheck out our Diving into Research course or join a First-Year Research Group, specially designed for computer science students\n\nInitiate your own research project under the guidance of a faculty member\n\nWork with a Clark professor on his or her research\n\nWork with a professor or in a research lab at another institution during the summer\n\nYou can also apply for funding to support your own research on a project of your choice during the academic year or during the summer.\n\nAt Clark you’ll get more than a great education; you’ll also be prepared for a long, productive career and life of consequence. And once you’ve completed your degree, you can join other Clark alumni who have gone on to work for great organizations and attend some of the best graduate schools in the world.\n\nOur computer science major provides a solid foundation for students who want to apply their knowledge in other fields, as well as for those who want to study computer science in graduate school.\n\nGraduate School Placement\n\nGraduate schools attended by computer science graduates from Clark include:\n\nPh.D. in Computer Science, at Johns Hopkins University, University of California at San Diego; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; University of Massachusetts at Amherst; Boston University: University of Chicago\n\nM.S. in Computer Science, at Brown University; Carnegie Mellon University; Georgia Tech; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Yale University; University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign; University of Pittsburgh\n\nM.S. in Computational and Mathematical Finance and other business-related fields, at Oxford Business School; University of Chicago; Clark University Graduate School of Management\n\nOther fields: J.D., Cornell University Law School and University of Maryland Law School; M.D., Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine; M.A.T. (Teaching), Clark University"
