        "text": "Great office. They were able to take me in right away due to emergency. Everyone was very pleasant. They use an iPad to do your patient history and the info goes to them immediately so you know they are reviewing it while working. The computer can toggle between your file and xrays and cable TV. The doctor and his assistants explained everything they were about to do and doing. I am among those who very much dislike going to the dentist so this was a great experience for me.\n\nLauren Ugorji\n\non Google\n\nThe most thorough cleaning Iâ€™ve ever had. Erica was excellent. The office takes full precautions around COVID with new protocol and equipment, even wiping down the X-ray vest after I used it. They take X-rays and pictures so I was able to see the things they were talking about with regard to my teeth. Dr. Hanian was very friendly and explained everything he saw but was not at all pushy about getting tooth work done - just offered clear guidance to inform my thinking.\n\nSandy Noyelle\n\non Google\n\nDr. Hanian is great! My Invisalign is coming along GREAT thanks to him! His staff, Kiara, Stephanie, Danielle, Mimi, Rashem & Erica are top notch!! The luck of finding this place. Needless to say I would NEVER leave. It feels like home, minus the crazy family members. Thanks Dr. Hanian!!!\n\nKiara Jefferson\n\non Google\n\nThe staff is courteous and helpful. The doctor and his staff took time to answer my questions. I was very impressed with the technology and the end result of my visit. I felt very safe during my visit. The office has gone out of its way to ensure patient safety.\n\nLeslie Daise\n\non Google\n\nThis office hums with professionalism, and people that are happy to Work there. Dr. Hanian is a fantastic dentist, with a great eye for Great results. They are very accommodating, have been a satisfied Patient for many years....\n\nDoris Shea\n\non Google\n\nMy wife and I have been going to Princeton Dentistry for many years. Dr. Hanian is an excellent dentist. He is very caring, very thorough and he has an excellent bedside manner. His staff is very competent as well. I am always greeted cheerfully by the office staff and the hygienists are very professional and cheerful. The office and examination rooms are very clean and tidy. Each exam room has a television that you can watch during your examination. I highly recommend Princeton Dentistry.\n\nScreamin' E.\n\non Google"
