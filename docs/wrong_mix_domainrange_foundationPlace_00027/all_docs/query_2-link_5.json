        "text": "The New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) and Princeton have issued a request for information (RFI) to be applied in developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Hub, based at the University, to promote and integrate AI applications.\n\nThe RFI seeks to collect input around best practices and operational insights and to learn from companies and other parties about their interest in engaging with the hub. Feedback received will help NJEDA and University leaders better understand the scope and characteristics of the hub, with a particular focus on opportunities for collaboration with the private sector.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy joined Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber on campus in December to announce plans for the hub. “Together we will leverage Princeton’s leadership in AI and the strengths of the central New Jersey region to establish an integrated hub of AI activity,” Eisgruber said. Last week, Murphy returned to campus for the University-hosted New Jersey AI Summit.\n\nExtensive information and instructions on replying to the RFI are on the NJEDA website. Responses are due by May 31.\n\nFor more information on Princeton’s artificial intelligence initiatives, visit AI at Princeton."
