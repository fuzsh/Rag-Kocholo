        "text": "Coding is a quick way to refer to computer programming in general. Many programming languages enable us to communicate with computers. People write codes that instruct computers to take specific actions and follow instructions. If you live in New Jersey, you can learn coding through live online classes or in-person at a location nearby.\n\nCoding classes teach students to put concepts into practice through hands-on instruction in the skills needed for various fields, from processing data to developing websites and apps to creating machine learning algorithms. The wide range of available coding classes means students can choose the specialization that most interests them. Enroll in a coding class today and learn one of the hottest skills to enhance any resume!\n\nWhy High Schoolers Should Learn Coding\n\nCoding is a great skill to have for a summer or part-time job, particularly in NJ, where there are so many tech companies throughout the state. You can also take coding classes to prepare for college courses, build skills for a future career, list as a skill on college applications, or prepare for the AP Computer Science Exam. As a New Jersey high school student, you already know that the state has a wealth of high-ranking colleges and universities, so learning coding now gives you an application advantage. Rutgers University, The College of New Jersey, New Jersey Insitute of Technology, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Montclair State all offer academic paths that include the various types of coding.\n\nJobs of all sorts have become more digitized than ever, so applicants must be digitally fluent. Students with coding skills are on track for high-paying software and other coding-related job opportunities. Coding classes can be the perfect way for high school students to prepare for the job market.\n\nIn-Person Coding Classes in NJ\n\nIf youâre a high schooler who learns best in a classroom setting, Noble Desktop offers Full-Stack Web Development Certificate, which is a 240-hour course for $6,995. NJ Transit trains provide easy transportation to Nobleâs location, just a few blocks from Penn Station. The course teaches students to become Full Stack Developers and work on all parts of a web application.\n\nOther local schools offering in-person coding classes in New Jersey are NextGen Bootcamp and Rutgers Bootcamps. NextGen offers Web Development Summer Certificate, a four-week course that prepares high school students to become web developers. Students work on real-world projects and master HTML, CSS, and FTP. They also use JavaScript, jQuery, advanced CSS, and Bootstrap to boost their skills.\n\nRutgers Bootcamps offers Coding Bootcamp and Data Science Bootcamp. The 24-week Data Science Bootcamp is an immersive introduction to data science. The 12-week Coding Bootcamp prepares students to enter the web development field with topic coverage, including full-stack development tools such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap, and jQuery.\n\nVirtual Coding Classes\n\nYou may be a student who prefers to learn from the comfort of your home. If so, virtual coding summer classes for high school students are perfect for you. They are live online, interactive, and hands-on. Students can ask questions in real-time, and instructors can see and control studentsâ screens with permission.\n\nNextGen Bootcamp offers the Computer Science Summer Certificate Program Live Online, which teaches high school students to master the basics of Java and Python for a head start on the AP Computer Science Exam. Students also learn the fundamentals of data science and machine learning.\n\nIf youâre interested in Python for data science and machine learning, consider enrolling in the Python Data Science Summer Program Live Online. Students use Python for data analysis projects and focus on data science using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.\n\nProgramming beginners with little or no experience should enroll in NextGenâs Java Programming Summer Program Live Online, which begins with the basics and progresses to high-level topics, such as object-oriented programming and recursion.\n\nNextGen also offers Web Design Summer Program Live Online for aspiring web designers. Students learn to design, code, and layout webpages using Sketch, learn best practices for structuring and tagging content, and go live with their websites.\n\nHow to Choose a Coding Class\n\nAs a prospective coding-class student, you likely have questions about each course's cost, duration, learning level, and age range. All this information is available in the course descriptions, which you should read carefully before enrolling. Many coding classes are specifically meant for high school students and take place throughout the summer, mostly on weekdays, and range from 30 to 100 total hours.\n\nNobleâs NYC summer coding bootcamps are listed as âopen to beginners,â so they are available for high school students with no prior experience. The same applies to NextGenâs live online coding courses. Be sure to confirm that a course is offered in your preferred learning formatâin-person or live onlineâbefore enrolling."
