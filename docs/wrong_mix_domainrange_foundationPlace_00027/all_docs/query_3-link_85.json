Once approved, Jean can help organize your event.\n\nPet Guidelines\n\nThese guidelines are intended to consider the health and safety issues surrounding pets in the workplace, as consideration needs to be taken for people who may be allergic and/or afraid of animals. These guidelines do not apply to service animals.\n\nPets are not permitted in labs, common areas or shared office spaces. Only individuals with private offices may bring their pets to Sherrerd Hall. If you have an official support animal and are in a shared office, please talk to Tithi or Laura about requesting an official accommodation.\n\nExcept when entering or exiting the building, your pet should be contained in your individual office at all times.\n\nWalking with your pet throughout the hallways should be limited to entering and exiting the building only.\n\nYour pet should be on a short enough leash that it cannot rush, attack, panic, nip at, or in some other way harm others. Pets should be well-behaved and not aggressive toward others.\n\nPrinceton law says that dogs must be on leashes. New Jersey law mandates the leash must be no longer than eight feet long, and the dog must be under your control at all times.\n\nRoaming throughout the building on or off a leash is not permitted.\n\nPlease be sure to clean up after your pet.\n\nPrinter\n\nInstruction on how to connect your device is on the bulletin board in the mailroom, or you can contact Laura or Jean and they will you send instructions.

Please see their website to join the group and for more information about their events and collaborations.\n\nResearch Expense Accounts/Reimbursements/Purchasing\n\nIf you are given a research/travel expense account and/or have been approved to purchase items/travel on behalf of CITP, please make sure you read the following information thoroughly:\n\nThe center and the University’s administration (the Office of Finance and Treasury and the Office of the Dean of Faculty) reserve the right to deny any expense reimbursement requests if we feel they do not align with CITP policies and the University’s guidelines, policies, and procedures. Please contact Laura if you have any questions regarding potential reimbursement issues. CITP may be stricter than University guidelines on some items due to stewardship of gifts and grants.\n\nAll reimbursements must be done through Concur, which is Princeton University’s travel and expense program. You must have a Princeton netID and password to login, and set up a profile. Please designate Laura Cummings-Abdo as your Expense Delegate and Expense Approver. (Please note both designations are now required for a report to be approved, as Laura must be able to see and edit all reports. Laura can help you set up your Concur account.\n\nUniversity affiliates may not pay for guest reimbursements on their personal credit card and then request reimbursement for that person. All speaker/guest travel expenses must be vetted through the University.\n\nThe University has a Marketplace and it encourages all faculty, staff and visitors to go to it first to purchase items before looking at outside vendors. You must login to Prime to access the Marketplace. Please note that Amazon has been added to the Marketplace in fall 2023, and the University will not allow personal reimbursement for Amazon charges; you must use the Marketplace to purchase anything from Amazon.\n\nExpense notes:\n\nThe University requires receipts for expenses of $50 or more. Photograph or scan these receipts and attach them to your expense report in Concur. CITP may require receipts for expenses less than $50, please see see below.\n\nCITP does not generally reimburse fellows for meals between other University affiliates (faculty, staff, fellows, students, etc.) even if you are discussing business (unless it is an official center sponsored event).\n\nAll meal receipts need to be detailed receipts, and not summary credit card receipts. Please note that alcohol alone will not be reimbursed, but is allowable if it is included in a group business meal. Individual meal costs should stay in accordance with the GSA guidelines for the city one is visiting, but please keep all receipts. Further, if a conference provides meal(s), reimbursement cannot be requested for that meal, even if the meal was not utilized.\n\nWhen traveling to/from NJ/NY area airports from the Princeton area, the most economical ground transportation should be used whenever possible, which is NJ Transit, as it operates 21 hours per day. If you choose to take an Uber/Lyft to the airport, you will only be reimbursed for the amount it would have cost to take NJ Transit, unless you have a special circumstance and get prior approval and/or document the issue. The total cost for a NJ Transit train from Princeton to the Newark airport is $21.25 as of January 2022. If you use an Uber/Lyft to go to/from your home to Princeton Junction, please upload that receipt.\n\nCITP will pay for economy airfare, one bag and all reservations should be made 14 days in advance, if possible. Most upgrades and onboard Internet will not be reimbursed unless approved in advance. Further, when traveling internationally all federal grant paid flights must comply with the FlyAmerica act. You can easily see if your flight is in compliance, as the Princeton shield will be to the right of the flight information.\n\nIf reimbursement/travel expenses are requested for attendance at a conference, the conference link or program must be provided when requesting reimbursement.\n\nPlease make sure you are specific and fill out the information for the business purpose for each expense. For example, if you are requesting reimbursement for breakfast, the expense category is Individual Meal and the business purpose would be “breakfast.” If you are taking ground transportation from the San Francisco airport to your hotel, the business purpose would be “SFO to hotel.”\n\nSoftware for home computers may not be purchased with research account funds. The University owns rights to most but not all software.\n\nAny hardware items purchased using any type of Princeton funds (expense, research, travel funds, and including laptops, iPads, etc.) must be returned to CITP at the end of your appointment period, as all equipment purchased with University funds is the property of Princeton University.\n\nYou are required to submit a Concur report for any expenses you have incurred the previous month. All expenses must be substantiated via a Concur expense report within 60 days of being incurred, or the reimbursement may be subjected to personal tax.\n\nFor more information on Princeton’s expense policies, please refer to the Finance and Treasury website.\n\nFor more information about using your CITP research/travel account for business travel, please refer to the University Travel Policy or contact Laura Cummings-Abdo with any questions or concerns.\n\nRoom Reservations\n\nPlease email Jean to be added to the CITP room reservation calendars or if you need to find other space on campus for meeting/conference needs.\n\nSales Tax Exempt\n\nPrinceton is sales tax exempt and the policy can be found here. We should make every effort not to pay sales tax to vendors, especially in New Jersey. This does not generally apply to out-of-state travel or conference expenses, but it does apply to general office purchases and/or in-town purchases. We are asked to use Princeton Marketplace for all purchases whenever possible. This includes using W.B. Mason over Amazon for office supplies, although we do have sales tax exempt status with Amazon. Please see Jean or Laura to help with any purchases using University funds.\n\nSlack and Zoom\n\nCITP has Slack channels that we use in a variety of ways to communicate. Use of Slack is by invite only, so please contact Laura or Jean to be added.\n\nWhen using Zoom you should connect through Princeton’s version. Please click here for more details. If you are using Zoom from another institution, you may have limited capabilities.\n\nTelephone and Voicemail\n\nMost (but not all) offices at CITP have landline phones but are not set up specific to individuals who share offices. To call out using a University phone, dial 9 and then the number. To dial within the University dial 8 and then the last four digits of the phone number.\n\nIf you have an individual office, Princeton University has adopted the Microsoft Unified Messaging (UM) service, and it can bring together your voicemail, email, and calendaring functions along with other beneficial features."
