        "text": "Cranford, NJ – Eight UCNJ Union College of Union County, NJ students have been selected to participate in Princeton University’s Transfer Scholars Initiative summer program. This highly selective program offers an exceptional opportunity for students to take courses at Princeton for free.\n\nFrom June 29 through August 16, eight UCNJ students will enroll in a full-time, eight-week academic curriculum, taking two credit-bearing Princeton courses at no cost to the student. When not in classes, students have the opportunity to connect with Princeton faculty, students, and receive transfer success programing to guide them for transferring after completing their associate degree at UCNJ. Transfer Scholars also receive a stipend to cover expenses, including travel, and will be able to live on campus. The eight scholars from UCNJ attending the summer intensive at Princeton are:\n\nNyiera Eliscar, from Linden, studying early childhood elementary education\n\nLuis Fiallos, of Plainfield, majoring in engineering\n\nRoger Fortunato, from Newark, studying computer science\n\nIzabella Kopacz, from Summit, majoring in visual arts\n\nAngel Maldonado, of Elizabeth, pursuing a liberal studies degree\n\nDanielle Marie Baez, from Elizabeth, studying architecture\n\nOmowonuola Oyedele, from Woodbridge, pursuing a degree in engineering, and\n\nLaura Shubert, of Springfield, majoring in architecture\n\n“We are incredibly proud of our eight student-scholars who were selected to attend the Princeton summer program. Their acceptance is a testament to their hard work and the high-quality education they have received at UCNJ. This opportunity will contribute to their continued success, and we cannot wait to see what their next steps will be in their academic journey,” stated UCNJ President Dr. Margaret M. McMenamin.\n\nFor more information on Princeton’s Summer Intensive program, go to https://tsi-ebcao.princeton.edu/."
