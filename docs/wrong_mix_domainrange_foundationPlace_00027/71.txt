Being a college town, Princeton probably has more computers as residents than people. Everyone uses a computer for something, whether you are a student, professor or just a regular Joe doing your job. However, computers are susceptible to viruses and system failures, usually at the most inopportune times. When you see the blue or black screen of death or your system is slowing to a crawl, come see us at Cellairis.

Cellairis is known for cell phone repair and accessories. Our name reflects our expertise with these devices. However, that is not all we do. Our technicians are certified to repair other devices like tablets and computers, all with the same precision and attention to quality. We repair PCs and Macs using top-quality replacement components, right in our store near Princeton. You will find us in the malls and Walmarts where you already shop, making it quick and convenient to get the help you need.
