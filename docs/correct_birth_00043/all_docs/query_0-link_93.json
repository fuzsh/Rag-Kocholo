        "text": "By Eric Hansen\n\nOriginally published at Nautilus on October 17, 2013.\n\nIt’s a warm summer afternoon in New York City, and Bob and Mike Bryan are hitting the fuzzy covers off tennis balls, their looping forehands and backhands mirror images of one another. The identical twins are warming up for the U.S. Open on one of the trademark blue courts in the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Playing singles against each other, Bob hits a soft volley. Mike returns it with a hard shot at Bob’s head and calls out, “Velveeta.” Cheesy shot.\n\nThe Bryans take their customary position beside each other and face their coach David Macpherson and practice partner Georgy Chekhov. Although Bob is two inches taller and a leftie, the lanky, brown-eyed Bryans appear to be clones of one another. They glide across the court, perfectly in sync. A low ball sent down the middle does nothing to stymie them. Bob knows instinctively that Mike’s got it. Mike rifles a shot down the center.\n\nPractice ends and the twins walk in stride toward the stands, where they sign autographs. Chekhov, marveling at the brothers’ skill, says to me, “They just feel each other out there. It’s at the DNA level.”"
