        "text": "Michael Bryan, 67, of Ladoga, passed away on Sunday, May 5, 2024 at his home.\n\nMike was born November 3, 1956 in Indianapolis, Indiana to the late Benjamin and Patricia (Miller) Bryan. He was a 1975 graduate of Lebanon High School and was united in marriage to Pamela Witt in September of 1977.\n\nMike owned Ladoga Tire Service, which he operated with his father for 38 years. He subsequently worked for FedEx from 2006 until 2012.\n\nHe is survived by his wife and best friend, Pam Bryan of Ladoga; his daughters, Aimee (Andy) Heacox of Greenfield, and Mallory (Ben) Slaton of Columbus; his grandchildren, Addison, Andrew and Avery Heacox, and Grant and Reid Slaton; his sisters, Susan Eilert and Tricia (Rodger) Stinson; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents and brother-in-law, Rick Eilert.\n\nMike loved sports and was Purdue's number one fan. Before he passed, he had hoped to see Purdue reach the Final Four. Mike realized this dream with his family, and tears were streaming down his face. That moment was priceless and unforgettable. Mike had season tickets to Purdue's football and basketball games over the years and would attend games with his father, children, sons-in-law, and grandchildren. Mike was also an Indy Car fan, attending the Indy 500 for most of his life, and later taking annual trips to races in Iowa.\n\nIf he wasn't watching college or professional sports, he was at the ballpark watching his grandkids. Nothing made Mike prouder than watching his grandkids play softball, baseball, basketball, volleyball and wrestling. He never missed a Grandparents Day at school.\n\nMike was hilarious and quick-witted, but also kind, sensitive, and loving. He enjoyed regular trips with Pam and his family to the mountains in Gatlinburg, the beaches in Florida, and the rolling hills in Iowa.\n\nMike attended Roachdale Christian Church and Ladoga Christian Church. He was a member and Past Master of Ladoga F & AM Lodge #187.\n\nMike bravely fought pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer since his diagnosis in July of 2012. He was passionate about learning more about this rare disease and helping others in the process.\n\nA Celebration of Life Service will be held at Ladoga Christian Church with Rev. Bob Vice officiating on Friday, May 10, 2024 at 1:00p.m. with visitation beginning at 11:00am until service time. A graveside service will follow at Ladoga Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be made through Servies & Morgan Funeral Home to Neuroendocrine Tumor Research Foundation. https://netrf.org/get-involved/give-now/ You are invited to visit www.serviesmorgan.com where you may leave a condolence or share a memory with the family. Servies & Morgan Funeral Home has been entrusted with the funeral arrangements."
