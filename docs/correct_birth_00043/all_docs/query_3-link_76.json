Worth headquarters of American Airlines as one of the airline’s 2016 Flight Service Champions.\n\nAmerican honored 321 flight attendants from the 28,000 across their system, who were chosen based on customer feedback, peer nominations and recommendations from managers. Nominees were evaluated on five key criteria that make up the AA five-star customer experience: customer focus, teamwork, flexibility, upholding the AA image, and professionalism.\n\nMike is a Purser for American, the lead flight attendant in charge of passenger cabin safety and customer service on transoceanic flights. Only 10 percent of AA’s flight attendants are Purser-qualified.\n\nMike is a graduate of Jackson High School. He is a 28-year veteran of the airline."
