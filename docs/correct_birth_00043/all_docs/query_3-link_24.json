        "text": "Happy hour was banned in Massachusetts in 1984. The law was put into effect because of a young girl who lost her life in a drunk driving accident. It may be close to coming back, however, because the Massachusetts Senate has recently adopted an amendment in favor of bringing it back. Senators cited it would help boost the economy, according to Boston.com.\n\nHere are five of the best bars in Boston to go to first when it's finally adopted into law.\n\nThe Tam, Boston\n\nIf you're looking for a dive bar where you can literally wear whatever you want and stay until 2am, the Tam is the place. It's an Irish pub, so they had me at hello, but don' think that you are going to have a great dinner. It's not the place for that. You drink at the Tam. 2 for 1 Twisted Tea? That's an idea for happy hour.\n\nSullivan's Tap, Boston, Massachusetts\n\nI know, I know, what can I say? Another Irish pub? Yes. I'm a Sullivan, so that's kind of what I look for. Sullivan's Tap is always a great place to go if you are priming up for a concert or game at TD Garden. You can walk to it. Imagine if happy hour comes back? That's what people do; go get drinks at a local place before the Garden charges you up the wazoo for a bottle of water.\n\nREAD MORE: Boston, Massachusetts, Bars Do Not Have Happy Hour, and Here's the Dark Reason Why\n\nThe Burren, Somerville, Massachusetts\n\nAgain with the Irish! I should have put 'Irish' in the headline, but I didn't. I LOVE THE BURREN. It's everything you could want in a pub, with comfort food, beer, wine, cocktails and live music. The pub is just outside of Boston in Somerville, which doesn't have as much going on as Bean Town, but for me, that's a good thing. The menu is excellent too. Lots of choices for the meat-eater and vegetarian/vegan alike.\n\nThe Rooftop at the Envoy\n\nIf you want to go a little fancy, the Rooftop at the Envoy might be a great choice. Located in the Seaport District on top of a hotel? Perfect. That way, if you have a couple fancy drinks and don't want to drive home, you can just get a room. Convenient!\n\nLegal Seafood, Harborside\n\nHappy hour at a Boston seafood restaurant could mean 2 for 1 oysters, I'm just sayin'. It doesn't have to be all about the booze. After all, if the restaurant offers some good deals on their food, the chances of patrons sticking around goes way up.\n\nIf happy hour passes, you'll be the first one to know, and you and I will take a road trip and hit every one of these places.\n\nI should mention that the amendment to bring back happy hour would be a local option for individual communities. They can decide whether or not they want to offer happy hour discounts."
