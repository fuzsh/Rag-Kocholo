        "text": "Bryan Derald Feda was born on May 7th, 1963 to Derald and Eileen Feda.\n\nHe is survived by his mother Eileen, Sister's Barbara (Pete), Beverly (Mike), daughter Amanda (Chris), and his son's Nick (Zaryn) and Michael. He leaves behind 4 grandchildren Makenna, Bowyn, Sophie, and Lucas.\n\nBryan spent his childhood summers in Alexandria where he learned his first love of fishing when he was brought fishing on a local lake. This grew to be Bryan's one true passion. Bryan served in the Army in the 80's. During his time in the service, he was stationed in the Yakima desert and in Germany gathering a great number of stories he would tell for years. After leaving the army, Bryan began working as a CNA, and found his second love-Nursing. Bryan went on to obtain his LPN followed by his RN taking the last written NCLEX exam in MN. Bryan worked as an RN within the Healtheast float pool for many years. With many changes in the metro hospital system Bryan eventually took a position as an LTACH (Long term acute care) RN from which he retired in 2023. During his years Bryan developed many friendships that would last from childhood through the present. Bryan spent his summers at Mackies, on a lake in his boat, and playing cribbage with friends and family. In the winter you would likely find Bryan complaining that it was not fishing season, performing retail therapy (usually buying way too many of one lure), and waiting for summer impatiently. He was a caring and loving man who cared deeply for his family and friends. Anyone who had the privilege to meet Bryan likely had the opportunity to laugh to the point of aching abs, or experience sunburn while waiting for a fish to bite. He will be greatly missed by many.\n\nPreceded in death by his dad Derald Feda.\n\nA celebration of life is scheduled for Tuesday, June 18th, 2024 at Richard Walton Park in Oakdale, MN from 2pm-6pm. At the request of the family, please do not send flowers."
