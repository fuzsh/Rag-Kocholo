        "text": "WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W. Va.âSome babies have all the fun. Mike Bryan's son Jake was born just 10 weeks ago but he's already got his own Instagram.\n\nHe's also already logging travel miles as hisÂ first road trip was followed quickly by his first flight. Little Jake is in town for the 45th season of World TeamTennis, where he'll get to explore the sprawling grounds via stroller and meet some fellow tennis babies like SamÂ Querrey's son Ford.\n\nFord Querrey (left) with Jake Bryan. (Jake Bryan's Instagram)\n\nThe two babies watched their dads compete on Sunday for the Las Vegas Rollers.Â Bob Bryan doesn't have his three young children with him for the three-week season, but he'll be kept busy as Uncle Bob. Of course, Mike's wife Nadia is on hand as well.\n\n\"I have a newfound respect for what Bob's done the last five to eight year with the kids on the road,\" Mike Bryan said. \"Because IÂ just brought Jake on his first plane ride over here to West Virginia and it's not easy. He's crying, you don't know what to do. You just want to take care of him and the priorities have shifted.\"\n\nTo Jake's credit, he didn't make a peep during his dad's first match, which Las Vegas lost 24-18 to Chicago.\n\nThe Bryan twins on the sidelines while competing for the Las Vegas Rollers. (Ryan Loco)\n\nJake is following in the footsteps of his oldest cousin Micaela, who was once the most popular Bryan baby in the tennis Twitter-sphere. Micaela is now eight and her brothersÂ are six (Bobby Jr.) and four (Richie).\n\n\"Bob was always strapped for time,\" Mike Bryan said. \"We'd finish a match, he'd jump in the car and off to the waterpark with the kids or whatever it is. So just juggling all that, hats off. Luckily, I won'tÂ have to do itÂ for many years.\""
