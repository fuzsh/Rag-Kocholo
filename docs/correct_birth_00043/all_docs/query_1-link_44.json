        "text": "Howard Lee “John\" Jarman, 87, of Deep Run, passed away on Friday, July 12, 2024 surrounded by family. John was born in Lenoir County on June 12, 1937 to the late Clarence “Doc” Jarman and Betty Cauley Jarman. John was a proud Army veteran with service in Germany and later retired from DuPont with over 30 years of service. John was a Mason and member of Webbs Chapel Methodist Church at Sandy Bottom. John was a true country boy in his bib overalls and could be found most mornings at Fat Baby’s Country Cooking talking about his tobacco patch days and offering his current political views. John loved western movies, Gunsmoke, western comic books, bluegrass music, and driving his tractor around the farm.\n\nJohn was predeceased by his brothers, Russell, Elwood, Bill and J.C.; sister, Becky, and an infant twin sister. He is survived by numerous nieces and nephews and leaves behind his best feline friend, Miss Kitty. John was a beloved adopted member of the Billy Smith family, including Donna, Clint, Christy, Gabriel, Colby, Kristen, and Laney.\n\nSpecial thanks are extended to Sam Smith and staff of Goldsboro Retirement Center, Ann Moody, Larry Boyette, Dennis Heath, and David Cowley who cared for John in his later years."
