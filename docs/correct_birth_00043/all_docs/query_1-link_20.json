They were coached by David Macpherson between 2005 and 2016. In January 2017 they reunited with coach Phil Farmer, who previously trained them to their first grand slam title, the French Open men's doubles.[3] In October 2017, Macpherson and Dr. Dave Marshall assumed coaching duties, with Marshall handling day-to-day responsibilities, until the duo retired.[citation needed]"
