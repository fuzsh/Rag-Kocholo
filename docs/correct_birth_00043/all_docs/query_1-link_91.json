Larry was born on April 9, 1950, to the late Alvin Turner Weddington and Margie Louise Allman Weddington.\n\nHe served his country in the U.S. Navy and flourished in his career in the fiber industry. He found joy in hunting, fishing, golf, and baseball. Larry had a passion for archery and was crowned the South East archery NFAA/NAA Champion. He loved the beach, where he enjoyed shag dancing. Larry also enjoyed tending to his garden.\n\nLeft to cherish his memory are his daughter, Amy Weddington; his fiancee, Constance “Connie” Congdon; and siblings, Garry Weddington (Nell), Karen Baxter (Sonny), Mike Weddington (Teresa), and Dwight Weddington (Julie); and nieces and nephews, Benn Weddington, Bryan Weddington (Erin), Emily Weddington, Philip Baxter (Jo-Marie), Keith Baxter, Kim Ezzell, Cole Weddington, Summer Weddington, Jessica Juhaish (Brandon), Travis Weddington and Joseph Weddington; along with great nieces and nephews and one great-great nephew.\n\nThe Weddington family invites friends and loved ones to honor Larry’s life at his funeral service on Wednesday, July 17, 2024, at 11 a.m. at West Corinth Baptist Church in Mooresville. Rev. Rob Suttles will preside over the ceremony, followed by a burial at the church cemetery.\n\nPrior to the service, a visitation will be held on Tuesday, July 16, 2024, from 6 to 8 p.m. at Cavin-Cook Funeral Home in Mooresville.
