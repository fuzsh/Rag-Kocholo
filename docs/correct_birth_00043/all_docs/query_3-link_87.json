        "text": "“When we build, let us think we build forever. Let it not be for present delight nor present use alone. Let it be such work as our descendants will thank us for. Let us think, as we lay stone on stone, that a time is to come when those stones will be held sacred because our hands have touched them, and that men will say, as they look upon the labor and wrought substance of them, “See! This our father did for us!” ~ John Ruskin\n\nSurrounded by family in his final days, Michael E. Bryan of South Bend, IN passed away peacefully in his home as was his wish, after a three-month illness on August 4, 2023. Mike was an accomplished builder…of local landmark buildings and of family and friendships.\n\nHe was born on March 18, 1945 in South Bend, IN to Juanita (Hendrickson) Marsh and raised by her and his stepfather, Peter K. Fast. He attended South Bend Washington High School, and shortly after his graduation in 1963, he met his life’s love, Geraldine F. Vargo and began their 60-year love story. Following her graduation there in 1965, Mike and Geri married at Saint Adalbert’s Catholic Church in South Bend on January 8, 1966, honeymooned at Niagara Falls, NY, and soon brought two sons into the world, Ronald in Oct., 1966 and Michael in Dec., 1968.\n\nMike’s favorite course in high school was Shop, and he turned his love of construction into a lifelong career, designing and managing projects for Cole Associates, Hickey Construction, MPA Architects, Ira Mast, and more. Notable creations and renovations include the previous Saint Joseph County Jail, Bittersweet Public Library, the new Riley High School, Beacon Health’s Pfeil Center, Teachers Credit Union bank branches, various Northern Indiana elementary and secondary schools, and Notre Dame University buildings. On a smaller scale, his poured his woodworking talent into many treasured family gifts. His architectural handwriting and even his signature were true art, and his passion for solid construction will have a positive impact on many for many years to come. His motto was, “If you are going to do a job, do it right, or don’t do it at all.”\n\nMike played softball (#3, his favorite) in the 1970’s in area softball leagues. His knuckleball danced in mid-air. Win or lose, he enjoyed taking his family to Bonnie Doon’s after many games. Mike bowled in the renowned Monday Night Builders League at Chippewa Lanes for 40 years, anchoring his Moeller-Makris and Art Mosaic & Tile teams with a near-200 average and serving at times as League President and Secretary. He and Geri also bowled in a Couples League on Sunday Nights in the early 1980’s.\n\nMike’s favorites included James Bond and Indiana Jones movies, Elvis Presley music, lasagna, M & M’s, Caribbean and Hawaiian cruise vacations with Geri, Notre Dame football and basketball, his ‘PT Cruisers’ social gatherings (including the guys’ monthly WESAP “we solve all problems” gatherings), countless puzzles and naps, family poker and Uno nights, Vargo weddings and reunions, his special ‘Bryan Handshake’ reserved for family only, and small-lake fishing…first at Potato Creek State Park and later at his cherished cottage with Geri on Atwood Lake, where he spent 30+ summers taking in bluegill and sunsets. His dearly-departed canine companions, Riley, Cody, and Molly are all happily reunited at his side in Heaven.\n\nLet it be recorded too that in his final two weeks, Mike took on an entirely unexpected, most peculiar, full and charming British personality and accent! Research suggests that such an occurrence is extremely rare, documented fewer than 100 times in a world population of billions in the last 115 years. It was quite a sight and sound to behold! And it is fitting that Mike should therefore go into history as truly one in 100 million!\n\nLeft to cherish Mike’s memory are Geri, his wife of 57 years; sons Ronald A. (Connie) Bryan and Michael E. (Cindy) Bryan; grandchildren Derek M.P. (Lauren) Bryan, Lauren M. (Chris) Todd, Jonathan C. Bryan, Madison Bryan, and Zachary Bryan; five great-grandchildren Leighton, Liam, and Callum Bryan and Michael and Allison Todd; and Godsons Daniel Rojics, Keith West, and James Vargo. Mike was preceded in death by his parents and by his sister, Sheila I. Rojics.\n\nMike and Geri were parishioners of Saint Jude Parish for nearly 50 years. Cremation has taken place, and interment will be at Sacred Heart Catholic Cemetery in Lakeville, IN. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Mike’s name to Pet Refuge at https://www.petrefuge.com/donate-notes."
