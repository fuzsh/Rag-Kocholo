        "text": "On April 12th, we said goodbye to our favorite man. Born in Wayne County, North Carolina, he was the son of the late Troy Miller and Sarah Shearin Bryan. Mike was a Veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a member of the American Legion Post 11. To know him was to love him, he never met a stranger. You could always catch him smiling the most with his grandbabies. We know he is in no pain, free as a bird, and in heaven in his own ocean forever sailing away.\n\nMike is survived by his wife, June Pate Bryan; his sister, Gloria Kornegay; his daughters, Melissa Pearce (Roy), Cori Bryan and Marlo Bauer (Justin); and grandchildren, Jackson Michael Bauer and Amelia Carol Bauer. Along with his parents, Mike was preceded in death by his sister, Linda Bryan Pope, niece Kellie Pope and grandchild, Baby Bauer.\n\nNo services will be held at this time.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Boys & Girls Club of Wayne County, 1401 Royall Ave, Goldsboro, NC 27530.\n\nShumate-Faulk Funeral Home & Crematory is serving the Bryan family and online condolences can be directed to www.shumate-faulk.com"
