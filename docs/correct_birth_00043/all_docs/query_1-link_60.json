        "text": "Happy birthday, Jenna! 🥳 Outside of work, Jenna and her husband Sean are constantly on the move with their daughter Makenna and son Tanner. Jenna is in her \"dance mom\" era with Makenna being on two competitive dance teams as well as being in the Verona Nutcracker 🩰. When Jenna is not at the dance studio with her daughter or at dance competitions, you can find her cheering on Tanner and his travel baseball team. Jenna is looking forward to Tanner’s baseball tournaments this summer. ⚾️ When they’re not attending the kids’ numerous activities, the family loves heading up to Jenna’s aunt and uncle’s dairy farm in Marshfield, WI. 🐄 On her own, Jenna is an incredibly talented baker. Harbour staff have been invited to sample her creations in the past, and they are bakery quality! 🥧🧁🍰"
