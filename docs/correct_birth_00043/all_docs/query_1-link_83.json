Tickets will be available on Wednesday (July 17) at 11 a.m. ET, the “Lies Lies Lies” singer confirmed. The lineup for the Sneedville, Tennessee-born artist's Knoxville concert will include HARDY and ERNEST.\n\n“I've had the honor of playing in a lot of college, MLB and NFL stadiums the past two years, but getting to play to my hometown at Neyland Stadium, nothing tops this for a boy from East Tennessee,” Wallen said in a press release on Monday morning."
