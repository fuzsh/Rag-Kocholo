        "text": "Luke Bryan is very passionate when it comes to songwriting and great songs. He doesn’t care if he wrote a song or it was submitted to him; he just wants to record the best songs.\n\nLuke told us in a recent interview that his passion for songs started coming out when he was a teen and before he realized it. He said, “When I was fourteen years old, and I heard a new Alan Jackson song, it overtook my life back then. It took me over because I didn’t realize that that was my calling, and that’s why I liked it so much.”\n\nIt’s still there: “Even to this day if it’s a Luke Combs song, a Morgan Wallen song, a Lainey [Wilson] song, or someone else does a great song, it takes over my world.”\n\nAs Luke gets ready to start revealing new music with the announcement of a new album coming soon, he fans the flames, “It’s all about being fired up for the song and in the moment. Hopefully, when you get a great song, you’re smart enough not to ruin it in the studio.”\n\nRELATED: Luke Bryan And His Wife Get Hospital Wing Name\n\nBesides being an artist and entertainer, Luke is also a dad. For those of us with teenage children, we know that they don’t usually think of us as being “cool.” However, Luke Bryan doesn’t seem to have that problem. His son Bo, who is 16, and Tate, who is 13, are cool with their famous dad's vibe and his career in country music.\n\nIn a recent interview, Bryan was asked the question if his kids listened to his music. The proud dad replied, “You know, they’ll get into my truck, and they’ll, ya know, Tate will be like, ‘Dad, put some of your stuff on.'”\n\nAsked how it made the superstar feel, he smiled and answered, “When your children ask to hear your music, it’s pretty special.”\n\nIn one of our interviews, Luke shared one of the things he was proud of: one of them was the way he’s handled fame. He said, “I’ve been able to be a big celebrity and live the celebrity life, but I’ve also been able to live as a real human, too, and not have to sacrifice a lot of stuff because I was a celebrity.”\n\n“I didn’t hide in the house and not leave the house because I’m so worried that someone’s gonna want a picture while I’m eating dinner.”\n\nNancy Brooks has been working in the country music industry for almost 30 years. She has interviewed pretty much any country star you can think of. In the late 1990s, she started working with Dolly Parton. And yes, Nancy reports that Parton is as sweet as you would think. She loves her life in country music and has been backstage at every CMA Awards show since the late 1990s. Many of her stories are from her one-on-one interviews. She was there at the beginning of the incredible careers of many music superstars today, including Taylor Swift, Shania Twain, and Blake Shelton, and has interviewed them multiple times throughout the years."
