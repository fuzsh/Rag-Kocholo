        "text": "Kane Brown is a busy man as of late. Now the father of three kids and a country music superstar, it's hard to believe he finds time to do anything else.\n\nBut, rest assured, Brown does have some time to golf.\n\nKane Brown Issues a Challenge to Jason Aldean: Will Aldean Accept?\n\nI recently had a chance to sit down with the \"Thank God\" singer on Taste of Country Nights With Evan Paul, and the subject of golfing came up.\n\nBrown was dressed as if he was about to go golfing, so I asked if he had been going lately. Brown said, \"Trying to do it everyday. Much as I can, especially on the road; I golf way more on the road.\"\n\nHere's where it gets juicy. In a previous interview with Jason Aldean on Taste of Country Nights with Evan Paul on Demand in May of 2022, he was making fun of Brown for his golf game and saying that Brown was trying to get better, but had a way to go.\n\nAldean even went so far as to call Brown an \"idiot\" in a previous interview on Taste of Country Nights With Evan Paul, when I relayed the message to him that Brown said he was computer illiterate.\n\nThis has been a fun, cheeky ongoing battle for some years with the two country music superstars. It's kind of like WWE.\n\nI asked Brown if he has indeed gotten any better, because Aldean was clowning him on my show a while back.\n\nThe \"Bury Me in Georgia\" singer laughed, then replied,\n\n\"Yeah, I'll play Aldean any day, any amount of money, I'll play Aldean.\"\n\nWhen two normal, everyday people say they'll play someone for any amount of money, that can usually end up being $100 or something. But with two millionaires, challenging another to a round of golf for \"any amount of money\" could certainly get interesting."
