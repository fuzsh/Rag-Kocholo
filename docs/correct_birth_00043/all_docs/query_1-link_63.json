        "text": "VILLANOVA, Pa. — Asked about his upcoming schedule before Monday's World Team Tennis match between the host Philadelphia Freedoms and Kansas City Explorers, Bob Bryan rattled off a list of events and continents that will take he and his brother Mike all over the globe the next six months.\n\n\"We have a match tonight, go home to Miami, practice a few days on grass, go to London (for the Olympics) Sunday, be there a week before we play our first match,\" started Bob Bryan, who teamed with his brother on the Explorers Monday. \"The tennis event is the first week. When it finishes we're off to Toronto for our first match on Monday, then Cincinnati, a week off before the U.S. Open which is crazy with the sponsors, two weeks at the Open, straight to Spain for Davis Cup semifinals, then to California for a charity event, then Asia, Europe and then World Tour finals in November and then Mike's getting married.\"\n\nWouldn’t they like to schedule a little time in London to relax and enjoy the entire Olympic experience?\n\n“We’ve been to two Olympics, we saw Michael Phelps win one gold, we were there 20 minutes,” said Bob Bryan. “The schedule is too jam-packed. We have to get in there, give it hell and get on to the next tournament.”\n\nThe hectic schedule makes it impressive that the Bryans — the world's No. 2 doubles team and arguably the face of U.S. tennis — took the time out for a World Team Tennis match just near Philadelphia. Ryan Harrison, a 20-year-old American ranked 43rd in the world in singles, withdrew from his commitment last week to focus on his preparation for the Olympics.\n\n“They always make the commitment, they’re unbelievable,” said tennis legend Billie Jean King, the WTT co-founder, of the Bryans. “I’ve known them since they were born, I used to play against their mother, Kathy Blake. It means a lot to us. Our format is tailored for them because doubles is 60 percent of our scoring, and they’re so entertaining. They play their guts out, they’re interesting.”\n\nThe Bryan Brothers are 11-time Grand Slam champions but will be looking for their first Olympic gold when they arrive in London. It will be a unique tournament because only four of the top 10 ATP doubles teams are players from the same country, but many of the singles stars will play doubles as well.\n\n\"The top teams won't be together, but throw in the (Roger) Federers, (Novak) Djokovics, (Rafael) Nadals, that makes it tougher, there's no place to hide,\" said Mike Bryan. \"If anybody could pick one tournament to win in an Olympic year, it's always the Olympics.\n\n“The Grand Slams are great. ... Money, big in the tennis world, but an Olympic medal transcends sports. We have a trophy case at home and when our friends come over, they always open the trophy case and pull out our bronze. We’d like to upgrade to something a little shinier.”\n\nThe Bryan Brothers have stayed at the top of the doubles tennis rankings as there has been a transition in the American singles game. The long-time poster boy for U.S. tennis, Andy Roddick, is at the tail end of his career and 6-foot-9 John Isner is showing flashes of being the next great star, but he is currently No. 11 in the world and coming off two poor performances at majors.\n\n\"I wouldn't say we're the face of U.S. Tennis, because we have singles guys like Mardy Fish and Isner who are around the Top 10,\" said Mike Bryan. \"It's kind of a transition period. I don't know if we have guys competing for slams. Isner and Fish could potentially win one, but it's not like we're saying they're coming into the U.S. Open as potential favorites which we always used to have.\n\n\"Young guys like Harrison, Donald Young, are the future, but who knows how long that will take? We love carrying the flag for U.S. tennis for doubles, we've been there for a while and love going deep in slams and giving the American public a little American pride, but (the state of U.S. tennis) is not all that bad. You just have the best players in history playing at the same time, Federer, Nadal, Djokovic taking all the glory.\"\n\nKing feels Isner is the player most associated with U.S. tennis now, but the Bryan brothers have found their niche and at Wimbledon - where the tennis tournament will be held in a few weeks - they will be one of the top threats for Olympic gold.\n\n“The Bryan boys are our doubles team, they win their matches at Davis Cup,” said King. “They represent our country well. We can always be proud of them.”\n\nBill Evans can be reached at 856-845-9478 or bevans@southjerseymedia.com"
