        "text": "Dickinson, Empathy, and Anachronistic Adaptations\n\nPosted by Melanie on August 24, 2022 · Leave a Comment\n\nThe show is Coen-esque in its metatextual acknowledgement: Dickinson is a bare semblance of a true story, and in lieu of details which have been lost to time, anyways, it serves us a fantastical recounting of oral traditions, staticked with age of generations, coloured with time and our own biases.\n\nLegends of Television\n\nPosted by Melanie on July 26, 2019 · Leave a Comment\n\nLegends of Tomorrow is one of the most absurd, progressive, genre-bending shows going. In addition to pop-culture referential, anti-Nazi, time traveling fun, it gives us the emotional tools of the dozen therapy appointments we can’t afford or actively avoid. (As does Elementary with different tools . . . but that’s another blog post.) We might want … Continue reading →\n\nThe 100: Season 03, Episode 07, Thirteen\n\nPosted by Melanie on March 4, 2016 · 11 Comments\n\nWe open where we ended, with Murphy being tortured. When you think about it, it’s hard to have sympathy for Murphy – an often snide, sociopathic, murderous thief – but the point with torture is the subject doesn’t need to be sympathetic, in fact often it’s better if they aren’t; the moral quandary and audience … Continue reading →\n\nThe 100: Season 03, Episode 04, Watch the Thrones\n\nPosted by Melanie on February 12, 2016 · 7 Comments\n\nSo, exactly how many of our fictional TV rulers do we want to be women? To quote the Notorious RBG: ALL OF THEM. This episode has women doing most of the deciding, fighting, conniving, leading, talking, and general badassing. We kick off at the coalition, where Clarke looks over her head, but Nia is all … Continue reading →\n\nThe 100: Season 03, Episode 02, Wanheda Part 2\n\nPosted by Melanie on January 30, 2016 · 3 Comments\n\nThe very opening scene has an almost-throwaway bit which sums up a big developing theme. Bellamy wants to move out of the tank, but Kane objects. It’s not until Indra asserts “the boy is right” that Kane acquiesces, because Kane still only listens when other ‘adults’ speak. (If not his messiah complex, it’s this implicit bias … Continue reading →\n\nThe 100: Season 03, Episode 01, Wanheda Part 1\n\nPosted by Melanie on January 22, 2016 · 4 Comments\n\nStarting the episode off exactly where it left of in S2, and with Murphy – whose story was mostly ancillary the last couple seasons and whose ending was not really crucial to any plots so far – felt like quite the bold move. Murphy putting the gun to his chin immediately followed by something life-saving … Continue reading →\n\nLost Girl: Season 05, Episode 11, “Sweet Valkyrie High”\n\nPosted by Melanie on September 21, 2015 · 5 Comments\n\nSomewhere in the fourth season, Lost Girl lost its way. It wandered a little in the third, but the fourth is where the focus on relationships, the offbeat blend of classical lore with modern family and struggles, get fully lost in the push to make long arcing plots convoluted and mysterious. It’s also where we lost … Continue reading →\n\nVeronica Mars: The Movie, The Woman\n\nPosted by Melanie on March 17, 2014 · Leave a Comment\n\nBy now you’ve probably all read the reviews, most of which agree Veronica Mars functions more as an extended episode of TV than a movie . . . and then most of which, inexplicably, seem to think this is a bad thing. !!! The film took quite a bit of time updating us on where … Continue reading →\n\nShot Details and Framing in Wentworth\n\nPosted by Melanie on January 20, 2014 · Leave a Comment\n\nWentworth is an Australian prison drama, actually a remake of the show Prisoner. It’s dark and tense and manages some nice plot turns, it’s got a very teal and gray palette but breaks it up with reds and greens, it’s well acted, it uses slo-mo and occasional fantasy sequences to great effect. But you should discover that for yourself. I’m here to just talk about some details in the framing of shots."
