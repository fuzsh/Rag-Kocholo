        "text": "March 25, 2022\n\nJP knows how to do \"quick read\" books. The print is almost 400 pages (8:22 Hr for audio) of cat and mouse action-packed style crime thriller. Believe me, these short chapters really go by fast!\n\nThe story started in DC with a Federal Agent being targeted and killed. This one is different from others because it's all over the place (Wyoming, Colorado, Paris, Amsterdam, Mexico, CA, MA) with the third act in Montana and the wild river! An old nemesis is back (again).\n\nFear No Evil is a nice change of setting, but M, I'm tired of M. I'll continue to read this series because let's face it, the Cross family is a warm and loving bunch and I always look forward to what Nana Mama cooks in each book.\n\n🎧 There's a new narrator again! A better fit than the last book, 6/10.\n\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\nThe 29th book in this series of which I have read most but not all of the books. Every so often I check the ones I have missed and go back and read one of them. It is the kind of series you can do that with.\n\nI really enjoyed the mystery in this one, and loved the moment at the end when we find out who really was behind it all. Everyone was a hero in some way - Alex himself, John Sampson, Bree and even Nana and the kids. Really it is all delightful nonsense but the baddies are bad, the main characters face terrible odds but always win in the end, and reading the book is one of the better ways to pass a few hours of the day.\n\nFive stars for pure entertainment value.\n\nFebruary 20, 2022\n\nDr Alex Cross and his long-time best friend Detective John Sampson were preparing for their long-awaited break, a camp-out and hike, riding the rapids, entering on horseback, in the Montana wilderness, well known for the bear that lived there. But only hours before their departure, Alex had a call from his boss – a CIA person had been found, dead, with a confession attached. Their break was on hold.\n\nAs more top law enforcement personnel were murdered, always with their ‘confession’ along side them, Alex and John realized it smacked of ‘M’, the psychotic predator who’d followed them, taunting them, for years. There was also evidence of a cartel – its leader in prison for the past year – and Alex knew they were up against people who would kill without compunction…\n\nFear No Evil is #29 in the Alex Cross series by James Patterson, and it was Cross and Sampson at their best! Plenty of fast paced action, lots of bodies, twists and turns galore, all the while chasing the bad guys! Chilling, gritty, intense and unputdownable – I thoroughly enjoyed it! Highly recommended.\n\nFebruary 26, 2022\n\nJust as readers sometimes find themselves in a rut, the same can be said of authors who try to churn out something worthwhile. Many who follow my reviews will know that I have a love/hate relationship with James Patterson and his novels that appear to sell based on his name, rather than on any level of quality. I came into this book knowing that the Alex Cross series was one that had not been sullied with subpar writing or delivery. However, after reading this book, I am beginning to wonder if Dr. Cross may have overstayed his literary welcome and ought to hang up the cuffs for good. I could not connect with the book, the characters I have come to love, or even the action. Others may disagree, and I welcome it, but I am left wondering if it’s time to stop and let others fight crime. One of the cornerstone series for James Patterson, this one may have finally lost its steam and needs to be shelved for good.\n\nWhile I usually offer a detailed summary of the storyline for other reviewers to enjoy, I can’t be bothered today, preferring to offer a quick summary of my sentiments so that I can move along. Patterson resurrects an old nemesis of Dr. Alex Cross’ and places the detective in the middle of a serious manhunt. Cross is his usual go-getter self, swooping in to help as best he can, while also rescuing his wife from danger as she investigates something over in Europe. The tension and action that is usually built up with short Patterson-esque chapters is gone, leaving the reader feeling flat and underwhelmed. Don’t get me wrong, there is action and some heart-thumping suspense, but I did not feel the push to keep reading well into the night or caring much about what was going on. I need that on occasion and this novel did not deliver.\n\nWhile some authors can use their name to sell a book, I cringe at that, as the reader is left wondering if the quality is there. With another Cross novel on the horizon, I can only hope this was a stumbling block for Patterson (or if I am just out of sorts with my reading these days), and that Cross can return to his earlier glory. That being said, thirty novels may be a sign that Cross should enjoy time with the family and let the likes of Bennett and Boxer, other stalwart Patterson detectives, take the reins and keep things going. But, what’s do I know, right?\n\nKudos, Mr. Patterson, for finding new ideas to challenge your protagonist. It just did not impact me as I had hoped.\n\nLove/hate the review? An ever-growing collection of others appears at:\n\nhttp://pecheyponderings.wordpress.com/\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nNot read many of his books. Which is surprising as James Patterson has written many. This one has Alex Cross being targeted by the mystery man M and a drug cartel. Yes the story does romp along. But perhaps as I had just read the latest John Connolly this was really only a quick filler read for me. Action yes, but something a bit lacking. Still it won’t deter me from reading more😉\n\nSeptember 11, 2021\n\nAlex Cross book 29, seriously how did that happen>? Alex and Sampson are characters that I love and have no hesitancy to read about. You know with James Patterson books what you are going to get and Fear No Evil was all of it and more. In a week where I just needed come comfort reading, I got it with this book. He is one of my all time favourite authors and I almost read it in one sitting - damn having to get up for work the next day.\n\nThis book is action from go to woe. There is never a chance to get bored and there is alot of dead bodies for Alex and Sampson to investigate. And they are being hunted themselves so it is all go.\n\nThanks to Netgalley and Century for my advanced copy of this book to read. As always, a pleasure to read.\n\nMay 27, 2022\n\nAlex Cross and John Sampson catch a new case when a CIA agent is tortured and coerced into leaving a confession that she was working for a drug cartel before being killed. Meanwhile, Bree Stone, Alex's wife, heads out on her first case at her new job. She's headed to Paris to gather evidence against a hedge fund manager who is raping women and embezzling funds.\n\nI really liked seeing Bree work. Patterson should give her her own series. There was one thing that bothered me with this part of the book. Tying it back to the hit team Alex was investigating was way too much of a coincidence and required a HUGE amount of suspension of belief from the reader. After several books of M toying with Cross, we finally get some insight as to M's motivations. I thought it was interesting. Different that I expected but it makes sense. The ending seemed straight out of Deliverance but I enjoyed it.\n\nDecember 16, 2022\n\nAlex Cross, John Sampson, and Bree Stone are back. John is still hurting from events in the last novel, and Bree is excited about ditching politics in the DCPD and her new role in the private sector. She is sent off to Paris to gather evidence about a hedge fund manager's alleged theft of funds and sexual predation of his assistants. Meanwhile, in DC, Alex and John are called to a murder scene of a CIA agent, who has been tortured to admit to being on the dole of the Mexican drug cartel to support her daughter's medical care. As John and Alex investigate, corrupt agents are being exposed and killed while the cartel is seeking vengeance, slaughtering innocent family members. Alex goes to see the former head of the cartel, who has been incommunicado for 50 weeks in a supermax, trading some external contact for insight and an introduction to the leadership of the cartel. John and Alex's plans for a trip into the Montanan wilderness are postponed, and when they finally go, they become targets for the warring factions, including an old adversary. Say what you will about James Patterson, his short chapters and ability to compel readers to see what happens next has not declined over the years.\n\nMarch 21, 2022\n\nA very generous 3.5 stars rounded up to four for the long, long-running series featuring Alex Cross.\n\nBoth Cross and Sampson face a plethora of foes, including the mysterious 'M', a drug cartel and whomever else Patterson can think to throw at them. The setting is a little different to the usual (country Montana for the last part), and Bree is running her own business (suspend belief on that aspect of the plot), but that is about where it ends on the novelty front.\n\nOne of the better (and more reliable) series by JP, and if, like me, you've read the other 28, there is no way you will be giving up anytime soon on the series, despite the odd stumble in the Cross series.\n\nJanuary 3, 2022\n\nI’ve been reading James Patterson books for over twenty-five years. During that time, like most of his fans, my favorite character has always been Alex Cross. He was Patterson’s first detective series that helped lay the foundation for his kingdom of several bestselling series and stand-alone novels. For me, Alex has remained a fierce, intellectual knight of moral character and the proper use of action. I remember reading the Alex’s first adventure, “Along came a Spider” and almost cried when Alex, then a widower, faced the loss of his new love in an ending twist I would never forget. In the twenty-seven years following, there have been some good (and excellent) adventures and some less-than-stellar outings along the way, but I generally looked forward to the end of each year when another Alex Cross adventure was published.\n\nNow, the 29th book in the series – “Fear No Evil” – has been read, and it is my first review of 2022.\n\n“Fear No Evil” opens with the torture and murder of a CIA agent. Alex and his DC police partner, John Sampson, are ready to leave on their man-trip to in the deep Bob Marshall Wilderness of Montana and enjoy horseback riding and rafting. However, their Metro DC Police Commissioner demands that they attend the crime scene where the body was left.\n\nThis kicks off a Cross adventure that has a lot going on. A lot. In addition to a deadly showdown in the Montana wilderness, there are multiple storylines going on. Bree, Cross’s wife now working for a top private security firm, Bluestone Group, has a new assignment in Paris investigating a major international CEO who is accused of unbelievable acts of abuse to women working with him. Sampson is still grieving the death of his wife, Billie, and trying to be a good father to their little girl, Willow. Alex’s youngest son, Ali, is working on his own secret and dangerous investigation. And to top it all off, Cross is receiving more texts from his personal adversary, the elusive “M”, who taunts him and has set his sights on taking him out for good.\n\nThe interesting thing for me is that this overload of activity and storylines was a good thing and also a bad thing. Let me explain.\n\nGood things – this was one of Patterson’s better Alex Cross novels. The tempo was fastmoving with lots of drama. The plotlines pretty much were delivered in staccato fast-moving fashion, along with a few curveballs thrown in to make the outcome more interesting. There wasn’t much family development other than Bree’s storyline, which I enjoyed for the most part. She deserved some well- earned time in the spotlight and delivered strong.\n\nThe focus was also on Alex’s best friend, John Sampson, and his daughter, which deserved some stage time too. I enjoyed his time on the stage a lot. He’s more than Alex’s best friend; he’s really Alex’s brother and is a key influence and balance to Alex, and I appreciated his moments to shine.\n\nI liked the mysterious “M” (or “Maestro”) storyline and the way its unfolded over several books. It feels like with the way this book ended, Patterson is setting up for a big Cross/”M” faceoff in the next one to coincide with it being the 30th Alex Cross and an anniversary book. It could be Patterson’s own version of WrestleMania with some surprises and payoffs. But then, I may just be wishing. We’ll see. Either way, it is time to bring the “M” storyline to come to a boil and culminate.\n\nBad things - Ali had a small storyline, which could have been expanded and involved the reader more. Instead, Patterson went with a reveal after the fact approach which I felt like was a missed opportunity to develop Ali directly.\n\nNow, that I complimented the “M” storyline, I need to explain that I also had problems with it too. One if the challenges with reading Patterson is that you have to suspend your disbelief at times because the action scenes and storylines are a bit unrealistic. Some novels require more disbelief than others. This was one where the level of disbelief needed was extremely high. There was a lot of shooting, stabbing, and killing in this one. The body count and torturing were higher than normal, and that is saying a lot for a Patterson novel.\n\nOverall, this was one of the better Alex Cross novels, moving the “M” storyline forward to a hopeful conclusion in the next book which will be his 30th outing.\n\nFor me, Alex Cross has done a good job of standing the test of time. For three decades and 29 books, Alex Cross has hunted many serial killers and mastermind criminals. He has faced many life-threatening moments. He has done his best to keep his family safe and support them. He has grown and changed in many ways, but his ethical and moral compass remains true and strong, a prime example and model for doing good, no matter what the situation is. He still shines bright most of the time and this one was a 4-out-of-5 star outing for me.\n\nDecember 3, 2021\n\n3- 1/2*\n\nI have been a faithful fan of Dr. Alex Cross from day one. He is one cool dude and I love his family.\n\nSo, Alex and his BFF John Sampson are packing to go away on a long overdue vacation. Nope! Not going to happen when murder and mayhem intervene.\n\nBree has started a new job with a private security firm and is off to Paris on her first assignment which turns out to be a little dicey for her.\n\nAlex and Sampson’s longstanding adversary M has reared his ugly head yet again and no sooner have Alex and John got a break in the mayhem and take off on their long awaited wilderness vacation – all hell breaks loose, again.\n\nFast paced, short chapters, Cross-family drama all culminate in an exciting Deliverance-like ending.\n\nI am not a fan of James Patterson, but for the 29th book in a series it’s holding its own.\n\nSeptember 23, 2021\n\nWhat an action -packed thrilling read this was with Alex Cross at his best. A beautifully executed subplot taking us to France and the main plot taking us deep into the wilderness as the mysterious M , drug cartels and the environment all threaten Alex and John Sampson's lives.\n\nAs always the thrill and darkness of death and evil is tempered by the beautiful Cross family and Nana mama's cooking.\n\nThis longstanding series has evolved over the years into action packed fast paced reads with some being a tad better than others (although I've not read a dud one yet). However Fear No Evil was really engrossing and I read it quickly , enjoying every minute.\n\nSeptember 3, 2022\n\nThis is Book 29 of 30 for the Alex Cross series, a series anno like me many started years back and many, also like me, for whatever reason stopped, am not sure what book I last read but have no fear James Patterson hasn’t changed and this was readable, if not particularly inspiring, it says something about him ( and lets be honest he is amazing ) that years on I DID remember some of the characters and about Alex’s life, there is a very helpful synopsis?at the beginning to bring you up to date with his career and romances, every series should have this!\n\nThe story is nothing more, nothing less than readers of the author would expect and whilst I did enjoy it I didn’t enjoy it enough to read anymore that I had missed nor look up the next one, however if I get the next one for Christmas (as did this one) I wont be disappointed\n\nIt was a perfectly acceptable read 🤗\n\n6/10\n\n3 Stars\n\nNovember 28, 2022\n\nHow does Patterson come up with so many scenarios? Once again he does it. In this book he has a secret US organization killing off corrupted US officials. They are corrupted by a Mexican drug cartel. How close to the truth is he? The book claims that most US officials working on the southern border have been corrupted. Those corrupt officials are tortured to confess to the truth and are made to write out the confession and then they are killed. The Mexican cartel, retaliating for the \"betrayal' in making the confessions, kills off the murdered official's family. Alex Cross has to step into this mess and fight both sides. Excellent adventure that keeps moving as evidence piles up.\n\nDecember 5, 2021\n\nA CIA Agent is tortured to death and her extracted confession left with her body. The Mexican cartel keeping the agents in their pocket retaliates and a tit-for-tat murder spree engulfs Government agencies. Alex Cross and his best buddy John Sampson has their leaves canceled to tackle this menace. Then, a nemesis from times past reaches out to them, teasing and taunting, leading them to believe that he’s behind it all…. At least behind the vigilante group taking down corrupt Government officials!\n\nMeanwhile, recently retired Bree Stone, wife of Alex Cross, is sent to Paris on her first assignment with the Private sector Security Agency she’s now working for. Her job is to find out the dirt behind a billionaire businessman who’s also exploiting young women interning in his organization…\n\nPlease read my detailed review from the link below:\n\nhttps://www.aniblogshere.com/books-re...\n\nDo Read 📖, Like 👍🏼, Comment 💭, or Share 🚩\n\n🙏🏼🙏🏼\n\n#fearnoevil #thriller #bookmagic #bookreview #lovebooks #jonathankellerman #bookrecommendations #bookreviewer #bookreviewblog #booklover #book #bookreviewing #bookreviews #bookreviewblogger #bookblogger #jamespatterson #alexcross #crimethriller #mystery #suspense\n\nAugust 31, 2021\n\nJames Patterson puts his hero Alex Cross through the wringer once again in his 29th book, and as always it is a breathtaking rollercoaster.\n\nJames Patterson is always at his best when writing by himself in my humble opinion, (although I am looking forward to his upcoming book with Dolly Parton!) and this latest brutal and pacy thriller has the usual characters and elements that his readers have grown to love.\n\nThere’s really no such thing as a bad James Patterson book because he’s become a genre unto himself, hitting on a winning formula and able to continually reproduce it. You know what you’re getting with a Patterson book - a well-written and fast-moving thriller- and “Fear No Evil” delivers it effortlessly.\n\nJanuary 17, 2022\n\nThe last few Alex Cross books I’ve really enjoyed because they felt like ones from earlier in the series. This one, not so much. It was all over the place. Almost every chapter, we moved on to a different location and a different part of the story. It really felt like there was no continuity to the book. It did pick up and settle in for the last 75 pages or so, when Alex and Sampson were trekking through the Montana wilderness. I am somewhat intrigued by the ending and even if this one isn’t high up on my series favorites, I’ll still be eagerly awaiting the next.\n\nNovember 28, 2021\n\nOne of the better Alex Cross books in some time. There’s a needless Ali Cross subplot (a teaser for his next book, perhaps) but by changing up the setting significantly, it freshened up the series. It does feel a little like three separate books in the beginning, but the ending satisfies. (I wasn’t surprised by the last chapter though)\n\nDecember 4, 2022\n\nI was always an Alex Cross fan, but have missed a few along the way. I picked this one up and realized how much I enjoy this series and will go back to read the ones I have missed. In Fear No Evil, Alex and Sampson have been dealing with a psychotic, criminal mastermind known as \"M\" or \"Maestro\". Things have died down and they are planning on a trip into the Wilderness to relax and help Sampson clear his mind after the death of his wife, until a government agent is murdered and confesses to working with a dangerous, Mexican, drug cartel. When the agents family is butchered by the cartel in retaliation, the FBI calls in Alex and Sampson. Meanwhile, Alex's wife, Bree, is in Europe working a case of a Philippe Abelmar, a sexual predator and embezzler for her private investigative company. All things come to a head as Maestro is involved in more ways than one.\n\nHaving missed a few books, there have been a lot of changes in the Cross family and their jobs. I was quickly brought up to speed and pulled into the story. There is a lot of violence and killing in this one, and it moves quickly with short chapters. From DC to Wyoming, Colorado, Paris, Amsterdam, Mexico, CA, MA and a crazy showdown in Montana on a wild river, this book takes us on a whirlwind ride. I enjoyed catching up with Alex, Bree and Sampson and am looking forward to the next book, where \"M\" or \"Maestro\" finally gets their comeuppance. This is a book that you just need to sit back and enjoy, suspend belief and grab a bowl of popcorn. It is quite the ride.\n\nMarch 7, 2022\n\nI feel disloyal writing this review because I’ve always loved James Patterson’s writing style, and his Alex Cross series was among my favorites. But here goes: I didn’t feel the magic with Fear No Evil, #29 in the Alex Cross series.\n\nThe story begins with several storylines that later coincidentally (magically) tie together.\n\nI normally love Patterson’s short chapters, but here the constant jumping between the various storylines and characters felt disjointed, until the last quarter, when the focus finally narrowed.\n\nThe action, when we eventually got there, felt over the top, like Patterson tossed out all the explosives at once because he’s bored with his own characters.\n\nAnd “M.” Do you hear me groaning? “M” is the omniscient, omnipotent supervillain whose continuing thread has been dragged on and on… and on through this series. I am so incredibly sick of “M.” Kill him, already. Or have him kill everyone else. End the misery. Please.\n\nBut, no. This book ends with a cliffhanger. Let the misery continue.\n\n*I received an ARC from Novel Suspects Insiders.*\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\nThis book felt all over the place. Brie doing one thing, Alex doing another, then a bad guy, and a bad guy imposter??\n\nI am a seasoned audiobook reader, and this convoluted plot had me wondering what was going on. Felt like a ploy because there really is no decent plot here. Many parts of the dialogue were not great either.\n\nBeautiful example of Patterson’s exceptional writing skills:\n\nBRIE: I’m touched that you got on a plane because you thought I was in danger (Yea Brie, he thought you were shot and injured/killed when shots rang out when you two where on the phone and then he couldn’t get ahold of you)\n\nALEX: I didn’t even think about it. I was scared and worried the entire 12 hour flight to see you.\n\nBRIE: I’ve never known you to be scared of much. What were you afraid of??????\n\nSeriously? This is the writing here. What was he afraid of?? I don’t know dumbass - the fact that you were injured or dead? Or maybe that he wouldn’t find a decent croissant in Paris??? 🤨🤨🤨\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nNovember 20, 2021\n\nAnother brilliant book in the Alex Cross series.\n\nI love this time of the year as I know a new Alex Cross will be out.\n\nThis is an action packed read that will have you racing through the pages.\n\nAn old enemy of Alex and Sampson, ‘M’ starts to send them texts letting them know he’s watching them.\n\nThey’re then pulled onto a case where the body count rises rapidly and it seems a drug cartel and a group of assassins are at war.\n\nCross and Sampson soon become the targets for both groups and they try and work out if ‘M’ is also after their blood.\n\nThey end up in the wilds of Montana and it’s clear both groups want them dead, as they hunt them down.\n\nThis is a gripping crime thriller and as ever, I can’t wait for the next book.\n\nThanks to Random House UK and NetGalley for the opportunity to read this book.\n\nDecember 24, 2021\n\nI adore the Patterson books but haven't read one for quite some time so I was excited to see Alex Cross and John Sampson again! The plot moves quickly...all the way to Montana as they hunt for an elusive killer. Lots of characters and I sometimes had to re-read to figure out where everyone belonged but of course Patterson is worth it. You will know if you've read any of his (or seen the ones that have been movies as well. Just go into it blind and enjoy the ride!\n\nThanks to NetGalley for this ARC!\n\nNovember 28, 2021\n\nGreat read. M was right there for us. This one played out all over but still effectively. A couple of truly harrying spots for our favorites kept things dicey. I’ve been reading this series since the beginning. One a year I guess. That tells you everything. Patterson is great with Cross and company.\n\nDecember 25, 2021\n\nThis book was good and had quite a bit of action; however, it did not keep me on the edge of my seat. The Bree case felt a somewhat disjointed. Most often, I read an Alex Cross book straight through late into the night. With this book, I was able to start and stop several times. This, like all other Alex Cross books, is definitely worth a read, and I will be an Alex Cross fan forever.\n\nFebruary 24, 2022\n\nWhewwwwwwwww. Those last 100 pages were intense!! #29 and I still want more. Alex, and Sampson have been my faves since middle school - and almost 2 decades later still just as obsessed.\n\nNovember 27, 2021\n\nJames Patterson is the best-selling author in the world. At this point he is practically an institution. However, even though I have been reading his work since the very beginning, nothing quite measures up for me like his classic thriller series featuring Alex Cross. The good doctor has come a long way since ALONG CAME A SPIDER, as FEAR NO EVIL will demonstrate.\n\nThe stakes have never been higher for Cross as the international terrorist group Maestro, fronted by the mysterious and masked M, is not just threatening global violence, they are pulling it off. Cross and his best buddy, John Sampson, find themselves directly in the crosshairs (no pun intended). But before we get there, we have a lot to unpack as Cross and Sampson are not the book’s only stars.\n\nThe action begins immediately as we witness CIA operative and potential traitor Catherine Hingham being tortured to death by an unknown adversary. This is just the start of CIA personnel and other members of the law enforcement and intelligence fields being targeted. To make matters worse, after the target is eliminated, the killers go after their family and attempt to murder them all --- from grandparents to young children. It is safe to say that FEAR NO EVIL is not for the faint of heart. That being said, who better to meet this violence head on than Alex Cross?\n\nCross and Sampson were planning an adventure getaway when all this commenced, but their plans have been delayed. Once they were on board, Cross received a threatening text from M that showed him how he knows the location of each member of his family.\n\nSpeaking of Cross’ family, his wife Bree --- an ex-cop herself --- takes on an assignment for the Bluestone organization, which will send her to Paris, France, in pursuit of a serial rapist and alleged killer. Not only does the novel jump between Cross and Bree, it offers us glimpses into the Maestro organization with occasional bits on M. It seems there is no one who can be trusted as every level of law enforcement attempts to unmask them before they can kill more people or follow through on any terrorist threats.\n\nThere seems to be some adversarial connection between Maestro and a powerful Mexican drug cartel. To get a better handle on this situation, Cross heads to a highly militarized prison in the desert to meet with the head of the cartel, Marco Alejandro, who has been in non-communication isolation for nearly a year. Cross hopes that he might be able to reveal who M is, if not validate why his organization is in a blood war with Maestro. Alejandro is willing to talk but does not know much. He suggests that Cross speak with his sister, who has taken over the day-to-day operations of the cartel in his absence.\n\nCross’ case is temporarily derailed when he learns of a terrorist incident in Paris with which Bree has been mixed up. Having no idea whether or not she’s alive, he jumps on a flight to Paris to find her. Thankfully, she is okay, and it turns out that the frightening episode was the responsibility of M and his group, bringing Cross’ and Bree’s cases full circle with each other.\n\nAs time goes on with no resolution other than for the good guys to sit on the sidelines as Maestro and the cartel kill each other, Cross and Sampson decide to take that trip they were planning to Swan River Valley, Montana. It will make them bait for anyone from either of the battling groups to come after them.\n\nThe last third of FEAR NO EVIL is a surefire thrill ride. Will Cross and Sampson survive their excursion, and will we finally learn the identity of M? You will just have to dive into this page-turning book to find out!\n\nReviewed by Ray Palen\n\nNovember 27, 2021\n\nI wrote this review originally for NetGalley, which appears here... https://www.netgalley.com/book/234063...\n\nJames Patterson’s Alex Cross series has endured for almost three decades, bringing to readers worldwide the unadulterated storytelling prowess of one of the most prolific and biggest selling authors in the world today. Fear No Evil, the 29th Alex Cross novel, had me excited from the moment I received the e-ARC courtesy of the author and the publishers via the lovely NetGalley!\n\nCross and his best friend John Sampson are barely hours away from embarking on an adventure trip into the wilderness of Montana, away from the city in all senses. As expected, their vacation ends even before it starts, when the body of a highly respected CIA operative is found along with a handwritten letter confessing to being sold out to a Mexican cartel. Soon, more law enforcement personnel start to turn up dead, seemingly the victims of some vigilante group, and Cross and the FBI rush from state to state in an effort to identify and stop the killers. To complicate matters further, the cartel, as per its own twisted logic, retaliates by slaughtering the victims’ families to scare the prospective confessors into silence. Amidst all this, Cross starts to receive some text messages from an old nemesis of his—known only as M—who seems to know a lot about the present case, as well as the intimate details of Cross’s family and friends. The breath-taking chase culminates in a final showdown in the treacherous wilderness where Cross and Sampson are up against not one but two sets of lethal assassins and, far more dangerous than both, grizzly bears!\n\nI’ve lost touch with Patterson’s writing—his own, not his collaborations—for quite sometime and this one felt a bit different from the only other Alex Cross novel I’ve read, Along Came a Spider. While the series starter was a gripping suspense thriller where Alex pitted his wits against a shrewd serial killer, the latest one is low on suspense or mystery and pretty high on action. There is a prodigious body count and pulse-pounding action to match in Fear No Evil. There are many twists, some the reader could foresee and some quite unexpected. Running simultaneously with the breakneck action is the theme of family, friendship, love and loyalty that lends a nice human touch to the novel. Tiny chapters, sharp dialogues, crisp descriptions and the endearing characters from Cross’s and Sampson’s families—Nana Mama, Ali and Willow especially—make this one a lightning fast, fun read. The sub-plots involving the exploits of Bree Stone—Cross’s wife and former Metro PD detective—on her mission to Paris to nab a rotten, embezzling billionaire, and Ali Cross’s skills of detection, are engaging, too.\n\nThere are things that didn’t work for me, as well, in Fear No Evil. About twenty years after he first appeared, M is as elusive as ever, and that is just not done. And there are a few questions—questions I can’t mention here for fear of spoiling it—that are left unanswered, perhaps to hook the reader onto the next episode; but someone of Patterson’s stature doesn’t have to do that, does he?\n\nFear No Evil is a great addition to the beloved Alex Cross series and I sincerely wish that Patterson writes more and more on his own rather than collaborating with other writers…"
