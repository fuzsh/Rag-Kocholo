        "text": "“CHARMED” RETROSPECT: (6.17) “Hyde School Reunion”\n\n(6.17) “Hyde School Reunion” is an episode from Season Six of the TV series, “CHARMED” (1998-2006). It is viewed as controversial by many fans of the show. I wish I could say that its controversy revolved around any innovative storytelling. I wish I could say this . . . but I cannot. Because “Hyde School Reunion” is without a doubt one of the worst “CHARMED” episodes to air on television.\n\nIn this episode, Phoebe inadvertently casts a spell – written in her high school yearbook – that allowed her wild personality from her “troubled” adolescent to take over her. And this all happened at her tenth high school reunion. At the same time, Piper is trying to figure out why the sisters’ new whitelighter Chris, who had recently been revealed as her son from the future, has been avoiding her. She recruits the help of her dad Victor Bennett to delve into the big mystery. In the end, Piper and Victor learned that Chris is wary of Piper’s presence, because she is destined to die fourteen years in the future. Ugh. Also, Chris is being hunted by Scabber demons. As for Phoebe . . . oh God, it resulted in one big mess.\n\nIn a nutshell, younger Phoebe or “Freebie” – as one of her old schoolmates had nicknamed her – wrecked havoc with magic by plotting the escape of an old classmate named Rick Gittridge from jail. When Rick realized that his former classmate can use magic, he wants her – namely Phoebe – to help him rob an armored car. I would love NOT to go into details of how this all unfolds. Must I? Must I do this? Sigh! I suppose I must. Anyway, the other two Halliwells whisked Phoebe back to the Manor before she could do anything about Rick. When she returned to Rick, Phoebe learned that one of her old school mates, Ramona, is missing. Rick had kidnapped her to secure Phoebe’s help. They robbed an armored car, but Phoebe cast a spell upon Rick, making him believe that the cops were almost upon them. They fled back to the Manor, where Rick ended up insisting that Phoebe give him a new face before he tells her where Ramona is. Paige appeared and Phoebe suggested that the younger sister give Rick, Chris’ face. Chris – who was being hunted by Scabber demons. Rick ended up pleased – until the Scabber demons showed up and killed him.\n\nThe positive aspects of “Hyde School Reunion” came in the subplot involving Chris, Piper and Victor. I never understood why Chris was able to warn his grandfather to stop smoking in order to avoid emphysema and prevent Paige from being killed by Titans (see “Oh Goddess!” from late Season Five), prevent Wyatt from turning evil, and yet . . . was not allowed to warn his mother that she will be dead in fourteen years for fear of changing the timeline? What the hell? What saved this subplot were the performances of Chris Fuller, Holly Marie Combs and James Read.\n\nUnfortunately, the major plotline for “Hyde School Reunion” revolved around Phoebe’s high school reunion and her messy little “flashback” to her adolescent past. There was so much wrong with this story that I had to make a list:\n\n*Phoebe had graduated from high school in 1994? Phoebe had been born in early November 1975. In 1994, she was eighteen, going on nineteen. What happened? She had to repeat a grade?\n\n* I found Alyssa Milano and Rose McGowan’s outfits at the reunion . . . questionable. Poor Ms. McGowan looked as if her jacket had been made from the fur of a dead animal that had the bad luck to be dyed in pale blue. Ms. Milano’s boobs looked as if they threatened to pop out any minute. Even worse, her nipples were so obvious that they seemed to shout at the television screen.\n\n*In the previous episode, (6.17) “The Courtship of Wyatt’s Father”, Leo finally managed to boink Piper and plant baby Chris in her. Yet, in the following episode – namely this one – Piper was “months” pregnant. How many months had passed between the two episodes? I realize that Holly Marie Combs was pregnant at the time, but talk about ill timing!\n\n*Why did nearly every Halliwell sister either seemed to possess that hideous look that consisted of either long hair and bangs, braces or all? Do you think I am exaggerating? Take a gander at the photos below –\n\nPrue transformed back to her seventeen year-old self in (2.22) “Be Careful What You Witch For”\n\nPiper’s high school yearbook photo in (3.09) “Coyote Piper”\n\nPhoebe’s high school yearbook photo in “Hyde School Reunion”\n\nPaige transformed back to her seventeen year-old self in (4.10) “A Paige From the Past”\n\n*Phoebe wrote a poem in her high school yearbook . . . that turned out to be a spell? My God, how lame!\n\n*How is it that one of Phoebe’s old gym teachers, Miss Hickok, had no idea that Phoebe had become a famous columnist, whose mug was plastered on billboards all over San Francisco?\n\n*I realize that in this episode, “Freebie” has adult Phoebe’s powers. Could someone please explain how she had learned how to use magic? Please? Adult Phoebe knew nothing of magic until she was two months shy of her 23rd birthday. How did adolescent “Freebie” suddenly learn how to cast a spell and turn her old classmates into teenaged Neanderthals? Hell, the only magic that Phoebe knew around 22 and 23 were the old “The Power of Three will set us free” chant and her premonitions.\n\n*Chris, who is the son of a chef, had no idea what mutton was? Being a vegetarian is no excuse. Unless mutton no longer existed in the 2020s of the “CHARMED” universe.\n\n*Why were Scabber demons after Chris? That story plot had evaded me.\n\n*Could someone PLEASE explain how “Freebie” managed to shapeshift Rick, who was disguised as a guard, back to his old self with a flick of her wrist? HOW? Even adult Phoebe lacked this ability. She would have had to use a spell or chant to do this. Shapeshifting was not one of her psi abilities.\n\n*Between the time Piper and Paige had teleported Phoebe from the warehouse to the Manor and back took less than a minute. How did Rick managed to tie up Todd – another Freebie classmate – and hide Ramona in that short space of time?\n\n*Why didn’t Phoebe simply use a spell to coerce Rick into revealing where he had hidden Ramona . . . instead of aiding him in his so-called crime spree?\n\nFor me, the major faux pas of “Hyde School Reunion” centered around the death of Rick Gittridge. Many fans have commented on certain acts surrounding the unfolding events. One, why did Paige fail to teleport the shotgun from Rick’s hand? Two, why did Phoebe suggest that Paige turn Rick’s face into Chris’ face before Rick could verify where he had hidden Ramona . . . so that the Scabber demons would go after him? Why did she not do the dirty deed, herself?\n\nSome member of a “CHARMED” message board had once commented that this entire scene lacked sense because as “good witches”, the Charmed Ones would have never set up a human to be killed by demons. I say . . . bullshit to that! The Halliwells have proven in the past how murderous and self-righteous they could be. How many times has Prue – believing to be wronged – allowed her temper to get the best of her? In (2.08) “P3 H2O”, a very self-righteous Phoebe had accused Sam Wilder – Mommy Dearest’s whitelighter and Paige’s dad – of failing to save Patty before the latter was killed by a water demon. Paige was stupid, murderous and self-righteous enough to attempt to kill her former demon/human brother-in-law Cole Turner, when he had finally given up on getting Phoebe back in (5.12) “Centennial Charmed”. (2.02) “Mortality Bites” is a prime example of how murderous and self-righteous the Halliwells can be. I will tell you exactly what really bothered me about “Hyde School Reunion”:\n\nPhoebe: How do we know you’re telling the truth?\n\nRick: You don’t. Now, my face. Make it different. Heartbreaking, charming, young.\n\n(Phoebe gets an idea.)\n\nPhoebe: You know, I’m thinking maybe you should use our nephew for inspiration.\n\nPaige: “Who you were, you’re now another, take the face of Wyatt’s brother.”\n\n(Rick turns into Chris. He looks in the mirror.)\n\nChris: Yeah, I like it. This’ll work.\n\nPaige: Pheebs, watch out, this could get messy. (Phoebe and Paige hide behind a wall. Three Scabbar demons appear in the room. Rick shoots at them but doesn’t harm them. They spit the green acid goo at Rick which melts him to nothing. The demons disappear. Phoebe and Paige come out from behind the wall.) You okay?\n\nPhoebe: Yeah.\n\nPaige: You know you had to, right?\n\nPhoebe: I know.\n\nShe had to? Phoebe had to give Chris’ face to Rick, knowing that her nephew was being hunted by Scabber demons? Why was it necessary for Phoebe to set up Rick to be murdered? Who in the fuck wrote this episode? Years ago, I discovered that a screenwriter named David Simkins had written “Hyde School Reunion”. I had been pretty cruel about Simkins’ writing talent. I also discovered that the series’ original show runner, Constance Burge, was the episode’s co-writer. I honestly do not know how to digest this. As a former show runner, one would think she should have known better. But I realize that the only person I can really blame is Brad Kern, who became the series’ second show runner. He had not only approved this script, I would not be surprised if this is what he had wanted in the first place. Moron. I wonder if Alyssa Milano and Rose McGowan had expressed concerns about what Phoebe and Paige did to Rick. If they did not, they should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nThis episode truly ranks as amongst the worst of the series’ eight-year history. Honestly. And the fact that it had climaxed into the unnecessary murder of a human, thanks to the scheming of two of the three major characters really sticks in my craw. But what really pisses me off about “Hyde School Reunion” was that Brad Kern actually believed viewers would sit in front of a television set and accept that Phoebe and Paige’s murderous act was “necessary”, is an insult not only to my intelligence, but also to the intelligence of the series’ many other viewers and fans.\n\n“CHARMED”: “PHOEBE HALLIWELL AND THE NEXUS THEORY”\n\nRecently, I watched the ”CHARMED” Season One episode called (1.15) “Is There a Woogy in the House?”. In this episode, Phoebe Halliwell’s childhood fear of a boogeyman in the basement called the ”Woogeyman” proves to be true and it ends up taking possession of her and a few others – including her sister Prue’s ex-boyfriend, Andy Trudeau. Following this experience with the Woogeyman, Phoebe came to a conclusion regarding her moral compass.\n\nThe episode began with an aftershock from a previous earthquake. The aftershock not only revealed Phoebe’s childhood fear of something called the “Woogyman”, it has an ongoing source of amusement for her two sisters. That is, until a violent earthquake unleashes a long-dormant shadow demon on the day Prue has plans to hold a dinner party for her boss and a Bucklands’ customer. The latter first takes possession of a repairman, summoned to investigate a strange odor from the manor’s basement. After Prue and Piper leave the manor, the Woogeyman uses the repairman to summon Phoebe to the basement and she also becomes possessed. Phoebe’s strange behavior not only manages to ruin the dinner party, she also summons the Buckland’s client – a Professor Whittlesbey, who knows a good deal about the manor’s history – to the basement and the Woogeyman. Professor Whittlesbey becomes possessed. After Prue and Piper find themselves locked out of the manor by Phoebe, the two set out to discover what Professor Whittlesbey was hinting about the manor, when the dinner party first began. Unfortunately, the possessed professor ends up being arrested after she had physically attacked her assistant, Josh. Prue and Piper learn more details about the Halliwell manor from Josh:\n\nJosh: You know, I’ve met people like that. (He looks at Piper.) A spiritual nexus is a point of incredible energy.\n\nPrue: Equidistant from the five spiritual elements.\n\nJosh: That’s right. The place or thing that could be swayed either way.\n\nPiper: Either way?\n\nJosh: Yeah. Either to be a source of undeniable good or undeniable evil. Uh, look ladies, I’m gonna follow her and make sure she’s okay. Feel free to browse around our office if you think it will help.\n\nIn other words, Prue and Piper came to some conclusion that because the manor was situated in the center of this Nexus – shaped as pentagram – it was the source of great power that can be a source of good or evil. Once Phoebe managed to banish the Woogeyman, she came to a conclusion about the Nexus and her moral compass:\n\nPhoebe: I’m beginning to wonder if I have a good one [dark side]. (Prue and Piper stare at her.) Well, I am. I mean, up until now, I didn’t even think I had a dark side. I mean, not any more so than anyone else.\n\nPrue: Yeah, well the important thing is the good side won out.\n\nPhoebe: Yeah, but I must have been more susceptible than either one of you, otherwise he wouldn’t of chosen me, right? Right?\n\nPiper: You were the only one that was born in the house, that makes you more connected to it. That spiritual nexus thing.\n\nPhoebe: That’s exactly my point. I could go either way. Good or evil. Kinda freaky.\n\nWhat in the hell was Constance Burge thinking? What on earth made her think that someone would be stupid enough to buy such a theory straight out of Sunday school for eight year-olds? Phoebe could easily turn good or evil, because she was born above the Nexus? That was Burge’s idea of characterization?\n\nIt was bad enough that Prue got the elements mentioned in the episode wrong:\n\nPrue: Okay, to find a way back in, we have to know what we’re up against. The professor said that a true spiritual nexus sits equidistant from the five basal elements. So, that’s earth, fire, water, wood and metal.\n\nThen she added:\n\nPrue: Looks like it’s not just on a spiritual nexus, but a wiccan one as well. Which means it’s a battleground for good and evil.\n\nThe spiritual nexus beneath the manor was definitely not a Wiccan one. Wiccans are associated with the following five elements – earth, fire, water, air and spirit. The five elements mentioned by Prue in the episode are the following – earth, fire, water, wood and metal. These elements are associated with Chinese philosophy, not Wicca.\n\nBut it got worse. At least for me. By the end of the episode, Phoebe claimed that because she was born in the manor (in other words, above the nexus), she was more susceptible to being possessed by the Woogeyman than her sisters. What . . . a . . . load . . . of . . . crap! If for this reason Phoebe was more susceptible toward evil, then one might as well say the same about the others that ended up possessed by the Woogeyman – the repairman, Professor Whittlesey, one of the Halliwell neighbors . . . and Andy Trudeau. And I am certain that not one of them was born inside the manor. If Piper or Prue had been inside that manor alone instead of Phoebe, the Woogeyman could have easily possessed either of them.\n\nWhy do I find this Nexus Theory about Phoebe hard to swallow? It does not make any sense to me. That is not good characterization. I do not even know what to call it. Phoebe was more prone to evil . . . and therefore more prone to be possessed by the Woogeyman? Had it ever occurred to Constance Burge or the episode’s writers, Chris Levinson and Zack Estrin, that Phoebe ended up possessed, because she had the bad luck to be in the manor alone with the repairman?\n\nFirst of all, the series has managed to prove that all four sisters had personality quirks that made them easily prone to evil. Prue’s anger, pride and arrogance made her very susceptible to evil. Probably more so than the other three sisters, due to her anger issues. Piper’s inability to deal with loss, her bigoted nature and her selfishness made her easily susceptible to evil. Phoebe’s selfishness and willingness to use shortcuts in life made her easily susceptible to evil. And Paige’s self-righteousness, ruthlessness and penchant for being both judgmental and sadistic made her susceptible. Everyone . . . whether in real life or in fiction have personality traits that makes them susceptible to evil. Why Constance Burge could not accept this and instead, used this Nexus Theory to explain Phoebe’s personal flaws eludes me. Perhaps Burge wanted an easier plot device to describe Phoebe’s personality . . . instead of good old-fashioned, well-written characterization.\n\nI cannot deny that I have always enjoyed “Is There a Woogeyman in the House?”. It has always been one of my favorite episodes from Season One. But this theory about the Nexus and Phoebe’s moral compass nearly ruined it for me. It is a crap theory, supported by bad writing. Instead of recognizing that just about anyone – namely any sentient being – can choose a path of good or evil, given the right circumstances or emotional button pushed. But Constance Burge and this episode’s writers decided to resort to easy and sloppy characterization by feeding the viewers this black-and-morality crap that the Nexus would explain Phoebe’s occasional delinquent behavior. It seemed like a bad ending to an otherwise pretty good episode.\n\n“CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT . . . OR REGRESSION?”\n\nRecently, I had read Lisa Eiseman’s review of the “CHARMED” Season Five episode, (5.21) “Necromancing the Stone” and found the following:\n\n“Phoebe has always sought out the stronger “alpha” male, and really is best when she is the “damsel in distress” needing rescuing. She has an innate need to be watched over, her own self-assurance was very low when the audience was introduced to her five years ago. Over the years her confidence grew, only to be beat down after Cole’s second turn to the dark side. Yet, her self confidence has been getting stronger and stronger this season after fighting and vanquishing Cole and, of course, her success in the business world. However, this episode only showed how much further she has come in shying away from dependency. Instead of taking Jason’s offer, she realizes that she can exist on her own and still be a strong woman and witch.”\n\nMs. Eiseman’s words had led me to thinking about Phoebe Halliwell’s development on “CHARMED”. I must admit that I agree with her original statement about Phoebe. She has always been the type who wanted an “alpha male” to look over her. A recent example is a description of a scene from the Season Eight episode (5.17)”Generation Hex”:\n\n“Cole does appear in a few flashbacks — once in his first meeting with Phoebe when he grabs her calf (Coops says it was a cute meet but Present Phoebe just tells Coop that Cole was setting her up, and another flashback from “Cenntenial Charmed” when Phoebe throws the potion vial at him and Coop hugs Present Phoebe as Cole vanquishes into flames.”\n\nNot only does the above statement verified Ms. Eiseman’s statement that Phoebe will always require an alpha male in her life (at some point, Prue had served this role before Phoebe met Cole Turner aka Belthazor), but that Phoebe had never overcame this desire. Even as late as the series’ last season, she was using Coop (a Cupid) as the role of “prince charming” or “knight-in-shining armor” in her life.\n\nI disagreed with Ms. Eiseman’s statement on one matter. I DO NOT believe that Phoebe had displayed any strength when she finally rejected Cole in Season Five. In fact, I believe that she had behaved in a cowardly manner. Instead of facing the troubles of her marriage, she ran away. Neither she or her sisters had ever bothered to find out back in late Season Four or early Season Five how Cole became the Source. When he finally came back, she pushed him away – refusing to discuss their problems or what happened. I cannot help but feel that if Phoebe had not done this, she could have learned the truth about the Source’s possession of Cole. But she never did. Instead, she pushed Cole aside and ran away. And her behavior eventually drove Cole to an emotional breakdown by mid Season Five.\n\nHad Cole been wrong in his attempt to keep Phoebe in his life? Yes. In the late Season Three episode (3.19) “The Demon Who Came in from the Cold”, he had proven with his decision to infiltrate the Brotherhood of the Thorn that he was capable of making a morally correct decision without Phoebe’s encouragement or approval. But one-and-a-half years later, Cole seemed incapable of remaining “good” (if that is the word most fans are willing to accept) without Phoebe in his life, because of his fervent desire to hold on to his marriage. Cole was wrong in his attempt to cling to Phoebe to make his life better. But Phoebe was wrong to push him away, especially when she knew that he was on the verge of an emotional breakdown.\n\nThe show’s portrayal of the sisters’ emotional breakdowns in compared to Cole’s struck me as interesting . . . and perhap hypocritical. Prue had suffered an emotional breakdown in (3.16) “Death Takes a Halliwell” and nearly beaten a Seeker to death for the wrong reason. Cole had to stop her from succumbing to her anger. Piper in (4.03) “Hell Hath No Fury” and Phoebe in (3.21) “Look Who’s Barking” suffered from emotional breakdowns and found themselves at the mercy of supernatural entities due to their inabilities to get over their problems. The writers made sure that the viewers would be sympathetic to the sisters’ angst . . . even when they were doing wrong. But when Cole had his own breakdown in mid-Season Five, the writers had expected the viewers to be glad to see Phoebe pushing him away . . . even when he tried to commit suicide twice. What makes this worse is that by the end of the series, Phoebe never had the guts or was too blind to realize that BOTH she and Cole were responsible for the failure of their marriage – and not just Cole. In the end, Cole had erroneously believed that he could not stay good without Phoebe in his life. And the Halliwells’ continuous declarations that he was “evil” did not help overcome this state of mind. Alyssa Milano had once stated that Cole was nothing more than a “bad boy” for Phoebe to indulge in for at least two years of her life. I hate to say this, but I still find Ms. Milano’s statement very hard to accept. In my opinion, I believe that Phoebe was simply too immature to deal with being involved with someone as complex as Cole. She wanted a one-note heroic alpha male. And Cole proved to be a complex individual who proved capable of great evil and goodness – something that Phoebe could never handle or deal with. What am I saying? She could never deal with the murky moral compass of anyone close to her, let alone within herself.\n\nIn another passage of Ms. Eiseman’s review of “Necromancing the Stone”, she claimed the following:\n\n“However, this episode only showed how much further she (Phoebe) has come in shying away from dependency. Instead of taking Jason’s offer, she realizes that she can exist on her own and still be a strong woman and witch.”\n\nApparently, Ms. Eiseman had been premature in this assessment of Phoebe. The latter eventually did accept Jason Dean’s offer to accompany him to Hong Kong. And in the course of their ten-month relationship, had failed to tell him that she was a witch. He had accidentally discovered this in (6.13) “Used Karma”. Why? Because Phoebe had been afraid that such a revelation would end her relationship with the millionaire (or billionaire). Ironically, it was Phoebe’s ten-month deception that eventually destroyed the relationship and not her role as a witch. The end of her relationship with Jason signaled the end of a two-year fervent search for Phoebe to find her “true love” and a father for her future baby. In the end, Phoebe still needed a man . . . and apparently a child, to find meaning in her life. And she found Coop – a “prince charming” who obviously did not have any problems with serving as Phoebe’s “alpha male protector”, if that scene in “Generation Hex” was anything to go by.\n\nDid Phoebe Halliwell ever developed as a character? I cannot honestly answer “yes”. Granted, many fans will argue that Phoebe eventually acquired a career. She also moved out of the house . . . something I believe that she had to do in order to stop revolving her life around her sisters. Moving out of the house may have helped her learn to become Phoebe Halliwell, instead of part of the Charmed Ones. But in the end, I do not think that Phoebe really developed as a character.\n\nMany believe that her romance with Cole had stunted her growth. I agree. But unlike others, I do not believe it was Cole’s fault. I believe that Phoebe could not handle dealing with the moral ambiguity that he represented. As her half-sister Paige Mathews once stated, whenever Phoebe found any of her relationships in trouble, instead of dealing with it, she ran away from her problems. I believe she did just that with Cole by pushing him away. She did the same with Leslie St. Clair in early Season Seven. And with Jason Dean and Dex Lawson, she had resorted to lies to avoid any problems that might arise with them discovering her role as a witch.\n\nWith Coop, one of the Cupids, she finally got her knight-in-shining armor or her “alpha male protector”. But she did so without really developing as a character. Personally, I find that sad. Phoebe Halliwell got her fairy tale ending without really developing as a character.\n\n“WHAT WENT WRONG WITH ‘CHARMED’?”\n\nWhat happened with the original “CHARMED” (1998-2006) series? How did a show that for a brief period, used to be one of my top ten favorites ended up as something for me to be derisive about?\n\nWell, below are what I believe are the three major traits that contributed to the show’s decline (at least for me) – morality, portrayal of men and magical powers.\n\nMorality:\n\nFor me, this was a major problem with the series. The audience was led to believe that the Halliwell sisters aka the Charmed Ones were the epitome of goodness, yet the writers have allowed them to get away with some very despicable acts. I am not one of those who demand that protagonists of a fictional story – whether in print, movies, plays or television – be flawless or ideal. I realize this is impossible, due to human nature. But I believe that when a work of fiction allows its protagonist to make a mistake or crime, I believe the writers should allow that character to face the consequences of his or her actions. Unfortunately, this rarely happened on “CHARMED” – especially in regard to the Charmed Ones and their whitelighter, Leo Wyatt. On the other hand, the Charmed Ones, Leo and the series’ show runners and writers made certain that others – like Cole Turner – pay the price for their actions. Whether they deserved it or not.\n\nPiper Halliwell’s Purchase of Illegal Fruit – In the Season Two episode, (2.12) “Awakened”, a greedy Piper had purchased illegal fruit from South America that had not been inspected by U.S. Customs for a cheap price. She had plans to serve the fruit to her customers at her P3 bar. After sampling the fruit, Piper became afflicted with a deadly disease called “Oroyo Fever”. First, her sisters Prue and Phoebe used a spell to save her life by directing the disease from her body to an ninja action figure toy owned by another patient. This act led to other patients in the hospital being afflicted by the disease. Eventually, Prue and Phoebe reversed the spell and Piper became afflicted again. In the end, Leo used his whitelighter ability to cure Piper.\n\nSince Leo had used magic for personal gain, he lost his whitelighter wings . . . temporarily. The Charmed Ones, on the other hand, did not pay any price whatsoever for their actions in this episode. Piper managed to survive and did not face any illegal prosecution for breaking Federal law. Also, Prue and Phoebe did not pay any price for using magic for personal gain and threatening the lives of innocents in the process. On the other hand, Piper’s miraculous recovery attracted the attention of physician, Dr. Curtis Williamson. His determination to learn how she had recovered so quickly led to him temporarily possessing the Charmed Ones powers and his death in a later episode, (2.20) “Astral Monkey”. While Piper had lamented over not answering one of his earlier requests for a medical examination, neither she or her sisters felt any guilt over how their actions in “Awakened” led to Dr. Williamson’s death in “Astral Monkey”.\n\nThe 48-Hour Window of Opportunity Rule – According to the Season Four premiere, (4.01-4.02) “Charmed Again”, the Whitelighters (“good”) and the demons (“evil”) had made a compromise regarding the moral compass of witches. This compromise created a period of forty-eight hours for a witch to decide his or her alliance or moral path. Frankly, I thought this was a dumb idea ever created by Brad Kern or one of his writers. The idea that the Elders’ Council and the Source’s Council had the authority to give a new witch a specific time period of free will to choose between good and evil is ludicrous. That witch or any other individual should constantly have some semblance of free will to choose any particular path . . . should have been regarded as a natural right. What made this rule even more ludicrous is once a witch makes up his or her mind, he/she will remain either good or evil until death. What on earth? This whole “Window of Opportunity” rule smacks of a fairy tale for children and not for a series about adult women. What Kern had failed to remember that life is uncertain, which means there are no real absolutes upon which one can depend. In other words, if Paige had chosen evil, her decision could never be regarded as absolute. In the real world . . . or in a well-written story, there would be no real absolute. Not only was this rule a prime example of how the series’ black-and-white morality stagnated the series’ writing development, it also appeared in the “CHARMED” reboot series. Pity.\n\nDarryl Morris’ Soul – In Season Six’s (6.01-6.02) “Valhalley of the Dolls”, two of the Charmed Ones, Phoebe and half-sister Paige Matthews had committed a despicable act with the psychic rape of their close friend, Inspector Detective Darryl Morris. The pair used a spell to strip Darryl of his soul without his consent. They had committed this despicable act in order to free Leo from Valhalla (Norse/Viking version of heaven) and have him remove a spell he had cast on Piper. Phoebe and Paige’s act should have had major consequences for them. Instead, the writers treated this act of psychic rape as a joke and dismissed the whole matter with Darryl lamely and quickly forgiving them. I was disgusted by this episode.\n\nRick Gittridge’s Murder – Phoebe and Paige had committed another despicable act in the Season Six episode, (6.17) “Hyde School Reunion”. Nervous over facing former classmates at a high school reunion, Phoebe had cast a spell on herself, regressing her personality to her seventeen year-old self. While under this spell, she used magic to help a former high school classmate named Rick Gittridge escape from prison. Eventually, Phoebe recovered from her spell and realized she had a convict who knew she was a witch on her hands.\n\nWhen Rick held her and Paige at gunpoint and demanded that they change his face so that he could avoid the police, Paige obliged, at Phoebe’s urging, by giving him the face of their nephew and Piper and Leo’s younger son, Chris Halliwell. What Rick did not know and the sisters did was Chris was on the run from a group of Scabber demons that he had angered. So . . . instead of teleporting the gun from Rick’s hand and sending him back to prison with his memories wiped, Paige transformed his face to resemble Chris’. The Scabber demons saw Rick with Chris’ face and promptly killed him before disappearing. And both Phoebe and Paige – to my utter disgust – declared their action had been necessary. In other words, Phoebe and Paige got away with cold-blooded murder thanks to Brad Kern’s misplaced sense of justice.\n\nAlliance with the Avatars – Another major crime that the Halliwells had committed was helping the Avatars (an ancient group of extremely powerful magical beings) change the world by removing any dark thoughts from the human race and committing genocide against demons … all so that they can selfishly lead happy lives and not hunt demons. This little act, which had occurred in (7.12) “Extreme Makeover: World Edition”, resulted in the psychic rape of the world’s population and the deaths of those few who were not affected by the spell. And what happened after the following episode, (7.13) “Charmeggedon”? Leo paid the price for his part in the spell with the loss of his whitelighter wings and position as an Elder. Yet the sisters – especially Piper – avoided any consequences for their actions. Again. Instead, they blamed the Avatars for not telling them everything and the Elders for driving Leo into becoming an Avatar. This was so cowardly on so many levels. At this point, my opinion of the Charmed Ones had sunk to a new low. Their unwillingness to learn any lesson from their own mistake and blame others disgusted me to my core.\n\nCole Turner aka Belthazor’s First Death and the Source – Sometime in early Season Four, Phoebe’s lover and former assassin – the demon/hybrid Cole Turner aka Belthazor – lost his magical powers due to an old potion made by the Charmed Ones back in Season Three, because a woman wanted revenge for his past killing of her fiance. When the sisters were threatened with death at the hands of the demonic leader known as the Source, Cole used a magical object to strip the villain of his magical powers and use them to save Phoebe and her sisters. Unfortunately for Cole, he ended up being possessed against his will by the Source’s spirit. Episodes like (4.14) “The Three Faces of Phoebe” and (4.16) “The Fifth Halliwell” had made it very clear that the Source had taken possession of Cole’s body. Instead of having the Charmed Ones discover this, Brad Kern and his writers had allowed them to succumb to their worst fears and prejudices regarding Cole’s past and kill him. To make matters worst, the sisters never found out in the following season that he had been an innocent victim of the Source. Instead, Kern and the writers dump some “Cole turns insane” story line in early Season Five on viewers in order to set in motion the character’s departure from the series in the shitty episode (5.12) “Centennial Charmed”. In doing this, show runner Brad Kern and staff writers had failed to allow the sisters a chance to discover their own potential for bigotry and evil and thus, kill any chance of them developing as characters. Only Prue had been given this chance in Season Three episodes like (3.15) “Just Harried” and (3.16) “Death Takes a Halliwell”.\n\nOther Magical Beings – The series’ “black-vs-white” morality had became a prime example of how people judge others on a purely superficial basis. Which the Halliwells had been guilty of. Look at Cole for example. The only reason Phoebe and her sisters had originally believed he possessed the potential for good was due to his human ancestry on his father’s side. For Phoebe and her sisters, Cole’s human half equated to good, and his demon half equated to evil. When Cole had lost his powers for the second time in Season Five (5.07) “Sympathy For the Demon”, the sisters’ whitelighter Leo Wyatt automatically judged him good, because he no longer had his “demonic” powers.\n\nThis all stemmed from the the series’ never ending habit of labeling certain powers as good (“witches, fairies, whitelighters, etc.”) or evil (“demons, darklighters, warlocks”), based on what kind of beings possessed them. I never understood why the series had continued to portray magical abilities in this infantile manner – especially for a show that was about adult women. “CHARMED” also made a big deal about witches not using their powers for personal gain. Yet, from what I have read about the Wiccan Rede (please correct me if I am wrong), personal gain is not even considered forbidden. Wiccans seemed to be more concerned with intent – using one’s powers to deliberately hurt another, forcing someone to do something against his or her will, or using magic on others without their consent, which the Halliwells were extremely guilty of in “Vahalley of the Dolls”, (6.17) “Hyde School Reunion” and “Extreme Makeover: World Edition”. And by the way, the Charmed Ones never paid any consequences for their transgressions.\n\nPhoebe, her sisters and Leo seemed incapable of accepting the possibility that ALL BEINGS, no matter who or what they are – have the potential for both good and evil within them. The show has refused to accept the possibility that demons have the potential for good and humans have the potential for great evil (with the exception of a few). To the series’ writers (and characters), a sentient being’s morality is mainly based upon WHAT he or she is, and not on the individual’s emotional state . . . OR CHOICES.\n\nThe reason I brought these issues is that Kern and the series’ writers had allowed the sisters to get away with major crimes. The sisters had paid the price for using their powers for minor acts – like Prue using her telekinesis to force an annoying neighbor, who had been allowing his dog to poop against their front steps, to step in said dog poop; and Phoebe using her premonition power to find the future father of her future child – but never for major acts that I had listed above. Also, I really wish that “CHARMED” had been more ambiguous and complex in its portrayal of morality. Everything was so simple-minded and childish. Demons/warlocks are all evil; humans are all good (unless there are no demons around). What exactly was wrong in portraying demons and other supernatural beings as morally ambiguous? What was wrong in the sisters learning that morality was not as simple and easy to label, as they have assumed for so many years?\n\nPortrayal of Men:\n\nAnother problem I had with “CHARMED” was its portrayal of many male characters. I understand that the series had wanted to portray women in a positive light – strong and intelligent. There was nothing wrong with that. By why did the series’ portrayal of men had to be basically negative? “CHARMED” was supposed to be about feminism. However, my idea of feminism was not male bashing or emasculation. Unfortunately, the series was guilty of both. During most of Seasons One and Two, the sisters had a tendency to make many unnecessary quips at the expense of the male gender. And there was the (2.05) “She’s a Man, Baby! She’s a Man!” episode that I would dearly love to forget. And what happened to male witches? I can only recall seeing one so-called male witch on the show – Max Franklin from (1.14) “Secrets and Guys” – and at age thirteen, he was too young to be practicing witchcraft.\n\nRegular Male Characters – Another problem is that most of the strong male characters on the show are either stripped of their power or dies. this happened to characters like Cole Turner, Andy Trudeau, Leo Wyatt, Chris Halliwell and Kyle Brody. The powerful half-demon Belthazor aka Cole ended up having his powers stripped in (4.08) “Black As Cole” and was “deemed safe” to marry Phoebe. And when he became more powerful than ever in Season Five, he was judged “evil and insane” and targeted for death by Kern and his writers in “Centennial Charmed”. Andy Trudeau, a strong-willed San Francisco cop who also happened to be Prue’s true love, ended up dead not long after he discovered that the sisters were witches at the end of Season One. Although Piper and Leo’s older son Wyatt became a very powerful witch, he was too young for the writers to do anything about it. Leo became a whitelighter Elder at the end of Season Five and later, an Avatar in early Season Seven. Thus the writers felt that they had to break him away from Piper. And they did not reunite the couple until Leo permanently became a mortal (aka “safe”). Both Chris (Piper and Leo’s younger son) and FBI Special Agent Kyle Brody (Paige’s love interest in Season Seven) were strong personalities who ended up dead – along with ex-demon named Drake who had decided to become a human. And how did the series end? With a powerless Leo, a non-magical husband for Paige, and a “Cupid” (magical being associated with love) for Phoebe to marry.\n\nDarryl Morris – One would notice that I did not mention Darryl Morris, the detective inspector from the San Francisco Police Department, who had known the Halliwells since the beginning. Darryl had began the series as Andy Trudeau’s partner. Following Andy’s death, Darryl became the sisters’ main non-magical contact between Seasons Two and Seven. The writers’ treatment of Darryl really annoyed me over the years. After Season Two, I got tired of him freaking out whenever faced with the sisters’ magic. Also, the sisters had badly mistreated him during Season Six . His soul was stripped from his body against his will in “Valhalley of the Dolls” by Phoebe and Paige. And he was was framed for murder by magical beings known as the Cleaners, who used him to cover up the Halliwells’ careless use of magic. When he had decided that he wanted nothing to do with the Charmed Ones (and I did not blame him) in late Season Six, the writers had treated as the bad guy for failing to forgive them for what happened to him. And when Darryl finally reconciled with them in Season Seven, he returned to being one of the sisters’ lap dogs. Leo became the other one.After years of watching the show, I found myself wondering if both Constance Burge and Brad Kern had become leery of the idea of the Halliwells being associated on a permanent basis with strong male characters. And I found that sad.\n\nMagical Powers:\n\nHow can I put this? One of the more confusing aspects of “CHARMED” has always been its portrayal of magic. The series’ portrayal of magical beings and various abilities have struck me as contradicting. Another problem with the series was that the show runners and the writers had allowed its black-and-white mentally to label what kind of abilities that its characters can practice.\n\nFire Ability – For example, according to the series, any ability to do with fire can only be possessed by evil magic practitioners like demons and warlocks. Why? Fire is an element, not something evil. The series had featured a witch in its premiere episode, (1.01) “Something Wicca Comes This Way” as a pyrokinetic. Later, a young foster child named Tyler Michaels in Season Four’s (4.12) “Lost and Bound” also had the ability to create fire. These were two rare cases in which “CHARMED” featured pyrokinetics who were not evil. However, the series eventually ret-conned Tyler as a Archai, an elemental being who could not only create fire, but use fire to create portals. Was Brad Kern uneasy over the idea of a minor protagonist being a mere fire starter? It certainly felt like it. Was the series’ portrayal of fire as something evil stemmed from religion? Again . . . it felt like it, but I cannot say for certain.\n\nThe Nexus – Another aspect of magic that I found ridiculous on “CHARMED” was the whole “Nexus Theory” from the episode (1.15) “Is There a Woogy in the House?”. An earthquake had revealed a magical entity called “the Woogeyman” that resided in the Charmed Ones’ basement. The sisters had learned that their home was located on top of a spiritual nexus – a location that was equidistant from the five spiritual elements. And because Phoebe had been born inside their home, her moral compass could easily swing from good to evil, in compare to her sisters. This was all bullshit, of course, since anyone can swing from good to evil or back, considering the circumstances. But what made this “Nexus Theory” even more laughable was that the five elements that played a role in it – earth, fire, water, wood and metal – are associated with Chinese philosophy, not Wiccan beliefs. The elements associated with Wicca are – earth, fire, water, air and spirit. Prue had claimed that the first list of elements were Wiccan, when they were actually associated with Chinese philosophy. Sigh!\n\nPaige Matthews’ Ability – Season Four had introduced a new member of the Halliwell family – half-sister, Paige Matthews. Paige was the creation of an affair between the sisters’ mother, Patricia “Patty” Halliwell and her whitelighter, Sam Wilder. With Prue no longer a member of the Charmed Ones, Paige had replaced her. Naturally, Brad Kern and his writers believed they had to create an ability for Paige that was similar to Prue’s telekinesis. And what was it? Well, the sisters dubbed it telekinetic orbing. Sigh! In a nutshell, when Paige wanted to move something or someone, her object would disappear in one spot and reappear in another. Does this sound familiar? Well it should. This ability is usually regarded as teleporting. But the objective is the same as telekinesis – moving someone or something from one spot to another. Because Paige’s father was a whitelighter and her ability manifested in white or blue orbs, her ability was labeled as telekinetic orbing. It would have been a lot easier for the writers to use the correct phrase for Paige’s ability – teleporting – and easier on the mouth for the actors. But alas . . .\n\nThe above are simply examples of the series’ rather odd and occasional erroneous portrayal of magic. If I truly wanted to delve into this subject, it would have required me to write another essay – a long one at that. So, I will end it right here.\n\nI have written other articles about “CHARMED” in which I had discussed issues I found problematic. But when it came to morality, male characters and magic abilities, I feel that the series had made its most obvious mistakes.\n\n“CHARMED RETROSPECTIVE: THE DEATH OF DR. WILLIAMSON”\n\nI just recently finished watching the Season Two episode from ”CHARMED” titled (2.20) “Astral Monkey” . There were some things that were said in this episode that really pissed me off. And all of my complaints centered around the character of Dr. Curtis Williamson.\n\nCurtis Williamson had first appeared in an earlier Season Two episode called (2.12) “Awakened”. In it, the second Charmed One sister, Piper Halliwell, became infected with a deadly disease called Arroyo Fever after eating some South American fruit she had purchased to serve at her club, P3. After her sisters (Prue and Phoebe) and later whitelighter Leo Wyatt had cured her by using magic, Williamson became obsessed in discovering the reason behind Piper’s miraculous recovery from a disease that had no cure.\n\nIn “Astral Monkey”, Williamson’s obsession not led him to continuously contact Piper by letter, but use the Halliwells’ blood drawn by the doctor in “Awakened” to experiment on a trio of monkeys kept in his lab. Eventually, the Halliwells and Leo learned about Dr. Williamson’s experiments after the monkey with Prue’s abilities managed to astral project into the manor. Piper, Prue and Phoebe went to the hospital to examine Dr. Williamson’s laboratory and Leo consulted with his superiors, the Elders, after they discovered that the Charmed Ones’ blood had been accidentally injected into Dr. Williamson and he ended up with their abilities. The following is what Leo had to say on the matter:\n\nPiper: So what’s the bad news?\n\nLeo: Well, simply put, Dr. Williamson is cosmically screwed. He’s got your powers in his mortal body. It took generations to prepare you for that, you can handle it, he can’t.\n\nMortal body? Once again, the audience are led to believe that the Halliwells are not mortals. And yet, the series has proven time and again that they were. This point was specifically made in the Season Three episode, (3.22) “All Hell Breaks Loose”, when Piper died from a gunshot wound in the first timeline before the demon Tempus changed it on behalf of the Source and the whitelighter Elders.\n\nReturning back to the article’s topic, the following comment made by Leo really pissed me off:\n\nPhoebe: Wait, are you saying that our powers are in our blood and he injected himself with it?\n\nLeo: That blood, yeah. See, the spell that you cast to cure Piper changed everything and now it’s changing Dr. Williamson. See, your magic is meant for doing good but in the wrong person, somebody not ready for it, that need to do good things . . .\n\nPiper: Could go bad?\n\nLeo: Real bad. Piper, it’s nobody’s fault. Dr. Williamson chose his own path. This is not the consequence of anybody’s actions except his own. Still, you have to find a way to stop him before things get worse.\n\nOne, Leo had claimed that the spell Prue and Phoebe had used to cure Piper in “Awakened” was partly responsible for the Halliwells’ abilities affecting Dr. Williamson . . . which makes no sense to me. But it got worse. Leo further claimed that none of them – Piper, Prue, Phoebe, and himself – were not responsible for Williamson’s abuse of their abilities and the latter’s effect upon him. Only Williamson was to blame.\n\nLeo . . . Let me take a deep breath, here. Showrunner Constance Burge and David Simkins, who wrote “Astral Monkey”, really got the whitelighter’s character down pat in this episode. It seemed quite obvious – at least to me – that Leo’s feelings for Piper have constantly led him to spout stupid lies in order to placate any negative feelings she or her sisters might be experiencing. In “Astral Monkey”, she felt guilty for failing to respond to his letters about her recovery from Arroyo Fever. She was also upset because he was a mortal that she and her sisters had to kill in order to save others. Not once did Piper feel upset that her act of greed in “Awakening” had led to this situation with Williamson.\n\nAfter listening to Leo’s attempt to solely blame Williamson over the entire incident, I still find it amazing how fans continue to condemn Brad Kern for some of the series’ bad writing, when Burge was also responsible for the crap that popped up during her tenure as executive producer of “CHARMED”. And I am condemning Burge for an act that Kern eventually committed with great consistency in the series’ future – namely give the Halliwells slack for some of their questionable actions? Yes, I am. Why? Because Burge did the same in regard to what happened in “Awakened and “Astral Monkey”.\n\nI am quite certain that Curtis Williamson had been partially responsible for the violence he had committed in “Astral Monkey”, while using the Halliwells’ powers. After all, he became obsessed with finding the source of Piper’s “miraculous” cure from Arroyo Fever in “Awakened”. Even the hospital’s Chief of Staff, Dr. Jeffries, had warned him to allow the matter to drop. But the Halliwells and Leo should have accepted some of the blame over the entire situation. And Burge refused to allow this to happen in her script. Back in “Awakened”, Prue and Phoebe used magic to cure Piper’s fever, when they should not have done so in the first place. After the pair reversed the spell and Piper fell ill for the second time, Leo stepped in and cured her . . . when he should not have done so. Because of Prue, Phoebe and Leo’s actions, Piper managed to avoid facing the consequences of her actions. And it was Piper who had started this whole mess in motion when she became greedy and decided to purchase South American fruit that had not been inspected by U.S. Customs. She had committed a Federal crime and did not pay any consequences, aside from P3 being shut down by health officials . . . for one day. One fucking day.\n\nIt had been bad enough when Vivian and Valerie Mayhew’s script for “Awakened” had failed to allow Piper face any legal ramifications from the U.S. government for her act of greed. After all, the episode never mentioned any legal fines and as I had earlier pointed out, P3 had only been closed for a day . . . before Leo cured her. But in the story for “Astral Monkey”, Constance Burge had failed to bring up all of the Halliwells and Leo’s past transgressions from the other episode. Instead, she decided to lay all of the blame on Williamson’s shoulders. Prue and Phoebe did not even seem the worse for wear following Williamson’s death at the end of the episode. As for Piper, she only felt guilty for not being able to save Williamson and for failing to respond to his letters in the first place. Not once did the episode’s script allow Piper to express any guilt for allowing her greed in “Awakened” to set everything in motion.\n\nFor two episodes considered to among the best from Season Two by the series’ fans, I find it interesting that both managed to fill me with disgust from its portrayals of the main characters. Even worse, the only character who ended up facing consequences from questionable choices happened to be one portrayed by guest star Matthew Glave, who had portrayed Curtis Williamson. And I find it ironic that I have Constance Burge, and not the much maligned Brad Kern, to blame these particular travesties."
