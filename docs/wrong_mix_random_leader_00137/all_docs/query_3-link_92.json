Sometimes, just thinking about certain situations or things, like our children, current events in the world, things going on in our workplace, health conditions, can send us spiraling and cause us worry. In those moments, we need to remember to place our troubles at the foot of the cross and ask for the peace of God to be with us.\n\nThese are some Bible verses to calm anxiety that say exactly that.\n\nPsalm 23:4 (NIV)\n\n“Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me.”\n\nGod will not abandon you. Bible verses about anxiety remind us that we do not need to fear evil or uncertain events, because God will walk with us through these valleys. He loves us and wants the best for us. The Psalmist knew that the peace of God would be with him wherever he went and whatever situations he encountered. Know that God is right beside you during those difficult times.\n\nPhilippians 4:6 (NIV)\n\n“Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.”\n\nWhen something painful or unexpected is happening it’s easy to become consumed by it.

As hard as this can be, Bible verses on anxiety tell us we can never go wrong with invoking God in good times and bad.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Comforting Bible Verses for Stress Relief\n\nIn \"Eleanor's Bench,\" Eleanor becomes increasingly worried and anxious about Drayvon's future in the foster care system.

It's only when Eleanor's best friend reminds her to pray to God for Drayvon's safety and that she gives God control of the situation when she finds herself free.\n\n2 Corinthians 4:16-18 (NIV)\n\n“Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.”\n\nBible verses about anxiety tell us to fix our eyes on what is unseen — on God’s undying love and the pease He provides. Rather than losing heart, we’re told in bible verses for anxiety to be renewed and to grow inside our hearts. No matter what’s happening in our lives, there’s a greater plan and a more powerful love that can sustain and guide us through the storm.\n\nLuke 12:25-26 (NIV)\n\n“Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life? Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?”\n\nLuke 12:25-26 poses a unique challenge to us all, as it asks what worry and fear can add to our lives. It's easy to get caught up in worrying about our lives and the little things, but this BIble verse tells us to stop, take a step back and remember what's important in life.

You believe in God; believe also in me.”\n\nThis Bible verse about fear comes directly after Jesus tells His disciples that one of them will betray Him and that Peter will publicly deny Him.

This Bible verse for anxiety is a reminder that all of us need when we are facing stressful situations.\n\nRomans 8:38-39 (NIV)\n\nFor I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nWe all face struggles, uncertainties, fear and anxiety.

It's easy in those moments when we're going through persecution to feel separated from God. When we're dealing with those situations, we can feel anxious and feel like God has abandoned us. Rev. Dave stood up to those who persecuted him, though, because he knew that even their judgments and accusations could not separate him from God's love and protection.\n\nPsalm 56:3-4 (NIV)\n\nWhen I am afraid, I put my trust in you. In God, whose word I praise—in God I trust and am not afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?\n\nThis Psalm was written by David, a man who intimately knew fear and anxiety.
