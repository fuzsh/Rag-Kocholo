        "text": "Psalm 23 is one of the most popular and recognizable Psalms of all time – and even perhaps one of the most well-known passages in the entire Holy Bible. Walk into any Church building worldwide, and you’re likely to find it somewhere as part of the decor. But Psalm 23 is much more than just a nice piece of poetry. It is a reminder from Heaven of the Peace of God. A peace that transcends all understanding, guarding our heart, mind, and soul. It’s a piece of literature that’s just as relevant to us today – in our every day lives – as it was centuries ago. So what does this famous psalm mean to us? Let’s look at it piece by piece and see what we can discover.\n\nPsalm 23:1-3: “The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for His Name’s sake.”\n\nDavid, the Psalmist, sets the scene by showing us a beautiful picture of our relationship with God. He compares us to sheep who are being led by an all-knowing, all-loving Shepherd. Yet this Shepherd, our Shepherd, is not forceful, easily angered, or selfish. He teaches us how to obey Him for our good and for His glory. He provides for all our needs and gives us life-everlasting.\n\nPsalm 23:4: “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.”\n\nIn life, we are bound to face situations of darkness and tribulation. But here, David reminds us that we are not without hope. We don’t have to fear any evil – ever. God is surrounding us with His presence and covering us with His mighty power wherever we go.\n\nPsalm 23:5: “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.”\n\nWhen the world seems to be against us, God is for us. The word “anointed” simply means to be set apart for God’s purpose. God has delivered us from the hand of the enemy and given us a new mission – to declare His praise among the nations.\n\nPsalm 23:6: “Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the House of the Lord forever.”\n\nDavid ends the Psalm with a hopeful, uplifting message: God’s blessing will be over us for as long as we live. And even after we perish from this earth, we will depart to somewhere far better – the dwelling place of God Himself.\n\nPsalm 23 is such a powerful Psalm to read in every season of life — especially today. When you feel like you’ve gone astray, when life seems out of control, just close your eyes and imagine God — the Good Shepherd — leading you back home. Though we live in a chaotic world, we can find peace and rest in Jesus Christ. His Word is always refreshing, always restorative, and always transformational. Even in our darkest moments, God will use His Word to remind us that we are loved, valued, and cared for — forever and ever amen.\n\n“We have all things and abound; not because [we] have a good store of money in the bank, not because [we] have skill and wit with which to win [our] bread, but because the Lord is [our] Shepherd” ―Charles Spurgeon."
