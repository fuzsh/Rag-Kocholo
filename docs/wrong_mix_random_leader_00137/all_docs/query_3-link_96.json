        "text": "The most common phrase in the Bible is various forms of “Do not be afraid.”\n\nSome think it’s found 365 times, but it actually appears a little less. One site said it appears 117 times, while another said it appears in various forms around 300 times.\n\nWhile the daily Bible inspiration crowd might be a bit disappointed, “do not be afraid” is still the most common phrase in the Bible.\n\n10 Bible verses about not being afraid.\n\nKeep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” So we can confidently say, “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear; what can man do to me?” (Hebrews 13:5-6)\n\nYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. (Psalm 23:4)\n\nFear not, for I am with you; Be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.' (Isaiah 41:10)\n\nFor God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. (2 Timothy 1:7)\n\nBe strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you.\" (Deuteronomy 31:6)\n\nWhen I am afraid, I put my trust in you. In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can flesh do to me? (Psalm 56:3-4)\n\nGod is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble at its swelling. (Psalm 46:1-3)\n\nPeace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. (John 14:27)\n\nYou drew near on the day I called on You, And said, \"Do not fear!\" (Lamentations 3:57)\n\nAnd when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, \"Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last. (Revelation 1:17)\n\nGod is with us.\n\nThe command to “not be afraid” is connected to God being with us as His people. Though terrible things may happen to us, God will never leave us or forsake us.\n\nThis reassurance - that with God we are never alone - provides Christians with comfort to endure through difficult and perhaps frightening times.\n\nSome of the Christians in Smyrna were about to experience suffering. Jesus comforts them by telling them that He was waiting to give them the crown of victory.\n\nDo not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. (Revelation 2:10)\n\nGod knew we needed constant reminders that He is with us and that we shouldn’t be afraid. These reminders should change our thinking and cause us to realize that no matter what we face - we are never alone.\n\nFor our Shepherd walks with us."
