        "text": "BOOK REVIEW | RECOMMENDATION\n\nAs a longtime Patterson reader and Cross enthusiast, I think it would be safe to say this is genuine Patterson. Typically, Patterson doesn’t collaborate on the Cross series. The information, tone, and writing style remain the same in Fear No Evil as in the other Cross novels.\n\nGenerally, when he collaborates on a book, he includes the author’s name on the cover. Like the Billy Harney, Mike Bennet, and Emmy Dockery series, he has corroborated with David Ellis. Though in defense of many of those ghostwriters, they are good; they’re just not James Patterson.\n\nIntroduction & Some Questions about Cross Answered\n\nIf you’re a fan of James Patterson, you will enjoy his latest novel, Fear No Evil. This book is the 29th installment in the popular Cross series, and it follows detective Alex Cross as he investigates a series of gruesome murders. With its fast-paced plot and thrilling suspense, Fear No Evil is sure to keep you entertained from beginning to end."
