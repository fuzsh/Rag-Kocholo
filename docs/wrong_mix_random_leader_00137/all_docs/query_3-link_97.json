        "text": "The psalms are rich in imagery, feeling, and symbolism. They powerfully express the suffering and pain, the hope and trust of people of every age and culture. Above all the psalms sing of faith in God, of revelation and redemption. They enable the assembly to pray in the words that Jesus himself used during his life on earth. Jesus, who knew anguish and the fear of death, 'offered up prayer and entreaty, aloud and in silent tears, to the one who had the power to save him out of death… Although he was Son, he learned to obey through suffering; but having been made perfect, he became for all who obey him the source of eternal salvation…' (Hebrews 5:7-9). In the psalms the members of the assembly pray in the voice of Christ, who intercedes on their behalf before the Father. The Church, like Christ, turns again and again to the psalms as a genuine expression of grief and of praise and as a sure source of trust and hope in times of trial. Priests and other ministers are, therefore, to make an earnest effort through an effective catechesis to lead their communities to a clearer and deeper grasp of at least some of the psalms provided for the funeral rites.\n\nThe psalms are designated for use in many places in the funeral rites (for example, as responses to the readings, for the processions, for use at the vigil for the deceased). Since the psalms are songs, whenever possible, they should be sung.\n\n– Order of Christian Funerals, General Introduction, nos. 25-26\n\nFrom the Lectionary for Mass, no. 1013\n\nPsalm 23:1-3, 4, 5, 6\n\nR/. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.\n\nor:\n\nR/. Though I walk in the valley of darkness, I fear no evil, for you are with me.\n\nThe LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.\n\nin verdant pastures he gives me repose;\n\nBeside restful waters he leads me;\n\nhe refreshes my soul.\n\nHe guides me in right paths\n\nfor his name sake. R/.\n\nEven though I walk in the dark valley\n\nI fear no evil; for you are at my side\n\nWith your rod and your staff\n\nthat give me courage. R/.\n\nYou spread the table before me\n\nin the sight of my foes;\n\nYou anoint my head with oil;\n\nmy cup overflows. R/.\n\nOnly goodness and kindness follow me\n\nall the days of my life;\n\nAnd I shall dwell in the house of the Lord\n\nfor years to come. R/.\n\nPsalm 25:6 and 7b, 17-18, 20-21\n\nR/. To you, O Lord, I lift my soul.\n\nor:\n\nR/. No one who waits for you, O Lord, will ever be put to shame.\n\nRemember that your compassion, O LORD,\n\nand your kindness are from of old.\n\nIn your kindness remember me,\n\nbecause of your goodness, O LORD. R/.\n\nRelieve the troubles of my heart;\n\nAnd bring me out of my distress.\n\nPut an end to my affliction and my suffering;\n\nand take away all my sins. R/.\n\nPreserve my life and rescue me;\n\nlet me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.\n\nLet integrity and uprightness preserve me,\n\nBecause I wait for you, O LORD. R/.\n\nPsalm 27:1, 4, 7 and 8b and 9a, 13-14\n\nR/. The Lord is my light and my salvation.\n\nor:\n\nR/. I believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.\n\nThe LORD is my light and my salvation;\n\nwhom should I fear?\n\nThe LORD is my life's refuge;\n\nof whom should I be afraid? R/.\n\nOne thing I ask of the LORD;\n\nthis I seek:\n\nTo dwell in the house of the LORD\n\nall the days of my life.\n\nThat I may gaze on the loveliness of the LORD\n\nand contemplate his temple. R/.\n\nHear, O LORD, the sound of my call;\n\nhave pity on me, and answer me.\n\nYour presence, O LORD, I seek.\n\nHide not your face from me. R/.\n\nI believe that I shall see the bounty of the LORD\n\nin the land of the living.\n\nWait for the LORD with courage;\n\nbe stouthearted, and wait for the LORD. R/.\n\nPsalm 42:2, 3, 5cdef; 43:3, 4, 5\n\nR/. My soul is thirsting for the living God: when shall I see him face to face?\n\nAs the hind longs for the running waters,\n\nso my soul longs for you, O God. R/.\n\nAthirst is my soul for God, the living God.\n\nWhen shall I go and behold the face of God? R/.\n\nI went with the throng and led them in procession\n\nto the house of God.\n\nAmid loud cries of joy and thanksgiving,\n\nwith the multitude keeping festival. R/.\n\nSend forth your light and your fidelity;\n\nthey shall lead me on\n\nAnd bring me to your holy mountain,\n\nto your dwelling-place. R/.\n\nThen will I go in to the altar of God,\n\nthe God of my gladness and joy;\n\nThen will I give you thanks upon the harp,\n\nO God, my God! R/.\n\nWhy are you downcast, O my soul?\n\nWhy do you sigh within me?\n\nHope in God! For I shall again be thanking him,\n\nin the presence of my savior and my God. R/.\n\nPsalm 63:2, 3-4, 5-6, 8-9\n\nR/. My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.\n\nO God, you are my God whom I seek;\n\nfor you my flesh pines and my soul thirsts\n\nlike the earth, parched, lifeless and without water. R/.\n\nThus have I gazed toward you in the sanctuary\n\nto see your power and your glory,\n\nFor your kindness is a greater good than life;\n\nmy lips shall glorify you. R/.\n\nThus will I bless you while I live;\n\nlifting up my hands, I will call upon your name.\n\nAs with the riches of a banquet shall my soul be satisfied,\n\nand with exultant lips my mouth shall praise you. R/.\n\nYou are my help,\n\nand in the shadow of your wings I shout for joy.\n\nMy soul clings fast to you;\n\nyour right hand upholds me. R/.\n\nPsalm 103:8 and 10, 13-14, 15-16, 17-18\n\nR/. The Lord is kind and merciful.\n\nor:\n\nR/. The salvation of the just comes from the Lord.\n\nMerciful and gracious is the LORD,\n\nslow to anger, and abounding in kindness.\n\nNot according to our sins does he deal with us,\n\nnor does he requite us according to our crimes. R/.\n\nAs a father has compassion on his children,\n\nso the LORD has compassion on those who fear him.\n\nFor he knows how we are formed,\n\nhe remembers that we are dust. R/.\n\nMan's days are like those of grass;\n\nlike a flower of the field he blooms;\n\nThe wind sweeps over him and he is gone,\n\nand his place knows him no more. R/.\n\nBut the kindness of the LORD is from eternity,\n\nto eternity toward those who fear him,\n\nAnd his justice toward children's children\n\namong those who keep his covenant\n\nand remember to fulfill his precepts. R/.\n\nPsalm 116:5, 6, 10-11, 15-16ac\n\nR/. I will walk in the presence of the Lord in the land of the living.\n\nor:\n\nR/. Alleluia.\n\nGracious is the LORD and just;\n\nyes, our God is merciful. R/.\n\nThe LORD keeps the little ones;\n\nI was brought low, and he saved me. R/.\n\nI believed, even when I said,\n\n\"I am greatly afflicted\";\n\nI said in my alarm,\n\n\"No man is dependable.\" R/.\n\nPrecious in the eyes of the LORD\n\nis the death of his faithful ones.\n\nO LORD, I am your servant,\n\nyou have loosed my bonds. R/.\n\nPsalm 122:1-2, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9\n\nR/. I rejoiced when I heard them say: let us go to the house of the Lord.\n\nor:\n\nR/. Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord.\n\nI rejoiced because they said to me,\n\n\"We will go up to the house of the LORD.\"\n\nAnd now we have set foot\n\nwithin your gates, O Jerusalem. R/.\n\nTo it the tribes go up,\n\nthe tribes of the LORD,\n\nAccording to the decree for Israel,\n\nto give thanks to the name of the LORD.\n\nIn it are set up judgment seats,\n\nseats for the house of David. R/.\n\nPray for the peace of Jerusalem!\n\nMay those who love you prosper!\n\nMay peace be within your walls,\n\nprosperity in your buildings. R/.\n\nBecause of my relatives and friends\n\nI will say \"Peace be within you!\"\n\nBecause of the house of the LORD, our God,\n\nI will pray for your good. R/.\n\nPsalm 130:1-2, 3-4, 5-6ab, 6c-7, 8\n\nR/. Out of the depths, I cry to you, Lord.\n\nor:\n\nR/. I hope in the Lord, I trust in his word.\n\nOut of the depths I cry to you, O LORD;\n\nLORD, hear my voice!\n\nLet your ears be attentive\n\nto my voice in supplication. R/.\n\nIf you, O LORD, mark iniquities,\n\nLORD, who can stand?\n\nBut with you is forgiveness,\n\nthat you may be revered. R/.\n\nI trust in the LORD;\n\nmy soul trusts in his word.\n\nMy soul waits for the LORD\n\nmore than the sentinels wait for the dawn. R/.\n\nMore than the sentinels wait for the dawn,\n\nlet Israel wait for the LORD,\n\nFor with the LORD is kindness\n\nand with him is plenteous redemption. R/.\n\nAnd he will redeem Israel\n\nfrom all their iniquities. R/.\n\nPsalm 143:1-2, 5-6, 7ab and 8ab, 10\n\nR/. O Lord, hear my prayer.\n\nO LORD, hear my prayer;\n\nhearken to my pleading in your faithfulness;\n\nin your justice answer me.\n\nAnd enter not into judgment with your servant,\n\nfor before you no living man is just. R/.\n\nI remember the days of old;\n\nI meditate on all your doings;\n\nthe works of your hands I ponder.\n\nI stretch out my hands to you;\n\nmy soul thirsts for you like parched land. R/.\n\nHasten to answer me, O LORD;\n\nfor my spirit fails me.\n\nAt dawn let me hear of your mercy,\n\nfor in you I trust. R/.\n\nTeach me to do your will,\n\nfor you are my God.\n\nMay your good spirit guide me\n\non level ground.
