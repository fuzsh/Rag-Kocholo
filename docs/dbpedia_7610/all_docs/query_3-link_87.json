Explore inspiring stories from our entrepreneurial alumni, and learn more about how we help prepare you for life after graduation.\n\nLearn more\n\nThe New School is implementing a financial aid guarantee beginning Fall 2024 for all programs. The guarantee gives students and families the certainty that their institutional scholarships and grants from us will never be reduced, even if financial circumstances change or after a semester with a less than ideal GPIA.\n\nLearn More\n\nThe New School admits students of any race, color, national and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national and ethnic origin in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs."
