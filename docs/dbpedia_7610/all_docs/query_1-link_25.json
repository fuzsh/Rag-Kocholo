Contemporary Art. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will consider the practice and theory of visual art in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Among the subjects that will drive our narrative will be the rise of postmodernism, pop art, the aesthetics of the social movements of the 1960s, institutional critique, the relationship between reproductive media and Feminism, the concept of spectacle, conceptual art, the appearance of a global art industry after 1989, the connections between art school and art-making, \"relational aesthetics,\" the fate of art in the age of the Internet, the art of the post-studio moment, and what happens to art when it engages with *everything*.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Jackson Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 15800, MADD 10006\n\nARTV 20010. Contemporary Art in Paris. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course, we will explore important institutions and contexts for exhibiting contemporary international art in the city of Paris. Our approach will be ethnographic as well as aesthetic and take place at various scales: from national museums to arts foundations, galleries, artist studios, and alternative spaces and artists' \"squats.\" Of special interest will be how different architectures and spaces of installation affect our reception and understanding of art. Video and moving image installation will be a special emphasis where possible. Course work will include presentations and weekly contributions to a public blog. Possible field trips could include the Musée d'art moderne de la ville de Paris, la Cinémathèque Française, Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain, Galerie Marion Goodman, Les Frigos, and the Paris Art Fair at the Grand Palais.\n\nARTV 20017. Art and the Archive in Greater Latin America. 100 Units.\n\nHow and why do artists engage records of the past in their work? What are the politics of both creating archives and culling from them to visually render or represent the past? Focusing on artists, art-making, and archives in Greater Latin America (including the United States), this course will consider the process of collecting and creating in artistic production from the perspectives of both theory and practice. Students in the course will work directly with archival materials in Chicago and collaborate on contemporary artistic projects that consider issues of relevance to people and places of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nInstructor(s): Diana Schwartz-Francisco Terms Offered: Course not offered in 24-25\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 26384, HIST 26319, CHST 26384, LACS 26384, ARTH 26384\n\nARTV 20018. Death Panels: Exploring dying and death through comics. 100 Units.\n\nWhat do comics add to the discourse on dying and death? What insights do comics provide about the experience of dying, death, caregiving, grieving, and memorialization? Can comics help us better understand our own wishes about the end of life? This is an interactive course designed to introduce students to the field of graphic medicine and explore how comics can be used as a mode of scholarly investigation into issues related to dying, death, and the end of life. The framework for this course intends to balance readings and discussion with creative drawing and comics-making assignments. The work will provoke personal inquiry and self-reflection and promote understanding of a range of topics relating to the end of life, including examining how we die, defining death, euthanasia, rituals around dying and death, and grieving. The readings will primarily be drawn from a wide variety of graphic memoirs and comics, but will be supplemented with materials from a variety of multimedia sources including the biomedical literature, philosophy, cinema, podcasts, and the visual arts. Guest participants in the course may include a funeral director, chaplain, hospice and palliative care specialists, cartoonists, and authors. The course will be taught by a nurse cartoonist and a physician, both of whom are active in the graphic medicine community and scholars of the health humanities.\n\nInstructor(s): Brian Callendar Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENGL 36230, KNOW 36230, ENGL 26230, HLTH 26230, HIPS 26230\n\nARTV 20025. Scene Painting. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is designed to introduce students to the theatrical art of scenic painting for the stage and film. A scenic artist is the hand of the theatrical designer, translating the small scale of the designer's rendering into full size theatrical environments. In this course, students will explore the unique tools and techniques used by scenic artists to create scenery. The end result of this class will be a basic mastery of painting \"faux\" surfaces and an understanding of how a scenic artist transforms the designer's ideas into realized pieces of theatrical art.\n\nInstructor(s): K. Boetcher Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Attendance for first class meeting is mandatory. This course is offered in alternate years. Please note a $30 fee for supplies and materials applies to this course.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): TAPS 27100\n\nARTV 20026. How Design Thinks. 100 Units.\n\nThis course seeks to develop an iterative design process by visiting locations on the university campus as well as in the city of Chicago to inform and inspire world building in an array of performance modalities from theater to gaming. Student projects will involve observation, research, illustration, and scale modelling. Individual as well as collaborative projects are possible. Returnable model-making kits containing basic supplies will be provided by the instructor for the duration of the course.\n\nInstructor(s): K. Boetcher Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): TAPS 27450\n\nARTV 20027. Site-Based Practice: Choreographing The Smart Museum. 100 Units.\n\nThis course gives students the unique opportunity to create a collaborative, site-based work that culminates in a final performance at UChicago's Smart Museum of Art. Using embodied research methods that respond to site through moving, sensing, and listening, we'll explore the relationship between the ephemerality of movement and the materiality of bodies and place, and consider how the site-based contexts for dance shift how it is perceived, experienced, and valued. Our quarter-long creation process will begin with a tour of the Smart Museum, guided by curators and members of the Public Practice team, that will provide context to the museum's exhibitions, programming, and its relationship to geography and community. Assigned readings, viewings, and conversations with guest artists will delve into the relationship between dance and the sites where it happens, including museums-from the material relationship between bodies, objects, and architecture to the digital flows of choreography online.\n\nInstructor(s): J. Rhoads Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): TAPS 36280, CHST 26280, ARTV 30027, ARCH 26280, TAPS 26280\n\nARTV 20029. Children & Architecture. 100 Units.\n\nMany who pursue architecture do so initially out of a childlike fascination with buildings, places and worlds. Curiosity and limited understanding naturally provide children with an exploratory relationship to the built environments they traverse, and children also often show a heightened sense of wonder -- heightened emotions of all kinds -- as that relationship plays out. (This can be positive and formative, or scary and traumatic.) And yet, many of the adults who make choices about the worlds we inhabit think mostly of adults, and as adults, in doing so. This architecture studio course investigates the built world through a child's eyes, across different moments in history, including our own. Readings and seminar discussions will range from playgrounds to blocks, preschools to family relations, swimming pools and sandcastles to the very construction of childhood as an idea. We will explore Chicago, and meet with builders of all ages, likely culminating in designing (and potentially building) a real playground space. While previous experience with architectural skills is not necessary to excel in this course, childlike curiosity is required.\n\nInstructor(s): L. Joyner Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): While this class does not require prior experience, all ARCH studio courses require consent. Starting February 12, please visit arthistory.uchicago.edu/archconsent to request instructor consent for this class or other ARCH studios. (Please do not send consent requests by email.)\n\nNote(s): The course is visiting the City Museum in St. Louis (a multi-story, artist-built playground for children and adults that defies description) for one day in advance of the course.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 24270, ENST 24270, ARTH 24270, CHST 24270, ARCH 24270\n\nARTV 20032. Chris Marker. 100 Units.\n\nChris Marker (1921-2012) is one of the most influential and important filmmakers to emerge in the post-war era in France, yet he remains relatively unknown to a wider audience. Marker's multifaceted work encompasses writing, photography, filmmaking, videography, gallery installation, television, and digital multimedia. He directed over 60 films and is known foremost for his \"essay films,\" a hybrid of documentary and personal reflection, which he invigorated if not invented with films like Lettre de Sibérie (Letter from Siberia, 1958) or Sans Soleil (Sunless, 1983). His most famous film, La Jetée (1962), his only (science) fiction film made up almost entirely of black-and-white still photographs, was the inspiration for Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys (1995). In 1990, he created his first multi-media installation, Zapping Zone, and in 1997 he experimented with the format of the CD-Rom to create a multi-layered, multimedia memoir (Immemory). In 2008, he continued his venture into digital spaces with Ouvroir, realized on the platform of Second Life. Marker was a passionate traveler who documented the journeys he took, the people he met, and revolutionary upheavals at home and afar. We will follow Marker's travels through time, space, and media, during which we will also encounter artists with whom he crossed paths, with whom he collaborated, or who were inspired by his work.\n\nInstructor(s): Dominique Bluher Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CMST 26303, MADD 13303, CMST 36303, FNDL 26102\n\nARTV 20033. Iconology East and West. 100 Units.\n\nIconology is the study of images across media and cultures. It is also associated with philosophical reflections on the nature of images and their relation to language-the interplay between the \"icon\" and the \"logos.\" A plausible translation of this compound word into Chinese would describe it as \"Words in Pictures, Pictures in Words\": 诗中有画，画中有诗. This seminar will explore the relations of word and image in poetics, semiotics, and aesthetics with a particular emphasis on how texts and pictures have been understood in the Anglo-European-American and Chinese theoretical traditions. The interplay of painting and poetry, speech and spectacle, audition and vision will be considered across a variety of media, particularly the textual and graphic arts. The aims of the course will be 1) to critique the simplistic oppositions between \"East\" and \"West\" that have bedevilled intercultural and intermedial comparative studies; 2) to identify common principles, zones of interaction and translation that make this a vital area of study. (Theory; 20th/21st)\n\nInstructor(s): WJT Mitchell Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): Enrollment in the course will be with the consent of instructor; it is open to students at all levels, but enrollment will be limited to 15. Students should send a one page statement of their interest to W. J. T. Mitchell (wjtm@uchicago.edu)\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 30033, CMLT 30230, ENGL 30230, CMLT 20230, ARTV 30033, ARTH 20033, ENGL 20230\n\nARTV 20035. Animation: Practices & Principles. 100 Units.\n\nSitting at the intersection of fine arts and filmmaking, animation has held a unique place in visual culture since its inception and has more recently become a ubiquitous presence in our society. Through a combination of workshops, screenings, and discussions, this course will examine the advantages and particularities that come with the art form as well as the diverse range of technologies and techniques that it can include. Students learn both analog and digital animation methods-including cut-out, hand-drawn, and stop motion, among others-to explore their own artistic voice through moving image, culminating with a final project in the medium of their choice. Works screened for discussion will range from the traditional and studio-based to the experimental and alternative. No previous drawing experience required.\n\nInstructor(s): Elizabeth Rogers Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CMST 35602, CMST 25602, MADD 20602\n\nARTV 20205. City Imagined, City Observed. 100 Units.\n\nThis urban design studio course takes two distinct notions of the city as its starting point: grand, imaginative plans -- utopian, unbuilt, semi-realized, real... both as aesthetic objects, and as ideas -- and how the minute flows of day-to-day life, up from the smallest scale, enter into dialogue with little built and lived details, intended or not. Drawing on both Chicago and other places (not just urban) that individual students know well, we will dream both big and small, search both present and past, and tap precisely into both what we dream and what we experience... seeking not to dictate what the city will be, but to use these different modes of understanding to expand our sense of what a city can be. Necessarily, we'll grapple with difficult contradictions cities pose, our most central personal assumptions about spaces and places, and with questions of how, especially in present-day capitalism, cities change. We take as given the inevitable gap between how places actually evolve and how, perhaps, they could, and use that gap as a site for the imagination to step in, while also confronting the hubris of imagining cities real. The studio work will proceed in three stages: individually developing an alternate vision for a place you know well, at a historical moment of your choice... then breaking each others' plans... and finally using real observations and factors (and even spontaneous impulse) to complicate and rebuild your vision into something lovelier.\n\nInstructor(s): L. Joyner Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Consent is required to enroll in this class. Priority will be given to students who have completed ARTH 24190.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARCH 24191, ARTH 24191, ENST 24191, CEGU 24191, CHST 24191, AMER 24191, GEOG 24191\n\nARTV 20206. Second Nature: New Models for the Chicago Park District. 100 Units.\n\nThe Chicago Park District seems to preserve \"first nature\" within the metropolitan field. But the motive for establishing this sovereign territory was hardly natural. Today, cultural change raises questions about the significance and operation of this immense network of civic spaces. What opportunities emerge as we rethink them? While this design studio focuses on the development of new model parks for Chicago, it can support students coming from a broad range of disciplines. Texts, seminar discussions, and field trips will complement and nourish the development of architectural proposals.\n\nInstructor(s): A. Schachman Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Consent only\n\nNote(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. Please also note that architecture studio courses comprise one 80-minute meeting and one 170-minute meeting per week.

Introduction to Performance Installation. 100 Units.\n\nThis introductory course provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the collaborative and theatrical techniques required for staging a performance installation piece. This artistic medium works at the boundaries between visual art, theater, and experiential storytelling. This medium thereby offers the ensemble a dynamic platform for creative expression. Students will create site-specific pieces while also experimenting with various physical and vocal techniques. Students interested in the course should contact Pamela Pascoe (pkpascoe@uchicago.edu) before registering.\n\nInstructor(s): P. Pascoe Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTV 30207, TAPS 22290\n\nARTV 20208. Scenography: Static and Kinetic Forms. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is an exploration of various forms and processes of designing sets and projections for theatrical performance. We pay particular attention to a cohesive reading of a text, contextual and historical exploration, and visual and thematic research, as well as the documentation needed to complete a show including storyboards, models, drafting, and paint elevations. Conversations with guest artists will illuminate personal and cultural aesthetics of an individual artist and assigned readings will expose students to major trends in modern stage design.\n\nInstructor(s): Alyssa Mohn Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 27410, TAPS 27410\n\nARTV 20209. Costuming the Shape of Heroes and Villains. 100 Units.\n\nCostume Design is an essential element in conveying a character's story. This course will explore design elements from archetypal characters, while interrogating concepts of movement, space, and structure. Explorations in the Bauhaus, film, and dance will illuminate the relationships between opposites in storytelling. Students will develop a design vocabulary, build skills in rendering and sketching, and prepare a final costume design highlighting heroes and villains.\n\nInstructor(s): N. Rohrer Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): TAPS 27520\n\nARTV 20210. Imagining Chicago's Common Buildings. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is an architectural studio based in the common residential buildings of Chicago and the city's built environment. While design projects and architectural skills will be the focus of the course, it will also incorporate readings, a small amount of writing, some social and geographical history, and several explorations around Chicago. The studio will: (1) give students interested in pursuing architecture or the study of cities experience with a studio course and some skills related to architectural thinking, (2) acquaint students intimately with Chicago's common residential buildings and built fabric, and (3) situate all this within a context of social thought about residential architecture, common buildings, housing, and the city.\n\nInstructor(s): L. Joyner Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): While this class does not require prior experience, all ARCH studio courses require consent. Starting July 31, please visit arthistory.uchicago.edu/archconsent to request instructor consent for this class or other ARCH studios. (Please do not send consent requests by email.) Please also note that this course will include several field trips around Chicago during class time; if you have any questions or concerns about that, please share them in the consent form when you complete it.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GEOG 24190, CEGU 24190, CHST 24190, AMER 24190, ARTH 24190, ARCH 24190, ENST 24190\n\nARTV 20215. Adaptation: Text and Image. 100 Units.\n\nA course concerned with the marriage of image and text that explores films, illuminated manuscripts, comic books/graphic novels, children's picture books and present day (perhaps local) theater productions that deal at their core with the balance and dance between story and picture. Examples of work studied would be Chris Marker's La jetée, Alice in Wonderland and its many adaptations, the comics of Winsor McCay, Seth, Chris Ware, etc, and William Blake's engraved poems and images. The theatrical collaborations between the instructors themselves (\"The Cabinet\" and \"Cape and Squiggle,\" both produced by Chicago's Redmoon Theatre) will be discussed as well.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Maher, F. Maugeri Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): TAPS 28465, MADD 14865\n\nARTV 20216. Spectacle in Miniature. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores how the grand theatrical event can be 'miniaturized'. Students will investigate forms of spectacle and contemporary puppetry, toy theater, performance installation, and designed environments, along with artists who work in intimate and miniature scale. Students will create works experimenting with how large dramatic stories can be told with detailed and intimate sets, puppets, transforming objects, mechanical contraptions, and text. Sources for narrative will include but not be limited to dream and myth.\n\nInstructor(s): F. Maugeri Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): TAPS 27080, MADD 25080\n\nARTV 20217.

Classroom hours will be spent with Theaster Gates, professor, Department of Visual Art, in addition to other UChicago faculty, discussing key principles in guiding city redevelopment in mindful and equitable ways. Students will gain field experience working with Place Lab, Gates's multidisciplinary team that documents and demonstrates urban ethical redevelopment strategies initiated through arts and culture. Working across a variety of projects, students will be exposed to programming, data collection, development, community building, strategy, and documentation. Weekly site visits will give students the opportunity to see analogous projects and meet practitioners throughout Chicago.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): PBPL 25663\n\nARTV 20665. Introduction to Critical Spatial Media: Visualizing Urban, Environmental, and Planetary Change. 100 Units.\n\nThis course introduces critical theories and techniques for visualizing interconnected transformations of urban, environmental, and planetary systems amidst the pressures of climate change, urbanization, and global economies of capitalism. Weekly lectures will introduce major themes and theoretical debates, paired with hands-on lab tutorials exploring a selection of methods in conventional and experimental geographic visualization. Thematically, the course will be organized around critical interpretations of the Anthropocene, a concept designating the epoch in which anthropogenic activities are recognized as the dominant force of planetary climatic and ecological change. We will present these interpretations through modules structured around different conceptual paradigms and alternative epochal designations (e.g. the Urbanocene, the Capitalocene, the Plantationocene). Through weekly lab exercises and a final, synthetic project, the course will move from critically analyzing prevalent theoretical frameworks, geospatial data, and associated visualization techniques to creatively visualizing critical alternatives. Students will learn how to construct visual narratives through a variety of spatial media (e.g. maps, diagrams, visual timelines), scales (e.g. bodies, neighborhoods, landscapes, the planetary), and techniques/platforms (e.g. GIS, web mapping, basic programming language tools, and vector/raster visualization programs).\n\nInstructor(s): Alexander Arroyo, Grga Basic, Sol Kim Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 13517, ENST 23517, ARCH 23517, CEGU 23517\n\nARTV 20667. Seeing Islam and the Politics of Visual Culture. 100 Units.\n\nFrom terrorists to \"good Muslims,\" standards in the racial, cultural, and religious representations surrounding Islam have fluctuated across U.S. media. How do we conceptualize the nature of visual perception and reception? The history of colonialism, secular modernity, gender, patriarchy, and the blurred distinctions between religion and racialization have all contributed to a milieu of visual cultures that stage visions of and arguments about Islam. Hostility towards Muslims has not abated as we venture well into the 21st century, and many remain quick to blame an amorphous media for fomenting animosity towards the \"real\" Islam. We use these terms of engagement as the start of our inquiry: what is the promise of a meaningful image? What processes of secular translation are at work in its creation and consumption? Is there room for resistance, legibility, and representation in U.S. popular culture, and what does representation buy you in this age? We will pair theoretical methods for thinking about imagery, optics, perception, and perspective alongside case studies from film, stage, comedy, streaming content, and television shows, among others. Students will critically engage and analyze these theories in the contexts from which these works emerge and meld into a mobile and diasporic U.S. context. Together, we will reflect on the moral, political, and categorical commitments vested in different forms of media against historical trends of the 20th and 21st century.\n\nInstructor(s): Samah Choudhury Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 32500, ISLM 37555, ENGL 32505, RDIN 22500, RLST 27555, CMST 22500, CMST 32500, ENGL 22505\n\nARTV 20700. Alternate Reality Games: Theory and Production. 100 Units.\n\nGames are one of the most prominent and influential media of our time. This experimental course explores the emerging genre of \"alternate reality\" or \"transmedia\" gaming. Throughout the quarter, we will approach new media theory through the history, aesthetics, and design of transmedia games. These games build on the narrative strategies of novels, the performative role-playing of theater, the branching techniques of electronic literature, the procedural qualities of video games, and the team dynamics of sports. Beyond the subject matter, students will design modules of an Alternate Reality Game in small groups. Students need not have a background in media or technology, but a wide-ranging imagination, interest in new media culture, or arts practice will make for a more exciting quarter.\n\nInstructor(s): Patrick Jagoda, Heidi Coleman Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): PQ: Third- or fourth-year standing.

Audience, Algorithms, and Ingenuity: Unexpected Encounters in Media Arts and Live Performance. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores live theatrical and digital performance, centering on surprise as a key element. We will examine performance instigators and media activists who use experimental tactics to stage, document, and amplify their work. Through studying examples, exploring theoretical underpinnings, and creating art in this mode, we will investigate how performance can surprise, provoke, and delight-without relying on traditional resources such as space, time, money, or institutional support. What makes these forms resonate? What are their cultural and social reverberations?\n\nInstructor(s): D. de Mayo, J.

Framing, Re-framing, and Un-framing Cinema. 100 Units.\n\nBy cinema, we mean the art of the moving image, which is not limited to the material support of a flexible band called film. This art reaches back to early devices to trick the eye into seeing motion and looks forward to new media and new modes of presentation. With the technological possibility of breaking images into tiny pixels and reassembling them and of viewing them in new way that this computerized image allows, we now face the most radical transformation of the moving image since the very beginnings of cinema. A collaboration between the OpenEndedGroup (Marc Downie and Paul Kaiser), artists who have created new modes of the moving image for more than decade, and film scholar Tom Gunning, this course will use this moment of new technologies to explore and expand the moving image before it becomes too rigidly determined by the powerful industrial forces now propelling it forward. This course will be intensely experimental as we see how we might use new computer algorithms to take apart and re-experience classic films of the past. By using new tools, developed for and during this class, students will make new experiences inside virtual reality environments for watching, analyzing, and recombining films and that are unlike any other. These tools will enable students, regardless of previous programming experience, to participate in this crucial technological and cultural juncture.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTV 30805, CMST 37805, CMST 27805\n\nARTV 20807. Adaptation Laboratory: Staging Berlin at Court Theatre. 100 Units.\n\nFrom 2000-2018, the graphic novelist Jason Lutes published Berlin, a sprawling, formally inventive, & idiosyncratic account of life in the German capital city during the years just prior to National Socialism. Court Theatre, the Tony award winning professional theater on the UChicago campus, has commissioned the playwright Mickle Maher to prepare an adaptation of Lutes' novel for Court's 2024-25 season; David Levin is the collaborating dramaturg. This interdisciplinary team-taught seminar invites students into the process of adaptation, exploring a range of practical, conceptual & artistic challenges. The course will take place in two locations: at Court Theatre (where we will attend rehearsals for the world premiere production, from first rehearsal through opening) and in a theater lab on campus, where we will consider a range of critical and creative materials - e.g., Lisa Kron and Jeanine Tesori's adaptation of Alison Bechdel's graphic novel Fun Home or Walter Ruttmann's 1927 film \"Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis\" - to establish a dialogue between Lutes' novel, its progenitors, and the work in Court's rehearsal room. An additional & significant component of our work will involve creative exercises. Students will prepare adaptations of their own - first, of Lutes' novel, then of works of their own choosing. Artists from Court's production will join us for workshop sessions. The seminar aims to serve as a creative and critical forum, exploring the challenges of adaptation.\n\nInstructor(s): David Levin and Mickle Maher Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): An interest in the graphic novel and/or 20th century German history & culture is welcome but not required.

Painting with Light in Space. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores projected imagery as a medium to paint ephemeral ideas in the real world through installation and theatrical design. Utilizing visual iconography, architectural forms, objects, and cinema, this course will explore the practical and theoretical applications of video on unorthodox objects and spaces. Using software as an instrument, students will investigate the visceral extents of images both historical and generative to create living light. The course will culminate in student presentations that illustrate and illuminate the ideas and techniques presented throughout the course.\n\nInstructor(s): R.

Through research, material investigation, experimentation and revision, students will develop their own approach to a daily self-directed practice. Projects will include weekly and longer-term assignments, individual and collaborative work. We will also look at the practices of established artists for possible models. Participation in several field trips is required.\n\nInstructor(s): B. Collins Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): ARTV 10100, 10200 or 10300\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTV 31800\n\nARTV 21802. Around the Plausibility of Context. 100 Units.\n\nThis interdisciplinary and conversation-oriented studio seminar investigates the construction of context before/after the making of an artwork. Discussions, initially held among class members and subsequently expanded to involve external scholars, will pivot around the following questions: 0. Do and should artists consider the placement of their work? 1. How can artists examine and challenge their perceived biography? 2. What are the functions of a collection/gallery/museum? 3. How can artists inaugurate supportive and meaningful infrastructures around their practice and activate them as crucial toolsets for engagement and interpretation? 4. Where and how, ultimately, can context appear most plausible? Routine visits to study rooms and archives on- and off-campus will supplement class discussions, and students should be prepared to use public transport and carpool. The final project of this class, as it stands now, will entail the design of an imaginary collection/gallery/museum with concomitant programming according to each artist's interests and points of view.\n\nInstructor(s): T.

Untidy Objects. 100 Units.\n\nIn this experimental course, students will use the lens of \"untidy objects\" to unravel the relationship between self and other, self and world. The concepts we normally use to think tend to take for granted, on the one hand, tidy objects, and on the other hand, tidy subjects coming to know tidy objects. We will undertake to challenge distinctions between subject and object through a multi-faceted set of sculptural and horticultural practices that bring us into close contact with plants and trees.The aspirations of this project are to question the conceptual ground from which we think about environmental justice and politics with an emphasis on practices of proximity to living others. Through readings, guest speakers, discussions, and practicum, this course and project provide an opportunity to re-habituate ourselves and lean differently into the world, to perceive, conceptualize, and represent living processes in ways that are oblique to common-sense.\n\nInstructor(s): A.

Sensing the Anthropocene. 100 Units.\n\nIn this co-taught course between the departments of English (Jennifer Scappettone) and Visual Arts (Amber Ginsburg), we will deploy those senses most overlooked in academic discourse surrounding aesthetics and urbanism--hearing, taste, touch, and smell--to explore the history and actuality of Chicago as a site of anthropogenic changes. Holding the bulk of our classes out of doors, we will move through the city seeking out and documenting traces of the city's foundations in phenomena such as the filling in of swamp; the river as pipeline; and the creation of transportation and industrial infrastructure--all with uneven effects on human and nonhuman inhabitants. Coursework will combine readings in history and theory of the Anthropocene together with examples of how artists and activists have made the Anthropocene visible, tangible, and audible, providing forums for playful documentation and annotations as we draw, score, map, narrate, sing, curate and collate our sensory experience of the Anthropocene into a final experimental book project. Admission is by consent only: please write a short paragraph briefly sketching your academic background and naming your interest in the course.

The Thinking Body. 100 Units.\n\nThis studio course focuses on how the body creates art through movement, intuition and embodied knowledge. Through experimental approaches to making by hand and working with materials, we explore how the mind is distributed across the body and not limited to abstract ratiocination. Students will probe the boundaries between the arbitrary and the intentional, and the subjective and the objective through projects including 2D collage, creative writing, and 3D mixed-media. We will examine a variety of resources from rituals and ceremonies to contemporary art practices that fuse intuition and intellect and will read about sensory responses in non-human cognition (e.g. plants and animals without centralized brain).\n\nInstructor(s): N.

Art & Machine Intelligence. 100 Units.\n\nArtists have long used autonomous processes to aid in the creation of their work. From 18th century parlor games to contemporary visual culture, creators have applied stochastic methods, automation, and simulation to generate music, text, and imagery. In the last five years, as machine learning has matured into broadly applicable artificial intelligence, artists have turned towards neural networks as a new frontier for creative practice. This studio course will explore the history and uses of autonomous creative tools and focus, more specifically, on leading edge artistic applications of AI. Students will receive exposure to a breadth of methods in this domain and produce multiple projects engaged with these topics. Software development experience is not required, though it may be useful.\n\nInstructor(s): J.

Introduction to 16mm Filmmaking. 100 Units.\n\nThe goal of this intensive laboratory course is to give its students a working knowledge of film production using the 16mm gauge. The course will emphasize how students can use 16mm technology towards successful cinematography and image design (for use in both analog and digital postproduction scenarios) and how to develop their ideas towards constructing meaning through moving pictures. Through a series of group exercises, students will put their hands on equipment and solve technical and aesthetic problems, learning to operate and care for the 16mm Bolex film camera; prime lenses; Sekonic light meter; Sachtler tripod; and Arri light kit and accessories. For a final project, students will plan and produce footage for an individual or small group short film. The first half the course will be highly structured, with demonstrations, in-class shoots, and lectures. As the semester continues, class time will open up to more of a workshop format to address the specific concerns and issues that arise in the production of the final projects. This course is made possible by the Charles Roven Fund for Cinema and Media Studies. Students will need written permission to enroll in the course.

Expanded Cinema. 100 Units.\n\nThough often overlooked, the act of projection is at the heart of cinema (the act or process of causing a picture to appear on a surface). This studio course focuses on the creation of moving image-based work, exploring how time and space are used as materials to create form and inspire content within the contemporary film genre known as expanded cinema. The technical, historical and political aspects of the projected image will be studied in order to re-think cinema as a group and investigate how the projected image can find meaning outside the black box of theaters or the white cube of galleries. Two personal experimental video projects will lead to a third final collective video installation that will use the environment within the vicinity of UChicago's campus to inspire the work while also become the location of the final outdoor projection event. Note(s): Students will need written permission to enroll in the course. To bid for entry into the class, please email the instructor with your name, major, year, and list any other media production experience.

Drawing Through the World: Relational Ways of Seeing. 100 Units.\n\nThis studio drawing course proposes an examination of the relationship between drawing and seeing, knowing, and revealing connections in our experience of the world. Our departure point is the human figure. Rather than moving inward (anatomy), we move outward from the figure in to space, drawing diagrammatically through the visual field, intent on expanding our ability to make visual and conceptual connections as we sharpen our observational drawing skills. A wide range of ideas--including Klee, Piaget, and Bourriaud-will be considered alongside our efforts in class. Guest speakers, field trips, and seminar discussions augment this studio drawing course. No prior drawing experience required. Students from across disciplines/working with any art media welcome.\n\nInstructor(s): K.

On Art and Life. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is a multidisciplinary intensive into the ways in which artistic production is dependent on and part of larger cultural tropes. Utilizing contemporary culture as a framework, how does art form connective tissues with the worlds that happen outside of the artist's studio? Visual art is a communicative form that requires subject matter, and this course will investigate the myriad of ways that artists mine culturally meaningful materials, forms, and images as both subjects and as palette. Participation in several field trips and out-of-class film screenings is required. Reference materials are drawn from a variety of disciplines.\n\nInstructor(s): G. Oppenheimer Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): ARTV 10100, 10200, or 10300\n\nNote(s): Participation in several field trips and out-of-class film screenings is required.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTV 36214\n\nARTV 27200.

Practice. 100 Units.\n\nArtists, writers, and poets are often known for one or two masterpieces in their professional lives. What often goes unnoticed, however, is the many years of practice and labor that lead to making someone an expert. This studio course explores repetitive daily habits as the foundation of artistic growth. Through readings, group discussions, and a variety of studio and take-home projects, this class examines how practice relates to theory, praxis, habit, identity, and the experience of time; we will also use practice to problematize notions of in-born talent and the primacy of the final \"product.\" Students will engage with the notion of practice intellectually and perform daily rituals throughout the quarter as they cultivate their personalized and individual creative praxis.\n\nInstructor(s): N. Lotfi Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): ARTV 10100, 10200, or 10300\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTV 37206\n\nARTV 27314. Writing Art Criticism. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is a practicum in writing art criticism. Unlike art historians, art critics primarily respond to the art of their time and to developments in the contemporary art world. They write reviews of Chicago exhibitions that may be on view in galleries or museums and that may focus on single artists or broad themes. Importantly, art critics often produce the very first discourse on a given art, shaping subsequent thinking and historiography. Accordingly, art criticism is a genre that requires particular skills, for example, identifying why and how artworks matter, taking a fresh look at something familiar or developing a set of ideas even if unfamiliar with a subject, expressing strong yet sound opinions, and writing in impeccable and engaging ways. Students will develop these skills by reading and writing art criticism. We will examine the work of modern art critics ranging from Denis Diderot to Peter Schjeldahl and of artists active as critics ranging from Donald Judd to Barbara Kruger. Class discussions will be as much about the craft of writing as about the art reviewed. We will deliberate the style and rhetoric of exhibition reviews, including details such as first and last sentences, order of paragraphs, word choices, and the like. This seminar is writing intensive with a total of six exhibition reviews, four of which will be rewritten substantially based on instructor, visitor, and peer feedback and general class discussion. Off-campus field trips also required.\n\nInstructor(s): C. Mehring Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Enrollment is limited and permission of instructor is required. Preference will be given to students with a background in the visual arts or writing about the arts. Please email the instructor (mehring@uchicago.edu) explaining relevant background.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTV 37314, ARTH 27314, ARTH 37314\n\nARTV 27700.
