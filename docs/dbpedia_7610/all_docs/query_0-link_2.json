        "text": "You like experimenting with Super 8mm and recently made a short film. What about this specific medium attracts you?\n\nMy dad taught me how to shoot on Super 8 when I was younger and I’ve been into it ever since. I just love the way it looks. Shooting on film has given me a really great understanding of light and color and I would love to shoot on larger format if I get a chance. WHITE LIE is a film I made in Rebecca Haimowitz’s \"Reality and Creation\" course last semester. It gave me a chance to play around with footage I had already shot. I got to score it as well which was super fun.\n\nYou also make music and often use your voice in your music. What is your approach when starting a musical piece?\n\nIf I'm ever stuck, I like to do is take a recording of something around me and use that ambient sound to layer in more musical elements. I’ll record the birds outside or rain or people talking and use that as a starting point. I love singing and it just feels like a really interesting tool to use. There are a lot of ways you can sample and chop up the human voice to create all kinds of sounds.\n\nWhat are you working on now?\n\nI’m currently producing a short film that two of my friends are writing/directing (producing is a first for me!). I’m also working on a score for a dance film that another Collaborative Arts student is producing. Making music for other people is super intimidating for me but I also love being able to work with other Collaborative Arts students.\n\nLast semester I started a bi-weekly podcast for WNYU called The Good, The Bad, and The Similar with two of my friends. We watch three films for every episode to compare and discuss. I edit the podcast and post it do different social media platforms. We started it just for fun and while we don’t have a ton of listeners, stats on Spotify tell me people have listened in Sweden, Estonia, and Brazil which is awesome!\n\nWhat made you choose Collaborative Arts as your major, instead of a specific discipline like acting, film, or writing?\n\nI am interested in so many things it was hard to narrow it down. I think initially I was worried that Collaborative Arts may not give me as much structure or discipline as a film or acting major, but I’ve discovered that Collaborative Arts is really what you make of it. I’ve developed so many new interests that I may not have been able to explore in another program. Collaborative Arts connects you to so many different areas and students in other majors at NYU, so I seriously can’t imagine being anywhere else. I don’t think anything like this program exists in any other place."
