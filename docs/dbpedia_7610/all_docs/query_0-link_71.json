        "text": "Overview\n\nBurns and scalds are damage to the skin usually caused by heat. Both are treated in the same way.\n\nA burn is caused by dry heat – by an iron or fire, for example. A scald is caused by something wet, such as hot water or steam.\n\nBurns can be very painful and may cause:\n\nred or peeling skin\n\nblisters\n\nswelling\n\nwhite or charred skin\n\nThe amount of pain you feel is not always related to how serious the burn is. Even a very serious burn may be relatively painless.\n\nTreating burns and scalds\n\nTo treat a burn, follow the first aid advice below:\n\nimmediately get the person away from the heat source to stop the burning\n\nremove any clothing or jewellery that's near the burnt area of skin, including babies' nappies, but do not move anything that's stuck to the skin\n\ncool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 to 30 minutes – do not use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances like butter\n\nmake sure the person keeps warm by using a blanket, for example, but take care not to rub it against the burnt area\n\nafter cooling the burn, cover the burn by placing a layer of cling film over it – a clean plastic bag could also be used for burns on your hand\n\nuse painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat any pain\n\nraise the affected area if possible – this helps to reduce swelling\n\nif it's an acid or chemical burn, dial 999, carefully try to remove the chemical and any contaminated clothing, and rinse the affected area using as much clean water as possible\n\nRead more about treating burns and scalds.\n\nWhen to get medical attention\n\nDepending on how serious a burn is, it may be possible to treat it at home.\n\nFor minor burns, keep the burn clean and do not burst any blisters that form.\n\nMore serious burns require professional medical attention.\n\nYou should go to a hospital A&E department for:\n\nall chemical and electrical burns\n\nlarge or deep burns – any burn bigger than the injured person's hand\n\nburns that cause white or charred skin – any size\n\nburns on the face, neck, hands, feet, any joints or genitals\n\nIf someone has breathed in smoke or fumes, they should also get medical attention.\n\nSome symptoms may be delayed and can include:\n\ncoughing\n\na sore throat\n\ndifficulty breathing\n\nfacial burns\n\nPeople at greater risk from the effects of burns, such as children under 10 years old, should also get medical attention after a burn or scald.\n\nThe size and depth of the burn will be assessed, and the affected area cleaned before a dressing is applied. In severe cases, skin graft surgery may be recommended.\n\nRead more about:\n\nrecovering from burns and scalds\n\ncomplications of burns and scalds\n\nTypes of burn\n\nBurns are assessed by how seriously your skin is damaged and which layers of skin are affected.\n\nYour skin has 3 layers:\n\nthe epidermis – the outer layer of skin\n\nthe dermis – the layer of tissue just beneath, which contains blood capillaries, nerve endings, sweat glands and hair follicles\n\nthe subcutaneous fat, or subcutis – the deeper layer of fat and tissue\n\nThere are 4 main types of burn, which tend to have a different appearance and different symptoms:\n\nsuperficial epidermal burn – where the epidermis is damaged; your skin will be red, slightly swollen and painful, but not blistered\n\nsuperficial dermal burn – where the epidermis and part of the dermis are damaged; your skin will be pale pink and painful, and there may be small blisters\n\ndeep dermal or partial thickness burn – where the epidermis and the dermis are damaged; this type of burn makes your skin turn red and blotchy; your skin may be dry or moist and become swollen and blistered, and it may be very painful or painless\n\nfull thickness burn – where all 3 layers of skin (the epidermis, dermis and subcutis) are damaged; the skin is often burnt away and the tissue underneath may appear pale or blackened, while the remaining skin will be dry and white, brown or black with no blisters. The texture of the skin may also be leathery or waxy. It may also be painless\n\nPreventing burns and scalds\n\nMany severe burns and scalds affect babies and young children.\n\nExamples of things you can do to help reduce the likelihood of your child having a serious accident at home include:\n\nkeeping your child out of the kitchen whenever possible\n\ntesting the temperature of bath water using your elbow before you put your baby or toddler in the bath\n\nkeeping matches, lighters and lit candles out of young children's sight and reach\n\nkeeping hot drinks well away from young children\n\nRead more about preventing burns and scalds.\n\nFurther advice\n\nIf you need advice about a burn or scald, you can:\n\ncall 111 or get help from 111 online\n\nspeak to a GP"
