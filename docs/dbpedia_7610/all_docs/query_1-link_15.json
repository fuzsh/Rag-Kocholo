        "text": "Triadic color scheme meaning\n\nTriadic color scheme definition\n\nWe’ll get started by providing a triadic color scheme definition, then we’ll take a look at how triadic color palettes can be used in filmmaking and examine a few examples of triadic color schemes.\n\nTo learn more about the different types of color schemes at your disposal as a filmmaker, be sure to read our articles on monochromatic, complementary, and analogous color schemes as well.\n\nTRIADIC COLORs DEFINITION\n\nWhat is a triadic color scheme?\n\nAll triadic color examples consist of three colors that are evenly spaced out on the traditional color wheel. Black and/or white may also be present within a triadic harmony. A traditionally-balanced triadic color scheme focuses on one dominant color, with the other two evenly spaced colors both serving as accents. Triadic colors stand out from one another and make for a vibrant, lively color palette regardless of which particular colors are used. Triadic color harmony refers to the pleasing appearance that triadic colors have when used together.\n\nWhat are triadic colors?\n\nComprised of three evenly-spaced colors\n\nVibrant and distinctive\n\nOne dominant color, plus two accent colors\n\nTriadic color scheme meaning\n\nHow to use a triadic color scheme\n\nWhen it comes to designing a triadic color scheme for your own artistic projects, the most important aspect to keep in mind is balance. A balanced triadic color scheme centers around one dominant color and features the other two colors as accompanying accents.\n\nWhile you could use all three colors to the same degree in a triadic color scheme, the results are far more likely to class and appear visually messy.\n\nChoosing your dominant color is the most important decision, as the other two colors are dependent on the dominant color. For example, if you were to choose red as your dominant color, then your two accent colors must be yellow and blue when devising a triadic color palette. Take a look at the chart below to see the different triadic color combinations visualized.\n\nWhat is a triadic color scheme?\n\nColor has a profound psychological effect on the viewer. Understanding the psychology of color is crucial when designing the color scheme of a film.\n\nTriadic colors examples\n\nThe psychology of color\n\nThe psychology of color can hold significant influence over a viewer’s response to an image. Certain colors can evoke particular subconscious reactions when utilized properly. To understand this subconscious relationship and learn how to make the best use of these psychological effects in storytelling, we need an understanding of color theory. Let’s examine how a filmmaker like Stanley Kubrick uses color.\n\nThe colors of Stanley Kubrick • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nWhen utilizing colors for their psychological effects, a filmmaker can determine their own color associations as established within the film, or they can rely on the pre-established associations for particular colors. Whether you realize it or not, certain colors evoke certain psychological responses in the human brain at a subconscious level.\n\nThese pre-determined associations have been reinforced throughout generations of storytelling for both the subconscious associations and for the thematic relevance. Refer to the helpful chart below for some of the most common responses associated with particular colors.\n\nThe psychology of color visualized\n\nTriadic color schemes are bold, vibrant, and without a doubt eye-catching. Using triadic colors can be a great way to accompany playfulness, underscore discordance, or magnify dissimilarities.\n\nThe limits of color in storytelling are boundless. While it is true that there are plenty of films that disregard color as a creative choice, either not bothering with this facet of storytelling or opting instead for a color scheme that purely represents our real-world and nothing more, there are also countless examples of excellent films which make color a key element of their overall style and meaning. This tribute to color in storytelling showcases the power of meaningful color scheme choices.\n\nCinema Cartography examines color in storytelling\n\nIt’s not just color grading that goes into a film’s color scheme but also the production design and other creative elements. Be sure to pay color the attention it deserves when making your own movies.\n\nOur script breakdown software is a great tool for identifying all of the production design elements in a screenplay that can be geared toward a meaningful color scheme. You can get started for free today.\n\nWhat is an example of a triadic color scheme\n\nTriadic color scheme examples\n\nNow that we know what triadic colors are, let’s take a look at a few examples of triadic color palettes in films.\n\nPierrot Le Fou is an important film in the French New Movie cinematic movement known for rule breaking and wild experimentation. The film makes use of a red, yellow, and blue triadic color scheme. In this instance, the triadic colors perfectly fit with the film’s chaotic, constantly shifting narrative.\n\nThe discordance amongst the colors matches up with the discordance of the plot as it jumps between different genres and styles from scene to scene.\n\nTriadic color scheme examples • Pierrot le Fou\n\nTo see these same three colors utilized in a different way, we look to Wes Anderson. In his films, Anderson's color palettes have experimented with and perfected just about every color scheme possible throughout his filmography. In his very first feature film, Bottle Rocket, Anderson made use of a triadic color scheme. These bold, saturated colors pop right off the screen.\n\nTriadic color scheme examples • Bottle Rocket\n\nBut the triadic color palette is far from being the only one Wes Anderson has utilized throughout his career. Wes Anderson is a master of movie color palettes. He has experimented with and perfect just about every color scheme possible throughout his filmography. For an overview of his mastery of color, check out our video essay below.\n\nTriadic color harmony and other color schemes by Wes Anderson • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nAng Lee’s take on the Incredible Hulk made use of a different triadic color combination. The green of the Hulk’s skin, the purple of his pants, and the orange of the desert rock make up a triadic harmony that blends real life colors with comic book visuals.\n\nTriadic colors examples"
