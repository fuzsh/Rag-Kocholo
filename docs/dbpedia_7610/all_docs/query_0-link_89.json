Harrington, 22, was arrested Tuesday, Aug. 6 after an investigation into a burglary report originating in Butternuts.\n\nAccording to the release, the investigation revealed that Harrington stole a Can-Am four-wheeler along with several cans of gas from a barn. He was observed loading the four-wheeler into the bed of a white Dodge pick-up truck that investigators were familiar with as having been used by Harrington to commit similar crimes in Chenango County.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harrington was found in the village of Morris and taken into custody on charges from Butternuts, as well as three active warrants originating from Chenango County. A search warrant was executed at a residence in Morris, where previously reported stolen items were also located. Additionally, the white Dodge pick-up truck used by Harrington was located at the residence and was found to be stolen from another county, the release stated.\n\nHarrington was charged in Butternuts with third-degree burglary, third-degree grand larceny, second-degree criminal possession of stolen property and third-degree criminal possession of stolen property.\n\nIn Morris, he was charged with second-degree criminal possession of stolen property, third-degree criminal possession of stolen property and fourth-degree criminal possession of stolen property.\n\nHarrington was processed at the Otsego County Sheriff's Office and, following an appearance in centralized arraignment, was lodged in the Otsego County Correctional Facility on a bail recommendation from the Otsego County District Attorney's Office of $10,000 cash, $10,000 credit card or $100,000 surety bond."
