CREATIVE TIME presentsPlaying the Building: An Installation by David Byrne at The Battery Maritime Building in downtown Manhattan. The building is open Friday, Saturday, and Sundays from noon to 4pm and closes on August 24.\n\nFormer Talking Head Byrne has converted this landmark building into a mammoth musical instrument. Every part of the Maritime’s infrastructure–pillars, pipes, and beams–are hooked electronically to an organ that, when played, triggers vibrations and oscillations that resonate sound. Visitors are invited to play their own tunes (Chopsticks is a favorite)."
