        "text": "The Associate in Applied Science (AAS) program teaches the basics of filmmaking and related disciplines, including digital film camera operation, editing, lighting, audio recording, film history, and storytelling. On completing the AAS degree, you will be able to demonstrate effective use of camera position, framing, and selection of lenses in a wide range of filming situations; employ appropriate editing strategies (e.g., montage, continuity, etc.) in a variety of film projects; create lighting strategies appropriate to the cinematography and subject matter in short films; record, mix, and edit sound for film, including dialogue, sound effects, and music; and write, produce, shoot, and edit short films. The first year concentrates on building skills in preproduction, production, and visual organization. In your second year, you will learn to use these skills in developing your own personal vision.\n\nFilm and Media AAS students are encouraged to apply for the Stanley Solomon Award, which provides support for student films.\n\nAnd once you earn your AAS, you’ll be ready to apply for a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Film and Media.\n\nThe Bachelor of Science (BS) program blends hands-on digital filmmaking with the academic study of film history, theory, and criticism. You’ll study advanced storytelling techniques through cinematography and lighting, along with advanced sound design, while exploring film genres like crime, horror, and romantic comedy; major directors; avant-garde film; and world cinema from China, Italy, Latin America, and Russia. You will learn to compare filmmakers, film aesthetics, and film industries in domestic and international cinema, as well as evaluate and analyze historical and theoretical perspectives relevant to film and media, such as genre, form, spectatorship, and narrative.\n\nYou will learn about techniques for effective narrative, documentary, and experimental filmmaking. Your thesis film project will be screened at FIT’s annual film festival, which is open to the public and invited guests from the New York City film community.\n\nFilm and Media BS students are encouraged to apply for the Women's Media Group Scholarship Award.\n\nIf you have an AAS in Film and Media from FIT, you may apply. Learn more about eligibility for the BS program."
