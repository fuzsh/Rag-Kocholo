        "text": "Photography at Pratt\n\nThe Photography curriculum provides an extensive photographic education through a series of core classes that promote students’ technical and conceptual development.\n\nStudents are expected to establish their photographic practices through the study of analog and digital processes within a deeper understanding of the histories and theories of the medium. Given the central role that images play in our lives, demonstrating literacy in photography has taken on new meaning, new urgency, and new forms.\n\nStudent Work\n\nLook at these bodies of work that our current Photography students are producing. Through concentrated learning about photographic processes, critical discourse, and exposure to contemporary art, you’ll develop your own visual language and artistic voice.\n\nThe Experience\n\nOur photographic production spaces are at the core of your educational experience at Pratt. The digital labs, analog darkrooms, and lighting studio are creative environments that foster community and function as an extension of the classroom. The atmosphere and culture of these spaces are centralized around promoting skill-building, creativity, and the exploration of materials and processes. Students are encouraged to expand upon what they learn in class, experiment with both concept and form, and question the boundaries of the photographic medium.\n\nLabs and Facilities\n\nAt Pratt, our labs and facilities are capable of supporting a wide range of photographic practices. Our darkrooms can accommodate negative formats ranging from 35mm to 4×5 sheet film. They also provide areas for print finishing. Our digital labs feature state-of-the-art Apple computers, Epson printers, film digitization stations, and a Risograph Digital Duplicator for independent book publications. In the department’s lighting studio, Profoto and Lowell lighting equipment, stands, dollies and seamless backdrops make learning about studio shoots an important part of the professional experience.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Pratt Photography Facilities Page.\n\nInternships\n\nStudents have the opportunity to explore different sectors of the field through their choice of internships at various art institutions, galleries, and studios such as the Whitney Museum of Art, Conveyor Arts, Distributed Art Publishers (D.A.P.), David LaChapelle Studio, and Diverse Works to name a few. An internship provides students with real-world work experience. During their course of study, students have the option to complete an internship for program credit. A Pratt faculty advisor guides each student until their learning objectives are met.\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nImmersing yourself in another culture is an incredible experience that can extend the boundaries of creativity. Study abroad programs are an integral part of the college experience, and Pratt has deep connections with university partners around the world. In addition to partnering with universities abroad, Pratt Photography has abroad opportunities as part of Pratt Berlin, a semester-long program where students will take Pratt course offerings with Pratt faculty while living in Berlin, Germany. Similarly, the Photography Department has elective courses with short-term travel components embedded into the curriculum, which include opportunities to travel and study during spring break in Havana, Cuba, or San Juan, Puerto Rico.
