        "text": "Brian Mack\n\nFootball 8/7/2024 1:55:00 PM\n\nWise Hopes to Lead RedHawks to Repeat\n\nSwingRX Golf Performance is proud to bring you this week's Front Row Feature.\n\nFor more information, visit https://SwingRXGolf.com.\n\n- - -\n\nDecember 2, 2023 at Ford Field ranks among the greatest moments and memories of Ty Wise's football career to date.\n\nThe linebacker from Carmel, Ind. made eight tackles in the Mid-American Conference title game as the Miami RedHawks took down No. 23 Toledo 23-14 to claim the program's 17th all-time MAC championship.\n\n\"Starting the year off like we did against the Miami Hurricanes, I don't think anybody thought that we were going to finish the season like that,\" Wise said. \"Just to rally the guys together and accomplish something that big is remarkable.\"\n\nBut Wise isn't satisfied with the championship ring he won in 2023.\n\nHe wants another one.\n\nAs fall camp kicked off this month, Wise's focus has been squarely on doing whatever it takes to help the Red and White go back-to-back in the MAC.\n\n\"The chance to repeat: I know in college football you rarely ever see that,\" Wise explained. \"Teams who have a lot of success often get complacent and don't really have the same level of intensity and ability to play as hard as they did last year.\n\n\"I think we have a great, mature group of guys that really isn't satisfied with what we did last year.\"\n\nWise is no stranger to championships and what it takes to win. A product of Carmel (Ind). High School, he helped the Greyhounds capture the 2019 6A state title his senior year.\n\n\"Any time you play for a successful high school program, the expectation is to win every single game, and I think that's something I bring to the table,\" said Wise. \"I'm never okay with a bad performance. I'm never okay with not playing to my best. I hold all my teammates accountable, and a lot of the leaders on our defense –and our team as a whole— do that.\"\n\nWise, who graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Sport Leadership and Management last December, finally had the chance to show what he could do in a full season at the college level in 2023. After beginning his career in a reserve role with the Indiana Hoosiers and then seeing his 2022 campaign at Miami cut short due to injury, Wise started all 14 games last fall, earning Second-Team All-MAC honors. He finished his junior season with 122 tackles, nine tackles for loss and eight sacks (including three sacks in a single game against Akron).\n\n\"It's all about the right fit,\" said Wise. \"I knew the coaches here could develop me, and I really trusted them…\n\n\"I appreciate them putting me in positions, giving me different responsibilities, drawing up plays where I'm able to make an impact and putting me in different spots where I can affect the game.\"\n\nWise has tried to model his game after NFL linebacker Micah Parsons, and he believes that demonstrating similar versatility to play in multiple positions depending on what the team needs in a certain situation –including lining up as a pass-rusher on third-and-long— is one of his greatest strengths.\n\n\"Watching [Parsons'] film, if and when I can make it to the next level, being available to play outside linebacker, defensive end, inside linebacker, hammer over the ball on third down, or anywhere they need me to would definitely help me make a 53-man roster,\" said Wise. \"That's really the top aspect of his game I appreciate.\"\n\n\"Ty is the combination of what you're looking for,\" said Miami head coach Chuck Martin. \"He has length, he's super-strong and he can really run. He's just so genetically gifted.\n\n\"And if you spend five minutes or five days with Ty Wise, you immediately realize this is an amazingly quality, good human being. Good people have success…\n\n\"If you take crazy good genetics, really high character, and really good work ethic, you've got a high-end NFL prospect.\"\n\nStill, while Wise would love to play pro football after his college career ends, he couldn't imagine not returning to the RedHawks for one more season in 2024, embracing the chance to defend Miami's crown. The RedHawks will attempt to become the first team to repeat as MAC champion since Northern Illinois in 2012 and could capture Miami's first back-to-back titles since the Red and White won three straight a half-century ago (1973-1975).\n\n\"There wasn't really even a thought [of not] coming back for my fifth year,\" said Wise. \"I knew I was going to do it, because there's stuff I still wanted to accomplish with this group of guys.\n\n\"I knew that we had a great group coming back, so it was a pretty easy decision for me.\"\n\nWise and Matt Salopek both ranked among the top 20 in tackles in the nation last year, and the two veteran linebackers' skill sets complement each other well in the middle of Miami's always-stingy defense.\n\n\"We've got a lot of experience on the back end with me and Ty,\" said Salopek. \"Ty's a phenomenal player: Able to play in the box and also rush the passer.\"\n\n\"I think we're both rare in that he came in as a safety and I played defensive line my first year,\" Wise added. \"With both of us transitioning, I think we're both becoming dominant linebackers. Especially now, coming back, I think we're only going to be better.\n\n\"I'm able to educate him on some pass rush stuff…he's able to help me understand the stuff safeties and nickels see and other ways that I can impact the game.\n\n\"With us both coming back and playing with each other, we're becoming more complete players. And that's a very scary thing!\"\n\nAfter the RedHawks posted multiple shutouts in conference play last year and ranked as the league's best scoring defense since 2000, Martin is thrilled to have so much experience returning to the lineup in 2024.\n\n\"Our relationships with our guys are huge,\" Martin said. \"The trust they have in us, the trust they have in [defensive coordinator] Coach Brechin, that they'll continue to get developed here and have a chance to play on Sundays.\n\n\"That, and the feeling they have for Miami and the school…the kids really enjoy it here. We're fortunate that we have those types of relationships, and [guys want to stay]. Obviously success on the field helps too, with coming off a great year.\"\n\nTo have another special season after finishing 11-3 a season ago, Miami needs to get off to a solid start against a daunting schedule, with Power Five opponents Northwestern, Cincinnati and No. 7 Notre Dame among the non-conference opponents before MAC play begins with a Oct. 5 rematch against Toledo.\n\n\"Our first five games are very, very hard,\" Wise admitted. \"People think that we're the underdogs in those games, but I believe that we have a great chance to win each and every one of them.\"\n\nAnd no matter how non-conference play unfolds, once the calendar turns to October, the RedHawks will zero in on the goal Wise has been focused on since arriving back in Oxford with the 2023 MAC trophy in tow eight months ago:\n\nGetting back to Detroit and winning another one.\n\n\"Just seeing what it meant to the fans, it seemed like everybody came out: Everybody was showing love online and in person,\" Wise remembered.\n\n\"It really meant a lot. We've definitely got to repeat and get that feeling again.\"\n\nFind more Front Row Features at MiamiRedHawks.com/FrontRowFeatures\n\nPurchase your tickets today to see Ty Wise and the Miami RedHawks in all six home games at Yager Stadium this fall, beginning with the home opener Sept. 14 against Cincinnati as the longtime rivals battle for the Victory Bell.
