        "text": "By Benro Ogunyipe, Former NBDA President 2011-2013\n\nA Short Commentary on the History, Culture, and Education of Black Deaf People\n\nThe Black Deaf Community: Recent Stories, Accomplishments, and Recognition\n\nBlack ASL Content in Social Media\n\nBlack Deaf Community and Black Lives Matter\n\nNational Black Deaf Advocates\n\nThis article was written for the Described and Captioned Media Program (DCMP) Learning Center of accessibility information. DCMP also provides numerous Black History video resources to qualified teachers and parents, along with thousands of other educational accessible videos.\n\nBlack Deaf people have one of the most unique cultures in the world. The Black Deaf Community is largely shaped by two cultures and communities: Deaf and African-American. Some Black Deaf individuals view themselves as members of both communities. Since both communities are viewed by the larger, predominately hearing and White society as comprising a minority community, Black Deaf persons often experience double prejudice against them in terms of racial discrimination and communication barriers. Black Deaf women may experience three strikes of prejudice against them due to their race, Deafness, and sexist practices that prevail in our male dominated culture.\n\nThese discriminatory practices can be traced back to the segregation era during the 17th to mid 20th centuries. Black Deaf individuals were not accepted in either the Deaf or the African-American community. Black organizations like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and the National Urban League were focused exclusively on fighting for equality and equal rights for the African-American community. The concerns of the Black Deaf community were not the focus of national civil rights organizations such as NAACP, SCLC, and the National Urban League. The Black Deaf community had no communication access with these national civil rights organizations and their leaders.\n\nThe ideal fight for equal access would point to joining with Deaf organizations. Unfortunately, Black Deaf people were prohibited from joining Deaf organizations and clubs. The premier national advocacy organization for the rights of deaf people, the National Association of the Deaf (NAD), prohibited Black membership for 40 years until 1965, a year after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. From its founding in 1864 until 1950, Gallaudet College (now Gallaudet University), did not admit and graduate Black Deaf students. The college had its first Black graduate, Andrew J. Foster, in 1954 – the same year of the landmark Supreme Court case Brown vs. Board of Education decision.\n\nFrom the 1870s until the 1970s, at least 15 states, mostly in the south, maintained separate schools for Black and White deaf students. Integration of Black and White students did not occur until after the Brown vs. Board of Education decision. In 2011, former Black Deaf students of the Kentucky School for the Deaf received long overdue diplomas once denied to them 60 years earlier because of the color of their skin. Because Black deaf students were prohibited from opportunities to interact with students and teachers on the White Deaf school campuses, this separation contributed to the development of Black ASL, a variety of American Sign Language that's distinctively different from those of white deaf students' signs.\n\nAccording to Solomon (2018), \"The Deaf club is essentially a Deaf person's second home, providing a place where the Deaf can come together, exchange ideas, develop friendships, participate in social events, and have the opportunity to attain a leadership position within the Deaf community. After World War II Black Deaf [people] found themselves in need of a place to meet so they began to form their own clubs, congregations, and organizations.\" Because of the denied acceptance and membership in Deaf organizations and clubs that were exclusively for white Deaf persons, Black Deaf organizations arose during the 1950s and 1960s in the urban cities with large numbers of Black Deaf residents such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC. At the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) Convention held in Cincinnati, OH in 1980, a group of Black Deaf leaders presented a list of concerns to the convention delegates. These included issues such as the NAD's lack of attentiveness to the concerns of Black Deaf Americans as well as the lack of representation of Black Deaf individuals as convention delegates. They specifically requested NAD to take action to communicate better with the Black Deaf community, encourage the involvement of minorities within the national and state organizations, and recruit more Black Deaf children in the Junior NAD and NAD Youth Leadership Camp, all of which hindered Black Deaf people's goal of achieving their full potential.\n\nThe course of history for the Black Deaf community began to take on a new direction in 1981 when a local committee in Washington, DC organized the Eastern Regional Black Deaf Conference at Howard University, and in 1982 at a national conference entitled \"Black Deaf Strength through Awareness\" held in Cleveland, Ohio. An important outcome of the conference was the establishment of a new organization, National Black Deaf Advocates (NBDA). The establishment of NBDA has spurred the growth of local chapters in Washington, DC, Cleveland, Philadelphia, New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Memphis, Atlanta, and many other cities. Currently, the NBDA has over 30 local chapters and sponsors a variety of programs such as leadership training programs for high school and college students, a Miss Black Deaf America Pageant, leadership opportunities at the local and national levels, workshops at regional and national conferences, and a scholarship program for deserving Black Deaf college students.\n\nBibliography:\n\nMcCaskill, Carolyn.

In the public sector, Earnest Covington III became the Executive Director of the Rhode Island Commission on the Deaf and Hard of Hearing; Benro Ogunyipe as the Executive Director of the Illinois Deaf and Hard of Hearing Commission; and most recently, Dr. Opeoluwa Sotonwa as the Commissioner for the Massachusetts Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. In education, Ernest E. Garrett III became the Superintendent of the Louisiana Special School District (SSD); Shanae Rouse as the Director of High School at the Alabama School for the Deaf; and Alesia Allen as Assistant Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion at Rochester Institute of Technology's National Technical Institute for the Deaf. In the corporate sector, Storm Smith is the Producer of BBDO Worldwide; Claudia Gordon, Director of Government and Compliance at T-Mobile; Justin Folk, Vice President Finance of Folk Williams Financial Management, Inc.; Corey Burton, Director of ZVRS & Purple Communication’s Enterprise Video Solutions Account Management; and Isidore Niyongabo, Director of Human Resources at Convo.\n\nNew Additions of Black Deaf Individuals With Doctorate Degrees\n\nDr. David James and Dr. Glenn B. Anderson were the first Black Deaf persons to earn a doctorate in 1977 and 1982, respectively. Dr. Shirley Allen became the first Black Deaf woman to earn a doctorate in 1992. Today, there are now approximately 20 known Black Deaf scholars. Most notably, the new additions to the ranks are: Dr. Opeoluwa Sotonwa, Dr. Alesia Allen, Dr. Onudeah Nicolarakis, and Dr. Rezenet Moges-Riedel. Dr. Jenelle Rouse made history as the first known Black Deaf Canadian with a doctorate degree. Prospects for the future look promising with several Black Deaf candidates currently pursuing their doctoral degrees.\n\nBlack ASL in News Media and a Documentary\n\nBlack American Sign Language (BASL) has gained more attention in the news media in the past few years. Major newspapers have featured Black ASL, including Washington Post, New York Times, and Los Angeles Times. Led by Dr. Carolyn McCaskill and Dr. Joseph Hill, authors of The Hidden Treasure of Black ASL: Its History and Structure (2011), Black ASL made its way into the television media and had its first documentary. The Signing Black in America documentary was screened in 2020 and aired on PBS stations in select cities, highlighting the history and development of Black ASL. Black ASL content crossed the border into Canadian TV and inspired Black Deaf Canadians to advocate for further research of BASL in the Canadian Black Deaf community.\n\nThe Fight for Integration of Black Deaf Education\n\nA group of Black Deaf people campaigned to raise awareness about honoring the legacy of a Black mother, Louise B. Miller, who successfully sued the D.C. Board of Education in 1952 to have her child and Black Deaf students educated within the district. This U.S. District Court order led to the establishment of Kendall School Division II School for Negroes, a school which was segregated from the main Kendall school. The case was a precursor to the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Brown vs. Board of Education, which outlawed school segregation. The plaque commemorating Kendall School Division II School for Negroes is posted less visibly on the Gallaudet campus. Gallaudet is committed to the task of creating a memorial honoring Louise B. Miller, the 23 Black Deaf students, and four teachers of the Division II School. The story of the fight was documented in the film Class of '52, and the video can be viewed at DCMP.\n\nThe Story of the Last Segregated School for the Deaf\n\nIn 1978, Louisiana was the last segregated state school for the Deaf to become integrated in the United States. Sorenson Communications seized the opportunity to celebrate and honor four graduates of the Southern School for the Deaf (SSD) in Baton Rouge. Formerly known as Louisiana State School for the Colored Deaf and Blind (also Southern State School for the Negro Deaf), it was housed on the campus of Southern University, a member of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). The Black Deaf alumni of SSD shared the stories of their time at the school, their use of Black ASL in the classroom, and the Black Deaf experience in a five-minute short film, Black Deaf History – Southern School for the Deaf.\n\nBlack Deaf Center: The New Centralized Black Deaf Resources\n\nIn June 2020, a Black Deaf collaboration team led by the founder Tar Gilliam launched the Black Deaf Center website as a one-stop place for housing and sharing community resources regarding the Black Deaf experience. The BDC website includes documentaries and vlogs highlighting Black Deaf experience, educational books for all ages, a list of Black Deaf persons providing presentations and workshops, Black Deaf-owned businesses, connection with Black Deaf Youth, and more.\n\nCenter for Black Deaf Studies Established at Gallaudet University\n\nIn 2020, Gallaudet University established the first-of-its-kind Center for Black Deaf Studies (CBDS) as an outreach center for teaching and learning about the Black Deaf experience, and providing easy access to a range of useful content resources. Professor Dr. Carolyn McCaskill is serving as CBDS’s founding Director. One of the CBDS goals is to offer a minor focusing on the histories and cultures of African Americans with an appreciation for the historical, social, and political influences of Africa and the African diaspora.\n\nBack to Top"
