        "text": "In Final Cut Pro, click the Transitions button in the top-right corner of the timeline (or press Control-Command-5).\n\nIn the Transitions browser, select a transition.\n\nMove the pointer over the transition thumbnails to see an example of what the transition looks like. To filter the list of transition names that appear, type text in the search field.\n\nNote: If you don’t see the transition you’re looking for, you can use the Filter pop-up menu at the top of the Transitions browser to check for it in other locations. See Filter Motion content stored in a library.\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nApply the transition to an edit point: Drag the transition to the edit point.\n\nReplace an existing transition in your project: Drag the transition on top of the existing transition.\n\nAlternatively, you can select the edit point first, then double-click a transition in the Transitions browser to apply the transition.\n\nFinal Cut Pro creates the transition at the edit point using media handles. If the video clip has attached audio, a crossfade transition is applied to the audio.\n\nTip: You can use the Cross Dissolve transition to quickly create a “fade up from black” effect at the beginning of a clip or project or a “fade to black” effect at the end. See Quickly create a fade-in or fade-out effect, below.\n\nYou can use the Cross Dissolve transition to quickly create a “fade in from black” effect at the beginning of your project or a “fade to black” effect at the end. (Fade effects commonly appear at the beginning or end of a movie or TV show.)\n\nNote: These instructions describe a quick way to create a fade effect, but this method doesn’t allow for fine-tuning. For more precise control over the fade, use keyframes to change the opacity over time. See Intro to video keyframing in Final Cut Pro for Mac and Add video effect keyframes in Final Cut Pro for Mac.\n\nIn Final Cut Pro, add one or more clips to the timeline.\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nCreate a fade-in: Select the start point of the first clip in the timeline.\n\nCreate a fade-out: Select the end point of the last clip in the timeline.\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nChoose Edit > Add Cross Dissolve (or press Command-T) to add the default Cross Dissolve transition to the selection. To change the default transition, see Set the default transition.\n\nClick the Transitions button in the top-right corner of the timeline (or press Control-Command-5), then drag the Cross Dissolve transition from the Transitions browser to the selection.\n\nMake adjustments to the Cross Dissolve transition, as needed.\n\nSee Adjust transitions in the timeline in Final Cut Pro for Mac and Adjust transitions in the inspector and viewer in Final Cut Pro for Mac.\n\nFinal Cut Pro creates the transition at the edit point using media handles. If the video clip has attached audio, a crossfade transition is applied to the audio.\n\nNote: If you want to include connected clips in the fade effect, select them along with the original clip and make a compound clip before applying the Cross Dissolve transition.\n\nAfter you add a transition to your project and make adjustments to it, you can reuse it anywhere else in your project.\n\nIn Final Cut Pro, select a transition in the timeline.\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nChoose Edit > Copy (or press Command-C), click the edge of a clip (an edit point) in the timeline, then choose Edit > Paste (or press Command-V).\n\nHold down the Option key and drag the transition to another edit point.\n\nIf you copy a transition to an edit point that already has a transition, the existing transition is overwritten."
