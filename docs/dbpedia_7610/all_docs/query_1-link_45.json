        "text": "Nik Color Efex is a vast library of creative effect filters that you can use one at a time or in limitless combination; you can also edit the effects using global correction tools and local adjustments.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nThis page presents Nik Color Efex’s specific features and tools. All the tools common to the other Nik Collection plug-ins are presented in the Interface and common tools page of this user guide. Here you’ll find information on the following points:\n\nPreferences.\n\nInterface.\n\nCategories, filters and presets management.\n\nLocal adjustments.\n\nSome of the Viveza tools are also available as filters in Nik Color Efex:\n\nGlobal adjustments.\n\nSelective tone.\n\nWhite balance.\n\nWhen image opens\n\nWhen image opens\n\nWhen you open an image in Nik Color Efex, it appears as it is in the host-app or as it is on the hard disk, if you are using standalone mode. No corrections, filters or presets are applied at this stage.\n\nEach time you add a filter or a preset, the associated tools will be displayed in the right panel, under the Loupe and the Histogram sections. They will appear in the same order as you select them, from top to bottom, but you can reorder them at will:\n\nIn the right panel, click and hold the click on the filter name.\n\nMove upwards or downwards, a yellow line shows you where you can drop.\n\nDrop and release the mouse button.\n\nThis feature will help you to prioritize or reorder which filters and which relevant tools you want to use. For example, you may want to work on lightness and contrast before color, or you want to apply basic settings (Viveza filters) before going more creative with other filters.\n\nNik Color Efex lets you stack up to 15 filters in the right panel. You can also add the same filter as much as you need (in the limit of 15 stacks).\n\nAs soon as you try to add more than 15 stacks, a warning box will prompt you to remove some filters before.\n\nFilter Library\n\nNik Color Efex offers 61 filters and presets, including ClearView, Grain, HSL and the Viveza filters with Global adjustment, Selective tone and White balance. When you select a category, only the filters in that category will be displayed in the list in the left panel. To display the full list of the presets and filters provided by Color Efex, click on the All Nik category. If you click on All Personal, all your custom presets and filters will be displayed.\n\nThere are different versions of each filter: click on the chevron on the right to see them. To apply a Filter, either click on its name or on one of the thumbnails once you’ve clicked on the chevron. The associated tools will then appear in the right panel. To add a Filter, click on the “+” button.\n\nYou can add a filter to your favorites, but not an individual thumbnail. Your favorites are shown by a gold star. To find your favorite or recently used filters, click on the buttons located above the Filters list.\n\nWhen you open an image in Color Efex, the default behavior is not to apply any filter or preset. Each filter comes in several variants, which you can browse by clicking on the chevron on the right. When you apply a filter, the first in the list is the default rendering. This is indicated by a small yellow bookmark, visible when you hover the mouse over the thumbnail.\n\nHowever, for each filter, you can change the default rendering. To do this, simply move the mouse over the thumbnail and click on the hollowed-out bookmark, which turns yellow.\n\nB/W Conversion\n\nUse this filter to convert a color image into a black and white version, and control shadows, highlights, and relationships between the original colors. Three black and white conversion modes are available in the filter displayed in the right panel:\n\nB/W Conversion: black and white conversion (default setting).\n\nTonal Enhancer: improves the rendering of the different tonal ranges.\n\nDynamic Contrast: Creates a stronger and harder contrast effect (brighter highlights, denser shadows).\n\nThe tools available vary depending on the conversion mode selected.\n\nBi-Color Filters\n\nSimulates a traditional two-color glass filter by mixing two colors and then adding the result to the image. From the drop-down menu, select a predefined color combination, each with four variations.\n\nBi-Color User Defined\n\nSimulates a traditional two-color glass filter by mixing two colors and then adding the result to the image. Both colors can be customized.\n\nBleach Bypass\n\nSimulates the technique used on color films where the bleaching process has been skipped. The result is high contrast and low saturation. Both set photographers and animated filmmakers use this effect to create striking, stylized images.\n\nBrilliance / Warmth\n\nLets you control the brightness of the color within the photo and give it a warm or cool tone.\n\nClassical Soft focus\n\nThis option simulates blur filters and traditional diffusion techniques.\n\nClearView\n\nThe goal of DxO ClearView is to reduce atmospheric haze. ClearView can also be used to give your images greater impact.\n\nSet to 0 by default, the Intensity slider will recover black tones which improves the perception of details, contrast and color saturation.\n\nColor Stylizer\n\nUse this filter to overlay a color on the photo, while retaining control of the color saturation of the original image.\n\nColorize\n\nInks the image with one color, and offers different color and contrast relationships to stylize the image.\n\nContrast Color Range\n\nAdjusts the contrast between the selected colors in an image.\n\nContrast Only\n\nThis filter provides various controls for contrast, including the “Contrast Only” method, which adjusts contrast without changing the color of the objects in the photo.\n\nCross Balance\n\nSimulates the use of a daylight film under artificial tungsten-type light, or a tungsten color film in daylight. Use this filter to warm up your photos with an orange color or cool them down with a bluish effect.\n\nCross Processing\n\nProvides a variety of different options for C41 to E6 processing (color negative film processing in slide film chemicals) and E6 to C41 processing (slide film processing in color negative film chemicals).\n\nDark Contrasts\n\nUses an exclusive technique to amplify details and textures throughout the photo, with a denser and more striking rendering.\n\nDarken / Lighten Center\n\nDraws the eye towards the center of the photo or away from it. A light center and dark edges draw the eye toward the center of the image, while a dark center and light edges draw the eye toward the edges.\n\nDetail Extractor\n\nUses a unique new technique to exaggerate details to create oustanding stylish photos. Use this filter to balance light and tone, and extract detail throughout the photo.\n\nDuplex\n\nCreates a two-color effect and offers different options for color, blur and saturation.\n\nDynamic Skin Softener\n\nCreates soft, shiny skin without altering other objects in the image. You can also use this filter in photos that do not show a person if you want to apply the softening effect to other subjects.\n\nFilm Efex: Faded\n\nThe Film Efex Series “Faded” filter applies a unique style to the image, giving the impression that the photo has been aged.\n\nFilm Efex: Modern (Branded)\n\nThe “Modern” filter from the Film Efex series is used to simulate the appearance of color films, negatives and slides, including grain. Using the advanced sliders in the “Film Details” section, you can even define your own film types to create never-before-seen imaginary films.\n\nFilm Efex: Nostalgic\n\nThe “Nostalgic” filter in the Film Efex series creates effects based on imaginary film types. Use this filter to create special and interesting interpretations of your photo, with vivid colors, and give the feeling that it was taken by a toy camera.\n\nFilm Efex: Vintage\n\nThe Vintage filter in the Film Efex series creates photos that feel like they have been taken with the very earliest types of color film.\n\nFilm Grain\n\nAdds a realistic film grain to images.\n\nFog\n\nSimulates a traditional fog effect: a pronounced blur that gives this look to the image.\n\nFoliage\n\nIdentifies foliage and greenery in an image, and enhances or stylizes these objects.\n\nGlamour Glow\n\nProvides portrait photographers with a powerful tool to stylize images with soft and dreamlike effects.\n\nGlobal Adjustments (Viveza)\n\nThe sliders provide all the tools for basic tonal and color corrections:\n\nBrightness: adjusts the brightness, darker on the left, lighter on the right.\n\nContrast: adjusts the contrast — that is, the difference in luminosity between the dark and light parts of the image. Towards the left, the image will be flatter and less saturated, towards the right, the image will be more punchy and more saturated.\n\nSaturation: acts on the brilliance of the colors, more vivid towards the right, and less and less saturated towards the left, until obtaining a completely gray image.\n\nStructure: reinforces the details and gives more spiciness to the image. Set to the left, the slider softens the details.\n\nShadows: adjusts the brightness of dark areas in the image.\n\nWarmth: set to the left, cools the colors (towards blue), set to the right, warms the colors (towards yellow/orange).\n\nRed: lets you mitigate a dominant color (more cyan on the left, more red on the right).\n\nGreen: lets you mitigate a dominant color (more magenta on the left, more green on the right).\n\nBlue: lets you mitigate a dominant color (more yellow on the left, more blue on the right).\n\nHue: shifts the set of colors towards their opposing hues (for example, the blue of the sky turns magenta to the right, or green to the left).\n\nGraduated Filters\n\nSimulates the use of a traditional glass graduated filter that fuses a color in one half of the photo.\n\nGraduated Fog\n\nSimulates a traditional glass filter and lets you add an accentuated softening effect to one half of the photo.\n\nGraduated Neutral Density\n\nDarkens or brightens part of an image while preserving its color. Use this filter to correct the tonality of an image that is too high in contrast.\n\nGraduated User Defined\n\nSimulates the use of a traditional graduated glass filter and lets you select any color to merge it into one half of the photo.\n\nGrain\n\nThe Grain filter simulates film grain*, based on different real brands and types of color negatives and slides, analyzed by DxO Labs, to the contrary of Color Efex legacy filters like Film Efex and Film grain, which simulates a generic grain.\n\nThe Grain filter simulates grain only, and not the color and contrast rendering of the different color films provided here. It is up to you to create a rendering that follows your taste, by using the Nik Color Efex tools.\n\nThe drop-down Grain menu, set to Original by default (no grain applied) shows the list of silver emulsion films. Hover the mouse over the list to see a preview of the effect on the image.\n\nOnce you have made your choice, you can use the sliders to adjust the intensity of the grain and its size:\n\nIntensity: set at 100 by default, the slider strengthen or reduce the presence of grain, making it more or less visible in your edit. Zoom in the image for finer control.\n\nGrain Size: set to a low value by default (1.0), you may want to increase the value and zoom in on the photo to see the effect.\n\nHSL\n\nThe Hue/Saturation/Luminance (HSL) filter lets you selectively correct colors using:\n\n8 color channels,\n\na global channel,\n\n4 sliders that alter color hue, saturation, luminance and uniformity,\n\na vibrancy slider (global channel only),\n\na HSL color picker and a color scale (except for the global channel).\n\nThis tool also allows you to:\n\nstrengthen or reduce colors,\n\nmodify or even replace colors,\n\nstandardize hue variations for a color.\n\nAt the top of the section, colored clickable tiles indicate the color channels to select (left to right):\n\nGlobal channel (multicolor tile)\n\nRed\n\nOrange\n\nYellow\n\nGreen\n\nCyan\n\nBlue\n\nPurple\n\nMagenta\n\nWorking with the color channels\n\nThe selected channel tile will have a white border. Should a hue, saturation, luminance or uniformity adjustment be made, a white dot appears under the tile of the corresponding channel or channels.\n\nThe sliders enable the following corrections:\n\nHue: Changes the color of the selected channel. If the global channel is selected, all colors will be modified by the respective opposite hues, according to the chromatic wheel principle.\n\nSaturation: reduces or reinforces the active hue; when moved to the left the hue gradually desaturates towards gray, moved to the right the hue becomes more saturated. If the global channel (white channel) is selected, the slider effect will apply to all hues.\n\nLuminance : applies to the brightness of the active hue. Moving it to the left dims the hue and, to the right makes it brighter, while preserving saturation. This slider is not available when the global channel (white tile) is active.\n\nUniformity: applies to the homogeneity of the hues of the active channel. Increasing the value (to the right) will reduce the shade variations of the target hue. By reducing its value (to the left), the color variation of the active channel is accentuated. This slider is not available when the global channel (white tile) is active.\n\nColor range scale: gives you a higher control and precision on hue selection, transition with adjacent hues and fall off. Please see the Using the HSL color picker and the color range scale paragraph for more information.\n\nWhen a channel is selected, the Saturation and Luminance slider bars turn that color (e.g. if the green channel is active, the bars are green). This does not apply if the global channel (multicolor tile) is active.\n\nYou can work on several channels in the same image, including the global channel. To do this, simply click on the tile you want, whether it is active or not.\n\nUsing the HSL color picker and the hue range scale\n\nThe HSL color picker allows you to do more precise hue selection by clicking in the image. You can increase the radius of the hue selection with the Radius slider, which is set to 5 pix by default (size range is 1-50 pixels).\n\nThe hue range scale is a flat view of the RGB color wheel (colors are presented with all the hues as a circle, which helps also to visualize the opposite hue, for example, yellow and blue are opposite).\n\nWhen you click in the image with the HSL color picker, the range of hues will be displayed in the scale.\n\nThe two vertical dotted white lines are the limits of the hue range, and you can refine it manually with the two handles above the scale: move them closer to each other to reduce the hue range, move them in the opposite way to extend it and, thus, to include more hues in the selection.\n\nThe two handles below the scale allows you to adjust the transition hues: the farther you move out the two vertical lines, the smoothest the transitions.\n\nWorking with the global channel\n\nThe global channel lets you adjust the hues and the colors in the whole image. If you use the HSL color picker, the HSL panel will switch to the individual channel mode.\n\nWhen active, the global channel mode displays 3 sliders:\n\nHue: set to 0 by default, it will affect the colors globally and introduce a strong color cast, depending on the slider position. The slider scale displays the 8 color channels, if you position the slider within red, a strong red cast will be applied to the whole image.\n\nSaturation: set to 0 by default, the slider boosts all the colors the same way. If you move to the left, all the colors will start to turn grey.\n\nVibrancy: set to 0 by default, the slider boosts the colors in a more subtle way. The hues which are already well saturated won’t be affected too much, and the emphasis will be on the less saturated hues. Beside this, the blue sky will be reinforced without affecting the other hues too much, and the skin hues will be protected from excessive saturation.\n\nHigh Key\n\nLets you simulate the look of a photo in bright light, with uniformly light tones and low contrast. This filter is also useful for enhancing photos originally taken without highlights.\n\nImage Borders\n\nUse this filter to add a unique, natural, and random outline to your photos. This filter uses Nik’s exclusive technologies to create borders that are not only infinitely variable, but also incredibly natural.\n\nIndian Summer\n\nIdentifies foliage and greenery in an image, and enhances or stylizes these objects. This filter can be used to create warm colors similar to autumn landscapes.\n\nInfrared Film\n\nSimulates color and black & white infrared films. This filter simulates different methods of capturing the infrared portion of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum, as well as the effects produced by films capable of capturing these wavelengths.\n\nInk\n\nSimulates the stylistic effect of special photographic papers and toners.\n\nLevels & Curves\n\nLevels and curves are among the most commonly used tools for adjusting the brightness and tone of an image. This filter is especially useful when combined with other filters in a stack.\n\nLow Key\n\nLets you simulate the look of a photo in low light, with uniform dark tones and low contrast. This filter is also useful for enhancing photos originally taken without low light.\n\nMidnight\n\nCreates the illusion of a photograph taken at night to gives the image character. Use the Midnight filter to create a cinematic effect and reduce detail throughout the image with an advanced blur technique.\n\nMonday Morning\n\nCreates a diffused atmosphere and gives the photo a restful look. Use this filter to control contrast and saturation, add grain and apply a blur effect.\n\nOld Photo\n\nTransforms an image so that it looks like an old photo. Different styles let you simulate various color or black & white processes.\n\nPaper Toner\n\nSimulates the different types of toners commonly used in black & white prints in the darkroom. Use this filter to automatically convert an image to a black & white version before adding the toner effect. For best results and accuracy, apply the B/W Conversion filter first.\n\nPastel\n\nBrightens and softens the image by giving it a smooth and stylish effect. The result is an understated, desaturated image.\n\nPhoto Stylizer\n\nUse this filter to give style to any or ordinary image and make it more attractive.\n\nPolarization\n\nSimulates the polarization filter (or PL) of traditional glass. Use this filter to accentuate the blue of the sky while increasing the contrast in the rest of the image.\n\nPolaroid Transfer\n\nSimulates the effect of Polaroid Instant Processing color film and the transfer of the rough image to paper before it is fully developed. The result is a version of the image with low saturation and contrast, with subtle shades of color throughout the image.\n\nPro Contrast\n\nProvides advanced options that change the color and contrast of images by analyzing each one and making improvements based on their specifics. Use this filter if you want to increase contrast levels while maintaining detail throughout the image.\n\nReflector Efex\n\nSimulates traditional photographic reflectors that allow shadows to stand out and control the light in the image.\n\nRemove Color Cast\n\nLets you remove color dominants from the photo quickly and efficiently.\n\nSelective Tones (Viveza)\n\nThese tools will help you to adjust tonal ranges (highlights, midtones, shadows, blacks):\n\nHighlights: moved to the left, this slider recovers information and details in the brightest parts of the image, especially those close to the clipping (right end of the histogram). Moved to the right, it allows you to give more brightness to the lightest tones.\n\nMidtones: this slider affects the midtones (shown in the central section of the histogram).\n\nShadows: this slider allows you to lighten the shadows and dark parts of an image.\n\nBlacks: moving the slider to the right lets you set the “black point” (left end of the histogram) and thus avoid clipping the darkest parts of the image. Conversely, moving the slider to the left, you will make the darkest areas of the image even more dense.\n\nSkylight Filter\n\nSimulates warming lens filters. Use this filter to attenuate dominant blues while adding warmth sparingly to the colors in the photo.\n\nSolarization\n\nSimulates the Sabatier darkroom process (more often called solarization). Use this filter to create a style effect in which certain tones and colors are reversed.\n\nSunlight\n\nThis filter adds natural sunlight and warmth to the image. Use this filter to give the impression that your photo was taken on a warm, sunny day.\n\nTonal Contrast\n\nThis filter lets you modify the textures and details of the photo efficiently.\n\nVignette: Blur\n\nAttenuates the details around the center of the image, allowing the eye to be drawn into the image.\n\nVignette Filter\n\nSimulates the application of a vignetting effect worthy of a darkroom.\n\nVignette: Lens\n\nSimulates the vignetting created by different types of lenses. The darkening of the edge of the frame helps to draw the viewer’s eye within the image boundaries and gives the picture more depth.\n\nWhite Balance (Viveza)\n\nThe White Balance tool allows you to restore natural, balanced colors and compensate for the presence of colored dominants. Of course, you can also take advantage of it to create special effects and renderings:\n\nIn the White Balance, click the pipette to activate it.\n\nMove the mouse pointer over the image and it will turn into an eyedropper.\n\nYou can adjust the diameter of the sampling area (shown by the circle at the end of the dropper) using the Radius slider. The default diameter is 5 pixels, on a scale from 1 to 50 pixels.\n\nTo neutralize a dominant, click on a neutral area of the image, white or gray.\n\nTo introduce a dominant, click on the desired neutral color (for example, click on a blue to warm up the image, click on a yellow, orange or red to cool it down).\n\nYou can change the white balance as many times as you wish by clicking repeatedly in the image.\n\nChange or fine-tune white balance\n\nWhether you want to neutralize a color cast or alter the warmth of the image, you can fine-tune the white balance using the Temperature slider. Set to 0 by default, its scale ranges from -1\n\nWhite Neutralizer\n\nRemoves color dominants from light-colored objects, such as a white wall or a wedding dress. Use this filter to clean up images and create bright, vivid whites without changing other colors in the photo.\n\nOverview\n\nThe right panel shows the filters and presets selected in the left panel, and their associated tools, sliders and settings.\n\nEach filter in Nik Color Efex uses a number of sliders and tools specific to the adjustments and effects it offers. They are used in the same way from one filter to another:\n\nThe sliders all have a default value which may be 0%, 50% or 100%, depending on the case and effect.\n\nSliders affecting brightness and tonality go from dark on the left to brighter on the right.\n\nSliders affecting colour and effects are less intense to the left and more intense to the right.\n\nThe Strength sliders can be moved from 0% (no correction or effect) to 100% (maximum correction or effect).\n\nTo reset a slider to its default value, double-click on it.\n\nIn the drop-down lists, hover your mouse over the effects and renders to preview them. Click on the desired effect or rendering to apply it.\n\nYou can select the same filter several times if you wish.\n\nYou can reorder filters by dragging and dropping each section.\n\nFilter effect mask\n\nAnother way to preview the adjustments is to toggle the Filter effect mask button, especially with an active local adjustment. The image turns into grey levels, white areas showing where the effect is 100%, black areas showing where there is no effect, and all gray levels showing the effect amount variations. It is also a good help to adjust the Opacity slider.\n\nTo the contrary of the local adjusment masks, the filter effect mask does takes into account:\n\nThe local mask opacity.\n\nThe impact of the global mask.\n\nIn other words, the black and white mask shows only shades of gray to indicate where the effect will be stronger or weaker.\n\nOpacity slider\n\nWhen using a Nik Color Efex filter, you can fine-tune the overall intensity of the effect and the corrections it applies.\n\nBy default, the slider is set to 100, its maximum value. Set it to 50 to halve the intensity, and to 0 for no correction at all.\n\nWhen you apply Local adjustments, another Opacity slider lets you adjust the intensity of the locally applied corrections, independent of the overall opacity slider.\n\nLevels & Curves tool\n\nThe Levels and Curves tool is found in the Filters list, in the Contrast category. Select it and it will be added to the Nik Color Efex Pro Filters section in the right panel.\n\nThe Curve lets you refine or completely rework the contrast in your images, by affecting the curve either globally or via the RGB channel, and by using the Level sliders:\n\nRGB button: this is selected by default and is used to adjust the brightness and contrast of your image without altering the colors. The histogram represents the 3 RGB channels combined, and the curve is white.\n\nThe R, G, and B buttons: let you adjust the brightness of the Red, Green or Blue channels, to attenuate or reinforce their respective dominance. The histogram represents the selected channel and the curve takes the color of the chosen channel (red, green, or blue curve).\n\nCurve: click on the curve and hold down the left mouse button to adjust it. You can add anchor points to the curve, which will allow you to lock the contrast settings to specific points on the curve, and therefore on the image. To remove an anchor point, double-click on it.\n\nLevels sliders: Move the Shadows (left), Midtones (center), or Highlight (right) sliders to adjust their respective ranges.\n\nTo reset the settings:\n\nClick on the double arrow and select Reset Filter (you have the option of keeping or removing the local settings).\n\nDouble-click on the anchor point(s) to remove them (the curve is reset once the last remaining anchor point is removed).\n\nTo temporarily disable the tool effects, check/uncheck the Levels & Curves box.\n\nLocal adjustments\n\nLocal adjustments are available with all Nik Color Efex’s original filters and settings.\n\nTherefore, you will be able to apply the different effects on parts of the image and adjust their opacity. The associated sliders and settings are available next to each local adjustment dot, and in the filter sections in the right panel. If you move a slider for a local adjustment, the slider in the right panel will also move and vice versa.\n\nIn addition to the common black-handled settings of size, Lm (Luminance), Chr (Chrominance) and Df (Diffusion), you have the following slider:"
