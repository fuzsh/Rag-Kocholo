        "text": "Graphic Design (MFA)\n\nThe graphic design program focuses on the development of a cohesive, investigative body of work, also known as the student’s thesis. At Yale, the graphic design thesis is conceived as a loose framework within which each student’s visual method is deployed across many diverse projects during the two-year course of study. While every thesis project is unique, there are several common features: a focus on methodology, the application of a visual method to studio work, and the organization of the work in a thoughtfully argued written document and “Thesis Book.”\n\nThe individual collection of graphic design work by each student is supported on several levels simultaneously: studio work led by faculty meeting weekly; small six-person thesis groups meeting biweekly; individual sessions with writing and editing tutors; and lectures, presentations, and workshops.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe School of Art provides digital lab facilities however all graphic design students are expected to have their own personal computer. Each student has a designated work space in the design studio loft and has access to equipment including bookbinding materials, wide format printers, a RISO duplicator, Vandercook press, and work spaces in the School of Art buildings. More resources supporting interdisciplinary projects including motion capture and VR is available at the nearby Center for Collaborative Arts and Media. In addition, students draw on the extraordinary resources of Yale University courses, conferences, films, lectures, and museums, and especially the extensive research and rare book collections of Sterling, Haas, and Beinecke libraries.\n\nTwo-year and preliminary-year programs\n\nEach year, up to twelve students are admitted into the two-year graphic design program, and up to six students are admitted into the preliminary-year program. Two-year program students typically have a BFA in Graphic Design and are expected to have substantial and distinguished professional experience. Students applying to the preliminary-year program typically have relevant experience in a field of study outside design and demonstrate evidence of strong visual acuity. After successful completion of the preliminary year, these students automatically continue on in the two-year M.F.A. program.\n\nCredit Requirements\n\n60 credits total are required to graduate. 42 credits in your area of concentration (including Art 949a, Critical Practice), and 18 additional credits, including a minimum of 6 academic credits which can be selected from throughout the University’s rich offerings.\n\nTypical Plan of Study\n\nPreliminary-Year\n\nThe preliminary year has a required studio course sequence and additional electives are not recommended.\n\nFall\n\nArt 710a, Preliminary Studio: 6 credits\n\nArt 264a2, Typography: 3 credits\n\nArt 370a, Designing with Time, Motion and Sound: 3 credits\n\nArt 468a, Advanced Graphic Design: Series and Systems: 3 credits\n\nTotal minimum credits for fall term: 15\n\nSpring\n\nArt 711b, Preliminary Studio: 6 credits\n\nArt 265b, Expression, Structure, and Sequence: Typography: 3 credits\n\nArt 369b, Interactive Design and the Internet: 3 credits\n\nArt 469b, Advanced Graphic Design: History, Editing, and Interpretation: 3 credits\n\nTotal minimum credits for spring term: 15\n\nFirst year\n\nThere are 3 required courses in the first year of the two-year program, totaling 15 credits.

Within this setting, the program encourages diversity of practice and interpretation, innovation, and experimentation.\n\nApproximately twenty-one students are admitted each year. At the core of instruction are individual and group critiques with faculty, visiting critics, and visiting artists. In addition, students participate in a variety of seminars taught by both faculty and critics. The study of printmaking is integrated into the painting program, and a student may concentrate in painting, printmaking, or a combination of the two.\n\nStudents work in individual 300-square-foot studios at 353 Crown Street adjacent to Green Hall. Students have access to a printmaking workshop in the Crown Street building, equipped with two etching presses and a lithography press, a fully equipped silkscreen facility, as well as digital resources available in the print studio, throughout the School, and at the Center for Collaborative Arts and Media.\n\nCredit Requirements\n\n42 credits in area of concentration, including ART 949a, and 18 additional credits, including a minimum of 6 academic credits in courses outside the School of Art.\n\nTypical Plan of Study\n\nFirst year minimum credits\n\nART 545 Individual Criticism: … Fall: 6; Spring: 6\n\nART 510 Prit Crit:… Fall: 3; Spring: 3\n\nART 546a, Round Trip:… Fall: 3; Spring: 0\n\nART 949a, Critical Practice:… Fall: 3; Spring: 0\n\nAcademic or Studio Electives:… Fall: 0 … Spring: 6\n\nTotal minimum credits for Fall Term: 15\n\nTotal minimum credits for Spring Term: 15\n\nSecond year minimum credits\n\nART 545 Individual Criticism:… Fall: 6; Spring: 6\n\nART 510 Prit Crit:… Fall: 3; Spring: 3\n\nAcademic or Studio Electives:… Fall: 6; Spring: 6\n\nTotal minimum credits for Fall Term: 15\n\nTotal minimum credits for Spring Term: 15"
