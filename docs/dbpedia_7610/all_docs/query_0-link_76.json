        "text": "My thesis is that digital cinematography is now better in all respects than film has to offer. All triggered by looking at aspect ratios.\n\nThis based on comparing Oppenheimer and Top Gun Maverick. As per the forum guidelines I will stick to the technical parts, but full disclosure: I largely liked TGM as a movie, largely didn't like Oppenheimer. I saw both movies on 4K UHD blu-ray on an LG C18 4K OLED TV.\n\nInterestingly, both movies are definitely old school in some respects, using practical \"effects\" (almost?) exclusively and to a surprisingly large degree, respectively. They also both switch between regular scope / widescreen and flat / IMAX throughout the movie. It's that part that made reach for my TGM disc initially, because the Oppenheimer approach confused me.\n\nIn Oppenheimer, the aspect ratio of the UHD blu-ray disc switches between 2.2:1 for the stuff filmed in regular 70 mm and borderless 16:9 for the IMAX stuff. I gather that Nolan's approach was to always fill the width of the screen, which means that 1.43:1 IMAX image loses 12% off of both the top and bottom on a 16:9 screen. (And it pains me to think what happens in movie theaters that can't go taller than 2.39:1...)\n\nTGM, on the other hand, uses 1.9:1 digital IMAX with small black bars top and bottom. But the more striking difference between the two movies is that Oppenheimer seems to switch aspect ratios completely randomly. As much as I tried, I couldn't come up with any artistic intent behind this. Later on I realized they must simply have used regular 70 mm for anything with dialog and 15-perf 70 mm IMAX for anything else, as the IMAX cameras are simply too loud to record usable sound. As a result, at one point there is a switch from 70 mm to IMAX for a 1-second establishing shot as Oppenheimer visits his misstress (?) and back to 70 mm inside.\n\nI believe the more established use of aspect ratio switches is IMAX for action, scope for talking and other non-action. This is what Top Gun Maverick does, with no switching aspect ratios within a scene, even if part of an action scene is just people in the command center of an aircraft carrier sitting around looking at their screen.\n\nAnd now film vs digital\n\nAs I was watching Oppenheimer, I was regularly struck by how good the image looked. But at other times, it was just good, not exceptional. I think it doesn't help that Oppenheimer is almost completely a talking head movie, which doesn't inherently require ultra high definition. (Hey, I love having Office Space in 4K, but the higher rez doesn't make the movie any funnier.)\n\nAnd then I put in the TGM disc to confirm the aspect ratio change policy stated above. And I couldn't believe how much cleaner and more consistent that movie looked. Not sure if Oppenheimer's occasional greenish or drab looking scenes (especially that first exterior one in New Mexico) were intentional or just film stock / color grading limitations... And in Oppenheimer, there's always some grain, but at times it's quite significant. TGM is clean and consistent throughout: dark or bright scenes, no matter what. Also, want to read the text on the side of a helicopter parked some distance away? Just put your nose to the screen, no problem.\n\nOk, that's all rather subjective. This Youtube video looks at 11K B&W and 8K color scans and compares those with demos from digital cameras. Unfortunately that part doesn't work so well because for instance eyes are radically different sizes so hard to compare their sharpness. But what is obvious here is that the lenses used for the 15-perf IMAX are not of the quality we expect today, with some level of chromatic aberration (routinely digitally compensated for in cameras going back 15 years) and noticeable vignetting when viewing the full 1.43:1 image, such as in the top left corner at 6:53.\n\nIt's hard to compare film and digital resolution, as film resolution pretty much immediately dies at the Nyquist frequency (i.e., you need at least 2000 pixels to display 1000 individual white lines on a black background = line pairs) while for film as you go higher with the number of line pairs, the contrast will reduce until at some point you are just searching for meaning in the noise.\n\nBut if film at 70 x 50 mm struggles against current digital, with digital enjoying the latest and greatest when it comes to lenses while nobody is incentivised to build the niche lenses that can handle that large 70 x 50 negative, the only conclusion can be that film no longer reigns supreme when it comes to movie picture quality, even pulling out all the stops.\n\nAnd that's not even considering practicalities of the super big and noisy IMAX film cameras vs the digital ones small enough to put several in a fighter jet cockpit.\n\nEnd rant.\n\nThen this is more of a comparison of the transfers, since both movies were digital.\n\nWell, in each case you're comparing the output of an entire pipeline. With Top Gun Maverick the \"transfer\" is just some remapping in the digital domain, which I can only assume is as clean as it gets.\n\nWith Oppenheimer there is obviously a difference between seeing it in 70 mm IMAX or anything digital. Apparently during the digital evolution of IMAX, there was an IMAX with Laser stage, which can handle the original IMAX GT aspect ratio of 1.43:1. It uses dual 4K projectors with half-pixel shift so the perceived resolution should be around 6K, very similar to an IMAX GT release print, which has less resolution than the original camera negatives due to generational losses.\n\nSo that would be the ideal way to see whether the digital or optical \"transfer\" is better.\n\nBut I think these days, it's safe to assume that if you use high end equipment run by people who know what they're doing and a high enough resolution, you don't lose any information when scanning film.\n\nSo the big limitation is going from the original 8K scans (of the IMAX GT negatives for Oppenheimer) or the original 6K digital files (Top Gun Maverick) to 4K UHD blu-ray is definitely a step where sharpness is lost. (I got those numbers from various sources, they could be wrong...)\n\nHowever, like I said, although there's still some detail above 8K in a 70 x 50 mm negative, that doesn't mean that detail/contrast hasn't been deteriorating way before that. And 6K sounds great, but digital cameras use a bayer mosaic, so that a 24 megapixel sensor (still camera version of 6K) only has 6 red megapixels, 6 blue megapixels and 12 green megapixels. So somewhere between 3K and 6K you're losing sharpness.\n\nAnd don't forget that digital video needs significant anti-aliasing. For still photography, we've done away with anti-aliasing filters (for the most part?) but for video that leads to very noticeable artifacting. (Like you see in video games.)\n\nAnyway, after all of the above, I saw two movies, and came to the conclusion stated in the subject line.\n\nAlso I think a lot of the color grading issues stem from the time period represented. Like it or not people like period piece films to not have the same sharpness or saturation present in a modern day action movie. It should look likes its old, even if its new ... dagnabbit.\n\nYeah, because we all know the 1960s were in black-and-white but the 1940s were in color but drab and greenish.\n\nTo Malor's point: I think in many cases the lackluster color in old movies was cheapness, not lack of capability. Just look at restored versions of The Wizard of Oz or 2001 A Space Odyssey. Or anything in Technicolor back in the day, really.\n\nI'm not sure about the Oppenheimer color grading as it could be intentional. Or perhaps Nolan doesn't care. I was rather put off by the strange color cast in Dunkirk. But then other scenes in Oppenheimer are nice and sunny with fairly neutral colors.\n\nI don't think Nolan would intentionally limit sharpness, though, after everything he went through.\n\nOk, damn you malor for pushing me into a several-hour rabbit hole during what should be sedate hours at the end of the year...\n\nI don't think there are actually \"new colors\" in any of these movies. Yes, there are colorized movies, but that's starting with nothing and build from there. The much more interesting case is starting with a little, and deciding how much can reasonably be built from that.\n\nI'm pretty sure that in the Wizard of Oz, the ruby slippers were red, the yellow brick road was yellow, and the wicked witch of the west was green.\n\nBut... how red, yellow and green?\n\nThe intense colors we get from the latest 4K restorations? The muted colors common in print around the 1950s? Who knows? A human comparison between 1939 to 2023 is meaningless.\n\nI think the closest we can come is looking at old movies archived using separation masters (way too much and Star Wars themed background). This is when each color channel is saved individually on low-contrast black-and-white film. Obviously these three copies of the original will undergo the same ageing as they're chemically the same: a hopefully stable base (polyester?) with silver oxide representing the image.\n\nThis means the relative amounts of R, G and B, and thus the color saturation, remain the same over time.\n\nHowever, I don't know which, if any, 4K restorations are based (for color purposes) off of separation masters.\n\nI don't think there are actually \"new colors\" in any of these movies.\n\nFirst, I'm an amateur about color spaces. I understand roughly what they are, but I'm not super up on the details. This comment has a great deal of ignorance included, so take everything I say here with multiple grains of salt. I could be grossly mistaken.\n\nThat said, I'm reasonably sure that early color film simply couldn't represent a very deep color range. I suspect that if you mapped out their color spaces, they would look absolutely bizarre compared even to standard def, never mind one of the HDR specs. I think a great deal of the original color information has simply been lost, because the films weren't sensitive enough.\n\nI believe the process of remastering them is running a reverse computation on each frame; as they sample the color on the film, they want to figure out what the original color was, and do a mathematical transform. But AFAIK, each sampled pixel could potentially map to quite a number of original values, and they have to pick something. In other words, they're making up new colors, inventing new information, either on the fly or via post-processing, very possibly with human artists involved.\n\nIt's kind of like trying to reconstruct a cow from hamburger. A lot of the original is just gone. You're never going to get back the actual cow.\n\nI'm reasonably sure that early color film simply couldn't represent a very deep color range. I suspect that if you mapped out their color spaces, they would look absolutely bizarre compared even to standard def, never mind one of the HDR specs. I think a great deal of the original color information has simply been lost, because the films weren't sensitive enough.\n\nIf you go here and look at the frequency response curves of the three types of cones in the human eye in the image on the right, you'll see that they heavily overlap. So if you made a camera with those response curves and hooked up the output of the pixels that detect red, green and blue, respectively, to for instance an LCD monitor with R, G and B subpixels, the color reproduction would be extremely poor, because whenever there is red, there's also a lot of green, and the other way around.\n\nBut with some math you can compensate for the overlap. The frequency response curves are never flat non-zero, so each visible color results in a unique combination of the contributions of the three cones / channels. So we can always take the three samples and identify an individual color.\n\nAssuming the color filters used in front of the three film strips have roughly similar properties, this must be true for the three-strip technicolor system, too. Whether it was possible to project these colors at the time? That depends on how discriminating the filters were. It's likely that the color reproduction was less than ideal because of filter limitations and/or very accurate filters would make the image too dim.\n\nAnd even today we can't accurately reproduce colors. If you look at the horseshoe CIE diagram, different color spaces have different coverage. With RGB, you need to pick \"primaries\" for R, G and B. Obviously just lighting up one subpixel will then show the exact color of that primary. And by combining them you can display all the colors in the triangle between the three. But not anything that's outside that triangle. So with just three primaries you're never going to cover the monochromatic colors going from red through green to blue.\n\nBut with for instance the BT.2020 color space that is usually used for 4K HDR, you can still come close enough in practice.\n\nSo if we develop better displays in the future we could get even more color from a movie like The Wizard of Oz.\n\nI believe the process of remastering them is running a reverse computation on each frame; as they sample the color on the film, they want to figure out what the original color was, and do a mathematical transform. But AFAIK, each sampled pixel could potentially map to quite a number of original values\n\nNo, I don't think so. Of course noise/grain gets in the way, but ignoring that, all possible colors should provide slightly different levels of R, G and B on the three negatives and thus the scanned pixels.\n\nIf not, then what you'd get straight out of the scanner is a lot of banding, where what should be a continuous color gradient is a limited number of discrete steps.\n\nSo if we develop better displays in the future we could get even more color from a movie like The Wizard of Oz.\n\nNo argument to this point, but I'm pretty sure the actual film chemicals didn't have the capability of differentiating color the way modern color spaces do. Any given value on the film could potentially map to many possible colors in a modern colorspace. The response range of early color film is limited, more so at some frequencies than others. So a lot of the remastering will end up being fantasy colors, things they picked to look good, not actually accurate representations of the original image taken by the camera.\n\nIt's like trying to remaster SDR to HDR. It can be done, but the colors are inferred. It may look good, but it won't be the same as filming it in HDR in the first place. You can't make cows from hamburger.\n\nAgain, I'm far from an expert, but I believe I know at least that much.\n\nedit to add: have you ever seen images of the makeup they used to use for color TV and early film? It's wickedly garish, because the director knew that the film wouldn't represent the colors accurately. They had to use super weird color shades to get it to come out looking right on film or a TV camera. Their color reproduction was very poor.\n\nSo the original images are false to begin with. They started out as inaccurate reproductions of the images that were in front of the cameras. If they did a truly accurate remastering of the negatives, the resulting videos would be hideous.\n\nOk, think of it this way.\n\nFirst of all, panchromatic film had been in routine use for a decade. Panchromatic as in more or less equally sensitive to all visible wavelengths. (Life was more interesting in the 1920s and earlier where orthochromatic film was very sensitive to blue and not at all to red. White eyes, black lips...)\n\nNow let's film movies with a simple color space that goes from yellow to blue. So we take to strips of our film and put it in a camera with two lenses, each with a filter in front of it. The filters are terrible. The \"blue\" one lets through 80% of the shortest wavelengths and 60% of the longest (with the rolloff being reasonably linear / logarithmic) and then the \"yellow\" filter allows through 60% of the short and 80% of the long wavelengths.\n\nOh, turns out no jobs in hollywood so you're going to film monochromatic light sources to support research in color perception.\n\nJust to be lazy I'm going to assume visible wavelengths range from 0 bogowl to 100 bogowl.\n\nIt doesn't take much math to realize that the film behind both lenses sees intensities that are simple products of the variables in question, and these results can be reversed to get back to the original wavelenghts.\n\nFor instance, 24 through \"blue\" and 32 through \"yellow\" must be red (0 bogowl) at intensity 40. And 15 / 15 some kind of green. Or white. A color space with only two primaries has its limitations...\n\nAnyway, the point is that as long as the response curves of the film and the filters encompass the visible spectrum to a sufficient degree and those curves are at least somewhat discriminating and smooth enough, all the colors do actually end up on the film.\n\nIn a way that you can display using the technology of the day? That's a different question. Three-strip has the best cards here. But it was also highly impractical and it's amazing how good color film and especially color reversal film relatively soon and eventually.\n\nToo bad that Hollywood didn't always prioritize the best possible image quality. Directors/DPs often chose faster film to need less light or cheaper film for obvious reasons.\n\nI've read more than a few pieces on how old movies are restored, and none of them include inventing colors that are really not there in the scans. (Obviously colorizing B&W movies is a different beast.)\n\nSo if we develop better displays in the future we could get even more color from a movie like The Wizard of Oz.\n\nYou're missing the fundamental fact that film systems, like all recording systems, have a color space as well.\n\nRecording systems have often had wider gamuts than display systems, but both have improved over time, and it'd need some actual citations to claim that 1930s film tech had a wider gamut than modern display tech.\n\nNo argument to this point, but I'm pretty sure the actual film chemicals didn't have the capability of differentiating color the way modern color spaces do.\n\nIf we're talking 3-strip Technicolor, like Oz was filmed in back in 1939, there's both the response curve per wavelength of light of each film strip (the red and blue strips definitely were very different) and the attributes of the two color filters (the green one was part of the camera, the red one was part of the red/blue film stack).\n\nedit to add: have you ever seen images of the makeup they used to use for color TV and early film? It's wickedly garish, because the director knew that the film wouldn't represent the colors accurately. They had to use super weird color shades to get it to come out looking right on film or a TV camera. Their color reproduction was very poor.\n\nI believe this isn't correct, and that the actual reason is what I noted above: the lighting used with old film was very bright. Colors were exaggerated so they wouldn't be washed out by the lighting, and the lighting was so strong because film wasn't nearly as sensitive back then as more recent film is/was. 3-strip Technicolor was ASA 5, which would need roughly twenty times the exposure of ISO 100 film to generate the same density. With movies, you can't just keep extending the exposure time to deal with low sensitivity, since the frame rate puts an absolute upper limit on exposure time per frame.\n\nYou're missing the fundamental fact that film systems, like all recording systems, have a color space as well.\n\nActually, what I'm thinking is that image recording technologies don't have an inherent color space. A color space becomes relevant when storing the image.\n\nUnfortunately, both searching online and trying experiment with my Nikon raw files is inconclusive.\n\nRecording systems have often had wider gamuts than display systems, but both have improved over time, and it'd need some actual citations to claim that 1930s film tech had a wider gamut than modern display tech.\n\nBut back to the original question: is what we see in the 4K restoration of the Wizard of Oz something that is a somewhat faithful reproduction of what was recorded on set, or is there stuff in there that was just made up?\n\n(I did read a story about the restoration where they mentioned that the ruby shoes were so red and so sparkly in HDR that they had to turn both of those things down to avoid becoming a distraction.)\n\nI believe this isn't correct, and that the actual reason is what I noted above: the lighting used with old film was very bright. Colors were exaggerated so they wouldn't be washed out by the lighting, and the lighting was so strong because film wasn't nearly as sensitive back then as more recent film is/was.\n\nYou are surely not saying that what we see in the 4K version is not a true depiction of the real-life Oz??\n\nYes, the sets, wardrobe and makeup were certainly exaggerated to survive the limitations of the imaging pipeline... Is that something we should compensate for, though?\n\nEarlier today I was listening to a radio interview about \"restoring\" a 600-year-old paining by removing layers of paint. Cool new stuff underneath! But destroying the painting as we knew it in the process... (Hm, a certain space wizard trilogy director comes to mind...)\n\nOf course with movies we can have both versions, but it's still not a given that one approach is 100% correct and the other 100% incorrect.\n\nAttachments\n\nflowerjpegraw.jpg"
