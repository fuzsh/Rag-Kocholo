        "text": "by Scott Mehl © Unofficial Royalty 2012\n\nThe Royal Cemetery, near Raghadan Palace within the Royal Compound (Al-Marquar), is the resting place of the kings of Jordan, as well as other members of the Jordanian Royal Family. It includes three mausoleums containing the tombs of the three monarchs, as well as a long pavilion that faces them. Breaking with tradition, King Hussein had a huge mausoleum built for his third wife, the late Queen Alia, atop a large hill northwest of Amman. To date, she is the only monarch or consort buried outside of the Royal Cemetery. The Jordanian royal family follows the Sunni denomination of Islam.\n\nAll photos from Wikipedia unless otherwise noted.\n\n********************\n\nKings of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\n\nAbdullah I, King of Jordan, reigned May 25, 1946 – July 20, 1951 (assassinated)\n\nTalal I, King of Jordan, reigned July 20, 1951 – August 11, 1952 (abdicated)\n\nHussein I, King of Jordan, reigned August 11, 1952 – February 7, 1999\n\nAbdullah II, King of Jordan, reigned February 7, 1999 – present\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Jordanian Index\n\nOfficial Website: His Majesty King Abdullah II\n\n********************\n\nAbdullah I\n\nKing of Jordan\n\nreigned May 25, 1946 – July 20, 1951\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Abdullah I of Jordan\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Assassination of Abdullah I, King of Jordan\n\nKing Abdullah I was born in February 1882, the son of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, and Abdiya bint Abdullah.
