        "text": "Birth Name: Abdullah bin Hussein bin Talal bin Abdullah\n\nPlace of Birth: Amman, Jordan\n\nDate of Birth: 30 January, 1962\n\nEthnicity:\n\n*father – Jordanian Arab, some Turkish Cypriot\n\n*mother – English\n\nAbdullah II of Jordan, of the Hashemite Royal Family, has been King of Jordan, since 7 February, 1999. He was coronated on 9 June, 1999.\n\nHe is the son of Hussein, who was King of Jordan, from 11 August, 1952 to 7 February, 1999, and Princess Muna al-Hussein (born Antoinette Avril Gardiner), who was Princess consort of Jordan, from 25 May, 1961 to 21 December, 1972. His mother was born in Chelmondiston, Suffolk, England, and converted to Islam.\n\nAbdullah’s Hashemite family have ruled Jordan since 1921, and he is the fourth generation of his family to be the country’s King. The Hashemites ruled Mecca for over 700 years, until its 1925 conquest by the House of Saud. They are the oldest-ruling dynasty in the Muslim world, and are the second-oldest-ruling dynasty in the world, after the Imperial House of Japan.\n\nAbdullah II is married to Queen Rania of Jordan, with whom he has four children, including Hussein, Crown Prince of Jordan. His stepmother is Queen Noor of Jordan, who was married to his father, until his death.\n\nHis family claims agnatic descent from Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad.\n\nAbdullah II’s patrilineal line can be traced to Muhammad ibn Abd al-Mu’in (1776-c. 1858), also known as Muhammad ibn Awn (محمد ابن عون), who was Sharif and Emir of Mecca, from 1827 to 1836, 1840 to 1851, and 1856 to 1858.\n\nAbdullah II’s paternal grandfather was Talal of Jordan (the son of Abdullah I of Jordan, and of Musbah bint Nasser). Abdullah II’s grandfather Talal was born in Mecca, Ottoman Empire, and was King of Jordan, from 20 July, 1951 to 11 August, 1952. Abdullah II’s great-grandfather Abdullah I was born in Mecca, and was Emir of Transjordan, from 1 April, 1921 to 25 May, 1946, and King of Jordan, from 25 May, 1946 to 20 July, 1951. He was the son of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, who was born in Constantinople, and was Sharif and Emir of Mecca, from November, 1908 to 3 October, 1924, and King of the Arab Countries, from October, 1916 to 3 October, 1924; and of Abdiyya/Abdiyah bint Abdullah.\n\nAbdullah II’s great-grandmother Musbah bint Nasser was the first queen consort of Jordan. She was born in Mecca, the daughter of Amir Nasser Pasha and Dilber Khanum.\n\nAbdullah II’s paternal grandmother was Zein Al-Sharaf Talal, who was Queen consort of Jordan (the daughter of Sharif Jamal/Jamil ‘Ali bin Nasser; and of Wijdan Shakir Pasha). Zein was born in Alexandria, Sultanate of Egypt. Sharif was Sharif of Mecca, Governor of Hauran, and was the nephew of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca. Wijdan was the daughter of Shakir Pasha. Shakir was the great-nephew of Ottoman-Turkish Cypriot Governor of Cyprus, Kâmil Pasha.\n\nAbdullah II’s maternal grandfather was Col. Walter Percy Gardiner (the son of Arthur Gardiner and Mabel Jane Tovell). Col. Walter was born in Stanford RD, Norfolk, England. Arthur was the son of John Gardiner and Esther Scarph. Mabel was the daughter of Daniel Tovell and Ada Alberta King.\n\nAbdullah II’s maternal grandmother was Doris Elizabeth Sutton (the daughter of Arthur Sutton and Dora Elizabeth Alderton). Abdullah II’s grandmother Doris was born in Swaffham, England. Arthur was the son of Josiah Sutton and Elizabeth Able. Abdullah II’s great-grandmother Dora was the daughter of Augustus Newton Alderton and Gertrude Ruth Green.\n\nSources: Genealogies of Abdullah II of Jordan – https://www.geni.com\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com"
