        "text": "Career\n\nFollowing the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the new Ottoman government appointed Husein ibn Ali the sharif of Mecca, the protector of the holy places, which was a position his family had often held.\n\nAbdullah represented the Hejaz Province of western Arabia in the reorganized Ottoman parliament and participated in Arab political movements concerned with the question of autonomy or independence for Arab areas of the multinational Ottoman Empire.\n\nEven before the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Abdullah had discreetly contacted British officials in Egypt to learn Great Britain's attitude toward Arab political aspirations in the event of Ottoman involvement in war.\n\nConsequent negotiations led in part to the Arab Revolt of June 1916, in which Abdullah and Arab troops assisted British efforts to drive the Turks out of Syria.\n\nFollowing the war, Britain could not harmonize the pledges it had made to the French, the Zionists, and the Arabs-especially the Arab expectation for a separate and fully independent Arab state for the Fertile Crescent and Arabia.\n\nThe Arab National Congress at Damascus in 1920 elected Abdullah king of Iraq and his brother Faisal king of Syria, but the French seizure of Damascus in July 1920 upset the plans.\n\nAbdullah moved north in 1921 with troops to support Faisal's claims, but the pragmatic Abdullah acquiesced in Britain's immediate proposal to accept the newly created emirate of Transjordan, the largely arid territory east of the Jordan River. This land became formally independent in 1946, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1949.\n\nDuring the first Palestinian War of 1948-1949, Abdullah's British-trained Arab Legion held central Palestine, which Abdullah annexed in 1950 over the objections of Palestinians and the other Arab states.\n\nBecause of this and the general opinion that he was a moderate and was willing to reach an accommodation with Israel, Abdullah was killed by an embittered Palestinian on July 20, 1951, in Jerusalem-the nationalist of one generation assassinating the nationalist of an earlier one."
