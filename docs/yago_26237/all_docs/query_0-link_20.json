        "text": "This thread is to discuss the Hashemite dynasty, starting from HAshim ibn Abd al-Manaf, the founder of the dynasty, to King Talal I, father of King Hussein II and grandfather of the current King.\n\nHere is the brief introduction to the Hashemite dynasty:\n\nThe Hashemites trace their ancestry from Hashim ibn Abd al-Manaf, the great-grandfather of Prophet Muhammad, from who the dynasty name comes. It is also believed the dynasty is descendant from Fatima, the Prophet’s daughter. The struggle between Hashemites and rival dynasty Umayyads eventually led to the religious split between Sunni and Shia.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Ottoman power, Hussein bin Ali of the Hashemite dynasty rules and independent Hejaz. His rival, Ibn Saud, annexed Hejaz and named his own son, Faysal bin Abdelaziz al Saud as governor. The region was later incorporated into Saudi Arabia.\n\nOf Hussein’s 5 sons, the eldest, Ali, briefly succeeded to the Throne of Hejaz, before it was annexed to the Saud Family. His second son, Abdullah later became King of Transjordan, and whose descendants established the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Hussein’s third son, Faisal, was briefly King of Syria, before becoming King of Iraq. Hussein’s fourth son, Prince Zeid, became claimant to the Throne of Iraq, when his brother’s grandson was overthrown and murdered in 1958. Prince Hassan died at a young age.\n\nThe rule of Hashemite dynasty in Iraq ended after 1958 revolution, however the dynasty continues to successfully rule in Jordan.\n\nKing Hussein was very popular but he was king for 46 years. The only other two kings before him were reigning for 2 years before assassination and 1 year before being sent to a mental health institution so really I am not surprised about your statment of hussein being the most popular and abdullah doesn't match up to his father in many people's eyes. Rania definitely needs to spend much more time in Jordan doing things that actually makes a difference and to stop the top down attitude of knowing what is best. There are many educated people in Jordan but if you aren't a favourite then you don't get heard.\n\nKing Abdullah I may have been king for only 2 or 3 years, but since 1923 he was the Emir of (then) Transjordan.\n\nGenealogy of the Royal Family of Jordan\n\nAbdullah I bin Al-Hussein (Abd Allāh al-Awwal bin al-Husayn, 2 February 1882 – 20 July 1951)\n\nAbdullah married three times.\n\nIn 1904, Abdullah married his first wife, Musbah bint Nasser (1884 – 15 March 1961), at Stinia Palace, İstinye, Istanbul, Ottoman Empire.

Married Abdul-Karim Ja'afar Zeid Dhaoui.\n\nKing Talal (26 February 1909 – 7 July 1972).\n\nPrincess Munira (1915–1987). Never married.\n\nIn 1913, Abdullah married his second wife, Suzdil Khanum (d. 16 August 1968), in Istanbul, Turkey.
