        "text": "This article contains Arabic text. Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols.\n\nTalal bin Abdullah (Arabic language: طلال بن عبد الله‎, Ṭalāl ibn ʿAbdullāh; 26 February 1909 – 7 July 1972) was King of Jordan from the assassination of his father, King Abdullah I, on 20 July 1951, until he was forced to abdicate by Parliament on 11 August 1952. According to Talal, he was a 39th-generation direct descendant of Muhammad as he belongs to the Hashemite family—who have ruled Jordan since 1921.\n\nHe was born in Mecca as the eldest child of Abdullah and his wife Musbah bint Nasser. Abdullah was the son of Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca. Sharif Hussein led the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire in 1916; after removing Ottoman rule, Abdullah established the Emirate of Transjordan in 1921, a British Protectorate, for which he was Emir. During Abdullah's absence, Talal spent his early years alone with his mother. Talal received private education in Amman, later joining Transjordan's Arab Legion as second lieutenant in 1927. He then became aide to his grandfather Sharif Hussein, the ousted King of the Hejaz, during his exile in Cyprus. By 1948, Talal became a general in the Army.\n\nAbdullah sought independence in 1946, and the Emirate became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Talal became Crown Prince upon his father's designation as King of Jordan. Abdullah was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1951, and Talal became King. Talal's most revered achievement as King is the establishment of Jordan's modern constitution in 1952, rendering his kingdom as a constitutional monarchy. He ruled for less than thirteen months until he was forced to abdicate due to mental illness—reported as schizophrenia. Talal spent the rest of his life at a sanatorium in Istanbul and died there on 7 July 1972. He was succeeded by his oldest son Hussein.[1]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nHe was born in Mecca as the eldest child of Abdullah, an Arab deputy of Mecca in the Ottoman Parliament, and his wife Musbah bint Nasser. Abdullah was the son of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, traditional steward of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Sharif Hussein and his sons led the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire in 1916; after removing Ottoman rule, the Sharif's sons established Arab monarchies in place. Abdullah established the Emirate of Transjordan in 1921, a British Protectorate, for which he was Emir. During Abdullah's absence, Talal spent his early years alone with his mother. Talal received private education in Amman, later joining Transjordan's Arab Legion as second lieutenant in 1927. He then became aide to his grandfather Sharif Hussein, the ousted King of the Hejaz, during his exile in Cyprus. By 1948, Talal became a general in the Army.[2] He was educated privately before attending the British Army's Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from which he graduated in 1929 when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Cavalry Regiment of the Arab Legion. His regiment was attached to a British regiment in Jerusalem and also to the Royal Artillery in Baghdad.[3]\n\nReign[]\n\nTalal ascended the Jordanian throne after the assassination of his father, Abdullah I, in Jerusalem. His son, Hussein, who was accompanying his grandfather at Friday prayers was also a near victim. On 20 July 1951, Prince Hussein travelled to Jerusalem to perform Friday prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque with his grandfather, King Abdullah I. An assassin fearing that the king might normalise relations with the State of Israel, killed Abdullah, but the 15-year-old Hussein survived.[4]\n\nDuring his short reign he was responsible for the formation of a liberalised constitution for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which made the government collectively, and the ministers individually, responsible before the Jordanian Parliament. The constitution was ratified on 1 January 1952. King Talal is also judged as having done much to smooth the previously strained relations between Jordan and the neighbouring Arab states of Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIllness, death and funeral[]\n\nTalal lived the latter part of his life at a sanatorium in Istanbul and died there on 7 July 1972. Talal was buried in the Royal Mausoleum at the Raghadan Palace in Amman.[citation needed]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nDespite his short reign, he is revered for having established a modern constitution of Jordan.[5]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nIn 1934, Talal married his first cousin Zein al-Sharaf Talal who bore him four sons and two daughters:\n\nKing Hussein (14 November 1935 – 7 February 1999).\n\nPrincess Asma, died at birth in 1937.\n\nPrince Muhammad (born 2 October 1940).\n\nPrince Hassan (born 20 March 1947).\n\nPrince Muhsin, deceased.\n\nPrincess Basma (born 11 May 1951).\n\nTitles and honours[]\n\nTitles[]\n\n26 February 1909 – 25 May 1946: His Royal Highness Prince Talal of Jordan\n\n25 May 1946 – 20 July 1951: His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Jordan\n\n20 July 1951 – 11 August 1952: His Majesty The King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\n\nHonours[]\n\nJordan:\n\nHonorary Lieutenant in the Transjordan Frontier Force(1932)[3]\n\nHonorary Major General in the Arab Legion (1949)[3]\n\nField Marshal in the Arab Legion (1951)[3]\n\nGrand Collar of the Order of the Hashemites (1951)[3]\n\nGrand Master of the Order of al-Hussein bin Ali (1951)[3]\n\nGrand Master of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (1951)[3]\n\nGrand Master of the Order of Independence (1951)[3]\n\nIraq:\n\n1st Class Order of the Two Rivers of the Kingdom of Iraq (1951)[3]\n\nSpain:\n\nGrand Cross of the Order of Military Merit (1952)[6]\n\nSee also[]\n\nHashemites\n\nList of kings of Jordan\n\nKing Abdullah I\n\nKing Hussein\n\nReferences[]\n\nBibliography[]\n\nSalibi, Kamal (15 December 1998).
