They supported me through the pro­cess, by variously listening, lighting a fire u ­ nder me when I needed it, and giving feedback. I owe a special debt to Anshu, who motivated and pushed me in just the right ways at dif­fer­ent points from beginning to end. Mike gave me an initial push and discussed the ideas with me u ­ ntil the research was well underway. Rodrigo’s friendship and academic feedback then took over and saw me into the writing pro­cess. They gave short pieces of advice or listened to my long monologues as I worked out the material. Invariably, it was exactly what I needed at the time. Many ­people supported me and discussed my developing ideas. Early on, I was encouraged by positive feedback and long conversations with Jill Schwedler, Joel Beinin, Fred Lawson, and Harold Trinkunas. Mohammed Hafez and l­ater Clay Moltz, in their roles as colleagues and chairs of my department, provided feedback and supported my ability to devote time to writing. Julie Chernov Hwang helped me with the initial organ­izing of the book, and continued to listen when I needed to work ­things out. Dianna Beardslee was a supportive friend throughout, brain-­storming with me at times. Productive discussions with Roger Haydon at Cornell University Press helped shape and improve the book. I am grateful also to the two book reviewers, who provided timely comments, helping to improve the book. Aysar Hammoudeh was a fabulous, tireless researcher helping me to compile and translate primary sources. My former student, Stephen Klingseis, researched the effects of the refugees on w ­ ater, which we subsequently published as an article. I draw from our findings in chapter 2. My research benefited from the wonderful Greta Marlatt at the Dudley Knox library, who helped me generously in searching and citation advice. Rachel Templer edited my chapters and kept me to a tight schedule. Her skill in catching errors and suggesting improvements was invaluable. The Minerva Research Initiative funded other research before the book that helped to feed ideas for this work. The Abbasi Program in Islamic Studies at Stanford provided me with an institutional affiliation, for which I am grateful. Many Jordanians and Lebanese generously spoke with me, provided networks, aid, and hospitality. Some prefer to remain nameless; o ­ thers I anonymize due to the intensely po­liti­cal climate. In Lebanon I owe many thanks to Rabih Shibli, ix\n\nx\n\nAcknowl­e dgments\n\nwho helped me with networks and contacts. Special thanks go to Omar Tantawi and Omar El Maadarani for their time and connections, taking me to far-­flung areas of Lebanon and arranging interviews. My husband’s relatives, Samira and Rabih Dabbous, provided my second home while I was in Beirut. They made me feel welcome, helping whenever I needed anything or just taking me to dinner. In Jordan, Lillian Frost provided contacts, connecting me to May Shalabieh and ­others. May, in turn, introduced me to more p ­ eople and accompanied me to many research appointments. I benefited from her presence and friendship. Jumana Kawar conducted seed interviews and made connections for me during her trip to Jordan. My friends in Amman, Kolthoum Abdelhaq and her wonderful ­daughters, Sarah and Farah, provided my home-­away-­from-­home in Amman, complete with g­ reat meals, coffee, and companionship during all my trips to Jordan. I miss them whenever I return to the United States. Fi­nally, a debt goes to my husband, Amer Saleh, my d ­ aughter, Zahra, my f­ ather, Raymond Baylouny, and my late mother-­in-­law, Janan Saleh. They supported me continuously, taking over my f­ amily duties when I traveled or needed to write. I ­w ill miss the drunken conversations with my mother-­in-­law, who deserved an easier life than that of a refugee from Palestine, and who was ­later forced to leave her home in Kuwait along with so many o ­ thers. My ­daughter was patient and helpful while I was writing or away on research. Being away from her was the hardest part of fieldwork, and I am grateful for f­amily and friends who stepped in while I was away. My f­ather’s faith in me, his support, and his pride in my accomplishments have remained solid during my journey from gradu­ate school through ­today. My apologies to anyone I have forgotten to mention; it truly takes a community of scholars, friends, and f­ amily. All opinions expressed ­here are my own, and should not be interpreted as statements of official U.S. Navy, Department of Defense policy, or any other institutional affiliation.

The w ­ idow Um Sanad and her small ­family had been evicted, a direct result of the influx of Syrian refugees in Jordan. Um Sanad had been paying 75 Jordanian dinars (JD) a month for their apartment, around USD 100, for the previous nine years. Her landlord increased the rent by close to 70 ­percent, and the new cost would leave her with only JD 10 (USD 14) to live on per month. Hundreds of families ­were similarly threatened with eviction across Mafraq, as their rent increased by as much as 300 ­percent. Syrians ­were flooding across the border looking for shelter at this time in 2013, a condition that landlords exploited to charge far more rent. The situation pit son against ­father, ­brother against ­brother, and ultimately, Jordanian against Syrian. Abu Mohammad joined the growing protests against this injustice. His rent had tripled b ­ ecause of the Syrians. Unable to pay, he bought a tent and, together with some twenty families, took part in one of the first tent protests. T ­ hese Jordanians, made homeless in their own country due to refugees from neighboring Syria, set up their own camp, the Jordanian Displaced ­People’s Camp #1 (Mukhayyam an-­Naziheen al-­Urduniyyin, Raqm 1) in Mafraq. Their tents bore the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) logo, ironically having been purchased from Syrian refugees. The evicted families demanded that the authorities intervene and help them solve the prob­lem of high rents. Local and national Jordanian government officials called on the protesters to disband. The protesters responded with a threat to escalate the open-­ended protest to hunger strikes ­until their prob­lem was fixed. “We protesters responded to them that ­there 1\n\n2 Introduction\n\nis no way to stop the protest ­unless our demands are met. If the police interfere [to force them to disband], we w ­ ill go on a hunger strike, with no food or w ­ ater, and Mafraq city w ­ ill become a city of tents,” one or­ga­nizer said. T ­ hese protesting Jordanians ­were not historically part of opposition to the government. On the contrary, they formed the regime’s base of support. But they needed a solution. Their situation could not continue as it was, they declared.1 Half an hour down the road from Mafraq, Hamda Masaeed sat in her self-­made tent, timeworn and frayed. The seventy-­year-­old grand­mother watched as aid trucks and charities alike passed her ten-­member ­family by to deliver help across the road in Za’atari, the newly established Syrian refugee camp. A Jordanian citizen, Hamda envied the beautiful new tents of the Syrian refugees and lamented, “­Don’t they realize that we need help too?”2 Accounts of citizen suffering, presumably caused by the Syrian refugee influx, and the apparent neglect of local needs in ­favor of the refugees, caused im­mense resentment. By this time, two years into the Syrian war, t­ here was no love lost on the Syrian refugees. Large swaths of society in Lebanon and Jordan had become overtly hostile to the Syrians ­after their initial welcome. The Syrian presence in ­these countries was overwhelming. Syrian refugee numbers far surpassed anything seen in the West. Syrians formed an average of 10 ­percent of the population in Jordan from 2014 to 2018, and in Lebanon the numbers w ­ ere much higher: Syrians in Lebanon w ­ ere at least one quarter of the population.3 The sheer demographic impact of the Syrians overwhelmed institutions, ser­v ices, and infrastructure. P ­ eople of all social classes in both countries questioned what national identity meant. “What does it mean to be Jordanian when twenty p ­ ercent of your coun4 try is Syrian or Iraqi?” As an unpop­u­lar minority group, Syrian refugees seemingly made the perfect scapegoats.5 Scapegoats displace grievances against the state to an unpop­u­lar minority or immigrant group. ­These states tried at ­every turn to blame the Syrians for national prob­lems, no m ­ atter how long ­those issues preceded the Syrians’ arrival. In typical scapegoating fashion, state elites turned attention and hostility ­toward the Syrians. The state could have fixed electricity in Lebanon, but officials claimed the Syrians took five hours of power a day from h ­ ouse­holds. Similarly, authorities in Jordan stated that Syrians drained national ­water resources and used far more than nationals, who conserve this resource.6 ­These scapegoating discourses did not function as such tactics usually do. They did not divert attention from the state into anger at the minority or outsider group. Crucial daily needs w ­ ere affected by the demographic stress of the influx of Syrians, altering or threatening citizens’ lives. ­These needs called out for solutions, not merely blame against a group unable to fix their situation. It is this aspect that distinguishes Jordan and Lebanon from other cases of attempted scapegoat-\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\ning. Citizens ­were—­and are—­angry at Syrians, but such anger does nothing to provide ­water, waste removal, or electricity. Indeed, electricity, housing, ­water, and waste—­which have been long-­standing national prob­lems—­are some of the basic issues that spurred protests by Jordanians and Lebanese against their governments. Anger against the Syrians, and hatred in many cases, did not displace protests or demands directed at the government. In tent protests like the one above, Jordanian protesters blamed the Syrian refugees for their predicament, and many wanted the Syrians to leave. However, their demands focused on concrete redress from the state. Large signs in the tent protests declared the inhabitants’ patriotism and begged for housing from God and king.7 During the same period in Lebanon, Lebanese demonstrated, burned tires, and blocked roads to protest the prolonged lack of electricity in Baalbek, an area with one of the highest Syrian refugee populations. T ­ here was widespread popu­lar agreement that the ­Syrian refugees w ­ ere at fault in draining electricity from nationals. Officials accused the refugees of stealing electricity and of simply overwhelming the electrical grid’s capacity due to their large numbers. But instead of protests aimed at the Syrian refugees, the Lebanese attacked and targeted the Energy Ministry and other arms of the state, demanding more electricity.8 The arrival of the Syrian refugees stressed domestic fault lines, both calling attention to endemic prob­lems and triggering protests against the states for remedies. Many of ­these fault lines ­were a lack of basic, daily needs, some crucial to survival. Citizens responded with dual blame. They faulted the Syrians for causing the prob­lems but accused the states of responsibility for fixing t­ hose issues. Active protest, with a few exceptions, was focused on national and local state institutions and demanded solutions. When one Jordanian town ran out of w ­ ater, they blamed Syrians for taking from Jordan’s scarce national w ­ ater supply. International aid organ­izations w ­ ere providing ­water to the Syrian refugees, sometimes drawing from domestic supplies. No one seemed to consider Jordanian needs. Citizens’ priorities for w ­ ater ­were dramatically clear. The Jordanian protesters confronted their government—­and, quite surprisingly, the king himself—­with guns. “I have nothing to lose. If I ­don’t drink ­water, I ­will die,” a lead protester said.9 “It’s the Syrians’ fault,” one man in Jordan of Palestinian heritage told me. “But the government has to do something about it.”10 Aid money received on behalf of the Syrians only exacerbated the criticisms. Before the Syrians, “­People said the prob­lem was Lebanese. Then the politicians blamed the Syrians for all the waste and using infrastructure. But the politicians w ­ ere getting all this money for t­ hese prob­lems. So p ­ eople turned against the politicians. You say you are getting all this money and nothing is happening,” a Lebanese man said.11 “­There are just too many Syrians for the population of Lebanon. We have to be humanitarian t­ oward them—­but the state and the UN do not help enough,” another Lebanese said.12\n\n4 Introduction\n\nA Jordanian city council member described, “We had tent protests h ­ ere [northern Jordan, with a large refugee population] but not much anymore. They demanded help from the government, which is their right [as Jordanians] in the constitution, [the right] to work, to a h ­ ouse, and to health care.”13 A Lebanese UNICEF employee added, “In the back of their [Lebanese] minds they realize their government is failing. Sometimes they blame the Syrians, but more and more they realize this blame is used by the politicians for their own benefit.”14 Scapegoating historically has worked as intended, displacing anger away from the state. In the case of Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon, this tactic has failed. The difference h ­ ere is that the grievances concern resources fundamental to life. In such cases, solutions can outweigh scapegoating. Scapegoats are rarely in a position to provide w ­ ater, electricity, or housing, nor can they restructure a national waste system. In t­ hese cases, Jordanians and Lebanese ranked their basic needs over the psychological benefit of blame t­oward a presumed guilty group. The states’ use of scapegoating to exempt themselves from scrutiny and fault for deep structural prob­lems arguably backfired. Citizens in ­these refugee-­hosting countries agreed that the Syrians w ­ ere to blame, but levied responsibility to alleviate their grievances on the states. This book examines changes in the states hosting the Syrian refugees and the citizens’ relations to governance in t­ hese states.15 What we see is a broadening of citizen demands on the states amid state austerity policies, in the context of mass refugee influx and concomitant aid to the states and the refugees. Jordan and Lebanon are among the countries most demographically burdened with refugees in the world. In the m ­ iddle of one of the biggest refugee crises in the modern era, citizens have increasingly demanded and placed blame on their own states and, in some cases, international nongovernmental organ­izations (INGOs). While refugees are a humanitarian issue, they also generate a new structural situation for the host countries, presenting practical, social, and cultural challenges. Examining the direct effects of the refugees, in tandem with po­liti­cal mobilizing and oppositional changes, allows us to understand how the refugees’ presence has echoed through society, catalyzing grievances against the states. The resulting national changes in discourses and mobilizing ­will affect ­these countries long ­after the refugees have gone.\n\nThe Failure of Scapegoating Beginning in 2011, many Syrians fled on foot to neighboring states, like most refugees at the start of a war, mainly to Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan. While Turkey has a large economy, population, and territory, Jordan and Lebanon have ­little\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nto offer newcomers. T ­ hese fellow Arabic-­speaking countries originally greeted their cultural compatriots with open arms and aid, well before the international community began its humanitarian operations. Many citizens w ­ ere related to Syrians or shared other commonalities with the refugees. The bulk of the new refugees, like the Iraqi refugees before them, chose to ­settle among the population rather than in camps, even where camps ­were allowed. The warm welcome for ­these self-­settled or urban refugees quickly turned to animosity, however, as the numbers of Syrians substantially increased and economic circumstances in the countries worsened. During the time the Syrian refugees have been in Jordan and Lebanon, ­these states have experienced a range of resource and infrastructure prob­lems that seriously affect daily life. The fact that aid organ­izations ignored lower-­class citizens in areas of refugee concentration while doling out help to the refugees in their midst further fueled resentment against the refugees. Opinions turned sharply against the refugees, with residents accusing them of causing numerous trou­bles in ­these countries. The refugees have, or are perceived to have, stressed garbage collection, ­water, electricity, roads, education, real estate, consumer price inflation, and jobs. “We had big prob­lems already, then the Syrians came and increased them.”16 The condemnations include a range of social and economic issues: Syrians drive motorcycles that are noisy and disturb the neighbors; Syrian ­women act inappropriately in public (Jordan); Syrian men demonstrate lewd be­hav­ior ­toward ­women (Lebanon); Syrian refugees are taking local jobs ­because they work for less due to receiving international aid; Syrians get rich on aid while the country pays and goes into debt; Syrians increase crime; the refugees overuse and waste w ­ ater and electricity without a care, creating scarcities since they do not pay; and Syrians increase the amount of waste and litter indiscriminately, causing pollution. Syrians even purportedly spread disease and use up the available vaccines.17 “I feel for them, but d ­ on’t ask me to kill myself for o ­ thers,” one Lebanese said.18 ­These accusations betray clear cultural and class biases, and repeat ste­reo­types common of refugees in other regions as well.19 Po­liti­cal elites joined in on the blame, echoed by media and social media, scapegoating Syrians for the diverse ills of the states and their institutions. Such a discourse was expected, since ­these countries govern through identity divisions. Blame against an internal or external group is rampant. Sectarian war, much feared in Lebanon since the Syrians disrupted the existing precarious balance between the sects, has not occurred. Pervasive hostility ­toward the Syrians, however, dominates both states. Globally, right-­wing and anti-­immigrant movements, nativism and xenophobia, have risen with (perceived) large immigration flows. Scholars question w ­ hether the roots of such nationalist fervor lie with cultural fear or economic self-­interest, and their research tracks when the hostility is more or less profound, but they do not doubt the central dynamic of scapegoating. Historically,\n\n6 Introduction\n\nscapegoating works. Blaming a minority or unpop­ul­ ar group diverts attention from the state and from demands on it. Given the widespread animosity, why has scapegoating of Syrians failed? Why has it not generated support for the state, a rally around flag and country, and support for the politicians who wield this weapon? The question of who is blamed is intensely po­liti­cal and consequential for the ­future of po­liti­cal life. The object of popu­lar blame is fought over by po­liti­cal elites, the media, and social movements. Blame creates an opponent or villain to serve as the focus of protest, and as such is integral to protest success. Diffuse or unfocused protest soon fizzles out and fails. Specifying blame not only frames conceptions of the ­enemy but also reflects legacies of animosity and concepts of history and agency. Differences of opinion, interpretations of causation, narratives, emotions, memory, and personal bias all play roles in determining which stories of blame resonate with the population.20 Perception, often distinct from real­ity, heavi­ly influences the target of blame. Confusion, uncertainty, or disagreement on specifying fault is common, and provides space for passivity or scapegoating.21 Although ­people seek to externalize blame and rationalize their own inaction,22 ­there are times when psychological con­ve­nience falls before a practical real­ity. The nature of the grievances in Jordan and Lebanon explain the peculiar results, as citizens both faulted refugees and increased demands and expectations from their states. When the grievances that give rise to blame are experienced as threats to livelihood, ­people can prioritize solutions. Solutions can continue to be the focus of popu­lar demands even though elites promote psychological diversion into anger at an unpop­u­lar group. This is particularly true when the grievance is pivotal to daily life. The par­tic­u­lar attributes of grievances have long been recognized as affecting the ability, resonance, and duration of mobilizing in social movement studies. Workers’ rights, taxation, and the price of bread have been power­ful motivators of activism,23 and for good reason. Obtaining food, w ­ ater, and shelter is integral to survival, preceding concern over po­liti­cal repre­sen­ta­tion and even rights. Grievances that stand out as threats to livelihood increase the chances of activism. Psychologically, threats can be more motivating than opportunities, which have been central to the study of collective action, since p ­ eople value what they have more than what they desire but do not yet have.24 Abrupt scarcity or loss of goods that are integral to society’s daily norms, its taken-­for-­granted routines, is one such threat. This has been called “disruption of the quotidian” or disturbances to daily life.25 The par­tic­u­lar resources or ser­v ices at issue are impor­tant: They must be meaningful to shake up the stability of ordinary existence.26 In such crisis situations, p ­ eople’s minds shift into action mode and collective organ­izing is quicker than in normal times. Community solidarity can rise rapidly in response, mobilizing latent networks. Grievances in t­ hese cases are more swiftly and simply recognized than long-­term, gradual changes, and protest discourses arise\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nseemingly without elite framing. The resulting protest events or movements of crisis may be more violent and less formally or­ga­nized than organ­izing for po­ liti­cal rights.27 Austerity is one instance of a crisis that can threaten livelihood.28 Past austerity crises have shown that mobilizing from crisis and threat can open the door to wider critiques of the system and status quo, in a pro­cess similar to developing oppositional consciousness.29\n\nFocus on the State Crises in basic livelihood goods call out for remedies, even if ­people si­mul­ta­neously believe that a blamed group is at fault. The ancient ritual that spawned the term “scapegoating” entailed not only transferring blame, guilt, and sins from individuals in the community onto another body but also eliminating t­hose prob­ lems. The goat escaped or was driven out, taking the troublesome issues as well. The modern usage of the term has lost this second component of solving prob­ lems, but it is similar relief that Jordanians and Lebanese seek. Blame is twofold, consisting of causal fault and responsibility to fix or prevent the situation. Both the immediate perpetrator and the more power­ful institution or person(s) responsible for protecting society from the results can be blamed. As solutions have been found for many prob­lems previously considered immutable, governance and regulatory bodies have been held increasingly responsible.30 What ­were formerly considered acts of god(s) or m ­ other nature, such as diseases and damaging weather, are now attributed to institutions that should have foreseen, contained, or fixed the prob­lem. Environmental movements protest the state and its regulatory bodies, even when other p ­ eople, companies, and institutions created the issues, or when the cause is unknown. Food safety is the responsibility of the state, not individual food producers. Disease control is laid at the feet of state institutions, although the cause may be unclear. While the existence of evildoers can seem inevitable, the authorities charged with protecting society against them are held particularly liable when they are perceived as being careless in t­ hose duties. The 9/11 ­widows accused the intelligence and justice communities of negligence that made them culpable and expected them to be held to account, in addition to the perpetrators of the 9/11 vio­lence.31 Where do ­people look for remedies? Identifying the responsible body to resolve prob­lems involves institutional authority, history, and popu­lar ideas of ability. The institution or person making decisions and formally charged with fixing a prob­lem is often the focal point of blame and protest demands. In a world structured around nation-­states, the target of responsibility is frequently the state and its institutions. With jurisdiction over justice and security, the state is the embodiment\n\n8 Introduction\n\nof the collective, entailing the necessary ­legal and punitive mechanisms to implement and enforce resolutions upon society as a ­whole. In Jordan and Lebanon, the state has been popularly held responsible for negative outcomes, both pre-­ existing and ­those believed to be caused by the refugees, despite the differing capacities of the two states. ­These states have been critiqued for not fulfilling their duties, ignoring prob­lems, and failing to protect the public from the negative effects of the refugees. State institutions in Jordan and Lebanon are not bureaucratically in­de­pen­dent. Governing institutions are subject to the general elite power structure, a rotation of the same ­faces and families between diverse positions from election to election. ­These intense linkages have generated a confluence between the terms “state,” “regime,” and “governance,” lumped into the general designation of the state, or dawla, and that broad state is held responsible for the failure of its constituent institutions. The Jordanian state has been a power­ful actor in the daily lives of citizens, and few effective alternatives to state and local authorities exist for infrastructure and resources. The turn of Lebanese ­toward their state is more surprising, as analysts have long demonstrated the in­effec­tive­ness of the Lebanese state contrasted with the power and in­de­pen­dence of civil society. Like Jordan, social ser­v ices and welfare in Lebanon have been in the hands of civil society, along with po­liti­cal, and kin, groups.32 The legacy of the civil war furthered this trend in Lebanon, as the country was split into mini-­states performing statelike roles. Hizbollah alone maintained such ser­v ices ­after the war. Still, the lack of existing state ser­v ices should not be conflated with citizen satisfaction with this state of affairs. Scholars have now successfully questioned stock notions of the Lebanese state’s irrelevance and of citizens’ ac­cep­tance of its absence.33 In their place, a more complex idea of the state and attitudes ­toward governance emerges. Idealized concepts of the state coexist with skepticism t­oward it. A dual attitude t­oward the Lebanese state prevails, one an assessment of the current lack of state ser­v ices, and the other a vision of what ­people wish the state ­were.34 Lebanese have an ideal of the state in their minds, however rough and imprecise, that becomes apparent in the frustrated daily complaints of Lebanese and routine comparisons of their state with states in the West. “This would not happen in the United States or Eu­ rope,” p ­ eople say. The common phrase “ma fi dawla” (­there is no state) is a lamented fact, not a desirable outcome. The Lebanese state does provide aid and ser­vices, often through the mechanism of sectarianism, discussed further in chapter 1. Electricity and ­water are provided by Lebanese state institutions on a national basis. Waste pro­cessing is decentralized outside Beirut, but funding for it comes mainly from the national state. Such ser­v ices are considered to be in the realm of state duties even when the state does not supply them well, as the protests discussed in this book attest.35\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nHumanitarianism and the State The presence of Syrian refugees in ­these countries has increased the centrality of the state and local authorities and the popu­lar idea that the state is—or should be—­the relevant actor in fixing prob­lems. In Jordan the state has taken the lead dealing with the refugees, while Lebanon initially allowed municipalities to act in its stead. Both levels of governance interact with donors and INGOs, and both receive the brunt of citizen demands and grievances in t­ hese countries. As time has gone on, the Lebanese state has taken a larger role in receiving this international donor money, passing it through state institutions and to citizens, developmental proj­ects, or the refugees. With refugees comes an intricate infrastructure of humanitarian aid. In camps, UN agencies provide for refugees’ needs, leading to questions of sovereignty and ­whether UN provision decreases the purview and reach of the state. Aid routinely leaks out to surrounding areas, ­either in the form of goods or trade. When refugees reside outside camps, as the Syrians and o ­ thers do currently, aid is given to the host states themselves in addition to the refugees directly. Resources provided to the states essentially pay for refugees’ use of public goods and ser­v ices. This pre­sents opportunities for both host states and citizens. Humanitarian organ­ izations can serve as an alternative form of governance for citizens to rely on. States also turn to them, finding they can obtain financing for their own proj­ects, basically subcontracting state ser­v ices to the aid organ­ization. States attempt to direct aid to citizens in the guise of development assistance. For the states, this appears to be a win-­win scenario, as they can continue to blame the refugees for all the ills of the state while taking credit for humanitarian aid. The dynamics of the international humanitarian system have provided incentives for the Lebanese and Jordanian states to emphasize their centrality in citizens’ lives, inadvertently promoting themselves as objects of demands for solutions in the pro­cess. A ­ fter initially sidelining itself and being marginalized by international donors, the Lebanese state in 2014 began actively negotiating with the international community on behalf of its citizens. The states argued internationally that their p ­ eople suffered due to the refugees, and they pleaded for aid money on ­these grounds. Jordan and Lebanon willingly interjected themselves between the international community’s money and their own citizens. Massive amounts of aid and loans went to the states, accompanied by public statements to that effect, well covered in the press, by international NGOs and the humanitarian community. Weak though it may be, the Lebanese state has been the crucial intermediary between international aid money and the Lebanese ­people. In countless conferences and meetings with humanitarian organ­izations and donors, the state is the sole accepted representative of the country. The necessity of a\n\n10 Introduction\n\nnational government was put in stark relief when Lebanese representatives failed to form a government for nine months a­ fter their election in 2018, leaving billions in aid money stalled, much of it intended to alleviate failures in essential ser­v ices. Elite failure reinforced popu­lar perception of the state’s critical role in daily life, and the vulnerability of that life to state inefficiency, incapacity, and corruption. Refugee host states with l­ ittle capacity increase in importance not only through their role as intermediaries to global aid provisioning but also through the common desire of citizens to differentiate themselves from the refugees. Indeed, ideological attachment to the state can increase as citizens draw upon myths and ideas of themselves and their state in an effort to avoid association with the morally flawed refugees.36 The prevalent boundary making of citizens versus refugees makes the state the referent and responsible party for citizens within the nation-­ state construct. The humanitarian community plays a role ­here also, helping to generate this identity distinction and reinforce a par­tic­ul­ ar notion of state-­citizen relations. Concepts of national identity have been brought to the fore through mundane pro­cesses. In the practical course of aiding refugees and requesting aid money, INGOs and think tanks have produced statistical reports comparing the status of the refugee population with that of the average host citizen. This distinction and the term “citizen” have been repeated domestically, highlighting both an ideal relationship between citizens of host countries and their states, and a similarly idealized sharp delineation between refugees and t­hose citizens. Humanitarian organ­izations have speculated on potential conflict in host-­refugee relations and documented ­actual vio­lence. The societal rumor mill has not been the only actor circulating stories about refugees. INGO reports have detailed child l­abor, prostitution, debt, and other negative coping strategies used by Syrians to survive.37 To the international community, t­ hese reports have demonstrated the need for more funding. For host citizens, t­ hese stories have generated added impetus to distance themselves from this population, who act contrary to their own societal norms. NGO actions have helped to increase citizen expectations. Through both the international community and the states, the refugees have received ser­v ices that ­these states have not provided, or have provided badly, to their own citizens. T ­ hese states have long pushed ser­vices and public goods outside formal state institutions, through kin networks or po­liti­cal parties. The provision of public goods to refugees, whose noncitizen status has continually and routinely been affirmed, contrasts with the inadequacy of such goods and ser­v ices for nationals. Refugees receiving public goods deviates from the understood arrangement by which the states do not provide public goods to the populace, while kin groups and po­liti­ cal parties subsidize public goods for themselves as club goods. “Maybe the UN\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nthinks that the Lebanese state gives to Lebanese, like Eu­rope, but it d ­ oesn’t. This area is deprived [hirman]. All we are asking for is the same as the Syrians get,” a group of female teachers in the Lebanese north told me. “Syrians get treated in the hospital without insurance. But if Lebanese do not have insurance, they are left to die.”38 Some citizens do receive significant benefits from the state—­East Banker Jordanians have come to expect a decent livelihood in state employment and subsidy support. But economic reforms and hard times diminish the value of this aid. The well-­publicized money flowing into the states from aid organ­ izations puts the lie to the idea that lack of funds blocks solutions to fundamental infrastructure and ser­v ice prob­lems. Simply put, citizens have begun to expect the same or better than the refugees receive. The presence of the Syrian refugees, together with the actions of the international community, has amplified historic grievances and created new expectations of governance. Ser­v ices provided to the refugees, along with the large resources given or loaned to states ostensibly to mitigate the negative effects on citizens, have altered expectations. Instead of focusing on the exclusion of the Syrians from domestic public goods, citizens emphasize their right to be included in an expanded version of state ser­v ices. “Lots of money is coming in ­because of the Syrians—­where does that money go? Government pockets.”39 The prior acceptable level of ser­v ices has become unacceptable. That ­others who are not nationals are receiving public goods, ser­vices that the states have not provided, has generated an awareness that the state can indeed provide ­these goods and ser­v ices but is not ­doing so.\n\nFrom Crisis Protests to Large-­S cale Mobilizing Initial mobilizing targeting the state consisted of crisis protests for goods perceived to have been affected by the demographic weight of the Syrians, particularly ­water, electricity, housing, trash, and jobs. ­These ­were fundamental prob­lems, hindering the normal daily life of average ­people. The mobilizing that resulted from ­these felt threats followed expected patterns of protests against serious disruptions of daily life. The protests w ­ ere not movements, but a series of collective actions that ­were little-­planned, hastily or­ga­nized, involved only the community immediately affected, and ­were sometimes violent. ­These crisis protests produced varying results, depending on the country. Jordan and Lebanon differ not only by the specific resources and fault lines that have been demographically strained by the Syrians, as would be expected between any two states, but also by the very dif­fer­ent capacities, presence, and responsiveness of the states. In Jordan, demands from\n\n12 Introduction\n\nregime supporters in areas of high refugee concentration ­were quickly answered. The Jordanian monarchy cut through bureaucratic regulations and ministerial jurisdiction b ­ attles to effectively prioritize and channel international and national aid to t­ hese areas. When ­water was viewed as a prob­lem, the regime gave absolute discretion in this field to one body, with unilateral decision-­making power.40 Many crisis grievances ­were eliminated. In Lebanon, crisis mobilizing continued as needs remained unmet and the government’s main answer was to stall, ignore, and repress protesters. Lebanese ruling elites have been severely lacking in their ability and willingness to mount a coherent and effective solution to basic societal deficiencies. Protests did not stop at demands over fundamental livelihood goods. Catalyzed by the Syrian demographic influx and its humanitarian response, crisis mobilizing launched thorough critiques of the regimes. In effect, the Syrians shined a spotlight on the under­lying state failures generating ­these crises, opening opportunities to condemn the state. State elites, for their part, continued to deflect blame away from themselves and the state. Yet the populaces seemed to see through the attempts to scapegoat to proceed and indict the state itself. The example of aid to Syrians combined with the experience of daily scarcity for citizens resulted in increased senses of entitlement and expectations of their states. Citizens overtly compared the ser­v ices and goods Syrians receive to ­those they historically have not received. The provision of ser­v ices and benefits to the Syrians demonstrated the possibility of receiving public goods, contradicting long-­standing state legacies of foisting the responsibility for ser­v ices off onto society. By virtue of membership in the nation, citizens argued, they should have equal or better ser­v ices than ­those foreigners receive. Governance was now denounced for failing to provide public goods not formerly within the purview of state ser­v ices but that the citizens saw Syrian refugees receive. The historic lack of public ser­v ices and concomitant legacy of low expectations in ­these states makes this outcome particularly surprising. The varied demands and grievances, all implicating state incapacity, began to link together into movements. The grievances w ­ ere tied plausibly, if not directly, to the presence of the refugees. Movements indicted the state for failing to protect citizens against the negative effects of the refugee crisis. Crisis grievances, combined with increased expectations and ideas of rights, coalesced into larger or­ga­ nized movements. In Lebanon, the trigger was primary goods and ser­v ices that remained inadequate, even years into the Syrian crisis. The YouStink movement from the Lebanese trash crisis provided a physical manifestation of state failure, combining numerous demands around fundamental goods and ser­v ices. This movement was a major development in nonsectarian mobilizing in Lebanon, as refuse piling up in public places escalated the felt need to act collectively and\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nbroadened societal participation. Protests continued to target the state as the relevant power­ful actor, demanding improved governance, despite the lack of response in the Lebanese case. Through ­these protests and the par­tic­u­lar grievances, we can see local ideals of good governance, concepts of economic and social rights, and how citizens want their state to be distinct from how that state has acted in the past. The states then increased their extraction from the populace, in an effort to placate international actors and obtain loans for the purpose of coping with the Syrian crisis. The resulting increased taxation and decreased subsidies spurred broad popu­lar opposition movements in both countries. Syrians would not pay income tax, and therefore citizens felt they ­were suffering for a crisis they did not create. They protested against the removal of subsidies, although the states attributed the inability to continue such financial support to the Syrians’ high consumption of subsidized goods increasing state expenses. But instead of focusing exclusively on the Syrians, citizens blamed the poor management and corrupt practices of the states. Crisis mobilizing occurred both through larger movements and on an individual basis. Jordanians walked to the capital from the farthest reaches of the state for jobs.41 Jobs w ­ ere a key demand in both countries, and unemployment was perceived as being exacerbated by the Syrians. Lebanese continue to protest despite promises of aid, and their grievances about basic goods have yet to be solved. The unity of demands in t­ hese movements, cutting across po­liti­cal divisions, demonstrates an impor­tant escalation of mobilizing against the states. A ­ fter long accepting the monarchy as untouchable and the sectarian clientelist system as unchangeable, Jordanians and Lebanese, respectively, have begun directly implicating ­these systems in the deficiencies exacerbated by the Syrian refugees. Innovative as this demand making is, large movements are difficult to sustain in ­these countries, and they face an uphill ­battle. Jordan and Lebanon have lengthy histories of divisive identity politics. In Jordan, the historical divide between East Bankers and citizens of Palestinian descent has long hampered large-­scale mobilization. Lebanon has numerous divisions, each one or­ga­nized with po­liti­cal parties providing preferential goods and ser­v ices to constituents. Both countries suffer from regional divides between the capital and rural areas, with the capital providing jobs and ser­v ices superior to ­those available in the neglected rural areas. ­These geo­graph­ic­ al divisions overlap with ­those of po­liti­cal party and identity. This research suggests that successful scapegoating is sometimes a dynamic of privilege and not of need. The attempts of state elites to blame a powerless group can backfire, as citizens reject this suggested blame and direct responsibility at the states themselves. The demographic weight of the refugees pushed enduring weaknesses into daily life threats. Syrians have ratcheted up the inability of citizens to live with existing prob­lems, but the Syrians are incapable of solving ­these\n\n14 Introduction\n\nissues. As a result, instead of stopping at animosity t­ oward the foreigner, Jordanians and Lebanese, particularly in the poorer, less-­served areas most affected by the refugees, began demanding governance solutions to fix economic, resource, and infrastructure faults. Social movements and change, however, are not inevitable. The key insights of social movement theory remain: Grievances alone are not sufficient to generate protest. Other social, orga­nizational, cultural, and po­ liti­cal ­factors are impor­tant. Among other variables, sustained mobilization takes resources, orga­nizational strength, focus, and leadership. Understanding how the presence of refugees alters long-­term politics in the host countries is central to analyzing the f­ uture of countries affected by mass migration. Few would argue that the Palestinian refugees in the Arab countries had no effect on their hosts. Most scholars concentrate on the military threat that the Palestinians generated. Only in detailed studies do we usually find accounts of changing opposition dynamics that include the hosts, or the secondary effects of the Palestinian presence, such as challenging local conceptions of governance. ­There is a reason why Palestinians are kept separate from locals in the Gulf States, and this fear has nothing to do with security concerns. Palestinians and foreigners in general have ideas that have been viewed by ruling regimes as threats to their culture, economy, and ways of life.42 This is similar to the view of refugees in other regions.43 Such influences can alter local dynamics, fostering ideas of citizenship and rights that the host regimes wish to avoid.\n\nMethod This book generates theory through empirically delineating the results of hosting refugees on citizen grievances, demands, and mobilizing. I use an effects-­of-­causes method.44 Presenting a big picture analy­sis provides insight into dynamics and cause-­and-­effect relationships more commonly viewed from a historical distance. By focusing on popu­lar mobilizing and demands and their effects on po­liti­cal life, I challenge state-­centric approaches that relegate the grassroots to a po­liti­cally irrelevant afterthought. This analy­sis is all the more pressing as forced migration is forecasted to increase in the f­uture. Identifying the r­ ipple effects of refugees thus becomes imperative to understanding long-­term changes in our world. I utilize a multimethod approach, combining primary with specialized secondary works. The substantive data comes from fieldwork in Lebanon and Jordan, consisting of numerous yearly trips from 2015 to the pre­sent, and more than one hundred open-­ended interviews with elites and citizens in refugee areas and less-­ affected areas, and with aid workers and scholars.45 I particularly used local reports and interviews in areas where many researchers never set foot. I used snow-\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nball interviewing along several dif­ fer­ ent connection networks per country, ensuring a more diverse array of interviewees. Interviews w ­ ere mostly in local Arabic dialects, translated by myself. When necessary, I verified my interpretation of news reports or interviews with locals. I gave wide latitude for interviewees to talk, and, ­after asking a few basic questions about general changes over recent years, I let them speak about their concerns and perceptions. My long history of fieldwork in ­these countries (since 1998) and many local connections facilitated interviews, access, and trust. Local interpretations and sources ­were key for understanding motivation, and I have erred on the side of caution in guarding the anonymity of interviewees to protect them. ­Doing research in countries where freedom of speech is not s­ imple, or the realm of designated national security issues is broadly and po­liti­cally drawn, is never straightforward.46 The Syrian refugees have been deemed a national security topic, and writing on their effects is heavy with po­liti­cal implications. Data and access can be challenging. Media often do not report events and substantiating accounts of protest can be difficult. Jordan’s media are subject to significant restrictions. Protests threatening to the government, such as t­ hose involving its key constituencies, are often not reported. Observations by elites and international humanitarian organ­izations that work in some of the locations where the impact of the refugees is felt most provided data in some cases, functioning as media reports do in other countries. From news reports or secondary data I have included only t­hose protests that could be substantiated and that point to grievances popularly understood as being affected by the Syrians.\n\nMap of the Book This book focuses on the effects of the refugees on host countries, particularly the second-­order or indirect effects.47 The perceived demographic effect of the refugees has shone a spotlight on the endemic prob­lems in ­these states, bringing ­these topics to the fore for debate as never before. The presumed and real effects of the Syrians have resulted in demands for solutions instead of citizens being satisfied with blaming the refugees. Animosity and near-­universal blame of the Syrians did result, as a variety of negative social and economic situations has been attributed to the refugees. This animosity, however, has failed to deflect attention from the root ­causes of prob­lems or from seeking solutions to livelihood issues. Such scapegoating has not succeeded ­because the issues at hand are critical to normal, daily life, and the Syrians have been incapable of fixing such prob­lems. Likewise, the aid complex accompanying the refugees removed the timeworn excuse that lack of funds accounts for states’ infrastructural incapacity. The influx\n\n16 Introduction\n\nof massive international aid monies intended to offset the negative consequences of the refugees w ­ ere highly publicized. When positive changes did not occur as a result of t­ hese monies, charges of state and elite corruption increased. The continuation of core citizen grievances amid large amounts of aid was now explained by corruption. Indeed, aid merely amplified the public’s perception of elite corruption. Charges of injustice resulted when the Syrians received superior ser­v ices to ­those received by citizens. Citizens contrasted the assumed generous ser­v ices to refugees—­including ­free health care in Lebanon’s case—­with the historic lack and recent decline of public ser­v ices in their own states. The disparity between the ser­v ices provided to foreigners and citizens ­v iolated the traditional concept that citizens should be prioritized within their own nation-­states. ­These causal variables generated mobilization among populaces to protest lack of ser­v ices and grievances about injustice. Movements first or­ga­nized along immediate crisis needs and then became increasingly formalized. As ­these ­causes multiplied, groups recognized similarities between their diverse grievances and placed them ­under an umbrella of state incapacity and unresponsiveness, and elite corruption. Movements then joined together smaller groups, encompassed their grievances, and began organ­izing u ­ nder national catch-­all concepts. I begin in chapter 1 by providing impor­tant background information for nonspecialists on each country’s lack of capacity. This chapter summarizes the history and context for refugees and the systemic state prob­lems in both countries. I summarize their relevant histories of ruling through divisions, discuss how the Palestinian and Iraqi refugees affected them, and analyze the state of popu­lar oppositions at the time of the Syrian refugee crisis. Chapter 2 pre­sents each state’s refugee policies at the start of the Syrian exodus and state l­ egal obligations ­under international treaties. I analyze the effects of the refugees on the countries in the context of past incapacities. I begin by presenting conclusions from the refugee lit­er­a­ture about the effects of forced migration, including the relevant variables. I then examine the numerous changes in rent, jobs, inflation, the public ser­v ices of health care, education, and waste removal, and resource provisions of electricity and ­water, using available data. I discuss disputes about ­these data and detail the benefits that accrued to some citizens as a result of the presence of the Syrians and international organ­izations. The immediate outcome of ­these effects was hostility ­toward the Syrians, which I discuss in chapter 3. Sentiment in both Jordan and Lebanon went from sympathy ­toward ­these victims of war to active resentment. Populaces felt threatened demographically, and they questioned why the Syrians received superior goods and ser­v ices to themselves. They blamed their economic and resource prob­lems on the Syrians in narratives that echo common refugee and mi­grant ste­reo­types globally. Yet popu­lar demands w ­ ere also focused on the states. In chapter 4 I dem-\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nonstrate how, far from pacifying the populace by deflecting blame, grievances against the Syrians caused citizens to turn to their states for solutions. Citizens mobilized in protest for rent, w ­ ater, and employment in Jordan, and for electricity, waste disposal, and wages in Lebanon, despite state actions that normally dampen activism. States both scapegoated the Syrians and promoted fear that protest would spread the chaos of the Syrian war. Still, expectations of the states changed or ­were activated into protest. In response, Jordan and Lebanon changed their policies t­oward the Syrians, becoming more restrictive and increasing their overt scapegoating of the refugees. I look at t­ hese policy changes in chapter 5. Restrictive policies t­ oward Syrians w ­ ere interpreted by aid and international donors as signaling the need for more aid, in part to prevent Syrians from leaving t­ hese host countries and heading onward to Eu­rope. As a result, the London Compacts traded massive aid, market access, and preferential loans from the international community in return for work permits to the refugees. To continue receiving ­these loans and aid, and to balance a bud­get presumably affected by the Syrians, the states made fiscal changes that generated more protests. Protests for basic goods continued in Lebanon, and in both countries the new austerity policies spurred mass protests over taxes, the removal of subsidies, and the numerous continuing grievances over basic goods and ser­vices. T ­ hese protests turned into systemic indictments of the regimes. Protesters ­were not appeased by small po­liti­cal changes and remained skeptical of politicians’ promises. ­These protests represented a wide swathe of the populations, joining po­liti­cal parties and po­liti­cally separate groups into single movements. The conclusion summarizes the argument and the practical implications of ­these findings for ­future movements ­toward good governance in ­these countries. I detail the types of protest that occurred in Jordan and Lebanon. I further examine the differential outcomes in aid effectiveness and movements in Jordan and Lebanon, and the dynamics of humanitarian aid on state sovereignty. The state has become more central in both counties, while specific ser­v ices are subcontracted. Massive aid and loans, intended to alleviate pressure on refugee-­hosting states and thereby help both refugees and citizens, appear to have triggered more protests while also not helping the refugees. Despite t­ hese im­mense resources, Syrians are still ­dying for want of a blanket and heat.\n\n1 BEFORE THE SYRIAN CRISIS\n\nAs the Syrian refugees fled from their warring country, they entered neighboring countries that ­were already unable to provide adequate infrastructure and ser­ vices to their existing populations. Populations in ­these countries regularly turned to the private sector to provide the social ser­vices the central state could not. Further, the Syrians ­were not the first refugees to arrive in Jordan and Lebanon; some ­earlier refugee groups had settled without negative po­liti­cal repercussions, while ­others caused large changes in national politics and disruptions in security. Citizens w ­ ere well aware of their countries’ deficiencies, and had sporadically mobilized for changes. Mobilization was in­effec­tive, however, due to the regimes’ use of po­liti­cal divisions and history of scapegoating to blame unpop­u­lar groups. Prior to receiving the Syrians, the Lebanese had absorbed the Armenians, refused to incorporate most Palestinians, dealt with their own domestic population movements due to a civil war, and coped with some Iraqis. Jordan had incorporated most of the Palestinians, and complained repeatedly, first about the burden of hosting ­those Palestinians, then about the returning Palestinians from the first Gulf War, and fi­nally about the Iraqis who fled in the 1990s and 2000s. The Armenians had come to Lebanon (and Syria) early in the 1900s, fleeing Turkey in large numbers. This dif­fer­ent ethnic, religious, and linguistic group has coexisted peacefully since that time and remains in Lebanon. ­After in­de­pen­dence, Jordan and Lebanon experienced two main groups of refugees prior to the Syrians: the Palestinians arrived in 1948 and 1967, and the Iraqis in the 1990s and beginning again around 2006. The result with the Palestinians was far from peaceful, and their presence affected the trajectories of both countries. ­Later, two waves of gen18\n\nBefore the Syrian Crisis\n\n19\n\nerally unarmed Iraqis went to both countries, more to Jordan than Lebanon. At the same time, Lebanon had been dealing with its own ongoing displacement crisis from the long civil war that ended in 1990. Lebanese w ­ ere displaced throughout the country as they sought safety from active vio­lence and threats from diverse sectarian militias. All this historical background informs the reception of the Syrians and locals’ interpretations of their effects. In addition to hosting refugees, both states grapple with domestic opposition movements. U ­ ntil recently ­those oppositions did not attract enough of the population to constitute regime threats. Even the era of the Arab Uprisings was tame in t­ hese states. T ­ hese uprisings ­were small but secular in Lebanon, and short-­lived and reformist in Jordan. In this chapter I review ­these countries’ history with refugees and mobilizing prior to the arrival of the Syrians. I also review the status of the state as a referent for social demands, and its ability to respond to t­ hose demands in both countries.\n\nThe States and Infrastructure Prob­l ems Jordan and Lebanon each host more Syrian refugees per citizen than any other countries. The two states have diverse capacities and regimes and differ in significant ways. Jordan is an electoral monarchy (monarchy with elections for parliament), while Lebanon is a consociational democracy (based on power-­sharing among dif­fer­ent religious groups). Jordan has centralized effective power, and some state institutions are capable, but the country lives by foreign aid. Lebanon’s numerous and competing actors make centralized governance difficult. Its institutions are understaffed, underfinanced, cumbersome to negotiate, and generally dysfunctional. Its foreign alliances are split between the dif­fer­ent domestic factions. The similarities between the two countries are more striking for this book’s purposes. Neither state has been able to fully employ its population or effectively provide basic ser­vices for citizens, and their economies merely hobble along. State corruption is a prob­lem in both. Lebanon’s rating on Transparency International’s corruption index puts it near the bottom (143 out of 180).1 Jordan’s ranking on the same list is significantly better (59 out of 180), but the country has had some recent highly publicized scandals implicating members of the royal ­family. Public perception of corruption thus differs from that ranking. Corruption and the embezzlement of funds by po­liti­cal elites has been a hot topic for the last few years in both countries. Using identity and po­liti­cal divisions to rule and to distract the populace from effective regime criticism has been a way of life for po­liti­cal elites in Jordan and Lebanon. Divisions are po­liti­cal and sectarian in Lebanon, but based on ethnic or national origin in Jordan. Jordan’s po­liti­cal use of the Jordanian-­Palestinian distinction runs deep. The states have made a business of attributing systemic prob­lems\n\n20 CHAPTER 1\n\nto other groups: Palestinians, Israelis, Iraqis, jihadis, Ba’athists, Communists, and now Syrians have all been blamed for domestic trou­bles. Both states have used social groups as the basis for the provision of impor­tant welfare ser­v ices to their populations. For both clientelism is instrumental in accessing a higher quantity or quality of welfare and social ser­v ices, but the basis for clientelism varies between the two. In Jordan kinship and tribe are the operative calling cards for help, while in Lebanon sect or religious institutions and po­ liti­cal party serve as the entrée to state ser­v ices. Connections (wasta), or patronage, are used for state ser­v ices and employment, particularly employment with the state, which is central to the economies of both countries. State employment provides access to privileged goods and health insurance. In Lebanon, ser­v ices increase during elections and po­liti­cal campaigns.2 Along with the prevalence of clientelism, in each country the same elite families and individuals tend to continually hold power. This has led to a popu­lar confluence of the terms “state,” “regime,” and “government,” since they are constituted by the same individuals and families. Furthering this confusion, Jordan’s king has used the shifting or replacing of government figures to ameliorate popu­lar anger. The public sector in Jordan is about double the size that it is in Lebanon.3 Jordanians’ relationship to the state is more obvious than that of the Lebanese, since the state is higher in capacity and more united, being ­under a single ultimate ruler. Yet Lebanese are no less dependent on the state, particularly in the ­middle and lower classes. Lebanon’s public sector is impor­tant socially for the benefits it provides, especially to public employees, notably in the security ser­v ices and teaching professions.4 The Lebanese state is an everyday inevitability, from the most vis­i­ble security ser­v ices (the military fighting extremists dominates the news) to the ­water and electric bills ­people must pay. This ordinary occurrence of the state has been missed by scholars, due to the power of nonstate actors and the incompetence of public ser­v ices. In fact, numerous state institutions provide aid in Lebanon, albeit through the medium of sectarianism. Lebanon provides aid through the Council for the South (mainly for electricity), the Ministry of the Displaced (from the Lebanese civil war), the High Relief Committee (which coordinates NGOs and public aid agencies), the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Public Health, among ­others. The Ministry of Public Health subcontracts with NGOs in addition to providing its own ser­v ices, aiding citizens with health bills. The Social Development Ministry and the Ministry of Public Health mainly operate through subcontracts with NGOs and state Development Ser­vice Centers. About 60 ­percent of the Ministry of Social Affairs’ yearly bud­get of $60 million went to NGO contracts.5 A new generation of scholars, not focused on the Lebanese civil war (1975–1990), when the state was neglected as barely an afterthought, have begun to examine Lebanese concepts of and relations to their\n\nBefore the Syrian Crisis\n\n21\n\nstate.6 The omnipresence of sectarianism, on close examination, is shown to work partly through the state.7 Everyday life is filled with state encounters: obtaining documents and permits, and dealing with security ser­v ices (police, General Security, and for the numerous roadblocks, military). Maintaining food security is another expectation of the Lebanese state, some have argued.8 ­These countries have long-­standing infrastructure prob­lems that complicate the provision of basic goods: mainly w ­ ater in Jordan and electricity in Lebanon. Electricity prob­lems in Lebanon, in part a legacy of the civil war, are so bad that anyone able to afford it has a private generator, or more often a subscription to one.9 At regular intervals the state electricity shuts off and generators take over, so smoothly that in richer areas the changeover is barely noticeable. Signs in h ­ otel elevators state the precise times when electricity ­will shut down and inform riders to expect only a momentary delay in elevator ser­vice.10 Still, the responsibility of electricity provision is clearly associated with the state. The coming and ­going of electricity is described as “the arrival of the state” and the “exit of the state,” respectively.11 Lebanon’s unsafe tap w ­ ater forces h ­ ouse­holds to purchase their own ­water, imposing an added expense. Garbage collection is a prob­lem, and landfills have turned into “mountains of trash” ( jibal al-­zibaleh) scattered throughout the country. Roads are not maintained, and potholes can be five feet wide.12 Strong regional disparities characterize both economies, with most economic activities and ser­v ices concentrated in the capital cities. Life outside Amman and Beirut, where ­there are few ser­v ices and jobs, differs significantly from life within the cities. Both countries’ economies are dominated by ser­v ices and remittances (and international aid in the case of Jordan), and both countries have few resources and more ­people than they can employ. A large percentage of workers are self-­ employed or in informal work.13 The countries’ economies have not fared well, according to macro indicators, ­either. Lebanon in 2010 had 27 ­percent poverty, using their own poverty line, in a population of five million.14 In Jordan’s population of more than six million p ­ eople, 14.4 ­percent ­were poor in the same year.15 Lebanon’s unemployment rate before the Syrian war was 6.4 ­percent, while Jordan’s in 2011 was 13 ­percent, conservatively.16 Both governments are in debt. Jordan owed about 70 ­percent of its GDP, while Lebanon had to repay about 130 ­percent of its GDP when Syria’s civil war began.17 Jordan is dependent on aid and remittances, and Lebanon relies heavi­ly on remittances.\n\nHistorical Experiences with Refugees Jordan’s and Lebanon’s histories with refugees differ, and each country’s policy varies by the specific refugee population.18 The countries felt the impact of Palestinian\n\n22 CHAPTER 1\n\nrefugees most heavi­ly. Between 900,000 and 1 million Palestinians became refugees with the founding of Israel and settled primarily in Jordan and Lebanon, with fewer in Syria.19 Around 70,000 went to the East Bank or present-­day Jordan, while the bulk of the refugees went to the West Bank or Gaza. The 280,000 Palestinians displaced from the new Israeli state to the West Bank would ­later be ­under the administrative control of Jordan, as it absorbed this territory u ­ ntil its disengagement with the Palestinian territories in the late 1980s. Approximately 100,000 refugees went to Lebanon, 75,000 to Syria, and a few thousand to Iraq.20 The Palestinians ­were armed militarily, which led to concern in both Jordan and Lebanon that their weapons would turn against their host states or that their actions would draw the states into a dangerous and doomed conflict with Israel. Their po­liti­cal ideas ­were also threatening to ­these regimes, as they leaned distinctly left eco­nom­ically and socially. Palestinians found the best situation in Jordan for personal security, freedom of movement, activism, and employment, b ­ ecause most w ­ ere granted citizenship. Syria was the second-­most preferable, and Palestinians ­were worst off in Lebanon. The refugees and the host states w ­ ere both, for the most part, adamant about repatriation, so Palestinians resisted permanent settlement. The effects of the Palestinians ­were distinct in each host country, although Palestinians ­were involved in violent conflicts in both. Demographics mattered. In Syria the impacts ­were not identifiable, since their numbers w ­ ere relatively small. The Palestinians came to form a vibrant part of Jordanian society, while being rejected in Lebanon. In Jordan, ­after initial PLO organ­izing and vio­lence against the Palestinians, most Palestinians settled into citizenship, albeit receiving lesser po­liti­cal status. Palestinians form a minority of elected representatives due to purposive, structural features of Jordan’s electoral laws. Fears of Palestinian dominance by East Banker Jordanians continue, demonstrated in fights between soccer teams and current intense animosity against Queen Rania, who is of Palestinian descent. The Palestinian situation reflects the larger history of refugees in ­these countries. From Armenians to Iraqis and now Syrians, the experiences of t­ hese states with refugees depended on the degree of impact each group made on the proj­ ects of state-­building and national consolidation. Lebanon allowed the Armenians, of a dif­fer­ent language, culture, and diverse religion from the arguable majority of Lebanese, to integrate,21 but prohibited the three subsequent groups from ­doing so. Variables impor­tant for peaceful coexistence or the lack of it in ­these states have included the economic skills and investment the refugees bring to the state relative to existing needs of that state, and the presumed politicization of the refugees. In Jordan Palestinian refugees from 1948 and their descendants, believed to be more po­liti­cally quiescent and less activist, have a dif­fer­ent status than t­ hose who came in 1967. Already mobilized po­liti­cally by 1967, t­ hese Palestinians and\n\nBefore the Syrian Crisis\n\n23\n\ntheir descendants are treated differently than e­ arlier refugees, and have been met with more suspicion during tense periods and sometimes l­ egal administrative differences in rights and movement.22\n\nJordan and Past Refugee Waves The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a monarchical state of relatively recent origin. U ­ ntil the early 1900s, it was not considered an entity in itself, but a passage to somewhere else—­generally Damascus to the north or Mecca to the south. The Emir (Prince) Abdullah, son of the Sharif Hussein of Mecca, attempted to march to Damascus to avenge his ­brother who had been forced to abdicate his rule in Syria. The British, temporarily friendly with their French neighbors, convinced him to stay put midway on his journey from Mecca. What was then called Trans­ jordan, the land on the other side of the Jordan River, became his home. His origins in the Arabian Peninsula have not been lost on the descendants of ­those living in what would eventually become Jordan, some of whom would l­ ater condemn his descendants as foreigners. The new state was mostly desert. It contained mainly Sunni Muslims, with a few historical Christian villages in the west, as well as some Circassians who had been settled t­ here recently by the Ottomans. Foreign aid propelled the new state and has remained crucial to Jordan’s survival ever since. T ­ hose original inhabitants came to be known as East Bankers and inhabited mainly the peripheral, rural regions when the emir welcomed the Palestinians into his sparsely populated land in 1948.23 Fleeing eastward from the conquering army that would become Israel, the Palestinians arrived in Jordan at a time when it needed l­ abor and ­people. In the war that de­cided Palestine’s fate, the emir ended up with administrative control over the West Bank (of the Jordan River), in addition to his original lands east of the river. T ­ hese West Bank areas w ­ ere impor­tant to the agricultural production of the Jordanian state. To the emir’s mind, the Palestinians w ­ ere a welcome addition to the kingdom, and did not conflict with the native inhabitants at the time, as Palestinians did in Lebanon. H ­ ere the skill profile of the newcomers differed substantially from that of the natives, who ­were predominantly rural and less educated. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) aided this dif­fer­ent skill profile by training the Palestinians in occupations the state could use. Early relations ­were thus nowhere near as conflictual as they w ­ ere in Lebanon. ­Later Palestinian po­liti­cal mobilization, however, proved uncomfortable for the monarchy. In 1956–1957 a heavi­ly Palestinian Arab nationalist po­liti­cal party won elections and gained the post of prime minister. Their success lay in the fact that the\n\n24 CHAPTER 1\n\nredistributive economic agenda of the party was attractive to many of the lower classes, while the Jordanian-­Palestinian distinction was not sharp at this point. Society was highly mobilized in the 1950s.24 Declaring the king a constitutional, not unlimited, monarch was perhaps the last straw for that demo­cratic experiment. The monarchy defended its existence by encircling parliament with the army and instituting martial law. Elections would not return till the demonstrations of 1989, when price rises resulting from the International Monetary Fund’s neoliberal economic reforms ­were met with riots. The next wave of Palestinians entering Jordan in 1967 was viewed by the regime with suspicion, as they ­were already politicized and or­ga­nized. The history of the Palestinians in Jordan since then has not been wholly peaceful and has indeed been punctuated by severe vio­lence and animosity, particularly during periods of Palestinian po­liti­cal activity, both within the electoral framework of Jordan and among the Palestinians themselves. The ­battle between the PLO and the Jordanian state in 1970, called Black September, was a turning point for Palestinian po­liti­cal activity in Jordan. Although it did not spell the end of the Palestinian presence nor lessen their influence, the monarchy gained the clear upper hand in that conflict, expelled the fighters, and has since remained dominant.25 In the 1970s the public sector became the domain of the East Bankers and the private sector became more exclusively Palestinian through purposive regime policy.26 Kicking many Palestinians out of the state sector was intended to solidify the East Bankers as a support base for the monarchy. As a state, Jordan provided ­little in the way of ser­v ices to its population, whereas state employment provided benefits that ­were difficult for the working classes to obtain in the private sector. Ostensibly relying on a private sector, laissez-­faire economic model, the state in fact employed a large percentage of the population, furnishing them with health care, the ability to take advances on their pay (effectively loans), and subsidized goods from government cooperatives. To take advantage of ­these goods, however, one had to have a ­family member in state or military employ. Over time, employment with the state in general and often in the military specifically (­after economic neoliberalism began) w ­ ere viewed as rights of East Bankers by virtue of their being “sons of the country,” or ibn al-­balad. Palestinians w ­ ere thus pushed into the private sector, a division that persists to this day. This new benefit for the East Bankers decreased in value during the oil boom of the 1970s. Jordan, by pushing Palestinians into the private economy, actually embedded them in the more profitable sector. Denied state employment in Jordan, Palestinians migrated to the Gulf states to work and, as an unintended consequence, earned significantly more than their Jordanian counter­parts. The improved economic fortunes of the Palestinians in turn affected the economy of Jordan. They purchased real estate and came to dominate the ­middle strata of the\n\nBefore the Syrian Crisis\n\n25\n\nprivate sector, while their remittances boosted inflation in Jordan. Inflation—­ increasing the price of living by three times—­agitated even the Jordanian military. The regime responded with increased army salaries and subsidies and maximum prices for key food and nonfood items, including electricity and w ­ ater, to support the domestic population.27 Still worse off in general than the Palestinians, the rural East Bankers at least had a steady, dependable form of income. The private sector further developed ­after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In 1990–1991, Palestinians “returned” to Jordan from Kuwait, bringing with them significant investment and creating ­whole new areas of the capital city.28 East Banker support for the Jordanian monarchy rested on a social contract that exchanged economic rights for po­liti­cal backing.29 Economic goods and employment for this population, many of whom live in rural, underdeveloped areas with few economic opportunities, allow the regime to justify forestalling po­liti­ cal reform. The state solidified this alliance with the East Bankers symbolically by emphasizing the place of the tribes in Jordan, enacting and reinforcing tribal rituals and methods of accessing power. The main economic good provided by the social contract was employment with the state, which accommodated a larger number of ­people than was needed, turning jobs into guaranteed pay checks without concomitant expectations of work. This contract was threatened by economic liberalization. In the 1990s, international lending organ­izations demanded a more balanced bud­get and cost-­cutting from wasteful areas in return for continued international loans. Civil ser­vice was prime on their list of targets. Deprived of this ave­nue for generating po­liti­cal support, the regime turned to the military and security sectors as its base of support, and indeed did so with international approval in an age of insecurity.30 This deal was not as solid as the prior one, particularly since aspects of the social contract other than employment w ­ ere also being broken. Bread riots occurred in 1989 and 1996 with the partial removal of subsidies,31 but bread and many other goods remained subsidized and served as a source of entitlement for East Bankers. ­Those of Palestinian descent w ­ ere not included in the bargain, and while they benefited from subsidized prices, they have been denied po­liti­cal repre­sen­ta­tion in proportion to their numbers. Elections have continually given significantly more weight to East Bank and rural areas than Palestinian urban ones, both through dif­fer­ent numbers of representatives elected by the vari­ous areas and through overt electoral manipulation. This division has been used as the major salient cleavage in po­liti­cal rhe­toric and is conjured and stoked through false stories or rumors in the face of any threat to the regime. Palestinians are rhetorically coded as disloyal subjects and associated with urban life. East Bankers, meanwhile, are generally associated with tribalism and the rural areas.32 In times of trou­ble, blame is routinely placed not only on Palestinians but on varied out-­groups and\n\n26 CHAPTER 1\n\nforeigners. In 1989 with the bread riots, and even into the 1990s, the state tried out dif­fer­ent groups for blame, moving from Ba’athists to Communists and l­ ater to Islamists. ­Today Palestinians in Jordan occupy a wide range of social classes and run the spectrum from well-­integrated and influential to completely marginalized. Locally, ­people know who is a Palestinian and who is not, although intermarriage has marred any strict lines. Jordan still has refugee camps for Palestinians, and their marginalization is clear, yet some Palestinians do well. Despite this partial social absorption, rhetorical and po­liti­cal integration has not proceeded apace. Statistics on Palestinian descent versus East Bank lineage demographics are kept secret. The issue is viewed as a national security threat, particularly as East Bank groups have mobilized previously against “foreigners,” among whom they sometimes include the king (of Arabian peninsula origin). ­After Palestinians, the next wave of refugees to arrive in Jordan consisted of Iraqis during the 1990s sanctions era, and even more arrived a few years a­ fter the second Iraqi war began in 2003, particularly in 2006–2007. While the Jordanian state maintained that up to a million Iraqi refugees w ­ ere in the country, studies show fewer than 500,000, with only 49,000 registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 2007.33 ­Here as with the Palestinians before and the Syrians ­after, Jordan played with the numbers of refugees and exaggerated their effects to extract resources from the international community.34 The reception of the Iraqis was similar to that given recent Syrian arrivals. Jordan restricted which refugees could enter the country and referred to them as “guests.” ­After the 2005 terrorist bombings in Amman, committed by some Iraqis, Jordan severely l­ imited the ability of Iraqis to enter the country.35 The Iraqis ­were resented, blamed for skyrocketing rent prices, higher costs of living, and taking jobs from Jordanians by working for lower wages,36 precisely the complaints levied against Syrian refugees ­today. ­These economic changes ­were caused by ­factors unrelated to the Iraqis, a fact that was publicized, but such facts failed to sway public opinion.37 Other dynamics ­were similar to the ­later wave of Syrians. The Iraqis ­were viewed as a new invader, spurring fear of insecurity from the refugees and in par­tic­u­lar the Iraqis who ­were Shi’a. The Iraqis ­were resented for not appreciating the benefits they received in Jordan. Jordanians complained about how the Iraqis acted, and how they received the worst of the Iraqis. One researcher referred to the Iraqis as a “handy punching bag” for Jordanian economic prob­ lems.38 Jordanians ­today remember the Iraqi refugees and their reception of ­those refugees quite differently. Instead of recognizing their widespread resentment of this population, the common recollection is that Iraqis w ­ ere richer than the Syrians, that they invested in the country, bought h ­ ouses, and did not affect the rental market the ways Syrians do. The popu­lar images are t­ hose of artists and ­people\n\nBefore the Syrian Crisis\n\n27\n\nof means, more fitting for the Iraqis of the 1990s than the real­ity of the ­later Iraqi refugees. At a minimum, they are not currently viewed as having competed with domestic ­labor, in contrast to the Syrians.39 The el­derly Iraqi w ­ oman selling goods on the street did and still does exist, but Iraqi refugee numbers are now small enough to no longer generate negative opinions.40 The dynamic in Lebanon ­toward the Iraqis taking refuge t­ here was the same, as is the current discourse reinventing ­those older perceptions.\n\nMobilizing and Po­liti­cal Themes in Jordan Jordan’s pattern of large-­scale mobilizing has been twofold. One set of themes focuses on international po­liti­cal prob­lems, mainly around support for the Palestinians. This type of mobilizing is routine, and now a somewhat accepted part of Jordan’s politics.41 The other themes are interconnected and domestic. They are largely based on economic concerns, although governance and politics are ordinarily implicated in such criticisms. They are often episodic, less or­ga­nized, and involve key regime-­supporting regions. The lack of democracy and prevalence of corruption are recurring motifs, but t­ hese often spring from or are connected to economic prob­lems. U ­ ntil 2012 Jordan’s king remained largely above criticism: It has been a fundamental po­liti­cal baseline that the monarchy should remain. To deflect criticism or prob­lems, the king plays with parliament and the cabinet, shuffling them and dismissing them to placate popu­lar discontent or buy time.42 To contain protest, po­liti­cal freedoms have been narrowed and the l­egal and geo­graph­ic­ al ability to protest increasingly constrained. Added to ­these mechanisms, heavy repression and coercion have been used along with cultivated internal divisions to keep the opposition from becoming a threat to the regime. Depicting Palestinians as the opposition, or at least with suspicion, has remained a po­liti­cal motif, and even Jordanians of Palestinian origin who are regime elites use this tactic, demonstrating the inherent ambiguity of the dichotomy.43 Indeed, Jordanian Palestinians do not generally protest on their own terms but ­under broader ­causes or not at all. Palestinians are commonly associated with caring about the fate of Jerusalem and animosity t­ oward Israel, but in fact t­ hese sentiments are widespread. The monarchy allows protest on ­these subjects, a way of blowing off steam in controlled, even scripted protests.44 The main and largest opposition actor has been the Muslim Brotherhood, which has operated largely within regime-­specified limits. This opposition overlays nicely with the regime-­ promoted rhetorical dichotomy of Palestinians as disloyal or suspect and East Bankers as stalwart nationalists and the regime’s base.45 The issue is more complicated, however, for while Islamism in its po­liti­cal guise in Jordan is currently associated with Palestinians, historically the Jordanian state has had warm relations\n\n28 CHAPTER 1\n\nwith the Muslim Brotherhood. While such relations are not as cordial as during the formation of the state, Islamist leaders still have privileges.46 The few times the East Bankers have risen up, prior to 2011, w ­ ere sporadic but impor­tant, and mainly focused on the group’s entitlements. Jordan’s bread riots, caused by the removal of subsidies and bread price rises, are an example of when the main issue began as an economic grievance but led neatly to a critique of t­ hose directing the economy, who ­were seen as unaccountable by the populace.47 Bread has been viewed as fundamental to life, indeed as “life itself.”48 Such domestic grievances are interpreted as more threatening by the regime than the international po­liti­cal concerns associated with Palestinian protest. The threat perception is demonstrated in the speed of regime response, mobilization, and conciliation. This is unsurprising b ­ ecause, as we have seen, economic support has been key to the social contract forestalling po­liti­cal protest. Some or­ga­nized economic mobilizing has increased over the past de­cade, with increasing strikes and ­labor actions.49 This dual-­track pattern of protest origins was broken somewhat during the Arab Uprisings, as that movement combined overt po­liti­cal with economic grievances.50 Jordan’s protests in the uprisings w ­ ere short, and w ­ ere reformist rather 51 than revolutionary. The monarchy itself remained out of bounds, with a few exceptions.52 The opposition demands during the Arab Uprising and ­after ­were centered on corruption and economic prob­lems, intertwined with the royal ­family and their privilege (particularly Queen Rania), lack of demo­cratic repre­sen­ta­tion, and limits on royal power.53 The Hirak al-­Shababi (Youth Movement) was a major player in ­these protests, along with the March 24 Movement, the group of thirty-­six tribal representatives, and the National Committee of the Military Veterans.54 While the youth-­based March 24 Movement went beyond the traditional Palestinian-­Jordanian divide, the o ­ thers did not.55 The Hirak, the military veterans, and the tribes ­were all East Banker movements. March 24 was urban and young, based in a more cosmopolitan setting crossing traditional divisions. The East Bankers ­were motivated by economic policies, including privatization and neoliberal reforms, that threatened their historical, privileged social contract of receiving economic livelihood in return for loyalty to the regime. They ­were also motivated by the desire for increased democracy and by overt hostility to this king and surrounding elites, widely accused of corruption. The movements ­were brought down by internal divisions and traditional state actions that both placated protesters and repressed them. The regime lowered food prices, repressed and arrested demonstrators, and dismissed government ministers to quell the protests.56 The fundamental grievances, however, remained. Palestinian-­Jordanian animosity curtailed the potential for opposition unity and demands, with East Bankers worried that equal repre­sen­ta­tion would dimin-\n\nBefore the Syrian Crisis\n\n29\n\nish their po­liti­cal power. Despite being heavi­ly from the regime’s core constituency,57 the new protest movements of 2011 w ­ ere charged with being disloyal, and stories circulated linking them with the Muslim Brotherhood, code for Palestinian.58 This ethnic dichotomy was also brought to the fore when Queen Rania’s Palestinian heritage and her f­ amily’s presumed corruption earned her the express disapproval of Jordanian retired military leaders.59 Many East Banker movements marginalize or are hostile to Palestinians. It is this division that has kept the monarchy as the only body able to rule the country and has prevented a mass uprising. Prior public relations campaigns by the state—­“Jordan First” and “We are all Jordan”—­have undertones of dismissing concern for any other state (including any ­future Palestinian one) and overtly uniting ­under the Jordanian national identity banner.60 Protest became more difficult due to repression, and infrastructure and development proj­ects altered urban geography, effectively preventing the physical location of large protest groups in central areas.61 The popu­ lar hesitation to protest, due to fear of a repressive backlash from the regime and a desire to avoid the domestic spread of Syria’s civil war, has combined with structural f­ actors to subdue protest.62 The regime strongly resisted moves to substantively de­moc­ra­tize.63 The year following the uprising brought demonstrations that pushed the margins still further, by beginning to criticize the king.64 Still, ­these ­were far from revolutionary.65\n\nLebanon and Past Refugee Waves Lebanon was formed out of a part of Greater Syria by French colonialism ­under the mandate system. France carved out a country that would be a bare majority Christian but also include the more heavi­ly Shi’a grain-­producing areas.66 As a lush, rain-­fed land, Lebanon was fully populated with a diverse array of p ­ eople, many of whom had sought refuge centuries before in Lebanon’s mountains. ­These mountain ranges served as a geo­graph­i­cal barrier to conquest and assimilation. The state became a technical democracy with civil rights, run along consociational lines, with sectarian balancing in governmental positions and state policy. Founded by financiers and traders, the state was designed to be minimalist and dependent on the private sector.67 The new state’s po­liti­cal formula was built on the questionable census from 1932 and the National Pact of 1943, dividing power among the major communities. The state would be weak and dependent on France, as witnessed in the military’s division into equal parts Christian and Muslim. Maronite Catholics held the main power among eigh­teen recognized sects in this consociational system. The National Pact solidified a deal between Maronite and Sunni Muslim elites for the presidency and prime minister, respectively, and entailed\n\n30 CHAPTER 1\n\nan agreement to disagree permanently over the country’s identity: It would be neither pro-­Arab nor pro-­Western, an agreement that exists to this day. Lebanon had—­and still has—­a crucial po­liti­cal issue in the need to balance the sectarian demographics of its population and as a result is notoriously inactive as a government, making any policies difficult to pass or enact. Sectarianism even governs public expenditures and popu­lar access to goods and ser­v ices.68 So fragmented is the state’s identity that schoolbooks and even maps produced by dif­fer­ent religious sects in Lebanon do not agree on the impor­tant national cities, highlighting dif­fer­ent ones. ­After a brief civil war in 1958, usually forgotten, when the Christian president wanted to expand his powers and renew his term illegally, the 1960s ushered in Lebanon’s golden era, when it became known as “the Switzerland of the ­Middle East.” Unfortunately, this growth was based on what would turn out to be the temporary ascendance of the Lebanese banks. Lebanon functioned as the intermediary for moving money from the Gulf, and this regionally strategic role would be bypassed with the advent of globalized banking. Class as an impor­tant variable, the urban-­rural divide, the extreme contrast between the capital, Beirut, and the rural areas, and neglect of agriculture, industry, and state ser­v ices ­were characteristic of this historical era, and remain relevant t­ oday. When the Palestinians entered in 1948, the new state, run by Christians, granted the few Christian Palestinians citizenship but not the far more numerous Muslim ones. Apart from a few border villages that ­were naturalized over time, the Lebanese po­liti­cal elite was united against any tawteen, or naturalizing, of the Palestinians. Lebanon had no need for the added population, and the ­labor profile of the new refugees set them in competition with its own more educated population. Lebanon had never been able to employ all its ­people, demonstrated by the regular emigration of Lebanese to all parts of the globe from at least the latter part of the 1800s. Palestinians ­were popularly viewed as a threat to employment of Lebanese, not a complementary workforce. Lebanon was far more developed in industrial manufacturing and educational level than Jordan, indeed t­ here ­were no Jordanians with a doctorate resident in the country, nor any institutions of advanced education till the 1960s and 1970s, respectively. The Lebanese solution to the economic pressure imposed by Palestinian refugees ultimately had po­liti­cal consequences. Muslim Palestinians w ­ ere confined to camps near business enterprises, and, ­after being initially employed in factory work, ­these Palestinians ­were barred first from skilled work, then from almost all employment, and fi­nally made dependent on UNRWA. Palestinians continued their attempts to return to their homeland through war, then took a side in the civil war that began in 1975. The camps thus became armed extrasovereign locations that w ­ ere not policed by Lebanese security ser­vices or the military and have remained a security concern to this day.\n\nBefore the Syrian Crisis\n\n31\n\nThe civil war lasted from 1975 to 1990, ending when Syria became an occupying force with the blessing of the United States and Saudi Arabia. The Ta’if Agreement ending the war changed some of the distribution of power among sects in the confessional system, but kept the basic system intact. Most notably, the Sunni prime minister now had significantly more power than the Christian president. The military reformed itself and eventually became the only trusted state institution.69 The sometime prime minister Rafiq Hariri, along with continued corruption, dominated the postwar era, while the country sank deeper into debt ­because of loans for reconstruction. Hariri, a Saudi-­allied billionaire, had construction companies and financial interests ­running through all ­these deals. His personal finances benefited greatly from this era of reconstruction while he was in public office.70 Lebanon attempted to recover its status as the Switzerland or Paris of the ­Middle East, building on the same formula that worked in the 1960s. But the world had changed and no longer needed Lebanese banks to pro­cess Gulf money. Hizbollah entered polit"
