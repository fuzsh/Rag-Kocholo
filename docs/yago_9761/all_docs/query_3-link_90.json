        "text": "What made you audition for this show?\n\nI was intrigued by the play’s storyline and the complexity of internal and extern al conflicts that the characters must struggle with.\n\nHow do you relate to the character you’re portraying?\n\nI love Millie’s many layers. I can relate to her perceived outward persona and the complex layers that lie beneath. People frequently think that I’m quiet, and shy, but soon find out that still waters do run deep.\n\nIf you had to describe the show in one word, what would it be?\n\nRelevant!\n\nWhat do you want people to take away from this show?\n\nThe realization that everyone is negatively affected by oppressive societal norms and stereotypes and that we should consciously strive to see and treat each other as unique and equal individuals.\n\nWhy should patrons come to support/attend the show?\n\nThey will enjoy an evening on an emotional roller coaster! They will laugh, gasp, tear up and think."
