        "text": "Directed by Robert Altmans protégé Alan Rudolph, a Hollywood maverick, this moody, neo-noir drama is set in the dream-like Rain City (actually Seattle), a disintegrating Waste Land West in some indeterminate recent time. Framed ex-cop Kris Kristofferson emerges from jail to exploit rivalry between two gang bosses, one played by Divine, the cult transvestite star of John Waters' movies, in his only notable male role. He's trying to regain his old girlfriend, Genevieve Bujold, in whose bar much of the action is set, and Rudolph regular Keith Carradine plays an amoral tearaway trying to carve out a criminal career. Some may think it precious, but it's the haunting, poetic product of an original imagination. There are vocals from Marianne Faithfull, and striking costumes from Tracey Tynan, daughter of former Observer critic Ken Tynan. The one extra is an interview with Rudolph and Carradine."
