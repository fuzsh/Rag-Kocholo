        "text": "On this tape, a fairly obscure film from the mid 80s, Alan Rudolph’s Trouble In Mind.\n\nIt stars Kris Kristofferson as Hawk, an ex policeman who’s just getting out of prison after a stretch for murdering a notorious local villain.\n\nGenevieve Bujold plays Wanda, who runs the local diner, and is an old friend of Hawk’s.\n\nKeith Carradine and Lori Singer play Coop and Georgia, a young couple with a new baby who are finding it hard to make ends meet. He can’t get work, so he steals some money, and they go to the city hoping to find a better life.\n\nCoop hooks up with Solo (Joe Morton) a low rent crook, and they do some thieving.\n\nThe big shot gangster in town, who runs everything, is Hilly Blue, played by Divine.\n\nI spent the whole movie thinking that Hilly Blue’s right hand man, Rambo, was played by Chris Farley, but it’s actually Dirk Blocker, who’s now in Brooklyn 99.\n\nI’m not sure it counts as a running gag, since I don’t think this movie is a comedy, but as he slides deeper into the criminal world, Coop’s hair and makeup gets increasingly eccentric.\n\nThis is an odd film. I think it’s supposed to be romantic, but there’s something a bit creepy about the older Hawk falling for the much younger Georgia, and as is so often the case in these movies, based on nothing more than she’s young, attractive and blonde. She’s not given any real personality, beyond an initial loyalty to Coop, which lasts much longer than his terrible behaviour deserves.\n\nThe film exists in a slightly unreal world, and it reminded me mostly of Streets of Fire, which shared a similar out of time aesthetic and a penchant for eccentric quiffs. But it’s nowhere near as much fun as that film.\n\nAfter this, recording continues, with quite a bit of an African film, Falato. The tape ends after about an hour of the film.\n\nCuriously, this tape features two different ads which had early appearances from Matt LeBlanc. I’d seen the Heinz Tomato Ketchup one before, but I don’t remember seeing the Coke one before.\n\nAdverts:"
