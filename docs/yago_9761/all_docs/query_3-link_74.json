        "text": "Jerry Lee was the ne plus ultra of terrifying redneck speed freaks lost in the transcendent sin of rock & roll. Nobody could remotely do what he could do, and he invented a genre that contains only him, yet remains rock ‘n’ roll in its absolutely purest form.\n\nThis is the polar opposite of that unbelievable piece of shit Little Richard film. Directed by Ethan Coen and edited by his wife, Tricia Cooke, there’s not one word of narration or voiceover that doesn’t belong to Jerry Lee.\n\nThey contextualize Jerry Lee’s impenetrable - and clearly psychopathic - genius through the various incredibly stupid condescending clueless assholes who hosted him on their television shows over the decades.\n\nJerry Lee’s essence is his…\n\nIt would not seem to me that Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke, of all people, would have any need for an editing exercise at this stage in their careers, but I can't really explain what this is in any other way. Take a bunch of publicly available footage, put some limits on what you're going to permit yourself to use, see if you can get a satisfying movie out of it.

In its selected representation, Trouble in Mind brings…"
