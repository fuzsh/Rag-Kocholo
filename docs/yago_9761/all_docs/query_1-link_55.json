        "text": "Set during rehearsals for a major Broadway production, Trouble in Mind illuminates the inner life of a Black actress struggling with her career. She’s paid her dues throughout the years, playing stereotypical supporting roles in second-rate shows, and is ready for her star turn. Alice Childress’s 1955 play – which finally premiered on Broadway in 2021 – is a funny, moving and heartbreaking look at racism, identity and ego in the high-stakes world of New York theatre.\n\nBy Alice Childress\n\nDirected by Ken Hinton\n\nClick here to access the Trouble in Mind program!\n\n“Trouble in Mind” is presented by arrangement with Concord Theatricals on behalf of Samuel French, Inc. www.concordtheatricals.com\n\nEvent photo by Doug Wood.\n\nPost-show discussion | March 24 at 5:30 p.m.\n\nJoin us after the Sunday, March 24, performance of Trouble in Mind for a post-show discussion!
