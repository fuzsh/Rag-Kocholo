        "text": "February 5 – March 13, 2022\n\nDonald and Darlene Shiley Stage\n\nOld Globe Theatre\n\nConrad Prebys Theatre Center\n\nBy Alice Childress\n\nDirected by Delicia Turner Sonnenberg\n\nA thrilling new production of a too-often neglected American classic. New York, 1955. A leading Black actress and a multiracial cast rehearse a challenging new Broadway play set in the South. Backstage rivalries and showbiz egos cause excitement of their own, but artistic differences between the cast and the White director soon bubble to the surface, revealing the truths that American drama covers over and the ways in which even well-meaning people can harm others under the guise of helping. The New York Times recently called Alice Childress’s groundbreaking Trouble in Mind “a rich, unsettling play that lingers in one’s memory long after its conclusion.”\n\nContains strong language.\n\nRunning time: Two hours. There is one intermission.\n\nOpen Caption Performance: Saturday, February 26, 2022 at 2:00 p.m.\n\nTrouble in Mind is supported by production sponsors Sheryl and Harvey White and artist sponsors Ric and Eleanor Charlton (for Director Delicia Turner Sonnenberg) and Mandell Weiss Charitable Trust (for Ramona Keller)."
