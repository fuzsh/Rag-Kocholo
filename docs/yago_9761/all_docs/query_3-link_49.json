        "text": "Alice Childress’s illuminating, moving, and surprisingly funny play set during rehearsals for a Broadway-bound play where harsh truths that spill out into the rehearsal room may cost the actors the work they so desperately need.\n\n“Deserves to be a classic.”\n\n–NY Times\n\n“Funny, fresh, profound, and surprisingly timely for a play written two years before the first Edsel rolled off the showroom floor.”\n\n–Drama Circle\n\n“Speaks to today’s concerns…hard to believe it was written in 1955.”\n\n–Stage Door\n\nABOUT THE PLAYWRIGHT\n\nAlice Childress (October 12, 1916 – August 14, 1994) was an American novelist, playwright, and actress, acknowledged as the only African-American woman to have written, produced, and published plays for four decades. Childress described her work as trying to portray the have-nots in a have society, saying: “My writing attempts to interpret the ‘ordinary’ because they are not ordinary. Each human is uniquely different. Like snowflakes, the human pattern is never cast twice. We are uncommonly and marvellously intricate in thought and action, our problems are most complex and, too often, silently borne.” Childress became involved in social causes, and formed an off-Broadway union for actors.\n\nChildress (née Herndon) was born in Charleston, South Carolina, but at the age of nine, after her parents separated, she moved to Harlem, New York City, where she lived with her grandmother, Eliza Campbell White, on 118th Street, between Lenox Avenue and Fifth Avenue. Though her grandmother, the daughter of a slave, had no formal education, she encouraged Alice to pursue her talents in reading and writing. Alice attended public school in New York for her middle-school education and went on to Wadleigh High School, but had to drop out once her grandmother died. She became involved in theater immediately after her high school and she did not attend college.\n\nIn 1949, she began her writing career with the one-act play Florence, which she directed and starred in, and which reflected many of the themes that are characteristic of her later writing, including the empowerment of black women, interracial politics, and working-class life.\n\nChildress’s first full-length, dramatic play, Trouble in Mind was produced at Stella Holt’s Greenwich Mews Theatre in 1955 and ran for 91 performances. Biographies and her 1994 obituary claim that Trouble in Mind won an Obie award for the best off-Broadway play of the 1955–56 season, which would have made Childress the first African American woman to be awarded the honor. However, Trouble in Mind is not in the American Theatre Wing’s records as having won an Obie for the 1955–56 season. Trouble in Mind is about racism in the theater world. In a play-within-a-play, Childress depicts the frustrations of black actors and actresses in mainstream white theater. The show’s success led to plans for a Broadway transfer, but these plans were nixed when Childress refused to change the play’s ending. Had it opened, it would have been the first play by an African American woman to open on Broadway (a title taken by A Raisin in the Sun four years later). An acclaimed revival of Trouble in Mind was presented on Broadway from October 29, 2021, to January 9, 2022, at Roundabout Theatre Company’s American Airlines Theatre. It starred LaChanze, Chuck Cooper, Michael Zegen, Danielle Campbell, Jessica Frances Dukes, Brandon Micheal Hall, Don Stephenson, Alex Mickiewicz, and Simon Jones and was directed by Charles Randolph-Wright. The production was nominated for four Tony Awards including Best Revival of a Play, Best Actress in a Play (LaChanze), Best Featured Actor in a Play (Chuck Cooper), and Best Costume Design in a Play (Emilio Sosa).\n\nAlice Childress’s paper archive is held at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, New York.\n\nADARA ALSTON (Associate Director/Millie Davis) is delighted to be working with Franklin Stage Company again after performing as Kate in Good People, as Mrs.Muller in Doubt: A Parable and as the Chorus for the Henry V prologue in the 2020 Soliloquies at Chapel Hall series.
