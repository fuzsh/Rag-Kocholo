That evening, Neil calls Barbara from a bar and makes an excuse for being late. The next day, Neil becomes annoyed when Barbara asks if everything is all right between them, but he blames his mood on work stress. Later, Emily calls Neil’s house and asks Barbara several questions before Neil forces Barbara to hang up the phone. The next day, Emily spies through Neil’s window, then goes to a local department store to meet Mr. Nudd, the son of a female inmate Emily knew while she was in prison. Although he hires Emily as a favor to his mother, his assistant manager, Rita, is not happy about another ex-convict working at the store. Later, Emily returns to Neil and Barbara’s house and destroys their flowerbed. Barbara comes home from work and calls Neil to ask when he is coming home. Returning to her car, Barbara finds the ripped up flowers on her front seat. Unnerved, she tries to start her car but the engine will not turn over. A friend fixes Barbara’s car as Emily watches from down the street. As Barbara drives to Neil’s construction site, Emily follows. Later, Neil and Barbara go out to dinner and come home intoxicated. As they are about to make love, Emily throws a rock through their window. Neil runs to see who threw the rock and spots Emily before she speeds off in her car. Barbara asks who it was but Neil claims he does not know. Barbara wants to call the police, but Neil talks her out of it. Returning to her apartment, Emily visits Pike, the building manager. She asks for items like lamps and curtains to make her place more livable. As he denies her request, she begs on her knees but he pulls her off the floor. She first slaps him, and then hugs him desperately. Pike softens and hugs her back, but she runs away. The next day, Emily is surprised to see Neil and Barbara shopping where she works and hides her face when they come to register. Later, a co-worker named Harry warns that Rita is spreading rumors about Emily being a former prisoner. Emily encounters Rita, slaps her, and warns her never to spread “lies” about her again. Later, dressing in her sexiest outfit, Emily goes to the construction site and flaunts herself in front of Neil until he finally recognizes her. The next day, Emily breaks into Neil’s house while Barbara is there alone. Frightened, Barbara pulls a kitchen knife and demands to know who she is. Emily taunts Barbara with her knowledge of Neil then pulls out her own knife, laughing as Barbara screams in terror. However, Emily puts the knife down and walks away when she hears Neil coming. Barbara runs to her bedroom and hides, but says everything is fine when Neil asks if anything strange happened. The next day at work, Rita informs Mr. Nudd that money is missing from the register. Mr. Nudd accuses Emily and fires her. Emily finds Rita and kicks her in the stomach, demanding she return the money. As Emily storms away, Rita’s friend in the parking lot harasses her. Emily stabs the man with a pencil. Barbara happens to be in the parking lot and witnesses the attack. She informs Mr. Nudd and calls the police. Later that evening, Neil is unable to start his car. A car rams into his and pulls up next to him. Neil sees it is Emily before she speeds away. Emily is surprised when the police arrest her for breaking the window at Neil’s home and not for the parking lot attack. At the police station, Barbara identifies Emily and wants to press charges; however, Neil wants to talk to Emily alone before they make any decisions, leaving Barbara shocked and confused. The police take Neil to Emily’s cell, and he tells her to leave him and Barbara alone, but Emily is upset that Neil abandoned her years ago. Although Neil is defensive, he does not push her away when she throws her arms around him. Emily forgives him for leaving, reminisces about their relationship, and says she wants to get back together. When she gives him her address, Neil tells the police he is not going to press charges and Barbara demands to know what is going on. Barbara is furious when he admits that he was married to Emily twelve years ago. When Emily returns to her apartment, Pike offers to lend her money to help with her legal problems. Back at the Curry home, Barbara says the police told her Emily was in jail for murder and she does not understand why Neil is protecting her. He replies it was an accident that just looked like murder. He admits he had an affair with another woman while married to Emily and that woman is the one she accidentally killed. Barbara walks out, disgusted. The next day, Neil is fired from his job. Emily is there when it happens and takes Neil out for drinks. That evening, Barbara returns home while Emily and Neil spend the evening getting drunk. They go to Emily’s apartment and have sex. The next morning, Emily leaves while Neil is still passed out on her bed. She runs into Pike, who asks her out on a date. She lies and says she has to work. Pike finds Neil in Emily’s bed and feels like a fool. Emily goes to a boutique and uses Neil’s credit card to buy clothes. Barbara hires someone to change the locks at the house. Emily returns to the apartment building and gives Pike her keys, and then drives away, leaving Neil to deal with the consequences of his actions."
