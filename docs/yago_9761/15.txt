Trouble in Mind is a neo-noir film that takes place in the fictional city of Rain City. The movie was released in 1985 and was written and directed by Alan Rudolph. The film stars a talented cast, including Kris Kristofferson, Keith Carradine, Lori Singer, and Geneviève Bujold. The movie follows the parallel lives of three characters, each struggling to make a life for themselves in the chaotic and often violent Rain City. Wandering through this desolate town is Hawk, played by Kristofferson, a former cop who has recently been released from prison. Hawk's life is complicated further by his relationship with Georgia (Lori Singer), a young and wild woman who is caught up in a love affair with Coop (Carradine), a would-be gangster.

The film opens with Hawk, who has been living in prison for the past seven years, as he is released and returns to the city. Upon his return, he visits his old friend Wanda (Geneviève Bujold), a woman he met in prison who now owns a cafe in Rain City. Wanda hires Hawk as a cook, and he begins to rebuild his life.

Meanwhile, Coop, the small-time crook and Georgia's lover, is trying to make a name for himself in the town's criminal underworld. He aspires to be like Hilly Blue (played by Divine), a ruthless and feared gangster who rules the city from his high-rise office. At the same time, Georgia finds herself caught in a web of deceit and betrayal as she tries to navigate her relationship with Coop and her burgeoning feelings for Hawk.

Throughout the film, the lives of these three characters intertwine in surprising and unexpected ways. Hawk finds himself drawn into Coop's criminal activities, while Coop's ambitions grow more dangerous and reckless by the day. Georgia struggles to come to terms with her own desires and loyalties as the tension and violence in Rain City escalate.

As the plot unfolds, the characters are forced to confront their pasts and the choices they have made that have led them to this point in their lives. The film explores themes of redemption, fate, and the human desire to find meaning and purpose in a world that often seems senseless and chaotic.

The film is beautifully shot, with moody and atmospheric lighting that creates a sense of foreboding and unease. The gritty and urban setting of Rain City adds to the film's noir sensibility, and the muted color palette reflects the bleakness of the characters' lives.

The acting in the film is excellent, with each actor delivering a nuanced and subtle performance. Kristofferson is particularly impressive as Hawk, whose stoicism and quiet strength belie his troubled past. Singer is also excellent as Georgia, capturing both her wildness and vulnerability.

Overall, Trouble in Mind is a complex and engaging film that defies easy categorization. It combines elements of film noir, romance, and crime drama into a unique and compelling narrative that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. If you are a fan of neo-noir or character-driven drama, this film is definitely worth checking out.
