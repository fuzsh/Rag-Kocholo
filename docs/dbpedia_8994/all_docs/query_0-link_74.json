        "text": "In this paper, I am not suggesting that a certain type of sociopolitical and economic, as well as material, rebuilding did not occur in Lebanon in the 1990s following the end of the Civil War. The vast reconstruction led by, and formed around, the urban development corporation Solidere in downtown Beirut that eventually followed the signing of the Ta’if Peace Accords did mark a new era in the country. Indeed, the Solidere project is described by the architect Bernard Khoury in typical hyperbolic fashion as, “the largest real estate adventure on the planet at the time.” It certainly was in the 1990s the single largest real estate corporation in the Middle East and formed the core of the national reconstruction project for Lebanon. But, I argue, this process was neither a clean break from the dynamics of the Civil War nor an attempt to rebuild a social contract to establish a post-war phase.\n\nThe architect and planner Michel Ecochard has had a long career in developing countries, from its first works in Syria under the French rule, until the 1970s. He represented the modernist and functionalist approach to planning in a time of modernization. In this article, we concentrate on his work in Lebanon and Syria between the end of the 1950s and the 1960s. He prepared the master plans of Beirut and of Damascus. Those works represented the end of an era rooted in colonial planning. It was also the beginning of a new time, with the local planners taking on, sometimes sharing, sometimes contesting Ecochard's visions. Building on recent scholarship on the circulation of planning ideas, we focus on the reception of Ecochard's proposals. Though most political elites and planning professionals shared most of Ecochard's views, the political circumstances and the changing social conditions led to adjustments and reorientations. The new planning framework was also a major factor of change.\n\nThe Middle East heritage in the last century has been suffering of war disasters, terrorist attacks, immigration and therefore squatting... People loose their homes, their cities, a part of their history, their heritage and consequently their identity as a population. In this thesis, Beirut, capital of Lebanon, my country, is the case study taken to analyze Post war reconstruction in the Middle East. Beirut, one of the oldest cities in the world, in 1990 had just gotten out from a 15 year devastating Civil War. In the first part, the urban development of the city will be studied to understand how a private company called Solidere took control of the Post War Reconstruction Process. We will also see what were the main aspects of the proposed master plan and the critiques it received. Due to political instability the Project failed, consequently many buildings that were expropriated waiting to be demolished or redeveloped into a private entity remained closed down, namely the Grand Theater. In the second part of the thesis, we will take a look at this edifice that raised the curiosity of many passers through the years. This eclectic building has always reflected the conditions of the city; it represents memory, identity and hope of a cultural building, since Solidere’s masterplan doesn’t comprise one. At the very end of this research work, and after thorough analysis, a re-use design will be proposed. This proposal will take into consideration the actual state of the building after the attempts of renovating and reuse of Solidere."
