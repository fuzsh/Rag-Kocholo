        "text": "In April, 1975, civil war breaks out; Beirut is partitioned along a Moslem-Christian line. Tarek is in high school, making Super 8 movies with his friend, Omar. At first the war is a lark: school has closed, the violence is fascinating, getting from West to East is a game. His mother wants to leave; his father refuses. Tarek spends time with May, a Christian, orphaned and living in his building. By accident, Tarek goes to an infamous brothel in the war-torn Olive Quarter, meeting its legendary madam, Oum Walid. He then takes Omar and May there using her underwear as a white flag for safe passage. Family tensions rise. As he comes of age, the war moves inexorably from adventure to tragedy.\n\nFifteen years after a traumatic explosion in his native Beirut, Kamal Maf'ouss returns from France, where he was nationalized and become a composer-choreographer.

Opinions clash on their modern, cosmopolitan version of a traditional genre, even among their friends and family, while other personal problems complicate matters further.\n\nA young 15 year old girl, Lamia, lives in a southern Lebanese village on the border with Israel. She is given in marriage to her cousin on the other side of the border.

His friend is murdered in cold blood; he gets separated from Yasmine when her family moves away to escape the war; and his father gets kidnapped by the militia. Despite his opposition to violence and warfare, Rami finds himself signing up to be a militia fighter for a different faction, in a bid to find his father. He meets Siham, a young mother whose husband was kidnapped; in spite of the obstacles in her way, she is determined to find her husband. When his fellow militia fighters capture a prisoner and decide to kill him, Rami must make a choice between his humanity and his allegiance to his faction, in a war that has pitted him against his own friend.\n\nThree protagonists, one city... Coming from different backgrounds, they pass each other but they never meet, though, the effect of one incident will drastically alter the lives of the three of them!

Would he succeed in his mission and get the fortune? Let's see..\n\nZiyad and Maryam are a happy young couple in Lebanon, yet after three years of marriage they remain childless. Due to intense family pressure, they try everything they can but eventually learn that Maryam is infertile.
