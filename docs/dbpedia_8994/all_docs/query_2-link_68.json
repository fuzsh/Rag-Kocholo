        "text": "OHM HOURANI (CA)\n\nSunday, June 5, 2016 - Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal (MAC)\n\nMastered by Pheek.\n\nWHO: Jordan-born, Montréal-based DJ, producer and sound engineer Ohm Hourani with Montréal singer Do Mi (Dominique Fils-Aimé)\n\nSTYLE: Long form, laconic tech house punctuated by traditional instruments, vocals, soul and subtle Eastern flair\n\nLATEST: Mi Chica / Blinded 12” (2015), Triple X 12” – with San Proper (2014)\n\nLABELS: ANOMA\n\nMORE: Hourani operates vinyl-exclusive label ANOMA, dedicated to the distribution of distinctive, minimalistic and organic sounds kissed with soul. In 2015, Do Mi took part in television's The Voice, making it to the semi-finals of the competition.\n\nMUTEKs: Montréal: 2014\n\nArriving from the Middle East, Hourani infuses his music with a global sense of the folkloric and the technoid. His productions unfold with a long form minimalist’s patience, snippets of traditional Eastern percussion, vocal chants and jazz gurgle throughout, punctuated by live instrumentation and singing, including recent live and recorded work with Do Mi.\n\nHoning his early club chops in Jordan and Lebanon, Hourani made a fairly seamless transition into Montreal’s local scene where he is now firmly ensconced, organizing regular nights like Art House and brokering international names on his bills. With an audio engineering background in tow, he furthered his studies at Montréal's Musitechnic Institute, where he received a diploma in sound and studio technology – skills he employs to great effect in his burgeoning production resumé. He's been releasing records since 2011 and running his own label ANOMA, which has also featured a release with San Proper. He continues to seek out collaboration: his latest pairs him with Do Mi’s understated vocal style, deeply rooted in classic 40s-60s jazz and soul. Hourani made the leap from DJing to live performance a couple of years ago and his career continues to expand with frequent bookings taking him all over the world and back again.\n\nFollowing up on his 2014 appearance at MUTEK, Hourani presents AL/VE, an exclusive new set celebrating the unity of archaic machines and modern man, with Do Mi joining him in the festival’s finale position in the underground Salle BWR."
