        "text": "Patricia Khoder brings you all the gossip about Arab celebs\n\nWhere is Fadl?\n\nLebanese singer Fadl Shaker cancelled several of his summer performances last week. He had concerts scheduled in Syria, Egypt and Lebanon.\n\nRumours had it that he was the victim of a horrible car accident, but the truth is that the Lebanese singer was spending some time in Monaco, the richest principality in the world - not lazing about, but recovering from an illness.\n\nNow the Lebanese singer is back on his feet again. A few days ago, he was singing in Tunisia.\n\nShaker, who has concerts scheduled in several Arab countries, will come back to Beirut at the end of summer. He will finish working on his new album to be launched in October.\n\nNumbers game\n\nDominique Hourani gave birth to a good luck girl on 08/08/08.\n\nHourani, who married a European-Iranian millionnaire last year, gave birth in Monaco.\n\nThe singer named her daughter Delara-Sue (which means the beloved) after her mother-in law, whom the baby resembles.\n\nNo pictures of the baby have been released.\n\nHourani seems to pay great attention to the important dates in her life. She got married on 11/11 at 11am.\n\nFighting for Fares\n\nTwo squads of bodyguards got into a punch-up in Beirut.\n\nFares Karam recently got into trouble when his bodyguards unleashed a brawl after a concert.\n\nAfter Karam finished his performance, he decided to spend the night clubbing in Beirut's central district.\n\nFares, whose driver and bodyguard were following him in a seperate car, was surprised to see his convoy cut in two by a vehicle driven by the son of a political party official.\n\nA fight started between their respective armed bodyguards. Although there were no gunshots, screaming bystanders ran for cover.\n\nKaram tried in vain to calm down the politician's son and his men as well as his own bodyguard.\n\nTwo days later, after some mediation by politicians, a dinner was scheduled in Beirut between Karam and the son of the political party official, who turned out to be a big fan of the singer."
