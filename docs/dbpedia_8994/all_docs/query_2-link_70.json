        "text": "Baby talk\n\nSinger Dominique Hourani is getting broody. She talks to tabloid! about her wedding and baby plans\n\nLebanese singer Dominique Hourani, who married a European millionaire in November, is already planning her first wedding anniversary , on a grand scale.\n\nIt will take place in Cannes on the French Riviera and she will invite her family and friends to spend two weeks with her on the beach.\n\nEach day will be a celebration in itself, but one evening will be really special. On that night she will wear a dress designed by Lebanese artist Robert Abi Nader. The dress, embroidered with diamonds, is thought to be valued at 400,000 euros (Dh2.3 million).\n\nWhen asked about her husband, Dominique said she refuses to discuss him \"for security reasons\".\n\n\"As an artist, it is difficult to get used to living in such a rich family… My husband would give me the stars if I asked him. He restored my self-confidence,\" she said.\n\nDreams of children\n\nDominique, who is in the early stages of her first pregnancy, said she wants to have six children and plans to call her first-born boy Reza Junior, after her husband.\n\nThe star recently signed a recording contract with Alam Al Fan. The company will distribute her new album, Kermalek ya Dominique, which contains 11 songs in Lebanese, Egyptian and Gulf dialects.\n\nDominique has also finished filming two video clips from the album, including Battel Haraketak — a song in the Lebanese dialect — and Assah Addah Ambu, from Egyptian folklore. Both videos are directed by Bassem Moughnieh.\n\nBattel Haraketak was filmed is several places in Lebanon, including an old castle in the north. In the video, Dominique portrays a famous artist who falls in love with a very modest guy.\n\nFor Mother's Day, Dominique — who is looking forward to becoming a mother herself — offered her mum an apartment.\n\nRushed off his feet\n\nRamy Ayach is a busy man. We take a look at his plans for the future\n\nLebanese pop star Ramy Ayach has a very busy schedule. Last weekend he performed in Lebanon in a show dedicated to the association Sight First under the patronage of the Lions Club. In mid-April Ramy will be in Egypt to sing at the German University of Cairo. He will then fly to Jordan.\n\nHe will also perform during the Spring Fling festival.\n\nAfter the success of his first song in the Gulf dialect, Ramy is preparing to launch his second song in the same dialaect. It should be ready in early summer.\n\nVideo thief?\n\nHaifa's new music video is a hot topic in Beirut with allegations of plagiarism flying between directors.\n\nThe Mazzika and Zoom channels will soon start showing Haifa Wehbe's new video clip Matkoulch Li Had. The video, directed by Leila Kanaan, was filmed last year and was shot in just three days.\n\nThe shoot cost Haifa $200,000 (Dh734,400) but created controversy in Beirut, where a very similar music video, directed by Jad Choueiry, was shot for a lesser known singer named Maria.\n\nThe controversy is hot news in Beirut. Leila Kanaan says that Jad Choueiry stole her idea, while Jad Choueiry says that Leila Kanaan has no talent. Maria has said that she is free to do what she pleases.\n\nWhat is Haifa saying? Nothing. She is engaged in charity work.\n\nThe good-hearted Haifa was singing last week at a Unesco theatre to raise money for an association that helps students to continue their studies.\n\nCharity distraction\n\nNot only was the huge Unesco theatre full of people, but Haifa did not accept a penny for her performance.\n\nA few weeks ago, a famous Lebanese actor was very ill, and several performers were raising money on TV to pay for his medical expenses. Haifa quietly proposed to pay the entire bill, which was almost $50,000 (Dh183,600). Haifa didn't want anyone to know, but the TV anchor who was raising the money divulged the truth later."
