        "text": "Artist\n\nLebanon\n\nPlay all tracks\n\nWatch all videos\n\nIN THE CHARTS\n\n#34 - Top 40 for Middle Eastern Influence Tale'ne (track)\n\n#19 - Top 40 for Middle Eastern Influence Aiwa Di Ana (track)\n\n#18 - Top 40 for Middle Eastern Influence Arrab Men Albi (track)\n\nTRACKS\n\nVIDEOS\n\nABOUT\n\nDominique is a Lebanese pop star, former top model, beauty queen, and actress who is considered one of the sexiest beauty and elegance idols in the Arab world.\n\nDominique, who is also the daughter of the well-known prominent Lebanese writer, archaeologist, and historian Youssef Hourany, was born on August 7 in Yaroun in the south of Lebanon. She holds an MBA degree from the Lebanese American University in addition to two other degrees in psychology and accounting. Throughout her childhood, Dominique loved fashion and art and always dreamed of performing on stage in front of thousands of fans and being on the covers of magazines, of course with big constructive messages to deliver to society. Her charming mixture of European and Oriental features and amazing body measurements made her win the title of Miss Intercontinental 2003 in over 80 countries. And in a few years, Dominique became the Arab worldâ€™s first top model, posing for international brands in Milan, Paris, and Turkey. Dominique returned to Lebanon after she determined that she couldn't trade her Eastern roots and the warmth of her homeland, Lebanon, not even for all the success and fortunes of the world. As a first stepping stone toward the real world of fame, Dominique starred in the hit series \"Oyoun Kha'ena\" (The Eyes of the Deceiver), alongside famous TV presenter Tony Khalife. The series, which was broadcast in Lebanon and the Arab World on LBC, was a big hit with high audience ratings, and it helped Dominique establish herself as an actress and as a sexy Arab idol. Dominique then decided it was time to start working on her real big dream: singing; thus, she took the Arabic fame world by storm once more by filming her first video for the song \"Farfoura\". \"Farfoura\" also gave Dominique her nickname, which means butterfly in the Lebanese dialect. With her extreme and fast success that her singles were able to achieve, her debut album \"Atriss\" songs climbed to number one in most song chart shows and stayed there for weeks, and with her hit song \"Khachouka\", Dominique traveled to America to perform on a stage of dreams at the Arab Festival concert in Michigan with more than 70,000 people attending. Dominique's second album in 2008, \"Kermalik Ya Dominique,\" was ranked at the top of sales in the Arab world. In 2010, Dominique and Ali El Deek had their first duet song \"El Natoor,\" another hit song that stayed for more than 6 months at the top of the charts on radios and websites in various countries. Dominique was listed that summer second with the number of concerts. In the same year, our beloved artist starred in her first movie \"El Beeh Romancy\" along with Mohamed Adel Emam, Hasan Housni, Lebleba, and Saad El Soghaier. The romantic-comedy movie, which was produced by El Subki, gave Dominique wide success in Egypt and the Arab World, especially after her famous scene in the movie where she played the role of a girl from Saeid haunted by the ghost of the football player Messi, that is how she gained in Egypt the new title \"Messi\". Throughout those years, Dominique gained many prizes and titles by different media sources and statistics all over the Middle East and that's for her unique stunning looks and performance and beloved hit songs and lately she was considered by French and Kurdish TVs as one of the great influences on the Arab woman's looks, lifestyle, and elegance. Nowadays, pop star Dominique, who also sings in Arabic, English, French, and Italian, is being hosted by the main TV shows and she constantly holds concerts all over the world. It is important to mention that her songs are being played at most weddings and private ceremonies, that is of course due to their happy dance beat and to the place she gained in the audience's heart. Not to forget, our beloved Oriental Princess is often booked for tours in America, Canada, Australia, and she also performs at private and public big events in Arab and European countries like Dubai, France, Britain, Germany, Qatar, Bahrain, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, and many others, of course accompanied by her big musical band led by Dani Abou Khalil and her professional group of dancers to make your special occasions a memorable experience never to forget.\n\nDominique is now the face of an international cosmetics company for the next 3 years. Dominique filmed the first commercial for the brand in Thailand. She was also chosen as a face for a beauty specialist in Kuwait and is currently preparing to present her TV program."
