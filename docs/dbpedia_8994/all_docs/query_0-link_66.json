In June 1983 my unit was sent to take over a strategically located villa in the predominantly Christian village of Kfar Falous, a beautiful and picturesque area, 15 km east of Sidon. It was a year after the Israeli invasion into Lebanon and the new political order Ariel Sharon was crafting for Lebanon was already blowing up in his soldiers’ faces and in the faces of tens of thousands of Lebanese civilians and militiamen. This operation was targeted against the Christian Phalanges in the region, who, for a reason that was not all clear to me — I was only a peon, straight after basic training — acted too independently. We were told in the brieﬁng that the operation was meant to demonstrate to the Phalanges who was calling the shots. We were not allowed to use our weapons since we operated within a friendly environment and it was no more than a disagreement between allies. Within a few moments after the beginning of the operation we were surrounded by hundreds of these friendly civilians who showed up from all corners and would not let us assume control of the villa. We played cat and mouse with them for the entire day until an agreement was reached between senior Israeli and Phalanges ofﬁcers. The civilians eventually left and we spent a full week in this villa, the most peaceful week I had spent in Lebanon throughout my entire service. During this week I had the chance to get to know some of these Phalanges. With my then-broken Arabic and their broken English (unfortunately, I did not know a word in French, a language they seemed to have mastered), I learned from some of them that they were not Arabs, that they were Phoenicians. Some told me they hated Muslims and Arabs, others took pride in massacres of Palestinians in which they participated. I was stunned and dismayed. They looked perfectly Arab to me, but what did I know back then? I was barely nineteen years old with very little understanding of Middle East issues, let alone identities. The conversations with them remained imprinted in my mind because it was the only time during my entire service in which I had the chance to actually speak to Lebanese. Ten years later, I was an MA student at the Department of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, looking for a topic for my thesis. By then I had started to be intrigued by the region’s multiple layers of identities. The Canaanite movement in Israel fascinated me and I was looking for similar phenomena in Arab society. The Phoenicians from Kfar Falous suddenly resurfaced from the back drawers of my memory. These “Phoenician” Phalanges ended up being the inspiration of my MA, and later PhD theses, and ﬁnally this book. I am not sure that if they ever read this book they would like my conclusions but, nevertheless, I suppose that in the very long list of acknowledgements I should begin with them. The majority of this study is based on my Ph.D. dissertation written at Brandeis University. Words would not be enough to thank my advisor\n\nx\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nAvigdor Levy for his assistance and encouragement. I am also indebted to the other members of the committee, Yitzhak Nakash, Kanan Makiya and Sadik al-Azm. I only wish that this remarkable Arab-Israeli cooperation could be manifested in other ﬁelds of life as well. The ﬁnal polish of the study was completed during my post-doctorate at the Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. I am particularly thankful for its director, Amnon Cohen, for his support upon my arrival at the Institute and during the entire duration of my work on this study. The Truman Institute also provided me with ﬁnancial assistance for the editing of the text for which I am most grateful. I am also very appreciative to the Elie Kedourie Memorial Fund of the British Academy for ﬁnancing the last necessary stretch of the research. I have inﬁnite gratitude to Lisa Perlman for the editorial work and for her personal touch; and also to Ann Nichols for crossing the t’s and dotting the i’s. I am also very indebted to Reuven Amitai, who was the head of the Department of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies when I returned home to Israel. I will always remember and cherish his personal involvement in my professional advancement. Other members of the Hebrew University community deserve my gratitude. Moshe Ma’oz who accompanied my progress since I was his MA student; Elie Podeh who helped with advice about publishing and editing; Miri Hoexter who wisely advised me to change some of the headings; and Yusri Khaizaran who enriched this study through material he freely shared with me from his own research. I am also particularly grateful to Nadim Shehadi, the director of the Centre for Lebanese Studies in Oxford, who was always there when I needed a key to decipher the complex nature of the Lebanese society. The staff of many archives and libraries, “the unknown soldiers” of scholarly works, made this project possible. Among them are the Archives of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nantes and Paris, the Archives of the Jesuit Order in Vanves, the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem, the National Libraries in France and Israel and the library of the University of Arizona in Tucson, where I sat and wrote the majority of the text, having access to the abundant wealth of American libraries through the free use of the interlibrary loan system. Such research was indeed made possible in part by support from the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts, College of Arts and Letters, University of Notre Dame. Personal friends were always helpful, some with information and advice, others with moral support.

And ﬁnally those who made me who I am. My parents Aviva and Shimon, and my beloved sister and brother Rama and Amir. And ﬁnally, my son El’ad who was born a few months before the ﬁrst edition of the book came out and brought a whole new perspective to my life.

Al-Hariri is mentioned twice in this book—on the ﬁrst page and in the concluding chapter—in the context of illustrations of the dissemination of the Phoenician narrative in Lebanon throughout wide sectors of the society that, while fully and unapologetically viewing Lebanon as an Arab state, still endorse speciﬁc national traits identiﬁed with Phoenicianism: Lebanon as the cradle of Mediterranean civilizations, as a republic of merchants, as a bridge between East and West, and as a business and leisure hub for its Arab neighbors thanks to its relative openness and permissiveness. The assassination of Raﬁq al-Hariri was more than the killing of a political ﬁgure by his adversaries. It reﬂected the struggle between two different approaches to Lebanon as a national and political community. The late Lebanese journalist Gebran Tueni, who shared the same tragic fate as al-Hariri, described this as a struggle between Hong Kong, epitomized by al-Hariri, and Hanoi, epitomized by Hizballah.1 Nadim Shehadi, another Lebanese intellectual, also used metaphors to describe the two “projects” that have dominated Lebanon since the end of the civil war in 1990. “For the past two decades,” Shehadi wrote, “two competing projects have been running in parallel in Lebanon. One aims at building a Riviera, a Monaco of the eastern Mediterranean; the other a Citadel or bunker, at the frontline of confrontation with Israel and the United States.”2 According to Shehadi, the Riviera camp, whose prime architect was al-Hariri, would like to resurrect the pre-civil war cosmopolitan and prosperous Lebanon, in which Beirut functioned as a ﬁnancial and business centre. Conversely, the Citadel project, led by Hizballah, envisions Lebanon as a strong and militarized state that serves as the spearhead of Arab and Islamic resistance to Israel, or the “usurping entity,” and the United States. In many respects, the Riviera project was modelled after the ideas and vision of Michel Chiha, one of the most important politicians and thinkers who shaped Lebanon’s political system during the mandate years (19201943) and in their aftermath. Chiha envisioned Lebanon as a “Riviera,” where Beirut, the Levantine cosmopolitan city par excellence, would operate as an economic, cultural and intellectual hub of the Middle East. As demonstrated in this book, Chiha linked this vision of the country to a particular historical model that emphasized the age-old experience of Lebanon as the historical bedrock of the “Riviera” along the Mediterranean\n\nxii\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nSea. Chiha was not a separatist Christian Lebanese, as were some of the supporters of the Phoenician narrative whose stories are recounted in this book. Although he belonged to the Francophone, haute-bourgeoisie circles of Beirut, who at times felt more comfortable in Paris than in any Arab city in the Middle East (other than their own city, Beirut), he was fully cognizant that for Lebanon to survive in the region, it could not turn its back on its Arab neighbors. Consequently, he opposed the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine and reached out to Sunni politicians, haute-bourgeoisie like himself, in a bid to enable Lebanon to exist as a viable political community. Al-Hariri, a conservative nouveau riche Sunni Muslim with an Arab-Islamic education from an impoverished family, hailed from an entirely different socio-economic, religious and educational background, yet he came to embody many (though by no means all) of the ideas about the identity of Lebanon that had ﬁrst been espoused by Chiha some 50-60 years earlier. Accordingly, the assassins of al-Hariri were attempting to kill not only the politician but also the idea of Lebanon that he personiﬁed. Chiha’s version of Lebanon’s national identity, some aspects of which were shared by al-Hariri, remained dominant at least until the eruption of the civil war in 1975. This national identity left little to no place for the country’s Shi‘i community. The Shi‘a, the most impoverished, disenfranchised and geographically and socio-economically marginalized community in Lebanon, have developed their own form of Lebanese nationalism, which places them at the centre of the Lebanese “nation” as a subaltern community that emphasizes its Arab and Islamic identities.3 To achieve this objective, they had to challenge at least two versions of Lebanese nationalism, both of which can be traced to the 1943 National Pact that shaped the country’s political system until 1990. The ﬁrst was developed mainly by Christians (largely, but not only Maronites, as Chiha exempliﬁes) during the country’s ﬁrst forty years (1920s-1960s). It emphasized the section in the 1943 National Pact that stated that Lebanon “assimilates all that is beneﬁcial and useful in Western civilization.”4 The second was espoused by urban Sunnis such as Riad al-Sulh, one of the drafters of the Pact, and al-Hariri (both from Sidon and, incidentally, both assassinated by Syrian sympathizers), and it emphasized the section in the Pact deﬁning Lebanon as a country with an “Arab face.” Although al-Sulh was a member of the “old money” Sunni elite and was educated in French missionary schools whereas al-Hariri only joined this class during the civil war, they shared a vision of Lebanon’s Arab identity. Their Arabism was Sunnicentred but they saw Lebanon as a secular polity with close ties to the West and in particular to France. It was expected that the Shi‘a—and by extension their main political parties, Hizballah and Amal—would reject these two interconnected visions of Lebanon’s national identity and come up with their own version\n\nPREFACE TO THE NEW PAPERBACK EDITION\n\nxiii\n\nof Lebanese nationalism. Because of Lebanon’s multi-religious composition and the inherent sectarianism that shaped its political life, Lebanese society has always faced the challenge of ﬁnding a shared national identity and historical narrative that most if not all of its citizens can endorse. The political ascendancy of Hizballah (and the Shi‘i community in general), has only exacerbated this challenge, as the Shi‘i organization has rejected the old national narratives, seeking to replace them with its own, and has even linked its version of Lebanese nationalism to an eternal struggle against Israel, thus placing Lebanon, at the very frontline in the conﬂict against the Jewish state. After Israel withdrew from South Lebanon in 2000, the tension between Hizballah’s “Lebanon project” and that of al-Hariri only intensiﬁed. Hizballah’s insistence on maintaining its special status as an armed militia has exposed the fact that its “resistance” was not only against the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon, but was part of a strategic plan to use the struggle against Israel as a means of placing (Shi‘i) Islam and Arabism at the centre of the country’s identity, thereby jettisoning the Riviera project. Such a Lebanon would have no room for any hallucinations about age-old, pre-Arab and pre-Islamic cultures, nor would it accept softer versions of these Riviera-like fantasies as espoused by al-Hariri. An examination of two diametrically opposed projects reveals the difference between Hizballah’s and al-Hariri’s visions of Lebanon. Both projects—the reconstruction of Beirut Central District (BCD) by Raﬁq alHariri’s ﬁrm, Solidere, and the construction of Hizballah’s resistance memorial site in Mleeta—were intended to evoke speciﬁc memories and a sense of heritage. Since 1994, Solidere has been in charge of rebuilding downtown Beirut, an area that was largely destroyed during the civil war, with the aim of restoring its previous glory as a tourist and ﬁnancial centre (tourism and ﬁnance being the two largest proﬁt-making sectors in Lebanon) of Lebanon and even the entire Middle East. In this project, which was endorsed by the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism, not only was the impact of the civil war almost entirely obliterated from the reconstructed landscape (paradoxically, it was the devastation caused by the war that enabled the reconstruction project), but amid the reconstructed buildings, archaeological sites have been excavated and preserved as open-space exhibits. These sites expose the ancient Phoenician, Hellenic and Roman eras of Beirut (while ignoring other eras), presenting them as Lebanon’s national and historical heritage. Just south of BCD, Lebanon’s national museum, also part of the post-civil war reconstruction project, conveys a similar message about Lebanon’s national heritage through exhibits that emphasize these ancient eras and downplay other historical eras. Thus, the urban landscape of BCD presents an image of Lebanon as a modern, Westerninspired society whose historical legacy goes back to these ancient\n\nxiv\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nMediterranean civilizations. This image of Lebanon, which for decades had been associated with exclusively Lebanist, Maronite-inspired nationalism, has been promoted by Solidere, a company controlled by Sunni urbanites who embraced the broader historical and cosmopolitan narrative because it serves their ﬁnancial and political interests.5 Needless to say, the post-civil war reconstruction project of Beirut completely ignores the predominantly Shi‘i neighborhoods in southern Beirut. Conversely, Hizballah’s Resistance Tourist Landmark in Mleeta, which like BCD has been sanctioned by the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism, focuses on entirely different memories and heritage. Constructed in a predominantly Shi‘i region south east of Sidon in South Lebanon, where major hostilities took place between Hizballah and Israel during 19822000, the site serves as a museum commemorating the armed resistance against the Jewish state.6 As Mona Harb and Lara Deeb argue, Mleeta’s resistance memorial is part of Hizballah’s effort to establish a Shi‘i Islamic milieu (al-hala al-Islamiyya) in Lebanon, which they deﬁne as “the physical and symbolic spaces within which pious Shi‘a live out a particular ‘state of being,’ the public sphere where its norms and values are debated and shaped, and the ‘state of being’ itself with its continually shifting moral norms.”7 This site (like other cultural projects of Hizballah such as the museum of Al-Khiam prison, which Harb and Deeb also analyze) aims to educate Lebanese and foreigners about a different history and evoke utterly different memories from the ones Solidere promotes. As the homepage of Mleeta’s website states, Being the ﬁrst of its kind, this place carves the memory of a continual stage in the history of Lebanon. This is a natural museum, surrounded by the captivating nature and mountains. Its aim is to preserve the places where the Mujahideen lived, giving people the chance to be acquainted with the style of the unique experience of the Islamic resistance against the Israeli enemy, since its occupation of Beirut in 1982.8\n\nThe hundreds of thousands of tourists who have visited the Mleeta resistance memorial since its inauguration on 25 May 2010, the tenth anniversary of Israel’s withdrawal from South Lebanon, are not only exposed to the history of the Islamic resistance, but are also encouraged to continue their support for the unremitting struggle, which will only end with the destruction of Israel. In the struggle between the “Hanoi” and the “Hong Kong” camps, Phoenicianism as a non-Arab national identity for Lebanon has fallen out of grace. The rising inﬂuence of Shi‘i and Sunni Islamism in the country has reinforced the drift away from any narrative that negates Arabism and Islam as essential elements in Lebanon’s national identity.9 Nonetheless, there are Lebanese who still toy with the Phoenician project in a bid to challenge the\n\nPREFACE TO THE NEW PAPERBACK EDITION\n\nxv\n\npolitical and cultural trajectory toward which these Islamist movements aspire to take Lebanon. In recent years modern science was recruited for this cause. Like other national movements that have resorted to DNA and genetics research to demonstrate their age-old existence as viable national communities,10 some Lebanese have invoked the science of genetics, arguing that the ties between modern Lebanese and the ancient inhabitants of their land, the Phoenicians, are not only historical or cultural, but also biological. Lebanese scientists from the Lebanese American University joined the much-publicized global project conducted by National Geographic to study genetic imprints of indigenous populations around the world.11 They collected blood samples from men in Lebanon, Syria, Malta, Tunisia and other areas where the ancient Phoenicians once dwelled, and they concluded that Phoenician DNA imprints could still be found among residents of these locales. Such DNA studies in Lebanon or elsewhere may have a scientiﬁc aura,12 yet they also reﬂect a strong political agenda as they are never carried out innocently for the sake of pure science, but rather in order to justify speciﬁc arguments with regard to the nation’s ancient pedigree. The Lebanese DNA study has gained signiﬁcant attention in Lebanese, Arab and international media,13 bringing back to the fore the endless “are we Arabs or Phoenicians?” debates, which are always more politically driven than historiographically or scientiﬁcally based. To be sure, neither Hizballah’s “Islamic milieu” nor the Sunni Islamist circles in Tripoli and elsewhere in the country take part in these debates. For the latter, the question of Lebanon’s identity has been sealed; it is clear and undisputed. Since the start of the Arab uprisings in December 2010, the Middle East has entered a new era that will undoubtedly transform the political, social and cultural makeup of the region. Islamist parties throughout the Middle East are gaining ground, some through democratic procedures, others through violence. At the time of writing, Syria is torn in a vicious civil war whose end and outcome are not yet clear and Lebanon is gradually drifting into the chaos of its neighbour. The Islamist elements of the Syrian opposition are growing stronger by the day and Lebanese Shi‘i and Sunni Islamists are being drawn into the conﬂict as well, supporting the two opposing sides of the war in Syria. Lebanon’s viability as a nation-state has long been disputed, and similar questions now surround Syria, with the possibility that in the post-Asad era it will not be able to sustain itself as a united polity. Should Syria disintegrate, it is likely that Lebanon would be drawn even further into the fray. In such an atmosphere and political state of affairs, reﬂections about the ancient history of Lebanon (or Syria) and its relevance for the country’s current national identity become not only a luxury but practically irrelevant. What might remain is nostalgia for a Middle East that existed not too long ago, when religious extremism and xenophobic nationalism were the exception rather than the rule. In fact, this\n\nxvi\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nwave of nostalgia had already begun even before the outbreak of the Arab uprisings. The Levant as a geographical and cultural unit of analysis has been central to this wave of nostalgia for the old Middle East. Books were written,14 journals were launched,15 conferences were held and centres were established,16 all focusing on the Levant, the eastern Mediterranean that roughly includes contemporary Egypt, Israel/Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey and Greece. These scholarly and popular initiatives focus on the cosmopolitan lifestyle that dominated this region until the 1950s and in which Beirut, Alexandria, Haifa, Aleppo, Istanbul, Smyrna and other cities were linked in a web of multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-lingual communities whose boundaries were more ﬂexible and permeable than they are today. The ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean Sea are a salient aspect of this Levantine awakening, which seeks to challenge contemporary national historiographies that present the region as homogenous and unitary (Arab nationalism), or that are exclusive and militant (Zionism). Although they over-romanticize the Levant and Levantinism, they still offer an alternative to the contemporary Middle East that has been ravaged by multiple predicaments such as the Arab-Israeli conﬂict, the Sunni-Shi‘i divide, religious-secular tensions, gender biases and socio-economic stagnation. Looking ahead to an era of shifting sands, which gives rise to hopes as well as major concerns for the region, romanticism may be seen as escapism, but may also be a reminder that the violent trajectory toward which the Middle East appears headed is not inevitable. Reviving Phoenicia tells a story about this cosmopolitan Middle East, and while trying not to overly romanticize that time period, and recognizing its shortcomings, the book does remind us that not too long ago things in the Middle East in general and Lebanon in particular were different. Phoenicia, obviously, cannot be revived, but we should hope that at least some elements of the cosmopolitanism that is depicted in this book could.\n\nNotes * The printing of this edition was made possible in part by support from the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts, College of Arts and Letters, University of Notre Dame. 1.

But they constitute a sine qua non: there can be no identity without memory (albeit selective), no collective purpose without myth, and identity and purpose or destiny are necessary elements of the very concept of a nation. Anthony Smith1\n\nThe historical narrative of Lebanon almost invariably begins with the ancient Phoenician seafarers. History textbooks, government publications and full genres of literature and research resolutely follow this path. Lebanon has a history of 6,000 years, they affirm. It begins with the Phoenicians in preBiblical times, then proceeds into other eras — Persian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, Turkish, French — concluding in modern times when Lebanon regains its independence. One of the official websites of Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri well reflects this conviction: “We are heirs to a history which spans thousands of years and whose beginnings are lost in the mists of time itself,” Hariri writes in his address to his fellow Lebanese, “The alphabet was born in our land. It was from the shores of Sidon and Tyre that sailors ventured to establish the first Mediterranean empire.”2 The assertion that Lebanon’s history, even as an Arab country, begins with the ancient Phoenicians has almost become conventional wisdom. Even historians who oppose this narrative fall into its description. As‘ad AbuKhalil, for example, in his Historical Dictionary of Lebanon, writes in the introduction: “Lebanese ultra-nationalists, who have dominated the official historiography of the country, claim that Lebanon has been in continued existence for over 5000 years and that the present-day country is no more than an extension of the ancient Phoenician kingdom(s). In reality Lebanon is a modern phenomenon; [...].”3 The book, however, unfolds with a chronological list, beginning with the Canaanite occupation of Sidon and Tyre in 2800 BC and continuing to the Egyptian occupation of the Phoenician coast, the Phoenician expansion towards the sea, the founding of Carthage, the most famous Phoenician colony, and so forth, demonstrating the power of the Phoenician narrative that infiltrated even studies that defy it as a figment of the Lebanese ultra-nationalist imagination. The present study is an attempt to uncover the social, political and intellectual origins and the development of the phenomenon of Phoenicianism\n\n2\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nin Lebanon. As in the case of other communities, Lebanese nationalists scrutinized the past to create a narrative that would justify the existence of Lebanon as a viable national community based on age-old historical memories and a proud pedigree. The Phoenician identity was born out of this need, but it soon became one of the major points of contention between and within the different communities, which, since Lebanon’s creation in 1920, have been competing with each other to define their country’s national identity. Although this study has nothing to do with the ancient Phoenicians it seems essential to provide a short summary as to who these ancient inhabitants of Lebanon were and why they were so appealing to their modern counterparts. A survey of national movements in the Middle East followed by two brief discussions on selective theories of nationalism and French colonialism provide a general overview and a backdrop for the understanding of Phoenicianism in a broader context. The Introduction concludes with an outline of the study’s structure.\n\nWho Were the Phoenicians? The ancient inhabitants of Lebanon did not call themselves Phoenicians.4 This term is of Greek origin, appearing for the first time in Greek texts in the 9th century BC; its meaning is still not fully clear. The most accepted explanation, although by no means the only one, is that the Greek word phoinix, meaning “red,” alludes to the purple textile industry for which the ancient inhabitants of Lebanon were made famous. The Phoenicians actually called themselves Canaanites and their land Canaan, at least until the 1st century AD as documented in the New Testament where it is written that Jesus reached the borders of Tyre and Sidon and cured there a Canaanite woman.5 The term Cna‘ani in Biblical Hebrew implies a merchant, which suggests that, as with the Greek word phoinix, the name of the country may have derived from the most popular profession of the ancient Lebanese — commerce. These Canaanite-Phoenicians were also often identified according to the city to which they belonged: Sidonites, Tyrians, Giblites and so forth, reflecting the fact that their cities never gained political unity but rather remained independent city-states. Historians and archeologists tend to mark the beginning of the Phoenician era in the late Bronze Age and the beginning of the Early Iron Age, around 1200 BC. The Phoenician cities were in existence more than a millennium earlier, but around the 12th century, the Near East went through a major sociopolitical upheaval that reshaped the entire region and forced the Phoenician cities to orient towards the Mediterranean Sea. In just one century, the land of Canaan experienced the arrival of three peoples: the Israelites from the south, who settled in the heartland; the Philistines (or the Peoples of the Sea) from the Greek Islands, who settled along the southern shores of Canaan; and the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nArameans who came from Mesopotamia and settled in the north. These three invasions left no space for the Phoenicians but the coastal range in the northern part of Canaan. Thus, Phoenicia was defined as the small strip of land stretching from the island of Arvad (the ancient Aradus) in the north to Akko (Acre) and Mount Carmel in the south. The eastern border of Phoenicia was Mount Lebanon that runs roughly parallel to the coast, creating a very narrow and clearly-circumscribed territory between the Mediterranean and the Mountain. From the 12th century BC until the Greek occupation of Phoenicia in 334 AD, the Mediterranean trade routes were practically all controlled by Phoenician seafarers. They established colonies on the major islands in the Mediterranean basin and in today’s Greece, Italy, France, Spain and North Africa. The most notable of these was, of course, Carthage (Keret Hadata, New Polis), located in today’s Tunisia. Their network of colonies throughout the Mediterranean put the entire basin under one socio-economic system and for the first time in human history it was possible to speak about a “Mediterranean civilization.” They perfected the art of sailing and navigating, the use of glass, fabric and many other crafts, which they borrowed from different civilizations in their trade along the Mediterranean. Despite what is commonly believed, the Phoenicians did not invent the alphabet, but they were the last in a line of Semitic peoples to refine it in form and in number of letters and then to export it to Greece. This was undoubtedly their most important achievement and contribution to the intellectual development of humankind. One of the most intriguing questions about the Phoenicians that preoccupied the modern Lebanese concerned their origin. The Phoenicians were a Semitic people who spoke a Semitic language that belonged to the Western-Semitic family, very similar to ancient Hebrew.6 Herodotus, who visited Tyre in 450 BC, recounts that the people of the city informed him that they arrived in the region twenty-five centuries earlier from the Red Sea. His account substantiates the popular and polemical thesis that the entire Semitic population of the Near East emigrated from the Arabian Peninsula in endless waves of migration, the last of which was the Arab-Islamic wave in the 7th century AD.7 This thesis caused some Arab nationalists and demographers to assert that all the ancient peoples of the Middle East were actually Arabs and that the terms “Arab” and “Semite” are, therefore, synonymous. It enabled them to claim that the Arab-Islamic conquest brought a new faith to a land that ethnically was already their own. It is not difficult to imagine what the reaction to this claim was by Lebanese nationalists and other centrifugal forces within the Arab world. Another interesting scholarly — yet often politically motivated — debate about the ancient Phoenicians (whose history is as lengthy as the tomes of modern research on them and had a tremendous impact on the modern Phoenician-Lebanese view of the past) centers on the question of their influence on ancient Greek civilization. From the 18th century, European\n\n4\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nintellectuals exhibited a growing interest in ancient Greece, depicting it as the cradle of Western-European civilization and portraying its population as Aryan, the first link in the noble European racial chain. There were, however, a few French scholars who, although they regarded themselves as the legitimate heirs of Plato and Aristotle, still viewed Greek civilization as more than simply the product of a European endeavor. The scholar and journalist Victor Bérard was among the most influential classicists to write about the role of the Phoenicians in the formation of Greek civilization. In his works he demonstrated that, to a large extent, Hellenic religion and mythology were of Semitic origin, more precisely of Phoenician-Egyptian seed.8 In 1902, Bérard published Les Phéniciens et l’Odyssée, in which he described the Odyssey as a travelogue written by a seafarer sitting on the deck of a Phoenician trireme and noting the different events he witnessed along the way. By and large, Bérard’s theories were rejected by the Hellenic scholarly establishment, but, as we shall see, they were welcomed with open arms by Lebanese nationalists who viewed them as proof of the fact that they were the ones who should be credited as the cradle of Western civilization. A little more than a decade ago a new and controversial study, Black Athena, brought Bérard’s ideas back to life arguing that the glory days of the Hellenic world were a direct product of Phoenician and Egyptian — i.e., Semitic — civilizations and that scholars have deliberately ignored this fact because it undermines the very foundations of Western civilization.9 Whether Bernal, the author of Black Athena, was accurate or not, it should be remembered that all scholars agree that the ancient Phoenicians had some impact on Greek civilization, by the sheer fact that for 1,000 years they controlled most of the trade in the Mediterranean, which means that even a lofty civilization such as the Greeks could not have ignored their presence and preeminence. In the millennium that marked Phoenician domination in the Mediterranean basin, the Phoenicians developed and attained a clear sense of being a “people,” despite the fact that they never lived in one unified political system.10 They spoke and wrote in the same language, they worshiped similar gods, conducted similar rituals related to birth, death and burial, and collaborated with each other in their commercial enterprises. Following the Macedonian-Greek occupation in 334 BC, the Phoenician civilization slowly declined and cleared the way for Greek and Roman domination. The Phoenician-Canaanite language was replaced by Greek and Aramaic and, similarly, the Phoenician religion was superceded by Greek and later Roman pantheons. The Phoenicians disappeared as a people not because of a major trauma such as expulsion or plague, but rather by a slow process of adaptation to the new political reality. In Greek and Roman eras, the land of Phoenicia continued to flourish. BeirutBerytus became one of the world’s most important intellectual centers through the Roman School of Law, while Tyre and Sidon continued to prosper in trade, with the entire Roman Empire open to their commercial skills. An indication of the rich Greek and Roman civilizations in Phoenicia can be\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nseen in the archeological sites of that era that are scattered throughout Lebanon, most notably the Temple of Balbeck. Despite the fact that the Phoenician era is clearly circumscribed between the 12th century BC and the Greek occupation in the 3rd century BC, the neo-Phoenicians, who are the focus of this study, held a broader interpretation of the time span of this era. Thus, for example, the city of Ugarit, which prospered in the 16th-15th centuries BC and declined by the 14th century BC, was incorporated into the Phoenician civilization; and the Greek and Roman eras were “Phoenicianized” as well. It was a tendency to view the entire ancient time as one historical unit, separated by different foreign conquests but united through the one gifted people that dwelt in the land of Phoenicia. Some of the modern ultra-Phoenicians claimed that the Phoenician era never ceased to exist and today’s Lebanese are as Phoenician as their ancient ancestors.\n\nNational Identities in the Arab Middle East Studies on Lebanon and the Lebanese national movement demonstrated for years continuity between four hundred years of political autonomy in Mount Lebanon and the establishment of Greater Lebanon in 1920.11 These studies asserted that a certain collective identity was formed in the Mountain since the time of Fakhr al-Din al-Ma‘ni (1590-1635), an identity that radiated to the coastal strip and the Biqa‘ region. By interpreting the history of Lebanon in this way, these works actually claimed that the idea of a Lebanese state in its current borders was, in fact, historically viable. Modern Lebanon was not formed in a vacuum. Its national movement has had its roots deep in the socio-political history of Mount Lebanon. Many of the advocates of this narrative were Lebanese historians who wrote their country’s history justifying Lebanon’s existence as a national community.12 This kind of historiography was also a result of genuine belief in the Lebanese political system before the eruption of the civil war in 1975. Even more recent studies, written during and after the civil war, still supported the view that modern Lebanon was founded on a lengthy historical experience of Maronite ethnic cohesiveness in Mount Lebanon which functioned as the basis for the foundation of the Lebanese state.13 A recent study by Carol Hakim-Dowek, The Origins of the Lebanese National Idea, 1840-1914,14 persuasively demonstrates that in fact the Lebanist idea was relatively novel and its formation was by no means linear. HakimDowek shows in her work that Lebanism — the idea of an independent political framework with Mount Lebanon as its core — appeared for the first time in 1840. It was raised by Maronite clergy but faded away soon thereafter as a result of the political settlements of the double Qai’maqamiyya in 1842 and the Mutasarrifiyya, the autonomous region, in 1861.15 Having been articulated by the Church, Lebanism was envisioned as a Christian conservative political\n\n6\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nframework, controlled by the Maronite clergy. According to her research, Lebanism reappeared in a laical form only at the beginning of the 20th century as a result of primarily internal social problems within the Mutasarrifiyya. Christian Lebanese of the new secular and educated elite, residing either in Lebanon or in various Syro-Lebanese immigrant communities in Egypt and in the Americas, were promoting the idea of an extended autonomous region of Lebanon in a larger Syrian political framework. Their point of departure was a general dislike of the social and political situation in the Mutasarrifiyya, which they attributed to the deficiency of the religious establishments. The autonomous region was controlled by the Maronite clergy and the traditional notable families; the new, emerging stratum challenged their authority while at the same time aimed to expand the autonomous territory. At first, Lebanism was not expressed as an alternative to Ottomanism. Its advocates were asking for administrative reforms and border revisions within the context of the Ottoman Empire. It took almost an additional twenty years before these demands turned into an appeal for the formation of an independent Lebanese state, and before the Maronite Church made this Lebanism its official platform and led the movement for the formation of an independent Lebanese state. Thus, Hakim-Dowek depicts a non-linear development of the Lebanist idea demonstrating that Christian Lebanese, in and out of Mount Lebanon and Beirut, held different views about the political solution of the “Lebanese question” until early 1919. Only then did most political forces join together in their demand for the establishment of an independent state. Lebanism, and Lebanese national sentiments, were born and developed alongside other collective identities in the Arab Middle East, most notably Ottomanism, Syrianism, Arabism and Islamism. For many years, historians of the Middle East gave much weight to the Arab identity as a powerful political force in the Arab provinces of the declining Ottoman Empire.16 They saw Arabism as a secular movement led by Syro-Lebanese who, equipped with Western education, reacted to the encroaching measures of the Ottomans, first to the oppressing policies of Sultan Abdülhamid and later the “turkifying” attempts of the Young Turks. This interpretation also viewed most of the political developments in the Middle East at that time as reactions and responses to the increase in Arab sentiments. Thus, the rise of non-Arab sentiments among some Christian Lebanese was also seen as a reaction to the growing strength of Arabism rather than as an independent desire emanating from a socio-political reality within Lebanon. However, it has been long understood that this kind of interpretation overemphasized the strength of Arabism, under-emphasized the power of loyalty to the Ottoman Empire and almost entirely disregarded local territorial sentiments in geographical Syria. The established narrative today is that Ottomanism remained the strongest focus of allegiance until the end of World War I among the majority of the Syrian population. Arab national sentiments, founded on the writings of Islamic reformists, existed before 1914, but by no\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nmeans did they win the overwhelming support of the local elite. This elite turned Arabist only with the fall of the Empire, after 1918. Their Arabism was not based on secular ideology, but was actually embedded on Islamic terminology as appeared in the writings of Muslim reformists such as Muhammad ‘Abduh, Jamal al-Din al-Afghani and Rashid Rida.17 Syrian sentiments before 1920 can be divided into three categories: secular Arab Syrianism, Muslim-Arab Syrianism and secular non-Arab Syrianism. Secular Arab Syrianism existed as a geo-political and cultural identity since the 1860s, interwoven with Ottoman and Arab sentiments. Butrus al-Bustani, who advocated Ottomanism and loyalty to the Sublime Porte, was the one who also set the foundation of this identity.18 A leading member of the Arabic Nahda, or renaissance, movement, al-Bustani generated Arabism through Arabic literature as a cultural identity while at the same time he regarded Syria as his watan, or homeland. He defined the inhabitants of Syria (stretching in the north from the Tauros mountains to the Sinai desert in the south, and from the Mediterranean in the west to the Euphrates in the east) as members of one nation who culturally held strong Arab characteristics and who politically belonged to the larger Ottoman Empire.19 He viewed this identity as secular, and shared by Muslims, Christians and Jews alike. During WWI and after, this kind of Syrianism continued to be expressed especially by Christians from Beirut and Mount Lebanon. The 1916 book of the Greek Catholic Nadra Moutran, La Syrie de Demain, to be discussed in Chapter II, arguably encapsulates well this kind of Arab-Syrian secular thought. There were also some Maronites, such as Iskandar ‘Amoun and Ibrahim al-Najjar, who cooperated with Faysal in Damascus in 1918-1920. Similar to al-Bustani sixty years earlier they saw themselves as Arab Syrians and they believed that Lebanon should be given a leading role in a Syrian-Arab federation. The second stream, Muslim Arab Syrianism, added the religious Islamic component to the Syrian identity and viewed Islam and Arabism as its two prime pillars. This stream was best expressed by Rashid Rida, a Syrian-Arab Islamist and a disciple of Muhammad ‘Abduh, who called for the establishment of an Arab Syrian nation based on Islam as its prime pillar of identity (more about him in Chapter V). The Arab government of Faysal in 1918-1920 Damascus was in fact the political manifestation of the ideas of Rashid Rida, who envisioned a larger Arab-Muslim state, but viewed geographical Syria as the first step in attaining this greater plan. Hence, he took an active role in Faysal’s government and in the Syro-Palestinian Congress of Shekib Arslan in Geneva in 1921. The third stream, secular non-Arab Syrianism, existed from the beginning of the 20th century, but emerged as a political force during WWI. Chékri Ganem and Georges Samné, with the ever-present encouragement of the French, advocated for the establishment of a Syrian, non-Arab, federation based on principles of democracy, laicism and decentralization. In their vision, Lebanon would be given an eminent leading role in this federation. This type\n\n8\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nof Syrianism relied heavily on works of French scholars who wrote about the existence of a Syrian nation based on a unity of geography and race. The most notable example of this kind of writing was Elisée Reclus, the French geographer, whose impact on the crystallization of Syrian nationalism was great. In his gigantic work, Nouvelle Géographie Universelle, Reclus wrote about the existence of a Syrian race circumscribed within the limits of geographical Syria and utterly distinct from the Arab race. He depicted the civilization of the ancient world as an axle whose two edges were India on the far east, and France and Britain on the far west. Since antiquity, Reclus maintained, Syria, as a well-defined geographic and racial unit, was located exactly at the center of this axle.20 We shall see in the following chapters that Reclus’ theories were used extensively by supporters of the Syrian identity and especially by the Jesuit teacher Henri Lammens who had many disciples among Lebanese nationalists before and after 1920. It was within this political reality that the Lebanese national idea was formed and articulated. Loyalty to the Ottoman Empire was the strongest force of political identity, whereas regionally most intellectual Lebanese, although conscious of their special political and social status, still perceived themselves part of a larger Syrian framework. Arabism as a national movement was in its seminal stage and, before 1908, the designation “Arab” was still associated with Bedouins and the desert, despite the “awakening” of the Arab literary movement. Until WWI, most Lebanese intellectuals did not call for the establishment of an independent state and if such claims were made, they were mainly in the context of a Syrian federation. Belonging to a geo-political Syrian framework was the dominant view even among Christian Lebanese who, by April 1919, would become the strongest advocates for the formation of an independent Christian, Western-oriented Lebanon. As we shall see in this study, the preoccupation with the Phoenician past in Lebanon and the identification of intellectuals from Beirut as “Phoenicians” commenced decades before “anti-Arab” sentiments were even a possibility, simply because Arabism was not yet a dominant identity that had to be reckoned with.\n\nTheorizing Lebanese Nationalism? Despite the obsessive preoccupation in academia with the attempt to theorize the rise of nationalism in the past two hundred years, there has not been — because there cannot be — one homogenous explanation for this phenomenon, which makes “men and women willing to die for their countries.”21 The rise of nationalism, like all political forces with cultural manifestations, is shaped by specific and local social, economic and political conditions. Even the separation between “classical” or “modular” forms of nationalism that appeared in the West and “special” or “deviant” expressions of nationalism\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nthat emerged in the East and the South do not provide us with two single explanations for the rise of nationalism. Some theories can help us understand some aspects of different national behaviors, but no one theory (or two) can provide a single explanation for the rise and impact of the most powerful and destructive ideology of the 20th century, continuing consistently into the 21st century. It is beyond the point of this study, not to say redundant, to provide an overview of the existing theories of nationalism.22 Likewise, I do not wish to posit this study within these theories in an attempt to find the “proper” matrix for the rise of Lebanese nationalism and its historical narrative. Rather, I selectively chose certain theories and position them alongside Lebanese nationalism in order to clarify some of its notions. I shall start with Anthony Smith who has been labeled, exaggeratedly I believe, as the theoretician closest to the primordialist approach of nationalism.23 Nationalism, for Smith, cannot be explained as a purely modern phenomenon but neither can it be seen and understood as a primordial “natural” occurrence, existing since the beginning of time and expressed in various cultural and political forms. Modernization, according to him, utterly transformed societies and shaped their identities into the modern concept of “nation” as political unit. Yet, at the same time, some modern nations do rest on foundations of a certain collective identity — the ethnie — which he defines as “a named human population possessing a myth of common descent, common historical memories, elements of shared culture, an association with a particular territory and a sense of solidarity.”24 At the core of some national movements one can find an ethnic identity that was in existence centuries before the process of modernization began and that has been used by the local intelligentsia to mobilize the ethnic community into a self-aware national community. In states in which an ethnie did not exist it had to be invented for the modern nation to emerge and survive.25 Smith finds the Maronite community a good example for the concept of ethnie,26 and to a large extent he is right. This community is circumscribed within a well-defined territory — Mount Lebanon. Its historical memories, cultivated by its clergy, are traced back to the 5th century, to Saint Marun, claimed as the father of the Church, and its religious affiliation enhanced its sense of uniqueness not only vis-à-vis its Muslim neighbors, but also vis-àvis the other Eastern churches. Although the ethnie of Smith seems the most suitable to describe the Maronite sense of identity it also fails in ignoring its complexity. It should be remembered that the Maronites, before the 19th century and after, have never been one unified group with one collective will. Often their sense of common identity was weaker than, say, the sense of identity which the Maronite Khazin feudal family shared with other Druze and Sunni feudal families. In addition, as we shall see in this study, the political aspirations of the Maronite church as advocated by its high clergy since the 1840s were not the same as those of lay Maronites who resided in Beirut during the same time. For example, when the brothers Philippe and Farid al-Khazin advocated\n\n10\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nin Beirut in 1910 the establishment of an autonomous greater Lebanon, they based their claim on a laical historical narrative, beginning with the Druze leader, Fakhr al-Din, and not with a traditional Maronite claim (see more in Chapter II). Moreover, as will be discussed, until 1919, most Maronite intellectuals did not call for the establishment of Greater Lebanon but rather viewed Greater Syria as the solution for the “Question of Lebanon.” There has never been one Maronite will. Maronites, just like other sects in Lebanon, operate in the context of intra-sectarian dynamics sometimes even more than inter-sectarian. Thus, despite the fact that the concept of ethnie is helpful in understanding the development of the Lebanist idea, it needs to be remembered that the Maronite ethnies have always been dynamic, multifaceted and sometimes even invented. Nationalism is a modern phenomenon in the sense that it created a sentiment of human allegiance that did not exist before it was formed. It is modern also because in order to spread its message widely and effectively it employs modern means of communication, such as radio, museums, printed material, maps and so forth. However, there are more nations and national movements throughout the world that did not go through a modernizing, industrial revolution than ones that did. In this respect, Ernest Gellner, the arch-modernist theoretician, does not help us to understand nationalism in non-industrialized societies. Focusing on material conditions, Gellner holds that the industrial revolution separates between pre-modernity and modernity and that only following a process of modernization, i.e., the rise of capitalism, bureaucracy and secularism, can a nation emerge. “Nationalism,” according to his much quoted claim, “is not the awakening of nations to self-consciousness: it invents nations where they do not exist.”27 Nationalism, as Gellner states, invented nations in the Middle East. Or more accurately, to use Sami Zubaida’s words, it is the state that created the nation in the Middle East.28 Yet, these “nations,” Lebanon included, were not born in the watershed between pre-modernity and modernity. Societies in the Middle East still await, to this day, their industrial revolution and yet they hold their “nationalism” dearly to the point that they are “prepared to sacrifice their lives for the recognition of their national identities.”29 Moreover, Gellner argues that the nation-state replaces kinship with national identity. However, in Lebanon, as in other Middle Eastern societies, nationalism did not replace kinship, but rather learned to live with it, sometimes in conflict and at other times in agreement. Modernism and secularism were important pillars in Gellner’s theory of nationalism. They were also the prime foundations of Benedict Anderson’s book, Imagined Communities, which has been the touchstone of most studies on nationalism in the last decade, to the point that the word “imagine” and its derivatives are probably by now the most used terms in studies on national movements. Anderson views nationalism as a modern phenomenon, born out of the rise of capitalism. Yet he also provides an innovative angle for understanding it by defining the nation as an “imagined political community.”30\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nIt is imagined, Anderson explains, in the sense that its members will never be able to meet, hear or know the vast majority of the other members of the community, and yet they share a strong sense of belonging to this imagined non-tangible community. Such an analysis enabled Anderson to examine national communities not within the context of their authenticity or lack thereof, but rather in the way they imagine themselves. The concept of “imagining” enables us to do the same. Although, as it will become clear in the study, I view the claims for Phoenician descent in Lebanon as nebulous, I still consider the validity of Phoenicianism, or lack thereof, irrelevant to this study. The main thrust here is to analyze how a community imagined itself and not whether this imagining was historically conceivable. In other words, I am concerned with one aspect of the emergence of national consciousness — the national historical narrative — rather than with the rise of nationalism as a social formation in Lebanon. Anderson’s point of departure in his analysis of the rise of nationalism is twofold: the decline of religion (and in this respect he follows Gellner) and the rise of vernacular languages.31 According to him, religion provided a sense of continuity and enabled people to come to grips with death. The “ebbing of religious belief,” a product of the 18th century Enlightenment, did not reduce the need for continuity among humans which had previously been provided by religion. This is where nationalism came in and provided the secular sense of continuity and belonging. As for vernacular languages, Anderson writes that thanks to the new medium of “print capitalism” it was possible for national communities to abandon their written lingua franca (Latin, in the case of Europe) and to use a unified form of their own vernaculars that, through mass production of printed matter, also helped in shaping the national consciousness of the community. As interesting as these two observations are, they still pose some major problems when applied to the Middle East. It is clear today that the Arab national movement was not born as a secular reaction to the exposure to the West, but actually as a religious Muslim response to the challenges posed by Europe. Similarly, the Lebanese national movement cannot be detached from its Christian religious context. It was the Maronite Patriarch who, in his trip to the Peace Congress in Versailles in 1919, exerted the last necessary pressure on France in favor of the establishment of Greater Lebanon. It was also he who preached in his weekly sermons that “patriotism is a religious practice”(see Chapter I). Moreover, even liberal lay Syro-Lebanese who were in charge of the introduction of Western thought to the region and who cooperated with the Church in 1919 envisioned Lebanon as a Christian dominated entity. Religion was and still is a prime component of all national movements in the Middle East and any attempt to understand nationalism in this region cannot be complete without taking this factor into account. As for language, it seems that the Middle East actually experienced a different process from that in Europe. The rise of the Arab national movement\n\n12\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nactually suppressed the vernacular Arab dialects and, instead, revived and glorified literary Arabic as the lingua franca of all Arabs. Even local national movements in the Arab world did not make an attempt, except in marginal cases, to turn the regional dialects into their national language. This reflects the dichotomy in which national movements in the Arab Middle East operate. On the one hand, Arab states share a strong cultural affiliation with each other and an unfulfilled dream of political unity; on the other, local-territorial identities have only strengthened since the formation of the Arab states after WWI, yet not to the point of turning one of their vernaculars into the official national language. Literary Arabic, because of its deep theological weight, has always carried immense power in the Middle East, far more than Latin in Europe. We shall see that this strength caused many Lebanese nationalists to practice exceptional verbal acrobatics in their attempts to reconcile between their assertion that they were not Arabs and the fact that they used Arabic as their national language. Western-centric theories on the rise of nationalism can sometimes confuse more than elucidate our attempt to explain the rise of nationalism in the Middle East or the Southern Hemisphere. There have been several attempts to provide a theoretical explanation of the rise of nationalism in non-Western societies. I refer here mainly to the works of Partha Chatterjee who added another component to the study of nationalism by claiming that its character changes in colonial settings.32 Chatterjee holds that national identity in colonized societies can be divided into spiritual and material realms. Anti-colonial movements are deeply affected by the material advantages of their colonizer. Acknowledging its technological superiority, they study its economy, statecraft, science and so forth. However, adopting the “material domain” leads them to cling tighter, even when it requires invention, to the “spiritual domain,” i.e.; to a cultural identity that preserves their spiritual culture. In other words, while the state adopts the material Western domain, the emerging nation embraces a national culture that keeps the colonizer out. By presenting this view, Chatterjee actually criticized Anderson who asserted that nonWestern societies imagine a Western model of the nation.33 According to Chatterjee, non-Western nationalists may strive to emulate the material domain of Western nationalism, but they imagine and create a spiritual domain independent of their colonizer. Lebanon poses an interesting case when trying to juxtapose its colonial experience with Chatterjee’s analysis. As we shall see in this study, the national movement that advocated the establishment of Greater Lebanon was a mélange of modern (Beirut’s emerging Christian bourgeoisie) and traditional (the Maronite Church) social forces. In a unique historical moment they cooperated and asked to be occupied by France so as to realize their political aspirations and establish an independent state. They based their demand on the assertion that they were part of Western civilization, that they were in fact the French of the Levant and that there were no cultural and political ties between them\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nand their Arab neighbors. After 1920, a large number of Lebanese nationalists continued to look to France as their source of emulation, not only in the material domain, but also in the spiritual. Moreover, French colonial practice was far more intrusive than the British. Thus, France aggressively intervened in an attempt to set the content of the spiritual domain of the society of the fledgling state. In addition, even after most Lebanese nationalists were disillusioned by France’s conduct and understood that independence was not underway, they still shared with France their most basic demand: to be a separate entity, not related politically or culturally to the Syrian and/or Arab national movements. This dichotomy prevailed until 1943, the year of independence. The compromise between “Arabs” and “non-Arabs,” as manifested in the 1943 National Pact, was less related to the national character of Lebanon and more to the agreement of the Maronite and Sunni political elites to find a modus vivendi in a country that became a fact but that lacked a unifying “spiritual domain.”\n\nThe French Colonial Idea Before 1870, French colonialism was guided by the notion of “assimilation,” which meant that a “colony was to become an integral if not a contiguous part of France with its society and population made over in her image.”34 Yet, the attempts to gallicize the colonized peoples utterly failed and by the time Tunisia was taken in 1882 a new theory of “association” stood behind French colonial conduct. This theory reflected the desire of the colonial circles to have a more realistic and flexible doctrine that would win the cooperation of the natives by means of co-opting the elite with as little direct French involvement as possible. By 1905, the theory of association had become the leitmotif of all colonial bodies in France. It was best practiced by LouisHubert Lyautey, a French officer who was in charge of the pacification of indigenous unrest in Tonkin (Indochina), Madagascar, Algeria and who, in 1912, became the first Resident General of Morocco. Lyautey believed that a protectorate, governed firmly but indirectly by France, rather than outright colonial expansion and direct colonial rule, was the best way to establish quick, effective and inexpensive colonial control. This could be done, he believed, through collaboration with the indigenous elites, enlisting the ruling classes into the service of the French Empire. An important facet of Lyautey’s theory was the politique de races, which implied emphasizing the ethnic, cultural and racial differences between the various communities in the colonized area. When Lyautey became the Resident General of Morocco he had the opportunity to practice his theory in full scale, in what he called a “moral conquest;” to leave the ruling elite intact and exploit the existence of a large Berber population in order to highlight ethnic and cultural differences between the Berbers and the Arab communities, forging\n\n14\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nthe Berbers into a large collaborative group with French rule. Guided by the theory of Lyautey, French military men and civil administrators worked ardently to separate the Arab and Berber populations. They founded schools in Berber regions with the prime purpose of teaching French instead of Arabic and European and local Berber history instead of Arab-Islamic history, all aimed at encouraging tribal sentiments among the Berber tribes.35 They created centers for the study of the Berber society and published journals focusing on various aspects of Berber life, proliferating information and data on the Berber population in Morocco.36 The French constructed a complete myth of origin and ancestry for the Berbers. They were regarded as the indigenous population of North Africa whose racial origins went back to the Indo-Europeans races; some even said that their origin could be specifically traced to the Nordic races of northern Europe.37 The Berbers were depicted as a powerful but peaceful people with a strong sense of democracy and love for personal freedom. As opposed to their Arab-Muslim neighbors, they did not accept Islam as an authority of the State. In order to maintain these qualities they made the mountains their place of refuge, thus keeping their particular features despite the foreign Arab-Muslim occupiers. With the right guidance, the French believed, it would be possible to strengthen their distinct identity and to stop the process of their assimilation into the Arab-Muslim society.38 Morocco, of course, was not the first place where the French met Berber tribes. Already in Algeria the colonizers encountered Berbers and began developing a strong romantic view towards them, considering them perfect candidates for gallicization.39 Yet in Morocco the Berber policy developed into a coherent program supported by the entire colonial party and executed by the military officers of the new protectorate who became Lyautey’s disciples. By the time French forces arrived in Beirut in October 1918, French colonial circles had already gained experience in governing an Arab-Muslim population and attempting to seclude an ethnic group out of the majority population to shape it as a collaborative group of their colonial enterprise. Molding the Berbers into a collaborative group was not an easy task, for there was a need to instruct them about their self-perception (as seen by the French), to teach them French and to stop the existing process of their integration into the larger Moroccan population. As we shall see below, the same task was much easier to accomplish in Lebanon among the Maronites, whose elite had already mastered French and whose self-perception was very distinct even without the assistance of the French. Three decades ago, R. Robinson called for a new evaluation in our understanding of the process of colonialism by shifting the focus away from Europe towards the colonized societies.40 He believed that, to a large extent, European colonialism was determined by the collaborative groups, sometimes even more so than by the socio-political forces in the colonizing power itself. Considering this view may help illustrate why it was so important for France, through the medium of its missionaries, geographers, scholars and politicians, to emphasize the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\ndistinct features of the Christians in Lebanon and why in the end France succumbed to the demands of Lebanese nationalists and allowed the formation of Greater Lebanon. Collaboration was a key element in French colonial doctrine for their conduct towards the Berbers and towards the Maronites in Lebanon even though it utterly failed with the former and ran into difficulties with the latter. In conclusion, there were different internal and external forces that set the stage for the appearance of the Phoenician identity at the end of the 19th century: the introduction of nationalism as a new form of identity in the Middle East and the local struggle over the variety of this identity; the increasing power of colonialism in the region; the gradual shift in the social structure of the local societies; and the improvement of education that catered to increasing interest in the ancient civilizations of the Near East among Westerners and local elites alike. The dynamic between these forces in the mid-19th century is the source from which this study begins. *** Before commencing, a quick survey of the study’s structure and main premises is in order. The book is divided into three sections. The first section, “Origins,” comprising Chapters I and II, covers the roots of Phoenicianism from the mid-19th century to the formation of Greater Lebanon. The second section, “The Mandate Years,” Chapters III, IV and V, discusses the mandate years, the formative period of the Phoenician national narrative. The third section, “After Independence and Beyond,” including Chapter VI and the Conclusion, addresses the evolution of Phoenicianism after independence from 1943 to the 1990s and offers some concluding remarks and observations about the Lebanese national identity. Chapter I addresses the origins of Phoenicianism in the 19th century by analyzing the writings of French travelers, colonialists and the Jesuits, on the one hand, and lay Syro-Lebanese and Maronite clergy, on the other. The chapter explores Western interest in the ancient history of Lebanon and its impact on the local population. It also surveys the arrival of the French Jesuit order in Lebanon and its gradual growing domination over local education. The writings of Maronite clergy in the 19th century demonstrate that the Maronite Church did not advocate the Phoenician identity of its flock. It was rather the new stratum of lay Christians, and not necessarily Maronites, who began writing about their “ancestors” the ancient Phoenicians. The chapter illustrates that this was done not in the context of anti-Arab sentiments but rather the contrary, simply because Arab nationalism was not yet an ideology with which Syro-Lebanese had to come to terms. Chapter II looks at four different locales — Egypt, France, America and Lebanon — that functioned as centers of Phoenician expressions before and\n\n16\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nduring World War I, explaining the reasons why Phoenicianism was used by Syro-Lebanese in these places and in what capacity. The chapter explores the existing political orientations held by Lebanese and their use of the Phoenician past. The chapter also analyzes the way Phoenicianism began carrying its non-Arab stance, to the point that in 1919 the entire movement for the formation of Greater Lebanon was labeled “Phoenician.” Chapter III discusses the development of the Phoenician identity in mandatory Lebanon. It looks at the role the Jesuits and the French High Commission played in the dissemination of Phoenician sentiments, through the education system and other state agents such as archeology and museums. The chapter also illustrates how Lebanese graduates of the Jesuit educational establishment helped in the dissemination of the Phoenician identity in Lebanon. Finally, the chapter analyzes local developments within Lebanese society that led to the entrance of the Phoenician past into the Lebanese national narrative. Chapter IV discusses major Phoenician streams through the writing of three different advocates, Charles Corm, Michel Chiha and Sa‘id ‘Aql. Corm and Chiha represent francophone national Lebanese writing in the mandate years. Corm was the prime “preacher” of Phoenicianism until his death in 1963 and any discussion on this identity would not be complete without a thorough evaluation of his work. Chiha has been regarded as the architect of the Lebanese confessional system, and his impact on the political fate of Lebanon was immense. From WWI he was closely associated with the literary circles that advocated the Phoenician identity. He often wrote about Lebanon’s Phoenician past and promoted the idea that the Mediterranean basin was the prime source of its identity. Although there has been a tendency to separate his writing from the Phoenician group by asserting that Mediterraneanism was somewhat different, it is my contention that his views of Lebanese identity were one variant of Phoenicianism and therefore should be evaluated in the context of this study. Sa‘id ‘Aql also became a prime Phoenician advocate in the mid-1930s and remains so to this day. Unlike Corm and Chiha he wrote the majority of his works in Arabic. In addition, whereas Corm and Chiha were born, raised and educated in Beirut, ‘Aql’s background is from Mount Lebanon. The section on ‘Aql focuses on his different social origins and on arabophone Phoenicians in general. Analyzing the writing of these three not only reveals their understanding of Phoenicianism, but also sheds new light on the way this identity was disseminated in mandatory Lebanon. Chapter V examines four different political groups that opposed the Phoenician narrative of Lebanon: Arab-Muslim, secular pan-Arabs, Muslim Lebanese and Antun Sa‘adeh, who headed the Syrian Social Nationalist party. The chapter discloses not only the views of the adversaries of Phoenicianism but it also reveals more about the content and weight of the Phoenician identity in mandatory Lebanon. Furthermore, through this discussion, the chapter also\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\njuxtaposes Phoenicianism in a wider regional context of other forces of identity that existed in Lebanon during the first half of the 20th century. Chapter VI provides an overview of the development of Phoenicianism from 1945 until the end of the civil war in 1990. Unlike the preceding chapters, it does not follow its evolution systematically. Phoenicianism as an alternative to the Arab identity of Lebanon was marginalized in the 1940s with the political integration of Lebanon into the Arab world. Yet, despite this integration, the Lebanese territorial national identity persisted and with it also remained aspects of the Phoenician idea. Thus, Phoenicianism continued to be expressed in two different ways. On the one hand, Christian Lebanese nationalists continued to express their vision of Lebanon as neo-Phoenicia, on the other, after decades of preoccupation with the Phoenician past of the country, a Phoenician “language” was formed that was used by all sects and parties in Lebanon, even by those that defied Phoenicianism as a figment of Christian imagination.\n\nReferences 1 2 3\n\n4\n\n5 6\n\n7\n\n8 9\n\nThe Ethnic Origins of Nations (Oxford: B.

AbuKhalil reiterates four times in the first five pages of the introduction his view that the Phoenician ideal is false. Such a preoccupation with Phoenicianism only reflects, in my view, the strength of this myth of origin. For general information on the ancient Phoenicians and their civilization, see Maria Eugenia Aubet, The Phoenicians and the West (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993); M. Gras, R. Rouillard and J. Teixidor, L’Univers Phénicien (Paris: Hachette, 1989); Sabatino Moscati, The Phoenicians (New York: Rizoli, 1999). For the interested reader, these works contain lengthy bibliographical lists. New Testament, Matthew, 15: 21-28; Mark, 7: 24-30. The genealogy in the Book of Genesis, Chapter 10, actually refers to the Canaanites-Phoenicians as Hamites by stating that Ham, Noah’s son, begat Canaan who begat Sidon. This, however, was an attempt of the Hebrew author of Genesis to separate the Hebrews from the Canaanites, due to the animosity between the two peoples. This thesis was first articulated by the Italian scholar Leone Caetani in his monumental Annali dell’Islam (Milan: Hoepli, 1905-l907). Philip Hitti was one of the most distinguished scholars who wrote on and advocated this theory. See his History of the Arabs, fifth edition (London: Macmillan, 1953), pp. 3-13; The Near East in History (Princeton: Van Nostrand, 1961), pp. 29-33.

See Smith’s discussion on the Phoenicians as an “ethnie” in The Ethnic Origins of Nations (Oxford: B. Blackwell, 1986), pp. 83-84, and 99-100. The most notable examples are the works of Kamal Salibi and Philip Hitti, The Modern History of Lebanon (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1964) and Lebanon in History (London: Macmillan, 1957). A similar tendency can be seen in the following works: William R. Polk, The Opening of South Lebanon, 17881840 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1963); Ilya Harik, Politics and Change in a Traditional Society (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1968).

These were the official names of the administrative province on Mount Lebanon created as a result of foreign and Ottoman intervention that put an end to heavy civil clashes among the local population. The 1861 settlement established for the first time a Lebanese political entity dominated by the Maronite community.

The Cedar, witness of the past, will be the witness of the present and the future. The Cedar on a foundation of blue, white and red. This is the flag. French colors. Phoenician colors, too. The blue, it is the sea that the Phoenicians introduced, through their vessels, to human history, and which they traversed along the maritime routes that civilized the world; it is also the azure of a new sky, a new horizon: the horizon of peace and heaven of liberty. The white, it is the eternal snow of the mountain; it is also the purity of the principles of justice, faith and loyalty on which the Lebanese have been raised. The red, it is the purple which gave Phoenicia its reputation and its fortune; it is the blood spilled through the centuries by ancestors to safeguard rights and traditions; it is also the struggle to hold on, the sacrifices made to elevate the fatherland to the rank of the most glorious countries. Before the flag, all Lebanese bow down, whatever their beliefs. If he [the Lebanese] dies, it is within its folds that he will sleep his final slumber. Pierre Raphaël (Maronite-born Jesuit)1\n\nFrance in the Levant On October 21, 1860, the French naval ship Colbert set sail from Marseille, the French gateway to the east, bound for the shores of Lebanon. On deck was Ernest Renan, the renowned philologist and orientalist, accompanied by a unit of French soldiers assigned to work with him. Renan was a member of\n\n22\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nthe French expedition force that had been dispatched to Lebanon following the bloody events of the spring and summer on Mount Lebanon. Long years of capitulations and patronage over the Catholic rites in the Ottoman Empire had led France to intervene in favor of its Christian protégés to try and halt the civil war and bloodshed. The inclusion of Renan’s scientific expedition in this military and political mission was a natural step that corresponded with France’s political agendas. Acquisition of scientific knowledge of areas occupied by France had become a tradition, begun by Napoleon Bonaparte and his “Savants” in Egypt in 1798. Two years before arriving on the Phoenician coast, Renan expressed his desire to excavate in Byblos, one of the Phoenician city-states, thirty kilometers north of Beirut. Following the discovery of a Phoenician inscription at the tomb of Eshmon‘ezer (Sidon, 1856), Renan hoped that a thorough excavating enterprise along the Phoenician coast would provide more Semitic texts, similar to those found in Cyprus, Malta and North Africa. During his yearlong sojourn in Lebanon, he excavated in Tyre, Sidon, Byblos and Arados. He also visited Palestine and prepared notes for his book La Vie de Jésus. Three years after his return to France, he published his corpulent tome, Mission de Phénicie.2 Renan’s work was not the most significant scientific enterprise in the study of ancient Phoenicia, but it was certainly the most popular at the time. His reputation in France and abroad made his work in Phoenicia a most celebrated undertaking. It was the first time that a serious field study had been conducted in Phoenicia itself rather than in its colonies around the Mediterranean basin, laying the emphasis on the Phoenician city-states of the Lebanese coast. Renan, of course, was not the first scholar to study the Phoenician civilization. The first attempts to critically probe the history of ancient Phoenicia were made in the 18th century by French and German scholars, concomitantly with the beginning of the modern and critical study of the Bible and its civilizations. Jean-Jacques Barthélémy (1716-1795), Arnold Heeren (17601842), François-Charles Movers (1806-1856) and others became the founding fathers of the study of the ancient Phoenician world, long before Ernest Renan published Mission de Phénicie.3 For them, just as for Renan, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Sidon and Tyre were almost equally considered part of the Holy Land. The attentiveness of the French public to ancient Phoenicia became apparent with the publication of Salammbô,4 the novel by Gustave Flaubert, only a year after the return of Renan’s exploratory mission. The novel tells the story of an historical episode of the most eminent Phoenician colony — Carthage. Flaubert depicted the second war between the Carthaginians and the Romans in the latter half of the 2nd century BC and thus introduced the Phoenician world to the average educated French household. Choosing this theme was by no means coincidental on Flaubert’s part.5 With France’s growing interest in North Africa, French scholars began studying the ancient civilizations that\n\nFIRST BUDS: 1860-1918\n\n23\n\nhad lived around the Mediterranean basin. Archaeological excavations in the Levant became intertwined with French Christian missionary work. As of 1867, the historical research of the ancient civilizations in Algeria and Tunisia became inseparably affiliated with the new Bishop of Algeria, Monsignor Lavigerie. He entrusted the excavations in Carthage to the hands of the Pères Blancs and, by so doing, set the example that would be followed in geographical Syria by the Jesuit mission.6 Lavigerie’s archaeological work in North Africa, just like the Jesuits’ in Syria, was strongly tied to his Christian convictions. In this missionary enterprise, excavation of the ancient world was perceived as the unearthing of the missioners’ own cultural roots. It was a belief shared by most Europeans, lay and clerical alike. By exposing the ancient past of the Biblical world, Rome, and Greece, they believed they were actually excavating and exposing their own progenitors and thus demonstrating their own cultural, scientific and political superiority.7 For this reason the history curricula of French religious and secular schools focused not only on local or European history but also on the ancient civilizations of the Levant — Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, Canaan and Phoenicia.8 European exposure of eastern civilizations almost always resulted in romantic, fantastic attitudes. European travelers had always been attracted to the Orient, but in the 19th century their number increased dramatically, and the character of the journeys changed as well. If previously they embarked on their journeys as private adventurers, then as the 19th century progressed they often came in official expeditionary delegations with a clear agenda of unearthing what they perceived as their own history and tradition. Shipping their finds to Europe was the next natural step. Paris, London, and Berlin became huge warehouses of these finds. Thus was the Egyptian Obelisk displaced from Luxor and installed in Paris, at the Place de le Concorde, in a pompous ceremony orchestrated by French King Louis Philippe; and the tomb of Eshmon‘ezer, the Phoenician king, was taken from Sidon, where it had rested untouched for 2,600 years, to be laid, with due respect, at the Louvre.9 The indigenous populations often came under scrutiny as well, much like the mute archaeological sites. If a European arrived in Jerusalem to search after King David under the debris of the Old City, he would then often look for David’s progeny among the contemporary inhabitants of the city. The same applied to visitors to Mount Lebanon and the surrounding areas. An example of such an approach, chosen out of numerous books written by European travelers, is that of Louis Lortet, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lyon. The University had acted as a patron of Université Saint Joseph in Beirut since its establishment in 1875. The Jesuit order of Lyon and the University of Lyon became two of the most important factors in shaping the character of the Jesuit University. The following description is quoted from Lortet’s account of his visit to Beirut, where Université Saint Joseph had been recently established:\n\n24\n\nREVIVING PHOENICIA\n\nDans les rues, en moins d’une heure, on peut voit les descendants de tous ces peuples divers: voici un Égyptien aux membres grêles, aux yeux taillés en amande, au profil de sphinx. A côté de lui s’avance un guerrier semblable à ceux des palais de Khorsabad et de Ninive; les membres de l’Assyrien sont épais et robustes, les épaules larges, carrées, fortement musclées; la taille est petite, la barbe épaisse est frisé en tirebouchons serrés et sympathique, comme l’étaient celles des terribles conquérants des bordes de l’Euphrate. Ici passe le successeur de l’ancien Phénicien: Sa face est fine, distinguée, son nez aquilin, ses lèvres minces, il est grand et souple dans ses mouvements; ses beaux yeux noirs pétillent de feu et d’intelligence. N’exiger cependant de lui aucune autre aptitude que celle nécessitées pour le commerce; il est âpre au gain, quelquefois économe jusqu’à l’avarice, entreprenant, et n’hésitera jamais à vous tromper pour gagner une somme modique [...] Ce sont les dignes fils de fameux marchands de Tyr, Sidon et Aradus dont les flottes puissantes trafiquaient dans les contrées les plus lointaines. So, the streets of Beirut in 1880 were bustling with descendants of ancient peoples: Egyptians, Assyrians and Phoenicians. The latter have distinct facial features and, of course, they excel in commerce. The Arab, Lortet informs us, is: ... pur sang, fort, vigoureux, infatigable, au teint basané, bien musclé est néanmoins souple et agile; ses jarrets sont d’acier; cavalier accompli, sa vie passe à cheval. Il a un front largement développé, des lèvres plus épaisses que celles du Phénicien, un nez moins aquilin [...] Il estime aussi avant tout commerce, le trafic, mais il est pourtant passionné pour les luttes du corps, pour les exercices violentes de la guerre et de la chasse. Son imagination est vive et enjouée, il adore les contes merveilleux, les poésies d’Antar, les récits des Milles et une nuit.10 These images were prevalent in many of the travelogues published throughout the 19th century and were shared by the leading intellectual Europeans of the time. The scents of the Orient intoxicated the Europeans, who began seeing what they had wished and dreamed of witnessing. The ancient world was revived, and an impoverished peasant in Upper Egypt, the Galilee or Mount Lebanon suddenly became a descendent of an ancient and imposing lineage. One of the last French sojourners in the Levant who wrote a travelogue in the tradition of the time was Maurice Barrès, whose name will resurface repeatedly in this study. Barrès, the speaker and thinker of the French radical right after the French defeat by Germany in 1870, visited the Levant on the eve of World War I and published a two-volume book depicting his impressions.
