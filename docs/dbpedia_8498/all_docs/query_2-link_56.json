        "text": "Sumeet Raghavan understands comedy so well that he knows it’s serious business. And to say he was the soul of\n\nSarabhai vs Sarabhai\n\nwherein he played Dr Saahil, would be no exaggeration.\n\n'Tele-mantra'\n\n'Believe in yourself’ is Sumeet’s mantra. It would not be wrong to say that Sumeet is a born actor. Born to a Tamilian father and Kannadiga mother, Sumeet is a Maharshtrian at heart. Married to a Maharashtrian girl Chinmayee, he has two kids Neerad and Deeya. He debuted in the year 1983 in Srikant when he was just 12 years old.\n\nMarathi theatre\n\nSumeet has done Marathi theatre for almost 12 years from 1984 to 1997. He has done 15 Marathi plays and 1 Gujarati play. He has also acted in many Marathi serials and films. But Sumeet’s first love has always been music and he is a trained classical singer. He has learnt classical music for 8 years. He has sung more than 200 jingles, when he was younger.\n\nBut he was out of work, both in singing and acting when his voice started cracking when growing as a young lad. But a strong-willed person like Sumeet was not bogged down. He started dubbing for English movies and cartoon characters, alongside with working in his uncle’s travel agency. His dubbing career flourished for nearly 7 years from 1992 to 1998. It was in the end of the year 1998, when luck smiled on him again and he got to work in Shubh Mangal Savdhan.\n\nReality bytes\n\nThe actor has also participated in two music based reality shows namely Zee Marathi Saregamapa in 2007 wherein he was the runner-up and Say Shaava Shaava on NDTV Imagine where he bagged the winner’s trophy. Sumeet has become very choosy post the release of his movie U Me Aur Hum and he wants to work on his terms.\n\nDie-hard foodie\n\nSumeet is a great foodie but has to be health conscious owing to his acting career. He is a complete family man and loves to spend time with his kids. His favourite pastime is sleeping.\n\nHis strength is his practical approach towards everything. He is a self proclaimed day-dreamer, who believes that if one has the talent then there is no stopping. His mantra is to believe in oneself.\n\nSumeet, by now has completed 25 years of acting. Very few are aware that Sumeet is one of the few actors who has done over 100 ads and most of them playing a father or a husband.\n\nTelegraphy:"
