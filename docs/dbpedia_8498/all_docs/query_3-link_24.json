        "text": "Finserv MARKETS, an initiative by Bajaj Finserv and a one-stop destination for financial and lifestyle products has launched their brand film ‘Ab Choices Hue Aasaan’ featuring renowned actor Sumeet Raghavan as the protagonist.\n\nThe brand film sees Raghavan portray a common man, a fitting choice given that the actor is best known for playing light-hearted roles in daily sitcoms. He is shown struggling with relatable issues such as figuring out ways to finance the growing needs of his family, striking the right balance between savings and investments, managing monthly expenditures, and finding the best insurance schemes for what he loves the most, in the most whimsical way.\n\nThe film depicts humorous moments such as counting cash in a checkout line with customers behind him getting impatient, monthly expenditures coming to haunt him in his dreams, and him taking pictures with his loved ones – the most important of which being his car.\n\nIn one of the sections, Raghavan plays a triple role – wearing the hats of the main character, his father, and grandfather. He’s a smart man who wishes to invest his money in different mutual funds, systematic investment plans, and fixed deposits, but doesn’t know where to find all of these options. He is mind-blown when he discovers Finserv MARKETS, as it covers all of his financial and lifestyle needs.\n\nThe aim of the #AbChoicesHueAasaan campaign was to show how Finserv MARKETS makes its customers’ lives easier by simplifying the decisions and actions they need to take for their financial and lifestyle needs. The ad portrays the various offerings and shows how the platform has solutions for everything from loans, cards, insurance, shopping, and much more."
