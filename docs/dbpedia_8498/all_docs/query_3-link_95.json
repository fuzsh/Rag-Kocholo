        "text": "Sumeet Raghavan admits that fact that he became popular with the small screen audience because of Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai.\n\nSarabhai VS Sarabhai actor Sumeet Raghavan rose to fame for his comic role after the show. The actor, however, has performed varied kinds of roles in both films and TV. But Sumeet’s comic image has been loved by the viewers the most and he feels fortunate that his roles were never compared so far. He is returning back to comedy with Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai’s first ever web series. But at the same time, he is performing in a Marathi play. SO currently, Sumeet is juggling between the sets of the show and theater.\n\nTalking about his experience, the actor-comedian says, “I have always got heart-warming reviews from the people in the industry and my viewers regarding my work. It is encouraging when you are liked in varied roles, but there is no denial that comedy comes naturally to me. I am an actor and I want to do different roles. I feel glad when I get opportunities to attempt something I have never done before. I took up the play to take stock o f things. I wanted to assess myself and see I can go beyond comedy.” (ALSO READ: Sarabhai vs Sarabhai: If Maya Sarabhai was real, these 3 reasons would get her royally trolled!)\n\nHis Marathi play, Ek Shunya Teen, has completed 50 shows so far and this has him excited. Based on the book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the play touches upon the most concerned social issue of current times, Rape. “I am glad that the play isn’t just about entertainment, but has a message. We hear about rape, molestation, and eve-teasing every day. Now, we need to talk about it and address the issue. This is a small initiative and the kind of response we are getting has been encouraging. I have met people who have told me that they have found the courage to talk about the issue after watching the play,” says the theater star.

He is seen as Dr, Sahil on the show and admits that fact that he became popular with the small screen audience because of the show. Talking about the upcoming season of Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai, Sumeet says, “It’s too early to talk about the new season of the show. We never imagined that it (previous season0) would be loved so much. Do you know that when we were on air, the show wasn’t a hit, as people were accustomed to watching dailies and our show was a weekly? But once it ended, the channel aired it every day and that’s when it caught the fancy of the audience. By then, it was too late, as we had shut shop (laughs). People still remember the plots, the dialogues and the characters. While doing the show, i remember how everything fell into place and made the show fabulous. It has given me a lot of mileage and credibility as an actor.” (ALSO READ: Sarabhai vs Sarabhai season 2 trailer: Maya, Monisha, Indravardan and Rosesh seek your help!)\n\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.
