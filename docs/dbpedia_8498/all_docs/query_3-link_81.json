        "text": "Sony SAB’s 'Wagle Ki Duniya - Nayi Peedhi Naye Kissey' beautifully portrays the life of a common man and the everyday challenges faced by middle-class families. Sumeet Raghavan and Pariva Pranati, essaying the role of Rajesh and Vandana Wagle respectively, are champions of positive habits and traditions. Apart from being stellar actors, the duo are now the cleanliness police on the sets of Wagle Ki Duniya as they have declared a zero-tolerance policy for littering.\n\nSumeet and Pariva, armed with their invisible brooms, are always on the lookout that no banana peels are left behind and no crumpled papers are lying around. And to make sure everyone's on board, they've introduced a fine system, with a 100 rupee fine if anyone is caught littering the sets. It's a quirky yet responsible way of bringing this conversation to the forefront and ensuring that their workplace remains spotless. After all, they've got one thing right: change starts at home!\n\nSumeet Raghavan, who plays Rajesh's character, said, “The one thing I always champion for is leading by example. Both Pariva and I like to keep our set and makeup rooms clean. Yet, no matter whose birthday we celebrate on the set, everyone comes to my room to cut the cake and leave the crumbles behind and I end up cleaning my makeup room all over again. Having said that, we spend around 12 hours on set daily and keeping it clean for our well-being is important. Therefore we came up with the idea of putting a fine on whoever leaves the set dirty. All the actors, directors, and other crew members including our spot dadas have to pay the fine if they are caught.”\n\nPariva Pranati, who plays Vandana’s character, said, “People need to be more mindful of their surroundings, especially when it comes to littering. Sumeet and I have made it our mission to ensure cleanliness on the set. It's not just about keeping our workplace tidy; it's about creating a culture of responsibility. Our homes and our sets are places where we can bring change easily and there is a price for a cleaner set, consider it our contribution to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan!”"
