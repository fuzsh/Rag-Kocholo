The final episode was broadcast in October 2014.\n\nThe show was created by Abhigyan Jha as a sequel to the late-night television comedy show Movers & Shakers. It was produced by Mrinal Jha for Undercover Productions Ltd. By 2014, the show had a team of 15 scriptwriters.[2]\n\nJay Hind! included satirical commentary on current events, jokes about politicians and other public figures, and comedy about sexuality and other controversial subjects. The presenter and guests freely used profanity.[3] In 2012, a skit about the Sikh runner Fauja Singh, which included jokes about the 1984 Sikh massacre, was sharply criticized by the Sikh community.[4]\n\nIn 2011, the show's website was hacked by anti-Indian fundamentalist activists.[1]\n\nA version of the show adapted for television, called The Late Night Show, was broadcast on Colors TV. It debuted on television on 3 March 2012.[5] The Late Night Show excluded some of the more controversial commentary, in order to be accepted for syndication.[6]\n\nThere was also an English-language version of Jay Hind!, called Better Late Than Never, which focused on international news.[1]\n\nAbhigyan Jha was nominated for the Best Director (Comedy) award at the Indian Television Academy Awards in 2011, for his work with Jay Hind!.[7]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
