        "text": "Finally, I made the list of my all time favourite TV series. I like mostly comedy serials so I am sorry you will not get any of the saas bahu serial name or some serious stuff in this list.\n\n1. Sarabhai vs Sarabhai ‚Äì Only for this TV series I can say that ‚ÄúI have watched it‚Äôs all episodes for 100 times or more than that‚Äù. For me it is the definition of classic comedy. When all the nice actors are present in one place, then you can expect such type of output. Every character was so well portrayed by the director, whether it is the character of Narad Muni Indu or Poet Roshesh or sophisticated Maya or middle class Monisha, you will find all of them lovable and entertaining. Guest appearances of Madhu Fufa and gadget freak Dushyant work like spices.\n\nFavourite character ‚Äì Sahil played by Sumeet Raghavan. Sahil is very quiet and calm, mostly get stuck between his family member‚Äôs fight.\n\n2. Friends ‚Äì A Story about Six friends hanging out together. I will not say the concept is very good, but something is there that keeps you remain attached to this show. May be the actors and their comic timing. Somewhere I found the expression of the actors and dialogue made a good combo. Every character is different and funny in their own way. Like you will find humour in Ross‚Äôs dullness or Phoebe‚Äôs innocence or Monica‚Äôs bossiness. Let‚Äôs talk my favourite character Chandler. He is known for his sarcastic sense of humor. I feel like the humor is coming inside from the actor, he is not acting, but this is real.\n\nFavourite Character ‚Äì Chandler Bing played by Matthew Perry\n\n3. Taarak Mehta ka Ooltah Chamah ‚Äì Although these days this show lost its originality and become more like daily soap, but I like watching its old episodes. The best part of this serial is that director try to deal with some social issues in a comic way. Every character has their own style and nature. The Concept of the show is very good, people from different religion lives in the same society happily.\n\nFavourite character ‚Äì I like Champak Chacha‚Äôs character but my favourite is JethaLal played by a veteran actor Dilip Joshi\n\n4. Small Wonder ‚Äì It is the part of my childhood memories. Who can forget Vicki the Robot, Harriet and Jamie? This show has the different theme. But I don‚Äôt like its Hindi remake ‚ÄúKarishma ka Karishma‚Äù. I think artist like Tiffany Brissette and Emily Schulman has created that magic on screen. Other characters of this show are also lovable like Ted, Jamie and Joan.\n\nFavourite Character ‚Äì Obviously Vicki, Voice Input Child Identicant (V.I.C.I.) üòâ\n\n5. Dekh Bhai Dekh ‚Äì There is no comparison of Diwan family in this world. Madness of Sameer(Shekhar Suman) and chachi (Bhavana Balsavar), simplicity of Balraj, beauty of Suhashini, Modern Dadi, Naughty Sanju, Cute kirti, more friend less chachu Sahil every character of this show is unforgettable. Still we remember the episode of hypnotism..‚ÄùKirti tu Sanju hai, Sanju tu Kirti hai‚Äù.Small appearances of Lilliput were like an added bonus to the viewers.\n\nFavourite Character ‚Äì Sameer Diwan played by Shekhar Suman\n\n6. I Dream of Jeanie and Bewitched ‚Äì If you are an 80-90s child then you will definitely connect with the next two lines. When I was in 5th standard, my 6.30 to 7.30 time slot was fixed for these serials which was telecast on Sony channel(No, Jeanie was not the part of CID team. At that time Sony telecast others serials as well apart from CID and Crime Patrol.) These serials made you feel like living in the magical world. Jeanie and her mischievous act gave you a laughter riot. On other hand, Samantha‚Äôs mother and husband‚Äôs encounters would made your stomach ache with laughter. Their Hindi version ‚ÄúJeanie aur Juju‚Äù and ‚ÄúShararat‚Äù were also good but was not able to surpass the original."
