RACE RECORD

Sunny's Halo, the flashy chestnut colt by Halo, strung together nine career victories, eight of them in stakes races and four coming in gr. I events. At the end of his short career, Sunny's Halo returned to stud as Canadas all-time leading money winning thoroughbred.

During his two years of racing, Sunny's Halo captured the gr. I Super Derby Invitational, gr. I Arkansas Derby, Coronation Futurity, Grey Stakes, Rebel Handicap, Swynford Stakes and the Colin Stakes. In the meanwhile, he was also able to place second in the gr. III Volante Handicap, Clarendon Stakes, and the Victoria Stakes, while finishing third in the gr. I Whitney Stales.

Even with this impressive list of wins and close seconds and thirds, Sunny's Halo is most famous for his thrilling victory on the first Saturday in May, Derby Day. The field for the 109th running of the Kentucky Derby was one of the strongest in the history of the sporting spectacle. Even though he was not the favorite, Sunny's Halo demolished the field to take his place in history as a Kentucky Derby winner. At the wire, Sunny's Halo was in front by two, and took his place beside Northern Dancer as the only two Canadian-breds to win the Kentucky Derby.

After retirement, Sunny's Halo was sent to begin study duty at Walmac International in Kentucky, but he was soon moved to Double S Thoroughbred Farm in Tyler Texas. In 1986, Sunny was inducted into the Canadian Racing Hall of Fame at the age of 6.
