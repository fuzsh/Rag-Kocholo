        "text": "“So perfect like this, Satoru.” Suguru groans from above him, hips moving languidly as he holds Satoru’s wrists in one hand, the other gripping his hip with a bruising hold. “Look at you, submitting to me.”\n\nSatoru moans, feeling hot all over, the wet sounds they’re making hitting his ears like bullets of shame. There’s something off, he should really tell Suguru, but he’s not sure what it is. Six Eyes haven’t reported anything, best to leave it, especially as Suguru mouths at his chest, biting the thin and sensitive skin around his nipples.\n\n“F-fuck,” Satoru bites out, hips tilting down to get Suguru even deeper than he already is, body lagging behind thought out of lust, his chest pushing towards his boyfriends mouth as the overstimulation starts to kick in. “Suguru. Fuck, please .”\n\nSuguru laughs, not cruelly but it sounds more like wondrous disbelief, and he moves his hands to grab underneath Satoru’s ankles, pushing them up and past his shoulders, full mating press. It’s perfect, Suguru’s hitting that spot every single thrust, and he looks fucking gorgeous above him, but there’s still that heavy feeling in his chest despite how close he’s getting to spilling all over himself.\n\n“So good for me, Satoru. Made for me.” Suguru swears above him, the light in the hotel's bedroom glowing around his head like a halo. The white ceiling paired with the warm light paints a romantic picture that swirls in Satoru’s brain like a sickness. “If you could see yourself, a mess and pleading for me. You’re driving me insane.”\n\nSatoru lets out a pathetic whimper, his dick twitching between the both of them, trapped rutting against his own stomach because of the position. He almost sobs as he feels his orgasm rapidly increasing, and he knows Suguru feels it too from the way he groans out a ‘fuck , so tight ,’, before he slams in messily.\n\nHe’s about to come, all the way up his own stomach, so why isn’t he feeling as great as he normally does? He feels like he’s floating above his own body, watching two strangers play hooky like horny teenagers. After all, they aren’t even dating. Satoru isn’t brave enough to ask for something like that, and Suguru isn’t selfish enough to ask himself.\n\n“Come for me, honey.” Suguru pants, grip slipping on Satoru’s ankles as his own thrusts get sloppy and slow, the schlick, schlick noises getting louder as he holds his own orgasm back. “Satoru, baby , come for me.”\n\nSatoru sobs out at the endearments, and keens as he shoots milky white come up his own chest, hitting his chin with the force of the intense release. His bright blue eyes rolling back in his skull as Suguru fucks him through it, letting out a harmonious moan as he comes inside Satoru, fucking it in with lazy thrusts and making little grunts as he watches it drip down Satoru’s thighs.\n\nIt’s been like this since they graduated, two years of fucking in rooms that don’t belong to them or whatever alleyway is abandoned and quiet after a mission. It started with a mutual handjob outside Jujutsu High, after the impromptu sabbatical Suguru took himself on, he’d got back to the school just for Satoru to shove him into the nearest bus stop and bite and suck his neck whilst roughly pumping him, muttering little curses and coming in his boxers as Suguru rolled his head back and spilled over both of them.\n\nAll Satoru wanted was to connect with him on some kind of level, because no matter how angry he was it didn’t stop the relentless thoughts of you let him walk away, what kind of sorcerer loses an ally so easily, Satoru Gojo trained to be greater than the gods and he’s stuck on another man. Really, he’d intended to take him to the bus stop and beat the crap out of him for leaving, but his dick quickly won the internal struggle.\n\nThey don’t really talk about it, and Satoru certainly hasn’t told anyone. After all, Suguru may have returned to Jujutsu society but he still killed non-sorcerers regardless of the situation - he was on probation, and Satoru was prohibited from helping him with the adjustment back into curse hunting. They met up frequently, let the other man desecrate the other respectively, just in the privacy of rooms that have never seen a returning customer.\n\nIf the Gojo clan knew that not only was Satoru hooking up with a man, a murderer, a fellow sorcerer but also a single father - he’s not sure he’d have a clan to return to. Not that the thought particularly spooks him, but the hassle of having to separate from something he’s supposedly in charge of makes him groan internally.\n\nSuguru Geto was better than him, in every way. Always has been. In fact, Satoru is fairly certain that the younger man was made with the sole intention to counteract every negative part of him. Where there was a con to Satoru, Suguru would have a matching pro. The two strongest, fucking like dirty salary men in run down hotels. How the mighty have fallen.\n\n“I’ll file a report for the victim, if you don’t mind writing up the mission outcome.” Suguru says from beside him, already shrugging his t-shirt on over his sweat-soaked back. The black illustration of a dragon disappearing under the fabric. Shame. Business as usual.\n\nSatoru moves his mouth to answer, but embarrassingly he feels tears prick at the corners of his eyes. His eyes widen and his mouth opens in shock, but the only noise that comes out is a strangled sob.\n\nIt’s a foreign feeling, to cry. He only cried a handful of times as a child, and all had to do with pain not some kind of inner turmoil. Satoru blinks his eyes rapidly, staring up at the ceiling, the paint job suddenly looking a lot more tarnished now that Suguru wasn’t surrounding it. He shuts his eyes, wills his body into staying still despite the urge to wrack with sobs uncontrollably until he passes out.\n\nVaguely, he registers the bed dipping right next to him. He startles at the feeling of a soothing hand on his cheek, tries to listen to what Suguru is saying, but that crushing feeling in his chest has peaked and he’s struggling to breathe.\n\nThere’s his own come cooling on his stomach and making a sticky, caked mess that feels like fire, something similar below as he feels Suguru Geto’s come dripping out of his used hole, something that usually sends him feral, has him wishing he died all those years ago. The emptiness, the feeling of shame for allowing Suguru to use him like a cheap whore when he’s supposed to be a clan head.\n\nHis grandfather was right, he disregards his own responsibilities in the name of temporary relief. A fresh wave of guilt, accompanied by a panicked garble of a sob is all he can manage to let out, hoping Suguru will just leave him to it. There’s a staticky shiver as he activates Infinity, it travels from his toes all the way to his neck before he gasps and his eyes crack open at the feeling of cool skin against clammy skin on his forehead. He sees Suguru’s amethyst eyes gazing at him with panic swirling in the irises. He forces himself to take a breath, the ringing in his ears stopping as he tries to focus on what his friend is saying.\n\n“-ease. What’s going on? Satoru.” Suguru is pleading, all calm and joking demeanor from earlier missing from his voice. Instead there’s something soft nestled there, and Satoru wants to close his eyes again as he feels Suguru’s fingers massaging the back of his head gently. “Are you hurt?”\n\nGod, no.\n\n“No,” Satoru croaks out, wincing at the sound of his own voice. So much for a pleasant afterglow. “No, sorry. You can leave. I’ll have the report done by ten.”\n\nSuguru frowns, his nose brushing against Satoru’s, and he wants to cry all over again at the gentleness of it all. This isn’t what they’re supposed to be.\n\n“Won’t you tell me what’s going on?” Suguru asks, voice quiet and soothing. He’s laying on his side next to Satoru, his forehead and nose still brushing against the older mans, hands soothing any part of him they can reach, and he’s tangled his legs with Satoru’s. “I can’t leave you like this, Satoru.”\n\n“Please.” Satoru begs, but it’s breathless and wet-sounding. A pathetic mimicry of the desperate begging he was doing minutes earlier. There’s anger coiling in his system - he’s not one to be pitied. “Get out. Now.”\n\n“Satoru,” Suguru is gentle still, fingers stroking soothing paths through his hair.\n\n“Suguru. You aren’t welcome.” Satoru grits out, hating the way his eyes tear up at the command, as if it wasn’t his own mouth uttering it. Please don’t leave . “Leave.”\n\nIt’s silent for a moment, and Satoru almost thinks it’s worked finally, but then Suguru is sighing and pushing him gently to the side muttering something that Satoru is tuning out, because they’ve never done this after sex. It’s always a stress-relieving tactic for Suguru, and Satoru is glad to be able to help with that usually. So he doesn’t know what's happened tonight - why he suddenly cares about what his grandparents would think.\n\nThen there's body heat next to him, and Suguru’s arm is draped across his chest in a way that's too loving for them, it’s too much. Satoru tries to shove him away, hoping Infinity will stave him off - but then his body betrays him, and Infinity fizzles out.\n\n“That’s it, good boy,” Suguru soothes, placing a kiss on Satoru's temple. “Satoru, please tell me what’s on your mind. This isn’t healthy.”\n\n“Like you would know,” Satoru blurts out irritably. What the hell does Suguru know about rationally dealing with emotions? Tell that to burnt carcasses residing in Shoko’s morgue for the next century. Satoru has barely killed someone out of anger.\n\nSuguru huffs out a laugh next to him, mutters a ‘I suppose that's fair,’ and places a couple dozen chaste kisses across Satoru’s face. Anger spikes in him at the lack of respect Suguru seems to have for his wishes to be alone, but also at the fact that he never wanted Suguru to leave in the first place.\n\n“I don’t want to do this anymore.” Satoru whispers, intending for it to be strong and demanding, like the end to a conversation, but it sounds devastated and wet even to his own ears. Fuck. “Please, leave. I want to keep your respect.”\n\n“You don’t want to have sex anymore, or you don’t want me to leave anymore?” Suguru murmurs into his ear, hands moving to rub at his arms comfortingly. “Really, Satoru, you should know that you can speak your mind with me. I was inside you a moment ago, and now you think I’ll suddenly change my mind about respecting you?”\n\n“Yes.” Satoru confesses, eyes still trained at the ceiling. “No. I don’t know right now, alright? It’s fine, I’ll work it out.”\n\n“I’m not going to leave with you like this,” Suguru says, still gentle and soothing and Satoru wants to rip his skin off, or weep and curl up like a porcupine. “ I love you , Satoru. Tell me what’s bothering you?”\n\nWhat? What the fuck did he just say?\n\n“Don’t say that.” Satoru spits out, teeth bared and jaw clenched like he’s about to rip flesh from bone. “Don’t you say that as if what we’re doing isn’t some fucked up way to relieve stress. I deserve more than to be lied to.”\n\nSuguru props himself up on one elbow, leaning slightly over so that he can make eye contact with Satoru, purple eyes wide and hurt. Satoru wants to be mad, but the sight of him still flushed pink, lips swollen with messy black hair framing his jaw makes him want to make the same mistake all over again.\n\n“ Satoru ,” Suguru starts, a hand cupping Satoru’s jaw with a tenderness that doesn’t belong right now. He stops and starts, clearly searching for something to say. Not that Satoru has been letting him get a word in edgewise, and guilt claws at his throat. “You think I’m using you?”\n\nNot trusting the way his jaw jolts and the way his eyes flood, he just nods.\n\n“I love you,” Suguru says earnestly, bringing bruised wrists close to his lips as he kisses all over Satoru’s hands, whispering little praises. “God, I love you , Satoru. I thought you knew. I thought you wanted to keep it strictly business.”\n\nSatoru lets out a wet laugh, shaking his head slightly to dislodge the tears before turning his face to finally meet Suguru halfway. There’s nothing but adoration in his eyes, his face soft. Six Eye’s helpfully tells him he’s not lying, and Satoru crumbles.\n\n“You can’t say something like that, not when you don’t want to stay.” Satoru blubbers, embarrassed at his own immaturity. Never in his life has he been so vulnerable, so why now? “Please don’t say things you don’t mean just because I’m upset, Suguru.”\n\n“Satoru,” Suguru practically coos, wiping tears from Satoru’s pale cheeks with strong and warm thumbs. Satoru eyelashes flutter shut at the comfort, this time welcoming it. “Clearly, I haven’t been showing you how much I worship you.”\n\nSatoru laughs as Suguru kisses his cheek with the enthusiasm of an excited dog. Maybe he’d had this backwards the whole time.\n\n“Will you let me show you?” Suguru whispers in his ear. The hands that were comforting him with gentle circular rubs are now wandering further down, mapping Satoru’s entire body. “Hm? You deserve worship, Satoru. It’s an honor to love you. I want you to know it’s the highest privilege to be able to see you, hold you, take you.”\n\n“Sap.” Satoru wetly says, a forearm across his face but a wobbly grin on his face as he feels Suguru trail kisses down his torso, making comments about the strong, marbled physique that's underneath him.\n\n“For you? Absolutely.” Suguru grins, nipping at Satoru’s hip bone and laughing at the slight kick to the stomach he receives. “Tell me if you want to stop, Satoru.”\n\nHis response is an incredulous snort followed by a weak moan as Suguru places swollen lips over the head of Satoru’s dick, sucking gently as he rubs circles with his thumb into Satoru’s hip, soothing the bruises from earlier.\n\nTight, wet, perfect as it always is. Suguru is making little groans that have Satoru panting in almost no time. If he hadn’t already come earlier, he would have shot off embarrassingly fast. He sobs out as Suguru takes him to the root, swallowing and pulling completely off with a pop.\n\n“Good?” Suguru’s voice is wrecked, throaty and deep.\n\n“Yeah,” Satoru’s own devastated voice confirms, dick weeping all over his own stomach like a faucet. He lets out a breathy gasp as Suguru’s fingertips trace his hole, pushing come back inside from where it was leaking.\n\n“So good for me,” Suguru praises him, laguidly thrusting two fingers into an already needy hole, groaning a soft ‘fuck me’ as Satoru practically sucks his fingers in, come flowing out around his digits, making lewd wet noises. “What do you want, baby?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Satoru pants, quiet and focused on the pleasure, arching his back as Suguru hits that spot over and over, long and thick fingers honing in. It’s brutal in the gentlest way, pleasure washing in waves as Suguru continues to thrust his fingers, folding himself over so that he can press sweet kisses on his chest, ignoring his own hard-on in his mission to have Satoru weeping in a completely different way. “Fuck, don’t stop.”\n\n“I won’t,” Suguru promises, swirling his tongue in the valley between Satoru’s abs, collecting some of the bitter tasting seed from earlier, smirking as Satoru watches him with blow-out pupils, mouth gaping and pink, beautiful flush across his cheeks.\n\n“That’s nasty.” Satoru gapes. Sweat and come getting cleaned off him like it’s candy. He throws his head back against his pillow, damp white hair fanning out, some falling in his face. “Fuck, Suguru, you can’t be serious.”\n\n“Mmhm.” Suguru nods, placing open mouthed kisses across the saliva-slick marks on his friend's stomach. He adds a third finger, stretching Satoru open despite him being filled only a handful of minutes before. “Always so tight, Satoru. Did you miss me already?”\n\n“Always,” Satoru keens, breathless and crying as he gets his hole abused but in the most attentive way that they’ve ever done. “Always, even when you’re here with me.”\n\nSuguru breathes out slowly, eyes wet and Satoru looks at him in wonder.\n\n“Suguru?”\n\n“Date me?” Suguru replies instead of an actual answer. He’s lined up, leaking tip pressing into Satoru’s hole. “Be my boyfriend? Fuck , my husband ?”\n\n“Yes, yes,” Satoru sobs out as Suguru finally pushes in, a sweet stretch mixed with how full he already was making him tingle, heat coiling in his stomach. His hands fidget in the sheets beside him, unsure where to go, before Suguru clasps them gently in his own larger hands, fingers wrapping around each other. They’re completely prone, not something they’ve really tried - too romantic and intimate for Satoru’s liking. But now? It’s perfect. Suguru kisses his forehead, before looking into his eyes with a smile, and connecting their lips after what feels like an eternity. “You’ve wrecked me.”\n\n“And you, me.” Suguru pants out, hips rolling forwards instead of snapping, already close to finishing. “Come for me, Satoru. I can feel that you’re close.”\n\n“Suguru-” Satoru sobs, shaking his head. It’s so much, he feels cracked open at the seams, he feels seen, for the first time in a long time.\n\n“It’s okay, I’m here with you,” Suguru assures him, panting softly and kissing his cheek. “You can do it, come for me Satoru.”\n\n“Suguru,” Satoru practically whimpers, dick jumping between them as he starts to come, less than earlier but more intense, his eyes rolling back completely as Suguru drifts a hand down to stroke him through it, sweet nothings muttered into messy white hair.\n\n“Good boy, so good,” Suguru tells him, hips stuttering as he groans out, his release practically pulled from him, the way Satoru is milking him. “Oh, so fucking good Satoru.”\n\nSatoru just sobs out a thanks, craning his head to kiss Suguru, a shaking hand coming up to intertwine in black strands. That void hasn’t vanished from his chest, but it’s lightened into something bearable. He cracks open vibrant eyes to look at Suguru’s smiling ones, stopping him as he tries to pull out.\n\n“Stay. Just for a bit longer.”\n\n“Alright,” Suguru laughs, kissing his nose.\n\n“Did you mean it, you want to marry me?” Satoru asks with a smirk, some of his usual cockiness returning to him. “Ass so good you want to put a ring on it?”\n\nSuguru’s laugh is so loud that it jostles them, and Satoru moans at the movement, slapping Suguru’s shoulder as he snickers.\n\n“You ready to be a housewife?” Suguru shoots back, before he groans and collapses on top of Satoru’s sweaty body with an ‘oof’ from both of them. “Ugh, you’ve killed me.”\n\nSatoru hums, drawing little patterns on Suguru’s back, tracing the dragon tattoo like it’s a game of connect the dots. It would be a nice life, being in bed with Suguru forever.\n\n“I’m sorry you felt that way,” Suguru says as he spoons hot oil on the eggs in the pan, flipping it gently with his wrist. There’s already rice and spam on the plates to the side of him, and Satoru is pouring them orange juice from the hotel's refrigerator. It’s a nice suite, kitchen and bathroom included. “You shouldn’t have just laid there and bared it, we’re a team.”\n\n“I thought you didn’t want me like that,” Satoru shrugs, licking some of the sweet juice off his thumb as it dribbles out of the carton. “You’d never bought it up.”\n\n“I should have,” Suguru agrees, gently easing the sunny-side up eggs off his spatula and onto the rice on the plates. Reaching over to switch the stove off before slinging the kitchen towel over his shoulder, carrying both plates to the table. He places them next to each other, and kisses Satoru’s forehead. “We messed this up royally. But the end result is worth it.”\n\nSatoru hums, already shoveling rice and egg into his mouth, moaning in appreciation at the fluffy rice mixed with the gooey egg. Salty spam is not usually his favorite but the way Suguru cooks it has him obsessed.\n\n“D’you think Yaga will have an issue with us?” Satoru asks through a mouth full of food, Suguru making disgustingly in love eyes at him despite the way he’s speaking like a child.\n\n“No,” Suguru says, picking up his chopsticks and snapping them a few times. “He’s always thought we had something, he told me himself.”\n\n“What? When?” Satoru demands, chopsticks pointed at Suguru like weapons.\n\n“Back when I almost defected,” Suguru admits, hints of shame on his face. Satoru pats his hand, the other still shoveling food in his mouth like he’d never eaten before. “He said it would be a shame to leave someone like you behind.”\n\n“Smart man,” Satoru nods, rice falling out of his mouth.\n\n“Yeah.” Suguru side-eyes him, laughing as Satoru shoves his shoulder.\n\nThere’s a peaceful silence between them as they eat, something a lot lighter in the atmosphere compared to how it’s been every other time they've hooked up. In hindsight, Suguru is ashamed for not saying something sooner. He says as much after about ten minutes, and Satoru shakes his head vehemently.\n\n“I could have as well.” Satoru says earnestly. “I’m not sure what happened earlier, I’d never felt like that before. It’s not a usual feeling.”\n\n“Even so,” Suguru replies gently, wrapping his hand around his new boyfriends. Fiances ? “Don’t let me hurt you just because you’re scared I’ll leave. That’s never going to happen.”\n\n“Alright.” Satoru shrugs nonchalantly, despite the fluttering in his heart.\n\nFrom then onwards, Suguru gives more attention to aftercare, even if it’s a quickie. There’s an agreement to spend time after each round, communication and clean-up together as a team. Satoru doubles his own efforts as well, if it’s a night they have time Suguru will find himself in the tub with Satoru rubbing shampoo suds in his long hair, a hairbrush waiting for them on the bed outside.\n\nThere’s something unbelievable to it, someone as important as Satoru wanting a country-raised man like Suguru, and sometimes it gets the better of him as he begs Satoru to tell him over and over that he’ll stay. Maybe something in them broke a little after the Star Plasma events, but as long as they stay honest they can heal it.\n\nShoko had laughed in their faces as they explained months later what finally led to the big confession, before she’d clapped a hand on Satoru’s shoulder and told him to look up something called ‘PCD’ because he sounded like a textbook example. She’d also knocked shoulders with Suguru and told him to come to her next time either of them felt isolated, that they aren’t alone in this ‘godforsaken’ school.\n\nA year later, they’re married in front of the Gojo clan, despite the glares from Satoru’s grandparents. His parents, however, are a lot more gentle when it comes to Satoru and they smile politely as they’re joined by a nice man who offers Suguru and Satoru a lot of blessed happiness.\n\nSuguru and Satoru, the strongest, are forever intertwined. There’s something so wild about how quickly everyone around them accepted it, but Suguru can’t look back at them. He holds Satoru’s hand the entire ceremony - even if that isn’t traditional. His speech is so long that it makes Shoko roll her eyes with a fond smile, but she outright grins as Satoru pulls out an even longer speech, shit-eating grin spread across pink cheeks.\n\nCommunication. Now and forever, that’s their promise."
