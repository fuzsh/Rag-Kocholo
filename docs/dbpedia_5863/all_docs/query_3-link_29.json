        "text": "Whether it’s the name, the jockey, the pedigree, the speed figures or other factors, horse racing fans have all kinds of ways of making their picks for the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThink you have the winner for Saturday’s race at Churchill Downs? First check out these reasons your horse can and can’t win the race.\n\nClick the name of each horse for more information and to watch video of his last prep race.\n\nTacitus\n\nWhy he can win: He’s won three straight races with improving speed figures each time. Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott is due to win his first Kentucky Derby, and the gray Juddmonte Farms homebred may give Mott his best shot.\n\nWhy he won’t: With only four races under his belt, Tacitus is still a bit green when compared to some of the other top Derby contenders. Given Justify’s Triple Crown run last year, perhaps experience no longer means much on the Derby trail. But it still would be nice to see a couple more races underneath him.\n\nMore: Get to know the 20 horses in the field for the 2019 Kentucky Derby\n\nSCRATCHED: Omaha Beach\n\nMore: Omaha Beach out of the 2019 Kentucky Derby after entrapped epiglottis\n\nVekoma\n\nWhy he can win: He’s won at Belmont, Aqueduct and Keeneland, so the track doesn’t seem to matter for this one. Trainer George Weaver is an Atherton High School graduate, and a Derby victory would provide a heck of a story at reunions.\n\nWhy he won’t: He’s won 3 of 4 career races, so maybe Vekoma’s unorthodox running style is irrelevant. It’s just hard to imagine a horse who runs like THAT winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nPlus Que Parfait\n\nWhy he can win: Maybe he didn’t like the Fair Grounds. Throw out those two duds, and Plus Que Parfait has a solid 2-1-2 in five starts. That includes a second and a third at Churchill Downs.\n\nWhy he won’t: The last two winners of the UAE Derby – Thunder Snow in 2017 and Mendelssohn in 2018 – finished last in the Kentucky Derby. Even trainer Brendan Walsh admitted the travel to and from Dubai takes a toll on horses.\n\nDERBY DRAW: Check out the Kentucky Derby 2019 post position draw, jockeys, odds\n\nRoadster\n\nWhy he can win: There was a time last summer that trainer Bob Baffert believed Roadster was the best 2-year-old in his barn. Surgery fixed the breathing issue that was discovered after his only loss, and the two victories this year at Santa Anita have showed promise.\n\nWhy he won’t: He doesn’t have enough experience, and he lost Hall of Fame jockey Mike Smith to Omaha Beach. The Santa Anita Derby set up perfectly, with the early leaders wearing down each other and Roadster picking up the pieces.\n\nRead this: Bob Baffert is a great trainer, but betting on his horses is a 'losing proposition'\n\nBy My Standards\n\nWhy he can win: He’s been in the money in all five career starts, and by all accounts he’s been as impressive as any horse during workouts at Churchill over the past couple of weeks.\n\nWhy he won’t: The “wise-guy” horse never actually wins the Derby, and he seems to have gained that status. There are big questions about his pedigree and ability to get the 1 ¼-mile distance.\n\nMore: The definitive (and totally arbitrary) list of best Derby horse names\n\nMaximum Security\n\nWhy he can win: He’s the only undefeated horse in the field and really hasn’t been challenged in any of his four races, the closest margin being 3 ½ lengths in the Florida Derby. As oddsmaker Mike Battaglia said, it’s possible this horse is a “freak.”\n\nWhy he won’t: His career debut was in a $16,000 claiming race, and trainer Jason Servis hasn’t hid the fact that Maximum Secruity wasn’t exactly a standout horse early in his career. He got away with an easy lead in the Florida Derby, and that won’t happen in the Run for the Roses.\n\nGame Winner\n\nWhy he can win: He still might be the most talented horse in the field, as he enjoyed a dominant 2-year-old campaign that was capped by a victory in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile at Churchill. Perhaps jockey Joel Rosario has learned a thing or two from his two defeats earlier this year.\n\nWhy he won’t: Close losses to Omaha Beach in the Rebel and to Roadster in the Santa Anita Derby are nothing to be ashamed of, but it’s possible Game Winner has a lost a step since last year. Do you trust a horse in the Derby who hasn’t won a race since November?\n\nKentucky Derby Media Poll: Bob Baffert has top 3 horses\n\nCode of Honor\n\nWhy he can win: Trainer Shug McGaughey doesn’t show up at the Derby unless he thinks he has a solid chance to win, and he hasn’t had a Derby horse since Orb’s victory in 2013. Sunday’s speedy workout (four furlongs in 46.80 seconds) showed promise that Code of Honor could be closer to the pace than he’s been in recent races.\n\nWhy he won’t: His career-best Brisnet Speed Figure of 95 is a cut below the best horses in this field, and there are concerns that he’s just not fast enough to be there at the end.\n\nSCRATCHED: Haikal\n\nMore: Haikal scratched from Kentucky Derby with abscess on left front hoof\n\nImprobable\n\nWhy he can win: He has a win at Churchill and did it in impressive fashion, taking the Street Sense by 7 ¼ lengths on Breeders’ Cup weekend. He came straight to Churchill after the Arkansas Derby and seems to love the track.\n\nWhy he won’t: The ownership group of WinStar Farm, China Horse Club and Starlight Racing won last year’s Derby with Justify. The last owner to win back-to-back Derby was Penny Chenery and her Meadow Stable with Riva Ridge (1972) and Secretariat (1973).\n\nWar of Will\n\nWhy he can win: He had won three straight races and was considered a leading Derby contender before suffering a patella muscle injury during the Louisiana Derby and finishing ninth. Trainer Mark Casse is due some Derby luck after top contender Classic Empire was jostled early and finished fourth two years ago.\n\nWhy he won’t: No matter the excuse, it’s hard to imagine the ninth-place finisher from the Louisiana Derby coming back to win the Kentucky Derby. His speed figures would need to take a big jump to compete with the best in this field.\n\nLong Range Toddy\n\nWhy he can win: He showed what’s he’s capable of in the Rebel, rallying to beat Improbable by a neck and securing his spot in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nWhy he won’t: Granted he was on a sloppy track, but his 83 Brisnet Speed Figure in the Arkansas Derby is the lowest last-race number of any horse in the Kentucky Derby field.\n\nTax\n\nWhy he can win: He’s the only horse in the field to have Brisnet Speed Figures over 100 in his last three races. And his pedigree – by Arch out of the Giant’s Causeway mare Toll – suggests the 1 ¼-mile Derby distance won’t be a problem.\n\nWhy he won’t: He had every chance in the world to beat Tacitus in the Wood Memorial and just couldn’t get it done. The water will be even deeper in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nCutting Humor\n\nWhy he can win: If you’re into the final-fractions theory, this is your horse. In winning the Sunland Derby, his times for the final furlong and final three furlongs were the fastest of any horse in the Kentucky Derby field.\n\nWhy he won’t: Mine That Bird is the only winner of the Sunland Derby to win the Kentucky Derby and did so at 50-1 odds. Cutting Humor may be just as big of a long shot.\n\nWin Win Win\n\nWhy he can win: Sunday’s workout at Churchill, in which he chased down Tacitus and Country House down the stretch, was impressive. He’s never finished out of the money (3-2-1) in six career starts.\n\nWhy he won’t: He’s a closer, and there likely won’t be a hot pace in this Derby.\n\nCheck out: Trainers fight long odds to break into an exclusive club: the Kentucky Derby\n\nCountry House\n\nWhy he can win: He may well be in 20th place entering the first turn, but maybe everybody will tire in front of him and jockey Flavien Prat can work out the perfect trip down the stretch.\n\nWhy he won’t: There doesn’t appear to be a lot of early speed in this race, which doesn’t set up well for a horse like Country House who likes to come from way off the pace. With just one career victory, it’s hard to make much of a case for him.\n\nGray Magician\n\nWhy he can win: He’s got some early speed, and his best chance may be to pull a War Emblem and lead from start to finish.\n\nWhy he won’t: UAE Derby winners don’t win the Kentucky Derby, and UAE Derby runners-up certainly don’t.\n\nSpinoff\n\nWhy he can win: He’s finished in the money in all of his races, and it’s dangerous to simply throw out a Todd Pletcher trainee. He figures to be near the front early and could have something left in the tank if the early fractions aren’t too fast.\n\nWhy he won’t: He only has four career starts, and he lost Hall of Fame jockey John Velazquez, who chose to ride Code of Honor instead. Manny Franco will have the mount in the Derby.\n\nMaster Fencer\n\nWhy he can win: Because you believe in miracles?\n\nWhy he won’t: He’s the first horse to qualify via the Japan Road to the Kentucky Derby. Only four horses foaled outside of the United State have won the Derby, the last being Sunny’s Halo (Canada) in 1983.\n\nJason Frakes: 502-582-4046; jfrakes@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @KentuckyDerbyCJ.
