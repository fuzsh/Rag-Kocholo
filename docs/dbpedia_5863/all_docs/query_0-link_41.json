        "text": "There's no argument here that corporate sponsorship is important to Thoroughbred racing institutions if they want to keep playing in the modern sports landscape, despite some cringeworthy couplings. The Ever Ready Epsom Derby (G1) comes to mind.\n\nThe most awkward corporate handshake occurred at the turn of the century between Hollywood Park and Sempra Energy, which paid to attach its name to the Hollywood Gold Cup (G1), the grade 1 marquee race of the summer meet.\n\nIn the wake of California's energy deregulation, Sempra was rolling in profits as homes and businesses suffered the consequences, the racetrack included. Fines were levied, brownouts were common, and blackouts threatened, prompting Hollywood Park management to replace its popular Friday night programs with daylight cards and brace for last-minute cancellations. Sempra, accused of creating fake energy shortages in the manner of the Enron scandal, eventually paid $410 million to settle price-gouging lawsuits.\n\nWhen sponsorships work, and the product has a degree of contemporary acceptance, racing can reap benefits. It's okay, for instance, to wax nostalgic over dear departed events like the Marlboro Cup and Budweiser Million, even though we're not supposed to smoke or drink.\n\nNow comes a new brand to Thoroughbred racing, still respected even in its modern permutations. Churchill Downs has come to terms with Sports Illustrated—once a weekly must-read for sports nuts with a circulation of three million but now a monthly magazine backed by a subscription website—to slap its treasured brand on a ground-floor dining space created as part of the $200 million paddock expansion that will be revealed in all its glory this spring.\n\nClub SI will be swell, I'm sure, and it better be, for $7,500 a head on Derby day. The announcement came with all the Mad Men embellishments as a \"bespoke luxury experience\" and an \"equine-focused dining experience\" that will include \"fine, private restrooms.\"\n\nThe plan is to decorate the walls of Club SI with memorable magazine covers, harking back to a time when there was an intoxicating mystique to being chosen for such recognition.\n\n\"The Sports Illustrated cover has always been iconic, from the time I started my first subscription in 1965,\" said Tim Layden, who spent a quarter of a century with Sports Illustrated, including 19 years on the racing beat, before retiring from the publication in 2019.\n\nThere are plenty of horse racing covers from which to choose for SI Club display, although the curators probably will stay away from the issue dated May 20, 1968, headlined \"Derby Drug Mystery\" and picturing a \"balling gun\" loaded with a white tablet over a soft focus photo of Dancer's Image, who was at the center of the post-race scandal linked to a bute positive.\n\nThe first time major horse racing adorned a Sports Illustrated cover was the issue of Jan. 10, 1955, along with a spread of photos extolling the majesty of Santa Anita Park and accompanied by an essay from Jim Murray, who was on his way to becoming a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist. The most recent solo racing cover celebrated the Triple Crown coronation of American Pharoah , as part of the issue of June 15, 2015, embellished by Layden's reporting.\n\nDuring the decades in between, there were around 40 SI covers with a Thoroughbred racing theme, plus a handful of Standardbreds and even a steeplechase race way back when. However, individual faces from the racing world have been few and far between on SI covers. Elliott Burch was the only trainer, elegantly posed alongside his reigning Horse of the Year Sword Dancer, in February 1960. Otherwise, you had to be a jockey to make the grade.\n\nThe first was Bill Hartack (Sept. 17, 1956), along with a cover story by Daily Racing Form's Joe Hirsch. Eddie Arcaro's seminal \"The Art of Race Riding\" cover was dated June 17, 1957, followed in January of 1958 by Bill Shoemaker's cover—\"Cool Hand With a Hot Horse\"—including text again by Hirsch.\n\nHartack made a second appearance in June 1964 after winning his fourth Kentucky Derby aboard Northern Dancer, and Steve Cauthen also hit the cover twice, including the issue announcing his selection as 1977 Sportsman of the Year. The other jockeys staring out from an SI cover have been John Longden, on the occasion of his 49th birthday in February 1959; Robyn Smith, a brief but compelling lightning rod in 1972; and Julie Krone, in May 1989, in the midst of an exciting Triple Crown season featuring Sunday Silence and Easy Goer.\n\nThose two superstar colts did not make the cover. Neither did Cigar at any point during his reign as a two-time Horse of the Year, nor Rachel Alexandra during her unprecedented campaign of 2009, nor Zenyatta while she was stealing hearts and headlines through three championship seasons. Thankfully, Kelso was a cover boy in November 1961, as America's hope in the Washington, D.C. International, but Round Table, Buckpasser, Damascus, and Dr. Fager were not.\n\nThen again, none of them won the Kentucky Derby (G1), and it is the Derby that has landed Thoroughbred racing on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Or, at least, it used to.\n\nFor seven straight years, the finish shot of the Derby winner was featured like clockwork, from Cannonade's win in the 100th Derby of 1974 through Genuine Risk's historic score in 1980. After that, it's been mostly cover crickets. There has been only Sunny's Halo in 1983, Smarty Jones in 2004, and Mine That Bird in 2009. No Ferdinand, no Alysheba, no Winning Colors. No Silver Charm, no Barbaro, no California Chrome .\n\nYou would think a Triple Crown winner always would make the cover, and you would be right, sort of. Both Affirmed and Seattle Slew double-dipped after their triumphs in the Derby and the Belmont Stakes (G1). American Pharoah's Triple Crown cover photo focused more on the upraised hands of the Belmont throng capturing the moment with their cellphones, but it's the thought that counts. And Secretariat made the SI cover the week before he won the Belmont Stakes, clearly in lockstep with a magazine publishing frenzy that also landed Big Red on the covers of Time and Newsweek, all three dated June 11, 1973. He did not disappoint.\n\nBy the time Justify won the Triple Crown in 2018, Sports Illustrated had gone to a bi-monthly press run often featuring multiple covers. Justify's Belmont Stakes coronation was one of three June 18 issue covers published that week, sharing a \"3 Days 3 Champions\" theme with Kevin Durant of the NBA's Golden State Warriors and Alex Ovechkin of the NHL's Washington Capitals.\n\nThe Derby covers of Smarty Jones and Mine That Bird put Layden in the mix for a place on the Club SI walls. Now with NBC Sports, Layden will be honored with his fourth writing Eclipse Award at the annual dinner, to be held Jan. 25 in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n\"The cover was one of the most powerful sports media forces in the entire sports journalism universe from the seventies into the late nineties, or when ESPN became more powerful,\" Layden said. \"The cover could be used for great leverage in access to athletes and stories. If you were on the cover, you'd made it.\n\n\"Then again,\" Layden added, \"every time on message boards when people would talk about the sanctity of the SI cover, someone will post a picture of a poodle on a cover from a feature on the Westminster Kennel Club.\""
