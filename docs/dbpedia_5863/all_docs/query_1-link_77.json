        "text": "He was born in Kentucky, his breeder was John R. Gaines, the founder of the Breeders Cup. His sire was a great-grandson of Nearco, his dam was the Kentucky Broodmare of the Year in 1974, his half-sister was the Hall of fame filly Tosmah. He did not have much success in his two year old season, he had more success in his three year old season when he stared racing on turf. He won the United Nations Handicap at age five, he raced until age six, he won 9 times, came in second 8 time, and third five. He was never a superstar as a racehorse, but was more of one as a sire. He sired 62 stakes winners, two of witch were Kentucky Derby winners, and was the leading sire in North America two times. Two of his best progeny were, Sunny's Halo who won the 1983 Kentucky Derby, and Sunday Silence, who won the 1989 Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, Breeders Cup Classic, is a Hall of fame inductee, is Japan's most successful sire ever, and is the most successful sire in the world in terms of progeny earnings (upwards of $800 million). Halo is know as a sire of sires, as a lot of his progeny are successful sires in there own right, his progeny have earned over $44 million racing, and quite a lot more in the breeding shed.\n\nOn a side note, he was a very aggressive stallion, and was down right vicious at times. He would catch birds and drown them in his water bucket, and tried to catch and kill a cat once. He wore a muzzle to stop him from getting hold of the stallion handlers, one time he got hold of of one of his handlers arm and shook him like a rag doll, he took the door off his stall to get at someone once, another time he picked up one of his handler by the stomach and took him to the ground and got on his keens on top of him to start to do the real damage, he was stopped before he could do anything serious. He was called \"psychotic\" \"evil\" and \"to mean to die\", there are many more stories about him, he wore a old halter till the day he died, because his handlers would not go into his pasture to remove it, he was thirty-one when he died, they still would not go in there to remove it. He was also known for passing his aggressiveness on to his foal's."
