        "text": "Laffit Pincay Jr. kept Sunny's Halo near the early pace and then drew off to score an impressive 10-length victory today in the $500,000 Louisiana Super Derby at Louisiana Downs.\n\nPlay Fellow, the 6-to-5 favorite ridden by Pat Day, finished second, and My Habitony, with Donald Pierce up, was third.\n\nSunny's Halo, the Kentucky Derby winner, equaled the track record for a mile and a quarter on dirt with a time of 2:01 3/5. Reinvested set that mark on Sept. 25, 1982.\n\nThe winner earned $300,000 for his owner, David J. Foster, a Toronto stockbroker. Sunny's Halo, a Canadian-bred chestnut colt by Halo and Mostly Sunny, improved his career earnings to $1,227,791. He paid $10.80 for $2 to win. At New York Offtrack Betting shops, he returned $7.40. Desert Wine Sets Pace\n\nDesert Wine, ridden by Chris McCarron, broke to an early lead from the inside post in the field of six 3-year-olds. Each carried stakes weight of 126 pounds. Desert Wine led into the backstretch, when Pincay made his move on the outside and pulled away. Play Fellow, jammed back in the pack, broke free in the home stretch and held off a challenge from My Habitony.\n\nMy Habitony finished third by a length. Fourth place went to Desert Wine, a nose ahead of Explosive Wagon. Tanks Brigade ran last. ''He ran a great race today, I felt very confident on him,'' Pincay said of Sunny's Halo. ''We were just galloping. I never even hit him. All I did was show him the whip to keep his mind on things.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
