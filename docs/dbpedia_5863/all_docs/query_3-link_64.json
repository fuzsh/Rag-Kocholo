        "text": "VIEW DESCENT CHART\n\nThe founder of Family #2, Burton's Barb Mare, is listed in the General Stud Book, with the subtitle \"Mr Burton's Natural Barb Mare.\" In old pedigrees she is referred to as \"a Burton Barb Mare,\" which, after the style of the day, probably indicates she was a daughter of Mr. Burton's Barb stallion. All we know of Mr. Burton, at present, is that his first name may have been Dick or Richard, and he may have been connected with the Royal Stud at Hampton Court.\n\nThe Burton Barb Mare was supposedly alive during the reign of Charles II (1660-1685), although her covering sires place her at the end of that era. Dodsworth stood at Hampton Court, and was born c.1672. Dicky Pierson was a son of Dodsdworth and since his only foal of record is his daughter out of this mare, he also probably stood at Hampton Court. Mr. Pelham's Spanker was at stud in the 1680s and 1690s.\n\nThe Burton Barb Mare is listed as the dam of three foals, all bred at Hampton Court: an unnamed filly by Dodsworth, an unnamed filly by Dicky Pierson, and a colt, St. Martin (c.1695), sired by Spanker. Her daughter by Dodsworth produced Morgan's Dun (by a son of Helmsley Turk) and his full sister. This branch of the family eventually petered out. The other daughter, by Dicky Pierson (son of Dodsworth), was the dam of Crofts's Old Thornton and her sister, both by Brimmer. The bulk of Family 2 descends through Croft's Old Thornton and her daughters, bred and developed in the famous stud of John Croft, located first at Croft, and then at Barforth, on the Durham-Yorkshire border.\n\nThe third foal was St Martin, a colt by Spanker. Prior notes that \" This horse was foaled about 1695, and belonged to Lord Wharton. In April, 1701, he won 'an extraordinary fine match and for a good deal of money\" against the Duke of Devonshire's Dimple, who is the earliest recorded winner of The Whip.\" St Martin stood at the Duke of Ancaster's famous Grimsthorpe Stud, and there sired the dam of the famous Old Lady Mare (by Pert), who continued the family (#14) of her dam, the Oldfield mare, in that stud.\n\nThere is some fairly reliable evidence to support that at least part of Family 8 is linked maternally with Family 2. The key is a grey horse known as Hutton's Surley, born around 1708. In the GSB his pedigree, and that of his sister, Bowes, through whom a branch of Family 2 descends, is given as follows: Surley by Hutton's Grey Barb, out of a mare by the Byerley Turk, out of a mare by the Selaby Turk, out of Mr. Place's mare by Hautboy, out of Sister to Morgan's Dun by son of the Helmsley Turk, out of a mare by Dodsworth, out of the Burton Barb Mare (Family 2). However, in the 18th century stud book maintained by the influential breeder Cuthbert Routh, and published by C.M. Prior, in 1924, Early Records of the Thoroughbred Horse, a different pedigree for Hutton's Surley is given. This pedigree states: Surley was \"gott by his [Mr. Hutton's] Grey Barb, his dam by ye Royall Colt, her dam by Byerely Turk, her dam by Bustler, her dam by a Barb, and her dam by Bay Dodsworth.\" This agrees with a pedigree in the GSB for the Coneyskins Mare, whose dam is shown as having the exact same pedigree line as Hutton's Surley, indicating they were brother and sister, although in the GSB the pedigree does not extend back beyond the mare by Bustler. This line has been considered part of the Family of the Bustler Mare, Family 8. Since Hutton's Surley was the sire of Routh's own horse, subsequently known as Routh's Surley, one can assume he was interested in correctly recording the pedigree of his Surley's sire, and further it was recorded around 1723, much earlier than the 1791 compilation of GSB. It appears the GSB pedigree linking Surley and his sister Bowes -- if she was his sister, and not just by the same sire -- to Family 2 is incorrect, and that they properly belong under in Family 8, along with all of Bowes' progeny, but if the Bay Dodsworth mare in Family 8 is the same as the mare by Dosworth out of the Burton Barb Mare, then all of Family 8 should be subsumed under Family 2. Another item of note is that Morgan's Dun, and his sister, in Family 2, were both recorded in the GSB as by a son of the Helmsley Turk. Bustler, sire of the Bustler mare of Family 8, was by the Helmsley Turk.\n\nThere may be some connection with this mare and the #31 family. The first reference to Family 31 is in an entry for a \"Son of Brimmer Mare (sister to Ruffler), Bred by Mr. Bethell, got by a son of Brimmer and the Chesterfield Arabian, out of Dick Burton's mare. (Dick Burton's mare is sometimes described as a Barb.)\" although the GSB does not hint at a link between the two \"Burton\" mares."
