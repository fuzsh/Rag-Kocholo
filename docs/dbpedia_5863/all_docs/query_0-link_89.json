        "text": "There's one bettor in New York who wears his system for playing the races on his license plates. They read ''CAULKS.'' He has known for a number of years what several recent big races have demonstrated to the casual fan: On a muddy track, watch out for a horse wearing mud caulks.\n\nIn the Metropolitan Handicap last Monday, the only horses equipped with caulks were Star Choice and the entry of John's Gold and Sing Sing. Star Choice won at 18-1, and John's Gold finished third. Nine days earlier in the Preakness Stakes, the only horse wearing caulks was Deputed Testamony, and he won at 14-1.\n\nIn New York, the infield tote board lists those horses wearing caulks, but in Maryland this information is not given to the public. The only way to know about Deputed Testamony was to look at his feet in the paddock. Caulks, known among horsemen as stickers, are the equine's equivalent of cleats. They are a ring of small spikes attached to the horseshoe and enable a horse to get a hold on a messy track surface.\n\nHorses with tender feet cannot use caulks because the impact of running on them can hurt their hoofs. Some trainers do not believe in them and think they are dangerous because a horse's foot cannot slide forward when it wears caulks.\n\nThe bettor with ''CAULKS'' on his license plates, who prefers to remain anonymous, says that he ignores his other handicapping theories when he sees a horse wearing caulks and bets such runners blindly. Had he not been tied up at a wedding, he says, that's what he would have done in the 1980 Belmont Stakes. The only horse in the field wearing caulks that day was named Temperence Hill. He won by a length and a half in the mud and paid $108.40 for $2.\n\nA field of nine is shaping up for the Belmont Stakes June 11, the third leg of the Triple Crown. The last four Belmont winners - Conquistador Cielo, Summing, Temperence Hill and Coastal - did not race in either of the first two Triple Crown races. This year, however, the two favorites for the race both ran in the Kentucky Derby but skipped the Preakness.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
