        "text": "A quintessential New England wedding on the coast of Maine, complete with some beloved dogs, a pre-ceremony boat ride, and TWO wedding dresses!\n\nKatie and John’s love story started in a classic way – boy sees girl from across the room at a bar (or was it girl sees boy?) in New Hampshire. They hit it off and started dating 8 years ago, moving to Florida along the way. Last January, Katie was in the kitchen, setting the table for a nice dinner for the two of them. She had no idea that John was in the bedroom with their two dogs, outfitting them with bandanas that read, “Will you marry me?”! Katie said ‘Yes!’ of course, and the wedding planning began!\n\nI met Katie and John 5 years ago when I photographed Katie’s best friend’s wedding. Katie was Rebecca’s Maid of Honor, and last weekend, Rebecca was able to return the favor by being Katie’s Matron of Honor! Katie is a vet tech, and grew up in Topsfield, Mass. Her love of animals is very clear in her adoration for her two rescue pups, whom they flew all the way up here to Maine from Florida to be a part of the wedding! John was born in Maine, and raised in Florida. He was in the Navy (thank you for your service!), and is now in school for civil engineering. Katie and John love to go boating together, and they love New England, so they wanted to come “home” and celebrate their wedding among friends and family here!\n\nI knew it was going to be a fun day when I walked into the girl’s getting ready room and heard Backstreet Boys playing! I sung along as I photographed the bridal details – just wait until you see the dress(es)! The hair and makeup artists were amazing and fast, and the girls were finished in no time, and were able to relax and drink mimosas until it was time to get into the dress! Scroll down to read more about this amazing day and see the gorgeous photos!\n\nVenue and Catering: Nonantum Resort, Kennebunkport, Maine\n\nFlorals: Brenda’s Bloomers, Cape Neddick, Maine\n\nCakes and Desserts: Topsfield Bake Shop, Topsfield, Massachussetts\n\nBridesmaid Dresses: David’s Bridal\n\nMakeup: Salon Loka, Ogunquit, Maine\n\nHair: Newbury North Salon, Lynnfield, Massachussetts\n\nSuits: Men’s Wearhouse\n\nBridal Gown: Madeleine’s Daughter, Portsmouth, New Hampshire\n\nThis is one of the best dessert displays I’ve ever seen! I love the soft colors in the cakes, as well as the assortment of cookies, donuts, and Whannolis! What’s a Whannoli, you ask? Well, that’s a trademarked name for a special Whoopie Pie and cannoli combination exclusively invented and made by the Topsfield Bake Shop! Now, I have to preface this by saying that I’m not a huge cannoli fan, but I was able to snag one of these on my way out the door later that night, and let me tell you … I might be making a special trip down to Topsfield sometime soon to get some more! They’re so delicious!"
