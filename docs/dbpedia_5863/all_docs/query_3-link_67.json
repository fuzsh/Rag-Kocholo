        "text": "It is the end of January which means that the Derby Prep season is starting to gain momentum. This weekend is the Sam F Davis and San Vicente Stakes, while neither offer points to get into the starting gate they both are stepping stones to getting to Churchill Downs.\n\nSomething weird that the thoroughbred industry does is make all horses’ birthdays January 1. It doesn’t matter if they were born on January 1st or June 26th, come the new year they will all be one year old officially. This is so make races such as the Kentucky Derby simpler to qualify for, and so June-babies don’t run in it when they are actually three but physically much bigger and mature than the others.\n\nIn North America foals start coming out right on January 1 and go until about May but sometimes they do get late into June. You’d think that logically you’d want to aim your horses to be born as early as possible. But with places like Kentucky being where the vast majority of horses are born and raised, do you really want your newborn to start his life in the middle of winter? Or would you rather him be a little younger than some, but have a much stronger foundation in the spring with the weather much warmer.\n\nI’ll Have Another’s birthday is April 1. Always known as a prankster, his biggest joke he pulled was his Triple Crown attempt.\n\nAfter thinking about that for a while, I wanted to look into when all the Derby winners were born and when is it best for them to start. In the 2012 Media Guide for the Kentucky Derby they have a list of all the Derby winners (through 2011) and when they were born. Some years are not recorded their birthdate. Proud Clarion, Tomy Lee, Johnstown, and Lawrin do not have their birth date on record. Neither do most horses between 1875 and 1934 with some exceptions (Gallant Fox, Black Gold, Sir Barton, Exterminator and Vagrant). Out of 140 winners, only 79 have the birthdate recorded.\n\nNow of those that do, here are some interesting things I noticed.\n\nGrindstone is the oldest horses to ever win, and the only one who was born in January on the 23rd.\n\nNo Derby winner has been born in June.\n\nThe youngest Derby winner is Exterminator, who barley made the cut for May and was born on the 30th.\n\nThe month that has produced the most winners is March, with 28 winners\n\nMarch 23 has the most winners born on that day with three–Foolish Pleasure, Venetian Way, and Gallant Fox\n\nGallant Fox and Omaha are the only father-son combo to win the Triple Crown, and their birthdays are a day apart, March 23 and March 24.\n\nMarch 24 is the birthday of two winners, and both won the Triple Crown. Omaha and Count Fleet.\n\nThere are 10 days where winners share a birthday. February 15 (Genuine Risk and Seattle Slew), February 17 (Spectacular Bid and Black Gold), February 23 (Street Sense and Gato Del Sol), March 4 (Sea Hero and Bold Venture), March 23 (Foolish Pleasure, Venetian Way, and Gallant Fox), March 24 (Count Fleet and Omaha), March 29 (Lil E. Tee and Jet Pilot), April 19 (Tim Tam and Hill Gail), April 29 (Barbaro and Needles) and May 2 (Lucky Debonair and War Admiral)\n\nThe best week to be born is the week of March 23nd through 30th, with 11 born in that span.\n\nSeven horses had not had their third birthday when they won the race. Mine That Bird, Thunder Gulch, Spend a Buck, Cannonade, Northern Dancer, Exterminator and Vagrant.\n\nHeres a breakdown on how many were born per month (and the year the horse won):\n\nJanuary: 1 (1996)\n\nFebruary: 19 (2014, 2013, 2007, 2005, 2004, 2002, 2001, 1997, 1983, 1982, 1980, 1979, 1978, 1977, 1970, 1963, 1944, 1942, and 1924)\n\nMarch: 28 (2011, 2010, 1999, 1998, 1992, 1991, 1990, 1993, 1989, 1988, 1987, 1986, 1976, 1975, 1973, 1969, 1968, 1960, 1957, 1955, 1947, 1946, 1945, 1943, 1940, 1936, 1935, and 1930)\n\nApril: 21 (2012, 2008, 2006, 2003, 2000, 1994, 1984, 1972, 1971, 1966, 1961, 1958, 1956, 1954, 1952, 1951, 1950, 1949, 1948, 1941, and 1919)\n\nMay: 10 (2009, 1995, 1985, 1981, 1974, 1965, 1964, 1937, 1918 and 1876)\n\nOrb’s birthday is February 24\n\nWhat about those born in warmer climates like Florida, California, or Texas? Since they don’t get harsh winters like Kentucky, New York or Maryland, did they aim for early birthdates? Short answer, not really.\n\nFlorida has six Derby winners: Needles (April 29), Carry Back (April 16), Foolish Pleasure (March 23), Affirmed (February 21), Unbridled (March 5), and Silver Charm (February 22).\n\nCalifornia has four winners: Morvich (unrecorded), Swaps (March 1), Decidedly (unrecorded) and California Chrome (February 18).\n\nTexas has two winners: Assault (March 26) and Middleground is unrecorded.\n\nCalifornia and Texas only have three horses between them on record, but of those three there was not much of a difference with everyone else. Florida has a bit more, and a bit on the early side but still pretty evenly spread out.\n\nWhat about Canada? Its pretty cold up there so surely they aim for a bit later. Their two winners are Northern Dancer, the second youngest colt who was born on May 27 and Sunny’s Halo on February 11. So, no real difference but it is only a two horse sample size.\n\nThe grumpy gelding Funny Cide surprised the state of Kentucky when he announced he would be the spokeshorse for the Legalize It campaign, as his birthday is April 20. His family in friends in New York were less surprised.\n\nAfter looking at this for a while it is pretty much what was expected. Late March is the ideal time for a Derby winner to be born, but anytime between February and April works well. But there is no point that is clearly the absolute best time to foal out.\n\nIt is worth remembering that this year the Derby falls on May 2, which is the birthday of two winners, Lucky Debonair and War Admiral.\n\nSide note: Here are the birthdays of the current Top 10 point earners for the 2015 Kentucky Derby, kind of cool that seven share it with a past winner.\n\nEl Kabeir: March 18 (same as Super Saver)\n\nInternational Star: March 14 (same as Winning Colors)\n\nUpstart: April 13 (same as Riva Ridge)\n\nCarpe Diem: February 29 (leap year, same as Chateaugay)\n\nCalculator: April 5\n\nTexas Red: March 15 (same as Hoop Jr)\n\nMr. Z: January 12 (will be oldest horse to ever win the Derby if he does)\n\nFar Right: March 4 (same as Sea Hero and Bold Venture)\n\nOcho Ocho Ocho: April 2 (same as Whirlaway)\n\nAmerican Pharoah: February 2\n\nThe 59th running of the Kentucky Derby on May 6, 1933 was one of those races that even 80 years later people still talk about. The only photo of the fight itself, taken by Courier Journal photographer Wallace Lowry, is the most requested reprint of any image in the Courier Journal archives. [1]\n\nThere are a few rumors as to how Lowry was able to get this shot. Some say he was asleep on the ground before the race began and woke up just in time to take the shot, others say he was drunk when he rolled on the track, snapped the shot, and quickly got back under the rail. Regardless of how he got it, what would be called the “Fighting Finish” is one of the most famous racing photographs. [1]\n\nBut what is going on here? The race came down to two horses, Head Play on the left ridden by 22-year-old Herb Fisher and Broker’s Tip on the right, ridden by 18-year-old Don Meade and owned by Colonel E. R. Bradley. While neither horse was the favorite, Head Play was the more accomplished horse. Broker’s Tip had come in third in the Cincinnati Trophy as a two-year-old, and that was his most impressive finish. Head Play on the other hand won that race, the Hawthorne Juvenile, and the prestigious Derby Trial run a few days before the Kentucky Derby. As they ran down the stretch, Head Play begins to drift into Broker’s Tip, so Meade tries to push Fisher away which leads to Fisher grabbing Broker’s Tip’s saddle cloth, and Meade grabbing Fisher’s shoulder.[2] [3] After the finish, Fisher hits Meade with his whip. Fisher called a foul after the race for interference, as a horse drifting into another was legal, but the stewards disallowed it. [2] [4] Even after the race, the two fought in the jockey’s room which resulted in Meade being suspended for 30 days, and Fisher for 35. [2]\n\nHere is a screen grab of the finish. This is not an official photo, as they didn’t exist then, but even at full speed it is clear that something is, you might say, fishy, with the result besides the brawl itself.\n\nIt does not help that the camera is positioned just before the finish, but from the replay and this unofficial screenshot, it is pretty clear that Head Play was across the line first. With no photo finish cameras and no replay, the stewards declared Broker’s Tip the winner. Herb Fisher broke into tears after hearing the result, and until his dying day insisted that he and Head Play had won. [4]\n\nAfter the Derby, Head Play would go on to win the Preakness, Suburban Handicap, San Antonio Handicap, and the Bay Meadows Handicap with career earnings of almost $110,000. Broker’s Tip on the other hand, ended his career with the Kentucky Derby as his only win.\n\nColonel E. R. Bradley of Idle Hour Stock Farm was one of the most important figures in racing in the 1920s and 1930s after purchasing his first major stallion Black Toney from John Keene in 1912. Later in 1930 Bradley purchased one of the most influential mares of all time, La Troienne. Every horse Bradley owned had names starting with the letter “B”. Notable horses he owned were Hall of Famers Blue Larkspur, Bimelech, and a daughter of War Admiral that he bred but sold named Busher. In 1926 he purchased the Fair Grounds Racetrack in New Orleans, Louisiana to restore it and was an investor in Miami’s winter getaway, Hialeah Park. Occasionally he would host race meets at Idle Hour to benefit Kentucky orphans. [5]\n\nHe was so prominent on the national level that the May 7, 1934 edition of TIME Magazine featured him on the cover. In 2014, he was inducted into the National Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nThe chart for the race declares Broker’s Tip as “much the best” even though he only won by a nose. [2] Some people claim that the only reason Bradley’s horse was the winner of that race was due to Colonel Bradley’s prominence in Kentucky racing. With no clear way to decide, the stewards declared Bradley’s horse the winner, in what would be his fourth and final win.\n\nThe result of the race has been debated since the horses crossed the finish line in 1933, the two strongest voices being the jockeys, Don Meade and Herb Fisher. Regardless of what people say happened, the result will always be the same: Broker’s Tip is the official winner of the 59th Kentucky Derby, with Head Play a nose behind in second.\n\nSources used:\n\n[1] http://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/2014/05/02/8625007/\n\n[2] http://www.horseracingbusiness.com/a-fight-to-the-finish-9804.htm\n\n[3] http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-12-23/news/9612220157_1_dennis-meade-horse-trainer-mr-meade\n\n[4] http://www.kyforward.com/robert-treadway-disputed-1933-ky-derby-came-to-a-%E2%80%98fighting-finish%E2%80%99-%E2%80%93-between-jockeys/\n\n[5] https://www.racingmuseum.org/hall-of-fame/e-r-bradley\n\nThe Eclipse Awards rock. The rules of what should be considered vs. what shouldn’t be considered is up for debate which makes the votes inconsistent since people have different ideas for what they think the awards should be. But here is how I would vote if I had one, and why.\n\nTwo-Year-Old Filly – Take Charge Brandi\n\nThese Juvenile are always hard, because it normally defaults to the Breeders Cup winner. But this year, Brandi is a very interesting horse. She fell flat this summer but after a questionable BC win, she really showed everyone what she is made of. The other consideration is Lady Eli, who is likely the most talented of the juveniles, however she didn’t quite do enough on the track to deserve the win.\n\nTwo-Year-Old Colt – American Pharoah\n\nYes, Texas Red totally smashed the field in the Juvenile but American Pharoah did smash Texas Red before hand. He has more GI wins than Texas Red. Another horse for consideration would be Hootenanny, but I am of the frame of mind that what a horse does outside of the USA should not count towards Eclipse voting. Though since his name is misspelled that makes me want Texas Red to get it out of spite.\n\nFemale Sprinter – Judy The Beauty\n\nI mean, who else?\n\nMale Sprinter – Work All Week\n\nWon a lot of nothing races, but still won them. Silenced doubters in the Sprint, showed he is the best one out there.\n\nTurf Female – Dayatthespa\n\nTwo GIs under her belt, beat everyone in the Breeders Cup.\n\nTurf Male – Main Sequence\n\nEasy. Four open-company races, won them all strongly. Sorry Wise Dan, but this isn’t a sentimental award.\n\nThree-Year-Old Filly – Untapable\n\nBecause, come on.\n\nThree-Year-Old Male – California Chrome\n\nThis, along with Horse of the Year, is easily the most debated award. My vote would be for Chrome because besides one bad race off a layoff, he has been on top of his game throughout all of 2014. Five race win streak before the Belmont, all stakes races. Ran awesome, but not quite enough in the Classic and on top of that has another Grade 1 win on the turf. Bringing his total to 4 G1s, and a G2.\n\nBayern as another big choice is easy to pick. The horse won the Classic and also dominated the Haskell, Woody Stephens and PA Derby showing a lot of versatility at the distances. “Only” has two G1s and two G2s. However, he has two huge blunders last and second to last in the Travers and Preakness are enough for me to think he doesn’t deserve the title.\n\nPoor Shared Belief. Besides that controversial Classic the horse has 3 G1s (two of which beating older horses) and a G2 for an almost perfect season. He would be a slam dunk if he won the Classic, but he lost a lot of respect with that fourth place finish and the labored Malibu. He deserves to be in the conversation, but just not enough compared to Chrome or Bayern.\n\nOlder Female – Closed Hatches\n\nUgh, this one is tough. It should be “Older Dirt Female”, but there was no dominant horse for the whole year. Hatches looked like the best, which she definitely was, but something happened in the fall and she just wasn’t the same horse. She still has three G1s, though! Don’t Tell Sophia surged towards the end, but wasn’t enough to totally surpass Close Hatches.\n\nOlder Male – Goldencents\n\nThis is another hard one. Should be “Older Dirt Male”. Once again there is not shining star, and Goldencents doesnt have too many wins under his belt this year, he has a Breeders Cup win and a G2 win, but finished second in three G1s. The other horse for this would be Palace Malice who also has only one G1 win. This division is tough, but since Goldencents won a Breeders Cup race I think he noses out the win.\n\nHorse of the Year – California Chrome\n\nHe beats out Shared Belief and Bayern for reasons mentioned above. The other horse to consider would be Main Sequence, but I give Chrome the win in this because being at the top all year round should be rewarded, while Main Sequence started his perfect year in July and only ran four times this year."
