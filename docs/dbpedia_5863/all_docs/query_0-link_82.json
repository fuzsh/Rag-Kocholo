Many of his partners are well-known personalities in the California racing community—trainers such as Bill Spawr, Jeff Bonde, and Bob Hess Jr., and fellow owners Bob Bone, Terry Lovingier, Phil Lebherz, and Alan Klein, among others. The affable Brown is best known for his partnership with Lebherz and Klein in the syndicate supporting the popular 17-year-old stallion Smiling Tiger that has produced so many winners and sale horses for them over the years. He also is the sole owner of a few horses, most notably his versatile California homebred Shady Tiger, a Smiling Tiger 3-year-old gelding who recently won the Snow Chief Stakes Presented by City National Bank. But many other partners among Brown’s more than 60 ownership combinations are often people who see how much he enjoys the sport and want to get involved, he says. Some... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nA Period of Transition\n\nThe California Thoroughbred Foundation is in a period of transition. We have been known for annually granting scholarships to veterinary students and a fellowship for graduate research in the veterinary field. We maintained a voluminous library of equine literature and an extensive collection of art, trophies, and memorabilia—both once available to the public at the California Thoroughbred Breeders Association headquarters in Arcadia. Innumerable winners of our scholarships have gone on to careers in the horse world, including recently as members of the safety teams at California racetracks. Research by graduate students at the University of California, Davis, working with the help of our Louis R. Rowan Fellowship in Equine Studies, has enhanced the health and well-being of horses everywhere. An endowment is being established at the U. C. Davis School of Veterinary Medicine to enhance the Foundation’s Rowan Fellowship. It will fund two fellowships each year and will be named the California Thoroughbred Foundation/Rowan Fellowships. Another endowment, at Western University of Health Sciences College of Veterinary Medicine in Pomona,... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nJoe Navarro\n\nEQUINE BOOK INSPIRES RACEHORSE OWNER Joe Navarro has always loved horse racing lore. “Movies like ‘Seabiscuit’ and ‘Secretariat’ were important,” said Navarro, a California Thoroughbred Breeders Association member since 2019. “They were great for horse racing and the country. We need stories like these in America today.” Navarro, who considers racing his hobby, is trying to add to that inspirational list. One horse story has grabbed the Texas native’s attention like no other: Never Say Die—a near-dead new-born foal saved with a bottle of bourbon who became an international superstar. From that difficult beginning, the son of Nasrullah went on to win the 1954 Epsom Derby—the first Kentucky-bred to accomplish the feat—and the St. Leger Stakes, the oldest of the British classics, by a whopping 12 lengths. That was only a part of the amazing true tale as described in the 2013 book, Never Say Die, written by James C. Nicholson. Navarro calls the story “Seabiscuit on steroids.” It involves significant touchstones, both for racing and popular culture, beginning with... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nCharlize Zuraek Receives Scholarship\n\nCharlize Zuraek is the recipient of the California Thoroughbred Foundation’s 2024 Western University of Health Sciences scholarship. The Foundation awards scholarships to students at Western University as well as to students at the University of California, Davis. These extraordinary young people are training for a life of service to horses. Ever since her mother adopted an off-the-track Thoroughbred, Charlize has been interested in horses and was soon headed for her career goal of becoming an equine veterinarian. She competed in reining and was on the NCAA Division 1 Women’s Equestrian Team during the time she was doing her undergraduate work at U.C. Da-vis. She subsequently entered veterinary school at Western, where she expects to complete her degree in 2025. Charlize has served veterinary externships with Starwood Equine Veterinary Services, Pioneer Equine Hospital, and two locations of the Steinbeck Peninsula Equine Clinics. As part of the annual convention of the American Association of Equine Practitioners held in San Diego, she participated in Del Mar Student Day to learn more about racetrack... ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2024 Northern California Sale\n\nTuesday, August 13, 2024, at noon, Alameda County Fairgrounds, Pleasanton, CA Sales result in PDF format Sales result in Excel format Agent Authorization Credit Request The Request to Purchase by Credit or Check form is to be presented to CTBA Sales in order that the request can be verified and approved.

But his star Clubhouse Ride put him in the spotlight anyway. First as a multiple graded stakes winner of more than $1.3 million and since then as one of the top stallions in California, the 16-year-old son of undefeated Pacific Classic (G1) winner Candy Ride has been a hit-maker since his first foal crop reached the track. Among the state’s top 10 stallions since 2020 with stand-out runners such as Brickyard Ride and Warren’s Showtime, Clubhouse Ride, standing at Legacy Ranch, ranked first on the California general sire list for 2024 with progeny earnings of $1,103,943 as of March 20. Seidner, 83, is a successful businessman who owns a car dealership, Toyota of Glendora, and an automobile repair business, Seidner’s Collision Center. He started the latter in Rosemead in 1964, and it has grown to 13 locations in California’s San Gabriel Valley. Seidner has... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nRowan Fellowship to Gordon\n\nThe California Thoroughbred Foundation has awarded the 2023 Louis R. Rowan Fellowship Award to Shadira Gordon, a PhD student in the epidemiology graduate group at the University of California, Davis. During the first two years of her PhD, Shadira conducted a case-control study to evaluate the effect of host characteristics, diet, and biosecurity protocols in California performance horses during a equine-alphaherpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) outbreak. Her results pinpointed such crucial factors influencing EHV-1 susceptibility as how often horses attend competitions, the number of horses attending from the same facility, and the nature of competitive activities. Currently, Shadira is working on identifying and categorizing the strains isolated during the ongoing EHV-1 out-break, which has affected more than 15 California counties. Her goal is to integrate potential prevention strategies, the genetic characteristics of EHV-1 and EHM, and social network analyses of Thoroughbred horse movements between events. Beyond her research, Shadira strongly advocates for One Health initiatives. She has been a regular participant and discussion leader at events like the UC Davis Education Conference on... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nWilliam Peeples\n\nCAL-BRED INVESTMENTS PAY OFF FOR LONGTIME BANK EXECUTIVE After a lifetime of making careful investments, William Peeples wants to follow his own instincts—and smell the roses. Peeples, 81 in April, is retiring from the Goleta bank he helped start 35 years ago. That will allow him more time to spend with his wife, Ardyce, and continue pursuit of another major interest—racing Thoroughbreds. As a longtime pinhooker and client of bloodstock agent John Brocklebank, Peeples applied to horse acquisition much the same investment knowledge he used in banking. He bought and sold his best young horses and realized returns that he later reinvested. Nowadays, he’s keeping the horses he buys to race himself. “I’ve always treated racing as a business, an avocation, I guess,” Peeples said. “It’s a divergence from what I’m used to. Racing is just another world, so much more relaxing, even though I get very nervous beforehand if I have a horse running. Of course, there’s the thrill of winning a race. “It’s a challenge as well, the... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nGenerous Donors Make Foundation Projects Possible\n\nThe California Thoroughbred Foundation sincerely thanks the following for their generous donations supporting our programs.

But the part-time horseman has discovered a gem of his own in California-bred Daddysruby, winner of the La Brea Stakes (G1) at Santa Anita. As luck would have it, Reger, who has been in the oil business for nearly 50 years, didn’t have to dig very deep. Th is 3-year-old gray or roan daughter—fittingly by the Ontario-based sire named Frac Daddy—is out the very first horse he owned, a Washington-bred mare named Youtheprizeandi. Reger, who breeds and races as Jethorse LLC, calls her “The Prize.” The 15-year-old daughter of You and I has provided the lifelong Billings resident with a number of other firsts. She was his first winner and later, his first broodmare. She produced Reger’s initial winner as a breeder as well, a stakes-placed California-bred colt by Scat Daddy named Daddysprize who earned $119,973 while winning four of 10 starts.... ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2024 Index to Photographs and Videos\n\nCheckmate Thoroughbreds LLC (Adrian Gonzalez), Agent 25 Dark Bay or Brown Filly by More Than Ready out of Poster Girl (GB) (photo) (video) 46 Bay Colt by Sir Prancealot (IRE) out of Silky Slew (video) 54 Dark Bay or Brown Colt by Halladay out of Spun Cap (photo) 73 Bay Colt by Danzing Candy out of Yolanda B.

These days, Nentwig manages a stable of 55 horses spread among half a dozen trainers for his investor group. Best known for importing turf runners from Ireland, Nentwig has come a long way since he began claiming a few horses with friends at Northern California tracks while still a college student at California State University, Hayward (now East Bay) in the 1990s. As things developed, it was a pair of California-breds—one acquired through a claim and one that he co-bred—that helped him at pivotal points of his journey.

In the final race of the first day of the Breeders’ Cup World Championships Nov. 3 at Santa Anita Park, Bus Buzz was in distress when pulled up in upper stretch while battling for the lead. The mishap, over in an instant, stunned the large crowd, which let out a collective gasp. PETA, in a statement released Nov. 7, questioned whether track and Breeders’ Cup officials, as well as trainer Steve Knapp, were covering up the condition of the 3-year-old Bus Buzz to avoid scrutiny. The group has long been opposed to the horse racing industry and closely monitors negative publicity about the sport.... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nThe Season of Giving\n\nHappy holidays from the California Thoroughbred Foundation, one of the largest contributors to scholarships for veterinary students at the University of California, Davis and Western University in Pomona. Our scholarships go to students focused on Thoroughbred breeding and racing. In addition, we award the Louis R. Rowan Fellowship Award to a PhD research fellow at Davis. The most recent Rowan Fellowship went to Christina Rohlf, a PhD candidate in the biomedical engineering graduate group at the University of California, Davis. Megan Elcombe and Silke Hoffmann received this year’s scholarships at Davis, while Cassandra (Cassie) Bernas was the recipient at Western University. All three have a strong interest in equine veterinary care and have served internships that have furthered that passion. Bernas’ family owns several off-the-track Thoroughbreds, an example of the importance of the Thoroughbred industry to these recipients. “They have made such a large impact on my life,” Bernas said, “and I hope to continue to make a positive impact on their industry and lives as well.” ...\n\nRead More →\n\nJohn Tipton\n\nHorse owner John Tipton has been a familiar presence at Bay Area racetracks and the summer fair meets for more than three decades. Since 2000, his horses—competing mostly at the lower claiming levels—have banked more than $1 million, according to Equibase. And those are just the horses he’s owned outright, not to mention the 30 or so racing partnerships to which he has belonged. He’s bred a few horses as well. But, he admits, nothing he has done in the business comes close to the attention he has garnered since he and his daughters, Alissa and Hallie, began a new racing venture called Mean Girls Racing Stable. The ultimate goal behind it—a successful women’s-only racehorse ownership syndicate—is a ways off , Tipton knows. But they are laying the foundation. The stable name, of course, comes from the iconic 2004 comedy film about high school life for an exclusive gang of fashion-obsessed coeds that starred Lindsay Lohan and Tina Fey. Both Alissa and Hallie said it was one of their favorite... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nAs 2023 Comes to a Close …\n\nWe are heading towards a crisis in the equine veterinary world, with only about one percent of veterinary students choosing to go into equine prac-tice—down from four percent in the mid-2000s (according to research by the American Veterinary Medical Association). When you add the number of retiring veterinarians leaving the field and current veterinarians leaving in search of better pay and more regular working hours, the availability of primary and emergency care for horses in the United States and beyond will be seriously affected. Pursuing a veterinary degree is an expensive endeavor, and students typically graduate with massive student debt. The California Thoroughbred Foundation is committed to supporting and encouraging equine veterinary students at the University of California at Davis and Western University of Health Sciences Pomona through annual scholarships. Our scholarships are some of the very few that support third-year students and graduate research fellows at a time when they need it most. Donors like you are the backbone of our success.

How many other horse breeders can say they had the iconic hip-hop star MC Hammer’s backup dancers practicing their choreography in his living room? Bet U can’t touch that. True story: While Ganje was attending Cal State Hayward, where he played football and ran track in the early 1990s, his teammate and roommate Alonzo Carter was part of the Hammer dance troupe that used their place to practice. Ganje was caught up in the excitement as well, tagging along with Hammer — who enjoyed success in racing for a time with his Oaktown Stable — throughout the rapper’s “U Can’t Touch This” tour. Ganje even entertained the thought of a musical career himself, rapping on a demo recording for Hammer before abandoning the idea. “I didn’t really have the talent,” he says. These days, the fast footwork that Ganje appreciates most are from the horses he owns, like the recent graded stakes winner Shotgun Hottie and the 2-year-old California-bred juvenile Lord... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nVictor Flores\n\nCAMARADERIE PUTS MORE FUN INTO RACING As far back as grade school, horse owner Victor Flores has been driven to succeed. Bored with the classes he was taking at Workman High School in La Puente and restless to make his way in the world, Flores decided he’d had enough during the second half of his sophomore year. After being informed by his counselor that he was so far behind in credits that he would not be able to graduate on time, the 16-year-old Flores passed the GED test. By the next week, he was working in a manufacturing plant. “My parents totally signed off on my decision,” Flores said. “They knew I wouldn’t just lay around.” Often working two jobs at a time, he found his way to Dow Hydraulic Systems in 1987 as an employee for a company that manufactures and tests precision hydraulic parts for the aerospace industry. Thirty-six years later, he is the general manager and co-owner of the firm, which he said has about 100 employees... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nRowan Fellowship to Rohlf\n\nThe California Thoroughbred Foundation has awarded the 2022 Louis R. Rowan Fellowship Award to Christina Rohlf, a PhD candidate in the biomedical engineering graduate group at the University of California, Davis. Since childhood, Christina has been interested in using science and technology to advance veterinary medicine. Therefore, she chose to study biomedical engineering to apply concepts to the development of emerging technologies for use in animal medicine. In 2015, Christina received a bachelor of science degree in biomedical engineering from Texas A&M University with a focus in musculoskeletal biomechanics. At Texas A&M, she also conducted research investigating the success rate of different toggle pin fixation methods for canine subjects. After graduation, Christina chose to attend graduate school at U.C. Davis because it offered a collaborative biomedical engineering graduate program and a veterinary school, allowing her to simultaneously advance both of her career interests. As a graduate student Christina has applied biomedical engineering design principles to further the health of equine athletes by fabricating a custom mechanical testing apparatus to monitor... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nTIZAMAGICIAN: The Magic Of Tiznow\n\nTIZMAGICIAN: Consistent, Durable, And Gritty 2024 Fee: $3,000 Standing at Milky Way Farm 34174 De Portola Rd Temecula, CA 92592 Inquiries to Linda Madsen (909) 241-6600 milkywaycattle@aol.com ...\n\nRead More →\n\nNorthern California Yearling Sale Results\n\nSee final sales results of 2023 Northern California Yearling Sale ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2023 Index to Photographs and Videos\n\nCheckmate Thoroughbreds LLC (Adrian Gonzalez), Agent for Jason Hall 36 Street Colors by Mucho Macho Man out of Ocean Colors (see photo) Checkmate Thoroughbreds LLC 97 Bay Filly by Sir Prancealot (IRE) out of Zagrah (GB) (see photo) 137 Dark Bay or Brown Filly by Sir Prancealot (IRE) out of Cotton’s Point (see photo) 147 Bay Colt by Tapiture out of Empire Kate (see photo) Checkmate Thoroughbreds LLC (Adrian Gonzalez), Agent 74 Dark Bay or Brown Filly by Mitole out of Suzy’sprideofparis (see photo) 80 Bay Colt by Sir Prancealot (IRE) out of Tizzy (see photo) 117 Gray or Roan Colt by Smiling Tiger out of Bella Ice (see photo) Easterbrook Livestock Management, Agent 145 Bay Filly by Klimt out of Edgehill Road (see photo) Milky Way Farm, Agent 4 It’s a Factor by The Factor out of Liberty Kitten (see photo) 15 Golden Empire by Passion for Gold out of Make Me Adorable 29 Kapalua Ride by Mastery out of Modest (see photo) 31 Naples Coast by Graydar out... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nKen Miles\n\nBUILDING TRUST WITH EVERY FOAL HE BREEDS Ken Miles, breeder of Old Pal, winner of this year’s Snow Chief Stakes Presented by City National Bank, says he tries to keep one thing in mind as his young horses are preparing for the eventual sales ring. “A horse may have many owners during its lifetime; you never know what will happen after leaving you,” he said. “But it will only have one breeder. Your name will always be attached to that horse.” Getting a young charge to accept the “human touch” is one of the most important qualities he can instill in order to forge a successful transition to racehorse, says the Washington breeder. Beginning as early as possible in a young horse’s life, Miles wants a weanling to become accustomed to being handled. “Not only do I love it (playing with the foals), but it’s to their beneﬁt, I really believe that,” he said. “Over time, it builds a lot of trust.” Even if the horse only has a short... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nUC Davis Scholarships\n\nThe California Thoroughbred Foundation, in its continuing mission to advance education in equine health, awarded scholarships to Megan Elcombe and Silke Hoﬀmann. The two candidates study at the University of California at Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Megan, also selected to receive The Jockey Club Scholarship, is president of the UC Davis veterinary school class of 2024. She received her bachelor’s degree at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and pursued her master’s in animal science at Southern Illinois University. While at Southern Illinois, she assisted with research on folliculogenesis in mares and new reproductive technologies and also conducted a project on common respiratory and musculoskeletal systems in performance horses. Megan served an internship with a Western Kentucky clinic that specializes in lameness, which solidiﬁed her interest in equine sports medicine. Upon graduation, she plans to join a private practice that serves Golden Gate Fields and has served externships with regulatory and private practice veterinarians at Golden Gate.

The ranch where the veteran horseman of more than 35 years got his start as an assistant—Valley Creek Farm in Valley Center, Calif.—is located on the same northeast San Diego County property as Arroyo Vista Farm, Henry Williamson’s 45-acre Thoroughbred breeding operation. In many ways, Jimenez grew up there. And as far as he is concerned, it’s a place he plans on never leaving. “I’m hoping to continue to do the same thing I’m doing,” said Jimenez, 54, reflecting on the future. “I would want to still manage a farm. Heaven forbid, if anything were to happen and this place was forced to close down, I don’t know what else I’d do.” At Arroyo Vista, Jimenez and his staff , including chief assistant Pablo Martinez, oversee 40 mares, 30 weanlings, and roughly an equal number of yearlings. The numbers fluctuate, Jimenez noted, as mares are sent out for breeding elsewhere... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nCassandra Bernas Receives Scholarship\n\nCassandra (Cassie) Bernas is the recipient of the California Thoroughbred Foundation’s 2023 Western University of Health Sciences scholarship.

At the time, Taboada — a passionate small-scale horse owner—was using the race to fight for recognition of the neurodevelopment disorder that had rocked his family after his son, Renzo, was diagnosed several years earlier. Since that big win, awareness of autism has risen significantly, Taboada says. Renzo, now 23, has made remarkable strides as well, and expects to graduate later this year with a degree in graphic design from California State University, East Bay. “Definitely people are more aware of autism in the last 10 years,” Taboada said. “When we were starting out with Renzo, it was impossible to get help or services. They said he was ‘just delayed’—that’s what they told us. I fought for help through three different school districts because I knew what we needed to do for my son.

It’s not surprising. The former trainer and longtime TV host has been an independent bloodstock agent for more than a decade. He spends much of his time scouting Thoroughbreds for his clients and attending sales throughout the country. At the Jan. 31 auction, the budget-conscious Hines led the way with seven purchases totaling $132,000. Discussing his change in career direction, he said he reluctantly stepped away from training in the fall of 2007, a year after getting married. “I was at a crossroads,” Hines explained. “I had been offered a job with Southern Equine Stable to manage their horses. I had about 30 horses at the time, training a few for Harris Farms and also for Paul Girdner, an owner who played a big part in my career. I had married Michelle in 2006, and we wanted... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nMary Forney Joins CTF Board\n\nMary Forney has spent her entire working career in the California Thoroughbred industry, and the California Thoroughbred Foundation is lucky to have someone with her wealth of experience join the board. In one sense, she is coming home because her first job was as secretary to Brian Sweeney, general manager of the California Thoroughbred Breeders Association. Once her mother took Mary and her sisters to the races at Santa Anita, Mary’s dream was to work in the industry. She remained at the CTBA for 14 years, and she and her husband, Jim, started their family of three children. During her time at the CTBA, Mary also wrote articles for this magazine. In 1990, fellow Foundation trustee Jane Goldstein convinced Forney to come work for Santa Anita as the program production coordinator. Forney spent 13 years at Santa Anita, later as the executive assistant to the president and simulcast coordinator. In dealing with out-of-state simulcast contracts, she traveled to tracks throughout the country. She joined the Thoroughbred Owners of California as... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nCarla Gaines\n\nALABAMA’S LOSS IS CALIFORNIA’S GAIN In some small way, Carla Gaines—one of the most successful and admired horse trainers in the state—owes it all to California Thoroughbred magazine. As she relates the story, the youthful Gaines was reading the periodical in an administrative office adjacent to a stallion barn in the bayou country of central Louisiana one icy winter morning when she made the decision that changed her life. The people she was working with at the time were pinhookers—in the business of buying yearlings and preparing them for resale as 2-year-olds. She enjoyed the people and working with the horses, but the weather was frightful. “It was so miserable,” she recalled. “It just rained and rained and it was freezing cold. The pictures (in the magazine) were so inviting; it seemed so sunny and I remember telling my friend, ‘I’m packing my stuff and I’m going to California.’ Anyway, that’s how I got my start.” Little did Gaines realize that her decision would lead to a training career totaling 31... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nJohn Sadler and the Amazing Flightline\n\nCalifornia Thoroughbred Foundation trustee John Sadler did a phenomenal job managing the career of Flightline, who was named the 2022 Horse of the Year in late January. Flightline captured the imagination of people inside and outside of the industry with his brilliant undefeated career. In addition to his Horse of the Year title, Flightline received an Eclipse Award as the champion older dirt male, and he earned a total of $4,514,800 during his career. Sadler trained Flightline for Hronis Racing, Siena Farm, breeder Summer Wind Equine, West Point Thoroughbreds, and Woodford Racing. A son of Tapit—Feathered, by Indian Charlie, Flightline showed promise from his early days of training. He won his six starts by a combined 71 lengths. And while his 81⁄4-length margin of victory in the Breeders’ Cup Classic (G1) is a record for that race, Flightline put on perhaps his most impressive perfor-mance in the Pacific Classic (G1) at Del Mar, where he demolished the field by 191⁄4 lengths. Sadler was winning his fourth Pacific Classic in the last... ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2023 Winter Mixed Sale Index to Sires of 2-Year-Olds\n\nCatalina Cruiser – FILLY 87 Classic Empire – COLT 104 Clubhouse Ride – FILLIES 56, 139 Coal Front – FILLY 14 Danzing Candy – COLTS 34, 51, FILLY 69 Enticed – COLT 105 Flintshire (GB) – COLT 40 Goldencents – FILLY 88 Graydar – COLT 114, FILLY 132 Grazen – COLT 120, FILLY 127 I’ll Have Another – FILLY 55 Kitten’s Joy – COLT 37 Merit Man – FILLY 1 Northern Causeway – COLTS 126, 133, FILLIES 50, 82 Om – FILLY 141 Omaha Beach – FILLY 107 Outwork – COLT 8 Palace Malice – FILLY 30 Rumpus Cat – COLTS 72, 142 Sir Prancealot (IRE) – COLTS 16, 18, 49, 71, 102, 112, FILLY – 100 Stanford – COLT 47 Stay Thirsty – COLTS 43, 75, FILLY 15 Texas Ryano – FILLIES 60, 85, 145 Uncle Mo – COLT 134 Vronsky – FILLIES 22, 35, 53 ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2023 Winter Mixed Sales Index to Sires if Yearlings\n\nCurlin to Mischief – FILLY 33 Danzing Candy – COLTS 86, 94 Daredevil – FILLY 140 Desert Code – FILLY 99 Gormley – FILLY 4 Liam’s Map – COLT 38 Om – COLTS 64 , 76 Richard’s Kid COLT – 2 Sir Prancealot (IRE) – FILLIES 77, 106, 138 Stanford – COLT 67 Stay Thirsty – COLT 45 FILLIES – 28, 148 Texas Ryano – FILLIES 32, 84 Twirling Candy – COLT 128 Vronsky – COLTS 24, 96, FILLY – 122 Yorkton – COLT 98 ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2023 Winter Mixed Sale Index to Sires of Broodmares\n\nArcharcharch: 12 Artie Schiller: 110 Awesome Gambler: 91 Bated Breath: 123 Bedford Falls: 31 Bertrando: 97 Bodemeister: 62 Denis of Cork: 135 Dynaformer: 58 Even the Score: 147 Excellent Art (GB): 25 Flatter: 11 Footstepsinthesand: 137 Forestry: 3 Giant’s Causeway: 101 Good Journey: 17 Gotham City: 119 Into Mischief: 78 Kafwain: 83 Lemon Drop Kid: 46, 146 Lone Star Sky: 70 Lonhro (AUS): 131, 144 Marino Marini: 146 Midnight Lute: 5 Mineshaft: 111 Ministers Wild Cat: 36 Misremembered: 10 Orb: 116 Oxbow: 29 Pleasantly Perfect: 103, 136 Recap: 48 Sierra Sunset: 61 Sky Mesa: 54, 92, 130 Smiling Tiger: 59, 63 Time to Get Even: 121 Tiznow: 68 Unbridled’s Song: 81, 129 Unusual Heat: 73 Van Nistelrooy: 93 Vronsky: 20 Will Take Charge: 44 Yes It’s True: 65 ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2023 Index to Photographs and Videos\n\nCheckmate Thoroughbreds LLC 4 Chestnut Filly by Gormley out of Metry Kitten (See Photo) 25 Poster Girl (GB) by Excellent Art (GB) out of Accede (GB) (See Photo) 49 Bay Colt by Sir Prancealot (IRE) out of Silky Slew (See Video) 69 Chestnut Filly by Danzing Candy out of Toro Bonito (See Video) (See Photo) 100 Bay Filly by Sir Prancealot (IRE) out of Candy Forest (See Video) 107 Miss Omaha by Omaha Beach out of Cousin Claire (See Video) 123 Go Greta (GB) by Bated Breath (GB) out of Out of The Dark (IRE) (See Photo) 136 Jadira by Pleasantly Perfect out of I’m Breathtaking (See Photo) 134 Bay Colt by Uncle Mo out of I’ll Show Me (See Video) 153 Acclaim The Queen by Acclamation out of Lutess (See Photo) 154 D’s Lovely Sophia by Big Bad Leroybrown out of Craftyasafox (See Photo) Checkmate Thoroughbreds LLC (Adrian Gonzalez), Agent 18 Dark Bay or Brown Colt by Sir Prancealot (IRE) out of Nonna Gianna (IRE) (See Video) (See Photo) 30 Hurricane Hottie by Palace Malice out of Re Entry (See Video)... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nAndy Smolich\n\nOWNER GETS FIRST STAKES WINNER AT AGE 90 Andy Smolich knows that it’s never too late to dream. The 90-year-old semi-retired Sacramento attorney, a small-scale breeder and owner of Thoroughbreds since 1987, recently celebrated his milestone birthday as well as his first stakes victory when Chancery Way captured the Bear Fan Stakes at Golden Gate Fields. “Hope springs eternal,” chuckled Smolich, who owns the filly in partnership with his son, Robert. Chancery Way, a California-bred 2019 daughter of popular California sire Mr. Big, is four-for-four to start her career for trainer Jamey Thomas, with earnings of $110,520. The bay filly, who is out of the stakes-placed War Chant mare This Means War, has yet to be headed in any of her races. With Kevin Radke aboard, Chancery Way won the Dec. 10 Bear Fan impressively by 11⁄4 lengths off a 41⁄2-month layoff . She set swift fractions in the six-furlong test and held off the even-money favorite Big Summer in the final furlong in a time of 1:09.89. “We’re following the... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nLarisa Wick Holderied Joins CTF Board\n\nLarisa Wick Holderied has fond memories of a childhood filled with fun visits to Santa Anita, courtesy of her great-grandfather, Ray Bell Sr., who was a champion rodeo rider before becoming a successful race horse owner and bloodstock dealer. Unlike several of Bell’s other descendants who pursued racing professions, she went in a different direction, earning a B.A. degree from Pennsylvania State University and a law degree from Albany Law School in New York. She was admitted to the bar in New York State in 2005. Coming full circle to the Thoroughbred world, Mrs. Holderied has joined the California Thoroughbred Foundation board of trustees and brings valuable experience working with non-profit organizations.

So it wasn’t surprising that when her fi lly Fun to Dream won the Betty Grable Stakes at Del Mar recently and a television reporter approached her for a post-race interview, she politely demurred. Fortunately for Pageler, the big gray 3-year-old California-bred daughter of champion Arrogate is trained by Hall of Fame conditioner Bob Baffert, no stranger to post-race interviews. Baffert also bred Fun to Dream in partnership with Pageler, and Baffert’s wife, Jill, is the co-owner. “I don’t like to be in the spotlight—I prefer being in the background,” Pageler said. “I don’t like doing interviews. Britney (Eurton) wanted to interview me (for FanDuel TV), and I told her no, please interview Bob instead. I’m always afraid I’ll say something stupid.” Baffert took over from there. But if Fun to Dream—now a two-time stakes winner with four victories from five lifetime starts and earnings of nearly $250,000—continues her present trajectory, the 67-year-old Pageler will likely have to come... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nAs 2022 Comes to a Close. . .\n\nOn behalf of the California Thoroughbred Foundation, I want to thank you for your interest and commitment to the health and welfare of the Thoroughbred.

After the eastern Washington breeder sold a pair of eye-catching California-bred yearling fillies for $200,000 apiece at the Fasig-Tipton California fall yearlings and horses of racing sale Sept. 27 at Pomona, the 64-year-old horseman was back at his ranch paddock breaking the next group of yearlings. “You can’t get complacent,” Hull said. “You gotta stay hungry.” He and his brother Guy do it all at their 15-acre spread, known as Critter Creek Farm. About 30 miles northwest of Spokane, it’s in a fairly remote location. While mucking stalls on a recent afternoon, Hull began to reflect on what happened on sale day. The fillies, named Truly Magical and Someone Like You, were both purchased by Samantha Siegel’s Jay Em Ess Stable, and their price tied for the second highest of the sale. “I’m kind of emotional about it, but I was just so proud of them,” said Hull, his voice cracking a bit as he related... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nGoldstein Honored at Inaugural Women’s Summit\n\nJane Goldstein, a longtime California Thoroughbred Foundation trustee, the retired director of publicity at Santa Anita, and the first woman to head a track publicity department in this country, received a standing ovation when honored during the luncheon of the inaugural Horse Racing Women’s Summit at Santa Anita Sept. 29. Fellow Foundation trustee Amy Zimmerman, one of the many Goldstein has mentored throughout her career, presented the award. The summit, designed to provide women in racing with ways to “engage, innovate, and invest,” offered a day of panels comprising fe-male executives throughout the racing industry. Summit organizers recognized Goldstein as “a groundbreaking leader and inspirational example to women in racing.” Zimmerman noted the barriers Goldstein had to face during her career simply because she was a woman, from the Daily Racing Form not hiring women at the time to press boxes being closed to women. Once in charge of publicity at Santa Anita, Goldstein “expected excellence from those who worked for her because she demanded it of herself because of... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nCTBA 2023 Winter Mixed Sale\n\nCLICK BELOW TO SEE THE SALES RESULT 2023 Winter Sales Result View the catalog here (scroll down for more options): 2023 Sale Date: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, at 12:00 NOON Fairplex – Pomona, CA Contact: Loretta Veiga – (800) 573-2822 Ext 227 or email: loretta@ctba.com You can fill online form here: Authorized agent form Credit request form Alternately, you can download the entire CTBA Winter Mixed Sale Form then send it with your payment by mail to: California Thoroughbred Breeders Association 201 Colorado Place Arcadia, CA 91007 CLICK BELOW TO SEE THE SALES RESULT 2023 Winter Sales Result OUTS: 5, 7, 10, 20, 21, 26, 36, 37, 44, 46, 55, 57, 59, 62, 65, 72, 78, 81, 83, 89, 93, 95, 97, 115, 118, 128, 132, 143, 146 Download the catalog in xls format HERE Index to Consignors Index to Sires Index to Dams Index to Covering Sires Index to Sires if Yearlings Index to Sires of 2-Year-Olds Index to Sires of Broodmares Index to Supplemental Entries Index to Photographs and... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nJaime Renella\n\nRENELLA’S HOMEBRED CHISMOSA GIVES ‘EM SOMETHIN’ TO TALK ABOUT You don’t have to spend much time talking to Jaime (Jim) Renella without realizing he’s about as close to the epitome of the American Dream as anyone can get. He came to Southern California with his family from Ecuador at the age of 4. Times were difficult, but he adapted to his new country. After leaving college—“I think I attended just about every JC in the area,” he joked—Renella wanted to make his way in the world. He worked hard learning the manufacturing business for several years. When the opportunity arose, he started his own company, Performance Tube Bending Inc., specializing in creating customized intake/exhaust systems for automobiles, in 2004 in Irwindale. The business proved successful and allowed him to indulge, at least a little bit, in his passion for horse racing. The first horse Renella claimed in 2010 also became the only mare he has bred. That mare, the aptly named You Can Dream, has produced five winners for him, including his latest, the 2-year-old filly... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nBurke Library on the Move\n\nAs the contents of the Carleton F.

Katie Richardson, the department chair of the Cal Poly library and department head of special collections and archives, is processing the books as they are moved to the university.

After years of attending the races as a fan, Jett, along with wife Ann, had purchased his first California-bred Thoroughbred. There were high hopes for Red Ralph, a chestnut gelding by M. Double M.—Jakscent, by Jaklin Klugman. “The fellow that owned him couldn’t have him anymore, so I bought the horse for $5,000,” Larry said. “Within two days of working him in the round pen, he came up lame. The former owner said that if we paid for the vet, they would give us our money back.” He added wryly, “Keep in mind, this was the future Kentucky Derby winner.” It turned out that Red Ralph had osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), and surgery to clean out the joint didn’t help when he bucked shins not once, but twice. Still, the Jetts remained optimistic. “His first race came as a 4-year-old at Del Mar,” Larry said. “I had... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nGates Patton Named Farrier Director of the California Horse Center\n\nAda Gates Patton, president of the California Thoroughbred Foundation, has been named farrier director of the California Horse Center Flag Is Up Farms in Solvang.

Acclamation’s career is worthy of the silver screen, as the son of Unusual Heat—Winning in Style, by Silveyville, earned $1,958,048 with 11 wins, two seconds, and six thirds in 30 starts. “He won the Eddie Read (G1T) twice, and the Charles Whittingham (G1T) three times,” said Rand. “But that Pacific Classic—that was the ride that did it.” Pitted against graded stakes stars Twirling Candy and Game On Dude, Acclamation went to the lead under Patrick Valenzuela and kept going. His achievements in 2011 earned him the title as the Eclipse Award national champion older male. Long before that fateful day at Del Mar, Rand’s family was already in the horse business. It traces back... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nAllison Salinger a Worthy Scholarship Recipient\n\nEarly every year, part of the California Thoroughbred Foundation’s mission to support veterinary students focused on the Thoroughbred manifests itself in the choice of a third-year student at Western University of Health Sciences in Pomo-na. We decided to look in on the 2017 Foundation choice, Allison Salinger, and see what she has been doing. Originally from Pennsylvania, Allison graduated from Virginia Tech University with a bachelor of science degree in biology focused on research. Before she graduated from Western University in 2018, Allison was one of 33 veterinary students nationwide to receive financial support from the Winner’s Circle Scholarship Program, sponsored by the American Association of Equine Practi-tioners’ Foundation, Platinum Performance, and the Race For Education. Allison started at Mississippi State in July 2019 and is now a third-year large animal surgery resident at the university. Her work includes a study that investigated how a novel, headless screw could repair carpal bone fractures in racehorses. The study demonstrated that this screw compares favorably to others used and that its design... ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2022 Index to Photographs and Videos\n\nWoodbridge Farm, Agent 49 Bay Filly by Clubhouse Ride out of Pop Quality (see photo)(see video) 95 Arch Stanton by Ministers Wild Cat out of Twisted Ginger (see photo) 123 Gray or Roan Filly by Clubhouse Ride out of Beale Street Belle (see photo)(see video) Milky Way Farm 6 Lovely Bride by Dosificado (CHI) out of Forever Wife (see photo) 7 Forever Lovely by Smart Bid out of Forever Wife (see photo) 15 Passionate Kisses by Passion for Gold out of Itsakiss (see photo) 21 Tap a Cold One by Rumpus Cat out of Keg Stand (see photo) 26 Dark Bay or Brown Colt by Winning Cause out of Leaps ‘n Bounds (see photo) 37 Dark Bay or Brown Colt by Passion for Gold out of Mini Skirt (see photo) 38 Dark Bay or Brown Colt by Mr. Big out of Miss Graziella (see photo) 43 Dark Bay or Brown Filly by Winning Cause out of Native Code (see photo) 52 Rumpusinthesky by Rumpus Cat out of Pulpitinthesky (see photo)... ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2022 Index to Supplemental Entries\n\nEasterbrook Livestock Management, Agent 146 Marydon’tyouknow by Reagan Republican out of Queen’s Balladier 147 Miss Mandaue by Hawk’s Eyes out of Radiant Lov 148 Reagan’s Lov by Reagan Republican out of Radiant Lov 150 Hold The Ransom by Ransom the Moon out of Market Appeal Harris Farms, Agent 149 Big Wild West by Mr. Big out of Westline (Past Performance) Lovacres Ranch LLC, Agent 151 Goveness Lizzy by Govenor Charlie out of Unbriddled Meeting ...\n\nRead More →\n\nLarry Odbert\n\nFRIENDLY ADVICE LEADS TO RACING SUCCESS When it came to business, lifelong Sacramento resident Larry Odbert had a knack for making the right choices—at least often enough to be highly successful. But more than 10 years after getting into horse ownership, including a few stabs at breeding a couple of the mares he had acquired, the 69-year-old Odbert admits he was stymied. Associated with or in charge of more than 20 businesses during a career of 40-plus years, Odbert wondered whether he was doing the right thing being in the horse trade. But then along came “Joe.” Freeport Joe, that is. The 5-year-old California-bred gelded son of the deceased top turf sire English Channel has been on a tear at Golden Gate Fields. He has won six of 11 starts dating back to August 2021, with two seconds and a third. A tyro over Golden Gate’s all-weather Tapeta main track, the late-running Freeport Joe has won two of the biggest races in Northern California in recent months. He grabbed the Berkeley... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nKatarina Hilton Receives Scholarship\n\nKatarina (Kat) Hilton is this year’s recipient of the California Thoroughbred Foundation’s 2022 Western University of Health Sciences scholarship. The Foundation awards scholarships to students at Western University as well as to students at the University of California, Davis. The curriculum vitae, personal essays, and in-person verbal interviews with these students leave our trustees inspired, hopeful, and filled with admiration for these extraordinary young people. They are brilliant, beyond hard-working, and willingly face a challenging life of service to horses. From an early age, Kat cared for her family’s Thoroughbred horses, became a leader in Pony Club, and later became an event rider who assisted other riders and horses in the recovery veterinarian box. These early experiences made her path very clear: to provide proper medical care as an equine veterinarian. She has shadowed solo and multiple equine practices focused on lameness evaluations, pre-purchase examinations, diagnostic imaging, and movement for a variety of breeds, specifically off-the-track Thoroughbreds. As a veterinary student, Kat added to her intensive studies with leadership roles... ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2022 Northern California Sale Index to Dams\n\nAfleet Diablo: 111 All Luv Me: 113 Allegation: 112 Almost Reality: 114 Amorous Angie: 115 April Fooler: 116 Astuzia: 117 Atlantic Tap: 118 Awe Woman: 120 Awesome Annie: 119 Ballerina Angel: 121 Battleground State: 122 Be My Baby: 124 Beale Street Belle: 123 Big Break: 125 Blue Sky Holiday: 126 Botoola: 127 California Moon: 128 Call Betsy: 129 Capaz: 130 Chautauqua Creek: 131 Church Avenue: 132 Comical Allee: 133 Cotton’s Point: 134 Cricket Wicket: 135 Dance Hall Days: 136 Deyonce: 137 Diamondsandcaviar: 138 Distorted Beauty: 139 Dream’s (CHI): 140 Durant: 141 Easter Chorus (GB): 142 Easter Fever: 143 Easy Money: 144 Eden Mirelle: 145 Fantastic Cousin: 1 Fast Breaking News: 2 Fiftyeight Special: 3 Fight Again: 4 Floatthrutheair: 5 Forever Wife: 6 7 Foxy Jade: 8 Frankly J’ray: 9 Greatest Escape: 10 Harbor Song: 11 Hip Hip: 12 Holograeme: 13 Into Rissa: 14 Itsakiss: 15 It’sallyoursbaby: 16 Janice Sue: 17 Jazz On The Beach (GB): 18 Jolly Days: 19 Juwwi: 20 Keg Stand: 21 Khalaya: 22 Kiss the Storm: 23... ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2022 Northern California Sale Index to Sires\n\nAccelerate: Colt, 137 Air Force Blue: Colt, 62 Colt, 139 Always Dreaming: Colt, 53 Colt, 67 Box Score: Colt, 133 Cat Burglar: Colt, 4 Colt, 17 Colt, 73 Colt, 85 Colt, 96 Colt, 98 Colt, 113 Colt, 140 Filly, 13 Filly, 28 Filly, 44 Filly, 75 Filly, 93 Filly, 125 Filly, 130 Filly, 136 Circumference (IRE): Filly, 92 Clubhouse Ride: Colt, 45 Filly, 49 Filly, 123 Conquest Farenheit: Colt, 2 Filly, 129 Curlin to Mischief: Colt, 27 Dads Caps: Colt, 1 Colt, 20 Colt, 55 Colt, 66 Colt, 72 Colt, 97 Filly, 5 Filly, 12 Filly, 25 Filly, 30 Filly, 106 Danzing Candy: Colt, 32 Colt, 33 Colt, 46 Colt, 59 Colt, 69 Colt, 101 Colt, 109 Colt, 134 Filly, 35 Filly, 60 Filly, 128 Dosificado (CHI): Filly, 6 Filly, 57 Filly, 131 Exaggerator: Colt, 138 Gig Harbor: Colt, 132 Goldencents: Colt, 31 Govenor Charlie: Colt, 61 Filly, 19 Graydar: Filly, 107 Grazen: Colt, 22 Heaven’s Glory (JPN): Filly, 81 Jersey Town: Colt, 78 Karakontie (JPN): Filly, 83 Mastery: Colt,... ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2022 Northern California Sale Index to Consignors\n\nBarton Thoroughbreds, Agent 1 Bay Colt by Dads Caps out of Fantastic Cousin 4 Bay Colt by Cat Burglar out of Fight Again 5 Gray or Roan Filly by Dads Caps out of Floatthrutheair 12 Bay Filly by Dads Caps out of Hip Hip 13 Chestnut Filly by Cat Burglar out of Holograeme 17 Chestnut Colt by Cat Burglar out of Janice Sue 20 Bay Colt by Dads Caps out of Juwwi 25 Bay Filly by Dads Caps out of La Strada 28 Chestnut Filly by Cat Burglar out of Line Drive 30 Bay Filly by Dads Caps out of Mahee Moon 44 Chestnut Filly by Cat Burglar out of Norma 55 Bay Colt by Dads Caps out of Quick Wampum 62 Bay Colt by Air Force Blue out of Scarlet Begonias 66 Chestnut Colt by Dads Caps out of She’s Striking 67 Dark Bay or Brown Colt by Always Dreaming out of Silent Mistake 72 Bay Colt by Dads Caps out of Some Temper 73 Dark Bay or... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nTom Beckerle\n\nCalifornia Thoroughbred owner learns value of friendships and racing partnerships Before he turned 16, Tom Beckerle was already working on the outskirts of the racing industry. He began by selling tip sheets at Los Alamitos near where he grew up and fell in love with the racehorses, as so many do. “That’s how I got started,” Beckerle recalled. “As I got older, I got involved with a syndicate.” One syndicate of horse owners turned into many, and Beckerle was recently rewarded for his investment via Tom’s Regret. That California-bred 2-year-old filly triumphed in the $179,785 Kentucky Juvenile Stakes at Churchill Downs in Kentucky May 5. Long before Tom’s Regret, Beckerle was trying his hand in the game. The first horse that Beckerle bought into was Set Play, a Florida-bred filly trained by Peter Miller. Set Play broke her maiden first out, won the 2007 Del Mar Debutante Stakes (G1) three months later and ultimately ran 11th in the 2007 Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies at odds of 41-1. “I got to... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nUC Davis Scholarships\n\nIn its continuing mission to advance education in equine health, the California Thoroughbred Foundation awarded scholarships to Amber McElhinney and Izabella Pendergast. The two well-qualified candidates study at the University of California at Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Amber plans to pursue a career in equine surgery and lameness. She has a BS in equine science from the University of New Hampshire and studied equine cardiology at the University of Edinburgh Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies for her undergraduate senior honors thesis. Amber is a disaster service worker in Yolo County and treasurer for the Global Veterinary Alliance. She has completed externships with several equine clinics and gathered data for a study on PET scans of injured racehorses with Dr. Sue Stover. Amber wants to work with sport horses and treat lameness. She is especially interested in the prevention of orthopedic diseases, including concussive breakdown in racehorses. Izabella has loved horses from an early age, when her mother helped her find a stable where she could work with the horses... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nMartha Miller\n\nRACING WITH A CTBA EDUCATION At the age of 5, Martha Miller was already ducking under the turnstile to get into the racetrack for free. She knew how to read the Daily Racing Form before tackling first-grade level books and still has old scrapbooks of the jockeys and horses she loved as a child. Racing wormed its way into Miller’s heart early on and never let go. “My father raised me on the track; I grew up with it,” she said. “I swore that if I ever had the money, I would have a racehorse.” With time came money, and with money came an investment into partnerships and the racing industry in general. From 1990 on, Miller was entrenched in racing, starting with California-bred Reason to Be, a mare by Aloma’s Ruler. “I gradually became very much hands on,” Miller said. “I did a lot of reading and research and noting what was happening. I got acquainted with Leigh Ann Howard, which was one of the best things that ever... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nFoundation Donating Burke Equine Library to Cal Poly Pomona\n\nThe California Thoroughbred Foundation is donating the contents of the Carleton F. Burke Library— one of the most extensive collections of equine literature found anywhere—to California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. “This is such a rare and specialized collection that it is a great match with an academic library,” said Foundation President Ada Gates Patton. “Officials from Cal Poly Pomona approached us about acquiring the library, with proposed expert management of books and increased public access. “The Foundation does not have resources like those at Cal Poly. In addition, with more and more material available on the Internet, in-person use of the library decreased in recent years, followed by a two-year closure because of the pandemic. So after studying the proposal carefully, our board voted for the donation. This will benefit anyone interested in publications about horses, whether for serious study or just pleasure reading.” The university intends to digitize research books for worldwide access, exposing the Burke Library to a far wider audience than the Foundation could offer. “We have... ...\n\nRead More →\n\n2022 Northern California Sale\n\n2022 Sale Date NEW DATE: WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 17, at noon Alameda County Fairgrounds, Pleasanton, CA Online Bidding is AVAILABLE You can download the forms under Forms/Registration menu or fill online forms here: Entry Form / Consignor’s Contract Agent Authorization Form Credit Application Form CREDIT REQUEST.

The California-bred son of Oats and Corn was Porter’s first ever claim back in 1987 at Turf Paradise. He couldn’t win in Arizona and ultimately ended up in Mexico at Agua Caliente, finally breaking his maiden in start number 15. The exploits of Flying Buccaneer were indicative of Porter’s early success with Thoroughbreds. Porter, who had also purchased a ranch around the same time, had to wait a long time for his first star. But Porter is no quitter. A hard worker, he owned his first gas station in Palos Verdes at the age of 25, making him the youngest station owner in Southern California. He has owned two auto repair shops for the last 35 years: Glenn’s Auto Repair in Tarzana and European Car Care in Corona. Both have glowing Yelp reviews. “I’m not an absentee owner—I work just as hard as any of the guys that work for me,” Porter said. “And if you keep doing well... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nJockeying Careers\n\nFerrin Peterson, the 2018 recipient of a California Thoroughbred Foundation scholarship when she was a third-year veterinary student at the University of California, Davis, has continued her unique dual careers as a veterinarian and jockey. She has moved to Kentucky and hired former star rider Julio Espinoza as her jockey agent. Dark days in the racing calendar provide time for her to engage in veterinary work. As reported on this page two years ago, Peterson was the second-leading rider at Monmouth Park in 2020, when Hall of Fame former jockey Julie Krone served as her agent and mentor. Their subsequent foray into New York racing was impeded because pandemic restrictions prevented them from going into the stable area and making crucial trainer contacts. Next, Peterson went to Maryland, where bad weather and an equine herpes outbreak curtailed racing, severely limiting her opportunities. While in Maryland, Peterson worked with trainer Graham Motion at his Fair Hill training center, and she finished second on one of his horses in her first ride... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nLucy Lawrence\n\nVery few people get to win a stakes race with their very first homebred, but Lucy Lawrence was that kind of lucky. When California-bred Aligato won the $196,000 Unusual Heat Turf Classic Presented by City National Bank at Santa Anita Jan. 15, he not only became Lawrence’s first homebred stakes winner, but he also overcame several obstacles that made him an unlikely victor. After numerous setbacks, the California-bred son of Kitten’s Joy – Pretty Hard, by Rock Hard Ten, didn’t debut until midway through his 4-year-old season and was making his stakes debut in the Turf Classic. He was stretching from six furlongs to 11⁄8 miles and was facing a field of seasoned runners, including 2020 California Champion Big Fish, multiple graded stakes placed Camino Del Paraiso, and stakes winner Indian Peak. Unlikely though it was, Aligato won anyway, swooping under Flavien Prat to give Lawrence and Bob Liewald’s Double L Racing its first stakes winner. Lawrence and Liewald did not have to wait very long. “We both grew up... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nHorseshoe Board on Display\n\nWallace S. Rohrer, a member of the International Union of Journeyman Horse-shoers, created 14 handmade shoes specifically crafted for the Thoroughbred racehorse. The California Thoroughbred Foundation is honored to have this extraordinary example of his work in the form of a unique horseshoe board on display at the California Thoroughbred Breeders Association. It demonstrates Rohrer’s abilities as well as pays tribute to the IUJH, which dates back to 1874. Rohrer, the son of a blacksmith, shod horses for some of the finest California trainers from the 1950s-70s. He later became the paddock horse-shoer at receiving barns of California racetracks, requiring him to check every horse for every race to confirm the runner was properly shod for that surface. He served on judging panels for the IUJH journeyman exam, a requirement for licensing as a farrier at California Thoroughbred racetracks. The rigorous test took five hours in the forge and one hour under a horse. The candidate had to make four different shoes (announced at the start of the test), beginning... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nCTBA 2022 Winter Mixed Sale\n\n2022 Sale Date: Tuesday, February 1, 2022, at 12:00 NOON Fairplex – Pomona, CA Sales Result Outs: 2, 12, 16, 19, 27, 61, 62, 84, 90, 91, 95, 103, 106, 130, 132, 147.

Perhaps the best of them was California-bred Easy Grader, a four-time winner on the Southern California circuit who earned $175,733. Enter Professors’ Pride, who runs for the final remaining member of Academic Farms: Larry Samovar. The unbeaten Cal-bred daughter of Bayern—Last Resort, by Twirling Candy, recently won the $101,500 Soviet Problem Stakes at Los Alamitos, sparking joy in the hearts of 86-year-old Larry and his 79-year-old wife, Carolyn. Long before Professors’ Pride burst onto the scene, three studious men started Academic Farms with a common goal. “One was a pediatrician, one was a professor of journalism, and I was a professor in intercultural communication,” Larry said. “We each put in $1,000 and bought a horse from John and Betty Mabee at Golden Eagle Farm. We didn’t have any luck.” Horses got hurt; horses ran unsuccessfully. “We went through a lot of different horses,” Samovar said. “We claimed,... ...\n\nRead More →\n\nContinuing Education for Trainers\n\nContinuing Education for Trainers The California Thoroughbred Foundation, which is devoted to fostering education in an effort to improve the health of Thoroughbred racehorses, applauds the California Horse Racing Board’s continuing education series for trainers. It is part of a new California regulation that requires trainers and assistant trainers to complete a minimum of 12 hours of approved continuing education coursework every 36 months as a condition for licensing. The CHRB has created webinars on such topics as racehorse neurological conditions, understanding shoulder fractures, and compounded medications as part of this continuing education. Top veterinarians Dr. Sue Stover, Dr. Dionne Benson, and Dr. Barrie Grant are among the experts that have contributed to these webinars. The CHRB and the California Thoroughbred Trainers have been instrumental in furthering this continuing education.
