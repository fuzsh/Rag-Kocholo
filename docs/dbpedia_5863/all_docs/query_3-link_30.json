        "text": "QUEEN’S PLATE 160 TOPS 13-RACE, STAKES LADEN SATURDAY AT WOODBINE\n\n1 1/4 miles. Tapeta. Canadian-bred 3-year-olds. $1,00,000. Winner goes on one of the most famous ledgers of major sports winners in Canada.\n\nAVIE’S FLATTER will be favoured for the 160th Queen’s Plate (post time Saturday about 5;36 p.m.) and there was a bit of a buzz when Ivan Dalos’ colt drew selection order 14 of 14 before the post position selection process on Thursday.\n\nThe colt was left with post 14 which, with the very long run to the first turn, should allow US import rider Javier Castellano to situate his colt in a stalking position or in mid-pack.\n\nAvie’s Flatter’s trainer, JOSIE CARROLL, is set to be inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in August and she has won 2 Quen’s Plate. She has also come close with horses owned by Dalos and you can be sure she dearly wants him to get his first Plate win.\n\nThe colt has raced twice this year, both on grass and both in Kentucky, and he passed up the Plate Trial to come in fresh.\n\nThe probable second favourite will be SKYWIRE (he’s actually listed as third choice in the morning line) the selection of many published handicappers and a colt from the powerful Gary Barber and Mark Casse team (2 Plate wins). Skywire, co-owned by Toronto’s Lou Tucci, is one of 4 horses in the race bred by the late Bill Graham of Caledon east.\n\nCalifornia invader ONE BAD BOY, foaled at Ron Clarkson’s farm in Ontario. ONE BAD BOY is listed as second favourite in the morning line odds and this speedy colt will race with blinkers off and have Kentucky Derby winning rider Flavien Prat on board.\n\nDESERT RIDE, the lone filly, will start from the rail, selected by owner Rick Balaz of Sam-Son Farms. “That’s where Steve wants to be” said Balaz in reference to jockey Steve Bahen who rode the filly to the Woodbine Oaks victory three weeks ago. Fillies have won the last 2 Plate and tend to have a good record in the race.\n\nThe Oaks, held on the same day as the Plate Trial, won by Pay for Peace, went in much faster time than the Trial.\n\nAfter those top 4, a win by any other horse in the 14 horse field would be considered a considerable upset. There are 3 horses listed at 50 to 1 and three at 30 to 1.\n\nThe POST POSITION DRAW on Thursday allowed attendees to meet some of the participants and MARK and TINA CASSE were there. Casse, fresh off sending out the winners of the Preakness (war of Will) and Belmont (Sir Winston) praised Woodbine, his ‘home’ track and said he thinks “Skywire will be tough to beat”: and Federal Law “will not be on the lead”.\n\nLongshots or no, there are some excited local owners who do not have big stables in the Plate.\n\nThe Di Scola Boys, Joe, Mark and John have HE’S A MACHO MAN in the field, a livery chestnut colt who trainer Josie Carroll calls her ‘sleeper’.\n\n“We are really pumped,’ said Joe DiScola. “This is a fantastic sport to be a part of it and we are blessed to be around all these great horsepeople.”\n\nJIM LAWSON, president/CEO of Woodbine Entertainment, spoke of the opening of the inner turf course on Friday (1 race Friday, 2 on Saturday) and the autumn=launch of DARK HORSE, a new horse racing ‘app’ that is developed for new racing fans.\n\nThe best quote from the Queen’s Plate draw?\n\nThat goes to jockey Steve Bahen (rider of Desert Ride) whose wife Rachel Halden trains Pay for Peace.\n\n“I’m sleeping with the enemy.”\n\nPost Horse Trainer Jockey M/L Odds\n\n1 Desert Ride (filly) Neil Howard Steven Bahen 8-1\n\n2 Moon Swings Michael De Paulo Jesse Campbell 30-1\n\n3 Krachenwagen Angus Buntain Jeffrey Alderson 50-1\n\n4 Pay for Peace Rachel Halden Rafael Hernandez 15-1\n\n5 One Bad Boy Richard Baltas Flavien Prat 7-2\n\n6 Lucas n’ Lori Kevin Attard Kazushi Kimura 50-1\n\n7 Federal Law Mark Casse Jamie Spencer 15-1\n\n8 He’s a Macho Man Josie Carroll Patrick Husbands 15-1\n\n9 Suitedconnected Robert Earl Barnett Gary Boulanger 50-1\n\n10 Skywire Mark Casse Eurico Rosa Da Silva 4-1\n\n11 Tone Broke Steve Asmussen Luis Contreras 6-1\n\n12 Jammin Still Kevin Attard Alan Garcia 30-1\n\n13 Rising Star Michael De Paulo Justin Stein 30-1\n\n14 Avie’s Flatter Josie Carroll Javier Castellano 5-2\n\nBRISNET FREE PPS: http://www.brisnet.com/php/bw_pdf_viewer.php?track=WO&race=10&param1=4740&param2=2291&param3=1756530\n\nMORE PLATE STUFF FROM THOROUGHBLOG THIS WEEK:\n\n*Historical Beyer Speed Figures and recent form of starters – https://canadianthoroughbred.com/thoroughblog/plate-week/\n\n*Where did the 2019 Plate starters come from?\n\nAVIE’S FLATTER – Owner and breeder Ivan Dalos from Toronto won the Sovereign Award for Outstanding Breeder at the 2018 Sovereign Awards, his first.
