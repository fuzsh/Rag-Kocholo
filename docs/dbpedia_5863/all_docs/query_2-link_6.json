        "text": "When Sunny's Halo won the 109th Kentucky Derby Saturday, his camp was rewarded for its faith in the colt, and at higher odds than the 5-2 mutuel payoff.\n\nThe trainer, David Cross, secured a bright future as a highly respected trainer after giving up the rest of his stable to train Sunny's Halo for the Derby. In addition, Cross and his wife, Patty, made a small killing in Las Vegas by betting on their colt at 100 to 1 in the winter book last January.\n\nThe biggest winner of all, however, was David J. (Pug) Foster, the 67-year-old Toronto stockbroker who bred and solely owns the colt - at least for now. Cross confirmed this morning that Foster would sell a 49 percent interest in Sunny's Halo this week and that the price would be in the range of $4 million to $6 million.\n\nFoster is selling because Sunny's Halo is too valuable for him to keep alone. Before he won the Derby, the colt was insured for $2.7 million, a value that will now triple or quadruple. The premiums, about 10 percent of the value per year, are too high for Foster. The owner turned down offers of $400,000 for half-interest in the colt last summer and $3 million earlier this week. As with Cross, his patience has paid off.\n\nThe sale, expected to go to the highest bidder among a number of major commercial breeders, may end a controversy Cross now wishes he had never started. A few days before the Derby, Cross outlined a scenario in which Sunny's Halo might become the first Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner ever to pass up a chance at the Triple Crown by skipping the Belmont Stakes. Prefers Queens Plate to Belmont\n\nCross thinks that a mile and a half under 126 pounds is too demanding of a 3-year-old in June. Foster also has a nationalistic stake in running the colt in another race instead: the Queen's Plate, Canada's equivalent of the Derby, which is run two weeks after the Belmont.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
