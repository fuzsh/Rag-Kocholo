        "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the 2024 Kentucky Derby, the 150th anniversary.\n\nSaturday’s running of the Kentucky Derby is the sesquicentennial anniversary of the longest continuously held sporting event in America. Although Churchill Downs has undergone many renovations and changes throughout the years — including a $200 million renovation to the paddock this year — its twin spires still overlook the iconic track.\n\nIt’s a bucket list item for any horse racing fan to attend the Kentucky Derby and take in a day of races at Churchill Downs. More than 165,000 people should be there on Saturday to celebrate the 150th Run for the Roses.\n\nWhen the horses walk from the paddock to the track on Saturday evening, “My Old Kentucky Home,” a song written in 1852 by Stephen Foster, will play across Churchill Downs. Fans in their Sunday best, crowned with over-the-top hats and with mint juleps in hand, will celebrate long-standing traditions as the clock gets closer to Saturday’s 6:57 p.m. ET post time for the 150th Kentucky Derby.\n\nWhether you’re new to the Kentucky Derby or a longtime fan, let us be your virtual tour guide around the storied track at Churchill Downs.\n\nThe Run for the Roses\n\nThe “Run for the Roses,” as the Kentucky Derby is often called, is 1 ¼ miles long and the first race in the Triple Crown each year, a feat completed by also winning the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. For 37 years after Affirmed won it in 1978, the Triple Crown throne sat vacant. Then, in 2015 American Pharoah broke through and then Justify did it just three years later.\n\nOnly three-year-old thoroughbred horses are eligible to run in the race, and a series of qualifying events narrows the field to the top 20. Owners pay $25,000 to enter their horse into the Kentucky Derby and another $25,000 if or when that horse enters the starting gate. Everything done to support these horses, from breeding to birth to development, is to create a horse that can win the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThree years old is a relatively young age for a thoroughbred horse. Some horses, like Flightline (foaled in 2018), may hit their peak after the three-year-old season, but winning a Kentucky Derby changes everything for your owner, trainer and family.\n\nThe winner of this year’s 150th Kentucky Derby will win $3.1 million. It is the second-richest race in North America, behind only the Breeders’ Cup Classic ($7 million). The inaugural Kentucky Derby in 1875 paid out only $2,850 to the winner and $200 to the runner-up. Today, that $2,850 winner’s purse would be worth $80,922.38 in purchasing power.\n\nAristides won that first Kentucky Derby, beating 14 horses. It was run at 1 ½ miles instead of today’s 1 ¼ miles, a length that was established later in 1896.\n\nSecretariat still holds the Kentucky Derby track record at 1:59.40.The only other winner to break the two-minute mark is Monarchos in 2001 (1:59.97). The second-fastest time run in a Derby is by Sham (1:59.90), who lost to Secretariat by 2 ½ lengths.\n\nThe Twin Spires\n\nChurchill Downs opened in 1875, and the famous Twin Spires grandstand was built in 1894-1895. The spires were designed by Joseph D. Baldez and were originally created for ornamental purposes as part of the grandstand. The Winners’ Circle is located directly below the grandstand, which is updated every year with the dates of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nWhile the spires have not been there for every Kentucky Derby, they have become the iconic image tied to Churchill Downs, horse racing and the city of Louisville itself.\n\nThe Spires were part of a restoration project in 2002. Scaffolding was built around each spire, and interior walls were removed so engineers could access the structural support and determine how the structures had aged over 107 years. Only minor work was required to stabilize the existing supports.\n\nThe restoration cost $209,000 — which is far more than the original $40,000 spent to build them.\n\nThe Silks\n\nCasual race fans may wonder how the jockeys get their uniquely colored outfits for the Kentucky Derby. Their “silks” are designed by the horses’ owners, which helps fans and broadcasters easily identify horses during the race.\n\nWearing silks dates back to 1700s England. At that time, the uniforms were actually made out of silk, though they’re now mostly made of nylon and other fabrics that breathe easier and are more aerodynamic. But the name stuck.\n\nSilks must be registered with The Jockey Club and renewed every year. No two silks can be the same, and navy blue cannot be used as it looks too much like black from a distance. Even with these stipulations, more than 30,000 designs are currently registered.\n\nTriple Crown winners Gallant Fox (1930) and Omaha (1935) both wore red polka-dots on their silks because they both had the same owner.\n\nSecretariat’s blue-and-white checkerboard is famous in horse racing and is also used on the jerseys of the Kentucky Wildcats basketball team.\n\nBarbaro Statue Outside the Main Gate\n\nBarbaro won the 2006 Kentucky Derby by 6 ½ lengths — the largest margin of victory in the Derby since 1946. He was only the sixth undefeated horse to win the Kentucky Derby at the time. He suffered a broken leg in the Preakness Stakes and went through numerous surgeries in an attempt at rehabilitation. Tragically, his owners eventually had to euthanize him on January 29, 2007, after complications led to the decision that he couldn’t manage the pain anymore. The statue in his honor was unveiled on April 26, 2009.\n\nKentucky Derby Facts and Figures\n\n• The 400 roses are individually hand-sewn together to create the winner’s garland, which is 2.5 yards long, 14 inches wide and weighs around 40 pounds. There are more than 2,100 roses in the Winner’s Circle, and 250 rose bushes around the facility, along with 12,000 tulips.\n\n• Three fillies (young females) have won the Kentucky Derby, but none have won since Winning Colors in 1988. Genuine Risk (1980) and Regret (1915) are the other fillies who have won the Kentucky Derby.\n\n• Justify, who won the 144th Kentucky Derby, was the first winner in 136 years who never ran as a 2-year-old. He went on to win the Triple Crown.\n\n• The field has held 20 starters each year since 1975 — the largest horse racing field in America.\n\n• No horse that starts with the letter Q, X or Y has won the Kentucky Derby.\n\n• No horse bred outside of the United States has won the Derby since Canada’s Sunny’s Halo won in 1983.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nGhosts of the Kentucky Derby: From Lewis & Clark to the race's near demise\n\n(Lede image: Eamonn Dalton / The Athletic; Jeff Gentner / Getty Images, Jerry Cooke / Corbis via Getty Images, Michael Reaves / Getty Images; Graphics: Drew Jordan / The Athletic; Photo of Barbaro statue: Mark Cornelision / Lexington Herald-Leader / Tribune News Service via Getty Images; Photos of winner’s garland: Simon Bruty / Sports Illustrated via Getty Images, Jamie Squire / Getty Images; Photo of starting gate: Brian Spurlock / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"
