(Thursday, March 21, 2024) – The Road to Kentucky Derby 150 will kick into high gear Saturday as horses will compete in their final prep races before the $5 million Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve (Grade I) on Saturday, May 4.\n\nThe action will begin at 6:25 p.m. (all times Eastern) at Turfway Park where an over-subscribed field of 14 3-year-olds were entered in the 53rd running of the $700,000 Jeff Ruby Steaks (GIII), a race that produced Kentucky Derby 148 winner Rich Strike and Kentucky Derby 149 runner-up Two Phil’s.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later at Fair Grounds, Lecomte (GIII) and Gun Runner winner Track Phantom leads a competitive cast of 12 3-year-olds in the $1 million TwinSpires.com Louisiana Derby (GII).\n\nOver the next three weekends, there will be eight “Championship Series” races that will award points to the top five finishers on a 100-50-25-15-10 scale as horses attempt to qualify for the Kentucky Derby.\n\nMULTIPLE GRADED STAKES WINNER ENDLESSLY HEADS OVER-SUBSCRIBED JEFF RUBY STEAKS – Amerman Racing’s El Camino Real Derby winner Endlessly will ship more than 2,000 miles from his Southern California base to face an over-subscribed field of 14 3-year-olds that entered Saturday’s 53rd running of the $700,000 Jeff Ruby Steaks (Grade III), the marquee race of the Turfway Park season in Florence, Ky.\n\nThe Jeff Ruby Steaks is a pivotal stop for many of the nation’s top 3-year-olds on the Road to the Kentucky Derby. The 1 1/8-mile affair will go as Race 12 of 13 with a post time of 6:25 p.m. First post for the stellar program is 12:45 p.m.\n\nAlong with the Jeff Ruby Steaks, the stakes-laden card also will feature the 42nd running of the $300,000 Bourbonette Oaks (Listed); 24th running of the $300,000 TwinSpires Kentucky Cup Classic (GIII); 38th running of the $250,000 Animal Kingdom Stakes; 42nd running of the $250,000 Latonia Stakes; and 37th running of the $250,000 Rushaway.\n\nHorses in the Jeff Ruby Steaks will be competing for a total of 200 qualifying points as they attempt to earn a position in the starting gate for the 150th running of the $5 million Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve (GI). The top five finishers of the Jeff Ruby Steaks will be awarded points on a 100-50-25-15-10 scale.\n\nTrained by Michael McCarthy, Endlessly has been brilliant in four of his five career starts with victories in the El Camino Real Derby, Zuma Beach (GIII) and Del Mar Juvenile Turf (GIII). The only blemish on the son of Oscar Performance’s resumé is a disappointing eighth-place finish in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf (GI) when he had a wide journey throughout but was only defeated 3 ½ lengths by Unquestionable. Endlessly began his 3-year-old campaign in the El Camino Real Derby when he defeated Tapalo by 1 ¼ lengths as the heavy 3-5 favorite. Jockey Umberto Rispoli will have the mount in the Jeff Ruby Steaks as the 5-2 morning line favorite.\n\nChief among Endlessly’s rivals is Jack Oxley, Harold Lerner, AWC Stables and Magdalena Racing’s Northern Flame. Conditioned by Kenny McPeek and ridden by Julien Leparoux, Northern Flame already banked 18 points on the Road to the Kentucky Derby with his third-place finish in last month’s Rebel (GII) along with a fourth-place finish in the Breeders’ Futurity (GI) and fifth-place finish in the Street Sense (GIII).\n\nSeveral other accomplished 3-year-olds entered the Jeff Ruby Steaks including Iroquois Stakes (GIII) winnerWest Saratoga, Mucho Macho Man Stakes winner Otello and Riley Allison Derby winner Lucky Jeremy.\n\nOne of the few horses that entered the Jeff Ruby who are in search of their first stakes victory isMyRacehorse’s recent Oaklawn allowance winner Seize the Grey. The improving son of Arrogate is trained by two-time Jeff Ruby Steaks winner D. Wayne Lukas, who won this race in 1995 with Serena’s Song and in 1983 with Marfa. Seize the Grey will be ridden by Nik Juarez.\n\nHere is the complete field for the Jeff Ruby Steaks in order of post position (with jockey, trainer and morning line odds): Freedom Principle (Adam Beschizza, Jose Garaffalo, 30-1); Dancing Groom (Frankie Dettori, Antonio Sano, 15-1); Lucky Jeremy (Gerardo Corrales, Bill Morey, 15-1); Noted (Luis Saez, Pletcher, 15-1); Agate Road (Ortiz, Pletcher, 4-1); Northern Flame (Leparoux, McPeek, 5-1); Woodcourt (Luan Machado, Cipriano Contreras, 6-1); Otello (Javier Castellano, Christophe Clement, 10-1); Seize the Grey (Juarez, Lukas, 6-1); Endlessly (Rispoli, McCarthy, 5-2); Baytown Chatterbox (Albin Jiminez, Paul McEntee, 30-1) and West Saratoga (Jesus Castanon, Larry Demeritte, 20-1). Also-Eligibles: Circle P (Tyler Conner, Flint Stites, 30-1) and Triple Espresso (Ortiz, Pletcher, 20-1).\n\nHall of Fame trainer Todd Pletcher entered Repole Stable and St. Elias Stable’s Sam F. Davis Stakes (GIII) runner-up Agate Road but stated the colt is likely to scratch to run in the TwinSpires.com Louisiana Derby (GII).\n\nThe Jeff Ruby Steaks will be broadcast live on CNBC and Peacock. The broadcast will span 6-7 p.m. and also will feature the Fair Grounds Oaks (GII) and Louisiana Derby (GII).\n\nFans can watch and wager on the entire Jeff Ruby Steaks Day program on www.TwinSpires.com, the official wagering provider of Churchill Downs Incorporated and the Kentucky Derby. Racing from Turfway Park is also streamed on the Churchill Downs LIVE app on smart TVs.\n\nAnnouncer Tony Calo will call all the action on Jeff Ruby Steaks Day with analyst Kaitlin Free hosting the simulcast show live in the Jeff Ruby VIP Ballroom with Churchill Downs’ track announcer Travis Stone.\n\nFanDuel TV is another option for fans to watch the action from Turfway Park. Analysts Gabby Gaudet andMatt Carrothers will be on-site at Turfway Park on Saturday to bring live reports and analysis.\n\nFor more information about Jeff Ruby Steaks Day and to purchase tickets, visit www.Turfway.com.\n\nLECOMTE, GUN RUNNER HERO TRACK PHANTOM TOPS $1 MILLION TWINSPIRES.COMLOUISIANA DERBY – (written by Fair Grounds media relations specialist Kevin Kilroy)\n\nA half-length shy of adding the Risen Star to his Gun Runner and Lecomte wins, L and N Racing, Clark Brewster, Jerry Caroom and Breeze Easy’s Track Phantom headlines 12 males on the hunt for a share of the 200 Kentucky Derby qualifying points up for grabs in Saturday’s $1 million TwinSpires.com Louisiana Derby (GII) at Fair Grounds Race Course & Slots.\n\nThe first prep race to offer 100-50-25-15-10 points towards a spot in the $5 million Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve (GI), post time is 6:42 p.m. (all times Eastern) for the 1 3/16 miles stamina test. With eight stakes worth $2.7 million carded for Saturday’s “Louisiana Derby Day,” the 111th running of the Louisiana Derby is the finale of the 12-race program, which begins at 1 p.m. The $400,000 Fair Grounds Oaks presented by Fasig-Tipton (GII) goes as Race 11 (6:08 p.m.) and will award Kentucky Oaks qualifying points (100-50-25-15-10) to the top five in that 3-year-old filly event.\n\nTrack Phantom had everything his own way in the Risen Star (GII). Breaking to the lead and moving comfortably through slow fractions, the son of Quality Road trained by Steve Asmussen was passed in the final stages by Sierra Leone, finishing a half-length shy of sweeping the local preps to date.\n\nThe Risen Star is the only chink in Track Phantom’s two-turn armor as the colt has won his other three attempts, including dominant victories in both the Gun Runner and Lecomte (GIII). Having racked up 55 points towards the “Run for the Roses,” Track Phantom currently ranks tied for fourth on the Road to the Kentucky Derby Leaderboard.\n\nDrawing the far outside post, the 3-1 morning line favorite will be guided once again by Joel Rosario.\n\nAmong his top competitors is stablemate Hall of Fame. Owned by Mrs. John Magnier, Michael Tabor, Derrick Smith, Westerberg, Gandharvi and Brooke Smith, the Gun Runner colt dazzled in his 10 ¼-length maiden-breaking score on the Lecomte undercard, but he fell flat down the homestretch over the sloppy track to finish seventh in the Risen Star.\n\nRicardo Santana Jr. returns to the irons and will break Hall of Fame from gate 2.\n\nSecond-choice in the morning line at 5-1 is Albaugh Family Stables’ Catching Freedom. A debut-winner at Churchill Downs in October, the son of Constitution trained by Brad Cox took the Smarty Jones by over two lengths in his first effort going two turns. Finishing third in the Risen Star under jockey Luis Saez to bring his points total to 25, Catching Freedom will have Flavien Prat aboard as he breaks from post 5 in the Louisiana Derby.\n\nCutting the corner turning for home last out in the Rebel (GII), Tony Holmes’ Common Defense rallied up the rail to finish second behind Timberlake. One of two entered by Kenny McPeek, along with Tilted Shamrock Stables’ Real Men Violin, Common Defense ranks 10th in the Road to the Kentucky Derby Point Standings with 27. The dark bay Karakontie colt will be reunited with his Rebel pilot, Brian Hernandez Jr.\n\nReal Men Violin exits an eighth-place finish in the Risen Star, his first start since running second in November’s Kentucky Jockey Club (GII) and will break from just inside his stablemate in post 9 with Corey Lanerie holding the reins.\n\nOccupying three of the inside four post positions, the trio of Louisiana Derby entrants trained by Todd Pletcher are led by Repole Stable and St. Elias Stables’ Pilgrim (GII) winner Agate Road. The Quality Road colt exits a second-place finish to No More Time in the Sam F. Davis (GIII) at Tampa Bay Downs where he earned 10 qualifying points. His previous four races were on the turf, including a solid late-kicking fifth in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf (GI), defeated by only 2 ½ lengths. Aboard for each of Agate Road’s grass starts, jockey Irad Ortiz Jr. will leg up on the Pletcher trainee, made 8-1 in the morning line.\n\nPletcher leads all trainers with five Louisiana Derby victories, including saddling last year’s gate-to-wire winner Kingsbarns. Along with Agate Road, he entered Centennial Farms’ last-out local maiden winnerAntiquarian and Repole Stable and St. Elias Stables’ Triple Espresso, who would make his dirt debut in the Louisiana Derby.\n\nPletcher stated Wednesday that Triple Espresso could scratch from the Louisiana Derby in favor of Saturday’s $700,000 Jeff Ruby Steaks (GIII) at Turfway Park.\n\nAnother accomplished sophomore entered in the Louisiana Derby is Ribble Farms, Michael Eiserman, Earl Silver, Kenneth Fishbein, and Daniel Fishbein’s Honor Marie. The winner of the Kentucky Jockey Club returned to the races to finish fifth in the Risen Star for trainer Whit Beckman.\n\nJockey Ben Curtis has been named to ride the Honor Code colt, replacing Rafael Bejarano.\n\nHere’s the complete field for the Risen Star from the rail out (with jockey, trainer, and morning line): Triple Espresso (Luis Saez, Pletcher, 20-1); Hall of Fame (Santana, Asmussen, 8-1); Antiquarian (John Velazquez, Pletcher, 12-1); Agate Road (Irad Ortiz Jr., Pletcher, 8-1); Catching Freedom (Prat, Cox, 4-1); Awesome Ruta(Mitchell Murrill, Joey Foster, 30-1); Honor Marie (Curtis, Beckman, 8-1); Next Level (Jose Riquelme, Keith Desormeaux, 30-1); Real Men Violin (Corey Lanerie, McPeek, 20-1); Common Defense (Hernandez, McPeek, 6-1); Tuscan Gold (Tyler Gaffalione, Chad Brown, 8-1); and Track Phantom (Rosario, Asmussen, 3-1).\n\nJEFF RUBY STEAKS QUOTES\n\nMichael McCarthy, trainer, Endlessly: “We tried to give him a short break after the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf (GI) but he’s a feel-good type of horse. He likes to train and we were able to get him back slowly after that race to the El Camino Real Derby. … His works on dirt haven’t really stood out, they’ve just been steady. He’s a different type of horse than Rombauer (who won the El Camino Real Derby before winning the 2021 Preakness Stakes on dirt).\n\nUmberto Rispoli, jockey, Endlessly: “I worked him at Del Mar before he made his first start and he’s a very nice horse. In the El Camino Real Derby, I was just taking my time with him early with the speed ahead of me. This type of horse needs to be settled with his action. Around the turn (in the El Camino Real Derby) I had to ask him to get going. Once he switched leads, he took off. I could’ve went another pole.”\n\nBill Morey, trainer, Lucky Jeremy: “There really isn’t one standout in this race. He’s a nice horse and ran some good races in New Mexico. I’m looking forward to seeing him run in there.”\n\nLOUISIANA DERBY QUOTES\n\nSteve Asmussen, trainer, Track Phantom, Hall of Fame: “I generally believe for 3-year-olds, your last race is not good enough for your next one to be. That’s the way it ought to be. (Track Phantom) is a wonderful horse. I’m very fortunate to have him here at Fair Grounds for the 3-year-old series. He has run extremely well in the three prior races here at Fair Grounds. Hopefully we can get him in the winner’s circle again Saturday. … (Hall of Fame) had no excuses with the sloppy surface last out in the Risen Star. We like who he his, like how he came out of his last race, like how he’s trained back and are very fortunate to have this good of a 3-year-old at this time of year in this significant of a race.”\n\nBrad Cox, trainer, Catching Freedom: “He’s always been the kind of horse that’s a little funny when he gets off the rail, he kind of wants to lean in a little bit. He’s still a little green, he’s still learning. He’s always been a fairly average work horse but in his last two works he’s been a little bit more into it, finishing up a little better and his gallop outs have been better. I’m optimistic he can take a step forward and he’s had a good five weeks since the Risen Star. We’ve liked what we’ve seen since.\n\nWhit Beckman, trainer, Honor Marie: “I really like the distance of the Louisiana Derby.
