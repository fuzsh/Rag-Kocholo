        "text": "Michael Burns has jokingly been referred to as “Karsh of the Backstretch”, as he has photographed the likes of Northern Dancer, Sunny’s Halo, Secretariat and countless other thoroughbreds.\n\nFor over forty years he has been the official photographer for the Ontario Jockey Club. He has several awards from the Professional Photographers Association of Canada, and has won an unprecedented five Sovereign Awards for excellence in thoroughbred racing photography.\n\nMichael is the only Canadian photographer to have won the Eclipse Award twice. He was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nResiding in Etobicoke for more than thirty years, Michael Burns is regarded as one of Canada’s finest sports photographers, covering all major sporting events including Kentucky Derbies, Breeder’s Cup Extravaganzas, World Cup skiing, World Cup curling, championship boxing, Olympic and Commonwealth games, and National Hockey League games, for more than fifty years.\n\nHumber College has a rich and storied athletics tradition in Etobicoke, with intercollegiate competition officially beginning in 1967. It only took one year before the Hawks claimed their first Ontario College Athletic Association (OCAA) provincial title – a women’s curling gold medal in the winter of 1969.\n\nWhile Humber now boasts the most extensive varsity program in the country, with 20 men’s and women’s squads, it still adheres to the same ‘athletics for all’ philosophy that was established over a half century ago. Along with varsity, the department also operates a vigorous intramural program with over 15 sports and annual events at both the North and Lakeshore campus, as well as an expansive recreational menu.\n\nHumber traditionally has considered athletics to be an integral part of the educational experience – highlighted by its national-best 141 Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) Academic All-Canadian selections. This award is one of the most prestigious honours bestowed upon a student-athlete, epitomizing their commitment to academic success and athletic achievement.\n\nThe primary standard had been success against its 27 peer institutions in the OCAA, where the Hawks squads have captured more than 330 gold medals since 1969 – by far the most in the province.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1991 when Humber was able to conquer the national mountaintop, as the men’s basketball program won Humber’s first CCAA title. Since then, the Hawks have gone on to capture 66 more national gold medals, setting a new standard that no college in the country can match.\n\nThe college’s international imprint has begun to grow over the last two decades, with student-athletes going on to play professionally overseas or representing Canada in basketball, volleyball, golf, curling, badminton, and more.\n\nThe Olympics, the biggest sporting event in the world, has seen a handful of Hawks compete, including a duo from Humber badminton in the upcoming games in Paris 2024.\n\nHumber Athletics and the Etobicoke Sports Hall of Fame have been synonymous for more than two decades, with nearly 100 student-athletes receiving scholarships during that span. Former Humber athletic director Doug Fox – who played an integral role in Humber’s collaboration with the ESHOF – was inducted into the hall in 2013, while retired Sports Information Director Jim Bialek was on the board of governors for nearly a decade.\n\nJohn Siscos, the Director of Marketing, Communications, and Stakeholder Relations at Woodbine Entertainment Group/ORM/Ontario Racing, spoke highly of his friend and colleague Michael Burns Jr. being inducted into the Etobicoke Sports Hall of Fame, calling it the “greatest thing of all time.” Siscos praised Burns for his exceptional work as the official photographer at Woodbine Racetrack, highlighting his outstanding action shots and training photographs. Burns is also known for his work with the Canadian Curling Association and has covered numerous Olympic Games and championships, earning several awards for his photography, including nine Sovereign Awards for outstanding achievement in thoroughbred racing.\n\nSiscos emphasized Burns’ contributions to sports photography and his ability to capture the essence of sports moments, particularly in horse racing and curling. He mentioned Burns’ role in organizing photography coverage for major races at Woodbine, such as The Queen’s Plate and the Breeders’ Stakes. Siscos described Burns as an ambassador for the sport, known for his professionalism and dedication.\n\nBurns, who grew up in the Markland Wood section of Etobicoke, followed in his father’s footsteps to become a renowned sports photographer. He has covered a wide range of sports events and has left a lasting impact on the sports photography industry in Canada.\n\nJohn Spence, born and raised in Mimico, Ontario, was a gifted athlete and influential figure in the world of sports and education. His athletic talents were evident from a young age, with his baseball teams winning provincial championships in several age categories. At Mimico High School, he excelled in basketball, football, and track and field, earning the title of Athlete of the Year in 1956, following in his father’s footsteps who had won the same honor 31 years earlier. He later played football for the University of Toronto Varsity Blues.\n\nAfter graduating from U of T, Spence embarked on a remarkable 35-year teaching career, with 30 years spent at Kipling Collegiate Institute. Known affectionately as “Mr. Kipling,” he became a legendary figure in Etobicoke’s sports community. He played a pivotal role in building winning teams and establishing strong sports programs at Kipling and in the Etobicoke and Toronto High School Sports associations.\n\nSpence was a founding member of the Etobicoke Athletic Association and served as its President in 1970. He also held a leadership role in the Toronto District Athletic Association, serving as President in 1980. In 1994, his significant contributions to high school sports were recognized by the Ontario OFSAA governing body.\n\nBeyond his coaching and administrative achievements, Spence was revered as a role model and mentor who positively impacted thousands of students and student-athletes. Former students, including Ian Troop, credited Spence for shaping their character, instilling discipline, hard work, and a competitive spirit that served them well in both sports and business.\n\nSpence’s coaching philosophy emphasized preparation, discipline, and sportsmanship. His teams were known for their composure, dignity, and competitive edge, reflecting the values and teachings of their coach. Through his dedication and passion for sports and education, John Spence left a lasting legacy in the Etobicoke community and beyond.\n\nTrent Frayne, born in Brandon, Manitoba, is one of Canada’s most distinguished journalists, having written for all of Toronto’s major papers along with Maclean’s, Chatelaine, Sports Illustrated, and Saturday Evening Post magazines.\n\nTrent began his illustrious career in 1938, writing for the Winnipeg Tribune. Since then, he has covered the Olympics, the Canada-Russia Summit series, Grey Cups, Stanley Cups, the Kentucky Derby, and boxing. Every so often, he would make a cameo appearance on radio or television.\n\nAlso to his credit are fourteen sports books, hundreds of magazine articles, and stints on radio and television.\n\nHe received the National Newspaper Award in 1975 for sports writing. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1984 and the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nIn 1990, Trent was honored as a life member by the Baseball Writers of America and was the first recipient of Brandon University’s Quill Award for Outstanding Achievement that same year.\n\nSince then, he has been honored in the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian News Hall of Fame.\n\nJournalist, author, historian and official scorer. Louis Cauz has had a wide and varied career, but his love of sport began when he was just a boy, watching and playing baseball, hockey and basketball. He played baseball for the Hamilton Mountain Lions, ran Track and Field with the Hamilton Armours for Westdale Collegiate, and played goalie during the 40s and early 50s, working out on occasion with the Hamilton Tiger Cubs at the Forum.\n\nDuring the 1950s World Series between Philadelphia and the Yankees, Louis sat by the teletype as they pumped out scores and statistics. He was hooked. He loved all sports, and while Louis says he wasn’t very good at playing them, sport reporting was his opportunity to participate and be the interpreter of a sporting event for the public.\n\nWhen Louis was18 years old he joined the Hamilton Spectator, where he fell in love with the newspaper business, and dedicated himself to becoming a writer and sports reporter. After years as an office boy and proof reader, Louis got his opportunity to write in 1955.\n\nTwo years later he moved to Toronto and joined the Globe and Mail where his career as a writer and reporter flourished. Louis had the opportunity to cover news and politics, but eventually made his way back to sports and started covering horse racing in the mid 60s.\n\nDuring his first year covering hockey in 1967, the Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup. For more than 17 years at the Globe and Mail, Louis covered all sports including the hockey, football, baseball, skiing, tennis and curling.\n\nSome of his deepest memories include, witnessing Hank Arron tie Babe Ruth’s record, covering the Olympic Games in Munich, and being honoured with a Sovereign Award by The Jockey Club of Canada in 1984 for his book “The Plate: A Royal Tradition.”\n\nHe has been an Official Scorer for the American League at the Rogers Centre since 1989, and is the Managing Director of the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nLouis is married and has six children, and seven grandchildren.\n\nGeorge Gross who has been a fulltime sports journalist in Canada for 44 years, arrived in Canada in 1950 with a limited knowledge of English and $4.50 in his pocket.\n\nHe was born in January 1923 in Bratislava, Slovakia, and at age 27 escaped from his home to Austria by rowing across the Danube River. Upon arrival in Canada, he worked on a farm for $30 a month with room and board.\n\nAfter a freelance career with the Toronto Telegram and on radio stations CKFH and CFRB, including coverage of the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, George was offered a fulltime job with The Telegram in January 1959. He stayed with the paper until its demise in 1971, when he became sports editor of the Toronto Sun, a function he held for 15 years. He is now corporate sports editor of The Toronto Sun.\n\nDuring his career, George won the 1974 National Newspaper Award, as well as his newspaper chain’s Dunlop Award and authored three books: Toronto Olympiad For The Handicapped (1976), Donald Jackson, King of Blades (1977) and Hockey Night in Canada (1982-83).\n\nGeorge was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985 and is the only Canadian journalist who received the Olympic Order (1994). He’s a member of Variety Village, has chaired the Conn Smythe Sports Celebrities Dinner for Handicapped Children for 13 years and received such honours as the Ontario Achievement Award (1973); the Ontario Medal for Good Citizenship, Gold Medal of the International Ice Hockey Federation in 1980; City of Toronto Medal and was the first recipient of the Promises of Hope Award in 1999 for his work on behalf of the Canadian Save The Children Fund.\n\nGeorge is currently president of Sports Media Canada and Life Member of the Association Internationale de la Presse Sportive.\n\nFather John Redmond CSB was born in Weston, Ontario in 1934 and aspired to helping others all his life. He was a faithful priest, dedicated teacher and accomplished coach.\n\nEducated in Toronto at St Michael’s College and later a the University of Windsor, Father Redmond was ordained a Basilian priest in 1963.\n\nHis entire professional teaching career, which spanned 1963 to his death in 1981, revolved around Michael Power High School. He was the school’s athletic director for thirteen years and principal from 1976 to 1981.\n\nHe helped develop thousands of Etobicoke teenagers into responsible adults through his example of a Christian life and through the discipline of sport.\n\nUnder Father Redmond’s tutelage, Power won fifteen Toronto and District College School Athletic Association Track Championships and, provincially, nine out of ten Ontario Federation of Secondary Schools Association Crowns.\n\nIn 1976, an American reporter wrote that the Power track team won a US invitational meet over 243 schools “handily”.\n\nFather Redmond had the ability to motivate individuals, build teams and inspire students. Many Etobicoke residents will never forget his record in that era.\n\nThe Metro Separate School Board renamed the former Alderwood High School Father Redmond High School.\n\nGeorge developed a close relationship with the Faustina Club, and was president of the Lakeshore Lacrosse Association from 1962 to 1965.\n\nHe was honored by the Mimico Old-Timers Association for 30 years’ service with the Mimico Lacrosse Club, 25 years of service with the Metro B Hockey Association in 1980, and was given a community service award from the City of Etobicoke in 1991.\n\nGeorge has also held executive positions with the Ontario Lacrosse Association and the Canadian Lacrosse Association, who gave him a life membership for his unselfish service to the advancement of Canada’s national game. George was also instrumental in the World Field Lacrosse Championship in Ontario, and later set up the Indian Lacrosse tournament held at Expo ’67.\n\nGeorge has also held executive positions with the Ontario Lacrosse Association and the Canadian Lacrosse Association, who gave him a life membership for his unselfish service to the advancement of Canada’s national game. George was also instrumental in the World Field Lacrosse Championship in Ontario, and later set up the Indian Lacrosse tournament held at Expo ’67.\n\nHis overall contribution to sports was honored when he was awarded the Centennial Medal in recognition of valuable service to the nation.\n\nIt’s been said that George Duddin was Etobicoke’s resident hockey historian. He spent as many hours as a statistician as he did a public relations secretary. What began as a hobby -writing publicity for a Mimico soccer club in 1934 in a temporary capacity – led to a 43 year job as sports editor."
