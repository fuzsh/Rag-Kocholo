        "text": "*NEW*\n\nDON'T DIE Beer\n\nCheers! This year we will release a limited-edition custom-labeled beer featuring Stephen and Sawyer's slogan, \"DON'T DIE.\" This was advice Sawyer once wrote in his dad’s birthday card, along with a drawing of their shared love of tanks (see below for more details). Later, this would also become their slogan in Stephen’s fight against brain cancer. After a 10-month battle, Stephen passed away from glioblastoma, but we continue to honor his memory by toasting to him.\n\nFuture plans of the campaign DON’T DIE will support additional loved ones currently battling cancer, or loved ones we’ve lost but wish to keep their memory thriving. Next year, we plan to release another special edition print, but include names of YOUR loved ones impacted by cancer so you can continue to toast to them and show your support. Click below to learn more about how to share your story and honor those impacted by cancer.\n\nThanks to the help of Lion Bridge Brewing Company!\n\nAbout Glioblastoma & Brain Cancer\n\nGlioblastoma (GBM), or grade four brain cancer, is the most common form of brain cancer accounting for 47.7% of cases. With standard care of treatment (surgery, radiation and chemotherapy), patients on average only live about one year. The FDA has only approved four drugs in 50 years for GBM. Survival and mortality rates have been unchanged for decades. The cause is unknown, and there is no cure. Although the #1 cause of cancer deaths for men and women under the age of 40 (including children), brain cancer receives only 1-3% of total cancer research. GBM needs both increased awareness and funds raised to help advance treatments and save life's before it is too late.\n\nPictures from Last Year's Party\n\nHighlights from Stephen's Birthday Fundraiser 2023\n\nThank you to the 200+ attendees last year who joined our fight and helped raise over $13,000 for brain cancer research and treatment in Eastern Iowa. We are excited to host another fundraiser to support others and honor loved ones impacted by cancer while paving a better path for the future."
