The games that didn't make the cut this year include Final Fantasy VII, Myst, Portal, Resident Evil and Microsoft Windows Solitaire.\n\nWhich doesn't mean they won't make it in later: immortal classics Sonic the Hedgehog and The Legend of Zelda were passed over in the Hall of Fame's inaugural set in 2015, but then were inducted the next year. The latest collection spanned 30 years between the releases of Donkey Kong in 1981 and Halo: Combat Evolved in 2001, following the Hall of Fame's tradition to include games that \"enjoyed popularity over a sustained period and have exerted influence on the video game industry or on popular culture and society in general.\" Q*bert fans, you might have to wait before more deserving games get welcomed in, but hey -- don't let us tell you what to nominate."
