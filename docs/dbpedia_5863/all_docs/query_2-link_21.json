        "text": "The Arkansas Derby is the most lucrative thoroughbred horse race in Arkansas, currently offering a “purse” of $1 million. The purse is the prize money that is divided among the horses competing in the race, based upon their finish, with the winner receiving sixty percent. The one-and-one-eighth-mile race is restricted to horses that are three years old. It is traditionally held each year at Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort in Hot Springs (Garland County) on the second Saturday of April. Over time, it has developed into one of the nation’s leading preparatory races for the Triple Crown, which comprises the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes.\n\nThe Arkansas Derby was first held in 1936 and carried a $5,000 purse. The winner that year was Holl Image, who went on to finish sixth in the Kentucky Derby. The purse was increased to $50,000 in 1965, and it became Oaklawn’s first $100,000 race in 1972. The purse underwent several more increases throughout the years and was raised to $1 million in 2004, the year the track celebrated its centennial, and later increased to $1.25 million. For the 2024 season, the purse was raised to $1.5 million.\n\nThe race has been held every year since 1936, with the exception of 1945, when Oaklawn was forced to cancel its entire racing meet because of World War II. The race was run in two divisions in 1960 to accommodate a large number of horses. The Arkansas Derby has been won by one female horse—Althea in 1984. Althea also holds the record for the fastest Arkansas Derby time of 1:46.8.\n\nThe first Arkansas Derby winner to win a Triple Crown race was Elocutionist, who won the 1976 race and that year’s Preakness Stakes. Sunny’s Halo became the race’s first Kentucky Derby winner in 1983. Someday Farm’s Smarty Jones won the Arkansas Derby in 2004 and earned a $5 million bonus for also winning Oaklawn’s Southwest and Rebel stakes and the Kentucky Derby. Smarty Jones followed his Kentucky Derby triumph by winning the Preakness Stakes and just missed winning the Triple Crown after taking second in the Belmont Stakes. In 2015, American Pharoah won the Arkansas Derby and followed that up by becoming the first Triple Crown winner in thirty-seven years. As of 2015, the Arkansas Derby has produced six Kentucky Derby winners, eleven Preakness Stakes winners, and six Belmont Stakes winners.\n\nIn 2020, the Arkansas Derby was split into two divisions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had resulted in the closure of racetracks across the country.\n\nList of Arkansas Derby Winners\n\n2024 Muth 2023 Angel of Empire 2022 Cyberknife 2021 Super Stock 2020, First Division Charlatan 2020, Second Division Nadal 2019 Omaha Beach 2018 Magnum Moon 2017 Classic Empire 2016 Creator 2015 American Pharoah 2014 Danza 2013 Overanalyze 2012 Bodemeister 2011 Archarcharch 2010 Line of David 2009 Papa Clem 2008 Gayego 2007 Curlin 2006 Lawyer Ron 2005 Afleet Alex 2004 Smarty Jones 2003 Sir Cherokee 2002 Private Emblem 2001 Balto Star 2000 Graeme Hall 1999 Certain 1998 Victory Gallop 1997 Crypto Star 1996 Zarb’s Magic 1995 Dazzling Falls 1994 Concern 1993 Rockamundo 1992 Pine Bluff 1991 Olympio 1990 Silver Ending 1989 Dansil 1988 Proper Reality 1987 Demons Begone 1986 Rampage 1985 Tank’s Prospect 1984 Althea 1983 Sunny’s Halo 1982 Hostage 1981 Bold Ego 1980 Temperence Hill 1979 Golden Act 1978 Esops Foibles 1977 Clever Tell 1976 Elocutionist 1975 Promised City 1974 J.R.’s Pet 1973 Impecunious 1972 No Le Hace 1971 Twist the Axe 1970 Herbalist 1969 Traffic Mark 1968 Nodouble 1967 Monitor 1966 Better Sea 1965 Swift Ruler 1964 Prince Davelle 1963 Cosmic Tip 1962 Areopolis 1961 Light Talk 1960, First Division Spring Broker 1960, Second Division Persian Gold 1959 Al Davelle 1958 Count Deblanc 1957 Kentucky Roman 1956 Johns Chic 1955 Trim Destiny 1954 Timely Tip 1953 Curragh King 1952 Gushing Oil 1951 Ruhe 1950 Big Ike 1949 Cacomo 1948 Fertile Lands 1947 Fleetridge 1946 Bob Murphy 1945 No Running 1944 Challenge Me 1943 Seven Hearts 1942 With Regards 1941 He Rolls 1940 Super Chief 1939 Ariel Toy 1938 Tiger 1937 Eastport 1936 Holl Image\n\nFor additional information:\n\nA Century of Excitement, Oaklawn 1904–2004.
