        "text": "Normally Oaklawn Park's three-year-old attrition rate comes as a result of lost races, not injury. As the sophomores head towards the Arkansas Derby, then the Triple Crown races, they pretty much eliminate themselves by not being able to match the competition. We are used to seeing other racing centers hit by injury more than Oaklawn.\n\nFor that reason, there was a real disappointment last Saturday afternoon when one of the stars of the season, Flying Zee Stable's Say I'm Smart, became a late scratch from the featured $114,750 Rebel Handicap.\n\nSay I'm Smart would have gone to the post as the favorite in a 12-horse field had he not developed a sizable filling in an ankle on Saturday morning. While trainer David Vance would not speculate on the exact nature of the injury pending X-rays taken immediately, the area of the swelling suggests the kind of problems that could take a few months or more to heal. Chances of Say I'm Smart having anything to do with the important spring races are slim at best.\n\nThat left 11 aspiring youngsters to contest the Rebel, all but one with a race or two in front of the public at Oaklawn. It turned out that the one no one had seen before left them all agog at the end.\n\nSunny's Halo, who captured the two-year-old championship last year in Canada, merely toyed with the field in his seasonal debut and left no doubt at the end.\n\nSunny's Halo represents a very interesting entrant into the three-year-old picture and one whose strong two-year-old season virtually assures that he will have sufficient earnings to qualify for the starting gate at Churchill Downs in the Kentucky Derby, should that oval need to invoke the house rule which now limits the Run for the Roses to the 20 money-winningest entrees if more than that number choose to run.\n\nWith his impressive score at Oaklawn on Saturday, Sunny's Halo now has tallied in six of his twelve races and run his career mark to $304,679. Up until Saturday most of that had been earned in the north land where he was five for seven with four of those wins in stakes competition. Trying stakes in America at four different tracks, Belmont Park, Saratoga, Laurel and the Meadowlands, the white-faced chestnut runner could do no better than a third in Belmont's Tremont Stakes at six furlongs as the 8-5 favorite.\n\nOff tracks have served Sunny's Halo well through his career and the rain early on Saturday certainly didn't compromise his chances at all.\n\nBut, most importantly, this horse showed the remarkable class of a good horse when, nearly four-and-a-half months away from competition, he relaxed behind the pace and responded willingly to Larry Snyder's urging to make all the right moves in getting the big win.\n\nTypical of the modern runner Sunny's Halo has already exceeded the monetary success of his sire, Halo. Halo was a prominent turf runner and enjoyed only moderately successful on the main surfaces. He earned $259,553 from nine wins in 31 starts before being sent to stud.\n\nAt stud he figured to be a big success. Halo is the son of Hail to Reason, one of the most prominent sires in American racing history, and his dam, Cosmah also produced the stakes winners Tosmah, Fathers Image and Maribeau as well as the dam of Kentucky Derby winner, Cannonade.\n\nEvents of the next few months will tell us a lot about the prospects of a stud career for Sunny's Halo as well. On the track he made believers of millions of Canadians and over 47,000 who witnessed his victory in the Rebel Handicap. He is bound to improve with that race and only an influx of important shippers for the Arkansas Derby can have an impact on him not being a post-time favorite for that race. It is particularly so now that Say I'm Smart appears out of the picture.\n\nRacing secretary and handicapper Jerry Botts released a list of 79 nominations his office received for the April 16 Arkansas Derby. With the aforementioned emphasis on career earnings in the Kentucky Derby, there are many late-developing sophomores being considered for the Oaklawn closing day feature.\n\nA number of the leading names from the sophomore class are included in the roster. They include such stalwarts as Laurel Futurity winner, Cast Party, the stretch-running Florida invader, Caveat, Young America stakes winner and Louisiana Derby favorite, Slewpy, and recent California stakes winner, Total Departure. These four are all serious prospects for the Arkansas Derby. In addition to Say I'm Smart, two others, Florida Derby winner Croeso, and Affirmed's brother, Silent Fox, have been injured recently and been required to change plans to race in Arkansas.\n\nAn odd turn of the fates has recently befallen jockey Larry Snyder.\n\nAfter a breakup with his longtime agent, Wendy Smith, Snyder also lost the mount on Say I'm Smart. Just when things go bad a light has a way of shining again and, so too, has it with Snyder.\n\nSnyder now has the mount on Sunny's Halo and can choose to accept it or take the call on C.V. Whitney's Exile King, the undefeated colt who ran the fastest mile and a sixteenth of the meet in taking an allowance race in his first local outing.\n\nThe Arkansas Derby is the one Oaklawn race which has eluded Snyder throughout his illustrious career and one that he most wants to win before the day he must hang us his tack. Riding in the shadow of Pat Day this year Snyder has had to accept an unaccustomed spot away from the headlines. With the chance for one of the key mounts for the Arkansas Derby, he may yet have the last laugh when the curtain winds down on Derby day.\n\nIncidentally Day did not participate at Oaklawn on Saturday, traveling instead to the Fairgrounds to ride Duped in the Fairgrounds Oaks. That filly failed in the Oaks and now a decision must be made on her status for the Fantasy Stakes at Oaklawn on Saturday, April 9. BIOG: NAME:\n\nArchive ID: 116810"
