        "text": "“I love that you advertise your business through the best customer service a company can offer! Purchasing tickets for the KY Oaks and Derby can be somewhat stressful, especially when the buyer is not located in KY. With all of the chaos of dealing with many customers, I never felt as though my questions/requests were being ignored or dismissed. Everyone I dealt with, including the owner Doug, was professional, courteous, and as accommodating as possible. From adding tickets to my existing order to purchasing a parking pass directly across from the gate we needed to enter, this company is the example with which others should strive to follow. I have been exited to share my Derby Box experience with everyone, in hopes of spreading the word about this wonderful company. Thank you for everything. I can't wait for KY Oaks/Derby 2018!! You are the place to call & will have my repeat business, as well as my recommendations to all. Sincerely, Christine McCracken Sunflower Studio Photography ”\n\n“I can't begin to tell you how much we enjoyed our DerbyBox experience! The entire week went off without a hitch! Our hotel, Courtyard Marriott, was in a fantastic location. We enjoyed being within walking distance of so many things. The horse farm tour was spectacular. The Kentucky Oaks and Derby were unforgettable experiences. We were greatly impressed with the efficiency of the shuttle service for both races. The pick up point was within easy walking distance of our hotel and that was marvelous! Our seats at Churchill Downs were excellent! Thank you for providing a once in a lifetime experience! We would also like to thank Chris, who helped us in the reservation stage! I would recommend DerbyBox to my friends, for sure! Our reservation was under the name of Janet Trexler. Thank you SO much! It was unforgettable! We loved Louisville and Lexington!”\n\n“Kelly - Just wanted to touch base with you on our Kentucky Derby Package Basically, all I can say is that you hit a HOME RUN ! Residence Inn was fantastic - The people there could not do enough to make us happy. The \"spread\" put out Thursday night was much more than we thought. The transportation worked out fine - Actually it was much better than we could have expected - Miller has it down as best as it can be done with the amount of people. Our seats for the Oaks and Derby were fine for us, especially with the tv screen being almost directly in front of us. I am hoping we can do this again next year so please let us know when you have the packages arranged. Again, thanks for everything ! ”\n\n“Just wanted to say how much we loved our hotel and the whole event. Seats (120) were a bit too low but in the end we had great companions around us and of course great weather. The connection to the clubhouse made all the difference from the last time we went as it was a breeze going to the ladies bathroom. And the ticket lineups were reasonable. I was worried about the bus but really had no problems going or coming back. Bus is the only way for me to get into the track. Seeing all those people walking to the stadium to their cars made me happy to be on that bus. DerbyBox can be trusted and will hope to use you again in the future. ”\n\n“I just wanted to take a moment and thank Derbybox.com for making our 2014 Kentucky Derby experience special. We purchased 4 seats in the Interior Premium Box section (and requested Row A) and we received exactly the tickets we asked for in the mail three weeks before the event. I must admit being quite nervous about paying big $$$ for these seats without getting the tickets immediately in hand, but you came through as promised. With all the problems being reported with Derby Deals, I'm very happy we went purchased our tickets through your company. I will highly recommend you to anyone planning on attending future Oaks/Derby races. ”\n\n“My wife and I really enjoyed the Derby the seats were great and after sitting in the boxes in 220 for the 3 years it was really wonderful being in the 300 level ; the other people who joined us in the box were wonderful and everyone had a great time.....Most of all your service was excellent as I told you on the phone this was a decision that we had to make at the last minute since my wife got permission from her Doctor to skip her Chemo treatment which was scheduled for Tuesday of Derby week......You were so helpful and got the tickets to us pronto.....Thank You again and again and God willing we will be calling you again next year...... ”\n\n“I just wanted to let you know how PLEASED I was with the tickets I ordered from your company for the Kentucky Derby. It was an awesome experience from ordering tickets to the actual BIG DAY. I believe the name of the representative I dealt w/ was Mary. She was extremely friendly and very helpful (and patient) on the phone with me, while I decided which tickets to order. 2 of the people I took had never been before and they were totally blown away. I plan on going with your company again, I would love to make the Derby a yearly event . Kudos to your company and your representatives. In today's world, good customer service is a rarity! Sincerely, ”\n\n“I don't know if you were the person who took my order, but I just wanted to say a big, belated thank you. The person that I dealt with was very nice and very accommodating (even though I kept losing the call on my cell phone). Also, I was very pleased with the Crowne Plaza hotel, and the tickets to the Derby were great-just as promised. It made my husband's birthday very special, and I would definitely use derbybox again and recommend it to others. Many thanks, ”\n\n“Thank you to all at Derby Box for making our trip to the Kentucky Derby so much fun. It was the perfect way to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. We had a really special time and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. We’ll definitely be back. Thanks also for sending through the photos. Attached are a couple of our own, including us at the winners party (thanks so much for the tickets) with the winning trainer Doug O’Neill and owner J. Paul Reddam. Sarah loves her hat by Chrissy and had many comments about how great it looked (including several people taking photos at CD). Thanks Chrissy! Thanks again and we hope to make it back next year. ”\n\n“I cannot thank you enough for our tickets to the 2012 Kentucky Derby. I was very nervous about using a ticket broker, and Derbybox.com exceeded our expectations. When the Clubhouse row we ordered (Row E) was not available, Chris offered us tickets under cover a few rows back. I explained to him that I was not interested in being under cover because we were bringing our 2 daughters, ages 6 and 11, to the Derby. I was concerned they wouldn’t be able to see over people’s heads if we were any farther back. Chris said he agreed with me, and would do his best to get us as close to the track as possible. Imagine my shock when our tickets arrived in the mail for Row A, on the rail! We all had the experience of a lifetime! As we continue to tell our friends about our magical day at the Derby, I tell everyone who will listen to buy their tickets from Derbybox.com. I originally started the purchase process for tickets with another local ticket broker, but after numerous unreturned phone calls and an attempted bait and switch on the price, I informed them that I no longer trusted them enough to proceed with the transaction. The staff at Derbybox always answered the phone and answered my questions immediately. We will be repeat customers! Thanks again! ”\n\n“Thank you both for a magical Oaks and Derby for my sister and our family. Our seats were fantastic and the days were wonderful. In her honor, since she will most likely not be here next year, we would like the same box, with all six seats for both days ... and parking passes. She was thrilled to be treated to this this year, and looked and felt like a princess. You have no idea what you did! ”\n\n“As you know this was one of the items on my Bucket List and I had the time of my Life. The Crowne Plaza had the place really decorated with roses in each room, music, a fantastic buffet and a staff that was so nice and helpful. When we arrived at the Derby the seats were good and the people in our section were all so nice and we made some really nice friends. Your assistance in attire was so helpful and it was a once inA lifetime experience, thank you for making a dream come true. ”\n\n“We purchased both Oaks and Derby tickets from Derbybox.com for the 2011 races. It was a difficult decision for me because I knew that when buying something sight unseen, 9 months in advance, you are relying on the integrity of the company to deliver what they say. There are no protections, credit card or otherwise to fall back on. There are a number of resellers out there but ultimately, I decided on Derbybox because you are local, have a good BBB rating, and I just got a good sense about you and your company. Our tickets came just as promised in mid-April, and we had a fabulous time at the Oaks--our seats were perfect and exactly as advertised. Then the problem came...we had an issue with our Derby tickets and my heart sank. I knew I had no leverage or power to do anything, so now it was time to rely on your reputation and integrity. I contacted you and you immediately rectified the situation. You didn't have to...you knew there was nothing I could do. But your integrity was as you promised on your website...you took care of us. I want to stress to whomever reads this that Derbybox.com is a business who truly values its customers. That doesn't happen much today. You can order your tickets no matter how far ahead, and know that Doug and his team will take care of you. ”\n\n“Thanks so much the GREAT service. Your business is unique, because no oneanswers the phone anymore, but you all do. I loved getting truly greattickets, but the best part was that when I found an error on the invoice, Icalled and MARY answered the phone at 7 pm EST. Who does that these days? No one! That is unprecedented, exceptional service. She was right on it immediately, and understood the need to check with Fed Ex on the address. It turned out that all was well, but if I did not have Mary to help roubleshoot the issue tonight, I'd have had a very sleepless night, for we all know this BCC is the race of the Century with Zenyattta at the helm. My good friend Diana Baker helped raise Quality Road at Spring Hill Farm. Her husband Chris runs the farm, and I am thrilled to have such excellenttickets to see QR challenge Zenyatta. They will both be running the race of their lives, and it is the last race for both. Whoever wins, it is evertheless a Race For the Ages. And I have great tickets for my friends inIllinois, who are driving to Churchill Downs Friday night. Again, thanks to Mary and yourself for providing excellent customer service. I am a customer for life, and I'll be calling you next spring for my DerbyTx. ”\n\n“Just a note to tell you how much I appreciated your excellent service during Derby weekend. I was apprehensive about booking such an expensive trip through a company I'd never dealt with before but you all did a wonderful job. The hotel was lovely and the tickets were great. Thanks so much to your staffers who suggested the box seats instead of the grandstand--that was definitely worth it. And thanks for your help with the shuttle information. I've recommended the weekend to several of my friends and suggested they use your company if they decide to attend. ”\n\n“I wanted to send a thank you for your assistance with our tickets for the 134 Derby. Your early assistance in steering me towards various events and ticket 999s was critical to our enjoyment for this special occasion and certainly helped to create a very memorable event and birthday celebration for my wife our guests. We found the Dawn at the Downs event to be well worth the visit and thoroughly enjoyed both the Oaks and Derby. Our seat were unreal from a location standpoint and given the Oaks weather allowed us to enjoy the full slate of races on Friday without concern. I will certainly recommend you to others who may ask and again want to thank you for making our first Derby experience so memorable. ”\n\n“I went last year. I took my dad. He said he would never get there. Just wanted to let you know that we made his dream come true. Your seats in section 112 were awesome. We were 3-rows off the rail and seen baffert, pletcher, and asmussen. I also met tom amoss. We got his autograph. Also got victor espinozas autograph. It was the best trip of our lives. Just thought you should know. ”\n\n“We had a great time at Keeneland! It was a first time for the three others I took up and they loved both the event and view from the seats. I can't thank you enough for the special attention extended to us in light of the tickets' delivery challenge. It's great to know there are still people who go beyond the expected for others. I see the tracking # below and it appears signed by one of employees in our other offices across the street. I'm guessing the FedEx delivery agent mistakenly delivered to the other building here on campus. Please let me know how I can work something out with you on the second set of tickets. We greatly appreciate your exceptional customer satisfaction and will be sharing your name here in Jacksonville, FL and with some of our work team in Louisville, KY.(P.S. - I'll be calling you in a couple months on Derby tickets.) ”\n\n“Doug, just a note to say THANK YOU. The clubhouse box seats (sec 118) you reserved for me for this years Derby were perfect. We were one box off the rail between the tunnel and the winners circle. Exactly where I wanted to be. How did you do it? We saw everything and best of all bet Giacomo to win after visiting his sire (Holy Bull) the day before the race. Needless to say, i'll be purchasing tickets from you for next years race. Thanks again for the great service. ”\n\n“We missed seeing you there. The Hummer was excellent; Matt was a fantasatic driver and alot of fun! The box for the Oaks was not a repeat, the Turf Club was very nice as we saw all the stars coming and going. Took alot of pics with them! Overall a great time. Thanks for all your help. The friends we ended up taking had never been so it was great to be where we were. Next time we want the Turf Terrace or the Matt Winn terrace? Is there such a thing, it may all be the Turf Terrace. We enjoyed the hospitality of all the Churchill Downs personnel. They were all very accommodating as so many people did not know where to go. Enjoy the pics. ”\n\n“Everything went absolutely beautifully for my parents, Doug, and thank you for following up! They enjoyed the Oaks very much, their tickets were perfect for them. I had sent them the parking info, with maps, etc. and they found the stadium with no problems, parked, and were immediately transported over the track. They loved the Derby -- all but the rain, of course! lol -- and were right across from the finish line in 1st floor Clubhouse, under cover. I had a Lincoln Town Car and driver pick them up for Derby day at their B&B, and take them to CD. Even had a brick dedicated to them in front of CD so their visit lives on... They were so very happy, and truly, I am grateful for your prompt service, answering all my questions and inquiries, and helping me to get the best tickets for them! ”"
