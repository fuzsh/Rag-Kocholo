        "meta_description": "Laffit A. Pincay, Jr. is a legendary jockey renowned for breaking thoroughbred racing records and being a strong finisher. He was once known as flat racing’s winningest jockey of all time with 9,530 career wins, and he still holds third place in most wins despite retiring two decades ago. Pincay surpassed the previous recordholder, Bill Shoemaker, on December 10th, 1999, with his 8,834th win at Hollywood Park aboard Irish Nip.  As a child, Pincay dreamed of becoming a professional baseball player, but his small stature meant that he would never go pro. His father was a jockey as well, and Pincay learned to ride by visiting the racetracks in Panama and Venezuela and watching his father compete. He began his riding career in his native Panama before drawing the attention of top horseman Fred W. Hooper and agent Camilo Marin, who sponsored him to come to the United States to ride under contract in 1966.  Pincay’s American career started with a bang at Arlington Park in Chicago where he won eight of his first 11 races. He primarily competed in the United States for 39 seasons, including 27 summers at Del Mar, and he became the first jockey to hit 9,000 career wins in the California Cup Distaff at Santa Anita on Chichim for trainer Juan Garcia. His illustrious career includes winning three consecutive Belmont Stakes races and one Kentucky Derby (aboard Swale in 1984), along with five Eclipse Awards for Outstanding Jockey. He was also the United States Champion Jockey by earnings for 7 years.  Pincay retired in April 2003 and remained horse racing's winningest jockey until Russell Blaze passed Pincay on the all-time win list with over 12,208 wins on December 1, 2006.",

        "text": "Pincay was able to become such a great rider due to his muscular physique and incredible discipline. Some jockeys are known for their finesse, but Pincay was known for his sheer power – there were many races where even though his horse seemed tired, he was able to help it push through and win with an amazing final burst of speed. A perfect example of this was when he won the 1985 Jersey Derby aboard Spend a Buck. Although he took an early lead, Pincay’s horse began to tire when they were almost at the wire and it looked like the win was going to slip away from him, but Pincay was determined to not let that happen and he carried the horse for the last quarter of the race to victory.\n\nPincay’s physical strength and strength of will earned him such nicknames as Atlas and Hercules from his fellow jockeys, with some describing him as “spartan.” He showed excellent self-discipline and determination from the beginning of his career, and he never failed to stick to his incredibly low-calorie diet (just 650 calories per day) and other healthy routines throughout his career. His love of horse riding and the camaraderie of his fellow jockeys made him keep racing for longer than many other jockeys.\n\nPincay married his first wife, Linda, in 1967 and had a daughter and a son, Lisa and Laffit III. Lisa is the mother to two of his grandchildren, Madelyn and Mason. His wife was loving and supportive but sadly committed suicide in January 1985. In 1992, he married Jeanine as his second wife. She birthed Jean Laffit Pincay. Laffit Pincay III is a horse racing commentator for HRTV and NBC who greatly admires his father. In October 2007, he was loaned to ESPN as the winner’s circle interviewer at the 2007 Breeders’ Cup at Monmouth Park. He currently resides in Arcadia, California.\n\nDark Days – Personal Tragedy\n\nSix months before Pincay’s win at the 1984 Kentucky Derby, his first wife Linda was diagnosed with a ruptured appendix and gangrene. The mix of emotional pain and depression prompted her to attempt suicide twice. On January 18, 1985, when Pincay was at Santa Anita prepping for the next race, he received a phone call and rushed home to find Linda dead. His 15-year-old daughter Lisa was in the house when her mother shot herself.\n\nHis career began to decline during the 1990s. In 1990 he won only 150 races for a full year of riding. In 1997, he won only 75 races and picked up $2.5 million in earnings, his lowest total since 1969.\n\nInjuries\n\nHe suffered 11 broken collarbones and 10 broken ribs over the course of his career. He also endured two spinal fractures, two punctured lungs, two broken thumbs, and a sprained ankle. His last injury in horse racing that forced him to retire was a broken neck. The doctors advised Pincay that his spine was not sufficiently stable to allow him to ride as the 2 cervical bones in his neck and one of the uppermost seven vertebrae of the spine were broken."
