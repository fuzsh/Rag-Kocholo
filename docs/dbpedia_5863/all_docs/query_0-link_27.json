He was the curator of the Patrick Husbands facebook site and had his own Facebook page that is filled with condolences.\n\nShepperton, a chestnut warrior.\n\nCanadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame photo\n\nSHEPPERTON HONOURED\n\n“One of the best Canadian-breds we have seen in many years’\n\nThe mighty weight carrier SHEPPERTON is the star tonight as the stakes race named in his honour is run again – it was inaugurated in 1976.\n\nTonight’s field is missing NOT BOURBON, who was expected to return to action but he has had another setback.\n\nHeading the field is DANCER’S BAJAN, who won the race last year for 3 Sons Racing and trainer Robert Tiller. He ran a 103 Beyer Figure in that win, the best of his career.\n\nBut hey, since Roger Attfield is winning almost everything in sight these days, why not take a stab on SAND COVE, the grey fellow who puts up a big fight all the time?\n\nMost wins by a jockey:\n\n* 7 – David Clark (1978, 1980, 1983, 1986, 1888, 1996, 2006)\n\nMost wins by a trainer:\n\n* 3 – Robert P. Tiller (1997, 2003, 2006)\n\nHall of Fame Inductee, 1976\n\nBio from Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame\n\n• When Shepperton won the Canadian Championship (later named the Canadian International Championship) on the half-mile track at Dufferin in the war years of 1942 and 1943, his total earnings from those two victories was just $5,202.\n\nShepperton was ridden by Bobby Watson in his Canadian Championship wins. The chestnut horse did not run in the Championship in 1944, but Shepperton was still turning in some impressive races. In the Bryan and O’Hara Memorial Handicap at Toronto’s Old Woodbine, he carried 138 pounds to victory in the 1 1/16 mile race in the track record time of 1:44 3/5. “He (Shepperton) went to the front without any special urging and won comfortably,” said the Thoroughbred Record. “This is probably the best Canadian-bred we have seen in many years.” He was a superb weight carrier, often winning while carrying up to 140 pounds.\n\nBred, trained and owned by Fred Schelke of Gormley, Ont., Shepperton was “the wonder horse” of his time. He was a confirmed cripple from birth but a great race horse nevertheless. Jockey Willie Holborn, who exercised him in his early trials and for nearly all his racing years, said he was the easiest horse to ride of any that he ever worked. “It was like sitting in a rocking chair and going for a pleasure ride,” he said. Injuries prevented Schelke from racing him as a 2-year-old and also knocked him out of the 1942 King’s Plate.\n\nIn 1944, as a 5-year-old, Shepperton won three of his five starts. But his best years were at three and four. In 1942, he won six races, was second seven times and third once in 17 starts and in 1943, he won nine of fourteen races and was out of the money only twice. He raced from 1942 to 1948, winning 22 of his 54 starts, finishing second eleven times and third five times. Besides his Canadian Championship wins and the Bryan and O’Hara Memorial, his important wins included the Breeders’ Stakes and Autumn Handicap in 1942 and the Jubilee Handicap in 1943.\n\nDON’S FOLLY (9) is a contender in tonight’s Shepperton Stakes.\n\nNorm Files photo.\n\nCANADIAN BREDS WINNING EVERYWHERE\n\nWhile Awesome Rhthym and Monty’s Best did not have any success against SOUL WARRIOR and MINE THAT BID in the West Virgnia Derby last Saturday, there were some locally bred horses who did well in other places.\n\nHow about the AUDRE CAPPUCCITTI bred CARDASHI, by Kiridashi – Honor Card, who won the Governor’s Cup at Penn National over the likes of Smart Enough?\n\nA $10,000 claim, the 7-year-old raced at Woodbine and Fort Erie briefly in 2005, won his maiden for $10,500 and then went off to Thistledown. He was scooped up by his current interests this year. He ran a career best 102 Beyer Figure in the turf win.\n\nEXCERPT Blood-Horse story:\n\nCardashi Pulls 29-1 Governor’s Cup Shocker\n\nBy Jason Shandler\n\nLocally-based claimer Cardashi scored a shocking 29-1 upset in the $200,000 Pennsylvania Governor’s Cup Handicap when he ran down pacesetter Blue Sailor in mid-stretch and went on to win by 1 1/2 lengths Aug. 1 on the Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course turf.\n\nRidden by David Cora, Cardashi was claimed by trainer Tim Kreiser for Mason Dixon Stable for just $10,000 in February. Since then, the 7-year-old gelded son of Kiridashi had won two turf sprints at Penn National, but they were in claiming and allowance company, nothing like the richest race in the racetrack’s history.\n\nCardashi completed five furlongs on the ‘yielding’ turf in :56.23 while making his stakes debut.\n\nBlue Sailor set the pace in the Governor’s Cup, sprinting out to a clear lead while running splits of :21.70 and :44.07 under Harry Vega. Sea Dubai tracked the leader in the early going, while Cardashi raced in third.\n\nCardashi loomed as the biggest threat to Blue Sailor at the eighth-pole, but still had a 2 1/2 lengths to make up on the leader. The bay gelding kept charging from the outside and finally surged to the front with a sixteenth remaining. Blue Sailor stayed on for second, a length better than third-place Chamberlain Bridge.\n\nCardashi, who was bred in Ontario by Audre Cappuccitti and is out of the Honor Grades mare Honor Card, is now 11-10-3 from 42 starts. His $120,000 first-place check pushed his earnings to $266,085.\n\nSHE’S WILD\n\nD’WILD RIDE, bred by Sophian Stables in Ontario, won the REGRET STAKES at Monmouth on Haskell day. The filly had just 2 rivals but was the 5 to 2 3rd choice and won by a neck. She is by D’Wildcat out of Summer Storm and is trained by Joe Orseno.\n\nD’WILD RIDE, a Candian bred stakes winner at Monmouth last weekend.\n\nVanessa Ng photo.\n\nWOODBINE SCOREBOARD – TRAINERS\n\n*It’s a tie!

When we turned for home, I went by the one horse that was inside of me and that was it. Nobody else was coming.”\n\nHilton’s Cherokee, rode by Alan Cutherbertson, broke into the lead along the rail and held it for a good portion of the race before fading down the back stretch.\n\nOnce Smuggler’s Hold blew past Hilton’s Cherokee, it was basically over.\n\nTease The Tiger finished second, while long-shot Celtic Thane was third in the 10-horse showdown.\n\nwww.winnipegsun.com/sports/othersports/2009/08/04/10352871-sun.html\n\nHASTINGS REPORT\n\nB.C. CUP DAY\n\nKRAZY KOFFEE WINS REDEKOP CLASSIC WHEN FAVOURED SPAGHETTI MOUSE SCRATCHED\n\nVancouver, B.C. (Aug. 3/09) — A resounding groan filled the air at Hastings Racecourse Monday afternoon when it was announced on post parade that favoured Spaghetti Mouse was declared a late scratch from the $100,000 Redekop BC Cup Classic.\n\nThe track veterinarian declared Spaghetti Mouse unfit to race, leaving the feature race of the day with five starters. Krazy Koffee, named Horse of the Year in 2008, held off Till the Storm to win the Classic by a half-length for owner Butch Goertzen and trainer Cindy Krasner, the winning combination of last year’s BC Derby that also includes jockey David Wilson. Krazy Koffee’s winning time over the 1 1/8 miles was 1:50.30.\n\n“When I heard Spaghetti Mouse had been scratched I wanted to go back to the paddock for instructions,” Wilson said from the winner’s circle. “Once I got him to relax, he was okay.” Spaghetti Mouse was looking to tie Artic Son as the only other three-time winner in the 15-year history of the Classic. Spaghetti Mouse won it in 2008 and 2006.\n\nOn a BC Cup Day when the favourites prevailed, Krazy Koffee paid $3.20, $2.30 and $2.10.\n\nThere were six other stakes races on the holiday card, all with $50,000 purses. Frank Fuentes rode Woombroom Express to victory in the Sprint. Huitziloplochtli won the Nursery by almost nine lengths with Fernando Perez in the irons.\n\nFavourite Tierra Del Feugo easily won the Dogwood with Pedro Alvarado gaining the lead on the backstretch and cruising home to a six-length victory.\n\nAgainst the Sky was favoured in the Distaff and didn’t disappoint her backers with Fuentes winning his second stakes of the afternoon.\n\nVying Ty Grr won the Debutante wire-to-wire under Richard Hamel.\n\nBC CUP RESULTS\n\ncourtesy Thoroughbred Daily News:\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA CUP NURSERY S., $50,597, HST,\n\n8-3, (R), 2yo, c/g, 6 1/2f, 1:16 4/5, ft.\n\n1.

Added owner Robert Vargo: “He closed like we wanted him to. It looks like (we’ll nominate to the Canadian Derby) if everything looks good.”\n\nTease The Tiger closed five lengths in the stretch drive to finish second – three-quarters of a length behind – winning Minnesota invader Smuggler’s Hold at Assiniboia Downs. According to one racing insider, Smuggler’s Hold will nominate to the Canadian Derby, which is Aug. 22 at Northlands Park. “No doubt about it,” he remarked. Smuggler’s Hold has raced at six different tracks since December 2008."
