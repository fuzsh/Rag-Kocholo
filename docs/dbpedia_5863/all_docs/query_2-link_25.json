        "text": "Blinkers Off\n\nDon’t Listen to Wise Guys (Unless They’re Right)\n\nWe now have reached the point — as we do at each Kentucky Derby — when like the groundhog, the wise guys emerge from hibernation to tout a horse they have chosen as their own.\n\nLast of the Cajun Jockeys\n\nIt is hard to believe that on Saturday when they go to the post for America’s signature race, the Kentucky Derby, there only will be two Cajun riders in the irons.\n\nFrom Seabiscuit to Blind Vanity\n\nDerby fever gets its name from what is clearly America’s horse race, but it doesn’t just live within the borders of Churchill Downs.\n\nThundering Home\n\nGary Stevens was alone in Hong Kong and an ocean away; all the jocks he knew were thinking about their Derby horses.\n\nThe Bittersweet Derby Dreams of Sunny’s Halo\n\nIt is a magnificent story of courage and perseverance. Would that its post script could be as happy.\n\nAgua Caliente and the First Derby Future Book\n\nChurchill didn’t get into the futures business until 1999, more than four decades after the greatest innovator of them all showed the way.\n\nAll Those Carry Backs\n\nIf Jack Price hadn’t worked for himself, we never would have had a colt like Carry Back.\n\nCanonero II: He Came from Caracas\n\nThis Saturday, we will honor the 40th anniversary of a Kentucky Derby moment so rare, so bizarre you couldnâ€™t make it up if you tried.\n\nLost and Found: The Life and Death of Isaac Murphy\n\nHere was a jock who rode with his hands and his heels and his heart; the soft crooning of his voice was a siren’s song to the mounts beneath him.\n\nGreat Redeemer, the Knife at the Gunfight\n\nWhen Grover “Buddy” Delp, who trained Spectacular Bid, heard the details unfolding, he said “Well, there are 999 ways to lose the Derby. Maybe we just found another.”"
