        "text": "Hi. I am knew to the Forum, but will take the liberty to sugest a topic: How about histories of confirmed cases of kills in aerial combats involving Known aces? I mean, cases in which a US ace shootdown a German ace, for example. I wonder how many well documented cases of this happening there are…\n\nI will start it off , which two tales extracted from Osprey´s \"Japanese Air Force Aces\":\n\n1 - On 19 March 1945 the 16 kills Japanese ace Stg. Yokio Shimokawa was flying a Ki-84 \"Frank' over Hiroshima and claimed two Hellcats . Latter in the same mission he was in return shoot down himself by a Hellcat from VF-17 flown by 6 kills ace Lt. Tilman E Pool. The Japanese ace managed to bail out and survived the war.\n\n2 – On 10 April 1942 3rd AVG Flt Ltr Robert T Smith ( 8 kills), flying a P-40C ,destroyed the Ki-43 \"Oscar\" piloted by Major Yohei Hinoki (12 kills) over Loiwing , China. Curiously, after barely surviving a hard crash landing, Hinoki would 'tangle' a second time with an american ace. On 27 November 1943, again flying a Oscar, his aircraft was severely damaged over Burma, by fire from the 530TH FS P-51A flown by Lt. Robert F Mulhollem ( 5 kills). Hinoki lost a leg in this incident, but managed to bring his shot up plane back to base. He survived the war. To even the score a bit, let me tell you that Hinoki is the pilot credited with downing Col. Harry R Melton´s A-36A over Burma, 25 november, 1943. Melton was the commander of the 311th Fighter-Bomb group, and was captured after parachuting.\n\nWell, that is it from now. Anyone interested in following it up?\n\nBest regards\n\nLegend says Ralph Hofer was shot down by Erich Hartmann, but since \"The Kidd\" went down over Hungary and Jg-52 was flying over Romania at the time, I don't really buy it, though Hofer was in fact the only 8th AAF ace to go down in a2a combat and not to ground fire.\n\nI also don't buy it for the simple overly-coincidental aspect of two young aces both called \"The Kid\" (well, \"Bubi\", but its the German equivalent) meeting in the air and fighting to the death. Plus I think the story would have made it into one of Hartmanns autobiographies, not just confined to books on the 4th.\n\nAfter April 19th, 1942, Major Marian Pisarek received command of the 1st Polish Fighter Wing (303rd, 316th, and 317th Squadrons). Ten days later, the wing had a fighter sweep in the Hardelot-Desrves-Marck area. Over Le Treport (other sources say Le Touquet or Bologne) the wing was surprised by an attack by 15 FW 190's. This strike hit the 317th Squadron. They lost, unfortunately, the Squadron Leader; Capt. Piotr Ozyra, and Wing Commander Major Marian Pisarek. The Germans, after rapidly attacking, disengaged from the battle. 303rd Squdron simply did not manage to enter into this combat. Pisarek was probably shot down by the famous German ace, Commander of the II/JG 26, Htpm. Joachim Muncheberg , or Obfw. H. Hoffman from the 4./JG 26.\n\nMajor Pisarek is ranked in 7th position on the list of best Polish aces, with a record of 12 confirmed, 1 probable, and 2 demaged enemy aircraft.\n\nSource:WW II ACE STORIES\n\nThere used to be the story that Masajiro \"Mike\" Kawato shot down Pappy Boyington but this claim was eventually disproven though Kawato held to his story until his death.\n\nThere are several German Experten and Assen who were shot down in 1943/1944 by American escort fighter pilots but can't come up with one right now...\n\nWasn't one of the Galland Brothers shot down by Hub Zemke's Wolf Pack on a the outbound leg of the second Schwienfort Raid. The 56th flew into Germany, turned around and came in on it's escort run from the East instead of the West, where the German Fighters expected them. Galland (not Adolf, another brother) was in command of a gaggle of 190s and thought the 56th was just more fighters coming in.\n\nSomebody got him. Not saying hit was Hub but it was probably a section lead as he went down on the first pass.\n\nAugust 17, 1943 - ....the bombers now had to fight their way back through the same country they just struggled through, and the Luftwaffe pilots had enough time to refuel, rearm and refresh. The bombers were expecting P-47 escort cover to resume once they managed to reach Eupen. The First task force got their cover 10 mintes before they reached Eupen and the P-47s proceeded to fend off attacks from JG 26. Three stafflen of Fw 190s from II./JG 26 engaged the bombers over Lutych. Obfw. Adolf \"Addi\" Glunz of 4./JG 26 destroyed two of the B-17s northwest of Diest. As the Focke-Wulfs attacked, they in turn were bounced by P-47 Thunderbolts from the escort force of the USAAF 56th FG. Major Wilhelm-Ferdinand \"Wutz\" Galland, Gruppenkommandeur of II./JG 26, was shot down and killed in a crash near Maastricht. His final score was fifty-five kills including eight 4 engined bombers and 37 Spitfires. His place as Gruppenkommandeur was taken by Hptm. Hans Naumann.....\n\nAugust 17, 1943 - ....the bombers now had to fight their way back through the same country they just struggled through, and the Luftwaffe pilots had enough time to refuel, rearm and refresh.

Did it say who got him?\n\nWait, found it.....\n\nAces of the Luftwaffe - Wilhelm-Ferdinand Galland\n\n\"On 17 August 1943, at 16:52, three Staffeln from II./JG 26 took off from Lille-Nord, under the command of Major Galland, to intercept a formation of USAAF four-engine bombers on their return course from a bombing raid on Schweinfurt. Over Lutych, the unit encountered a formation of 150 to 200 bombers, escorted by nearly 200 escort fighters. II./JG 26 bounced the bombers but were, in turn, attacked by a unit of P-47 fighters from the 56th Fighter Group, USAAF. Their fire crippled the FW 190 A-5 (W.Nr. 530 125) <<+- flown by \"Wutz\" Galland which crashed at high speed near Liegne, 5 km west of Maastricht. The impact left a large crater in the ground from which it was impossible to remove all the wreckage. Some sources suggest that \"Wutz\" Galland was shot down by the American ace Walker \"Bud\" Mahurin (24.25 confirmed, 4 probable and 2 damaged victories) of the 56th Fighter Group, USAAF.\"\n\nThere ya go.\n\nSorry for so many quick posts but also found these from the same website...\n\n\"On 7 September 1942, Stahlschmidt was part of a Schwarm that had taken off on a freie Jagd. Southeast of El Alamein they came under attack by RAF Spitfires. Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt failed to return in his Bf 109 F-4 (W.Nr. 8704) \"Red 4\". It is possible he was the victim of the American ace John Curry (7.333 confirmed, 2 probable and 3 damaged victories) flying with 601 Sqn, RAF.\"\n\n\"...On 13 May 1941, von Kageneck shot down Flight Lieutenant Innes Westmacott (3.75 destroyed, 1 probable and 1.333 damaged victories) of 185 Sqn, RAF, who baled out wounded. He shot down Pilot Officer Claud \"Hamish\" Hamilton (6 victories) of 185 Sqn, RAF on 14 May. Hamilton died of his wounds a short time later....On 24 December 1941, von Kageneck was critically wounded in combat with RAF fighters south of Agedabia. Although he managed to return to base, he died of his wounds in a Naples hospital on 12 January 1942. Some sources indicate that his victor was the Australian ace Clive Caldwell (28.5 confirmed, 6 probable and 15 damaged victories) of 250 Squadron RAF.\""
