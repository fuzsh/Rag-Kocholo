This list is more entertainment than science, so take it with a pinch of salt. One of the main differences in aerial battle score is that German pilots (as well as Japanese) kept flying and gaining experience until they were killed themselves, while successful Allied pilots where “rewarded” by sending them home where they took over the training of young pilots and passing their skills and experience over to them. So the list with top kills is actually extremely dominated by Nazi German fighter aces, with the top Allied pilot being Lev Shestakov with 66 kills ranks as 231. So the top 230 fighter pilot aces are ALL axis power pilots. Below the top 30 fighter aces of WWII, so you get an idea of the German scores.\n\nThe most remarkable Fighter Aces\n\nHowever, we try to create the list of most remarkable fighter aces not solely based on kills, but also on fame, influence, and value the factor that it matters at what time one was active (WWI vs WWII).\n\n1. Erich “Bubi” Hartmann\n\nErich Hartmann is the most successful fighter pilot of all times – with 352 kills. A number that will never be surpassed. His nickname “Bubi” means “little boy” – and it’s easy to find out why he was called like that. He was also called “The black devil”. Hartmann flew a Messerschmitt Bf 109.\n\nHartmann flew a total of 1404 missions and wasn’t not only never shot down in this huge number of aerial battles, but he also never lost a wingman.\n\nHe was active as a flight teacher for the West German Luftwaffe after the War. Later on, he became a civilian flight instructor.\n\nHere is the last interview with Erich “Bubi” Hartmann in 1993 – it shows what an interesting personality Hartmann had.\n\n2. The Red Baron\n\nThe so-called “Red Baron” – Manfred von Richthofen – is probably the best-known fighter pilot in general. Red Baron is a household name, even for non-aviation fans. The Red Baron scored 80 kills in WWI – with his Fokker Dr.I. triplane. Wonder where his name is coming from? His three-winged Fokker was painted in bright red – so he would scare the shit out of his enemies once they spotted him. He trained and flew with a unit called “The Flying Circus” – by far the most feared by Allied forces. The Red Baron was finally shot and injured, but still managed to land his plane before he died.\n\n3. Douglas Bader\n\nThe British fighter ace Douglas Bader might surprise you a bit so high up this list. What is so remarkable about Bader? After all, he has only 20 aerial kills, along with 4 shared, 11 damaged and a probable. But Bader lost his legs when he crashed a plane in his earlier aviation career, 8 years before WWII. And he achieved all this kills later on, despite having no legs, before the Germans shot him down and captured him in 1941. Luckily, he was so respected that the Germans asked for his prosthesis to be sent over from the UK\n\n4. Adolf Galland\n\nGerman fighter ace Adolf Galland is not even in the top 30 list above. So why is he here? His achievement and battlefield bravery were so outstanding that he was promoted general after 104 aerial victories – and therefore banned from the flying service before he turned 30. Adolf Galland flew a total of 705 combat missions. As opposed to Erich Hartmann, Galland was shot done several times as he took a great risk. Galland was known for his fairness, he refused to shoot at pilots parachuting out of their planes once he hit them.\n\n5. Hans-Joachim Marseille\n\nMarseille was nicknamed “Star of Africa” thanks to his aerial battles at the North African campaign. Marseille was a Bohème and often stayed out at night so long that he wasn’t allowed to fly the next day. As a result, he was sent a unit heading to Africa. Only there, under his new commander, they (and he himself) discovered his huge talent – and he quickly developed his abilities and became a real ace. Hans-Joachim Marseille flew the Messerschmitt Bf 109 during his entire career and shot down the most Western Allied aircraft: 158 official kills. On September 1st 1942 alone, Marseille shot down 17 Allied aircraft.\n\nMarseille died at only 22 years old – when he had to leave his Messerschmitt after an engine failure, and hit the vertical stabiliser.\n\n6. Chuck Yeager\n\nThe American Yeager was “Ace in a Day” – despite two of the planes actually had a mid-air collision after Yeager went into shooting position behind them. A total of 11.5 scores, this outstanding pilots kills include the first air-to-air victory over a jet fighter, a German Messerschmitt Me-262 (the first jet-to-jet kill was in the Korean War, by a MiG-15). But the main reason he is so famous is that he was the first human to break the sound barrier in 1947, in a Bell X-1. Yeager is still alive and recently broke the sound barrier again, in an F-15, to mark the 65th anniversary of the first supersonic flight.\n\n7. Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer\n\nSchnaufer, nicknamed “Spook of Sint-Truiden“ makes the list for being the highest scoring night fighter ace in history. Sint-Truiden or St. Trond was the place where Schnaufer was based – in occupied Belgium. All his 121 aerial victories are at night, most of them against large British four-engine bombers. Schnaufer started to score not before 1942 – before he was in training and then in support of the breakout of German ships from Brest. Schnaufers crew was so successful that every member got the Knight’s Cross.\n\n8. Ernst Udet\n\nUdet is the top German fighter Ace who survived WWI – with 62 confirmed victories. He was also the second highest overall ace – right after the Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen. Udet flew together with the Red Baron in his famous “Flying Circus”. After the War he was an aircraft manufacturer, playboy and stunt pilot before joining the Nazis in 1933. He had an important role in building up the Luftwaffe – but finally ended tragically with alcoholism and finally suicide, during WWII.\n\n9. René Fonck\n\nThe French René Fonck was the Top Allied fighter ace in WWI and also he scored the most Allied kills in WWI and WWII combined. So he holds the title “All time Allied Ace of Aces”. The official, confirmed number is 75 kills. Fonck was known as anti-social and 72 out of his 75 are solo kills. Fonck himself claimed not less than 142 kills – but even by his friends, Fonck was considered a braggart and shameless self-promoter. He seemed to overcompensate his shyness by constantly mentioning his (exaggerated) kills – which annoyed anyone around him. The actual number of Fonck’s kills might be somewhere in between the official 75 and his claimed 142.\n\n10. Adolphe Pégoud\n\nThe French Adolphe Pégoud makes the list as the first flying ace in history with a total of six aerial combat kills, and for being the first pilot who made a loop. The loop is an aerobatics manoeuvre very popular when doing MiGFlug flights with customers. Tragically, he was shot down by a German pilot who learned to fly with Pégoud during his time as an aviation instructor – before WWI started.\n\n11. Edward ‘Mick’ Mannock\n\nThe Irish-born Edward ‘Mick’ Mannock was not only known for being one of the best fighter aces of WWI, but also for his legendary hatred of the Germans and his delight of seeing them burn to death. He joined the Royal Flying Corps and became a flying ace during WWI. He scored at least 61 victories, but didn’t care too much about it and didn’t even count them. Mannock was one of the world’s first theorists of aviation tactics. Over time, he had many phobias, including brning to death himself – which he finally did after flying too low and being exposed to ground fire.\n\n12. James Doolittle\n\nDoolittle is known for the “Dolittle Raid” (aka Tokyo Raid) in WWII. The Dolittle Raid was an air raid on Tokyo. It was to strike back after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, but also the first attack on mainland Japan – an important psychological raid – to show the Japanese that they could be attacked. Doolittle organized the strike, known from the Movie “Pearl Harbour”. It was an important US propaganda victory – even though Doolittle himself saw it as a failure because of the losses.\n\n13. Anatoly Kvochur\n\nWe already write a recent blog post about The Russian fighter pilot Anatoly Kvochur. Kvochur is widely recognized as one of the best Russian fighter pilots ever, and for his stunning airshow performances including incredible low-level flying. In 1989, he had to eject from his MiG-29 Fulcrum in Paris after a bird strike – steering the Fulcrum away from the crowd and getting off the plane just seconds before impact. That’s heroism. Kvochur is currently the Deputy Chief of the Gromov Flight Research Institute – where MiGFlug offered flights in Su-27 Flanker, MiG-25 Foxbat and MiG-29 Fulcrum – see here.\n\n14. Robin Olds\n\nRobin Olds was a triple ace, with a total of 16 victories in WWII and the Vietnam War. Olds is widely seen as the best wing commander in the Vietnam War – for his reputation of being a brilliant combat leader as well as for his air fighting skills. Olds was often at odds with the leadership, and his career was slowed down by his heavy drinking as well as his maverick views: “There are pilots and there are pilots; with the good ones, it is inborn. You can’t teach it. If you are a fighter pilot, you have to be willing to take risks.” Olds was a popular person and married to Hollywood actress Ella Raines – he was also well known for his trademark “bullet-proof moustache” that was often copied by other pilots.\n\nWho else should be on this list?\n\nNow it is your turn – we presented outstanding fighter pilots – for different reasons.
