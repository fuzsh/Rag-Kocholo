        "text": "1 July 1942\n\nMont-Joli\n\nPMR75-632 – 130 Squadron, Mont-Joli, Quebec, 1 July 1942\n\nPeople are still remembering…\n\nNotes\n\nCommanding Officer Jacques Chevrier is posing for posterity on July 1st, 1942. He is fifth from the left. He died five days later on July 6, 1942. Seventy-nine years later, minus five days, how Wing Commander Chevrier died is still a mystery…\n\nLinks\n\nhttps://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/canadian-virtual-war-memorial/detail/2622524\n\nhttps://sadp.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/jmsl-17-09-09-6-des-aviateurs.pdf\n\n(in French)\n\nhttp://www.bbm.org.uk/airmen/Chevrier.htm\n\nJoseph Armand Jacques Chevrier was born in St. Lambert, Quebec, Canada on 7th October 1917. He joined the RCAF on 4th July 1938, travelled to England in 1940 and was posted to No. 1 Squadron at Wittering on 3rd October, moving to No. 1 (RCAF) Squadron at Prestwick on the 21st. Chevrier was repatriated to Canada on 9th January 1941.\n\nHe was appointed ADC to His Excellency the Governor-General, the Earl of Athlone on 8th August and served in that capacity until 31st March 1942. Chevrier was then posted to be the first CO of 130 Squadron, taking command at Mont-Joli, Quebec on 1st May 1942.\n\nOn 6th July 1942 the squadron was scrambled to search for U-boats after a freighter was torpedoed 10 miles off Ste. Anne-des-Monts. Four Kittyhawks were launched. Several survivors of the sunk ship were located, but no U-boat. Chevrier ran out of fuel on the return to Mont-Joli, and died when his Kittyhawk AK915 ditched in the St. Lawrence just off Ste. Anne-des-Monts.\n\nHis body was not recovered and he is commemorated on the Ottawa Memorial.\n\nIn 1952, his father was still asking questions about how his son had died…\n\nI found more information on the Internet…\n\nhttps://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/205495\n\nMore on the Battle of the St. Lawrence here…\n\nhttps://www.veterans.gc.ca/pdf/publications/canada-remembers/RS_Battle_Gulf_e.pdf\n\nThe official story seems to be this…\n\nChevrier ran out of fuel on the return to Mont-Joli, and died when his Kittyhawk AK915 ditched in the St. Lawrence just off Ste. Anne-des-Monts.\n\nHopefully, how he died will one day be known when parts of the Kittyhawk he flew on July 6, 1942, will be found.\n\nUntil then, people are still remembering Wing Commander Jacques Chevrier in Mont-Joli…\n\nHe never stood a chance…\n\nhttp://www.luftwaffe.cz/gallandw.html\n\nWilhelm-Ferdinand “Wutz” Galland\n\nExcerpt\n\nWilhelm-Ferdinand “Wutz” Galland was born on 23 October 1914 at Bochum. He enlisted in the Luftwaffe in 1935 serving with a flak regiment. Galland participated in the invasion of the Low Countries and France with a flak regiment before volunteering for flight training at the end of 1940. He competed operational training with Ergänzungsgruppe/JG 26 and reported to II./JG 26 on 27 June 1941. JG 26 was under command of his brother Adolf Galland (104 victories, RK-Br). His younger brother Paul Galland (17 victories, killed in action 31 October 1942) was also serving with the unit. Assigned to 6./JG 26, “Wutz” scored his first victory on 23 July 1941, shooting down a RAF Spitfire fighter near Hesdin. By the end of 1941 his victory total had climbed to three. On 5 May 1942, Galland was appointed Staffelkapitän of 5./JG 26. He had eight victories to his credit. On 2 June, he claimed two Spitfires shot down over the Somme Estuary to record his ninth and 10th victories. Galland recorded his 20th victory on 4 December when he shot down another Spitfire near Boulogne. His score had risen to 21 by the end of 1942. Hauptmann Galland was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of II./JG 26 on 3 January 1943. On 13 January he claimed a Spitfire shot down, but, it was, in fact, a 6th Staffel Bf 109G-4 piloted by Unteroffizier Johann Irlinger. The mistaken identification of the Messerschmitt for a Spitfire cost Irlinger his life. The incident was cleaned up for the official records… On 28 January, Galland received the Deutsches Kreuz in Gold for 24 victories. He recorded his 30th victory on 15 February, when he shot down a Spitfire near Ramsgate. Galland was awarded the Ritterkreuz on 18 May 1943 for 35 victories.\n\nGodfrey Alan McKoy was his 24th victory.\n\nI met the kid on the left, but not the one on the right.\n\nAllan Todd had his picture taken with Neil Hammond. It did not take long to find him on the CVWM Website. He was the only Hammond who died in 1943.\n\nLeading Aircraftman\n\nRichard Neiland Hammond\n\nRoyal Canadian Air Force\n\n22nd September 1943, aged 20\n\nBeechwood Cemetery\n\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRichard Neiland Hammond was born August 8, 1923, on the family dairy farm in Ironside, a village in West Hull that was then four miles north of Hull’s city limits. His parents were Watson and Jane (Barber) Hammond. Neiland, as his family called him, attended the local elementary school and then Hull Intermediate for high school. When he was a child both parents died- his mother in 1930 and father 1935. The farm was then managed by two uncles, who hired housekeepers so that Neiland, his sister and two brothers could stay on the family property.\n\nA short time after finishing high school, Neiland started work at the Electric Reduction Plant in Buckingham, Quebec, but gave up this job to enlist in the RCAF in 1942. He went to Belleville Training School, and then on to elementary flying at Pendleton, Ontario (east of Ottawa). After his graduation from Pendleton, he came back to Uplands (Ottawa) for his service flying training. Here he had to learn to fly the Harvard, a powerful, heavy, single-engine aircraft. On the night of September 22,1943, he was assigned to practice night take-off and landing at a relief field near Carp, Ontario, the present site of Carp Airport. During take-off something went wrong, and he crashed into nearby bush. The authorities listed the cause as “obscure.”\n\nLeft to mourn were his girlfriend Frances Copping, his sister Jean and brother-in-law William Brisenden, brother James and sister-in-law Mabel (who still live in Chelsea), and brother Felton. Jim Hammond recalls that the news of Neiland’s death was delivered to him on the family farm at Ironside on the night that his wife Mabel was in labour for the birth of their first child, Barbara.\n\nNeiland was doing well on the course and would have graduated in a few weeks. He is buried in Beechwood Cemetery’s Veterans Section.\n\nSource: http://www.gvhs.ca/publications/utga-chelsea-cenotaph.html\n\nI had never heard about Sid before finding his name in a logbook and on the back of a picture.\n\nThis is what you will find on Airforce.ca about Sid Seid.\n\nMosquito Fighter/Fighter-Bomber Units of World War 2 (page 58)\n\nMartin W.
