        "text": "Most Aussies here will be familiar with the Jackson brothers who flew with the RAAF in WWII. Their story fascinates me because both would become aces and also serve in the same squadron!\n\nJohn Jackson was born in 1908 and was a member of the Citizen's Air Force before the war. After war was declared he was called up and commissioned to PO in 1939. In December 1940 he was posted to 3 sqn in the middle East where he flew Gladiators and then Hurricanes. During the Libyan Campaign he shot down 3 Ju 87's whilst flying Hurricanes. The sqn then converted to Tomahawks where he shot down a Potez 63 and a Dewoitine 520 during the Syrian Campaign. John received a DFC and was sent back to Australia where he took command of the newly formed 75 sqn flying P-40's.\n\nLes Jackson was born in 1917 and was John's younger brother. Les joined the RAAF in 1939 and was commisioned to PO in 1940. He was first posted to 12sqn, then 23sqn followed by 21sqn in Malaya. Les was posted back to Australia when war against Japan had started. In March 1942 Les was posted to 75 sqn under the command of John when the unit deployed to Port Moresby in New Guinea.\n\nThe day after 75sqn arrived, John led an attack on Lae airfield where the P-40's destroyed 12 a/c and damaged 5 more. On the 24th of March, Les scored his first kill when he shot down a Zero over port Moresby. On April the 4th, John was shot down by AA fire and ditched onto a coral reef, he was dropped a life jacket by his brother Les. Eventually John made it back to safety. The next day Les shot down his second Zero. On the 10th John was again shot down and ditched. He swam back to shore and made it through the jungle to reach Moresby during an air raid where a Japanese bullet took off the tip of his right index finger.\n\nOn the 17th Les claimed his third Zero followed by a fourth on the 18th. On the 28th tragidy struck when John Jackson, CO of 75 sqn was shot down and killed. John's replacement as CO was none other than his brother Les.\n\nAfter 44 days of intense action, 75sqn, which was the only allied fighter squadron in New Guinea was sent back to Australia with 1 servicable P-40. Under Les's command the sqn reformed and went back to New Guinea in August to take part in the historic Battle Of Milne Bay. On the 27th of August Les shot down his fifth zero becoming an ace himself. The next day he crash landed and made it back to base on foot three days later. After the battle of Milne Bay, Les was awarded the DFC. During 1943 he was in command of 78 (P-40) wing until the end of 1944. Early in '45 he received a bar to his DFC and was made CFI of 8 OTU before taking Command of Air Defence HQ.\n\nJohn Jackson is credited with 8 possibly 9 kills and Jackson Airport in Port Moresby is named in his honour, while Les is credited with 5 destroyed enemy aircraft. Truely a remarkable story IMO of two gallent brothers. Does anyone know of any other brothers that became aces?"
