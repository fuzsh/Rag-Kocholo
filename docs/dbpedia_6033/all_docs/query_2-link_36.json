        "text": "İngilizce - İngilizce\n\nadolf teriminin İngilizce İngilizce sözlükte anlamı\n\nA male given name, a rare spelling variant of Adolph. Very rarely given to children after World War Two, because of the association with Adolf Hitler\n\nBaeyer Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Eichmann Karl Adolf Galland Adolf Joseph Ferdinand Gustav II Adolf Gustav IV Adolf Oscar Gustaf Adolf Hitler Adolf Krebs Sir Hans Adolf Loos Adolf Meyer Adolf Nordenskiöld Nils Adolf Erik Frihere baron Reinhardt Adolf Frederick Carl Adolf von Sydow\n\n{i} male first name\n\ngiven name, male, from Germanic\n\nİlgili Terimler\n\nAdolf Hitler\n\nthe leader of the Nazi Party in Germany from 1921. He was born in Austria and was the 'Führer' (=leader) of Germany from the mid-1930s until his death. He allowed no opposition, and attempted to establish a pure race of German people through a policy of anti-semitism, as a result of which millions of Jewish people were killed in concentration camps. He started World War II by ordering his armies to enter Poland in 1939, and killed himself in 1945, just before Germany lost the war. His name is now sometimes used to describe someone who uses their authority in a cruel or unfair way, or someone who wants to control everything (1889-1945). born Apr. 20, 1899, Braunau am Inn, Austria died Apr. 30, 1945, Berlin, Ger. Dictator of Nazi Germany (1933-45). Born in Austria, he had little success as an artist in Vienna before moving to Munich in 1913. As a soldier in the German army in World War I, he was wounded and gassed. After the war, resentful about defeat and the peace terms, he joined the German Workers' Party in Munich (1919). In 1920 he became head of propaganda for the renamed National Socialists, or Nazi Party, and in 1921 party leader. He set out to create a mass movement, using unrelenting propaganda. The party's rapid growth climaxed in the Beer Hall Putsch (1923), for which he served nine months in prison; there he started to write his virulent autobiography, Mein Kampf. Regarding inequality between races as part of the natural order, he exalted the \"Aryan race\" while propounding anti-Semitism, anticommunism, and extreme German nationalism. The economic slump of 1929 renewed his power. In the Reichstag elections of 1930 the Nazis became the country's second largest party, and in 1932 the largest. Hitler ran for president in 1932 and lost, but he entered into intrigues to gain legitimate power, and in 1933 Paul von Hindenburg invited him to be chancellor. Adopting the title of Führer (\"Leader\"), he gained dictatorial powers by the Enabling Act and suppressed opposition with assistance from Heinrich Himmler and Joseph Goebbels. Hitler also began to enact anti-Jewish measures, hich culminated in the Holocaust. His aggressive foreign policy led to the signing of the Munich agreement. He became allied with Benito Mussolini in the Rome-Berlin Axis. The German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact (1939) enabled him to invade Poland, precipitating World War II. After early successes in the war, he often ignored his generals and met dissent with ruthlessness. As defeat grew imminent in 1945, he married Eva Braun in an underground bunker in Berlin, and the next day they committed suicide\n\nAdolf Bastian\n\n{i} (1826-1905) German anthropologist\n\nAdolf Eichmann\n\n{i} (1906-1962) high-ranking member of the Nazi regime in Germany during World War II (executed for his crimes against humanity)\n\nAdolf Eichmann\n\nan Austrian Nazi who, during World War II, was one of the main people responsible for sending Jewish people to concentration camps, where millions of them died. After the war he escaped, but he was finally caught,found guilty of war crimes, and executed in 1962 (1906-62). born March 19, 1906, Solingen, Ger. died May 31, 1962, Tel Aviv, Israel German Nazi official. In 1932 he joined the Nazi Party and became a member of Heinrich Himmler's SS organization. In World War II he organized the identification, assembly, and transportation of Jews to Auschwitz and other death camps. In 1945 he was captured by U.S. troops but escaped and eventually settled in Argentina. In 1960 he was arrested near Buenos Aires and taken to Israel, where he was tried as a war criminal, with huge worldwide publicity, and hanged for his part in the Holocaust\n\nAdolf Erik Frihere Nordenskiöld\n\nborn Nov. 18, 1832, Helsinki, Fin. died Aug. 12, 1901, Dalbyö, Swed.

He led several expeditions to the Arctic island of Spitsbergen between 1864 and 1873, and in 1870 he led an expedition to western Greenland. In 1878-79, on the steam vessel Vega, he sailed from Norway to Alaska on the first expedition to successfully navigate the Northeast Passage. He was created a baron on his return. In 1883 he became the first to break through the great sea ice barrier of the southeast Greenland coast\n\nAdolf Frederick Reinhardt\n\nborn Dec. 24, 1913, Buffalo, N.Y., U.S. died Aug. 30, 1967, New York, N.Y. U.S. painter. He studied art after graduating from Columbia University. He employed several abstract styles in the 1930s and '40s, but by the early 1950s he had restricted his works to monochrome paintings incorporating symmetrically placed squares and oblong shapes against backgrounds of similar colour, in which drawing, line, brushwork, texture, light, and most other visual elements were suppressed. He explained his style as a conscious search for an art that would be entirely separate from life. He influenced the Minimalist movement of the 1960s, more as a polemicist than as a painter\n\nAdolf Galland\n\nborn March 19, 1912, Westerholt, near Recklinghausen, Ger. died Feb. 9, 1996, Oberwinter German fighter ace. A skillful glider pilot by age 20, he flew hundreds of missions in the Spanish Civil War.

Educated in Dresden, Ger., he practiced in Vienna, though he spent extended periods in the U.S. and Paris. Opposed to both Art Nouveau and Beaux-Arts historicism, he announced as early as 1898 his intention to avoid the use of unnecessary ornament. His Steiner House in Vienna (1910) has been referred to by some architectural historians as the first completely modern dwelling; the main (rear) facade is a symmetrical, skillfully balanced composition of rectangles. His essays from this period, denouncing ornament and decoration, were equally influential. His best-known large structure is the Goldman and Salatsch Building in Vienna (1910), in which small amounts of Classical detail are offset by large areas of blank, polished marble. His work strongly influenced European Modernist architects after World War I\n\nAdolf Meyer\n\nborn Sept. 13, 1866, Niederweningen, Switz. died March 17, 1950, Baltimore, Md., U.S. Swiss-born U.S. psychiatrist. He immigrated to the U.S. in 1892 and taught principally at Johns Hopkins University (1910-41). He developed a concept of human behaviour ergasiology, or psychobiology that sought to integrate psychological and biological study. Meyer emphasized accurate case histories, suggested a role of childhood sexual feelings in mental problems in the years preceding wide recognition of Sigmund Freud's theories, and decided that mental illness results essentially from personality dysfunction rather than brain pathology. He became aware of the importance of social environment in mental disorders, and his wife interviewed patients' families in what is considered the first psychiatric social work\n\nAdolf von Baeyer\n\nborn Oct. 31, 1835, Berlin, Prussia died Aug. 20, 1917, Starnberg, near Munich, Ger. German research chemist. He synthesized indigo and formulated its structure, discovered the phthalein dyes, and investigated such chemical families as the polyacetylenes, oxonium salts, and uric-acid derivatives (discovering barbituric acid, parent compound of the barbiturates). He also made contributions to theoretical chemistry. He received the Nobel Prize in 1905\n\nadolf hitler\n\nHitler: German Nazi dictator during World War II (1889-1945)\n\nGustav II Adolf\n\nLatin Gustavus Adolphus born Dec. 9, 1594, Stockholm, Swed. died Nov. 6, 1632, Lützen, Saxony King of Sweden (1611-32) who made Sweden a major European power. The son of Charles IX, Gustav inherited his father's dynastic quarrels with Sigismund III Vasa and until 1629 faced a legitimist invasion from Poland. He ended the war with Denmark in 1613, but Sweden was forced to pay a crushing war indemnity. He ended the war with Russia (1617) and annexed Ingria and Kexholm. Internal tensions were largely resolved by his trusted chancellor, Axel Gustafsson Oxenstierna. Gustav's sweeping domestic reforms included establishing an efficient central administration and improving education. Resuming the war with Sigismund in 1621, Gustav obtained much of Polish Livonia (Latvia and Estonia). He saw his Polish campaigns as part of the struggle of Protestantism against the Counter-Reformation. He entered the Thirty Years' War in 1630 as a defensive maneuver, to secure the Swedish state and church from danger. An outstanding military tactician, he led an army of unusual quality, and his position was strengthened by alliances with France, Brandenburg, and Saxony. Success in the Battle of Breitenfeld let him sweep through central Germany and claim large territorial cessions, particularly Pomerania (1631). At Lützen in 1632, the Swedes defeated Albrecht W.E. von Wallenstein's army, but Gustav was killed in battle\n\nGustav IV Adolf\n\nborn Nov. 1, 1778, Stockholm, Swed. died Feb. 7, 1837, Sankt Gallen, Switz. King of Sweden (1800-09). Son of the assassinated Gustav III, he came to the throne in 1792 under the regency of his uncle Charles, duke of Södermanland (later Charles XIII). In 1805 Gustav brought Sweden into the European coalition against Napoleon. When Russia joined with France in 1807, Gustav remained in the field, though he knew it would mean a Russian attack on Finland. Denmark-Norway also declared war on Sweden, causing the loss of additional territory. In 1809 Gustav was overthrown in a coup, and his heirs were declared ineligible to succeed him. He and his family left Sweden for exile, settling in Switzerland\n\nHans Adolf Krebs\n\n{i} (1900-1981), German-born English biochemist after whom the Krebs cycle was named, winner of the 1953 Nobel Prize\n\nJohann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer\n\nborn Oct. 31, 1835, Berlin, Prussia died Aug. 20, 1917, Starnberg, near Munich, Ger.
