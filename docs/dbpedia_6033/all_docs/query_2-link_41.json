        "text": "AviationArtPrints.com has probably the largest range of aircraft art prints available anywhere in the world. As part of the Cranston Fine Arts group we have full access to huge range of prints which are not available from any other dealer. In addition to publishing hundreds of our own aviation art prints, in recent years we have bought over the entire back catalogue of aviation art prints of Nicolas Trudgian and Gerald Coulson from their publisher, as well as the prints of several other aviation artists. Because of this, we can offer you these now very sought after aviation art prints with great discounts.\n\nWhat makes AviationArtPrints.com different to other online aviation art sellers?\n\nWe take pride in commissioning a number of aviation artists to produce new original paintings on a regular basis. While other websites offer some of the same prints we stock, many do not commission any original artwork of their own, and are in effect drop-shipping the products as middlemen. We have supported the production of original artwork for over 25 years.\n\nAt AviationArtPrints.com, a large percentage of our stock is not available anywhere else. Not only is this due to us publishing our own prints from the art we commission, but also due to our buying power, which has allowed us to buy up thousands of prints from other publishers and artists. Most notably of our recent acquisitions was the entire collection of Nicolas Trudgian prints, which now almost invariably can no longer be found anywhere else.\n\nWe are also committed to exploring new areas of aviation art - we don't just do Spitfires and Lancasters! While 'classic' images are of course part of our inventory of stock, in recent years we have commissioned artwork depicting wide and varied types of aircraft, from early WW1 aircraft like the Otto Pusher to post-war test planes like the TSR-2. In fact, at the time of writing, there are over 370 different aircraft types in our art database, with 8500 products in our massive online shop.\n\nAs you browse our site, we think you will agree we have the largest selection of aviation artwork online. We have made our website extremely easy to browse, with easy to use menus to find any aircraft, squadron or aviation artist, and we have even integrated our signature database of over 2000 pilots and aircrew into our menus. In our experience, you will rarely find anything other than a mention of who has signed a print on other websites. We have collated all the information we can gather about the signatures on each print and provided this as part of our website - you can click a name and be taken to a list of all the artwork they have signed. If you collect signatures on your artwork, or just want to know more about any of the signatures on aviation art, you will not find a better resource on the internet than this website."
