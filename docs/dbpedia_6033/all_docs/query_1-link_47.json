        "text": "Wec58 wrote:\n\n> I purchased a Hasagawa MiG 17 today and was informed it was Toon's aircraft.\n\n> The kit says it was Nguyen Van Bay's aircraft.\n\nToon (Tomb) appears to be a fictional pilot...nobody seems to know how it got\n\nstarted. The VPAF don't have an Ace by either name since neither is a Vietnamese\n\nname.\n\n> To further complicate things I\n\n> went to a web site...and says it's Toon's.\n\nIt would appear that site is in error.\n\n> The number on\n\n> the aircraft is red 3020 and shows 7 kill markings. That would match Van Bay's\n\n> number of kills but is below Toon's approximately 13 kills.\n\nThe VPAF does NOT list any pilot with 13 kills, Nguyen Van Coc is listed as their\n\nhighest scorer with 9 (which includes two Firebee Drones).\n\n> To further\n\n> complicate things the picture shows Driscoll and Cunningham's aircraft\n\n> following this MiG and I found another source which claims that Driscoll and\n\n> Cunningham battled with Toon (I'm not sure if they succeeded in downing him).\n\nOn 10 May 1972, Cunningham and Driscoll became the first US Aces, when they downed\n\nnumbers 3,4, and 5. Their last kill was against a very wiley MiG-17 driver. This\n\ngave rise to the claim they had downed Col Tomb, but the VPAF did not have any\n\nColonels flying fighters, nor anybody named Toon (Tomb). Cunningham and Driscoll\n\nwere later damaged by an SA-2, lost all hydraulics (Phantom flight controls are\n\nhydraulic) and Duke managed to get \"feet wet\" prior to them ejecting.\n\nHow's the kit, is it the old Hasegawa/Minicraft mold (silver)?\n\nRobey\n\nWhen you see the item on F-4Js 'strafing' pilots in chutes, the credibility of\n\nthe source is established.\n\nThe MiG-17 article is an extract of what is in the new VPAF history from\n\nSquadron. Both are near verbatim translations of the \"official\" history of the\n\nVPAF, and as such are somewhat circumspect.\n\nThe VPAF is still playing games with \"who's who\", although we now know a lot\n\nmore about who shot who on 10 May 1972. Cunningham and Driscoll's 5th Kill was\n\na pilot named Nguyen Van Tho, who is listed in one account as buying then and\n\nthere, and in another as bailing out. Tho was a 17 driver from the original\n\nbatch of 31, so that does match up.\n\nI have since found out that Dose/McDevitt's kill was not the model for \"Tomb\"\n\n-- Dang Ngoc Ngu -- but his wingman, an unfortunate soul named Ngai who did not\n\nsurvive the crash. Ngu DID claim Dose's element leader as a kil though, but\n\nanyone who read the classic Ethell/Price \"One Day in a Long War\" knows that one\n\n\"won't fly\" (pun intended!)\n\nNgu bought it on 8 July 1972 when shot down by a (?Talos?) from one of the\n\ncruisers, which I am pretty sure was the USS Chicago.\n\nThe whole \"Tomb\" business comes from idiots who did not read Vietnamese and saw\n\nsome of the classified reports using Vietnamese telegraphics at the time, and\n\nscrewed it up. Even Jack Anderson wrote him up in a 1971 column and tried to\n\ncorrect the spelling to TOONS but could not get people to believe it.\n\nCookie Sewell\n\nAMPS\n\nPS a complete history of the Vietnamese Air War with a comparison of \"who shot\n\nJohn\" reports and assessments is being written, but not by the fellow who\n\n\"wrote\" the VPAF book for Squadron.\n\nGeoff Murphy wrote:\n\n> I confess I don't know what might thoughts go through mans mind while flying\n\n> combat in a dogfight scenario.\n\nI have no combat experience...\n\n> However, common sense might not be one of those.\n\nHmmm, from my very limited peace-time experience...it's all training, logical\n\ntraining.My AF predecessors in vietnam, did not have the benefit of ACM and\n\nDACT. Their BFM skills were weaker than their bombing skills. The naval guys had\n\nbetter air-to-air skills.\n\n> It does seem the revenge factor could be very strong when you see a\n\n> \"buddy\" going down in flames after a sneak attack from the rear as the\n\n> Vietnamese pilots were famous for doing.\n\nSorry, I respectfully submit that is Bullsh*t! As a guy that spent 10 years in\n\nthat profession (1979-89) I've never even heard hints of that kind of behavior.\n\nThat would NOT be tolerated. Obviously Cookie Sewell might have heard something\n\nelse...but I sincerely doubt it. You're speculating about something I have a\n\npretty good handle on, IMO.\n\n> The chance to put a few 20 mm rounds through the culprit might be too much to\n\n> resist.\n\nNah...it's the machine you're after, NOT the pilot. Sure if I could put my 20mm\n\ninto the cockpit with him still there fine, but once a guy is hanging in his\n\nchute he becomes \"hors de combat\" (or some similar sounding french phrase). You\n\ngo to Leavenworth for shooting at pilot/WSO in a parachute. No excuses!\n\n> War can have a profound effect on the most civilized person.\n\nIndeed, but most aviators I know are pretty well grounded. An unobserved entry\n\nby a bandit is something we were trained to anticipate, and not get pissed at\n\nthe MiG guy that was smart enough to get there.\n\nSorry for the soapbox mode, and nothing personal is intended. Obviously I have\n\npretty strong feelings about this topic.\n\nRobey\n\n\n\nUSN SEA F-4's /could/ have guns and in the 'first war' (there were\n\nactually two ya' know...) they often did. HiPEG Mk.4s on the centerline\n\nI think. USAF 4C/D had the SUU-23 Vulcan and F-8's carried quad\n\nMk.12's All in spraying around 4-6K spm and every one in 20mm so you'd\n\ndefinitely 'know you've been hit' (along about the time Peter is sizing\n\nyour halo on the brim machine)... Also far better sights and\n\npowered-precise controls.\n\nIn _/Horrido!/_, there are mentioned 'several' accounts of -jet- pilots\n\nbeing strafed after landing because they were such a menace. One was a\n\npersonal-by-survivor I could look up if you want.\n\nIn the end it comes down to this:\n\n1. If he's over his territory think about it. For prior mentioned\n\nreasons. Tactical opposition reduction to own-treatment\n\nlikelihood if shot down. Remember, they can kill you AFTER you\n\nland too.\n\n2. If you're in a multibandit/SAM environment with friends as well as\n\nyourself potentially endangered by independent head-hunting -don't-,\n\never.\n\n3. If he's over YOUR territory, there is no excuse; it's murder.\n\n4. One's after-mission Aggression should be modified by the likelihood\n\nof war-loss in your nation's immediate future ('War Crimes' etc.)\n\nand also the activities of your fellows. If they're all doing it\n\nthen you'll likely die if shot down anyway so you might as well add\n\nto the attrition effect and hope to make it a shorter war.\n\nIMO, 'cockpit kills' accounted for about 60-70% of the 'airframe kills'\n\nanyway, be it via a shattered canopy and .50 ball/HEI bouncing around\n\nthe cockpit, or the last roller coaster ride as anonymous freegyros in\n\nat 10-20G with a wing blown off, or the compressibles dig-for-China\n\napproach.\n\nI also believe 'luck' serves those who naturally have it and those who\n\ntry really hard to amass it and wouldn't want to be giving myself\n\nnegative Moja points blasting helpless-other guys knowing I could be in\n\ntheir place some day. Totally illogical in the singular selective\n\ninstance (chances of my being seen during-murder or recognized as a\n\nprior criminal) but never the less 'true' as a total-mimicked behaviour\n\nrepresented throughout the Forces.\n\nI /don't/ imagine either the German or Viet citizenry were terribly\n\nthrilled at being bombed and THEY are the over-zealous-wannabe-heros who\n\nare the really dangerous party. Many times the Germans did not treat\n\nTHEIR OWN GUYS terribly well 'recovering' them from the fields.\n\nIt takes a lot of sticking to die by rusty pitchfork and the\n\nluck-honor-Geneva factor is minimal.\n\nBTW: whoever said that POW's were 'propoganda tools' obviously never\n\nread the statistic about the 'at least 55 of those who died' in Hanoi's\n\ntender hands did so via their captors caring touch. Don't feel bad, the\n\nSenators and Congressman who had previously threatened to turn NV into a\n\ndesert if they hurt a single one of our people apparently were suffering\n\nfrom temp-deafness as well.\n\nKP\n\nIn article <35B8AFD1...@mindspring.com> Art Murray <amu...@mindspring.com> writes:\n\n>Michael Benolkin wrote:\n\n>> I have been aware of the tales of Colonel Toon.
