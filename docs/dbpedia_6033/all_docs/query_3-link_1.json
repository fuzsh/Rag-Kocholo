        "text": "Wilhelm-Ferdinand \"Wutz\" Galland (born 23 October 1914 in Bochum – killed in action 17 August 1943) was a German Luftwaffe fighter ace and recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. He is credited with 55 aerial victories in achieved in 186 combat missions. All his victories were claimed over the Western Front and included seven four-engine bombers and 37 Supermarine Spitfires.\n\nWilhelm-Ferdinand Galland was one of four Galland brothers to serve in the Luftwaffe. The oldest brother Fritz Galland served in a fighter and reconnaissance unit and survived the war. His older brother, Lt. Gen. Adolf Galland was one the most renowned German fighter pilots and leader of German fighter operations and also survived the war. His youngest brother Paul Galland, a flying ace with 17 victories, served with JG 26 and was killed in action on 31 October 1942.\n\nGalland scored his first victory on 23 July 1941, shooting down a Spitfire near Hesdin. By the end of 1941 his victory total was three. On 5 May 1942 Galland was promoted to Staffelkapitän of 5./JG 26, with eight victories at the time. His score was 21 by the end of 1942. Hpt. Galland was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of II./JG 26 in January 1943. Galland was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in May 1943 for 35 victories.\n\nGalland was killed in action on 17 August 1943 during the Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission. II./JG 26 took off on a bomber intercept mission and engaged the B-17 bomber formation but were bounced by the escorting P-47 fighters from the 56th Fighter Group, USAAF. It is assumed that Galland was shot down by the American ace Walker \"Bud\" Mahurin of the 56th Fighter Group, USAAF.\n\nAwards[]\n\nEhrenpokal der Luftwaffe (12 October 1942)[1]\n\nGerman Cross in Gold (28 January 1943)\n\nIron Cross (1939) 2nd and 1st class\n\nKnight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 18 May 1943 as Hauptmann and Gruppenkommandeur of the II./JG 26 \"Schlageter\"[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n[]"
