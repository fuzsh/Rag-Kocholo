        "text": "Rob Arndt\n\nAdolf\n\nLoading Image...\n\nLoading Image...\n\nAdolf Galland is probably the most known Luftwaffe pilot of WWII. Not\n\nbecause of number of his kills, but special kind of charisma , a\n\ncharacteristic for all great aces. He was the youngest general grade\n\nofficer of either side in World War II, and at age 29, he was more\n\ncompetent in aerial combat, strategy and tactics than many of the\n\nexperts nearly twice his age. As a fighter pilot he was credited with\n\n104 aerial victories. He was also famous for making a lot of\n\nmodifications to his Bf 109 fighters. He enhanced their fire power,\n\ninstalled better pilot armour and, a cockpit cigar lighter!\n\nHe was born in Westerholt, a small village in Westphalia on 19 March\n\n1912. His father was an administrator of private lands and properties.\n\nAdolf was the second son, after Fritz. His younger brothers were\n\nWilhelm and Paul. These two younger brothers followed Adolf into the\n\nLuftwaffe fighter forces. However they were not as lucky in combat.\n\nPaul (17 victories) was killed on 31 October 1943, mistakenly shot\n\ndown by another pilot of JG26. Wilhelm (54 victories, Knight's Cross)\n\nwas shot down a year later. Since childhood Adolf Galland was\n\nfascinated by aviation. He started building model aircraft when he was\n\n12 years old. When he was 16, he began glider flights. In 1933 Galland\n\nrealized a dream when he received his first pilot's license. During\n\ntraining in 1935, he crashed in a Focke-Wulf Fw-44 biplane and he was\n\nin a coma for three days. He had serious skull fractures, a broken\n\nnose, and a partially blinded left eye from glass fragments. His\n\ncommander, Major Rheitel, an aviator from the First World War,\n\nassisted him during his recovery and getting back into flying. He\n\nreturned to air duty, but a year later he crashed again, this time on\n\nArado Ar-68. Galland again spent a lot of time in the hospital.\n\nIn 1937 he volunteered to go with a group of German pilots for service\n\nin the Spanish Civil War. In this group were other future aces like\n\nHannes Trautloft, Wilhelm Balthasar, Günther Lützow, Eduard Neumann\n\nand Hajo Herrmann. They arrived in El Ferrol on 7 May 1937. Galland\n\nbecame a squadron leader in the Legion Fighter Group, equipped with\n\nHeinkel He-51 biplane fighters. Lützow led a squadron of the newest\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109Bs. Galland entered action over Brunete in July\n\n1937. He flew over 300 missions as a leader and he was awarded the\n\nSpanish Cross in Gold with Diamonds, only awarded 12 times in Spanish\n\nhistory. In 1938 he returned to Germany. Having great experience, was\n\nordered to begin the organization of Luftwaffe ground attack units.\n\nAt the beginning of WW II, Galland flew in Poland in the Henschel Hs\n\n123, until October 1, 1939, performing ground attack missions and\n\nproving the dive-bombing concept. For his efforts Galland was awarded\n\nby Iron Cross. Next, he was assigned to JG 27, commanded by Oberst Max\n\nIbel. During the French campaign Adolf Galland scored his first kills\n\non 12 May 1940, when he went with Gustav Rödel on a mission. Galland\n\nshot down two \"Hurricanes\" from 87th Squadron in two sorties. He had\n\n12 victories by 9 June 1940.\n\nWhen \"Battle of Britain\" started, Galland was assigned to JG26\n\nSchlageter as Gruppenkommandeur of III/JG26. His debut in that unit\n\nwas very successful: he shot down two fighters on his first mission.\n\nOn 18 July 1940, he was promoted to Major and a month later (on 22\n\nAugust) he received the Ritterkreuz (Knights Cross) after his 17th\n\nvictory. During the \"Battle of Britain\" his score increased rapidly,\n\nand on 25 September he was decorated with the Oak Leaves (for 40\n\nkills) by Hitler. Galland also succeeded Gotthard Handrick as\n\nKommodore of JG26. On 1 November 1940, he scored his 50th victory and\n\nwas promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel). One month later\n\nhe became a full colonel.\n\nGalland experienced being shot down himself on 21 June 1941, when JG26\n\nwas stationed at Pas de Calais. The Germans attacked Bristol\n\n\"Blenheim\" bombers and Galland downed two of them. However, some\n\nescorting \"Spitfires\" shot up his plane. He was forced to belly-land\n\nin a field. This same day, after lunch, he went on his next sortie. On\n\nthat mission he shot down his number 70, but when following the\n\nburning \"Spitfire\", he was bounced and shot up badly. His plane caught\n\nfire, and he was wounded. He tried to bail out, but the canopy was\n\njammed. After a dramatic struggle with the canopy, he was able to bail\n\nout at the last moment. His parachute opened just as he hit the\n\nground. He was bleeding from his head and arm and he had damaged his\n\nankle on landing. On 2 July 1941 Galland again was in trouble, but\n\nthat is another story. Please check the text: Adolf Galland and the\n\ndramatic air combat July of 1941. On 9 August 1941 Galland 'welcomed'\n\nthe famous Douglas Bader, who was just shot down by JG26 fighters.\n\nAt the end of 1941 Galland become General der Jagdflieger (\"commander\n\nof fighter forces\"), and went to Berlin. Gerhard Schoepfel became\n\nKommodore of Galland's beloved JG26. On 28 January 1942, Hitler\n\nawarded him again, this time with the Brillanten (Diamonds). Galland\n\nstill was at the rank of Colonel, but in 1942 he was promoted to\n\nGeneral, then General Leutnant. He was enthusiastic about the new jet\n\nfighter project, and he gave great support to the Me 262 program.\n\nHowever, the protracted development time and Hitler's idea to turn the\n\naircraft into a bomber \"Schwalbe\" slowed the entrance of this\n\nrevolutionary fighter by a year.\n\nIn January of 1945 Galland and other officers (Lützow, Johannes,\n\nSteinhoff) had a notorious confrontation with Göring over the\n\nperformance and future of the Fighter Arm. Galland was removed from\n\nhis position and even arrested and threatened with a court-martial.\n\nEventually he was allowed to organize a special jet unit using the Me\n\n262. He created Jagdverband 44 a unit with most experienced pilots.\n\nHis 'recruiting' officer, Steinhoff, traveled to all of the major\n\nbases, selecting pilots who wanted join to new adventure. Some very\n\nfamous pilots joined over a period of weeks: Gerhard Barkhorn, Walter\n\nKrupinski, Heinz Bär , Erich Hohagen, Günther Lützow, Wilhelm Herget.\n\nThe newly organized unit flew several missions with varying success.\n\nSome aircraft used the anti-bomber R4M rockets. During his first\n\nattack with rockets Galland, with Walter Krupinski as a wingman,\n\nattacked a group of American B-26 \"Marauders\". Galland's rocket attack\n\nknocked down two of them.\n\nIn his last aerial combat in WWII, Adolf Galland took off on 26 April\n\n1945. During an attack against Marauders his rockets would not fire,\n\nso he had use the 30 mm cannons. His Me 262 was hit by return fire\n\nfrom a rear gunner. The Allied bomber withstood Galland's fire. When\n\nGalland turned to finish the bomber, he was surprised by a P-47D flown\n\nby James Finnegan. Shells from the P-47's eight 12,7 mm guns destroyed\n\nGalland's instrument panel, shattered the jet's canopy, and struck his\n\nright knee. With his plane losing power and in great pain, Galland\n\nreturned to his base, arriving just at the moment when a strafing\n\nattack by enemy fighters was underway. He successfully landed and\n\nescaped the wreck of his Me 262, avoiding the fire of the straffing\n\nattackers.\n\nAfter war Galland was invited by Juan Perón to help build Argentinian\n\nAir Forces. Here he established a training and operations school,\n\ndeveloped tactical training program. In 1955 he returned to Germany.\n\nAdolf Galland, a holder of the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords\n\nand Diamonds, died in 1996.\n\nWilhelm-Ferdinand\n\nLoading Image...\n\nWilhelm-Ferdinand Galland is probably the best example that sometimes\n\naeronautics become a family's bussines. His elder brother was the\n\nreputed ace and General of the Fighter Forces of Germany, Adolf\n\n\"Dolfo\" Galland (104 victories along WW2), and his younger brother\n\nPaul also became ace (17 kills). Originally the young Wilhelm was\n\nrecruited to serve in the flak regiments (1935), but when the war\n\nbegan in 1939 he volunteered for flying training in the\n\nErgänzungsgruppe./JG 26. When he completed the training in 1941, he\n\nimmediatelly reported for active duty in the II./JG 26 on June 27. At\n\nthis time the whole JG 26 was leaded by his elder brother Adolf, so he\n\nwas anxious for getting a reputation of his own, for showing that he\n\nwas more than only the younger brother of the already famous \"Dolfo\".\n\nOn July 23 1941 \"Wutz\" began to gain such reputation when he knocked\n\nout a British Spitfire at the NW of Hesdin. By the end of the year, he\n\nalready had three Spitfire kills in his scoreboard.\n\nThose were happy times for the Luftwaffe units in the Channel Front,\n\nas is clearly shown by the figures of losses reported for both sides:\n\nBetween June 13 and December 31 1941, the RAF lost over 600 aircraft\n\n(including fighters and bombers) in air combat and 411 airmen KIA or\n\nPOW, while the Luftwaffe's actual losses in the air in that same\n\nperiod of time were only 135 aircraft, a kill ratio of 4:1 in favour\n\nof the Germans. It is also interesting to note that the Hurricane and\n\nSpitfire pilots at that time claimed 731 aerial victories, so they had\n\na huge overclaiming ratio of 82 % !!!\n\nAssigned to the 6./JG 26, \"Wutz\"'s personal tally began to increase\n\nfast when the JG 26 was re-equipped with the outstanding Focke-Wulf Fw\n\n190A-1 in early 1942. On April 10 1942 Wilhelm Galland finally became\n\nan ace when blasted out of the sky his fifth victim: one Spitfire Mk.V\n\nof the No.340 Sqn RAF over Etaples. The command abilities of Wilhelm\n\ndid not remain unnoticed, and he became Staffelkapitän of the 5./JG 26\n\non May 5. That same day he scored his 8th kill, another Spitfire (No.\n\n41 Sqn RAF). On June 2 1942 flew magnificently his Fw 190 when bagged\n\ntwo Spitfires (victories Nos.9-10), and repeated such success on July\n\n31 when he piled up other two Spitfires into his scoreboard in less\n\nthan a minute (Nos.12-13). During the period February - July 1942 the\n\nExperten of the JG 2 and JG 26 shot down at least 335 aircraft of the\n\nRAF, while losing only 84 Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and Bf 109Fs.\n\nOn August 19 1942 the RAF launched Operation \"Jubilee\", the air\n\nsupport to the assault against the portuary city of Dieppe. The JG 2\n\n\"Richthoffen\" and JG 26 \"Schlageter\" (about 20 squadrons) faced the\n\nwhole No.11 Group of the RAF with 48 squadrons of fighters and fighter-\n\nbombers. Despite being out-numbered, the German pilots beaten up their\n\nBritish adversaries, claiming 96 aerial victories that day, and it is\n\nhighly likely that all the German claims are confirmed, because the\n\nRAF admitts the loss of 103 aircraft that day, including 88 Spitfires.\n\nAgainst such carnage, the Luftwaffe lost only 21 fighters and 14\n\npilots. Many German Experten increased their respective tallies that\n\nday, for example Joseph \"Sepp\" Würmheller (he shot down 7 Spitfires\n\nand 1 Blenheim bomber), Egon Mayer (1 Hurricane and 1 Spitfire),\n\nSiegfried Schnell (5 Spitfires), Wilhelm Roth (one Spitfire) and Adolf\n\nGlunz (one Spitfire too). Wilhelm Galland wasn't the exception,\n\nbecause he destroyed one Spitfire in the afternoon (17:55 hs) N of\n\nDieppe.\n\nLoading Image...\n\nFew days later (August 27) the 5./JG 26 intercepted the raid \"Circus\n\n208\", consisting in 12 Bostons escorted by Spitfires of the No.350 Sqn\n\n(Belgian), and Wilhelm Galland shot down the Spit of H. Picard (POW),\n\nhis 15th kill. \"Wutz\" suffered a hard strike on October 31 when his\n\nyounger brother Paul was killed in action, but such tragic personal\n\nloss only reinforced his determination, and by the end of 1942, his\n\ntally rised to 21 kills (all Spitfires).\n\nOn January 3 1943 Wilhelm-Ferdinand Galland was promoted to the rank\n\nof Hauptmann and took command of II./JG 26, and exactly one month\n\nlater (February 3 1943) achieved his greatest succeses: that day\n\n\"Wutz\" leaded 40 Fw 190A-5 to intercepte 12 British two-engines\n\nbombers Ventura of the No.21 Sqn RAF escorted by Supermarine Spitfires\n\nof the No.64, 122 and 308 Sqns, which went to attack Courtrai-\n\nWevelghem airfield. At 11:05 hs Galland sent downwards in flames the\n\nVentura flown by Sgt G. K. Moodley, and only seven minutes later he\n\nblasted one Spitfire of the No.308 Sqn out of the sky (probably the\n\none piloted by Fg Off J. Wiejsky). Besides, because of his excellent\n\nleadership, his men literally thrashed the escort when shot down other\n\ntwo Polish Spitfires and forced the pilot of a fourth one (Lt. Tadeusz\n\nKoc) to bail out over the waters of the Channel. During another\n\nVentura raid in the afternoon, the Fw 190s of the I./JG 2 and II./JG\n\n26 engaged one of the escorting squadrons, the No.416 of the Royal\n\nCanadian Air Force, and again the Experten of \"Wutz\" Galland beaten\n\nthem up: three Spitfires were shot down in few minutes, one of them by\n\nWilhelm (probably the Spitfire flown by Fg Off J. S. McKenty). A\n\nfourth Spitfire flown by Fg Off Rainville ditched in the waters of the\n\nChannel, Rainville was rescued safe and sound. So, that day the\n\nLuftwaffe shot down eight Spitfires and one Ventura (two Spitfires and\n\nthe Ventura by Galland himself), and lost only one Fw 190. Ten days\n\nlater \"Wutz\" added two more marks to the rudder of his personal Fw\n\n190A-5 WNr 530125, when in only 3 minutes (10:17-10:20 hs) bagged a\n\nSpitfire of the No.340 Sqn and a second one of the No.485 Sqn (his\n\nvictories Nos.28-29), scoring his 30th kill on February 15 (another\n\nSpitfire).\n\nHowever, despite the Experten of the JG 2 and JG 26 were at the top of\n\ntheir skills, they were engaging more frequently a new adversary: the\n\n8th Air Force of the USAAF, with its fighter wings equipped with P-47s\n\nand the bomber wings equipped with the four-engine B-17s and B-24s. So\n\nfar, the two German fighter wings had been fully capables to keep the\n\nAxis' air superiority over Northern France and to beat up the RAF, but\n\nthe massive arrival of this new contendor threatened with neutralize\n\nthe German advantage. \"Wutz\" faced that new threat for the very first\n\ntime in the afternoon on March 8, when he shot down an USAAF B-24 of\n\nthe 44th BG over Totes.\n\nHis next battle against the \"Vërmoten\" (the German nickname for the\n\nfour-engine bombers) happened on April 4, when he leaded the II./JG 26\n\nto intercepte the enemy bombers and the escort near Fécamp. In first\n\nplace shot down one of the escorting Spitfires, and later riddled two\n\nB-17s which went down in flames. On the next day the victim of his\n\nlethal Fw 190 was a B-17 of the 384th BG, which was wiped out near\n\nAntwerp. April was a good month for \"Wutz\": besides the already\n\nmentioned victories, he blasted out of the sky one Typhoon of No.56\n\nSqn on the 17th and two Venturas of the No.21 Sqn on April 21 1943.\n\nAfter a well deserved rest, on May 18 \"Wutz\" was awarded with the\n\nRitterkreuz (Knight's Cross) and promoted to the rank of Major.\n\nIronically, when Wilhelm had his finest moments as a fighter pilot,\n\nthe Luftwaffe was begining to be overwhelmed by the crushing numerical\n\nsuperiority of the Western Allies. In May 1943 the JG 2 and JG 26 lost\n\n91 fighters, and other 53 were seriously damaged; but the worse was\n\nthat one Gruppenkommandeur and 15 Staffelkapitänen were killed in\n\naction. Germany simply just could not replace such losses of\n\nexperienced pilots. Even worse, the Western Allies were not only\n\ngrowing in strenght with the arrival of more and more USAAF squadrons,\n\nbut also their pilots were gaining combat experience, closing the gap\n\nof skills with the German Experten.\n\nAnyway, the Luftwaffe was still able to cause a tremendous defeat to\n\nthe American 8th Air Force on June 26 1943: that day 250 B-17 Flying\n\nFortresses attacked Villacoublay airfield escorted by 300 fighters\n\n(RAF Spitfires and Typhoons, and P-47s of the 56th FG). At 17:45 hs\n\nthe Fw 190s of the JG 2 leaded by Major Egon Mayer met the B-17s over\n\nLiseaux and flamed five of them in few minutes with head-on attacks.\n\nAn hour later, the Fw 190A-5s of the II./JG 26 caught by surprise the\n\nP-47s of the 56th FG, and in the blink of an eye its commander Wilhelm-\n\nFerdinand Galland, Oberleutnant Heinz Hoppe and Feldwebel Günther\n\nScholz had bagged one Thunderbolt each. Twelve minutes later (19:04)\n\n\"Wutz\" piled up another P-47 of the 56th FG into his scoreboard, his\n\n46th aerial victory. By the end of the day, seven Thunderbolts and\n\nfive B-17s had been downed, against no losses in the German side.\n\nWilhelm Galland shot down his 54th and last victim on August 12 (a\n\nB-17). Five days later, he took off in the cockpit of his beloved Fw\n\n190A-5 WNr 530125 leading the whole II./JG 26 against a group of 200\n\nbombers which were returning to England after bombing Schweinfurt.\n\nWhen he was about to order the assault against the four-engine\n\nbombers, his Gruppen was suddenly jumped by P-47 Thunderbolts of the\n\n56th FG. One of them was flown by Walker \"Bud\" Mahurin, who riddled\n\nGalland's Fw 190 with 12.7 mm machinegun fire and sent it downwards in\n\nflames. Probably we never know whether the unfortunate \"Wutz\" was\n\nkilled instantly or he tried to bail out, but what is out of question\n\nwas the fact that he didn't make it: he died when his aircraft crashed\n\nW of Maastricht, leaving a huge crater in the ground. The American\n\n56th Fighter Group took revenge that day of its defeat on June 26, and\n\nGalland's defeater, Walker Mahurin, ended the war with 24.25 victories\n\n(20.8 in Europe and the remaining ones in the Pacific).\n\nIn a certain way, it was like his fate was linked with the one of the\n\nwhole Luftwaffe: as long as he was alive and bagging Allied planes,\n\nthe Luftwaffe in the Channel Front could mantain the air superiority,\n\nbut few months after his death, the P-47s and Mustangs of the 8th AF\n\ncontrolled the airspace over Northern France, allowing the massive\n\nAllied landing in Normandy on June 6 1944, and the begining of Third\n\nReich's end. However, his outstanding war career is one of the best\n\nexamples of the patriotism and skills shown by the brave German pilots\n\nwho fought against all odds in the Western Front.\n\nPaul\n\nLoading Image...\n\nPaul Galland was the youngest of the Galland brothers. He joined JG 26\n\nas a Leutnant in February 1941 having completed his operational\n\ntraining with Ergänzungsgruppe/JG 26. He was assigned to 8./JG 26. He\n\nscored his first victory on 6 July when he shot down a RAF Spitfire.\n\nBy the end of 1941 his score had reached three. He recorded his 10th\n\nvictory on 3 May 1942, another Spitfire shot down over Calais. On 31\n\nOctober 1942 Galland participated in the vengeance raid on Canterbury.\n\nOn the return flight Galland answered a call from a German pilot being\n\nattacked by a Spitfire. The Spitfire spotted Galland's approach and\n\npulled up into the cloud cover. Galland attempted to follow but\n\nstalled and had to dive away to regain speed. The Spitfire took the\n\nopportunity to dive from the clouds and shoot down Galland's Fw 190\n\nA-4 (WNr 2402) \"Black 1\".\n\nPaul Galland was credited with 17 victories in 107 combat missions.\n\n~ Notable People of World War II"
