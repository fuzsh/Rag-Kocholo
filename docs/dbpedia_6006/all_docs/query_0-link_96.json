        "text": "Kilkenny Roots\n\n1 – 4 May 2015\n\nKilkenny, Ireland\n\nView: Craic-ed up\n\nThe “friendliest little festival in the world” got off to a sensational start with a searing performance from John Murry. Looking and acting increasingly like a baddie in some deranged silent movie, Murry with his pick-up band killed Pavement’s Shady Lane before debuting new songs that indicate that his next album might even outdo the award-winning Graceless Age. Nominal Kilkenny bill-toppers were Calexico, whose panoramic and super-slick show at the plush Set Theatre ended up in mass partying. Male / female folk duos slugged it out in the form of London’s The Rails and Saskatoon’s Kacy And Clayton, both vying for the title of the new Fairports. In terms of commercial appeal, the highly-accessible Sons Of Bill seem set for mainstream success, but the band that Kilkenny clasped closest to its bosom was Montreal’s Barr Brothers. Their category-defying world / folk / blues virtuosity proved that there really is room for a harp in rock and roll.\n\nSouth By South West Festival\n\nAustin, Texas\n\n17 – 22 March 2015\n\nView: Dampish\n\nAfter last year’s overcrowding and huge headliners, it felt like a conscious move back towards the original spirit of sxsw. With the help of some rain, it was quiet enough to return to the core task of seeking out hot new bands. American Aquarium, a Springsteenesque outfit from North Carolina, drew attention, as did Virginia’s classic rockers Sons Of Bill. On the country front, Andrew Combs looks set for stardom. At Hotel San Jose, a slightly damp showcase symbolised the genre-bending line-ups that make sxsw so special: Carl Barât, Gang Of Four and cool new band Houndmouth mixed it with The Zombies. Who’d have thought that the voice of the festival would be that of 70 year old Colin Blunstone? The best live band in the world right now is Chuck Prophet And The Mission Express, who were stalked by RC as they did nine shows in three days. Imminent breathroughs included Australia’s Courtney Barnett and Germany’s super-accessible Milky Chance, but only one outfit demonstrated the clear power to conquer the States. The ridiculously frantic energy levels and in-your-face enthusiasm of the Pogues-ish Skinny Lister mean that a Mumford-style triumph is inevitable. And you haven’t lived until you’ve been crowd-surfed over by someone playing a double bass.\n\nSleaford Mods\n\nJoiners, Southampton\n\n12.3.15\n\nView: Behind a six foot seven man\n\nIf this is the future of rock, forget it. Not because they aren’t any good, but simply because of the audience’s demographic: forties and fifties. If Sleaford Mods revive the spirit of punk (which they sort of do), it’s not an introduction of punk to a new generation, it’s old punks reliving their youth. Sleaford Mods are a lot of entertaining fun. There’s Jason Williamson with a severe case of Tourettes, who jogs round in circles, gobs on the stage and wiggles his tongue, shouting like a cross between Eminem and John Cooper Clarke. Arguably even more entertaining is Andrew Fearn, whose role is to swig Corona, check his phone, do a mild grandad dance and, every ninety seconds, press a button on his laptop, like a grinning, emaciated John Shuttleworth. Williamson’s profane lyrics are actually very clever, with nifty wordplay, relevant themes and caring attitudes, rewarding repeated listening on the vinyl which, interestingly, at least a quarter of the audience walked away with. They ain’t here for the long haul (there aren’t enough real tunes for that), but go see them while they last. They sure are different, and in a bland musical environment, that counts for a lot.\n\nJudith Owen\n\nThe Cellars, Southsea\n\n10.3.15\n\nView: Hunched on a stool\n\nThis was a strange show. Why has a flame-haired Welsh songstress recorded an album of her songs with some of the finest session musicians America has to offer? And what enables her to bring those very musicians to a cosy back street pub in Southsea? There’s legendary drummer Russ Kunkel and dreamy bassist Lee Sklar, although advertised guitarist Waddy Wachtel is inexplicably absent. It may possibly be to do with Judith’s husband, none other than Spinal Tap’s Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer). The band is promoting Judith’s new album Ebb And Flow and the show contains not only some of the rambling songs of Laurel Canyon philosophy it contains, but also some reworkings of songs by artists they originally worked with, such as Carole King’s “It Might As Well Rain Until September” and James Taylor’s “Hey Mister, That’s Me Up On The Jukebox”. More bizarrely still, Judith likes to completely rework some popular classics, in this case Mungo Jerry’s “In The Summertime” and David Dundas’ “Jeans On”. The musicians, despite barely breaking into a sweat, are sublime, but the question is, is the world ready for a cross between Tori Amos and Lyndsey De Paul? Maybe. “This is just the start of something much bigger”, says Judith, confidently. We shall see.\n\nEels\n\nSalisbury City Hall\n\n26.7.14\n\nView: Air-conditioned\n\nDesperately eager to please, it would be hard to imagine a less suitable Eels support act then toothsome duo Daughters of Davis. It was probably a typical bit of ghoulish E-style humour paving the way for a long series of what the dapper Everett called “soft rock bummers” – two minute laments such as “Parallels” from new album The Cautionary Tales Of Mark Oliver Everett, culminating in the saddest song ever written, “It’s A Motherfucker”. There was a valedictory feel to this last date of a 53-date tour (“nursing 52 hangovers”, as E put it). Bookended by two tear-jerking standards, “When You Wish Upon A Star” and “Can’t Help Falling In Love”, were energetic re-workings of Eels favourites “Fresh Feeling” And “I Like Birds”. Not since Chuck Berry has an artist been so adept at recycling his own songs while still retaining the affection of his audience. We’ll forgive him anything.\n\nJesse Malin\n\nDingwalls, London\n\n26.11.14\n\nView: Crouching\n\nIt’s been four years since Jesse Malin played in the UK and the audience was psyched up after a strong introductory set from Hollis Brown. The interim has been spent writing and recording a new album, which on first live hearing sounds to be stuffed with characteristically affecting songs. The diminutive New York road warrior exudes rock and roll charm and comes with the band that helped him record the new material, featuring guitarist Mike Montali and extremely dapper bassist Don DiLego. Apart from a confusing incident when too much instrument swopping went wrong and they lost their way, this made for a storming show with some moments of pure beauty, such as when the whole audience sat down, hippie-style, for the gorgeous “Bar Life”. Jesse has a great way with an anecdote and charmed the midweek audience with his fury at press accusations of being “alt-country”. New songs like “Addicted” and “Year I was Born” vied for attention with old favourites “Wendy” and “Hotel Columbia”. Let’s hope this marks the start of a Malin revival.\n\nEnd Of The Road Festival\n\nDorset\n\n29 August – 21 September 2014\n\nView: Bucolic\n\nConsidering that half the bands here have been influenced by Pavement, it was a joy to hear Stephen Malkmus, master of the contorted guitar, in action. By contrast, Jenny Lewis was as poppy as this festival gets, as the chill wind blew around her. The first exclusive was the cumbersomely-named Gene Clark – No Other Band (featuring Robin Pecknold of Fleet Foxes and the often sadly overlooked Iain Matthews, plus a Vegas-style compère). There were some truly beautiful voices here and a blockbusting encore of Eight Miles High.\n\nNew names making breakthroughs included Montreal’s Barr Brothers, cementing the role of the harp in rock and roll and sounding uncannily like The Low Anthem in so doing. Andrew Combs also charmed, as did the fragile but bewitching Tiny Ruins. Forthcoming plaudits for young Benjamin Booker as the new indie Hendrix are inevitable – and deserved. One exciting and unexpected show was the blazing psychedelia of Sean Lennon’s new band The Ghost Of A Saber Tooth Tiger, almost giving the Flaming Lips a run for their money.\n\nTalking of whom … It was a joyful enough festival anyway, but Wayne Coyne and gang ratcheted up the happiness meter to the level of ecstasy. With their skill at turning a potential shambles into a technological multi-media masterpiece, they amazed and thrilled everyone from kids to grandparents. The organisers of this brilliant festival will have to go some to top this next year.\n\nOliver Gray\n\nWickham Festival\n\nWickham\n\n14 – 17 August 2014\n\nView: “VIP”\n\nFrom Bellowhead to James Blunt, Wickham Festival 2014 enhanced its reputation for relaxed musical randomness. Equally reviled and adored, Blunt boosted attendance figures to the extent that camping chairs were banned – controversial. The energetic skanking of Neville Staple (close your eyes and it’s the Specials) interrupted the general drowsiness of Friday afternoon. Hazel O’Connor is still playing Breaking Glass songs but now in a quite charming cabaret trio format. An almost unchanged Hugh Cornwell played some Stranglers numbers (close your eyes and it’s definitely not the Stranglers) and embarrassingly got an enthusiastic response when asking how many audience members read the Daily Mail. Among the enormous sub bill, two new acts stood out – Tankus The Henge and Connecticut’s Caravan Of Thieves – so good they were asked to play twice. They covered Bohemian Rhapsody and lived to tell the tale. It was left to a genial Steve Earle to be crowned as the highlight by delivering a crowd-pleasing set of hits. Wickham’s Boomers wear their bus passes with pride, and have a lot of fun on the way.\n\nTruck Festival\n\nSteventon, Oxford\n\n17 -19 July 2014\n\nView: Hobgolinned\n\nIn past years, Truck has endured travails such as floods and insolvency. Not this time, though. Happiness was the keynote of the weekend, as a sell-out crowd escaped the corporate nature of bigger festivals and concentrated on the music. The main stage paid host to a stream of slightly dated synth-based indie rock from the likes of White Lies and The Twilight Sad, all of them dwarfed by a dramatic set from local heroes Stornoway. Slow Club’s performance was frustrating, starting off enthusiastically and fizzling out in a bunch of mediocre songs, before Roots Manuva got things moving again. Of the main headliners, The Cribs were the most polished, while riotous duo Deap Vally caused the most controversy and a discreet veil needs to be drawn over the latest version of Gang Of Four. Continung the cheerful eclecticism, British soul-rockers Danny And The Champions Of The World brought the house down – twice, while musical joy could be found in adventurous sets from lesser-known (but very Truckish) acts like Chris T-T, Co-Pilgrim and the twinkling Steven James Adams (ex of the Broken Family Band). Pure fun in the sun.\n\nThe Delines\n\nThe Art Bar, Oxford\n\n14 June 2014\n\nView: Comfy\n\nThe vibe is that of a smoky nightclub as the Delines hit the fourth show of their debut UK tour. Intended originally as a side project from Richmond Fontaine, this band has taken off in an unexpected way, with sell-out notices every night. Amy Boone’s voice has been compared to Dusty Springfield – the ultimate accolade, and what is striking is that Willy Vlautin has written his most affecting set of songs ever. There’s a satisfyingly organic vibe to songs like Colfax Avenue and I Won’t Slip Up, country soul that grabs your heart, but the variety is clever too – from the almost trip-hop of Flight 31 to a brace of drinking songs, one of them a cover of What One Bottle Can Do by Al James of Dolorean. Bassist Freddy Trujillo chips in with his own Freddy Fender while pianist Cory Gray adds colour to some of the songs with virtuoso trumpet. You get the feeling this is a story that’s only just beginning.\n\nCaravan\n\nSalisbury City Hall\n\n6.3.14\n\nView: Unimpeded\n\nThe significant looks when a mistake is made, the relieved grins at the end of each song – such are the tell-tale signs of the first night of a tour. Mind you, it’s forgivable when your benchmark track is the 23-minute long “Nine Feet Underground”, written in 1971 by the absent David Sinclair. Indeed, only the statuesque Pye Hastings remains from the original line-up, although stalwarts like Geoff Richardson and Jan Schelhaas have been around for a long while. Caravan have a new album called Paradise Filter and it’s not very proggy. Many of the new songs which formed the bulk of the set, including I’ll Be There For You and the title track, are actually quite conventional rock / pop tunes, played mainly with great competence by the multi-instrumentalist Richardson. Among the small selection of oldies was a rather inappropriately funked-up version of Golf Girl. Back in the day, there was much swopping of members between Caravan and Camel. Now, in the battle of the unlikely prog comebacks, Camel are winning hands down.\n\nCamel\n\nThe Barbican, London\n\n28.10.13\n\nView: Unimpeded\n\nWhen a show starts with a standing ovation before a note has been played, something special is going on. “It’s good to be here”, said Andy Latimer. “At my age, it’s good to be anywhere”. Knowing his recent history of severe health problems, there was hardly a dry eye in the house; most of the audience had thought they’d never see this day. What’s more, as sole original member, Andy is on tip-top form, his guitar playing as rich as ever in tone and melody, and tough and gritty when required. The historic run-through of The Snow Goose (the first since the mid seventies) took up the first half, the musicianship precise, the atmosphere joyful. Nothing could replace the silken Hammond of Peter Bardens, but keyboardists Jason Hart and Guy LeBlanc do a grand job. This is one band for which “prog” never meant ”pretentious”. Part two saw an eclectic selection of Camel classics, some less successful than others. An acoustic intro to Never Let Go was scrappy and Fox Hill was ill-chosen, but For Today was reminiscent of Gary Moore at his best and by the time an ecstatic audience was being entranced by their biggest “hit” Lady Fantasy, it looked, sounded and felt as if Camel is back for good.\n\nThe Hoax\n\nThe Railway, Winchester\n\n28.8.2013\n\nView: Squashed\n\nAn amazing fifteen years since their last studio album, the audience thought they were witnessing a miracle as the original Hoax line-up reconvened to present their new crowd-funded effort “Big City Blues”. This was the first date and the capacity blues addict audience was pleasingly tolerant of support act Well Hung Heart, featuring Hoax bassist Robin Davey and his wife Greta, sporting – yes – a lampshade, as she covered Radiohead’s “Creep”. You had to be there to appreciate the fun. With great courage, The Hoax blasted out the whole of the new album, which consists of snappy, grunge-bluesy two minuters like “Hipslicker” and “Let It Shine”, each with the kind of attention-grabbing hooks that got people joining in even though they had never heard them before. This is a new, leaner Hoax with the guitar battles between Jon Amor and Jesse Davey now heavily edited and all the more impressive for it. The band is, amazingly, hotter than it’s ever been before.\n\nWickham Festival\n\n1 – 4 August\n\nView: Among the picnic chairs\n\nWickham has discovered a lucrative way to attract festival-goers: Combine a trad folk fest with a bunch of retro pop and rock acts and pull in a crossover audience. It worked, as it was a sellout. A laidback crowd of mellow grandparents enjoyed the likes of Seth Lakeman, who could use some new creative input, and Show of Hands, whose eclectic approach and super-smooth professionalism mean they are always entertaining. The Waterboys impressed on their comeback and a version of 10CC hit the nostalgia button, while Dexys riled the audience by ignoring their hits. The seemingly never-ending supply of hoedown specialists (don’t mention the Peatbog Faeries’ bagpipes please) gave way on the final day to some classic and much-loved rockers. Wilko Johnson stormed through a high-energy set and even joined the Blockheads later. Not much in the way of new bands here, it’s not that sort of festival, but Public Service Broadcasting shone like a beacon of innovation and Southampton’s Sean McGowan triumphed against some leaking sound from the dire covers band in the next-door tent.\n\nPalmfest\n\nThe Palmeira, Hove\n\n1.6.13\n\nView: Trampled underfoot\n\nYou may think that a festival of UK Americana and folk would be a laid-back affair but not in this case. By the time Danny George Wilson was leading his eight-piece Champions Of The World towards the late-night climax, the Palmeira pub had been turned into a massive, sweaty, pogoing moshpit, consisting largely of artists who’d previously been on stage and were now letting their hair down. Peter Bruntnell and his electric band had just finished a set of psychedelic rock of such power that the audience, after a day of hard drinking, was almost hysterical with joy. Two stages alternated throughout the day, with acoustic sets from gruff-voiced Jack Day and Radio Two’s favourite Liverpudlian Robert Vincent. But things took off with Welsh scallywags The Caves, sounding like a cross between The Hollies and Ash, and then the beautiful, wafting songs of Devon’s Small Town Jones, accompanied by guitarist of the day, the extraordinarily gifted Dave Little. Oxford’s Dreaming Spires added an indie touch before the Champs almost literally brought the house (well, the chandelier) down. Wild stuff.\n\nJohn Murry\n\nBush Hall, London\n\n8.5.13\n\nView: Comfy\n\nJohn Murry and his band Dark Matter’s show benefited the from the intimacy of what is surely London’s most atmospheric venue outside the Union Chapel. Murry was onstage during the support, duetting with Peter Bruntnell on the lovely Handful Of Stars. Starting the set dressed in a soon-abandoned flat cap, Murry had the audience transfixed as he revisited tracks from his extraordinary Graceless Age album. The music is squally rock, not the fey “Americana” with which he has been lazily tagged and Murry’s stage presence defies description, wavering between super rockstar confidence, nervous diffidence, wry humour, baffled innocence and twitchy edginess. He also plays a mean Telecaster, entwined with the potent lead guitar of Sean Coleman. But in the end, it’s all about the songs and the story of salvation from drug addiction. While the album is lushly produced, beautiful songs like California and Southern Sky take on harsh new dimensions, with the tour de force Little Colored Balloons being one of the world’s great live music experiences. Murry gives it absolutely everything every night and the audience simply melts. How does he do it?\n\nWorld Party\n\nWedgewood Rooms, Portsmouth\n\n26.4.13\n\nView: Among friends\n\nA rotund but chipper figure, Kark Wallinger shared the stage with a stripped down World Party consisting of the Blockheads’ Jon Turnbull on guitar and regular violinist David Duffy. The big mystery was how such a canon of genius songs can’t even fill a little venue like this. The avuncular Wallinger, seemingly a picture of contentment, took charge of every song from his substantial back catalogue, and out they tumbled. An interlude at the piano featured a celebratory “She’s The One”, while Duffy switched to mandolin for “Is It Like Today”. There wasn’t a person in the house not bellowing out the uniquely irresistible choruses of “Put The Message In The Box” and “Ship Of Fools”. The band were clearly relishing every moment and by the time they were encoring with Way Down Now, the audience was consumed with a wave of emotion, shouting out their love for Wallinger. “Don’t be silly now” was all the self-deprecating star would say, as the audience continued to bellow the Stonesian “whoo whoos” out into the night.\n\nRay Davies\n\nSouthampton Guildhall\n\n6.10.12\n\nView: Installed in the stalls\n\nWhy does Ray Davies keep running off stage every few minutes? Speculation was rife. Surely not drugs at his age? A weak bladder, maybe? Suddenly, someone spotted it: “Look, he’s changed his shoes!” This was a fun, nostalgic evening of hits, but the workmanlike band made it a long way away from the excitement of the Kinks. You definitely had the feeling of a job being done the same way as every night, with singalongs encouraged and compliments paid to the wonderful Southampton crowd (same as any other). The most poignant moments came not with the throwaway versions of the hit singles but rather with the beautiful and still tear-jerking “Celluloid Heroes” and a lovely acapella version of “Days”. Ray almost met his match in the form of support act Small Town Jones, drafted in at the last minute to melt the audience’s hearts and empty their pockets at the merch stand.\n\nAlabama Shakes\n\nBirmingham HMV Institute\n\n11 May 2012\n\nView: Squashed\n\nAlabama Shakes must be feeling strange right now. Just months after their UK debut in a London pub, here they found their show being upgraded from the Institute’s smallest room to its largest. With just the one Boys And Girls album and less than an hour’s worth of music to play, they faced a rowdy and inattentive Friday night audience and, frankly, didn’t deliver. The number of people complaining about their neighbours chatting loudly through all the (many) quiet sections must reveal something about the band’s ability to grip an audience. The most common comment in the room was ”Give it six months and Brittany Howard will be a solo artist” and the most noticeable thing about the band was the complete absence of any interpersonal communication or indeed enthusiasm. Which is a real shame, because Howard is an undisputed talent. She uses that extraordinary voice in clever and subtle ways (perhaps too clever for this goodtime crowd, who only seemed to recognize Hold On) and her underrated guitar playing is particularly impressive. The band? Well, remember the expression Sleeperblokes? They’re back, folks. Those expecting Adele-style rapture were deeply disappointed.\n\nRichmond Fontaine / Richard Buckner / Peter Bruntnell\n\nCecil Sharp House, London\n\n7.5.12\n\nView: Reverential\n\nThe folkies of Cecil Sharp House had never heard the like. Guitarist Dan Eccles was on all fours as a good five minutes of controlled feedback provided the coda to an extraordinary re-working by Richard Buckner of The Cars’ Candy-O. This was the climax of a show which reinvented the package tour, as Buckner, designated driver Peter Bruntnell and the Richmond Fontaine duo of Eccles and Willy Vlautin first did their own sets and then linked up for the finale. Bruntnell’s invariably excellent songwriting went down well (new songs included London Clay and Caroline). Using all manner of guitar trickery, Richard Buckner presented a career-spanning set in the form of clusters of five or six songs, merging into each other in mesmerising fashion. As for Richmond Fontaine, there’s a uniqueness in the way their gripping songs of death and disappointment are presented in an atmosphere of the utmost good humour. This rainy London evening provided fantastic value for the sold-out crowd.\n\nKathleen Edwards\n\nIslington Academy\n\n28.2.12\n\nView: Plush balcony\n\nIt was one of those never-to-be-forgotten moments. Alone on stage, battling to articulate the meaning of her song House Full Of Empty Rooms, Kathleen Edwards gives up. ”Shit, fuck”, she spits, and the tears begin to flow both from her and the audience. Such a sassy, confident, stomping stage performer and yet so vulnerable to pent-up emotion. Something about London seems to bring out the best in her, as she seemed truly emotional about the audience’s reaction to her performance. Starting with a cool double whammy from the new Bon Iver-produced Voyageur album (Empty Threat and Chameleon / Comedian), Kathleen satisfied all wishes with a chunk of new songs and a ready scattering of favourites such as Asking For Flowers and a truly storming Back To Me. She sure knows how to pick a band too. Long-standing bassist John Dinsmore is joined by drummer Lyle Molzan, Daniel Ledwell on keys (causing hysterics on stage and in the audience with emergency mid-song repairs) and a stunning replacement for Colin Cripps in the form of long tall guitarist Gord Tough. Cool and calm, his soloing nevertheless elicited several outbursts of mid-song applause. Kathleen has a beautiful voice, intriguing onstage manner, gorgeous songs and she bows a mean violin too. It was quite a night.\n\nDawes\n\nWindmill, Brixton\n\n17.2.12\n\nView: Slightly damp\n\nTaylor Goldsmith has got the frontman thing down to a tee. Unbroken eye contact with the front row and others behind ensures that the ladies in the audience gently melt (almost literally, as the heat means that droplets of warm rain are falling on their heads). Then, as he throws out the very precise and tuneful guitar solos which pepper each song, the musos are entranced as well. Add in an entire album’s worth of killer songs and you have a band whose future is secure. Goldsmith has a happy knack of pronouncing all his lyrics in such a way that you can hear every word  – very unusual in rock and roll. No wonder Dawes fans and collaborators include Glen Dampbell and Jackson Browne. Playing pretty much the whole of their aptly-titled Nothing Is Wrong album (although not necessarily in the right order) means that one melodic gem after the other tumbles out, accompanied by an audience which knows them all by heart. Not even a recalcitrant Wurlitzer can ruin the general joy, with drummer (and brother) Griffin Goldsmith providing vital extra vocal muscle and a languid backbeat worthy of Mercury Rev. Following a truly majestic So Well, the climax is reached with the lyrically surreal Time Spent In Los Angeles. One of those ”I was there” gigs.\n\nMark Eitzel / Richard Buckner\n\nBuffalo Bar, Cardiff\n\n9.11.11.\n\nView: Over a Buffalo Burger\n\nA triple bill of extraordinary quality was kicked of by Sacri Cuori, an Italian minimalist instrumental trio with strong Calexico connections. Next up, the brilliant Mark Eitzel. Currently between albums, Mark here displayed his torch singing ability with classics like I Left My Heart In San Francisco and favourites such as Gravity Talks and Nothing Changes. If he sings anything new, he says, it’s leaked on the internet within hours.\n\nPerforming his first UK shows in eight years, Richard Buckner was worried about following Eitzel, but it worked out fine. Backed with sympathetic precision by Sacri Cuori, the big man’s downbeat, laconic melodies as displayed on his new album Our Blood were an understated treat.\n\nA certain awkwardness about addressing the audience was summed up by an incident involving an injured finger and a snack in the front row. ”I’m bleeding over your nuts”, observed Buckner wryly. I bet you don’t hear that every day.\n\nTruck Festival\n\nSteventon, Oxford\n\n22  24 July 2011\n\nView: Sun-kissed\n\nBig names were absent from the expanded Truck, unless you count Graham Coxon or St Etienne. Instead, the voguish Americana mode was embraced, making for a pleasant, low-key event. The over-clever Bellowhead contrasted with a triumphant set by the folk-soul of The Duke And The King, arguably band of the festival. Flop of the weekend was Philip Selway, who managed to empty the tent of people who were not angry, just bored. Following on, John Grant showed his accolades are deserved. There was an exciting breakthrough by the innovative Sea Of Bees and a life-affirming set from a hearteningly sprightly Edwyn Collins with his great session band. Caitlin Rose and Richmond Fontaine had acoustic fun in the sun, while, on the pop front, Young Knives revealed a debt to Blur. Interesting new acts included Oxford’s Spring Offensive and young Danes Treefight For Sunlight (although they should have refrained from destroying Wuthering Heights). Not a bad way to spend a weekend at all.\n\nThe Flaming Lips\n\nEden Project, Cornwall\n\n30 June 2011\n\nFree admission to the domes and an all-day programme featuring the likes the excellent OK Go (full marks for the multicoloured outfits) made this a grand value day out. And what more appropriate setting could be imagined for Wayne Coyne’s traditional audience excursion in his very own geometric dome? The balloons, confetti and general bonhomie ensure that the audience is up and in a state of hysteria before the show is three minutes old. Among the newer material they resurrect She Don’t Use Jelly, allowing some breathing space before a storming Yoshimi and encores of the ever-stunning Race For The Prize and Do You Realize? bring us back to fever pitch (not to mention a tear to the eye). Still endearing is the falsetto ”Thank You” that Steven Drodz uses to acknowledge the adulation. He is the evil genius behind it all, after all. Meanwhile, they’ll still be picking up the confetti from the Cornwall countryside this time next year.\n\nJesse Sykes and the Sweet Hereafter\n\nMonto Water Rats, London\n\n21 April 2011\n\nView: Close\n\nIt was one of those classic London gig scenarios featuring noise leaking in from next door and endless support bands from hell, but nothing could faze these seasoned Seattle pros. Boldly easing themselves in with a lengthy instrumental (Weight Of Cancer), they had the audience entranced from the off. Playing almost all of their new album Marble Son (which deserves success of at least Fleet Foxian proportions), guitarist Phil Wandscher is very much to the fore with brilliantly broody, effect-laden soling. On the proggy Pleasuring The Divine he sounds much like the criminally under-rated Andrew Latimer of Camel. Between all this come Jesse’s atmospheric close harmony songs such as Be It Me Or Be It None and the Sykes classic The Air Is Thin. A picture of concentration, she warms the audience’s collective heart with her ethereal presence and her other-worldly voice. Its only a matter of time.\n\nThe Low Anthem\n\nQueen Elizabeth Hall, London\n\n11 / 4 / 11\n\nView: Closer than expected\n\nTalk about snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. The most charming and memorable section of the Low Anthem’s set came when they descended into the audience for fifteen minutes of acoustic songs while frazzled engineers battled with an imploding sound system. Don’t go back, pleaded the audience, recognizing the obvious truth that this wonderful band simply doesn’t require amplification. They accepted it themselves too: We don’t need any of this gear, admitted Ben Knox Miller, promptly ceding the stage to a clarinet trio that could have come straight from a school assembly. A venue like this suits the band’s intimacy but not their loud interludes, which they really should consider dropping. Completely at one with their audience (who dutifully accompanied This God Damn House with their mobile phones), they remained low-key after the interruption, climaxing with the brilliant Oh My God Charlie Darwin and Cohen’s Bird On a Wire. How reassuring that such original, calm, understated music commands such a large following.\n\nThe Duke And The King\n\nElectric Ballroom, London\n\n27 / 10 / 10\n\nView: Cosy\n\nWhen people ask what The Duke And The King are like, the nearest I can get is a cross between Neil Young and Marvin Gaye. Certainly, their jaw-droppingly soulful singalong finale of Young’s Helpless is one of current music’s unique moments. This London show was slightly muted on account of a family bereavement in the band, but it felt like a breakthrough show for them nonetheless.\n\nThe musical pot-pourri of indie-cool Simone Felice, violin-toting soul diva Simi Stone, mountain minstrel Bobby Bird and yearning funk drummer Nowell Haskins (he’s the son of P/Funk co-founder Clarence ”Fuzzy” Haskins) starts with what seems for a moment to be a standard alt-country strumalong with If You Ever Get Famous, then flattens the audience when Nowell’s vocals kick in and you realize you’re at a soul concert. It’s spine-tingling, and it continues for over an hour, with all four members taking lead vocals and harmonizing barber-shop style.\n\nAnd afterwards, of course, the band are all out socializing with their audience. It’s a unique relationship, destined to be a long-lasting one.\n\nC.W. Stoneking\n\nMr Kyps, Poole\n\n8.2.11\n\nView: Safely away from the talkers\n\nExperiencing C.W. Stoneking is a bit like watching The Wire: for the first half you don’t understand a word but by the end, you’ve adjusted and relaxed into it. The Buster Keaton lookalike and ex-ventriloquist (he hardly opens his mouth throughout) has tales to tell as he delivers his jungle blues with the help of a battered tenor banjo, a National steel and a Dixieland brass section of cornet, trombone and tuba. Handyman Blues storms along, while Jungle Lullaby nearly morphs, Paolo Nutini-style, into I Wanna Be Like You. Even incorporating Jimmie Rogers-style yodelling into the spuriously explained jungle concept, its no wonder the folks of New Orleans were baffled by the arrival of the Australian bluesman and could only offer him a job in a hoodoo shop.\n\nIt’s all charmingly entertaining but probably, in the great scheme of things, more of a novelty than a great work of art.\n\nDelays\n\nSouthampton University\n\n9 / 3 / 05\n\nIts lovely for the folk of Southampton to have a band to champion at last. Previously, they had to pretend to be proud of Craig David. Warmed up by the gorgeous retro chic of Winchester’s Scarlet Soho, the crowd felt like one big family as the appropriate intro music of the Stones We Love You wafted out. Like a cross between the Four Seasons and the Small Faces, these guys are so tiny that they are almost obscured behind the bouncers standing a metre lower than them. You And Me, the first track on the new album (which the audience mysteriously already knows by heart) demonstrates Greg Gilbert’s falsetto in all its glory. This is classic pop summed up in three minutes, and with two albums under their belts, they have an array of glittering tunes to choose from. New single Valentine breezes along like Odyssey-era Zombies. Behind the faded glamour there’s real craftsmanship at work; they know their way round a hook, but they can rock out and charm an audience as well. Little blokes with bouffants rule, yes?\n\nEels\n\nRoyal Festival Hall, London\n\n23 / 5 / 05\n\nSince Eels concerts have been known to feature fist fights because of E’s insistence on a seated, silent audience, the RFH must be his ideal venue. And the special guests turn out to be a Russian animated children’s film. Eels unpredictability is almost becoming predictable. To be fair, he couldn’t turn up at some rock dive with this Butch-less (i.e. drummer-less, not really Eels at all) band, complete with nubile string quartet. Hardly a song on Blinking Lights is more than two minutes long, so there’s very much a classical feel, with each brief movement being politely applauded. With his crumpled Charlie Chaplin suit, cane and ever-present cigarette, its purely the E Show, although something that is new and works brilliantly is the blending of strings, pedal steel and saw. Apologizing for maybe disappointing us (he even disguised Bus Stop Boxer, Birds and Dog Faced Boy as requests for the Queen), E really needs to learn that he can actually do what he likes and we WON’T MIND!\n\nThe Hollies\n\nBasingstoke Anvil\n\n20 / 10 / 05\n\nView: From the Bus Stop (only kidding, folks)\n\nStylish threads, snappy guitars, cracking tunes and cool haircuts: it could only be Franz Ferdinand. Or, indeed, the Hollies. With a new deal, their first original album in two decades due in February, and offical endorsement from the likes of My Morning Jacket and Fountains of Wayne, the Hollies are on quite a roll. Peter Howarth might have been born to front the Hollies, so perfectly does he fill the role. In among all the hits (many now expanded from three to four part harmonies), he unexpectedly inserts solo acoustic adaptations of Here I Go Again and Springsteen’s Sandy which contend with any of todays singer-songwriters and knock spots off James Blunt (ironic, in view of the fact that their best new song is called So Damn Beautiful). Both Bobby Elliott and Tony Hicks have drunk from the fountain of youth, and the new young Hollies members have rejuvenated the band. To be chucking in vital-sounding new songs and reinterpreting most of the old ones is pretty energetic stuff after 42 years on the road. And as Hicks launches into a spectacular Lynyrd Skynyrd style coda on Look Through Any Window, you wonder why they’ve never been treated with the respect they deserve. Michael Eavis, put them on the Pyramid Stage on Sunday afternoon at Glastonbury 2007. Imagine that lot singing along with He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother.\n\nCerys Matthews\n\nWedgewood Rooms, Portsmouth\n\n21 / 7 / 06\n\nCerys claimed that she’d been the first band member to reach the hotel lobby, so keen was she to get onstage after a six-year absence. How pleasing it is to report that what seemed to be one of the UK’s lost treasures is back in style, beauty, good health and fine voice. A small frisson passed over the crowd as, three songs in, Cerys and her crack band of long-haired instrument-swopping Nashville musos treated us to Lost Cat, but it was the only reference to either her Catatonia past or her more recent country dabblings. Clutching a guitar for most of the hour-long set, and with the occasional false start and nervous glance revealing that this was the start of a new project, she proved she certainly hasn’t lost her way with a tune. With both the little girl lost falsetto and the Rhondda Roar fully intact (albeit with an accent which combines Tennessee and Swansea), a good-humoured Cerys gave notice that her new Never Said Goodbye album is going to be a cracker and that her new career is going to be as exciting as the old one. Who’d have thought it?\n\nEnd Of The Road Festival\n\nDorset, UK\n\n17 / 9 / 06\n\nView: Scrumpy-addled\n\nJust when we thought there was no gimmick left to plunder, we realize we’d overlooked tap dancing. The unfairly pulchritudinous Tilly On The Wall are certainly the first band since Mungo Jerry to feature miked-up stomping boards. It would scream short-lived gimmick were it not for some super Abba-style tunes and harmonies. Howe Gelb can be either slick or shambolic. Today (sans moustache and gospel choir), he was in semi-shambolic mode, but that’s when he is at his most endearing. His version of PJ Harveys The Desperate Kingdom Of Love squared the circle between Arizona and Dorset. Despite (or probably because of) Ryan Adams’ drumming, Jolie Holland was a major disappointment, but Richard Hawley’s modern-day crooning cheered things up a lot, as did the harmony pop of Jim Noir, by no means as bleak as his name might imply. Plus, he had stolen Howe Gelb’s moustache. As Ryan Adams’ carpet techs hit the stage (don’t ask), the word was that he was “being an arse” backstage, but this turned out to be a measured and incident-free performance. Neal Casal has brought equilibrium with him and traded extended licks with the main man on Cold Roses and on numerous examples of what Adams terms his ”new jams”. Inspiring stuff, and a great coup for a new festival which, in the words of Chris T-T, is run by human beings and not a beer company.\n\nSteve Winwood\n\nWedgewood Rooms, Portsmouth\n\n25 / 4 / 2007\n\nThe warm atmosphere and the billing of this three-hour show as An Evening With Steve Winwood revealed Steve as a man comfortable with all stages of his career. In no particular order, we were treated to Spencer Davis hits (a throwaway Somebody Help Me and a monstrous Gimme Some Loving), Traffic classics from early (Medicated Goo) to later (Light Up Or Leave Me Alone) via Blind Faith (Can’t Find My Way Home). Landing at the Winwood solo years, his most commercially successful period (Higher Love etc.) now sounds his artistically weakest, while the latest album shows an artist at the peak of his powers (his cover of Timmy Thomas’ Why Cant We Live Together being an unexpected highlight of a set with may highs). The evergreen Winwood can afford to surround himself with the cream of sessioners, and by any standards, saxist Paul Booth and stand-in guitarist Tim Cansfield are sensationally funky. From the very first note, the silken Hammond, the glorious work on the bass pedals and that voice  seemingly unchanged since he was sixteen  caused the audience to pinch itself at being so close to a legend. Dear Mr Fantasy indeed.\n\nSpencer Davis Group\n\n100 Club, London\n\n3 / 2 / 07\n\nView: Very close\n\nThe current version of the Spencer Davis Group has been together far longer than the original one, and contains such great musicians that it’s a mystery why their profile isn’t higher. The answer is, of course, No Winwood, but Eddie Hardin remains as excellent a replacement as he was in 1967, teasing out the huge Hammond sound to accompany the towering guitar of the evergreen and ever-dexterous Miller Anderson. The genial Colin Hodgkinson on bass gels nicely with the newest member, drummer Stef Porzel, while Spencer well, he remains Spencer, the catalyst figure, still addicted to life on the road when he could well have been forgiven for slipping into a comfortable retirement. Warmed up by a fantastic London mod trio called The Turn, SDG’s act is the hits and more, of course, with my favourite being Hardin’s reflective interlude Deep In My Despair. As they blasted out Gimme Some Lovin’, the sweaty R & B atmosphere was probably much as it was when they were playing such subterranean London clubs in the Sixties. How nice to know that some things never change.\n\nThe Twang\n\nJoiners Arms, Southampton\n\nMarch 28 2007\n\nView: Unimpeded\n\nThis should have been a lot better. The Twang is the new buzz band  (front of the NME after just one single, for goodness’ sake)  but there was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere among the mostly male and - whisper it –  largely middle-aged audience. The sparse instrumentation and Brum-accented spoken vocals attempt to give a 2-Tone feel but the effect is more The Streets played by Duran Duran. Yes, the dated guitar effects are pure eighties and laughable if we were’t convinced that these are cool dudes. They aren’t even convinced themselves, with front man Phil Etheridge only waking up two songs before the end and the guitarist and bassist looking terrified throughout. The audience only recognized one song, unsurprisingly the single Wide Awake, and there wasn’t much in the set of similar quality. One doesn’t like to be pessimistic, but a long and successful career seems unlikely.\n\nIsle of Wight Festival 2007\n\nThe festival started with a tenth-rate Supertramp (The Feeling) and some music for TV ads (Groove Armada). Snow Patrol’s anthems were too squeaky-clean for their headlining slot. Saturday featured the original IOW troubadour, Donovan. The mass singalong to Sunshine Superman suited the mood perfectly. The impressive funk and ska of the charming Amy Winehouse had the whole field jumping. Total fun, as were Wolfmother, who brazenly usurped the approach of the islands honorary patron saint, Jimi Hendrix. Ash blew it by trying out new material on an inappropriate occasion, while Kasabian came close to stealing the show with a set of deceptive subtlety. Sadly, this competed directly with the island’s own brilliant Bees. Muse’s preposterous pomp-rock triumphed because of its sheer bravado, the Persil-white Matt Bellamy being second only to Jagger in the showmanship stakes. The plan was to blow the audience away, and it worked. Sunday was a delightful mish-mash of contrasts. Country Joe followed by Melanie C, anyone? The distressingly bland James Morrison caused mass dozing, but more exciting was cheery Scotsman Paolo Nutini, with his sideways approach, cool image, daft demeanour and willingness to rock. The frantic Fratellis seem to be in a career cul-de-sac like the similar (but better) Supergrass. Keane’s huge singalongs and undeniable quality made them a perfect warm-up for the rock and roll maelstrom that was to follow (see this page). Wonderful music, great organisation, nice environment; this was one damn good festival.\n\nEnd Of The Road Festival\n\nDorset, England\n\n14  16 September 2007\n\nVoted Best New Festival of 2006, this year’s End Of The Road reaped the reward with a hugely increased audience and fine weather conditions. Being entirely about music, there are no big stars or egos, as artists jam with each other and pop up for impromptu sessions all over the place. The setting, in the beautiful Larmer Tree Gardens, is surely one of the loveliest festival sites in the world, and the line-up of mainly Americana, indie and folk artists was adventurous and clever. The most exciting things about EOTR this year were the unexpected surprises. Here are some of the highlights: Jeffrey Lewis’ multi-media show featured wall-to-wall covers of songs by Crass. Dawn Landes concluded her set with a joyful duet with the unbilled Josh Ritter. The good-natured genuineness of blues plucker Charlie Parr succeeded in trumping the less subtle excursions of flavour-of-the-moment Seasick Steve. On a noisier note, the three-piece Charlie Bronson Outfit almost equalled the mad eclecticism of Yo La Tengo, who rampaged between the quietly melodic and the sonically insane. Howe Gelb curated the first day, guesting with every artist he presented, including the crazy but sensational Albini-prouced Scout Niblett, PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish and the magnificently atmospheric Jesse Sykes and the Sweet Hereafter, arguably the best band of the weekend. Howe Gelb’s own set on the main stage featured gorgeous lounge piano excursions. The grooviest, most danceable band of the festival was undoubtedly the Isle of Wight’s Bees, whilst new discoveries included My Brightest Diamond, a Drugstore for the 21st century, the Flaming Lips-lite of Sweden’s I’m From Barcelona (beaten in the quirkiness stakes by Misty’s Big Adventure), the Proclaimers-like harmony anthems of King Creosote and the ethereal beauty of Midlake, all the way from Denton, Texas. That’s just for starters, and all of them put the bigger names like Super Furry Animals and British Sea Power, both of whom seemed to be over-egging the professionalism, in the shade. EOTR 2007 was a non-stop feast of music with no pretensions and no airs or graces. What a privilege to have been there.\n\nRichard Thompson Band\n\nThe Brook, Southampton\n\n9 / 8 / 07\n\n”What a band!” enthuses Richard Thompson at the end of the first song. ”What? A band?” adds double-bassist Danny Thompson, sardonically. Yes, it’s rare for RT to tour with a band nowadays, so this sold-out performance was a thrilling way for the Brook to announce that it’s back in business. All the real and would-be guitarists in the audience were in ecstasy, and its true that there can’t be a guitar player in the world to match Thompson today, playing all those extraordinary sequences of notes which shouldn’t work, yet are somehow perfect. The emphasis was very much on the new album Sweet Warrior, standouts being the Iraq war song Daddy’s Gonna Kill Me and the less serious but equally engaging Too Late To Come Fishing. There’s something for fans of all aspects of Thomsons career, from the acoustic whimsy of Al Bowlly’s In Heaven to perennial favourite Vincent Black Lightening 1952, but he’s always at his best on the twisted electric guitar ballads like I Still Dream. The evening climaxed with the irresistible sing-along of Tear Stained Letter which turned into a Pete Zorn saxophone wig-out. Thompson is a national treasure and never lets us down.\n\nJoseph Arthur\n\nTalking Heads, Southampton\n\n22 November 2007\n\nPanicking about a PA buzz and adding a six-song encore are all part of the show for Joseph Arthur, whose live performances go on sale in CD form at the end of each gig. A DVD might have been a better idea on this tour though, as his band consists largely of enthusiastic supermodel rock chicks (one of them pricelessly called Sybil), who contrast dramatically with the downbeat, greasy-haired, trilby-hatted image of the man himself. Looking like a younger Richard Ashcroft and sounding like a mixture of Jesse Malin and David Gray, Arthur’s voice is certainly striking, even if the lyrics and some of the song structures are disturbingly AOR in style. The most enjoyable moments, apart from the Stonesy Diamond Ring and Let’s Just Be, were his solo acoustic efforts and when, for a momentary relief from the onslaught of echo and extended codas, he handed over the vocals to guitarist Kraig Jarret Johnson. The response to the show from the assembled Arthur fans was surprisingly muted, almost as if the intended spirit hadn’t made the journey from stage to audience in the way his solo performances can.\n\nAndy Burrows\n\nUnion Chapel, London\n\n28 May 2008\n\nRazorlight drummer Andy Burrows’ charming new charity album The Colour Of My Dreams is a charity record in aid of children’s hospice Naomi House. The full-scale launch of this initially low-key idea came out of left field, elevating Johnny Borrell’s co-writer to a pre-eminent position, yet it is typical that the project is altruistic, self-effacing and unpretentious. It’s a measure of Andy’s popularity among his peers that the Union Chapel’s stage was occupied by the likes of Fyfe Dangerfield (Guillemots), Dom Howard (Muse), Tom Smith (Editors) and the Bluetones’ Mark Morris, whilst the hot dogs were served by Jamie Oliver. Harmonizing with each of the guests, Andy’s songs came across as concise vignettes with little to do with rock and roll and everything to do with empathy and humanity. He displayed unexpected guitar skills and a voice which makes comparisons with the late Elliott Smith not as unlikely as they may seem. In the secret Razorlight finale, even the unfairly maligned Johnny Borrell seemed perfectly content to be playing second fiddle to his mate (and the raffle). In short, a magic evening.\n\nJohnny Flynn\n\nRailway Inn, Winchester\n\n13 / 5 / 08\n\nFrank Turner, Andy Burrows and now Johnny Flynn: Respectable young gentlemen from Winchester are the cool new thing;  who would have thought it? Whoever decided to invest in the young charmer with the folksy vibe, the Prince William good looks and the already faithful following has made a wise move. The age of the multi-instrumentalist is back (Johnny displays skills in guitar, banjo, mandolin, violin and some pretty spectacular trumpet, while sister Lillie looks after flute). Johnny’s songs are wry and lyrically unconventional and he has a pleasingly un-showbiz manner, the only current problem being an over-busy drummer turning almost every song into a shuffle. When he moves to keyboards and the cellist tackles the drums (are you following this?), more possibilities immediately open up. If you thought new folk was a passing fad, the imminent success of Johnny will extend its currency.\n\nHop Farm Festival\n\nKent\n\n5 / 7 / 08\n\nOnly Rufus Wainwright singing Leonard Cohen’s Halleluja could make you feel warm and cosy during a monsoon in Kent. My Morning Jacket’s silken amalgamation of Crosby, Stills and Nash with Lynryd Skynryd was well up to following Rufus, and ideal for this audience. Jim James finished the show as a demented, caped falsetto vampire. Flatteringly introduced by Steve Lamacq as a national institution, Supergrass (who, like everyone else, sacrificed much of their sound to the wind) were their usual selves: tuneful but unexciting. By this time, a serious chill was setting in, so the cockle-warming rock and roll of the ever-reliable Primal Scream was spot-on. They may be old-school but theyll be cool forever. Uniquely brilliant and worshipped by all, Neil Young’s lengthy set included a pleasing number of favourites like Needle and the Damage Done and Heart of Gold. One moment, he’s wrenching out astonishing guitar effects, the next he’s sitting at a pipe organ like a cross between Rick Wakeman and the local parish organist. The jaw-dropping climax consisted of a 25 minute version of No Hidden Path with an endless coda that you genuinely didn’t want to stop, followed by a truly mind-blowing take on the Beatles’ A Day In The Life. Apart from the car parking fiasco (organisational incompetence, basically), this was a great day out.\n\nWhite Denim / Micah P. Hinson\n\nBorderline, London\n\n15/7/08\n\nIn this battle of the Texan titans, it was a points victory for the self-effacing flat-capped romantic over the sonic bully-boys. White Denim certainly are impressive, incredible virtuosos rather wasting their talents on screamed rifferama with few hints of a tune. Guitarist and singer James Patralli is obsessed with wah-wah and double-tracking, making the overall effect a cross between the Jesus and Mary Chain, speeded-up Explosions In The Sky and Motorhead. At the end, you felt satisfied with the short set and generally bludgeoned into submission. The solo Micah, on the other hand, apologized for sounding like Simon and Garfunkel compared to the lush instrumental depth of his Micah P Hinson and the Red Empire Orchestra album, but he still held the room spellbound with his quietly emotional songs, sparse yet still full of resonance. It was ironic that, afterwards, his was the performance you remembered.\n\nAsh\n\nWedgewood Rooms, Portsmouth\n\n4/6/09\n\nIt seems like no time since Ash were pipsqueak upstart sixth-formers, yet already their audience consists of paunchy middle-aged blokes like me. They can still innovate though, with their schedule of 26 singles in a year. New songs like Space Shot, True Love 1980 and Return Of White Rabbit cleverly spruce up the Ash sound without straying too fear from the traditional template, which is basically just a fine way with a tune. You realize what an amazing back catalogue they have when they can launch their set with the killer double whammy of Walking Barefoot and Girl From Mars, with Tim Wheeler still looking like a teenager and lanky bassist Mark Hamilton, despite illness, doing his admirable double-jointed stick insect impersonation. Masters of the singalong anthem, songs like Oh Yeah and Shining Light mark Ash down as the ultimate summer band.\n\nJuliette Lewis\n\nTalking Heads, Southampton, UK\n\n19 / 5 / 09\n\nFive dates into a year-long world tour and Juliette Lewis is already looking the worse for wear, not to mention profoundly scary. The disappointing truth is that she doesn’t sing very well. The last person to perform so consistently flat was Louise Wener of Sleeper, although Louise wouldn’t even have attempted Juliette’s Janis Joplin-style blueswailing on Hard Lovin’ Woman. She still puts on an entertaining show, though. With a new band (the New Romantiques) which wouldnt look or sound out of place in your local pub, she has audience empathy in abundance, leaping into the crowd as often as possible, removing and replacing sunglasses and sparkly veil, leering suggestively and sweating like a waterfall. Featuring a raft of not very tuneful new songs from the Terra Incognita album, it certainly is rock and roll, and the sardine-like crowd does indeed love it.\n\nWhite Denim\n\nTalking Heads, Southampton\n\n5 / 7 / 09\n\nA pleasingly young audience belied a distinct seventies vibe on this evening, heads shaking and dandruff cascading. Some of us old lags were trying to find a reference point for a noodling power guitar trio like White Denim. Taste? Similar energy but more bluesy. Groundhogs? Similar attitude but a bit more psychedelic. Spirit? Thats more like it. In the figure of bandana-ed guitarist James Petralli theres even a hint of Randy California. A White Denim show consists of three medleys, in which songs from their albums Workout Holiday and Fits merge into each other in a bewildering series of time signature changes which keep the head shakers on their toes. In great jazz tradition, there’s strict discipline in the arrangements, leaving room for improvisation between musicians who are impressively attuned to each other. Ugly Betty bassist Steve Terebecki and elaborate drummer Joshua Block are a powerhouse rhythm section very much in the mould of Bruce and Baker, while Petralli yelps enthusiastically in a mix of soul and garage styles. Sounds unlikely? Well, this band sure is different and it makes for exciting viewing and listening. Whether the general public will become so enthused remains to be seen.\n\nJoe Jackson\n\nShepherds Bush Empire\n\n2 / 3/ 08\n\nThree songs in, the incongruous sound of Chinatown with completely inaudible piano and bass led to fears of the show being slaughtered by the soundman. Luckily Jackson (together with the faithful and fantastic rhythm section of Dave Houghton and Graham Maby) remains one of the most thrilling live performers anywhere in the world. His persona  a strange mixture of lanky, lugubrious, serious and convivial  draws in the crowd and the songs are allowed to blossom in the sparse trio setting. Irresistible oldies like the cold war commentary of The Obvious Song and Stranger Than Fiction (with the brilliant line”love shows God has a sense of humour”) mingle comfortably with a selection from the new album Rain, of which the finest track is the first, Invisible Man. An inspired choice of covers (Knowing Me Knowing You  – really  – and Scary Monsters  – honestly), plus the obligatory climax of Is She Really Going Out With Him? and the tear-jerking Slow Song insured that victory was indeed grasped from the jaws of disaster.\n\nJason Lytle\n\nIslington Academy\n\n28 / 5 / 09\n\nWhat a relief it is for Grandaddy followers that Jason Lytle sounds exactly like his ex-band. He’s on record as saying he was uncomfortable with the sheen of professionalism forced on them by major label status, but with his current band of downbeats, its right back to the seat-of-the-pants glory days of early Grandaddy. The only slick item on show was the lengthy and dramatic intro tape, leading into probably one of the lowest-key shows this venue has ever seen. Shoulders hunched, with head down and obscured by the omnipresent cap, Lytle crouches stage right, seemingly joined at the hip with main cohort Rusty Miller. Its hard to equate the figure with glorious songs like Yours Truly The Commuter and Brand New Sun, eccentrically glittering gems from his new album. What with the between song backing-track mayhem, the gear all held together with pink gaffa tape, it took a good kicking administered to a recalcitrant synth to finally allow them to splutter into their rapturously-received original greatest hit AM 180. Thank goodness there are still a few true rock and roll characters about.\n\nSouth By South West Festival\n\nAustin, Texas\n\n18  22 March 2009\n\nEach year you think sxsw cant get any better and each year it confounds you. Where else could you wander in the sunshine between the hillbilly folk of Justin Townes Earle and the studded leather jumpsuits of Hot Leg, Justin Hawkins’ post-Darkness parody? If you wanted, you could queue for Metallica or Kanye West, but as usual, the most fun was to be had stumbling on unannounced gems on the fringes. Here you could find the two drummers of a crazed And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead being outgunned by the five bass guitars of Shout Out Out Out Out in the multiple instrument stakes, or the pomp of the Decemberists being outclassed by the sublime shoegazing of Shearwater. Ah, Shearwater. They made me fear the alcohol had finally taken too much of a toll on me. Having heard their late-night performance at the plushy Hilton Garden Inn, I walked the next morning the hour and a half to the Mean Eyed Cat, to find them in the middle of performing the same (very good) show to a different audience. Talk about Groundhog Day. RC readers are well aware of Toronto’s Six Shooter Records and their artists. Equally legendary is the Tequila-drenched annual afternoon hootenanny they host at Headhunter’s Club, where their artists, hung-over but still buzzing from their label showcase the night before, play short sets of their favourite songs. The likes of Luke Doucet, Melissa McClelland and NQ Arbuckle spread the fun around. The previous evening, Elliott Brood had issued the audience with baking trays and wooden spoons, creating percussion mayhem. Other oddities were the surreal experience of Bauhaus goth hero Pete Murphy, complete with uncool bald patch and eccentric speechmaking. In a similar vein, the Blue Aeroplanes’ Gerard Langley was reading his lyrics from a printed crib-sheet, much like a politician with an autocue. Portland’s Peter Broderick is the first virtuoso of the saw since Mercury Rev’s Jonathan Donahue. And of course, there were the inevitable disappointments. I walked miles to catch current vogue bands The Soft Pack, Black Lips and Delta Spirit, and all of them were nondescript. Selecting highlights is tough, but here goes. Best new discovery: Copenhagen’s Asteroids Galaxy Tour, who have charm, beauty, cool pop songs and funky horns. Most exciting moment: nearly being asphyxiated in the moshpit for a gloriously decadent Primal Scream in a venue the size of a matchbox. Most moving music: A massively hung-over Jason Lytle making his post-Grandaddy comeback at the Mohawk Patio at Saturday lunchtime. Best show: A knockout blow by PJ Harvey and John Parish, completely flattening the capacity crowd at Stubbs, previously baffled by a washed-up Razorlight. Now surely sxsw 2010 cant get any better?\n\nThe Asteroids Galaxy Tour\n\nLuminaire, London\n\n15 / 5 / 09\n\nThe likes of Little Boots and Lady Ga Ga had better watch out, because in the pulchritude stakes, they are about to be obliterated by the extraordinary Mette Lindberg. Copenhagen’s finest ever band have the lot: funky horns providing Stax riffs, some pleasingly catchy and irresistibly danceable songs and the knockout blow of a riveting visual and vocal presence. Mette can warble Bjork-like but doesn’t over-do it, instead sweetly avoiding Mariah Carey-style woah woahs in favout of brief and punchy ohs and heys. It’s unique and totally charming. Nominally a duo of Mette and Lars Iversen, live, the band is a nicely analogue six-piece collective with an eccentric dress sense. Among a treasure trove of songs, Push The Envelope and the iPod commercial, Around The Bend are that rare phenomenon, tunes that you go home singing after just one hearing. This Tour truly is heading for the stars.\n\nPJ Harvey and John Parish\n\nBridport Arts Centre\n\n12 / 3 / 09\n\nAmong family and friends in this quaint converted chapel is the traditional point of departure for all PJ Harvey world tours. Addressing the wardrobe issues caused by her belted shroud with good humour, Polly was on sparkling form, safely surrounded by some of the world’s most outstanding musicians. Sporting more trilbies and mafia suits than a Leonard Cohen convention, John Parish and his colleagues helped Polly to take flight on almost all the new album and, pleasingly, a good chunk of 1996’s Dance Hall At Louse Point as well. Extraordinary variety was the keynote, from the gentle falsetto of Leaving California to the expletive-laden lunacy of A Woman A Man Walked By and the genuinely barking Pig Will Not (yes, she barks). Particularly exciting was the revival of fantastic older songs like the lugubrious Rope Bridge Crossing (one of this duo’s finest hours) and Circles Around The Sun, but most thrilling of all was the confirmation that music of this outstanding quality can still command a large and enthusiastic audience. A satisfying triumph all round.\n\nChuck Prophet\n\nThe Miners Arms, Lydney\n\n9 / 8 / 09\n\nSkirting round the Hell’s Angels and into the skittle alley of this Forest of Dean pub, Chuck had caused consternation by demanding the removal of chairs from the venue. A half-and-half compromise having been reached, the solo Chuck hit the stage for a warm evening of conviviality which included a Q and A session (of which the most hilarious section was a convoluted answer to the question ”Why are you here?”). Adapting the rockers from his new Let Freedom Ring album to an acoustic environment proved no problem for a virtuoso like Chuck, with simple beauties such as the title track and Sonny Liston’s Blues nestling comfortably alongside back catalogue classics like You Did and Balinese Dancer. An audience made up of keen fans who had travelled and locals who had never heard of him warmed to a man whose career looks as if it is about to hit a very belated high. He’ll be back in the UK with his band in the Autumn, but for now, this was a rare and treasured cameo.\n\nBad Company\n\nBrighton Centre\n\n10 April 2010\n\nView: Centre of the Centre\n\nMost of us have the odd school reunion but with Mott and Bad Company, Mick Ralphs has had two of the highest profile reunions imaginable in the space of six months. Chipper and cheerful, he can’t quite match the extraordinarily youthful Paul Rodgers in the svelteness stakes, but the chops are still there, aided by Howard Leese of Heart, who fleshes out the harmonies so that arguably this Bad Co is better then the original. The main secret of the power lies with drummer Simon Kirke, still as much of an object lesson in economy and power as when he was blasting out Fire And Water with Free forty years ago. It takes confidence to open with your greatest hit, and when the heartbeat intro tape segued into Can’t Get Enough and the neon logo flashed up, the whole place jumped into action and didn’t let up for an hour and ten minutes of pretty much solid gold. Whether it was ballads like Seagull or classics like Ready For Love, Rodgers’ voice and style have not declined in any way. We love you Paul, they still shout, and no wonder.\n\nMidlake\n\nWedgewood Rooms, Portsmouth\n\n30. 6. 10\n\nView: Crammed in the crowd\n\nThis was an evening for serious music lovers. With nary a rock pose in sight, these musicians are all about conveying songs and atmosphere. John Grant of the Czars performed his lyrically intense torch songs to rapt attention (standout being The Queen Of Denmark), before the intellectual Texans Midlake charmed the audience with ninety minutes gleaned almost entirely from their last two albums The Trials Of Van Occupanther and The Courage Of Others. Citing such impeccable influences as early Fairport Convention, Grandaddy and Richard Thompson (to which could be added seventies proggers Camel and Caravan, each equally adept at integrating the sound of the flute), Midlake never patronize their audience. A seven piece band playing essentially quiet music in a loud environment is always going to be a challenge, but Midlake, expressing undying love for Pompey, pulled it off in charmingly understated manner. When will Bella Union go wrong?\n\nEastleigh Music Festival\n\nLeigh Park Eastleigh\n\n10  11/ 7 / 10\n\nThe sun shone on Eastleigh’s two-day music festival at Leigh Park. Friday’s Folk Night featured, for all but the most devout folkies, a slight surfeit of fiddles and squeeze boxes. The likes of Cara Dillon (great when unaccompanied) and Lau (great when slow and majestic) too often allowed things to lapse with the dreaded words ”Now for some jigs and reels”. Saturday daytime featured a host of local bands playing for free. The quality inevitably varied but of particular note were Winchester’s flamboyant Scarlet Soho and the casual excellence of Our Lost Infantry, a real find from Aldershot. The evening showcase highlighted the super-precision suites of Field Music. The music of the multi-instrumentalist Brewis brothers is ultra-cerebral but manages not to be too clever for its own good. As for Badly Drawn Boy, the disappointment was painful. Accompanied by a band made up of road crew and complete with cheesy drum machine and lyric crib sheet, he sought to blame his hapless performance on the sound crew (who had been impeccable all weekend). Badly Performing Boy, more like. Nothing, however, should take away from the impeccable organization of this hugely enjoyable event, which continued throughout the joyous Mela on the Sunday.\n\nShearwater\n\nRailway Inn, Winchester\n\nAugust 1, 2010\n\nView: Nearly suffocating\n\nFor a band whose main antecedents are Spirit Of Eden-era Talk Talk, i.e. deadly serious and willfully uncommercial, Austin’s Shearwater have some enthusiastic and energetic supporters. The band take the most enjoyable elements of prog, namely multiple time changes and incessant swopping of obscure instruments, but leave out the annoying noodling bits. Any band whose singer has a degree in ornithology and whose drummer is an Axl Rose lookalike called Thor, who doubles on oboe, can’t fail to be interesting. Jonathan Meiburg is the unlikeliest of rock stars but his startling voice range generates enormous intensity. The audience, already stunned (in a nice way) by having German improvisational classical pianist Nils Frahm as support act, vascillated between enthusiastic idiot dancing on songs such as Hidden Lakes and rapt attention during the glockenspiel battle between Thor and bassist Kim Burke on Corridors, both from their latest pastoral epic The Golden Archipelago. It all sounds very unlikely but it adds up to a quite thrilling musical experience.\n\nRead More\n\nIf you cant be bothered to read VOLUME (available from Amazon.co.uk), the gig list provides a summary of the horrors contained within. Just read this instead.\n\nThis selective list is far from being exhaustive. Several hundred were crummy pub-rock bands which have not been listed because they were not of sufficient merit. Lots of gigs have got lost in the mists of time. For example, I know for a fact that I saw the Blue Aeroplanes at least eight times but I cant identify a single precise date.\n\nFor bands like The Time, the Outsiders and the Agency which I saw repeatedly, only a few selected shows are mentioned.\n\nGigs by the bands I managed (Thieves Like Us and The Secret) are not listed.\n\nFestivals include only some of the bands I actually saw at them.\n\nSudden gaps indicate managing bands, bringing up children or sojourns abroad.\n\n* indicates that I cant remember the exact date.\n\nI calculate that this list represents about 75 percent of the actual gigs I have attended.\n\nComplete accuracy is not guaranteed. Anyone spotting errors is invited to correct them.\n\n1964\n\n*The Hollies, Cheltenham Town Hall\n\nQuiffs intact. Graham Nash played an unamplified acoustic guitar.\n\n*The Sharks, Schöningen, Germany (several times)\n\nUnfeasible trousers but great R & B.\n\n1965\n\n*The Hollies, Cheltenham Town Hall\n\nWe sat on chairs positioned round the edge of the dancefloor and didnt dare ask anyone to dance.\n\n1966\n\n*TJ – Tours, France\n\nTJ, a black American organist, played in the same club every night for a month. He claimed to have written Night of a Thousand Dances.\n\n1968 – 1969\n\n*The Young Tradition, University of East Anglia, Norwich (13.2.68)\n\nEarly exposure to finger-in-the-ear folk.

Frogg, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nHammond Heaven.\n\n*Mike Cotton Sound with Lucas, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nBetter than Geno Washington but not half as famous.\n\n*Herbie Goins and the Night Timers, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nMore of the same: UK soul.\n\n*Jimmie James and the Vagabonds, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nAnd again, but with a white singer.\n\n*Elmer Gantrys Velvet Opera, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nGetting near to psychedelia now.\n\n* Bonzo Dog Doo-Da Band / Roy Harper, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nThe original line-up. Not as funny onstage as on record.\n\n*Third Ear Band / Ron Geesin, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nEveryone sat on the floor, including the band.\n\n*Jeff Beck Band, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nRod the Mod long before he was crap.\n\n*The Move, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nA truly great band. Even Carl Wayne acted the part.\n\n*Savoy Brown, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nThey got big in the States because the Americans have such good taste.\n\n*The Pyramids, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nInnocent, up-tempo reggae.\n\n*Spooky Tooth, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nSunshine Help Me.\n\n*Moody Blues, Royal Festival Hall, London (29.6.68)\n\nThey did make a good album, once. Pity about the moustaches.\n\n*Tyrannosaurus Rex, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nElfin-like, thats what they always say about Marc.\n\n*Cream Farewell Concert, Royal Albert Hall, London (26.11.68)\n\nDidnt they go on.\n\n*Deviants, Progressive Club, Norwich\n\nYes, but could they play their instruments?\n\n*Pink Floyd / Fairport Convention, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nSome double bill!\n\n*Joe Cocker and the Grease Band, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nI predicted he would go solo. He did.\n\n*Free, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nOne of the most perfectly-formed bands of all time.\n\n*The Nice / The Idle Race, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nNever mention Roy Wood to Jeff Lynne.\n\n*Fairport Convention, University of East Anglia, Norwich (8.3.69)\n\nWed seen them at Colchester in the interim. Sandy Denny told me to fuck off.\n\n*Roland Kirk, University of East Anglia, Norwich (11.7.69)\n\nOr rather, Rahsaan Roland. Never did get into jazz.\n\n*Fleetwood Mac, Industrial Club, Norwich\n\nThey almost made our ears bleed and Mick Fleetwood wore a pair of wooden testicles on a string.\n\n*Chris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds, Teacher Training College, Norwich\n\nI think Albert Lee was in the band.\n\n*The Barbecue, Earlham Park, Norwich with The Hollies, Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky Mick and Tich, Soft Machine, Marmalade and others. (10.5.69)\n\nWhat did the students think of us? – Er …\n\n*Blind Faith, Hyde Park, London (7.6.69)\n\nIf I hadnt rescued Stevie from the pond, this band would never have been formed.\n\n*The Rolling Stones, Hyde Park, London (5.7.69)\n\nOkay, see you in Hyde Park then.\n\n*Arrival, Rolle College, Exmouth\n\nThey had just had a big hit with Friends: We all have friends who have friends by the river. No we dont.\n\n*Mogul Thrash, Rolle College, Exmouth\n\nA bit like the Average White Band with guitar solos. Probably the best band John Wetton was ever in.\n\n*Osibisa, Rolle College, Exmouth\n\nDont talk about my girlfriend like that, I should have said.\n\n*Blossom Toes, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nJim Cregan, later Rod Stewarts guitarist,was the leader of this sweetly-named combo.\n\n*Bakerloo, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nWell-smoothed Dave Clempsons priceless trio.\n\n*Jon Hisemans Colosseum, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nToo much in the way of soloing, especially the old double saxophone bit.\n\nLate 1969\n\n4. November: Spooky Tooth, Mensa am Westring, Kiel, Germany\n\nLuckily, rugby songs are a rarity in Germany.\n\n15. November: Ten Years After, Chicken Shack, Ernst-Merck-Halle, Hamburg\n\nHes fast, isnt he? And that Chistine Perfect was a bit of all right.\n\n12. December: Bach Weihnachtsoratorium, St-Johanniskirche, Lüneburg\n\nThe only classical concert Ive been to in my life. I coughed all the way through and a nice old lady gave me a sweetie.\n\n1970\n\n3. January: Aspidistra Flying Blues Band, Blue Note, Wilhelmshaven\n\nWho? Well, I was there and it was bloody cold.\n\n7. January: Hardin and York, Mensa am Westring, Kiel, Germany\n\nThe Worlds Smallest Big Band.\n\n21. January: Soft Machine, Mensa am Westring, Kiel, Germany\n\nRobert Wyatt did his funny falsetto bit.\n\n10. March: Steamhammer, Mensa am Westring, Kiel, Germany\n\nWhatever did happen to Steamhammer?\n\n10. April: Renaissance, Mensa am Westring, Kiel, Germany\n\nRather nice pastoral sounds from Keith Relf and his sister Jane.\n\n15. April: The Flock, Ernst-Merck-Halle, Hamburg\n\nThe Sound of the Seventies, said the ticket. Jerry Goodman ended up in the Mahavishnu orchestra.\n\n22. May: Hardin and York, Mensa am Westring, Kiel, Germany\n\nThe ticket price had gone up by 2 DM in four months. This can happen when youre Big In Germany.\n\n28. May: Deep Purple, Ostseehalle, Kiel, Germany\n\nThe support was Alex Harvey. I thought he was brilliant but the audience hated him. A sign\n\nof things to come?\n\n21 / 22 June: Hamburg Big Gig Festival: Colosseum, Black Sabbath, Famiuy, Rare Bird, Humble Pie, Uriah Heep, Gentle Giant\n\nWe slept under that stars and woke up covered in dew.\n\n10. July: Free, Spektrum Club, Kiel, Germany\n\nPaul Rodgers pinched a bottom to celebrate the bands first hit.\n\n25. September: Caravan / Jackson Heights, City Hall, Salisbury\n\nAn outing from the farm. The support was Lee Jackson from the Nice, but there was hardly anyone there.\n\n21. December: Strawbs / Hardin and York / Al Stewart, Royal Albert Hall, London\n\nA benefit for the Conservation Society. An ill-matched bill failed to create much atmosphere.\n\n1971\n\nMarch 23: Yes, Norwich Lads Club\n\nWhat was the name of that irritating acoustic solo Steve Howe used to do?\n\nApril 4: Bronco, University of East Anglia, Norwich\n\nIt may be a loo roll to you, but to me it was my introduction to Jess Roden.\n\nApril 30: Michael Chapman, Norwich Folk Festival\n\nAnd hes still on the road right now.\n\nMay 12th: Traffic, Norwich Lads Club\n\nIt looked like members of this band would soon start to die. They did.\n\n1972\n\n*MC5: Edo-Osterloh-Haus, Kiel, Germany\n\nExcuse me, what means Kick Out Ze Jemms, Muzzerfuckers?\n\n*Man: Edo-Osterloh-Haus, Kiel, Germany\n\nYou thought the Manics were the original Welsh windbags? No, Man were.\n\n*Alexis Korner: Pupille, Kiel, Germany\n\nI couldnt afford to go but I heard it through the floor.\n\n*Frumpy, Förde-Hochhaus, Eckernförde, Germany\n\nInga Rumpf, Frumpys singer, is now a Christian evangelist.\n\n*Brian Auger Trinity / Status Quo, Stadthalle, Neumünster\n\nQuo were cool. No longer a pop band and not yet a joke.\n\n1973\n\n*Free, Colston Hall, Bristol (15.10.73)\n\nHeartbreaking performance to promote Heartbreaker.\n\n*Rory Gallagher: Colston Hall, Bristol (31.10.73)\n\nA nice line in lumberjack shirts.\n\n1974\n\n*Stackridge, Victoria Rooms, Bristol\n\nThe Stanley is for you and me. Mutter Slater wisely declined to take part in 1999s misguided reunion.\n\n*John Entwistles Ox, Bristol University\n\nHowever did they get all that equipment up to the first floor?\n\n18. September: Deep Purple, Stadthalle, Bremen, Germany\n\nIm afraid I always thought that Ritchie Blackmore was over-rated.\n\n27. October: Nektar, Stadthalle, Bremen, Germany\n\nDeutsch-Rock vom Feinsten.\n\n4. November: Gong, Post-Aula, Bremen, Germany\n\nFeaturing Steve Hillage in woolly hat mode.\n\n12. December: Mungo Jerry, Revolution, Bremen, Germany\n\nFantastic! Someone in the audience kept buying the band Jägermeister and they kept drinking and playing until they could no longer stand. The next night, the club burned down.\n\n16. December: The Sweet, Stadthalle, Bremen, Germany\n\nMy snobby friends refused to attend on the basis that the Sweet were a teenybop band. Nonsense! Fabulous glam rock, with the drummer having a drum battle with a back projection of himself. They beat the Flaming Lips to this concept by 25 years.\n\n* Alice Cooper, Stadthalle, Bremen, Germany\n\nThis was the classic Steve Hunter / Dick Wagner line-up featuring a guitar battle that drew blood.\n\n1975\n\n29. January: Soft Machine, University of Bremen, Germany\n\nRobert Wyatt did his funny falsetto thing (again).\n\n12. March: Country Joe and the Fish, University of Bremen, Germany\n\nIt wasnt exactly Woodstock revisited.\n\n9. May: Genesis, Stadthalle, Bremen, Germany\n\nThe Lamb Lay Down on Broadway.\n\n18. August: Kevin Coyne, Post-Aula, Bremen, Germany\n\nAndy Summers was in this band.\n\n27. September: Camel, Reithalle, Cloppenburg\n\nI put up posters in Bremen to advertise this. We had to sit on bales of hay and pick our way carefully though the horse shit.\n\n29. October: The Who, Stadthalle, Bremen, Germany\n\nJust what the doctor ordered! The main story in the local paper detailed how Moonie smashed up Bremens poshest hotel.\n\n1976\n\n8. February: Status Quo, Stadthalle, Oldenburg, Germany\n\nThird time lucky (?) after the previous two shows had been cancelled.\n\n27. February: Uriah Heep, Stadthalle, Oldenburg, Germany\n\nI had a row with Birgits sister-in-law after she falsely claimed that David Byron was a good singer.\n\n14. March: Udo Lindenberg, Stadthalle, Bremen, Germany\n\nWhat a shame this great character didnt catch on outside Germany. At one stage, he even recorded an album in English, but to no avail.\n\n4. May: The Rolling Stones, Stadthalle, Bremen, Germany\n\nI recall that they had a giant penis.\n\n2. June: Smokie, Dorfhalle, Ritterhude, Germany\n\nSometimes, one gets desperate.\n\n21. June: Rolling Stones, Knebworth\n\nI think they were there somewhere.\n\n23. July: Heavy Metal Kids / XTC, Brunel Rooms, Swindon\n\nI dont remember what I was doing when JFK died, but I do remember what I was doing when Gary Holton died. XTC played All Along The Watchtower, incidentally.\n\nAugust: Reading Festival 1976 with Rory Gallagher, Gong, Van Der Graaf Generator, Camel, The Enid, Black Oak Arkansas\n\nThe year the Enid took the festival by storm! No, honestly.\n\n17. October: Jess Roden Band, Southampton University\n\nFunky British soul. His backing band came from Southampton, you know.\n\n29. November: Kiki Dee, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nShe was briefly able to fill theatres like this. Kiki had an appealing vulnerability.\n\n1. December: Caravan, Southampton University\n\nFor Girls Who Grow Plump In The Night.\n\n10. December: Steeleye Span, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nThey should have kept it under their Hat.\n\n17. December: Manfred Manns Earth Band, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nBig In Germany.\n\n1977\n\n28. January: Supercharge / Ultravox, Southampton University\n\nThis was the original Ultravox with John Foxx (better than any subsequent versions).\n\n9. February: Jethro Tull, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nFlamingos can stand on one leg as well.\n\n13. February: SAHB without Alex Harvey, Top Rank, Southampton\n\nClever name, eh? Quite good even without the main man, because of Zal Cleminson.\n\n5. March: Pat Travers Band / Doctors of Madness, Reading University\n\nThe doctor had a bassist called Stoner who dressed up in a skeleton suit.\n\n9. March: Graham Parker and the Rumour, Guildhall, Portsmouth\n\nBrinsley Schwarz is a cool name, dont you think?\n\n15. March: Gordon Giltrap, Southampton University\n\nThere must be better things to do with a guitar.\n\n21. March: Bandit, Village Bowl, Bournemouth\n\nI went because dear old James Litherland was in the band. The singer was Jim Diamond, who later had a hit with I Should Have Known Better.\n\n13. April: Tribo, Mirandela, Portugal\n\nHiching though Portugal, I was befriended by this band which specialised in Camel covers! They gave a performance specially for me (which can happen if you are an Englishman abroad). The bassist Manuel is still a good friend today.\n\n4. May: Widowmaker, Souhampton University\n\nSuper-cool, motionless Luther Grosvenor had turned into crazed glam-rock axeman Ariel Bender.\n\n7. May: Ian Gillan Band, Southampton University\n\nI got to interview the man who has more brain that meets the eye.\n\n11. May: Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, King Alfreds College, Winchester\n\nIm probably prouder to have been at this gig than at any other ever. The appeal escaped most of the assembled student teachers, however.\n\n20. May: The Damned / The Adverts, Southampton University\n\nMark Eitzel of American Music Club was at this gig. Not that I knew that.\n\n27. May: Queen, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nThe tickets cost £2. What a rip-off.\n\n4. June: Caravan, Farnborough Recreation Centre\n\nNever go and see a band at a recreation centre.\n\n16. June: 10CC, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nApart from Eric Stewart, they just couldnt look the part.\n\n21. July: Weeke Jokes, Henry Beaufort School, Winchester\n\nMy band, man.\n\n30. June: Roger Ruskin Spear, Southampton University\n\nHe had a Kinetic Wardrobe.\n\n3. July: Bad Company, Earls Court, London\n\nThe end of the affair. Paul Rodgers was already putting on weight and wore a stetson, for goodness sake.\n\n6. July: Crawler / Boxer / Moon, Guildhall, Portsmouth\n\nWhat they call a package show. Roll on recycling.\n\n21. July: Roogalator, Winchester Art School\n\nChunky R & B from Danny Adler.\n\n12 August: Freshly Layed Band, Queen Inn, Burley\n\nThe introduction.\n\nAugust: Reading Festival 1977 with Thin Lizzy, Graham Parker, Nazareth, Ultravox, Electric Chairs, Racing Cars, The Enid, The Motors\n\nThe Motors had some of the most expensive promotion any band has ever received. It didnt help them much.\n\n25. September: The BA, Riverside Inn, Winchester\n\nBus Garage Café, well its okay.\n\n29. September: Camel, Southampton Gaumont\n\nWell, I honestly thought the Snow Goose was good.\n\n30. September: Kursaal Flyers, Southampton University\n\nNot very exciting pub rock promoted above its station.\n\n1. October: The BA, King Alfreds Boys Club, Winchester\n\nFirst and last gig at this youth club. (There was a minor riot.)\n\n2. October: The Pirates, Glen Eyre Hall, Southampton\n\nWhod have thought dear old Mick Green would end up at the Cavern with Macca? Good choice, though.\n\n4. October: Ian Gillan Band, Guildhall, Portsmouth\n\nTheir bassist appeared to be a heavyweight wrestler.\n\n8. October: Freshly Layed Band, The White Buck, Burley\n\nFirst of many trips into a forest hippie enclave.\n\n11. October: Throbbing Gristle, Winchester Art School\n\nI remember it well. Not many tunes, but Cosey Fanni Tutti looked a picture.\n\n12. October: Phil Manzaneras 801, Southampton University\n\nGood album but he never followed it up properly.\n\n18. October: Dr Feelgood, Portsmouth Guildhall\n\nGot to interview Lee Brilleaux, now in the Great Travel Lodge In The Sky.\n\n19. October: Racing Cars, Southampton University\n\nThey had some kind of hit.\n\n26. October: Caravan, Southampton University\n\nStill out to pasture. Do you know that Pye Hastings is now a sales rep?\n\n27. October: Wishbone Ash / The Motors, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nWe got in on account of the aforementioned massive promotional push being given to the Motors. (Push the Motors, geddit?)\n\n15. November: Status Quo, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nAt the end of the show, their leads were all tied up in a knot in the middle of the stage.\n\n26. November: The Ba, Winchester Art College\n\nSomeone took a great photo of this.\n\n28. November: Wilco Johnson, Village Bowl, Bournemouth\n\nIt surely cant have been worth the journey?\n\n6. December: Freshly Layed Band, Riverside Inn, Winchester\n\nWatch those floorboards.\n\n7. December: Thin Lizzy, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nOn the ticket, it said Thin Lizzie.\n\n1978\n\n6. January: The Enid, Basingstoke Technical College\n\nAt the time, they seemed revolutionary. They actually played Land of Hope and Glory and (blush) I actually enjoyed it!\n\n22. January: Rich Kids, Glen Eyre Hall, Southampton\n\nIf only Midge Ure had got frozen in this state. Mind you, they were furious at people gobbing at them, and quite right too.\n\n25. January: Talking Heads / Dire Straits, Southampton University\n\nThat is not a misprint. The tickets cost £1 each.\n\n3. February: Tyla Gang, King Alfreds College, Winchester\n\nThats Sean Tyla, not Liv Tyla.\n\n6. February: Split Enz, Southampton University\n\nBefore they wuz Crowded House. Better, too.\n\n11. February: Colosseum II, South Stoneham Hall, Southampton\n\nGary Moore was in this band.\n\n18. February: Krazy Kat, King Alfreds College, Winchester\n\nIn perfect harmony (but not with the Ents Officer).\n\n19. February: The Enid, Victoria Palace, London\n\nDid we really do this?\n\n24. February: The Soft Boys, Winchester Art School\n\nWading through a ventilator.\n\n27. February: Rush, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nWhat about the voice of Geddy Lee, how does he sing so high?\n\n11. March: Freshly Layed Band, Riverside Inn, Winchester\n\nSlight return.\n\n15. March: Eddie and the Hot Rods, Top Rank, Southampton\n\nBarrie Masters did some good acrobatics on the lighting rig.\n\n17. March: David Coverdale Band, Basingstoke Technical College\n\nThis is definitely a misprint.\n\n22. March: John Miles, Village Bowl, Bournemouth\n\nMusic is my first love, and it will be my last.\n\n30. March: Freshly Layed Band, White Buck, Burley\n\nFor the sake of the rainforests, an editorial decision has been taken at this stage not to mention the rest of the Freshly Layed gigs we attended (17 in all).\n\n2. April: The Soft Boys, Nashville, London\n\nRobyn Hitchcock didnt recognise me.\n\n17. April: Manfred Manns Earth Band, Guildhall, Portsmouth\n\nStill big in Germany.\n\n25. April: Graham Parker and the Rumour, Mecca Ballroom, Portsmouth\n\nHold back the night.\n\n26. April: Rory Gallagher, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nNot a lot different from last time.\n\n29. April: UK, Southampton University\n\nThat Bill Bruford, he can play a bit.\n\n5. May: The Tubes, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nA novelty band which can really play, thats rare.\n\n12. May: Lesser Known Tunisians, The Saints, Southampton\n\nFirst encounter with Wickhams answer to North Africa.\n\n18. May: Steve Hillage, Poole Arts Centre\n\nSurely it wasnt the same woolly hat?\n\n19. May: Lesser Known Tunisians, Tower Arts Centre, Winchester\n\nWe promoted this one.\n\n3. June: Black Sabbath, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nAnother misprint.\n\n4. June: Sham 69 / Stratejacket, Top Rank, Southampton\n\nLike Madness later, Sham 69 didnt deserve their awful fans.\n\n17. June: The Blades, Riverside Inn, Winchester\n\nPreviously the Amazorblades.\n\n29. June: Lesser Known Tunisians, Old Mill, Holbury\n\nThe night of the Sounds review.\n\n30. June: Artemis, Cricklade College, Andover\n\nGreg Watkins was still playing Camel covers.\n\n15. July: The Picnic, Blackbushe Airport, with Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Joan Armatrading.\n\nFirst ever laminate on a string!\n\n16. July: Whirlwind, Jumpers Tavern, Christchurch\n\nGot a rather nice free T-shirt from this rockabilly band.\n\n26 – 28 August: Reading Festival 1978 with Spirit, The Motors, Status Quo, Sham 69, The Jam, Patti Smith Group\n\nA rather unpleasant atmosphere reigned, as the line-up might lead one to anticipate.\n\n16. September: Staa Marx, Winchester Rugby Club\n\nThe sons of Mrs Aardvark. They were great.\n\n20 September: The Polar Bears, The Cricketers, Winchester\n\nSupport came from the Erections, one of whose members was called Dr. R. Slicker.\n\n21. September: 10CC, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nI decided that Dreadlock Holiday was a dodgy piece of racism. Im not in Love with 10CC any more.\n\n23. September: Camel, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nThe Breathless tour, first sticky Backstage Pass!\n\n26. September: The Stranglers, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nNow thats what I call a band.\n\n29. September: The Warm Jets, Riverside Inn, Winchester\n\nNothing to do with Brian Eno and nothing to do with the Nineties Warm Jets either. There you go.\n\n6. October: Thieves Like Us, Riverside Inn, Winchester\n\nLiterally a life-altering experience.\n\n11. October: Climax Blues Band / Fabulous Poodles, Southampton University\n\nThis was the sort of strangely mis-matched double bill which was around in those days. I am certain that the other support was Elvis Costellos Flip City, but I cant prove it.\n\n20. October: Press-Ups, Riverside Inn, Winchester\n\nOne of our less wildly successful promotions.\n\n21. October: Identical Strangers, Tower Arts Centre, Winchester\n\nThey begged me to review the gig and then moaned when they didnt like what it said.\n\n27. October: Staa Marx, Riverside Inn, Winchester\n\nBognor rock.\n\n28. October: Boomtown Rats, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nIt must be said, he didnt look like a future knight of the realm.\n\n3. November: The Enid, Basingstoke Technical College\n\nOh, come on.\n\n25. November: The Aliens / Hazzard, Theatre Royal, Winchester\n\nThe first show for a decade at this un-renovated theatre. When people danced, they stirred up so much dust that you couldnt see the stage. Or it could have been dry ice.\n\n6. December: Ian Gillan, Southampton University\n\nThe all-in wrestler was still there.\n\n23. December: Tours, Brewers Arms, Poole\n\nSomething stirs in Poole. Tourist Information, please.\n\n1979\n\n10. February: Supercharge, South Stoneham Hall, Southampton\n\nThere was a bloke with a beard who played sax.\n\n14. February: Gruppo Sportivo, Southampton University\n\nThey didnt sound Dutch, but they were.\n\n3. March: Fischer-Z, Southampton University\n\nBig In Germany, but this time deservedly so.\n\n4. March: Van Morrison, Portsmouth Guildhall\n\nPeter Bardens was playing with Van this time around.\n\n16. March: Screeens, Salisbury Technical College\n\nYes, thats three es. Thieves Like Us supported.\n\n21. March: The Hollies, Portsmouth Guildhall\n\nThere is a place for nostalgia.\n\n22. March: Graham Parker and the Rumour, Southampton Guildhall\n\nMy friend Volker called him a little weasel. A tad unfair, I thought. Possibly a stoat.\n\n23. March: Freshly Layed Band, Bournemouth Town Hall\n\nThis was their last ever gig. Come and get the rest of the Ploughmans!\n\n24. March: Identical Srangers, Crown Hotel, Eastleigh\n\nThey wanted me to re-assess them. There were only two other people in the audience.\n\n4. May: Mark Andrews and the Gents / The Lens, Top Rank, Southampton\n\nCharity show. The Lens became IQ, a quite well-known prog-rock band.\n\n5. May: The Enid, South Stoneham Hall, Southampton\n\nBackstage was fun for a change, because they were breaking up and yelling at each other in a most ungentlemanly way.\n\n11. May: XTC, Glen Eyre Hall, Southampton\n\nI could see that Andy Partridge had stage fright. No, really. It takes one phobic to know another.\n\n15. May: Mark Andrews and the Gents, Portsmouth Polytechnic\n\nAlthough the personnel kept changing, this band was always great.\n\n19. May: Piranhas, John Peel, Gosport\n\nFirst of many sightings of these dangerous creatures.\n\n30. May: The Tubes, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nStill good musicians. Still high heels.\n\n7. June: 64 Spoons, Old Mill, Holbury\n\nI think they had a famous guitarist.\n\n8. June: Writz, Bishop Otter College, Chichester\n\nWe went to check out the venue for a forthcoming Thieves gig. It turned out to be a formal ball, so we stood out a bit!\n\n9. June: Mungo Jerry, King Alfreds College, Winchester\n\nThey were sober. How disappointing.\n\n23 June: Eric Bell Band, Theatre Royal, Winchester\n\nGrand re-opening of the venue. After The Fire cancelled and this was a poor substitute.\n\n5. July: Joe Jackson, Locarno, Portsmouth\n\nA meteoric rise from the John Peel, Gosport\n\n13. July: The Stranglers, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nThey didnt exactly have a charismatic stage show.\n\n26. July: Lip Moves, Knights, Eastleigh\n\nLocal band which might have made good.\n\n12. August: Nightshift, Jumpers Tavern, Christchurch\n\nThe new band of Roger Fatman Hunt from Freshly Layed.\n\n27. August: Last Orders, Magnums, Basingstoke\n\nI think I reviewed this one.\n\nAugust: Reading Festival 1979 with The Cure, Motörhead, The Police, Cheap Trick, Peter Gabriel, The Ramones\n\nThese were the Readings we liked.\n\n1. September: The Outsiders, Pinecliff, Bournemouth\n\nThis time it was Tim Holt from Freshly Layed who had a new band.\n\n10. September: Patrik Fitzgerald, Melkweg, Amsterdam\n\nThe Thieves sent me and Birgit to Amsterdam to recover from the strain. We sat behind Bob Geldof and Paula Yates in the tram.\n\n27. September: Leo Sayer, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nMerely in the line of duty.\n\n28. September: Siouxsie and the Banshees, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nThis must have been shortly before the split.\n\n29. September: The Outsiders, Pinecliff, Bournemouth\n\nThey wrote songs then that the Agency still play today.\n\n5. October: Camel, Poole Arts Centre\n\nAutographed backstage pass! Unfortunately there were hardly any original members left.\n\n17. October: Camel, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nAnd it isnt shome mishtake.\n\n31. October: Caravan, Southampton University\n\nA sales rep. Honest!\n\n2. November: Tours / Martian Schoolgirls, Tower Arts Centre, Winchester\n\nFateful show. We promoted this one and some of the audience abused the venue. My relationship with the venues director hasnt recovered to this day.\n\n18. November: The Jam / The Vapors, Poole Arts Centre\n\nNot that long before, the Vapors had been at the Old Mill, Holbury.\n\n25. November: The Enid, Bournemouth Winter Gardens\n\nThey had turned into a parody of a parody.\n\n6. December: The Piranhas, Crown Hotel, Eastleigh\n\nI dont want my body (cos its so bloody shoddy)\n\n13. December: Last Orders, Crown Hotel, Eastleigh\n\nDefinitely reviewed this one for Musicians Only.\n\n16. December: The Police, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nOf course it was me they were screaming at.\n\n26. December: Blondie, Stateside Center, Bournemouth\n\nOne of the most joyful gigs ever.\n\n1980\n\n1. February: Merger, Basingstoke Technical College\n\nThieves supported. There were gigantic day-glo posters, but not a gigantic day-glo audience.\n\n3. February: Tom Robinsons Sector 27, Poole Arts Centre\n\nA lunchtime gig!\n\n8. February: Renaissance, Southampton University\n\nOne of those bands of imposters.\n\n10. February: The Clash, Poole Arts Centre\n\nThe backstage pass was quite useful because it was a battlefield out front.\n\n28. February: Joe Jackson, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nI disapproved of the acapella Is She Really Going Out With Him? but now I realise it was quite good.\n\n3. March: Gillan, Southampton University\n\nAnother interview. Whatever did we talk about?\n\n13. February: The Clash, Top Rank, Southampton\n\nNo backstage pass, but a safe spot on the balcony. Below, it looked like the pitch at Twickenham.\n\n14. February: Bobby Henry and the Risk, Knights, Eastleigh\n\nThey could have gone far. They didnt.\n\n27. February: The Tourists, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nI couldnt understand why such a crummy band had such a high profile.\n\n15. March: The Limos, The Saints, Southampton\n\nThis was an ambitious musician called Mark Easton. He later joined Mark Andrews and the Gents.\n\n19. March: The HGBs, Railway Inn, Winchester\n\nChris Willey from Attic Theatre put together this R & B band.\n\n10. May: Inside Story, Jumpers Tavern, Christchurch\n\nRoger Hunt had already moved on from Nightshift.\n\n22. May: Da Biz, Brewers Arms, Poole\n\nRonnie Mayor from Tours with a new but very similar band.\n\n31. May: Mark Andrews and the Gents, Portsmouth Polytechnic\n\nThey were so professional they made me jealous.\n\n3. June: Whitesnake / Gary Moores G-Force, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nI cant really explain this.\n\n27. June: John Otway / Wild Willy Barrett, The Griffin, Southampton\n\nYou needed to take out personal insurance to be in this audience.\n\n22-24 July: Reading Festival 1980 with Samson, Iron Maiden, Slade, Whitesnake, Def Leppard\n\nReviewed it for Musicians Only! Favourite occupation: Dodge the Piss Bottles.\n\n8. August: The Blazers, The Saints, Southampton\n\nGood name. Cant remember the band.\n\n20. August: The Time, Plough, Durrington\n\nThe beginning of a long and happy relationship.\n\n22. September: Ebony Rockers, Top Rank, Southampton\n\nCharity show with good local reggae band.\n\n26. October: Joe Jackson, Bournemouth Winter Gardens\n\nId forgiven him by then. Shouldnt have doubted him in the first place.\n\n4. November: Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nThey were boring and lightweight. Synth-pop, nein danke.\n\n13. November: Sad Café, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nThey had a singer called Paul Young. How confusing.\n\n18. October: The Time, Waterlooville Football Club\n\nBig venue. Were they going to break through?\n\n29. October: Exploding Seagulls / Bitter Lemmings: Solent Suite, Southampton\n\nOne of many gigs I attended (lost the details of the others) promoted by an enterprising label called Stick It In Your Ear.\n\n13. November: The League of Gentlemen, Royal Exeter Hotel, Bournemouth\n\nRobert Fripp on home ground. Very intense, naturally.\n\n15. November: The Enid, Town Hall, Eastleigh\n\nDown and very nearly out.\n\n24. November: The Damned, Gaumont, Southampton\n\nYes Yes Yes! Neat Neat Neat!\n\n30. November: The Planets, John Peel, Gosport\n\nSuper band which I assume was messed up by the"
