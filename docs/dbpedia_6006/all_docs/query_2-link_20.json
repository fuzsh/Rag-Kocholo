        "text": "Originally Posted by Inventernet\n\nYep, that's true Portlander's are about the only Americans who don't complain about the weather. In fact they appreciate the fact that the rain keeps London's park flourishing. The endless clouds brings smiles to their faces. Except of course Portland has those mountains and vegetation. It was compared to Zurich by the economist.. I think it being known as the beer capital of America it could be compared to Munich if only for that. I would say I ageee with Amsterdam as well.\n\nThe article is titled Portland and Elite Cities.\n\nPortland and\n\nThe comparison to Zurich is humorous.\n\nIt's also compared to \"Freiburg, in Germany, with its similar obsessions about recycling, sustainability, public transit and bicycling.\" German cities tend to have lots of greenery as well.\n\nOriginally Posted by bumpstr\n\nI have heard that London comparison before and it's simply not accurate. London is much cooler and wetter in summertime. London is similar in temperature in winter, but it's actually drier.\n\nLondon's average high temperature in August is about 73 degrees and they get 2 inches of rain in that month. Portland on the other hand gets up to 81 degrees on average with less than an inch of rain.\n\nLondon's January average high is 47 degrees with, again, 2 inches of rain. In Portland, the high temperature averages 47 degrees, but we get nearly 5 inches of rain.\n\nPortland's weather is closer to parts of Spain, France and Italy than England."
