That's why our wine is great here too!\" Every weekend in the Fall, I get muddy in local bike races then go home to watch similar races taking place around Belgium, with similar weather and I've often wondered how my latitude compared with theirs.\n\nNow I know that latitude determines length of daylight pretty consistently but isn't a great comparison to weather -- The west coast of the US has a cold ocean current and a jet stream to match while the Atlantic that makes up the west coasts of the European continent has a warmer ocean current and different weather to match. Still, it's interesting when making rough comparisions to know if Los Angeles is really like the south of France/Italy (it's actually in Northern Africa, latitude-wise), and I've wondered ever since a friend moved to Helsinki if that was as far north as our Alaskan cities (it is).\n\nToday I asked on Ask MetaFilter and a GIS expert member whipped up exactly the maps I envisioned.\n\nHere are major European cities overlaid on North America, corrected for the identical latitude:\n\nHere are North American cities, overlaid on Western Europe and Northern Africa at the identical latitude:"
