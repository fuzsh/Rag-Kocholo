        "text": "The gateway to the Black Forest, Freiburg im Breisgau — simply called ‘Freiburg’ — is famously beautiful. Perched on the banks of the Dreisam River, this red-roofed city has a long history as an intellectual, religious and commercial centre for the Upper Rhine region. The iconic Freiburg Minster, parts of which date back 800 years, has drawn visitors to the city for centuries. It’s within sight of many of the best places to stay in Freiburg, and continues to delight the culture buffs and outdoor enthusiasts who flock to the area throughout the year.\n\nFreiburg’s marvellous old town is appealingly walkable, and guided tours come highly recommended. Begin with the Gothic masterpiece that is the Freiburg Minster, and wind your way through narrow lanes lined with boutiques, cafés, taverns and residences. The Augustinermuseum, the Museum Natur und Mensch and the Planetarium Freiburg all house fascinating exhibits, whilst the charming Munsterplatz is ideal for a coffee and some people-watching in the sunshine.\n\nThis is reputedly Germany’s sunniest city, so there should be plenty of opportunity for riverside strolls, boat trips and cycle rides, as well as long, lazy lunches with Baden wines and craft beers. Many travellers see Freiburg as a springboard for adventures in the Black Forest, with hiking, mountain biking, horse riding, bird watching and climbing excursions within easy reach. The best places to stay in Freiburg are clustered around the old town, so we’d suggest returning to spend your evenings in the buzzy bars and eateries of its characterful streets — there’s superb regional fare to savour!\n\nThe Best Places to Stay in Freiburg\n\nFor Old Town Charm\n\nHotel Oberkirch is fabulously located in Freiburg's old town. Traditional interiors are clad in warm red and golden yellow tones, with floral wallpapers, sash windows and glittering chandeliers. The fine-dining restaurant serves mount-watering European cuisine, and has an extensive wine list. A romantic, old-school base just opposite the Minster.\n\nHotel Schwarzwälder Hof, run by a friendly family team, is another superb spot in the historic centre. Step off a cobbled lane into an atmospheric restaurant and antique-filled communal areas. By contrast, the large rooms are sleek and understated with clean lines, white-washed walls and patterned headboards. A stylish fusion of old and new, with great family rooms.\n\nKreuz Blume has just eight simple guest rooms, each with crisp white linens, wooden floors and pared-back, minimalist interiors in a heritage building. The intimate size, old town setting and fantastic regional restaurant make this a brilliant city choice.\n\nFor Contemporary Style\n\nThe Alex is a sleek, contemporary hotel with white and cream bedrooms boasting warm blue accents. Cosy up by the fire, or unwind with drinks on the terrace after of a day of exploring. Smart and stylish, this is a top spot for business travellers - complete with conference facilities - as well as for holidaymakers.\n\nFor Luxury\n\nColombi Hotel is an elegant grand dame of a hotel, with 112 rooms and suites on the edge of the old town, the best offering uninterrupted views of the Minster. Kick back in sophisticated communal spaces with an evening tipple or two before feasting on sensational cuisine at the Michelin-starred Zirbel and Falkenstube restaurant. Timeless luxury.\n\nFOR AN APARTMENT OR HOLIDAY HOUSE\n\nIf you'd prefer a self-catering option, we suggest that you visit our online partner Booking.com.\n\nTRAVEL INFORMATION\n\nFly to EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg, just across the border in neighbouring France, and journey 50 minutes by car, bus or train from there. Germany's extensive railway network connects Freiburg to other regional hubs, making journeys swift and simple.\n\nBaden-Württemburg is brilliant for a road trip! Contact our online partner Rentalcars if you would like to hire a car.\n\nVisit during the summer months for temperatures averaging around 24°C in July and August. You'll find fewer crowds and great hotel deals outside the school holidays in May or September, although these months are also slightly cooler.\n\nSTILL NOT SURE?\n\nExplore our list of all the best places to stay in Baden Baden.\n\nAlternatively, expand your search to see our pick of the best places to stay in Baden-Württemburg.\n\nOr contact one of our friendly Gurus for advice.\n\nWeather\n\nMonthly Weather in Freiburg"
