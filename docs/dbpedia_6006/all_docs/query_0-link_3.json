        "text": "Discussion\n\nAccording to the hygiene hypothesis, infections in early life protect from allergic diseases [1]. Even though indirect evidence for this hypothesis is plenty, direct investigations of the associations between infections and atopic conditions came to conflicting results. The majority of studies measuring indirect markers of infections like siblings and day care attendance has confirmed the hypothesis [2-4]. Studies measuring past infection via IgG antibodies more consistently observed inverse associations with atopic conditions [9,10] than studies measuring clinical infections [6,11,12]. Yet, positive antibody titres only measure past immune response of the organism with the infectious agent (infection) without any indication whether clinical disease had actually taken place. Infection often represents sub- clinical infection (without symptoms) rather than clinical infectious disease (with symptoms). Likewise in our study a high risk of exposure to acute respiratory infections is not a proxy for clinical diseases but more likely a proxy for infection, a combination of sub-clinical and clinical infection. In our cohort a high pre- and post-natal risk of exposure to respiratory infectious agents was associated with decreased frequencies of atopic conditions at age 5–14 years. Interpreting the current literature and our results, we propose that the previous negative findings of studies investigating the associations between clinical infections and atopic conditions [11,12] might have been due to the fact that those studies considered solely clinical diseases whereas clinical and sub-clinical infection (exposure to infectious agents) in early life might protect against atopic conditions. This concept might also explain the strong and consistent findings of sibling and day care effect [2-4] as both siblings and day care increase the risk of exposure to infections rather than representing clinical infections of the children. Moreover, this concept would be in line with consistent findings of inverse associations between non-pathogen microbial stimulations (endotoxin, pro-biotics, farming environment) and atopic conditions [8,17,18].\n\nAtopic conditions occur early in life. Therefore factors acting in early life or during pregnancy are thought to play an important role in the prevention of atopic diseases. The results of several studies indicate that exposure to factors related to the hygiene hypothesis before the first year of life confer more protection than exposures at a later age [3,4,6,8]. Responses of the immune system to specific allergens and endotoxin have been shown to start already in utero [5,7]. However, it is still not clear in which pre- or post-natal period exposure to infection is most effective in the prevention of atopic diseases. Most of the IgG studies were cross-sectional [9,10]. Therefore the time-sequence of events could not be established and methodological limitations such as recall bias were unavoidable. In our historical cohort study the observed protective effects of pre- and post-natal high risk of exposure to infectious agents on hay fever, specific and total sensitization at age 5–14 years were particularly pronounced in after birth periods. In relation to asthma and eczema this confinement was less clear. According to the current understanding early priming of the immune system might result in a lasting imbalance between Th1 and Th2 cells. Thus, it is assumed that microbial stimuli confer protection against allergies by the induction of \"protective\" Th1 immune responses. However, a physiological Th1 deficit exists at birth [19,20]. In addition, neonatal dendritic cells have a lower capacity to secrete IL-12, which is a key cytokine needed for the priming of Th1-responses [21,22]. Thus it is conceivable, that environmental factors may have a stronger impact in the first year of life as compared to foetal or neonatal periods. On the other hand, ARI most probably represent viral infections in the majority of cases. Therefore, it is still possible that bacterial stimuli or the combinations of bacterial and viral components or several bacterial species have a stronger impact also on foetal or neonatal immune responses. To our knowledge this is the first study that was able to examine the vulnerable period looking at both pre-natal and post-natal exposure periods.\n\nAnother unresolved issue is the type of infection which is thought to confer protection. Matricardi et al. found that inverse associations between number of older siblings and atopy were not completely mediated by hepatitis A antibodies and concluded that hepatitis A is not the only infection associated with low prevalence of atopy [9]. However, protective effects of infections have been mainly described for gastrointestinal infections [23]. In combination with observations of an increased risk of atopic diseases in children treated with antibiotics [12,24] and protective effects of pro-biotic nutrition [17] a main role of the gastrointestinal system is therefore assumed. This notion has further been fuelled by findings of positive associations between respiratory infections (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) and atopic diseases. Two explanations have been proposed. One assumes that RSV-infections primary damage the respiratory system. The other one sees RSV infection facilitated by primary predisposition or an already altered respiratory system [25]. However, there is also some evidence that the severity of respiratory tract infections might influence the direction of the observed effects on atopic conditions with less severe infections resulting in a decreased risk [6,26]. If lighter infections would be responsible for a protective effect on atopic diseases then our hypothesis that sub-clinical infections would also confer protection would fit. Moreover, protective effects might not be refined to gastro-intestinal infections."
