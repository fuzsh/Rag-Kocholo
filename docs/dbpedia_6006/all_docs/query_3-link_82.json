        "text": "A mountain in the Schwarzwald near Freiburg\n\nThe Schauinsland is a mountain in the Black Forest with an altitude of 1,284 meters, which makes it one of the highest peaks in the massif (the highest point being the Feldberg at 1,493 meters). It is located 10km southeast of Freiburg im Breisgau. Really close to the city, which makes it one of the favorite mountains of the Fribourg people, as well as one of their favorite places to walk!\n\nSchauinslandbahn, cable car from Horben\n\nIt is possible (and recommended) to reach the Schauinsland by taking the Schauinslandbahn, a gondola lift that was put into service in 1930 (and renovated since then, I assure you!) and that happens to be the longest continuous motion cable car in Germany. You will find here the practical information with the schedules and tariffs.\n\nIt is true that the Schauinslandbahn is quite long (it is 3.6km long and has a 746m difference in altitude), it takes about 20 minutes to go up or down! It is very pleasant because it allows to enjoy the landscape. When the weather is good, there is apparently a view of the Rhine valley and the vineyards of the Tuniberg and Kaiserstuhl. I didnâ€™t see much from my side but you could tell the beauty of the place!\n\nGourmet break in the Schauinsland restaurant\n\nThere are several restaurants in Schauinsland, but I tested the one located in the same building as the top station of the cable car, Die Bergstation. The room is already pleasant, especially the one with the fire place and the huge windows, offering certainly a magnificent panorama by good weather (for us it was a foggy day unfortunately!). There is also a beautiful terrace with a panoramic view.\n\nAs far as food is concerned, we can find some classic German food and I chose a schnitzel (which was very good) as well as an apple and walnut pie for a snack after the walk. Yes, it was necessary to warm up ðŸ˜›\n\nFamily outing or more sportive hike\n\nFour hiking trails start from the top station of the cable car (Tal station), so you can adapt your walk to your desires, your form and the weather. The smallest walk is 2.5km long, with 40 meters of positive elevation change, and the largest is 8.8km long with 770m of positive elevation change. You can find information about the different walks here (with GPX routes).\n\nDuring your walk or while making a small detour depending on the route you choose, donâ€™t miss the Eugen-Keidel tower (also called Schauinsland tower), located at the top of the mountain and measuring 31 meters high. It can be reached from the top station of the gondola by an easy 700m path. I regretted not being able to go up there, it was closed when I went, but considering the weather conditions that day I wouldnâ€™t have seen much anyway! In good weather, Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s worth climbing the 85 steps.\n\nIf you are luckier than we are with the weather, you will be able to admire the panorama of the Feldberg, the Black Forest and even, on a clear day, the Alps with Mont Blanc!\n\nMy photos from the Schauinsland trip"
