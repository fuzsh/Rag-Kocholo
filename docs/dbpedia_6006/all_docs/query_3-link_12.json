        "text": "And yet Freiburg has more to offer than good spirit alone. It boasts one of Germany's prettiest Old Towns, with its characteristic bächle – the narrow channels of water that run alongside the pavements. Not to mention a wealth of culture and history, many cafés and cosy bars, delicious local cuisine and scenic surroundings, with an atmosphere that is more laid-back than most – but that's southern Germany for you.\n\nExperience this vibe for yourself with a stroll through the Old Town, which is overlooked by the 116-metre-tall spire of the striking Freiburg Minster, one of Germany's most beautiful religious buildings.\n\nThe Münsterplatz square is the largest in the city centre. It hosts weekly markets almost every day. Its main sights include the Historical Merchants' Hall built in 1532 with its deep-red facade and colourful turrets as well as the 'Haus Zum Schönen Eck' built in 1761, which is now the Museum of Municipal History.\n\nFreiburg's multitude of glorious squares also provides an ideal backdrop for the dozens of celebrations and festivals held every year in the Old Town. And when you're feeling all partied out, now is the perfect time to unwind in the many parks and green spaces, at one of the nearby lakes or on the 1,284 metre Schauinsland mountain just outside of Freiburg. It's no wonder that Freiburg has been named a Green City, as it is seen as a global pioneer in eco-friendliness."
