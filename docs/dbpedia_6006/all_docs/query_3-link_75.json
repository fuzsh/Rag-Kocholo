        "text": "The University of Freiburg was founded in 1457 as a classical comprehensive university, making it one of the oldest higher education institutions in Germany. Successful in the Excellence Initiative, the university also boasts an illustrious history with numerous Nobel Prize recipients. Over 25.000 students, 150 degree programs, and more than 6.000 employees are working at the University of Freiburg. The university is divided into 11 faculties, 19 research centers, and numerous central service departments. Whereas the faculties organize and coordinate instruction and research for related fields of study, the research centers function as a platform for research projects spanning several faculties or disciplines. The central service departments provide university-wide services and thus provide the infrastructural framework for university operations in general.\n\nThe University Medical Center Freiburg is a tertiary care hospital. All medical specialties and subspecialties are represented at this institution. It is also one of the largest medical facilities in Europe. The University Medical Center Freiburg engages in patient health care, research, and teaching. The Center has almost 12.000 employees and is the biggest employer in the region. Moreover, it has 1.600 beds plus about 400 beds in the University Heart Center.\n\nFreiburg im Breisgau is a city in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Located in the extreme south-west of the country, Freiburg straddles the Dreisam river, at the foot of the Schlossberg. Historically, the city has acted as the hub of the Breisgau region on the western edge of the Black Forest in the Upper Rhine Plain. One of the famous old German university towns, archiepiscopal seat, Freiburg was incorporated in the early 12th century and developed into a major commercial, intellectual, and ecclesiastical centre of the upper Rhine region. The city is known for its ancient university and its medieval cathedral, as well as for its high standard of living and advanced environmental practices. The city is situated in the heart of a major wine-growing region and serves as the primary tourist entry point to the scenic beauty of the Black Forest. According to meteorological statistics, the city is the sunniest and warmest in Germany."
