        "text": "I was so enamored by Marge Piercy’s novel Woman on the Edge of Time — how it was unique and stuck in my thoughts — that I grabbed several Piercy novels the next time I was at the local used books store. In my basket I had The Longings of Women. It looks like a trashy romance novel with that key and the front cover that flips open to reveal something else. But how could Piercy’s skills let me down?\n\nThe Longings of Women alternate three narrators: Leila, Becky, and Mary. I told my mom that the novel reminded me of a weird version of the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future. Really, the entire novel focuses on the economic frailty of women. Mary is 61 and has been homeless for eight years. Her husband cheated on her, and she lost everything, which was a lot. Mary had been well to do while married. Currently, she works as a housekeeper and sleeps in basements or her clients’ homes when they’re on vacation.\n\nLeila is in her 40’s, a tenured professor and investigative journalist who writes books. Her husband, an actor and theater director, thinks he’s a big shot, but truly seems stuck to local-ish plays. Perhaps he can launch one in New York City, but you get the impression his work is off-off-off Broadway. The couple agreed that he could have affairs when his work took him out of town for long periods, but now it seems his adultery has hit too close to home, and Leila is in the process of divorce.\n\nBecky grew up poor with many family members in a small house. People shared bedrooms and bathrooms and money as they all tried to keep it together. She mimics professional women she sees in magazines in an effort to claw her way out of poverty. After earning a degree in Communications, Becky finds a job at a TV station where she is made a secretary, not an anchorwoman. However, her work puts her in the path of a contractor, who takes her out to dinner. Despite his family’s protests — they have money, and Becky is ill-bred — the couple marry when Becky is in her twenties. Before soon, the new husband has lost his job and can’t find work, but likely has found a girlfriend, a golf course, and friends to party with.\n\nSo, you see, Mary is what happens after the divorce, Leila is in the process, and Becky is just finding out about marriage to a toxic husband. If that were not clever enough, Piercy overlaps events throughout the novel. In the opening scenes, we know Becky is on trial for the murder of her husband, so Leila goes to prison to talk to her because Leila’s been asked to write a book about the crime. Becky is accused of luring a high school boy with sex into killing her spouse for her. Becky and the boy met while performing in a local play — a theater connection between two characters. Leila’s son is the same age as Becky’s high school lover. Mary cleans Leila’s house. And thought it seems unbelievable, two characters narrowly escape from burning buildings while three people die inside. If you’re not really paying attention, you’ll miss some of these crossovers that Piercy puts in so carefully to remind women that they are all similar, all vulnerable — that the bottom can fall out financially on anyone.\n\nWhile the title and cover make The Longings of Women seem like a bodice ripper, the true point is to show that women long for shelter, financial security, and respect. An excellent read that was unpredictable."
