However, the notes should only be treated for references and changes should be made according to the needs of the students.\n\nLine-by-line explanation of the poem\n\nThe bonsai tree in the attractive pot could have grown eighty feet tall on the side of a mountain till split by lightning. This line introduces the bonsai tree, which could have grown to a great height in its natural environment. The tree’s potential growth is cut short by the artificial environment of the pot, symbolizing the societal constraints placed on women.\n\nBut a gardener carefully pruned it. It is nine inches high. The gardener represents society, which carefully shapes and restricts the growth of the tree (or woman) to fit a certain aesthetic or expectation. The tree’s height, just nine inches, emphasizes the extent of this restriction.\n\nEvery day as he whittles back the branches the gardener croons, It is your nature to be small and cozy, domestic and weak; The gardener’s daily pruning and his words reflect societal expectations that women should be small, domestic, and weak. This line criticizes the way society often justifies gender roles as “natural”.\n\nhow lucky, little tree, to have a pot to grow in. The pot, while providing a place for the tree to grow, also limits its growth. This reflects the societal view that women should be grateful for their domestic roles, even though these roles can be restrictive.\n\nWith living creatures one must begin very early to dwarf their growth: the bound feet, the crippled brain, the hair in curlers, the hands you love to touch. The poem concludes by drawing parallels between the bonsai tree and various ways in which women’s growth and potential have been historically limited, such as foot binding, intellectual stifling, and objectification.\n\nWord meanings\n\nBonsai tree: A small tree that is grown in a container and is prevented from reaching its full size by the careful pruning of its roots and branches. It’s a Japanese art form.\n\nAttractive pot: A pleasing or appealing container. In the poem, it symbolizes the societal constraints placed on women.\n\nPruned: Cut off or removed parts of (a tree, bush, or plant), especially to encourage better shape or growth.\n\nWhittles back: To reduce something in size, amount, or extent by a gradual series of steps.\n\nCroons: Hum or sing in a soft, low voice, especially in a sentimental manner.\n\nDomestic: Relating to the running of a home or to family relations. In the poem, it refers to the traditional role of women in the home.\n\nDwarf their growth: To stunt or inhibit the growth or development of something.\n\nBound feet: A reference to the historical practice in China where women’s feet were tightly bound from an early age to keep them small. It’s used here as a metaphor for societal restrictions on women.\n\nCrippled brain: A brain that is unable to function fully or at its full potential. In the poem, it refers to the intellectual stifling of women.\n\nHair in curlers: A reference to traditional beauty standards and the effort women put into maintaining their appearance.\n\nSummary of the poem\n\nThe poem opens with an image of a bonsai tree, which could have reached a towering height of ‘eighty feet’ if it had been allowed to grow freely on a mountaintop until it was struck by lightning. However, it has been kept small and confined in a pot, with a gardener meticulously pruning it to ensure it remains a mere nine inches tall. The gardener joyfully sings to the bonsai that it is its nature to be small and cozy, domestic and weak and thatit is lucky to have a pot to grow in.\n\nAt this juncture, it becomes clear that the bonsai tree symbolizes women who are oppressed by men in a male-dominated society. The gardener (representing the men) seems to tell the bonsai (symbolising the women) that she should consider herself fortunate to be in a home, performing domestic tasks, as she is small and weak. Just as the pot shields the bonsai from the ‘lightning strike’, the home safeguards the woman from all external adversities.\n\nThe poet, with a touch of sarcasm, indicates that just as the gardener must start early to keep the bonsai small, men or society must start early to stunt the growth of women – physically, mentally, and spiritually – and prepare them for preordained roles such as curling their hair to appear attractive or binding their feet to keep them small. The final two lines ironically suggest that while men inhibit women’s growth, they still seek admiration and comfort from them.\n\nCritical analysis of the poem\n\nThe title of the poem, ‘A Work of Artifice,’ immediately grabs your attention. The word ‘artifice’ means ‘trickery’ or ‘sneaky tricks,’ which gives us a hint about the deeper meaning of the poem. As you read the poem, you realize it’s not just about a bonsai tree that’s constantly trimmed by a gardener to look pretty in a pot, safe from ‘lightning.’ The bonsai tree actually represents all women who are unfairly treated and controlled in a society where men have more power.\n\nJust like the plant is stuck living in a pot, a woman is often stuck within the four walls of her home, doing housework and thinking it’s her job to be small, weak, and domesticated. This is because she’s been ‘conditioned’ or trained from a young age to think this way.\n\nThe gardener, who could be a husband, a father, or any man, is happy to limit the woman’s growth. He makes sure that the woman happily accepts her role in society. She’s made to look attractive to men by curling her hair and binding her feet.\n\nThe last two lines are pretty ironic. The man who limits the woman still wants her to show him love and affection!\n\nThrough this poem, Marge Piercy expresses her sadness for women who accept the roles given to them by a society where men have more power, without questioning or protesting. In many cases, the woman doesn’t even realize the sneaky tricks used to make her a pretty decoration in the house, an object owned by her man. She doesn’t know that her growth in all areas of life is being constantly limited to stop her from demanding equal rights and freedom.\n\nThe poem, like a story with a hidden meaning, can be understood in two ways – literally and metaphorically. The beauty of the poem lies in the clever use of words and irony.\n\nThemes of the poem\n\nOppression and Limitation: The poem uses the metaphor of a bonsai tree, which is carefully pruned and kept small, to represent the oppression and limitations placed on women in society. Just as the bonsai tree is confined to a pot, women are often confined to certain roles and spaces.\n\nSocietal Expectations and Conditioning: The poem discusses how society conditions individuals, particularly women, from a young age to conform to certain expectations. This is represented by the gardener who starts pruning the bonsai tree early to keep it small.\n\nGender Roles and Inequality: The poem criticizes the traditional gender roles that expect women to be domestic, weak, and small. It highlights the inequality in society where women are expected to be nurturing and attractive for men, even when their growth is being stunted.\n\nFreedom and Growth: The bonsai tree, which could have grown eighty feet tall in the wild, symbolizes the potential for growth and freedom that is often suppressed in individuals, particularly women. The poem encourages readers to question societal norms that limit this growth and potential.\n\nIrony and Criticism of Patriarchy: The poem uses irony to criticize patriarchal society. The gardener, who represents the oppressive forces in society, limits the growth of the bonsai tree while still expecting it to be beautiful and nurturing. This reflects the irony of expecting women to be nurturing and loving while limiting their growth and potential.\n\nFigure of speech\n\nMetaphor: This is when you describe something by saying it is something else. In this poem, the bonsai tree is a metaphor for women. Just like the bonsai tree is kept small and confined, women are often kept in certain roles and places.\n\nIrony: Irony is when the actual meaning is the opposite of the literal meaning. In the poem, the gardener (representing men) limits the growth of the bonsai tree (representing women) while still expecting it to be beautiful and nurturing. This is ironic because the gardener is preventing the tree from reaching its full potential, yet he still wants it to be beautiful.\n\nImagery: Imagery is when the poet uses words to create a picture in your mind. The poem uses imagery when it describes the bonsai tree being pruned and kept in a pot, which helps you visualize the situation.\n\nPersonification: Personification is when you give human qualities to something that isn’t human. In the poem, the bonsai tree is given human qualities. For example, the gardener tells the tree that it is lucky to have a pot to grow in, as if the tree can understand him.\n\nAbout the author\n\nBorn on March 31, 1936, in Detroit, Michigan, Marge Piercy is an American activist and author renowned for her progressive perspective. Piercy distinguished herself as her family’s first university attendee, earning a scholarship to the University of Michigan. During her childhood, a bout with German measles and rheumatic fever ignited her passion for literature. She expressed, “It taught me that there’s a different world there…”\n\nMarge Piercy and her husband, Ira Wood, reside in a home in Wellfleet, MA that Piercy herself designed. They’ve lived there since the 1970s. Piercy’s extensive body of work includes notable titles like “Woman on the Edge of Time”, “He, She and It”—the winner of the 1993 Arthur C. Clarke Award—and “Gone to Soldiers”, a New York Times Best Seller set during World War II. Influences from her Jewish heritage, Communist activism, and feminist ideals are evident in her work.\n\nIn her poem “A Work of Artifice”, Piercy employs the metaphor of a bonsai tree. The bonsai, indicative of stunted growth and restricted freedom, symbolizes women in society. The poet probes the societal expectation of women as merely decorative fixtures, confined within domestic spaces and bound to household duties. Just as a bonsai tree is pruned and restricted from reaching its full size, women are likewise expected to know their boundaries and remain tethered to their responsibilities.\n\nWorkbook answers/solutions\n\nText-based Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)\n\n1.
