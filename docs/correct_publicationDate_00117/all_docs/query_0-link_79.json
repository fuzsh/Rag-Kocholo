Most recently, she published Made in Detroit, a collection of her newest poems.\n\nAs author, poet, and memoirist, Marge has written several works, including 17 novels. She authored The New York Times bestseller Gone To Soldiers and the national bestsellers Braided Lives and The Longings of Women.\n\nShe is well known for her classic novels Woman on the Edge of Time and He, She and It. More recently, she published Sex Wars, a novel about the turbulent post-civil war period. Marge is also the author of a critically acclaimed memoir titled Sleeping with Cats.\n\nBorn in Detroit, Marge Piercy was educated at the University of Michigan and Northwestern, and she has received four honorary doctorates. She is a self-proclaimed feminist who is active in antiwar and environmental causes. She has been a featured writer on Fresh Air, the Today Show, and many radio programs nationwide.\n\nOriginally founded in 1970 as the Women's Center, CWGS is a voice for women and the LGBTQIA+ community, with the purpose of eliminating barriers, diminishing prejudices, and creating a supportive climate and space for all.\n\nFor more information, contact:"
