        "meta_description": "Marge Piercy, feminist author, is shown in a photograph circa 1980.\n\t\n\tPiercy was drawn into the civil rights and antiwar movements along with hundreds of thousands of others during the 1960s.\n\t\n\tHer abilities as a writer enabled her to communicate the frustrations of many women with those movements and Piercy captured them in her essay, “The Grand Coolie Damn” published in Robin Morgan’s anthology “Sisterhood is Powerful” in 1970.\n\t\n\tThe essay helped galvanize thousands of women to take action for their own liberation. A few excerpts:\n\t\n\t“I remember watching a girl at a council meeting a few years ago who was striking in all aspects. She spoke well in a husky but carrying voice, she was physically attractive, she had read her texts and had a militant Left position and an obvious sense of style. In her head she was on the barricades, and that excitement carried in her speeches. She had no impact. I heard many people giving precis of the council afterward, and no one singled her out to mention, although many of the issues she spoke to carried.”\n\t\n\t“The male liberal respects the pride of women. He has learned well the rhetoric of women's liberation and offers apparent partnership. He will permit small doses of spokesmanship roles, so long as his hegemony is not challenged. Because he is willing to listen on a basis of apparent equality to women who work with (for) him, he is in a better position to draw out higher quality labor. He is just as career-oriented and just as exploitative as the male supremacist, but he gives back enough tidbits of flattery and attention to make the relationship appear reciprocal by contrast with what goes on with bullied males, and he is by far the more efficient long-range co-opter.”\n\t\n\t“Once again in the Movement, oppression is becoming something for professionals to remove from certifiably oppressed other people. When I am told day in and day out to shut up because our oppression pales beside the oppression of colonialized peoples and blacks, I remember half of them are women too, and I am reminded of my mother telling me to eat boiled mush because the Chinese were starving and would be glad to have it. When people are unhappy, no one can tell them their pain is unimportant. The ruling class isn't dissatisfied: they are healthy, well-fed, live in beauty, enjoy their own importance: fun-loving cannibals. Our men aren't dissatisfied either.\n\t\n\tThe entire essay can be read here: <a href=\"http://www.cwluherstory.org/the-grand-coolie-damn.html\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cwluherstory.org/the-grand-coolie-damn.html</a>\n\t\n\tPiercy has gone on to write a number of poetry anthologies and novels that have feminist or social justice issues as the centerpiece. \n\t\n\tThe science fiction piece, “He, She and It” won the 1993 Arthur C. Clarke award and Gone to Soldiers was a New York Times Best Seller.\n\t\n\tFor more information and related images of random radicals, see <a href=\"https://flic.kr/s/aHske413N1\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">flic.kr/s/aHske413N1</a>\n\t\n\tThe photographer is unknown.
