RICH, COMPLEX, IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT DOWN.\" - ALICE HOFFMAN\n\nIn the middle of the twenty-first century, life as we know it has changed for all time. Environmental disasters have ravaged the planet's resources, and the world has been divided into corporate enclaves.\n\nShira Shipman's marriage has broken up, and her young son has been taken from her by the corporation that runs her zone, so she has returned to Tikva, the Jewish free town where she grew up. There she is welcomed by Malkah, the brilliant grandmother who raised her, and meets an extraordinary man who is not: a man at all, but a unique cyborg implanted with intelligence, emotions—and the ability to kill....\n\nFrom the imagination of Marge Piercy comes yet another stunning novel of morality and courage, a bold adventure of women, men, and the world of tomorrow.\n\n\"Ambitious and absorbing...Piercy puts her trademark skills to work in making us care about the characters of her strange new world.... Woven throughout this incredible plot line is a magical story from the past.... A] very readable fable about the dangers of creating intelligent beings...Piercy is adept at using vignettes and vivid detail to paint a grim, hierarchical world in which most people live in deadly, ruined cities....Ominously real.\" THE BOSTON GLOBE”"
