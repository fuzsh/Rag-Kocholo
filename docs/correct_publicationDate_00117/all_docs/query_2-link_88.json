        "text": "End of days\n\nAlmost always with cats, the end\n\ncomes creeping over the two of you –\n\nshe stops eating, his back legs\n\nno longer support him, she leans\n\nto your hand and purrs but cannot\n\nrise – sometimes a whimper of pain\n\nalthough they are stoic. They see\n\ndeath clearly through hooded eyes.\n\nThen there is the long weepy\n\ntrip to the vets, the carrier no\n\nlonger necessary, the last time\n\nin your lap. The injection is quick.\n\nSimply they stop breathing\n\nin your arms. You bring them\n\nhome to bury in the flower garden,\n\nplanting a bush over a deep grave.\n\nThat is how I would like to cease,\n\nheld in a lover’s arms and quickly\n\nfading to black like an old fashioned\n\nmovie embrace. I hate the white\n\nsilent scream of hospitals, the whine\n\nof pain like air conditioning’s hum.\n\nI want to click the off switch.\n\nAnd if I can no longer choose\n\nI want someone who loves me\n\nthere, not a doctor with forty patients\n\nand his morality to keep me sort\n\nof, kind of alive or sort of undead.\n\nWhy are we more rational and kinder\n\nto our pets than with ourselves or our\n\nparents? Death is not the worst\n\nthing; denying it can be.\n\nPublished in Rattle, Vol. # 14, Issue 2, 2008,\n\nforthcoming in The Hunger Moon: Selected Poems, 1980 - 2010.\n\nThe happy man\n\nPierre Joseph Redoute painted roses;\n\nalso succulents, lilies, rare tropical\n\nimports, but most famously, roses.\n\nHe was from a family of journeymen\n\npainters, never famous, portraits\n\nto order, flattering of course,\n\nchurch and abbey decorations.\n\nBut Redoute painted flowers. He\n\nlooked like a peasant, squarish\n\nin body, strong with huge misshapen\n\nhands, not what aristocrats or critics\n\nexpect. But Redoute painted flowers.\n\nHe ambled through courts, Marie\n\nAntoinette’s play village at Versailles,\n\nRevolution, Terror, Napoleon. Josephine’s\n\ntriumph and her divorce, Charles X,\n\nLouis Philippe, court painter to each\n\nin turn unfailingly friendly, painting flowers.\n\nHis younger brother loved beetles\n\nand reptiles instead of court ladies\n\nto paint, but Redoute painted flowers.\n\nMoney came to him like rain to a garden.\n\nHe drank it in blindly, gave it to others,\n\nspent it like the water it seemed.\n\nAlways more tomorrow. He grew old,\n\nunfashionable. Money lenders sucked\n\nhim dry but he never drooped. Flowers\n\nwere always calling. At the end poor\n\nbut busy, brush in hand he died smiling\n\nas he painted a perfect white lily.\n\nPublished in Poesis, Vol. # 9, 2007,\n\nforthcoming in The Hunger Moon: Selected Poems, 1980 - 2010."
