        "text": "Oh, Veblen, this is much better\n\nYears and modes ago, in the heyday\n\nof communes, I was in Detroit\n\nto give a reading, a benefit.\n\nI was put up in Palmer Park, which in\n\nmy threadbare youth was where people\n\nwith money lived, when people\n\nwith money still lived in Detroit.\n\nIt was a womens commune and my\n\ncorner room had a black and white\n\nmarble bathroom, the tub big enough\n\nfor me and a lover, but I had none\n\nwith me, with a closet too large\n\nfor my entire wardrobe, a built in\n\nvanity fit for Jean Harlow, where\n\nI gazed at my face haggard from long\n\non the road. The house had belonged\n\nto vacuum cleaner money, but they had\n\nswept themselves out to Grosse Pointe\n\nlong ago. The wine cellar was bigger\n\nthan my living room at home; the kitchen,\n\nthe size of a corner grocery.\n\nThe little kids rode tricycles round\n\nand round the hardwood ground floor\n\nrooms. This is the proper use for this\n\nmansion, I thought, enough room\n\nfor families sharing food and housework,\n\nsharing bills and the blooming of children.\n\nThe house bounced and rattled and sang\n\nwith games, and the butlers pantry\n\nstored roller skates, bikes and kites.\n\nOld moon cradling the new moon\n\nWhat we have known is fully formed\n\nbut fading, a chord no longer quite\n\naudible but resonating in the bones.\n\nWhat we will be together is just a sliver\n\nof light, a whisper, a tone too high\n\nto hear yet but alerting the nerves.\n\nWhat we have been contains\n\nwhat we will be, although it is new\n\nas first milk from a swollen breast.\n\nWhat we desire rides the night\n\nlike a storm of tiny feathers, blossoms\n\nof ice and pinpricks of fire.\n\nWhere we will go is rooted in where\n\nwe have been, in each others arms\n\nas if twinned in the womb, and now\n\nthe womb opens on a new beast\n\nan elegant hybrid of cat and eagle,\n\na flower fully armed and fragrant\n\nwith the essences of could be, might\n\nbe, want to be, with the promise of birth\n\nunder the sign of the skinniest moon.\n\nA kind of theft\n\nIt is the season of making vinegars,\n\ntarragon, rosemary-orange, purple\n\nbasil, dill, chive blossom, cilantro:\n\naromatic, stoppered into bottles.\n\nI take great handfuls and handfuls\n\nof herbs, spendthrift, greedy,\n\nand bruise them in a mortar.\n\nI punish them for being.\n\nThen I heat the various bought\n\nvinegars, the cider, the wine\n\nthe rice, the plain and nasty,\n\nand pour them over the beaten herbs.\n\nThe sour preserves them. The harsh\n\nliquid surrounds and leaches\n\nfrom the green stuff its ghostly\n\nessence. For three weeks\n\nI shake and turn. Then\n\nI filter and discard the herbs,\n\nthrow out what was so fresh\n\nI have extracted its soul.\n\nI have turned it to garbage.\n\nHow often I do the same\n\nto parts of myself, to adventures\n\nand mishaps and terrors,\n\nto the deaths of those dear,\n\nto the pleasures of sleek\n\nand sliding flesh, all the leaves\n\nand flowers of my passing days.\n\nI awake feathered\n\nI awake covered in feathers.\n\nI am iridescent. I gleam\n\nin the milky dawn.\n\nI shimmer like a rainbow\n\nhanging in the air.\n\nI raise my arm over my head\n\nand the wing extends.\n\nThis morning I will take\n\nflight, take it and use it.\n\nLater perhaps I will moult,\n\ndwindle into human\n\nagain, but my power\n\nfills me now like music\n\nloud and surging. I rise\n\nover the house, the gardens.\n\nI beat high into the crisp\n\nlimpid air, then float,\n\na kite no string controls.\n\nIt cant last, but it shouldnt\n\nPinacles are of the moment.\n\nI belong here right now.\n\nQuarrel in the berry patch\n\nI gave you the cherries this year,\n\nthe mulberries, you gorgeous beasties\n\norange and lemon like the bells\n\nof St. Clemons, wherever that is,\n\nBaltimore dashing orioles.\n\nWhy do you curse and torment\n\nme, picking black currants?\n\nYou cant have everything.\n\nThe yellow female squats over\n\nmy head, threatening.\n\nThe male twitters and swoops.\n\nNow the catbirds too mew\n\ndire promises of revenge.\n\nOkay, the black currants are mine,\n\nbut well split the blueberries.\n\nThis is my land, I say, no\n\ndifferent than the boast of Mr.\n\norange chest from his hanging\n\nnest in the weeping beech\n\nand whose tree is it?"
