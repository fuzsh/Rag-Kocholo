I, Robot, a collection of nine short stories by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov that imagines the development of \"positronic\" (humanlike, with a form of artificial intelligence) robots and wrestles with the moral implications of the technology. Asimov's treatment of robots as being programmed with ethics rather than as marauding metal monsters was greatly influential in the development of science fiction. He, She and It is a cyberpunk novel by Marge Piercy. The story is situated in North America in the near future of the year 2059. At that time, the economic and political power is held by few multis?huge multi-national enterprises with their own social hierarchy that have produced an affluent society. The main part of the population, however, lives in the glop outside of the multis' enclaves within an environment that has mainly been destroyed. Mockingbird is a science fiction novel by American writer Walter Tevis, first published in 1980. It was nominated for a Nebula Award for Best Novel. A central character is Spofforth, dean of New York University and an android who has lived for centuries yet yearns to die. Robopocalypse (2011) is a science fiction novel by Daniel H. Wilson. The book portrays AI out of control when a researcher in robotics explores the capacity of robots. A computer scientist accidentally unleashes a supremely intelligent sentient A.I. named Archos R-14. It becomes self-aware and immediately starts planning the elimination of human civilization and building a new cryptic ecology, where the organic is being merged with robot technology."
