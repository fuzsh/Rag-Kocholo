        "text": "Prolific writer and Wellfleet resident Marge Piercy talks about her life and work\n\nMarge Piercy is the celebrated author of 19 poetry collections, 17 novels and numerous pieces of non-fiction. Her most recent effort, “Made in Detroit,” is autobiography ripe with places, people, city and earth, written in poetry that is terse, biting, funny, vivid and moving. It spans time from her early years in Detroit to those in her current home, Wellfleet.\n\nIn an e-mail interview, Piercy answered questions about her work and her life.\n\nQ: In the first section of \"Made in Detroit’\" we see a mother who fed birds, baked, read palms to escape the “asbestos” house and the anger of her husband. We see the city itself. There is the essence of your early life in poems such as “The Rented Lakes of My Childhood.” So much of your autobiography is revealed but is there anything you want to add about yourself here?\n\nA: The book is “Made in Detroit,” so the autobiographical section deals with my first 17 years. I’ve written at length about my life in my memoir “Sleeping With Cats.” Some of the poems in the relationship section deal with my later and current life.\n\nI live with my husband and partner Ira Wood. We’ve been together since 1976, married since 1982. We mostly work separately but have written a play, a novel and a how-to book together. We teach memoir or fiction workshops together; he teaches a humor workshop on his own and I teach poetry on my own. He was a selectman in Wellfleet for 12 years and now has a weekly interview program, The Lowdown, on WOMR, where he’s president of the board and also does humorous commentary most Fridays on the news program. He has published three novels and a book of short fiction/memoir. Together we ran Leapfrog Press, publishing fiction, poetry and memoir for 10 years before we sold it. We both give terrific readings. We garden together, raising most of our own vegetables and some fruit, flowers, roses – organically.\n\nQ: Your poems indicate that escaping from and making sense of the wounds of your childhood compelled you to internalize – to become a reader (“Libraries were my cathedrals,”) – then, a writer, a poet. Is that so?\n\nA: I was a robust little tomboy with no interest in school until I was felled by German measles followed by rheumatic fever. I was weak, pale blue, weighed about as much as my cat, fainted frequently and with my big mouth still got into fights that I could no longer win (until I was 12 or 13). I was a big disappointment to my parents. My refuge was books. I began to make regular trips to the library and read everything I could.\n\nWhen I was 15, my family moved to a bigger house in a white working class neighborhood so I left the proto-gang and my old friends, my grandmother with whom I was very close died, and my old boyfriend poisoned my cat when we moved. I had a room that, although unheated, had a door that shut and thus privacy. I began to write since I finally had a room of my own and much in my life to try to make sense of.\n\nQ: There are aspects of Whitman and (Detroit poet) Philip Levine, and allusions to songs in many pieces – but always your imagery is original and terse. How do you manage to keep it fresh and succinct?\n\nA. I knew Philip but don’t think he influenced me any more than I influenced him. We both come from stone working class Detroit. I grew up around more African Americans than he did. He worked in factories; I babysat till 3 in the morning and came home alone; worked switchboard and Sam’s Cut-Rate Department store.\n\nImagery is the most personal of the craft elements of poetry. Metaphor comes most directly out of your own core. It comes from how you perceive the world, how carefully you look and listen, how well you remember, how your mind works. Whatever you have actually paid attention to (birds, rocks, stars, physics, cooking, gardening, animals, rain, paintings, music, sex, wind, trees, politics, history) is the stuff of which your imagery is made. The more you pay attention, the richer your imagery.\n\nQ: In Section 2, there’s some of your rage against violence against the planet, which is carried into Section 3, “The Poor Are No Longer With Us,” where you feel climate change in your garden and hands, and urge the oppressed to fight. Tell us about your work as an organizer/activist.\n\nA: How could I live and not be an activist? I live for instance in the fallout cone of one of the three worst-run nuclear reactors in the U.S., an old Fukushima clone. There is no evacuation plan for the Cape nor can there be. We are the expendables.\n\nI have lived here since 1971 and I can see and experience climate change. I never see some birds that were common any longer; I used to see many butterflies, now far fewer.\n\nI’m a woman who at 18 had to abort myself because there was no legal abortion; I was poor and had no means for a safe abortion. I would have had to quit school. My parents would have thrown me out. My boyfriend was a control freak jerk. I almost died and I never want another girl or woman to lose control of her body or her choice. Who doesn’t control their body? Only a slave. Isis makes slaves of women; so do many state legislatures now and the Republican agenda.\n\nQ: In Section 4, “Working at It,” Judaism seems to be a force in your life.\n\nA: My grandmother Hannah gave me my religious education, Orthodox, but with a strong female component and tradition. When the rabbi gave her a boiler plate eulogy, I rebelled. I tried Buddhism (studied with a Zen monk for a while) but went back to Judaism. I promised my grandmother when she learned that of her village in Lithuania, no one had survived, no one, that I would always be a Jew. I have a strong Jewish identity. I wrote “Pesach for the Rest of Us” and was part of a group of mostly rabbis who produced a Reconstructionist siddur (praybook) for Shabbat morning. I was one of the founders of Am haYam, a havurah (Jewish community) that still exists on the Cape. I have led a seder on Pesach for 35 years based on my haggadah which I am constantly working on. It’s about 60 percent poetry.\n\nQ: The last two sections seem to be about what was and what could be. “Marinade for an Elderly Rabbit” (like a number of your poems) made me laugh out loud. What’s the secret to staying loving? Humor? Conversation? Gardening?\n\nA. All of the above, but communication and sex and respect are the core of loving for me.\n\nQ: I’ve always thought of fiction as character-driven, and poetry as a meme for the self in search of a larger context. Talk a bit about those different crafts.\n\nA. You can’t mistake an idea for a novel with an idea for a poem any more than you can confuse an elephant with a hummingbird. For me, novels have always been a way of exploring the road not taken, other people’s lives. But lately I have been writing many short stories again and liking that very much. My first book of short stories, “The Cost of Lunch, Etc.,” came out last year and will appear in paperback in the fall with two new stories and an introduction.\n\nQ: You have written a whole book about this but in a nutshell: advice to writers of all ages? For achieving quality and originality?\n\nA: Read read read. But read in the genre you’re working in, not books about how to write. You wouldn’t want a surgeon taking out your appendix who had read “The Way of the Surgeon” and proceeded. Learn to read like a writer, observing craft. Learn as much from the writings that don’t work for you (why? what elements failed?) as you do from the ones you like. Don’t imitate; study craft.\n\nQ: State of poetry -- world, national, local?\n\nA: Poetry is completely decentralized. It isn’t centered in New York although prize-givers are. Poetry is murdered in classrooms where students are forced to “explicate” poems as if poetry were a way of taking a theme or an idea and hiding it. If people would read poems aloud, they could enjoy the immediacy of poetry, its music, its power, its way of capturing a moment, an emotion.\n\nIf you were to find the most popular poets of New Mexico, say, they would be an entirely different crew than the favorite poets of Minnesota. Most of the poets people actually care about rarely win prizes. They write poems that people remember, maybe say at weddings or funerals, put up on the refrigerator with a magnet, tack over their computers, give to a lover or a grieving friend. I am that kind of poet and so are many others, a lot of whom are not white, not what is considered respectable in academia (poets you’d be allowed to write a thesis on,) not from Ivy League colleges, don’t write poems that are gnomic, so dense saying them would break your teeth. Poetry is alive where people care about it.\n\nQ: What brought you to and keeps you on the Cape?\n\nA: I love the landscape here. I came when the anti-war, the New Left movement in New York, had been infiltrated by COINTELPRO (Nixon’s covert and illegal program of infiltrating anti-war organizations and pushing them toward extremes) and was eating itself, turning insane and violent. I was also sick. Although I had quit smoking, I had smoked for years and had chronic bronchitis. Living in NYC was smoking two packs a day just by breathing.\n\nI fell in love with the Outer Cape when I visited friends. it was a funky place in those days, with mostly year-round people who didn't have much money and some lived off the land then. Lots of artists, hippies, politicos, writers, people in the trades, fishermen. We all mixed it up. Now it scares me what’s happening, so many retired people with lots of money and no reason to stick around in the winter since they have no real ties – don't work here, don't have kids in school. That scares me for the future of Wellfleet, but I love this place. It’s my home.\n\nQ: Can you talk a little about the trip from working class to middle class, from discomfort to safety?\n\nA: I was poor until I married my second husband, who was in computers. Even then, at first I supported him. I’ve always worked, often been the primary breadwinner. But I remember when I got my first credit card – a thrill. And my first winter coat that wasn’t a hand-me-down or from a rummage sale or second-hand rack. I felt some guilt when I left my old neighborhood and the kids in the gang. I understand people who can’t. I’m not a lady, very outspoken, often seen as demanding. Sometimes middle-class women, even feminists, have trouble with me because I’m blunt and open and curse a lot. My mother was a powerful and creative curser.\n\nQ: Tell us something about your cats (those mentors, soul-mates, metaphors, spirits).\n\nA: I only have four cats now, ranging in age from 14 to 3. Both my elderly females died over the past two and a half years, so we have 3 males and 1 female who runs the house. Xena was a tiny kitten from the MSPCA who is now the size of a middle-weight dog – very gentle and affectionate but also strong willed. Her boyfriend is the youngest male, Mingus, who is one third her size. Puck is James Beard reincarnated. He eats mango, persimmon, brie, papaya, cantaloupe, pizza, etc. He is very elegant and never gains an ounce. Sugar Ray, the oldest, is a gentleman. Unlike the other three cats, he has never so much as killed a fly. Live and let live is his motto. He is a lover first and last. When I had an operation, he guarded me.\n\nQ: Do you think as a female writer the road is harder to hoe? Or is that notion oh-so last century."
