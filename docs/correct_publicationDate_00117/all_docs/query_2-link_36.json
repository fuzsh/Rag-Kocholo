        "text": "January 7, 2017\n\nA pleasure to reconnect with one of my favourite authors from the 1980s. As always concerned with social justice, personal and wider politics, relationships and sex. And the author gives away something of her own bias in the final words of the book \"... and as much kindness as she could muster.\"\n\nIn spite of the exterior hardness of her characters, and a lot of scrapping between the three generations that make up the three women, there is a lot of love in action - particularly in response to the debilitating strokes suffered by one of the women. And I learned a lot about strokes from reading the book.\n\nDecember 10, 2018\n\nThis book was really captivating, as I often find Marge Piercy's novels to be. Her characters are fully realized, richly rendered, and complex. I also love her formula here (used in a couple other novels too) of switching between three protagonists' perspectives. It challenged me as a reader to not really 'side' with any one character but to see a situation from multiple perspectives. At this point in my life I identified most with Suzanne, middle aged lawyer trying to hold everyone else together, but I think when I was younger I would have identified most with Elena, Suzanne's 20-something daughter who is somewhat adrift in life. In Elena's character Piercy captures well much of the anger and feeling of purposelessness that I remember feeling so acutely in my teens and early 20s. I perhaps identified the least with Beverly but nevertheless appreciated getting a real window into her experience of aging.\n\nThis novel was particularly emotionally intense compared to other Piercy novels, with a lot of family drama and one character being witness to an act of terrible violence. Because of these themes it kind of felt like Marge Piercy writing as Joyce Carol Oates! But I typically enjoy Oates, too.\n\nI really appreciated too how sensitively Piercy portrays assisted suicide. Because we get Beverly's perspective, and she is able to still write and talk somewhat, it is clear that what she wants is to end her life, so ultimately it is a good death. Beautifully portrayed, and also, as is typical of Piercy, makes a political point about the way we currently treat assistance in dying in the law.\n\nThe story was heartbreaking in some ways but also very tender, portraying in a very sensitive and authentic way how a family (biological and chosen) responds to crisis points and turning points. It was very well done.\n\nSeptember 26, 2016\n\nOvo je knjiga za dubokom poukom! Tri zene, tri generacije - baba, majka i kcerka, svaka sa svojim zivotima, svojim problemima, svojim razmisljanjima, strahovima, nadanjima i ljubavima. U jednom periodu su prinudjene da zive zajedno, pod istim krovom a onda se i neminovno sukobljavaju jer im teznje i ocekivanja nisu ista. Ipak, spaja ih ljubav jedne preme drugoj. Na kraju, bake vise nije bilo ali im je ostavila zavestanje - '...svetu pravda, a svakome prisnosti, samilosti i neznosti koliko god bude mogla da im pruzi.'\n\nMarch 17, 2017\n\nI read this book as fast as possible to dispose of it. Honestly, for an author who claims to be a feminist, her ideas are antiquated. Each protagonist depends on a man yet the men have shallow roles. The interwoven chapters start to all sound the same, too. For a tome thick with drama, including suicide, depression, scandalous sex, and jail time, not much happens. Author Piercy doesn't give her readers much to explore or think critically about and instead spends ample time describing clothing choices and careers. This is my first Piercy experience, and I'm disappointed.\n\nJuly 12, 2012\n\nOutstanding writing. Great plotting and character portrayals. Great insight to the human psyche.\n\nDecember 3, 2012\n\nPicked this up outside of Books Through Bars for free. I had the sense she is a feminist writer and that seemed compelling and I'd seen her name around so I thought I'd give it a go. The book began on an upswing sketching out a family run by single moms through two generations. As the pages turn, a variety of relationships between all the women in the family and their exterior friendships/affairs are explored.\n\nInitially, the writing seemed convincing; well put together. The first character, Suzanne, seemed sharp and in charge. Then Elena, one of the daughters, made her debut and it all went to shit. Elena is an almost entirely despicable character. The worst part about is that Piercy wants Elena to have grown on us by the end because of the positive transformation she's made within herself, except that Elena has done nothing redeemable. In fact, most all the characters in the book, even though I found moments of oblique identification with them, were pretty lousy people. The grandma is a self-interested tyrant whose political work and care for others does not extend to her own family (except Elena of all people). Suzanne is a lawyer who is only well assembled when she's arguing a case and displays the worst in women when she's not. Elena has wasted her life and wants her mommy to pay for it.\n\nThere's a theme of accountability (or lack there of) and the law. It almost came off as if Piercy wanted to test out a few of the most contentious ways women in the book could go to prison. Murder, adultery, assault, illicit drugs, pedophilia. But these ideas are carelessly explored, tiresome and sensational by the end. I skimmed paragraphs just to find out if the book made an unexpected u-turn in the direction of brilliance. It did not.\n\nPiercy certainly has writing talent; but I felt duped as a reader, lured into a story by a ridiculous racy scandals that were not well played out. There's also the clumsiness of inserted email conversations between characters--not a fan. Elements such as these make the novel feel dated and not in a romantic way. I was also disappointed in how feminism was hinted to in various ways but how none of the female characters completely rose above their stereotypes. Although I appreciated at times the degree of candidness the writer used, I just wanted more breakthroughs, less dependance, fewer typical gendered dynamics (why do all the men have to be total losers? why do all the women have to be fundamentally alone, loveless, jaded, naive, pathetic?). It just must not be my wave of feminism--a feminism that strives to break molds, to consider the inequalities women and men are both served in a gender binary. These very interesting ideas and possibilities got thinned out and lost in a wearisome conclusion.\n\nMaybe you should just find out which Piercy book people liked the most and read that one instead.\n\nJuly 27, 2008\n\nNew resolution: I'll get books out of the library instead of always buying them. So I go to the library, armed with my targets picked out from Goodreads, and look for \"Gone to Soldiers\", but it isn't currently in. So I get this one of hers instead. The title pretty much says it all. The male characters in this story are the bit parts, though their roles in the lives of the Three are important. And it does include \"love, sex, betrayal, illness and death\" but for me this novel didn't quite get there. Of the Three, only one of them really interested me. Really only 2.5 stars.\n\nJune 1, 2018\n\nI read this book almost 20 years ago--and just referenced it again (forgot it was marge piercy but remembered an important plot to the book that has stayed with me). Looked it up because of situation with mother (who is mostly not like the matriarch in the book) who is completely unaware of her own living with dementia. Who cared for her own mother who starved herself to death when she was done with her life.\n\nGave 3 stars just now but changed it up because I can still remember the book all these years later--that must matter!\n\nApril 20, 2009\n\nThis book was what most feminist literature strives to be. I have to say it was a bit slow, but the characters were believable and touching even at their worst moments.\n\nJanuary 21, 2021\n\nSuzanne Blume is a middle aged, divorced lawyer living through a quiet stage of life until her daughter Elena moves back in with her and her mother Beverly has a stroke. The three women who were previously living quite separate lives are now increasingly intertwined.\n\nI feel as though I missed the point of this book. It wasn't moving to me, it was mostly just a sad book about people I didn't really like.\n\nThe first major thing we learn about Elena, is that she was in a polyamorous relationship with two, very troubled men when she was younger. The three made an incredibly fucked-up group. Ultimately, one of the boys attempts to convince the other two to commit suicide. While the other two do not, he goes through it in an incredibly violent manner which has scarred Elena for life. Once moving in with Suzanne, who also lives with her best friend and husband (another quite odd element of this book), Elena starts an affair with the husband. Ultimately, that doesn't end well. Elena's character feels quite underdone and she feels more like everything scandalous thrown together in one person. She is unsavory and isn't fleshed out enough to be redeemed.\n\nI was much more sympathetic to Beverly's as following her stroke, she is losing a lot of her previously very independent life. That said, she also felt unfinished and I wanted more out of Beverly. The book then culminates with Beverly's assisted suicide. On a personal note, I have a really hard time with books about assisted suicide. I understood Beverly's reasoning behind wanting to end her life but felt as though she went around it in an entirely callous and selfish manner.\n\nOverall, this book had potential. Maybe there's more here if I sit on it more, but ultimately I was just kind of disappointed.\n\nJune 17, 2022\n\nThis novel isn't perfect, but it has a lot of good things going for it and a lot to offer. Most impressive is the way Piercy weaves social justice issues into the story without becoming preachy or prescriptive. The characters discuss or live through the moral and legal implications of teen suicide, environmental and divorce law, a case where children are coached to accuse a caregiver of child abuse, death with dignity, infidelity, religious differences, political protest, misogyny and more.\n\nThe characters are well-formed and have depth. None are likeable (not a negative for me). I found both Beverly and Suzanne believable throughout, both how they are at the start of the novel and how they change as events unfold. Elena, however, I couldn't get behind. She changes the most, and I couldn't believe in her change. She's the youngest and I suppose the most malleable? But I felt that her change would not be lasting. At one point she discusses her \"pendulum swings\" with Suzanne, that she goes from one extreme to the other and maybe eventually will find a happy medium. So in the one-year-later final section I expected to see that swing back but it wasn't there. I don't buy that Elena made a full shift so quickly.\n\nAlso, nitpicky, but the point is made that Beverly won't be buried, she's arranged a cremation for herself. Then, in the end, she's buried and they visit her grave. I think it's an error (a big one!). If it's not though, it ought to have been addressed why they chose not to follow Beverly's wishes.\n\nAugust 2, 2023\n\nI found this novel quite moving as Piercy tracks the lives of grandmother Beverly, mother Suzanne and daughter Elena. Chapters are short which is a bit unnerving at times, but the choices and undoings each woman faced throughout their lives are arresting.\n\nI was especially drawn to Beverly, downed by two strokes and only seeking to die. I remember well my father encouraging us to consider the work of the Hemlock Society and the right to die movement. I've long believed this to be one of the most essential rights each of us has. That Beverly's daughter and granddaughter work together to help her over is so moving.\n\nThe conflicts and dilemnas faced by Suzanne and Elena are so contemporary. Marry or not? Divorce or not? Find wholeness in sexual freedom? Connecting with those who matter when all in life gets in the way of that connection? Male and female needs, desires and demands? Paying the bills when that demands compromise? Finding a path to meaningful employment? Finding family love after years of relative estrangement?\n\nI wanted to rate this 1999 novel higher, but found it often too choppy and repetitious.\n\nStill worthy of a good read!\n\nJuly 4, 2017\n\nInteresting exploration of mother-daughter relationships in an upperclass Jewish home. Suzanne, a high powered law professor, is always out of time and energy. Her unionist mother, who barely had time for her, has always been indpendent, but suffers a debilitating stroke, rendering her helpless. Suzanne's oldest daughter Elena has had a troubled childhood and adolescence, and is still struggling with living life on her terms while not damaging herself and others. Her youngest daughter has decided, of all things in this non-religious family, to be a rabbi. Piercy details the dance that all of them weave as they struggle to deal with old wrongs and older scars while trying to make their own lives. Independence-Dependence and Trust-Suspicion were two big themes. I didn't really like this book in the beginning, especially Elena's character, but I was glad I stuck with it, as I liked the way the characters grew both together and apart. It would be a good discussion book for a women's club.\n\nJune 19, 2017\n\nReally 4.5 stars. She is one of my favorite authors and her writing as always is vivid with very three dimensional well-realized characters. Several reviewers here complain that the \"three women\" (three generations of women) are flawed characters. Yes they are, but they all grow and develop and learn through the book, heal their relationships, develop new and better relationships, start on new paths/ journeys. More that you can say about most books!\n\nJanuary 28, 2018\n\nExcellent author. This book is not as good as Gone to Soldiers, but the problem is not the writing. The subject matter - three women of three generations (grandmother, mother, daughter) living together in essentially a soap opera (due to the youngest's seeming inability to care about anyone other than herself at this very moment) does not appeal to me. Thus the 4 stars for the writing/plotting. The actual story would get far less.\n\nJune 19, 2019\n\nI thought this book was superb. Yes the charscters are flawed and several are very self serving. That's real life. But they all grow from their experiences. This is a book about real human beings. The central character Suzanne is particularly relatable for anyone who is daily trying to please everyone they love. It's mpossible. A very powerful book: empathetic, compassionate, strong characters, always believable. Outstanding.\n\nDecember 15, 2018\n\nI read this because I really love Marge Piercy, & the library that I go to didn’t have the book that I really wanted to get, “Summer People”, so I got this. I have to tell you, I really didn’t like what they were doing, but about halfway through the book, the tale of the character, Elena suddenly hit at track for me. BUT the ending was good.\n\nJanuary 19, 2022\n\nNot sure why Goodreads thought I would enjoy this, but it is decidedly not for me. I found the writing plain, repetitive, and at times, there were the types of errors you'd hope any editor would find. I will say she wrote the older lady well, but I still found myself wishing I'd get to the end quicker\n\nJuly 31, 2020\n\nOne of those stories you really want to know the way it'll end. Some food for thought, too, ie the mothers-daughters relationships, and the end of life choices.\n\nI know I won't reread it, but it was a good read and I suspect some of the characters will remain in my mind, at least for a while.\n\nJuly 27, 2018\n\nUninspiring characters, a wooden writing style...nope, couldn't finish this one.\n\nApril 16, 2019\n\nOne of my all time favourite novels. It's beautifully written with wonderful characterisation. A flawless and all-consuming read.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 29, 2019\n\nThis novel started our slow for me, then it took a turn and I was hooked. I don't understand the decision at the end other than it made the family closer. Over all it was a good read.\n\nAugust 7, 2019\n\nGot this as a summer read and did so during travel. I read it in short, interrupted pieces, which could be an influence of how I remember it: It had some wonderful sentences.\n\nDecember 16, 2019\n\nI haven’t read Marge Pierce in years and so I started this book. I almost quit part way, but then decided to finish. I’m sure it was more relevant in 1999 when it was written.\n\nJanuary 3, 2020\n\nA story of three generations of women and how they interact with one another and their place in the family."
