        "text": "November 5, 2017\n\nIn the first years of the 2000s I attended a talk by Weather Underground member Bernadine Dohrn, a well-known leader of the SDS before she went under. She was brilliant, charismatic, inspiring. Like many people my age, coming up in the 1990s, I came to leftist politics through a kind of worship of the 1960s and the movements that came out of that decade. Yet, though I might not have been able to articulate it at the time, there was also a sense of disappointment when all these middle-class yuppies who just loved Bill Clinton went on and on about their Woodstock experience, their time at the anti-war march, that one time they were in a car with an actual Black Panther. Was it really so radical, when the final result of their involvement in the various movements was 'didn't grow up to become a Republican'? Why did most of them still seem to be so uncomfortable around people of different races? Why were they so into the vicious welfare and criminal justice reforms and other neo-liberal policies of the Clinton era? And then, a few years later, why were so many of them frothing at the mouth trying to get America back into endless imperial war? Bernadine Dohrn, in 2004, seemed to represent a different path out of that late 1960s moment. She was the first person who introduced to me the 'other' Martin Luther King Jr, not the watered-down voice of racial unity without redress of wrongs, but the fiery voice against the military industrial complex and the grotesque maldistribution of wealth under capitalism. She was still fighting, in her way.\n\nDohrn and Bill Ayers turned themselves in in 1980. By the time they came out of hiding, most of the charges against them had to be dropped due to the wildly illegal activities of the FBI, and she did just a short amount of time, later becoming a law professor. Marge Piercy's novel, Vida, a fictional account of a Dohrn-esque woman from a group much like the Weather Underground, was written in 1979, before the sentencing of Dohrn and Ayers, and before the 1981 attempted bank robbery by several WU-affiliated leftists that left three people dead and evaporated much of any remaining goodwill to the fugitive bombers of the far left. Piercy had no way of knowing what was just around the corner when she wrote this novel, but her finger was clearly on the pulse. The times were changing. The times had already changed, quite a lot. Piercy vividly depicts a group of radicals who are slowly coming to realize that they aren't on the vanguard anymore, and that they might actually be in the process of becoming relics. The novel moves deftly between time periods, capturing the increasing fury of the late 1960s anti-war movement, the first heady years of being underground, and the daily stresses of being a long-term fugitive. (Thank god for pay phones).\n\nThere's also quite a lot of political conversation between the characters that reads as achingly earnest to me, having read this book in a time when communist memes and twitter snark are primary means of left communication. Oh, for a communiqué free of irony! I was especially moved by the discussions between Vida and her sister Natalie, who found her calling within the women's movement, much to Vida's Marxist-Leninist dismay, since apparently women's issues were bourgeois. (Later, anti-nuke work earns the same moniker, as does basically the entire ecological movement, which really makes these fugitives political dinosaurs for the 21st century reader.) Of course leftist politics have changed deeply in the almost 40 years since Marge Piercy wrote Vida, but she so deftly depicts her characters and their politics, that though we might now fiercely critique certain aspects of their actions or ideology (oh god, so much toxic masculinity on display), we have to reckon with them as real people, trying to find their way in a fucked society and somehow make it better. This is a powerful, necessary lesson, and lucky for us, it comes in the form of a plot-driven and entertaining novel.\n\nAugust 16, 2022\n\nA Political Novel of the 1960s\n\nThere is so much divisiveness and polarization today in our country. I was in college and graduate school during the 1960's -- 70's and remember the demonstrations, the student protests, the anger, the Vietnam War, the assassinations and more. It troubled me when young, and it troubles me more now.\n\nMarge Piercy is a prolific American poet and novelist who wrote \"Vida\" (1979) as her sixth novel relatively early in her career. I read and greatly enjoyed a volume of Piercy's poetry, \"The Art of Blessing the Day\" many years ago., \"Vida\" was the first of her novels I have read, and I liked it far less.\n\nThis is a novel of 1960s radicalism and its aftermath. The primary character is Vida Asch, 37, a leader of the student radicals in the 1960s. Late in the 1960s, the student movement divided with a small splinter group, called the Weathermen, going underground and perpetuating acts of violence. Vida is a leader of this underground or 'Network\" and a member of its governing board.\n\nThe novel moves back and forth in time, both in its sections and in flashbacks. Some of the sections show the protest movement of the 1960's and Vida's involvement. But the larger part of the book shows Vida's years as a fugitive through about the time the novel was published in the late 1970s. Vida goes underground after a series of bombings. The novel describes the painstaking care she and her comrades must take to avoid detection and arrest. The novel is thickly and realistically textured and shows a committed, difficult, lonely, and claustrophobic life.\n\nThe novel shows something of the bombings or \"actions\" that made Vida a fugitive and that she continues to undertake as most of her generation fades away or moves on to other things. But most of the book is about Vida herself, the places she visits as a fugitive, the way she manages to support herself, her extensive sex and love life, and her love of food and clothes. The book includes many characters all of whom Piercy convincingly describes. The other major characters include a younger man, Joel, who becomes a love interest of Vida early in the novel, and Vida's sister, Natalie, in the middle of getting a divorce. The book and the frame of political interest gradually move from the Vietnam protests through other critiques of social and economic conditions in the United States. It emphasizes how, in the 1970s when the Network was reduced to a dwindling number of fugitives, the Network became the source of a strong feminism, based on the way the male leaders of the Network treated its women members, including Vida. Feminism and sexuality ultimately become a major theme of this book.\n\nThe novel is multi-textured and written with great details and powers of observation. Piercy writes with a great deal of sympathy for her characters. The book is dedicated to the \"street and alley soldiers\" and Piercy describes the work on her webpage as \"the most important novel yet written about the political 60's and 70's [and] at the same time a sensual and moving love story.\"\n\nI was reminded of the 1960's and 70's by Piercy's novel and developed feeling for the characters and their plight. In my view, the author's admiration for her characters and their political commitments was misplaced. I didn't find this admiration supported by the book and I don't share it, beyond the human sympathy for lost, lonely, probably misplaced lives. In my view, Piercy gives 1960s radicalism and its adherents more credit than they deserve. Her novel is indeed about the \"political\" 60s and 70's and may not appeal to readers without a commitment to the politics of that era. \"Vida\" is a lengthy book; while I enjoyed it in sections, it did not bring back fond memories of an earlier time or make me wish that the politics of that time had been realized. The book reminded me of large, continued divisions in our beloved country and of the continued and growing need for healing, for shared ideals, and for a renewed spirit of patriotism.\n\nRobin Friedman\n\nSeptember 17, 2018\n\nIt's a time capsule! This novel contains fictional characters who are based upon living people who made up the militant anti-war group the Weather Underground in the 1960s and 70s. The group was anti-war, anti-capitalism, they hated the wealthy ruling class, etc. In real life the group bombed buildings, and avoided killing people. (They accidentally killed one person during one bombing.) The book introduction attempts to separate this group from the idea of \"terrorism.\" They did not want to injure anyone; they wanted to dismantle corporate greed.\n\nThe plot does not run in a linear way. Readers see the protagonist Vida during the \"current\" day, which was the publication date of 1979, as she lives anonymously without a permanent home. Every day she lives in fear of being apprehended for her subversive destruction that occurred 10 years previously.\n\nWhile reading, I was guessing at 2 possible endings. Vida may die in a hail of gunfire, in a desperate attempt to flee the \"pigs,\" i.e. police. My second guess is she dies alone, ill, and homeless, because her support network abandons her.\n\nNeither of those happens, I was surprised! So, no, there is no shocking or tragic climax or denouement. . . But in this book's defense, it comes across as realistic! It's possible the author knew these revolutionary \"underground\" people and cobbled together a story of what went down.\n\nThe major theme, aside from how the U S of A is corrupted, cruel, and bloated, is how women are struggling for a place in society. They get caught up in love and trouble. The idea of \"Free Love\" was all nonsense, where men did pretty much whatever they wanted, and the women received the guilt, housekeeping duties, and babies.\n\nMarch 14, 2021\n\nMarge Piercy has been somewhat of a hit and miss author for me. I simply adored her 1970 novel, Dance the Eagle to Sleep, but was so-so on what I know is her big hit, Woman on the Edge of Time. Originally published in 1979, Vida is the story of Vida Asch as she starts to hit middle age and racks up nearly a decade on the run from the authorities for her role in a group of student radicals turned urban guerrillas, who bombed corporate headquarters and army recruitment centres in the early 1970s. As members of her network are plucked off one by one by the police and the political tide well and truly turns against her, not only is her life a harsh day to day struggle to avoid capture.,she has to contend with an existential crisis in her beliefs. Vida, like everything I have read of Piercy’s is beautifully written. But what really brought this story to life for me is how eerily similar aspects of the student radical milieu she depicts are to the one I experienced in 1980s Melbourne. I actually found my edition of Vida, with this visually amazing cover (released by my publisher PM Press), in a box of books left by a roadside. In the words of the late Abbie Hoffman, ‘steal this book’.\n\nAugust 19, 2012\n\nI adored this book. Marge Piercy has captured the lives of those involved with politics in the sixties, including tough dialogs which confront the ideology of \"free love\" and \"community\" in practice.\n\n\"'But he's miserable,' Jimmy had said. 'Under it all, it hurts him. Why can't you make it up?'\n\n'No!' she had said to Jimmy. 'I don't want him that way.'\n\n'For the group,' Jimmy Pleaded.\n\n'I am not a thing to be given to him to keep him happy. I will not fuck him for political reasons.' Her bluntness had shut Jimmy up.\"\n\nThe entanglement of family, love, life and \"life underground\" are brought to the front of this novel. Piercy evocatively captures the difficulty of living on the outside of culture expectations.\n\nApril 28, 2012\n\nPrior to reading this, I had read mostly Piercy's science fiction, which is excellent. This is a story set in the 70s of a 60s radical on the run. Her politics. her lovers both male and female. Her struggles. Her hopes. Her running from the law. An adrenaline high that pauses every once in a while for hot sex. A feminist statement. A radical tribute to those who fought authority. Very sympathetic characters. Good stuff.\n\nJuly 18, 2012\n\nMaybe it's because I didn't choose the life of a radical revolutionary that I often find myself fascinated by narratives with such figures--particularly women who not only think \"fuck the man\" but make bombs. Which is not to say that I have or ever wanted to make bombs.\n\nIf you allow yourself to go deep enough into Piercy's narrative about Vida, you can certainly become just as paranoid as Vida about who may be listening to or watching you. In fact, Vida's family, friends and lovers must remember NOT to call her Vida. They can call her Peregrine, Vinny, or one of her other code names, Vida, needless to say, is on the run: forced to go underground after one of the original members of \"the Network,\" an anti-war Leninist-Marxist group of radicals that Vida becomes apart of in the 60s, turns out to be a police informer.\n\nBut this novel isn't just about Vida's activities as a revolutionary, it's also a convoluted love story as Vida encounters old and new lovers. Indeed how do such things as intimacy and sex contribute to the revolution? Such a question emphasizes the way in which the body, one's material presence, intersects with politics, the economy, the government, the military . . .\n\nThe narrative alternates between the past (late 1960s) and present (early 1980s), ending on an abrupt and fairly negative note about the effectiveness and sustainability of radical, revolutionary endeavors (which actually worked for me instead of befuddling or disappointing me--maybe because I am the cynical academic type that the book occasionally pokes fun at). I\n\nappreciate Piercy's ability to construct complex and convincing characters as well as her meticulous attention to historical and social detail. Yet, I probably wouldn't recommend this fairly long book to anyone who wasn't particularly interested in the political and feminist landscape of the US in the 1960s or who, like me, can't get enough of reading about women on the run from the law and who blow shit up.\n\nAs a side note, I think this book could be interestingly and rewardingly compared to Doris Lessing's The Good Terrorist (about a British Leninist-Marxist female radical in the 1980s).\n\nMarch 2, 2018\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The characters feel so real, and even though some some of their actions and mannerisms infuriated me, that made them real. The ending was somewhat abrupt, but there was some big picture broadening. I think part of Piercy's style is to keep your mind invested through to the end, so she leaves some unraveled ends to keep the theme percolating.\n\nIn today's political climate, I could easily situate Vida. It made me cringe at points, but it also inspired me. Definitely worth reading if you want to satisfy your Resistance urge but also want to be entertained by a story.\n\nJanuary 17, 2009\n\nRead this long long ago, the tension and seriousness in it was more than even I liked. .. Curious now again though.\n\nAnd though, thinking back, I think one conclusion I drew from this regarding my own life is that I didn't want to be politically active in these ways to these extents, with these results. I certainly wouldn't want to try and raise a kid with having had all of that.. tails unmanageable. So in that way, it was a good life-choice-exploration book for me. Now, this is still without having read it in 20 years, so my memory might be faulty..\n\nJanuary 26, 2016\n\nInteresting novel about a woman who has been living underground for years to avoid the attention of the authorities after being identified as a member of a radical terrorist group. Captures a sense of the struggles, not only of people trying to make a difference politically, but of fugitives from justice and the homeless. Clearly based to some extent on the plight of the fugitive Weathermen.\n\nJuly 4, 2018\n\nA rambling saga of one woman’s experience in the radical underground of the 60s and 70s. Lots of sex, jerk guys and car trips. Not as much music, drugs and art in this scene. She’s a militant but the book selves into her brain and her human petty thoughts. The one I read has a great cover not shown on good reads. ‘She’s beautiful when she’s angry’\n\nApril 12, 2008\n\nThis book is a roller-coaster ride of emotions both within the story itself and reflecting likewise in this reader. I'm just shy of two-thirds of the way through it and recently passed the May 4, 1970 event at Kent State as seen through the filter of this band of characters who are among the activists of that era -- the late sixties and early seventies. I am being reminded of The Golden Notebook also as comparisons seem to arise readily enough. This is a Piercy offering which I had somehow missed previously and I'm enjoying it a great deal in spite of the emotional toll it demands at intervals.\n\nWow. Another huge serendipitous reading experience from Piercy. Powerful and disturbing and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the same instant. This one pulled me every which way as I said already and I'm still trying to figure out what was going on that it had such an effect as it had. I think partially because I was of the era but outside that aspect of the population though certainly of the age group. I watched and listened and held outside taking part. Do I feel guilty for having done so because I straddle the line between supporting the beliefs and feeling those beliefs went too far and go too far even in today's political realm? Or do I feel disturbed and angry as I hold those who mirror Piercy's characters accountable for the young lives lost in actions such as Kent State equally with the governmental stances of the time? Am I unsettled yet/yet again at the idea that the slain students could have been my husband's younger brother who did walk past the demonstrations that day on his way to class or the young girls who had come into the dorm a few short years before as I was on my way out into the world and who were for a while under my wing -- sort of a \"big sis\" to welcome them to campus? I think it's a bit of all that -- but though I end the book with as mixed a bunch of emotions as I read it -- I find a new note of compassion and understanding and sadness for those who lived that underground life due to their activities in those years. And I find myself wondering what, if anything, did we really learn from that time in our history? I look at the waste of young lives in Iraq -- and I'm speaking of all the young lives, not just those of American young people. This book reverbrated like a Chinese gong inside my being, can you tell?\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nSeptember 1, 2013\n\nNot one of my favourite Piercy novels, but a good read nonetheless. Two things I didn't really like: all the characters speak the same way, if I don't pay close attention to who is supposed to be talking then I wouldn't be able to guess from their manner of speaking, as there are almost no characteristic quirks or mannerisms (except for Natalie's occasional 'shvesterlein'); and I didn't buy Vida's love for Joel. Maybe it's because I found it thoroughly incomprehensible why a strong, sensible woman like Vida would fall for a whiny, passive-aggressive boy whose idea of love is to control her with jealousy.\n\nOctober 11, 2013\n\nI loved this book. It was an emotional rollercoaster and the Marxism-Leninism and misogyny of many of the characters was infuriating and it was such an intense picture of life in clandestinity. Goddamn this book is so good.\n\nSeptember 30, 2008\n\nI didn't finish this one as I got super bored with the whole 60's activist thing.\n\nJanuary 13, 2012\n\nWith M.F. Beal's Amazon One, this is the best account of women in the Weather Underground produced while the group was still active. I'm glad PM's getting it back in circulation.\n\nNovember 6, 2022\n\nAs a student witnessed the upheavals in urban Detroit in the Sixties and then was on one of the most radical campuses (one where the author also spent time) I was fully exposed to the philosophy and personalities behind the Radical movement, including being invited to an SDS meeting that was to end in an orgy (which I realized at the time was a way to draw the inexperienced into a reset of morals and ideas--and to which I said, uh, no thanks. Women usually pay too high a price for that foolishness.) The author and I must have crossed paths many many times but we never met--she was not only a student earlier than my years, at the same school, but later, resident artist where I lived on campus. So I have sympathy for the main character Vida and understand her from the aspect of radicals of the times who fled from safe house to safe house to avoid the authorities. I could believe that over years, she would, as the novel unfolds, develop a lifestyle of distrust and homeless couch-surfing to survive; the enemies in power have long memories and a thirst for revenge.\n\nIn fact, in a way the main character Vida IS Marge Piercy, had she chosen a political career rather than a literary one, and the love interest Joel, 10 years younger than Vida is modeled on the author's own much younger husband in real life. Joel awakens the sensual, loving side of Vida, who distrusts everyone and everything and has taken that distrust to a career level while the radical movment moves along into new directions. Vida writes papers no one reads, past comrades settle down, her husband is making a child with another woman. Vida is devoted to her radical life but is now, pretty much obsolete, trapped by her own shrewdness in evading arrest for violent acts in a revolution that failed--or has changed beyond her recognition and she has stayed in the box she built instead of growing.\n\nAt the end, she is trapped by her own fixity of identity as a fugitive revolutionary, and it is one of the saddest and most physical passages of writing I've ever experienced. Her lover is in danger, and sensing the danger to herself, she is literally unable to move toward him. The aroma of a bag of garlic bagels she is bringing to a doomed breakfast, symbolizes the allure amd beckoning of living now and for today and leaving the past behind. But Vida's legs are fixed to the pavement by some magnetic force, and she tosses the bag away-- defeated by the faults of her virtues, which no longer serve her or any revolution. I had to re-read the end chapter five times in a row to admire the writing.\n\nI have this up there as one of my three favorite Piercy novels, of course \"Woman on the Edge of Time\" is a masterpiece, \"He, She and It\" is a dystopian view that shakes you, and this novel, the story of the end of a revolution and one character's inability to evolve, is a tragedy. I put Piercy up there with the best American novelists and her work I think will endure for its originality and skill. She is perhaps now known more for her poetry--and poetry has a way of enduring centuries, so I have no fear her work will be forgotten.\n\nJuly 5, 2020\n\ni started out not loving this book. i mentioned that to my sister who had loaned it to me. my 6-year old nephew overheard me and asked me why. he said it is important, instead of just disagreeing, to ask why. i realized i didn't have a good answer. in part, i think i didn't like vida, and i was annoyed that i had to spend so much time with her. i think there was also something missing from the editing. what i mean is that, at times, sentences or paragraphs seemed out of place, disrupting the flow of reading. every other page, there was something written in a way which confused me, and it made me pause and lose the train of the story. often it was dialogue, sentences said in a way that didn't flow. one one occasion, after pages of ice and snow there are ripening tomatoes, all stuff i think a good editor would have caught.\n\nbut as i progressed through the book and started piecing together the narrative, all the interconnectedness of the characters, i started liking it more. by the end of the book, i was sad it was over and wanted more.\n\nthere were a few characters who i never had a sense of. i forget who jimmy is, for instance. he never stuck out to me, and blended in with all the others. and i wish i knew his story, knew how/why he and belinda were killed. but i was surprised by the depth of the characters and their transformation over decades. i came to feel for roger and natalie. i related to leigh and his desire for a stable home life. in fact, i totally related to the idealism, turned to jadedness? turned to a desire for stability and self-preservation in the whole community. it felt really close to home in a lot of ways, and i was impressed with the complexity and humanity with which marge piercy described the trajectory of a whole movement, a whole generation (?)\n\ni also appreciate the moral ambiguity. while i never liked kevin and wanted to kick him in the shins, and while i found leigh and even vida horribly sexist, i got a sense of the culture they were operating in, and instead of feeling judgemental i could see them as part of a complicated history, one with no clear rights or wrongs. i am too young to have been a part of this specific antiwar movement, but as someone who has been involved with various activist movements, i think the depiction is beautifully accurate in all its complexities.\n\nApril 2, 2018\n\n\"'He looks mean,' she said stubbornly. 'He marches into the kitchen like he owns it and pulls out half the refrigerator. Then he helps himself and leaves it for me to clean up.'\n\n'Kevin's a real radical, down to his toes,' Leigh said, taking the male side at once. 'Good instinctive hatred of capitalism. He knows where and how he's been oppressed.'\n\n'And he plans to oppress Lohania and me as much as he can.'\n\n'You don't like working-class men, you know that? Only intellectuals like me.'\"\n\n[...]\n\n\"As she put the beer away, only the photographs remained on the table. She rifled them briefly. Aaesthetic poses of the picturesque Third World. How would you like it, Karen baby, if some photographer from Kenya marched into your kitchen and your bathroom and snapped photos of you at your colorful native pursuits? American woman wearing hair dryer. American women at appendage coloring rite. American man shortening grass in ritual area.\"\n\n[...]\n\n\"Her hands were red and chapped, scarred, discolored, a map of farm labor learned at it was awkwardly done. Plowing, sowing: once these had borne metaphors. Separate the wheat from the chaff, the little left idea mongers quoted who had never seen a sheaf of wheat in their lives, let alone been presented, as the women had, with a fifty-pound sack of hard red winter wheat berries Bill had won in a poker game and the injunction to make bread of them.\"\n\nMarge Piercy writes brilliantly. I found this novel slightly harder to enjoy than her City of Lights, City of Darkness or Sex Wars. Possibly this is just because the more recent time period makes its issues hit closer to home. The main characters are a group of leftists in hiding to escape punishment for their 1960s anti-Vietnam War bombings. With the end of that war, the relevance of their actions is in question. Vida's sister Nathalie, who never went underground represents a different set of choices: Nathalie always saw the oppression of women (including within the extreme left) as a crucial challenge. While Vida must devote her physical and mental energy to hiding from the FBI, Nathalie remains free to help battered women flee their husbands. The book is intense, page-turning, and leaves plenty of open questions to ponder.\n\nAugust 22, 2018\n\nVida is probably the kind of thing where either you're going to be able to get* it or you're not.\n\nI got it, but I'm not sure if I liked reading this book. I know I don't think it's especially well-written**, but nonetheless I am fascinated by it, particularly with regard to how Piercy chooses to convey (or not convey) the characters' political stances and that the book was written and published prior to the 1981 Brink's robbery.\n\nPeople to whom I would recommend this book:\n\n- Anyone who has survived a claustrophobic fringe lefty activist/social scene where everybody sleeps with everybody and from which you will immediately be cast out if you toe the ideological line by suggesting that maybe misogyny isn't a bourgeois issue or whatever.\n\n- Anyone who has survived an activist scene in where people spend more time arguing about terminology and creating internal documents than anything else.\n\n- Anyone who has known people who go around repeating verbatim talking points from the last Leftbook post/zine/whatever they read two minutes ago. Or if you've ever believed a political something and not known why you believed it.\n\n- People who like stories about sisters and sisterhood.\n\n- People who are interested in tracking depictions of homosexuality/bisexuality through time.\n\n- Aspiring screenwriters! I feel like Vida would really shine in a television adaptation with an ensemble cast.\n\n* as in, understand on an intimate level\n\n**There are, like, five questionable sex scenes within the first fifty pages; thankfully they're less frequent after that.\n\nOctober 24, 2016\n\nI said something to my mum the other day, something along the lines of \"By golly what a capitalist feministical oppressive society we live in\". Wasn't my best line. However it caused my mum to immediately get into her room and a book. That book was Vida. She said that it was time that I read this, so I guess I have now passed some sort of rite of passage.\n\nThe book was alright. Much like the woman of the time who refused to be put into boxes so does the book itself. I had trouble classifying it but landed on it being a cross between a crime novel and a political novel. I had no idea. I internally groaned while reading the first page thinking the characters where highly stereotypical, but they weren't. The book grew on me, and 2 pages from the end I found myself realising that crap I won't know how it all ends, what happens in the future. I thought I could just keep on reading till infinity....\n\nHope you have a nice activistical day.\n\nMay 14, 2024\n\ni truly wished that i enjoyed this book more because i absolutely love marge piercy but this one didn’t sit as easily with me. i think her science fiction is what i prefer more. it felt especially salient to read this right now considering the uptick of political action on college campuses with encampments which feels very reminiscent of the earlier 60s SAW protests shown here. overall i really enjoyed the earlier timeline and didn’t especially like the later one. that was honestly my biggest issue, is that it was just oh so realistic. i have no problem with straightforward or realistic storytelling but it was nearly banal for me and i kept getting confused by jargon. furthermore i didn’t care for a single man (except for pelican because that’s a killer name) and especially despised joel? the beauty of the character building was with the relationships centering women such as with natalie, lohania, and eva. overall this book could work for someone but i’m not the one.\n\nApril 25, 2023\n\nI found myself slogging through the second half of this overlong novel based on revolutionary history in America in the !960s and '70s, sometimes wandering into the 80s.\n\nHowever, Piercy captures the idealism, demand for change, liaisons of various types, need to hide in clear sight, gender issues, educational goals, and utter hatred of the Vietnam War and the governments that lied and kept it going from Kennedy through Nixon.\n\nWhile I was not active in the ways of the novel's characters, I did help friends escape to Canada, hosted a few who were active, and tried as a young teacher to educate my students fairly.\n\nPiercy's book returns me to those decades of my youth.\n\nThis was a worthwhile return for me, albeit an often confusing one given Piercy's technique and the huge number of characters.\n\nJuly 20, 2018\n\nI picked up this book bc Marge Piercy’s name came up numerous times while I was researching feminism & science fiction—so I figured anything she wrote had to be good! This was not sci-fi, but that didn’t deter me. However, this was a disappointing read. Though well written and organized, the story leaves much to be desired. Is it a romance novel? I can’t tell. There’s not enough romance for it to be a true romance, but not enough of the political fugitive plot line for it to be a book in whatever genre that would entail. All of the romances were exhausting, some of the politics upheld by the main character made her extremely unlikeable, and absolutely nothing ended in a satisfying way.\n\nNovember 10, 2021\n\nIncredible work of feminist literature. In the days when feminism consisted of fighting against fascism. A novel about the Weather Underground which were fascist criminals themselves who didn’t support the Black Panther Party but nevertheless appeared ignorantly and naively to themselves to be fighting on the right side. Shows the beauty of femininity through the eyes of a feminist. How even living underground womanhood can be expressed to the fullest extent. The ending is remarkable!\n\nDecember 23, 2021\n\nI was caught up in feelings of nostalgia and yearnings like a car crash that you pass by and can’t look away from. Reminded me of so many people and experiences of my days being so obsessed with social change despite my timeline being 30 years later. Vida does a great job of capturing conversations and ideas and struggles of the activists of the times. Highly recommend."
