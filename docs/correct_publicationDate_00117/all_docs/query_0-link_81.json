        "text": "Monica J. Casper\n\nIn 2012, Knopf brought out Marge Piercy’s eighteenth poetry book, The Hunger Moon: New & Selected Poems 1980-2010, in paperback. Other recent poetry includes The Crooked Inheritance, Colors Passing Though Us, and What Are Big Girls Made Of. Piercy has published 17 novels, most recently Sex Wars. Others include Gone to Soldiers; Three Women; He, She, and It; and Women on the Edge of Time. PM Press just republished Dance The Eagle To Sleep, Vida, and Braided Lives, all with new introductions by Piercy. Her first collection of short stories, The Cost Of Lunch, Etc., is just out (PM Press). Her memoir, Sleeping With Cats, was published by Harper Perennial in 2002. A new poetry collection and a book of essays are in the works. Marge Piercy’s work has been translated into 19 languages and she’s given readings, workshops, and lectures at well over 450 venues in the U.S. and abroad. Her CD is Louder, We Can’t Hear You Yet.

If so, how?\n\nMarge: Feminism, or women’s liberation as we used to call it – a more accurate name in my opinion, is the branch of politics that believes that the suppression of women and the treating of women as objects or beings subordinate to men is a primary oppression. Until and unless women are truly equal and free, no justice is possible.\n\nMy first years in the second wave, I would work only with women and only in women-only places. It was opposition to the various Middle-Eastern wars that brought me back into mixed groups. I am now very active in a group trying to shut down Pilgrim nuclear power plant, a Fukushima clone. I live on Cape Cod and there cannot be any evacuation for us when the power plant blows. We don’t want it, we don’t need it.\n\nMonica: How does it feel to be a feminist icon?\n\nMarge: I don't know. Why don’t you ask one?\n\nMonica: You subscribe to the women’s studies listserv. Could you talk about your relationship, as a writer, to “academic feminism”? What attracts you to women’s studies as field, and are there qualities that repel you?\n\nMarge: I’m on that more to keep an eye on what’s happening with women’s studies than to take much of an active part. I’m on a listserv of feminist activists in which I am far more active. I find women’s history and prehistory fascinating. I am less sanguine about the switch to gender studies. I am much less sanguine about the academizing of women’s issues. Much of what women’s studies focuses on today is irrelevant to most women’s lives and problems in order to be academically respectable.\n\nMonica: You’ve done political work alongside your writing, engaging in the women’s movement as well as struggles against the Vietnam War and more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Do these activities—writing and protesting—draw on the same or different parts of you? And which enables you to activate those parts of you that feel most feminist?\n\nMarge: I get involved in what lands on me most heavily. At times, it was women’s health issues. At times, domestic violence and rape. Always since I was eighteen and had to abort myself and almost bled to death, I have fought for a women’s right to choose. That never stops. But war appears to me to engage with almost all of these issues, including rape and women’s health. Women breathe the same air as men and drink the same water and are subject to the same high prices of drugs and the testing subsidized by Big Pharma. Women are victims of war. Women are victims of ecological disaster. Women are victims of radiation and the leakage of plutonium, tritium, and all the wonderful other byproducts of the subsidized nuclear power industry. These are all women’s issues as much as the lack of women speaking in the media on all these issues. The war on women is also the war on children, by the way. Protect fetuses and then the protection stops.\n\nWriters are citizens like plumbers and doctors. We suffer the same consequences from the bad and dangerous choices of politicians who are bought and sold and who have ideas that would not be out of place in the Dark Ages – where they truly belong or during that dandy period when thousands of women were burned at the stake after being intensively tortured because of male fantasies and fears.\n\nIf we ignore what is being passed into laws, we deserve what we get.\n\nMonica: Throughout your career, you’ve created fascinating, strong, vulnerable, amazing, unforgettable women. I fell in love with Connie Ramos from Woman On the Edge of Time, Bernice Coates in Gone to Soldiers, Jill and Donna in Braided Lives, and of course, Shira Shipman and Vida Asch. Who are your favorite characters, and why?\n\nMarge: I invented them all. I don’t have favorite cats or favorite characters.\n\nMonica: He, She, and It is one of my favorite books of all time—and I’m sure I’m not alone. The book changed my relationship to science fiction, and it also fed my longstanding interest in historical memory, collective trauma, and feminist science studies. I read your novel in relation to Donna Haraway’s essay on the cyborg. Can you tell us how you came to imagine the world inhabited by Shira? What kind of literary and/or political intervention did you hope the novel would be in the George H.W. Bush years?\n\nMarge: Fiction and poetry can’t change anything. All we can hope to do with our writing is change someone’s consciousness. If someone enters the mind and experiences of Connie Ramos, maybe they will see women who are of a lower class than themselves as not less aware, less complicated, less worthy than they consider themselves or their peers to be. People are often judged now by their physique and their ownership of what are considered the proper things to own and dress in. A respected body can be purchased by those with the money and time to buy trainers and gym workouts and plastic surgery.\n\nClimate change, the suppression and increasing poverty of those who do not own enough to count, the erosion of the middle class and the outspoken hatred of those in power for the poor, the ever-increasing power of multinational corporations, the turning of elections into a mixture of spectacle and auction, all are coming true at a far more rapid rate than I anticipated."
