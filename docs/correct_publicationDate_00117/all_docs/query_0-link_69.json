The classic literary feminist novel about artificial intelligence'She is a serious writer who deserves the sort of considered attention which, too often, she does not get...' MARGARET ATWOODIn the middle of the twenty-first century, life as we know it has changed for all time. Shira Shipman's marriage has broken up, and her young son has been taken from her by the corporation that runs her zone, so she has returned to Tikva, the Jewish town where she grew up. There, she is welcomed by Malkah, the brilliant grandmother who raised her, and meets an extraordinary man who is not a man at all, but a unique cyborg implanted with intelligence, emotions- and the ability to kill...",

        "text": "Marge Piercy is every bit as imaginative as H. G. Wells or Isaac Asimov or any of the great fantasists, but she is also a fierce and devoted activist who wants us to be more than passive readers. * GLORIA STEINEM * A triumph of the imagination. Rich, complex, impossible to put down. Every new novel by Marge Piercy is cause for celebration * Alice Hoffman * Piercy's vision of a post-greenhouse-effect, nuclear-blasted world interlaced with the Prague ghetto of 1600, and the efforts of certain people to stay human in both, is threaded with the questions: What is it to be human? ... What does `life' mean?... What are the limits of creativity? As always, Piercy writes with high intelligence, love for the world, ethical passion and innate feminism * Adrienne Rich * HE, SHE AND IT, a ground-breaking example of Jewish feminist fabulation, is a triumph * AMERICAN BOOK REVIEW * One of our boldest writers...like Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, He, She and It finds disturbing trends in contemporary culture. * Los Angeles Times Book Review *"
