        "text": "(1859–1906). French physical chemist Pierre Curie was one of the main founders of modern physics. In 1903 he and his wife, Marie Curie, were corecipients of the Nobel Prize for Physics. The two discovered radium and polonium in their investigation of radioactivity.\n\nPierre Curie was born on May 15, 1859, in Paris, France. He was educated by his father, a doctor. Curie developed a passion for mathematics at the age of 14. He was particularly good at spatial geometry, which was later to help him in his work on crystallography, the study of the structure of crystals. At age 16 he began college, graduating two years later with a bachelor’s degree.\n\nIn 1878 Curie became a laboratory assistant at the Sorbonne in Paris. There he carried out his first work on the calculation of the wavelength of heat waves. This was followed by important studies on crystals, in which he was helped by his elder brother Jacques. They discovered piezoelectricity, or the electrical potential of a crystal when subjected to mechanical pressure. This effect is used in a variety of practical devices such as microphones. Later Pierre formulated the principle of symmetry in crystals, which concerns the impossibility of bringing about a specific physical process in an environment lacking a certain minimal dissymmetry.\n\nCurie was appointed supervisor at the School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry at Paris in 1882. There he began his celebrated studies on magnetism. To aid his experiments, he constructed a sensitive measuring device called a torsion balance. The device, called the Curie balance, is still in use. Among Curie’s more important discoveries was that magnetic properties change when they reach a certain temperature called the Curie point. In 1895 Curie obtained a doctorate of science.\n\nIn the spring of 1894 Curie met Maria (later Marie) Salomea Sklodowska, and they married on July 25, 1895. After Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896, Marie and Pierre Curie began to investigate further. The Curies discovered that the mineral pitchblende was more radioactive than pure uranium. From this mineral in 1898 the couple discovered polonium and then radium. While working with Marie to extract pure substances from ores, Pierre concentrated on the physical study (including luminous and chemical effects) of the new radiations. He subsequently proved the existence of particles that are electrically positive, negative, and neutral; British physicist Ernest Rutherford later called the particles alpha, beta, and gamma rays. Pierre then observed the physiological effects of radium, thus leading the way to its use in cancer treatments."
