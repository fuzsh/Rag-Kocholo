        "text": "French/Polish\n\nCurie familyMembersConnected familiesDistinctions\n\nThe Curie family is a French-Polish family from which hailed a number of illustrious scientists. Pierre Curie, his Polish-born wife Marie Skłodowska-Curie, their daughter, Irène, and son-in-law, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, are its most prominent members. Five members of the family in total were awarded a Nobel Prize, with Marie winning twice.[1][2][3][4]\n\nMarie and Pierre shared a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and Marie was awarded a second one in chemistry in 1911, making her the only person in history to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific disciplines. Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935. Henry Richardson Labouisse, Jr., the spouse of Irène's younger sister, Ève Curie, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965.\n\nThe chemical element curium (number 96) is named after Marie and Pierre.[5]\n\nWhile Pierre Curie died at age 46 from an accident, Marie, Irène and Frédéric died from diseases likely caused by their exposure to radiation during their scientific experiments.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nBernoulli family\n\nLangevin family"
