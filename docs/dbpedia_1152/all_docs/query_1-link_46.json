        "text": "Neither he nor she said a word about what \"Natasha nursing him\" might mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations.\n\nPrincess Mary could not quite make out what he had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender caressing word such as he had never used to her before.\n\nMy days were not days of the week, bearing the stamp of any heathen deity, nor were they minced into hours and fretted by the ticking of a clock; for I lived like the Puri Indians, of whom it is said that \"for yesterday, today, and tomorrow they have only one word, and they express the variety of meaning by pointing backward for yesterday forward for tomorrow, and overhead for the passing day.\"\n\nA healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts.\n\nIt is not necessary that one should be able to define every word and give it its principal parts and its grammatical position in the sentence in order to understand and appreciate a fine poem.\n\nRostov, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following him.\n\nShe wanted to ask him how long he would stay at the ranch, but she couldn't think of a way to word the question that didn't sound insensitive.\n\nIt would, I think, be hard to make her feel just how to pronounce DICTIONARY without her erring either toward DICTIONAYRY or DICTION'RY, and, of course the word is neither one nor the other.\n\nProbably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots.\n\nNot by a single word had Nicholas alluded to the fact that Prince Andrew's relations with Natasha might, if he recovered, be renewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of this.\n\nBut that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war.\n\nAnd do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them and, my word, they didn't let us get near before they just threw down their muskets and went on their knees.\n\nThe first word on the case Sackler and DeLeo were arguing about had come by way of a call from the Norfolk, Virginia Police Department the prior afternoon, Dean's day off.\n\nOne could have traveled round the word many times while I trudged my weary way through the labyrinthine mazes of grammars and dictionaries, or fell into those dreadful pitfalls called examinations, set by schools and colleges for the confusion of those who seek after knowledge.\n\nI know I'm pigheaded but I can't tell you how much I appreciate how you all embrace this with only my word.\n\nI just ask one thing; will you take my word for one item and if you stop this vehicle you'll have more reward than you'll know what to do with.\n\nI will answer your questions and give you the information you need to get through this, but if you dare say one more disparaging word about my best friend, this will not end well for you.\n\nThe term was, however,, particularly applied, in O.E., to a gallows or cross, especially to the Holy Cross on which Christ was crucified, the sense in which the word survives.\n\nThe only other important term which requires to be noted here is talweg, a word introduced from the German into French and English, and meaning the deepest line along the valley, which is necessarily occupied by a stream unless the valley is dry.\n\nAt first he did not see anything that disturbed him; for word had gone before him to remove from sight everything that might be displeasing or painful.\n\nBut he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face caused his mother to await with terror, and which would perhaps have forever remained a cruel memory to them both.\n\nGod is my witness, I didn't know-\" he repeated, stressing the word \"God\" so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her father or at Natasha.\n\nThen he went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him--for this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her--but that if she loved him she need only say the word yes, and no human power could hinder their bliss.\n\nHe felt that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world.\n\nSure, I said the D word first, but I wasn't the one who said I wanted to get away from all the arguing.\n\nAs in, when I say the word boundary, you stop whatever it is you're doing or about to do and leave me alone.\n\nOne of the results of these investigations was to extend the meaning of the word mechanism, and comprise under it all laws which obtain in the phenomenal world, not excepting the phenomena of life and mind.\n\nThese rules were borrowed almost word for word from the project drawn up at the Brussels international conference of 1874, which, though never ratified, was practically incorporated in the army regulations issued by the Russian government in connexion with the war of 18 77-7 8.\n\nBy early writers the word was generally given as an equivalent of the Linnaean Loxia, but that genus has been found to include many forms not now placed in the same family.\n\nIn the language of the Christian Church the word \" infallibility \" is used in a more absolute sense, as the freedom from all possibility of error guaranteed by the direct action of the Spirit of God.\n\nSome see the guarantee, or at least the indication, of infallibility in the consensus of the Church (quod semper, ubique, et ab omnibus) expressed from time to time in general councils; others see it in the special grace conferred upon St Peter and his successors, the bishops of Rome, as heads of the Church; others again see it in the inspired Scriptures, God's Word.\n\nIt is from the particular application of the word to sheep that \"flock\" is used of the Christian Church in its relation to the \"Good Shepherd,\" and also of a congregation of worshippers in its relation to its spiritual head.\n\nThe history, indeed, of many a word lies hid in its equivocal uses; and it in no way derogates from the dignity of the highest poetry to gain strength and variety from the ingenious application of the same sounds to different senses, any more than from the contrivances of rhythm or the accompaniment of imitative sounds.\n\nAccording to the New English Dictionary, although the origin of the word \"cat\" is unknown, yet the name is found in various languages as far back as they can be traced.\n\nThe word itself represents the Mongol Khan-Balik, \"the city of the khan,\" or emperor, the title by which Peking continues, more or less, to be known to the Mongols and other northern Asiatics.\n\nThis has led in some quarters to a desire that the moderator should be clothed with greater responsibility and have his period of office prolonged; should be made, in fact, more of a bishop in the Anglican sense of the word.\n\nHe was a straightforward and honourable man, who tried his best to do his duty in a position that had been forced upon him, and was in no sense of the word his own seeking.\n\nThis last word is the regular French for \"knight,\" and is chiefly used in English for a member of certain foreign military or other orders, particularly of the Legion of Honour.\n\nIn this way he has gone over a great portion of the field of physics, and in many cases has either said the last word for the time being, or else started new and fruitful developments.\n\nA more directly religious element, it is true, was introduced by the practice of attending the synagogue service; but it is to be The grammatical inflexions of the word \"Sabbath\" would show that it is a feminine form, properly shabbat-t for shabbat-t.\n\nThere is no evidence that these days were called shabattu, a word which is rendered by umu nuh libbi, \" day of rest of the heart,\" and has been thought to be the origin of Sabbath.\n\nThat the recurrence of the market determined the length of the week seems clear from the Wajagga custom of naming the days after the markets they visit, as well as from the fact that on the Congo the word for week is the same as the word for market.\n\nThe precursor of the thegn was the gesith, the companion of the king or great lord, the member of his comitatus, and the word thegn began to be used to describe a military gesith.\n\nChadwick (Studies on AngloSaxon Institutions, 1905) says that \"the sense of subordination must have been inherent in the word from the earliest time,\" but it has no connexion with the German dienen, to serve.\n\nThe word potential does not imply that this energy is not real; it exists in potentiality only in the sense that it is stored away in some latent manner; but it can be drawn upon without limit for mechanical work.\n\nThe word is still sometimes employed in this sense, as of the ship's telegraph, by means of which orders are mechanically transmitted from the navigating bridge to the engine room, but when used without qualification it usually denotes telegraphic apparatus worked by electricity, whether the signals that express the words of the message are visual, auditory or written.\n\nThe speed of a cable is given in words per minute, the conventional number of five letters per word being understood, though in actual practice, owing to the extensive use of special codes, the number of letters per word is really between eight and nine; and this forms a considerable factor in lowering the earning capacity of a cable.\n\nThe radiations interfere in an optical sense of the word, and in some directions reinforce each other and in other directions neutralize each other, so making the resultant radiation greater in some directions than others.\n\nIn a word, he is from first to last an undomesticated and savage animal rendered serviceable by stupidity alone, without much skill on his master's part, or any co-operation on his own, save that of an extreme passiveness.\n\nHenceforth it was impossible to publish or to utter a word which might offend the despots of church or state; and the Italians had to amuse their leisure with the polite triflings of academics.\n\nConstituent assemblies met and voted for unity under Victor Emmanuel, but the king could not openly accept the proposal owing to the emperors opposition, backed by the presence of French armies in Lombardy; at a word from Napoleon there might have been an Austrian, and perhaps a Franco-Austrian, invasion of central Italy.\n\nFor the world as a whole, however, he postulated a beginning in time (whence his use of the word creation), and further supposed that the impulse of organization which was conveyed to chaotic matter by the Creator issued from a central point in the infinite space spreading gradually outwards.\n\nThe word is derived from the general resemblance of the texture of plant substance to that of a textile fabric, and dates from a period when the fundamental constitution of plant substance from individual cells was not yet discovered.\n\nThe word metamorphosis cannot, in fact, be used any longer in its original sense, for the change which it implied does not normally occur in ontogeny, and in phylogeny the idea is more accurately expressed by the term differentiation.\n\nCertain ancient stringed instruments were played with a plectrum or plucker made of the quill of a bird's feather, and the word has thus been used of a plectrum made of other material and differing in shape, and also of an analogous object for striking the strings in the harpsichord, spinet or virginal.\n\nApplying this principle to the art of poetry, and analysing, line by line and even word by word, the works of great poets, he deduced the law that the beauty of poetry consists in the accuracy, beauty and harmony of individual expression.\n\nInvestigations of every kind which have been based on original sources of knowledge may be styled \"research,\" and it may be said that without \"research\" no authoritative works have been written, no scientific discoveries or inventions made, no theories of any value propounded; but the word also has a somewhat restricted meaning attached to it in current usage.\n\nIt appears also in the Bayeux Tapestry, and it is the only word used when any legal distinction had to be drawn between classes of men in the English kingdom.\n\nTo form a true understanding of what is strictly implied in the word \"nobility,\" in its social as opposed to a purely moral sense, it is needful to distinguish its meaning from that of several words with which it is likely to be confounded.\n\nYet nobility, in some shape or another, has existed in most places and times of the world's history, while the British peerage is an institution purely local, and one which has actually hindered the existence of a nobility in the sense which the word bears in most other countries.\n\nThis last is a word which is often greatly abused; but, whenever it is used with any regard to its true meaning, it is a word strictly political, implying a particular form of government.\n\nTo not a few it would seem a contradiction to speak of nobility or aristocracy in a republic. Yet, though many republics have eschewed nobility, there is nothing in a republican, or even in a democratic, form of government inconsistent with the existence of nobility; and it is only in a republic that aristocracy, in the strict sense of the word, can exist.\n\nBut that they are the same is proved by the use of the French word gentilhomme, a word which has pretty well passed out of modern use, but which, as long as it remained in use, never lost its true meaning.\n\nThe word \"gentleman\" has lost its original meaning in a variety of other uses, while the word \"nobleman\" has come to be confined to members of the peerage and a few of their immediate descendants.\n\nPatricians and plebeians went on as orders defined by law, till the distinction died out in the confusion of things under the empire, till at last the word \"patrician\" took quite a new meaning.\n\nThat coat-armour has been lavishly granted and often assumed without right, that the word \"gentleman\" has acquired various secondary senses, proves nothing; that is the natural result of a state of things in which the status of gentry carries with it no legal advantage, and yet is eagerly sought after on social grounds.\n\nIn short, there is no real nobility in England; for the class which answers to foreign nobility has so long ceased to have any practical privileges that it has long ceased to be looked on as a nobility, and the word nobility has been transferred to another class which has nothing answering to it out of the three British kingdoms. 2 This last ' This statement is mainly interesting as expressing the late Professor Freeman's view; it is, however, open to serious criticism.\n\nThey had no places of worship, nor, though they had sacred wooden figures, is there any reason to consider that they were idolaters in the strict sense of the word.\n\nThe word Rus, in former times wrongly connected with the tribal name Rhoxolani, is more probably derived from Ruotsi, a Finnish name for the Swedes, which seems to be a corruption of the Swedish rothsmenn, \" rowers \" or \" seafarers.\"\n\nAs a legislative body the powers of the Council are co-ordinate with those of the Duma; in practice, however, it has seldom if ever initiated legislation.6 The Duma of the Empire or Imperial Duma (Gosudarstvennaya Duma), which forms the Lower House of the Russian parliament, consists (since the ukaz of the znd of June 1907) on the 27th of April 1906, while the name and princi p le of autocracy was jealously preserved, the word \" unlimited \" vanished.\n\nThere can be no reasonable doubt that the Levite here was member of a priestly tribe or order, and this view is confirmed by the discovery of what is really the same word in south Arabian inscriptions.\n\nThe word holiness (qodesh) in primitive Hebrew usage partook of the nature of taboo, and came to be applied to whatever, whether thing or person, stood in close relation to deity and belonged to him, and could not, therefore, be used or treated like other objects not so related, and so was separated or stood apart.\n\nIt is essentially the path which may be summed up in the word Judaism, though, as will be shown in the sequel, Judaism came to include many other factors.\n\nThe snake, however, to which the word \"asp\" has been most commonly applied is undoubtedly the haje of Egypt, the spy-slange or spitting snake of the Boers (Naja haje), one of the very poisonous Elarinae, from 3 to 4 ft.\n\nThe constitution as adopted limited the suffrage to adult white males, but this provision was annulled by the fifteenth amendment to the Federal constitution; and in 1880 amendments to the state constitution were adopted striking out the word \" white \" from the suffrage clause and adding a new article granting rights of suffrage and office holding without regard to race, colour or previous condition of servitude.\n\nThe story of the baetylus, or stone swallowed by Saturn under the belief that it was his son, the Cretan Zeus, seems to cover the same idea and has been derived from the same Semitic word.\n\nAn erroneous derivation of the word pascha from the Greek ircthx iv, \" to suffer,\" thus connected with the sufferings or passion of the Lord, is given by some of the Fathers of the Church, as Irenaeus, Tertullian and others, who were ignorant of Hebrew.\n\nAccording to him the word was first used on the 27th of December 1641 by a disbanded officer named David Hide, who during a riot is reported to have drawn his sword and said he would \"cut the throat of those round-headed dogs that bawled against bishops.\"\n\nWhite soon returned to England for supplies, and having been detained there until 1591 he found upon his return no trace of the colony except the word \" Croatan \" carved on a tree; hence the colony was supposed to have gone away with some friendly Indians, possibly the Hatteras tribe, and proof of the assumption that these whites mingled with Indians is sought in the presence in Robeson county of a mixed people with Indian habits and occasional English names, calling themselves Croatans.\n\nI'd like to help clean up some articles, but I don't have a scan of the original article and find it difficult to know what mangled word is supposed to be.\n\nThe word Orchis is used in a special sense to denote a particular genus of the Orchid family (Orchidaceae); very frequently, also, it is employed in a more general way to indicate any member of that large and very interesting group. It will be convenient here to use the word Orchis as applying to that particular genus which gives its name to the order or family, and to employ the term \"orchid\" in the less precise sense.\n\nThe use of the word \"clergy\" as a plural, though the New English Dictionary quotes the high authority of Cardinal Newman for it, is less rare than wrong; in the case cited \"Some hundred Clergy\" should have been \"Some hundred of the Clergy.\"\n\nThe south-westerly winds which prevail north of the equator during the hot half of the year, to which navigators have given the name of the south-west monsoon (the latter word being a corruption of the Indian name for season), arise from the great diminution of atmospheric pressure over Asia, which begins to be strongly marked with the great rise of temperature in April and May, and the simultaneous relatively higher pressure over the equator and the regions south of it.\n\nMore important still were his services in settling the question of the boundary between the United States and British North America at a time when a single injudicious word would probably have provoked a war.\n\nThe word \"monarchy\" has, however, outlived this original meaning, and is now used, when used at all, somewhat loosely of states ruled over by hereditary sovereigns, as distinct from republics with elected presidents; or for the \"monarchical principle,\" as opposed to the republican, involved in this distinction.\n\nThe monarchical principle was shaken to its foundations by the English revolution of 1688; it was shattered by the French revolution of 1789; and though it survives as a political force, more or less strongly, in most European countries, \"monarchists,\" in the strict sense of the word, are everywhere a small and dwindling minority.\n\nDumont was a Genevese exile, and an old friend of Romilly's, who willingly prepared for him those famous addresses which Mirabeau used to make the Assembly pass by sudden bursts'of eloquent declamation; Claviere helped him in finance, and not only worked out his figures, but even wrote his financial discourses; Lamourette wrote the speeches on the civil constitution of the clergy; Reybaz not only wrote for him his famous speeches on the assignats, the organization of the national guard, and others, which Mirabeau read word for word at the tribune, but even the posthumous speech on succession to the estates of intestates, which Talleyrand read in the Assembly as the last work of his dead friend.\n\nThis suspicion is strengthened by the fact (discovered by von Sybel) that even the very preface to his book is taken almost word for word from Rufinus's translation of Origen's commentary on the epistle to the Romans.\n\nHe was never instituted or inducted to the living of Leyton, but in 1674 he was licensed by the bishop of London to preach and expound the word of God, and to perform the full office of priest and curate while it was vacant, and until his death he received the profits of it.\n\nThe bishop of Dover, however, reported to Cromwell that Parker \"hath ever been of a good judgment and set forth the Word of God after a good manner.\n\nFrom an equally loose application of the word \"fir\" by our older herbalists, it is difficult to decide upon the date of introduction of this tree into Britain; but it was commonly planted for ornamental purposes in the beginning of the 17th century.\n\nOn hearing this message, Mahmud at first reproached Hasan with having caused him to break his word, but the wily treasurer succeeded in turning his master's anger upon Firdousi to such an extent that he threatened that on the morrow he would \"cast that Carmathian (heretic) under the feet of his elephants.\"\n\nThere is no reason in the actual significance of the word why the term \" proboscis \" should be applied to an alternately introversible and eversible tube connected with an animal's body, and yet such is a very customary use of the term.\n\nThe most convincing proof of this is that Origen (i) takes the idea of the immutability of God as the regulating idea of his system, and (2) deprives the historical \"Word made flesh\" of all significance for the true Gnostic. To him Christ appears simply as the Logos who is with the Father from eternity, and works from all eternity, to whom alone the instructed Christian directs his thoughts, requiring nothing more than a perfect - i.e.\n\nManda, on the other hand, continues with the First Life and Mana rabba, and is called his \"beloved son,\" the \"first born,\" \"high priest\" and \"word of life.\"\n\nThe earliest known use of the word Ornithology seems to be in the third edition of Blount's Glossographia (1670), where it is noted as being \" the title of a late Book.\"\n\nNitzsch's name was subsequently dismissed by Cuvier without a word of praise, and in terms which would have been applicable to many another and inferior author, while Temminck, terming Naumann's work an \" ouvrage de luxe \"-it being in truth one of the cheapest for its contents ever published-effectually shut it out from the realms of science.\n\nAgain, the arrangement followed in the Pterylographie was of course based on pterylographical considerations, and we have its author's own word for it that he was persuaded that the limitation of natural groups could only be attained by the most assiduous research into the species of which they are composed from every point of view.\n\nThe word mutzen, to dock, cut off, which first appears in the 14th century, does not help much, though the name of another vestment akin to the almuce - the mozzetta - has been by some traced to it through the Ital.\n\nThus, though the word \" Catholic \" was late in finding its way into the formal symbols of the church, it is clear that it had long been in use in the original sense defined above.\n\nAn isolated use of the word \" catholic \" as a secular legal term survives in Scots law; a catholic creditor is one whose debt is secured over several or over all of the subjects belonging to the debtor.\n\nIn the r3th century the Ponizie was plundered by the Mongols; a hundred years afterwards Olgierd, prince of Lithuania, freed it from their rule, annexing it to his own territories under the name of Podolia, a word which has the same meaning as Ponizie.\n\nThe first settlement within the township was made in 1720 by Dutchmen and Englishmen, who in 1719 had bought from the Indians a tract of land along the Housatonic, called \"Weatogue\" - an Indian word said to mean \"the wigwam place.\"\n\nIt is clear from the treatise of Radbertus Paschasius already quoted that the word \"substance\" was used for reality as distinguished from outward appearance, and that the word \"species\" meant outward appearance as opposed to reality.\n\nThe component parts of a lease are the parties, the recitals (when necessary) setting out such matters as the title of the lessor; the demise or actual letting (the word \" demise \" is ordinarily used, but any term indicating an express intention to make a present letting is sufficient); the parcels in which the extent of the premises demised is stated; the habendum (which defines the commencement and the term of the lease), the reddendum or reservation of rent, and the covenants and conditions.\n\nThus a lessee is under an implied obligation to treat the premises demised in a tenant-like or \" husband-like \" manner, and again, where in a lease by deed the word \" demise \" is used, the lessor probably covenants impliedly for his own title and for the quiet enjoyment of the premises by the lessee.\n\nThe miracles connected with the beginnings of the national history - the period of the Exodus - appear on closer inspection to have been ordinarily natural phenomena, to which a supernatural character was given by their connexion with the prophetic word of Moses.\n\nThere was, in a word, co-ordination rather than subordination; nor did the kings ever attempt to embark on a policy of centralization.\n\nThe siege of Acre, as arduous and heroic in many of its episodes as the siege of Troy, had been begun in the summer of 1189 by Guy de Lusignan, who, captured by Saladin at the battle of Hattin, and released on parole, had at once broken his word and returned to the attack.\n\nThe Greek ecclesiastes means one who takes part in the deliberations of an assembly (ecclesia), a debater or speaker in an assembly (Plato, Gorgias, 452 E), and this is the general sense of the Hebrew word.\n\nThe form may have been suggested by that of the Hebrew word for\" wisdom.\"Koheleth, however, is employed in the book not as a title of wisdom (for\" wisdom \"is never the speaker), but as the independent name of the sage.\n\nIt may be noted that the word \" alembic \" is derived from the Greek \"cup,\" with the Arabic article prefixed, and that the instrument is figured in the MSS.\n\nIn the 3rd codification, however, many provisions have been taken from the 2nd, and these are designated by the word \"antiqua\"; by means of these \"antiqua\" we are enabled in a certain measure to reconstruct the work of Leovigild.\n\nIn England the word \"snail\" in popular language is associated with Gasteropods which inhabit land or fresh water, and which possess large conspicuous spiral shells; terrestrial Gasteropods, in which the shell is rudimentary and concealed, are distinguished as \"slugs.\"\n\nThe early form of the word in English was \"sherris\" (abbreviated from \"sherris-wine\" or \"sherris-sack\"), which was taken to be a plural, and \"sherry\" was formed as a singular by mistake.\n\nIn the more recent hymns of the Rig-Veda and in later India, on the other hand, only evil spirits are understood by asuras, while in Iran the corresponding word ahura was, and ever has continued to be, the designation of God the Lord.\n\nBy a true confession of faith, by every good deed, word and thought, by continually keeping pure his body and his soul, he impairs the power of Satan and strengthens the might of goodness, and establishes a claim for reward upon Ormazd; by a false confession, by every evil deed, word and thought and defilement, he increases the evil and renders service to Satan.\n\nThese are the adjective vigadabhi applied to the stone, and rendered in our translation \"flawless\"; and secondly, the last word, rendered in our translation \"one-eighth part (of the crop).\"\n\nFrom the celebrity of this cemetery as an object of pilgrimage its name became extensively known, and in entire forgetfulness of the origin of the word, catacumbae came to be regarded as a generic appellation for all burial-places of the same kind.\n\nHe had not based his case against the Transvaal on the letter of the Conventions, and regarded the employment of the word \"suzerainty\" merely as an \"etymological question,\" but he realized keenly that the spectacle of thousands of British subjects in the Transvaal in the condition of \"helots\" (as he expressed it) was undermining the prestige of Great Britain throughout South Africa, and he called for \"some striking proof\" of the intention of the British government not to be ousted from its predominant position.\n\nThe first specific legislation on the subject was enacted on the 12th of February 1793, and like the Ordinance for the Northwest Territory and the section of the Constitution quoted above, did not contain the word \"slave\"; by its provisions any Federal district or circuit judge or any state magistrate was authorized to decide finally and without a jury trial the status of an alleged fugitive.\n\nA constitution of 1868 gave suffrage to the blacks, and disfranchised all whites made ineligible to office under the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the national Constitution, and also (practically) those who had by word, pen or vote defended secession.\n\nThus, to say that a pen is an entity and the class of pens is an entity is merely a play upon the word \"entity\"; the second sense of \"entity\" (if any) is indeed derived from the first, but has a more complex signification.\n\nIn a word, he loved his kind as animals, but did not seem to find them as interesting as those furred and feathered.\n\nHe believed in a personal Son of God who was the Reason and Wisdom of God; and he believed that this Son of God really became incarnate though he speaks of him almost invariably as the Word, and attaches little value to his human nature.\n\nWhen the Norsemen came to Greenland they found various remains indicating, as the old sagas say, that there had been people of a similar kind as those they met with in Vinland, in America, whom they called Skraeling (the meaning of the word is uncertain, it means possibly weak people); but the sagas do not report that they actually met the natives then.\n\nThe surname Miaoulis, which was added to his family name of Vokos, or Bokos, is said to be derived from the Turkish word miaoul, a felucca.\n\nThe series of exceptional measures by which that confusion of powers was created constitutes the \"Revolutionary government\" in the strict sense of the word, a government which was principally in vigour during the period called \"the Terror.\"\n\nAitchison also mentions the almond as wild in some parts of Afghanistan, where it is known to the natives as \"beda,m,\" the same word that they apply to the cultivated almond.\n\nThe peach has not, it is true, been found wild in China, but it has been cultivated there from time immemorial; it has entered into the literature and folk-lore of the people; and it is designated by a distinct name, \"to\" or \"tao,\" a word found in the writings of Confucius five centuries before Christ, and even in other writings dating from the 10th century before the Christian era.\n\nIn the reformed Churches the word \"benediction\" is technically confined to the blessing with which the priest or minister dismisses the congregation at the close of the service.\n\nIn the latter sense the word has come to be applied to great ceremonial gatherings like Lord Lytton's durbar for the proclamation of the queen empress in India in 1877, or the Delhi durbar of 1903.\n\nThe old town lies low, and it is traversed by a great number of narrow canals or \" fleets \" (Fleeten) - for the same word which has left its trace in London nomenclature is used in the Low German city - which add considerably to the picturesqueness of the meaner quarters, and serve as convenient channels for the transport of goods.\n\nThe second relation, as we have seen, is not a strict consequence of theory, and experiments to examine it must be treated as an investigation of the limits within which solutions are dilute within the thermodynamic sense of the word, rather than as a test of the soundness of the theory.\n\nWith this the bishop of Exeter (Ornaments Rubric, p. 30) would seem to agree, when he says that \"the customs of the present day do not fully accord with any reasonable interpretation of the rubric. The stole, now nearly universal, is only covered by the rubric if the word ' vestment ' be taken to include it (a very dubious point), and then only at Holy Communion.\"\n\nThe word is commonly used in the Alexandrian Greek translation of the Old Testament (Septuagint) for the Hebrew word (ger) which is derived from a root (gur) denoting to sojourn.\n\nThe word of God shall be preached and made known in the kingdom of Bohemia freely and in an orderly manner by the priests of the Lord...\n\nThe sacrament of the most Holy Eucharist shall be freely administered in the two kinds, that is bread and wine, to all the faithful in Christ who are not precluded by mortal sin - according to the word and disposition of Our Saviour.\n\nThe word denotes in very early French law the portion of lands or money given by fathers and mothers to their sons or daughters on marriage, and usually connotes a renunciation by the latter of any future inheritance; or it may denote the portion given by the eldest son to his brothers and sisters when he was sole inheritor.\n\nThe word apanage is still employed in this sense in French official texts of some Customs; but it was in old public law that it received its definite meaning and importance.\n\nIn any case, it is fairly certain that Tritogeneia means \"water-born,\" although an old interpretation derived it from TpcTCO, a supposed Boeotian word meaning \"head,\" which further points to the name having originated in Boeotia.\n\nThe president of this council, or ruling chief - chosen from among the members of the two recognized reigning families - is called the alake, a word meaning \"Lord of Ake,\" Ake being the name of the principal quarter of Abeokuta, after the ancient capital of the Egbas.\n\nThe men are well known all over Spain and Portugal as hardy, honest and industrious, but for the most part somewhat unskilled, labourers; indeed the word Gallego has come to be almost a synonym in Madrid for a \"hewer of wood and drawer of water.\"\n\nThe word Isis is probably an academic rendering of Ouse or Isca, a common British river name, but there is no reason to suppose that it ever had much vogue except in poetry or in the immediate neighbourhood of Oxford.\n\nIn regard to the ancients' knowledge of lead compounds, we may state that the substance described by Dioscorides as, uoXv,3Saiva was undoubtedly litharge, that Pliny uses the word minium in its present sense of red lead, ana that white lead was well known to Geber in the 8th century.\n\nIn Gregory of Tours this word is still used vaguely, but the sense of it is gradually defined, and finally the name of Austria or Austrasia was given to the easternmost part of the Frankish kingdom.\n\nAt the time of Charlemagne, the word Austrasia underwent a change of meaning and became synonymous with Francia orientalis, and was applied to the Frankish dominions beyond the Rhine (Franconia).\n\nIt is popularly used of a relation between persons amounting to more than goodwill or friendship. By ethical writers the word has been used generally of distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic; some contrast it with \"passion\" as being free from the distinctively sensual element.\n\nIn this narrower sense the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental \"affections\" as in some sense a part of moral obligation.\n\nFew as were the years of work allotted to him, and few as are the printed pages covered by the record of his researches, his name is, and will remain, a household word among mathematicians.\n\nForchhammer was a democrat in the best sense of the word, and from 1871 to 1873 represented the progressive party of Schleswig-Holstein in the German Reichstag.\n\nThe second book among the minor prophets in the Bible is entitled The word of Yahweh that came to Joel the son of Pethuel, or, as the Septuagint, Latin, Syriac and other versions read, Bethuel.\n\nIn the early Roman empire the word was used to designate the companions of the emperor (comites principis) and so became a title of honour.\n\nThe Frankish kings of the Merovingian dynasty retained the Roman system of administration, and under them the word comes preserved its original meaning; the comes was a companion of the king, a royal servant of high rank.\n\nIn the Tableau Elementaire, published in 1795, Cuvier adopts Linnaeus's term in its earlier sense, but uses the French word \"Reptiles,\" already brought into use by Brisson, as the equivalent of Amphibia.\n\nHuxley, in the ninth edition of this Encyclopaedia, treated of Brongniart's Batrachia, under the designation Amphibia, but this use of the word has not been generally accepted.\n\nWe may compare the common use of the word ordo in profane writers, who refer, e.g., to the ordo senatorius, ordo equester, &c. It is true that the evidence of Tertullian does not carry us back farther than the close of the znd or opening of the 3rd century A.D.\n\nBut a little before Tertullian, Irenaeus, though he does not use the word ordo, anticipates in some measure Tertullian's abstract term, for he recognizes a magisterii locus, \" a place of magistracy \" or \" presidency \" in the church.\n\nThe keys, as he believed, were entrusted to the church as a whole, and from the church as a whole the \" ministers of the word and sacraments \" are to derive their institution and authority."
