Essential goals included: (1) Creation of 'Master Toolkits' of information that integrate diverse tools, rating systems, and incentive programs, customized for key audiences such as window manufacturers, design professionals, and utility programs. (2) Delivery of education and outreach programs to multiple audiences through conference presentations, publication of articles for builders and other industry professionals, and targeted dissemination of efficient window curricula to professionals and students. (3) Design and implementation of mechanismsmoreÂ Â» to encourage and track sales of more efficient products through the existing Window Products Database as an incentive for manufacturers to improve products and participate in programs such as NFRC and ENERGY STAR. (4) Development of utility incentive programs to promote more efficient residential and commercial windows. Partnership with regional and local entities on the development of programs and customized information to move the market toward the highest performing products. An overarching project goal was to ensure that different audiences adopt and use the developed information, design and promotion tools and thus increase the market penetration of energy efficient fenestration products. In particular, a crucial success criterion was to move gas and electric utilities to increase the promotion of energy efficient windows through demand side management programs as an important step toward increasing the market share of energy efficient windows.Â«Â less\n\nHighly Insulating Windows Volume Purchase Program Final Report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNone\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThis report documents the development, execution outcomes and lessons learned of the Highly Insulating Windows Volume Purchase (WVP) Program carried out over a three-year period from 2009 through 2012. The primary goals of the program were met: 1) reduce the incremental cost of highly insulating windows compared to ENERGY STAR windows; and 2) raise the public and potential buyersâ awareness of highly insulating windows and their benefits. A key outcome of the program is that the 2013 ENERGY STAR Most Efficient criteria for primary residential windows were adopted from the technical specifications set forth in the WVP program.\n\nUnderstanding Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nSpectral Analysis Tool 6.2 for Windows\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMorgan, Feiming; Sue, Miles; Peng, Ted; Tan, Harry; Liang, Robert; Kinman, Peter\n\n2006-01-01\n\nSpectral Analysis Tool 6.2 is the latest version of a computer program that assists in analysis of interference between radio signals of the types most commonly used in Earth/spacecraft radio communications. [An earlier version was reported in Software for Analyzing Earth/Spacecraft Radio Interference (NPO-20422), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 25, No. 4 (April 2001), page 52.] SAT 6.2 calculates signal spectra, bandwidths, and interference effects for several families of modulation schemes. Several types of filters can be modeled, and the program calculates and displays signal spectra after filtering by any of the modeled filters. The program accommodates two simultaneous signals: a desired signal and an interferer. The interference-to-signal power ratio can be calculated for the filtered desired and interfering signals. Bandwidth-occupancy and link-budget calculators are included for the user s convenience. SAT 6.2 has a new software structure and provides a new user interface that is both intuitive and convenient. SAT 6.2 incorporates multi-tasking, multi-threaded execution, virtual memory management, and a dynamic link library.

However, the narrow editing window of BE limits its utility. Here, we developed a new editing technology named as base editor for programming larger C to U (T) scope (BE-PLUS) by fusing 10 copies of GCN4 peptide to nCas9(D10A) for recruiting scFv-APOBEC-UGI-GB1 to the target sites. The new system achieves base editing with a broadened window, resulting in an increased genome-targeting scope. Interestingly, the new system yielded much fewer unwanted indels and non-C-to-T conversions. We also demonstrated its potential use in gene disruption across the whole genome through induction of stop codons (iSTOP). Taken together, the BE-PLUS system offers a new editing tool with increased editing window and enhanced fidelity.\n\nSelection Process for New Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nDesign Guidance for New Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nSelection Process for Replacement Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nDesign Guidance for Replacement Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nMeasurement Variability of Vertical Scanning Interferometry Tool Used for Orbiter Window Defect Assessment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPadula, Santo, II\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe ability to sufficiently measure orbiter window defects to allow for window recertification has been an ongoing challenge for the orbiter vehicle program. The recent Columbia accident has forced even tighter constraints on the criteria that must be met in order to recertify windows for flight. As a result, new techniques are being investigated to improve the reliability, accuracy and resolution of the defect detection process. The methodology devised in this work, which is based on the utilization of a vertical scanning interferometric (VSI) tool, shows great promise for meeting the ever increasing requirements for defect detection. This methodology has the potential of a 10-100 fold greater resolution of the true defect depth than can be obtained from the currently employed micrometer based methodology. An added benefit is that it also produces a digital elevation map of the defect, thereby providing information about the defect morphology which can be utilized to ascertain the type of debris that induced the damage. However, in order to successfully implement such a tool, a greater understanding of the resolution capability and measurement repeatability must be obtained. This work focused on assessing the variability of the VSI-based measurement methodology and revealed that the VSI measurement tool was more repeatable and more precise than the current micrometer based approach, even in situations where operator variation could affect the measurement. The analysis also showed that the VSI technique was relatively insensitive to the hardware and software settings employed, making the technique extremely robust and desirable\n\nMicrowave Workshop for Windows.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWhite, Colin\n\n1998-01-01\n\n\"Microwave Workshop for Windows\" consists of three programs that act as teaching aid and provide a circuit design utility within the field of microwave engineering.

The method can be used to find and describe structural features in the data. The method is described in two earlier papers. I assume that the reader has access to both of these papers, so I will not repeat material from them. The program described herein is written in BASIC and it runs on an IBM PC or PS/2 with the DOS 3.3 operating system. Although the program is slow and has limited memory space, it is adequate for experimenting with the method. Since it is written in BASIC, it is relatively easy to modify. The program and some related files are available on a 3-inch diskette. A listing of the program is also available. This user's manual explains the use of the program. First, it gives a brief tutorial, illustrating some of the program's features with a set of artificial data. Then, it describes the results displayed after the program does a Gaussian window, and it explains each of the items on the various menus.\n\nState Fact Sheets | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nFact Sheets & Publications | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nCondensation Resistance (CR) | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nLow Conductance Spacers | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nEnergy & Cost Savings | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nESDAPT - APT PROGRAMMING EDITOR AND INTERPRETER\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPremack, T.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nESDAPT is a graphical programming environment for developing APT (Automatically Programmed Tool) programs for controlling numerically controlled machine tools. ESDAPT has a graphical user interface that provides the user with an APT syntax sensitive text editor and windows for displaying geometry and tool paths. APT geometry statement can also be created using menus and screen picks. ESDAPT interprets APT geometry statements and displays the results in its view windows. Tool paths are generated by batching the APT source to an APT processor (COSMIC P-APT recommended). The tool paths are then displayed in the view windows. Hardcopy output of the view windows is in color PostScript format. ESDAPT is written in C-language, yacc, lex, and XView for use on Sun4 series computers running SunOS. ESDAPT requires 4Mb of disk space, 7Mb of RAM, and MIT's X Window System, Version 11 Release 4, or OpenWindows version 3 for execution. Program documentation in PostScript format and an executable for OpenWindows version 3 are provided on the distribution media. The standard distribution medium for ESDAPT is a .25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge (Sun QIC-24) in UNIX tar format. This program was developed in 1992.\n\nForensic Analysis of Windows Hosts Using UNIX-based Tools\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCory Altheide\n\n2004-07-19\n\nMany forensic examiners are introduced to UNIX-based forensic utilities when faced with investigating a UNIX-like operating system for the first time. They will use these utilities for this very specific task, because in many cases these tools are the only ones for the given job. For example, at the time of this writing, given a FreeBSD 5.x file system, the author's only choice is to use The Coroner's Toolkit running on FreeBSD 5.x. However, many of the same tools examiners use for the occasional UNIX-like system investigation are extremely capable when a Windows system is the target. Indeed, the LinuxmoreÂ Â» operating system itself can prove to be an extremely useful forensics platform with very little use of specialized forensics utilities at all.Â«Â less\n\nNational Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) | Efficient Windows\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nCollaborative Foundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring\n\nU-Factor (U-value) | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nWINDOWS: a program for the analysis of spectral data foil activation measurements\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStallmann, F.W.; Eastham, J.F.; Kam, F.B.K.\n\nThe computer program WINDOWS together with its subroutines is described for the analysis of neutron spectral data foil activation measurements.

In particular, a utility allowing the easy creation and update of slide presentations, XSlideManager, is explained in detail and examples of its application are shown. In addition to XSlideManager, other mini-utilities are discussed.

UNIX Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) socket programming libraries require many method calls to configure, operate, and destroy sockets. Most X Windows GUI programs use widget sets or toolkits to facilitate management of complex objects. The widget standards facilitate construction of toolkits and application programs. The X-Windows Socket Widget Class encapsulates UNIX TCP/IP socket-management tasks within the framework of an X Windows widget. Using the widget framework, X Windows GUI programs can treat one or more network socket instances in the same manner as that of other graphical widgets, making it easier to program sockets. Wrapping ISP socket programming libraries inside a widget framework enables a programmer to treat a network interface as though it were a GUI.\n\nX-Windows PVT Widget Class\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarry, Matthew R.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe X-Windows Process Validation Table (PVT) Widget Class ( Class is used here in the object-oriented-programming sense of the word) was devised to simplify the task of implementing network registration services for Information Sharing Protocol (ISP) graphical-user-interface (GUI) computer programs. Heretofore, ISP PVT programming tasks have required many method calls to identify, query, and interpret the connections and messages exchanged between a client and a PVT server. Normally, programmers have utilized direct access to UNIX socket libraries to implement the PVT protocol queries, necessitating the use of many lines of source code to perform frequent tasks. Now, the X-Windows PVT Widget Class encapsulates ISP client server network registration management tasks within the framework of an X Windows widget. Use of the widget framework enables an X Windows GUI program to interact with PVT services in an abstract way and in the same manner as that of other graphical widgets, making it easier to program PVT clients. Wrapping the PVT services inside the widget framework enables a programmer to treat a PVT server interface as though it were a GUI. Moreover, an alternate subclass could implement another service in a widget of the same type. This program was written by Matthew R. Barry of United Space Alliance for Johnson Space Center.

MSC-23582 Shuttle Data Center File- Processing Tool in Java A Java-language computer program has been written to facilitate mining of data in files in the Shuttle Data Center (SDC) archives. This program can be executed on a variety of workstations or via Web-browser programs. This program is partly similar to prior C-language programs used for the same purpose, while differing from those programs in that it exploits the platform-neutrality of Java in implementing several features that are important for analysis of large sets of time-series data\n\n3D TRUMP - A GBI launch window tool\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKarels, Steven N.; Hancock, John; Matchett, Gary\n\n3D TRUMP is a novel GPS and communicatons-link software analysis tool developed for the SDIO's Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) program. 3D TRUMP uses a computationally efficient analysis tool which provides key GPS-based performance measures for an entire GBI mission's reentry vehicle and interceptor trajectories. Algorithms and sample outputs are presented.\n\nThe X-windows interactive navigation data editor\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRinker, G. C.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nA new computer program called the X-Windows Interactive Data Editor (XIDE) was developed and demonstrated as a prototype application for editing radio metric data in the orbit-determination process. The program runs on a variety of workstations and employs pull-down menus and graphical displays, which allow users to easily inspect and edit radio metric data in the orbit data files received from the Deep Space Network (DSN). The XIDE program is based on the Open Software Foundation OSF/Motif Graphical User Interface (GUI) and has proven to be an efficient tool for editing radio metric data in the navigation operations environment. It was adopted by the Magellan Navigation Team as their primary data-editing tool. Because the software was designed from the beginning to be portable, the prototype was successfully moved to new workstation environments. It was also itegrated into the design of the next-generation software tool for DSN multimission navigation interactive launch support.\n\nVisual DMDX: A web-based authoring tool for DMDX, a Windows display program with millisecond accuracy.\n\nPubMed\n\nGaraizar, Pablo; Reips, Ulf-Dietrich\n\n2015-09-01\n\nDMDX is a software package for the experimental control and timing of stimulus display for Microsoft Windows systems. DMDX is reliable, flexible, millisecond accurate, and can be downloaded free of charge; therefore it has become very popular among experimental researchers. However, setting up a DMDX-based experiment is burdensome because of its command-based interface. Further, DMDX relies on RTF files in which parts of the stimuli, design, and procedure of an experiment are defined in a complicated (DMASTR-compatible) syntax. Other experiment software, such as E-Prime, Psychopy, and WEXTOR, became successful as a result of integrated visual authoring tools. Such an intuitive interface was lacking for DMDX. We therefore created and present here Visual DMDX (http://visualdmdx.com/), a HTML5-based web interface to set up experiments and export them to DMDX item files format in RTF. Visual DMDX offers most of the features available from the rich DMDX/DMASTR syntax, and it is a useful tool to support researchers who are new to DMDX. Both old and modern versions of DMDX syntax are supported. Further, with Visual DMDX, we go beyond DMDX by having added export to JSON (a versatile web format), easy backup, and a preview option for experiments. In two examples, one experiment each on lexical decision making and affective priming, we explain in a step-by-step fashion how to create experiments using Visual DMDX. We release Visual DMDX under an open-source license to foster collaboration in its continuous improvement.\n\nAn Introduction to X Window Application Development\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1992-03-23\n\nAcquisition and Policy Evaluation program using Cognitive Feed- back ( ESKAPE /CF) from the SunView windowing system to X Window.

H.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nA computer program is presented which is designed to determine the daily release window for sky target experiments. Factors considered in the program include: (1) target illumination by the sun at release time and during the tracking period; (2) look angle elevation above local horizon from each tracking station to the target; (3) solar depression angle from the local horizon of each tracking station during the experimental period after target release; (4) lunar depression angle from the local horizon of each tracking station during the experimental period after target release; and (5) total sky background brightness as seen from each tracking station while viewing the target. Program output is produced in both graphic and data form. Output data can be plotted for a single calendar month or year. The numerical values used to generate the plots are furnished to permit a more detailed review of the computed daily release windows.\n\nX-Windows Information Sharing Protocol Widget Class\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarry, Matthew R.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe X-Windows Information Sharing Protocol (ISP) Widget Class (\"Class\") is used here in the object-oriented-programming sense of the word) was devised to simplify the task of implementing ISP graphical-user-interface (GUI) computer programs. ISP programming tasks require many method calls to identify, query, and interpret the connections and messages exchanged between a client and an ISP server. Most X-Windows GUI programs use widget sets or toolkits to facilitate management of complex objects. The widget standards facilitate construction of toolkits and application programs. The X-Windows Information Sharing Protocol (ISP) Widget Class encapsulates the client side of the ISP programming libraries within the framework of an X-Windows widget. Using the widget framework, X-Windows GUI programs can interact with ISP services in an abstract way and in the same manner as that of other graphical widgets, making it easier to write ISP GUI client programs. Wrapping ISP client services inside a widget framework enables a programmer to treat an ISP server interface as though it were a GUI. Moreover, an alternate subclass could implement another communication protocol in the same sort of widget.\n\nA survey of parallel programming tools\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCheng, Doreen Y.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThis survey examines 39 parallel programming tools. Focus is placed on those tool capabilites needed for parallel scientific programming rather than for general computer science. The tools are classified with current and future needs of Numerical Aerodynamic Simulator (NAS) in mind: existing and anticipated NAS supercomputers and workstations; operating systems; programming languages; and applications. They are divided into four categories: suggested acquisitions, tools already brought in; tools worth tracking; and tools eliminated from further consideration at this time.\n\nCreating a Parallel Version of VisIt for Microsoft Windows\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWhitlock, B J; Biagas, K S; Rawson, P L\n\n2011-12-07\n\nVisIt is a popular, free interactive parallel visualization and analysis tool for scientific data. Users can quickly generate visualizations from their data, animate them through time, manipulate them, and save the resulting images or movies for presentations. VisIt was designed from the ground up to work on many scales of computers from modest desktops up to massively parallel clusters. VisIt is comprised of a set of cooperating programs. All programs can be run locally or in client/server mode in which some run locally and some run remotely on compute clusters. The VisIt program most able to harness today's computing powermoreÂ Â» is the VisIt compute engine. The compute engine is responsible for reading simulation data from disk, processing it, and sending results or images back to the VisIt viewer program. In a parallel environment, the compute engine runs several processes, coordinating using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. Each MPI process reads some subset of the scientific data and filters the data in various ways to create useful visualizations. By using MPI, VisIt has been able to scale well into the thousands of processors on large computers such as dawn and graph at LLNL. The advent of multicore CPU's has made parallelism the 'new' way to achieve increasing performance. With today's computers having at least 2 cores and in many cases up to 8 and beyond, it is more important than ever to deploy parallel software that can use that computing power not only on clusters but also on the desktop. We have created a parallel version of VisIt for Windows that uses Microsoft's MPI implementation (MSMPI) to process data in parallel on the Windows desktop as well as on a Windows HPC cluster running Microsoft Windows Server 2008. Initial desktop parallel support for Windows was deployed in VisIt 2.4.0. Windows HPC cluster support has been completed and will appear in the VisIt 2.5.0 release. We plan to continue supporting parallel VisIt on Windows so our\n\nProgram Management Tool\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGawadiak, Yuri; Wong, Alan; Maluf, David; Bell, David; Gurram, Mohana; Tran, Khai Peter; Hsu, Jennifer; Yagi, Kenji; Patel, Hemil\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Program Management Tool (PMT) is a comprehensive, Web-enabled business intelligence software tool for assisting program and project managers within NASA enterprises in gathering, comprehending, and disseminating information on the progress of their programs and projects. The PMT provides planning and management support for implementing NASA programmatic and project management processes and requirements. It provides an online environment for program and line management to develop, communicate, and manage their programs, projects, and tasks in a comprehensive tool suite. The information managed by use of the PMT can include monthly reports as well as data on goals, deliverables, milestones, business processes, personnel, task plans, monthly reports, and budgetary allocations. The PMT provides an intuitive and enhanced Web interface to automate the tedious process of gathering and sharing monthly progress reports, task plans, financial data, and other information on project resources based on technical, schedule, budget, and management criteria and merits. The PMT is consistent with the latest Web standards and software practices, including the use of Extensible Markup Language (XML) for exchanging data and the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) protocol for collaborative management of documents. The PMT provides graphical displays of resource allocations in the form of bar and pie charts using Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Application (VBA) libraries. The PMT has an extensible architecture that enables integration of PMT with other strategic-information software systems, including, for example, the Erasmus reporting system, now part of the NASA Integrated Enterprise Management Program (IEMP) tool suite, at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The PMT data architecture provides automated and extensive software interfaces and reports to various strategic information systems to eliminate duplicative human entries and minimize data integrity\n\nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter Uplink Analysis Tool\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKhanampompan, Teerapat; Gladden, Roy; Fisher, Forest; Hwang, Pauline\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis software analyzes Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) orbital geometry with respect to Mars Exploration Rover (MER) contact windows, and is the first tool of its kind designed specifically to support MRO-MER interface coordination. Prior to this automated tool, this analysis was done manually with Excel and the UNIX command line. In total, the process would take approximately 30 minutes for each analysis. The current automated analysis takes less than 30 seconds. This tool resides on the flight machine and uses a PHP interface that does the entire analysis of the input files and takes into account one-way light time from another input file. Input flies are copied over to the proper directories and are dynamically read into the tool s interface. The user can then choose the corresponding input files based on the time frame desired for analysis. After submission of the Web form, the tool merges the two files into a single, time-ordered listing of events for both spacecraft. The times are converted to the same reference time (Earth Transmit Time) by reading in a light time file and performing the calculations necessary to shift the time formats. The program also has the ability to vary the size of the keep-out window on the main page of the analysis tool by inputting a custom time for padding each MRO event time. The parameters on the form are read in and passed to the second page for analysis. Everything is fully coded in PHP and can be accessed by anyone with access to the machine via Web page. This uplink tool will continue to be used for the duration of the MER mission's needs for X-band uplinks. Future missions also can use the tools to check overflight times as well as potential site observation times. Adaptation of the input files to the proper format, and the window keep-out times, would allow for other analyses. Any operations task that uses the idea of keep-out windows will have a use for this program.\n\nEnvironmental Tools and Radiological Assessment\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThis presentation details two tools (SADA and FRAMES) available for use in environmental assessments of chemicals that can also be used for radiological assessments of the environment.

L.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nGeological studies analyze spectral data in order to gain information on surface materials. RATIO_TOOL is an interactive program for viewing and analyzing large multispectral image data sets that have been created by an imaging spectrometer. While the standard approach to classification of multispectral data is to match the spectrum for each input pixel against a library of known mineral spectra, RATIO_TOOL uses ratios of spectral bands in order to spot significant areas of interest within a multispectral image. Each image band can be viewed iteratively, or a selected image band of the data set can be requested and displayed. When the image ratios are computed, the result is displayed as a gray scale image. At this point a histogram option helps in viewing the distribution of values. A thresholding option can then be used to segment the ratio image result into two to four classes. The segmented image is then color coded to indicate threshold classes and displayed alongside the gray scale image. RATIO_TOOL is written in C language for Sun series computers running SunOS 4.0 and later. It requires the XView toolkit and the OpenWindows window manager (version 2.0 or 3.0). The XView toolkit is distributed with Open Windows. A color monitor is also required. The standard distribution medium for RATIO_TOOL is a .25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge in UNIX tar format. An electronic copy of the documentation is included on the program media. RATIO_TOOL was developed in 1992 and is a copyrighted work with all copyright vested in NASA. Sun, SunOS, and OpenWindows are trademarks of Sun Microsystems, Inc.

Consequently, the task of reproducing and predicting the hydrological process in watersheds is hard and unavoidable for reducing the risks of damage and loss. Thus, it is necessary to develop an efficient and cost-effective hydrological tool in China as many areas should be modeled. Currently, developed hydrological tools such as Mike SHE and ArcSWAT (soil and water assessment tool based on ArcGIS) show significant power in improving the precision of hydrological modeling in China by considering spatial variability both in land cover and in soil type. However, adopting developed commercial tools in such a large developing country comes at a high cost. Commercial modeling tools usually contain large numbers of formulas, complicated data formats, and many preprocessing or postprocessing steps that may make it difficult for the user to carry out simulation, thus lowering the efficiency of the modeling process. Besides, commercial hydrological models usually cannot be modified or improved to be suitable for some special hydrological conditions in China. Some other hydrological models are open source, but integrated into commercial GIS systems. Therefore, by integrating hydrological simulation code EasyDHM, a hydrological simulation tool named MWEasyDHM was developed based on open-source MapWindow GIS, the purpose of which is to establish the first open-source GIS-based distributed hydrological model tool in China by integrating modules of preprocessing, model computation, parameter estimation, result display, and analysis. MWEasyDHM provides users with a friendly manipulating MapWindow GIS interface, selectable multifunctional hydrological processing modules, and, more importantly, an efficient and cost-effective hydrological simulation tool. The general construction of MWEasyDHM consists of four major parts: (1) a general GIS module for hydrological analysis, (2) a\n\nGaussian windows: A tool for exploring multivariate data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJaeckel, Louis A.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nPresented here is a method for interactively exploring a large set of quantitative multivariate data, in order to estimate the shape of the underlying density function. It is assumed that the density function is more or less smooth, but no other specific assumptions are made concerning its structure. The local structure of the data in a given region may be examined by viewing the data through a Gaussian window, whose location and shape are chosen by the user. A Gaussian window is defined by giving each data point a weight based on a multivariate Gaussian function. The weighted sample mean and sample covariance matrix are then computed, using the weights attached to the data points. These quantities are used to compute an estimate of the shape of the density function in the window region. The local structure of the data is described by a method similar to the method of principal components. By taking many such local views of the data, we can form an idea of the structure of the data set. The method is applicable in any number of dimensions. The method can be used to find and describe simple structural features such as peaks, valleys, and saddle points in the density function, and also extended structures in higher dimensions. With some practice, we can apply our geometrical intuition to these structural features in any number of dimensions, so that we can think about and describe the structure of the data. Since the computations involved are relatively simple, the method can easily be implemented on a small computer.\n\nCarbon Nanotube Reinforced Flexible Windows for Blast Protection\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2010-07-01\n\ntransparent plastic composite for use as a material for window or as a laminate layer in the blast-resistant glazed window.

Window communities presently include Broken Arrow, OK; Muncie, IN; Moscow, ID; Nogales, AZ; Tuskegee, AL; Marquette, MI; Altamont, KS; Washington, D.C.; and other emerging sites. Window uses themes of human space flight and the space sciences as interdisciplinary means to inspire entire communities. Practicing scientists and engineers engaged in these disciplines are invited to volunteer to become a part of these communities for a week, each visitor reaching roughly 2000 K-12 students through individual classroom visits and Family Science Night events during an intense Window on the Universe Week. In the same Window Week, Challenger Center scientists and educators present a workshop for local educators to provide training in the use of a K-12 educational module built around a particular space science and exploration theme. Window communities follow a 3-year development: Year 1, join the network, experience Window Week presented by Challenger Center and visiting researchers; Year 2, same as Year 1 plus workshop on partnering with local organizations to develop sources of visiting researchers and to enhance connections with local resources; Year 3 and subsequent, the community stages its own Window Week, with Challenger Center providing new education modules and training workshops for \"master educators\" from the Window community, after which the master educators return home to conduct training workshops of their own.

The recent rate at which these diseases have increased suggests that environmental and behavioral influences, rather than genetic causes, are fuelling the present epidemic. In this context, the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis has highlighted the link between the periconceptual, fetal and early infant phases of life and the subsequent development of adult obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Although the mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated, this programming was generally considered an irreversible change in developmental trajectory. Recent work in animal models suggests that developmental programming of metabolic disorders is potentially reversible by nutritional or targeted therapeutic interventions during the period of developmental plasticity. This review will discuss critical windows of developmental plasticity and possible avenues to ameliorate the development of postnatal metabolic disorders following an adverse early life environment.

This paper investigates the performance of multiprogrammed, reduced instruction set computers (RISCs) as a function of window management strategy. Using an analytic model that reflects context switch and procedure call overheads, we analyze the performance of simple, linearly self-recursive programs. For more complex programs, we present the results of a simulation study. These studies show that a simple strategy that saves all windows prior to a context switch, but restores only a single window following a context switch, performs near optimally.\n\nINDOOR AIR QUALITY AND INHALATION EXPOSURE - SIMULATION TOOL KIT\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nA Microsoft Windows-based indoor air quality (IAQ) simulation software package is presented.

Studies in rats exposed in utero to di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) have strongly supported the TDS concept, but so far no direct evidence has been produced that links dysgenesis per se to somatic cell dysfunction, in particular to androgen production/action during the 'masculinization programming window' (MPW; e15.5-e18.5). Normal reproductive tract development and anogenital distance (AGD) are programmed within the MPW, and TDS disorders arise because of deficiencies in this programming. However, DBP-induced focal testicular dysgenesis (Leydig cell aggregation, ectopic Sertoli cells, malformed seminiferous cords) is not evident until after the MPW. Therefore, we used AGD as a read-out of androgen exposure in the MPW, and investigated if this measure was related to objectively quantified dysgenesis (Leydig cell aggregation) at e21.5 in male fetuses exposed to vehicle, DBP (500 or 750 mg/kg/day) or the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex; alone or plus DBP-500) from e15.5-e18.5 (MPW), e13.5-e20.5 or e19.5-e20.5 (late window). Dysgenesis was found only in animals exposed to DBP during the MPW, and was negatively correlated (RÂ²â=â-0.5) with AGD at e21.5 and at postnatal day 8, irrespective of treatment period. Dysgenesis was also negatively correlated (RÂ² =â-0.5) with intratesticular testosterone (ITT) at e21.5, but only when treatments in short windows (MPW, late window) were excluded; the same was true for correlation between AGD and ITT. We conclude that AGD, reflecting Leydig cell function solely within the MPW, is strongly related to focal dysgenesis. Our results point to this occurring because of a common early mechanism, targeted by DBP that determines both dysgenesis and early (during the MPW) fetal Leydig cell dysfunction.

It has developed the software tools Derek for Windows, Meteor, and Vitic to facilitate such sharing. Derek for Windows and Meteor are knowledge-based expert systems that predict the toxicity and metabolism of a chemical, respectively. Vitic is a chemically intelligent toxicity database. An overview of each software system is provided along with examples of the sharing of data and knowledge in the context of their development. These examples include illustrations of (1) the use of data entry and editing tools for the sharing of data and knowledge within organizations; (2) the use of proprietary data to develop nonconfidential knowledge that can be shared between organizations; (3) the use of shared expert knowledge to refine predictions; (4) the sharing of proprietary data between organizations through the formation of data-sharing groups; and (5) the use of proprietary data to validate predictions. Sharing of chemical toxicity and metabolism data and knowledge in this way offers a number of benefits including the possibilities of faster scientific progress and reductions in the use of animals in testing. Maximizing the accessibility of data also becomes increasingly crucial as in silico systems move toward the prediction of more complex phenomena for which limited data are available.\n\nA Numerical Study of the Thermal Characteristics of an Air Cavity Formed by Window Sashes in a Double Window\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKang, Jae-sik; Oh, Eun-Joo; Bae, Min-Jung; Song, Doo-Sam\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGiven that the Korean government is implementing what has been termed the energy standards and labelling program for windows, window companies will be required to assign window ratings based on the experimental results of their product. Because this has added to the cost and time required for laboratory tests by window companies, the simulation system for the thermal performance of windows has been prepared to compensate for time and cost burdens. In Korea, a simulator is usually used to calculate the thermal performance of a window through WINDOW/THERM, complying with ISO 15099. For a single window, the simulation results are similar to experimental results. A double window is also calculated using the same method, but the calculation results for this type of window are unreliable. ISO 15099 should not recommend the calculation of the thermal properties of an air cavity between window sashes in a double window. This causes a difference between simulation and experimental results pertaining to the thermal performance of a double window. In this paper, the thermal properties of air cavities between window sashes in a double window are analyzed through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with the results compared to calculation results certified by ISO 15099. The surface temperature of the air cavity analyzed by CFD is compared to the experimental temperatures. These results show that an appropriate calculation method for an air cavity between window sashes in a double window should be established for reliable thermal performance results for a double window.\n\nMind the Gap: Summary of Window Residential Retrofit Solutions\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPetersen, Joseph M.; Cort, Katherine A.; Widder, Sarah H.\n\nImproving the insulation, solar heat gain, and infiltration characteristics of windows in a home has the potential to significantly improve the overall thermal performance by reducing heat transfer through the window and also by decreasing infiltration of outdoor air into the home. As approximately 43% of existing homes still have single-pane clear windows (~50 million houses) and millions of other homes have only double-pane clear windows (Cort 2013), improving window performance also presents a significant opportunity for energy savings in the residential sector. Today, various energy-saving window retrofit opportunities are available to homeowners, ranging from window coverings and storm panelsmoreÂ Â» to highly-insulating triple-pane R-5 window replacements. Many of these technologies have been evaluated in the field, in the âLab Homesâ at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and through modeling to prove their cost-effectiveness and performance in different climate regions. Recently, the Pacific Northwestâs Regional Technical Forum approved a utility measure for low- emissivity storm windows based on such data. This action represents a watershed moment for increasing the variety and prevalence of fenestration options in utility programs, especially for the low-income demographic. This paper will review various window retrofit options, the most recent field test and modeling data regarding their performance and cost-effectiveness, and discuss future rating efforts. This information is useful for utilities and energy-efficiency program managers to help effectively implement incentive measures for these technologies.Â«Â less\n\n14.

The key to virtual globes is the use of satellite imagery to provide a highly accurate view of the earth's surface. However, because the images are not updated regularly, variations in climate and vegetation over time can not be easily seen. In order to enhance the view of the earth and observe these changes by region and over time we are working to add near real time \"windows\" into the real world from a virtual globe. For the past 4 years we have been installing web cameras in areas of the world that will provide long term monitoring of global changes. By archiving hourly images from arctic, temperate and tropical regions we are creating a visual data set that is already beginning to tell the story of climate variability. The cameras are currently installed in 10 elementary schools in 3 countries and show the student's view out each window. The Windows Around the World program (http://www.WindowsAroundTheWorld.org) uses the images from these cameras to help students gain a better understanding of earth process and variability in climate and vegetation between different regions and over time. Previously we have used standard web based technologies such as DHTML and AJAX to provide near real-time access to these images and also provide enhanced functionality such as dynamic time lapse movies that allow users to see changes over months, days or hours up to the current hour (http://www.windowsaroundtheworld.org/north_america.aspx). We have integrated the camera images from Windows Around the World into Google Earth. Through network links and models we are creating a way for students to \"fly\" to another school in the program and see what the current view is out the window.

Aiming to bridge the gap between best practices literature and local knowledge and expertise, the Ontario Public Health Association, through the Toward Evidence-Informed Practice initiative, developed a set of resources to strengthen evidence-informed decision making in chronic disease prevention programs. A Program Assessment Tool, described in this article, emphasizes better processes by incorporating review criteria into the program planning and implementation process. In a companion paper, âStrengthening Chronic Disease Prevention Programming: The Toward Evidence-Informed Practice (TEIP) Program Evidence Tool,â we describe another tool, which emphasizes better evidence by providing guidelines and worksheets to identify, synthesize, and incorporate evidence from a range of sources (eg, peer-reviewed literature, gray literature, local expertise) to strengthen local programs. The Program Assessment Tool uses 19 criteria derived from literature on best and promising practices to assess and strengthen program planning and implementation. We describe the benefits, strengths, and challenges in implementing the tool in 22 community-based chronic disease prevention projects in Ontario, Canada. The Program Assessment Tool helps put best processes into operation to complement adoption and adaptation of evidence-informed practices for chronic disease prevention.

As one of the Stanford suite of evidence-based CDSME programs, the chronic disease self-management program (CDSMP) has been disseminated in diverse populations and settings. The objective of this paper is to introduce a practical, universally applicable tool to assist program administrators and decision makers plan implementation efforts and make the case for continued program delivery. This tool was developed utilizing data from a recent National Study of CDSMP to estimate national savings associated with program participation. Potential annual healthcare savings per CDSMP participant were calculated based on averted emergency room visits and hospitalizations. While national data can be utilized to estimate cost savings, the tool has built-in features allowing users to tailor calculations based on their site-specific data. Building upon the National Study of CDSMP's documented potential savings of $3.3 billion in healthcare costs by reaching 5% of adults with one or more chronic conditions, two heuristic case examples were also explored based on different population projections. The case examples show how a small county and large metropolitan city were not only able to estimate healthcare savings ($38,803 for the small county; $732,290 for the large metropolitan city) for their existing participant populations but also to project significant healthcare savings if they plan to reach higher proportions of middle-aged and older adults. Having a tool to demonstrate the monetary value of CDSMP can contribute to the ongoing dissemination and sustainability of such community-based interventions. Next steps will be creating a user-friendly, internet-based version of Healthcare Cost Savings Estimator Tool: CDSMP, followed by broadening the tool to consider cost savings for other evidence-based programs.\n\nBispectral analysis: comparison of two windowing functions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSilvagni, D.; Djerroud, C.; RÃ©veillÃ©, T.; Gravier, E.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAmongst all the normalized forms of bispectrum, the bicoherence is shown to be a very useful diagnostic tool in experimental studies of nonlinear wave interactions in plasma, as it measures the fraction of wave power due to the quadratic wave coupling in a self-excited fluctuation spectrum [1, 2]. In order to avoid spectral leakage, the application of a windowing function is needed during the bicoherence computation. Spectral leakage from statistically dependent components are of crucial importance in the discrimination between coupled and uncoupled modes, as they will introduce in the bicoherence spectrum phase-coupled modes which in reality do not exist. Therefore, the windowing function plays a key role in the bicoherence estimation. In this paper, two windowing methods are compared: the multiplication of the initial signal by the Hanning function and the subtraction of the straight line which links the two extremities of the signal. The influence of these two windowing methods on both the power spectrum and the bicoherence spectrum is showed. Although both methods give precise results, the Hanning function appears to be the more suitable window.\n\nAlgorithmic Bricks: A Tangible Robot Programming Tool for Elementary School Students\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKwon, D.-Y.; Kim, H.-S.; Shim, J.-K.; Lee, W.-G.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTangible programming tools enable children to easily learn the programming process, previously considered to be difficult for them.

In this work, immune clone algorithm is first introduced into the spectrum analysis field as a new optimization strategy, covering the shortage of the relative traditional methods. Based on the working principle of the human immune system, the performance of the quantitative model is regarded as antigen, and a special vector corresponding to the above mentioned antigen is regarded as antibody. The antibody contains a pre-processing method optimization region which is created by 11 decimal digits, and a spectrum variable optimization region which is formed by some moving windows with changeable width and position. A set of original antibodies are created by modeling with this algorithm. After calculating the affinity of these antibodies, those with high affinity will be selected to clone. The regulation for cloning is that the higher the affinity, the more copies will be. In the next step, another import operation named hyper-mutation is applied to the antibodies after cloning. Moreover, the regulation for hyper-mutation is that the lower the affinity, the more possibility will be. Several antibodies with high affinity will be created on the basis of these steps. Groups of simulated dataset, gasoline near-infrared spectra dataset, and soil near-infrared spectra dataset are employed to verify and illustrate the performance of SA-MWM-ICA. Analysis results show that the performance of the quantitative models adopted by SA-MWM-ICA are better especially for structures with relatively complex spectra than traditional models such as partial least squares (PLS), moving window PLS (MWPLS), genetic algorithm PLS (GAPLS), and pretreatment method classification and adjustable parameter changeable\n\nExperimental and Numerical Examination of the Thermal Transmittance of High Performance Window Frames\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGustavsen Ph.D., Arild; Goudey, Howdy; Kohler, Christian\n\n2010-06-17\n\nWhile window frames typically represent 20-30percent of the overall window area, their impact on the total window heat transfer rates may be much larger. This effect is even greater in low-conductance (highly insulating) windows which incorporate very low conductance glazings. Developing low-conductance window frames requires accurate simulation tools for product research and development. The Passivhaus Institute in Germany states that windows (glazing and frames, combined) should have U-values not exceeding 0.80 W/(m??K). This has created a niche market for highly insulating frames, with frame U-values typically around 0.7-1.0 W/(m2 cdot K). The U-values reported are often based on numerical simulationsmoreÂ Â» according to international simulation standards. It is prudent to check the accuracy of these calculation standards, especially for high performance products before more manufacturers begin to use them to improve other product offerings. In this paper the thermal transmittance of five highly insulating window frames (three wooden frames, one aluminum frame and one PVC frame), found from numerical simulations and experiments, are compared. Hot box calorimeter results are compared with numerical simulations according to ISO 10077-2 and ISO 15099. In addition CFD simulations have been carried out, in order to use the most accurate tool available to investigate the convection and radiation effects inside the frame cavities. Our results show that available tools commonly used to evaluate window performance, based on ISO standards, give good overall agreement, but specific areas need improvement.Â«Â less\n\nStrengthening Chronic Disease Prevention Programming: The Toward Evidence-Informed Practice (TEIP) Program Evidence Tool\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlbert, Dayna; Fortin, Rebecca; Herrera, Christine; Hanning, Rhona; Lessio, Anne; Rush, Brian\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn public health and chronic disease prevention there is increasing priority for effective use of evidence in practice. In Ontario, Canada, despite various models being advanced, public health practitioners are seeking ways to identify and apply evidence in their work in practical and meaningful ways. In a companion article, âStrengthening Chronic Disease Prevention Programming: The Toward Evidence-Informed Practice (TEIP) Program Assessment Tool,â we describe use of a tool to assess and strengthen program planning and implementation processes using 19 criteria derived from best and promising practices literature. In this article, we describe use of a complementary Program Evidence Tool to identify, synthesize, and apply a range of evidence sources to strengthen the content of chronic disease prevention programming. The Program Evidence Tool adapts tools of evidence-based medicine to the unique contexts of community-based health promotion and chronic disease prevention. Knowledge management tools and a guided dialogue process known as an Evidence Forum enable community stakeholders to make appropriate use of evidence in diverse social, political, and structural contexts. Practical guidelines and worksheets direct users through 5 steps: 1) define an evidence question, 2) develop a search strategy, 3) collect and synthesize evidence, 4) interpret and adapt evidence, and 5) implement and evaluate. We describe the Program Evidence Toolâs benefits, strengths, challenges, and what was learned from its application in 4 Ontario public health departments. The Program Evidence Tool contributes to the development and understanding of the complex use of evidence in community-based chronic disease prevention.

Two of these programs are discussed and contrasted in the dimensions of length, level of science content, pedagogical approach, degree of self- vs. parent-selected participants, and amount of communitybuilding content. Two different evaluation tools were used. For one program, a modified version of the University of Pittsburgh's undergraduate engineering attitude assessment survey was used. Program participants' responses were compared to those from a fifth grade, mixed-sex science class. The only gender difference found was in the area of parental encouragement. The girls in the special class were more encouraged to participate in SMET areas. For the second program, a new age-appropriate tool developed specifically for these types of programs was used, and the tool itself was evaluated. The results indicate that the new tool has construct validity. On the basis of these preliminary results, a long-term plan for the continued development of the assessment tool is outlined.\n\nWindows to Art Excitement.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLaird, Shirley; Crumpecker, Cheryl\n\n2003-01-01\n\nDescribes an art project that aimed to bring more attention to an art program.

E.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe FORTRAN Programming Tools (FPT) are a series of tools used to support the development and maintenance of FORTRAN 77 source codes. Included are a debugging aid, a CPU time monitoring program, source code maintenance aids, print utilities, and a library of useful, well-documented programs. These tools assist in reducing development time and encouraging high quality programming. Although intended primarily for FORTRAN programmers, some of the tools can be used on data files and other programming languages. BUGOUT is a series of FPT programs that have proven very useful in debugging a particular kind of error and in optimizing CPU-intensive codes. The particular type of error is the illegal addressing of data or code as a result of subtle FORTRAN errors that are not caught by the compiler or at run time. A TRACE option also allows the programmer to verify the execution path of a program. The TIME option assists the programmer in identifying the CPU-intensive routines in a program to aid in optimization studies. Program coding, maintenance, and print aids available in FPT include: routines for building standard format subprogram stubs; cleaning up common blocks and NAMELISTs; removing all characters after column 72; displaying two files side by side on a VT-100 terminal; creating a neat listing of a FORTRAN source code including a Table of Contents, an Index, and Page Headings; converting files between VMS internal format and standard carriage control format; changing text strings in a file without using EDT; and replacing tab characters with spaces. The library of useful, documented programs includes the following: time and date routines; a string categorization routine; routines for converting between decimal, hex, and octal; routines to delay process execution for a specified time; a Gaussian elimination routine for solving a set of simultaneous linear equations; a curve fitting routine for least squares fit to polynomial, exponential, and sinusoidal forms (with\n\nPCDAQ, A Windows Based DAQ System\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHogan, Gary\n\n1998-10-01\n\nPCDAQ is a Windows NT based general DAQ/Analysis/Monte Carlo shell developed as part of the Proton Radiography project at LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory).

Not only is laboratory testing expensive, but each window manufacturer typically offers hundreds of individual products, each of which has different thermal performance properties. With over a thousand window manufacturers nationally, a testing-based rating system would be prohibitively expensive to the industry and to consumers. Beginning in the early 1990s, simulation software began to be used as part of a national program for rating window U-values. The rating program has since been expanded to include Solar Hear Gain Coefficients and is now being extended to annualmoreÂ Â» energy performance. This paper describes four software packages available to the public from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). These software packages are used to evaluate window thermal performance: RESFEN (for evaluating annual energy costs), WINDOW (for calculating a product`s thermal performance properties), THERM (a preprocessor for WINDOW that determines two-dimensional heat-transfer effects), and Optics (a preprocessor for WINDOW`s glass database). Software not only offers a less expensive means than testing to evaluate window performance, it can also be used during the design process to help manufacturers produce windows that will meet target specifications. In addition, software can show small improvements in window performance that might not be detected in actual testing because of large uncertainties in test procedures.Â«Â less\n\nManufacturing and metrology for IR conformal windows and domes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFerralli, Ian; Blalock, Todd; Brunelle, Matt; Lynch, Timothy; Myer, Brian; Medicus, Kate\n\n2017-05-01\n\nFreeform and conformal optics have the potential to dramatically improve optical systems by enabling systems with fewer optical components, reduced aberrations, and improved aerodynamic performance. These optical components differ from standard components in their surface shape, typically a non-symmetric equation based definition, and material properties. Traditional grinding and polishing tools are unable to handle these freeform shapes. Additionally, standard metrology tools cannot measure these surfaces. Desired substrates are typically hard ceramics, including poly-crystalline alumina or aluminum oxynitride. Notwithstanding the challenges that the hardness provides to manufacturing, these crystalline materials can be highly susceptible to grain decoration creating unacceptable scatter in optical systems. In this presentation, we will show progress towards addressing the unique challenges of manufacturing conformal windows and domes. Particular attention is given to our robotic polishing platform. This platform is based on an industrial robot adapted to accept a wide range of tooling and parts. The robot's flexibility has provided us an opportunity to address the unique challenges of conformal windows. Slurries and polishing active layers can easily be changed to adapt to varying materials and address grain decoration. We have the flexibility to change tool size and shape to address the varying sizes and shapes of conformal optics. In addition, the robotic platform can be a base for a deflectometry-based metrology tool to measure surface form error. This system, whose precision is independent of the robot's positioning accuracy, will allow us to measure optics in-situ saving time and reducing part risk. In conclusion, we will show examples of the conformal windows manufactured using our developed processes.\n\nICE: An Automated Tool for Teaching Advanced C Programming\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGonzalez, Ruben\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThere are many difficulties with learning and teaching programming that can be alleviated with the use of software tools.

For decades, computer science educators have looked at innovative approaches by creating pedagogical software tools that attempt to facilitate both the teaching of and the learning of programming. This dissertation investigates the motivations for the integration of pedagogical tools in introductory programming courses and the characteristics that are perceived to contribute to the effectiveness of these tools. The study employs three research stages that examine the tool characteristics and their use. The first stage surveys teachers who use pedagogical tools in an introductory programming course. The second interviews teachers to explore the survey results in more detail and to add greater depth into the choice and use of pedagogical tools in the introductory programming class. The third interviews tool developers to provide an explanatory insight of the tool and the motivation for its creation. The results indicate that the pedagogical tools perceived to be effective share common characteristics: They provide an environment that is manageable, flexible and visual; they provide for active engagement in learning activities and support programming in small pieces; they allow for an easy transition to subsequent courses and more robust environments; they provide technical support and resource materials. The results of this study also indicate that recommendations from other computer science educators have a strong impact on a teacher's initial tool choice for an introductory programming course. This study informs present and future tool developers of the characteristics that the teachers perceive to contribute to the effectiveness of a pedagogical tool and how to present their tools to encourage a more efficient and more effective widespread adoption of the tool into the teacher's curriculum. The teachers involved in this study are actively involved in the\n\nFASTER - A tool for DSN forecasting and scheduling\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWerntz, David; Loyola, Steven; Zendejas, Silvino\n\n1993-01-01\n\nFASTER (Forecasting And Scheduling Tool for Earth-based Resources) is a suite of tools designed for forecasting and scheduling JPL's Deep Space Network (DSN). The DSN is a set of antennas and other associated resources that must be scheduled for satellite communications, astronomy, maintenance, and testing. FASTER consists of MS-Windows based programs that replace two existing programs (RALPH and PC4CAST). FASTER was designed to be more flexible, maintainable, and user friendly. FASTER makes heavy use of commercial software to allow for customization by users. FASTER implements scheduling as a two pass process: the first pass calculates a predictive profile of resource utilization; the second pass uses this information to calculate a cost function used in a dynamic programming optimization step. This information allows the scheduler to 'look ahead' at activities that are not as yet scheduled. FASTER has succeeded in allowing wider access to data and tools, reducing the amount of effort expended and increasing the quality of analysis.\n\nCritical Evaluations and Instructional Potential of Authoring and Titled Program Software.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nReppert, James E.\n\nThis paper describes and evaluates the instructional uses of the Claris Works and Ultimedia Tools Series authoring programs and the following titled software programs: CNN Time Capsule: 100 Defining Moments of 1993; Windows Magazine: 1994; Ultimate Digital Studio; Data Trek Manager Series; and Cinemania '95.

It is a FORTRAN or C-language callable library designed to allow the user to deal with many computer environments which use VT terminals for window management and graphic systems. It also provides a PLOT10-like package plus color or shade capability for VT240, VT241, and VT300 terminals. The program is transportable to many different computers which use VT terminals. With this graphics package, the user can easily design more friendly user interface programs and design PLOT10 programs on VT terminals with different computer systems. VTGRAPH was developed using the ReGis Graphics set which provides a full range of graphics capabilities. The basic VTGRAPH capabilities are as follows: window management, PLOT10 compatible drawing, generic program routines for two and three dimensional plotting, and color graphics or shaded graphics capability. The program was developed in VAX FORTRAN in 1988. VTGRAPH requires a ReGis graphics set terminal and a FORTRAN compiler.
