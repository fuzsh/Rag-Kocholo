Ordinary scabies is commonly treated with topical creams such as permethrin, while crusted scabies is treated with topical creams in combination with oral ivermectin. Recent reports of acaricide tolerance in scabies endemic communities in Northern Australia have prompted efforts to better understand resistance mechanisms and to identify potential new acaricides. In this study, we screened three essential oils and four pure compounds based on eugenol for acaricidal properties. Methodology/Principal Findings Contact bioassays were performed using live permethrin-sensitive S. scabiei var suis mites harvested from pigs and permethrin-resistant S. scabiei var canis mites harvested from rabbits. Results of bioassays showed that clove oil was highly toxic against scabies mites. Nutmeg oil had moderate toxicity and ylang ylang oil was the least toxic. Eugenol, a major component of clove oil and its analogues âacetyleugenol and isoeugenol, demonstrated levels of toxicity comparable to benzyl benzoate, the positive control acaricide, killing mites within an hour of contact. Conclusions The acaricidal properties demonstrated by eugenol and its analogues show promise as leads for future development of alternative topical acaricides to treat scabies.

There are relatively few current treatment options for scabies, and they possess important limitations. The treatments are ineffective in preventing relapse, inflammatory skin reactions and associated bacterial skin infections. There are also safety concerns, especially in children and pregnant women. Furthermore, there has been the emergence of resistance among scabies mites to the classical acaricides. More research needs to be devoted to developing new treatments for scabies.

It has been a source of distress for humanity since antiquity. The troublesome mite is emerging triumphant over current acaricidal agents with reports of emerging resistance and treatment failures. Scabies in endemic areas and crusted scabies offer additional management challenges. Exploration of indigenous plants and better understanding of mite biology and pathogenesis provide opportunities for the development of novel agents for this common pest. We review the recent diverse approaches to scabies, including the use of novel plant products with a better safety profile, translating the use of moxidectin from veterinary practice to human scabies, vaccination, immunotherapy, and development of drugs that directly target mite molecules.

Outbreak investigation. The intensive care unit of a 750-bed university hospital and an affiliated 92-bed rehabilitation center. All exposed individuals were screened by a senior staff dermatologist. Scabies was diagnosed on the basis of (1) identification of mites by skin scraping, (2) identification of mites by dermoscopy, or (3) clinical examination of patients without history of prior treatment for typical burrows. During a follow-up period of 6 months, the attack rate was calculated as the number of symptomatic individuals divided by the total number of exposed individuals. All exposed healthcare workers (HCWs) and their household members underwent preemptive treatment. Initially, the most effective registered drug in Switzerland (ie, topical lindane) was prescribed, but this prescription was switched to topical permethrin or systemic ivermectin as a result of the progression of the outbreak. Individuals with any signs or symptoms of scabies underwent dermatological examination. Within 7 months, 19 cases of scabies were diagnosed, 6 in children with a mean age of 3.1 years after exposure to the index patient with HIV and crusted scabies. A total of 1,640 exposed individuals underwent preemptive treatment. The highest attack rate of 26%-32% was observed among HCWs involved in the care of the index patient. A too-restricted definition of individuals at risk, noncompliance with treatment, and the limited effectiveness of lindane likely led to treatment failure, relapse, and reinfestation within families. Crusted scabies resulted in high attack rates among HCWs and household contacts. Timely institution of hygienic precautions with close monitoring and widespread, simultaneous scabicide treatment of all exposed individuals are essential for control of an\n\nRetrospective analysis of institutional scabies outbreaks from 1984 to 2013: lessons learned and moving forward.\n\nPubMed\n\nMounsey, K E; Murray, H C; King, M; Oprescu, F\n\n2016-08-01\n\nScabies outbreaks can be disruptive in institutional settings, and are associated with considerable but under-researched morbidity, especially in vulnerable populations. In this paper, we describe key findings from a retrospective review of scabies outbreaks reported in the literature over the past 30 years. We undertook this review to gain insights into the impact of institutional outbreaks, the burden in terms of attack rates, economic costs, treatment trends, the types of index cases and outbreak progression. We found 84 reports over 30 years, with outbreaks most frequently reported in aged care facilities (n = 40) and hospitals (n = 33). On average, scabies outbreaks persisted for 3 months, and the median attack rate was 38%. While 1% lindane was once the most commonly employed acaricide, 5% permethrin and oral ivermectin are increasingly used. Crusted scabies represented the index case for 83% of outbreaks, and scabies was misdiagnosed in 43% outbreaks. The frequency of reported scabies outbreaks has not declined consistently over time suggesting the disease is still highly problematic. We contend that more research and practice emphasis must be paid to improve diagnostic methods, surveillance and control, health staff education and management of crusted scabies to prevent the development of scabies outbreaks in institutional settings.\n\nScabies\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nScabies is an easily-spread skin disease caused by a very small mite. ...

An expanding epidemic continues in most parts of the world. Scabies is frequently seen in many guises that may be difficult to diagnose: scabies in the clean, scabies incognito, nodular scabies, animal-transmitted scabies, scabies in infants, scabies with syphillis, and Norwegian scabies. If the diagnosis cannot be confirmed by identifying the mite, synthesis of suggestive features may establish the diagnosis. Recently adopted children from foreign countries, especially southeastern Asia, have had a high frequency of scabies, which may appear after the children arrive in the United States. Acute glomerulonephritis may develop in patients whose scabetic lesions are complicated by a Virulent nephritogenic streptococcal strain.\n\nScabies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBanerji, Anna\n\n2015-01-01\n\nScabies is a contagious skin infestation caused by a mite. It causes significant global morbidity, with an estimated 300 million cases annually. Although it can affect individuals at any socioeconomic level, individuals who live in poverty or in overcrowded conditions are at much higher risk for scabies. Lack of local expertise can result in failure to recognize scabies, leading to delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment of cases and contacts. Scabies disproportionately affects many Indigenous (First Nations, Inuit, MÃ©tis) communities where risk factors are present. Scabies risk is also higher in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Institutional outbreaks of scabies have also been reported. Apart from a very itchy rash, scabies can lead to secondary bacterial infections and related complications, as well as to stigmatization, depression, insomnia and significant financial costs. Topical antiscabies lotions are still the mainstay of treatment, but oral ivermectin has also proven effective under certain circumstances. Asymptomatic and symptomatic household members should all be treated at the same time. In Canada and globally, the presence of scabies is usually a symptom of poor living conditions and a sign that basic necessities need improvement. Clinicians who work with Indigenous communities can improve their ability to diagnose and treat scabies, and should advocate for better living conditions where scabies is prevalent.

A retrospective study of 79 cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nSouza, Clarissa P; Torres, Sheila M F; Koch, Sandra N; Rendahl, Aaron; Verocai, Guilherme G\n\n2016-06-01\n\nScabies infestation is one of the most pruritic dermatoses of dogs. It is often misdiagnosed and dogs are treated with immunomodulatory drugs (IMD) to relieve pruritus. The primary goals of this study were to determine the impact of IMD on skin scraping results, pruritus level and extent of skin lesions, and to evaluate whether disease duration is associated with positive skin scrapings and contagion. Seventy nine dogs with a final diagnosis of scabies. Inclusion in this retrospective study required a positive skin scraping for scabies or a clinical response to an acaricidal treatment trial. The average pruritus score of dogs that received IMD (8.71) was significantly higher than those that did not (7.43; P = 0.03). However, there were no significant differences in either the rates of positive skin scrapings (79.6% versus 59.1%; P = 0.13) or the mean number of body sites affected (3.8 versus 3.4; P = 0.30) between dogs that received IMD and those that did not. Neither skin scraping status nor duration of clinical signs were correlated with a report of contagion within the household. IMD was associated with a significant increase in the pruritus level, but not with the mean number of lesional body sites. Dogs exposed to IMD had a 20.5% higher rate of positive skin scrapings. This difference could be clinically relevant and lack of statistical significance may indicate an underpowered study.

Scabies mites (Sarcoptes scabiei) are thought to promote bacterial infections by breaching the skin barrier and excreting molecules that inhibit host innate immune responses. Epidemiological studies in humans confirm increased incidence of impetigo, generally caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, secondary to the epidermal infestation with the parasitic mite. It is therefore possible that mite infestation could alter the healthy skin microbiota making way for the opportunistic pathogens. A longitudinal study to test this hypothesis in humans is near impossible due to ethical reasons. In a porcine model we generated scabies infestations closely resembling the disease manifestation in humans and investigated the scabies associated changes in the skin microbiota over the course of a mite infestation. In a 21 week trial, skin scrapings were collected from pigs infected with S. scabies var. suis and scabies-free control animals. A total of 96 skin scrapings were collected before, during infection and after acaricide treatment, and analyzed by bacterial 16S rDNA tag-encoded FLX-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing. We found significant changes in the epidermal microbiota, in particular a dramatic increase in Staphylococcus correlating with the onset of mite infestation in animals challenged with scabies mites. This increase persisted beyond treatment from mite infection and healing of skin. Furthermore, the staphylococci population shifted from the commensal S. hominis on the healthy skin prior to scabies mite challenge to S. chromogenes, which is increasingly recognized as being pathogenic, coinciding with scabies infection in pigs.

The mite tracts, known as burrows and a characteristic presentation of the pruritic condition, are typically found on the web spaces between the fingers. Other cutaneous lesions include excoriated papules, pustules, and vesicles. However, atypical clinical variants of scabies, such as bullous, crusted, hidden, incognito, nodular, and scalp forms of the parasitic infestation, mimic the morphologic features of other non-parasitic dermatoses. A 76-year-old man presented with pruritic blisters and urticarial plaques that demonstrated not only pathology changes, but direct immunofluorescence also showed findings of bullous pemphigoid. His condition improved, but did not resolve, with topical corticosteroid cream for the management of the primary autoimmune blistering disorder. When other family members subsequently developed scabies, the correct diagnosis for his condition, bullous scabies, was established by demonstrating mites, ova, and scybala on a mineral oil preparation from a skin scraping of a newly appearing burrow. Bullous scabies can masquerade not only clinically, but also both pathologically and immunologically as bullous pemphigoid. Scabies serrupticius is introduced as a unifying term to designate all of the non-classic presentations of S. scabiei mite infestation.

The outbreak potentially effected 460 patients and 185 health care workers who had been exposed to the index patient. Containment of an outbreak relies on a quick and strict implementation of appropriate infection control measures and should include simultaneous treatment of all infested persons and exposed contacts to prevent secondary spread and prolonged post-intervention surveillance.

With the launch of the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies (IACS) in 2012, this review aims to present the recent evidence of the current epidemiological situation for scabies across the globe. Mindful of the fact that the downstream complications of scabies infestations, pyoderma, streptococcal glomerulonephritis and subsequent chronic renal impairment and rheumatic fever, have been recognized as being more significant to global health than previously acknowledged, the review focusses also on the epidemiological evidence from developing countries. Scabies occurrence rates vary in the recent literature from 2.71 per 1000 to 46%. Although it is responsible for larger disease burdens and complications such as pyoderma and renal and heart disease in the tropics, scabies outbreaks in the developed world amongst vulnerable communities and health institutions contribute a significant cost to the health services managing them. Scabies remains common across the world, but is such a health issue in the developing world that the suggestion that it be considered a neglected tropical disease is a pertinent one. Standardized diagnostic criteria and even a point-of-care diagnostic test would be a major contribution to the understanding of this epidemic.\n\n[Diagnosis and evolution of scabies].\n\nPubMed\n\nPiÃ©rard-Franchimont, C; Hermanns-LÃª, T; PiÃ©rard, G E\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHuman scabies is an ectoparasitosis affecting any individual at any age.

Generalized itching causes discomfort to the patient; however, serious complications can occur as a result of secondary bacterial pyoderma, commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) or Staphylococcus aureus. In the tropics, skin damage due to scabies mite infestations has been postulated to be an important link in the pathogenesis of disease associated with acute rheumatic fever and heart disease, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and systemic sepsis. Treatment of scabies decreases the prevalence of infections by bacteria. This study aims to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the link between scabies and GAS infections. Methodology/Principal Findings GAS bacteria were pre-incubated with blood containing active complement, phagocytes and antibodies against the bacteria, and subsequently tested for viability by plate counts. Initial experiments were done with serum from an individual previously exposed to GAS with naturally acquired anti-GAS antibodies. The protocol was optimized for large-scale testing of low-opsonic whole blood from non-exposed human donors by supplementing with a standard dose of heat inactivated human sera previously exposed to GAS. This allowed an extension of the dataset to two additional donors and four proteins tested at a range of concentrations. Shown first is the effect of scabies mite complement inhibitors on human complement using ELISA-based complement activation assays. Six purified recombinant mite proteins tested at a concentration of 50 Âµg/ml blocked all three complement activation pathways. Further we demonstrate in human whole blood assays that each of four scabies mite complement inhibitors tested increased GAS survival rates by 2â15 fold. Conclusions/Significance We propose that local complement inhibition plays an important role in the development of pyoderma in scabies\n\nScabies of the nail unit.\n\nPubMed\n\nOh, Susan; Vandergriff, Travis\n\n2014-10-15\n\nScabies limited to the nail unit is quite unusual, but may persist after treatment of crusted scabies.

Scabies occurs across Australia, but most frequently in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations in tropical regions, including in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In temperate settings, the disease clusters in institutional care facilities. The objective of this article is to provide updates on the clinical diagnosis and treatment approaches for scabies in Australia. Clinical examination remains the mainstay of diagnosis, although dermatoscopy is a useful adjunct. Scabies presents with severe itch and a papular rash, with a predilection for the hands, feet and genitalia. The distribution may be more widespread in infants and older people. Secondary bacterial infection is also common in patients with scabies. Crusted scabies is a rare but highly infectious variant. Topical permethrin is highly effective for individual treatment, but less practical for treatment of asymptomatic contacts and control of outbreaks. Oral ivermectin is a safe and effective alternative, and is now listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as a third-line treatment.\n\nScabies (For Parents)\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

The scabies mite burrows into the skin, producing a papular rash and severe itch at typical sites of predilection. We systematically reviewed the literature to compare the efficacy of various anti-scabies agents, including a calculation of relative risks and confidence intervals. A literature search yielded 596 initial hits; after screening in accor-dance with the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 studies were selected for this review. Among topical treatments for scabies, permethrin was equally effective or more effective than crotamiton or benzyl benzoate. In a comparison of topical versus systemic treatment, topical permethrin and systemic ivermectin did not differ substantially in efficacy (7 comparative studies revealed no difference; one revealed a difference in favor of permethrin). Comparative trials of topical benzyl benzoate versus systemic ivermectin yielded inconsistent findings. Single and double administrations of ivermectin were similarly effective. In trials involving entire populations with a high prevalence of scabies, systemic ivermectin was found to be superior to topical permethrin. There are hardly any differences in efficacy between the available treatments for scabies. Single administrations of permethrin 5%, crotamiton 10%, and systemic ivermectin are all comparably effective. There are differences in the frequeny and ease of application as well as when eradicating scabies in populations with a high prevalence.\n\nRisk factors for recurrence of scabies: a retrospective study of scabies patients in a long-term care hospital.\n\nPubMed\n\nMakigami, Kuniko; Ohtaki, Noriko; Ishii, Norihisa; Tamashiro, Tetsuko; Yoshida, Sadao; Yasumura, Seiji\n\n2011-09-01\n\nA considerable number of patients suffer recurrence of scabies. To elucidate risk factors for recurrence of scabies, we compared patients who experienced scabies recurrence and those who suffered scabies only once. We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of all scabies patients in a long-term care hospital for the elderly (300 beds; six wards) for a period of 42 months to determine frequency of scabies onsets, underlying diseases, history of treatment, and demographic data such as age and sex. One hundred and forty-eight patients and five hospital staff members suffered scabies during the 42-month study period. All staff members and 98 patients had no recurrence, while 50 patients experienced at least one recurrence of scabies. The cumulative number of scabies diagnoses was 228. The rates of scabies onset and recurrence were considerably different among wards. The dementia unit showed the highest rate of onset and recurrence. In addition to frequent exposure to infectious sources, problematic behavior, such as lying in other patients beds, might cause the high recurrence rate in dementia units. Higher serum total lymphocyte count and topical use of Î³-benzene hexachloride were associated with lower risk of scabies recurrence. Recurrence of scabies is not uncommon among elderly patients in institutional settings. Impaired immunity may be a risk factor for recurrence of scabies. Groups with a high onset rate of scabies pose a high likelihood of recurrence. Problematic behavior of demented patients may increase the risk of recurrence. Use of effective topical treatment may effectively prevent recurrence.

It is also a problem in hospitals that care for the elderly, the debilitated, and the immunocompromised. New outbreaks continue to occur, despite controlling the recurrent epidemics. Scabies manifests as papules, pustules, burrows, nodules, and occasionally urticarial papules and plaques. Most of the patients with scabies experience severe pruritus. A subset of patients have crusted or Norwegian scabies. These patients, who are usually debilitated or immunocompromised, do not experience the urge to scratch, and therefore do not scratch their own skin. Diagnosis of scabies is based on patient history, physical examination, and demonstration of mites, eggs, or scybala (black or brown football-shaped masses of feces of scabies) on microscopic examination. Scabies can be treated with topical or oral therapies. Topical treatments include 5% permethrin cream, 1% lindane (gamma benzene hexachloride) lotion, 6% precipitated sulfur in petrolatum, crotamiton, malathion, allethrin spray, and benzyl benzoate. Ivermectin, the only oral treatment, is not approved for scabies in the US. Most authorities advocate using a scabicide several times, specifically once a week over a period of 2-3 weeks. In an outbreak of scabies in a nursing home, residents, staff, and frequent visitors should all be treated even if they are not symptomatic. Ivermectin is useful in treating patients with Norwegian or crusted scabies, or who are debilitated. Ivermectin has no serious reported adverse effects. Model treatment plans to stop scabies epidemics have been developed. These plans coordinate treatment of all persons exposed (including ivermectin for debilitated patients), isolation of infected patients, disinfection of objects that patients have come into contact with, and education and reassurance of the medical staff.

If a desquamative disease such as psoriasis precedes scabies, then the disease course may be altered. Pruritus may be absent and typical scabies lesions may be concealed due to the preexisting disease, resulting in delayed diagnosis. We present 2 cases of scabies in a brother and sister with erythrodermic psoriasis. In both cases peripheral hypereosinophilia suggested scabies. In patients with erythematous scaly inflammatory skin diseases who are treated with immunosuppressive agents, peripheral eosinophilia also could suggest scabies; therefore, a search for sarcoptic mites in skin scrapings should be undertaken.\n\nDiagnosis, prevention, and treatment of scabies.\n\nPubMed\n\nShimose, Luis; Munoz-Price, L Silvia\n\n2013-10-01\n\nScabies remains a public health problem, especially in developing countries, with a worldwide incidence of approximately 300 million cases each year. Prolonged skin-to-skin contact is necessary to allow the transmission of the causative mite, Sarcoptes scabiei. Classic scabies presents with burrows, erythematous papules, and generalized pruritus. Clinical variants include nodular scabies and crusted scabies, also called Norwegian scabies. The diagnosis is based mainly on history and physical examination, but definitive diagnosis depends on direct visualization of the mites under microscopy. Alternative diagnostic methods include the burrow ink test, video-dermatoscopy, newly serologic tests like PCR/ELISA, and specific IgE directed toward major mite components. Treatment of scabies consists of either topical permethrin or oral ivermectin, although the optimal regimen is still unclear.\n\nSpatial distribution of acaricide profiles (Boophilus microplus strains susceptible or resistant to acaricides) in southeastern Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrÃ­guez-Vivas, R I; Rivas, A L; Chowell, G; Fragoso, S H; Rosario, C R; GarcÃ­a, Z; Smith, S D; Williams, J J; Schwager, S J\n\n2007-05-15\n\nThe ability of Boophilus microplus strains to be susceptible (-) or resistant (+) to amidines (Am), synthetic pyrethroids (SP), and/or organo-phosphates (OP) (or acaricide profiles) was investigated in 217 southeastern Mexican cattle ranches (located in the states of YucatÃ¡n, Quintana Roo, and Tabasco). Three questions were asked: (1) whether acaricide profiles varied at random and, if not, which one(s) explained more (or less) cases than expected, (2) whether the spatial distribution of acaricide profiles was randomly or non-randomly distributed, and (3) whether acaricide profiles were associated with farm-related covariates (frequency of annual treatments, herd size, and farm size). Three acaricide profiles explained 73.6% of the data, representing at least twice as many cases as expected (P<0.001): (1) Am-SP-, (2) Am+SP+, and (3) (among ranches that dispensed acaricides > or = 6 times/year) Am-OP+SP+. Because ticks collected in YucatÃ¡n ranches tended to be susceptible to Am, those of Quintana Roo ranches displayed, predominantly, resistance to OP/SP, and Tabasco ticks tended to be resistant to Am (all with P < or = 0.05), acaricide profiles appeared to be non-randomly disseminated over space. Across states, two farm-related covariates were associated with resistance (P < or = 0.02): (1) high annual frequency of acaricide treatments, and (2) large farm size. Findings supported the hypothesis that spatial acaricide profiles followed neither random nor homogeneous data distributions, being partially explained by agent- and/or farm-specific factors. Some profiles could not be explained by these factors. Further spatially explicit studies (addressing host-related factors) are recommended.\n\nThe profile of scabies patients in Zagreb.\n\nPubMed\n\nKosanoviÄ LiÄina, Mirjana Lana; Quiaios, AndrÃ©; TeÅ¡iÄ, Vanja; Domingues, JosÃ©; SÃ¡, Nelson\n\n2014-12-01\n\nScabies is a mandatory notifiable disease according to Croatian law. Due to an increased reports of scabies within a couple of years in Zagreb, we decided to present epidemiological characteristics of patients diagnosed with scabies in Zagreb. A retrospective survey was carried out in county Public Health Institute \"Dr. Andrija Stampar\" in Zagreb and analysis was performed for the period of 2010-2013 upon individual notifications on scabies cases. The patients are presented by sociodemographic data, diagnosis and treatment. In a 4 year period there were 246 scabies cases recorded in Zagreb. Cases have been registered in all quarters of the City. The highest incidence (50/100 000) was recorded in every child age group following by incidence of over 30/100 000 in elderly institutionalized in nursing homes. In almost two thirds of patients management of scabies has not been conducted in accordance to current guidelines. 10% of scabies cases were found in medical health personnel predominantly in those working in nursing homes and psychiatric wards. A small amount of cases 19 (8%) were infected outside Croatia; the majority of these cases 15 (78%) are registered within last two years. High percentage of scabies cases registered in nursing homes and psychiatric wards suggests that there is a need of raising awareness on scabies epidemiology and management by public health officers. Due to a higher incidence of scabies in children age, the obligation of medical practitioners is also to emphasize the importance of following treatment guidelines. In order to control scabies cases as well to prevent outbreaks within hospital wards or nursing homes there is an obligation of implementation of strict guidelines regarding treatment of scabies and a public health service referral.\n\nThe preparation of neem oil microemulsion (Azadirachta indica) and the comparison of acaricidal time between neem oil microemulsion and other formulations in vitro.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Jiao; Fan, Qiao-Jia; Yin, Zhong-Qiong; Li, Xu-Ting; Du, Yong-Hua; Jia, Ren-Yong; Wang, Kai-Yu; Lv, Cheng; Ye, Gang; Geng, Yi; Su, Gang; Zhao, Ling; Hu, Ting-Xiu; Shi, Fei; Zhang, Li; Wu, Chang-Long; Tao, Cui; Zhang, Ya-Xue; Shi, Dong-Xia\n\n2010-05-11\n\nThe preparation of neem oil microemulsion and its acaricidal activity in vitro was developed in this study. In these systems, the mixture of Tween-80 and the sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) (4:1, by weight) was used as compound surfactant; the mixture of compound surfactant and hexyl alcohol (4:1, by weight) was used as emulsifier system; the mixture of neem oil, emulsifier system and water (1:3.5:5.5, by weight) was used as neem oil microemulsion. All the mixtures were stired in 800 rpm for 15 min at 40 degrees C. The acaricidal activity was measured by the speed of kill. The whole lethal time value of 10% neem oil microemulsion was 192.50 min against Sarcoptes scabiei var. cuniculi larvae in vitro. The median lethal time value was 81.7463 min with the toxicity regression equations of Y=-6.0269+3.1514X. These results demonstrated that neem oil microemulsion was effective against Sarcoptes scabie var. cuniculi larvae in vitro. (c) 2010. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This was particularly evident during the Second World War when it was estimated that there were one to two million patients with scabies in Great Britain. This article reviews the work of the zoologist Kenneth Mellanby of England and evaluates his contribution to our knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of scabies in the Second World War. Using humans, Mellanby studied the transmission and treatment of this disease. Among his contributions were knowledge of how many mites the average patient had, and where they were located. He clearly noted and described that the scabies rash was not limited to the location of the mites on the body; he attributed the rash in areas with no mites to \"a true sensitization.\" He found that \"fomites were not the major method of transmissions.\n\n[Crusted scabies: A review].\n\nPubMed\n\nJouret, G; Bounemeur, R; Presle, A; Takin, R\n\n2016-04-01\n\nCrusted scabies is a rare and severe form of infestation by Sarcoptes scabies var. hominis. It is characterized by profuse hyperkeratosis containing over 4000 mites per gram of skin, with treatment being long and difficult. The condition is both direct and indirectly contagious. It has a central role in epidemic cycles of scabies, the incidence of which is on the rise in economically stable countries. Recent discoveries concerning the biology of mites, the pathophysiology of hyperkeratosis and the key role of IL-17 in this severe form open up new therapeutic perspectives.

Beside the stress caused by this pathogen, honeybee colonies are exposed to pesticides under beekeeper intervention, such as acaricides to control Varroa mites. These compounds can accumulate at high concentrations in apicultural matrices. In this work, the effects of parasitosis/acaricide on genes involved in honeybee immunity and survival were evaluated. Nurse bees were infected with N. ceranae and/or were chronically treated with sublethal doses of coumaphos or tau-fluvalinate, the two most abundant pesticides recorded in productive hives. Our results demonstrate the following: (1) honeybee survival was not affected by any of the treatments; (2) parasite development was not altered by acaricide treatments; (3) coumaphos exposure decreased lysozyme expression; (4) N. ceranae reduced levels of vitellogenin transcripts independently of the presence of acaricides. However, combined effects among stressors on imagoes were not recorded. Sublethal doses of acaricides and their interaction with other ubiquitous parasites in colonies, extending the experimental time, are of particular interest in further research work.\n\nThe Potential for a Blood Test for Scabies.\n\nPubMed\n\nArlian, Larry G; Feldmeier, Hermann; Morgan, Marjorie S\n\n2015-01-01\n\nScabies afflicts millions of people worldwide, but it is very difficult to diagnose by the usual skin scrape test, and a presumptive diagnosis is often made based on clinical signs such as rash and intense itch. A sensitive and specific blood test to detect scabies would allow a physician to quickly make a correct diagnosis. Our objective was to profile the mite-specific antibodies present in the sera of patients with ordinary scabies. Sera of 91 patients were screened for Ig, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM antibodies to S. scabiei, as well as to the house dust mites Dermatophagoides farinae, D. pteronyssinus and Euroglyphus maynei. 45%, 27% and 2.2% of the patients had measurable amounts of mixed Ig, IgG and IgE that recognized scabies mite antigens. However, 73.6% of the scabies patients had serum IgM that recognized scabies proteins, and all except two of them also had IgM that recognized all of the three species of dust mites. No patient had serum antibody exclusively reactive to scabies mite antigens. Co-sensitization or cross-reactivity between antigens from scabies and house dust mites confounds developing a blood test for scabies.\n\nCrusted scabies in remote Australia, a new way forward: lessons and outcomes from the East Arnhem Scabies Control Program.\n\nPubMed\n\nLokuge, Buddhi; Kopczynski, Alex; Woltmann, Angela; Alvoen, Faye; Connors, Christine; Guyula, Terrence; Mulholland, Eddie; Cran, Samantha; Foster, Tim; Lokuge, Kamalini; Burke, Tanya; Prince, Sam\n\n2014-06-16\n\nCrusted scabies is a highly infectious, debilitating and disfiguring disease, and remote Aboriginal communities of northern Australia have the highest reported rates of the condition in the world. We draw on monitoring data of the East Arnhem Scabies Control Program to discuss outcomes and lessons learnt through managing the condition in remote communities. Using active case finding, we identified seven patients with crusted scabies in three communities and found most had not presented to health services despite active disease. We compared presentations and hospitalisations for a cumulative total of 99 months during a novel preventive program with 99 months immediately before the program for the seven cases and seven sentinel household contacts. Our preventive long-term case management approach was associated with a significant 44% reduction in episodes of recurrent crusted scabies (from 36 to 20; P = 0.025) in the seven cases, and a non-significant 80% reduction in days spent in hospital (from 173 to 35; P = 0.09). It was also associated with a significant 75% reduction in scabies-related presentations (from 28 to 7; P = 0.017) for the seven sentinel household contacts. We recommend active surveillance and wider adoption of this preventive case management approach, with ongoing evaluation to refine protocols and improve efficiency. Contacts of children presenting with recurrent scabies should be examined to exclude crusted scabies. In households where crusted scabies is present, a diagnosis of parental neglect due to recurrent scabies and weight loss in children should be made with extreme caution. Improved coordination of care by health services, and research and development of new therapies including immunotherapies for crusted scabies, must be a priority.\n\nScabies: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

Crusted (or Norwegian) scabies is a very contagious form of scabies because of the huge number of mites in the skin. It is observed in patients suffering from immunodepression, motor or sensory deficiency, or mental retardation. The clinical presentation, except for the classic manifestation of scabies, is characterized by crusted lesions. Treatment is not easy and requires hospitalization. Topical corticosteroids are frequently used for children's dermatological diseases. Their long-term and inappropriate application in an infested scabies child can induce crusted scabies. We report on a case of an 8-year-old boy who developed crusted scabies induced by topical corticosteroid application. We discuss the therapeutic aspects of this severe form of scabies.

Dermoscopy has been suggested as an alternative for diagnosing scabies. But, there have been few well-designed studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy. We tried to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy for diagnosing scabies. We also tried to demonstrate specific circumstances in which dermoscopic identification of mites (\"with dermoscopy\") is more useful in diagnosing scabies, and to identify the specific clinical findings that could be used as a possible marker in diagnosing scabies. We compared the scraping procedure \"with dermoscopy\" and \"without it\" in 49 patients, measuring the duration and outcome of each procedure. Also, we tried to find the specific clinical factors associated with our objects. The skin scraping \"with dermoscopy\" was superior to \"without it\" with respect to the duration and accuracy of the procedure. A history of previous steroid treatment was associated with the superiority of dermoscopy. The correlation between the presence of visible burrows and the positive outcomes of \"with dermoscopy\" was statistically significant. Skin scraping with dermoscopy is implicated as the diagnostic method of choice for scabies at the present time. Dermoscopy is especially useful in diagnosis of incognito scabies. In addition, the presence of visible burrows could be a reliable positive marker of scabies in the absence of dermoscopy or microscopy data.\n\nThe Potential for a Blood Test for Scabies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nArlian, Larry G.; Feldmeier, Hermann; Morgan, Marjorie S.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Scabies afflicts millions of people worldwide, but it is very difficult to diagnose by the usual skin scrape test, and a presumptive diagnosis is often made based on clinical signs such as rash and intense itch.

Sixty-four individual cases were reported, corresponding to a crude incidence rate of 28/100 000 inhabitants. The incidence was higher in the elderly (51/100 000 in persons aged >75 years) and a higher incidence was also found in immigrants (88/100 000). More than 40% of the registered scabies patients had symptoms for more than 4 weeks at the time of presentation. In 54% of the consultations, the patient had already consulted a physician for his/her skin problem. Of this group, 44% had not yet received any scabicidal treatment, indicating that scabies was not yet diagnosed or that an inappropriate treatment was prescribed. The observations suggest that the diagnosis and/or treatment of scabies in this region can still be improved.

The UK national guidelines on STIs recommend screening for other STIs in patients with scabies attending a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. However, there is a paucity of literature on this association, which we reviewed. We looked at the sexual behaviour and the coincidence of STIs in patients with scabies attending a GUM clinic and in inmates from a young offender institution (YOI) attending between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1999. A total of 47 patients with scabies were identified in the GUM clinic population during this period and 15 patients in the YOI group. Consecutive new and rebooked sex-matched patients served as a control group. Among the GUM clinic attendees 36% of patients with scabies had multiple sexual partners in the preceding 3 months compared with 21% in the control group (P=0.11). Thirty-four per cent of patients with scabies had a previous history of STI vs 17% in the control group (P=0.058). The number of patients with coexistent STIs was not significantly different in both groups (49% vs 44%, P=0.68). The number of patients in the YOI group was too small for a statistical analysis. This study showed that patients with scabies had comparable rates of STIs as with the GUM clinic population. It therefore supports the national guidelines in recommending screening for other STIs in patients with scabies.\n\nPsoriasis or crusted scabies.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoyal, N N; Wong, G A\n\n2008-03-01\n\nWe describe a case of a 67-year-old woman with a 1-year history of nail thickening and a non-itchy erythematous scaly eruption on the fingertips. She was diagnosed with psoriasis and started on methotrexate after having had no response to topical calcipotriol. The diagnosis was reviewed after it was revealed by another consultant that the patient's husband had been attending dermatology clinics for several years with chronic pruritus, which had been repeatedly thought to be due to scabies. Our patient was found to have crusted scabies after a positive skin scraping showed numerous mites. She was treated with topical permethrin, keratolytics and oral ivermectin. We also review the literature on crusted scabies and its management, with recommendations.\n\nAn endemic of scabies in Kahuta, Azad Kashmir.

For this, a questionnaire related to scabies was distributed among the patients at different walk-in clinics in the region from June 2015 to May 2016. Of the 234 participants, 97(41.5%) were males and 137(58.5%) were females. All of them reported with itching, but 120(51.3%) of the participants didn't even know that itching may be due to scabies which was found in 157(67%) patients, and of them, 106(67.52%) knew that scabies was curable and preventable. Scabies was found in common school students (n=39(24.84%), farmers (n=32(2.38%) and laborers (n=31(19.74%). Due to poor awareness, a multi-dimensional approach is suggested to spread the awareness of skin diseases like scabies in the population under study and mass treatment of scabies in the area is recommended.\n\n[Scabies as an occupational disease].\n\nPubMed\n\nLukÃ¡cs, J; Schliemann, S; Elsner, P\n\n2015-03-01\n\nScabies is an infectious skin disease caused by the human itch mite (Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis). It is mainly transmitted by direct skin-to-skin contact. The spread of scabies can cause major difficulties in healthcare institutions, particularly in residential homes for the elderly. The disease is characterized by intense nocturnal itching, erythematous papules arranged in a linear order, and scratching resulting in excoriations. The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the mite or by finding one or more mite tunnels in the skin. An individually occurring case does not need to be reported. If two or more cases occur in the same institution, the company physician and the appropriate public health department are to be informed in Germany. In case of a suspected scabies infection in medical personnel due to exposure in their work setting, medical notification to the statutory occupational accidents' insuranceÂ (Nr. 3101) is to be issued in accordance with Â§Â 202, VolumeÂ VII of the German Social Code. First line treatment is topical therapy with 5â% permethrin. If scabies control is required in an institution, systemic treatment with ivermectin may be considered. In the case of a scabies outbreak, all patients, contact persons, and staff must be treated simultaneously.\n\nControlling scabies in madrasahs (Islamic religious schools) in Bangladesh.\n\nPubMed\n\nTalukder, K; Talukder, M Q K; Farooque, M G; Khairul, M; Sharmin, F; Jerin, I; Rahman, M A\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of a scabies control programme in reducing the prevalence of scabies in urban Bangladesh madrasahs, where the condition is extremely common. A controlled trial involving four intervention madrasahs (total students 2359) and four control madrasahs (total students 2465) in Dhaka Metropolitan Area. A baseline scabies sample survey was carried out on 40 and 44 students of four intervention and four control madrasahs, respectively. Another 40 students of the intervention madrasahs were administered a pre-intervention test on scabies knowledge. This was followed by mass treatment of all students, teachers and staff of the eight madrasahs with topical 5% permethrin cream. The subsequent intervention involved daily monitoring of students for five key personal hygiene practices, weekly 10-min scabies health education classes, supply of simple and inexpensive products to students to prevent cross-infestation to/from peers (e.g. plastic bags, clothes hangers), and chemotherapy of new students detected with scabies. After 4 months of the intervention, the prevalence of scabies, personal hygiene practices and scabies knowledge were assessed in students of the intervention madrasahs. Before the intervention, the prevalence of scabies was 61% and 62% in intervention and control madrasahs, respectively (PÂ =Â 1.00). After mass scabies treatment in all eight madrasahs and 4 months of intervention, the prevalence of scabies was reduced to 5% and 50% in intervention and control madrasahs, respectively (PÂ <Â 0.001). There were significant improvements in all five personal hygiene practices at the intervention madrasahs. Mean test scores for scabies knowledge were 40% before the intervention and 99% after the intervention in the four intervention madrasahs.

The itch and rash appear to be largely the result of a delayed (type IV) allergic reaction to the mite, its eggs and excreta. Scabies is spread by a mite transferring to the skin surface of an unaffected person, usually by skin to skin contact with an infested person, but occasionally via contaminated bed linen, clothes or towels. In crusted scabies, mites are also dispersed within shed scales, enabling the condition to be contracted from contaminated surfaces. Patients with classical scabies usually present with an itchy non-specific rash. Often, the history alone can be 0032-6518 virtually diagnostic. An intense itch, affecting all body regions except the head, typically worse at night, appearing to be out of proportion to the physical evidence, with a close contact also itching, should prompt serious consideration of scabies. The generalised hypersensitivity rash consists of erythematous macules and papules with excoriation. Close inspection will reveal burrows usually up to 1 cm in length. The pathognomic sign of scabies is the presence of burrows. The crusted variant of scabies may not be itchy. It is characterised by areas of dry, scaly, hyperkeratotic and crusted skin, particularly on the extremities. Referral to secondary care should be considered in the following cases: diagnostic doubt; patient under two months of age; lack of response to two ourses of different insecticides; crusted scabies; or history suggests a isk of sexually transmitted infection. Outbreaks of scabies in institutions should be referred to the local health protection services.\n\nCrusted scabies-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Despite the widely accepted association between crusted scabies and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection, crusted scabies has not been included in the spectrum of infections associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy. Case presentation We report a case of a 28-year-old Mexican individual with late HIV-infection, who had no apparent skin lesions but soon after initiation of antiretroviral therapy, he developed an aggressive form of crusted scabies with rapid progression of lesions. Severe infestation by Sarcoptes scabiei was confirmed by microscopic examination of the scale and skin biopsy. Due to the atypical presentation of scabies in a patient responding to antiretroviral therapy, preceded by no apparent skin lesions at initiation of antiretroviral therapy, the episode was interpreted for the first time as âunmasking crusted scabies-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromeâ. Conclusion This case illustrates that when crusted scabies is observed in HIV-infected patients responding to antiretroviral therapy, it might as well be considered as a possible manifestation of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Patient context should be considered for adequate diagnosis and treatment of conditions exacerbated by antiretroviral therapy-induced immune reconstitution.

We report the case of an infant with subungual hyperkeratosis and ungual lesions subsequent to classic scabies. A 7-month-girl, treated 6Â weeks earlier with esdepallethrin for scabies, consulted for acquired lesions on 3Â toe nails. These nails were thickened and displayed subungual hyperkeratosis. Physical examination of the skin, the finger nails and mucous membranes was otherwise normal. Fungal analyses were negative, but direct microscopic examination revealed numerous larvae of Sarcoptes scabiei as well as ovular debris. The child was treated with urea 40% to obtain chemical avulsion of the nails, and with topical esdepallethrin and a quarter tablet of ivermectin orally; there was no follow-up of the child. Ungual scabies has already been reported in crusted scabies and very rarely in classic scabies. Subungual and ungual locations of S.Â scabiei may constitute a source of reinfestation with scabies in infants. Treatment is not well defined and currently involves chemical avulsion of the nails and the application of topical antiscabies treatment. Copyright Â© 2016.

There are about 300 million cases of scabies in the world each year. Common predisposing factors are overcrowding, immigration, poor hygiene, poor nutritional status, homelessness, dementia, and sexual contact. Direct skin-to-skin contact between 15 and 20 minutes is needed to transfer the mites from one person to another. The diagnosis suspected with a clinical history of itch, worse at night, affecting other family members, clinical distribution, and appearance. Definite diagnosis relies on microscopic identification of the mites, eggs, or fecal pellets with 10% potassium hydroxide, ink enhancement, tetracycline fluorescence tests, or mineral oil; other methods include: epiluminescence light microscopy and S. scabiei DNA. The most commonly used treatment modalities are permethrin and ivermectin. Persistence of symptoms for 2-6 weeks after successful treatment is common. Most recurrences are because of reinfection from untreated contacts.\n\n[Scabies among the Zoo mammals].\n\nPubMed\n\nZuchowska, E\n\n1991-01-01\n\nScabies was observed in 9 species of mammals at the Zoological Garden of LÃ³dÅº in years 1957-1989.

Delayed treatment can lead to bacterial superinfection, and treatment of close contacts is necessary to prevent reinfestation. We describe scabies incidence and superinfection among children in American Samoa (AS) to support scabies control recommendations. We reviewed 2011-2012 pharmacy records from the only AS pharmacy to identify children aged â¤14 years with filled prescriptions for permethrin, the only scabicide available in AS. Medical records of identified children were reviewed for physician-diagnosed scabies during January 1, 2011-December 31, 2012. We calculated scabies incidence, bacterial superinfection prevalence, and reinfestation prevalence during 14-365 days after first diagnosis. We used log binomial regression to calculate incidence ratios for scabies by age, sex, and county. Medical record review identified 1,139 children with scabies (incidence 29.3/1,000 children aged â¤14 years); 604 (53%) had a bacterial superinfection. Of 613 children who received a scabies diagnosis during 2011, 94 (15.3%) had one or more reinfestation. Scabies incidence varied significantly among the nine counties (range 14.8-48.9/1,000 children). Children aged <1 year had the highest incidence (99.9/1,000 children). Children aged 0-4 years were 4.9 times more likely and those aged 5-9 years were 2.2 times more likely to have received a scabies diagnosis than children aged 10-14 years. Scabies and its sequelae cause substantial morbidity among AS children. Bacterial superinfection prevalence and frequent reinfestations highlight the importance of diagnosing scabies and early treatment of patients and close contacts. Investigating why certain AS counties have a lower scabies incidence might help guide recommendations for improving scabies control among counties with a higher incidence\n\nImpact of scabies in resource-poor communities.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeukelbach, Jorg; Mazigo, Humphrey D; Ugbomoiko, Uade S\n\n2013-04-01\n\nFeatures of endemic scabies are specific in resource-poor and underprivileged communities, with implications for control measures on the community level. In this review, these special aspects are addressed. Scabies is endemic in many resource-poor communities, with a prevalence of 20% and higher. Transmission is influenced by social attitudes, migration, access to healthcare services, housing conditions, hygiene conditions, and crowding. Endemic scabies occurs with severe infestations, complications, and sequels, mainly in children. Sleep loss as a result of scabies-related itching is common. Complications include secondary infections by group A streptococci and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Shame, restriction of leisure activities, and stigmatization are common. Treatment of scabies includes a variety of topical compounds, but control on the community level is not an easy task. As ivermectin kills a variety of other parasites, this oral drug is increasingly used for mass treatment. Intervention should address socioemotional aspects using an integrated approach with professionals from different areas, and the community. Scabies is a neglected disease and needs to be perceived as an important public health problem causing morbidity in many resource-poor communities. Future work on epidemiology, clinical aspects, transmission dynamics, socioeconomic aspects, and sustainable control in resource-poor communities is needed.\n\nNorwegian crusted scabies: an unusual case presentation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaghrabi, Michael M; Lum, Shireen; Joba, Ameha T; Meier, Molly J; Holmbeck, Ryan J; Kennedy, Kate\n\n2014-01-01\n\nScabies is a contagious condition that is transmitted through direct contact with an infected person and has been frequently associated with institutional and healthcare-facility outbreaks. The subtype Norwegian crusted scabies can masquerade as other dermatologic diseases owing to the heavy plaque formation. Successful treatment has been documented in published reports, including oral ivermectin and topical permethrin. Few case studies documenting the treatment of Norwegian crusted scabies have reported the use of surgical debridement as an aid to topical and/or oral treatment when severe plaque formation has been noted. A nursing home patient was admitted to the hospital for severe plaque formation of both feet. A superficial biopsy was negative for both fungus and scabies because of the severity of the plaque formation on both feet. The patient underwent a surgical, diagnostic biopsy of both feet, leading to the diagnosis of Norwegian crusted scabies. A second surgical debridement was then performed to remove the extensive plaque formation and aid the oral ivermectin and topical permethrin treatment. The patient subsequently made a full recovery and was discharged back to the nursing home. At 2 and 6 months after treatment, the patient remained free of scabies infestation, and the surgical wound had healed uneventfully. The present case presentation has demonstrated that surgical debridement can be complementary to the standard topical and oral medications in the treatment of those with Norwegian crusted scabies infestation.

Scabies infections are a major health problem, particularly in remote Indigenous communities in Australia, where co-infection of epidermal scabies lesions by Group A Streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus is thought to be responsible for the high rate of rheumatic heart disease and chronic kidney disease. We collected and separately sequenced mite DNA from several pools of thousands of whole mites from a porcine model of scabies (S. scabiei var. suis) and two human patients (S. scabiei var. hominis) living in different regions of northern Australia. Our sequencing samples the mite and its metagenome, including the mite gut flora and the wound micro-environment. Here, we describe the mitochondrial genome of the scabies mite. We developed a new de novo assembly pipeline based on a bait-and-reassemble strategy, which produced a 14 kilobase mitochondrial genome sequence assembly. We also annotated 35 genes and have compared these to other Acari mites. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and used these to infer the presence of six haplogroups in our samples, Remarkably, these fall into two closely-related clades with one clade including both human and pig varieties. This supports earlier findings that only limited genetic differences may separate some human and animal varieties, and raises the possibility of cross-host infections. Finally, we used these mitochondrial haplotypes to show that the genetic diversity of individual infections is typically small with 1-3 distinct haplotypes per infestation.\n\n[Norwegian scabies, a rare diagnosis in Tunisia].\n\nPubMed\n\nMebazaa, Amel; Bedday, Bouraoui; Trabelsi, Sabiha; Denguezli, Mohamed; Ben Said, Moncef; Belajouza, Colandane; Nouira, Rafiaa\n\n2006-10-01\n\nNorwegian scabies is a particular form of scabies, rarely reported in Tunisia.

About 300 million cases of scabies are reported annually. Scabies usually presents clinically with an erythematous excoriated papulovesicular rash, burrows, nodules and hyperkeratotic lesions in specific body areas. A rare presentation of scabies is the bullous pemphigoid-like bullous scabies. So far, to the best of our knowledge, only 32 cases of bullous scabies have been reported in medical literature, of which only 11 were under 60 years of age at the time of initial presentation. This is the first case of bullous scabies being reported from Pakistan. Herein we discuss, with reference to the existing literature, the case of a 23-year-old Punjabi male who presented with a 3 day history of a tense, non-erythematous, non-tender bulla measuring approximately 0.5 cm x 0.8 cm on the right foot near the interdigital cleft. He was diagnosed to have bullous scabies. The diagnosis of scabies should be considered in all patients who present with tense bullous lesions accompanied by pruritus and a maculopapular rash. This is particularly relevant if these lesions do not resolve with steroid treatment. In such patients, in order to prevent a misdiagnosis of bullous pemphigoid, scrapings for Sarcoptes Scabiei mites and eggs should be taken.\n\nIgnoring the \"Itch\": The Global Health Problem of Scabies.\n\nPubMed\n\nStamm, Lola V; Strowd, Lindsay C\n\n2017-12-01\n\nInfestation with Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis is a common human parasitic affliction endemic in tropical developing countries. Scabies is transmitted by close person-person contact, and outbreaks have been reported in reception centers for asylum seekers. Scabies presents clinically as extremely pruritic excoriated papules and linear burrows in the skin. This infestation predisposes to bacterial skin infections that can result in serious complications affecting the kidneys and possibly the heart. Treatment of individuals with scabies and their close contacts involves the use of antiparasitic agents. First-line treatment is topical 5% permethrin cream. Community mass drug administration, followed by active case finding with targeted treatment, is a promising approach that can reduce the prevalence of both scabies and bacterial skin infections. Organizations such as the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies are advocating for the development of integrated disease control strategies in an effort to decrease scabies infestation worldwide.\n\nDetection of scabies: A systematic review of diagnostic methods.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeung, Victor; Miller, Mark\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAccurate diagnosis of scabies infection is important for patient treatment and for public health control of scabies epidemics. To systematically review the accuracy and precision of history, physical examination and tests for diagnosing scabies. Using a structured search strategy, Medline and Embase databases were searched for English and French language articles that included a diagnosis of scabies. Studies comparing history, physical examination and/or any diagnostic tests with the reference standard of microscopic visualization of mites, eggs or fecal elements obtained from skin scrapings or biopsies were included for analysis. Data were extracted using standard criteria. History and examination of pruritic dermatoses failed to accurately diagnose scabies infection. Dermatoscopy by a trained practitioner has a positive likelihood ratio of 6.5 (95% CI 4.1 to 10.3) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.1 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.2) for diagnosing scabies. The accuracy of other diagnostic tests could not be calculated from the data in the literature. In the face of such diagnostic inaccuracy, clinical judgment is still practical in diagnosing scabies. Two tests are used - the burrow ink test and handheld dermatoscopy. The burrow ink test is a simple, rapid, noninvasive test that can be used to screen a large number of patients. Handheld dermatoscopy is an accurate test, but requires special equipment and trained practitioners. Given the morbidity and costs of scabies infection, and that studies to date lack adequate internal and external validity, research to identify or develop accurate diagnostic tests for scabies infection is needed and justifiable.\n\nIncrease the risk of intellectual disability in children with scabies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, Jui-Ming; Hsu, Ren-Jun; Chang, Fung-Wei; Yeh, Chia-Lun; Huang, Chun-Fa; Chang, Shu-Ting; Chiu, Nan-Chang; Chang, Hung-Yang; Chi, Hsin; Lin, Chien-Yu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract Scabies is a common and distressing disease caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. Psychiatric disorder in childhood is an important disease and easily neglected. There are several similarities in scabies and psychiatric disorders in childhood (PDC). Both of them may present with pruritus. They are relatively common in patients with lower socioeconomic status and crowded environment. Furthermore, immune-mediated inflammatory processes play a role in the pathophysiology in both diseases. An association between scabies and psychiatric disorders may exist. This nationwide population-based cohort study utilized data from the National Health Insurance Research Database to investigate the relationship between scabies and PDC. A total of 2137 children with scabies were identified as the study group and 8548 age- and sex-matched children were selected as the control group. A total of 607 (5.68%) children developed PDC during the 7-year follow-up period. The overall incidences of PDC are similar but patients with scabies had a higher risk of developing intellectual disability (ID) (scabies group vs control group: 1.3% vs 0.6%, adjusted hazard ratio: 2.04 and 95% confidence interval: 1.25â3.32). The immune-mediated inflammatory processes of both diseases were reviewed and may contribute to the 104% increased risk of interleukin in patients with scabies. We suggest a more comprehensive management in treating patients with scabies or ID. Early and comprehensive treatment of scabies and other risk factors may decrease the risk of subsequent ID. When we approach patients with ID, concurrent evaluation of scabies and other risk factors may contribute to successful management.

To date, more than 200 cases have been reported in the literature. However, crusted scabies seems to be under-diagnosed because of its unusual presentations. In this case series we present history, clinical manifestations, KOH smear, and histopathological findings of a series of four patients with crusted scabies. Scaly scalp was a prominent feature of the disease in all cases. Examination of and treatment of the scalp of patients with suspected crusted scabies should not be neglected. A KOH smear from the scalp offers a simple and reliable technique for diagnosis.\n\nThe Importance of Scabies Coinfection in the Treatment Considerations for Impetigo.\n\nPubMed\n\nTasani, Monika; Tong, Steven Y C; Andrews, Ross M; Holt, Deborah C; Currie, Bart J; Carapetis, Jonathan R; Bowen, Asha C\n\n2016-04-01\n\nSkin infections account for a high disease burden in indigenous children living in northern Australia. Although the relationship between impetigo and scabies is recognized, the prevalence of scabies in children with impetigo is not well reported. We report the prevalence, demographics and treatment success outcomes of impetigo and scabies coinfection in indigenous children who were participants in a randomized controlled trial of impetigo treatment conducted in remote communities of the Northern Territory, Australia. Of 1715 screening episodes for impetigo, 508 children were randomized to receive intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin (BPG), twice daily co-trimoxazole (SXT) for 3 days (4 mg/kg trimethoprim plus 20 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per dose) or once daily SXT for 5 days (8 mg/kg trimethoprim plus 40 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per dose). A clinical diagnosis of scabies; tinea of the skin, scalp or nail; and head lice was made on all children. Scabies presence was not confirmed using diagnostic scrapings. In a post-hoc analysis, we determined whether coinfection with scabies had an impact on treatment success for impetigo. Of children randomized to receive treatment for impetigo, 84 of 508 (16.5%) had scabies. The presence of scabies ranged from 14.3% to 20.0% in the 3 treatment groups. Treatment success for impetigo with and without scabies coinfection, independent of the treatment groups, was 75.9% and 86.6%, respectively, absolute difference 10.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): +1% to +21%]. Treatment success for impetigo with and without scabies coinfection in the BPG group was 69.6% and 88.0%, respectively, absolute difference 18.4% (95% CI: -1% to +38%). In the pooled SXT groups, the treatment success for impetigo with and without scabies coinfection was 78.6% and 86.0%, respectively, with absolute difference 7.4% (95% CI: -4% to +18%).

The most abundant pesticides are acaricides applied by beekeepers to control Varroa destructor. Beekeepers also apply antimicrobial drugs to control bacterial and microsporidial diseases. Fungicides may enter the hive when applied to nearby flowering crops. Acaricides, antimicrobial drugs and fungicides are not highly toxic to bees alone, but in combination there is potential for heightened toxicity due to interactive effects. Methodology/Principal Findings Laboratory bioassays based on mortality rates in adult worker bees demonstrated interactive effects among acaricides, as well as between acaricides and antimicrobial drugs and between acaricides and fungicides. Toxicity of the acaricide tau-fluvalinate increased in combination with other acaricides and most other compounds tested (15 of 17) while amitraz toxicity was mostly unchanged (1 of 15). The sterol biosynthesis inhibiting (SBI) fungicide prochloraz elevated the toxicity of the acaricides tau-fluvalinate, coumaphos and fenpyroximate, likely through inhibition of detoxicative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity. Four other SBI fungicides increased the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate in a dose-dependent manner, although possible evidence of P450 induction was observed at the lowest fungicide doses. Non-transitive interactions between some acaricides were observed. Sublethal amitraz pre-treatment increased the toxicity of the three P450-detoxified acaricides, but amitraz toxicity was not changed by sublethal treatment with the same three acaricides. A two-fold change in the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate was observed between years, suggesting a possible change in the genetic composition of the bees tested. Conclusions/Significance Interactions with acaricides in honey bees are similar to drug interactions in other animals in that P450-mediated detoxication appears to play an\n\nDetection of scabies: A systematic review of diagnostic methods\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeung, Victor; Miller, Mark\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of scabies infection is important for patient treatment and for public health control of scabies epidemics.

First-line pharmacologic treatment of pediculosis is permethrin 1% lotion or shampoo. Multiple novel treatments have shown limited evidence of effectiveness superior to permethrin. Wet combing is an effective nonpharmacologic treatment option. Finding pubic lice should prompt an evaluation for other sexually transmitted infections.
