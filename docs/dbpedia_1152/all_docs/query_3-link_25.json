AKMACT; The first chess-playing automaton was built by tte hunga-rian mechanic Farkash Kempelen in 1769 and made a triumphant sweep all round the world. It burnt, however, in a fire in philadel= phia and the whole humbug was exposed. The Spanish engineer Torres Kevedo built a real automaton in 189o. let this automaton won only with a specific opening of the game. Recently, the chess- amateurs were excited by a sensational news. ii new machine was sitting at the cness-board, viz. the electronic calculating-machine. It is known, in the age of progress - that the brains of a man are the backbone of any machine, no matter now clever it is. With every game, even the most simple one, opposing interests meet and the ad= versary tries to exploit to his own advantage the mistakes arrl errors committed by his antagonist. Mathematic tried to disclose the secret of the complicated compe- tition between reasonable beings and to determine its rules. The Card 1/3 mathematicians Nleynan, Uold, and others succeeded approximately 3o A Dispassionate Partner 2?-3-7/25 years ago in establishing the bases of the mathematical theory of playing. This is of great fundamental importance and of prac= tical. application in economics, strategy and other fields. In the theory of playing it is proved that the issue of a game of chess depends an both the opening and the selected strategy. Our attach= ment to chess, however, is based on the very fact that vie do not know the mathematical solution of this game. The Belgian mathema= the tician L. Kraychik tried to calculate, at least approximate4 possible number of variations. This number amounts to 2.1o].140. The chess-amateurs must not get excited; if the whole population of the world would continuously -lay chess and make a move each second, not less than loloo centuries would be necessary for play= ing the whole lot of variations. The 6ame of the automaton is based on a regulating system permitting to make in every situation the better or the correct move. But there are alsso games the issue of which depends merely on a chance, e. g. roulette and lotto. In this case both men and machine must reply at random. Goncluding, we want to mention a game in which the machine - what is amazing - proved to be the stronger adversary. This game is based upon a random misleading of the partner in which case the chances to win are fifty-fifty. The machine, however, discovered unconscious rules Card 2/3 governing the questioning by men, and won. Wbat is the purpose of a- ~ -.- Mathematical mirrors. IUn.tekh. 3 no.9:68-74 S 158.

(Mozhet li '1dumayushcbayi!'mashina reshit' Iyubuyu zadachu?) PERIODICAL: Tekhnika molodezhi, 1959, Nr 49 PP 8-9 (USSR) ABSTRACT. Referring to the automatic computer suggested by the British mathematician A. Tlyuring in 1937, the author tries to demon- strate the possibilitiEsof a \"thinking\" machine. In general, that machine is qualified to solve automatically any problem. For this purpose the machine only requires a program-table, i.e. an \"algorithm\". It is true that it can neither operate with fraction numbers nor with negative quantities, but on the other hand the solution of the most intricate problems is virtually reduced to the execution of uniform and mcst simple operations. The combination of several simple proceedings shows the ways and means for automatizing the spiritual work of man. This machine is apt to solve highly diffictilt calculatory problems, to translate from one language into another, to play chess, draughts, dominoes, and to find a way out of a labyrinth. It has never been tried to construct the Card 112 machine of Tlyuring because it is very primitive and slow. ,Is a \"Thinking\" Machine Capable of SOV/29-59-4-7/26 ,Solving Any Problem? The machine exists only on paper; nevertheless, it is of extraordinarily great theoretical importance, because it demon3trates ad oculoa that any process, however complicated in itself, can be subdivided by means of the algorithm into simple and uniform phases. It proves further that problems for which no algorithm can be established, cannot be solved, neither now nor in the future, not even by the most perfect electronic machines. Such problems can only be tackled by the human brain. There are 2 figures. Card 2/2 FEKEIJS, Viktor,, zhurnalist 111--0? What in an engineer? rzobr. i rats. no.W840 38 1,53.

TITLE: Mastor of machinoo PERIODICAL: Tekhni~._a molodezhi, no. 6, 1961, 10-11 TEXT: The author describes the functions of the biomechanical system or more simply the combined effort of man and machine in performing complicated operations. As computers cannot be used to carry out every operation, it has been necessary to find a way of reducing the time required by man's brain an(I the number of movements required to control a machine. Tests and experimeilts have shown that man's movoments are not an essential link in tile biomechanical control systemt since the change in the biocurrents of' the muscles carrying out these movements occurs before any such movement is Com- ple4.-ed. Man can cause the development of biocurrents in his musclea and regulate them without even moving. A signal from the brain alone creates a biocurrent of the required capacity. In 1957, Soviet specialists created a biomanipulator. In the summer of 1960, at the 1st International Congress of the Federation on Automatic \"ontrol, a prosthesis-manipulator was demon- Card 1/12 22366 S/029/61/000/006/002/004 Master of machines D045/D112 strated. rhis bioelectrical systom of control, called the \"iron hand\" for ahort, was described in the journELl \"Tekhnika molodezhi\", no. 4, 195E. The author points out, however, that better, more sensitive and more easily zontrollable manipulators have since been created. These will permit several -mpli eatJon of 1-ated problems of prosthetics to be resolved, such as the cr pliable, artificial limbs with various properties of manipulation. They riii i-eproduce the movements of the various fingers and will be very powerful. The bioelectrical system will have only the function of control. On the other hand, these manipultitor:.,, will be ablo to distinguish botwoon differont degrees of heat, strength etc. The author, in pointing out the advantages of a bioelectric manipulator over a mechanical one, emphasizes the fact that it ~a-n be used over long diot.anceo. The atithor cites a case where a locc- moti~ro i8 nontrollod by a dovioo baood on tho \"iron hand\".

Descriptively speaking, the machine will be controlled by \"unexpressed wishes\". In conclusion, the author emphasizes the tremendous scope of this new field of science, and the modern trend towards full automation of all labor-consuming processes. References are made to Ye.
