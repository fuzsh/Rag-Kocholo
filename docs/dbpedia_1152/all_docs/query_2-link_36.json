Naik, Juzer A. Chakera, Vipul Arora, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nIn the indirect scheme of ICF, a high-Z ablator is used as the inside wall material of the hohlraum cavity. This choice is made because a high-Z plasma is an efficient x-ray convertor, and it offers a high opacity to radiation conduction into the cavity wall. Recently it had been shown that a mixture of two or more high-Z elements can provide a higher opacity than that of any single materials used, and optimum composition was predicted from computer simulations. It is expected that such a wall will provide maximum conversion of absorbed laser energy into soft x-ray radiation. In this paper, we present a comparative experimental study of soft x-ray emission from copper-gold mix-Z planar targets of different atomic compositions irradiated at a laser intensity of ~1013 W/cm2 (λ = 0.532μm). Spectral features of the soft x-ray radiation were recorded using a transmission grating spectrograph. Maximum enhancement in radiation intensity in the spectral region ~ 40 - 120 &angst; was observed for a mix-Z target of atomic composition of Cu 0.57 - Au 0.43. This is in broad agreement with theoretical results of opacity calculations performed for different atomic compositions using a screened hydrogenic average atom model.\n\nExploring 2omega laser-plasma interactions on the HELEN laser system\n\nKevin A. Oades, Mark Stevenson, Gary E. Slark, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nWe report on an extensive series of experiments using 2ω light on a variety of gaseous targets at the HELEN laser facility at AWE. The aims of the experiments were to investigate laser-plasma interactions and hot electron generation for 2ω light, and to test schemes for efficiently producing multi-keV X-rays. The experiments were diagnosed by an extensive suite of optical and x-ray instrumentation, including streaked SRS and SBS spectrographs, hard X-ray and Dante measurements. The targets used to data have been filled with C5H12, CO2 and Kr. These three targets give very different backscatter, including almost no backscatter from the Kr targets, showing that plasma composition can also be used to minimize backscatter losses. These data also indicate that is possible to produce or quench hot electron production by varying the plasma composition, even near quarter critical density.\n\nFeatures of crater formation on a target under the action of powerful laser pulse\n\nAlexander A. Rupasov, E. A. Bolkhovitinov, I. Ya. Doskach, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe results of experimental and theoretical investigations of craters originating in solid targets of different materials when powerful Nd:glass laser pulse irradiates the surface at flux densities in the range of 1010 - 1014 W/cm2 are presented. The experimentally observed dependencies of crater depth and ablated mass on laser pulse energy and target material properties are analyzed employing the theory of shock wave initiation and propagation under the action of the plasma-producing laser beam. From the comparison of the theoretically deduced and experimentally observed dependencies, a simple formula is derived allowing to determine the pressures in the shock wave and in the plasma corona using the measurements for the crater depth and ablated mass.\n\nLaser Fusion Target Physics\n\nHohlraum scaling experiments with 2omega light\n\nKevin A. Oades, Mark Stevenson, Gary E. Slark, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nRecent experiments at the HELEN laser at AWE have focused on investigations into the performance of a series of scaled NOVA halfraum targets. These were varied from scale 1 to scale 0.1, and used a single beam at 0.53 μm to irradiate the target. The aim of these experiments was to investigate performance limitations for higher temperature small hohlraums. Target diagnostics included time-resolved X-ray power measurements, full aperture measurements of stimulated Raman and Brillouin backscatter, and time-integrated soft and hard X-ray spectrographs. Analyses of the results from this campaign are presented with particular emphasis on the conditions present in the smallest scale targets, including comparison with calculated performance.\n\nShort-Pulse Laser Interaction with Matter and Nuclear Processes\n\nEnergetic particle generation and transportation in interaction of ultra-intense laser with foil target\n\nT. Okada, Alexander A. Andreev, S. Toraya, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nAnalysis and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of fast particles produced by a short laser pulse with duration of 40 fs and intensity ≥ 1018 W/cm2 interacting with a foil target are performed. Initially, the plasma density distribution of the foil target has a smooth gradient with the scale-length of plasma density varying across it. The absorbed laser energy is transferred to fast electrons, which interact with the foil and are partially ejected from the foil surface. These electrons produce an electric field that causes an ion beam to be emitted from the foil. We analyze the different mechanisms of ion acceleration in the foil plasma and the influence of density gradient and other laser and plasma parameters on ion acceleration. The angular distributions of the ejected electrons and ions are calculated. The optimum laser-plasma parameters needed to achieve the most highly focused ion beam are analyzed.\n\nX-ray line emission from H-like and He-like ions in magnesium plasma produced by multi-picosecond laser pulses\n\nPrasad A. Naik, Vipul Arora, Riyaz A. Khan, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nWe report a spectroscopic study of x-ray line emission from a magnesium plasma produced by Nd:glass laser pulses of 30 ps (FWHM) duration at a laser intensity of ~ 3 x 1014 Wcm-2. High-resolution x-ray line spectrum was recorded using a crystal spectrograph. Measurements of continuum radiation intensity were also performed for different x-ray filter cutoff energies. A peak electron temperature of ~ 2.4 keV derived from these measurements is in agreement with that calculated from an analytical model describing laser plasma heating in the short pulse regime. The intensity ratio of MgXII 1s-2p, λ = 8.42 &angst; and MgXI 1s2-1s2p, λ = 9.17 &angst; is observed to be much smaller than that calculated from the spectroscopic code RATION. Analytical estimates of ionization equilibrium time for different ionization states in the heated plasma as well as during its expansion using a simple hydrodynamic model can explain this behavior.\n\nNonlinear Processes in Laser Plasma\n\nModification of the coherence properties of a laser beam propagating through a plasma and its consequences for stimulated scattering instabilities\n\nC. Labaune, Hector A. Baldis, H. Bandulet, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe control of coherence is a critical issue for the high-power lasers used in inertial confinement fusion (ICF). The level of coherence is an important parameter for the control of the light intensity distribution as well as the growth rate of parametric instabilities. Over the past few years, experimental and theoretical studies have evidenced the ability of an underdense plasma to reduce the spatial and temporal coherence of an intense laser beam prooagating through it. As any process affecting laser propagation, plasma-induced incoherence appears fundamental because it can impact on parametric instabilities. We present results obtained with the six-beam LULI laser facility, in the nanosecond regime, showing direct evidences of the reduction of spatial and temporal coherence of an initially RPP-smoothed laser beam after propagation through a preformed plasma. Plasma induced incoherence (PII) proceeds from several mechanisms which include self-focusing, filamentation and non-linear coupling between these mechanisms and forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (FSBS). Part of these experiments was dedicated to the understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in PII, as the break up of a single hot spot and the existence of ion acoustic waves having small wave vectors transverse to the interaction beam which are produced in the PII processes. The spatial and temporal characteristics of these waves give a unique access to the influence of PII on stimulated Brillouin and Raman scattering.\n\nHigh-Energy Density Physics, Technology, and Diagnostics\n\nConcepts of Powerful Laser and ICF Reactor\n\nFront-end system of the Luch facility\n\nNikolai N. Rukavishnikov, A. V. Savkin, O. A. Sharov, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nIn 2001 a primary start-up of one channel of the four-channel \"Luch\" facility, a module of 128-channel facility has been realized. The facility intend for inertial confinement fusion. This paper presents the main results of work on creation and start-up of front-end system (FES) of \"Luch\" facility. The pulse of radiation with the energy up to 3 J and regulated pulse shape 1 - 10 ns in a square (36 x 36 mm2) beam was obtained at the output of FES.\n\nConversion of Iskra-5 iodine laser radiation to the second harmonic by large-aperture DKDP crystals\n\nV. I. Annenkov, V. A. Gaidash, N. V. Zhidkov, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe experimental results of \"Iskra-5\" laser operation conversion at the second harmonic. (λ = 657.6 nm) are presented. The experiments were carried out with DKDP crystals of big aperture (size 32 x 33 x 2 cm). The scheme of one channel was upgraded for optimization of second harmonic generation. Maximum conversion efficiency has been achieved for primary laser intensity of 1 - 2 GW/cm2. A second harmonic output of 500 J has been obtained at 60% of technical efficiency.\n\nProblems of Physics and Chemistry of ICF Targets Fabrication Technology\n\nStudy of properties and preparation conditions of plasmochemical SiO2 films\n\nV. M. Izgorodin, Yu. V. Tolokonnikova, A. A. Aushev, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe results of research of properties and preparation conditions of the plasmochemical SiO2 films are submitted. These films coated various substrates (glass, metals, NaCl). Film deposition was carried out by decomposition of the tetraethoxycilane vapor by the electrical discharge with the frequency of about 18 kHz. The excessive products of decomposition were pumped out with maintenance of the tetraethoxycilane vapor and argon pressure of about 0.2 Torr. The study of element structure has shown that the film represents SixOy with x ≈ 1 and y ≈ 2 and contains an impurity of organic inclusions. Density and index of refraction of a coating are close to these parameters for glass SiO2. The form of the film surface is investigated depending on the coating conditions. Infrared spectra of absorption and Raman spectra are investigated. The results of attempts of the iodine in this film as an impurity are given. This method is applied for preparing of the covering with uniform thickness on glass microspheres used as targets in laser fusion experiments on the installation \"Iskra-5.\"\n\nResearch of D-T mixture molecular composition kinetics in laser thermonuclear fusion targets by Raman spectroscopy\n\nV. M. Izgorodin, A. P. Pepelyaev, E. U. Solomatina\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe first experiment results on investigation of molecular composition kinetics in D-T mixture depending on temperature by means of Raman spectroscopy are given. The D-T mixture is contained within the glass microspheres used as laser thermonuclear fusion (LTF) targets. It is experimentally shown that the isotope molecules concentrations do not change with rapid temperature alteration from 4 - 77 K to room temperature. Two suppositions can explain the results: either the equilibrium concentration establishment time was less 5 minutes or molecule concentration is equal to the high temperature equilibrium concentration regardless of microspheres temperature.\n\nMechanism of formation of a smooth solid layer of hydrogen inside a microshell\n\nElena R. Koresheva, Anton A. Tonshin, Igor E. Osipov, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nEarlier we have proposed and demonstrated a mechanism of formation of a smooth thermo stable glassy solid layer of hydrogen inside a microshell based on introduction of minor dopes into the fuel (so called minor dopes technique or MD-technique). This paper offers a more detailed overview and optimization of the method. The object under consideration is a microshell of ~1 mm dia filled with gaseous hydrogen H2 and a minor dope of HD; density of H2 is less than its critical density (30 kg/m3). It is found that for glassy structure formation it is necessary to maintain uniform dope distribution in the hydrogen volume during the layering process. The calculations have shown that this is achieved by (a) implementation of the drop condensation mode within the time period of t < 0.1 - 0.2 sec, and (b) solidification of the liquid phase within the time period of t < 10 sec. The results of calculations are confirmed by relevant experimental research work. Further model development involves research of specific features of formation of the glassy layer of D2-fuel with minor dopes of HD or DT as well as analysis of the potential use of MD-technique for larger fuel quantities (IFE target)."
