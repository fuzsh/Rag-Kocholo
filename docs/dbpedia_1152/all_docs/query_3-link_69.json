        "text": "Yaacobi, Gad (b. Jan. 18, 1935, Kfar Vitkin, Palestine [now in Israel] - d. Aug. 27, 2007, Toronto, Ont.), Israeli politician. He was minister of transport (1974-77), economics and inter-ministry coordination (1984), economics and planning (1984-88), and communications (1987-90) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1992-96).\n\nYabou, Lang (b. Jan. 10, 1970, Bambako, The Gambia), Gambian diplomat. He was ambassador to Spain, Italy, Greece, and Portugal (2013-18) and Malta (2015-18) and permanent representative to the United Nations (2018-22).\n\nYacouba\n\nA. Yadav\n\nYacouba, Ibrahim, also spelled Yacoubou (b. Aug. 8, 1971), foreign minister of Niger (2016-18). He was also minister of transport and civil aviation (2012-13) and a presidential candidate (2020).\n\nYacoubou, Adam Fassassi (b. 1951?), Beninese politician. He was minister of trade and tourism (1993-95) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1996-99).\n\nYadav, Akhilesh (b. July 1, 1973, Saifai, Etawah district, Uttar Pradesh, India), chief minister of Uttar Pradesh (2012-17); son of Mulayam Singh Yadav.\n\nL.P. Yadav\n\nYadav, Laloo Prasad (b. June 11, 1948, Phulwara, Gopalganj district, Bihar, India), chief minister of Bihar (1990-97). He rose to fame when he was jailed in June 1975 by the government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA). He named his eldest daughter Misa in memory of his detention. Yadav was then a key member of a student movement led by Jayaprakash Narayan, a social activist. When he was freed in 1977, Yadav became a lower-house lawmaker in the federal parliament. Newspapers then noted he did not have enough money to buy himself a train ticket to New Delhi. As a member of a socialist movement spearheading job quotas in government for lower Hindu castes, Yadav, who belonged to a backward community of cowherds, rose to prominence in the then Janata Party, which split several times later. For two decades, he reigned as a low-caste radical riding a modern democratic system to defy a centuries-old Hindu hierarchy. In 1990, he rode to power as the chief minister of the eastern Indian state of Bihar on the crest of a huge wave of low-caste support. In 1997 he faced a leadership challenge from fellow caste man Sharad Yadav in the party's presidential elections. On July 5, Laloo Yadav formed the breakaway Rashtriya Janata Dal, saying there had been irregularities in the party poll in which Sharad Yadav emerged winner. Around the same time, the federal police closed in on him in the \"fodder\" scandal case involving the suspected embezzlement of animal welfare funds. Yadav, who said he was innocent, finally resigned on July 25 as federal police received a court warrant to arrest him in the $280 million scandal. Even as he quit, he angered critics by naming his politically inexperienced wife, Rabri Devi, as his successor. In 2013 he was sentenced to five years in prison, a ruling that automatically took away his membership of parliament, where he had been a familiar face, occupying one of the front benches and serving as minister of railways in 2004-09.\n\nM. Yadav\n\nM.S. Yadav\n\nYadav, Mohan (b. March 25, 1965, Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, India), chief minister of Madhya Pradesh (2023- ).\n\nYadav, Mulayam Singh (b.

Feb. 17, 1948, near Sana, Yemen), imam of Yemen (1904-48). He succeeded his father as imam of Yemen, which was then a province of the Ottoman Empire, in 1904 and thus also became religious head of the Zaydi sect of Shi`i Muslims. He assembled a military force to fight Turkish rule, but made peace in 1911, when the autonomy of his personal rule over the Yemen was recognized, and remained loyal to the sultan until 1918, although he took no active part in World War I. After the Turkish collapse, he became embroiled with Britain; he rejected the Anglo-Turkish boundary delimitation of 1902-04, and he occupied and advanced historical claims to part of the Western Aden Protectorate. He recovered al-Hudaydah and other ports from Asir (1925) but was evicted from the Aden Protectorate in 1928. An Anglo-Yemeni treaty of February 1934 emboldened him to precipitate war with Saudi Arabia. After summary defeat, he received a generous treaty (May 1934). Although he signed diplomatic agreements with Italy, the U.S.S.R., the Netherlands, France, and the United States, he forbade resident diplomats. He welcomed Italian, Soviet, and British medical missions, however. When he reorganized and centralized his government, he employed some Arab, European, and American advisers. He remained neutral in World War II. Under his guidance Yemen joined the Arab League (1945) and the United Nations (1947). Discontent with his isolationist autocracy resulted in active opposition from 1946, and in 1948, when he was on the way to his estate outside the capital, he was intercepted by an unknown car and shot by a machine gun. After a brief civil war, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Ahmad.\n\nYahya Ibrahim Pasha (b. 1861 - d. 1936), prime minister (1923-24) and finance minister (1925-26) of Egypt. He was also minister of justice (1919-20) and education (1922-23).\n\nYahya Khan\n\nYahya Khan, Agha Mohammad (b. Feb. 4, 1917, near Peshawar, India [now in Pakistan] - d. Aug. 9, 1980, Rawalpindi, Pakistan), president of Pakistan (1969-71). He graduated first in his class from the Indian Military Academy at Dehra Dun, served in the Middle East and Italy during World War II, and, after India was partitioned in 1947, organized the Pakistani Staff College. He fought in the war with India over Kashmir and became Pakistan's youngest brigadier general at 34, youngest general at 40, and, in 1966, youngest commander in chief at 49. When street riots took hundreds of lives in 1969, Pres. Mohammad Ayub Khan called on his protégé Yahya to take over the government. Declaring martial law within minutes of Ayub's resignation, Yahya said, \"I will not tolerate disorder. Let everyone return to his post.\" He was credited with stopping the disorders, and in the next two years business monopolies were curbed, charges of corruption were lodged against hundreds of former officials, minimum wages were raised, and spending for education and development increased. He proclaimed his hope of returning to his military career and, to that end, organized free elections in December 1970. These exacerbated divisions between dominant West Pakistan and long-neglected East Pakistan. The Awami Party, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, swept the elections in East Pakistan and promptly demanded autonomy. Civil war erupted, East Pakistan declared independence as Bangladesh, and when India intervened in December 1971 Bangladeshi nationhood was assured. With this loss Yahya resigned. He was put under house arrest by his successor, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, but was paralyzed by a stroke shortly afterward and later released.\n\nYahyaoui, Khaled, acting interior minister of Tunisia (2021).\n\nYaïche, (Mohamed) Nizar (b. 1975), finance minister of Tunisia (2020).\n\nYaka, John (d.

Feb. 1, 1922, Odawara, Japan), prime minister of Japan (1889-91, 1898-1900). Swept into the currents of revolutionary loyalism to the emperor that followed the growth of foreign influence under the shogunate, he emerged from the Meiji Restoration of 1868 as a leader of the semimodern militia of the Choshu region, the Kiheitai. As vice minister of military affairs from 1871 and later army minister and from 1878 chief of the general staff, he took a leading part in the introduction of the conscription system (1873) and of the Prussian general staff system (1878). As home minister (1883-89) he set up the central police system and perfected central control over local government. He was created a count in 1884. In 1889 he became the first prime minister under the newly established parliamentary system. After resigning in 1891, he served as minister of justice (1892-93) and president of the Privy Council (1893). He was for a time commander of the 1st army in Korea during the Chinese-Japanese War of 1894-95 and was created marquess in 1895 and promoted to field marshal in 1898. During his second premiership he accelerated the expansionist policy in Asia. He was again chief of staff during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and in 1907 was awarded the title of prince for his distinguished service. He was the most honoured and respected member of the group of elder statesmen known as genro, especially after Hirobumi Ito's assassination in 1909. He was president of the Privy Council again in 1905-09 and from 1909 until his death. In addition to an important advisory role in foreign affairs, he virtually controlled the selection of prime ministers. However, when he meddled in the crown prince's marriage in 1921 he was publicly censured.\n\nYamagata, Isaburo, in full (from 1922) Koshaku (Duke, or Prince) Isaburo Yamagata (b. Feb. 6, 1858 [Dec. 23, 1857, lunar calendar] - d. Sept. 24, 1927), governor of Kwantung (1920-22); nephew and adopted son of Aritomo Yamagata. He was also governor of Tokushima (1896-99) and Mie (1899), Japanese minister of communications (1906-08), and administrative superintendent of Korea (1910-19).\n\nYamaguchi, Kikuichiro (b. May 11, 1897, Sasebo, Nagasaki prefecture, Japan - d. May 6, 1981), Japanese politician. He was director-general of the Hokkaido Development Agency and the Administrative Management Agency (1958-59) and speaker of the House of Representatives (1965-66).\n\nYamaguchi, Yoshinori (b. July 1, 1965), governor of Saga (2015- ).\n\nYamamoto, Gonnohyoe, in full Hakushaku (Count) Gonnohyoe Yamamoto, also called Gombei Yamamoto (b. Nov. 26, 1852, Kagoshima, Japan - d. Dec. 8, 1933, Tokyo, Japan), prime minister of Japan (1913-14, 1923-24). Following the custom by which the clans of Satsuma and Choshu devoted themselves to the navy and army respectively, he entered the navy and by 1896 was a vice admiral, becoming a full admiral in 1904, while he was minister of the navy (1898-1906). In 1913 he became prime minister as a compromise candidate, when the old oligarchs blocked Takashi Hara, head of the dominant political party, from assuming the post. During his premiership, legislation was passed to further the influence of the political parties, the civil-service appointment system was reformed, and Japan became involved on the Chinese mainland, demanding and receiving new railway rights in Manchuria. When naval officers were found to have taken bribes from contractors in 1914, popular anger compelled him to resign, although there was no suggestion that he was personally involved. He then took no part in politics until becoming prime minister again in 1923, heading what was called the \"Earthquake Cabinet.\" Its first meeting took place in the open air, in the midst of the smoking ruins made by the devastating earthquake of September 1, and it had to take immediate measures to relieve the unprecedented situation. On Dec. 29, 1923, the Yamamoto cabinet resigned because of an attempt on the life of the prince regent, Hirohito. He then went into retirement again. He was created a baron in 1902 and a count in 1907 and was also decorated with the G.C.M.G. by Great Britain in 1907. One of the strong men of the Satsuma clan, he was regarded as a brilliant statesman of the old school, but he was never popular like Adm. Heihachiro Togo.\n\nYamamoto, Ichita (b. Jan. 24, 1958), governor of Gunma (2019- ).\n\nIsoroku Yamamoto\n\nYamamoto, Isoroku, original name (before adoption) Isoroku Takano (b. April 4, 1884, Nagaoka, Japan - d. April 18, 1943, Shortland Islands, Solomon Islands), Japanese naval officer. He graduated from the naval academy in 1904 and fought as an ensign in the Russo-Japanese War. He was naval attaché at the Japanese embassy in Washington, D.C., during 1926-27. He became vice minister of the Japanese navy in 1936, commander of the First Fleet in 1938, and commander in chief of Japan's Combined Fleet in August 1941. He opposed war with the United States because he feared Japan would lose a protracted struggle with such a powerful opponent. Once the decision to go to war was made, however, he asserted that Japan's only chance for victory lay in a surprise attack that would cripple the American naval forces in the Pacific, after which Japan could seize the rich lands of Southeast Asia and move eastward across the Pacific unopposed. His plan for a carrier-based air strike on Pearl Harbor was adopted by the naval general staff, but meanwhile he was predicting that, if the war with the U.S. lasted more than one year, Japan would eventually be defeated. After the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor (Dec. 7, 1941), Yamamoto sought a decisive battle with what remained of the United States' Pacific forces, namely, its aircraft carriers. But the resulting battle, at Midway Island (June 1942), was won by the Americans. Yamamoto's ensuing campaign in the Solomon Islands was also less than successful. His death resulted when U.S. forces, having broken the Japanese communication codes, knew his whereabouts and ambushed and shot down his plane over the Solomons. He was posthumously given the title of fleet admiral.\n\nYamamoto, Sachio (b. Feb. 26, 1911, Mie prefecture, Japan - d.

In 1889 he entered the Bank of Japan of which he was appointed director and then governor (1898-1903). He was made a crown member of the House of Peers in 1903 and became minister of finance (1911-12) and of agriculture and commerce (1913-14, 1918-22). He was created baron in 1920. In 1924 he seceded from the Seiyukai party and established a new party, Seiyuhonto, with Takejiro Tokonami as leader, becoming himself the adviser to the party. When the Kenseikai and the Seiyuhonto parties united to form the Minseito in 1927, he became the adviser to the new party. In 1932-34 he was home affairs minister.\n\nYamanaka, Sadanori (b.

Yamani\n\nYamani, Ahmad Zaki (b. July 2, 1930, Mecca, Hejaz [now in Saudi Arabia] - d. Feb. 23, 2021, London, England), Saudi Arabian oil minister (1962-86). He first entered government in Saudi Arabia as legal adviser to the Council of Ministers in 1958-60. On the dismissal of Abdullah Tariki, the kingdom's first oil minister, Yamani in March 1962 became King Faisal's chief spokesman on oil policy and a director of the national oil company, Aramco. In the climactic talks in Tehran in January-February 1971 that broke the power of the oil industry, Yamani emerged as the most subtle and persuasive tactician of the OPEC camp. Wrapped in his gold-threaded black bishla, he symbolized the popular image of the Arab oil sheikh, although in fact he was more of a servant to King Faysal than a policy maker, as he was also to be to King Khalid and his successor, King Fahd. Yamani was the first to suggest that the Arabs might use oil as a weapon against countries supporting Israel. By contrast with this stand during 1971-74, he later became a voice for moderation on oil price increases by OPEC. He was aware at an early stage, when an oil revenue surplus began to pile up after 1974, that the health of the Saudi government depended on maintaining the strength of the U.S. economy. Yamani was present at the assassination of King Faysal in March 1975 and was briefly kidnapped by international terrorists in December of that year during the OPEC ministers' meeting in Vienna. He later recalled that he was so frightened that he began reciting verses from the Qur´an. In October 1986 he was suddenly dismissed.\n\nK. al-Yamani\n\nYamani, Khaled (Hussein) al-, al-Yamani also spelled Alyemany (b. 1960), foreign minister of Yemen (2018-19; Hadi government).

During his subsequent diplomatic career he also served as envoy to Washington (1932-33) and Moscow (1933-36). In 1933, as chief Chinese delegate at the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, he initiated the charge of aggression against Japan that resulted in League censure and Japan's withdrawal from the League.

He was born in Kazakhstan, where the entire Chechen population had been deported eight years before by Soviet ruler Iosif Stalin, who said they might conspire with Hitler's invading armies. He returned to Chechnya with his family after Stalin died. He ran foul of Soviet authorities at an early age, helping to form a literary association called \"Pkharmat\" which was shut down by the KGB for alleged nationalist tendencies in 1979.

Fulgencio Batista's army to poison Fidel Castro when the future Cuban leader was jailed in 1953-55 after he and his followers launched a disastrous attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago. Later, Yánez joined the rebel forces and after the revolution in 1959, served as one of Castro's bodyguards. On Castro's first trip to the United States as Cuba's new prime minister, Yánez accompanied him and can be seen in black-and-white photographs of Castro's meeting with Vice Pres. Richard Nixon.

A Russian speaker, he joined three delegations to Moscow from 1957 to 1963 before the ideological rift between the two Communist giants widened. Radical Red Guards accused him of conspiring against Chairman Mao Zedong and purged him at the outset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. Accused of tapping the Great Helmsman's telephone, he was lampooned in wall posters wearing earphones and listening to Mao's conversations. His penalty was a harrowing mass \"struggle session\" at a Beijing rally and 12 years of political exile. In 1978, the year Deng Xiaoping began to consolidate power, Yang was rehabilitated and became deputy governor of Guangdong province in southern China. He continued to move up the hierarchy, becoming one of the 17 members of the policy-making party Politburo in 1982. In 1983 he became Deng's right-hand military man with the rank of general.

Leonid Kuchma appointed him prime minister in 2002, in a government accused of corruption and economic mismanagement. As the outgoing leader's protégé, he went on to win the 2004 presidential vote. But after huge protests in Kiev that became known as the Orange Revolution, the election was declared fraudulent, badly denting his reputation; in a repeat runoff he was soundly defeated by Viktor Yushchenko. He rebuilt his political career while the victors of 2004, Yushchenko and Yuliya Tymoshenko, fell into constant conflict. He served a second term as prime minister and became Ukraine's most popular politician. The 2010 presidential election he won cleanly - according to international observers - defeating arch-rival Tymoshenko. The following year, she was jailed for seven years on charges of abusing power, in a trial she insisted was politically motivated. Yanukovych tried hard to shed the image of being \"Moscow's man\" (he had been openly supported by Russia in 2004) and when he became president he pointedly made his first foreign trip in that capacity to Brussels rather than Moscow. He steered Ukraine towards a closer relationship with the European Union, but then, days before it was due to be signed, he rejected an association agreement in November 2013. Street protests, the biggest since the 2004 Orange Revolution, erupted and continued for months, reaching a bloody climax on Feb. 18-22, 2014, when about 100 people died, most of them protesters shot dead by uniformed snipers. Under EU pressure he signed a deal to transfer powers to parliament and hold early elections. But within hours he fled to Russia and his administration crumbled. As Ukraine's protest leaders and opposition moved to fill the power vacuum, he maintained he was still the lawfully elected president, saying he fled in fear of life. The new rulers issued an arrest warrant for his role in the \"mass murder of innocent civilians.\" A trial in absentia for high treason began in 2017; he was found guilty in 2019.\n\nYaqub, Mustafa (Ahmad), foreign minister of Yemen (Sana) (1963-64, 1965-66).

May 3, 1951, Zassovskaya, Krasnodar kray, Russian S.F.S.R. - d. April 25, 1997, Moscow, Russia), Russian politician. In 1992, he became head of the administration of Krasnodar kray. In 1994, Pres. Boris Yeltsin made him minister in charge of nationalities and regional policy. He was promoted to deputy prime minister and given responsibility for the breakaway region of Chechnya. He thus was in Yeltsin's hardline inner circle, dubbed the \"party of war,\" that endorsed sending troops to crush the tiny southern republic's self-proclaimed independence. The 20-month war was a disaster for Moscow almost from the start, and the hawkish Yegorov was blamed for the failed policies that culminated in a military conflict. He was removed as nationalities minister in early 1995. In June, he was fired as deputy prime minister, among three high-ranking officials to lose their jobs for the botched handling of an incident in which Chechen rebels took 2,000 civilians hostage in a hospital. More than 100 people died as a result of the hostage-taking in the southern Russian city of Budyonnovsk. Yegorov subsequently became an adviser to Yeltsin and was appointed in 1996 as head of the presidential administration. He was dismissed later and returned to his old job as head of the Krasnodar region in the summer. In running to retain his post, he was routed (57%-25%) in October by Communist candidate Nikolay Kondratenko. But the election was annulled on the ground that turnout was below 50%. The legislature then lowered the minimum turnout level to 25%, and the kray electoral commission called a new election for December. Yegorov earned the dubious distinction of becoming the incumbent to lose by the largest margin, winning 4.8% of the vote to about 82% for Kondratenko.\n\nYegorov, Sergey (Nikolayevich) (b.

April 15 [April 5, O.S.], 1684 - d. May 17 [May 6, O.S.], 1727, St. Petersburg, Russia), empress of Russia (1725-27); wife of Pyotr I.\n\nYekaterina II, in full Yekaterina Alekseyevna, byname Yekaterina Velikaya, English Catherine II, or Catherine the Great, original name Sophie Auguste Friederike Prinzessin von Anhalt-Zerbst (b. May 2, 1729, Stettin, Prussia [now Szczecin, Poland] - d. Nov. 17 [Nov. 6, O.S.], 1796, Tsarskoye Selo [now Pushkin, part of St. Petersburg], Russia), empress of Russia (1762-96). The daughter of Christian August of Anhalt-Zerbst, she married Grand Duke Pyotr, heir to the Russian throne, in 1745 but also became notorious for her love affairs with Graf Grigory Orlov and with Stanislaw August Poniatowski (whom she later made king of Poland). After her husband's accession as Pyotr III in 1762, Yekaterina was compelled to live separately; later that year Pyotr was dethroned by a conspiracy in which she was probably implicated, and she herself was made empress despite a weak claim to the throne. A few days afterwards Pyotr was murdered by Orlov and others. Around this time Yekaterina began to make a show of regard for the Orthodox church, although her principles were those of the French philosophers like Voltaire. In 1767 she drew up an Instruction to serve as a guide for an enlightened code of laws, but it came to nothing and thereafter she put more emphasis on national grandeur. When discontent was voiced, the young Prince Ivan, the hope of the disaffected, was murdered in the castle of Shlisselburg. In 1774 she suppressed a popular rebellion led by Yemelyan Pugachev, defeating his Cossack troops at Tsaritsyn. She sought the support of the nobility in Russia, and promoted their cause by establishing them as a separate estate by charter in 1785. Under Yekaterina, internal politics consisted of court intrigues both for and against a succession of favourites, Grigory Potyomkin being the best-known. Three partitions of Poland (1772, 1793, 1795), two Turkish wars (1768-74, 1787-91), and a war with Sweden (1788-90) vastly increased the empire.\n\nYekhanurov\n\nYekhanurov, Yuriy (Ivanovych) (b.

Feb. 1, 1931, Butka, Sverdlovsk oblast, Russian S.F.S.R. - d. April 23, 2007, Moscow, Russia), president of Russia (1991-99). He joined the Communist Party in 1961. In 1976 he became first secretary of the Sverdlovsk oblast party committee. His career really took off after Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985. He was named first secretary of the Moscow city party committee and in 1986 was elevated to the Politburo as a non-voting member. An estrangement between himself and Gorbachev set in when Yeltsin began criticizing the slow pace of reform at party meetings. He was forced to resign from the Moscow party leadership in 1987 and from the Politburo in 1988 and became a deputy minister for construction. He staged a remarkable comeback when he won a multicandidate election to the new U.S.S.R. Congress of People's Deputies in 1989 and in May 1990 the parliament of the Russian S.F.S.R. elected him president of the Russian republic. In July 1990 he quit the Communist Party. He won the first popular elections for the Russian presidency in June 1991. In August, as hardline Communists were attempting to stage a coup against Gorbachev, Yeltsin called on the population to resist. The coup collapsed after a few days; thereafter he eclipsed Gorbachev as the country's most powerful political figure, and the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December. In 1993 he unconstitutionally dissolved the legislature, which resisted and voted to depose him but was suppressed by army troops loyal to Yeltsin. In 1994 he sent troops into breakaway Chechnya, and the war eroded his already declining popularity. Nevertheless, he won reelection over Communist challenger Gennady Zyuganov in 1996. Overall, his presidency was marked by economic meltdown, soaring crime, and a massive drop in life expectancy. He resigned abruptly on Dec. 31, 1999.\n\nYem Sambaur (b.

Oct. 30, 2020, Istanbul), prime minister of Turkey (1991, 1996, 1997-99). He entered parliament in 1983 after three years of army rule that cracked down on extremist political violence. He was minister of culture and tourism (1986-87) and foreign minister (1987-90) and led the country as prime minister for three months in 1991 until his Motherland Party was defeated in a general election by the True Path Party, then led by Süleyman Demirel who became president in May 1993 and left his post to Tansu Çiller. The two conservative parties were close on policy but the leaders were poles apart. Çiller was a dramatic, instinctive political survivor, and Yilmaz more measured and thoughtful. Their rivalry defined Yilmaz's career. He spent many years - largely unsuccessfully - attempting to frustrate Çiller and pin corruption charges on her. Yilmaz took control of Motherland in April 1993 after the sudden death of its founder Turgut Özal. In 1996 he was again prime minister for a short period. He came to power a third time in 1997 at the head of a secularist alliance cobbled together to replace an Islamist-led coalition that collapsed under pressure from the powerful military. He came out of his shell in this period in office, but some of his more fiery rhetoric hindered Turkey's decades-old efforts to come closer to the European Union. He upset Italy with strong comments in a row over Turkish Kurd rebel chief Abdullah Öcalan, who was seeking asylum in Italy, and enraged Germany by comparing its policy on the European Union's eastward expansion with Adolf Hitler's Lebensraum campaign of conquest in eastern Europe. His coalition presided over a crackdown on political Islam. He also tried, with some success, to carve out a reputation for fiscal prudence. He was toppled by a parliamentary censure vote in 1998. Remaining party leader until 2003, he was a deputy prime minister in 2000-02.\n\nYim Chhay Ly (b. Jan. 1, 1950), a deputy prime minister of Cambodia (2008-23).\n\nYin Changheng (b. 1884, "
