Yushakov: \"U.S. Defense Department Joint Co~munications System\"] [Excerpts] The Pentagon is placing reliance on waging war using mass destruction weapons and is attempting to create a system for control of staffs and troops scattered acr~ss the entire globe which would permit providing to them orders and instructions for unleashing aggressive actions - or shifting them to a higher degree af combat readiness in short periods of ~ time(pr.actically in real time). The primary problPm here is considered to ~ be the increase in survivability, reliability and flexibility of control of the armed forces on the part of the supreme national military-political leadership. An important role in resolving this problem is given to communications forces and facilities, and primarily those belonging to the joint communi- cations system of the U.S. Defense Department, the DCS (Defense Communica- tions System), which takes in practically all points on the globe where American headquarters and troops are located. It is primarily intended for pr~viding communications for the supreme national mi.litary-political leadership (the president, secretary of defense and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), joint and special commands, and the main directorates of the Defense Department. As reported by the foreign press, 15-20 percent of - DCS channels are used in the interests of a global system of operational control, while some of them are assigned for transmission of intelligence and data on ar.'enemy nuclear missile attack. The DCS system makes wide use of all the primary forms of communications: radio, radio-relay, tropospheric, wire, cable and satellite. The Defense Communications Agency is responsibie for its organization and normal func- tioning. _ Zonal communications agencies also have been set up at the headquarters of main command elements of U.S. Armed Forces in Europe, in the Pacific, and with the joint North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) for providing ~ 3 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY instructions of the military leadership more rapidly. Several regional divis~ons are subordinate to each of them. Their primary mission is to provide reliable and uninterrupted aperation of communications systems 3nd facilities in their own \"zones (regions) of responsibility.\" The opera- t~tons center of the Defense Communications Agency exercises immediate control througti operations centers of zc?nal communications agencies and regional communicat~~n~ divisions. There axe over 130 primary and alternate relay centers in the DCS, some of which are outfitted with automatic switching gear. The overall length of ` cable, wire, radio-relay, tropospheric and satellite communications lines is 67 million channel-kilometers. They connect ov2r 3,000 control points scattered across the entire globe. The foreign press emphasizes that the aggressive war of tha United States in Vietnam, where a number of essential shortcomings were revealed, served as impetus for accelerated development of communications in the higher echelon of comimand and control of the armed forces. The national military- political leadership demanded that the Pentagon achieve that operating status of communications systems and facilities in wtiich data would pass from t~p to bottom and vice versa in real time or near real time. Foreign specialists identify the following important directions in development of U.S, communications systems in recent years: a broad introduction of new satellite systems (military and leased from other departments), special DV [long wave] and SDV [ultra-long wave] communications systems and encipher- ment gear; further automation of digital communications systems; and an increase in their noise stability. . The primary components of the presently existirg DCS are the AUTOVON, AUTODIN, and AUTOSEVOCOM automated communications systems and the DSCS-2 strategic satellite communications system. In addition, the DCS includes long-range communications centers and equipment belonging to branches of the Armed Forces and channels leased from private companies by the Defense Department. In 1978 there were up to 150 different control points among the system's subscribers, of which around 40 were part of the GSOU [global operational ` control systemj, 20 in the Navy and the rest in the Army, Air Force and Marines~ At the present time the system is in the next phase of development (DSCS-3), which will last until 1982. When it is fully deployed, four primary earth satellites and two alternate satellites are to be activated as a s~ace element. The operating frequency range is 7-8 GHz. Each satellite provides communications over four trunks (1,300 telephone channels each). In case the American satellites are disabled, the system can operate through commu- nications satellites.of the NATO and British systems.

Of these, 80 will be part of\" GSOU, 40-50 for the Navy, 300 for the Army, Air Force and Marines, and the` rest for the Diplomatic Service. Other satellite communications systems functioning in the interests of the Defense Department's DCS are the AFSATCOM and FLTSATCOM. In contrast t'o'~the DSCS, they operate in the 225-40G MHz band and have considerably fewer channels (several dozen). The foreign press emphasizes that the U.S. Defense Department joint communi- cations system basic311y supports the needs of the armed forces and the ~ supreme national military-political leadership even at the present time. 47ith the final introduction of the AFSATCOM and FLTSATCOM satellite systems, the capabilities will expand considerably, especially with regard to instructions provided to strategic offensive forces. In the assessment of American military specialists, the presence of several global, autonomous communications systems considerably increases the survivability, reliability and flexibility of the armed forces command and control system or its individual components and permits providing the necessary instructions and directions of the supreme military command to headquarters (control points of separate commands) and large and small units in real time or near real time. All this shows once again that the forces of imperialism are preparing actively to conduct war in different parts of the world.

Fokin: \"Security of Nuclear Weapons Storage Facilities\"J - [Text] Militaristic circles in the West are unwinding the arms race spiral more and more strongly. Appropriations for militar~ purposes grow with each passing year, the development of military sectors of industry is being forced, and stockpiles of mass destruction weapons are building up. According zo estimates by foreign military specialists, there already are over 30,000 weapons in the U.S. nuclear arsenal, of which around 7,000 are located in the zone of the aggressive NATO bloc in Europe and over 1,000 at American military bases in the Pacific area. There are tentatively up to 1,500 different installations for the storage and accommodation of American nuclear weapons in various parts of the globe, of which over 100 are in Europe and around 130 on U.S. territory (Fig. 11 [Figure not reproduced]. Broa3 layers of world public opinion, including American public opinion, ~are being alarmed by the scorn shown by militarists of the United States and NATO allies toward demanris for banning the production and stockpiling of mass destruction weapons. Facts of the recent past indicate that the irresponsible attitude toward sucr problems abroad more than once has threatened the lives of many thousands of people. For example, that was the case in 1966 in Spain and in 1968 in Greenland, when strategic B-52 bombers with.nuclear bombs aboard suffered catastrophes over their terri- tories. In the estimate of foreign observers, the total npmber of such instances is over ten. The foreign press reported results of a 1973 check of the status of security of American nuclear weapons storage facilities in Europe. The official report of the inspection group sent to the U.S.\"Secretary of Defense stated that some of them did not have the appropriate security, were kept in poorly equipped facilities and, in addition, requirements of the checkpoint conditions and rules for security of the facilities were violated: Ei ' FOR OF~'ICIAL USE ONLY . . . . . . , , _ . .

In particular, military storehouses for special kinds of weapons are being out- _ fitted with special security equipment. It was reported that at the present time such equipment has been installed in 50 Air Force installations, including nuclear weapons storage facilities, air bases for B-52 strategic bombers, and airfields for American tactical air duty subunits located in.. Europe and the Pacific. In addition, in 1980 it is planned to outfit still another SO installations with more sophisticated security equipment, and in 1982 to begin deploying an automated security system being developed under the BISS (Base and Installation Security System) program. It represents a s~phisticated electronic system which includes an electronic computer, security signalling devices, television and illumination equipment, employee identification instruments (Fig. 2) [Figure not reproduced] and so on. The coinposition and acr.ommodation of this system at a nuclear weapons storage facility is shown in Fig. 3[Figure not reproduced]. - Along with the introduction of this equipment, the U.S. Defense Department planned the reorganization of the nuclear weapons storage facility security service in 1978-1979 and a simultaneous increase in the size of its units to 20,000 persons, providing them with more sophisticated small arms, , armored vests and other gear. By carrying out these measures, the American command is attempting to pre- vent a sudden surprise seizure of nuclear weapons by the enemy in case of war or by extremist groups of terrorists in peacetime. As noted in the foreign press, stores of special shaped charges of high explosives intended for rapid destruction of weapons have been supplied to all American nuclear weapons storage facilities in Europe. According to a Defense Department directive, around 1 hour is given �or destruction of 25-30 nuclear weapons located in one fixed storage facility. Western military specialists believe that outfitting nuclear weapons with coded security devices known as PAL (Permissive Action Link), intended for preventing~unauthorized detonation, is one further step in increasing the security of American nuclear weapons. This ensures relatively reli- able interlocking of the weapon's main electrical circuits, which can be removed only by two American service personnel authorized to do this, acting in sequence and separatel.y from each other. Another variety of this device is used in some types of munitions, the unlocking of which is done prior to combat use also by two specialists by dialing a prearranged digital combination on a locking device. In addition, measures are being taken under a program f~r checking the reliability of persons working with nuclear weapons. According to foreign press data, considerable contingents of military and civilian specialists are brought in for servicing American nuclear we~T~ns. They undergo a check both before entering service and periodically while performing ~ 7 FOR OFFICIAL L'SF ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY service. If a specialist does not meet the demands placed on the state of health, conduct, social origins or political views, he is not authorized to work on these objects. According to 1972 data, around 14,000 persons were used for various types of work wit h r.uclear weapons in the American ground forces in Europe. During the year 213 of them were disqualified for reason of neuropsycho- logical illnesses, abuse of drugs and alcohol, and for poor performance of official duties, disciplinary infractions and amoral conduct. _ The western press notes that measures being conducted in the United States for the security of nuclear weapons also touch on the sphere of production and stockpiling of special fission materials (plutonium-239, uranium-235 and uranium-233). According to the assessment of foreign specialists, there is an annual loss of approxir.iately 25 kg of plutonium and 45 kg of uranium in the United States because of deficiencies in record keeping, supervision and storage. The possibility is not precluded that such materials will get abroad or will fall into the hands of criminal terrorist groups. In the estimate of foreign scientists and specialists, persons having the ner_essary supplies and connections can prepare their own nuclear weapon from the aforementioned radioactive substances (termed a\"homemade\" or ~ \"crude\" bomb in the United States) and in the absence of such conditions can use it for subversive purposes. The U.S. Defense Department together with the Department of Energy is carrying out a number of supplementary measures to close the channels for loss of fission materials. In particular, they include creation of a special bure au for security of fissionable materials under the Energy Department's Commission on Nuclear Security and Licenses, and the partici- pation of the FBI and CIA in their security and investigation. In assessing the measures being conducted by the U.S. military department - to secure special types of weapons, the foreign press notes that no matter how sophisticated the means being developed, they will not efisure reliable protection o f persons against possible chance happenings. Only cessation of the production of nuclear weapons, a subsequent cut-back in stockpiles and complete elimination of the stockpiles are the real ways for assuring international security and stable peace. The Soviet Union and other coun- tries of the socialist community repeatedly have pointed this out. PHOTO CAPTIONS 1. p. 18. Fig. 1.

Zhukov: \"Remote Mining Systems of NATO Armies\"] [Text] Active work continues in armies of the leading countries partici- pating in the aggressive NATO bloc to create new types of weapons and combat - equipment. Much attention is being given to antitank weapons. Foreign military specialists consider the wide use of minefields laid on probable routes of enemy movement to be very important and effective for maximum limitation to the mobility of highly mobile enemy units. Methods for laying minefields which existed up to the present time were very laborious and required a large number of mine$ and minelaying equipment. In this connection, foreign specialists performed research for a long while to develop new mining systems. As a result they succeeded in creating quali- tatively new equipment which allowed a sharp reduction in laboriousness of - work, a decrease in ~he expenditure uf mines and a reduction of time for laying minefields,, ' The creation of ne:~ antitank mines differing su},stantially from mines of the old, classic type by reduced weight and size ~without reduction in the effi�- cacy by using a charge with a special directional-action shape) also con- tributed to the solution to this problem. The new mines are equipped with - an electronic (influence firing or contact-firing) fuse and are capable of functionin.g under the entire pro~ection of the tank. Because of their small size, these mines are difficult to detect visually and so can be scattered on the surface of the ground. The most effective means for laying mines have been developed simultaneously with the new mines in NATO armies. The small dimensions and use of high- strength, eliably operating electronic and.mechanical components permitted the creati, : of mines capable of withstanding very heavy loads. As a result, use began to be made not only of ground minelayers which scatter mines to distances of several tens of ineters, but also artillery, missile - and air systems. The new equipment, which is designated \"remote mining - 10 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY :y.-.. ..~f...:~_. .

As noted in the Loreign press, these systems should substantially increase troop capabilities for high-speed laying of minefields. It is emphasized that remote minelaying e~Lipment at the cammander's disposal allows him to make more flexible and active use of them during a battle not only on the defensive, but also i:i the offensive. Special attention is given to the fact that, thanks to the extremely compressed time periods for laying obstacles using these systems, there is no longer need for min~laying ahead of time, whicY! usua?ly tied one down previously to terrain conditions (such as mining sectors accessible to tanks). In addition, the remote mining method permits laying mines directly ahead of a moving enemy or directly on his combat formations. Foreign special- ists emphasize that this means that the new minelaying equipment permits ~ action against 3 specific enemy, which should ensure greater effect through the element of surprise. The first models of remote minelaying systems already have been accepted into the inventory of some NATO armies, while a considerabl.e number of systems are in the concluding phase of development, which should be com- pleted in the next two or three years. The basis of remote mining systems in the United States are antitank and - antipersonnel mines being developed under a program for creating a family of remotely laid mines known as FASCAM (Family of Scatterable Mines), and intended for laying by means of ground-based minelayers, tube and rocket artillery, and aircraft. According to American press reports, the mines of this family are characterized by compactness, light weight, and the presence of a self-destruct device by which they self-destruct after a given period of time after being laid on the terrain so as not to hinder the maneuver of friendly forces, and an antidisturbance device which initiates the mine when there is an attempt to move it from its place. American specialists have developed several models of mines which differ slightly among themselves chiefly by the minelaying equipment. The GEMSS (Ground Emplaced Mine Scattering System) is considered to be _ general-purpose. It is intended for ].aying the XM75 antitank mines and tha XM74 antipe~sonnel mines using the XM12$ towed minelayer towed by the M113A1 tracked APC or a 5-ton truck. The XM128 (Fig. 1) [Figure not repro- duced], produced on a modified M794 double-axle trailer, consists of two interchang~able cylindrical cassettes loaded with~ mines and a launcher, by which the mines are thrown from a rail to the sides a distance of a few tens of ineters. As the minelayer moves, mines are scattered in a strip of a given width. The density of t;~e minefield being laid is determined by the speed of the prime mover and rate of mine ejection, which can change within the range of one to fotir mines per second. The c:apacity of one load is 800 mines. It is planned to complete development of this mining system in 1979. _ 11 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY The RAAMS (Remote Artillery Antitank Min~ Sy~Cem; and ,~DAM (Area Denial Artillery Munition) antipersonnel system are representatives of artillery minelaying systems. Both of them are intended for use by authorized 155-mm howitzers (the M109A1 self-propelled and the M198 towed howitzer), the unit of fire of whicl: includes cassette roundsi with mines. These rounds are produced in the M483 standardized casing and ha~~c a common M577 point aerial- burst fuse. The a+~nuuiti~n enu~~erated below have been taken into the inven- tory and are in mass production. The M718 and M741 rounds, which contain nine M70 and M-73 mines each respec- . tively, are used in the RAAMS antitank mine system. The round's M577 point aerial-burst fuse is activated on a given leg of the tra~ectory and the mines contained in it are ejected, drop in the necessary area anc~ are auto- matically armed after a given time. The mining area when firing a salvo _ from 12 pieces is 350x250 m. The M629 and M731 rou~ds are used in the ADAM antipersonnel system. Each of them contains 36 M67 and M72 antipersonnel, fragmentation-type bounding mines each respectively. After falling to the _ ground, the mines are armed after thin trip wire-ser;sors are thrown from - their casings to the sides with the help of springs. The mines detonate . when one of the wires is touched by a person moving by. _ The SLU-MINE (Surface Launch ~nit-?~iine) missile m~ning system is being created for the engineer troops and is intended for rapid laying of anti- tank mines. It is a self-propelled, 30-tube launcher similar to that used for clearing minefields (the SLU-FAE mineclearing systeml). Using it, it - will be possible to lay minefields at a distance up to 5 km within r' extremely compressed time periods. The duration of a full launcher salvo is around 15 seconds. Firing will be by a NUR [free-flight rocket] with cassette warheads equipped with the M70 tank-killing mines. The projec- tile's payload opens up at a given point in its flight trajectory, the mines drop to the ground and are armed after a certain time interval. Mine- ~ laying can be done immediately in front of moving enemy tanks (Fig. 2) .[Figure not reproducedJ or directly on his combat formations. A salvo lays 720 mines. The M56 helicopter mining system is intended for laying the M56 explosion- proof tank-disabling mines. It was taken into the inventory in 1973 and belongs to first generation equipment, Minelaying is done from heights on ' the order of 30 m and a mine strip 20 m wide is laid with one pass of a helicopter. The mines (a total of 160) are in cassettes and are fired in pairs from rails using a propelling powder cartridge. Then they separate and their fins open. After falling to the ground the mines arm automaCi- ca11y after a certain delay period (1-2 seconds) and function when tanks or vehicles drive over them. Three versions of the M56 mines usually are con- tained in a single set: with a fuse which functions from the first effect; 1.

For example, according to reports of the West German military press, two antitank mines (AT-1 and AT-2) have been de~eloped for the Bundeswehr intended for scattering using remote equip- ment. The former already has been accepted into the inventory and its ~ production has been arranged, while the latter is in the final stage of testing. According to statements by West German specialists, the second type ~f mine, which possesses greater efficacy, should receive widest use. It is planned to use it in several minelaying systems. The MSM (Minenstreumitte?_) mine system will be in the inventory of Bundeswehr engineer units at the beginning of the eighties. It is planned to have two versions of it: ground-based and helicopter. The former (Fig. 3) [Figure not reproduced] is being made on the basis of the American M548 tracked transporter and will include sl.x cassettes consisting of packets of tubular rails. Each has 20 tubes containing 100 AT-2 antitank mines (five in each). The cassettes are detachable, mounted on joints and can change elevation. Mines are fired from the tubes by means of explosive cartridges. The rate and range of fire are regulated depending on the requisite mine- laying density and minefield length. In the helicopter version of the MSM minelaying system it is planned to mount two cassettes with mines, just as in the ground version, along the sides of an authorized Army rlviation heli- copter. The rocket minelayi_ng sys~em is represented in the Bundeswehr by the 36-tube 110-mm LARS [Light Artillerv Rocket Sy~*_em] volley-fire rocket system, which has in its unit of fire a NUR with c~G:sette warheads equipped with the AT-1 13 FOR OrFICIAL U5E ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY antitar.~k mines. 'i'he maximum range of fire is around 15 km and the salvo length is 18 seconds. If necessary it ss possible to fire half a volley. In the future it is planned to include pro~ectiles with AT-2 antitank mines in the unit of fire of this RSZO [salvo-fire rocket system]. Some of the NUR's also will be loaded with these mines for the RS$0 salvo-fire rocket system being developed in the FRG. Reports have appeared in the foreign military press of late about a projec- ted unification of ezforts within NATO to create a common standardized salvo-fire racket system. It is planned to make the American GSRS [General Rocket Support System] system its basis. It was reported in particular that the FRG would assume responsibility for the task of developing a NUR � with a cassette-type pay?oad loaded with the AT-2 antitank mines. Military specialists in Great Britain are also working to create remote mining systems. The first model of such equipment (the \"Ranger\" antiperson- nel mine system) has been accepted into the inventory and is being placed in series production. This system is intended for high-speed laying of anti- personnel blast mines chiefly for tY?e purpose of strengthening antitank obstacles. Its primary components are tl~e launcher (PU) and 18 cassettes with mines. A li~ht frame fastened to a removable rotating platform serves as the launcher. The platform can be mounted on the top o~ an APC or on the bed of a standard truck. The cassette is a packet of four tubes con- taining 18 antipersonnel mines each. The cassettes are loaded with mines at the plant and those which have been used are quickly replaced with others ready to fire, There is a total of 1,296 mi.*~es in one load. They are fired to a range up to 100 m using explosive cartridges. In the opinion of British specialists, it is most rational to use the new system together with the towed minelayer which lays distributed antitank mines. The PU of the \"Ranger\" system (Fig. 4) [Figure not reproduced] is accommodated on the roof of the F.V.432 \"Trojan\" tracked APC, which tows the minelayer. In this instance it is possible to lay mines of both types simultaneously. British military specialists have given a positive appraisal of the new minelaying equipment and consider it advisable to begin iievelopment of a new, small antitank mine which could be laid using the very same \"Ranger\" system. In addition, an opportunity is envisaged for accommo- dating this system on other mobile equipment, particularly on the recently created multipurpose \"Centaur\" wheeled-tracked vehicle.2 In recent years Italy has developed and begun production of a number of antitank and autipersonnel mines intended �or la}ring by remote mining systems. The DAT helicopter mine system already is in the inventory of the Italian ground forces. Work is continuing on the creation of ground-rocket and ar.tillery systems. ~ 2.

[Article by Engr-Col (Res) L. Leonov: \"Survivability of Warplanes and Ways to Increase It.\" Passages enclosed in slantlines printed in boldface] [Text] In continuing preparations for war against the USSR and other states of the socialist community, aggressive circles of countries of the North . Atlantic Alliance are attempting to increase the combat capabilities of their air forces, which are determined by the capability of aircraft and their crews to perform the missions assigned them under conditions of oppo- - sition by active air deiense weapons. In connection with this, as the foreiga press notes, the efforts of military leaders of the United States and its NATO allies are aimed at accomplishing measures to reduce aircraft lo~ses duriiig combat operations, including to increase the survivability of warplanes. For example, a special ~oint technical group has been operating in the United States since 1971 with the primary function of coordinating work being performed in the armed forces and other interested departments and establishments to increase the surviv- ability of aviation equipment. The views of western experts and certain practical measures to resolve this problem which are being conducted in capitalist states are examined below. /Aircraft survivability criteria/. In evalua.ting the survivability of air- craft in past wars and conflicts, foreign military specialists proceed from the following criteria: number of aircraft lost per 1,000 aircraft sorties or level of losses (the percentage of aircraft shot down per 1,000 or the total number of aircraft sorties for a c~rtain period of combat operations is calculated); average number of weapons (projectiles, missiles) expended by the enemy to destroy one aircraft; duration of an aircraft's flight after receiving various damages. Level of losses. In studying results of air combat operations from 1939 ~ through 1973, foreign experts obtained the following results. -1 , ~ 16 F~it OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY In Europe alone during World War TT allied aviation lust around 40,000 air- craft, with the average level of losses being 2 percent, but it was consid- erably lower in major air operations. Foreign specialists expl~in this by ~ the high effectiveness of mEasures performed to overcome the opposition of enemy air defense weapons. In particular, in major air operations against fascist Germany, the U.S. Air Force flew 4.4 million a;'.rcraft sorties (1.7 millian for bombers and 2.7 million for fighters and ground attack aircraft). There were 18,000 aircraft shot down, i.e., four aircrait for every 1,000 sorties (a level of 0.4 percent). On the whole, however, their losses to air defense weapons in the war equalled nine aircraft per 1,000 sorties (0.9 percent). In the Korean War (1950-1951) the average losses ~f American aviation were _ 4.4 aircraft per 1,000 sorties (0.44 percent). During the aggressive war unleashed by the United States against the Viet- - namese people, the American Air Force lost an average of three aircraft for every 1,000 sorties (0.3 percent). But this level reached 3 percent or more during raids against objectives located on the territory of North Vietnam, which forced the Air Force command to assign approximately 25 per- cent of the aircraft to perform REB [radioelectronic warfare--EW] and to suppress air defense weapons anu only around 50 percent were used for immediate performance of the primary combat missions. There were eight aircraft shot down (0.8 percent) for every 1,000 sorties by Israeli aircraft in the Near East (1973), while the level of losses of the A-4 \"Skyhawk\" ground attack aircraft reached 1-1.5 percent. In analyzing the experience of past wars and taking account of the contem- porary status of aviation and air defense weapons as well as the possible nature of combat operations, American military experts concluded that the use of aviation becomes unpractical if 20 or more aircraft (2 percent) are los~ for every 1,000 sorties. In the opinion of foreign specialists, the number of weapons expended per aircraft.characterizes the survivability of its airframe, flying qual- ities, and the effectiveness of tactics used by the crew in penetrating enemy air defense, as well as the effectiveness of weapons which they employ. , As reported in the journal INT~RNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, at the beginning of _ ~dorld War I around 11,600 AAA rounds were expended to shoot down one air- . craft, with approximately 5,000 used toward the end of the war as a result of an improvement in air defense weapons and the tactics of air defense forces, while an average of 6,800 were used to shoot down one aircraft in World War II. , Under present-day conditions, according to foreign military specialists' estimates, an average of 8,500 rounds (of 35-mm, 40-mm and 57-mm cannon) will be needed to shoot down an aircraft flying at a speed of 300 m/sec. 17 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ~ On the basis of data processed by A~erican experts on the use of ZUR [surface-to-air guided missiles--SAM's] during combat operations in Vietnam, it was established that an average of 3-6 missiles are required to destroy - one low-flying aircraft. The expenditure of ammunition for each aircraft shot down in aerial combat in the Korean War was 1,000 rounds from 20-mm - cannon, and in Vietnam it was 500 rounds or 11 AIM-9 \"Sidewinder\" air-to- air mi.ssiles. The length of time an aircraft flies after receiving damage basically characterizes the survivability of the airframe. The United States and certain other capitalist countries subdivide aircraft damage into five categories (given in Table 1). Table 1- Aircraft Damage Categories Categories Aircraft Flight Time After Sustaining Damage lst (serious) Up to 2 seconds 2d (serious) Up to 15 seconds 3d (medium) Up to 5 minutes _ 4th (medium) Up to 30 minutes Sth (light) Aircraft returns to air- field, where it is repaired After generalizing the experience of past wars, foreign experts concluded that serious damages occur more rarely than medium and light damages. In particular, they note that damages of the 2d, 3d and 4th categories were 3 times, 8 times and 15 times more frequent respectively than that of the lst category, while up to 24 percent of all American aircraft which returned from a combat mission had damage of the 5th category during World War II. These conclusions then served as the basis for projects to increase the survivability of airframes and for training crews to fly damaged aircraft. _ /Factors affecting aircraft survivability./ According to views of foreign specialists, the primary factors are considered to be: probability of the aircraft's detection by air defense facilities; vulnerability of the air- frame, aircraft systems and crew members; effectiveness of ineasures to help penetrate the enemy air defense system. Probability of aircraft detectiQn. The enemy can detect air target~ visu- ally and with the help of IK [infrared--IR] and radars. 18 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY The first depends on weather conditi~ns. For example, according to calcu- lations by NATO specialists, the range of visibility and recognition of a contemporary warplane under conditions of Central Europe does not exceed ~ 3.5-5 km on the average, while a fighter flying at low altitude can be - recognized only from a distance of 2.7 km, which considerably limits the capabilities of air defense facilities and thus increases the aircraft's survivability. The size and coloration of air targets has a great influence - on the possibility of their being detected visually. The smaller the size and the more successful the coloration, the more difficult it is to detect and shoot down such a target. IR equipment also is used to detect an aircraft both day and night. The range of detection with such equipment under Central European conditions is greater than that by visual means, and on the average is equal to 5-10 km. The primary sources of thermal radiation of an aircraft when flying at sub- sonic speed are the hot parts of the engines, streams of exhaust gases, - electronic gear, and also the leading edges of the wing and air intakes. The range of radar detection of a~ aircraft depends not only on its tactical and ~echnical characteristics, but also on the area of the aircraft's effec- tive reflecting surface, which in turn is determined by its size as well as by the shape and properties of structural materials and covering. Vulnerability of airframe, aircraft systems, and crew members. Research performed abroad has shown that the vulnerability of any aircraft and its crew is determined by the effectiveness of weapons being employed by the enemy and features of the airframe and its protection. The foreign press quoted selected data on effectiveness of damage to air- craft by AAA rounds and fragments of ZUR (it is considered that a direct hit by a ZUR leads to destruction of the target). In particular, the journal INTERNATIONAL DEEENSE REVIEW published a chart for determining the number of hits by various caliber rounds needed to shoot down a specific type of aircraft (Fig. l, on left) [illustrations 1 and 2 and Table 2 are not included in this translation]. It also includes a table w~tii.ch shows the amount of explosives in a round needed to destroy an air- craft with a direct hit (Table 2). Fig. 1(on right) shows a chart for determining the effective distances for detonation of missile warheads of varying yield which ensure damage to ar_ aircraft. It is calculated for altitude (under conditions of standard atmosphere). It is noted that the effective distance reduces by 50 percent at an altitude of 10,000 m and by 85 percent at an altitude of 20,000 m. Eut the journal stipulates that it is giving only estimated data, which may differ sharply from reality depending on the vulnerability of airframe elements of a specific aircraft. 7-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFi~IAL USE ONLY Foreign military specialists include the pilot, the aircraft's fuel system, flight control system and engines ~nong the mo~t vulnerable elements, and durable elements of the fuselage and wings among the most long-lived. In their opinion, damage to weapons and electronics may lead to nonaccomplish- ment of the mission, but the aircraft and crew will return to base. Airr_raft survivabil.ity is linked closely with its so-called restorability, i.e., the opportunity for repairing damages within a certain time interval. In the opinion of foreign specialists, repairs will contribute to an increase in aircraft combat readiness only when they can be performed under field conditions. The foreign press gives the A-l0A ground attack aircraft - as an example of a modern warplane with a low vulnerability and good restorability indicators. Accommodation of elements of its airframe from the standgoint of time periods for their restoration is shown in Fig. 2. ~:easures to ensure the penetration of enemy air defense system. According to views of foreign experts, the primary measures i.nclude u~e of the most advantageous altitudes and flight speeds; proper selection of routes and directions of approach to target; antiradar, antimissile and anti-AAA maneuvering; using active and passive jamming of radars, infrared sensors - and other equipment for the detection of air targets and control of air defense forces and weapons; and the destruction or suppression of the most important objects in the enemy air defense system. /Increasing aircraft survivability./ Military specialists of the United _ States and other NATO countries believe that it is possible to increase air- craft survivability through a reduction in the probability of their detec- tion, a reduction in the vulnerability of the aircraft itself and of its crew, an improvement in onboard EW gear and weapons, and development of operating tactics. According to their views, it is possible to reduce range and probability of detection by flying at low altitude, by limiting the use of afte~burner power settings, by shielding the hottest parts of engines, and by using camouflage paints and radar-absorbing materials. - _ An increase in survivability of the aircraft and crew is provided by armor-protection of cockpits; accommodation of crew members one after the other (in tandem), separated by a transp�rent armored partition; increasing the number of engines in the power plant; redundancy of aircraft systems; - providing self-sealing fuel tanks; equi.pping the aircraft with special firefighting gear; and proper selectio~a of a location for ammunition. These measures are especially effective, in the opinion of foreign special- ists, when they are conducted in an integrated manner and are implemented in programs for creation of new aircraft. For example, the pilot's cockpit in the A-10 ground attack aircraft is protected by titanium armor capable of withstanding hits by 23-mm rounds, the aircraft's hydraulic control system is duplicated by a mechanical cable system, each of the two engines provides for flying the aircraft in case one of them is disabled, the fuel tanks are n~~I-sealing and so on.

To increase their survivability, aircraft are outfitted with guided missiles (bombs) which can be launched (dropped) before entering the enemy's air defense coverage; with special gear which warns of radar illumination of� the aircraft; and with systems for creating active and passive jamming of detection, guidance and control radars and of missile ho?r~ing heads. In order to destroy enemy radar used to control ZUR fire, aircraft are equi~ped with \"Shrike,\" \"Standard\" ARM and other missiles which home on a source of electromagnetic radiation. Aircraft operating tactics also are being improved. Primary attention is beign given abroad to mastering flights at low altitudes, creation of jamming of detection and guidance radar and IR equipment, the use of anti- AAA and antimissile maneuvers, and assignment of combat support forces for reconnoitering air defense weapons, for their suppression, destruction and confusion through deception measures, and for screening attack groups of fighters. , COPYRIGHT: \"Zarubezhnoye voyenT.oye obozreniye\", 1979 ~ 6904 CSO: 1801 21 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY U.S. ANTI-AIR-DEFEN~E AIRCRAFT: SOVIET CO~NT Moscow ZARUBEZHNOYE VOYENNOYE OBOZRENIYE in Russian No 9, Sep 79 signed to press 4 Sep 79 pp 46-48 [Article by Co1 I. Chistyakov: \"U.S. Air Force 'Wild Weasel' Program\"] [Text] Viewing tactical aviation as one of the most important means for achieving its aggressive goals in a future war, the Pentagon is constantly increasing its tactical capabilities, especially for use in a TVD [theater of military operations] under conditions of heavy opposition on the part of enemy air defense. To this end, the U.S. Air Force leaders envisage tha conduct of specific activities, primary among them, as attested by the foreign press, being the suppression and destruction of active air defense facilities. Having studied the e:~perience of combat operations in SoutheasC Asia and the Near East, Amer ican military specialists continue to regard control entities, particularly radar, to be the most vulnerable spot in modern air defense systems. It is planned to concentrate primary efforts of forces and facilities supporting combat operations by tactical aviation at putting them out of act ion. ~ A program conducted by the U.S. Air Force Tactical Air Command under the codename \"Wild Weasel\" is an examp le of this approach to resolving this problem. According to foreign press reports, the refitting of series- produced tactical aircraft into aircraft sFecially designed for suppressing and destroying air defense systems is being done in conformity with this program (in the foreign press these aircraft are desi~nated according to the name of the program, such as the F-4G \"Wild Weasel\"). According to the views of western military specialists, depending on the situation, such aircraft may operate independently from an air alert status or as part of . strike groups performing direct air support of ground forces. In each of these inst ances, they accomplish the mission of combating enemy ground con- trol facilities for fighters, ZRK [SAM sysCems] and ZA [AAA] through the ~ detection, identification and position-fixing of emitting detection, target designation and guidance radars, as well as through their destruction using ~ onboard ordnance. According to calculations by foreign military speciatists. this should reduce the effectiveness of the air defense system. 22 FOR OFFICIAL U~E ONLY ~ = ~ . ; _ APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ~ According to foreign press reports, the practical implementatian of the program began in 1966 with the conduct of combat operations in Southeast Asia. F-105F fighter-bombers equipped with REB [electronic warfare--EW] gear controlled by an operator from the second cockpit, were used as \"Wild = Weasel\" aircraft. In addition, RB-66 reconnaissance aircraft made on the basis of the B-66 bomber also were used. Somewhat later, during barbaric bombings of the territory of the DRV, the _ American aggressors emgloyed specially equipped F-105G and EB-b6 aircraft with EW gear and weapons aboard. In particular, every F-105G aircraft had a detection receiver aboard and carried a suspended pod with electronic countermeasures [ECM] gear and four \"Shrike\" antiradar UR [guided missiles] or two \"Standard\" ARM missiles. According to foreign press infornation, a total of around 40 F-lOSG's were equipped under this program. - Beginning in 1970, the U.S. Air Force used a portion of F-4C fighters (two squadrons, 34 aircraft) equipped with special ~ear and weapons for suppressing and destroying ground air defense facilities in combat opera- tions in Southeast Asia. Installed in them were reconnaissance receivers, jammers, chaff dispensers, and antiradar UR's. The foreign press noted that the \"Wild Weasel\" aircraft demonstrated a rather high degree of effec- . tiveness and successfully accomplished the missions assigned them. In the opinion of American military specialists, the role of \"T~Tild Weasel\" aircraft in supporting tactical air operations will increase immeasurably under conditions of thz European Theater of War, saturated with electronic emitters. This spurred the U.S. military leadership Ca continue raork to improve onboard equipment and weapons for the \"Wild Weasel\" aircraft. The F-4E fighter, which was des~gnated the F-4G after modernization, was chosen as such an aircraft. Modernization consists chiefly of removing the \"Vulcan\" 20-mm gun and replacing it with appropriate electronic gear--the APR-38 system. It includes a detection receiver, signal analyzer, elec- tronic computer, situation display, antenna system and auxiliary equipment. The receiver is designed for use in a sonhisticated electronic environment and so its operation and the processing of data received has been sutomated using a digital compurer. The antenna system provides a~anoramic view. The direction-finding of radiation sources is done with high accuracy, which makes it possible to employ not only antiradar guided missiles against detected targets, but also other ordnance (the \"Maverick\" air-to-surface UR, guided bombs and bomb clusters). Data on signals being sought and inter- cepted are displayed on scopes located in the cockpits of the pilot and operator of the electronic gear. In addition to the APR-38 system, the F-4G aircraft is equipped with built-in ALQ-131 EW gear and suspended pods with ALQ-119 jammers, the \"Sparrow\" or \"Sidewinder\" air-to-air UR's (for aerial. combat), as well as various antiradar UR's (\"Shrike,\" \"Standard\" ARM or the HARM, which is under development) and other ordnance. In this regard the Air Force 23 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPROVED F~R RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY . ~ command is presenting higher demands on pilo~s: They must have a suffi- ciently large numbe~~ of f lying hours aboard F-105 or r-4 aircraft and be capable of conducting aerial combat and delivering strikes against small ground targets using both guided and unguided weapons. The plans of the American command envisage having 116 F-4G aircraft in the Air Force inventory (96 in combat units and the remainder for pilot train- ing and for the reserve). Some of them will be deployed in Western Europe (according to the foreign press, the first aircraft already have arrived at the disposal of the U.S. Air Force command in Europe). At the present time the United States is c~nducting investigations to select a prospective \"Wild Weasel\" aircraft to replace the F-4G. Thus, according to foreign press reports, the General Dynamics firm is studying the possi- bility of creating a variation, which has received the codename F-16 \"Wild Weasel\" and intended for identification and destruction of enemy ground air defense facilities, on the basis of the twc-place F-16B fighter (see color insert). As the firm's specialists note, some countries which are members of the NATO bloc and which are purchasing the F-16 fighter have shown interest in this modification. ~n addition, in choosing the F-16B as a \"Wild Weasel\" aircraft, American experts referred to its advantages: rela- tively low cost with, at th~ same time, the capability of carrying a sig- nificant payload on external attachment points (over 6,000 kg) and a fuel reserve sufficient for performing assigned missions (2,620 kg in internal tanks and around 2,200 kg in auxiliary tanks). In addition to special onboard electronics, particularly the AN/ALR-46 electronic intelligence set, the F-16 \"Wild Weasel\" aircraft will be able , to carry diverse weapons in various versions. mhe pages of foreign military journals provide some variations of its payload: two pods with antennas at the wingtips (instead of the \"Sidewinder\" UR), a pod with EW gear under the fuselagE, two auxiliary fuel tanks, and the \"Shrike\" and \"Standard\" ARM antiradar UR's on wing attachment points (see illustration) [Illustration not reproduced] or two HARM UR's and three \"Maverick\" UR's. - Reports have appeared in the foreign press that the American firm of McDonnell-Douglas aiso is examining the possibility of creating a\"Wild ~ Weasel\" aircraft on the basis of the F-15 fighter. The firm's specialists cite as the new aircraft'~s advantages its high thrust-to-weight ratio and considerable fuel reserve, which can almost be doubled by installing ~uick-detachable fuel tanks which protrude little beyond the fuselage lines, i.e., the \"Fast Pack\" system. The nature of woLk being dorie in the United States to improve \"Wild Weasel\" _ ~ircraft in the inventory and to create new such aircraft attests to the unremitting attention of American strategists to a search for tactical air ;support forces and means for penetrating enemy air defenses, by which they unambiguously take to mean the Soviet Unioti and other countries of the ;socialist community.

These forces are pursuing just such a goal in conducting exercises and maneuvers of varying scale. As pointed out in the foreign press, they are used to practice various versions for unleashing armed conflicts primarily against countries of the socialist community, and to train staffs, troops and naval forces to conduct combat operations under near-real wartime conditiona. The annual exercises of joint NATO armed forces in the Sou.thern European TVD [Theater of Milit~.ry OperationsJ under the codename \"Dawn Patrol\" are devoted in particular to the accomplishment of these missions. ~ An exercise of this sort was conducted in 1979 from 12 through 24 May in the western, central and eas~ern Mediterranean, as well as on the terri- tories of Italy and Turkey. Its primary objective was to work out problems of converting NATO armed forces in the Southern European TVD from a peace- time to a wartime footing, to reinforce them by moving air force subunits and naval ships of the United States and Great Britain from the Atlantic, and to conduct operations of the initial period of a limited war without the use of nuclear weapons.

Forces iii the exercise were broken down into \"Blue\" (NATO Joint Armed Forces) and \"Orange\" (\"enemy\"). Participating on the \"Blue\" side were surface ships including the multipurpose carriers \"Dwight D. Eisenhower,\" \"America\" and \"Clemenceau\" as part of NATO's naval attack forces in the Southern European TVD, Marine subunit~, strategic, carrier-based, tactical ~nd coastal patrol aircraft, and personnel and facilities of the southern ` zone of NATO's joint air defense system; and on the \"Orange\" side were nuclear-powered ar_d diesel-powered submarines, a few surface ships as part of :;hip attack groups, guided missile and torpedo boats, and separate units = and sub;:nits of the ground forces and tactical aviation. Taking place in the first phase of the exercise was the deployment of forces . in tactical mission areas (western and central Mediterranean); formation of task forces and groups; hunting, pursuit and \"destruction\" of \"enemy\" subma- rines in parts of the Adriatic, Tyrrhenian and Ionian seas and on antisubma- rine barriers; a practice amphibious la.nding in Teulada Bay (island of Sardinia). Th~ amphibious landing of a total of up to 2,500 Marines was conducted from one Italian and seven American amphibious warfare ships by means of ships' landing craft. It was supported by ship hunter-killer groups deployed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, Gulf of Tunis and southwest of the island of Sardinia. Coastal patrol aircraft and ship-based helicopters performed a hunt for and _ \"destruction\" of \"enemy\" submarines. Deck-based aircraft from the carrier \"America\" and \"Clemenceau,\" located up to 100 nm from the island of Sardinia, provided air support to the landing force and its operations ashore.

The winning oF sea supremacy was aesured through the ~oint efforts of ehip - attack and hunter-killer groups and carrier-based and tactical aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft opErated in groups from several directions simul- taneously in delivering strikes against \"enemy\" surface ships. , _ The: passage of the joint amphibious landing force from Sardinia to the T_urkish coast took place in the presence of active \"enemy\" submarine and fighter-bomber aviation operations and under conditions of mine danger in straits and narrows. The force was screened by carrier-based and tactical aviation, with deck-based fighters opera~ing as part of combat air patrols on threatened axes at a distance up to 30 nm from the carriers. The amphibious force was landed in Doganbey Bay (Turkey) with the help of ships' landing craft and helicopters. Its landing was preceded by air and artillery support by carrier-based and fighter-bomber aircraft as well as ships of the fire support detachment. Ship hunter-killer groups isolated , the landing area and provided antisubmarine support to the anchoring of landing ships and transports. Beach defense was conducted jointly by units and subunits of the ground forces and fighter-bomber aircraft of Turkey. A convoy escort was organized from the vicinity of Gibraltar to the Italian coast under conditions of mine danger and opposition on.the part of \"enemy\" submarines and aircraft to practice problems of defending sea lines of communication in the western Mediterranean. Other missions also were accomplished in the exercise: patrol of all-arms forces, interaction of naval forces with tactical aviation for delivering strikes against \"enemy\" ship groupings coordinated by place and time,; performance of reconnaissance, organization of all kinds ~f defense of ship forces during the sea passage and at anchorages, mine warfare support to force operations and to Ghips behind ,,~~:c~, ~cdL auu logistical support of ships at sea. Special attention was given to the use of REB [electronic warfare) facilities to disrupt the cor.trol and communications system, to confuse the \"enemy\" and to suppress his detection and fire control radars.

The /Bosporus/ (Fig. 2) [Figure not reproduced], which separates Europe and Asia, represents a winding strait with high, precipitous banks. 7~he /Dardanelles/ is the strait connecting the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean Sea. It is over 60 km long, 4-7 km wide and around 1.3 km wide in the narrowest place (near Canakkale). The banks of the strait are low and monotonous, formed from sandstone and limestone and covered by sparse vege- tation. There are no bays or inlets. The water turnover through the Dar- danelles is determined by the difference in water density of adjoining seas. A surface current from northeast to southwest takes freshened water with a lesser density (1.018) from the Sea of Marmara at a velocity of 2-6 km/hr. A deep current with the reverse direction carries saline (38 parts per thousand) and dense (1.029) waters from the Aegean Sea. The /regime of the Black Sea Straits/ presently in existence is determined ~ by a convention concluded in 1936 in Montreaux (Switzerland). It provides for free passage through the straits by any number of inerchant vessels of all states both in peace and in war. The transit of warships of non-Black Sea countries in wartime is prohibited, _ and in peacetime it is limited by the class of ships, their period of stay in waters of the Black Sea, and by tonnage (only light surface ships can be taken through for a period up to 21 days, and their overall tonnage must not exceed 45,000 tons). The transit of warships of Black Sea states in peacetime is declared free if the Turkish government is informed of this at least 8 days ahead of time and on condition of.the fulfillment ot',certain requirements.

According to the Convention, in wartime, if Turkey is not a participant, the transit of warships of the bc~lligerents is prohibited; and in case Turkey enters the war or is threatened by direct military danger, the Turkish ~ government has the right to authorize or prohibit the transit of any war= ships through the straits. It is generally known, however, that during World War II the country's leaders declared their neutrality after Germany's attack on the Soviet Union and granted the fascist invaders an opportunity to make use of the Black Sea Straits for their own purposes, in violation of the aforementioned provisions. /Elements of the infrastructure./ In the estimate of the foreign press, the J strait zone has a ramified network of naval bases, ports, convenient bays for basing and anchorages for warships and vessels of practically any dis- placement. [Brief description of the most important infrastructure elements follows, Not translated.; /The Black Sea Straits and the NATO bloc./ The NATO bosses, and American ~ , strategists above all, attempt to explain the heightened interest in the strait zone by the very same imaginary \"Soviet military threat,\" particu- larly \"to Turkey and her straits,\" which long ago set people's teeth on edge. As the foreign press has written, \"defense of Western Europe is inevitably linked with security of the Mediterranean area. But Russia's egress to this sea lies through the Turkish straits,.\" Therefore \"inclu~s.ion of the Mediterranean in the zone of protection of the Atlantic Alliance\" and Turkey's entry into NATO increase \"United States interests in their defense\" and give the straits \"primary importance in Washington's geostrate- gic approach.\" Turkey's proximity to the Soviet Union and the presence of the Black Sea Straits zone within the country's limits forces the United States to undertake any measures to keep Turkey within NATO, in the opinion of western observers. Judging from foreign press reports, Turkey's territory, air space and coastal waters have been included in the \"zone of responsibility\" of the Supreme Command of NATO Joint Armed Forces in the Southern European TVD [Theater of Military Operations]. Defense of the strait zone within the framework of the alliance is made the direct responsibility of the command of NATO's joint ground forces in the southeastern part of the TVD (headquar- ters in Izmir), the command of the 6th OTAK [Joint Tactical Air Command) (same location) and command of joint naval forces in the northeastern part of the Mediterranean (headquarters at Ankara).

But the Sixth Fleet, which the American press openly terms the \"guardian of the straits,\" is the primary \"defender of United States interests in this region.\" The role of \"a screen of the strait zone\" is given to tl~e Turklsh Armed i'orcea in NATO pluns: reaponsibility for coverin~ it in Eastern Thrace is given to forces of the lst Field Ar.my (headquarters at Istanbul), to fo~ces and weapons of the lst Tactical Air Army (Eskisehir) from the air, and to the command of the Northern Naval Zone (Istanbul) from the sea. According to foreign press reports, the lst PA [Field Army] includes four army corps, which include ten divisions and four separate brigades. Units of the lst PA are stationed in eastern Thrace and on the Kodzhaeli Penin- sula. The lst TVA [Tactical Air Army] is associated with four air bases: Eskisehir (two F-100D and F-100C fighter-bomber squadrons and one squadron of F-4E aircraft), riurted (two F-104S and F-104G fighter-bomber squadrons and one squadron of F-102A fighters), Bandyrma (two F-SA fighter squadrons) and Balikesir (one squadron each of F-100D and F-104G fighter-bombers and one squadron of RF-5A reconnaissance aircraft). Along with fighter aviation, air defense facilities of the strait zone also include two groups (four squadrons each) with 72 \"Nike-Ajax\" and \"Nike-Hurcules\" ZUR [SAM] launchers located in the vicinity of the Bosporus. Four naval regions are subordinate to the command of the Northern Naval Zone: Black Sea, Bosporus, Dardanelles and Sea of Marmara. They are consid- ered operational and have no ship forces under ordinary conditions. Depending on the nature of operations (exercises) being planned by the command of this zone, the required number of ships is assigned from the fighting forces of the Navy.* Naval region commanders bear responsibility for performing the following missions: blockading the stralt4, supporting all kinds of coastal defense, supporting the maritime flank of ground forces, and moving personnel and combat equipment through the strait zone. i)uring World War II, in order to screen immediate approaches to the straits, the Turkish command created the Bosporus and Dardanelles.fortified areas ;now the commands of the corresponding naval regions) with the mission of preventing the transit of surface ships and submarines through the straits f:rom the Black and Aegean seas. Batteries of 100-240 mm coastal artillery and sea-search radars were set up j.n the vicinity of Rumelifeneri (on the European bank of the Bosporus) and ~tnadolufeneri (on the Asiatic side) for combating large surface ships, and batteries for defense against motor torpedo boats were set up at the water's edge. The latter also are situated in other areas along the straits.

There are also stores of mines and net and boom gear in the Dardanelles (Canakkale). Special stations are situated at the entrances to the straits for monitoring and observing the movement of foreign ships. \"Protection\" of the str~it zone is constantly being practiced in various ~ exercises both of the Turkish Armed Forces and of Joint Armed Forces of the NATO bloc. NATO exercises such as \"Deep Furrow,\" \"South Express,\" \"Marmara Express\" and others conducted in recent years have had the purpose of work- ing out problems of reinforcing the grouping of bloc member country ground forces in the zone of the Black Sea Straits. During the exercises there was a practice landing of airborne and amphibious forces on Turkish terri- tory and its coast, and a move by subunits of mobile ground forces and air forces from the Central European TVD to regions of Eastern Thrace. These forces took part in \"combat operations\" together with national forces of Turkey. The foreign press even reported that \"tactical nuclear weapons may be used in defending the strait zone in Thrace.\" According to the concepts of NATO strategists, this should provide \"rather effective protection of the straits.\" All this profuse talk about \"protection\" of the strait zone is intended for cloaking the true intentions of leading circles of the NATO bloc to use the Elack Sea Straits for carrying out their aggressive plans in the Black Sea basin. The American press has emphasized repeatedly t~hat this region has decisive significance for all NATO strategy in the Southern European TVD. Therefore the NATO countries headed by the United States presently are using all means of pressure, including economic and military-political levers, to consoli- date their military presence in Turkey--an important NA~O str~ngpoint con- trolling routes from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, and to activate this country's military role on the bloc's southern flank. It is generally known that any state is viewed by American imperialists primarily from the viewpoint of an opportunity of using its territory for actions against the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist community. And Ti~rkey, to which the United States is applying \"arm- twisting\" tactics in order to include her more completely in the Pentagon's aggressive plans, is no except3.on. As the foreign press attests, such intentions cloak a threat to peace and security for nations of the rlediterranean area and in no way correspond to the spirit of the times.

M. Isayev:l \"First Steps Toward Soviet SpacQ Engines: 1941-1947\") [Text] In November 1941, a train approached a sma11 railroad station in the Central Urals. This,was one of the many trains stretching from west to east at that time, trains with people and equipment to forge weapons in the heartland to right the enemy. The designers and workers who had disembarked at the sma11, old pipe-casting plant had to finish developing a new type of fighter as quickly as possible. This was the first Soviet propellerless aircraft. A liquid-propellant rocket engine would give it a tremendous rate of climb. Such a fighter would not have to flyon patrol while waiting for an enemy bomber; moreover, it wouZd not have enough propellant for this. It would wait for the enemy on the ground. It would launch when the enemy was already overhead. There would be 2-3 minutes of almost vertical flight and a single, com- , pletely unexpected, unavoidable attack with its two aircraft cannons. With empty tanks, it would descend for refueling and for a new sortie-shot. At the station, Chief Designer V. F. Bolkhovitinov's Experi- mental Design Bureau disembarked. The originator of the ~ idea2 of a rocket-propelled interceptor, A. Ya. Bereznyak, worked in this bureau. At the beginning of 1941, he had already suggested the development of a design for such a vehicle to Isayev, his friend. Together, they began to develop intercept charts and to center and configure various versions of the strange vehicle; they established contact with the engine specialists. The group headed by L. S. Dushkin3-- the designer of liquid-propellant rocket engines--was located in small, round buildings behind a green fence on a quiet lane. They showed Isayev and Bereznyak their entire collection of 32 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - .

The 1,100 kg thrust was suitable. DuRhkin's specialists were also developing a turbo-pump unit for this engine; it would take the unconventior.al propellant from the tanks and pump it to the engine under a pressure of 50 atmos- pheres. While hiding it from their boss, Bereznyak and Isayev drew Dushkin's combustion chamber into the tail of their vehicles; they put in the tanks and the turbo-pump unit. Of course, such strange behavior by the two designers could not help but - be noticed by Viktor Fedorvich Bolkhovitinov When the job assigned to them was obviously not progressing but both of them were working like mad at the sanie time. But, he decided to wait until his colleagues came to him and told him them- selves. Then, he appreciated their idea and from that time on they worked in the open under the chief designer's super- vision and management. The vehicle's outline was taking shape and its tactical capabilities were emerging. Meanwhile, at Dushkin's, the chamber appeared to begin work- ing but the development of the turbo-pump unit was lagging behind. Once, Isayev held a meeting on a version of the ~ vehicle without this unit. He decided to try other alterna- tives: what would the vehicle be like if the propellant was forced out of the cylinders by compressed air instead of by the turbo-pump unit? What if the vehiele were scaled-down by half: make it a ton and a half vehicle instead of a three- ton one? A ton and a half vehicle would work. There would ~ be less fuel, engine operating time would be reduced and the trajectory would be steeper but enemy pursuit and inter- cept would be guaranteed since the intercept zone remained rather large. During the night, the rough drawing was com- pleted. Sunday morning arrived. Isayev turned on the radio.... It was 22 June 1941. In three weeks, the preliminary design of an interceptor with a liquid-propellant rocket engine--which was designated the BI based on the initial letters of Bereznyak's and Isayev's last names--was completed. This design, signed by aircraft - designers Bolkhovitinov, Bereznyak and Isayev and by the engine designer Dushkin,. was sent to the chairman of the State Defense Committee. The authors were rather quickly summoned 33 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY by the People's Commissar for the USSR Aviation Industry, A. I. Shakhurin, and told that the design was approved and they had a month to complete it. The entire group.began working feverishly. The designers made rough drawings and went to the shops. The design work was still not ~finished when the wing wa.~ taken out of the jig. The monocoque fuse- lage was covered with a veneer sheet and the equipment was installed in it ~cight on the spot. The gear struts had already been raade, the canopy was attached and the cannons were installed. Caught up with the enthusiasm, the small, cohesive group of workers and engineers rolled their first vehicle out of the assembly shop 30 days later. It was sent to the Central Aero-hydrodynamic Institute's new, large wind - tunnel for tests. The vehicle was so small that it com- pletely fit in the tunnel. Another vehicle was made to be towed behind an aircraft. Then, the first engine was delivered to Bolkhovitinov's Experimental Design Bureau. lt was installed in a steel truss made from the propellant cylinders; the pilot`s seat and the throttle were in front of the cylinders. They began to check out the propulsion system. Now, it is even frightening to recall what this propulsion 8ystem was liice! The nitric acid cylinders were made from Ctomansil. The thrust control throttle was also made from simple steel. A small, oxygen pressure reduction valve from a welding machine was installed to reduce the pressure of the compressed air delivered to the prorellant cylinders. The entire assembly was made from 20-mm aluminum-magnesium ~ alloy tubes. The throttle was jammed in, the Cromansil cylinders were badly corroded and the joints on the external cone were scored. Why there were no unfortunate incidents is a complete mystery. Dressed in oil-skin jackets, flight helmets and with their gasmasks at their side, Dushkin's mechanics worked mysteriously near the tai1. Bolkhovitinov's ~ first \"liquid-propellant'engine\" mechanics--A. M. Smirnov and 16-year old Oleg Shtin--were beginning to get used to Che nitric acid vapors,whic~ rose in clouds over the bench when there were spills. Sometimes, test firings were made. Fire, smoke, stenc'h and a frightening roar. Then, the mechanics leaned into the nozzle with a long scraper and swept out the pool of black liquid, which had accumulated in the chamber, on to the ground and they counted the holes in the nozzle thr~at. The spark plugs in the injection head were only sufficient for the first firing. Week after week passed and engine development was not progressing. 34 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY . / APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY At that tin~e, the fascist air raids on Moscow had begun. Bit3ng their lips, the designers and mechanics stood around their smelly, firing unit and watched the Moscow skies being cut by the beams of search lights and anti-aircraft tracers. Squadronc of combat aircraft were already based at the plant airfield. The plant had received an urgent front line order to install new cannons on the MIG's. Preparations were under- way to destroy the entire production unit if the criCical time arrived. They received the order: load on to trains and leave for the East. Within a few hours,on 25 October, the plant equipment was removed and loaded along with the BI vehicles, the engine test bench, tanks, cylinders and tubes. The em- ~ ployees and their families got on board. The Bolkhovitinov group left for the Urals. The intensely desperate work led to the situation where test pilot G. Ya, Bakhchivandzhi had alreadyaccomplished the first flight in the history of av.iation in the first Soviet rocket- propelled fighter on 15 May 1942. Severa.l other test flights were conducted later. With the understanding that they could no longer rely on future joint work with the Jet Propulsion Scientific Research In- stitute to develop the engine, Bolkhovitinov suggested that Isayev transfer his interests in a fuel system to another person arid~work closely on the engine to support~the Experi- mental Design Bureau's future work. Z'he first days were especially difficult. He had no literature or teachers. But, Isayev was able to find out about a certain V. P. Glushko (now an academician), who was working in this field, Bolkhovitinov and Isayev immediately set out to see him. At the aircraft plant's design bureau, they found a man who knew engines. V. P. Glushko willingly showedthem his bench areas and his production and design sections; he gave them a thermo-dynamic cooling design. Under his guidance, they received a thorough explanation which could not even be com- pared to t~~eir previous amateurish work. Isayev elatedly returned from Glushko's shop and began to operate more boldly, both on paper and on the 3ob. The first designs of individual units appeared. A new combus- tion system began to take shape--using a precombustion chamber and an aircraft spark plug which ignited the mixture of benzene and air. This precombustion chamber was attached to a birch tree which grew on the bank of the glant pond. It noisily spouted fire and was the first article for firing tests. Isayev was extremely interested in future firing benches at 35 ~ FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040051-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY that time. At the Pervouralsk New Pipe Plant, Isayev pulled stainless steel pipes out of the dump buried under a pile of rubbish. They put everything into the ~ob that could be ~ found. Meanwhile, after mastering Glushko's design methods, the designere refined them further. In May 1943, the Experimental Design Bureau returned to its old facility from the Urals; they began to set up an engine division. The following people worked in it: L. A. Pchelin, A. A. Tolstov, V. F. Berglezov, I. I. Raykov, G. G. Golovintsova, V. G. Yefremov, N. I. Korovin and others. Three walls of an unfinished hangar towered above the northern part of the plant's territory. They built a 300 square meter cinder block facility attached to the center wall; in the summer of 1943, the entire engine division moved here. The northern end accommodated a firing bench with two work areas. The central area contained the compressor, the instrument room, the storeroom and a hydraulic bench for nozzle flow tests. Then, there was the design bureau and, further on, a workshop - with two lathes. Everybody was very satisfied with the facility: they were comfortable, self-contained and complete! In the winter, it was even warm there. Two stoves had been built; due to the lack of wood, they were heated with bricks soaked in kerosene. It was not clear why these stoves filled up the rooms with soot. Overall, from the modern point of view, the experimental facility was extremely primitive both in its - engineering parameters and in its measuring systems and, it was simply intolerable in safety procedures, san itary condi- tions an d fire safety. By the spring of 1944, the~ benches were basically a11 set up and the division felt that it was capab~le of serious, independent work. Bolkhovitinov decided to make their first assignment official through the government: \"Develop a multiple-firing, aircraft liquid-propellant rocket engine for a thrust envelope - from 400 to 1,100 kg, with smooth control, with a specific im- pulse of at least 200 seconds and 'a total burn time of 30 minute~; . and present it in October of the same year.\" It was designed to replace the engine designed by the Jet Propulsion Scien- tific Research Institute on the BI aircraft in order to con- tinue the vehicle's development which was interrupte~i by Bolkhovitinov's death in 1943. The primary employees of the design group were G. G. Golovintsova and A. S. Gvozdeva while L. A. Pchelin and V. F. Berglezov were the primary design force fo r the combustion chambers. They reviewed the previous design and came up with a number of original solutions both for the design and for technology. N. I. Novikov had acquired 36 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY t _ _ .

Experiments were conducted on igniting the propellant components during engine firing. This was the _ beginning of the development for the first engine which received the identifier RE-1 [rocket engine]. It was under development from the spring of 1944.until October when it was submitted for State Bench Tects. It passed tliem with outstanding marks. A total of two engines were used during development. Engine No 3 was submitted to the State Commission while Engine No 4 was flight tested. The program for the State Bench Tests made provisions for ten firings without approaching the engine. This requirement was strictly accomplished. During the entire test period, nobody approached the engine with a wrench. It worked for the prescribed time and then was disassembled and studied for defects. None were discovered. The measured performance confirmed mission accomplishment. The designers celebrated their victory; the group was gi~en a large monetary award and, a year later, everybody in the ~ group received orders and medals. At the same time, govern- mental decorations were awarded to the designers of the liquid-propellant rocket engine--Glushko and Dushkin, col- laboratorsto the Experimental BESign Bureau. With the RE-1 engine on it, the BI carried out a seriea of flights. The official document signed by Chief Designer Bolkhovitinov stated that the engine operated steadily during flight testing. The transition from one regime to another proceeded smoothly following the engine control quadrant. The automatic engine start was accomplished without failure and the transition from the starting regime to operational regime was smooth. ~ngine control, the electrical circuit, the automatic equipment and power system units functioned in a satisfactory manner. The engine performance obtained during the teGts met the design performance as did the data obtained during the State Bench Tests. ~ At the end of the war, the German Jumo-4 and BMW-003 turbo- supercharger engines were Y~rought from Koenigsberg. In the Soviet Union, A. M. Lyul'ka had already been successfully working on these kinds"
