        "text": "Pure Commiphora Erethraea essential oil.\n\nOpoponax (also spelled Opopanax) is a member of the same family as myrrh and is often called sweet myrrh. It is a small tree that grows in Somalia. It has been a component of incense and perfumes since Biblical times and is likely the myrrh spoken of in the Song of Solomon. In magic, it is associated with the Death card in Tarot, Scorpio, and Mars. Crowley described its scent as “an overpowering richness of the deliciously abominable.\"\n\nIt is traditionally used in perfumery and occasionally as a flavouring in liqueurs for its intensely sweet, balsamic, spicy, and warm odour, somewhat reminiscent of wine residue. In magic, it has been used for protection and purification.\n\nASPECTS:sweet · balsamic · spicy · warm\n\nAPPEARANCE:light yellow, transparent, mobile liquid\n\nCOUNTRY OF ORIGIN:Kenya\n\nPLANT PART:resin\n\nPresented in a 5ml or 15ml black glass bottle with a euro dropper top that may have to be removed depending on the viscosity of the item selected. Please note that essential oils and absolutes vary widely in thickness and consistency.\n\nEssential oils, absolutes, and other pure plant extracts should not be applied to the skin without being properly diluted in a cosmetic carrier (such as jojoba oil, ethanol, epsom salts, etc.) Always patch-test when using an essential oil or absolute for the first time, and research whether or not the extract you are using is skin-safe, or that it is appropriate for its intended use. Do not ingest essential oils or apply them internally, and avoid contact with the eyes. Keep out of reach of children and pets, and consult a knowledgeable health practitioner before use when pregnant or breastfeeding. Store in a cool and dry area."
