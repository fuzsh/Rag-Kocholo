It's a completely different creative process from the traditional perfumery method, which begins with the identification of the local raw materials and then carefully compiles an inventory of the best natural extracts from these terroirs to compose the formulation of each perfume.  It's an innovation that confers upon each of the brand's fragrances the role of ambassador of these lands and terroirs, without omitting the role of the men and women who cultivate and harvest the rare raw materials used in their composition. 5% of Nissaba sales to fund farmers to invest in sustainable agriculture of aromatic ingredients.  Nissaba is a pioneering CSR brand in the fragrance world, implementing a number of innovative practices to the sector, in terms of eco-design, circularity, formulation, and, above all, a direct involvement in the agricultural production of perfume plants. This unique creative approach has been recognised by a number of prestigious cosmetics industry awards since the brand was launched in 2023.|Jovoy Paris",
