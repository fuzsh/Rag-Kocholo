technical field of agricultural insecticide, more particularly to a kind of bisabolane type sequiterpene Application of the class compound in anti-eliminate aphis.\n\nBackground technology\n\nPulse family (Leguminosae sp.) is dicotyledon arbor, shrub, undershrub or draft, uprightly or is climbed up by holding on to, and is had There is important economic implications, be one of starch, protein, oil and important sources of vegetables in human food.Broad bean (Vicia Faba L.), also known as broad bean etc., pulse family, Vetch, annual herb, nutritive value enrich, and edible, can also raise Material, green manure and nectariferous plant plantation.For grain, vegetables and feed, green manure dual-purpose crop.\n\nAphis craccivora (Aphis craccivora Koch, 1854), legume of mainly causing harm, host plant are peanut, brocade A variety of legumes such as chicken, soybean, wild alfalfa, locust tree, broad bean, mung bean, it is the important pests of broad bean, alfalfa, Kidney bean.Winter Season is survived the winter on perennial root herbaceous plant with ovum, is often largely occurred in 5~June, is caused growing point to wither, and spire diminishes, children Branch bending, stops growing, and when occurring serious, plant is dead in flakes, often results in underproduction loss.\n\nPreventing and treating for aphis craccivora, get used to applying the high poison organophosphorus pesticides such as flolimat for a long time in production, it is not only Environment is polluted, kills natural enemy, and the resistance to the action of a drug of insect is also more and more stronger., can frequently using insecticide control aphid The problem of poisonous residual and environmental pollution can be caused, is, it is necessary to the biological pesticide available for pest control of safety.With Environmental Law Rule and the reinforcement of Public environmental attitude, it is also more and more stronger to the demand of few agricultural product with or without chemical residue.Plant source Agricultural chemicals with low-residual, low toxicity or it is nontoxic, be not likely to produce the features such as resistance to the action of a drug and favored by people.From living resources, especially Effective bioactive substance is found in plant resources and is developed into novel pesticide, it has also become an important channel of pesticide developing.\n\nTurmeric (Curcuma longa L.) is the root of zingiberaceous plant.For clinical parts of generic medicinal plants, belong to perennial herb Plant.Curcumin in turmeric
