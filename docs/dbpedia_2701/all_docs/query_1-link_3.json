It has a warm, sweet, and balsamic fragrance with spicy undertones. The aroma is often described as resinous, earthy, and slightly honey-like.\n\nTraditional Uses: Sweet Myrrh has a history of traditional use in various cultures, particularly in traditional medicine and perfumery. It has been used for its aromatic and medicinal properties. In traditional practices, it has been used to promote respiratory health, soothe digestive discomfort, and support overall well-being.\n\nAromatherapy and Perfumery: Sweet Myrrh is highly valued in perfumery for its unique and complex aroma. It is often used as a base note in fragrance compositions, adding depth, warmth, and a resinous character. In aromatherapy, the warm and comforting scent of Sweet Myrrh is believed to promote relaxation, relieve stress, and enhance emotional balance.\n\nMedicinal Properties: Sweet Myrrh is known to possess certain medicinal properties. It is believed to have anti-inflammatory, expectorant, and antispasmodic effects. In traditional medicine, it has been used to support respiratory health, ease coughs, and soothe digestive issues.\n\nIt's important to note that while Sweet Myrrh has a history of traditional use, scientific research on its specific effects and mechanisms of action is limited.
