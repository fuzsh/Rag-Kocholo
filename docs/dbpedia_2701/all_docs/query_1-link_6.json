Because the plant source is closely related, Opoponax shares many of the same properties as Myrrh. It's commonly used in perfumery, incense, and herbal remedies. Though not a true absolute, it is a sweet, very thick material, extracted with alcohol from a hydrocarbon solvent extracted resinoid. It's worth noting that this material may require a hot water bath before blending."
