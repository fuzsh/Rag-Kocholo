Pure Commiphora Erethraea essential oil.

Opoponax (also spelled Opopanax) is a member of the same family as myrrh and is often called sweet myrrh. It is a small tree that grows in Somalia. It has been a component of incense and perfumes since Biblical times and is likely the myrrh spoken of in the Song of Solomon. In magic, it is associated with the Death card in Tarot, Scorpio, and Mars. Crowley described its scent as “an overpowering richness of the deliciously abominable."

It is traditionally used in perfumery and occasionally as a flavouring in liqueurs for its intensely sweet, balsamic, spicy, and warm odour, somewhat reminiscent of wine residue. In magic, it has been used for protection and purification.
