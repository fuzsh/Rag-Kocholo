        "text": "About Harriet Tubman\n\nThe Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway recounts the life story of Harriet Tubman – freedom seeker, Underground Railroad conductor, abolitionist, suffragist, human rights activist, and one of Maryland’s most famous daughters. Born around 1822 in Dorchester County on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, Tubman is one of the most lauded, recognized, and revered figures in American history.\n\nHer life and legacy will be shared even more widely if and when the new U.S. $20 bill is unveiled; a new design may feature her likeness. If so, then Harriet Tubman would become the first woman and first African American on U.S. paper currency.\n\nA courageous leader\n\nThe middle child of nine enslaved siblings, Harriet Tubman was raised by parents who struggled against great odds to keep their family together. She overcame a severe disability, maturing into an expert hunter, lumberjack, and fieldworker. Her prowess prepared her for the dangerous path she’d pursue as an adult.\n\n“We think we know Harriet Tubman: former slave, Underground Railroad conductor and abolitionist. But much of Tubman’s real life story has been shrouded by generations of myths and fake lore, propagated through children’s books, that has only obscured her great achievements. The truth about the woman who will become the new face of the $20 bill is far more compelling and remarkable.”\n\n— Kate Clifford Larson, author of Bound for the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman: Portrait of an American Hero,\n\nKate Clifford Larson, author of the respected biography of Harriet Tubman called Bound for the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman: Portrait of an American Hero, points out myths and facts about Harriet Tubman’s life. We include some of the myths here, with permission of the author.\n\nLearn Harriet Tubman’s Story at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center\n\nThe Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center opened to the public in March 2017 in Church Creek on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Harriet Tubman, who grew up in slavery in Dorchester County, lived, worked, and worshipped in places near the visitor center. It’s from this area that she first escaped slavery, and where she returned about 13 times over a decade, risking her life time and again to lead some 70 friends and family members to freedom. To carry out the dangerous missions, she used the Underground Railroad, a secret network of places and people.\n\nLocation: 4068 Golden Hill Rd., Church Creek, MD\n\nHours: For the latest information, click here.\n\nAdmission: Admission to the visitor center is free, but donations are welcome\n\nFor more info: Tubman Visitor Center website, 410-221-2290, or htursp.dnr@maryland.gov.\n\nLocated near Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and about 25 minutes from Cambridge, Maryland, the beautiful visitor center includes an exhibit hall with powerful and thought-provoking multimedia exhibits, a theater, and gift shop. The visitor center is on the grounds of a 17-acre state park with short walking trails. There’s also a large picnic pavilion with a stone fireplace that’s available for rental. The visitor center is a joint operation between the Maryland Park Service and the National Park Service.\n\nThe visitor center is one of more than 30 sites of historical significance along the Maryland portion of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, a self-guided, scenic driving tour. Many of the exhibits include specific sites along the Tubman Byway where you can experience more of the stories.\n\nNOTE: The Tubman Visitor Center is different than the Harriet Tubman Museum & Educational Center, which has been in existence for more than 20 years and is run by dedicated volunteers in downtown Cambridge. The museum’s founders helped keep Tubman’s legacy alive.\n\nFind out more about the Tubman Visitor Center on the Tubman Visitor Center website, or contact them at 410-221-2290 or htursp.dnr@maryland.gov.\n\nHarriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park\n\nAn executive order in March 2013 established Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument and marked the landscape of Dorchester County, Maryland for its historical significance to Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad. At the creation of Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park a year later, the National Park Service identified land in Dorchester, Talbot, and Caroline Counties for potential future acquisition. The Conservation Fund donated the only land currently owned by the National Park Service—480 acres at the Jacob Jackson site, the home of a free African American who delivered a message for Tubman that she was returning to guide her brothers to freedom.\n\nThe National Park Service also administers a sister park in Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn, New York, where Harriet Tubman lived in her later years.\n\nPassport to your National Parks stamps are available at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center.\n\nFind out more about the park."
