Having lived on my own for so long, I have developed a passion for cooking. I love sharing a delicious meal with friends and family. Besides cooking, my other hobbies are learning about various tech and software, following stock market trends, and investing. I learned to play the guitar when I was 14, and I have some very nice electric guitars that I have been ignoring for a while now.

Outside of medicine, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, trying out new recipes, and taking on Pinterest projects.\n\nACADEMIC HIGHLIGHT: Graduating medical school with highest honors.\n\nWHY EISENHOWER HEALTH?

As a first-generation college student and the first physician in my family, I was raised in a home that emphasized hard work and caring for others as an act of love and service. I was fortunate enough to find mentors early in my undergraduate career that shaped these core values while serving the community through a career in the medical field. Outside of medicine, I like to travel and pick up new creative hobbies constantly, including drawing, painting, and cosplaying. I also love board games and am continuously searching for new games.\n\nACADEMIC HIGHLIGHT: Spending a summer on the cliffs of Northern California studying Pacific seabirds to aid in forest conservation efforts with the Federal Bureau of Land Management.

Even a physician (light years away in Australia) speaks highly of the area: “Well, you’ll be in an area that’s close to like-minded people who prioritize a good lifestyle.” All this for 3 years?

I love hanging out with my family and friends, completing escape rooms, watching 90 day Fiancé, online shopping and decorating my house!\n\nACADEMIC HIGHLIGHT: During medical school, I had to move to 4 different states and a whole new country.

Aka, MD\n\nRESIDENCY PROGRAM: Internal Medicine\n\nHOMETOWN: Buea Southwest Region Cameroon\n\nUNDERGRADUATE: Oakland University\n\nMEDICAL SCHOOL: St. George’s University School of Medicine\n\nABOUT ME: I was born and raised in Buea, Cameroon, and moved to the United States with my family. After undergrad, I worked as a Clinical Research Associate for two years in the Department of Structural Heart Cardiology where my love for cardiology started. Some of my core values are diversity and mental wellness in medicine. Outside of medicine, I enjoy cooking, journaling, traveling and I have sort of an obsession with self-help books and podcasts.\n\nACADEMIC HIGHLIGHT: First, I have been published in the Journal of the Americal College of Cardiology. I aspire to be a Cardiologist, so this gives me a headstart in the specialty I love. Secondly, leadership was also a big part of my academic journey, being part of the executive board of the student government at SGU and for our region of the Student National Medical Association (SNMA). Lastly, my top academic highlight must be matching into my #1 residency program.\n\nWHY EISENHOWER HEALTH: During the interview season, I was looking for a program where I would have the perfect balance of supervised autonomy.

My passion for medicine comes from my mom. Her fascination with medicine and her many careers within the medical field inspired my journey from an early age. Prior to medical school, I worked in hospitals as well as on an ambulance for a number of years. Outside of medicine, I love to lap swim and I also love to sing. In my free time you’ll find me exploring new places in California (like Huell Howser in California’s Gold). A favorite recent experience was visiting an alpaca farm in Santa Barbara!\n\nACADEMIC HIGHLIGHT: Studying medicine in the beautiful country of Saint Maarten!\n\nWHY EISENHOWER HEALTH: It was clear to me after my visit to Eisenhower, I was where I was meant to be.

I took a longer road to medical school, first working as an EMT, then as a Clinical Research Coordinator at a top cancer center in the nation, and managing a non-profit for a rare genetic disorder before deciding to pursue a career as a physician. I’m an avid sports fan (Go Warriors!) and enjoy “managing my fake teams” as my wife calls it, for both the football and basketball fantasy seasons (and anything else I can sneak in). I’ve loved getting to travel the world with my wife, but now look forward to the lively days at home with our daughter. In whatever spare time I can find I usually opt for a video game or a book, hopefully enjoyed with a good beer. When the weather is amenable, I also enjoy teeing it up with close friends on a picturesque golf course.\n\nACADEMIC HIGHLIGHT: I was focused and dedicated during my time in medical school, earning myself a Sigma Sigma Phi Honor Society membership, but one of my favorite memories during medical school was working with our mobile diabetes education program to develop and record training videos for other students. My wife, a nurse, and I were able to record these videos that are now being used so that incoming medical students are able to quickly train and then help patients in an underserved community learn about and manage their diabetes – hopefully leaving a lasting impact.\n\nWHY EISENHOWER HEALTH: I promised my wife (a Los Angeles native) I would at least consider moving back down to Southern California for Residency, and after my interview with Eisenhower Health I realized how fortunate I would be to complete my residency training here. Their state-of-the-art facilities and commitment to the community will help me to grow professionally and personally as a physician during my time here. The 100+ golf courses didn’t hurt either.\n\nSpencer Freed, MD\n\nRESIDENCY PROGRAM: Internal Medicine\n\nHOMETOWN: Auburn, CA United States\n\nUNDERGRADUATE: Weimar University\n\nMEDICAL SCHOOL: Loma Linda University School of Medicine\n\nABOUT ME: I love international travel, both for leisure and for missions—up to 16 countries now!

My favorite adventure so far has been pursuing a career in medicine.\n\nACADEMIC HIGHLIGHT: Being inducted into the Gold Humanism Honor Society during my transitional year of residency.\n\nWHY EISENHOWER HEALTH: I was blown away on interview day by how friendly and personable the attendings were at Eisenhower! You could tell by their demeanor and by the way the program is set up that resident success in and outside of the hospital was a top priority. It also doesn’t hurt to have world class golf across the street.\n\nZahra Ghafarzadeh, MD\n\nRESIDENCY PROGRAM: Internal Medicine\n\nHOMETOWN: Isfahan, Iran\n\nUNDERGRADUATE: N/A\n\nMEDICAL SCHOOL: Isfahan University of Medical Sciences\n\nABOUT ME: Born and raised in Iran, in a family where both of my parents were studying and teaching all the time, and I remember myself growing up between their books! My real interest in medicine is rooted in human connection and I have been always honored to be able to interact with patients from different walks of life. Can not imagine myself without medicine but try my best to make a good balance between my work and my personal life. Out of work, I enjoy gardening and cooking with vegetables that we grow in our garden, hiking, road trips, spending time with friends and family, reading Persian poetry books, and recently as a new mom started to write for my baby girl. The biggest gift of my life is my family and the newly added little one is a real blessing.\n\nACADEMIC HIGHLIGHT: Graduated from Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. When I finished medical school, I felt I need to do something different and went to rural areas to practice independently as a PCP for two years; The experience was humanly and educationally deep. Had two years of research experience and hope to do more. Matched into my favorite residency program. Although after two clinical observerships in cardiology my interest in this field started to bloom, I am going to discover my real field of interest in IM in the next 3 years.\n\nWHY EISENHOWER HEALTH: Eisenhower was one of my best observership experiences, gave me a real sense of being an Internal Medicine resident in the future and I realized how much I am excited to join such a great and professional team.

I recently graduated from Saint James School of Medicine, and I’m excited to begin my residency. Having grown up in a Navy family, I’ve lived all over, which has made me adaptable and eager to meet new challenges. Even though running isn’t really my thing, I’ve pushed myself to get into it to keep my heart as healthy as I want my patients to be, all while complementing my love for soccer, basketball, and tennis. My clinical rotations in South Texas, a medically underserved area, broadened my interest in internal medicine through a diverse range of cases.

At a young age, my family moved to South Carolina to start a construction business. I worked in the family business full-time after high school. My Father specializes in building custom residential homes. I worked with him on all aspects of building a house. I enjoyed the creativity, the challenge, and spending time outdoors. After almost losing my thumb and having spent a week as a patient in the hospital, the trajectory of my life shifted dramatically. I had been preparing to take over my family’s construction business. I reflect on my accident now and know it was the catalyst that prompted me to change careers and dedicate myself to medicine. Apart from medicine, I love to cook, travel, read, watch movies, and discover arts and culture.\n\nACADEMIC HIGHLIGHT: I began medical school one year before the pandemic started. When the island of Antigua closed its airport in March 2020, I returned to Palm Springs and transitioned to mostly online studies. Despite the challenges, I completed my clinical rotations at six locations in Southern California. Graduating from medical school, I was excited to be matched into my top-choice program at Eisenhower Medical Center, which I consider a significant achievement.\n\nWHY EISENHOWER HEALTH: During my interview, I was impressed with the commitment of the faculty and staff to provide a supportive and friendly learning environment.

Having a physician for a mother, I’ve learned that compassion is the essence of caregiving in medicine. Beyond medicine, you’ll find me petting every dog I encounter, reading, cooking, exploring culinary delights, and lifting heavy weights. Singing and sunscreen are essentials for my daily life, and I cherish spending time with my family and friends.\n\nACADEMIC HIGHLIGHT: After graduating with honors, I began teaching clinical biochemistry and pathophysiology workshops at my former university while also volunteering in my community. One experience that deeply impacted me was leading health workshops for sheltered women survivors of violence at CAVIM in Mexicali. My mission was to equip women with public and reproductive health knowledge, and my reward was to be a part of their well-being empowerment while strengthening my advocacy for the vulnerable.\n\nWHY EISENHOWER HEALTH: My decision to join Eisenhower Medical Center for my Internal Medicine residency was immediate upon experiencing its welcoming atmosphere and sense of family during my observership. Eisenhower Health’s dedication to comprehensive patient care and culture of continuous growth resonates deeply with my values and aspirations. Moreover, its proximity to home adds a comforting warmth, making it the ideal environment for me to thrive as a physician and make a meaningful impact.\n\nMoza Hamoud, MD\n\nHOMETOWN: Mombasa, Kenya\n\nUNDERGRADUATE SCHOOL: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nMEDICAL SCHOOL: St. George’s University School of Medicine\n\nABOUT ME: I grew up in the vibrant island of Mombasa, Kenya, went to college in the heart of North Carolina, medical school in the beautiful, blue-waters-white-sand, spice island of Grenada, and settled in the diverse landscapes of California. My mom’s battle with cancer opened my eyes to healthcare inequalities and ignited my commitment to bridging these gaps. Now, drawn to internal medicine, I aim to pursue a fellowship in heme/onc, where I hope to use my detective-like skills to address healthcare disparities and make a real difference in people’s lives. When I’m not with loved ones, traveling, or cooking, I enjoy escape rooms and board games, especially ones that involve solving murder mystery case files. If I weren’t a doctor, I’d surely be a detective or a lawyer.\n\nACADEMIC HIGHLIGHT: My academic highlight is navigating across continents for education, experiencing diverse transitions from Mombasa to North Carolina, to Grenada, and then to Orange County, CA, even amidst a pandemic. Now matched at my favorite program at Eisenhower Health with yet another move to Palm Desert, CA, ahead. Will also be graduating from medical school with distinction in research. I am so grateful for this journey.\n\nWHY EISENHOWER HEALTH: Honestly, it’s the people. Being close to home was a bonus, but the program gave me a sense of peace. Residents were approachable and seemed happy, attendings are hands-on yet allow autonomy with support, and the program has a strong track record of residents matching into competitive fellowships. Everyone was so nice during the interview, and after it, I texted my family, “we are moving to Palm Desert”. Imagine my excitement on Match Day when I learned that the feeling was mutual 🙂 <3\n\nSameera Haq, MD\n\nHOMETOWN: Santa Clarita, CA United States\n\nUNDERGRADUATE SCHOOL: University of California, Irvine\n\nMEDICAL SCHOOL: N/A\n\nABOUT ME: I’m a true California girl at heart, born and raised in SoCal, with Santa Clarita being my hometown.

Internal Medicine captivates me due to its broad range of acute and chronic conditions, as well as its collaborative approach involving multidisciplinary teams.
