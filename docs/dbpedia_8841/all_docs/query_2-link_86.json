        "text": "Andy Murray's illustrious career has drawn to a close following his quarter-final exit, alongside partner Dan Evans, in the men's doubles at the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe pair had previously staged an incredible comeback from five match points down to defeat Kei Nishikori and Taro Daniel of Japan in the first round. This was followed by another nail-biting victory over Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen in the second round.\n\nThe British duo clinched their quarter-final spot after overcoming two match points against their Belgian rivals - and missing two of their own - with Evans' triumphant smash winner sparking jubilant celebrations from both men.\n\nREAD MORE: More freedom for players and one base - how Manchester United learnt lessons for their pre-season tour\n\nREAD MORE: Ederson out with Costa in, £50million sales, and Olmo coup - Man City's dream transfer window conclusion\n\nDespite his departure in Paris, Murray already boasts an impressive array of Olympic medals. He previously struck gold in the men's singles at London and Rio, and secured silver alongside Laura Robson in the 2012 mixed doubles.\n\nWithout a doubt, Murray's achievements on the court are remarkable, with 46 titles under his belt, including two Wimbledon and one US Open championship, as well as his Olympic triumphs. However, as one of Britain's most successful and talked-about athletes, there has been considerable interest in Murray's personal life throughout his career.\n\nFollowing his final match, we take a closer look at Murray's life away from the court, delving into his staggering net worth and unexpected split from wife Kim.\n\nAs one of the most successful players in history, Andy Murray has amassed a staggering personal fortune, raking in over £50million in prize money alone throughout his illustrious career.\n\nHis earnings are further boosted by substantial income from endorsement deals and sponsorship partnerships, teaming up with major brands like Jaguar, Castore, Under Armour and Head. Over the years, he's also partnered with other big names such as Amazon Prime Video, Standard Life and American Express.\n\nCelebrity Net Worth estimates that these deals and winnings have contributed to a net worth of around £85million. However, some sources suggest it could be closer to £100million.\n\nMurray has impressively grown his property portfolio over the years, including a luxurious home in the heart of Oxshott, Surrey. The grand residence, which he bought for more than £5million back in 2009, is just one example of his smart investments.\n\nAnother jewel in his property crown includes the opulent Cromlix House, a five-star country hotel near his hometown of Dunblane, which he bought a decade ago for £1.8million.\n\nThe sparkling sportsman's personal life often attracts as much attention as his on-court achievements. He's happily married to Kim Sears, with their love story beginning at a party during the 2005 US Open. Their relationship made headlines a year later and they tied the knot in matrimonial bliss in 2015.\n\nThe pair are parents to four children - Sophia, eight, Edie, six, Teddy, four, and Lola, three. Murray once laughingly commented in 2021 about managing an early bedtime for the whole bunch being one of his proudest achievements.\n\nAlthough their journey has seen a few bumps along the way; they briefly parted ways in 2009 before getting back together within the space of just six months. During this time, Kim kept their beloved dog Maggie and they managed to navigate through this challenging period amicably.\n\nOn reflecting about their relationship, he noted, \"I work better in a relationship. At the end of the day, especially if I've lost a match, I don't like talking about tennis, so it's nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff.\"\n\nKim, wife of tennis champion Andy Murray, is renowned for her impassioned support during his matches. Her choice words during Murray's Wimbledon semi-final win over Tomas Berdych in 2015 even made the news, when she was caught yelling: \"F****** have that you flash Czech f***\".\n\nUpon receiving a knighthood in the Queen's New Year Honours list in 2016, Andy playfully suggested that his wife, soon to be known as Lady, should temper her courtside language. \"She's going to have to [do] no more swearing during my matches any more, for any of you who saw that a few years ago,\" he teased.\n\nAndy Murray has often spoken about the joy he finds in fatherhood, even placing it above his tennis achievements. In a frank interview, he stated: ''I'd rather be getting up in the middle of the night and helping [with the kids] than winning every tennis match and her thinking when she grows up: 'Actually, you know what, he was a s****y dad but he won a lot of tennis matches so, you know, well done'.\"\n\nDespite having a close relationship with his older brother Jamie, Andy's competitive spirit has sometimes led to friction between them. A significant disagreement arose in 2008 when Andy decided to withdraw from a Great Britain Davis Cup match against Argentina to safeguard his knee from further injury - a match he would have played alongside Jamie.\n\nFollowing Andy's withdrawal, Jamie was forced to partner with Ross Hutchins for the match, which they lost. Expressing his disappointment, Jamie admitted: \"It kind of affects the way we feel about him.\" He added: \"I think it's disappointing he chose not to come.\n\n\"From what I have been reading he hasn't come out and said he's injured, it's more a prevention thing. I think if he had really wanted to push himself he could have come here for the match. It was a shock for me and for the team. I was not aware he had a problem.\n\n\"From his point of view, I guess he doesn't have anything to apologise for as he's taken the decision not to come. He would have been a formidable opponent because of his ability to win singles matches; he's a world-class player. He's been in the top 10 and not by fluke. I reckon he would have relished the challenge of having the crowd against him; he thrives under those conditions.\"\n\nAndy Murray quickly retorted to his brother's remarks, saying: \"It was a little bit disappointing. But he obviously felt pretty strongly about it and he's entitled to his opinion. If he knew what it was like playing three five-set matches in a row on clay then maybe he'd understand my position a little bit better. I've not spoken to him yet.\n\n\"I'll see him soon. I guess we'll have to have a chat about it and just discuss our feelings on Davis Cup and the sort of position that I am in, but it's probably not going to be the most fun conversation to have with your brother.\"\n\nThe siblings did not communicate for a fortnight but eventually made amends. With retirement on the horizon, Andy Murray has shared insights into his post-tennis future.\n\n\"I don't know exactly what the rest of my life will look like, but I will still stay in touch with the sport,\" he revealed in an interview at the Olympic Village before the Games. \"Initially, I want to be at home with my family. I want to spend a lot of time with my kids and my wife, so I won't be on the road much, I know that.\"\n\nMurray also hinted at a new sporting pursuit post-retirement, expressing his intent to sharpen his golf skills. He said: \"I'll play a lot of golf. I want to become a scratch golfer. I've always loved playing golf, but because of the issues with my back, I haven't played for five or six years.\"\n\nHe also mentioned the possibility of staying connected to the Olympics in a different role, although his future plans remain undecided.\n\n\"I would also love to be part of the next Olympics in some capacity, but I don't have any clear plans on what it is I'm going to do from a work perspective.\"\n\nThe tennis star, contemplating a comeback to the sport, remarked: \"I don't see myself playing any of the invitational things or those sort of events. I expect I'll still hit some balls and stuff, but when I play sport, I like to compete - whether that's in cards, golf or whatever. I want to be competitive. I don't want to just have a hit and giggle.\"\n\nHe further expressed his readiness to retire, saying: \"I know it's the right time to stop - I didn't feel that way a few months ago when I thought this is when I was going to stop but I didn't really want to, whereas now I want to - and I know that it's the right time for me, so I feel good about it.\""
