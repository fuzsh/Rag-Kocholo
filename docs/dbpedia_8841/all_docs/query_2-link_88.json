        "text": "Andy Murray's illustrious career has drawn to a close following his and partner Dan Evans' defeat in the quarter-finals of the men's doubles at the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe pair had previously staged an incredible comeback from five match points down to triumph over Kei Nishikori and Taro Daniel of Japan in the first round, and then secured another nail-biting victory against Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen in the second.\n\nThe British duo clinched their place in the quarter-finals after surviving two match points against their Belgian rivals - and squandering two of their own - with Evans' triumphant smash winner sparking jubilant celebrations from both players.\n\nDespite his departure in Paris, Murray already boasts a remarkable haul of Olympic medals. He previously struck gold in the men's singles at London and Rio, and bagged silver alongside Laura Robson in the 2012 mixed doubles, according to Wales Online.\n\nThere's no denying that Murray's achievements on the court are extraordinary, with 46 titles under his belt, including two Wimbledon and one US Open championship, not to mention his Olympic successes. However, as one of Britain's most celebrated and talked-about athletes, there has been considerable fascination with Murray's personal life throughout his career, reports Nottinghamshire Live.\n\nFollowing the final match of his career, we take a closer look at Murray's life away from the tennis court, delving into his staggering net worth and unexpected split from wife Kim.\n\nAs one of the most successful players in history, Murray has amassed a staggering personal fortune, raking in over £50million in prize money alone throughout his illustrious career.\n\nHis earnings are further boosted by substantial income from endorsement deals and sponsorship partnerships, teaming up with big names like Jaguar, Castore, Under Armour and Head. Over the years, he's also partnered with other major brands such as Amazon Prime Video, Standard Life and American Express.\n\nCelebrity Net Worth estimates that these deals and winnings have contributed to a net worth of around £85million. However, some sources suggest it could be closer to £100million.\n\nTennis star Sir Andy Murray has impressively grown his property portfolio over the years, including a luxurious residence in the heart of Oxshott, Surrey. The grand home, which he bought for over £5million back in 2009, is just one example of his smart investments.\n\nAnother jewel in his property crown includes the opulent Cromlix House, a five-star country hotel near his hometown of Dunblane, which he bought a decade ago for £1.8million.\n\nThe sparkling sportsman's personal life often attracts as much attention as his on-court achievements. He's happily married to Kim Sears, with their love story beginning at a party during the 2005 US Open.\n\nTheir relationship made headlines a year later and they tied the knot in wedded bliss in 2015.\n\nAndy Murray and his wife Kim's bustling family life now includes four children - Sophia, eight, Edie, six, Teddy, four, and three year old Lola. The tennis star has previously joked that getting the whole brood to bed early is among his most significant achievements, a light-hearted comment he made during a conversation in 2021.\n\nThe couple's journey hasn't been without its challenges; they briefly split in 2009 after being together in the public eye for some time. However, even during this period, Kim kept custody of their beloved dog Maggie, and love prevailed as they reunited within six months.\n\nDiscussing the importance of his relationship, Murray revealed, \"I work better in a relationship. At the end of the day, especially if I've lost a match, I don't like talking about tennis, so it's nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff.\"\n\nKim, known for her fervent support during Andy's matches, famously caught attention with her colourful language at Wimbledon's semi-final in 2015 against Tomas Berdych, where she was overheard shouting: \"F****** have that you flash Czech f***\".\n\nFollowing Andy Murray's knighthood in the Queen's New Year Honours list in 2016, he humorously commented on Kim's need to moderate her courtside language, now that she would be a Lady. \"She's going to have to [do] no more swearing during my matches any more, for any of you who saw that a few years ago,\" he said with a chuckle.\n\nMurray has often spoken about the joy he finds in fatherhood, even prioritising it over his tennis career. In a frank interview, he stated: ''I'd rather be getting up in the middle of the night and helping [with the kids] than winning every tennis match and her thinking when she grows up: 'Actually, you know what, he was a s****y dad but he won a lot of tennis matches so, you know, well done'.\n\nDespite having a close relationship with his older brother Jamie, Andy Murray's competitive spirit has occasionally led to tension between them. A significant disagreement occurred in 2008 when Murray decided to withdraw from a Great Britain Davis Cup match against Argentina to protect his knee from further injury - a match he would have played alongside Jamie.\n\nFollowing his younger brother's withdrawal, Jamie was forced to partner with Ross Hutchins for the match, which they did not win. Expressing his disappointment, Jamie admitted: \"It kind of affects the way we feel about him.\"\n\nHe added: \"I think it's disappointing he chose not to come.\"\n\n\"From what I have been reading he hasn't come out and said he's injured, it's more a prevention thing. I think if he had really wanted to push himself he could have come here for the match.\"\n\n\"It was a shock for me and for the team. I was not aware he had a problem.\"\n\n\"From his point of view, I guess he doesn't have anything to apologise for as he's taken the decision not to come.\"\n\nFeud with brotherDespite a strong bond with his elder brother Jamie, Andy Murray's competitive nature has occasionally caused tension between them. A notable rift occurred in 2008 after Murray chose to pull out of a Great Britain Davis Cup match against Argentina to protect his knee from further injurya match he would have competed in with Jamie.\n\nIn the wake of his younger brother's withdrawal, Jamie was compelled to team up with Ross Hutchins for the match, which they did not win. Expressing his frustration, Jamie confessed: \"He would have been a formidable opponent because of his ability to win singles matches; he's a world-class player.\"\n\n\"He's been in the top 10 and not by fluke. I reckon he would have relished the challenge of having the crowd against him; he thrives under those conditions.\"\n\nAndy swiftly replied to what was said about him: \"It was a little bit disappointing. But he obviously felt pretty strongly about it and he's entitled to his opinion.\"\n\n\"If he knew what it was like playing three five-set matches in a row on clay then maybe he'd understand my position a little bit better. I've not spoken to him yet.\"\n\n\"I'll see him soon. I guess we'll have to have a chat about it and just discuss our feelings on Davis Cup and the sort of position that I am in, but it's probably not going to be the most fun conversation to have with your brother.\"\n\nFollowing a period of silence lasting a fortnight, the brothers buried the hatchet. As his playing days are winding down, Andy Murray has started contemplating his future off the court.\n\nAmidst the buzz of the Olympic Village before the Games, he shared some insights into his post-tennis plans: \"I don't know exactly what the rest of my life will look like, but I will still stay in touch with the sport,\" and went on to detail his desire for a more settled life, saying, \"Initially, I want to be at home with my family. I want to spend a lot of time with my kids and my wife, so I won't be on the road much, I know that.\"\n\n\"Murray also hinted at a new sporting pursuit post-retirement, expressing his intent to sharpen his golf skills.\"\n\n\"I'll play a lot of golf.\"\n\nBut as one sporting chapter closes, another may open for Murray, as he revealed plans to dedicate time to improving his skills on the golf course once his tennis career concludes. \"\".\n\n\"I want to become a scratch golfer. I've always loved playing golf, but because of the issues with my back, I haven't played for five or six years.\"\n\n\"He also mentioned the possibility of staying connected to the Olympics in a different role, although his future plans remain undecided.\"\n\n\"I would also love to be part of the next Olympics in some capacity, but I don't have any clear plans on what it is I'm going to do from a work perspective.\"\n\nThe tennis star, contemplating a comeback to the sport, remarked: \"I don't see myself playing any of the invitational things or those sort of events.\"\n\n\"I expect I'll still hit some balls and stuff, but when I play sport, I like to compete - whether that's in cards, golf or whatever. I want to be competitive.\"\n\n\"I don't want to just have a hit and giggle.\"\n\nHe further expressed his readiness to retire, saying, \"I know it's the right time to stop - I didn't feel that way a few months ago when I thought this is when I was going to stop but I didn't really want to, whereas now I want to - and I know that it's the right time for me, so I feel good about it.\""
