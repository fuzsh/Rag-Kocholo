        "text": "What do you enjoy about being a barber? People make the highlights of my career. Over 30+ years, I’ve managed to meet and interact with many amazing people, ranging from war veterans to sporting stars, celebrities and good, honest, hard-working people.\n\nWhat are the challenges of running your own business? Post-Covid has brought some challenges along with it, and running a business in the current climate has meant diversifying and changing the way we work. Over 90 per cent of our work is now booked, as opposed to the only walk-in ways of pre-Covid.\n\nYou’ve got lots of Formula 1 caps in your shop, how did the collection develop? Over the years, clients who’ve worked directly with F1 or in the motorsports industry have passed on some memorabilia, kindly and caringly donated, and from the first donation, the collection only grew larger!\n\nWho is your favourite F1 driver and why? My favourite has to be the second-time world champion, Fernando Alonso, of Aston Martin. At age 42, he’s still competitive with the new and upcoming racers, while also managing to put up a fight with the seasoned champions.\n\nHow do you like to spend your free time? I love to spend time with friends and family and also enjoy the recreational facilities and benefits of the coast mentioned previously, including, but not limited to, walking, cycling, Saturday football, golfing and a night up at Club Vista playing snooker and pool. One might describe me as a very active person.\n\nWhat are your biggest pet peeves? People who can’t put their rubbish in a bin or take it home with them, those who tailgate, and people who drive at night with no lights on whatsoever. Those people really wind me up.\n\nPeople might not know but ... I’m a spin instructor at CityFitness, and I’ve worked in Maclean St for 27 years.\n\nWhat is your guilty pleasure? I was brought up with my father working for Rowntree Mackintosh (a chocolate and sweets factory), which was famous for producing many well-known confectionery, like Kit Kat, Smarties, Quality Street and Yorkie bars, so naturally, I may have a sweet tooth.\n\nThe most memorable Norwich City FC game you’ve seen? Bayern Munich vs Norwich at Munich’s Olympiastadion in the second round of the Uefa Cup in 1993. With a goal from Mark Bowen and an excellent volley from Jeremy Gross (considered the best goal in Norwich’s history), the visitors won 2-1. It was the first time Bayern Munich had lost against an English team on home turf, a record held for a long while. I watched it in a pub.\n\nWhat does it take to be a long-term Canaries [Norwich City] supporter? Norwich City and West Bromwich Albion in the last decade have both been promoted and relegated in the English Premier League, requiring a lot of patience and unwavering support and determination for the team.\n\nDescribe competing in the Lake Tāupo Cycle Challenge enduro (320km) in 2015. It started at 1.30am. It was a mild 16 degrees, rain was light and there was no wind. My first lap was too fast and, in a group of five, I covered the first 150 kilometres in just under 5½ hours. A burst appendix three months earlier meant my training was a little under par. It wasn’t enough to support me the last 170km. Having cycled that distance, 120km alone, the physical and mental challenge makes you find out a lot about your inner self. Just before Tūrangi, a 12-strong Polynesian group, raising mental health awareness, picked me up on their own enduro challenge, as one of them. We finished together in a very emotional and inspiring finish, supported by my friends and family. It was mentally and physically exhausting, to say the least.\n\nWhat’s your go-to local eatery? Trusty Sunlong Takeaways next door. A bacon, egg and cheese burger, for lunch on a long day, and good old fish and chips for the family. Another trusty one is Ben’s Roasts, for my wife. The occasional Thai and Indian as well.\n\nAdvice to my younger self would be ... Embrace change. Believe in yourself. Some people aren’t always as they seem. Be ready and prepared for anything."
