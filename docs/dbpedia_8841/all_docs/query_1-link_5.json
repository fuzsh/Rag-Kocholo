We start early and as simple as possible and build upon it.”\n\n“Educating the youth of our nation is vital to prepare them for the roles they will step into in the future—as leaders, teachers, parents, and citizens. An understanding of finance and economic principles provides a foundation on which they can grow through high school, college, and beyond.”"
