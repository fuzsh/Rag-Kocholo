        "text": "American online streamer (born 2000)\n\nThis article is about the streamer. For the rugby player, see Aidan Ross.\n\nAdin David Ross (born October 11, 2000) is an American internet personality and online streamer. He is known for his collaborations with celebrities and livestreams of the NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto V video games.[5] He previously streamed on Twitch, from which he was permanently banned in 2023. The same year, he signed a deal with Kick.[6]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nAdin David Ross was born to Jewish parents on October 11, 2000, in Boca Raton, Florida.[7] He moved to New York City for a brief period of time, but decided to live in Three Rivers, California.[8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nRoss began regularly streaming on Twitch while living with his sister Naomi.[9] He eventually joined an NBA 2K group called Always Excelling and met basketball player Bronny James through it. He gained popularity by playing NBA 2K20 with James and doing wager matches with other streamers and YouTubers.[10]\n\nAfter influencer Andrew Tate was arrested in Romania on December 29, 2022,[11][12] five people had been authorized to visit Tate in detention, including Ross, who said he was flying to Romania,[13] but was denied access by the Romanian government.[14] In March 2024, Ross said that Tate had told him he would leave the country soon, resulting in Tate and his brother Tristan being arrested to prevent them from fleeing the country.[15][16] He later apologized to Tate during a livestream, saying that he \"really really effed up\".[17]\n\nIn 2023, shortly before his permanent Twitch ban, Ross began streaming on Kick. He generated controversy for livestreaming Super Bowl LVII[18] and opening the Pornhub website while streaming.[19]\n\nOn March 4, 2024, Ross dared a 19-year-old man to drive his car into the Burrard Inlet at Rocky Point Park in Port Moody, Canada. After the police were notified, the man was arrested at the scene. The incident received negative attention from those who visit the park.[20][21][22]\n\nRoss has hosted white supremacist Nick Fuentes on his show.[23]\n\nIn August 2024, Ross interviewed former president Donald Trump on his stream and told his viewers to vote for Trump in the upcoming 2024 election.[23][24] The stream had more than 500,000 concurrent viewers at its peak.[25]\n\nTwitch bans\n\n[edit]\n\nOn April 10, 2021, Ross was banned from Twitch after YouTuber Zias answered a phone call and Ross called Zias a homophobic slur.[26] Ross defended himself from the ban by saying to Twitch staff that he did not say the word and was not in the room at the time. Twitch clarified that based on this information he would be allowed to stream.[27] His followers started trending the hashtag #FreeAdin on Twitter in an attempt to pressure Twitch's decision.[28] His ban was lifted on April 12, 2021.[29]\n\nOver a year later, on April 20, 2022, Ross was banned indefinitely due to the use of \"hateful slurs or symbols\".[30] He was able to resume streaming in June 2022.[31]\n\nRoss was banned from Twitch for the eighth time on February 25, 2023, this time permanently, for \"hateful conduct\", after he showed his unmoderated Kick live chat on stream, which was flooded with racist and antisemitic messages by viewers.[32]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of most-followed Twitch channels\n\nList of YouTubers"
