        "text": "The interchange of Interstate 40 and U.S. 15-501 in Durham is set to be renamed after its dedication to a longtime U.S. representative on Tuesday.\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Transportation held a ceremony at Chapel Hill Town Hall to dedicate the area exiting the interstate and entering the highway to former Congressman David Price of North Carolina’s District 4 as a token of appreciation for his work bringing transportation and transit updates to the region during his three decades of service.\n\nPrice, who retired from Congress in 2022, represented the Chapel Hill and Durham communities across 17 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition to his work in Washington D.C., Price also taught as a faculty member at Duke and is a longtime Chapel Hill resident after having graduated from the university in 1961.\n\nAmong the many speakers and dignitaries were Price’s congressional peers, NCDOT officials, Chapel Hill Mayor Jess Anderson, and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. Cooper said he was honored to call Price a friend, and detailed how the pair worked together through Cooper’s various positions within state government while Price served decades in Congress. The governor added he believed the dedication to be a fitting tribute because of Price’s focus on keeping transportation at the forefront of legislation – and keeping people’s needs in mind.\n\n“[David] is obviously brilliant — we know that from his professorial background,” said Cooper said of Price. “But he’s a lot more than that. He is compassionately brilliant. What I mean is that he knew that every amendment, every markup of a bill, every detail in complex legislation, ends up affecting the lives of people.\n\n“When people get frustrated with politics, with people running for office,” continued the governor, “and if you feel like it doesn’t matter any more… There are people who you can stop and think about, and bring you back to say, ‘Wait a minute. There are people who are in this for the right reason. There are people who truly care about the positive effects that government has on people — when can government stay out the way, when government can get involved, and do good things for people.’ This is a man who kept that [sentiment] at the forefront.”\n\nPrice’s positions with the Committee on Appropriations and the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies allowed him to advocate for significant transportation projects and funding not just to his district, but much of North Carolina. Speakers on Tuesday estimated billions of dollars of value coming into the state based on the results.\n\nAfter the rest of the speakers and before the unveiling of the sign, Price joked about his choice of intersections. He said while it may soon need to be reconfigured for better traffic flow, it holds a special place in his heart for its overlap of his district and home.\n\n“I’ve driven it hundreds of times,” said the former congressman. “I know that intersection — and I also know that when I pass that intersection, I’m only five minutes away from home. It’s an intersection at the junction of Durham and Chapel Hill… of UNC and Duke and NC Central… of so much that has meant a lot to me; and wonderful, supportive communities that I’ve represented for many years.”\n\nSee a photo gallery below of Tuesday’s ceremony in Chapel Hill Town Hall.\n\nChapelboro.com does not charge subscription fees, and you can directly support our efforts in local journalism here.
