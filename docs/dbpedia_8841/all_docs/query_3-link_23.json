        "text": "Hi everyone - It's been 4 months, and I'm still searching for a new role and would really appreciate your support. I‚Äôm eager to bring my expertise, skills, and experience to a great company that needs a senior level leader. About me: üíº I‚Äôm looking for Senior Manager/Director and above or Lead/Principal IC roles in Community, Scaled/Digital Customer Success, or Customer Marketing. üåé I‚Äôve worked remotely since 2012 and would like to continue to do so. If a company happens to be based in San Diego, I'm open to a hybrid or onsite role. ‚≠ê I‚Äôve previously worked at Fivetran, RollWorks, Hitachi Vantara, and Digital River. I‚Äôd love to reconnect with you, share my experience, and catch up on what‚Äôs new in your world. If you hear of any opportunities that you think are worth looking into, or are open to chatting, send me a message or comment below! #OpenToWork\n\nAs more companies have adopted the product-led growth motion and now offer free or low-cost entry-level pricing for their B2B SaaS products, the need to support these customers at scale has also increased. Of course we love ALL of our customers, but offering CSM support for every account isn't sustainable from a business perspective. We also have to make tough decisions about technical support packages and SLAs. How much (and what form of) support can we offer users who don't pay to use our product? Digital customer success is on the rise, which encompasses low-touch, 1-to-many programs designed to drive product adoption, renewals, and expansion. Getting it right requires careful orchestration (and lots of cat herding) across product, customer success, revenue operations, and marketing. Community professionals have been doing this work for quite some time, although it may not be labeled as such at the moment. Scaled customer success & self-service is already happening in communities in the form of forums, user groups, virtual office hours & webinars, educational content, product ideation, and more. If you're a customer success leader who needs to build a digital CS motion, and you have a community team, but it sits in another org like marketing, tap into this team ASAP. You have a wealth of opportunity sitting right under your nose. If you don't have digital customer success OR community yet, now's the time to do both. Feed two birds with one scone, as my friend Brian Oblinger would say. Need help doing this? You know where to find me.\n\nI had a fantastic initial interview with a recruiter today. The job was an IC role that did not meet my salary requirements (a range was not included in the JD), but I had been interested in the company for some time, and figured it's always worth getting seen/introduced in case something better pops up. Once we agreed that this particular role wasn't right for me, the recruiter stayed on the phone with me for 30 extra minutes to talk about my job search strategy, and she offered some really helpful tips and tricks to optimize my approach. If I hadn't applied, I never would have had this conversation. Not every call will end up in a job offer, but it might help you get closer to one when the time is right.\n\nLinkedIn: \"You'd be a top applicant.\" Me: *finds an internal referral and applies* Company: \" \" ________ I know I'm not alone here. The white collar recession is real, and the current state of talent acquisition is not helping. But rather than complain about something I have very little control over, I want to point out a few green flags from some TA and hiring managers that I appreciate: ‚úÖ Calendly-like tooling that allows me to easily submit my interview availability. ‚úÖ Two-way conversations and a genuine interest in me as a human. ‚úÖ Situational/behavioral questions that give me the opportunity to share stories/lessons learned from past experiences. ‚úÖ Presentation prompts that address a specific need or problem, rather than a generic \"give us your 30/60/90 day plan for a company you know nothing about.\" ‚úÖ Realistic salary ranges in job descriptions. ‚úÖ Timely follow-ups about next steps in the process. To those of you on the job hunt, what would you add to this list? #opentowork #hiring #talentacquisition\n\nA simple, Scrum-inspired framework for publishing content consistently within your community: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Break your quarters into 2-week sprints. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Build a backlog of content ideas, post titles, edits/updates, etc. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Pick 1 high effort, 2 medium effort, 3 low effort items from the backlog for each sprint. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Meet with contributors every 2 weeks to review completed tasks and plan the next sprint. You can adjust the volume for each sprint based on the number of contributors you have and your community's specific needs. At the time I started using this framework, I had 2 dedicated contributors aside from myself for a newly launched community. I use an Asana project to manage this and include the following fields (aside from the basics like Title, Author, Due Date, Status): ‚ùóPriority (P0-P3). High priority items get into upcoming sprints before lower priority items. üõ†Ô∏è Effort (Low/Med/High). Also known as t-shirt sizing or story points in the Scrum world, this is the indicator of how long it's going to take to produce. Whatever works to achieve the 1-2-3 model for each sprint. ‚úèÔ∏è Content Type (blog, video, discussion, article, news, etc.). This ensures a good mix of modalities when selecting backlog items to include in the next sprint. \"Backlog\" is the first section in the project, followed by sections for each sprint (Q1 S1, Q1 S2, etc.). The drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to pull backlog items into each sprint. Another great thing about Asana is you can customize your project fields and sections to meet your specific needs. This is just a baseline to get you started. Why this works: ‚ú® The agile practice makes it easier to cater to the *current* needs of both the community and the business, allowing you to be more responsive and adaptable to hot topics, internal fire drills, dependencies, etc. ‚ú® The backlog serves as a place to document content ideas from anyone, at any time, which builds a treasure chest of topics to cover over time. You'll never be short on inspiration for your content calendar. ‚ú® The process of sprint planning is collaborative. Contributors are largely in control of what they will/won't commit to in each sprint. Empowering them in this way leads to more consistency and higher quality work. Accountability without pressure is key for cross-functional contributors, because everyone has a day job. ‚ú® Workflows for each piece of content can be managed directly in the Task. All conversations, drafts, and approvals should live in the Project. If you'd like to see this mocked up in Asana, let me know. I'd be happy to share! What process is working for you? I'd love to hear how others are approaching content calendars or any other workflows for your community. #community #cmgr #contentcalendar #projectmanagement #programmanagement\n\nMy number one piece of advice for the unemployed: establish a new routine that you can stick to consistently. I'll share mine below; I'd love to hear about yours in the comments if you are also donning the lovely green #OpenToWork banner on your profile: 9:00am - 10:00am: Exercise! I love to start my day with movement. This allows me to approach job applications and interviews with body and mind in proper condition. If I achieve nothing else in the day, this at least provides a sense of accomplishment that pays dividends over time. 10:30am - 12:00pm: Job application time! I usually don't apply to any more than 2 per day to avoid burnout. Yes, job hunting can be a full time job, but it doesn't have to be if you're prioritizing the right opportunities and working your network effectively. 12:00pm - 2:00pm: Lunch break & long walk with a podcast. My goal is 20K steps daily. 2:00pm - 4:00pm: House projects. I use the time away from work to tackle my personal to-do list that often goes by the wayside when I'm working full time. Again, this provides a sense of accomplishment that I'm missing from a full time job. If needed, I'll also use this time to check in on applications, respond to recruiters, schedule interviews, etc. 4:00pm - 4:30pm: Transition to mom mode! I'm a solo parent to 3 kids 5 and under, so it's important to have some time to prepare for the 5-8pm \"gauntlet.\" IYKYK! It's easy to feel pressured, discouraged, overwhelmed, and exhausted from this process. But I've found that balancing the things I *get* to do now in this situation with the things I *have* to do is the best way forward."
