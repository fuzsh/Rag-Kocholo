        "text": "Experts in conservation, finance, and operations join leadership team.\n\n(Washington D.C.)—The Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership is pleased to announce the onboarding of four new directors to its leadership team. Joe Anderson, Bill Henagan, Rita Hite, and Andrew Martin join the 27-member board that oversees TRCP.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome these four individuals to our Board of Directors,” says Alston Watt, TRCP Board Chair. “The diverse set of experience they have continues to build upon our strength as an organization and helps us to achieve our mission of guaranteeing all Americans quality places to hunt and fish. They each truly understand the importance of TRCP’s work to have lasting impacts to conservation, habitat, and access.”\n\nBios for the incoming board members can be found below. To read more about TRCP’s full Board of Directors and leadership team, click HERE.\n\nJoe Anderson\n\nA graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, Joe and the infantry platoon he commanded in Vietnam were subjects of the highly acclaimed documentary film “The Anderson Platoon” which has won several awards to include the Oscar of the Academy Awards and an Emmy. Mr. Anderson’s military awards include two silver stars, five bronze stars, three Army Commendation Medals and eleven Air Medals.\n\nJoe also serves on boards of several public and private companies. He is a past chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago-Detroit Branch as well as a past chairman of the U.S. Department of Commerce Manufacturing Council.\n\nJoe started fishing as a child with his dad in Topeka, Kansas. They raised English Pointers and hunted pheasant and quail throughout the state. He currently lives in Michigan and continues as an avid wing shooter hunting birds throughout the United States and Canada. He also fishes for salmon and halibut in Alaska.\n\nBill Henagan\n\nLike his outdoor adventures, Bill’s professional interests stay broad and varied. As a young engineer for Texas Instruments, he manufactured DoD guidance systems, then spent the next fifteen years pioneering “Big Change Fast” for the Fortune 1000 in the emerging Systems Integration industry with CSC/Index and Deloitte. Over the past 20 years he has sought to provide thoughtful advice and private equity to positively impact family owned, southeastern companies as Managing Director of Henagan Spencer Capital Partners. In both the for-profit and non-profit worlds, Bill works to harness collective wisdom and ambition to solve complex governance challenges.\n\nComplementing his investment portfolio, Bill stays deeply committed to actively giving back to his community on boards such as Visiting Nurse Health System, Breakthrough Atlanta, The Lovett School and The Rotary Club of Atlanta.\n\nBill and his wife Babette enjoy traveling to hunt and fish and have consistently support worthy conservation organizations. Along with their grand puppy, Boone the Bloodhound, they call Atlanta and the Low Country of South Carolina home and are blessed with two, fully grown, gainfully employed sons, William and Darby.\n\nRita Hite\n\nAs president and CEO of the American Forest Foundation, Rita Hite leads the foundation’s ambitious conservation agenda. Her work centers on scaling AFF’s efforts to empower family forest owners from all walks of life to address the most pressing conservation challenges facing our nation today: namely, increasing carbon storage, mitigating catastrophic wildfires, and improving fish and wildlife habitat.\n\nIn her more than 20-year career in forest conservation, Rita has staffed congressional leaders on the House Committee on Agriculture, built and curated coalitions and partnerships including the Forest Climate Working Group, the Forests in the Farm Bill Coalition and the Women’s Forest Congress, and served as a nonprofit leader. She has shaped strategy, programs, and public policies that have unlocked billions in support for family forest stewardship and have had a significant impact on climate change, wildfire resilience and forest sustainability across the United States. She finds energy in tackling difficult conservation challenges and bringing together diverse teams, coalitions and resources to create market-relevant solutions.\n\nRita is a graduate of SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry. She felt the call to champion natural resource conservation having grown up on a beef cattle farm in Upstate New York, where hunting and fishing were a natural part of life.\n\nWhen not working, she’s likely chasing her five-year-old son, BBQing with her husband Matt, tending to her garden, or snuggling with her dogs at her home in Alexandria, Virginia. While she’d call herself an amateur, she enjoys fishing today with her husband and son when they can get away in nature.\n\nAndrew Martin\n\nAndrew Martin has been an advisor to and advocate and enthusiast of the sporting world for over 25 years. He co-founded Baird’s Enthusiast Brands in 2009 and leads the firm’s global coverage efforts across the outdoor industry, inclusive of work in the hunting, shooting sports and fishing segments. Andrew has had the good fortune to advise corporate leaders in the sporting world, iconic brands and the industry’s premier growth platforms. He and Baird have also been and are committed supporters to other organizations such as the Outdoor Foundation and the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation.\n\nAndrew Martin has been an advisor to and advocate and enthusiast of the sporting world for over 25 years.

Quickly passing a bipartisan Farm Bill that includes provisions that increase the pace and scale of voluntary, incentive-based drought resilience efforts is critical given the ongoing water-supply challenges facing western watersheds such as the Colorado River and Rio Grande.”\n\nFor many years, TRCP has worked with elected officials and state, Tribal, and federal agencies to support partnerships, policies, and funding that support critical investments in modernizing Western water infrastructure and nature-based solutions that enhance climate resilience and sustain healthy habitat for fish and wildlife. As part of the 2018 Farm Bill, the TRCP was instrumental in securing important victories for the Colorado River, including expanding eligibility for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) to include watershed-scale conservation and restoration projects and ensuring drought resilience is a key priority for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. However, despite the promise of this change, there have been significant challenges with implementation. Funk’s testimony focused on the long-time bipartisan support for this work and the need for Congress to quickly pass a bipartisan Farm Bill. This would ensure funding and technical assistance are available to increase the pace and scale of innovative drought adaptation and mitigation efforts benefitting agriculture, fish, and wildlife.\n\n“The Farm Bill can play a vital role in addressing drought and climate impacts in western states and can do so through a “multi-title” approach, meaning that beyond the Conservation Title, there are opportunities with the Forestry, Research, Rural Development, and other titles to address key water-related challenges,” said Funk. “For example, most Westerners receive their water from forests. Forests are home to our natural water infrastructure – the source watershed streams, wetlands, and meadows that sustain drinking and irrigation water across the West. The Farm Bill presents an opportunity to enhance the conservation and restoration of these headwater forests through efforts such as strengthening the Water Source Protection Program, which allows the USFS to enter into agreements with water users to develop and implement source water plans and actions from fuels management to riparian restoration efforts, and the Watershed Condition Framework which provides for strategic restoration of forest watersheds.”\n\nFunk also highlighted how the Conservation Title can play a greater role in addressing drought conditions, and that there are several opportunities to support western farmers and ranchers. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), for example, can help address drought by restoring perennial cover on environmentally sensitive agricultural land, which reduces water loss to evaporation, and increases water infiltration. This same cover provides essential wildlife habitat and improves water quality. Improvements to the CRP in the next Farm Bill are needed to ensure these outcomes can be achieved.\n\nStressing the need for increased collaboration, Funk highlighted how, in early 2023, the USDA released a Western Water and Working Lands Framework that outlined the challenges and conservation approaches needed to support western farmers and ranchers, including modernization of irrigation infrastructure, improving water forecasts’ reliability, and restoring streams and wetlands. But, unlike other targeted USDA frameworks, the Western framework still lacks the dedicated resources needed to support implementation and encouraged Congress and USDA to continue working collaboratively to ensure adequate resources and capacity are available to implement these existing measures.\n\nIn closing, Funk emphasized that the TRCP and our hunting and fishing community partners stand ready to work with Congress to craft a Farm Bill for agriculture, fish, and wildlife.\n\nWatch Funk’s testimony HERE\n\nLearn more about the Farm Bill HERE.\n\nLearn more about TRCP’s commitment to healthy habitat and clean water HERE.\n\nThe TRCP is your resource for all things conservation.

She also serves as editor-at-large for TROUT magazine, and her first collection of poetry How You Walk Alone in the Dark recently won a Colorado Book Award.\n\nAs a Nebraska farm kid showing 4-H steers and dairy goats, Erin Block was raised to understand where food comes from, but it wasn’t until she moved to Colorado that she started hunting grouse, hares, and turkeys on the public lands around her home. A celebrated writer who grapples with the complexities of hunting and surrounding culture, Block offers a unique perspective with talent that grips her readers.\n\nHere is her story.\n\nI grew up in the Midwest, in Nebraska and Iowa, and spent time fishing with my dad. But no one in my immediate family hunted. We lived on a small farm, and I spent my childhood riding horses, raising 4-H steers and dairy goats. After college, I moved to Denver, Colorado, and that’s when I started hiking and backpacking. As a kid, I took it for granted that I knew where some of my food was coming from. As an adult, I started to realize that I wanted to get back to that in some way, but a farm was out of my financial means. So I started foraging mushrooms and then hunting. I started small, working my way up in animal and weapon size each season: first for grouse, then snowshoe hare, jackrabbit, turkey, and mule deer.\n\nThis past October, my husband, Jay Zimmerman, and I took our recurve bows out to hunt snowshoe hare. There was new snow that had fallen overnight and there was no wind. The hare tracks were fresh and it was magical to move through the woods so quietly as a predator. It felt like a lucid dream.\n\nI am very much a homebody and don’t like traveling. I’m attached to my home waters and hunting grounds and would always choose them over anywhere else: the Front Range and eastern plains of Colorado.\n\nConservation is essential for being able to continue to hunt and fish. Good habitat creates better opportunities for hunters and anglers, but also improves the health of the ecosystem and animal populations. Every hunter knows the stomach-sinking-feeling of returning to an area you have had past success in and finding corners of a field mowed, timber cut, water drained, thickets torn up.\n\nI’m lucky to live in an area with many public lands, but each year, more empty plots are developed, and the weather has become predictably unpredictable. I’ve witnessed severe drought, 1,000-year floods, and wildfires in my area all within a short span of time. Without a doubt the climate is changing and if we can create and maintain good habitat through conservation practices, that will help all animals through the coming years. There are also just a lot more people on the landscape. This isn’t a bad thing, but I think we all need to be mindful that even if we don’t view an activity as consumptive—hiking, for example—we are still impacting the land and its inhabitants, possibly detrimentally so.\n\nIt’s important to me to try to have a positive impact on the resources I use and enjoy and also the small area of land where I live. I plant fruit trees, leave brush piles for rabbits, encourage the growth of native plants such as wild raspberries for pollinators, and so on. In less than a decade of hunting turkey, I have noticed a decrease in songbird activity at sunrise. Hunting takes you to places where you notice small changes like that, and makes you want to do something about it. In an interview with Orion Magazine, the poet Ross Gay was asked what he’d most like to be remembered for and his answer always sticks with me: “I am glad to have planted trees.”\n\nConservation should matter to us and to the next generation because even if you don’t fish or hunt, the health of our ecosystems directly affects our own well-being, both physically and mentally. And even for non-game species, we should care about their right to exist and their contribution to ecosystems. To quote Aldo Leopold, “keep all the pieces.”\n\nPhotos Courtesy of Erin Block.\n\nThe TRCP is your resource for all things conservation.

The 211-mile corridor would have partially bisected the home range of the Western Arctic Caribou Herd, one of Alaska’s largest herds.\n\n“The recent decision to deny the proposed Ambler Road permit is an unequivocal win for the declining Western Arctic Caribou Herd that will keep, at least temporarily, its home range intact,” said Jim Dau, retired Western Arctic Caribou Herd biologist with Alaska Department of Fish & Game. “Caribou rarely use their entire range in any one year; however, over the course of decades, they use – and need – their entire range. This is increasingly important in a rapidly warming Arctic. What’s good for caribou is also good for the people who value or depend on them.”\n\n“This decision is a great step toward ensuring that current and future generations have the opportunity to experience this majestic, unbroken landscape,” said Lewis Pagel, owner of Arctic Fishing Adventures in Kotzebue, Alaska. “The Brooks Range truly is a place like no other.”\n\nThe project would have also crossed 11 major rivers and required nearly 3,000 stream crossings, degrading habitat and potentially impeding fish passage for important subsistence and sportfishing species such as sheefish.\n\n“Brooks Range rivers will remain remote and wild because of this decision,” said fly fishing guide Greg Halbach of Remote Waters in Anchorage, Alaska. “We needed hunters and anglers from all over the country to speak out against the Ambler Road and they did. Because of this collective effort, I will continue to have the privilege and opportunity to immerse my clients in a wild landscape unlike any other.”\n\nThe proposed Ambler Road prompted strong resistance from the hunting and fishing community. In 2023, more than 40 Alaska-based businesses, leading outdoor brands, and conservation organizations launched Hunters & Anglers for the Brooks Range. The collective—which includes guides, outfitters, and transporters who operate in the Brooks Range—urged the BLM to deny the permit for the private industrial corridor. To date, the coalition has delivered more than 14,000 individual letters to the agency opposing the Ambler Road.\n\n“With this victory comes a renewed sense of commitment from the hunting and fishing community to safeguard America’s most remote hunting and fishing grounds.”\n\nJen Leahy, Alaska senior program manager for the TRCP\n\nAs expected, development interests have wasted no time attacking the BLM’s decision. Ambler Road proponents have reportedly included an amendment in the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act that would rescind the BLM’s decision and force the Department of the Interior to permit the Ambler Road. This effort will be met with strong resistance as conservation-minded hunters and anglers defend the BLM’s decision.\n\n“With this victory comes a renewed sense of commitment from the hunting and fishing community to safeguard America’s most remote hunting and fishing grounds,” said Leahy. “The Brooks Range is a treasured destination for hunters and anglers, and we will stand guard to defend this iconic and wild landscape from emerging and future threats.”\n\nLearn more about Hunters & Anglers for the Brooks Range HERE.\n\nThe TRCP is your no-B.S. resource for all things conservation.
