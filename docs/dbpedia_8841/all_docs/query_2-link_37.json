        "text": "Hometown: Jordan\n\nMedical school: Jordan University of Science and Technology\n\nWhat excites you about your residency/fellowship at Corewell Health? What I liked most about Corewell Health in West Michigan is the people. During my interview, the positive vibes and how caring and nice the residents and the faculty were, made me feel in a place like home. I was looking for a supportive program with a family-like working environment that has excellent teaching and healthcare reputation, and I found Corewell Health in West Michigan as a perfect choice that carries all of that. I was impressed by the educational system and how the program provides great opportunities to develop ourselves from both academic and clinical fields. Plus, Grand Rapids is a great place to live in and I'm so excited to start my residency there.\n\nWhat are your clinical interests? I am interested in all things in pediatrics, but I like the adrenaline rush in the acute settings of NICU, PICU and ED which I may consider one of them as a future carrier. I also like teaching and being involve in the educational system. Still, I don't know how things could change through residency, but I'm looking forward to it.\n\nHobbies: I enjoy playing soccer and tennis and outdoor activities like camping, hiking and hunting. I also love spending time with my family and friends. In my spare time, I like listening to podcasts, watching movies and play video games.\n\nHometown: Spokane, WA\n\nMedical school: Washington State University Elson S Floyd College of Medicine\n\nWhat excites you about your residency/fellowship at Corewell Health? I absolutely love challenges and am most excited to face those that will arise throughout residency. I am specifically excited to be training at Corewell Health in West Michigan for the beautiful facilities, hardworking staff and wonderful family environment offered here in Grand Rapids.\n\nWhat are your clinical interests? Above all, I am interested in helping parents understand complex medical needs of their children. I enjoy fast paced environments with elevated acuity.\n\nHobbies: I love spending time with my wife and three boys, building and fixing things, sewing, playing bluegrass music and cooking new foods.\n\nHometown: AL Balqa, Jordan\n\nMedical school: MuâTah University\n\nWhat excites you about your residency/fellowship at Corewell Health?
