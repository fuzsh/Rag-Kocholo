        "text": "Golf\n\nRising golf course architect Andrew Green reboots Interlachen with an eye to history\n\nThe work of legendary course designer Donald Ross remains Green's inspiration as the course hopes to position itself for the next 100 years.\n\nBy Jerry Zgoda\n\nJuly 2, 2023 at 9:20PM\n\nAndrew Green gave some tips to workers at the reworking of Interlachen, which will play host to the 2030 U.S. Women’s Open. (Brian Peterson, Star Tribune/The Minnesota Star Tribune)\n\nIn a satchel slung over his shoulder, newly renowned golf course architect Andrew Green carries an iPad downloaded with blueprints, handwritten notes and photographs all a century old.\n\nAnd some modern necessities as well.\n\n\"Rangefinder and sunscreen,\" Green said, pulling items from his bag. \"It's all there, right at my fingertips.\"\n\nIn his head and heart, he also carries something of the spirit of Donald Ross, the prolific \"golden age\" golf course designer who died in 1948.\n\nThe hats Green wears — ''I love my floppys\" — protect him from long days working in the sun. Indiana Jones' famous fedora might be more fitting for a restoration specialist who is part Bobcat-operating dirt digger and part archeologist.\n\nRaised in western Virginia and now Maryland-based, Green supervises construction crews and shapes the land himself with skid loader and digital level once or twice a week all summer at private, historic Interlachen Country Club in Edina.\n\nInterlachen is where amateur Bobby Jones won the 1930 U.S. Open on his way to golf's first and only \"grand slam\" season. He started a little tournament now called the Masters four years later.\n\nIt's also where the U.S. Women's Open — last played at Interlachen in 2008 and headed to historic Pebble Beach this week for the first time — returns in 2030.\n\nA major men's championship — possibly a U.S. Open by 2036 — isn't out of the question if Interlachen has the infrastructure and space needed.\n\nClosed to member play in June until next July, the roughly $10 million course restoration will reclaim, rebuild, reshape and/or enlarge all greens, tees and bunkers. Fairways and rough wall to wall will be seeded with new bentgrass varieties more resilient to Minnesota winters.\n\nInterlachen officials hired Green three years ago to bring back a course Ross built a century ago by horse and human, by shovel and push seeder. Green was mostly unknown then to everyone but golf-design geeks, even if he just completed inspired Ross restorations at Oak Hill in upstate New York and Inverness in Ohio — and Congressional's original 1924 design near Washington, D.C., as well.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nGolf\n\nInterlachen, site of prominent golf history, is awarded the 2030 U.S. Women's Open\n\nGolf\n\nHilary Lunke, 20 years after 'that putt' to win U.S. Open, is super busy supermom\n\nGolf\n\nTony Finau eager to defend 3M Open title; former U.S. Open champ Gary Woodland commits to play\n\nMay's PGA Championship crowned Brooks Koepka, but Green and his loving re-creation of Ross' 1926 Oak Hill East course were the big winners in player and public opinion.\n\n\"I wasn't sure what people might say or might think,\" Green said. \"It was certainly beyond my wildest dreams.\"\n\nGood as gold\n\nThree days after he watched Koepka win at Oak Hill, Green stood at 6:30 a.m. on Interlachen's 12th green, near the highest point on a property he calls \"just so spectacular\" because of its topography and Ross' hole routing.\n\n\"They have some patina, that's for sure,\" Interlachen director of golf course and grounds Brian Boll said.\n\nRespecting history\n\nSome features from Ross' original blueprints — including a 262-yard, par-3 17th hole played in the 1930 U.S. Open — have been lost in the mists of time. Others were modified beyond recognition by well-meaning course superintendents and greens-committee members.\n\nThey bulldozed Ross' grassy \"hummocks\" that defined the eighth fairway and shrank greens into egg shapes simply from routine mowing all those years. They also planted trees here, there and everywhere.\n\nWork last winter removed selected trees, which opens sight lines and grows grass better by letting the sunshine through.\n\nWhen asked how many trees, Green simply says, \"The right amount.\"\n\n\"The sole intent of this is to respect Interlachen's history, its heritage,\" he said.\n\nPolishing a jewel\n\nRoss' original plans remain Green's instruction and inspiration after all these years. Green calls the original design \"as strong as any Ross course I've visited.\"\n\nEach shot, each hole \"fits and flows\" to the next over the land. With every slope Green carefully measures, he aims to stay as true to Ross' original work as possible.\n\n\"These are antiques and you don't paint an antique,\" club historian Brad Sherman said in a video on YouTube that celebrates the restoration. \"You polish an antique.\"\n\nGreen considers polishing this Ross original something meant to be. In college, he discovered a newly published collection of Ross' \"lost commentaries.\" In a brief chapter on diagonal bunkers, there is a vintage photo that captivated his imagination because of its bold shapes and angles.\n\nIt's the par-5 12th hole at Interlachen.\n\nIt was a course unknown to then. It's a hole he now knows so well from his copy of Ross' \"Golf Has Never Failed Me.\"\n\n\"There's a certain amount of destiny to it, for some reason,\" Green said. \"I have little post-it notes and arrows in my copy. It's well-loved.\"\n\nInterlachen's restoration intends to challenge and satisfy first-class players and higher handicappers alike and provide its 400-some member golf families better course conditions.\n\nIt's mostly meant to position Interlachen for its next 100 years, just as Ross' original work did the last 100.\n\n\"If we're going to do this, we're going to do it only one time and we're going to do it right,\" Livingood said.\n\n(Provided by Interlachen Country Club/The Minnesota Star Tribune)\n\n(Provided by Interlachen County Club/The Minnesota Star Tribune)\n\n(Brian Peterson, Star Tribune/The Minnesota Star Tribune)\n\n(Provided by Interlachen Country Club/The Minnesota Star Tribune)\n\n(Star Tribune file/The Minnesota Star Tribune)\n\nabout the writer\n\nJerry Zgoda\n\nReporter\n\nJerry Zgoda covers Minnesota United FC and Major League Soccer for the Star Tribune.\n\nSee More"
