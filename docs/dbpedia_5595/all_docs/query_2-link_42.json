        "text": "The Real Housewives of Atlanta welcomed several new cast members for season 13. In 2020, Kandi Burruss, 44; Porsha Williams, 39, Cynthia Bailey, 54 and Kenya Moore, 50, signed on as series regulars or “peach holders.” Bravo also announced that actor Drew Sidora, 35, agreed to be the show’s latest full-time housewife.\n\nSince RHOA returned in December 2020, Sidora and Burruss became friends both on and off camera. The Xscape singer recently shared why she hopes The Game actor stays with the reality show for several seasons.\n\nKandi Burruss and Drew Sidora briefly met before ‘RHOA’\n\nBurrus and Sidora were both known as entertainers before they became Real Housewives. In the 1990s, the Kandi Koated Nights CEO gained notoriety with her band Xscape. Once the group parted ways, she worked as a songwriter for multiple artists such as TLC, Destiny’s Child, and Mariah Carey. However, her career expanded when she joined the RHOA cast in season 2. Through the show, Burruss created several spinoff shows and businesses that include her oldest daughter, Riley Burruss. After having her two youngest kids with Todd Tucker-Blaze Tucker and Ace Wells Tucker, she got back into acting. Last year, Burruss landed a recurring role on Showtime’s The Chi.\n\nSidora’s career started during the early ‘00s. After booking several guest appearances on That’s So Raven and Girlfriends, the actor earned her first lead role in Step Up. Following her inaugural movie, the actor infamously played herself in The Game for three episodes.\n\nIn 2013, Sidora starred in TLC’s biopic, CrazySexyCool as Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins. During that time, she and Burruss met each other in passing. The singer/songwriter wrote several songs for the group, including one of their hits, “No Scrubs.” Because of her relationship with the group, Burruss and Sidora crossed paths at the VH1 movie’s premiere. The “Who Can I Run To” artist recently shared a throwback photo of them at the event on her Instagram account.\n\n“I just found a great #FBF with @drewsidora!!!” Burruss captioned in March 2021. “This was a great night at the premiere of the #TLC movie in 2013. Who would’ve ever thought our paths would cross again all these years later!”\n\nThe two qualities Kandi Burruss thinks Sidora brings to ‘RHOA’\n\nAlthough they met before RHOA, Burruss and Sidora’s friendship formed when the actor and her husband, Ralph Pittman, started taping the show. However, the new housewife and Moore haven’t been so lucky. In the most recent episode of RHOA, the cast members had a heated dinner following the group trip to South Carolina. Throughout the get-together, the women interrupted each other, and Moore became offended when Sidora offered to split the check. Additionally, she accused Sidora of “making out” with Williams and fellow newcomer LaToya Ali.\n\nMoore briefly spoke about the drama during her appearance on Burruss’s YouTube show, Speak On It. She told the “Just Kickin’ It” singer that many RHOA cast members have come and gone. Although she agreed with Moore, Burruss said she thinks Sidora’s personal life and her cast issues make her an asset to the show.\n\n“I feel that a lot of that is the fact that well she does have a great story of her own and her personal life with her marriage and you know she’s got multiple kids, and her mother, I like her personal story,” Burruss said. “And then, The fact that she also has, you know, different things happening between the cast definitely gives her that thing that needs to bring her back again.”\n\nWhy Drew Sidora thinks Kenya Moore doesn’t like her on ‘RHOA’\n\nSidora recently shared her thoughts on her and Moore’s dinner during the RHOA aftershow. While speaking with Williams and Shamea Morton, the Sister Code star said that her co-star’s acting career might be the reason they’re not friends.\n\n“She ain’t [been] booked in over a decade,” Sidora said of Moore. “You can be successful in other things, but when you love your art as an actress — she kept telling me she was one, and I’m like — I looked on her IMDb, but I didn’t see nothing in over a decade so I don’t know.”"
