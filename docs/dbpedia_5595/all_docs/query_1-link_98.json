Hitting Instagram, Drew Sidora penned a message on behalf of her family.\n\n“It is at this time with a heavy heart and great sadness that we mourn the passing of my father Dr. Robert Andrew Jordan,” Sidora wrote. “There are no words to describe the grief in my heart with his passing. The love he showed as a husband, father, uncle, grandfather, physician, and so much more to everyone he met was truly unmatched. His legacy and memories will forever be cherished through all he met and loved, and the family ask for privacy during this time.”\n\nIn a separate post, Sidora revealed her father died after a battle with Alzheimer’s Disease. ” I was a Daddy’s Girl and I will cherish the precious memories that will forever live in my heart and his legacy lives forever!” she wrote. “He was the best pediatrician in all of Chicago and if you knew, you knew! He was passionate about helping people, saving lives and providing quality healthcare to those in the indigent community.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRest in peace to Dr. Jordan."
