        "text": "The behind-the-scenes story of one of the greatest girl groups is hitting the TV screens this summer.\n\nToday (April 5), Lifetime unveiled the trailer for TLC Forever, a documentary film celebrating the story of the iconic top-selling female group, TLC, which will air on June 3. Lifetime will simulcast it on the A+E network.\n\nAccording to the Deadline, TLC Forever will be two hours long. Behind the camera, Roger Ross Williams served as executive producer. And Matthew Kay directed the feature film.\n\nIn the trailer, Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas spoke on their journey as members of TLC as the special “documents the revolutionary group that broke boundaries, influenced an entire generation and survived against all odds.”\n\nIt is their first time telling the story in a featured film. Missy Elliott and more also made guest appearances in the documentary.\n\nIn the early ’90s, TLC was formed in Atlanta, featuring T-Boz, the late Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, and Chilli. The R&B trio signed with LaFace Records. They went on to tour the world, win Grammys, and sell millions of records. The group later went on to sign with Arista Records and Epic Records.\n\nIn 2002, tragedy struck TLC when Left Eye passed away in Honduras. The 30-year-old was partaking in a retreat when she died in a car accident. After her death, Chilli and T-Boz decided to continue as a duo rather than replacing Left Eye."
