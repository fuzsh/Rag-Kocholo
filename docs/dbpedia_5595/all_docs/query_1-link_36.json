        "text": "Rising R&B powerhouse CANDIACE has released a brand new music video for her recent fan-favorite single, “Fine Whine.”\n\nWatch the video – HERE. Check out the Apple Video Link HERE.\n\nDirected by MigKeb Productions, the visual offers a behind-the-scenes look into CANDIACE’s life. It follows her as she rehearses choreography and performs “Fine Whine” live on stage. Featuring a bevy of exclusive tour footage, the video welcomes audiences into her world with unfiltered access. At the same time, it captures the energy of the song.\n\nAfter originally dropping “Fine Whine” in 2022, CANDIACE refreshed the song with a recent re-release. In just a few weeks, the track has gained traction at DSPs, while also picking up plugs from the likes of Broadway World and more.\n\nIt arrives on the heels of her recent collaboration with Drew Sidora, “Affirmations, Pt. II.” The latter has garnered more than 175k Spotify streams while also reeling in critical acclaim from the likes of Rated R&B, That Grape Juice, Broadway World, and more.\n\nIn other news, CANDIACE just wrapped up the second leg of her highly-successful “Deep Space” Tour. Throughout 2023, she lit up stages across the nation with performances in Chicago, IL, Nashville, TN, New York, NY, and Atlanta, GA, to name a few.\n\nFans can also tune into Season 8 of Real Housewives of Potomac to watch CANDIACE shine on the big screen. The season is currently streaming on Bravo.\n\nCheck out the season trailer – HERE.\n\nCANDIACE built widespread hype with last year’s Deep Space. In its first week, it opened with more than half a million streams and has garnered north of 7.5 million streams to date. It achieved #24 on the Billboard Current R&B Albums Chart and also peaked at #4 on the iTunes R&B/Soul chart. Additionally, it earned praise from the likes of Anita Baker, Nicki Minaj, and Toni Braxton.\n\nShe then re-upped, re-energized, and recharged her acclaimed full-length debut album with eight recordings, including “INSECURE” [feat. Trina]. Listen to Deep Space Deluxe Edition – HERE.\n\nRight out of the gate, “INSECURE” incited critical applause and earned plugs from the likes of Bossip and That Grape Juice, who noted, “The ‘Real Housewives of Potomac’ star has been making solid strides with tracks such as ‘Drive Back’ and its housing album ‘Deep Space.’ And the trajectory continues with her newest number.” Rated R&B raved, “The spicy track contains some of the bluntest lyrics and heartfelt vocals as Candiace lets a fragile lover know it’s all him and not her, putting a damper on their relationship.” BET highlighted, “she’s telling the insecure folks about themselves.”"
