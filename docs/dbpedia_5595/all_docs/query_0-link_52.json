As Season 15 approaches, here’s a look back at every couple who divorced after appearing on the show.\n\nRhoa Season 15 cast via NBC Universal DeShawn Snow divorced after her first season on ‘Rhoa’\n\nSnow appeared on the inaugural season of the Bravo reality show. At the time, she was married to former Philadelphia 76ers player, Eric Snow. They had three sons, and DeShawn wanted to have a daughter. Viewers watched as Eric spoiled his wife with lavish gifts and DeShawn wrote $30,000 checks for charity and tithes for Church. She was fired after the first season for being “boring.”\n\nNews soon broke that Eric had been having an affair with a woman he dated in college.\n\nThe peaches are back with The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 15 premiering on Sunday, May 7 at 8 p.m. Et on Bravo.\n\nKandi Burruss, Kenya Moore, Shereé Whitfield, Drew Sidora, Marlo Hampton and Sanya Richards-Ross all return for the new season with the addition of friends Monyetta Shaw-Carter and Courtney Rhodes joining the cast.\n\nThe explosive trailer for the new season of Rhoa shows Burruss snapping at fellow co-star Hampton.\n\n“The only reason why I’m crying right now is because I can’t choke your a** bit*h,” Burruss tells Hampton.\n\nHampton not only has issues with Burruss but in the preview, she reveals that she had previously hooked up with the man her co-star Moore is seeing now.\n\nAnother storyline that created headlines ahead of the Season 15 premiere was Sidora filing for divorce from her husband. The trailer shows the couple continuing to go to therapy to work things out.\n\nThings aren’t so peachy for “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Drew Sidora and her husband Ralph Pittman in the just-released Season 15 trailer, which debuted on LoveBScott Thursday morning.\n\nSidora and Pittman, who both filed for divorce earlier this month, are seen struggling before a montage of headlines clipped from various blogs about their divorce fills the screen.\n\n“Are you ready to talk about Ralph?” a producer asks Sidora in her confessional. “Yes,” she replies tearfully. In her amended divorce filing, Sidora accused Pittman of adultery and abuse, so the conversation will surely be a heavy one.\n\nAlso Read:\n\n‘Real Housewives’ Who Have Filed for Divorce (Photos)\n\nMeanwhile, the cast brings up the shooting at Kandi Burruss’ restaurant Blaze that occurred last September that involved her cousin Melvin Jones. Burruss told TheWrap last month that the women come for her most of the first half of Season 15.\n\nIt looks...\n\nLet the peach party commence! Several cast members from The Real Housewives of Atlanta's inaugural season are set to reunite for the first time in 14 years as part of a special episode of OWN's interactive talk series, The Nightcap with Carlos King. Together, Atlanta OGs Kim Zolciak-Biermann, DeShawn Snow, Shereé Whitfield and Lisa Wu will rehash the drama from season one and reveal just how far they've come since then. In E! News' exclusive sneak peek of what's to come, Carlos asks Kim how she and her husband, former NFL player Kroy Biermann, have been since her time on the show. \"Amazing. We've been married almost 11 years,\" Kim said. As if...\n\nIt's officially been a decade of NeNe Leakes. On October 7, 2008, Bravo introduced the world to The Real Housewives of Atlanta, the third installment in the cable network's prized franchise, making Leakes and her original co-stars Kim Zolciak and Sheree Whitfield into stars. (Other season one inclusions DeShawn Snow and Lisa Wu? Not so much.) Over the past 10 years, we've watched as the show welcomed more and more ladies, like Kandi Burruss, Cynthia Bailey, Phaedra Parks, Kenya Moore and Porsha Williams, who've brought more and more drama. As fans of Rhoa know all too well, these ladies know how to bring it in such an unrivaled way that it's no wonder they're the franchise's highest-rated...\n\nKim Zolciak is getting real about her time on \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\"In a new interview with In Touch, the Bravolebrity opens up about the show that started it all for her ... and how much she \"hated\" it!\"I was made to look like a wine drinking, raging lunatic!\" she tells the mag. \"I hated it! It got to a point where I felt like I was sacrificing myself for a paycheck. I never knew what I was getting into.\" \"I didn't like half of the women on the show, so that made things difficult,\" she adds.At one point or another, Kim shared the screen with every Atlanta cast member on the show -- including NeNe Leakes, Kandi Burruss, Sheree Whitfield, Lisa Wu Hartwell, DeShawn Snow, Phaedra Parks, Cynthia Bailey, Kenya Moore and Porsha Williams -- and definitely did not get along with them all equally.After leaving \"Rhoa,...\n\nKim Zolciak exits \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" tonight, making NeNe Leakes the only original cast member on the popular Bravo reality show.Over the last five seasons, the originals wives have departed one-by-one: DeShawn Snow after Season 1, Lisa Wu Hartwell after Season 2, Sheree Whitfield after Season 4 and Kim Zolciak midway through Season 5.Toofab caught up with NeNe at the Voli Light Vodka Benefit, where we asked her how it felt to be the sole survivor among the cast. Check out her response:NeNe definitely is the winner, having expanded her resume to include roles on \"Glee\" and \"The New Normal\" (she refers to creator Ryan Murphy as her fairy godmother).NeNe also said producers have offered her a spin-off many times, but she's interested more in acting (frenemy Kim Zolciak's spin-off will air in 2013). She also hits up her fair share of red carpets.See her, Fergie, Joanna Krupa...\n\nBy Kim Palacios\n\nhollywoodnews.com: With two divorcees, a serial mistress, a would-be widow, and a wedding that almost didn’t happen, Phaedra Parks seemed to be the only “real” Atlanta housewife left on Bravo TV. When the series began in 2008, cast members Nene Leakes, Sheree Whitfield, Lisa Wu-Hartwell, and DeShawn Snow were all married, and Kim Zolciak the lone mistress to a married real estate mogul, the secretive “Big Poppa”. Yet, in the show’s third season, the original housewives have moved on, with most current cast members’ relationship status defying the premise of the show.\n\nSheree Whitfield’s marriage was the first casualty, having failed early on in a bitter but understated divorce from NFL player Bob Whitfield soon after the first season began. Lisa Wu-Hartwell and DeShawn Snow left the cast before season three, with Snow divorcing her NBA athelete husband, Eric Snow, soon after.\n\n\"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" is coming back to Bravo on October 4 but the drama is ready to be previewed. In a sneak peek for what's going and what's coming, model Cynthia Bailey and attorney Phaedra Parks are introduced as the new housewives replacing DeShawn Snow and Lisa Wu-Hartwell who quit in season 1 and 2 respectively.\n\nFrom the first impression Cynthia is not as sassy as the other wives and she even had a breakdown during one of her photo shoots. But she seemed to be the babe whom every men would like to marry. On the other hand, Phaedra is a dominating attorney to many celebrities. Pregnant with her first child, she is married to a younger man who signs a pre-nup first.\n\nMeanwhile, the other wives go on with their lives. NeNe patches things up with Kim but finds out that her marriage to Greg is falling apart due to money issues.\n\nLisa Wu out—Cynthia and Phaedra in! EW has exclusively learned that Bravo will officially add two new housewives to the cast for its third season of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, which is set to premiere on Oct. 4 at 9 p.m. Et. The network will make the announcement this afternoon. As you can see from the first-look cast photo above, NFL wife Lisa Wu Hartwell went the way that DeShawn Snow did after season one—she’s no longer a full-fleged cast member. However, sources tell us that Hartwell will indeed make occasional appearances on the show, much like...\n\nA recent episode of The Real Housewives of Atlanta dealt with the issue of drink-driving. Kandi Burruss, who replaced castmember DeShawn Snow on the Bravo reality show, revealed that members of her and fiancée Ashley Jewell's family had been involved in a drink-driving incident. The singer-songwriter admitted to co-star Sheree Whitfield that her planned engagement party never transpired because of the accident, which left her cousins injured and Jewell's nephew in a coma after being struck by a drunk driver, Buddy TV (more)...\n\nDeShawn Snow may not have created enough drama on The Real Housewives of Atlanta for being \"too human for a circus show\" but that doesn't mean she's leaving the reality TV circuit for good. At present, she's pitching in a new series called Second Chance, which is \"kind of like Top Model meets Charm School.\"\n\n\"We really want to give them a chance and the people we are looking for [on Second Chance] are people who have been given up on or they have given up on themselves, they had children at a young age or they were on drugs, whatever, because you can really turn your life around,\" Snow told Ok! Magazine.\n\n[brightcoveplayer 31377807001]The second season of The Real Housewives of Atlanta has just begun and already tempers are flaring. And after Thursday's premiere, it's easy to see why: It's stressful being this fabulous! Let's take a look at the factors pushing each Hotlanta housewife to the boiling point. Sheree: Never in franchise history has a housewife flown into such a rage, so early in the season. Her war of words with party planner Anthony was jaw-droppingly intense. Anthony: \"You need to watch yourself before you get checked.\" Sheree: \"Who's gonna check me, boo?\" Anthony: \"Get out of my office, you trashy b---!\" Sheree: \"Put your hands on me!\" Hey, if you were promised a helicopter entrance and your event designer failed to deliver, you too might lose your mind. As Sheree later wondered, \"What ever happened to customer service?\" Indeed. Kim: Floundering since breaking up with Big Papa and alienated from her...\n\nThe who's who of the Atlanta social scene descended upon the W Buckhead Hotel Tuesday night for the red carpet premiere of the anticipated second season of Bravo's The Real Housewives of Atlanta. Kim Zolciak, Lisa Wu-Hartwell, Sheree Whitfield and NeNe Leakes -- along with new Housewife Kandi Burruss -- happily posed together for photographers, but it wasn't long before the war of words began. \"We are still not friends,\" Leakes said of Zolciak, her sparring partner [1] on the first season. \"Nothing has changed ... A lot of people work with people they don't like everyday. I am just one of those girls who work with people I don't like.\" Well, something has changed. DeShawn Snow has been replaced [2] in season 2 by Burruss, a singer and songwriter who has penned songs for artists like Mariah Carey, Destiny's Child and Tlc. Burruss told People she and NeNe didn't exactly hit it off.\n\n\"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" will be back for a second round with a brand new addition. Replacing DeShawn Snow who was not invited back by the producers because she is \"too human for a circus show\", is former Xscape member Kandi Burruss.\n\nThe fresh blood is a single mom who is engaged to A.J. Jewell. She is in the middle of preparing her wedding and on the verge of launching a solo career by releasing an album. As a singer and songwriter, she has worked with Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey and more. This fact will be one of the highlighted issues in the show, whether or not the other wives will be jealous with her thriving career.\n\nAspiring country singer Kim Zolciak, entrepreneur Lisa Wu Hartwell, the outspoken NeNe Leakes and budding fashion designer Sheree Whitfield remain intact as the second season line-up. The camera will follow them..."
