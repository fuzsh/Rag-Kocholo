        "text": "Real Housewives of Atlanta star Drew Sidora is facing a difficult situation with her husband filing for divorce. However, the actress seems to still be looking ahead to the future. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWho Is Drew Sidora?\n\nDrew Sidora, the American actress and singer, is best known for her role in Disney’s That’s So Raven. She was also one of the housewives in the hit show The Real Housewives Of Atlanta (2020).\n\nFamily Life\n\nSidora has three children in total, one from a previous marriage and two from her marriage with Ralph Pittman.\n\nWho Is Ralph Pittman?\n\nPittman is an author and a musician. He met Sidora in 2013, and just a year later, they were married.\n\nMarried Life\n\nSidora and Pittman were married for 9 years. They first got together in 2013 but split up on February 19th.\n\nFiling For Divorce\n\nThe couple has recently filed for divorce and is working out the specifics of it.\n\nPittman’s View\n\nIn court, Pittman stated that there was “no reasonable hope of reconciliation,” and that their marriage was broken beyond repair.\n\nLegal Custody\n\nPittman is fighting for legal custody of his two children, Machai, 7, and Aniya, 5. Sidora’s third child is from a previous relationship. Pittman has requested joint physical and legal custody of the children.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nPittman also filed for the final word or authority on matters that relate to his children’s medical and educational care.\n\nAlimony\n\nAlimony is court-ordered financial care or maintenance for one spouse to pay to another during separation or divorce. Pittman has refused to and is pushing toward not paying any alimony to Sidora during this tough time.\n\nWhy The Refusal?\n\nPittman claims that Sidora makes a sufficient amount of money from her entertainment career, and does not need any money from him as maintenance, thus, is denying to pay alimony.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nThe couple had been married for a long time, but Sidora claimed she had had enough. She claims Pittman cheated on her multiple times and was mentally abusive toward her.\n\nBlatant Disrespect\n\nSidora claims Pittman was extremely disrespectful toward her, showing her sexts of the women he had cheated on her with, yelling at her, and picking petty fights about the phone bill and other things.\n\nPhysical Abuse\n\nSidora claims she was also physically abused by Pittman, which is one of the main reasons she filed for divorce from him.\n\nFinancial Abuse\n\nPittman allegedly took out a large sum of money from her bank account without Sidora’s consent.\n\nWho Filed For Divorce?\n\nBoth Sidora and Pittman were extremely unhappy in their marriage and wanted to file for divorce. They both filed on the same day, February 27th, but Sidora beat Pittman to it by one hour.\n\nCouples Therapy\n\nThe couple had tried everything to fix their marriage, but it was broken beyond what could be fixed. They even went to couples therapy regularly, hoping it might fix their problems.\n\nThe Journey\n\nSidora claims that things had started going south in their marriage after their 6th marriage anniversary. However, the couple tabled their arguments and didn’t try couples therapy until further down the line.\n\nTrying To Make It Work\n\nThe couple tried for many years to make the marriage work. They even purchased a new home, hoping it would be a fresh start. But unfortunately, despite trying so hard with almost everything, the couple seemed to have given up hope and were no longer ready to make amends and make their marriage work any longer.\n\nPittman’s 40th\n\nPittman and Sidora both filed for divorce just two weeks after Sidora threw Pittman a lavish party for his 40th birthday. This just goes to show you never know what’s going on behind closed doors."
