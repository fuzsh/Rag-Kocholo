But at her heart, Kandi will always be a chanteuse, and she has a brand new track that's proving her vocals are as strong as ever.\n\nAs mentioned, Kandi doesn't only do business in the studio. She and her husband Todd Tucker own Atlanta's Old Lady Gang and Blaze restaurants and may open more eateries in the future. In a recent interview, Todd even teased that a Mexican hotspot could be their next venture.\n\nAnd of course, Kandi and Todd’s new film, The Pass, got plenty of buzz (and you can check it out on Peacock). Co-starring Kandi's castmate Drew Sidora, the Peacock movie was a hot topic of conversation on Season 15 of RHOA (peep the clip above.) But through it all, Kandi never lost a beat of music-making. In her recent social media posts, the singer teased a fresh track.\n\nKandi Burruss releases \"Only for You\"\n\nIn a September 22 post on X (formerly Twitter), Kandi shared the album art for her new single, \"Only for You.\" It featured Kandi in a fishnet top, jeweled hoop earrings, and thick black eyeliner. \"My new single 'Only for You,'\" is live now, she shared, linking to a preview of the track. Check out the first couple of minutes from the upbeat bop here.\n\nThere's more news on the \"Only for You\" front. The official video will launch on Sunday, September 24, and you'll be able to watch it on YouTube.\n\nPhoto: Prince Williams/WireImage\n\nTodd reacted to the musical news with a sweet Instagram post for his wife. Showing off a short teaser of what appears to be the official video, the enterpeneur wrote: \"It’s for me ah yah yah!,\" riffing off the song lyrics. He added: \"Get [Kandi's] new song ['Only for You.']\" In the video, Kandi wears a sheer, sparkly black outfit while lying on satiny pink sheets.\n\nTodd Tucker Says He’s Found His “Calling” While Sharing a Career Update\n\nRecently, it was Kandi's turn to share a congratulatory post for her husband. Showing the latest issue of SUAVV magazine, which has Todd on the cover, Kandi wrote on Instagram: \"My man, my man, my man… [Todd Tucker] is a cover man now! So proud of everything he’s accomplished & what he has coming next! Check out his interview in [SUAV Magazine].\"\n\nKandi Burruss Is Finally Opening the Doors to Her Sex Dungeon — And You're Invited\n\nDuring the interview, Todd teased plans to bring back The Dungeon burlesque show. It has since been revealed that the show will come back this October for \"one night only.\" The teaser added, \"The tickets for Welcome To The Dungeon are officially on sale! Don’t miss out. October 21st it’s going down!\"\n\nPhoto: Getty Images"
