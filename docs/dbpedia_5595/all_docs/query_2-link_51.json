        "text": "Drew Sidora's 'Til The Dawn' is an energetic anthem celebrating the freedom and unity found in nightlife. The song captures the essence of weekend escapades, where people come together to dance, let loose, and enjoy the music. The repetitive chorus, 'Out on the weekend,' sets the scene for a night where worries are left behind, and the only focus is on having a good time. The lyrics emphasize the communal experience of partying, highlighting how music can bring people from different places together.\n\nThe song's verses paint a vivid picture of a night out, from the moment the lights go on and the party begins, to the early hours of the morning when the dawn breaks. Drew Sidora mentions various cities like New York, Miami, LA, and BC, suggesting that this sense of unity and freedom is universal. The line 'the music is free' is a metaphor for the liberating power of music, which transcends monetary value and social barriers. It's a call to everyone, regardless of their background, to come together and enjoy the moment.\n\nThe song also touches on themes of empowerment and self-expression, particularly for women. The spoken interlude encourages ladies to move to the front and show what they've got, reinforcing the idea of confidence and taking up space. The collaboration with Mario adds another layer of inclusivity, inviting both men and women to join in the celebration. 'Til The Dawn' is not just a party song; it's a celebration of life, freedom, and the unifying power of music."
