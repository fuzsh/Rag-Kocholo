Kim Zolciak-Biermann\n\nReal Housewives of Atlanta (Seasons 1-5, 10)\n\nKim Z started off amazingly and had all the points to be one of my all time faves. Now she's just fine but a little difficult to love. Early Kim with the three-way battle between her, Nene and Sheree was legendary. The wig shift. Sheree and Kim aligning as they look at Sheree's scrapbook with Nene being kicked out of a party. The iconic Tardy for the Party. So many gems delivered by our chain-smoking princess, it is difficult to not love her during all of this.\n\nA R T.\n\nSo much of early Kim Z is the stuff of legends. And then she meets Kroy and it all goes to shit! Kim Z after meeting Kroy is a black hole of entertainment to me I'm sorry but it's true. He saps her of all her interesting qualities during her remaining time on the show and when she finally quits in season 5 the whole cast breathes a sigh of relief, her reign of terror and potential racism now over.\n\nAnd then she returns in season 10, fights with the cast and have the most negative friend of stint ever created, and causes Sheree to be fired for standing up for her a second time Her final moments in the reunion are of her sagely informing us all that racism did not exist until social media was created, thanks Kim! I am never watching Don't Be Tardy so someone with more time on their hands will need to inform us all if that is worth the watch. I think Kim is better than the placement she received here, but I chose the wrong day to sleep and then go to work so I couldn't cut one of the others over her\n\nSaving Dina Manzo.\n\n--------------------\n\nAdvanced Member\n\nGroup: Members\n\nPosts: 388\n\nJoined: 13-May 18\n\nAge: N/A\n\nLocation: N/A\n\nStatus: Offline\n\n105. Larsa Pippen\n\nReal Housewives of Miami 1, 4-present\n\nLarsa sucks. I wish I could end it there but I have to write 50 words. Season 1 of Miami was a classic season 1 of early housewives, still finding its feet, rebranded from a different intended show (about the catering world which lol). You had a decent cast, Lea being pure evil, Adriana a firecracker, Alexia (though I don’t care for her) had a lot of solo material and she went through it (and it only got worse for her), and Marysol had Mama Elsa. Then you have the double-headed dragon of Larsa and Cristy. Mean girls who sucked and were boring, vapid, with a hatred and jealousy of the far superior Adriana.\n\nIt came as no surprise that they were both kicked to the curb for season 2, and should’ve been a footnote in Housewives history (Cristy remains so). Notice how I don’t distinguish between Cristy and Larsa, because they were both as useless and irrelevant as each other. Post-season 1 Larsa ran off to become a Kardashian groupie, including plenty of surgery to look just like them.\n\nThen the Kardashians presumably kicked her to the curb, probably because they realised she was just another vapid hanger on to a vapid family. Inexplicably, she’s brought back for the Miami revival that was season 4. You’d think it was because she had some compelling new storyline to bring but no, she didn’t. Wow she does OnlyFans now, wow she has a lazily conceptualised jewellery line. Larsa is an absolutely useless contribution to the cast. In fact I find almost all her content nearly unwatchable.\n\nA huge chunk of it is her awful personality, when she returned she was somehow more vapid and hollow than before, a pale imitation of the Kardashians who are shells to begin with. There was that half-arsed event on the cast trip about her jewellery which “all the important influencers” attended (all alleged!). Poor Julia was dying from a severe illness (or hangover) and all Larsa could muster was “the ambulance is RUINING my event.” She made a half-hearted attempt to sell the event as some big brand launch where she barely seemed interested in her own product. She once again showed her severe Adriana jealousy hasn’t diminished over the years, picking fights with her over dumb shit like some dumb story about Kanye West’s penis. The fact she is full time and Adriana is only a Friend is an absolute crime.\n\nI don’t know why she’s on the show other than money tbh. There’s a certain relishing in the absurdity of the process for housewives and she’s just so self serious in a cringe way. Why casting thought it was a good decision to bring back this absolute waste of television space is beyond me.\n\nAnyway, did I mention Larsa sucks?\n\nsave Dorit Kemsley\n\nThis post has been edited by robulusjgreisonne: Sep 17 2022 , 06:00:21 AM\n\n--------------------\n\nA Legend on watching Modern Survivor\n\nQUOTE For the people who are like me on the couch, stay on the couch\n\n-Cirie Fields on so-called superfans\n\nAdvanced Member\n\nGroup: Members\n\nPosts: 3032\n\nJoined: 19-June 16\n\nAge: N/A\n\nLocation: Moore Manor\n\nStatus: Offline\n\n#104\n\nDiana Jenkins\n\nReal Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 12-Probablyy Fired\n\nI’m quite drunk and Firestorm told me noms are posted, so let me take this opportunity to slay the snake tongue Diana Jenkins. Drogon Jenkiz. I’m so annoyed by Housewives who come into the show and refuse to simply address the basic rumors about themselves. Yeah Diana we wanna know about Room Twenty Trois but all I see is a tongue.\n\nI like Sutton unlike most but even as Sutton haters you have to admit Diana was going crazy calling her a C U Next Tuesday and what not. Yeah Sutton is super socially awkward but for Diana to think Sutton was downplaying her misscarriages was absurd if you ask me. As someone raised in the south I can recognize some of Sutton's tactics to connect with Diana and really don't think she had any bad intentions. Kyle was doing the most in that scene and she'll hoopefully get my ire later.\n\nDiana talked a big game throughout the season and then didn’t even show up to the reunion because of covid. Now I just got my fourth covid vaccine the other day and understand showing up via Zoom, it just feels extremely disappointing given Diana's recent social media shenanigans. The whole \"black content creator\" thing was clearly racist imo despite some here giving her multiple passes and the benefit of the doubt when she didn't deserve it. Diana suing John/Jane Doe 1-50 over social media bots is absolutely hilarious. She might as well be suing ghosts and I'm cackling at the prospect of someone being unmasked like Scooby Doo and it's well...... I won't accuse anyone because I don't want to be named in the next frivolous lawsuit.\n\nI've been a Housewives fan for a very long time and can't remember a time where 99% of the fanbase felt the same way about one Housewife and demanded them to be fired. The last big example I can remember is the absolute hatred against Siggy in NJ8. So yeah Diana is probs gone and Im fine with that but will always appreciate the social media absurdity and the few moments she provided us (You need a new villain, here I am, Asher singing lol, ghostbusting?). I legit think Diana joined the show out of boredom and will go back to being bored soon\n\nOh and once i tried Neurosonic (as documented in the disocrd) and in my honest opinion it tasted like shit\n\nSaving Porsha Williams\n\nThis post has been edited by QueenTwinnies: Sep 17 2022 , 06:06:56 AM\n\ndogs are colorblind but women are not\n\nGroup: Members\n\nPosts: 258\n\nJoined: 12-September 20\n\nAge: N/A\n\nLocation: N/A\n\nStatus: Offline\n\n102 Eboni K. Williams\n\nReal Housewives of New York City\n\nWhat a horrid fit for the RHONY brand! Eboni’s role as the first Black RHONY housewife is of course a significant one. There’s really no argument for a show based in New York City to be racially homogenous barring the largely forgettable (but lovable!) one-and-done Jules. It was very clear that Eboni’s charge from the start was to take a tv show bogged down by the bits of Reagan-era racism that would seep out occasionally and drag it into the future by showing that maybe these women are loud oafs who have never once challenged their own assumptions about race, but they’re acceptable! I think whether the other women sank or swim could be mentioned at a later time when discussing them, but focusing purely on Eboni: she was mostly humorless and didactic? Very lawyerly and usually image conscious (although she DID put on those pasties along with everyone else in the finale). Her dour friend Natalie who practically tried to jump out of a window to get away from Sonja was supposed to be a selling point, I guess.\n\nI do find it funny that at one point, around the middle of RHONY13, it felt like the world was Eboni’s oyster. Rarely does a newbie come on a show and demand so much respect and attention and wield so much power immediately. But, uh, then it was the first critically panned season of RHONY and it effectively ended one of tv’s strongest institutions in an almost abrupt, dramatic turnaround, and now she’s trying to go on any panel show that’ll have her.\n\nOne last Eboni thing: she said on the show she recently ended an engagement, but I literally didn't believe her? Discuss.\n\nSaving Drew Sidora.\n\nThis post has been edited by sparkledog: Sep 17 2022 , 06:08:27 AM\n\nsigmund freud, analyse this\n\nGroup: Members\n\nPosts: 2715\n\nJoined: 22-June 16\n\nAge: 26\n\nLocation: N/A\n\nStatus: Offline\n\n101. Denise Richards\n\nReal Housewives of Beverly Hills - Seasons 9-10\n\nDenise is part of a long line of has-been actresses who joined the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in order to summon up some tabloid headlines with the hope they would revive their dead careers. Sometimes this particular BH casting trope gets enamored with the housewives game fairly quickly, and actively engages in the show's theatrics early on. Others hate being there and are only willing to do the bare minimum required of them in order to keep their contract and high salary. Denise falls into the latter category, this woman had NO intention of walking one foot further on set than she absolutely had to.\n\nWhich would have been fine, Denise could have been one season and done. But production found out that former castmate Brandi Glanville was spreading rumors she had fucked Denise after filming a podcast episode with her. They decided this would be *the* main storyline of season 10, and Denise, opposed to having her real life filmed as one can be, was obviously not up to the part.\n\nShe denied the allegations, mostly just refused to discuss them, and was just insanely cagey about everything else that also involves being part of a reality show.\n\nAfter season 10, she was obviously done for. But somehow, she is now planting stories that she wants to return to the show??? Purely for financial reasons I assume, and even if somehow, a Denise Richards come back does happen, she would probably do nothing differently and achieve similar results: humiliating defeat.\n\nSaving Jill Zarin\n\n--------------------\n\nDoo Doom Chit!\n\nGroup: Members\n\nPosts: 3163\n\nJoined: 19-June 16\n\nAge: N/A\n\nLocation: N/A\n\nStatus: Offline\n\n100. Rosie Pierri\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey\n\nI continue to believe that Friend Ofs should not be a part of this rankdown.\n\nFunnily enough, Rosie almost never was a Friend Of at all! The show was content enough to feature her as just a guest to support Kathy and her family the same way a husband or a daughter would. She didn't get upgraded until Kathy got demoted. Maybe the show realized by then that Rosie was always the more interesting woman? But the show was changing eras and we never saw either again.\n\nRosie is the best of a bad bunch. The Wakiles are terrible people and watching Rosie be fiercely loyal to them while being subtly undermined by them for being queer, single, and fat was kind of sad. Kathy said on the show that she supported her sister but when you read between the lines there is a LOT of internalized trauma Rosie carries about her family that didn't come from nowhere. She compensates for her \"failures\" in upholding family image by going overboard on virtues that she can achieve, like loyalty. When her probably super homophobic dad is referenced negatively by Teresa during a reunion she brews up a storm offstage and threatens to rip Teresa's tongue out! It's a good moment, and it's demonstrative of how good Rosie could have been if the show had given her more of a chance, but Rosie also acts as her own saboteur by choosing to side with scum. And out with the scum she went.\n\n-----\n\nSaving Jeana Keough\n\n--------------------\n\nAdvanced Member\n\nGroup: Members\n\nPosts: 120\n\nJoined: 10-August 22\n\nAge: N/A\n\nLocation: N/A\n\nStatus: Offline\n\n99. Adrienne Maloof, Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Seasons 1-3\n\nAdrienne Maloof's Housewives legacy pretty much revolves around her being a casualty of Brandi and by extension, LVP. It started with LVP booking a rival casino when Adrienne owns the Palms. This festered at the season 2 reunion, when Adrienne accused LVP of leaking stories to the press and LVP adamantly denied it, carrying it over into season 3 and never letting it go even after Adrienne tried to bury the hatchet. But of course, LVP didn't take matters into her own hands. When tensions grew between Adrienne and her loyal henchwoman, Brandi, Adrienne supplied her with information about her surrogacy, something that she made sure Bravo didn't reveal on the show and was only alluded to as \"that thing.\" When Brandi blurted it out, Adrienne lost it and took the easiest route for someone who was obviously wrong and had more money than her opponent: she filed lawsuits and avoided interacting with her. It leaves her and her hilariously never-that-into-her husband Paul frazzled and in disarray and the season ends with their divorce. Then, she skips out at the reunion, leaving Brandi and LVP unchallenged, and gets fired from the show. Basically the most interesting thing about Adrienne is entirely LVP and Brandi's doing.\n\nSave: Shemari DeVoe\n\nI hope it's Trish, bigger commish\n\nGroup: Members\n\nPosts: 202\n\nJoined: 11-November 20\n\nAge: N/A\n\nLocation: Painting walls of Big Brother house with my bloodIM JOKIING!!\n\nStatus: Offline\n\n98. Mia Thornton (Real Housewives of Potomac, Season 6-Present)\n\nGiven that Potomac housewives are generally pretty smart, it's nice to have Mia on, who is messy and impulsive. She is clearly a fan of the show before she was on, so she fit right in with the rest of the women for the most part. On the show, she'll portray herself as a Girlboss of her chiropractic clinic by uh... organizing pamphlets, and then she's pretty evasive about her past as a \"hostess\" where she met her barefoot husband Big G. Don't worry it's a high class club, they serve steak and lobster. She never thinks things through and always gets herself in trouble like when she spreads misinformation about what someone said about another housewife. And her social media's a mess too She's a pioneer of the \"blame your shit on the social media manager\" housewife strategy. She even got into a spat with Nicki Minaj on Twitter\n\nLooking forward to Cangergate 2.0\n\nSave: Michaele Salahi\n\nThis post has been edited by Mayflyflowna: Sep 17 2022 , 11:25:03 AM"
