        "text": "Ralph Pittman, Jr. admits he and his wife, actress Drew Sidora, felt a bit of hesitation before joining the cast of Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Atlanta. “I have a successful career and a happy life,” he explained.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, Pittman has worked as a consultant and IT advisor to Fortune 500 companies, supporting technology decisions and business strategy. He is also a music writer for television and film (most recently composing music for the acclaimed film, Preacher’s Son, based on the Carl Weber novel) and the father of three young children. Pittman, Jr. said, “Being on the show puts our family and our challenges under a magnifying glass, which can be difficult.”\n\nIt can also be lucrative. Many TV reality stars in Bravo’s Housewives franchises have turned their fame into fortune. Bethenny Frankel of The Real Housewives of New York reportedly sold her Skinnygirl cocktail line for over $100 million. Heather DuBrow from The Real Housewives of Orange County has a skincare collection called Consult which is the number one health and beauty brand on ShopHQ. Even former cast member of The Real Housewives of Atlanta NeNe Leakes has a successful clothing line on the Home Shopping Network.\n\nWhile fame is new territory for Pittman, Jr., it isn’t for his wife, Drew Sidora. She grew up in front of the camera, starring in Disney’s That's So Raven. She’s also appeared in films Step Up, CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, and the BET comedy-drama television series The Game.\n\nOne and half million Americans tune in to watch the The Real Housewives of Atlanta every Sunday night. The series is also popular in the UK and Australia. Pittman, Jr., admits the experience of being on the show, so far, has been surreal. “Our goal is to be authentic with the ups and downs that happen in a real marriage.”\n\nAs expected, the couple has experienced backlash from some fans of the franchise, however, he says they have received a lot of support from viewers who have experienced similar relationship challenges and can relate with their story. Additionally, the opportunity to promote his brand, specifically his new project, My Mind Music for Kids, is priceless. Pittman, Jr. composed and produced My Mind Music for Kids which is a worldwide released sleep system to improve the quality of sleep for children.\n\nMy Mind Music for Kids promotes relaxation in children. “Foundationally, kids need sleep even more than adults,” Pittman, Jr. explained. “Sleep improves their behavior, cognitive function, their ability to learn and their quality of life.”\n\nParents have long known that lullabies and gentle rhythms can help babies to fall asleep. The Science community supports the observation, too, with multiple studies showing that music is very effective in soothing infants, toddlers and elementary school children.\n\n“These are not nursery rhymes or jingles,” Pittman, Jr. clarified, referencing the My Mind Music for Kids program. “In fact, I intentionally produce music that children will not sing along to.”\n\nHe refers to the songs as therapeutic sounds, similar to the waves and forests many adults will use to ease their minds after a stressful day at the office.\n\nRalph Pittman, Jr. first learned about the power music has to help achieve REM sleep in college, while studying music theory at Rutgers University. He said, “Music enhances sleep because of its effects on the regulation of hormones, including the stress hormone cortisol. Listening to music decreases levels of cortisol which helps release stress.”\n\nThe irony, of course, is that the show that has given him fame is popular for embracing tension and stress. After all, what would The Real Housewives of Atlanta be without friction?\n\nBut if the arguing and cat-fighting helps to raise the awareness of his personal brand and the rise of his fortune, so be it. “Let the ladies do their thing,” he accedes. “But the kids… they need to sleep.”"
