        "text": "Is this The Real Housewives of Atlanta and The Real Housewives of Potomac crossover we’ve been waiting for?\n\nDrew Sidora and Candiace Dillard Bassett are releasing a soulful ballad this weekend. That’s right! The artists have teamed up to collaborate on their new song, “Affirmations Pt. II,” which is set to come out on May 21.\n\nDetails on Drew and Candiace's New Song\n\nCandiace recently announced the exciting news on her Instagram by sharing a video with the single’s cover art, which featured headshots of both ladies as a snippet of the song played in the background. “Coming this Sunday,” she captioned the post. “Candiace x Drew Sidora.”\n\nThe track is a remixed version of Candiace's original song “Affirmations,” which is on her Deep Space (Deluxe Edition) album.\n\nPreview Candiace's RHOA Cameo\n\nAnd the two ladies are collaborating in other ways as well. In a sneak peek of RHOA Season 15 Episode 3 (airing on May 21; clip above), Drew prepares to take the stage with Candiace and shares her feelings about their collaboration. “I am nervous, but I am here,” Drew admitted in the above preview. She went on to tell Candiace that she “loved the song” before Candiance added, “Did you? Yes!”\n\nDuring Drew’s confessional, she opened up about her connection to the track. “Candiace’s song resonated with me because it’s about believing in yourself, and that’s just exactly where I am.” She continued, “People haven’t always been supportive of my music because they would always see me as an actress, but nothing is going to stop me from achieving my dreams.”\n\nWhat Else Is Drew Working On?\n\nA new song is just the latest exciting thing to happen in Drew’s thriving career. Back in April, she gave fans a glimpse at her “set life” as she posted a few photos to her social media. The black-and-white photos showed Drew in what appeared as a trailer.\n\nIn the first photo, the singer-actor was sitting on a chair in front of a glowing vanity mirror with curls set in her hair. She appeared to be studying her script and even took a snapshot of it."
