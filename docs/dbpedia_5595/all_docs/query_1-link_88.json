Trina once again proclaims she's the queen and is not sorry for being conceited because \"That's My Attitude\"!\n\nReally hoping this makes some noise because Trina has gotten progressively better with each album and Still Da Baddest was one of my favorite rap CDs of 2008 as well as her best album.\n\nCollaborations confirmed for Amazin' include: Drew Sidora, Jagged Edge, Keri Hilson, Lady Gaga, Ludacris, Lyfe Jennings, Nicki Minaj, Pretty Money, Rick Ross, Shonie, and Swazy Baby.\n\nAlbum in stores 9/22/09 but expect it to chance since she just officially released the first single 9/4/09\n\nPost by C.Ro on\n\nI definitely hope she make some noise..here we go was amazing..and that lady gaga colab sounds interesting!"
