T-Boz said on her Facebook they are probably doing a world tour afterward!\n\nThat would be sooo awesome! Chilli is right! TLC's lyrics are missing from the music scene!\n\nPost by Junkiex on\n\nYeah! Fanmail is one of my favorite albums of all time!\n\nPost by cjay on\n\nI LOVE TLC!!! They should do it! T-boz and Chili voices compliments each others so well. The world DOES need more TLC!\n\nPost by Junkiex on\n\nI think hey could always use Left Eye's remaining recordings as well! I had read there were like hundreds!\n\nPost by cjay on\n\nI think hey could always use Left Eye's remaining recordings as well! I had read there were like hundreds!\n\nIf they do that then they should craft the song AROUND left eye's rap. That way the song and rap fit unlike that mess on 3D.\n\nPost by So Pure on\n\nWow! They both look great. I used to LOVE TLC back in the day but after Lisa passed the magic was gone for me. Their was just something magical about the 3 of them together that you can't reproduce with only 2. That's why I've been looking forward to their solo albums but it sounds like that's not gonna happen if they do another TLC record!?\n\nPost by Junkiex on\n\nI have personally not really liked their solo efforts. 3D was not at CSC/Fanmail level but it was better than what they've done on their own, imo.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI like 3D more these days than the time it was released... The lyrics are so smart, the sound is so TLC and classy.\n\nPost by B****BetterGetNOSL333P on\n\nWOW~! I did NOT see this coming! I'm more than happy to hear this! TLC 4EVER!\n\nPost by *Who Is?* on\n\nI seriously want this to happen...they are my favorite artists and group of all time, if I saw them going for adds on any format I would probably cry.\n\nPost by Mpol on\n\nAbout time. I just was listening to CSC and FM, both are AMAZING albums. They lyrics were powerful, the videos thought provoking. They were the best.\n\nPost by B****BetterGetNOSL333P on\n\nFanMail album is my fav. the vocals of T&C together is just amazing! and yeah! they can always use the unheard tracks/ rap by Left Eye.\n\nPost by Junkiex on\n\nFanMail has so many awesome tracks! FanMail, Silly Ho, Good At Being Bad, Miss You So Much, My Life... and of course, Unpretty... it will always hold a special place in my heart!\n\nPost by tamed09 on\n\nI say Tboz go forward with the Solo Album because she's booked so much time with amazing producers and writers and she's writing as well...to see it never come out would be a disaster to me\n\nPost by tamed09 on\n\ncbs13.com/video/?id=62608\n\nI'm speechless, because this woman has to be one of the strongest women in the world.\n\nPost by Caviar on\n\ndamn!!! in tears!!! had no idea she was going through that. TLC has to come back.\n\nPost by George on\n\nAnother hits compilation for TLC was released a few months ago:\n\n1. Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg\n\n2. Baby-Baby-Baby\n\n3. What About Your Friends\n\n4. Creep\n\n5. Red Light Special\n\n6. Waterfalls\n\n7. Diggin' On You\n\n8. No Scrubs (With Rap)\n\n9. If I Was Your Girlfriend\n\n10. Unpretty\n\n11. Girl Talk\n\n12. Damaged\n\n13. Get It Up\n\n14. Das Da Way We Like 'Em\n\nPost by Kishi KCM on\n\nNo more greatest hits from them!! New stuff, new stuff!\n\n3D and CrazySexyCool are the albums I listen to the most. In Your Arms Tonight, Lets Do It Again, Take Our Time, and Good Love are my faves from the 2 albums.\n\nPost by tamed09 on\n\nwww.blogtalkradio.com/wnathanhistedthinks/2011/09/24/what-nathan-histed-thinks-and-tionne-t-boz-watkins-of-tlc\n\nGo to the 17:30 mark, Next Year TLC Returns!!! Finally! Hopefully the material is good!\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nNO INTEREST. 3D sucked and these girls have been away for 10 years doing nothing musically. Stop tainting the legacy!!\n\nPost by SHOOTER on\n\nI enjoyed 3D. I'm not expecting any classic from them at this point but I see no harm in them producing new music just because.\n\nPost by tamed09 on\n\nI think it would be smart to do an album similar to Speakerboxx/The Love Below. Tboz has recorded with Polow Da Don,Bangladesh,Akon,Darkchild etc so why waste those songs.\n\nPost by Musiq on\n\nThey would really need some great material if they are recording a new album. They should also consider performing with more energy.\n\nPost by SHOOTER on\n\nI think it would be smart to do an album similar to Speakerboxx/The Love Below. Tboz has recorded with Polow Da Don,Bangladesh,Akon,Darkchild etc so why waste those songs.\n\nThat'd be an interesting listen for sure. Their legacy as a trio is permanent so I'm fine with the two of them forging and recording new music just for the pure love of it. As long as they don't try to rehash any old Left Eye verses, it's fine by me.\n\nPost by Agent Yoncé on\n\nI'm estatic that my gurls are coming back! I hope they don't find some old Left Eye verses & put them in their new songs. It didn't work w/\"3D.\" This album maybe their most collaborated album yet.\n\nPost by Nick on\n\n^ I just think that they should create a new group name, the \"L\" was Left Eye. It makes no sense that they would still use that name.\n\nI'm not saying get a 3rd girl, just a new name.\n\nBy the way, what happened to that bitch from the reality show anyway? \"Oh So Krispy\"? lol!"
