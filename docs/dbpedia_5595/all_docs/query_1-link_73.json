        "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 23, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- TLC, the best-selling female group in music history, has revealed the title and track-listing for their latest collection, which will be released on October 15th by LaFace/Epic Records. Entitled 20 as a nod to the group's 20-year-plus career, the album features TLC's biggest hits (including their four No. 1 singles, \"Creep,\" \"Waterfalls,\" \"No Scrubs,\" and \"Unpretty\"), plus a new track written by Ne-Yo, \"Meant To Be.\" The latter will be heard during the closing credits of the upcoming VH1 Original Movie, CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, which inspired the track-listing for 20. The film, which stars Keke Palmer (Akeela & The Bee) as Chilli, Drew Sidora (Step Up) as Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins, and Lil Mama (America's Best Dance Crew) as Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopez, chronicles TLC's humble beginnings in Atlanta and unprecedented rise to fame in the '90s. It will premiere on VH1 on October 21st.\n\n(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130923/NY84181 )\n\nHaving participated in the creation of the CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story and serving as executive producers, Chilli and T-Boz are ushering in the next phase of the group's illustrious career, which saw them, along with Lopes, sell 65 million albums worldwide and become cultural icons in the process. Being on the set inspired Chilli and T-Boz to go back into the studio and record brand-new TLC music. The sessions resulted in so many great songs that Epic Records chief L.A. Reid (the group's mentor who originally signed them to his LaFace Records in 1991) has decided to release a full album with all new music in 2014.\n\nChilli and T-Boz will celebrate the release of 20 and CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story with a series of television appearances, including Good Morning America on October 15th, The View on October 16th, and The Wendy Williams Show on October 17th.\n\nTLC shot to superstardom in the '90s thanks to a series of best-selling albums, including 1992's quadruple platinum Ooooooohhhâ€¦ On the TLC Tip, 1994's Diamond-certified CrazySexyCool (which has sold over 23 million copies worldwide and is the best-selling album by a girl group in the U.S.), and 1999's FanMail, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard chart and has been certified 7x-platinum in the US and 14 million worldwide. The group has racked up four No. 1 singles, ten Top 10 singles, and four Grammy Awards, and was ranked the seventh most successful act of the '90s by Billboard. Through their very public and high-profile success, turmoil and tragedy, TLC left an indelible stamp of female empowerment that changed the face of the music industry forever.\n\nThe track-listing for 20 is as follows:\n\nAin't 2 Proud Beg\n\nWhat About Your Friends\n\nBaby, Baby, Baby\n\nHat 2 Da Back\n\nCreep\n\nWaterfalls\n\nRed Light Special\n\nDiggin' on You\n\nKick Your Game\n\nNo Scrubs\n\nUnpretty\n\nSilly Ho\n\nDamaged\n\nMeant to Be\n\nTLC:\n\nwww.officialtlc.com\n\nwww.facebook.com/OfficialTLC\n\ntwitter.com/OfficialTLC\n\nSOURCE Epic Records"
