        "text": "On October 15, TLC will deliver its fifth studio album and its first since 2002’s 3D, the last project that featured the late Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, who passed away earlier that year. Today (July 25), Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Rozonda “Chill” Thomas arrived in New York City with news that TLC is back.\n\nThe two have already recorded with a few heavy-hitters for its forthcoming album, including Ne-Yo on a track called “Meant To Be,” and Lady Gaga and Dallas Austin on “Posh Life.” Drake has already expressed interest in working with the group, and the two were adamant about working with J. Cole again, citing the chemistry they had while recording Cole’s “Crooked Smile” off this year’s Born Sinner.\n\n“There is a whole other generation that doesn’t know who we are,” Chilli says. “I think that what we have as far as the people that we work with…We know when music sounds trendy. We don’t want to go in the studio and make music that sounds like five other artists that they worked with. We demand something new.”\n\nTLC released its first album, Ooooooohh… On the TLC Tip, in 1992. The collection featured the hits “Ain’t 2 Proud 2 Beg,” “What About Your Friends” and “Baby-Baby-Baby.” The trio became superstars with the release of its second album, 1994’s CrazySexyCool, which included the singles “Creep,” “Waterfalls” and “Red Light Special.”\n\nWhen asked about their decade-plus absence, T-Boz says, “Even if we were out and it hadn’t been 10 years, you still have to reintroduce yourself and up your game.”\n\nIn addition to the album, TLC’s VH1 biopic CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story will premiere on October 21. The film features Drew Sidora, Lil Mama and Keke Palmer portraying the roles of T-Boz, Left Eye, and Chilli, respectively. Lil Mama walked on stage during the press conference today to announce that she will be performing with TLC this Saturday in Hershey, Pennsylvania at the Mixtape Festival. She is not a new member, though, despite nailing the role of Left Eye in the film.\n\nCheck out the trailer below:"
