For years, individuals have looked to music as a source of therapy to convey their emotions and utilize their talents in order to entertain the masses. Such an individual that certainly utilizes all of her talents is the multitalented, Drew Sidora. Not only does she excel in acting, she is an extremely talented, singer/songwriter, dancer, and businesswoman. With brains, beauty, and talent to back her it's no surprise that she is commanding such attention within the industry. When asked about future goals and aspirations Sidora states, \"I want to passionately inspire, empower, and entertain.\" Sidora began studying music and theatre at the age of two, trained in the Suzuki Method of classical piano for six years, and trained for the stage at the Organic Theater in Chicago. Dancing since she was four, she studied modern dance with Tony Dyer and before she was even a teenager, she had done national voice-overs, television commercials and print ads, and her television career was well-established. She made her motion picture debut at the age of nine in Thomas Carter’s DIVAS. At 13, as lead singer for the Chicago R&B group MO’TEMPO, she was spotted by a scout and encouraged to go solo. She maintained honor roll status throughout high school, graduated early and moved to Los Angeles, where she was signed to Babyface Entertainment, and started writing music for Edmonds Publishing. Recently, she had the number one single on Chicago radio, Bermuda and Hawaii and fifteen additional states, which earned her the nickname \"Chi-Town Princess\" and the opportunity to open for national recording artists performing all over the country. She is currently working on her debut solo album. A series regular on The WB’s “The O’Keefes,” Sidora also had a recurring role on THAT'S SO RAVEN and guest-starred on WITHOUT A TRACE, WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU and GIRLFRIENDS. Her earlier film credits include NEVER DIE ALONE, WHITE CHICKS, WILD HOGS, starring Tim Allen, John Travolta, William H. Macy, and Martin Lawrence and starred in Screen Gem's MOTIVES II with Vivica A. Fox. In addition, Drew received rave reviews for her performance in 2006's hit Disney feature STEP UP playing a talented soulful R&B, with two placements on the movie's soundtrack. Sidora just wrapped last month on the anticipated break dancing feature, B GIRL with the lead role of Righteous (www.bgirlmovie.com). She was also featured in; FRANKENHOOD with Charlie Murphy and FARMHOUSE with Kelly Hu from X-MEN. Sidora was in Johannesburg, South Africa filming a wonderful movie with an incredible ensemble cast entitled; THE KILLING OF WENDY. She also had with her a high definition digital camcorder to film a docudrama of her travel there, what she will learn, and what she hopes to bring back home about the history and of the women of South Africa today. Drew has had an extremely successful year landing a lead role in the FBC series Nurses opposite Eliza Dushku and Sara Rue as well as filming three independent features while also recurring as herself on the hit comedy THE GAME, which airs Monday nights at 8:30 Central on The CW Network. Sidora is set next to film B BOY BLUES, which she is co-producing and 305 OUTLAWS, a motorcycle film where she plays the lead, both projects film in New York this year. Slip-N-Slide Records' Pop Songtress draws inspiration from singers such as Aaliyah, Anita Baker, and Prince. The vocalist states, “I hope to continue my musical and theatrical career while expanding my entertainment company with Drew Sidora Productions, which I will utilize to produce strong, diverse films that will focus on up and coming talented minority actors/actresses.\" Sidora would one day like to launch her own music label, Record Breakers Music Group. The label would serve as a platform to showcase young artists from her native city of Chicago and from across the country. With a giving spirit that was embedded in her by her mother, Drew plans to continue supporting and developing carious charities. She provides outreach programs and resources for young people interested in careers in the entertainment industry and is the spokesperson for The Sickle Cell Disease Association of Illinois. Drew is also one of the Spokeswomen for Liz Claiborne's LOVE IS NOT ABUSE campaign and curriculum, which addresses teen dating abuse. The LOVE IS NOT ABUSE Curriculum is a step-by step guide to teaching high school students about the issues of dating violence. Using literature and poetry, this program provides teachers with the tools to teach about this sensitive subject. \"I love to stamp and innovate the next hot fashion trend, and I always demand respect in everything I do. From film to music I will continue to defy all boundaries...Don't be against me!\" - Drew Sidora\n\nshow more..."
