        "text": "It looks like Real Housewives of Atlanta stars Drew Sidora and husband Ralph Pittman are calling it quits.\n\nPEOPLE got their hands on documents filed by Pittman on Monday, as he was the one who sought a petition for divorce. He claimed that their separation date was just Feb. 23 and he noted that there “is no chance or hope of reconciliation” for the pair.\n\nThe couple wed in 2014, welcoming son Machai in 2015 and daughter Aniya in 2018. Sidora also has a son named Josiah from a previous relationship that Pittman was at one point, considering legally adopting.\n\nA lot of the couple’s marital issues, or at least from the last years of their relationship, played out on RHOA. That includes Ralph leaving home for a three-day trip to Tampa without communicating with his wife, an inappropriate text message with his assistant, who was later fired, and their inability to communicate in a healthy way.\n\nESSENCE spoke with the couple back in July 2022 as the last RHOA season was concluding. During that conversation, she opened up about why she stayed with him despite all of the rumblings from her co-stars and fans who felt Pittman wasn’t the best partner for her and constantly gaslit the singer and actress.\n\n“I think people don’t get to see the layers of our marriage and who we are fully. Especially Ralph, people might watch it and say, ‘Well, why is she married to someone like this?” she told us at the time. “But you don’t see the other sides of him. He’s an incredible father. He is very affectionate. He will give the shirt off of his back to someone. He’s extremely giving, extremely caring, God fearing.”\n\nShe continued, “I hope, as people continue to watch and we are on, that people will learn a lot more about us and see the other side. We laugh, we joke, we’ve got chemistry.”\n\nShe also didn’t blame being on the show for the struggles she and Pittman were having. She told us that she felt being on the series was to their benefit.\n\n“It’s caused us to face issues and held us accountable to really get into counseling and really do the work because…you don’t want to keep showing up in the world like this,” she said. “I actually find it therapeutic at times. Even the relationship between my mom and Ralph, they’ve worked through a lot of their issues because of the show. And I think we’re able to have a lot of tough conversations on camera that we may not have had, so I’m thankful for the opportunity. And I think it’s been overall great, especially for our family, which is most important to me.”\n\nSidora has not publicly addressed Pittman’s filing, or had her legal representatives file a response. But we are thinking of her during this time.\n\nSee photos of the couple during happier times below."
