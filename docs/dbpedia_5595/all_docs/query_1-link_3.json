        "text": "Rising singer and actress Drew Sidora has granted access to the worries of heart on her new single “Throw Us Away.” It was produced by haZEL (Tamar Braxton, Jacquees) and Nix and co-written by Sidora, Nye the Songwrita, Ross Ramzey and Alesia Miller.\n\nDetailing one of the most painful seasons of her life, Sidora lightly sings with vulnerability and candor about what precipitated her marriage falling apart.\n\nSidora pressures her unfaithful man to come clean about his tryst, not because she wants to reconcile. She’s already accepted the end, a distinction heard in this redemptive declaration, “You gonna be back but I’ma be good.”\n\nDiscussing her new single, Sidora exclusively tells Rated R&B, “They say art imitates life and this is something that ‘Throw Us Away’ does. This song literally reflects where I am in my life right now and the shift that is taking place. When we created this record, I wanted my vocals and lyrics to really paint a clear picture. This is the first time I’ve been really able to capture in real-time my life in my music and create it in real-time. The current status of my marriage and my life, overall, has been made very public and the music has been a way for me to cope with all of the changes.”\n\nShe continues, “The music, and this song in particular, has been therapeutic for me because it’s been a way for me to express thoughts feelings, and emotions that I often keep bottled in — it’s my safe place. I’ve been able to lock in with some other great producers and songwriters to really help illustrate, musically, my life in an amazing way. Also what I love about this record is it starts vulnerable but ends with so much triumph. That’s literally been my path for the past several months. I want to make sure that my music is authentically me and that it helps, inspires and motivates everyone that listens.”\n\n“Throw Us Away” is Sidora’s lead single from Sidora’s forthcoming debut album, tentatively titled SHIFT. It’s set to release in 2024. According to the press material, the album will “chronicle the ups and downs of her relationship and personal battles.”\n\nSidora exclusively explains to Rated R&B why she chose to release an album instead of an EP. “I’ve recorded so much music. At first, I was planning an EP but, now, I have so much story to tell and so much music to express that I am finalizing my first full-length project,” Sidora tells Rated R&B.\n\n“As you all know, I’ve been in music for a while, but the timing now seems so right. I used to be so discouraged at what didn’t work out, but it’s all about God’s timing. Because I am in this shift in my life, I plan to tentatively title my debut project SHIFT.”\n\nPreviously, Sidora shared a music video for her promotional track “Already Know.” She co-wrote the steamy song, released last fall, alongside her now-estranged husband Ralph Pittman, who appears as her love interest in the visual.\n\nSidora and Pittman announced their divorce ahead of Real Housewives of Atlanta, season 15.\n\nTheir struggles were documented throughout the season, and more issues between the two will be revealed in part two of the reunion. Watch it on Bravo Sunday, Sept. 10, at 8 p.m. EST.\n\nStream Drew Sidora’s new song “Throw Us Away” below."
