        "text": "The emotions are real and Drew Sidora poured her heart into her new single, “Throw Us Away.” She performed the song during Part 2 of The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 15 reunion (which aired on September 10 on Bravo) in front of her castmates, Andy Cohen, and her estranged husband, Ralph Pittman. And if you want to know what inspired Drew to record the track, you’re in luck, because we have the scoop. She revealed all to The Daily Dish, so pull up a seat.\n\nRead on to discover everything Drew shared about the track.\n\nDrew Sidora reveals the inspiration behind her song “Throw Us Away”\n\n“They say art imitates life, and this is something that ‘Throw Us Away' does,” she told The Daily Dish in an exclusive statement. “This song literally reflects where I am in my life right now and the shift that is taking place. When we created this record, I wanted my vocals and lyrics to really paint a clear picture.”\n\nShe continued, “This is the first time I’ve been really able to capture my life in my music and create it in real time. The current status of my marriage and my life overall has been made very public, and the music has been a way for me to cope with all the changes. The music — and this song in particular — has been therapeutic for me because it’s a way for me to express thoughts, feelings, and emotions that I often keep bottled in. It’s my safe place. I’ve been able to lock in with some other great producers and songwriters to really help illustrate, musically, my life in an amazing way. Also, what I love about this record is it starts vulnerable but ends with so much triumph. That’s literally been my path for the past several months. I want to make sure that my music is authentically me and that it helps, inspires, and motivates everyone that listens.”\n\nWhat’s next for Drew Sidora’s music career?\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Dish, Drew went on to share more about what’s next for her career: “I’ve recorded so much music. At first I was planning an EP, but now I have so much story to tell and so much music to express that I am finalizing my first full-length project. As you all know, I’ve been in music for a while, but the timing now seems so right. I used to be so discouraged at what didn’t work out, but it’s all about God’s timing. Because I am in this shift in my life, I plan to tentatively title my debut project SHIFT.”\n\nMore on Drew Sidora’s Career and Family Life Today\n\nIn addition to her new track, “Throw Us Away,” and her upcoming album, viewers can also catch Drew in Todd Tucker and Kandi Burruss’ movie The Pass, which is streaming exclusively on Peacock. You can also watch uncensored versions of the RHOA Season 15 reunion on Peacock. (Take a look at the film’s premiere by checking out the clip at the top of the post.)\n\nWhen Drew spoke with The Daily Dish earlier this year, she opened up about her very busy career: “I finished five movies this year… I was doing two movies at one time. It was crazy. That was crazy. But it was like, as I was going through such a tough time, it was like all these blessings coming down as well.”"
