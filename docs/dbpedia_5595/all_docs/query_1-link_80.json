Hammond then auditioned to play bass for the Gospel singing group the Winans and toured with them from 1980 to 1982. Upon returning to Detroit, he and Mitchell Jones, along with 4 other friends (Karl Reid, Fred's Brother-in-Law Keith Staten, Michael Brooks and Michael Williams) formed the Gospel recording group \"Commissioned.\" The group traveled the country doing singing engagements, establishing their fan-base and raising money to record an album.
