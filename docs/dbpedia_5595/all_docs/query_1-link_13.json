        "text": "Drew Sidora has been a scorching hot topic of late thanks to her integral spot on the ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’ season 15.\n\nThe hit show’s latest installment has seen the multihyphenate star’s rollercoaster marriage to Ralph Pittman implode and her relationship with her fellow castmates more tested than ever.\n\nAs the age-old adage goes: why not make lemonade out of the lemons one has been dealt? And it’s a memo Sidora has taken and embraced as she struts forward. In both her career and her life more broadly.\n\nFor, the entertainer has poured her all into her emotional new single ‘Throw Us Away.’\n\nProduced by Donald ‘haZEL” Sales’ and written Sidora with Nye the Songwrita, Ross Ramzey, Alesia Miller, the telling track chronicles the breakdown of a relationship. Suffice it to say, ‘Throw Us Away’ is very much art imitating life.\n\nThat Grape Juice sat down with Sidora ahead of the song’s release and her performance on the concluding part of the RHOA season 15 reunion this Sunday.\n\nSpeaking exclusively with TGJ’s Chet Kincaid, she opened up about her single, her public split, her future on the show, and much more.\n\nCheck out the interview above and highlights after the jump…\n\nOn New Single ‘Throw Us Away’:\n\n“This song was my life, like, every piece of it, every part of it is exactly what I was going through at that time. So, this is my diary. Like you guys are getting such a personal look into my real life. That in my relationship, I was hoping that the person I’m talking to would listen and answer some of those questions. Because sometimes you can’t always communicate through words, they turn into arguments. Sometimes you can’t always express yourself, but I just felt like music is such a universal expression. So yes, when you hear these lyrics, this is my life, for sure.”\n\nOn Her RHOA Future:\n\n“I feel like this season was enough on a lot of fronts and for a lot of reasons. I don’t know what the future holds. I really want to focus on my music, I really am enjoying that journey. I’m enjoying getting back in front of the camera and doing what I’ve always done my whole entire life. I’m just, I feel at home when I’m on set and when I’m creating characters. So, I really don’t know.\n\nI’m not excited to return back because of what’s happening right now. I feel like sometimes you have to take a personal moment in life to pay attention to what’s important. And I think my family, my children is what is important for me in doing things that really fulfill me”\n\nOn Ralph’s Recent Remarks:\n\n“I think that it’s always important to protect our children. I’m a mama bear. And I don’t know any mother out there that will stay in for their child’s being brought into a messy situation. And so, children are off limits. We don’t need to include them in any adult business conversations, and craziness that we have going on and I stand by that. I feel like we can throw our shade. But when you go below that belt, that’s when I have to stand and protect my children. So, I was extremely disappointed.”\n\nWatch the Full Interview Above.\n\n**********\n\nClick Here to Listen to Drew Sidora’s ‘Throw Us Away’\n\nYour thoughts?"
