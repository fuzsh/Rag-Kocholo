        "text": "As her official bio for notes, Candiace Dillard Bassett is \"extremely busy\" in her music career on The Real Housewives of Potomac Season 8.\n\nOn Episode 2 of Season 8, which aired on November 12, Candiace is looking to spread her wings (pun intended) by leaving her current record label, Monarch, in favor of something bigger.\n\nShe's also touring around the country to promote her Deep Space (Deluxe Edition) album, and she's setting up her guest performances.\n\nAfter collaborating with The Real Housewives of Atlanta's Drew Sidora on \"Affirmations Part II,\" Candiace discussed the possibility of working together again on the episode. Keep scrolling to find out what she revealed.\n\nCandiace Dillard Bassett Shares an Update on Her Friendship with Drew Sidora\n\nWhile meeting with her manager, Nye, Candiace discusses her options for her upcoming tour dates. As she prepares to return to Chicago, Nye wonders if Chicago native Drew would be the right \"special guest\" to bring onto the stage.\n\nThough Candiace and Drew previously shared the stage (their duet was featured on RHOA Season 15) â€” and they released a remix of Candiace's song, \"Affirmations,\" the RHOP cast member is reluctant to work with the multi-hyphenate for one main reason.\n\n\"I don't feel like I need to do anything more musically with her,\" Candiace explains. \"I sold out Chicago. I'm just saying, I don't need Drew or anyone of note to bring butts to the seats. Sorry, I'm tired.\"\n\nCandiace Dillard Bassett's Next Steps in Her Music Career\n\nAs previously mentioned, Candiace is also looking to grow in her music career. Though she had a \"great\" experience with her first record label, she's looking to move on.\n\n\"The way that [the] music business works is that you have a contract with a label. My contract with Monarch will be up soon,\" Candiace explains in an interview on the episode. \"As I'm looking to grow as an artist, I have to grow the machine around me. So, moving away from Monarch is just the next step in the process of world domination.\"\n\nWhat Else to Expect from Candiace Dillard Bassett on RHOP Season 8\n\nIn addition to her music moves, Candiace's touring schedule and expenses are taking a \"toll\" on her marriage to Chris Bassett.\n\nPer her bio, Candiace \"becomes even more anxious\" when she makes a new discovery about her health.\n\nPlus, \"within the group, relationships are strained as Candiace is going through her usual on again-off again with Ashley, not speaking with Gizelle and going through a rough patch with Robyn.\""
