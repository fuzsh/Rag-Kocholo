        "text": "Drew Sidora is no stranger to the spotlight. As a cast member on \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta,\" Sidora has become accustomed to being involved in drama on a weekly basis. Alongside her role as a burgeoning reality TV star, Sidora continues to find great success in her acting career. Hot on the heels of roles in \"White People Money\" and \"Influence,\" Sidora is back on our screens in Lifetime's \"Line Sisters.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Line Sisters\" focuses on the reunion of four sorority sisters, Dominique (Sidora), Valerie (LeToya Luckett), Cassandra (Kierra Sheard-Kelly), and Simona (Ta'Rhonda Jones). The group gets together for a Black Greek Weekend celebration on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. However, a mysterious death 15 years prior is yet to be put to rest, and the gang finds themselves haunted and hunted during their time together.\n\nThe List sat down with Drew Sidora to hear all about her new movie, get the gossip on \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta,\" and discuss her plans for 2022.\n\nI loved \"Line Sisters.\" What made you want to sign on for it?\n\nOh my God. It was a great script. I read the script, literally read it in 20 minutes. It was such a page turner. The character, Dominique, I really connected with her. I thought she was so much fun. She was very free spirited, very optimistic, very confident. I carry some of those same characteristics, so I really connected with her. I had never done a horror film before. I felt like I'm at a place in my career — as an actress, you always want to challenge yourself. I'm like, \"This is something I would love to tackle.\" I felt like this was one that was safe enough, where I felt like I could survive it, but have that experience. I'm so happy that I worked with an amazing cast, LaToya Luckett, Ta'Rhonda Jones and Kierra Sheard. They're amazing. We really formed a real sisterhood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes that friendship carry on off screen? What was it like bonding with this group of women for the movie?\n\nAbsolutely. You don't always get that. When you book a job, you go to work, you go home and that's pretty much it. It's a blessing when you actually can build a real friendship. We became like sisters. We cried on each other's shoulders. We really uplifted each other. We supported each other. We wanted everyone to win. Even now, since the movie wrapped, we still keep in touch, we stay connected, we get together. This is an exciting time. It's rare [when] that happens. When you watch the movie, you really feel that chemistry. It translates.\n\nLike you said, it's a bit of a horror movie. A thriller. It's quite scary in places. What was it like filming those tense scenes?\n\nOh my god. It was really scary. I've done movies. When you do a kissing scene, it doesn't always feel as romantic as it translates. I was like, \"Okay, people [will be] around.\" No, people were not around. It was a closed set. I had to do a scene with a snake. That was very frightening because I didn't know it was going to be real. I've never worked with a snake. Never held a snake, so that was like, \"Okay. Yeah, we're making a scary movie.\" It was very authentic. They made it very real for us. We worked with the pigeons. Those were real dead pigeons. Everything was real in the movie, [including the] maggots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre you a fan of thrillers? Do you have a favorite? Would you like to make more?\n\nI can't watch scary movies. Movies that aren't even supposed to be scary, I can't watch them at night or by myself. People were like, \"How are you doing a scary movie? You can't even watch a scary movie.\" I feel like after this experience, I could take a nice little break, and I don't really have to do anymore. This will be one for the books. It's really about the content for me. It's about the character. It's about the story. If I were to read a script that I really felt connected to, I would definitely do it again.\n\nYou are also in \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\" What's it been like joining that show and being part of that franchise?\n\nIt's been a roller coaster. It's been amazing. I can honestly say it's allowing me to show the viewers who I am as a person. You see me in different roles, but really opening myself up with my family. What it looks like for me to be a mom, and wife, I think that was important. I really wanted to share that and be vulnerable. I am honored to be a part, and be able to open up to my fans in that way. This season, it's going to be good. It's going to be an opportunity for people to get to know me even more, see my more fun side and get to know my family on even a deeper level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's a lot to put yourself out there. You're showing the world who you are behind the scenes. That can't be easy.\n\nIt's not easy. Bravo \"Real Housewives\" fans are die hard. I love them because they're loyal. They give it to you. They go in. They watch everything. They are so hard, but I love it because they are very loyal and they keep you on your toes. I'll say that. They definitely keep you on your toes.\n\nYou're also a musician. Do you have any music news for fans, or any dream collaborators?\n\nI'm actually working on music. I just landed a distribution deal with eOne. I am currently in the studio working on my EP. I have a single that's dropping. Actually, you talk about collaborations, my husband produced the music. We have teamed up and made an amazing record that I'm so excited about. ... I've been doing music my whole life and I haven't always had the most confidence in that, because it never went to where I thought it would go. I feel like now, I'm in a place where I want to do everything in my life. Everything's about timing. Right now, I am working on music and I'm super excited. I'm nervous, but I'm excited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou've got everything going on. You've got movies, you've got reality, you've got music.\n\nWe're not leaving crumbs on the table. We're taking everything. You have to, life is short. Going through the pandemic, as an artist, it made me realize it's important to create your own content. Sitting around, waiting for a job, it's not okay when you have a family to feed. I've been creating content, writing scripts. I have a production company. I'm doing music. I'm like, \"It's time to go and live out my dreams without fear and accomplish all those things that I was going to accomplish when I was younger.\" Now is the time.\n\nYou were also in the first \"Step Up\" movie, and I wondered if you had any memories from the set. I know it was a long time ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo long ago. I'll never forget working with Madonna's choreographer. That, for me, was everything. I grew up dancing, but learning ballet and modern [dance] from Madonna's choreographer, that was definitely the highlight of going to work every day, [and] working with Usher's choreographers, because I was a huge fan of Usher growing up. To be able to live in that, and being able to blend all my passions — my music, my dancing and acting, that was like a dream come true for me.\n\nIf you could make another one, that would be great.\n\nCan you call somebody please? I'm ready for it. What are they on, \"Step Up 10\" now? I lost track. ... It's classic. It took on a life of its own and it was like the little engine that could. It was a little cute movie, and it really took on a life of its own.\n\nAre there any current TV shows that you'd love to be a part of?\n\nYeah, there's so much content out there. I am most excited about the content I'm creating. I'm in Atlanta now, so I am definitely wanting to work with Tyler Perry. I keep saying it, putting it out there in the universe. [There are] so many different filmmakers. 50 Cent is doing this thing. For me, working with Lifetime, I have some other projects that are coming out very soon with Lifetime. Really, it's creating my content. I have a movie dropping that I executive produced called, \"And You Call Yourself A Christian.\" It's [from] my production company, Eudora Entertainment. I'm excited about giving other people opportunities to get on camera and get on screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore we go, is anything else you want people to know about \"Line Sisters,\" or anything else you're working on?\n\nYes. Please tune into \"Line Sisters,\" February 12th. It airs on Lifetime 8/7 central. Follow me on Twitter or Instagram @DrewSidora. Make sure you tune into \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta,\" only on Bravo. Support your girl. That's all I can say, and I'm going to send music. Let me know. You got to have me back and we got to talk about music.\n\n\"Line Sisters\" airs on Lifetime on February 12, 2022 at 8p/7c."
