        "text": "Candiace Dillard Bassett continues to make waves in the music biz.\n\nAs she prepares to wrap up her Deep Space U.S. Tour, The Real Housewives of Potomac cast member shared another big update on her singing career. Candiace announced the exciting news in a September 13 Instagram post, saying she would soon team up with R&B icon and DMV native Tamar Braxton.\n\n“Something GREAT is happening!!!!” she captioned the video, which included the “All the Way Home” singer. “Me and [Tamar Braxton] have a surprise for you all…”\n\nThe ladies immediately confirmed that Candiace — a former Miss Maryland USA contestant — had agreed to open Tamar’s October 30 show in Silver Spring, Maryland. The concert will serve as the penultimate stop on Tamar’s upcoming U.S. tour.\n\n“OK, party people,” Tamar began. “I’ve been trying to go live for the past 30 minutes to tell you that in the spirit of — first of all, hometown greatness and amazingment, and also one of [Traci Braxton’s] favorite singers — I have asked Miss Candiace to open up for me in our hometown… and she has accepted! And so Candiace will be with us on the Love and War Tour!”\n\nCandiace Dillard Bassett reflects on the “full circle moment”\n\nThe U.S. trek kicks off on October 24 in New York City and will coincide with the 10th anniversary of Tamar’s Love and War LP. Candiace gushed over the album during the video announcement and recalled her strong reaction to the project’s title track.\n\n“Love and War is literally one of my favorite albums. Literally,” Candiace said. “When Love and War came out, I was expecting it to be great. But I remember exactly where I was when the [lead] single dropped. I was sitting on my couch in my townhouse, and I said, ‘Oh my god, God. This b*tch is singing!’ So to be in a position to be able to help you bring the people into the town and open for you is truly a full circle moment. I am so grateful and so excited and happy for you.”\n\nTamar Braxton gives Candiace Dillard Bassett her flowers\n\nTamar returned the kind words, saying she had been following Candiace’s music career on the small screen. The Grammy nominee went on to praise the ’Wife’s commitment to the craft and pushed back on the dismissive critiques of Candiace’s artistry.\n\n“You’re someone that I would watch on television, and everybody else in the room would think this [Candiace’s singing career] is a joke,” Tamar explained. “And I watched some of the girls make fun of things and act as if it was just a storyline. And I definitely saw through all of that… I want you, specifically, on that stage with me and with the rest of the crew because, No. 1, you deserve to be; No. 2, it would be my honor and my privilege to share such a platform… I would love for this to be a memorable night to jumpstart anything you want to do as the artist that you are.”\n\nThe exchange caused both women to become emotional, so much so that Candiace had to pull out a tissue and do her signature tear dab.\n\nDrew Sidora will also share the stage with Tamar Braxton\n\nBut Candiace isn’t the only Housewife who will appear on Tamar’s tour. The Real Housewives of Atlanta’s Drew Sidora also confirmed she would open the singer’s October 27 concert at ATL’s Buckhead Theatre.\n\n“This week has been about walking in my purpose,” Drew captioned a September 12 Instagram. “I am pleased to announce that I will be opening for [Tamar Braxton] ATL spot on her Love & War 10th Anniversary Tour… I’m so grateful for you, Tamar! If only you knew your new song [‘Changed’] got me through!”\n\nDrew then encouraged her followers to stream her latest single, “Throw Us Away,” which she performed during Part 2 of the RHOA Season 15 reunion.\n\n“They say art imitates life, and this is something that ‘Throw Us Away' does,” she exclusively told The Daily Dish, referencing her recent marital split. “This song literally reflects where I am in my life right now and the shift that is taking place. When we created this record, I wanted my vocals and lyrics to really paint a clear picture.”\n\n“Throw Us Away” is expected to appear on Drew’s first full-length project, tentatively titled SHIFT.\n\nDrew Sidora and Candiace Dillard Bassett’s Collaborations\n\nCandiace previously shared the stage with Drew when she invited the star of The Pass to perform in her Atlanta concert. The crossover was featured on RHOA Season 15 Episode 3, which aired the same day Candiace released her “Affirmations Pt. II” track featuring Drew.\n\nThe Atlanta mom spoke about the original “Affirmations” cut in the aforementioned May 21 episode.\n\n“Candiace’s song resonated with me because it’s about believing in yourself, and that’s just exactly where I am,” she said. “People haven’t always been supportive of my music because they would always see me as an actress, but nothing is going to stop me from achieving my dreams.”"
