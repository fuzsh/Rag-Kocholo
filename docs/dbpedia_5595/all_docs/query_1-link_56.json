        "meta_description": "Like a lot of small businesses, Lucille Williams’ once-prospering 30s-and-older lounge, Lucille's Place, took a huge hit, forcing her to sell. Lucille's baby brother, Henry Williams, couldn't stand by and let Lucille's Place slip away, so he recruited his fraternal twins, Aaliyah and Alfonso, to keep the business in the family. With Aaliyah's creative sensibilities and Alfonso's business mind, a safe space for planning and hosting events was born. Alfonso's wife, Kimberly, and son, Alfonso Jr. (A.J.), join the event planning team. Even Aaliyah has one of their chosen family members, Mia, join the team; she is a jack of all trades – so she thinks. Although the new-and-improved “Lucille’s” brings everyone together, their affairs end up causing a mess bigger than a college frat party.",
