        "text": "Mike Miller's restaurant opens Tuesday, but VIPs got to go Monday night.\n\nBasketball players, family, friends and investors got to preview the opening of Miller’s Let it Fly restaurant on W. 57th Street and Western Avenue.\n\nSouth Dakota's own former NBA player and current Memphis assistant coach was excited to bring his sports bar, food and casino concept to Sioux Falls. It will be open to the public, offering dozens of TVs, drinks and casino games to play starting this week.\n\nBut Monday was for everyone who made the new location happen.\n\n“A lot of people in that room enjoying tonight before grand opening tomorrow are people that helped us get to this spot,” Miller said.\n\nHere's a look at what Miller's closest compatriots got to try out:\n\nMore: Photos: Former NBA player Mike Miller holds VIP opening at new Let It Fly restaurant\n\nFor the hungry or thirsty on the southern side of town, the restaurant offers an upscale sports bar experience with some South Dakota flair, chislic included.\n\n“The burger’s superb,” Josh Brewster, the director for the Sanford International Tournament said at the VIP opening.\n\n“And the cheese curds are what stands out most,” said Davis Trosin, the assistant director for the tournament.\n\nMore: Mike Miller's Let it Fly sports bar is set to open next month. Here's a sneak peek inside:\n\nTheir table was among dozens crowding in around huge TVs, with plenty of appetizers to go around. There were also many heads towering above the crowd, including more Millers excited for a family-related sports bar outside downtown.\n\n\"I've got a lot of people asking about it, so (I'm) glad it's finally opened up,\" said Jordan Miller, a first cousin of Mike Miller and former player for Southwest Minnesota State who is now involved in the mortgage business in Sioux Falls.\n\n\"I drive down Western to work every day and been waiting for it,” he said. “To see it now, it looks amazing.\"\n\nThe bar is more than a typical sports bar.\n\nMore: Former NBA player Mike Miller to open restaurant in Turks & Caicos building\n\nInside and on the covered patio outside, memorabilia from the Argus Leader archives and other newspapers lines walls and floors. Like the Memphis-based location, the Sioux Falls version of Let it Fly pays homage to Mike Miller's connection.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to be back in South Dakota in some form or fashion,” Mike Miller said. “You never know where life’s gonna take you and five years ago I got into the restaurant business and this just happened to be the right time, the right place. We’re excited to be here.\n\n\"I approach everything like I do basketball. It's all about the people you surround yourself with.\"\n\nBy Tuesday’s 4 p.m. opening, there will still be gambling machines rolling in, but otherwise Let it Fly will be ready to go. Crowds of about 300 people are expected.\n\n“I expect to be on a two-hour wait immediately,” Landon Morlock, bar manager said.\n\nWith a summer opening, Morlock expects to be steady all season.\n\n“Should be no problem to fill this place up right away,” Morlock said."
