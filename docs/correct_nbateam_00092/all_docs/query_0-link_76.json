        "text": "Mike Miller laughed from the couch inside someone else’s office at a Germantown church, where the Houston High School boys basketball team had just finished practice.\n\nHe laughed before the question had even been completed. The same disarming laugh that can charm both a suburban basketball parent and LeBron James.\n\nDid Miller ever file the required paperwork to officially retire from the NBA?\n\n“No, I haven’t,” he said, almost four years removed from his last NBA appearance with the Denver Nuggets. “I don’t want to be retired.”\n\nMiller’s presence at Houston has been the most intriguing subplot of this most unusual Memphis area high school basketball season.\n\nHe has morphed from a 17-year NBA pro to one of college basketball’s best recruiters to a high school basketball coach willing to take on all-comers, assembling a national schedule and a veritable all-star team at the public school his two sons play for, even as he grapples with where exactly he’s going next.\n\nThe nation will get a glimpse of Miller, 40, patrolling a high school sideline for the first time Monday night, when Houston plays an impromptu game in Minnesota against Minnehaha High School and No. 1 recruit Chet Holmgren on ESPNU.\n\nPerhaps they too will wonder what he’s doing there and why he’s doing this.\n\n“We want to win games. We want to win a championship. But that’s not our major goal here,” Miller said. “Our major goal is it’s good for these kids to go out and get beat up by people. It introduces these guys to what college basketball will look like.”\n\nFrom Memphis to Houston\n\nThis wasn’t the plan.\n\nWhen Miller resigned as an assistant coach at Memphis under Penny Hardaway in June after just two seasons, he simply cited a desire to spend more time with his family in the midst of the pandemic. There were rumors he might join an NBA front office or become a player agent. He was already training R.J. Hampton for the NBA draft and involved in the restaurant business.\n\nHe didn’t know then that, six weeks later, he’d be announced as the Houston High School basketball coach.\n\nThat didn’t materialize until former Houston coach Charlie Leonard told athletic director Chad Becker he wanted to step away. Miller seemed like a logical replacement since his son, Mason, was the Mustangs’ best player. So Becker asked to meet with Miller and didn’t tell him why.\n\n“I didn’t want to give him an opportunity to say no before he got in there,” Becker said.\n\n“I thought it was to raise money,” Miller said. “The reason I did it is, selfishly, to spend more time with my kids.”\n\nBut what started as a career change for his family also became a way for Miller to address what didn’t go as planned when he worked for Memphis basketball.\n\nAt Memphis, \"you could see which kids came from programs that put in the time and the effort and came in knowing how to work, knowing how to do things, and also been told no before,\" he said.\n\nMiller wanted to make sure Mason, a Creighton commit – and by extension, his Houston teammates – didn’t succumb to the same pitfalls he encountered with the Tigers.\n\nBy the start of this season, new players had moved to the Houston school district in Germantown from San Antonio and Philadelphia and Minnesota to play for Miller, including 6-foot-9 LSU recruit Jerrell Colbert. Once former Wooddale star and Oregon recruit Johnathan Lawson joined the team in January, Houston had the state’s top three seniors on its roster.\n\nMiller insists he said no to many more transfers than he said yes to, but he recognizes that all four that he said yes to are Division I prospects. Their talent is part of the greater mission taking place, and it’s almost as if he’s describing last year’s maddening Memphis basketball team as he explains it.\n\nThe Mustangs have played games in Georgia, Alabama, South Dakota and the Washington D.C. area this season. Partly because the pandemic limits the regional competition available but mostly because “these kids need this,” Miller said.\n\n\"They need to lose. They need to get beat when they should win,” he added. “All that stuff needs to happen because otherwise you walk into a situation next year wherever you go, you lose a game and you’re shocked. One of the hardest things I had going from playing on an NBA basketball team to coaching in college was the assumption. You assume these kids know.\"\n\nA short-lived tenure?\n\nThis season played out perfectly in that regard.\n\nHouston lost Miller’s first game as a head coach against Christian Brothers. They also lost to Milton (Ga.) and IMG Academy, both ranked in the top 10 nationally by MaxPreps. But they’ve won every other game, including a top-10 win over Paul VI of Chantilly, Virginia.\n\nThey even played a game at the Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota, which meant Mason and Mavrick Miller, a sophomore, played in the same gym where their father’s jersey hangs in the rafters.\n\n“It’s been so good for Mason to have Mike,” said Ernie Kuyper, Miller’s cousin and a Houston assistant coach. “Mike just seems a lot happier.”\n\n“We trust him,” added point guard T.J. Madlock, the son of current Memphis basketball assistant Tony Madlock. “We’re trying to play everybody, top teams in the country, to show people what we can do.”\n\nMonday brings the biggest platform yet, but it also feels like a temporary one. Miller isn’t sure how long he’ll be a high school basketball coach. This might not even be what he does next year.\n\n“It’s been more difficult than I thought,” Miller admitted. “It’s really, really hard with my kids because I’m probably harder on them than anybody.”\n\nIt’s also hard because he could be described as any number of things right now.\n\nA father trying to make up for lost time. A high school coach trying to pass on wisdom. A trainer to the stars. A future agent or NBA executive or maybe even a college or professional head coach. A restaurant owner. And a secret weapon for his players in the latest NBA 2K game.\n\nThat last designation intrigued Miller most of all last week.\n\n“They make me a good shooter on there,” he said, and then the disarming laugh emerged once more.\n\nMiller doesn’t know where he’s going yet, just that he can’t be what he wants to be anymore."
