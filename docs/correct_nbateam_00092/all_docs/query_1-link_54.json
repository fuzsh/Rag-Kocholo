        "text": "There were plenty of players who found themselves playing for new cities this off-season. Whether we talk about LeBron James going to Miami or Royal Ivey going to Oklahoma City. Charles Barkley was 0-for-5 and unaware of his new team along with four other players if you caught Inside the NBA on Thursday as just an example of the frequent changes that can occur throughout the off-season.\n\nAll of these guys have a chance to improve their value or worth throughout the year. With these other players noted at this time, let's get to the 15 who start as the strongest on the list today.\n\nAriza in his first year with the Hornets has started out his first three games of the year as a thief collecting 8 steals. His field goal percentage is still a worry around 38 percent at this time. He has yet to hit the offensive boards, but helped New Orleans off to an 2-0 start.\n\nBlake showed an eye for the clutch when he hit a big three to give the Lakers the lead and eventual win an opening night showdown with the Rockets. That shot alone catapulted him into the top 15. There will not be whispers of him replacing Derek Fisher anytime soon, but that was still a great way to start his year as his team again starts the season dominate. I look for Blake to continue to grow in the purple and gold.\n\nGooden signed a decent contract this off-season and looks to make his worth through play. I could have gone with Gooden or Maggette; but I went with the one who has been healthier and playing better since the end of last season. Gooden could be more valuable then expected as Andrew Bogut still nurses his shoulder back into full working form. More play out of Gooden needs to be seen with him having an average to good beginning.\n\nHe's back after playing a year overseas, and he's never looked better now that he's with the Raptors in a starting role. He is showing that when given a chance he can be a decent starter in this league. We are of course only one week into the season so we have to see if this is just an early season start or develops into something bigger.\n\nOh, Tracy McGrady, how are you? You are limited to 15 minutes a night to start the season and I don't even recognize you. Could some NBA team just trade for McGraady so he can forget that he signed in to a situation that was detrimental to him. How about it Golden State? All you want to do is score anyway, T-Mac at least can give you that. Just give them a second round pick for him. Honestly, I want to see Tracy play and seeing him spending more time on the bench than the court is frustrating. We'll see if he's even worth noting come December.\n\nThe Knicks' starting point has been impressive enough during his first three games with the Knicks. His assists aren't as high as one would like currently as he has instead scored more so far than could have been predicted. His 45% field goal percentage is a welcoming site for those in the northeast part of the United States. He can move up this list if the Knicks can make more wins out of close games he attributes help in.\n\nHedo is entering a new phase in his career as he becomes a Sun. It is undecided to the fullest degree as to how he will fare. Nash should be able to help improve his anemic game north of the border with the Raptors. His ten points a game might seem rather low and that is justified by his shooting only 40% from the field. I'm not ready to put the axe to Turkoglu after only three games. I just want to see if Hedo still has the heart to be a good to great player.\n\nMichael is now in a featured role in Minnesota. His field goal shooting is decent at 45% this year and he is hitting the boards. His problem has been turnovers and making his free throws. Averaging 3.3 Turnovers per game is not going to get you into the All-Star game citing his horrendous showing on Saturday.\n\nThe big man is making big footsteps in green. Shaq looked very strong in his premier game with the Celts. Throwing down dunks off passes from Rondo that looks like it might become consistent for Shaq. Rondo's ability to find the open man, especially Shaq down low could help the game for both players. It will be intriguing to see if he cement himself as the starter until Kendrick Perkins gets back. Jermaine O'Neal should remain lurking in the shadows.\n\nCollison has been slightly below expectations in terms of assists like Raymond Felton as his scoring is also above his career average. There is definitely some time that will be needed to get him into the flow of his team. The steady improvement of Roy Hibbert along with the play of Danny Granger can only help. This team might have the makings of a Playoff team. We'll just have to see how much of that can be attributed to Collison.\n\nAl is putting up numbers with the Jazz the way he was with the Celtics and the T'Wolves. Unfortunately, the Jazz have been playing the blues with the slow start that they have received. Their loss to the Suns on Thursday was probably the roughest as every time they seemed to be clawing back into the game, Phoenix would push back the lead. Al did his part, it just wasn't enough. As much as I want to put him higher on the list, the lack of winning cannot put him any higher.\n\nThe running of the Warrior is David Lee's new title. As the big body for the Warriors, Lee has had ample opportunities to impose his will on opposition. It will be exciting to see Golden State and New York square off as the replacements face each other. I'm betting on Stoudemire to outplay Lee; but don't put it past David to slay Goliath, or Amar'e in this instance.\n\nBosh has had a quiet start for the Heat and that is neither positive or negative. He just hasn't shown up, yet he limits mistakes such as turnovers or allowing his opponent to have heavy scoring nights on him. He could have been more instrumental in Boston, but he like LeBron is trying to find his niche. I'll give him a pass for the week at #3, but that's based on his history of performance.\n\nStoudemire has definitely helped make New York a better team. No, they are not undefeated; but they are competing nightly and look like a legitimate Playoff team. Boston was hungry for a win after an abysmal showing against Cleveland. Boston showed up against New York on friday and barely prevailed as Stoudemire confidently led the Knicks to a close finish. His stat lines aren't mind boggling right now, but he is making strides for this team that pushes him ahead of Chris Bosh.\n\nJames is still LeBron James no matter how many turnovers he may commit during his first week of duty. LeBron had some shaky play against Boston as he tried to acclimate himself to playing with Dwyane Wade. They seemed to have the answer when they had their second challenge against Orlando at home on Friday. He was throwing solid passes and helped lead the Heat to a blowout of the Magic. He was also solid in his second game against Philadelphia which resulted in a win. Even an average week out of the king still gives him the throne."
