        "text": "Anthony Edwards is one of the most fascinating players to watch in the NBA right now. As he leads the Minnesota Timberwolves into an incredible playoff run, fans couldn’t help but be fascinated by what he’s doing on the court.\n\nWhile the man himself is trying to distance himself from any sort of comparison with Michael Jordan, his teammates cannot stop raving about his impact on the team. One of his teammates even went forward to talk about how great of a season he’s having.\n\nMike Conley praises Anthony Edwards’ importance on the Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nMike Conley has been in the Timberwolves roster for a while now, so he has a decent understanding of what makes the team tick. During a recent podcast appearance, he talked about the team’s current playoff run and what makes Edwards stand out from the myriad of players he’s worked with in the past.\n\nPer Yardbarker’s Sai Mohan:\n\n“He’s a guy who comes in early and leaves late,” Conley said of Edwards’ work ethic on “The Pat McAfee Show” on Tuesday. “He demands the most out of his teammates and competes everyday at practice. All that stuff — the mentality portion — is dead on.”\n\nConley also brought up the impressive maturity Edwards is showing in the locker room:\n\n“He’s taking an approach now where it’s all about winning — pumping up his teammates, knowing how to get guys going, knowing when to take over. It’s all happening in prime time, and it couldn’t happen to a better guy. He truthfully loves the game, the people he’s around and he has an infectious personality. The world is getting to know him a little bit now.”\n\nThese qualities are now showing itself through the impressive performances he’s had this postseason. He’s currently averaging 32.3 points, 6.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 1.8 steals on 54.7/41.9/81.8% shooting splits. These numbers are incredibly impressive for a player who’s yet to reach his physical peak.\n\nNow that the team has an impressive 2-0 series advantage over the Nuggets, Conley and the rest of the Timberwolves will be counting on Edwards to get them across the finish line.\n\nFor More Content"
