        "text": "With the Heat trailing the Spurs by five points early in the fourth quarter of Game 6, Miller's left shoe came off as he tried to defend Tiago Splitter's made shot in the paint. The veteran swingman didn't have any time to put it back on and played Miami's ensuing offensive possession without it. James found him with a quick pass and Miller set his mismatched feet. He swished his second three-pointer of the game, cutting San Antonio's lead to four."
