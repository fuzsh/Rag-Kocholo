        "text": "The Houston boys’ basketball team will enter the 2021-22 season without coach Mike Miller on the sideline.\n\nMiller, a former NBA player and Memphis Tigers assistant coach under Penny Hardaway, guided the Mustangs to a 21-3 record and the TSSAA Class AAA state championship in his only season with the team.\n\nHouston athletic director Chad Becker confirmed to The Commercial Appeal that Miller is no longer coaching at the school. Kurt Couvion, who was already an assistant coach, will be the coach this season, Becker said.\n\nHouston eliminated Clarksville and Oak Ridge, before defeating Cane Ridge, 62-43, for the title on March 20 at MTSU. Miller’s one season on the Mustang bench allowed him the chance to coach his son, Mason, who is now at Creighton.\n\nMiller, a two-time NBA champion, played 17 years professionally, including two different stints with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nThe Mustangs begin the season Monday with a Hall of Fame game at Beech."
