        "text": "\"Oh yeah, I loved the Wolves and (former Wolves star Kevin Garnett) from the day he got there,\" Miller said. \"When they played preseason games in South Dakota, I’d go to all of those. And they were all we had on TV, so I watched all their games.\"\n\n...\n\nOnly two members of the Wolves’ 18-player training camp roster have more pro experience than the nine-year veteran.\n\nCoach Randy Wittman said, upon Miller’s arrival, that he immediately challenged him to be a team leader.\n\n\"He’s just been great,\" Wittman said. \"Vocally he’s good, and he leads by example. He’s the first guy in the gym in the morning. He’s the first guy here for a night practice. That rubs off when you see guys like that.\"\n\nMiller said he’s fit into that role rather easily.\n\n\"I’m excited about the opportunity,\" Miller said."
