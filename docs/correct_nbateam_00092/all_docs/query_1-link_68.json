        "text": "Here we have the previous NBA 2023-24 Minnesota Timberwolves. Data, results from the previous season, a look at their squad and their future free agents, the objectives of the course, the player to follow and a prediction about the franchise.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nBalance 2022-23: 42-40 (8th West)\n\nCoach: Chris Finch (season 4)\n\nMost important free agents in 2024: Mike Conley, Kyle Anderson and Jordan McLaughlin\n\nHistory: The most important players in Minnesota history Timberwolves.\n\nThe franchise: The origin of Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nTemplate\n\nMovements in the market: Signature of Shake Milton. Renewals by Anthony Edwards, Naz Reid and Nickeil Alexander-Walker (here all the movements).\n\nBackcourt: Anthony Edwards, Jordan McLaughlin, Shake Milton, Troy Brown Jr., Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Vit Krejci, Daishen Nix, Tyrese Martin, Josh Minott and Wendell Moore.\n\nfront court: Karl-Anthony Towns, Rudy Gobert, Jaden McDaniels, Kyle Anderson, Naz Reid and Leonard Miller.\n\nThis is how they face the season\n\nThe 2022-23 season of the Timberwolves It was so conditioned by various obstacles, physical problems and transfers that it is difficult to draw too many conclusions. In fact, many of the doubts and questions that were addressed during the year will have to be resolved in this new course that is on the horizon.\n\nAlthough we cannot define the experiment as a disaster, the fears that existed around the inner couple formed by Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert were fulfilled. The French international did not live up to his years in Utah although he was vital in promoting Minnesota's defense up to the tenth best in the NBA. A piece of information, on the other hand, is insufficient, since it had a notable impact in the offensive area, where the game of the Timberwolves It became predictable, slow and undynamic. What the situation had to be like for Edwards to complain about it in the first week of the regular season when he was displaced from the offense, while the fans returned the first boos.\n\nTo be fair—and I don't know if this was a positive or negative—Towns missed 53 games, more than 60 percent of the season, so Chris Finch had little room to adjust to either interior. The coach has reiterated on several occasions that he still firmly believes in the coexistence of Towns and Gobert. In fact, Towns' injury translated into an 'extra life', as his position will be in serious danger if he does not achieve better results this year. As well as the very continuity of the front court, since trade rumors will accompany both if things start to go wrong.\n\nTowns' injury allowed the team's other two interior pillars to shine. Naz Reid provided an interesting but necessary balance between attack and defense that he was rewarded with his renewal for three years and 42 million. For his part, Jaden McDaniels continued his growth, in which he highlighted his defensive versatility and improvement in his three-point shot. Both will be very important when the starters are on the bench or suffer physical problems. Besides, the arrival of Mike Conley at the closing of the winter market It completely transformed the team's game into static. First, he took the burden of creation off of Edwards. Secondly, he facilitated greater discretion in the game. And, third, he got more involved with Gobert, with whom he hit it off in Utah.\n\nThe veteran point guard has one last year left on his contract, so management will have to decide whether to bet on him until the end of the season or release him before the market closes in February 2024 and incorporate a similar profile. But, for now, Conley appears to be a fundamental piece for Minnesota's offensive game. The team played well with McLaughin—even better than it did with D'Angelo Russell—but he is still a good backup. In fact, the incombustible Kyle Anderson serves as second quarterback in command thanks to his game vision and versatility. For his part, newcomer Shake Milton comprises a more vertical and scoring base mold that will help with points from the second unit. It will also be necessary to evaluate what youngsters like Wendell Moore and Leonard Miller can offer.\n\nThe truth is that the risky bet on Gobert last summer has meant that this has been much calmer: management has prioritized continuity in order to finish evaluating the current 'product'. We can define it as a double-edged 'sabbatical summer': if things do not go well, the summer period of 2024 will be very busy in Minnesota.\n\nThe squad currently has three players with maximum contracts—Edwards, Towns and Gobert—a price that is too high for a team that, for the moment, has not been able to get past the first round of the playoffs and that only franchises that intend to position themselves as authentic candidates would be willing to pay. And Minnesota is not, within a Western Conference in which up to twelve or thirteen teams emerge with legitimate chances of playing in the playoffs.\n\nThe player to watch\n\nAnthony Edwards has passed Karl-Anthony Towns on the right to position himself as the great star of these Timberwolves. The forward has been improving his performance each year and will begin this new season at full capacity after being the leader of the United States team in the World Cup, despite the disappointment suffered by not winning a medal.\n\nNow, a new step forward is expected from the former number one of the 2020 draft, although this could depend on his comfort on the court and whether the interior pairing formed by Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns is finally able to fit in and return positive returns. After scoring almost 25 points per game last season, Edwards aims to continue breaking records and establish himself as one of the best scorers in the NBA.\n\nHis enviable physical qualities also allow him to defend many different profiles of players and little by little he has added other resources as a secondary director thanks to his vision of the game, although in the playoffs he showed himself eminently as an executor. Indeed, in Minnesota they need their best and most complete version if they intend to break the barrier of the first round of the playoffs, which has been resisting them for 20 years. A leap, from star to superstar, which would also respond to the contract extension for 260 million dollars which he signed in July. As such it will be required from now on. And his competitive hunger is on point.\n\nNBA Preview 2023-24 Minnesota Timberwolves, forecast\n\nElio Martínez, director of nbamaniacs, leaves a personal and subjective forecast about what he believes each franchise will do during the season in the previous NBA 2023-24.\n\nIn the past I already expressed my doubts about the price paid by Gobert. Excessive by all means. Even more so considering that the bet was on a sporting experiment with an uncertain prognosis. A year ago, before the debut of the Torres duo, I predicted 48 victories for them. They did not reach that number due to Towns' injury and fit problems, so for 23-24 I am somewhat more pessimistic: 45 victories.\n\nPrevious team analyzed: New Orleans Pelicans. Next team: Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n(Cover photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)"
