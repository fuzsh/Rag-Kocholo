It’s an important time for all of us.”\n\nTeam owner Glen Taylor said at Monday’s news conference to announce the coaching move that he didn’t want too much change at one time because it could have been disruptive and he didn’t want to give up on this season.\n\nHe also said he discussed the situation beforehand with Hoiberg, who was asked if he was given any assurances about his position in the team’s long-range plans.\n\n“I’m just going to go out and focus on my role,” he said, “and see what I can do to help this team out in the short term and the long term.”\n\nShort term, Hoiberg said he will make phone calls to teams about possible trades in McHale’s absence in addition to his primary duties of scouting college players for next year’s NBA draft.\n\nStack will become the full-time point man for any trade calls the Wolves receive, but he said the team will continue to make personnel decisions by committee, with Hoiberg, McHale and Taylor having input.\n\n“Will I make strong recommendations knowing that I’m going to be fielding the calls? Absolutely,” Stack said. “And then we’ll talk among our group and see. We don’t always have a consensus when we talk things through. Will I be the guy to ultimately make that call? That will be up to Glen Taylor.”\n\nWith four first-round picks in next year’s draft, Stack said his phone has been “blowing up” with all the calls he has received since Monday.\n\nBoth front-office men will hit the road on scouting trips later this week—Hoiberg to the West Coast and Stack to the Midwest—and they said their jobs haven’t changed that much.\n\nTrade talk: Four first-round draft choices give the Wolves bargaining chips for a possible trade to replace forward Corey Brewer, who is out for the season with a knee injury.\n\n“I think Corey obviously gave us a dimension defensively and how Kevin envisions us trying to play with more of an up-tempo,” Stack said. “We’re going to have to keep an eye on that. Does Rodney Carney pick up some of those minutes? I think we’re going to try to see if we can rehabilitate Rashad McCants a little bit and see if he can kind of pick up where he left off last year.”\n\nRight stuff: Speaking from experience, Hoiberg said the Wolves made a good choice when they tapped McHale as coach.\n\n“I think Kevin will do a good job,” he said. “I played for Kevin in the 31 games he coached back in 2005, and he was great to play for. I played for him and Larry Bird, and I think both those guys have a unique ability to get inside your head and seeing what makes you tick. I think he made us all feel good being out there on the basketball court and that we could achieve anything. I hope he does that with this group.”\n\nBriefly: Shooting guard Mike Miller missed his third consecutive game because of a sprained right ankle.\n\nTuesday marked the 20-year anniversary of coach Jerry Sloan’s hiring by the Jazz.\n\nOriginally Published: December 8, 2008 at 11:01 p.m."
