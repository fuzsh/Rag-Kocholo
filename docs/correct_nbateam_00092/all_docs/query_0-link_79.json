        "text": "The Cavaliers are starting to take on the look of a winner.\n\nSince their inception in 1970, they have never won an NBA championship. That could be changing.\n\nThey introduced two minor pieces to their possible championship puzzle on Aug. 6 at Cleveland Clinic Courts in Independence. Even though neither Mike Miller nor James Jones will start or even play major minutes, they are proven winners.\n\nTogether they have won two NBA championship rings with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013. They have combined for seven appearances in the NBA Finals.\n\nBy signing LeBron James, it has changed the entire landscape with the Cavaliers. Now, it’s about finding the right players to fit around him. Both Miller and Jones appear to be perfect complementary players.\n\n‘When you talk about winning a championship, it’s an inexact science, but the components that are required are consistent,’ Jones said. ‘You need youth and you need athleticism. You need basketball IQ, you need chemistry and you need shooters and skill. More importantly, you need a culture of winning. The only way to establish a culture of winning is to have winners.\n\n‘The only thing this game is about is winning. You need every component to do that. We just hope to be two pieces to the puzzle.’\n\nCavaliers General Manager David Griffin is having an offseason that most front-office executives only dream about. He has been quoted as saying the Cavaliers wanted to have a ‘monumental’ offseason.\n\n‘It’s funny when I said monumental,’ Griffin said. ‘It was a complete slip-up and now I’m really grateful that I said that. I look like a visionary.’\n\nGriffin’s work is not over.\n\nThe Cavs are still trying to persuade veteran players like Shawn Marion, Ray Allen and possibly Chauncey Billups into accepting the veteran’s minimum. If they want a shot at another championship ring, they might be tempted to play for $1.4 million.\n\nGriffin is also embroiled in trade talks for Minnesota Timberwolves power forward Kevin Love. The Timberwolves are asking for swingman Andrew Wiggins in return.\n\n‘I don’t know if you can have six months like we’ve had, but it’s been special,’ Griffin said. ‘Obviously, when you get enough people who are like-minded and are about the right things, good things can happen.\n\n‘We’ve been really blessed to be surrounded by great people, great staff, great ownership that have brought some special things together. Obviously, having LeBron in the fold is the best recruiter you could possibly have. So when we ask him to reach out to somebody, guys like this are more than willing to listen.’\n\nThe Cavaliers now have 16 players on their roster.\n\n‘I don’t know at any point that we’re going to say we’re done or that the roster’s complete,’ Griffin said. ‘We’re happy with where we are and we’re going to try to build to a more complete roster, if there is such a thing.’\n\nGriffin said he has addressed several areas of weakness from last year’s 33-win team.\n\nThey have added shooters, players with a high basketball IQ, players with toughness and players that fit on the team.\n\n‘These gentlemen here represent all of those things,’ Griffin said. ‘These are some of the most mentally tough competitors I’ve ever gotten to watch or be with.\n\n‘Obviously, as we’re trying to take the next step toward being a championship team, these are pieces we absolutely had to have.’\n\nMiller said Cleveland is a blue-collar city.\n\n‘Winning a championship takes a lot of hard work,’ he said. ‘It’s one of the hardest things you’ll ever do.\n\n‘Obviously, LeBron James is the greatest player on the planet right now. That makes things easy.’\n\nMiller, who signed a two-year, $5.5 million deal, said he wouldn’t necessarily say this is a championship-or-bust proposition.\n\n‘It’s going to be crazy here next year, we understand that,’ he said. ‘For us, our goal is to win a championship, there’s no doubt about it. But we also understand how hard it is to win one. That’s our mindset going in and that’s what it will always be.’\n\nMiller acknowledged that James is driven to bring a championship home to Cleveland.\n\n‘I think his passion for wanting to bring a championship back here to Cleveland drives him more than anything,’ he said. ‘It’s one of the reasons me and James are sitting up here and we’re excited to be here. That’s one of the reasons, because he’s driven to do that and that’s exciting. For as much as he’s given us, for us to be a part of this and hopefully help him do what he wants to do would be awesome. He’s always driven. He always continues to be better. That shows how committed he is to winning championships.’\n\nQuick shots\n\nn James has apparently lost about 10 pounds by cutting out carbohydrates from his diet. Miller recently worked out with James at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School. ‘LeBron looks great,’ Miller said. ‘He has lost a little bit of weight, but he’s healthy. That’s probably a good thing for him. He’s going to put it back on when the season comes. For him right now, it’s getting into that shape and getting ready for the season shows his commitment level. He looked great and it was fun.’\n\nn Jones said he recently spent some time with Allen in Connecticut. ‘We talked about those things that are important to us, which are families, our legacies and our careers,’ he said. ‘So he has a decision to make. … Of course, we’d love to have Ray. Hopefully, he makes a decision that’s best for him, and hopefully it’s a decision to continue to play. But as far as where he goes and what he’s thinking, I don’t know. I’m pretty sure he knows the guys that are here up front, and LeBron, would love for him to play with us.’\n\nn Both Jones and Miller were brought to the Cavaliers to shoot 3s. With James, there are going to be a lot of open looks. ‘It’s a symbiotic relationship,’ Jones said. ‘Those guys tend to really appreciate what we do, being knock-down shooters, that gives them space. Whenever you have players as dynamic as we are, an extra 6 inches means the difference between an uncontested layup or a defensive rotation on the weak side. It’s great. I relish the opportunity to play with LeBron once again and the chance to play with Kyrie (Irving) because as a shooter, that’s what you want. You want good looks. Sometimes the looks can be too open, it gives you too much time to think, but we’ll live with those problems.’"
