        "text": "While his gesture at referees would likely have seen him receive some form of sanction, it was the Frenchman’s words following the game that undoubtedly sealed his fate. Yet, the question remains, why would a player of his stature make such outlandish claims without any solid reason?\n\nNBA fines Rudy Gobert $100K\n\nAccording to an NBA announcement on Sunday, Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert has been fined $100,000 by the NBA “for directing an inappropriate and unprofessional gesture” at an official on Friday and then proceeding to publicly criticize the officials who featured in that same game. If you caught our previous report, then you will know that Gobert’s gesture and subsequent comments took place during and after his team’s 113-104 overtime loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night.\n\nWith the score standing at 97-96 in favor of the Minnesota Timberwolves and 30 seconds left on the clock in the fourth quarter, Gobert committed his sixth and final foul of the night. As he attempted to justify his cause in front of officials, he was then given a technical foul on account of making the money gesture toward the referees, essentially suggesting that they were receiving money in exchange for results i.e., match-fixing. Compounding the issue is the fact that the Timberwolves would go on to lose the game to the Cleveland Cavaliers 113-104 in overtime, while Gobert could do nothing more than watch from the bench.\n\nRudy Gobert didn’t do himself any favors\n\nIndeed, what truly put Gobert in a tight spot is what he had to say about the situation following the game. Let’s just say that the former Utah Jazz big man did not mince his words as he spoke with the media, suggesting that gambling was an issue in the NBA and moreover, that it was influencing the league’s referees\n\n“I’ll bite the bullet again,” Gobert told reporters. “I’ll be the bad guy. I’ll take the fine, but I think it’s hurting our game. I know the betting and all that is becoming bigger and bigger, but it shouldn’t feel that way.” To his credit, Gobert that he shouldn’t have reacted the way he did after being called for his sixth foul, however, he did not walk back on the gesture that earned him a technical. “My reaction, which I think is truth — it’s what I truly believe — even if it’s the truth, it wasn’t the time for me to react that way,” Gobert said afterward. “I should have not done that. I cost my team the game, and obviously, they couldn’t wait to give me a tech. That was bad. That was an immature reaction.”"
