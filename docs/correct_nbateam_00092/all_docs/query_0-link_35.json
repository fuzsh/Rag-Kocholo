        "text": "After playing more than 1,000 NBA games with seven different teams over the course of 17 seasons, Mike Miller isn’t quite ready to walk out that door. But he knows the end is near.\n\nThe 37-year-old Mitchell native and two-time NBA champion finds himself without a roster spot after being waived by the Denver Nuggets in July. He’s staying in shape in case an opportunity arises to play one more season and extend what has been a storybook career for one of South Dakota’s most celebrated athletes.\n\n“I still enjoy playing, and I always will,” Miller said during a summer visit to Sioux Falls. “My family still enjoys me playing, which is most important. So we’re going to keep going as long as we can.”\n\nHis older brother Ryan, an assistant coach at Texas Christian University, confirmed this week that Mike’s attitude toward retirement hasn’t changed.\n\n“He’s not ready to call it quits,” Ryan said. “He doesn’t feel like it’s time.”\n\nOthers may dispute that assessment after Miller appeared in just 20 games for Denver last season, averaging fewer than three points a game for the third straight year. The Nuggets opted to release him rather than pay $3.5 million for the 6-foot-8 swingman’s services in 2017-18.\n\n“I think Mike will probably transition into a coaching or front office role,” says Basketball Insiders publisher Steve Kyler, who has covered Miller since his rookie year. “Even when he’s played lately, he’s been more of a mentor for young players and a solid locker room guy, as you saw with the Nuggets.”\n\nMiller has also done occasional work with ESPN, making guest appearances on First Take, so a future media role can’t be ruled out.\n\nRight now, though, he’s working out and spending family time in suburban Memphis with wife Jennifer, sons Mason and Mavrick and daughter Jaelyn. The 6-foot-6 Mason is a freshman at Houston High School in Germantown and plays for the Miller-sponsored M33M summer AAU program.\n\n“Mike’s in the gym with his boys all the time,” says Ryan. “He’s working with them but also keeping himself in basketball shape.”\n\nThe hope is that a contending team finds a roster spot open and seeks a veteran presence who can hit big shots when called upon. If that doesn’t happen by December, it’s likely that Miller will officially announce his retirement after a career that made him one of the greatest athletes in South Dakota history.\n\nHe silenced doubters who lingered even after he helped lead Mitchell to two state titles, became the state’s first and only McDonald’s All-American and sparked the University of Florida to an NCAA finals appearance as a sophomore in 2000.\n\nDrafted fifth overall by the Orlando Magic later that year, Miller was named Rookie of the Year to kick off a career that saw him play 1,032 games and tally 10,973 points for a scoring average of 10.3.\n\nHe was named Sixth Man of the Year with Memphis in 2006 and had his best statistical season the following year, averaging a career-high 18.5 points. But after appearing in just 20 playoff games with Orlando and Memphis and enduring cellar-dwelling stints with Minnesota and Washington, he was ready to chase postseason success.\n\nAs a free agent in 2010, Miller joined friend LeBron James in Miami and ended up winning a pair of NBA rings with the Heat in 2012 and 2013.\n\n\"We consider him to be the finest perimeter shooter in the NBA,” Miami president Pat Riley said after signing Miller.\n\nAs back issues and other injuries took their toll, Miller became less of an open-court threat and more of a spot-up shooter with reliable range. He ranks 20th all-time in the NBA record books with 1,590 made 3-pointers and 22nd in 3-point accuracy with a percentage of .407.\n\n“One thing you could always count on with Mike was quality, clutch shooting,” says Kyler. “And I’ll think he’ll also be known for toughness. Those back issues he went through, other players retire with those types of injuries. But Mike pushed through.”\n\nHis shining moment came during the 2012 Finals against Oklahoma City, when he came off the bench to score 23 points on seven 3-pointers in a decisive Game 5, limping every step of the way to clinch his first crown.\n\n\"It's been a roller coaster ride for everybody,\" Miller said when the subject of retirement was raised after that game. \"Everyone is dealing with something. Through the injuries, I'm just glad they didn't take me back to the barn and put me down. I'm just happy to be here.\"\n\nThat feeling continues as he tries to write the final chapter of a career that began in Mitchell, where his father served as middle school principal and opened up the gym for his three sons to shoot during cold South Dakota winters.\n\nMike went on to find success at the high school, college and NBA levels, not to mention international competition when he claimed a gold medal with Team USA at the 2002 Goodwill Games in Australia.\n\nFor as long as he can remember, he’s had a team to represent once basketball season arrived. That’s not the case this year, which means a very hard decision could be coming in the near future.\n\n“Every year is a new challenge and I enjoy those challenges,” he said over this summer. “Until I quit, finding something to replace this will be hard.”\n\nArgus Leader Media columnist Stu Whitney can be reached at swhitney@argusleader.com.
