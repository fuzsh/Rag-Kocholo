        "text": "David Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nIf Kyrie Irving does end up changing teams, Mike Miller believes the Denver Nuggets could be a top contender to land the Cleveland Cavaliers point guard.\n\nThe former Nuggets wing said Irving would consider a move to Denver on 950 AM Altitude Radio Wednesday.\n\n\"I think he will. I really do,\" Miller said, via Harrison Wind of BSNDenver.com. \"Like anything else, when people look at cities, Denver’s an unbelievable city we all know that. And with what the organization has built there, he would be crazy not to and he’s definitely, definitely interested in it and I told him by putting this thing out there he has no choice.\"\n\nIrving requested a trade earlier this month, with the hopes of joining one of the Minnesota Timberwolves, San Antonio Spurs, Miami Heat or the New York Knicks.\n\nHowever, the Nuggets would provide him the chance to be a go-to option while also having talented other players on the roster.\n\n\"I think it's perfect,\" Miller explained. \"If you can roll out Kyrie, Paul Millsap, and Joker [Nikola Jokic], and obviously, the other guys they have...You're a top-four team in the West.\"\n\nMiller spent the past two years in Denver and before that played with Irving on the 2014-15 Cavaliers that reached the NBA finals. He is currently a free agent after being waived this month.\n\nFrom the Cavaliers' perspective, the Nuggets have several intriguing young players like Emmanuel Mudiay, Gary Harris and Jamal Murray, as well as future draft picks, that they could use to complete a deal. It also would send their talented point guard to the Western Conference instead of an Eastern Conference rival."
