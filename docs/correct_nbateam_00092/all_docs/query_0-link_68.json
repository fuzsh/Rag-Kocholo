        "text": "College career\n\nMiller accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida, where he played for coach Billy Donovan's Florida Gators men's basketball team from 1998 until 2000. He quickly became known for his ability to hit the three-pointer. As a sophomore, Miller led the Gators to the 2000 NCAA Championship game, losing to Michigan State Spartans. He hit perhaps the most dramatic shot of the tournament that year in the opening round against Butler Bulldogs. As the fifth-seeded Gators trailed the underdog Bulldogs by one, Miller drove to the basket and laid it in as time expired. After the 2000 NCAA Tournament, he declared himself eligible for the NBA draft.\n\nOrlando Magic (2000–2003)\n\nThe following summer, Miller was taken with the fifth overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic. Miller won the 2001 NBA Rookie of the Year Award while being the only first-year player to appear in all 82 regular season games during the 2000–01 NBA season.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies (2003–2008)\n\nHe was traded to Memphis midway through 2002–03 NBA season. He was the recipient of the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award for the 2005–06 season. He averaged 13.7 points 5.4 rebounds 2.7 assists while shooting 47% from the field and 41% from three-point range, while playing 30.6 minutes per game.\n\nOn January 3, 2007, Miller made nine three-pointers in a win over the Golden State Warriors, breaking Sam Mack's Grizzlies franchise record of eight in a game set in February 1999. The two previous games Miller hit seven threes. This made him the first NBA player to hit at least seven three-pointers in three consecutive games since the Dallas Mavericks' George McCloud achieved it in 1996. Miller holds the Memphis Grizzlies franchise record for most points scored in a single game, with 45 on February 21, 2007, against the Golden State Warriors. After the 2006–07 NBA season, Miller was announced as a member of the USA Basketball team.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (2008–2009)\n\nOn June 26, 2008, Miller, Brian Cardinal, Jason Collins, and the 5th pick of the 2008 NBA draft, Kevin Love, were sent to Minnesota in exchange for Marko Jarić, Antoine Walker, Greg Buckner and the 3rd pick O. J. Mayo.\n\nWashington Wizards (2009–2010)\n\nOn June 23, 2009, Miller and Randy Foye were sent to the Washington Wizards for Oleksiy Pecherov, Etan Thomas, Darius Songaila and the 5th overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft. Miller suffered a shoulder injury and missed a few games during the early part of the 2009–10 NBA season.\n\nMiami Heat (2010–2013)\n\nOn July 15, 2010, Miller signed a five-year $25 million contract with the Miami Heat. He injured his thumb while guarding LeBron James in practice during the pre-season, sidelining him for several weeks. Miller officially returned to the Miami Heat lineup on December 20, 2010, in a home game against the Dallas Mavericks. Miller got his first start on January 22, 2011, due to a Dwyane Wade illness, and contributed with a season-high 32 points in a win over the Toronto Raptors. Miller averaged just 2.6 points a game in 12 minutes a game during the playoffs, with a high of 12 in game 4 against the Chicago Bulls. Miller made his first career NBA Finals appearance in the 2011 NBA Finals, which the Heat lost to the Mavericks 4–2.\n\nDuring the 2011–12 season, Miller made six of six three point field goals in a victory over the San Antonio Spurs to finish with 18 points in his return to the Heat, after missing several games because of an injury.\n\nIn the playoffs, Miller averaged 5.2 points per game, and scored in double figures at least once in each of the Heat's playoff series as Miami advanced to the NBA Finals to face the Oklahoma City Thunder. In game 5, Miller made seven three-pointers, setting the NBA Finals record for most three-pointers by a reserve. He had not made any three-pointers in the previous four games of the series. He finished with 23 points, 5 rebounds and a steal in game 5. Miami would go on to win the game and the NBA championship.\n\nDuring the 2012–13 season, Miller was inserted into the starting lineup 17 times and averaged 4.8 points per game for the season. The Heat would again advance to the NBA Finals, this time against the San Antonio Spurs. Miller was inserted into the last 4 games of the Finals to help space the floor, and scored 8 points in game 6 as the Heat barely squeaked out a victory. One highlight of the game was a three-pointer he made while wearing one shoe. The Heat won the series in game 7 on June 20, 2013, giving Miller his second championship.\n\nOn July 16, 2013, Miller was waived by the Miami Heat via the amnesty clause.\n\nSecond stint with Memphis Grizzlies (2013–2014)\n\nOn July 30, 2013, Miller signed with the Memphis Grizzlies. He saw his minutes and his importance increase with the slightly revamped Grizzlies team led by the new coach Dave Joerger. Miller played steadily for much of the season, finishing off as the only Grizzly to play all 82 regular season games and all 7 playoff games.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers (2014–2015)\n\nOn August 5, 2014, Miller signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers. In Cleveland, he joined former Miami Heat teammates LeBron James and James Jones. After averaging just 1.5 points in 12 minutes per game over the first 24 games of the season, Miller made his first start for the Cavaliers on December 19, 2014 against the Brooklyn Nets as he scored 21 points on 7-of-8 three-pointers in the 95-91 win. The Cavaliers made it to the 2015 NBA Finals, but they lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games.\n\nOn June 30, 2015, Miller exercised his player option with the Cavaliers for the 2015–16 season.\n\nOn July 27, 2015, Miller was traded, along with Brendan Haywood and two future second-round draft picks, to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for cash considerations. On September 28, 2015, he was waived by the Trail Blazers via a contract buyout.\n\nDenver Nuggets (2015–2017)\n\nOn September 30, 2015, Miller signed with the Denver Nuggets. He re-signed with the Nuggets on July 21, 2016, and was waived on July 11, 2017.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMiller and his wife, Jen, have three children: two sons, Mason and Maverick, and a daughter, Jaelyn. His daughter was born during the Heat's appearance in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals with a serious health issue stemming from pregnancy complications; he spent the first several days of his daughter's life shuttling between practices, games, and the hospital. He once owned a Java macaque named Sonny. He often tells the story in which his monkey escaped from his room: \"You would always put him in his room, and then we'd lock the door, and then we'd put the dogs out, and then we'd lock the front door. Well, he found out how to unlock doors, unlocked his door, went downstairs, let the dogs in the house and opened the front door. About an hour later we got a call from our neighbors, saying, 'Your monkey is riding your dogs around the neighborhood.' ... I said, 'C'mon y'all, y'all got to get in the house.\"\n\nLet It Fly Energy"
