        "text": "Mike Miller will return to the Memphis Grizzlies after spending the past five seasons with Minnesota, Washington and Miami, reports ESPN's Marc Stein.\n\nMiller spent more than five seasons with the Grizzlies from 2003-08. During the 2006-07 season, Miller had his most productive year in the league by averaging 18.5 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.3 assists with Memphis. Having aged, the recently-amnestied swingman will give first-year coach Dave Joerger a three-point shooting threat to complement the inside-out combo of big man Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph.\n\nGrizzly Bear Blues: More on Memphis' offseason\n\nThe Grizzlies beat out the Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets and Denver Nuggets for Miller's services.\n\nDespite Miller being 33 years old and coming off consecutive injury-plagued seasons, his 2013 title run with the Miami Heat gave him the chance to show he still has some juice left. Miller played in just 59 regular-season games and averaged 4.8 points, but in the playoffs he shot 44 percent from three-point range and played at least 16 minutes per game in the NBA Finals series against the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nMiller scored 15 points in a Game 3 loss by hitting all five of his three-pointers, but he hit one of the biggest shots -- a three-pointer without a shoe -- of the seven-game series in the Heat's comeback victory in Game 6.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• The top 60 rookies at NBA Summer League\n\n• Carmelo Anthony sidesteps Lakers rumors\n\n• 3 teams observe Greg Oden's workout\n\n• Kyrie Irving \"had a lot of growing up to do\"\n\n• Flannery: Analytics and coaching in the NBA"
