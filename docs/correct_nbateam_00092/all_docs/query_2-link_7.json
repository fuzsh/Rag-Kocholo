        "text": "American basketball player (born 2001)\n\nAnthony Edwards (born August 5, 2001), nicknamed \"Ant-Man\" or simply \"Ant\",[1] is an American professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A shooting guard, he played college basketball for the University of Georgia Bulldogs and was selected with the first overall pick by the Timberwolves in the 2020 NBA draft. He was named an All-Star during the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons.\n\nEdwards finished his high school career at Holy Spirit Preparatory School in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia, where he was rated a consensus five-star recruit and one of the best players in the 2019 class by major recruiting services. As a senior, he earned McDonald's All-American and USA Today All-USA first team honors. He committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the highest-rated recruit to do so, and was named SEC Freshman of the Year after his freshman season with the team.\n\nEarly life\n\nEdwards spent his early life in Oakland City, Atlanta, Georgia.[2] When he was three years old, he was given the nickname \"Ant-Man\" by his father. For much of his childhood, Edwards played football in the running back, quarterback, and cornerback positions.[3] He played youth football for the Atlanta Vikings and became one of the best Pop Warner running backs in the country by age 10.[3][4][5] Edwards switched his focus to basketball because he \"thought it looked more fun\" after watching his brothers play the sport. He often played basketball with his brothers at their grandmother's house. Entering ninth grade, he began training with Justin Holland, a former college basketball player for Liberty and an Atlanta-based basketball trainer.[3]\n\nHigh school career\n\nDue to his success with the Atlanta Xpress 15-under Amateur Athletic Union team, Edwards was considered a four-star recruit by Rivals in 2016.[6] He began playing high school basketball for Therrell High School in Atlanta as a member of the 2019 class.[7] In early January 2017, Edwards transferred to Holy Spirit Preparatory School in Atlanta and reclassified to the 2020 class. He made the move in an effort to improve his academic performance, since Holy Spirit Preparatory had \"small class sizes and support to help that.\"[8]\n\nIn March 2018, Edwards helped Holy Spirit Preparatory defeat The Heritage School for the Georgia Independent School Association (GISA) Class AAA state championship.[9] He reclassified back to the 2019 class in November 2018 after seeing academic improvement.[7][10] As a result, Edwards rose to become the number one recruit in the Top247 rankings by recruiting website 247Sports.[11] In his senior season, his team finished as GISA Class AAA runners-up to The Heritage School, despite 27 points from Edwards.[12] At the end of the season, he was averaging 29 points, nine rebounds, and two assists per game.[13] Edwards garnered USA Today All-USA first team recognition.[13][14] He played in the McDonald's All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic in March and April 2019, respectively.[15][16]\n\nRecruiting\n\nBy consensus among major recruiting services 247Sports, ESPN, and Rivals, Edwards was rated a five-star recruit, top-five player, and the top shooting guard in the 2019 class.[17][18][19] On February 11, 2019, he committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the program's best recruit in the modern recruiting era.[20][21] Edwards chose the Bulldogs over offers from Florida State, Kansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina.[7] He was drawn to Georgia because two of his favorite players, Dwyane Wade and Victor Oladipo, had been coached in college by head coach Tom Crean.[22]\n\nUS college sports recruiting information for high school athletes Name Hometown High school / college Height Weight Commit date Anthony Edwards\n\nSG Atlanta, GA Holy Spirit Prep (GA) 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) 205 lb (93 kg) Feb 11, 2019 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: N/A Rivals: 247Sports: ESPN: ESPN grade: 96 Overall recruiting rankings: Rivals: 3 247Sports: 1 ESPN: 4\n\nNote: In many cases, Scout, Rivals, 247Sports, and ESPN may conflict in their listings of height and weight.\n\nIn these cases, the average was taken.

Rivals.com .\n\nCollege career\n\nOn November 5, 2019, Edwards made his debut for the Georgia Bulldogs, recording 24 points, 9 rebounds, and 4 steals in a 91–72 win over Western Carolina. It was the most points by a Georgia freshman debutant since Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Dominique Wilkins in 1979.[23] On November 26, he scored a season-high 37 points, including 33 in the second half, and posted six rebounds, four steals, and three blocks in a 93–85 loss to third-ranked Michigan State at the Maui Invitational. Edwards became the first Georgia freshman to score at least 37 points in a game since Jacky Dorsey in 1975.[24] In his final game at the tournament, he led all scorers with 24 points and made the game-winning shot against NCAA Division II team Chaminade.[25]\n\nOn February 1, 2020, Edwards recorded 29 points and 15 rebounds, both game-highs, in a 63–48 victory over Texas A&M.[26] In his next game, he led all scorers with 32 points in an 81–75 loss to Florida.[27] On February 26, Edwards scored 36 points and collected seven rebounds, four assists and four steals, in a 94–90 overtime defeat to South Carolina.[28] As a freshman, he averaged 19.1 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game.[29] Edwards was the top scorer on his team and among freshmen nationally. He earned second-team All-SEC and SEC Freshman of the Year honors.[30] Edwards collected SEC Freshman of the Week accolades four times during the season, the most in program history.[31] He was also one of five finalists for the Jerry West Award, which recognizes the top collegiate shooting guard.[32]\n\nOn March 20, 2020, in the spring of his freshman year, Edwards declared for the 2020 NBA draft as one of the most touted prospects in his class. He signed with an agent, forgoing his remaining college basketball eligibility.[33]\n\nProfessional career\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (2020–present)\n\n2020–21 season: All-Rookie honors\n\nThe 2020 NBA draft was delayed by five months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

His 41 points also set a Timberwolves franchise record for the most points scored in a playoff game, surpassing Sam Cassell's previous record of 40.[47] On April 21, in Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, Edwards scored 36 points in a 120–111 loss. He joined Kobe Bryant with the second-most 30-point NBA playoff games before turning 22 years old.[48] In Game 4, Edwards had 34 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 3 blocks and scored a crucial 3-pointer to lead the Timberwolves to a 114–108 overtime win.[49] In Game 5, the Timberwolves were eliminated from the playoffs by the eventual NBA champion Nuggets despite 29 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2 blocks by Edwards.
