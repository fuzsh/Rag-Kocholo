        "text": "You can’t talk about South Dakota State basketball and not mention Macy Miller. Saturday she showed the nation why scoring a tournament high 28 points here at the Carrier Dome. After that heartbreaking loss to Stanford three years ago to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, she hopes her historic career isn’t done just yet.\n\nBasketball is a way of life in the Miller family.\n\n“I truly say that when I grew up I thought you had to be a basketball player, I didn’t think about anything else,” said her father Alan..\n\nAnd it’s no different for the youngest, Macy Miller, who recently became the Summit League’s all-time leading scorer.\n\n“My dad has always been like a coach to me but always a father as well. He always has that tough love for me,” said Macy\n\n“She had the daycare kids also practicing with her. She would put on a Michael Jordan jersey and have the daycare kids drive to the basket and she would try to block the shot,” said Alan.\n\nIt’s pretty easy when the redshirt senior comes from a South Dakota basketball dynasty. Her dad is the all-time leading scorer at Dakota Wesleyan, two of her uncles also played collegiately. and you can’t forget about cousin Mike who spent 18 years in the NBA.\n\n“I mean it was, they would sit at Christmastime and hear the stories of one story after another how one game they performed, and I think Macy just kind of absorbed that,” said Alan.\n\n“I’d say I just kind of grew into it. Seeing the love that they had for the game and the success that they had really motivated me and really pushed me like them and grow from their game as well,” said Macy.\n\nBut the Miller’s are about to hang up their legacy, at least for now.\n\n“It's hard to explain, but it fed off each other as we went down through generations. Macy is truly the last horse in the barn,” said Alan.\n\nThis weekend is extra special for dad, as he could be seeing his youngest daughter make program history at SDSU, sending the Jackrabbits to their first ever Sweet Sixteen.\n\n“She just wanted to be good. I can’t explain it. She really enjoys being on the floor with a full house of people, it’s like she feels like she’s meant to be there,\" said Alan.\n\nAfter a heartbreaking loss to Stanford in the round of 32 in 2016, Miller wants to continue making history with this year’s team and keep her historic career going for the Jackrabbits.\n\n“After that game if you saw her picture on TV she was crying, so we knew it hurt her quite a bit,” said Alan.\n\n“That loss was a tough one but it’s always been a chip on our shoulder and always been a motivator. Every off-season we talked about how close we were to the Sweet 16 and how we know we can get there,” said Macy.\n\nMacy’s dad also mentioned that she hopes to continue her basketball career professionally after she graduates from South Dakota State in the spring."
