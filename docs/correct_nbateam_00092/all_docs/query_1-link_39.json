Player selections were made by the USA Basketball Men's Senior National Team Committee. The Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Center in Queensland, Australia, will play host to Goodwill Games basketball competition from Sept. 3-9.\n\nIn addition to Marion, members of the 2001 USA Basketball Men's Goodwill Games Team are Shane Battier (this season's college Player of the Year/Duke '01), Baron Davis (Charlotte Hornets), Marc Jackson (2001 All-NBA Rookie First Team/Golden State Warriors), Rashard Lewis (Seattle SuperSonics), Mark Madsen (Los Angeles Lakers), Kenyon Martin (2001 All-NBA Rookie First Team/New Jersey Nets), Andre Miller (Cleveland Cavaliers), Mike Miller (2001 NBA Rookie of the Year/Orlando Magic), Jermaine O'Neal (Indiana Pacers), Wally Szczerbiak (Minnesota Timberwolves) and Jason Terry (Atlanta Hawks).\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves head coach Flip Saunders will serve as the head coach and he will be assisted by Orlando Magic head coach Glenn Rivers, Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo and Dayton head coach Oliver Purnell.\n\nEight of the chosen players - Davis, Jackson, Marion, Martin, Andre Miller, Mike Miller, Szczerbiak and Terry - participated in the 2001 Schick Rookie Challenge that was held during the annual NBA All-Star Weekend.

The USA captured gold in 1998 and 1986, silver in 1990 and bronze in 1994.
