        "text": "The NBA has 12 games on the docket for December 2, including two afternoon contests. The Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers kick off the action with a 4 p.m. (ET) tip. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Timberwolves face the Charlotte Hornets at 5 p.m. (ET). The Warriors will be without Chris Paul again, while the Timberwolves may not have Anthony Edwards.\n\nNBA Rumors: Anthony Edwards, Brandon Miller, and Chris Paul Updates\n\nWarriors vs. Clippers\n\nGolden State (9-10) and Los Angeles (8-10) enter Saturday’s matinee as two of the most disappointing teams in the Western Conference. However, the Warriors have won three of its last five games following their 120-114 victory over the Clippers on Thursday night. But the Dubs will again be without Paul (lower leg) and Gary Payton II (right calf).\n\nPaul will miss his second consecutive game as he sustained the injury late in the first quarter of Tuesday’s game against Sacramento. More information on how long Paul will be out will be known on Monday when he is re-evaluated. Payton was also injured on Tuesday, but he is expected to be sidelined for several weeks, per ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nAndrew Wiggins is questionable after missing his first game of the season on Thursday with a finger injury. Warriors coach Steve Kerr described to ESPN’s Kendra Andrews why Wiggins sat out the contest. Wiggins is considered questionable for tomorrow’s affair.\n\nMason Plumlee remains out for the Clippers with a knee injury. Plumlee has been sidelined since November 7 and will be re-evaluated in a little more than a week. Brandon Boston Jr is questionable to make his season debut as he has been sidelined with a quadriceps injury.\n\nTimberwolves vs. Hornets\n\nMinnesota (14-4) sits atop the Western Conference standings as they head to Charlotte on a three-game winning streak and have won eight of 10 overall. However, the Timberwolves will likely be without Edwards for a second straight game as he is listed as doubtful. Edwards sustained a right hip contusion on Tuesday against Oklahoma City.\n\nJaylen Clark, Jaden McDaniels, and Jordan McLaughlin have been declared out by the Timberwolves."
