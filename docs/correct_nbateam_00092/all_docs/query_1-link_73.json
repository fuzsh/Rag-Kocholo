        "text": "The Minnesota Timberwolves 105-100 Game 4 victory against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday was actually Mike Conley’s first-ever Conference Finals win in his NBA career.\n\nThe last time Conley made it this far was in the 2012-13 Western Conference Finals when he was still the lead guard for the Memphis Grizzlies, but they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, who went on to lose to the Miami Heat in seven games in the Finals.\n\nAnd now that he got his first one, the one-time NBA All-Star is gunning for at least one more when the WCF moves back to the Target Center in Minnesota for Game 5 on Thursday. Because wins like this don’t come too often, Mike Conley said he is not taking this for granted, especially playing for a young team like the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\n“They honestly taught me to be grateful for the joy of this game, having fun,” the 17-year NBA veteran said in the postgame press conference via Nadine Babu on X (formerly known as Twitter). “You play 17 years, you can go into this cycle, and they brought that excitement back.”\n\n“(It’s) like I’m a 15-year-old going to play out in the park or something. They’re keeping me young, and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else,” he concluded.\n\nAnthony Edwards jokes about Mike Conley’s age after Minnesota Timberwolves’ Game 4 win\n\nEven at 36, Mike Conley remains one of the team’s key players. He had a good Game 4 outing for the Minnesota Timberwolves, finishing with 14 points, seven assists, three rebounds, and four steals on 5-of-9 shooting from the field in 34 minutes of action.\n\n“Mike Conley is here and he’s old as f**k,” Anthony Edwards said about Mike Conley to reporters postgame. “And he was getting downhill, laying the ball up, so shoutout to Bite Bite.”\n\n“That’s my OG. That’s my point guard. He played great tonight, and I couldn’t ask more from him, so thank you, Mike Conley,” he added."
