He’d been accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a bar last year while on a road trip to attend a football game, leading to a suspension by the school that eventually was halted by a federal judge’s ruling that his civil rights had been violated. Shannon testified at the trial he’d never seen the woman. His lawyers called the case a “blind accusation.”\n\nThe seriousness of the situation loomed over Shannon and the Illini all season, but they rarely wavered. Shannon, who was an All-Big Ten first team and All-American third-team selection by The Associated Press, was voted the Most Outstanding Player of the Big Ten Tournament after a three-day thrill ride at Target Center gave the Illini the title.\n\n“It made me a better leader,” Shannon said Wednesday. “I just gravitated toward my team and my coaches more, my family.”\n\nThe two rookie guards were introduced at a news conference in the Target Center atrium, after they each threw out ceremonial first pitches the night before at a Twins game across the street.\n\nThe Timberwolves also rounded out their roster with an agreement Wednesday on a one-year, $3.3 million contract with free agent forward Joe Ingles, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal had not yet been finalized.\n\nIngles spent the first eight seasons of his career with Utah, where he played with current Timberwolves Mike Conley and Rudy Gobert. The 6-foot-9 native of Australia will join his fourth team in four years after playing for Milwaukee and Orlando the previous two seasons.\n\nWhen the accusation arose last December, Shannon for legal reasons stopped doing interviews despite being the star player of a top-15 team that reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament before getting blown out by eventual champion UConn.\n\nTwo months ago at the NBA pre-draft combine, he finally broke his silence, though because the trial was looming he stopped short of discussing any subject beyond basketball.\n\n“I feel like I’m a good kid. I make sure everybody’s good, and I just take care of everybody around me,” Shannon said then in Chicago.\n\nThe Timberwolves were adamant about the quality of Shannon’s character. President of basketball operations Tim Connelly said the team did “a ton” of due diligence and was nothing but encouraged about the person and the player it was getting.\n\n“He was on the wrong end of a really unfortunate situation and his ability to play through that and play winning basketball for a great coach in Brad Underwood, we just think brings toughness,” Connelly said.\n\nOn a team already established as a true championship contender that has all but one reserve — Kyle Anderson, who’s on his way to Golden State — coming back from the regular rotation, Dillingham and Shannon can learn from a stalwart like Conley and watch a superstar like Anthony Edwards without being forced into too much action too soon.\n\n“I wouldn’t think I’d go to a contender right off the bat,” Dillingham said. “I’m just happy that I’ve got to learn from so many vets on the team.”\n\nAfter averaging 23 points per game and becoming one of the best two-way players in the country last season, Shannon at age 23 with five seasons of major conference experience — he started his college career at Texas Tech — ought to be as rotation-ready as any of the recent draft picks on Minnesota’s roster. Dillingham is just 19. Shannon is older than second-rounders from the previous two drafts, too: Jaylen Clark (22), Leonard Miller (20) and Josh Minott (21).\n\n“There’s roles to be had,” coach Chris Finch said. “There’s roles to be earned.”\n\nMORE SPORTS COVERAGE\n\nYankees’ Giancarlo Stanton reveals return plan\n\nTeam USA vs. South Sudan FREE LIVESTREAM (7/20/24) | Watch Team USA basketball game online\n\nHow to watch Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry: LIVE STREAM, PPV info, price, start time for Jake Paul boxing match\n\nHow to watch Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese in 2024 WNBA All-Star Game vs. Team USA| FREE live stream, time, TV, channel\n\nDid a Yankees reporter really influence Aaron Boone’s new-look lineup?"
