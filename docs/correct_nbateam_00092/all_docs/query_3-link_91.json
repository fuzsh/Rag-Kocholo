        "text": "MEMPHIS — It’s mid-November and Mike Miller is on the sideline, his play sheet tucked into the back pocket of his dress slacks.\n\nBut he has traded in his custom Brandon Williams suit jacket for a hooded sweatshirt. He’s wearing a snapback Nike cap. He’s not on the FedExForum court; he’s a visitor on the sideline at Olive Branch High School in Mississippi.\n\nMiller, who spent the last two years at Memphis as Penny Hardaway’s lead assistant, is making his debut as the boys’ basketball coach at Houston High School.\n\nWhen Miller announced he was stepping down from Memphis in June, he said it was so that he could spend more time with family. Little did he know then just how much time he’d actually be spending with them. His two sons, Mason and Mavrick, play for Houston.\n\nFor most of his kids’ lives, Miller engaged in a profession that took him away. He played for seven NBA teams in his 17-year career, and the family only followed him when he signed multi-year contracts. When the Grizzlies traded him to the Timberwolves in 2008, the family stayed back in Memphis. When he signed with the Nuggets in 2015, the family stayed back in Ohio.\n\nEven after retiring in 2017, he took just a year off before diving right back into the grind of basketball at Memphis.\n\n“The biggest thing to be successful in family and coaching and playing is sacrifice,” Miller told The Athletic. “My family sacrificed a lot for me to play for 17 years. At Memphis, it was the same thing. I was always worried about recruiting the next kid and coaching the right way. The family almost played like a second fiddle.”\n\nSo when the Houston job opened in July, he pursued it. Not to scratch the coaching itch, because he could’ve just come back to Memphis for a third season if it was about that. Having been partly absent from family life at best over the last 20 years, he saw a once-in-a-lifetime chance.\n\n“The pandemic really made a lot of people, not just me, second-guess a lot of things in life,” Miller says. “It was the first time I was home with my family in 20 years. That little bit of time made me realize this stuff is short. It was strictly to be with my kids and have fun with it.”\n\nFour games into the experience, he already has had plenty of fun.\n\nIn the Mustangs’ home opener last week, Mason, a senior who is committed to Creighton, made a play his dad never saw coming. The call was 54 Get, a set designed for Mason to take a dribble hand-off in the high post and drive downhill to the rim. Except the defender cut off his drive. The 6-9 forward picked up his dribble at the foul line and, with nowhere else to go, caught the defense off guard by throwing the ball off the glass to himself and dunking it home.\n\nHis dad exploded off the bench.\n\n“He did a little shimmy,” Mason says. “Having my dad coach me has just been really fun.”\n\nBut there are challenges that come with the dual responsibility, and Miller is still learning how to strike the balance. In one practice, he didn’t like the look on his oldest son’s face. His job was to help on the backside defensively. Miller didn’t appreciate the effort.\n\n“He just ran into my brother, like knocked him down,” says Mavrick, a sophomore. “Just trucked him.”\n\nHe’s not sparing his youngest either. In another practice, he made the entire team run because Mavrick didn’t do his homework. The coach let the entire team know too.\n\n“If I do something wrong at home, he definitely takes it to practice,” Mavrick says. “He said at first he wasn’t gonna do that. He’s a lot harder on us.”\n\nMiller readily admits that, by the way. But that was the point in accepting the job: to take a hands-on approach to his sons’ development, not go easy on them because they’re his kids.\n\n“It’s a never-ending balance, with young kids or any kids period,” he says. “Any coaching is day-to-day. They come to practice with energy one day, other days they don’t. You’re always trying to find that balance. When the horn goes off and the whistle goes up, it’s Dad time.”\n\nIt may not come as a surprise that someone who ranks in the top 30 in NBA history in 3-pointers made and who owns a sports bar in Memphis called Let it Fly coaches his team to shoot a lot from beyond the arc. Miller runs a modern, up-tempo offense, and his sons are thriving in it. Mason is averaging 22 points and 10 rebounds a game, which is nearly double his production from a year ago. Jerrell Colbert, a four-star, 6-9 forward who has committed to LSU, moved to Memphis over the summer from San Antonio to be a part of Miller’s system.\n\nThrough four games, the team is 3-1. They’ve scored 75 points or more in three of those four games.\n\n“Eighteen years in the NBA, him being around all the greats like Lebron and Kobe — he teaches a lot of stuff,” Mavrick says. “He knows a lot, which is helping me. I hope to get all of his 18 years of experience in my game.”\n\nHow long does this all last? That’s anybody’s guess. Miller and his staff, which includes former Grizzlies and Kings assistant Bob Thornton, are all coaching on a volunteer basis. Mason graduates in the spring. Because Mavrick is only a sophomore. Miller could stay for two more years, to see his youngest son through. He could decide to do something else entirely after a year.\n\nSeveral years ago, Hardaway parlayed his high school job at East High School in Memphis into the job with the Tigers. Miller has no such plans, for now.\n\n“There’s really no endgame,” he says. “If I’m coaching somewhere else, it’s gonna be a spontaneous thing. I don’t have plans on doing that.”\n\nAs much as his decision to coach Houston was about his two sons, his 9-year-old daughter, Jaelynn, is benefiting too. On Dec. 3, while the Tigers were taking on Central Arkansas at FedExForum, Miller was escorting her to a father-daughter dance. He missed the same school function a year ago because of a Tigers’ road trip. When she realized she would have a date this year, she couldn’t stop talking about it.\n\n“I think that is the best part of everything,” Miller’s wife, Jennifer, says. “He’s home. He’s super involved. He never had the opportunity before, because we weren’t always in the same place or he was in-season with the Tigers. Practice, on the road. This has been an amazing time.”\n\nMiller is a former Sixth Man of the Year and Rookie of the Year in the NBA. He won two championships alongside LeBron James in Miami. He made a Final Four appearance at Florida before becoming a top-five draft pick. He made more than $90 million during his pro career.\n\nThose closest to him believe he’ll look back on his time at Houston High, however long that might be, as the best of his life.\n\nHe’s not FaceTiming a five-star prospect. He’s not on the road twice a week. He’s home.\n\n“One, he’s a grinder, so he’s always grinding,” his assistant coach and cousin, Ernie Kuyper, says. “The best part is he’s grinding with his family by his side. He’s able to watch his kids grow up and become young men, and he’s able to be a big part of that. This will be the absolute best time of his life. It’s a beautiful sight.”\n\n(Photos: Courtesy Derek Malloy)"
