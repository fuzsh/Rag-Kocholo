        "text": "“I knew zero about Memphis,” said Mike Miller. “I knew absolutely nothing.”\n\nThis was more than 15 years ago. This was when he was told he had been sent to the Memphis Grizzlies as part of a deal for Drew Gooden.\n\nMiller had grown up in South Dakota. He had spent his entire college (Florida) and professional (Orlando Magic) career in Florida.\n\nMore: Mike Miller 'excited' to join Penny Hardaway's staff at Memphis\n\n“I didn’t really know what to expect,” he said.\n\nHe certainly didn’t expect to find a home.\n\nBut that’s what Memphis has become to him. It’s the place where he decided to raise his family, the place where he decided to start his AAU team, the place where he decided — as a new assistant coach for the University of Memphis — to begin a new career.\n\nThe man made roughly $98 million over 17 seasons in the NBA. He could be living and working (or not working) anywhere in the world.\n\nMore: Penny Hardaway, Memphis chase nation's top recruits as college hoops evaluation period begins\n\nHe picked Memphis.\n\nAnd he wishes people would stop acting so surprised.\n\n“Since I came back, every morning I work out at Lifetime Fitness, and if I had a dollar for every time someone came up to me asked me why I chose Memphis,” he said, not finishing the thought, but you know what he means.\n\nThis is the second time Miller chose Memphis, actually. The first time was in 2013, when Miller — who was traded to Minnesota as part of the O.J. Mayo/Kevin Love deal, then went on to win two championships with the Miami Heat — decided to return to the Grizzlies as a free agent.\n\nThe team held a big public press conference at FedExForum to celebrate the occasion. There was all sorts of talk about Miller retiring with the franchise. But Jason Levien was president of basketball operations at the time. By the end of the season, Levien was gone, Chris Wallace was back calling the shots, and the Grizzlies decided to let Miller go.\n\nCalkins: Penny Hardaway is aiming high, as in national championship high for Memphis Tigers\n\n“By that time in my career, I’d seen the business side of the league,” Miller said. “I don’t fault anyone for making the decision. At the end of the day, they signed a great player, Vince Carter, and he was great for them. Are you upset? Of course. You’re a person with feelings. But that wasn’t going to change the way I feel about Memphis. I knew where I wanted to be.”\n\nSo, sure enough, Miller returned to the city after the 2016-2017 NBA season, his last in the league. He started spending more time working with the players on his AAU team. That’s when he realized he wanted to coach.\n\n“I saw the ability to have an impact on some of the kids,” he said. “I didn’t want to be away from basketball. I was offered NBA jobs, I was offered some front office stuff. But I started to see the impact I could have by coaching. I still didn’t know it was going to be college, but I knew what I wanted to do.”\n\nNext thing you know, Penny Hardaway had replaced Tubby Smith and was looking for assistants. He invited Miller in for an interview.\n\nMore: Memphis basketball coach Penny Hardaway discusses new recruits and a potential assistant\n\nThe two men didn’t actually know each other particularly well. The initial interview was just to explore if it might work.\n\n“But finally sitting down with Penny, it was almost like I was looking at a mirror,” Miller said. “He didn’t need the money. He obviously had a long NBA career. He coached middle school and had an AAU team. He wants to make an impact on kids. He’s in it for the same reasons as me.”\n\nMiller still is figuring out all the ins and outs of being a college coach. He is so wary of making a mistake — so connected to the Memphis compliance staff — “I basically make six phone calls before I make one,” he said.\n\nBut Miller, 38, has absolutely no doubt that the Memphis staff is going to crush it, starting with recruiting.\n\n“The way we want to play, the things we want to do, the players we want to recruit, there is no better place in the world to go and learn,” he said. “If you want to be a doctor, hang out with doctors. If you want to be a pro, hang out with pros. There’s a reason I made it 17 seasons in the NBA and it’s not because I’m the most talented, it’s not even close.\n\nMore: Memphis forward Karim Sameh Azab announces he's been diagnosed with leukemia\n\n“A lot of the kids that we’re going to recruit are going to be pros no matter where they go. But are they ready to be pros? Our job is to make them ready. I honestly don’t think there’s a better place in the country to go, if that’s your actual goal.”\n\nIn the meantime, Miller’s three kids are growing up in Memphis, which is another part of this equation, and — in a very real way — the answer to that question Miller is so frequently asked.\n\nWhy Memphis?\n\n“I wanted my kids to be here,” he said. “I wanted them to grow up here, I want them to see this. The people aren’t afraid of working hard.\n\n“People in Memphis love basketball, obviously. That’s part of it, too. But it’s more than that. Aside from the size, it’s not that much different than South Dakota, where I grew up.\n\n“I’m big on working. That’s why I wanted my family to be here. In Memphis, you work for what you get.”"
