        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — Hampered by a bad back, Mike Miller considered retiring in summer 2012. Fast-forward 3½ years, and that’s a subject far from his mind.\n\n“If my body feels the way it is right now, I want to play a couple of more years for sure,” the Nuggets forward said before Tuesday night’s game against Minnesota at the Target Center.\n\nMiller, 35, was noticeably hobbled for the Miami Heat when it won the 2012 NBA title, even though he scored 23 points in the decisive Game 5 win over Oklahoma City. He said he was “really close” to retiring and would have had he needed back surgery.\n\nInstead, doctors came up with a nonsurgical procedure that Miller calls a miracle.’ He’s now in his 16th NBA season.\n\n“I never would have believed (in 2012) that I’d still be playing now,” said Miller, on a one-year, $1.5 million contract.\n\nMiller is averaging 2.0 points and 8.5 minutes. However, he has averaged more than 12 minutes in seven December games.\n\n“I was not planning on playing Mike Miller as much I’ve played him,” said Nuggets coach Michael Malone. “But we need shooting; we need ball movers.”\n\nBarton gaining notice. The Nuggets have never had a player win the sixth-man award. Could Will Barton be the first?\n\n“It crosses my mind,” the guard said before the game against Minnesota. “You can’t help but think about it.”\n\nStill, Barton said his ultimate goal this season is for the Nuggets to make the playoffs.\n\nBarton’s chances might be hampered by Denver’s losing record, but his recent strong play is gaining him notice. In his past six games, he has averaged 18.5 points to raise his average to 14.6.\n\n“He’s one of your better off-the-bench players in the NBA,” Malone said.\n\nMudiay might return to lineup Friday. Darrell Arthur returned to action, and Emmanuel Mudiay might not be far behind.\n\nArthur, a Nuggets forward, was back to face Minnesota at the Target Center after missing two games with right knee soreness. Mudiay, a rookie point guard, sat out his second consecutive game with a sprained right ankle, but Malone hopes he will return Friday at Utah.\n\nMudiay, hurt last Friday against the Timberwolves, made the trip to Minnesota. He spent much of Tuesday getting treatment."
