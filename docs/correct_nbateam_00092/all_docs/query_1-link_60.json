        "text": "Brian Schmitz proposed this morning on Magic Basketblog that the Orlando Magic should make a trade for Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups. Schmitz offers Vince Carter, Jameer Nelson, and Marcin Gortat as the main trade fodder for Denver’s duo and basically puts the whole team on the trading bloc save for Dwight Howard. To say the least, this proposal has stirred the blogosphere just a little. So, would the trade work? If you have read the title of this piece then you have an under standing of the position in which it takes. Otis Smith, the general manager of the Magic, would be the one pulling the trigger on the trade proposal if it were to come to life. However, it is known that the Magic did indeed make an offer for Anthony this summer which Denver rejected. Would this time be any different and would Smith go through with any such proposal?\n\nOtis Smith would never make this deal. Ever. He has proven over the years that he will flat-out refuse to give up any of the talent on his squad when he is looking to acquire new players. Smith believes that the team he has assembled is the one that can win. Certainly, however, the prospect of getting something in return has to be intriguing. It is doubtful that he will pursue a trade however because he keeps his players in Orlando. He would not let Marcin Gortat go to the Mavericks and instead matched Dallas’ offer only to see Gortat play 10-15 minutes a game. As a consolation, the Magic signed Brandon Bass that summer who was essentially an olive branch extended by the Mavericks so that Orlando would not match the offer sheet on Gortat. (If you believe that the Mavericks willing let Bass go in free agency then you should check the numbers that Bass produced in Dallas. They would have resigned him.) Smith matched the offer sheet that J.J. Redick signed with the Bulls this summer. He has a vice grip on the players on the Magic and has garnered a reputation as a conniving GM who is in it for himself alone.\n\nOn the side of Denver, why would they ever accept Vince Carter? He is fast becoming a candidate to end his career playing overseas like Iverson. If the Nuggets were to go into rebuilding mode, and they will if Anthony departs, Carter would not be in any equation because he is 34. Rebuilding around a 34-year-old player is never done. His numbers are decent so far this season but the Nuggets want to rebuild, not become the Detroit Pistons. Carter is the last player that the Nuggets will agree to sign if they are giving up both Anthony and Billups.\n\nGortat has an absolutely wonderful contract to throw into any deal for Denver’s two stars. That is exactly why Smith will not do it. If he did not let him walk two years ago then why would he let him go now? Stan Van Gundy needs him to “focus on defending, rebounding, and running the floor,” all of which do not adequately display his talents. Sure, this time the Magic would be getting some nice pieces in return but Smith would still never sign off on losing Gortat. Orlando does not have a viable backup center if Gortat leaves. Do you think that Denver is going to package in Nene as well? Doubtful. What is even more doubtful is that they would sign waiting-game contestant Erick Dampier to fill the void.\n\nWhat Schmitz is proposing would also relegate Jameer Nelson to being a backup point guard, if he were not part of the hypothetical trade. Paying $6 million plus per year to a backup is not a wise investment. However, dealing Nelson is not a viable option either. Denver is well equipped for the future with Ty Lawson waiting in the wings to take over when Billups’ time with the Nuggets ends. Arron Afflalo can even fill time at the point and if Denver was to rebuild it would be around this backcourt tandem.\n\nSchmitz also states that Orlando should jump at this trade because the Miami Heat are rumored to have an interest in trading for Billups. The Heat will not pursue Billups. I suppose the posh thing to do in Orlando these days is worry about South Beach but don’t think for a second that they can get Billups. To do so, according to Ira Winderman, they would have to either trade Chris Bosh straight up or a package of Mike Miller and Udonis Haslem. Yeah, that is a likely scenario (sarcasm). If the Heat make any moves it will be to acquire a frontcourt player not lose one.\n\nFurther, the Magic are well beyond the salary cap this year, as they have been for a while, spending $94,70,2018 on player salaries. That number is well above the luxury tax level of $70,307,000 this season. Adding Billups and then Anthony, who would subsequently want to sign an extension, would likely put the Magic well above the Los Angeles Lakers who currently have the highest payroll. This is not an ideal situation for any general manager.\n\nThis hypothetical trade, for many reasons, becomes nothing more than a dream. Why blowup a team that is 7-3 anyway? It is far to early in the season for a team to hit the panic button. Right now, the Magic lead their division and have seen their top opponent, Miami, falter out of the starting gates. Yes, adding Anthony would benefit the team, but at what cost? Gutting the roster is not the solution to the Magic’s early season imagined plight. Neither team would sit at a table and objectively listen to the other if these were real circumstances. Denver will not cede Anthony and Billups for aging, injury-prone players and Otis Smith unwillingness part with the pieces he has done everything to hold onto. This hypothetical trade deal is nothing more than a dud.\n\nA not so long time ago, in an NBA galaxy close to home…\n\nFREE AGENCY\n\nSince the coup d’état and emergence of the Miami Thrice there have been a remarkable amount of moves, signings, and trades by teams. So many moves have occurred in fact that it is almost dizzying. Sure, the major names that have filled the 2010 Free Agency marquee banner for two years were quickly off the table but there are certainly a number of key players that are out there that will make a great addition to any franchise looking to improve. We, hear at the Beef have taken it upon ourselves to help keep you as up to date as possible with free agency. It is likely that within hours of this posting many more signings and trades will have occurred (the number of times this piece had to be updated while being written over a two day span is proof positive of that), making this piece slightly dated but, as always, keep apprised of all the movers and shakers in free agency with up to the minute information, or at least as soon as we are able to report it, by following the Kobe Beef on Twitter.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nWhen Miami attempted to buy itself a soul by acquiring both LeBron James and Chris Bosh they had just two players under contract with the team for the coming season. Those players were Mario Chalmers and Michael Beasley. Since that time, the Heat have dealt Beasley, in what equates to a salary dump, to the Minnesota Timberwolves for two second round draft picks in 2011 and 2014. Ouch, he was the second overall pick in 2008. Relieving themselves of Beasley’s services allowed the Heat to free up enough to award the Miami Thrice (will this catch on?) close to maximum contracts. Both James and Bosh will receive six-year, $110 million contracts while Wade receives $107.5 million over the same period of time. Each player also has an early termination option after the 2013-14 season.\n\nSo the Heat, at that point, had just four players under contract for the coming season. That is certainly grounds for championship speculation. Since then the organization has been in overdrive recruiting and signing free agents to bolster their roster. Mike Miller looked like a lock to join the Heat after meeting with Pat Riley and other organization officials on July 1, but now the Miami Herald is reporting that Miller may be backing out of the deal. Miami has a qualifying offer out on Joel Anthony which would pull the reins even tighter on the money that they could offer Miller. Nothing about Miller’s situation with the Heat is certain yet. At least that was the latest news as of early Wednesday afternoon. As of today, Mike Miller is in Miami and has signed a five-year contract with the Heat.\n\nUdonis Haslem, after being pursued by the Dallas Mavericks and Denver Nuggets (who have had a knack to engage in bidding wars this summer), has decided to resign with the Heat. Haslem’s deal is worth just over $20 million over four years. The Heat are also close to a minimum level deal with Juwan Howard.\n\nIn yet another blow to the city and fans of Cleveland, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, for the second time this calendar year, is leaving. This time he is leaving on his own accord and not part of a multiplayer and multi-team deal to help entice a certain player to stay put. He is following James to Miami. Ilgauskas has played his entire career in Cleveland, he was traded to the Wizards but he never played a single game for them, let alone put on a Wizards’ jersey. The deal with the Heat is expected to be for two years with a player option for the second year. How many knives will Cleveland have to remove from their back when free agency is over?\n\nGordon Gekko…err, Pat Riley, has done an excellent job of using the Bud Foxes at his disposal as incentive for players to join the Heat. Ilgauskas’ close relationship with James was the deciding factor in his move to South Beach. Yet, the team still lacks a point guard. Miami lost out on its attempt to lure Derek Fisher away from the Lakers and the aura of Phil Jackson and Kobe Bryant. Certainly, the combo of Jackson and Bryant is Sir Lawrence Wildman to Riley’s Gekko.\n\nNew York Knicks\n\nNew Yorkers and Knickerbockers alike should not feel all too bad about missing out on the Miami Thrice (I’m going to make this stick). They successfully procured Amar’e Stoudemire. That is a very solid consolation prize. It is better than what the soon to be cross town rivals got. New York should be happy that they convinced any player to join their team since they employed Isiah Thomas to help them recruit free agents. Isiah Thomas! This is the man who gave monster contracts to “superstars” like Eddy Curry (who is going into the final year of his contract and will be paid $11.3 million) and Jared Jeffries. He almost singlehandedly drove the organization into the ground. Well, Knicks owner, James Dolan, helped too. However, the acquisition of Stoudemire was not a bad one but it meant that fan favorite and perennial double-double (this is a statistic that STAT cannot claim on a regular basis), David Lee, would no longer be a part of the Knicks’ future.\n\nLee was dealt to the Golden State Warriors (the AND1 Mix Tape Tour’s only NBA equivalent) via sign-and-trade where mad scientist, Don Nelson, will undoubtedly have an insane number of offensive schemes already planned with him in mind. In return the Knicks received Anthony Randolph, who was the main chip New York wanted in return, Ronny Turiaf, and Kelenna Azubuike. Randolph will make $1.96 million this coming season, Turiaf will make $4 million, and Azubuike, who is going into the final year of his contract, will make $3.3 million. Dorell Wright is also joining the Warriors. He became expendable when the Heat orchestrated a Gekko-esque takeover and cornered the market on top free agents. After that they needed to pay them and Wright would eat up more money that they needed for their new stars. Dwyane Wade is reported to have really like Wright as a teammate but money seems to have trumped friendship. Wright has agreed to a three-year deal worth $11.5 million.\n\nThe Knicks lost Chris Duhon in free agency to the Orlando Magic so for a time they were without a starting point guard. In a Mike D’Antoni coached offense, this is the most important position. New York quickly found a solution to their vacancy in Raymond Felton. They had been after Felton since last season but the Bobcats were in no mood to trade him. Felton was originally in talks with the Knicks to sign a three-year deal with the Knicks but the two parties reached an agreement on a two-year contract worth nearly $15 million.\n\nIn addition to these players the Knicks also signed Timofey Mozgov, a 7’1” center from Russia. He is expected to sign a three-year contract worth $9 million but not all the money will be guaranteed. The Knicks are buying him out of his contract with his former team, Khimki Moscow, and are reportedly paying them $500,000. Some reports have said that he is the best prospect in Europe. We at the Beef have not read that, in fact we know nothing about him. Honestly, we thought all the Russians were in New Jersey.\n\nThe Knicks have also shown interest in resigning Earl Barron, who played the last seven games of the season with New York last season. Yet, nothing has been made official. Even after all these signings the Knicks will still have about $2-3 million in cap space. With the expiring contracts of Curry and Azubuike at the end of the season, the team looks poised and ready for free agency next summer when Carmelo Anthony becomes available if he chooses not to sign an extension with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nWhat the hell is general manager David Kahn doing? Does anybody know? In recent days it has been said that an avocado would do a better job than he would. As of right now (July 14, 2010 at 1:05 pm central standard time) the Timberwolves have just reached an agreement with point guard Luke Ridnour on a four-year $16 million deal. Minnesota now has four point guards; yes that is right, four. They have Jonny Flynn, Ramon Sessions, Ridnour, and Spaniard holdout, Ricky Rubio. If Kahn is trying to entice Rubio to leave the now perpetually drunk Spain, he sure is sending mixed signals. However, many see the signing of Ridnour as a possible prelude to the Wolves trading Sessions. Reports say that Minnesota has been in talks with Charlotte, who just lost Felton to the Knicks, about the possibility of a trade for Sessions. The Bobcats, however, have just extended an offer to free agent guard, Shaun Livingston, which likely means that all Sessions discussions are dead.\n\nThe acquisition of Ridnour comes just days after the Timberwolves traded away their best player, Al Jefferson, to the Utah Jazz. Minnesota, in return, gets two first round draft picks and center Kosta Koufos. Utah swooped in, seemingly at the last minute, to snag Jefferson as the Timberwolves and Dallas Mavericks were in serious trade discussions. The Jazz had the advantage of having a trade exception, acquired when Carlos Boozer left for Chicago, and were willing to give up first round draft picks. Minnesota’s motive for moving Jefferson was based on his style of play, slow and post oriented, which they are trying to move away from. If there is any sense of style coming out of Minnesota it is a frenetic one, spearheaded by Kahn.\n\nMinnesota has finalized its contract with Darko Milicic making him one of the veterans on the team. Veterans, as a term, should be used lightly since Milicic has just seven years of NBA experience. The T-Wolves have also signed draft picks, Wesley Johnson and Lazar Hayward. Center Nikola Pekovic has also agreed to terms with the team. All of these moves, along with the addition of Beasley, have, as David Kahn hopes, bolstered the frontcourt and made the team sleeker and quicker on the court. Yet, it is still hard to discern what Kahn in actually doing other than trying to improve upon last year’s 15-67 record. His roster now has four centers, and a host of wing player. This is also now one of the youngest teams in the league and plays in a division where the four other teams won at least fifty games last season. Hell, Utah is a division rival and they just shipped their best player to them for virtually nothing other than “financial flexibility.” Kahn must be leaving his team’s fan base screaming his name in anger, much like Captain Kirk in Star Trek II, every time he makes any sort of move. Though they have become a player in free agency this summer none of their moves consolidate into a coherent plan, Kahn appears to be a madman, deranged by power, hunting his white whale. His whale, of course, is Ricky Rubio.\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nChicago has benefited from defectors from Utah. Both Carlos Boozer and Kyle Korver have left the confines of the Great Salt Lake and head to the Windy City. No, neither of these players is named James, Bosh, or Wade but they are still major pickups for the Bulls. Korver should help the Bulls in their three-point shooting. As a team the Bulls shot 33 percent from downtown which ranked them 28th in the league. The Bulls are also looking to further strengthen their long-range shooting as they have signed J.J. Redick to a three-year, $20 million offer sheet. Redick is a restricted free agent so his current team, the Orlando Magic can match the Bulls offer and retain him. If history is any indication (matching the Mavericks offer to Marcin Gortat last summer) of their intentions, Orlando will likely match the offer. Yet, the Magic recently agreed to a deal with Quentin Richardson so maybe they are prepared to let Redick go.\n\nKorver’s deal is worth an estimated $15 million over three years. Boozer agreed to a five-year deal worth roughly $75 million that became a sign-and-trade with Utah with the Bulls also receiving a future protected second-round draft pick. The trade exemption that the Jazz used to trade for Al Jefferson was part of the Boozer trade.\n\nNew head coach, Tom Thibodeau, should be very pleased with the work that general manager Gar Forman has done this offseason. Fans of the Bulls should also be quite pleased with the moves the team has made. They may have been slighted in their quest to land one of the Miami Thrice but they have found themselves in a formidable position heading into next season. The same cannot be said for all the teams who were in the rat race for the big three.\n\nNew Jersey Nets\n\nSeriously, the Nets should change the name of their team to the New Jersey Nyets. Despite the fact that they were shot down by every major free agent this summer, they constantly thought themselves to be leading the pack to land each one. The team confidently suggested in the media that they had the upper hand in landing James. Why? What hallucinogen gave them this notion? It must be some pretty potent shit to make them have pipe dreams such as this. Everyone in the world seemed to know that James would not go to the Nets except for the Nets. This ordeal has seriously hurt the reputation of Jay-Z and his supposed ability to land James due to their friendship. Who listens to a minority owner anyway? Greatest rapper alive? Give me a break, Rakim is still alive. Mikhail Prokhorov said he had a hunch that James would not be coming to his team. What tipped him off? Everyone he talked to?\n\nWhat have the Nets done then, other than move to the cesspool that is Newark? Well, they lost their general manager, Rod Thorn and replaced him with Billy King. Yawn. They have reached a contract agreement with Johan Petro worth $10 million over three years. He will back up Brook Lopez. The Nets need to lure a big free agent this summer to make up for their failures thus far and they may have found just the player. Two time NBA champion, former Lakers great, Jordan Farmar has agreed to a three-year, $12 million deal with the struggling franchise. Good job, Jay-Z. I doubted you earlier but you really came through with this one. It should prove to be a spectacular competition for starting point guard when training camp begins. Farmar stated that his desire to leave the Lakers was to be a starting point guard on a team. He has a good chance of doing just that in New Jersey. Oh, wait…Devin Harris still plays in New Jersey? Oh, I see. Is that common knowledge? Did anyone tell Farmar that? Sorry, Jordan, looks like you will simply be a backup on a bad team.\n\nBy far their biggest acquisitions are those of Travis Outlaw and Anthony Morrow. Outlaw agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal. New Jersey signed Morrow to an offer sheet worth $12 million over three years that the Golden State Warriors did not match. The teams eventually worked out a sign-and-trade where the Warriors receive the Nets’ second-round draft pick in 2011.\n\nThese moves, in the wake of not landing James, are…well, they are moves. Morrow and Outlaw have the potential to thrive alongside Harris and Lopez but it will all depend on how Avery Johnson chooses to utilize their talents on the court. As for right now, the Nets look to be at least three wins better than they were last season, maybe. At least in a few years the team will be in Brooklyn where they can overcharge hipsters for tickets and merchandise. Hipsters love ironic failures and chronic underachievers. Financially, the Nets will be winners then.\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nThe Suns have been one of the biggest movers in the Western Conference this summer. They had to be after losing Stoudemire to the Knicks. They recently welcomed back to the league, Josh Childress and his iconic Afro with a five-year contract. Phoenix acquired him via sign-and-trade with the Atlanta Hawks, who still retained the rights to his contract. Atlanta will receive the Suns’ 2012 second-round draft pick.\n\nPhoenix has also traded for scorned Raptor, Hedo Turkoglu for Leandro Barbosa and Dwayne Jones. Turkolgu thrives in offenses where he gets to control the ball so a pairing with Steve Nash seems a bit odd but any situation has to be better for Turkolgu than what he went through in Toronto.\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nDallas’ attempts to land players named Al have been thwarted at every attempt this summer. First they were in position to land Al Jefferson. Then, out of nowhere, the Jazz swooped in and nabbed him so that they could fill the void left by Boozer’s departure. Next the Mavericks set their sights on Al Harrington. Talks were advancing nicely but then the Denver Nuggets struck. They offered Harrington a longer and more valuable contract (five-year, $34 million) than the Mavericks were willing to offer him.\n\nThe Mavericks have made some moves this summer, though they are not earth shaking; they are moves to build on for the future. Dallas’ second priority this summer, after resigning Dirk Nowitzki, was signing Brendan Haywood. They did just that as the team and Haywood agreed on a six-year deal worth $55 million. The way Haywood’s contract is structured he will make $7-8 million a season, and as the Mavericks are prone to do, the last year of his contract is not fully guaranteed.\n\nFor the Mavericks, the elephant in the room was Erick Dampier’s nonguaranteed $13 million contract and their ability to use it in an attempt to lure a max free agent to Dallas to team up with Nowitzki. Dallas missed out on the marquee names but was able to move Dampier’s contract. Dampier, along with Matt Carroll, Eduardo Najera, and cash were sent to the Charlotte Bobcats for Tyson Chandler and Alexis Ajinca. It was not the blockbuster move that Mavs fans were hoping for and many are quite discontent at the moves their team has made this summer after being force-fed rumors and speculation about the possibility of landing a superstar. Honestly, this deal fits the Mavericks plan better than landing the likes of Jefferson who would have either been forced into a sixth man role or center. Neither of which would have been ideal for either party. Chandler gives the Mavericks and versatile shot blocker with the ability to run the floor. Running the floor is something that Chandler was accustomed to during his time with Chris Paul and the New Orleans Hornets and is something that he will get back to on the Mavericks with Jason Kidd and Rodrigue Beaubois. One thing is certain, the alley-oop dunk will return to prominence in Chandler’s offensive repertoire.\n\nThis deal also gives the Mavericks some financial breathing room as they have dumped Carroll’s bloated contract. It also gives the team added size and length in the frontcourt, something the team wanted so they could compete with the Lakers’ bigs. This deal came just in time too. It also acts as a counter to their in-state arch rival San Antonio Spurs’ addition of the great threat, Tiago Splitter. This nobody is making folks quake in their boots from the filthy, disease laden River Walk to the Alamo. Team front offices are whispering amongst themselves about the domination that Splitter could unleash on an unsuspecting league. Hold on, he is a South American seven footer? How many floppers do the Spurs need on their roster? The only threat he poses is to himself. It is a long way to the floor when flopping from seven feet up, concussions could become a problem.\n\nChandler is going into the last year of his contract which has led some to speculate that if a player became available during the season the Mavericks could use Chandler and Caron Butler, who is also entering the last year of his contract, as trade bait. However, the people who are the ones speculating this are the same ones who almost guaranteed Mavericks fans that they would land a superstar player this summer.\n\nUtah Jazz\n\nThe Utah Jazz have acquired Raja Bell and thwarted Kobe Bryant’s attempts to get Bell to sign with the Lakers. Los Angeles had $1.8 million left of their mid-level exception to offer Bell while the Jazz offered him a three-year deal worth close to $10 million. (It is always about the money.) With the signing of Bell the Jazz chose to let Wesley Matthews sign with the Portland Trailblazers as they were unwilling to match the offer sheet that Matthews signed with the Blazers which was worth $32.7 million over five years.\n\nFor much of the nation, the initial reactions to “The Decision” (brought to you by the University of Phoenix, Vitamin Water, McDonalds, Sprite, and Nike with some of the proceeds benefiting the Boys and Girls Club of America) have begun to subside. However, in Cleveland and Miami feelings of anger and dejection and overwhelming elation, respectively, are still in the air. Miami itself is likely just now crashing from the all night coke binge that happened last night. LeBron James is now a member of the Miami Heat via sign-and-trade with the Cavaliers. Chris Bosh joins him, also via sign-and-trade, from the Toronto Raptors. Dwyane Wade, through all the brokered back dealing stays right at “home.” (His real home is Chicago, where his children live). Each player is receiving a six year contract, the maximum allotted, because of the sign-and-trades with their previous organizations and Wade just for staying put. Details of the sign-and-trades have not been fully disclosed as yet but it is safe to say that the Miami Heat will not have any draft picks for the better part of a decade. The Cavaliers alone got two first round and two second round picks through the year 2014.\n\nEach of these All-Stars now has what they have wanted since they played in the Beijing Olympics. They are playing on a team together in the NBA. The NBA, however, is not the national team and the city of Miami certainly does not reflect the nation as a whole. Nations have souls, and Miami is severely lacking in this category. These three players contributed to the gold medal but they did not win it. That distinction goes to a man on the west coast. He won the gold for Team USA; he silenced the crowd and put one finger to his lips. This man has played in seven NBA finals and won five. The trio, triumvirate, Super Friends, Summit Committee, whatever they will come to be called, has two members who have appeared in the finals. One was swept; the other was rewarded with terrible officiating in the most tainted finals the NBA has ever seen. Even despite that, he was the second fiddle on the team. The third member of the trio? He has not been out of the first round.\n\nThis piece is not about Wade or Bosh; it was clear that Bosh was a patsy in this whole ordeal. He made absolutely no choice of his own but was simply persuaded to join one or the other. He lucked out; he plays with both of them now. (In the future, if it is discovered that Bosh orchestrated this entire charade and eventual joining of forces everyone will have egg in their eye. That, however, is highly unlikely). No, this piece is about James and the culture that surrounds him; that which he helped create but was glorified long before he ever left St. Vincent/St. Mary’ s High School. Though the shock of his betrayal is still reverberating, it can with some hindsight be seen as inevitable and unsurprising. The choice of Miami as his target destination is also of little surprise. Though this piece may touch on many cultural dynamics that played into the decision (brought to you by McDonalds) making process it in no way will take the “blame it on society/culture” copout media approach that is rampant in today’s news outlets.\n\nCan you blame him for leaving? Absolutely! You have to. You must. You must vilify this man. (Use of the term “man” is loose here because he is almost six months to the day younger than I am). He has schemed and conspired to be everything that the fans and media thought he was not. Loyalty, thy name is not LeBron. No, it never will be. Can loyalty exist again in the NBA? There is a paradigm shift occurring before our eyes. Sure, Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, and Paul Pierce have played with the same franchise their entire careers but they are all in their thirties. They are the old guard. The new guard? They are in their second and third seasons. Kevin Durant is the godfather of the new guard. What we have seen in the past few days is the actions of the now guard. James is a card carrying member of the now guard. Win now. Boston ushered in the era of the now. Are they to blame for the egotism of the now? No. It has always been there. The now consists of the last group of players who were allowed to make the jump from high school into the NBA, basically the 2003 draft class. These high schoolers never learned loyalty. One can only be loyal to a high school for so long. The friendships forged there are a different story. They can last a lifetime. That is what one gets from high school. College is a different story all together. If you have an alma mater you have a sense of loyalty. Ipso facto: Dwyane Wade stayed in Miami.\n\nJames’s branding machine has been in overdrive since he was in high school and the NBA has allowed that brand to grow. A global empire is something that must be nurtured and cared for. It must also be allowed to develop in an environment conducive to such endeavors. Warren Buffett is the only man alive to have such a successful business operation based in the Midwest. He has cornered the market on Midwestern success. Did Cleveland ever stand a chance? Maybe; but the greatest trick James ever pulled was convincing Cleveland that he was staying home.\n\nOne of James’s Nike commercials eerily predicted the events of this summer. It was one in the series of “LeBron’s” ads that Nike released during the 2006-07 season. It was for the Zoom LeBron 4. Though the location of the commercial seems to have been shot in southern California the general setting is reminiscent of the lifestyle and culture of South Beach.\n\nInterestingly enough is that the music in the commercial is titled “Summer Madness” by Kool and the Gang. A touch of foreshadowing to say the least. With the benefit of hindsight, red flags instantly go up. This landscape and scenery is nothing reminiscent of neither Cleveland nor the Cuyahoga River and its propensity to catch fire. To disregard this music video influence would be in bad form. It has been a constant companion to the culture since the 1980s. Hell, Kanye West was off camera during “The Decision” (brought to you by the University of Phoenix). Other than music videos (his music is only tolerable in video format), the only thing Kanye has brought to the culture is the wide introduction of Ato Matsumoto footwear and odd sunglasses.\n\nThe commercial plays like a music video. Music videos are prone to glorify money and Miami. Have you ever seen one of DJ Khaled’s video? “We’re Taking Over” seems apropos in this situation. Watch it. “Who? We! We tha best!” Those are popular catch phrases of the Miami DJ. These words also ring true to the sentiment of the players, especially James, who united together in Miami. (The improper usage of grammar is also a familiar device to NBA players. Their Twitter accounts are impossibly frustrating to read. David Stern should really think about making two years of college mandatory before the jump to the pros.) Idealization of Miami is something that holds a mysterious mystique with all athletes it seems. Though, no one is rushing to play for the Marlins even though they have won two World Series. Fast cars, beautiful bikini clad women, boats, yachts, the beach, Ocean Drive: all symbols of decadence, luxury and desire. All symbols of the now. The now guard was born in the heart of the 1980s when Scarface and Miami Vice were at their height in popularity. (It can be argued that Scarface is more popular now than it was then). But the movie Wall Street epitomized the mindset of the decade.\n\nGreed, for lack of a better word, is good. Do you not think that the now guard regards this truth to be self evident? They certainly do. Each member of the trio has a six year max contract with the Heat. (Actually it has yet to be determined it they will receive max money but it is certain that they will get very close to it. The argument that they are all taking less money for a chance at winning becomes simply preposterous. Kids in their mid-twenties take less money? Never. Trust me, we want it all). Oddly enough, the man who epitomized the decadence of the 1980s as a coach is the one who swung the deal to land James in Miami. His brash bravado and his ability to seal the deal and win seem to have no end. He is Gordon Gekko. His name is Pat Riley. Reports of Riley’s meeting with James have not been fully disclosed and probably never will be in their entirety. What is known; however, is that Riley simply showed James his rings. All of them. Puppet LeBron James is always insulted by puppet Kobe trying to find his missing rings but real life James was probably chomping at the bit over Riley’s hardware. Pat Riley has never been one for subtlety. He wears Armani on the sidelines. James was easily as awestruck as Bud Fox. Easy work for Riley. Eric Spoelstra is, for now, the coach of the Heat. Since the acquisition of James and Bosh rumor and speculation has exploded as to whether Riley will return to the bench. You bet your life he will coach this team. His ego was made for it.\n\nHow will the Heat fare this season? Only time can honestly answer that question. To question the inherent skill that James and the rest of his new trio possess is not something to do seriously. They are all blessed with remarkable talent. Their salaries, however, will command the majority of the Heat’s payroll therefore making it difficult for other players of quality to join them at a fair compensation. Three All-Stars surrounded by minimum level players is not too appealing. Sure the marquee names are sexy but once you get past them you have Mike Miller and Mario Chalmers. Both are generally known to casual observers of the sport but do not draw much attention beyond that. What about after them? As of yet there is nothing. Five players do not make a team. At this rate the Heat will be forced to settle for players like Keith McLeod (who is now in the D-League) or Brian Cardinal to fill the vacancies in their starting rotation. Juwan Howard, it has been rumored, will land on the Heat. Hopefully each player knows what they have created and is willing to live with it. If not, they will not find their creation to their liking.\n\nSo who created James? The obvious answer would be his mother and father. Yet, it goes beyond that. In high school he would sell tee shirts depicting his own image before and after games. The media ate it up. He has been financially savvy since he realized what he was becoming; or rather what people were making him into. It is about business, it is about money, it is about empire. Michael Jordan is his idol. However, his idolatry of Jordan stops at his business endeavors and play. James changed his number to six. Not really to honor Jordan, though that is partially a reason, but more to brand himself, his image, his number. (Odd choice though. Yes, it is his number from the Olympics but James can never fully distance himself from Jordan. The number six is the number of championships that Jordan won).\n\nAfter “The Decision” (brought to you by Nike) the Cavaliers’ owner, Dan Gilbert, released a scathing letter to the fans of the organization and to the world in general. Every word (capitalized or not) dripped with anger and was tinged with rage. He was certainly not a happy man. His franchise player, a child native to Ohio, had left. Worst of all the Ohio prodigy had done so via the outlet that has come to dictate the lives of most every American: cable television. It would have been one thing to simply make a decision (brought to you by Sprite) and move on from there but to do it in front of an audience of millions in an overhyped extravaganza is something completely different. James sat there, dressed in purple (apparently James is fond of semiotics) with Jim Gray to reveal to the world the dagger he had lodged in Cleveland’s back. Et tu LeBron? Why would he make a decision through any other medium but television? He certainly had to show up the global 3D IMAX movie event that Kevin Durant released earlier that day to coincide with his five year extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder. (Every time I write about the Thunder I cannot help but feel sad for the city of Seattle). Go big or go h…wait, that expression really does not apply here. Gilbert is partially to blame for James’ ego. He helped coddle and mold James’ brain into thinking that he deserved everything and that everyone would bow to his wishes. Now, like Dr. Frankenstein, his monster has broken loose into an ill prepared world that is both terrified and captivated by the creature’s every movement (and every car).\n\nGilbert’s scornful words are appropriate. They are merely the emotions of a parent publicly embarrassed and disowned by their successful child. The hurt is real and the anger will probably never subside. Cleveland and the state of Ohio will feel the same for eternity: dejected. Mo Williams, in his rambling tweets may sum up the victimization that the entire region feels. Eventually, there may be some who forgive but the vast majority never will. Why should they? Many will never forgive Kobe Bryant for his actions in what was a much publicized marital issue. Others will never forgive Tiger Woods for the same thing. However, what James did went beyond what some see as the “sanctity” of marriage. (If marriage was truly sacred, half of them would not end in divorce). James hurt millions. Hopes were crushed. Hope. Hope was a word that President Obama used in his campaign for office. With a cunning sense of stagecraft, last night’s celebration in Miami channeled the President. In large bold letters read the words YES. WE. DID. In Cleveland and elsewhere the audacity of hate continues to grow. Darkness has crept over the land. How can they have hope when the one bright light in their lives decided (brought to you by Sprite) to extinguish itself, only to be re-lit elsewhere? Nonetheless they must move forward, James has.\n\nThis is America, is it not? Should we not have prepared for such a departure based on such shallow reasons? We have idealized and idolized money and affluence for generations. There is no getting around that fact. The state of Texas cannot rewrite their history books to selectively misinterpret that information. It has been a notion which we have attached ourselves to like a Remora. James is simply a product of us. A sellout. Everywhere the culture glorifies the sellout. Do you watch “reality” television? You and the people you watch are sellouts. You have bought into a product. James, himself, wants to become a product. He wants to transcend what it is to be merely human. He wants to get to heaven before he has to die. As disgusting and foul as James’ departure may seem to everyone but the soulless droves in Miami, he is simply doing what Americans have practiced for the entirety of his life. Loyalty is something that may be preached but its stock has gone the way of the sub-prime mortgage. James has captured the American dream. He came from nothing, worse than obscurity and has captured a place in history for himself. People die every day trying to get into this country for one percent of the opportunity that we, as a nation, have afforded to James. Our country is the definition of hubris yet when a person of such a standing takes the moneyed and lavish path, it is we who are first and loudest to cry foul. We are also the definition of hypocrisy. James got exactly what he wanted. Karma will decide if he gets even more."
