        "text": "CINCINNATI — Former Cincinnati basketball star James \"Flight\" White is back in the NBA as a player development assistant with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nWhite had previously been a part of the team's G-League affiliate, the Iowa Wolves.\n\n“We are excited to support Jeff and James in their new roles as they transition from the Iowa Wolves to our coaching staff in Minnesota,” said Timberwolves Head Coach Chris Finch. “As we have since my arrival to the Twin Cities, we have put an emphasis on staff development and rewarding the hard work and dedication those on our staff make to the organization.”\n\nWhite was a strong player at UC during the early 2000s. He scored 1,088 points in his three years (2003-06) with the Bearcats and was a second-round pick of the Portland Trail Blazers. He played three seasons in the NBA.\n\nCatch Bearcats athletics action on fuboTV!
