        "text": "Mike Miller has signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers, according to Chris Broussard. The deal is worth $5.5 million for two years and includes a player option for the second season, per Ken Berger.\n\nLeBron James had reportedly reached out to Mike Miller in recent days after signing with the Cavaliers to bring the familiar sharpshooter to Cleveland. Other teams were also interested in Miller, including the Denver Nuggets and Oklahoma City Thunder, but the chance to play with James was apparently enough to get a deal completed.\n\nMiller is coming off a strong year from outside the arc in 2013, making 46% of his shots from three-point range with the Memphis Grizzlies. That's the second-highest percentage of Miller's 15-year career. Miller averaged 7.1 points per game for the Grizzlies last season."
