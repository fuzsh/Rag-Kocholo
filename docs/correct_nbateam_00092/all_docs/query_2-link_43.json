        "text": "Patrick Beverley actually began his professional playing career in Europe. It’s hard to remember that because he has become such an NBA mainstay. When one is asked to think of pests in the league, he is one of the first names that is brought up. Beverley is the prototypical player who is loved when he’s on your team and hated when he’s not.\n\nThe 36-year-old has played each of the last 12 seasons in the NBA. He currently remains an unrestricted free agent. There may be reason for that as Beverley may be mulling an overseas basketball offer from another league.\n\n12-Year Veteran To Leave NBA For Europe?\n\nPatrick Beverley Heading To Europe For The 2024-25 Season?\n\nThe six-foot-two Beverley is one of the many NBA players who have gotten involved in the podcasting game. His Pat Bev Pod has become one of the more popular ones. A tweet on his podcast’s X page was posted to let people know that he is mulling over two offers.\n\nIt is unclear what a HISTORIC contract in Europe actually means. The veteran’s minimum for next season is around $3.3 million. One would think a historic European contract would pay Beverley north of that amount, although the number of years on the deal is not known. Sportando has reported that Hapoel Tel Aviv, an Israeli basketball team, is looking to bring Beverley into the fold.\n\nIf he joins Hapoel Tel Aviv, Beverley wouldn’t be the first former NBA player to sign with them this offseason. A few days ago, it was announced that former Phoenix Suns forward Ish Wainwright would be joining the team for the upcoming season. Hapoel Tel Aviv’s most high-profile NBA signing was Nate Robinson, the three-time Slam Dunk champion who signed with them in 2016.\n\nCarved Out Lenghty Career Being A Pest On The Defensive End\n\nPlaying collegiately at Arkansas, Beverley was deemed ineligible for his junior season in 2008-09. He would instead go on to play in the Ukrainian Basketball League. Beverley was taken in the second round (42nd overall) in the 2009 NBA Draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. He was traded to the Miami Heat the following day, but he ended up being cut before the season. Beverley would play the next three seasons in Greece and Russia.\n\nPrior to the 2012-13 season, Beverley got a chance in the NBA as he was signed by the Houston Rockets. He played five seasons for the Rockets and became a full-time starter in his second season. In the following four seasons, Beverley played for the Los Angeles Clippers. He remained a starter during much of his tenure there.\n\nAfter playing for just two teams in his first nine seasons, he has played for five in his last three. Beverley played for the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2021-22. He began the 2022-23 season with the Lakers but was involved in a four-team trade sending him to the Orlando Magic. Beverley never played for Orlando who released him, and he joined the Chicago Bulls for the rest of the season. In 2023-24, he signed with the Philadelphia 76ers who later traded him to the Milwaukee Bucks. Last season in 73 games for the two teams, Beverley averaged 6.2 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 2.9 assists."
