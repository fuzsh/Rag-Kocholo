I always wanted to be a basketball player. I finally got that opportunity.\n\nI think I was born to play basketball. Both my brothers are 6-2. I’m 6-8, 6-9. God blessed me with that.\n\nI’m very grumpy after a loss. In the NBA, when you have a lot of losses, it takes a toll on you.\n\nGrowing up, my favorite cartoons probably were Batman and Spider-Man. I liked action heroes.\n\nIf I could have any superhero superpower, it’d be flying. It’d make life a heck of a lot easier for me.\n\nWhen I was in high school (in Mitchell, S.D.), I also played football and baseball. I played quarterback, and I was a pitcher. I quit playing football because my legs started getting too long. I began playing AAU basketball.\n\nMy parents have had the biggest influence in my life. My dad was the principal in a middle school. My mom was a third-grade teacher. Every day my dad would come home from school, and he’d take me and my two older brothers to the gym, and my sister, who was younger, would tag along, too.\n\nMy dad was the principal. He knew everything I did. I stayed out of trouble. One time, though, I shot a BB gun through my front window. I was 8 or 9 years old. My dad skipped the lecture. He went straight to the spanking.\n\nThe best days of my life were the births of my two boys. Mason turns 6 next week. And Mavrick is 4. Those were amazing days. Professionally, the best day probably was draft day.\n\nI’m just like any other Midwesterner. I like when people come up to me. I’ll talk about anything. I like to get involved in the community and with kids.\n\nMy teammates would be surprised if they knew I played high school basketball in the Corn Palace (in Mitchell, S.D.). If they saw it, they’d be surprised. You can’t really explain it.\n\nI grew up about 15 minutes away from (Vikings linebacker) Chad Greenway. As he got more and more successful at Iowa, you see it’s a South Dakota kid, and you try to reach out. We’re friends.\n\nWhat makes me laugh? Funny movies. I love Will Ferrell movies. I like “Old School” and “Wedding Crashers.” I like Vince Vaughn, too.\n\nFavorite actor? I like Denzel Washington. He puts a different spin to every movie.\n\nMy favorite actress? Angelina Jolie. She looks good. (Laughs.)\n\nLosing is a pet peeve of mine.\n\nWhat’s the toughest thing about playing in the NBA? You’re away from your family all the time.\n\nMy proudest moment as an athlete came my sophomore year in college (at Florida) when we went to the Final Four. That opportunity to advance your team probably was most memorable. (The Gators lost to Michigan State in the 2000 NCAA championship game.)\n\nBeing known as a great player? It’s more important to be part of a great team. It’d be fun to be part of a great team. They seem to remember you more when you’re part of a winner.\n\nMy most prized possession? Other than my family? My dogs. I have three German shepherds.\n\n“King of Queens” and “Seinfeld” are two of my favorite TV shows. Of the new stuff, I like “Entourage” and “Dexter.”\n\nI’d want my friends to describe me as funny and easy going.\n\nI’d want my last meal to be some kind of chicken and shrimp pasta. I’d wash it down with Diet Mountain Dew.\n\nHow’d I know my wife was the one? She can stand being around me. She’s the one that didn’t leave. (Laughs.) She’s an athlete, too. (His wife, Jen, played volleyball.) It’s easier when you’re an athlete to be in a relationship with an athlete. They understand what you’re going through.\n\nIf I had a time machine, I’d go back to the 1980s and the basketball playoffs. I’d want to go back to when Michael and Larry and Magic played. I’d love to be playing with one of those teams — the Celtics, the Bulls or the Lakers.\n\nThe best book I ever read was “Drive” by Larry Bird.\n\nThe first thing I bought after I signed my first NBA contract was a house in Orlando. (The Orlando Magic made Miller the fifth overall pick of the 2000 NBA draft.)\n\nI have country and rap in my iPod. I try to be versatile. I like Jay-Z.\n\nNo, I don’t sing. I’m horrendous. What would Simon Cowell say about my voice? Take everything he’s ever said on “American Idol” and times it by 10, and that’s what he’d say about me.\n\nWhen I first got in the league, I was told there would be up and downs, high and lows, and that you have to stay even and take care of your game, and your game will take care of you. That’s the best advice I’ve gotten.\n\nMcCain or Obama? McCain. I’m more Republican. I grew up Republican.\n\nIf I could trade places for a day with anyone, it’d be Tiger Woods. I’d love to play 18 holes and shoot under par every time. That’d be awesome.\n\nI want my epitaph to say, “Here lies Mike Miller, who was a great father, a great family man, a great person.”\n\nOriginally Published: October 19, 2008 at 11:01 p.m."
