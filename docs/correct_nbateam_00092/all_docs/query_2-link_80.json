        "text": "Chicago Bulls’ rookie Matas Buzelis generates excitement with his versatility and high basketball IQ. At 6-foot-10, he combines size, skill, and athleticism, making him a valuable addition to the Bulls’ roster.\n\nBuzelis comes from a rich basketball heritage. His grandfather, Arvydas Jankauskas, was a former player and coach, and his other grandfather, Petras Buzelis, captained Zalgiris Kaunas, winning six Lithuanian League titles. His grandmother, Elena Buzeliene, is one of Lithuania’s greatest handball players, winning two European Champions Cups. His mother, Kristina Jankauskaite, stood out in Lithuanian youth basketball, while his father, Aidas Buzelis, played in the Lithuanian Basketball League and worked as a massage therapist for the National Team.\n\nIn an interview with HoopsHype, on behalf of Call of Duty Black Ops 6, Buzelis discussed his NBA journey, the pre-draft process, his basketball idols, and his goals with the Chicago Bulls.\n\n(During the NBA Summer League in Vegas, Buzelis, rookies and vets participated in the Call of Duty Two-Minute Drill at the War Room suite. After two days, Bronny James won the $10,000 prize).\n\nBeing in Vegas, how does it feel to be just amongst the NBA community and fully starting your career?\n\nMatas Buzelis: It’s awesome. Just being around NBA guys, that’s what I always wanted to be around when I was younger. So now being in the NBA, I’m not going to let down my opportunity to succeed.\n\nAfter your first game, you said you weren't satisfied. What do you think you could have done better?\n\nMB: I mean, I hit more shots, but that’s just like the least thing I’m worried about. Like defensively being in the right positions. I’d say also just being a better teammate when I’m on the bench. And I’d say finding players better with assists.\n\nWhat do you mean by being a better teammate?\n\nMB: Well, you know, like cheer for the other guys that are playing. I think I did a decent job, but I could be better. And just standing up for my teammates when they come out of the game. I was really tired, and when you’re tired, your brain kind of shuts down a little bit. And sometimes I didn’t stand up and high-five my teammates, but that’s just little things in the game.\n\nWhat do you think makes you the best player in your draft class?\n\nMB: I think that I can do everything. Rebound, block shots, score the ball. I can pass the ball. I feel like I can do everything on the court, honestly.\n\nDo you think you're going to win Rookie of the Year?\n\nMB: Yeah, I think so.\n\nDo you think you're the best player in this draft?\n\nMB: Yeah.\n\nBetter than Zaccharie Risacher and Alex Sarr?\n\nMB: Yeah.\n\nWhat makes you so confident in your ability and just to carry that confidence, even though you're kind of like a low-mannered, stoic guy?\n\nMB: Well, my dad always told me to be humble, but I feel like I work harder than anybody in this draft class, and that’s where the confidence comes from. I’m not one of those guys that just talk for no reason. I really work hard on my game, so that’s why I’m confident in my abilities.\n\nHow did it feel watching your name go until you went to Chicago? Was that kind of like making you mad or something, give you a chip on your shoulder?\n\nMB: No, man. It was zero-zero. Wherever you get picked, one through 60, whatever, 58, it doesn’t matter. Everyone’s in the NBA, and you’re going to have to compete against them. You’re going to have to see them regardless of where you go. It’s just a pay difference.\n\nSome would say you may be in a better situation than if you had gone earlier.\n\nMB: That doesn’t matter to me. I’ll play basketball for free.\n\nYou said the other day that the G League Ignite Team was a bad investment. Why was it a bad investment if you were an owner?\n\nMB: It’s tough to drag people out of Vegas to go see teenage guys play. That’s nothing to do with Ignite. Ignite did an amazing job, and I would do it 10 times over again. That was the best situation that I could have put myself in. And it’s just tough to get people to watch teenage kids play in Vegas.\n\nDo you think that sets you up better than college players?\n\nMB: Yeah, definitely. Some players in college won’t even touch the G League court, you know, unfortunately. And I played against players who were almost all-stars. Kenneth Faried, Lance Stephenson, all those guys. And I got the NBA experience.\n\nWho's your GOAT?\n\nMB: My GOAT? Kobe.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nMB: The way he approached the game, how he plays, of course, and that he wants to win everything, not just basketball.\n\nIf you could make your dream starting five with current NBA players?\n\nMB: At the one, I’m going to go Stephen Curry. Two, I’m going to just put Anthony Edwards. Three, let’s go with, man, at the three, I’m going to go with…\n\nYou can choose yourself.\n\nMB: Nah, I’m not at that level yet. But at the three, there’s so many options. This is tough. I’m going to go with, let me go with Jalen Brunson at my three. Nah, let me go with Jalen Brunson at my two. Let me go with, let me go with, at three Anthony Edwards, and then at four, let me go Kevin Durant. At five, Nikola Jokic.\n\nIf you could poster anyone as your first poster in the NBA, who would it be?\n\nMB: Probably Bron, because it’s tough to dunk on Bron, so if you do it, you’re solidified.\n\nWhat are you doing here with Call of Duty?\n\nMB: Well, luckily I got invited to go and see a preview of Black Ops 6, and that’s why I’m here.\n\nHow does it feel to be a part of this, you know, a game that you grew up with like as a co-op game?\n\nMB: It means a lot because it really started off with me and my brother playing when we were younger, probably when we were 13, 14. And now getting to be a part of the Black Ops family, Call of Duty family, means a lot. And I’m excited for this game to come out.\n\nBasketball, Bulls, Interview, NBA, Basketball, Bulls, Chicago Bulls, Matas Buzelis, NBA"
