        "text": "Nico Harrison finally felt a sense of relief when the Mavericks punched their ticket to the NBA Finals by defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference finals. Soon after the trophy presentation, that relief evolved into excitement.\n\n“Excitement for the players. Excitement for [Jason Kidd]. I really got excited,” Harrison said. “Less about me and more about the team. I would say it was more of a combination. It was more relief than anything.”\n\nThe Mavericks ascended atop the West by defeating the LA Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder and Timberwolves before they were outmatched by the Boston Celtics in the Finals. Despite coming up three wins short of a championship, Harrison is optimistic that the Mavericks can contend for years to come. He’s led a busy offseason that resulted in the acquisition of longtime sharpshooter Klay Thompson to the mix, along with new supplementary pieces in Naji Marshall and Quentin Grimes.\n\nHarrison sat down with The Dallas Morning News to discuss the team’s lengthy playoff run, offseason additions and expectations for next season.\n\nEditor’s note: Harrison’s answers have been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nQ: You were able to acquire Klay Thompson in a historic sign-and-trade that involved six teams. Dallas had a reputation of not being able to land big free agents. We talked to [Mavericks assistant general manager Michael] Finley. He attributed it to winning, but why do you think you were able to get one of the most notable names in free agency this year?\n\nHARRISON: “I think winning, but before you get to the winning is the culture that we’re creating. I think when you create the right culture and people thrive in it, then I think people in the league take notice. They want to be a part of it.”\n\nRelated:Mavericks’ move for Klay Thompson officially part of first six-team trade in NBA history\n\nQ: This might be a question for Jason Kidd, but with Thompson playing the majority of his career [at shooting guard], how do you think he’ll work alongside Luka and Kyrie?\n\nHARRISON: “In terms of a basketball player, he’s one who’s relentless and has a crazy work ethic. He’s one of the best shooters the game has. I’m excited. Excited to have my team. And he’s a winner, too. I think we now have one of the best shooters in the NBA, maybe the best. And you add that to Luka and Kyrie, it’s only going to open up the floor. I think he opens up the floor for them and they open up the floor for him. I really think it’s a really good combination.”\n\nQ: Could we see moments when Luka shifts to the small forward position?\n\n“That’s a J-Kidd question, but it depends on what side of the ball you’re talking about. Offense or defense? Offensively, it makes so much sense. Defensively, Luka is a point guard, but he’s not guarding point guards. He’s guarding the [small forward] or the [power forward]. I think it will all depend on matchups. I don’t think that matters. In terms of starting, then that would be J-Kidd thing, but I don’t worry about that. I think all that stuff takes care of itself. And I’m a big fan of minutes versus starting. Yeah, guys have to get their minutes, but I let [Kidd] worry about that.”\n\nQ: In terms of your other additions in Naji Marshall and Quentin Grimes. What are they bringing to this team?\n\nHARRISON: “Naji’s a really good basketball player ... He’ll be a really physical defender, which we’ve got good defense, but not physical. And he’s physical [player], but he’s a good basketball player. He can shoot. He can really handle the ball. He’ll be able to drive the close out and he can make plays. So I think his skill level is kind of better than people know. And then Quentin, defensively, he’s elite and he can handle the ball and can shoot.”\n\nQ: You said re-signing Derrick Jones Jr. was priority 1A and 1B for this offseason. Why didn’t that happen and how much did his change of representation have to do with that?\n\nHARRISON: “Honestly, it’s a better question for him to answer. I mean, I don’t know. I guess he liked LA better than Dallas.”\n\nRelated:Ex-Mavericks F Derrick Jones Jr. agrees to three-year deal with Clippers, reports say\n\nQ: Were you surprised at his decision?\n\nHARRISON: “Yeah. But honestly, we have Naji and I’m excited about Naji. I did say [Jones] was 1A and 1B, and that’s how we approached it. That’s how we approached him for the whole year, in terms of how we approached him with respect and the love that we showed him and also the play that he had with our guys. He deserved it too, but he made his own choice. And we have Naji. We’re excited about Naji.”\n\nQ: For a team that just made it to the Finals, most teams would probably keep their core pieces intact. It’s still the case, but this team looks significantly different than it did around this time last month. Why was it important for you to be aggressive and make those additions?\n\nHARRISON: “Well, one, I feel like our core is intact. I feel like the pieces we added are additive. They’re not not pieces that take away from each tool. It’s not like we added another ball-dominant scorer. We added complementary pieces that are really good. So I think you got to get better if you want to get back to where you were. So if you just sit there, idling ... the west is tough. Everybody in the west is getting better. You got to figure out how you can do it without disrupting the core makeup of the team because you don’t want to start training camp in ground zero. Now you bring in a few fresh faces, people that are additive they can fit in to what we’re already doing.”\n\nQ: With Luka playing for Slovenia in the FIBA Olympic Qualifying tournament, are you relieved that he’s going to be able to get some rest towards the end of the summer?\n\nHARRISON: “I mean, not relieved. If he would’ve made it, we obviously would’ve been fine with it. It’s like silver linings to everything, right? Nothing that’s out of our control. But there’s silver linings in it. I don’t think relieved is thing, it’s more like, ‘OK, well he didn’t make it, but now he can rest.’ That’s the silver lining.”\n\nQ: He’s coming off a historical season. How does he build upon that?\n\nHARRISON: “I think you saw his leadership grow. I think he continued that. Him playing until June for the first time, I think he knows what he needs to do to get ready to play that deep into the playoffs. So I think he’s built on that. I don’t think it’s a stat. It’s the little things. He sees what’s going to happen before it happens. He manipulates what happens. I don’t know how much more he could do that. I mean, he does that probably the best in the league.”\n\nRelated:Mavericks’ Nico Harrison says summer recovery could lead to best version of Luka Doncic\n\nQ: Is there a part of you that feels like you’ve proven yourself as a GM in this league due to everything the team was able to accomplish this season?\n\nHARRISON: “Honestly, I don’t even allow myself to think that because everything we did, so much of the team went into it. It wasn’t just me on the island. I got [assistant general managers] Matt Riccardi and Michael Finley. At the time, [former Mavericks senior advisor] Dennis [Lindsey] was a pilot. Andrew Baker, our [senior director] of cap and strategy. So many people went into doing what we did. Even J-Kidd, in terms of helping with the type of players that we need. It’s not just me sitting there at the head of the table waving the magic wand. It’s truly a team effort. If anything, that’s why when we’re successful, my excitement goes towards the team’s mission. Looking around knowing where people came from, knowing their background. Again, J-Kidd, he was in the Finals as a player and now as a coach. That’s special. He got a lot of scrutiny. There’s a lot of people in our organization that have been in the NBA long time. They’ve never been to the Western Conference Finals or the Eastern Conference Final, let alone the Finals. So I get excitement in that. But sitting back, watching the room and how everybody’s journey is different to get to where we’re at, that’s where I get excited.”\n\nQ: What are you looking forward to most about next season?\n\nHARRISON: “[I’m] looking to see how we respond to the year we had. How do guys come back? You’re no longer hunting people. They’re going to be hunting. So how do you respond? Do we finish games off? Does everybody come in shape, ready to go? That’s the type of stuff I’m excited to see.”"
