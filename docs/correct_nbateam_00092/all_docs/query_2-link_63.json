        "text": "The best part was not the Minnesota Timberwolves staying alive and forcing a Game 5.\n\nIt wasn't even Anthony Edwards drilling a dagger on the Dallas Mavericks' home court or Ant-Man hanging out with Cowboys defender Micah Parsons after a season-saving win.\n\nThe best part was saved for last.\n\nEdwards, a 22-year-old guard soaring to the top of the NBA, finished the biggest playoff performance of his young career by quoting the basketball legend he is so often compared to.\n\nMichael Jordan has become a constant social-media meme, thanks to his famous 'And I took that personally' line in the ESPN/Netflix documentary The Last Dance.\n\n\"Get the f*** out of here,\" Jordan said. \"Go f****** anywhere, but you're out of here. Whoever's not with us, all you f****** go to hell.\"\n\nWell known for his intensely competitive spirit, Jordan used every slight -- real or perceived -- to pump himself up and went out of his way to take things personally during his playing days.\n\nEdwards did the same as the T-Wolves stayed alive in 2024.\n\n\"I've never been swept in my career,\" Edwards said. \"I took it personal, man. I didn't want to get swept.\"\n\nFans loved seeing the young wolf pay tribute to the icon he is regularly compared to.\n\n\"What a baller,\" one fan tweeted.\n\n\"Great response..onto game 5 now,\" a second fan posted.\n\n\"Wolves in 7 we ain’t done,\" a third fan wrote.\n\n\"Whatever gets him fired up and ready to play, right?\" a fourth fan said.\n\nMinnesota made it 3-1 Mavs in the Western Conference finals with the series heading back to downtown Minneapolis.\n\n“Being aggressive,” Karl-Anthony Towns said. “Ain’t no time to have any doubts in your mind, especially at this time, it’s Game 4, down 3-0. Ain’t no time to have any doubts.”\n\nEdwards channeled his inner MJ to keep his team moving forward.\n\nJordan was ahead of the curve in praising the highly athletic and confident Edwards, who is leading the best Timberwolves team in 20 years.\n\n\"That brother is special,\" Jordan told ESPN. \"No question about it.\""
