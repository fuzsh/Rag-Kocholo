        "text": "Won't return Thursday\n\nThe extent of Shannon's toe injury isn't clear at the moment, so it's unclear if the issue will impact his status for Opening Night. He'll end his evening with one rebound over seven minutes.\n\nAway from team\n\nHifi posted five points (2-6 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT), one rebound and one assist in 13 minutes during Tuesday's 92-90 Summer League loss to the 76ers. While it's unclear when Hifi will return, his next chance to suit up is Thursday's Summer League matchup with Houston.\n\nStarting in SL on Sunday\n\nMiller suffered a left eye injury during Friday's Summer League contest and was forced to exit after 16 minutes of action. However, he'll be back in the starting lineup Sunday."
