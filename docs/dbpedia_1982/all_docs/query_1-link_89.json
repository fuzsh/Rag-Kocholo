        "text": "Transvaginal Ultrasound for the Diagnosis of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding.\n\nPubMed\n\nWheeler, Karen C; Goldstein, Steven R\n\n2017-03-01\n\nTransvaginal ultrasound is the first-line imaging test for the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Transvaginal ultrasound can be used to diagnose structural causes of abnormal bleeding such as polyps, adenomyosis, leiomyomas, hyperplasia, and malignancy, and can also be beneficial in making the diagnosis of ovulatory dysfunction. Traditional 2-dimensional imaging is often enhanced by the addition of 3-dimension imaging with coronal reconstruction and saline infusion sonohysterography. In this article we discuss specific ultrasound findings and technical considerations useful in the diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding.\n\nProgression of ultrasound findings of fetal syphilis after maternal treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nRac, Martha W F; Bryant, Stefanie N; McIntire, Donald D; Cantey, Joseph B; Twickler, Diane M; Wendel, George D; Sheffield, Jeanne S\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate ultrasound findings of fetal syphilis and to describe their progression after maternal treatment. This was a retrospective cohort study from September 1981 to June 2011 of seropositive women after 18 weeks of gestation who had an ultrasound before treatment to evaluate for fetal syphilis. Only those women who received treatment after the initial ultrasound scan, but before delivery, were included. If the initial ultrasound scan was abnormal, serial sonography was performed until resolution of the abnormality or delivery. Patient demographics, ultrasound findings, stage of syphilis, delivery, and infant outcomes were recorded. Standard statistical analyses were performed. Kaplan-Meier estimates were constructed to estimate time to resolution. Two hundred thirty-five women met the inclusion criteria; 73 of them (30%) had evidence of fetal syphilis on initial ultrasound scan. Abnormalities included hepatomegaly (79%), placentomegaly (27%), polyhydramnios (12%), ascites (10%) and abnormal middle cerebral arterial Doppler assessment (33%). After treatment, middle cerebral arterial Doppler assessment abnormalities, ascites, and polyhydramnios resolved first, followed by placentomegaly and finally hepatomegaly. Infant outcomes were available for 173 deliveries; of these, 32 infants (18%) were diagnosed with congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis was more common when antenatal ultrasound abnormalities were present (39% vs 12%; P < .001). Infant examination findings at delivery were similar between women with and without an abnormal pretreatment ultrasound scan. However, in those infants with congenital syphilis, hepatomegaly was the most frequent abnormality found, regardless of antenatal ultrasound findings. Sonographic signs of fetal syphilis confer a higher risk of congenital syphilis at delivery for all maternal stages. Hepatomegaly develops early and resolves last after antepartum treatment.

The data of congenital abnormalities was obtained from the obstetrical database and medical records of all cases complicated by congenital abnormalities, delivering from January 2001 to December 2003 and was reviewed. Antenatal ultrasounds had been performed by operators with different level of experience. In addition this data was retrieved from the termination and Congenital anomaly register. A structured data collection form was used to collect information of different variables of interest. Congenital abnormalities, complicated 2.8% (n=170), of all deliveries, including all cases of termination of pregnancy, stillbirth and live births. Out of the total, 11.6% occurred in women above the age of 35 years. Consanguinity was found in 18.2% cases. Prenatal diagnosis was made in just under half of the cases (48.8%). Central nervous system and renal abnormalities were commonly diagnosed. However, facial defects, heart defects or skeletal defects were more commonly missed. Antenatal ultrasound successfully diagnosed foetal abnormalities in 48.8% of cases, and more than 90% Central Nervous system defects and renal abnormalities. In contrast about a quarter of Cardiac defects and none of the facial defects were detected. Based on these findings we recommend that the Sonologist should incorporate four chamber view of the heart and also look at the face carefully.\n\nAnterolateral ankle impingement: findings and diagnostic accuracy with ultrasound imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcCarthy, C L; Wilson, D J; Coltman, T P\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThe objective was to evaluate the findings and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in antero-lateral ankle impingement (ALI) with clinical and arthroscopic correlation. Seventeen elite footballers with chronic ankle pain were referred for ultrasound with a clinical diagnosis of ALI (n = 8) or a control condition (n = 9; lateral mechanical instability, osteochondral defect, intra-articular bodies and osteoarthritis). Ultrasound examination included the antero-lateral gutter for abnormal synovial tissue (synovitic lesion), lateral ligament integrity, tibiotalar joint and osseous spurs of the distal tibia and talus. Ultrasound findings were correlated with subsequent arthroscopic appearance. Ultrasound examination detected a synovitic mass in the antero-lateral gutter in all 8 footballers with clinical ALI (100%) and in 2 patients with a control diagnosis (22%). Arthroscopic correlation of antero-lateral synovitis and fibrosis was present in all 10 cases (100%). The synovitic lesion was seen at ultrasound as a nodular soft tissue mass of mixed echogenicity within the antero-lateral gutter, which extruded anteriorly with manual compression of the distal fibula against the tibia. Increased blood supply was detected using power Doppler imaging in only 1 patient. The synovitic lesion measured >10 mm in its maximum dimension in 7 footballers with clinical ALI and <10 mm in the control group. Additional ultrasound findings in patients with abnormal antero-lateral synovial tissue included an anterior talofibular ligament injury in all patients (n = 10), a tibiotalar joint effusion (n = 6) and osseous spurs (n = 4). Antero-lateral synovitic tissue was accurately identified at ultrasound in the absence of an effusion (n = 4). No synovitic lesion was detected at ultrasound or arthroscopy in the remaining 7 patients with a control diagnosis. Ultrasound is accurate in detecting synovitic lesions within the antero-lateral gutter, demonstrating associated ligamentous injuries and in\n\nIncidental Fetal Ultrasound Findings: Interpretation and Management.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaplan, Rebekah; Adams, Sharon\n\n2018-05-01\n\nUltrasonography is a common component of prenatal care worldwide and is often used in early pregnancy to determine gestational age, number of fetuses, fetal cardiac activity, and placental location. Patients and their families may also consider ultrasonography a social event, as it provides confirmation and reassurance of a normal pregnancy. Ultrasound screening is typically scheduled in the second trimester to visualize fetal anatomy and confirm gestational age. Most ultrasound examinations are reassuring, but some incidentally identify structural anomalies and soft markers for aneuploidy, making it necessary for health care providers to correctly interpret these findings. The health care provider's ability to prepare patients prior to the ultrasound and deliver the necessary information needed to make informed decisions regarding any follow-up screening or diagnostic testing is critical to reducing parental anxiety. Preparation for the anatomic survey should include counseling for normal and abnormal findings. The ethical concepts of patient autonomy and shared decision making are used as a guide in providing this critical information and enabling informed choices during follow-up for incidental ultrasound findings.

Since little data are available of parental decision-making after ultrasound diagnosis of foetal abnormality, we reviewed the literature on parental decision-making in genetic counselling of couples at increased genetic risk together with the literature on general decision-making theories. The findings were linked to the specific situation of parental decision-making after an ultrasound diagnosis of foetal abnormality. Based on genetic counselling studies, several cognitive mechanisms play a role in parental decision-making regarding future pregnancies. Parents often have a binary perception of risk. Probabilistic information is translated into two options: the child will or will not be affected. The graduality of chance seems to be of little importance in this process. Instead, the focus shifts to the possible consequences for future family life. General decision-making theories often focus on rationality and coherence of the decision-making process. However, studies of both the influence of framing and the influence of stress indicate that emotional mechanisms can have an important and beneficial function in the decision-making process. Cognitive mechanisms that are elicited by emotions and that are not necessarily rational can have an important and beneficial function in parental decision-making after ultrasound diagnosis of a foetal abnormality. Consequently, the process of parental decision-making should not solely be assessed on the basis of its rationality, but also on the basis of the parental emotional outcome. Copyright (c) 2005 S.

Data of 172 patients who underwent ultrasound-guided subacromial subdeltoid injection or glenohumeral joint injection were reviewed for preinjection point-of-care ultrasound findings, change in pain intensity at 2 mos from baseline, and use of care at 6 mos' postinjection. Pain intensity was measured by the numeric rating scale and a dichotomous report of global impression of significant improvement in pain. Responders were defined as those with 50% or more reduction in numeric rating scale or those with global impression of 50% or more improvement. There were 141 responders among the 172 patients analyzed. Full-thickness rotator cuff tears were higher in the ultrasound-guided subacromial subdeltoid injection group when compared with the glenohumeral joint injection group (P = 0.038) and abnormal bicipital tendon findings higher in the glenohumeral joint injection group (P = 0.016). There were no significant differences in specific abnormal U findings between responders versus nonresponders. Twelve patients had a shoulder magnetic resonance imaging and four patients underwent operative interventions after the injection. Overall pain reduction after ultrasound-guided shoulder injections was favorable in the short term. There was no specific preinjection point-of-care ultrasound findings associated with clinical pain reduction after injection. Additional imaging and operative intervention after ultrasound-guided shoulder injections seemed to be relatively low.\n\n[Ultrasound findings in rhabdomyolysis].\n\nPubMed\n\nCarrillo-Esper, RaÃºl; GalvÃ¡n-Talamantes, Yazmin; Meza-Ayala, Cynthia Margarita; Cruz-Santana, Julio Alberto; Bonilla-ResÃ©ndiz, Luis Ignacio\n\nRhabdomyolysis is defined as skeletal muscle necrosis. Ultrasound assessment has recently become a useful tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of muscle diseases, including rhabdomyolysis. A case is presented on the ultrasound findings in a patient with rhabdomyolysis. To highlight the importance of ultrasound as an essential part in the diagnosis in rhabdomyolysis, to describe the ultrasound findings, and review the literature. A 30Â year-old with post-traumatic rhabdomyolysis of both thighs. Ultrasound was performed using a Philips Sparq model with a high-frequency linear transducer (5-10MHz), in low-dimensional scanning mode (2D), in longitudinal and transverse sections at the level of both thighs. The images obtained showed disorganisation of the orientation of the muscle fibres, ground glass image, thickening of the muscular fascia, and the presence of anechoic areas. Ultrasound is a useful tool in the evaluation of rhabdomyolysis. Copyright Â© 2015 Academia Mexicana de CirugÃ­a A.C. Publicado por Masson Doyma MÃ©xico S.A.

Case report of an infant diagnosed at the age of 2 months as having Hallermann-Streiff syndrome. Spontaneous lens absorption occurred during the course of follow-up and was detected only by ultrasound biomicroscopy after the patient was prepared for cataract surgery. The changes in the anterior chamber depth and lens shapes were documented by ultrasound biomicroscopy. Retinal folds that were barely observable by conventional ophthalmoscopy because of a dense cataract were clearly shown by ultrasound biomicroscopy. Ultrasound biomicroscopy can be used to examine the lenses of eyes that are not observable with conventional optical instruments. Ultrasound biomicroscopy can also be used to study the posterior segment of microphthalmic eyes. We recommend preoperative ultrasound biomicroscopy to prevent unnecessary anesthesia and surgical preparation.\n\nExtraneural findings during peripheral nerve ultrasound: Prevalence and further assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nBignotti, Bianca; Zaottini, Federico; Airaldi, Sonia; Martinoli, Carlo; Tagliafico, Alberto\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn this study we evaluated the frequency and further assessment of extraneural findings encountered during peripheral nerve ultrasound (US). Our retrospective review identified 278 peripheral nerve US examinations of 229 patients performed between December 2014 and December 2015. Reports were reviewed to assess the number of studies without peripheral nerve abnormalities and the frequency and further assessment of extraneural findings. A total of 107 peripheral nerve US examinations of 90 patients (49 men and 41 women, mean age 55 Â± 16 years) did not report peripheral nerve abnormalities. Extraneural findings were observed in 24 of 107 (22.4%) studies. Fifteen of the 278 [5.4% (95% confidence interval 2.7%-8.1%)] studies led to a recommendation for additional imaging or clinical evaluation of an extraneural finding. At least 5.4% (15 of 278) of peripheral nerve US studies led to additional clinical or imaging assessment. Muscle Nerve 57: 65-69, 2018.

The aim of this study was to determine whether an ultrasound ordered for the investigation of AUB in adolescents detects any significant anatomic pathology or alters diagnosis and management. A retrospective chart review of 230 patients younger than 18Â years of age who presented with AUB to the gynecology clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada between January 2010 and December 2012 was completed. Findings on pelvic ultrasound and any further imaging as well as management choices for these patients were examined. Of all patients, 67.8% (156/230) had ultrasound done as part of their AUB workup. The most common diagnosis for the patients who received ultrasound examinations and the patients who did not was AUB due to an immature HPO axis. Of the patients who received an ultrasound examination, 72.4% (113/156) had normal findings; incidental findings were identified in 17.9% (28/156) and polycystic ovary syndrome morphology in 6.4% (10/156). Structural causes of AUB were found in only 2 (1.3%) of the adolescents imaged. No patient had a change in her AUB management plan because of ultrasound findings. Our results strongly suggest that pelvic ultrasound examination is not required in the initial investigation of AUB in the adolescent population because it did not alter treatment in any of our patients.

We examined the potential of ultrasound for screening of periarticular soft tissue lesions around MoM bearings. Ultrasound examinations were conducted in 88 hips (79 patients) with MoM hip resurfacings or MoM total hip arthroplasties with a large femoral head. Four qualitative ultrasound patterns were shown, including normal pattern in 69 hips, joint-expansion pattern in 11 hips, cystic pattern in 5 hips, and mass pattern in 3 hips. Hips with the latter 3 abnormal patterns showed significantly higher frequency of clinical symptoms, without significant differences of sex, duration of implantation, head sizes, and cup abduction/anteversion angles, compared with hips with normal pattern. Ultrasound examination provides sensitive screening of soft tissue reactions around MoM bearings and may be useful in monitoring progression and defining treatment for periarticular soft tissue abnormalities.

Neuropathological findings of temporal lobe dysplasia are found in thanatophoric dysplasia, and temporal and occipital lobe abnormalities have been described recently in brain imaging studies of children with hypochondroplasia. We describe twins discordant for achondroplasia, in one of whom the prenatal diagnosis was based on ultrasound and fetal MRI documentation of temporal and occipital lobe abnormalities characteristic of hypochondroplasia, in addition to the finding of short long bones. Despite the intracranial findings suggestive of hypochondroplasia, achondroplasia was confirmed following postnatal clinical and genetic testing. These intracranial abnormalities have not been previously described in a fetus with achondroplasia. Copyright Â© 2014 ISUOG.

We reviewed all pregnancies complicated by ultrasound-detected abnormalities managed on our service from April 1990 through August 1991 (N = 262). Cases with associated karyotypic abnormalities were excluded (N = 35), as were cases diagnosed after the legal gestational age limit for abortion (N = 68). The remaining 159 cases were stratified into prognosis groups of \"severe,\" \"uncertain,\" and \"mild.\" The prognostic severity of the ultrasound abnormality strongly correlated with the decision to abort (P less than .0001). Rates of termination were 0, 12, and 66% in the \"mild,\" \"uncertain,\" and \"severe\" groups, respectively. The patients' age, gravidity, and parity, and the fetal gestational age at diagnosis did not differ significantly between the groups. 1) In non-aneuploid pregnancies with an ultrasound diagnosis of fetal abnormality, the major predictor of the decision to abort was the severity of fetal prognosis. 2) The gestational age at diagnosis was not an important variable in the decision to abort for fetal structural abnormalities. 3) Parents who had fetuses with abnormalities associated with uncertain prognoses usually opted to continue the pregnancy. This appeared to be particularly true for defects that were potentially correctable in utero or by neonatal intervention (even if investigational).\n\nMorphological and ultrasound findings in the placenta of diabetic pregnancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerceanu, Costin; Tetileanu, Adrian Victor; OfiÅ£eru, Anca Maria; BrÄtilÄ, Elvira; MehedinÅ£u, Claudia; Voicu, Nicoleta Loredana; Szasz, Florin Adrian; Berceanu, Sabina; VlÄdÄreanu, Simona; Navolan, Dan Bogdan\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to analyze the morphological, histological, immunohistochemical and ultrasound findings in the placenta of maternal type 1 and gestational diabetes, to compare the pathological changes of the placental structure in the two types of metabolic disruptions, but also to establish correlations with the expression of these findings, influenced by different associated conditions. This multicenter study includes 53 pregnancies, of which 37 with pregestational and 16 with gestational diabetes. All cases undergone specific obstetric ultrasound assessment and detailed placental scan. There were assessed 49 singleton and four twin pregnancies, all of which having live births as fetal outcome. Maternal preexisting hypertension, preeclampsia and obesity were the main associated conditions. Placental ultrasound scan revealed increased placental thickness even from the second trimester, with significant increases in the first half, and placentomegaly at the end of the third trimester. Macroscopic analysis of the placentas and umbilical cords has shown that the placentas of women with diabetes are heavier, and abnormal cord insertion has been also found. Gross analysis of maternal and fetal surfaces of the placentas revealed certain changes in both metabolic conditions. We observed 14 types of placental pathological findings in pregestational and 11 in gestational diabetes. In diabetic placenta, it is not appropriate to discuss about specific changes, but rather about a pathological diabetic pattern, influenced by associated conditions. Preconceptional and first trimester glycemic control is the key element, and euglycemia throughout pregnancy is a purpose whose accomplishment depends the maternal-fetal outcome.\n\nUltrasound Findings on Hands and Wrists of Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Relationship with Physical Examination.\n\nPubMed\n\nLins, Carolina Freitas; Lima de SÃ¡ Ribeiro, Daniel; Dourado Santos, Willer GonÃ§alves; Rosa, Genevievi; Machicado, Viviane; Pedreira, Ana Luisa; Pimenta da Fonseca, Emanuela; Mota Duque Sousa, Anna Paula; Rodrigues Silva, Carla Baleeiro; Matos, Marcos Antonio Almeida; Santiago, Mittermayer Barreto\n\n2017-09-01\n\nDiagnosis of synovitis/tenosynovitis by physical examination can be difficult. Ultrasound (US) can be an effective tool for the evaluation of joint involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study will describe musculoskeletal findings by US in SLE patients and the evaluation of their correlation with physical examination. SLE patients underwent clinical/sonographic evaluation of hand/wrists. In total, 896 joints were evaluated: at least 1 change on physical examination was found in 136 joints and at least 1 US abnormality was found in 65 of 896 joints. Out of the 65 joints with US changes, only 13 had findings on physical examination. Conversely, 111 joints had tenderness on physical examination with no sonographic abnormalities. Tenosynovitis was statistically significant more frequently with joint edema (41%) (pÂ =Â 0.0003). US can detect musculoskeletal changes in only a minority of symptomatic SLE patients. Clinical findings may be related to some reasons that cannot be explained using US. Copyright Â© 2017 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Imaging is often required to confirm diagnosis. This review article aims to provide simple and systematic guidelines for imaging assessment of PF disease, focussing on key findings detectable on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sonographic characteristics of plantar fasciitis include PF thickening, loss of fibrillar structure, perifascial collections, calcifications and hyperaemia on Doppler imaging. Thickening and signal changes in the PF as well as oedema of adjacent soft tissues and bone marrow can be assessed on MRI. Radiographic findings of plantar fasciitis include PF thickening, cortical irregularities and abnormalities in the fat pad located deep below the PF. Plantar fibromatosis appears as well-demarcated, nodular thickenings that are iso-hypoechoic on ultrasound and show low-signal intensity on MRI. PF tears present with partial or complete fibre interruption on both ultrasound and MRI. Imaging description of further PF disorders, including xanthoma, diabetic fascial disease, foreign-body reactions and plantar infections, is detailed in the main text. Ultrasound and MRI should be considered as first- and second-line modalities for assessment of PF disorders, respectively. Indirect findings of PF disease can be ruled out on plain radiography. Teaching Points â¢ PF disorders commonly cause heel pain and disability in the general population.â¢ Imaging is often required to confirm diagnosis or reveal concomitant injuries.â¢ Ultrasound and MRI respectively represent the first- and second-line modalities for diagnosis.â¢ Indirect findings of PF disease can be ruled out on plain radiography.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging findings in pediatric bilateral vocal fold dysfunction.\n\nPubMed\n\nSteiner, Joel I; Fink, A Michelle; Berkowitz, Robert G\n\n2013-07-01\n\nWe studied the findings of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in infants with idiopathic congenital bilateral vocal fold dysfunction (CBVFD). We performed a retrospective investigation of a case series. We identified 26 children (14 male, 12 female) over 11 years. Three children were excluded. Thirteen patients required airway interventions, including continuous positive airway pressure (4 patients), endotracheal intubation (1), and tracheostomy (8). The findings on brain MRI were abnormal in 8 patients (35%). Tracheostomy was required in 3 patients (38%) with abnormal MRI findings, as compared with 5 of 15 patients (33%) with normal MRI findings. The MRI abnormalities involved evidence of white matter injury (2), abnormal white matter signal (1), subdural blood (3), cerebral swelling (1), and perisylvian polymicrogyria (1). The cranial ultrasound findings were abnormal in 4 of 11 patients. The MRI findings were abnormal in 2 of 7 children in whom the cranial ultrasound findings were normal, and in 2 of the 4 patients in whom the cranial ultrasound findings were abnormal. The MRI abnormalities were nonspecific; however, they may indicate unrecognized perinatal intracranial injury as being related to CBVFD. In addition, MRI may reveal an underlying structural brain anomaly. Cranial ultrasound has poor sensitivity and specificity. Hence, MRI should be considered as part of the routine assessment of neonates with CBVFD.\n\nCow's milk allergy: color Doppler ultrasound findings in infants with hematochezia.\n\nPubMed\n\nEpifanio, Matias; Spolidoro, Jose Vicente; Missima, Nathalia Guarienti; Soder, Ricardo Bernardi; Garcia, Pedro Celiny Ramos; Baldisserotto, Matteo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nultrasound (US) has been an important diagnostic tool to identify several causes of gastrointestinal bleeding. Infants with cow's milk allergy (CMA) may present hematochezia and the confirmation of the diagnosis can be difficult. The aim of this study is to describe grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound findings in patients with CMA. we retrospectively studied 13 infants with CMA. All infants presented severe hematochezia and abdominal pain. All underwent an US study with the diagnosis of allergic colitis. This diagnosis was based on clinical findings, recovery after infant or mother exclusion diets in the case of exclusive breastfeeding and positive oral challenge test. the mean age ranged from 1 to 6 months (mean=3.53). Seven out of 13 infants (53.8%) had grayscale and color Doppler sonographic repeated after exclusion diet. Twelve out of 13 (92,3%) showed abnormalities at US and CDUS at beginning. The positive findings suggesting colitis were thickened bowel walls and increased vascularity, especially in the descending and sigmoid colon. Colonoscopy and histopathological findings were compatible with allergic colitis. After a diet change the 13 infants recovered and their oral challenge tests were positive. Doppler US may be very useful in diagnosing secondary colitis, such as CMA, and to exclude several other abdominal diseases that can emulate this disease.

A total of 103 boys were tested for urinary schistosomiasis using the urine filtration method. Schistosoma haematobium (S. haematobium) eggs were counted. Ultrasound was performed for all the positive subjects. Seventy-three (71%) subjects were positive for S. haematobium. The mean age was 11.3 Â± 2.9 years. Sixty-six (90.4%) subjects showed urinary tract abnormalities. The findings revealed the following degrees of wall thickening: 53.0% mild, 18.2% moderate and 21.2% severe. Urinary bladder polyp(s) were noted in 43.3% (single) and 40.9% (multiple) of the subjects, and calcification of the bladder wall was observed in 7.6% subjects. Ureteric dilatation was noted in 38/73 (52.0%), while hydronephrosis was detected in 19/73 (26.3%). The vast majority of urinary tract schistomiasis lesions were in the urinary bladder. Ultrasound is a useful tool for identifying the morbidity of S. haematobium in endemic areas.\n\nUniversal Head Ultrasound Screening in Full-term Neonates: A Retrospective Analysis of 6771 Infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nBallardini, Elisa; Tarocco, Anna; Rosignoli, Chiara; Baldan, Alessandro; Borgna-Pignatti, Caterina; Garani, Giampaolo\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull-term neonates may have asymptomatic cranial injuries at birth and head ultrasound screening could be useful for early diagnosis. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and type of intracranial abnormalities and the usefulness of head ultrasound screening in these infants. Head ultrasound screening was performed on all full-term neonates (gestational age between 37 and 42Â weeks), born at Sant'Anna University Hospital of Ferrara, Italy, from June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2013. Ultrasound findings were categorized into three groups: normal, minor, and major anomalies. All full-term neonates (6771) born at our hospital underwent head ultrasound screening. One hundred fourteen of 6771 (1.7%) presented ultrasound abnormalities, whereas 6657 were normal or exhibited insignificant findings. In 101 of 114 (88.6%), abnormalities were minor, and only 13 infants had major abnormalities (0.19% of all full-term newborns). All neonates with major abnormalities presented with either microcephaly or abnormal neurologicalÂ evaluations. Only one individual with major abnormalities was detected exclusively by ultrasound. The number of significant anomalies detected by head ultrasound screening in asymptomatic full-term neonates born during the study period was low. Therefore, there is no indication for routine general head ultrasound screening in these patients. However, even if low, in neonates who have neurologicalÂ abnormalities, risk factors or suspected brain malformations, head ultrasound screening may play an important role in the early diagnosis of intracranial anomalies.

A range of benefits and risks have been explored in the literature. One persistent concern has been the identification and management of abnormal physical findings. Two previous studies have attempted to quantify the risk, one through the discussion of two exemplar cases and the other with a retrospective student survey. Here, we report the first prospective study of the number and type of abnormalities encountered as part of early clinical skills learning in a medical programme. We have a formal written consent process for PPE, which includes the management of abnormal findings through the completion of an event form. Our data come from cohorts undertaking yearsÂ 2 and 3 of the programme between 2003 and 2014. One persistent concern (of PPE) has been the identification and management of abnormal physical findings RESULTS: Nineteen event forms were completed over this period. The incidence rates per year ranged from 0.23 to 1.05Â perÂ cent. Abnormal findings included raised blood pressure, heart murmur, abnormal bedside test values, and eye and skin conditions. The low event rate, along with a feasible process for dealing with this issue, goes some way to reassuring those with concerns. We acknowledge that some abnormalities may have been missed, and that some data may have been lost as a result of incorrect process; however, even the highest annual rate is low in absolute terms. We recommend a formal process for managing abnormalities. Ideally this would be part of an overall PPE written policy, communicated to students, enacted by tutors and approved by the local ethics committee.

This is a retrospective review of 350 Turkish women who underwent transvaginal ultrasonography and suction curettage as a result of abnormal uterine bleeding. Sonographic appearance of the endometrium was normal in 244 patients (69.7%), while homogeneous thickening was detected in 47 patients (13.4%) and cystic thickening in 21 patients (6.0%). A sonographic diagnosis of endometrial polyp was made in 38 patients (10.9%). Histopathological analysis of endometrial samplings revealed proliferative endometrium (36%), secretory endometrium (24.6%), decidualization (10.9%), endometrial polyp (8.3%), endometritis (6.8%), endometrial hyperplasia (4.6%), irregular shedding (3.7%), atrophic endometrium (3.1%), endometrial cancer (1.1%) and placental retention (0.9%). The sonographic and histopathological findings correlated significantly (Ï(2) = 122Â 768, P = 0.001; r = 0.215, P = 0.001). Approximately 51% of the women with homogeneous endometrial thickening had proliferative endometrium. Only 44.7% of the women with ultrasonographically visualized endometrial polyps had histopathologically diagnosed endometrial polyps. Nearly 57% of the women with cystic endometrial thickening had proliferative endometrium. If there is no facility for hysteroscopy or hysteroscopy-guided endometrial biopsy for women with abnormal uterine bleeding, transvaginal ultrasonography findings can be efficiently used to make a preliminary diagnosis and, thus, notify the pathologists.

This prospective observational cross-sectional study was conducted during the July 2013 to December 2013 study period. Sixty-nine women with infertility were enrolled. In the mid to late follicular phase of each subject's menstrual cycle, 3D transvaginal ultrasound and hysteroscopy were performed on the same day in each patient. Hysteroscopy is widely considered to be the gold standard method for investigation of the uterine cavity. Uterine cavity characteristics and abnormalities were recorded. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were evaluated. Hysteroscopy was successfully performed in all subjects. Hysteroscopy diagnosed pathological findings in 22 of 69 cases (31.8%). There were 18 endometrial polyps, 3 submucous myomas, and 1 septate uterus. Three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound in comparison with hysteroscopy had 84.1% diagnostic accuracy, 68.2% sensitivity, 91.5% specificity, 79% positive predictive value, and 86% negative predictive value. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 8.01 and 0.3, respectively. 3D-TVS successfully detected every case of submucous myoma and uterine anomaly. For detection of endometrial polyps, 3D-TVS had 61.1% sensitivity, 91.5% specificity, and 83.1% diagnostic accuracy. 3D-TVS demonstrated 84.1% diagnostic accuracy for detecting uterine cavity abnormalities in infertile women. A significant percentage of infertile patients had evidence of uterine cavity pathology. Hysteroscopy is, therefore, recommended for accurate detection and diagnosis of uterine cavity lesion.

Case series. Institutional study. Conventional ultrasound and CEUS were performed in the Department of Internal Medicine. Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out in the Department of Radiology within the Magnetom Avanto 1.5T and Magnetom Skyra fit 3T (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) and in the Institution of Imaging Diagnostics and Therapy (Magnetom Avanto 1.5T; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Fifteen patients who underwent an acute muscle injury were recruited. The appearance and detectable size of muscle injuries were compared between each imaging modality. The injuries were assessed by 3 independent observers and blinded between imaging modalities. All 15 injuries were identified on MRI and CEUS, whereas 10 injuries showed abnormalities in conventional ultrasound. The determination and measurement revealed significant differences between conventional ultrasound and CEUS depending on injury severity. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound revealed an impairment of microcirculation in grade I lesions (corresponding to intramuscular edema observed in MRI), which was not detectable using conventional ultrasound. Our results indicate that performing CEUS seems to be a sensitive additional diagnostic modality in the early assessment of muscle injuries. Our results highlight the advantages of CEUS in the imaging of low-grade lesions when compared with conventional ultrasound, as this was the more accurate modality for identifying intramuscular edema.\n\nUltrasound Findings in Tension Pneumothorax: A Case Report.\n\nPubMed\n\nInocencio, Maxine; Childs, Jeannine; Chilstrom, Mikaela L; Berona, Kristin\n\n2017-06-01\n\nDelayed recognition of tension pneumothorax can lead to a mortality of 31% to 91%. However, the classic physical examination findings of tracheal deviationÂ and distended neck veins are poorly sensitive in the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax. Point-of-care ultrasound is accurate in identifying the presence of pneumothorax, but sonographic findings of tension pneumothorax are less well described. We report the case of a 21-year-old man with sudden-onset left-sided chest pain. He was clinically stable without hypoxia or hypotension, and the initial chest x-ray study showed a large pneumothorax without mediastinal shift. While the patient was awaiting tube thoracostomy, a point-of-care ultrasound demonstrated findings of mediastinal shift and a dilated inferior vena cava (IVC) concerning for tension physiology, even though the patient remained hemodynamically stable. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This case demonstrates a unique clinical scenario ofÂ ultrasound evidence of tension physiology in a clinically stable patient. Although this patient was well appearing without hypotension, respiratory distress, tracheal deviation, or distended neck veins, point-of-care ultrasound revealedÂ mediastinal shift and a plethoric IVC. Given that the classic clinical signs of tension pneumothorax are not uniformly present, this case shows how point-of-care ultrasound may diagnose tension pneumothorax before clinical decompensation.

Treatment consists of intrauterine transfusion (IUT). Neuro-imaging studies in surviving neonates treated with IUT are scarce. To assess if neonates treated with IUT for fetal anaemia are at risk for cerebral injury, report the incidence and severity of brain ultrasound (US) abnormalities and explore the relation between brain US findings and perinatal parameters and neurological outcome. Brain US scans of neonates born alive between 2001 and 2008 with at least one IUT were retrospectively reviewed and classified as normal, mildly or moderately/severely abnormal. Incidences of abnormalities were calculated for full-term and preterm neonates. Presence and severity of abnormalities were related to clinical and IUT related parameters and to neurological outcome around 2 years of age (adverse: moderate or severe disability; favourable: normal or mild disability). A total of 127 neonates (82 born preterm) were included. Median number of IUTs was 3 (range 1-6) and of brain US 2 (1-6). Median gestational age and weight at birth were 36.6 (26.0-41.1) weeks and 2870 (1040-3950)g. In 72/127 (57%) neonates â¥1 abnormality was seen on brain US, classified as moderate/severe in 30/127 (24%). Neurological outcome was adverse in 5 infants. Presence of brain US abnormalities was not significantly related to any of the perinatal parameters or to neurological outcome. Neonates undergoing IUT for fetal anaemia are at high risk of brain injury. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients with breast cancer and axillary lymph nodes suspicious for metastatic disease on conventional ultrasound who underwent SE of the suspicious node before ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) were included in this study. On conventional ultrasound, the long- and short-axis diameters, long-axis-to-short-axis ratio, cortical echogenicity, thickness, and evenness were documented. The nodal vascularity was assessed on power Doppler imaging. Elastograms were evaluated for the percentage of black (hard) areas in the lymph node, and the SE-ultrasound size ratio was calculated. Two readers assessed the images independently and then in consensus in cases of disagreement. ROC AUCs were calculated for conventional ultrasound, SE, and both methods combined. Interreader reliability was assessed using kappa statistics. A total of 101 patients with 104 nodes were examined; 35 nodes were benign, and 69 had metastases. SE alone showed a significantly lower AUC (62%) than did conventional ultrasound (92%) (p<0.001). There was no difference between the AUC of conventional ultrasound and the AUC of the combination of conventional ultrasound and SE (93%) (p=0.16). Interreader reliability was moderate for all variables (Îºâ¥0.60) except the SE-ultrasound size ratio (Îº=0.35). Added SE does not improve the diagnostic ability of conventional ultrasound when evaluating abnormal axillary lymph nodes.\n\n42 CFR 37.54 - Notification of abnormal radiographic findings.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-10-01\n\n..., abnormality of cardiac shape or size, tuberculosis, lung cancer, or any other significant abnormal findings... shape or size, tuberculosis, cancer, complicated pneumoconiosis, and any other significant abnormal...\n\nTransjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt Dysfunction: Concordance of Clinical Findings, Doppler Ultrasound Examination, and Shunt Venography.\n\nPubMed\n\nOwen, Joshua M; Gaba, Ron Charles\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the concordance between clinical symptoms, Doppler ultrasound (US), and shunt venography for the detection of stent-graft transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) dysfunction. Forty-one patients (M:F 30:11, median age 55 years) who underwent contemporaneous clinical exam, Doppler US, and TIPS venography between 2003 and 2014 were retrospectively studied. Clinical symptoms (recurrent ascites or variceal bleeding) were dichotomously classified as present/absent, and US and TIPS venograms were categorized in a binary fashion as normal/abnormal. US abnormalities included high/low (>190 or <90 cm/s) TIPS velocity, significant velocity rise/fall (>50 cm/s), absent flow, and return of antegrade intra-hepatic portal flow. Venographic abnormalities included shunt stenosis/occlusion and/or pressure gradient elevation. Clinical and imaging concordance rates were calculated. Fifty-two corresponding US examinations and venograms were assessed. The median time between studies was 3 days. Forty of 52 (77%) patients were symptomatic, 33/52 (64%) US examinations were abnormal, and 20/52 (38%) TIPS venograms were abnormal. Concordance between clinical symptoms and TIPS venography was 48% (25/52), while the agreement between US and shunt venography was 65% (34/52). Clinical symptoms and the US concurred in 60% (31/52) of the patients. The sensitivity of clinical symptoms and US for the detection of venographically abnormal shunts was 80% (16/20) and 85% (17/20), respectively. Both clinical symptoms and the US had low specificity (25%, 8/32 and 50%, 16/32) for venographically abnormal shunts. Clinical findings and the US had low concordance rates with TIPS venography, with acceptable sensitivity but poor specificity. These findings suggest the need for improved noninvasive imaging methods for stent-graft TIPS surveillance.\n\nTransjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt Dysfunction: Concordance of Clinical Findings, Doppler Ultrasound Examination, and Shunt Venography\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOwen, Joshua M; Gaba, Ron Charles\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the concordance between clinical symptoms, Doppler ultrasound (US), and shunt venography for the detection of stent-graft transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) dysfunction.

This study was aimed to explore the feasibility of ultrasound assessment of lumber spine facet joints by comparing ultrasound measure values of normal and degenerative lumber spine facet joints, and by comparing measure values of ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) of degenerative lumber spine facet joints.This study included 15 patients who had chronic low back pain because of degenerative change in lumbar vertebrae, and 19 volunteers who did not have low back pain or pain in the lower limb. The ultrasound measure values (height [H] and width [W]) of normal and degenerative lumber spine facet joints were compared. And the differentiation between measure values (H and W) of ultrasound and CT of degenerative lumber spine facet joints was also analyzed.The ultrasound clearly showed abnormal facet joints lesion, which was characterized by hyperostosis on the edge of joints, bone destruction under joints, and thinner or thicker articular cartilage. There were significant differences between the ultrasound measure values of the normal (H: 1.26âÂ±â0.03âcm, W: 0.18âÂ±â0.01âcm) and abnormal facet joints (H: 1.43âÂ±â0.05âcm, W: 0.15âÂ±â0.02âcm) (all Pâ<â.05). However, there were no significant differences between the measure values of the ultrasound (H: 1.43âÂ±â0.17âcm, W: 0.15âÂ±â0.03âcm) and CT (H: 1.42âÂ±â0.16, W: 0.14âÂ±â0.03) of the degenerative lumber spine facet joints (all Pâ>â.05).Ultrasound can clearly show the structure of facet joints of lumbar spine. It is precise and feasible to assess facet joints of lumbar spine by ultrasound.

A 21-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, had generalized bowel dilation of the fetus on prenatal ultrasound at 29 gestational weeks. She and her husband were non-consanguineous, and there was no family history of congenital diarrhea. Prenatal ultrasound at 29 gestational weeks revealed a honeycomb appearance of the bowel without ascites or intraperitoneal calcification. At 36 gestational weeks, polyhydramnios dilated bowel loops were observed, and a 3,355-g male baby was delivered with a distended abdomen. Postnatally, the neonate suffered from watery diarrhea and abdominal distension but there was no mechanical bowel obstruction. An endoscopic biopsy of the small bowel revealed intracytoplasmic inclusions lined by intact microvilli in the apical surface of the intestinal epithelial cells consistent with the diagnosis of microvillus inclusion disease.

The purpose of this study was to describe how the ultrasound findings of acromioclavicular joint injury compare with radiography and MRI findings. Forty-seven patients with suspected unilateral acromioclavicular joint injury after acute trauma were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients underwent digital radiography, ultrasound and 3T MRI. A modified Rockwood classification was used to evaluate the coracoclavicular ligaments. The classifications of acromioclavicular joint injuries diagnosed with radiography, ultrasound and MRI were compared. MRI was used as the gold standard. The agreement between the ultrasound and MRI findings was very good, with a correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95 % CI: 0.72-0.90; p < 0.0001). Ultrasound detected coracoclavicular ligament injuries with a sensitivity of 88.9 %, specificity of 90.0 %, positive predictive value of 92.3 % and negative predictive value of 85.7 %. The agreement between the ultrasound and radiography findings was poor, with a correlation coefficient of 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.51-0.82; p < 0.0001). Ultrasound is an effective examination for the diagnostic work-up of lesions of the coracoclavicular ligaments in the acute phase of an acromioclavicular injury. â¢ Ultrasound is appropriate for acute acromioclavicular trauma due to its accessibility. â¢ Ultrasound contributes to the diagnostic work-up of acute lesions of the coracoclavicular ligaments. â¢ Ultrasound is appropriate in patients likely to benefit from surgical treatment. â¢ Ultrasound could be a supplement to standard radiography in acute acromioclavicular trauma.\n\nLevel of In Utero Cocaine Exposure and Neonatal Ultrasound Findings\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFrank, Deborah A.; McCarten, Kathleen M.; Robson, Caroline D.; Mirochnick, Mark; Cabral, Howard; Park, Henry; Zuckerman, Barry\n\n2008-01-01\n\nObjective To assess whether there is an association between the level of in utero cocaine exposure and findings on neonatal cranial ultrasound, controlling for potentially confounding variables. Study Design In a prospective longitudinal study, three cocaine exposure groups were defined by maternal report and infant meconium assay: unexposed, heavier cocaine exposure (>75th percentile self-reported days of use or of meconium benzoylecogonine concentration) or lighter cocaine exposure (all others). Neonatal ultrasounds from 241 well, term infants were read by a single radiologist who was masked to the exposure group. Results Infants with lighter cocaine exposure did not differ from the unexposed infants on any ultrasound findings. After controlling for infant gender, gestational age, and birth weight z scores and for maternal parity, blood pressure in labor, ethnicity, and use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana during pregnancy, the more heavily cocaine-exposed infants were more likely than the unexposed infants to show subependymal hemorrhage in the caudothalamic groove (covariate adjusted odds ratio: 3.88; 95% confidence interval: 1.45, 10.35). Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate that ultrasound findings suggestive of vascular injury to the neonatal central nervous system are related to the level of prenatal cocaine exposure. Inconsistency in previous research in identifying an association between prenatal cocaine exposure and neonatal cranial ultrasound findings may reflect failure to consider dose effects.

We present a case of dirofilariasis affecting the upper eyelid in a 2-year-old child presenting as an acutely inflammed cyst, from southern Indian state of Kerala. Live adult worm was surgically removed and confirmed to be Dirofilaria repens. Live worm showing continuous movement was seen on the pre-operative high-resolution ultrasound. Ultrasound can be helpful in pre-operative identification of live worm. Imaging findings reported in literature are very few. We describe the clinical, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.

A prospective and retrospective study was carried out by 12 French centers who enrolled 36 children infected with T. gondii during the first trimester of pregnancy and whose ultrasound examinations showed no anomaly. The outcome of these children after the age of 12 months (mean 50 months, range 12-144 months) was analyzed. Of the 36 infected children, 28 (78%) presented subclinical toxoplasmosis. Only specific IgG antibodies persisted after 1 year. The principal manifestation in 7 children (19%) was chorioretinitis without major vision loss. Their intellectual development was entirely normal. One child (3%) developed severe congenital toxoplasmosis. Since 97% of children infected with toxoplasmosis during the first trimester of pregnancy are asymptomatic or only slightly affected, we believe that in such circumstances termination of pregnancy is not indicated. However, appropriate treatment is essential and prenatal ultrasound examinations should be free of any anomaly.\n\nPrenatal Diagnosis of Abnormal Invasive Placenta by Ultrasound: Measurement of Highest Peak Systolic Velocity of Subplacental Blood Flow.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Junling; Li, Hezhou; Wang, Fang; Qin, Hongyan; Qin, Qiaohong\n\n2018-05-07\n\nThe aim of the study described here was to identify an efficient criterion for the prenatal diagnosis of abnormal invasive placenta. We evaluated 129 women with anterior placenta previa who underwent trans-abdominal ultrasound evaluation in the third trimester. Spectral Doppler ultrasonography was performed to assess the subplacental blood flow of the anterior lower uterine segment by measuring the highest peak systolic velocity and resistive index. These patients were prospectively followed until delivery and evaluated for abnormal placental invasion. The peak systolic velocity and resistive index of patients with and without abnormal placental invasion were then compared. Postpartum examination revealed that 55 of the patients had an abnormal invasive placenta, whereas the remaining 74 did not. Patients with abnormal placental invasion had a higher peak systolic velocity of the subplacental blood flow in the lower segment of the anterior aspect of the uterus (area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.91; 95% confidence interval: 0.87-0.96) than did those without abnormal placental invasion. Our preliminary investigations suggest that a peak systolic velocity of 41âcm/s can be considered a cutoff point to diagnose abnormal invasive placenta, with both good sensitivity (87%) and good specificity (78%), and the higher the peak systolic velocity, the greater is the chance of abnormal placental invasion. Resistive index had no statistical significance (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.66) in the diagnosis of abnormal invasive placenta. In conclusion, measurement of the highest peak systolic velocity of subplacental blood flow in the anterior lower uterine segment can serve as an additional marker of anterior abnormal invasive placenta.

We performed a prospective study on 70 consecutive PsA patients. Clinical assessments included components of Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) and the Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index (CPDAI). Minimal disease activity (MDA) and the following remission criteria were applied: CPDAI joint, entheses and dactylitis domains (CPDAI-JED)=0, DAPSAâ¤3.3, Boolean's remission definition and physician-judged remission (rem-phys). B-mode and power Doppler (PD-) ultrasound findings were semiquantitatively scored at 68 joints (evaluating synovia, peritendinous tissue, tendons and bony changes) and 14 entheses. Ultrasound remission and minimal ultrasound disease activity (MUDA) were defined as PD-score=0 and PD-score â¤1, respectively, at joints, peritendinous tissue, tendons and entheses. DAPSA but not CPDAI correlated with B-mode and PD-synovitis. Ultrasound signs of enthesitis, dactylitis, tenosynovitis and perisynovitis were not linked with clinical composites. Clinical remission or MDA was observed in 15.7% to 47.1% of PsA patients. Ultrasound remission and MUDA were present in 4.3% and 20.0% of patients, respectively. Joint and tendon-related PD-scores were higher in patients with active versus inactive disease according to CPDAI-JED, DAPSA, Boolean's and rem-phys, whereas no difference was observed regarding enthesitis and perisynovitis. DAPSAâ¤3.3 (OR 3.9, p=0.049) and Boolean's definition (OR 4.6, p=0.03) were more useful to predict MUDA than other remission criteria. PsA-specific composite scores partially reflect ultrasound findings. DAPSA and Boolean's remission definitions better identify MUDA patients than other clinical criteria.

Subjects and Methods We performed medical charts review from January 2008 to July 2014, retrospectively. Patients who were suspected central originated vertigo at Frenzel goggles test were included among patients who visited our hospital. To investigate the correlation with nystagmus suspected central originated vertigo and brain MRI abnormal findings, we confirmed whether performing brain MRI or not. Then we exclude that patients not performed brain MRI. Results The number of patients with perverted nystagmus was 15, upbeating was 1 and down-beating was 14. Among these patients, 5 patients have brain MRI abnormal findings. However, 2 patients with MRI abnormal findings were not associated correctly with perverted nystagmus and only 3 patients with perverted nystagmus were considered central originated vertigo and further evaluation and treatment was performed by the department of neurology. Conclusions Perverted nystagmus was considered to the abnormalities at brain lesions, especially cerebellum, but neurologic symptoms and further evaluation were needed for exact diagnosis of central originated vertigo.

In a prospective study, anti-CCP-positive patients without CS underwent ultrasound imaging of 32 joints (wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints and metatarsophalangeal joints (MTPs)) and were monitored for the development of IA. Associations between baseline ultrasound findings (grey scale (GS), power Doppler (PD) and erosions) and (1) progression to IA and (2) development of CS within an individual joint were measured. Consecutive anti-CCP-positive patients (n=136; mean age 51â years, 100 women) were followed up for median of 18.3â months (range 0.1-79.6). At baseline 96% had GS, 30% had PD and 21% had one or more erosions. IA developed in 57 patients (42%) after median of 8.6â months (range 0.1-52.4). Ultrasound abnormalities (GS â¥2, PD â¥1 or erosion â¥1) were found in 86% at baseline compared with 67% of non-progressors (Ï 2 =6.3, p=0.012). Progression to IA was significantly higher in those with ultrasound findings in any joint (excluding MTPs for GS) (GS â¥2: 55% vs 24%, HR (95% CI) 2.3 (1.0 to 4.9), p=0.038; PD â¥2: 75% vs 32%, 3.7 (2.0 to 6.9), p<0.001 and erosion â¥1: 71% vs 34%, 2.9 (1.7 to 5.1), p<0.001). Furthermore, progression occurred earlier with PD â¥2 (median 7.1 vs 52.4â months) and erosion â¥1 (15.4 vs 46.5). At the individual joint level, the trend for progression to CS was more significant for GS and PD (GS â¥2: 26% vs 3%, 9.4 (5.1 to 17.5), p<0.001; PD â¥2: 55% vs 4%, 31.3 (15.6 to 62.9), p<0.001). Ultrasound features of joint inflammation may be detected in anti-CCP-positive patients without CS. Ultrasound findings predict progression (and rate of progression) to IA, with the risk of progression highest in those with PD signal. NCT02012764; Results.

For\n\nUltrasound findings in children with toxocariasis: report on 18 cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaldisserotto, M; Conchin, C F; Soares, M da G; Araujo, M A; Kramer, B\n\n1999-05-01\n\nTo evaluate abdominal ultrasound (US) findings in children infected with Toxocara canis. Eighteen children, 18 months to 7 years of age, with serological diagnosis of T.canis infection underwent abdominal US. Eosinophil counts, hemoglobin levels and immunoglobulin E titers were measured for all patients. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechoic areas in the livers of 15 patients (83.3%). Hepatohilar lymph-node enlargement was present in 14 patients (77.7%), 2 of whom also showed peripancreatic lymph-node enlargement. Hepatomegaly was present in 13 patients (72.7%) and splenomegaly in 9 (50%). The most prevalent findings of abdominal ultrasound examination of children with T.canis infection are hepatic granulomas and abdominal lymph-node enlargement. This infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any children who exhibit these findings on abdominal US examination, especially for those with eosinophilia.\n\nASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN ULTRASOUND AND CLINICAL FINDINGS IN 87 CATS WITH URETHRAL OBSTRUCTION.\n\nPubMed\n\nNevins, Jonathan R; Mai, Wilfried; Thomas, Emily\n\n2015-01-01\n\nUrethral obstruction is a life-threatening form of feline lower urinary tract disease. Ultrasonographic risk factors for reobstruction have not been previously reported. Purposes of this retrospective cross-sectional study were to describe urinary tract ultrasound findings in cats following acute urethral obstruction and determine whether ultrasound findings were associated with reobstruction. Inclusion criteria were a physical examination and history consistent with urethral obstruction, an abdominal ultrasound including a full evaluation of the urinary system within 24 h of hospitalization, and no cystocentesis prior to ultrasound examination. Medical records for included cats were reviewed and presence of azotemia, hyperkalemia, positive urine culture, and duration of hospitalization were recorded. For medically treated cats with available outcome data, presence of reobstruction was also recorded. Ultrasound images were reviewed and urinary tract characteristics were recorded. A total of 87 cats met inclusion criteria. Common ultrasound findings for the bladder included echogenic urine sediment, bladder wall thickening, pericystic effusion, hyperechoic pericystic fat, and increased urinary echoes; and for the kidneys/ureters included pyelectasia, renomegaly, perirenal effusion, hyperechoic perirenal fat, and ureteral dilation. Six-month postdischarge outcomes were available for 61 medically treated cats and 21 of these cats had reobstruction. No findings were associated with an increased risk of reobstruction. Ultrasonographic perirenal effusion was associated with severe hyperkalemia (P = 0.009, relative risk 5.75, 95% confidence interval [1.54-21.51]). Findings supported the use of ultrasound as an adjunct for treatment planning in cats presented with urethral obstruction but not as a method for predicting risk of reobstruction.

Radiographic evaluation of these patients included computed tomography of the head and pelvic ultrasound. The pituitary glands were suspicious for abnormality in five of the eight girls. Seven girls underwent pelvic ultrasound, and in all of them the ovaries were considered to be abnormal for their chronological age; in addition, two had functional ovarian cysts.moreÂ Â» The role of diagnostic radiological studies in the diagnosis of this syndrome is discussed.Â«Â less\n\nTransperineal ultrasound compared to evacuation proctography for diagnosing enteroceles and intussusceptions.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeemhoff, M; Kluivers, K B; Govaert, B; Evers, J L H; Kessels, A G H; Baeten, C G\n\n2013-03-01\n\nThis study concerns the level of agreement between transperineal ultrasound and evacuation proctography for diagnosing enteroceles and intussusceptions. In a prospective observational study, 50 consecutive women who were planned to have an evacuation proctography underwent transperineal ultrasound too. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value, as well as the positive and negative likelihood ratio of transperineal ultrasound were assessed in comparison to evacuation proctography. To determine the interobserver agreement of transperineal ultrasound, the quadratic weighted kappa was calculated. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to show the diagnostic capability of transperineal ultrasound. For diagnosing intussusceptions (PPV 1.00), a positive finding on transperineal ultrasound was predictive of an abnormal evacuation proctography. Sensitivity of transperineal ultrasound was poor for intussusceptions (0.25). For diagnosing enteroceles, the positive likelihood ratio was 2.10 and the negative likelihood ratio, 0.85. There are many false-positive findings of enteroceles on ultrasonography (PPV 0.29). The interobserver agreement of the two ultrasonographers assessed as the quadratic weighted kappa of diagnosing enteroceles was 0.44 and that of diagnosing intussusceptions was 0.23. An intussusception on ultrasound is predictive of an abnormal evacuation proctography. For diagnosing enteroceles, the diagnostic quality of transperineal ultrasound was limited compared to evacuation proctography.\n\nPrevalence of cysts in seminal tract and abnormal semen parameters in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorra, Roser; Sarquella, Joaquim; Calabia, Jordi; MartÃ­, Jordi; Ars, Elisabet; FernÃ¡ndez-Llama, Patricia; Ballarin, Jose\n\n2008-05-01\n\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disorder with a wide range of extrarenal involvement. The scope of this study was to analyze the prevalence of seminal cysts and to correlate these findings with the sperm parameters in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. A prospective study enrolled 30 adult men with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Of these 30 patients, 22 agreed to provide a semen sample for analysis, and 28 of 30 agreed to undergo an ultrasound rectal examination. Data obtained from the semen tests and from the ultrasound study were compared. Cysts in the seminal tract were present in 10 (43.47%) of 28 individuals. Twenty of 22 patients showed abnormal semen parameters, with asthenozoospermia as the most common finding. No correlation between ultrasound findings and sperm abnormalities was observed. The presence of cysts in the seminal tract is remarkably high (43.47%); however, this finding does not correlate with sperm abnormalities, which are also a frequent finding, especially asthenozoospermia. This semen abnormality is probably related to the abnormal function of polycystins. More attention should be paid to reproductive aspects in the initial evaluation of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease before their ability to conceive is further impaired by uremia.\n\nRate of abnormal osteoarticular radiographic findings in pediatric patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetit, P; Sapin, C; Henry, G; Dahan, M; Panuel, M; BourliÃ¨re-Najean, B; Chaumoitre, K; Devred, P\n\n2001-04-01\n\nThe objective of our study was to assess the rate of abnormal radiographic findings in the most frequent osteoarticular locations of traumatic injury in a pediatric population. During two periods of 12 weeks each, all patients admitted to the pediatric emergency department for osteoarticular trauma who underwent radiography were prospectively included in this study. A connection was drawn between the rate of abnormal radiographic findings for the seven most frequently radiographed locations and the clinical findings. Of 3128 locations of trauma in 2470 children, only 22% of the radiographic examinations were considered to reveal abnormal findings. In decreasing order, the hand and fingers, the ankle, the wrist, the knee, the elbow, the foot and toes, and the forearm were the most frequently examined locations. The rate of abnormal findings was 25.7% for the hand and fingers, 9.0% for the ankle, 42.5% for the wrist, 9.5% for the knee, 33.3% for the elbow, 18.3% for the foot, and 43.2% for the forearm. When only the direct sign of fracture was taken into account, these rates decreased for the ankle and knee to 2.6% and 1.9%, respectively. There was always a significant link between the degree of clinical suspicion and the rate of abnormal radiographic findings. However, fewer than 50% of the cases with high clinical suspicion of fracture were radiographically confirmed. It appears necessary, especially in cases of lower limb trauma, to evaluate clinical tests, including the implementation of the Ottawa ankle rules, to reduce the number of unnecessary radiographic examinations. This reduction will improve some parameters of children's quality of life and will significantly decrease the cost of emergency care.\n\nUse of ultrasound imaging for the diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding in the bonnet macaque ( Macaca radiata).\n\nPubMed\n\nChaudhari, Uddhav K; Imran, M; Manjramkar, Dhananjay D; Metkari, Siddhanath M; Sable, Nilesh P; Gavhane, Dnyaneshwar S; Katkam, Rajendra R; Sachdeva, Geetanjali; Thakur, Meenakshi H; Kholkute, Sanjeeva D\n\n2017-02-01\n\nUltrasound is a powerful, low-cost, non-invasive medical tool used by laboratory animal veterinarians for diagnostic imaging. Sonohysterography and transvaginal ultrasound are frequently used to assess uterine anomalies in women presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). In the present study, we have evaluated the abdominal ultrasound of bonnet monkeys ( nâ=â8) showing spontaneous ovulatory ( nâ=â5) and anovulatory ( nâ=â3) AUB. The ovulatory ( nâ=â5) macaques showed cyclic AUB for 7-8 days. The anovulatory ( nâ=â3) macaques had irregular AUB with menstrual cycles of 40-45 days. The B-mode abdominal, colour Doppler and 3D ultrasound scans were performed during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. Ultrasound examination revealed endometrial polyps in five macaques and endometrial hyperplasia in three animals. The width and length of endometrial polyps was around 0.5-1âcm (average 0.51âÂ±â0.23âcmâÃâ0.96âÂ±â0.16âcm) with significant increase in endometrial thickness ( Pâ<â0.0002). 3D ultrasound also showed a homogeneous mass in the uterine cavity and colour Doppler ultrasound showed increased vascularity in the endometrial polyps. Endometrial hyperplasia characteristically appeared as a thickened echogenic endometrium ( Pâ<â0.0002). This study demonstrates the use of non-invasive ultrasound techniques in the diagnosis of AUB in macaques.\n\nPossible structural abnormality of the brainstem in unipolar depressive illness: a transcranial ultrasound and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSteele, J D; Bastin, M E; Wardlaw, J M; Ebmeier, K P\n\n2005-11-01\n\nMost empirically derived antidepressants increase monoamine levels. The nuclei of cells synthesising these monoamines are located in the brainstem, and projection tracts such as the medial forebrain bundle reach virtually all other brain areas. Two studies of unipolar depressive illness using transcranial ultrasound have reported reduced echogenicity of the brainstem midline in unipolar depressed patients. This may be consistent with disruption of white matter tracts, including the medial forebrain bundle, and it has been suggested that the effect of such disruption could be reversed by antidepressants. To replicate these findings in a group of unipolar depressed patients and controls. Fifteen unipolar depressed patients and 15 controls were studied using transcranial ultrasound imaging and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI). No difference in echogenicity of the brainstem midline of unipolar depressed patients was found. A possible trend (Cohen's d = 0.39) in the direction of previous studies was found. Although the echogenicity of the brainstem midline of the control group was found to be similar to previous reports, there was no reduction in the patient group. Additionally, no structural abnormality of the brainstem was identified using DT-MRI. While these data do not replicate the findings of previous studies reporting a significant reduction in the echogenicity of the brainstem midline in unipolar depressed patients, the ultrasound investigation indicated that there may be a trend in this direction. Given the importance of identifying the causes of depressive illness, it is important that other groups attempt similar studies.\n\n[Subclinical findings in the knees of taekwondo athletes: diagnostic ultrasound study].\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez HernÃ¡ndez, Luis Enrique; HernÃ¡ndez DÃ­az, Cristina; Pegueros PÃ©rez, Andrea; Franco SÃ¡nchez, JosÃ© Gilberto; Pineda VillaseÃ±or, Carlos\n\n2014-12-01\n\nTaekwondo is associated with an increased incidence of musculoskeletal injuries such as tendinopathy, synovitis, chondropathy, and ligament and meniscus injuries that may have an asymptomatic course in their initial stages, especially those located in the knee. To describe the presence of morphostructural abnormalities in asymptomatic taekwondo athletes' (TKD) knees through the use of diagnostic ultrasound (US). A cross-sectional, descriptive and comparative study. We evaluated 32 knees of 16 subjects (8 TKD and 8 recreational athletes). All subjects underwent sport-medical history and knee US. A variety of intra- and extra-articular morphostructural abnormalities were observed; the most frequent were synovitis, meniscal extrusion, and enthesopathy. The practice of Taekwondo abnormalities associated with an increased risk of knee injuries that may go unnoticed in the early stages. The use of US as an auxiliary tool in the diagnosis of these injuries and/or advisable since it can define in detail the anatomical structures subject to overuse, biomechanical stress, or repetitive trauma, and contribute to early detection of asymptomatic morphostructural alterations that may ensure timely preventive and therapeutic interventions.\n\nUltrasound-guided suprascapular nerve block: a correlation with fluoroscopic and cadaveric findings.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeng, Philip W H; Wiley, Michael J; Liang, James; Bellingham, Geoff A\n\n2010-02-01\n\nPrevious work on the ultrasound-guided injection technique and the sonoanatomy of the suprascapular region relevant to the suprascapular nerve (SSN) block suggested that the ultrasound scan showed the presence of the suprascapular notch and transverse ligament. The intended target of the ultrasound-guided injection was the notch. The objective of this case report and the subsequent cadaver dissection findings is to reassess the interpretation of the ultrasound images when locating structures for SSN block. A 45-yr-old man with chronic shoulder pain received an ultrasound-guided SSN block using the suprascapular notch as the intended target. The position of the needle was verified by fluoroscopy, which showed the tip of the needle well outside the suprascapular notch. Similar ultrasound-guided SSN blocks were performed in two cadavers. Dissections were performed which showed that the needle tips were not at the suprascapular notch but, more accurately, were close to the SSN but at the floor of the suprascapular fossa between the suprascapular and spinoglenoid notch. Our fluoroscopic and cadaver dissection findings both suggest that the ultrasound image of the SSN block shown by the well-described technique is actually targeting the nerve on the floor of the suprascapular spine between the suprascapular and spinoglenoid notches rather than the suprascapular notch itself. The structure previously identified as the transverse ligament is actually the fascia layer of the supraspinatus muscle.\n\nDiagnostic performance and useful findings of ultrasound re-evaluation for patients with equivocal CT features of acute appendicitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Mi Sung; Kwon, Heon-Ju; Kang, Kyung A; Do, In-Gu; Park, Hee-Jin; Kim, Eun Young; Hong, Hyun Pyo; Choi, Yoon Jung; Kim, Young Hwan\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTo evaluate the diagnostic performance of ultrasound and to determine which ultrasound findings are useful to differentiate appendicitis from non-appendicitis in patients who underwent ultrasound re-evaluation owing to equivocal CT features of acute appendicitis. 62 patients who underwent CT examinations for suspected appendicitis followed by ultrasound re-evaluation owing to equivocal CT findings were included. Equivocal CT findings were considered based on the presence of only one or two findings among the CT criteria, and ultrasound re-evaluation was done based on a predefined structured report form. The diagnostic performance of ultrasound and independent variables to discriminate appendicitis from non-appendicitis were assessed. There were 27 patients in the appendicitis group. The overall diagnostic performance of ultrasound re-evaluation was sensitivity of 96.3%, specificity of 91.2% and accuracy of 91.9%. In terms of the performance of individual ultrasound findings, probe-induced tenderness showed the highest accuracy (86.7%) with sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 97%, followed by non-compressibility (accuracy 71.7%, sensitivity 85.2% and specificity 60.6%). The independent ultrasound findings for discriminating appendicitis were non-compressibility (p = 0.002) and increased flow on the appendiceal wall (p = 0.001). Ultrasound re-evaluation can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy in cases with equivocal CT features for diagnosing appendicitis. The presence of non-compressibility and increased vascular flow on the appendix wall are useful ultrasound findings to discriminate appendicitis from non-appendicitis. Advances in knowledge: Ultrasound re-evaluation is useful to discriminate appendicitis from non-appendicitis when CT features are inconclusive.\n\nAutomated linking of suspicious findings between automated 3D breast ultrasound volumes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGubern-MÃ©rida, Albert; Tan, Tao; van Zelst, Jan; Mann, Ritse M.; Karssemeijer, Nico\n\n2016-03-01\n\nAutomated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is a 3D imaging technique which is rapidly emerging as a safe and relatively inexpensive modality for screening of women with dense breasts. However, reading ABUS examinations is very time consuming task since radiologists need to manually identify suspicious findings in all the different ABUS volumes available for each patient. Image analysis techniques to automatically link findings across volumes are required to speed up clinical workflow and make ABUS screening more efficient. In this study, we propose an automated system to, given the location in the ABUS volume being inspected (source), find the corresponding location in a target volume. The target volume can be a different view of the same study or the same view from a prior examination. The algorithm was evaluated using 118 linkages between suspicious abnormalities annotated in a dataset of ABUS images of 27 patients participating in a high risk screening program. The distance between the predicted location and the center of the annotated lesion in the target volume was computed for evaluation. The mean Â± stdev and median distance error achieved by the presented algorithm for linkages between volumes of the same study was 7.75Â±6.71 mm and 5.16 mm, respectively. The performance was 9.54Â±7.87 and 8.00 mm (mean Â± stdev and median) for linkages between volumes from current and prior examinations. The proposed approach has the potential to minimize user interaction for finding correspondences among ABUS volumes.\n\nAbnormal stress echocardiography findings in cardiac amyloidosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nOng, Kevin C; Askew, J Wells; Dispenzieri, Angela; Maleszewski, Joseph J; Klarich, Kyle W; Anavekar, Nandan S; Mulvagh, Sharon L; Grogan, Martha\n\n2016-06-01\n\nCardiac involvement in immunoglobulin light chain (amyloid light chain, AL) amyloidosis is characterized by myocardial interstitial deposition but can also cause obstructive deposits in the coronary microvasculature. We retrospectively identified 20 patients who underwent stress echocardiography within 1 year prior to the histologic diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. Only patients with cardiac amyloidosis and no known obstructive coronary disease were included. Stress echocardiograms (13 exercise; 7 dobutamine) were performed for evaluation of dyspnea and/or chest pain. Stress-induced wall motion abnormalities (WMAs) occurred in 11 patients (55%), 4 of whom had normal left ventricular wall thickness. Coronary angiogram was performed in 9 of 11 patients and demonstrated no or mild epicardial coronary artery disease. Seven (54%) patients had an abnormal exercise blood pressure which occurred with similar likelihood between those with and without stress-induced WMAs. Stress-induced WMAs and abnormal exercise blood pressure may occur in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis despite the absence of significant epicardial coronary artery disease. This finding should raise the possibility of cardiac amyloidosis even in the absence of significant myocardial thickening.\n\nAbnormal maternal echocardiographic findings in triplet pregnancies presenting with dyspnoea.\n\nPubMed\n\nElhenicky, Marie; Distelmaier, Klaus; Mailath-Pokorny, Mariella; Worda, Christof; Langer, Martin; Worda, Katharina\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe objective of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of abnormal maternal echocardiographic findings in triplet pregnancies presenting with dyspnoea. Between 2003 and 2013, patients' records of 96 triplet pregnancies at our department were analysed including maternal and fetal outcome, echocardiographic parameters and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. After exclusion of triplet pregnancies with fetal demise before 23â+â0 weeks, selective feticide or missing outcome data, the study population consisted of 60 triplet pregnancies. All women with dyspnoea underwent echocardiography and measurement of NT-proBNP. Dyspnoea towards the end of pregnancy was observed in 13.3% (8/60) of all women with triplet pregnancies, and all of these women underwent echocardiography. The prevalence of abnormal echocardiographic findings in women with dyspnoea was 37.5% (3/8) with peripartum cardiomyopathy in one woman. Median serum NT-proBNP was significantly higher in women with abnormal echocardiographic findings compared with those without (1779 ng/ml, range 1045-6076 ng/ml vs 172 ng/ml, range 50-311 ng/ml; pâ<â0.001 by Mann-Whitney-U Test). We conclude that triplet pregnancies presenting with dyspnoea show a high prevalence of abnormal echocardiographic findings. Since dyspnoea is a common sign in triplet pregnancies and is associated with a high rate of cardiac involvement, echocardiography and evaluation of maternal NT-proBNP could be considered to improve early diagnosis and perinatal management.\n\nRing down artefacts on abdominal sonography to predict pulmonary abnormalities in the emergency department.\n\nPubMed\n\nTsai, C-L; Wang, H-P; Lien, W-C; Chen, C-C; Lai, T-I; Chen, W-J\n\n2005-10-01\n\nRing down artefacts are sometimes found when emergency physicians perform abdominal ultrasound to differentiate between various abdominal problems. We describe a patient who presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and whose ultrasound examination showed ring down artefacts posterior to the right hemidiaphragm, which led to the eventual diagnosis of pneumonia. Ring down artefacts on ultrasound may be used to predict pulmonary abnormalities. Awareness of this sonographic finding may assist in accurate diagnosis and administration of appropriate treatment without delay.\n\n42 CFR 37.53 - Notification of abnormal roentgenographic findings.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... suggesting, enlarged heart, tuberculosis, lung cancer, or any other significant abnormal findings other than... files and the most recent examination was interpreted to show enlarged heart, tuberculosis, cancer...\n\n42 CFR 37.53 - Notification of abnormal roentgenographic findings.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-10-01\n\n... suggesting, enlarged heart, tuberculosis, lung cancer, or any other significant abnormal findings other than... files and the most recent examination was interpreted to show enlarged heart, tuberculosis, cancer...\n\nBowel ultrasound imaging in patients with cystic fibrosis: Relationship with clinical symptoms and CFTR genotype.\n\nPubMed\n\nFraquelli, Mirella; Baccarin, Alessandra; Corti, Fabiola; Conti, Clara Benedetta; Russo, Maria Chiara; Della Valle, Serena; Pozzi, Roberta; Cressoni, Massimo; Conte, Dario; Colombo, Carla\n\n2016-03-01\n\nUltrasound imaging is used to assess bowel abnormalities in gastrointestinal diseases. We aimed to assess the rate of predefined bowel ultrasound signs and their relationship with gastrointestinal symptoms and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genotype in cystic fibrosis patients in regular follow-up. Prospective study of 70 consecutive patients with cystic fibrosis and 45 controls who underwent abdominal ultrasound; pertinent findings were related to gastrointestinal symptoms and, in cystic fibrosis patients, to pancreatic status, malabsorption degree, lipase intake, CFTR genotype (classified as severe or mild against functional class of CFTR mutations). 96% patients showed at least one abnormal bowel ultrasound sign. Most frequent signs were lymph node enlargement (64%), bowel loop dilatation (55%), thick corpuscular intraluminal content (49%), bowel wall hypervascularization (26%), thickened bowel wall (22%) and intussusception (17%). Patients with recurrent abdominal pain showed more bowel wall hypervascularization than patients without recurrent pain (47% vs. 19%, respectively; p = 0.02) and intussusception (58% vs. 17%, respectively; p < 0.01). Genotype was not associated to specific bowel ultrasound signs. Patients with bowel loop intussusception showed greater lipase intake than those without intussusception (8.118 Â± 2.083 vs. 5.994 Â± 4.187, respectively; p < 0.01). Cystic fibrosis patients present a higher rate of bowel ultrasound abnormalities than controls. Bowel ultrasound abnormalities are associated with abdominal symptoms.

Data were derived from all patients with MS referred to the neurourology clinic during a 4-year period. The database was specifically queried for patients found to have upper tract abnormalities on screening renal ultrasonography. Demographic parameters, as well as laboratory values (creatinine) and urodynamic results, were evaluated for risk factors associated with abnormal upper tract findings. Of the 113 patients referred and evaluated, 66 completed both urodynamic testing and renal ultrasonography. Eleven (16.7%) had abnormal ultrasound findings, with focal caliectasis the most common finding. No demographic parameter (age, sex, time since MS diagnosis, MS pattern) was associated with a greater likelihood of abnormal renal ultrasonography on univariate analysis. Neither serum creatinine nor any urodynamic finding (including the presence of dyssynergia or the threshold and amplitude of de"
