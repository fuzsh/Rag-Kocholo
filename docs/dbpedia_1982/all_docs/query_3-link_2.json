        "text": "The formal realism of the novel allows a more immediate imitation of individual experience set in its temporal and spatial environment than do other literary forms.\n\n(Ian Watt 1957, 35–6)\n\nAs in other peripheral national literatures in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Brazilian writers and literary critics from the start faced the problem of how to interpret the value and originality of literary works that had foreign (mainly French and English) novels as implicit or explicit models. ‘To study Brazilian literature always entails doing comparative literature,’ argued the great Brazilian critic Antonio Candido.1 Literary historians in Brazil have to deal with the specific contradictions of Brazilian authors, who in the past simultaneously tried to follow European models and strived to create a genuine Brazilian literary experience. This problem began with the exotic Brazilian pastorals and epics of the neoclassical eighteenth century, pervaded Brazil’s peculiar ‘realist’ romanticism and shaped its contradictory nationalistic–cosmopolitan modernism, culminating in the anthropophagic movement of Oswald de Andrade in the 1920s, which advocated the ritual cannibalization of foreign literary forms and cultures.\n\nWith regard to the novel, a genre that has been international by nature since its beginnings, there are two important topics concerning its subgenres and displacement throughout the world: (a) how the genre arose in different countries and (b) how its forms acclimatized in historical conditions other than those of modern Europe.\n\nTo understand the rise of the Brazilian novel, and the contradictory works it produced, Ian Watt’s book The Rise of the Novel is of fundamental interest. The book is now part of the basic bibliography in many literature courses and has had several editions since its first translation into Portuguese in 1990. What interests the Brazilian critics is the way the specific relation between form and social process in Watt goes beyond the analysis of influences. Retrieving the dialectic aesthetics of Hegel and Georg Lukács, Watt argues that, to understand the rise of the novel as a new genre, we must understand how new historical situations demand new forms of literary representation.\n\nWatt’s theses on the rise of the novel have recently become very controversial. They are frequently attacked by the French, for having reduced the importance of the revolutionary roman philosophique; by the Spanish, for having overlooked Miguel de Cervantes as the real founder of the novel; by Asian critics, for foregrounding a Eurocentric vision of the development of the genre; by medievalists, for not acknowledging the continuity between romance and novel; by classicists, for forgetting that the novel began with the Greeks.2\n\nIan Watt’s main argument, consolidated from a historical perspective in the second chapter of his book, is condensed, in the first chapter, into the concept of ‘formal realism’, which encompasses several features: the rise of the individual, related to the rise of an urban middle class; the spread of secularism; the philosophy of the Enlightenment; and the rise of capitalist social and economic relations. This individual – the novelty of the novel – struggles for autonomy, acting in an enlightened way (in the sense of a free, conscious and precise articulation of means to obtain certain ends) in a world whose traditional norms and behaviours are being challenged by the ‘novelties’ of the market, modern science, new labour relations and the rise of what came to be called the ‘public sphere’.\n\nFormal realism is configured as a set of literary procedures that aim to represent this new individual ‘experience’. This involves new conceptions of characterization, new models of plot, new depictions of time and space and a new prosaic style. Watt stresses that the novel incorporates and gives new meaning and form to previous literary and non-literary genres (such as journalism, travel writing, correspondence, legal narratives, memoirs and so on). Following his analysis of early English novels, we can see that Watt is much less dogmatic and much more dialectical than many of his critics suggest.\n\nWatt’s book sheds particular light on the rise of the Brazilian novel, not because it explains it, but because it shows the impossibility of understanding it according to the criteria Watt adopted to interpret early European novels. The historical situation in nineteenth-century Brazil was obviously very different from that of eighteenth-century England, but we should not forget that the early Brazilian writers mainly used foreign novels, written and developed on the basis of the ‘formal realism’ described by Watt, as models for their writing. In this sense, the way Watt is read in Brazil and the way that part of the Brazilian critical tradition mindful of the dialectic between literary form and social process engages with his work can also facilitate the correct evaluation of his importance. In his comprehensive examination of the many works devoted to the topic, Nicholas Seager comes to the conclusion that ‘in the course of my reading for this study I have found a considerable extent of misprision and, what is worse, misrepresentation of The Rise of the Novel. It has unfortunately become a book more often caricatured than consulted.’3\n\nMembers of an educated elite, Brazilian novelists were committed to providing the new nation with a national literature, that is, to write, in Brazil, in a literary genre that, to quote Watt, ‘allows a more immediate imitation of individual experience set in its temporal and spatial environment’.4 The attempt to do so in a completely different social context, on the periphery of capitalism, gave rise to new problems, some of them of great literary interest. As Roberto Schwarz has argued: ‘Because we do not have our own tradition, we imitate, but as we do not know how to imitate well, something else results, an involuntary difference which is itself creative, innovative in its own way.’5\n\nMacedo’s Works and Contradictions\n\nTo understand the scope of these contradictions, we will examine one specific case in the rise of the novel in Brazil, focusing on an author who is considered the real first Brazilian novelist, Joaquim Manuel de Macedo (1820–82).\n\nIt is important to bear in mind some aspects of Brazil’s complex history to grasp the context in which Macedo evolved as an intellectual and wrote his many novels and plays. Brazil achieved its independence from Portugal in 1822, when the son of the Portuguese king Dom João VI, allying with local elites, became the first Brazilian emperor. A decade of regional insurrections demanded a great effort to maintain the political unity of Brazil’s immense territory. Owing to a serious political crisis in Portugal, Dom Pedro I of Brazil had to return to Europe in 1823, becoming Dom Pedro IV of Portugal, and left as heir to the crown his five-year-old son, Dom Pedro II, who would be the emperor of Brazil from 1831 to 1889.\n\nDuring the long reign of Dom Pedro II, the court of Rio de Janeiro flourished, sheltering a core of artists and intellectuals (national and foreign) engaged (the term is very relevant in Brazilian literary criticism) in providing the ‘young’ country with everything a nation needed to create its own identity in the romantic nineteenth century.\n\nWe know how much romanticism is linked to this consolidation of the idea of nation. In the periphery, in Brazil specifically, this process was much more intense, since the romantic ideal, as opposed to the universality of neoclassical aesthetics, devoted greater attention to the particular, to history recreated as heroic fact. Antonio Candido has noted that\n\nBrazilian Romanticism was initially and above all nationalism (and to a certain extent remained so to the end). And before anything else nationalism meant writing about local topics. Hence the importance of fictional narrative in prose, the most accessible and current way of presenting reality, offering the reader a greater amount of verisimilitude and thereby bringing the text closer to their personal experience.6\n\nOne of these romantic intellectuals in service of the new nation was Joaquim Manuel de Macedo.7 Graduating in medicine, with a thesis on the history and effects of melancholy, he never practised, and ended up joining the intellectual group of the Instituto Histórico e Geográfico Brasileiro (IHGB) [Brazilian Historical and Geographical Institute], with the mission, encouraged by the Emperor, to provide the country with everything necessary for its consolidation as a nation: a national history, a national geography, a national music and also a national literature.\n\nMacedo was the author of the first successful Brazilian novel of manners. Published in 1844, A moreninha [The Brunette] tells a love story in which a cunning young brunette, in contrast to the current European literary pattern of blonde female beauty, manages to win the heart of and finally marry a young medical student, accustomed to love conquests, whom she has known since their childhood. There is nothing original about the plot, but one of the reasons for the interest and success of the book (in its time and in posterity) was its attentive description of Brazilian landscape and customs. As Antonio Candido points out: ‘Brazilians seemed to enjoy the descriptions of places, customs, and the kind of people whose reality they could appraise and gave them the encouraging feeling that their country could be promoted to the compelling domain of literary art.’8\n\nMacedo continued his career by writing several novels of manners and comedies for the theatre, portraying the incipient middle class who lived around the court in Rio. Like many other contemporary intellectuals, he participated intensely in the political life of the Empire, even becoming a member of parliament for the Conservative Party. Enjoying the favour of the Emperor, he was appointed as professor of Brazilian history in the prestigious Colégio D. Pedro II, the school that formed the young elite the new nation needed. In 1860, he published his Lições de história do Brasil [Lessons of Brazil’s History], updated in successive editions, a book that would become the basic history textbook in Brazilian schools for generations, up to the first decades of the Republic. In the 1850s, the public of Rio de Janeiro, enthused about the novelties coming from Europe, began to consume more elaborate literature, moving away from the simple sentimentality of A moreninha. At that same time, disillusioned with the course that national politics was taking, Macedo tried his hand at a first comic novel, A carteira de meu tio [My Uncle’s Wallet] (1855), criticizing the vices of a young man who, sponsored by his rich uncle, is sent to study in Europe, like so many of his generation. When he returns, arrogant and Europeanized, he is intent on following a political career, not exactly to help the country, as his uncle would wish, but simply to have a good job in which he would not have to work. The uncle cuts off his allowance and forces him on a journey through the hinterland of Brazil so that he can get a closer look at the ills of this backward country run by inept politicians.\n\nThe same character is taken up again in Memórias do sobrinho de meu tio [Memoirs of My Uncle’s Nephew] (1868). He is now older and has finally inherited his uncle’s fortune. This sequel of the previous novel, written with even more mordant irony, denounces the corruption of Brazilian politics, marked by constant selfishness and little attention to the problems of the country. The main character confesses to following the ideology of the cynical ‘School of the I’, in which one learns to lie and dissimulate in order to achieve the tranquillity of a wealthy marriage and a public job. The narrator comments, ‘Do not think that this philosophy is mine alone: ​​no! It belongs to a very noble philosophical school: the head of the school is the government of Brazil.’9\n\nThe Ironic Eyeglass\n\nIn 1869, Macedo published A luneta mágica [The Magic Eyeglass]. In this novel, as in many others during the complex ‘rise of the novel’ in Brazil, the country’s social tensions come into view as formal tensions in an effort to represent characters who have not yet been completely formed through individual ‘experience’. Since the eighteenth century, this kind of experience had been taken for granted in European novels, which shaped characters who were distanced from literary types and beginning to be represented as rational individuals in newly developed literary forms. In Macedo’s novel, however, magic is the means to realistically configure the contradictions of the small and fragile Brazilian urban middle class, deprived of autonomous individuals in the European sense. The problem is posed in the first paragraph:\n\nThey call me Simplício [Simpleton] and my natural condition is sadder than my name. I was born under the sway of an evil star, I was born with the sign of misfortune. I’m short-sighted. Worse than that: [I’m] doubly short-sighted, morally and physically. Physical short-sightedness: I can’t distinguish a sunflower from a violet at the distance of two inches. That’s why I walk through the town and don’t see the buildings. Moral short-sightedness: I am always enthralled by someone else’s ideas. Because I could never coordinate two ideas of mine. That’s why when I go to the parliament and the senate, I consecutively and decidedly agree with all the orators who speak in favour and against the topic under scrutiny. If only I weren’t conscious of my moral short-sightedness … But a deep conviction of such a misfortune is the light that shines cloudlessly within my spirit.10\n\nHere, we can already trace many of the European models, such as Voltaire’s Candide and the ironic French roman philosophique, that would portray a naive character as counterpoint to society in order to reveal the lack of sense and the moral faults of the world. Far away from Europe and from the philosophical debates of the eighteenth-century European Enlightenment, in the Brazilian novel this kind of naive character acquires new and interesting features, with political, literary and historical significance.\n\nIrony is crucial here, and relates to the gap between the narrator’s remarks and the world perceived by the readers. However, in the Brazilian novel such ironic mediation operates via the development of the first-person perspective of the protagonist. The consequences are compelling, as we can read in the following extract, in which Simplício comments on the advice he receives from his brother. Instead of a contraposition between the common-sense view and the Leibnizian perspective of a foolish sage like Pangloss – who argues (even under the worst circumstances) that we are all living in the best of all possible worlds – the main character in Macedo’s novel is a rich myopic man surrounded by a world in which everyone seems to follow the ‘dynamics of economic individualism’ studied by Watt as a principal driver of the genre:\n\nMy brother Americo has been a perennial well of consolation. Nevertheless, I am haunted by the unhappiness of not being able to appreciate the wisdom that comes from his lips. I’ve already told you how he used to comfort me from my physical short-sightedness. But his kindness went beyond: when he listened to my complaints about my moral short-sightedness, he would hold my hand and talk to me thus: ‘Thank God for this misfortune. You’re free from countless sorrows, endless responsibilities, and unrelenting torments. You can’t think. But I think for you and me. You could barely take care of your affairs. But I take care of both yours and mine. You suffer less than I suffer. Because I suffer for you and me.’ What a saintly soul my brother has!11\n\nThe first turning point occurs when Simplício buys a magic eyeglass, in a kind of Faustian episode, a gothic scene that displays the usual romantic pact with the devil, and receives this piece of advice from an Armenian wizard who has just arrived in Rio de Janeiro: ‘I give you a magic eyeglass. You’ll see through it as much as it pleases you. You may see a lot. You may see too much.’12\n\nThe first part of the book shows the magically ‘enlightened’ Simplício seeing the world as it supposedly really is. Looking through his magic eyeglass, Simplício abandons his naivety and finally acquires some knowledge of the society in which he lives. Through the ‘experience’ provided by magic, he becomes wise, in this particular sense:\n\nThe knowledge of evil has operated on me a striking change of ideas and sentiments. I know now it is necessary to pretend: I know it. … I shall therefore lie and dissimulate. That’s the first lesson of the science of evil that I have received, the first step on to the tortuous path towards demoralization. But that’s inevitable, because it is necessary to lie and dissimulate in order to defend myself from unloving and perfidious relatives and, cautious and safe, carry out projects that, over the past few minutes, have been burning within my spirit exalted by resentment. In the wars of this world I shall fight with the appropriate weapons: lies against lies, dissimulation against dissimulation.13\n\nThe world reveals itself through magic as a place in which all the other characters strive for power, money and fortune, following literally Adam Smith’s liberal conception of individuals living in a modern market-oriented capitalist society – the exact historical situation that shaped the origins of the novel as described by Ian Watt. But in a country in which economic and social relations were so permeated by slavery, the possibility of representing society as a group of individuals who act rationally and pragmatically will be considered, in the novel, too scary and almost impossible to deal with.\n\nWe are not in England, and therefore the novel needs, from a Brazilian elite writer’s point of view, the magical ‘correction’ of a second part. After Simplício breaks his evil eyeglass in despair, he remembers the advice of the Armenian wizard: ‘You will be convinced that it is better to be blind than see too much.’14 In this second part, he goes back to the wizard and receives from him a second eyeglass, which shows only the good intentions and compassion of all of his relatives and countrymen.\n\nThe eyeglass works really well at the beginning, but, like the first one, it also has terrible consequences, because honesty and goodwill are not ‘realistic’ enough to enable the protagonist to act reasonably in the world. Giving his money to everyone who asks him, seeing genuine love in cunning prostitutes, unable to distinguish evil in those who take advantage of him, Simplício puts his inherited fortune in danger. Just as he had been hated before for using the first eyeglass, now he is taken by public opinion to be ridiculous:\n\nRidicule! … Ridicule is a fall into a quagmire; it is disgrace without compassion; it is the pillory a thousand times worse than the scaffold; it is the scourge more cruel than the guillotine; it is death by contempt … I’d rather be persecuted by hate than be accompanied by ridicule.15\n\nThis second bout of despair sends Simplício to the heights of Corcovado Mountain (where today Christ the Redeemer blesses the city of Rio de Janeiro), where he finally understands the consequences of his actions:\n\nThrough the vision of evil or through the vision of good, through hate or through the love of humanity; through the bad judgement of all or through the good judgement of all, the two magic eyeglasses have led me to the same danger, to the same end, to the same calamity.16\n\nSimplício is about to commit suicide when the Armenian wizard wisely intervenes, arguing that there is neither absolute evil nor absolute good, for humanity is essentially imperfect. And he gives Simplício a third eyeglass, that of common sense. The lesson is taught, the example is given and the novel ends with a call for reason: ‘Society must accept each man with his qualities and faults, exploring both of them to its profit.’17\n\nComparative Ironies\n\n‘Its profit’ … This very liberal statement was of course misplaced – and politically and ideologically violent – in a slaveholding society like Brazil. There was little room there for the growth of a modern middle class whose members could be ‘accepted’ and represented as ‘individuals’. The Brazilian intelligentsia, who in other works were trying to write foundational novels, could never be entirely critical and were always (and have been even in recent times) committed to participating in necessary ‘modernization’ processes. The final moral message of a constricted Moll Flanders, the revealing irony of any love relationships in a Jane Austen novel, the philosophical garden cultivated by Voltaire’s Candide, and the sociological urban explorations of Balzac’s characters are very far from the perspectives historically imposed on the writers who sought to establish the novel in Brazil. In the particular case of this novel of Macedo’s, it is as if only through magic could this contradictory reality be shown and literarily grasped by a novel.\n\nWe can analyse the specific differences by taking as examples two French works that were very successful in Brazil at the time and were cited in a newspaper article written by the famous Brazilian novelist José de Alencar:18 Le lorgnon (1832) by Madame Émile de Girardin19 and Les mémoires du diable by Fréderic Soulié (two volumes, 1836–8).20 In this crônica, Alencar’s narrator mentions a visit to a new optical shop in Rio where, among a number of items, he discovers an antique eyeglass which on examination he finds to be magical. He buys it for a bargain and on reflecting about his purchase he wonders how that magic glass, lost in antiquity and then found by Soulié in Les mémoires du diable, could now be in his pocket; he conjectures what misfortune had brought Delfina Gay’s lorgnon as far as Rio, to end up in that shop, ‘unknown, ignored by all’.21 A flurry of ideas takes hold of him; fantastic visions suddenly come to him. After lunch, he remembers he is a writer and assesses the enormous reach that magic glass could have for him: ‘Three or four coups de lorgnon would suffice to write a review that before would rob me of hours of rest and tranquillity.’22 While Alencar’s reference to both works testifies to their circulation in the imperial capital at the time, it is not implausible to think that Macedo may also have been familiar with them, since they both use as literary trigger a magic eyeglass or monocle, capable of revealing what is kept concealed in society and in the world.\n\nIn the novels of Girardin and Soulié, the tone of social critique does not tend towards moralizing compromise. Magic as a literary device for realist representation ends up as a critique of modern urban society in Europe. That is why, after a great deal of confusion and sharp moral observation of the hypocrisy of Parisian society, Girardin’s tale closes with the following piece of advice:\n\nM. et madame de Lorville sont encore possesseurs de ce lorgnon; ils le cachent avec soin aux méchants et aux ambitieux; prudence inutile, ce talisman serait sans puissance entre leurs mains; car il faut avoir l’esprit libre et le cœur pur pour juger le monde tel qu’il est; il faut n’avoir rien à désirer pour regarder sans illusion, rien à cacher pour observer sans malveillance.23\n\nIn Soulié’s novel, which was hugely successful in Brazil, Baron François-Armand de Luizzi, a kind of Faustian character, sells his soul to the devil to obtain the satisfaction of all his desires. He will escape damnation only if he can prove that he has known true happiness. Borrowing the devil’s magic eyeglass and using other magical devilish devices, Baron Luizzi experiences a series of picaresque adventures that reveal every hidden corner of the depraved French society, exposing scenes of kidnapping, rape, murder and adultery. The ironic and cynical devil comments coldly on all the episodes, demonstrating that hell is not far from our world.\n\nIn both cases, we have characters living, through a magic device, genuine ‘experiences’ of the world, framed by the ‘formal realism’ described by Watt. The characters are fully formed modern individuals, who rationally seek their goals in the world, a world that reveals itself ‘as it really is’, by means of magic.\n\nThis could not happen in Brazil, especially in the hands of the bom moço [nice fellow] Macedo, a conservative teacher and official of the Empire, who could never shock his readers as his European models might have done. To discover Paris to be a debauched society was very appealing for Brazilian readers who would not feel the same if similar revelations occurred in provincial Rio de Janeiro. Therefore, the critics stressed that in his novels Macedo never deepens the psychological analysis of his characters. The narrator always predominates over the characters, mere types and moral exempla, and their actions are displayed through ‘summary judgment and no nuance’, as Candido notes.24\n\nIn his late novels, Macedo tries to get closer to realism, like so many of his generation, but yet remains strongly marked by romantic traits. The Brazilian public, accustomed to reading his works as those of a candid romantic author, do not welcome the novelty of his ironic novels, despite their moralistic and compromised endings. Tania Serra, author of the most important monograph on Macedo’s works, remarks, ‘By proposing a philosophy of “good sense”, in place of the ideology of evasion, Macedo, strictly speaking, is beginning to tread the path of public decline. It is the beginning of the end.’25\n\nThe shift from romanticism to realism is indeed tricky in imperial Brazil, because it cannot really combine the tradition of the novel of manners with an effective critique of society. In the same year that Macedo published A lanterna mágica, affected by debts that led him to despair, he published another novel, based on the hereditary deterministic theories in vogue in France. Trying to catch up with the latest literary trends, and surrounded by the abolitionist wave spreading all over the country, Macedo addressed the subject of slavery in the novel As vítimas–algozes. Quadros da escravidão [The Victims–Executioners. Pictures of Slavery] (1869). He writes in the preface,\n\nFollowing two opposite paths, one arrives at the spot we have been aiming, at the profound condemnation that slavery must inspire.\n\nOne of these paths extends amidst extremely severe wretchedness, and the slave’s incalculable sufferings, amidst this life of endless woe, of barren desert without an oasis, of everlasting hell in the black world of slavery. It is the picture of the harm the master does the slave, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe other shows to its sides the ignoble vices, the perversion, the hate, the ferocious instincts of the slave, the natural and spiteful enemy of his master, the miasmas, let us say so, the moral syphilis of slavery infecting the house, the farm, the masters’ families, and his concentrated anger, but always in latent conspiracy striking against the fortune, the life and the honour of his unaware oppressors.26\n\nThe difficult balance that marks his other works is also present here. He admits that slavery does harm to the slave, but his main purpose in the novel is to show how it corrupts the local elite, depicted by Macedo as the actual victims while the slaves are depicted as the perverse tormentors of their owners. Macedo stresses the inherent violence of the situation, but resorts again to a moral tale. His peculiar views on the realist school that arrived in Brazil in the 1860s are voiced by a character from Nina, his 1869 novel:\n\nIn literature, Firmiano, the realist school teaches that the novelist must be the faithful copyist of life in society, of feelings, of passions and of customs; consequently, the scrupulous and subtle scrutinizer of the hearts, the informer of the tendencies and character of the times, in one word, the moral daguerreotype of the society and of the family.27\n\nIf the novel as a realist genre has always tried to show what is behind the façade, in Macedo’s novels this intent is accompanied by a moralistic feeling, appropriate to the ‘Fluminense’ (small and provincial) scale of the Brazilian middle class in Rio de Janeiro. Antonio Candido again:\n\nInstead of analyses, [Macedo] passes summary and unnuanced judgements, [and is] ready to abruptly change them when circumstances demand, and even when they do not, giving evidence of a good nature that migrates from life to literature. … His novel is situated, therefore, in the intersection of the two tendencies – one tributary of petty realism, the other, of implausible idealization.28\n\nUnlike other Brazilian novelists of the time, who were successful in exploring the exotic characteristics of the immense country, revealing its types and landscapes, Macedo insisted on writing about the incipient urban middle class of Rio de Janeiro, sandwiched between the great landowners, who held the real political and financial power, and the slaves, who were worked to exhaustion. How to think of a middle class in a society where the idea of work was despised by the social order? By remaining faithful to the subgenre of the sentimental urban novel, yet unable to develop more realistic approaches, Macedo would never be able to portray his characters as individuals capable of real ‘experiences’ in the sense that Watt considers fundamental to the rise of the novel. The situation of realism in Brazil was very different from that in modern European countries, as summarized by Antonio Candido:\n\nBalzac, for example, could without leaving Paris cover an extensive range of long-matured groups, professions, strata, whose interaction came to enrich, on the level of behaviour, those options and alternatives … which constitute the very flesh of high standard fiction. In Brazil, richness and variety were sought out through the displacement of the imagination in space, searching for a kind of exoticism that stimulates the writer’s observation and the reader’s curiosity.29\n\nResuming our argument, we can see how Ian Watt’s ideas – by emphasizing the relationship between the rise of the novel and the socio-historical conditions – function as a ‘negative’ parameter for the analysis of the rise of the novel in nineteenth-century Brazil. Displacement, here, is dialectically perceived not as lack or deficiency, but as tension between the historical and ideological assumptions consolidated in the form of the novel and the way the Brazilian elite availed themselves of the genre to try to ‘realistically represent’ the society in which they lived.\n\nIn this sense, Brazilian criticism (especially Antonio Candido’s historical systematic approach and Roberto Schwarz’s dialectical studies of the ironic realism of Machado de Assis30) has stressed the disparity between the realistic expectations of the novel (brilliantly analysed by Ian Watt) and the specific Brazilian social context, which could only plausibly configure literary representations of displaced individual experiences. Such a difficulty is at the core of the rise of the novel in many (peripheral) literatures and needs to be continually perceived by critical readers.\n\nNotes\n\n1. Antonio Candido 1993, 211.
