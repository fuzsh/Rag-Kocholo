Aunque las exposiciones, como la de Viena en 1873, tuvieran un enfoque muy fuerte en el desarrollo económico y los vastos recursos naturales de Brasil, representaciones de su población y de su cultura también desempeñaron un papel importante en la difusión de la imagen de un “nuevo Brasil” en el extranjero. Sin embargo, estas escenificaciones no estaban libres de tensiones e ilustran por lo tanto las crecientes divisiones internas del Imperio.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n1From 1861 onwards, the Brazilian government began to organize National Exhibitions staged in Rio de Janeiro, with the intention of preparing for the great World’s Fairs. In the years to follow, Brazil participated in the international exhibitions of London (1862), Paris (1867), Vienna (1873), Philadelphia (1876), and again Paris (1889). However, with the downfall of the Empire in 1889 — an event closely related to the abolition of slavery the year before — the enthusiasm to organize such huge events gradually faded. Thus, in 1900, Brazil did not even participate in the greatest and most successful fair of the 19th century, the Exposition Universelle de Paris.\n\n4At first glance, it may seem peculiar that no one has studied Brazil’s participation in the Vienna Universal Exhibition in a way that goes beyond any superficial level to include the visual and performative dimensions. However, an analysis of these dimensions at that particular World’s Fair, which must necessarily include public perception as evidenced in the press, is not an easy feat, as many of the sources are only available in German. Perhaps this helps to explain why there are such a large number of studies focusing on Brazil’s participation in earlier and later fairs, all the while omitting the Wiener Weltausstellung of 1873.\n\n1. “The Pursuit of Human Perfection”\n\n2. In Search of “True Civilization”\n\n16Although the organizers of the Vienna exhibition generally considered the “fine arts” to be an important indicator of “civilization,” Brazil’s art exhibition was quite modest in comparison to the thousands of paintings and sculptures in the art sections of France, Austria, Italy and Germany. However, even such great producers of “high culture” as the French and Italian art academies rarely presented complete retrospectives of their most renowned members at the World’s Fairs. Thus, truly innovative art, such as the famous Manet paintings at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867, was not commonly found.\n\n3. Gobineau’s Heirs\n\n27Yet, the division of the world into nations, colonies and “races” reflected the widespread social Darwinist belief that the “organically” constituted nations would be in a constant “struggle for existence,” as if they were living beings. Although the World’s Fairs were perceived as fundamentally pacifist arenas of “civilization and progress,” at the same time the bristling performance of countries such as the recently created German Empire left no doubt that only the\n\n38To this day, Henschel’s photograph of the fruit vendor in Rio de Janeiro is one of his bestknown works (Image 2). At first glance, it may seem surprising that the image was presented in Vienna, as the exhibition planners were not interested in depicting Brazil as an “African” country. It does makes sense, however, when considered as a visual addition to the discourse on the “free blacks” as described in the official catalogs, in relation to the “benefits” of the Law of a Free Womb. An international audience was probably not even aware of the existence of the escravos de ganhos in Brazil, and therefore would have interpreted Henschel’s photograph as evidence that Brazilian blacks were now doing business in an independent and seemingly “free” manner. Henschel’s pictures, which were taken between 1866 and 1872 in Recife, Salvador da Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, did indeed differ from the previously common slave portraits captured by photographers such as Auguste Stahl and Christiano Júnior. Although Henschel portrayed “blacks” and slaves in front of tropical fruit or selected “exotic” backgrounds, letting them sometimes wear fictitious “African” robes, in order to appeal to a European audience interested in “exoticism,” he never reduced them to mere objects. In contrast to the common pictures of “types of Africans,” which were strongly influenced by anthropometric photography, Henschel respected his models’ individuality.\n\n4. The Image of the “Naked, Ferocious Man-Eaters”\n\n43At first glance, it seems that Frisch’s photographs have little to do with the usual pictures of the “noble savage,” presented many times at national and international exhibitions. In contrast to the indianist painters, who knew their “Brazilian Indians” only from libraries, he had actually traveled to the Amazon, probably taking the first photographs of the region’s people, landscapes, plants and animals. There, he took a series of pictures of the Amahuas-tribe, showing them with their weapons and their typical body adornments. Other tribal members posed for him while performing their daily activities, such as fishing or hunting.\n\nConclusion\n\n48Overall, the Brazilian exhibition organizers were quite successful in displaying and disseminating the image of a “modern nation” abroad. For a peripheral country such as Brazil it was not an easy task to combine images of “modernity,” associated with technological progress and “high culture,” with the dismal realities of a slaveholding monarchy, whose population was overwhelmingly poor, illiterate and “mixed-race.” Thus, in 1873 Brazil’s political elite focused on stressing the tropical abundance and natural wealth of the country, but only as long as it was clear that those natural resources could and should be dominated by man. The exhibition planners were also engaged in promoting various forms of Brazilian exoticism, but never without emphasizing their paternalistic “civilizing mission” and the ongoing “catechization” of the remaining “savages.” In this sense, the images and texts displayed in Vienna also made it clear that the gradual emancipation of slaves had already begun and that Brazil’s “peculiar institution” was not as inhumane as the international public may have thought.\n\n49In this regard, the few references to slavery, such as the Baiana Quitandeira or the euphemistic descriptions in the catalogs, were designed to demonstrate that the international Abolition Societies had no need to worry about Brazil. Within a short time, European immigration and the modernization of agriculture would transform the Empire into a “free society.” The Brazilian monarchy was therefore presented as “enlightened” and in search of “human development,” as the ethnographic photographs and exhibits were expected to prove. In this respect, indigenous cultures were already “history,” destined to make way for a “modern” Brazil. However, the visual discourse of the “modernizing tropical Empire” was simply superficial, disguising growing internal tensions and the formation of a republican opposition. On some occasions, as in the case of Gobineau’s commentary on Brazil or the exhibition organizers’ fears of being “too exotic,” these tensions even became visible within the scope of the Vienna exhibition.\n\n50At the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876 the Empire managed once more to sell the image of a “progressive and civilized” monarchy in the tropics. However, by the time of the Parisian Universal Exhibition of 1889 the aforementioned tensions had become so obvious that a substantial part of the international public increasingly doubted Brazil’s viability as a nation. Although Brazil had declared the end of slavery in May 1888, it was too late. The stark contrast between the official discourse and the harsh reality of social exclusion and underdevelopment had led to unprecedented political discontent within the country. Thus, shortly after the closure of the Parisian exhibition, the Empire finally imploded."
