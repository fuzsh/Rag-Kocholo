        "text": "8°, publisher's dark green quarter cloth over printed boards (wear at corners; short split to upper joint near head of spine), smooth spine with original printed paper label. A bit shaken. Overall in good condition. Autograph ink inscription on half title of Luiz do Rêgo Barreto da Fonseca Magalhães Pereira Leite da Costa e Silva, 1º Conde de Almarjão (Lisbon 1874-Carcavelos 1950), with penciled note in the same hand: \"Está esgotado em 1922 Almarjão.\" His monogram blindstamp in upper outer corner of the same page and of title page. Penciled note in the same hand on title page. Additional autograph of the first Conde de Almarjão on title verso. (3 ll.), 519 pp. *** This tenth edition is the first to contain the substantial contribution of Olivo Bilac, covering 1823 to 1905. The ninth edition (190-?) contained only 397 pages.The work was begun by Joaquim Manoel de Macedo (1820-1882), a native of Itaboraí, Rio de Janeiro, who is usually considered the first Brazilian novelist. His A Moreninha, published in 1844, was a tremendous popular success and is still read today. Macedo had tremendous influence as a novelist, was an important force in Brazilian theater, and was one of the most prolific authors Brazil has ever produced. He taught history and geography at the Colégio Pedro II, and was tutor of Princess Isabel's children.When he died he had completed this work only up to 1823. The editor asked Olavo Bilac, already a famous writer, to complete the Lições. Bilac wrote the sections covering 1823 to 1905 (pp. 345-513), attempting to match Macedo's tone. Bilac (1865-1918), a native of Rio de Janeiro, began but did not complete courses in medicine and law; instead he decided to devote himself to literature, and from his home in Rio de Janeiro began contributing extensively to periodicals. His first poems appeared in the Gazeta acadêmica in 1883. Major works following the appearance of Poesias in 1888 include Crônicas e novelas (1894), Sagres (1898), an expanded edition of Poesias (1902), and Tarde, published posthumously in 1919. In the last years of his life Bilac lectured throughout Brazil on national defense, specifically advocating compulsory military service. He was a charter member of the Academia Brasileira de Letras.Bilac, Raimundo Correia, Alberto de Oliveira, and Vicente de Carvalho were the four major poets of the Brazilian Parnassian school, which reacted against the excesses of Romanticism beginning in the 1870s. Of these four, the critics preferred Correia, but the public favored Bilac, and he was often referred to as the \"Prince of Brazilian poets.\" In the years immediately following his death, before Modernism took hold, Bilac was the most widely read and imitated Brazilian poet.*** Jisc locates the present edition at the National Library of Scotland only, and a later edition at Oxford University. No edition located in Porbase. Hollis and Orbis both locate only the fourth edition, 1877. NUC: CSt, LNHT, TxU.\n\nFirst Edition. String-tied wrappers; 8vo. [13 pp.]. According to a letter from John Meem to Gus Blaisdell (Winters' longtime friend) \"we had about 50 copies printed.distributed them among friends\" [from Serendipity Catalogue 41]. Olavo Bilac translated from the Portuguese by John Meem. The Last Sonnets of Pierre de Ronsard ; translated from the French by Yvor Winters. Three items: (1) A complete copy in near fine condition, lightly toned, inscribed to a noted small fine press printer/publisher by Janet [Lewis] Winters with an accompanying post card dated April 2, 1991, conveying this copy (\"Nancy Meem [John Meem's daughter] . sent me half of her hoard\"; (2) an incomplete else easily very good copy missing one leaf therefore four of the poems; (3) a single leaf folded (proof?) with title page for the Bilac entries and poem IV of Winters translation. All housed in a custom linen folding case in matching slipcase with marbled-paper covers and printed paper spine label. With nineteen copies housed in institutions, extremely fragile, a rare survival, especially inscribed by Mrs. Winters herself a famous writer. This book published in the same year and place as (and possibly preceding) his first book, published by his friend Monroe Wheeler who also had been a student at the Univ. Chicago. Winters won the Bollingen Prize for his COLLECTED POEMS, but is better known as a critic and best known as a teacher of poets: Thom Gunn, Edgar Bowers, J. V. Cunningham and others associated with Stanford, many who came their because of Winters' reputation. Janet Lewis was also a noted poet, but best known for her THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE."
