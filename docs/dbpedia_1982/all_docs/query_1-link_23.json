        "text": "José Rodrigues Miguéis Papers\n\nThe José Rodrigues Miguéis Papers are housed at an off-campus climate-controlled storage facility and can be consulted at the John Hay Library by appointment. The collection holds the personal papers and selected volumes from the private library of the late Portuguese writer and includes drafts and typescripts of his writings, personal and professional correspondence, notebooks, postcards, diplomas, calendars, diaries, photographs, legal and medical documents, drawings, newspaper clippings, book reviews, and monographs.\n\nMiguéis’ correspondence includes letters to Câmara Reys, Raul Proença, Jaime Cortesão, Mário de Castro, António Sérgio, Manuel Mendes, Mário Dionísio, Manuel Rodrigues Lapa, David Mourão-Ferreira, Jacinto Baptista, Mário Neves, José Gomes Ferreira, José Cardoso Pires, Natália Correira, Raul Hestnes Ferreira, Jorge de Sena, John Austin Kerr, Aquilino Ribeiro, and José Saramago among others.\n\nA finding aid and a microfilm copy of the collection are available to researchers.\n\nHubert Dudley Jennings Papers\n\nBorn in London in 1896, Hubert Jennings served in World War I and moved to South Africa after graduating from the University of Wales. In his newly adopted land, Jennings became Assistant Headmaster at Durban High School, where he remained employed for the next twelve years (1923-1935). Jennings was one of the first biographers of Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa and one of the first scholars to be interested in Pessoa’s English poetry. Jennings left an invaluable contribution to Pessoan studies with his biographical works on the poet’s stay in South Africa – Fernando Pessoa in Durban (1986) and Os Dois Exílios: Fernando Pessoa na África do Sul (1984).\n\nThrough this gift, accessible at the John Hay Library and the Brown Digital Repository, scholars will get a unique glimpse at Pessoa’s life in South Africa following his father’s death. Aside from his published works, Hubert Jennings also left a complete and unpublished book about Fernando Pessoa; plans and notes for other books on the noted writer; an inventory of Pessoa’s estate; numerous transcriptions and translations of Pessoa’s poetry and prose; original short stories taking place in Portugal; a considerable correspondence with writers and scholars from around the world interested in Pessoa’s work; and photos and copies of documents regarding Pessoa’s life, which complement the collection of artifacts housed at the National Library of Portugal and Casa Fernando Pessoa.\n\nA finding aid of the collection is available online to researchers. Issue 8 of the academic journal Pessoa Plural was dedicated to Hubert Jennings. You may view it in PDF: Part 1 and Part 2. Pessoa Plural is published jointly by the Department of Portuguese and Brazilian Studies at Brown University, the Department of English and Comparative Literary Studies at Warwick University and the Department of Humanities and Literature of the University of the Andes.\n\nThe entire Hubert Jennings collection is now freely accessible online through the Brown Digital Repository.\n\nPortugal’s Carnation Revolution Ephemera Collection\n\nThe Carnation Revolution, also referred to as the ‘25th of April’, was initially a military coup, later a popular movement in Portugal, beginning in April 1974 which overthrew the authoritarian regime of the Estado Novo.\n\nThis collection includes over 1,000 leaflets, journals, broadsheets, magazines, books and ephemera relating to the Portuguese ‘Carnation’ Revolution of 1974-1975. The bulk of the publications are from 1973-1975 and nearly all of the material is in Portuguese. It offers a wide range of materials for a diverse set of audiences. Items include rally invitations, memos on workers’ strikes, seminal leftist texts in translation, Estado Novo propaganda, anti-imperialist leaflets, political platform brochures, and works on the communist regimes of China and Albania. Given the holistic nature of the collection, scholars will gain a sense of not only the kinds of materials being produced in Portugal during this time period, but also of the international materials and ideas that were circulating in the country during the Carnation Revolution and beyond.\n\nThe materials, divided between five sub-collections: Anti-Imperialism, Leftist Thought in Translation, Politics & Government, Popular Movements, and Portugal-China-Albania.\n\nPortuguese Journals\n\nSeara Nova: a literary and political journal founded in Lisbon in 1921 by the Portuguese writer Raul Proença and a small group of intellectuals, then little known outside Portugal. The editorial board defined the publication as a journal of “doctrine and criticism” and was committed to provide compelling pieces from the best national contemporary literary writers and journalists. Following the implementation of the Ditadura Nacional and the consolidation of the Estado Novo, Seara Nova became one of the primary national journals to openly oppose and criticize the António de Oliveira Salazar regime. Known early collaborators and editors include: Jaime Cortesão, António Sérgio, Raul Brandão, Aquilino Ribeiro, Câmara Reis, and Augusto Casimiro. Brown owns a complete set of the first series, 1921-1979.\n\nSol nascente: quinzenário de ciência, arte, e crítica: 30 January 1937-15 April 1940, 45 numbers bound together (complete run). Edited by Carlos F. Barroso, Lobatão Vital and J. Soares Lopes. Initially the review included writers from different literary and political currents: “presencistas” such as José Regio, João Gaspar Simões, Adolfo Casais Monteiro, monarchists such as Castelo Branco Chaves, and “seareiros” such as António Sérgio, Hernâni Cidade and Irene Lisboa, but eventually neo-realist writers, such as Abel Salazar, Mário Dionísio, Manuel da Fonseca, João José Cochofel, Fernando Namora, Joaquim Namorado, Alves Redol, Ávaro Cunhal, António Ramos de Almeida, Joffre Amaral Nogueira, among others, gained the upper hand. In the 10th issue it was announced that Sol nascente would henceforth “amar a luta”. This was further accentuated by a declaration in the 27th number, and even more in the 34th, the review’s second anniversary. By the third anniversary there was a pronounced affinity with the proposals of the Portuguese Communist Party. Shortly thereafter Sol nascente was suppressed by the censors of the Estado Novo. Foreign neo-realist manifestations were frequently publicized. Joaquim Namorado wrote a long article titled “Do neo-romantismo: o sentido heroico da vida na obra de Jorge Amado” (numbers 43-44, pp. 22-3). Other themes covered were education, literary creativity, opposition to the death penalty, and dialectical materialism (numbers 29 and following, 38, 40). Attention was paid to Galician literature, especially Castelao (numbers 14, 17, etc.). Garcia Lorca was one of the foreign writers most often mentioned (number 38, etc.). Sexuality, a theme almost completely absent from the Portuguese press, appeared in citations from Wilhelm Reich (number 39, etc.), and an appeal by Álvaro Cunhal, “E serão dois numa só carne” (number 39). Every issue save the first contains a reproduction of an important work of art on the front page. Artists included are Abel Salazar, Augusto Tavares, Casimiro de Carvalho, Cruz Caldas, Domínguez Alvarez, Dórdio Gomes, Frederico George, George Grosz, Gonçalves Torres, Herculano de Figueiredo, João Barreira, Joaquim Lopes, Leopoldo de Almeida, Magalhães Filho, Manuel Lima, Mendes da Silva, Nils af Strom, Simbach, Skogzila Wladyslaw and Ventura Porfírio. Many of the images depict social inequity. The final issue shows the iconic work “Café” by the Brazilian painter Candido Portinari, which had been exhibited at the Brazilian pavilion in the Exposição do Mundo Português, Belém, 1940, and resides permanently at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes do Rio de Janeiro.\n\nRei e Ordem: 896 issues bound in 6 volumes. A complete run. An important political newspaper, representing the views of a dissident wing of the Cartarista party. It deals with political events, commerce, the coming and going of ships, railroad timetables, crime, theater, other spectacles, and forays into literature. Advertisements include significant theatrical and publishing information. The most important and prolific literary contributor in the earlier issues was Raimundo António de Bulhão Pato (1829-1912).\n\nCorreio Macaense Semanario politico, litterario e de noticias: 52 numbers in 1 volume. Macau: Typographia do “Correio Macaense”, 1883-1884. First and only edition of this weekly newspaper, published in Macau. The present substantial run consists of the first year, from number 1, Sunday, 2 September 1883, through number 53, dated 31 August 1884. Each issue contains 4 pages, printed in 3 columns. A. da Silva Telles was the editor and publisher. Much of the content consists of current events and correspondence.\n\nGuarda Avançada: numbers 1-86 (6 February 1835 to 29 May 1835) + 2 (said to be of 6) supplements. Published by Joaquim Theodoro de Castro, for the most part six days per week, Monday through Saturday. Almost all issues contain 4 pages, in 3 columns. The newspaper contains extensive reporting of parliamentary debates and the politics of the day. Some reporting of international and provincial Portuguese news is also included; movements of ships in and out of the port of Lisbon are noted. There are some significant reports on the theater, as well as brief notes about crime, exchange rates and fashion.\n\nO Paiz: jornal do Partido Progressista: not complete but a significant run, consisting of the first year (of four) and most of January of the second year of this important organ of the Partido Progressista, one of the two rotating Portuguese political parties under the monarchy from 1873 to the establishment of the republic in 1910. The volume begins with number 1, issued 1 January 1873, and ends with number 318, issued 28 January 1874. It lacks numbers 5, 212, 222, and 224; possibly also lacking numbers 190 and 313, which may never have been issued. The Partido Progressista was a center-left coalition, favoring liberal ideas such as increased suffrage and secularism. It is said by both the Grande enciclopédia and Dicionário de historia de Portugal that the party was founded on 7 September 1876 by the “Pacto de Granja”, which united the Partido Histórico with the Partido Constitucional. The fact of this newspaper began 1 January 1873 proves the party’s earlier de facto existence even if the formal union of the parties opposing the more conservative Partido Regenerador was only ratified later. Content is mostly domestic and foreign news, politics, and commerce. Arrivals and departures of ships are noted. The majority of issues contain a literary section, occupying from a fifth to a third of the lower portion of the front page, sometimes continuing on to the following page. Included are serialized translations of fictional works.\n\nAlmanaque: Lisboa. Almanac. 1959-1961.\n\nÁrvore: Folhas de poesia: Lisboa: Oficinas Gráficas de Ramos, Afonso & Moita, Lda. (first three numbers) and Tipografia Ideal (final number), 1951-[1953?]. Poetry. 4 issues, a complete run. A facsimile edition was published by Campo de Letras, Porto, 2003. The four numbers are dated Outono de 1951, Inverno de 1951/52, Primavera e Verão de 1953, while the final number bears no indication whatsoever of the date of publication, though presumably it appeared in 1953. The literary editors were António Luís Moita, António Ramos Rosa, José Terra, Luís Amaro, and Raul de Carvalho. For the final number Egito Gonçalves joined the editorial board in substitution for António Luís Moita. The graphic editor was Luís Moita for the first three numbers, and Fernando Lanhas for the final number. Albano Martins and António Ramos Rosa concurred that the aim of the review was to create a space for Portuguese poetry against the existing currents of neo-realism, surrealism, and traditionalism. It should be noted that authors of these persuasions are nevertheless included, especially surrealists. The first issue contains essays “Esfinge ou a Poesia” by Eduardo Lourenço, “Sobre os Partidarismos em Poesias” by Álvaro Selema, and “Os Perigos da Poesia e a ‘Pedra Filosofal’ de Jorge de Sena,” by Vasco Miranda. There are poems by António Ramos Rosa, António Vera, Cristóvam Pavia, José Terra, Fernando Vieira, Raul de Carvalho, Sebastião da Gama, Alberto de Lacerda, António Luís Moita, Egito Gonçalves, Luís Amaro and “Páginas de Diário” by Matilde Rosa Araújo, as well as an interview with Adolfo Casais Monteiro. In a section on foreign poets, Jorge de Sena translates poems by Stephen Spender, providing an introductory essay, while António Ramos Rosa translates poems by René Char, with an introductory essay. A piece of very short fiction by Maria Guilhermina is followed by a note on the author by Matilde Rosa Araújo.

The section on foreign poets contains translations of Rainer Maria Rilke by Paulo Quintela, and Carmen Conde by Eduardo Moreiras (who provides prose information about Conde). There are essays “Sob o Signo da Poesia” by Vergílio Ferreira, “Poesia e Estilo” by Álvaro Salema, and “Poesia e Cinema: Leve Introdução ao ‘Orfeu’ de Jean Cocteau” by José-Augusto França.

The plate was designed by Dourado. The fourth and final issue begins with an essay by António Ramos Rosa, “A Poesia é um Diálogo com o Universo” (it is dedicated to João Rui de Sousa and José Gago Sequeira).

Including the anti-regime writer García Lorca, the poems of the recently deceased communist author Paul Eluard, allusions to the work of Rafael Alberti and Pablo Neruda marked this final number for the decisive intervention of the authorities on 17 April 1953. The PIDE are said to have consigned all copies of this issue they could lay hands on to the fire, according to João Gaspar Simões.\n\nAtlântida. Mensário artístico literário e social para Portugal e Brasil. Anos I-V, Nos. 1-48, a complete run. 48 issues in 12 volumes. Lisbon: n.pr., 1915-1920. 48 numbers in 42, with double issues for nos. 29-30, 33-34, 35-36, 42-43, 44-45, and 46-47. Atlântida aimed to disseminate new intellectual and social ideas; its editors were João do Rio in Brazil and João de Barros in Portugal. It includes fiction, poetry, essays, reproductions of numerous works of painting and sculpture, and many photographs. Atlântida gave special attention to the First World War, with pieces by Guerra Junqueiro, Jaime Cortesão, Teófilo Braga, and others. Among the other contributors were Aquilino Ribeiro, Raul Proença, Afonso Duarte, Afonso Lopes Vieira, Alberto Osório de Castro, Almada Negreiros, Augusto Gil, Camilo Pessanha, Cândido Figueiredo, Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, Eugénio de Castro, Hipólito Raposo, Júlio Brandão, Júlio Dantas and Teixeira de Pascoaes. The series is heavily illustrated, with 67 plates, a few of them in color; a few volumes also have color reproductions on the front wrapper. Subjects include portraits of prominent literary or political figures, sculptures (by Pinto de Couto, Soares dos Reis, Costa Motta, and Bernardelli, among others), and paintings (by Columbano, Antonio Soares, Sargent, Antonio Carneiro, Sousa Pinto, Alberto de Souza, and Jorge Barradas, among others). Black-and-white decorative woodcuts appear frequently within the text, and later issues have photographic reproductions within the text as well. Each volume has 2-3 leaves of advertisements at the end.\n\nO Baratissimo, ou O pequeno civilisador popular, semanario de conhecimentos usuaes, e de litteratura para as classes laboriosas. Nos. 1-42, July 31, 1848—May 14, 1849, a complete run. 42 issues in 1 volume. (Lisbon): n.pr., 1848-1849. This periodical was ostensibly directed to Portugal’s working classes, but actually a mouthpiece for the liberal views of its unnamed editor, João Luis Lopes. Much of the editorial content is written in the form of letters exchanged among a fictional Porto family with impeccable liberal credentials, who had lived for many years (as did Lopes) among the Portuguese émigré community in Paris. O Baratissimo includes poetry, a serialized novel entitled A familia do Arraes d’Ovar, and long, serialized discussions on such topics as freedom of thought and speech, public education, public works, and advances in civil and hydraulic engineering. There are, for instance, discussions on ways of providing Lisbon with water and the tunnel recently bored under the Thames. Virtually all of the contributions are unsigned, or signed with apparent pseudonyms; e.g., much of the poetry is signed “José Ozorio,” whose true identity we have been unable to establish. Other poems, however, are signed by the Portuguese poet and journalist Francisco Luis Lopes (b. 1816). João Luis Lopes (d. 1864) entered the military in 1824, only to be expelled five years later from the Academia de Fortificação for his liberal views. Rehabilitated in 1833, he rose to the rank of captain in the engineering corps, serving for a time as director of public works at Ponta Delgada (Azores) before being dismissed in 1847. He edited O Baratissimo while appealing his dismissal, which he successfully reversed in 1849; issue nº 40 (314-20) contains a long, signed defense of his conduct. At the end of the final issue he announces that the periodical will have to cease publication because the subscribers have been sending “rarissimas, e diminutas quantias” of the money they had promised.\n\nConimbriga: Revista mensal de arte, letras, sciências e critica. Coimbra. Art, humanities and sciences.1923.\n\nContinente: Porto. Poetry. 1927.\n\nCronos. Cadernos de Literatura. Lisboa. Nos. 1-4 and 2º série, nº 1, a complete run. 5 issues.

In the third issue are Jacinto do Prado Coelho’s “O problema da sinceridade nos textos em prosa de Fernando Pessoa” and an essay by Fernando Luso Soares on Camus and Sartre. The fourth issue includes an essay by Mário Sacramento on António Sérgio, Y.K. Centeno on Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s Emilia Galoti, and Afonso Cautela on the historical position of Surrealism. The final issue is devoted to the theater, with a brief theatrical piece by Mário Cesariny titled “O processo” (pp. 25-30), critiques of works by Günter 3 0 richard c. ramer Grass, Samuel Beckett and Eça de Queiroz, and essays on various aspects of contemporary drama. Other contributors of note include David Mourão-Ferreira, Virgilio Ferreira, Natália Correia, Urbano Tavares Rodrigues, António Pedro, Maria Judite de Carvalho, Alexandre O’Neill, António Ramos Rosa, João Medina, Fiama Hasse Pais Brandão, Tomaz Kim, and Alexandre Babo.

March to September/October 1868, 7 issues (complete run). The journal contains direct references to Camilo Castelo Branco as well as António Feliciano de Castilho, José Vieira de Castro, António Vieira de Castro, Julio Dinis, and Victor Hugo. A running theme is coverage of the Paraguayan War. It begins with a satiric poem at the end of the second issue, on p. 64, “Post–Scriptum” which reveals its editorial bias with the penultimate line, “Treme, barbaro Lopes!” There is more on this theme, this time in prose, at the beginning of the third issue, on pp. [65]–67. In the same issue, on pp. 88–9, is a piece titled “A Armada Brazileira e a Planta Impura dos Paraguayos” which begins “Como são bravos os brazileiros!” At the end of this issue, on p. 96, is a short piece titled “Um Paraguayo Disfarçado”.

On pp. 167–8 of this issue is a poem “Pennadas” which is continued on p. 183, with a third part on p. 191. On pp. 188–90 is an article titled “Novos Commettimentos: Prodigios da Metralha Brazileira”. The seventh and final issue begins, on pp. [193]–200 with a “Segunda Carta aos Illustres Membros da Colonia Brazileira Residentes n’esta Cidade”. The editor (1845–1880), a native of Porto, was a journalist involved in politics on the side of liberal democracy. With Borges de Avellar, Agostinho Albano and Guilherme Braga he founded the Diario da tarde; later, in 1874, he founded its successor, Lucta, of which he was the principal editor. He was involved with a number of other satirical, polemical and partisan publications.\n\nGraal. Poesia, teatro, ficção, ensaio, crítica. Lisbon: Empresa Nacional de Publicidade, 1956-1957.

In its choice of collaborators, this weekly magazine favored those not associated with the Estado Novo, the majority of whom had ties to MUD and were opposed to the Salazar government. There were, as would be expected, problems with the official censorship. In issue number 6, the censors obliged the magazine to publish a “Declaração” regarding two articles critical of the status quo by Antóno Ramos de Almeida, which had appeared in issue number 4. In the 52nd issue, May 1947, the suspension of the review was announced. After almost a year, the 53rd issue appeared, perhaps symbolically, on May 1, 1948, with the aid of Editorial Cosmos, directed by Manuel Rodrigues de Oliveira. Emil Anderson left the editorial board after issue number 30. Adolfo Casais Monteiro, who had been something of the de-facto editor, and whose name on the masthead irritated the authorities, withdrew from the editorial board for the final issue, but continued as a contributor. Despite this, there were then orders to suspend publication, and appeals were to no avail. Mundo literário was not doctrinaire, and was without commitment to any particular literary movement. In its pages were debated the aesthetics of neo-realism and the second wave of modernism of Presença. It attempted to expose Portuguese readers to the work of Kafka (hitherto totally unknown), Jean-Paul Sartre, Henri Michaux, José Rodrigues Miguéis, Aleixo Ribeiro, Graciliano Ramos, José Lins do Rego, Soeiro Pereira Gomes, Alves Redol, Manuel da Fonseca, and Carlos de Oliveira. In Portugal at the time, 7 4 richard c. ramer it also was unusual for introducing American authors such as Hemingway, John dos Passos, and Langston Hughes, which engendered suspicion on the part of the censors. An article by Upton Sinclair on Mark Twain appeared in issues 27 and 28. Lusophone African authors were also recognized. Number 46 was partly dedicated to the centenary of Castro Alves. There was an important polemical sequence of literary criticism between José Régio and Joel Serrão, and another between Serrão and João Gaspar Simões. After the 27th issue, literary criticism was assumed by Adolfo Casais Monteiro, António Pedro, António Ramos de Almeida, António Salgado Júnior, Armando Ventura Ferreira, Joel Serrão, Jorge de Sena and Mário Sacramento. Musical criticism was by Francine Benoit, Humberto d’Avila, and José Blanc de Portugal. Film critics were Aldolfo Casais Monteiro, Manuel de Azevedo, and Rui Grácio. Theater critics were António Pedro, Luiz Francisco Rebello, and Manuela Porto. New currents in the fine arts, as exemplified by Picasso and Portinari, were examined. The review published illustrations critical of the bourgeoisie by Bernardo Marques (issue 4), George Grosz (issue 25), Talitsky on the Holcaust and Nazi concentration camps (issue 24), and a self portrait by Dórdio Gomes (issue 6). There were also artistic contributions by Júlio (issue 31) and Júlio Pomar (issue 35). Beginning with the 5th issue, António Pedro wrote a series titled “História Breve da Pintura”. The final issue denounced the non-existence of a Museum of Modern Art in Portugal. Other important texts which appeared in the pages of this review are too numerous to mention here in their entirety. Among the most noteworthy are Adolfo Casais Monteiro, “A Crítica, a História e o Homem” (issue 1), “Valores Humanos e Valores Estéticos” (issue 6), “Guernica” (issue 10); 2 poems by Alexandre O’Neill, “A Bilha” and “Acórdeão” (issue 31); António José Saraiva, “O Pássaro Azul” (criticism of João Gaspar Simões, issue 53); António Sérgio, “A propósito de uma Discussão entre Antero de Quental e Oliveira Martins” (issue 37); Augusto Abeleira, “Sinceridade e Falta de Convicções na Obra de Fernando Pessoa” (issue 51); Jorge de Sena’s presentation of a semi-unpublished poem by Cesário Verde, “Loira” (issue 29); Diogo de Macedo, “Pousão e Colombano” (issue 3); 2 poems by Eugénio de Andrade (issue 31), and 2 more poems by the same author (issue 53); and Gilberto Freyre, “Jorge de Lima e o Movimento do Nordeste” (issue 2).

N.º 1, all published. Coimbra: Tip. F. França Amado, Successor, Julho de 1921. According to Fernando Guimarães, this review, along with others such as Ícaro, A Tradição, A Nossa Revista, Bysancio, Conímbriga, Tríptico, and Labareda, mix tendencies which were still strong in special list 274 7 7 the 1920s, among them Decadence, Symbolism, Literary Nationalism, and Saudosismo. These were to unite with the Modernism of the generation of Orpheu, preparing the way for the appearance of Presença. Nova phenix was edited by Luís Vieira de Castro and published by Luís de Sousa e Vasconcelos. In an initial essay Manuel de Meneses (pp. 1-4) disparages authors such as Júlio Dantas, Antero de Figueiredo, Carlos Malheiro Dias, António Patrício, Sousa Pinto and Augusto de Castro, among others. In the same essay, Meneses affirms that the review proposes to analyze the state of Portuguese literature and contribute to its rehabilitation, stating that the review is not the organ of any coterie, and does not present any particular program. Four sonnets by João Cabral do Nascimento (pp. 5-8) are followed by an article on Russian ballet by Ernesto Gonçalves (pp. 9-16). There are two previously unpublished letters by Camilo Castelo Branco to José Cardoso Vieira de Castro (pp. 17-9), and Luís Vieira de Castro contributes a piece of short fiction titled “Espiritual” (pp. 20-5), as well as an essay “Ideias & factos, cronica: a melhor obra de Camillo” (pp. 29-31). Álvaro Manso de Souza provides three sonnets with the collective title “Poemas Orientais” (pp. 26-8). Finally, Manuel de Meneses contributes a brief resumé of the recent “Vida Literária e Artística” (pp. 31-2), which includes favorable mention of Eugénio de Castro, Fialho de Almeida, and Aquilino Ribeiro, as well as the painter Eduardo Viana. Ruy Coelho’s opera Auto do Berço, performed at the Teatro São Carlos in Lisbon, was judged unsuccessful, though the composer’s talent was considered admirable.\n\nObservador: Revista semanal de informação.

Presenca was published in Coimbra from March 10, 1928 to November 1988 (nº 53-54). A second series, in smaller format, was printed in Lisbon, but only 2 issues appeared (November 1939 and February 1940). Complete sets are extremely rare. Presença was probably the most important Portuguese literary review of its time and one of the most important, if not the most important, of the twentieth century. António Botto commented, “APresença oferece-nos como que uma vasta e estranha síntese literária … resultante dos destroços do simbolismo aristocrático Coimbrão, do saudosismo portuense, do paulismo e futurismo lisboetas, além de tudo o que respirasse liberdade, inclusive, ou sobretudo, a sexual” (quoted in Pires, p. 245). Successor to the modernist journal Orpheu, it too published works by the leading figures in Portuguese literature, including Mário Sá-Carneiro, Fernando Pessoa, José Régio, Casais Monteiro, João Gaspar Simões, António de Sousa, Saul Dias, Branquinho da Fonseca, Almada Negreiros, Raul Leal, Alberto de Serpa, Irene Lisboa and Miguel Torga. It was responsible for introducing such foreign writers as Gide and Proust to Portuguese readers and for introducing the criticism of cinema as an art form; in addition, it emphasized contemporary music and the art of Cubists, Futurists, Primitivists and Expressionists. Presença was directed by José Régio, João Gaspar Simões and Branquinho da Fonseca; Casais Monteiro later replaced Branquinho da Fonseca. Graphic contributors included Almada Negreiros, Júlio, Mário Elói, Dórdio Gomes, João Carlos, Sara Afonso, Arlindo Vicente, Paulo, Ventura Porfírio and Bernardo Marques.\n\nPrometeu: Revista ilustrada de cultura: Porto.

He substantially revised it for the first edition in book form, published in 1876. The Revista Occidental includes works in Portuguese by Antero de Quental, Manuel de Arriaga, Luciano Cordeiro, Gonçalves Crespo, Oliveira Martins and Gomes Leal, and also works in Spanish by Cánovas del Castillo, Pi y Margall, Jacinto Octavio Picón and Patricio de la Escosura.\n\nSibila: Castelo Branco.
