        "text": "Digital Collections\n\nPrinted Works\n\nThe library holds an extensive collection of printed materials. Its holdings on early modern Portuguese expansion, on Portuguese and Brazilian literature, and on Brazilian history from Independence to 1930 are especially strong. The collection also includes important material for research on Portuguese Asia and Africa and on the comparative study of the Portuguese and Spanish empires.\n\nImage: A family pays homage to Princess Isabel, who in 1888 declared the abolition of slavery while acting as regent in the absence of her father, Dom Pedro II, Brazil’s last emperor. The Revista illustrada(Rio de Janeiro: Angelo Agostini, 1876-1895) is considered to be the most important political and satirical magazine of the 19th century in Brazil.\n\nManuscripts\n\nThe library’s manuscript collections include more than 700 items spanning the 16th to the 20th century. The library also houses the Oliveira Lima Family Papers, including letters from Machado de Assis, Joaquim Nabuco, Euclides da Cunha, José Veríssimo, Gilberto Freyre, João Lúcio de Azevedo, and other writers from Latin America, the United States and Europe.\n\nImage: Detail of watercolor portrait of Santo Antônio de Catagerona, from the library's manuscript no. I.16, “Compromisso da Irmandade de S. Antonio de Catagerona cita na matris de S. Pedro desta cidade da Bahya ... 1699.”\n\nArtworks and Other Visual Materials\n\nThe library holds several hundred artworks, including paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures. It also holds numerous maps, more than 1,000 early 20th-century postcards and 2,000 photographs, some from the dawn of photography in Brazil. Among the most important artworks are a landscape of Pernambuco by the Dutch painter Frans Post (1669); ten watercolors by the Spanish military engineer, Francisco Requena, painted on the upper Amazon in the 1780s; 18th-century maps of the New World by Juan da la Cruz Cano y Olmedilla; a portrait of the Prince Regent of Portugal, the future King John VI, by the Italian artist Domenico Pellegrini (1806); a landscape of Rio de Janeiro (ca. 1816–1821) by the French painter Nicolas Antoine Taunay ; and a bust of Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil, created from life (ca. 1826) by the French sculptor Marc Ferrez."
