        "text": "Chapter 5\n\nSelective Invisibility\n\nElizabeth Bishop, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, and World Literature\n\nLuiza Franco Moreira\n\n[A]nd though I had sold my Estate in the Brasils, yet I could not keep the Country out of my Head.\n\n—Robinson Crusoe\n\nElizabeth Bishop’s “Crusoe in England” provides a useful vantage point for exploring the perspectives opened up by the category of world literature, together with the difficulties that the category exposes. “Crusoe in England” has been widely interpreted as Bishop’s reflection on the fifteen years or more that she lived in Brazil (Millier 1993, 447; Hicok 2016, 1–3; Martins 2006, 35). During this period Bishop successfully pursued her career as an American poet: she published two collections of poetry, Poems: North and South: A Cold Spring (1955) and Questions of Travel (1965), and received the 1956 Pulitzer prize for the first one. But “Crusoe in England” is a poem from a later stage in her career. It is included in her last collection, Geography III, which appeared in 1976, a few years before her death in 1979, and after she had again settled back in the United States. (For a chronology of the composition of the poem, see Millier 1993, 446.) In this dramatic monologue, an old Robinson Crusoe looks back on his travels. The focus falls on the years he spent on a desert island and on his attraction to and affection for Friday. The parallels between the poem’s speaker and Bishop’s situation in the 1970s are evident. Like the Crusoe of her poem, Bishop had sold her house in Ouro Preto—her “Estate in the Brasils”—and had returned to the United States. By laying some stress on the erotic side of Crusoe’s love for Friday—the speaker remarks that “he had a pretty body”—Bishop indirectly refers to her own lesbian sexuality, and perhaps even, as many critics have suggested, to her Brazilian lover, Lota de Macedo Soares, with whom she lived for most of her time in the country (Millier 1993, 449; Martins 2006, 35).\n\nWorld literature—taken here as a perspective concerned with the literary relationship between writers who work in languages or traditions that seem widely separated—brings to light further layers of complexity in “Crusoe in England.” This angle of vision directs our attention to Bishop’s enduring engagement with Brazilian Modernism. It enables us to recover not only her dialogue with the poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade (1902–1987) but, more interestingly, the importance of this literary relationship for the composition of “Crusoe in England.” Bishop translated an early and influential poem by Drummond, “Infância” (Childhood), which likewise relies on an allusion to Robinson Crusoe. By reading her “Crusoe in England” together with Drummond’s “Infância” and one of the later prose pieces by the Brazilian writer, this chapter explores the complex irony of Bishop’s poem, but also the divergent ways in which the two writers rework Defoe’s novel. The discussion of Bishop’s relationship to Drummond raises the problem of the ways in which current conceptualizations of world literature may both help and hinder its apprehension.\n\nThis chapter regards world literature as a perspective, instead of seeking to grasp it positively and systematically. It argues that the point of view of world literature is especially productive when it makes us aware of how much we don’t know, so as to bring to light new problems for comparative literary scholarship. Drummond’s work remains, even now, largely unfamiliar to an English-language audience; as a result, Bishop’s nuanced, complex, and fruitful engagement with his poetry easily escapes notice. Yet all the information needed to establish the links between the two poets is widely available in Bishop’s Complete Poems. Such a pattern of selective invisibility is all too familiar to scholars who work in the American academy with literary languages that appear to be of lesser prestige, or that are, in any case, less commonly taught.\n\nThe overall shape of the argument in this chapter is inferential. It begins by exploring the relationship that Bishop establishes to Drummond (which includes at least one thought-provoking omission), and proceeds to examine some of the systematic accounts of world literature that have been proposed in recent years. Pascale Casanova has stressed the constitutive role that inequalities of prestige play in the modern literary world; David Damrosch has proposed that we understand world literature as a detached and active mode of reading across diverse languages and cultures; Alexander Beecroft has identified six complex systems of literary circulation, relying on ecology as a metaphor, while Walter Cohen has offered a broad historical narrative grounded on the varying relationship between literary language and spoken languages. The hidden-in-plain-sight character of Bishop’s relationship to Drummond provides the starting point for the discussion of these critical constructions. As we will see, these accounts all prove helpful in exploring Bishop’s relationship to Drummond, but only up to a point. More often than not, they also work to obscure the relationship between the two poets, either through an explicit emphasis on the structuring power of the major literary languages, or through a tacit bias for translations into English.\n\nThe shift in approach that I am suggesting—to take world literature as a perspective for inquiry rather than to propose a model for world literature—is inspired by the work of historical social scientists concerned with world systems studies. Immanuel Wallerstein has consistently argued that world-systems analysis is a perspective rather than a theory (Wallerstein 1976, 345). In a tightly argued methodological essay, Terence Hopkins has examined the implications of the “angle of vision” of the modern world-system for the ways that social scientists select problems and construct explanations. It seems pertinent to specify here that for Wallerstein and Hopkins the world system is the singular, historically specific “complex of spatio-temporal processes” encompassing the social relations of capitalism (Hopkins 1978, 212).\n\nIn contrast to the approach of the historical social scientists mentioned above, my argument does not go as far as to suggest a shape, however provisional, for the literary relations that constitute world literature. Rather, this approach at once recognizes the structuring power of the major literary languages and works punctually against it. It looks for the points of convergence that allow us to see through the prestige of the major languages in order to explore their relationship to traditions and texts that at first seem quite remote. In our example, “Crusoe in England” serves as one such vantage point, by affording a perspective that enables us to retrace Bishop’s relationship to Drummond, and to Brazilian Modernism more generally.\n\nThe inferential structure of my argument is indebted to an essay on historical method by Carlo Ginzburg, “Clues: Roots of an Evidential Paradigm.” Ginzburg argues for the importance of the “conjectural or semiotic paradigm,” contrasting it to the ambitions of “systematic thought.” Although a complex structure “such as fully developed capitalism” is obscured by “ideological clouds” and may seem inaccessible, Ginzburg maintains that “there are privileged zones—signs, clues—which allow us to penetrate” its apparent opacity (Ginzburg 1992, 123). Bishop’s “Crusoe in England” serves here as one such clue, helping dissolve some of the clouds that obscure the reach of world literary relationships.\n\nThis chapter will consider a variety of texts to explore Bishop’s engagement with Carlos Drummond de Andrade. It will start with a discussion of her interviews, and proceed to consider texts that are increasingly closer to Bishop’s poetic practice: her translations and, finally, the poem “Crusoe in England.” Bishop’s interviews in the period when she was working on her translations betray significant gaps in her knowledge of the material; beyond that, her comments at times betray an impatient tone, somewhere between defensiveness and condescension, which has long proved disconcerting to readers familiar with Brazilian poetry. However, we will see that the closer the focus of discussion moves to Bishop’s practice as a poet, the more the relationship that she establishes to Drummond’s work appears characterized by complexity, insight, and acceptance.\n\nI\n\nBishop’s interviews from the mid-sixties are revealing about the poet herself, her background, standards, and preferences, but they do not offer much insight into the Brazilian poets that she was the translating at the time. Bishop betrays, instead, a surprising lack of familiarity with Brazilian Modernismo, an innovative vanguard movement that began in the 1920 and succeeded in changing the literary norms in the country.1 Her interview with Ashley Brown for Shenandoah in 1966 is a case in point.2 (Reproduced in Bishop 1996 Conversations.) It appeared shortly before Questions of Travel was published and ten years before “Crusoe in England” came to be included in Geography III.\n\nBrown led Bishop to reflect on her career and its contexts from the 1930s on; he repeatedly asked about the importance that Brazil, Brazilian literature, and the Portuguese language had for her. The question of whether she could “draw on the social and literary traditions” of Brazil receives a long and meandering answer. But Bishop concludes with a firm denial.\n\nTo summarize: I just happened to come here, and I am influenced by Brazil certainly, but I am a completely American poet, nevertheless. (Bishop 1996 Conversations, 19)\n\nThe standard against which Bishop measures Brazilian poetry is provided by poetry in English: “Our poetry went off in a different direction much earlier.” This claim elicits a follow-up question from Ashley Brown.\n\nInterviewer: When you say our poetry went in a different direction, what do you mean?\n\nMiss Bishop: What happened to Eliot and Pound as early as 1910—modernism. The Brazilians’ poetry is still more formal than ours—it’s farther from the demotic. It’s true, of course, that they had a modernismo movement in 1922, led by Mario de Andrade and others. But they still don’t write the way they speak. And I suppose that they have still never escaped from romanticism. (Bishop 1996 Conversations, 19)\n\nThis answer apparently assumes a normal course for the development of poetry. Bishop’s insistent repetition of the adverb “still”—three times in a short answer—suggests that Brazilian poetry had not quite reached the same level of development as American poetry. The reference to Brazilian Modernism is cursory and offered nearly like a concession. It is difficult to tell if Bishop is familiar with the names of any Modernist writers besides Mário de Andrade, or if she has read them. (It is also disconcerting to note that Bishop implies that Eliot and Pound “write the way they speak.”)\n\nBishop’s denials persist when she is asked about her relationship as a poet to Portuguese: “I don’t read it habitually—just newspapers and some books.” Bishop’s incomprehension is especially clear when she attempts to describe Brazilian Portuguese as a poetic language.\n\nFrom our point of view, it seems cumbersome—you just can’t use colloquial speech in that way. Grammatically, it is a very difficult language. Even well educated Brazilians worry about writing their own language; they don’t speak their grammar, as it were. I imagine it’s easier to write free verse in Portuguese—because it gets you away from the problem. They did take to free verse very quickly here. (Bishop 1996 Conversations, 20)\n\nIt is difficult to fit these remarks into a single, coherent picture. If Bishop considers the colloquial register “cumbersome”—perhaps ineffective or perhaps inappropriate—then why does she also claim that Brazilian poetry has remained “more formal than ours” and has “never escaped from romanticism”? Her comments sound impatient and nearly dismissive, particularly when the poet remarks that free verse is likely “easier to write in Portuguese.” Here, and throughout the interview, Bishop focuses on what she expected to find but didn’t; she does not seek to understand, on its own terms, the work of Brazilian poets. Not only are her views consistent with a “completely American” perspective; often enough they appear to shade into uncomprehending judgment.\n\nBishop’s comments about colloquial speech are particularly disconcerting to a reader familiar with Brazilian Modernist poetry. We find this surprise articulated by Paulo Henriques Britto, a critic and poet, but also the authoritative editor and translator of Bishop’s poetry and prose for a Brazilian audience. Britto discusses Bishop’s interview with Brown in the introductory essay for Poemas do Brasil, an anthology of her poetry that he edited and translated. Britto stresses his surprise that Bishop, who is a reader and translator of Carlos Drummond de Andrade and João Cabral de Mello Neto, could form the opinion that colloquial Portuguese is incompatible with formal poetic structures (Bishop Conversations 1996, 20; Bishop O Iceberg 2001, 42). The writers that Britto mentions, Drummond and Cabral, are recognized as some of the most important poets of the twentieth century, indebted both to Brazilian Modernism. As Britto suggests, they are admired for their use of the colloquial register in texts that quite often—though by no means always—adhere to the verse conventions of the Portuguese tradition.\n\nHistorians of Brazilian literature have long called attention to the interest of Modernist writers in the colloquial register. In their influential anthology Presença da literatura brasileira, Antonio Candido and J. Aderaldo Castello discuss the Modernists’ experimentation with the colloquial and its importance for their ambitious project to change what was acceptable in literary language.\n\nFrom a stylistic point of view, [the Modernists] advocated the rejection of [European] Portuguese norms, searching for a more colloquial form of expression, closer to the Brazilian way of speaking. (Candido 1968, 10)\n\nSuch experiments were pursued by a number of diverse writers over a fairly long period; the process was not linear, neither were all the attempts successful. Some early Modernist writers sought to draw from the varieties of oral language spoken all through the territory of Brazil and in the event produced work that was, and remains, nearly impenetrable; several writers managed only uneasy compromises between the nineteenth-century norms for cultivated written language and Brazilian idiom. Carlos Drummond de Andrade is one of a small number who succeeded in creating new ways of writing that are clear, articulate, and subtle, yet do not appear artificial or pretentious to a Brazilian readership. As a result of these efforts, which started nearly 100 years ago, Brazilians can now work with a written language that is closer to the speech and syntactical patterns of the Portuguese spoken in their country. Probably because Bishop was never quite comfortable with Portuguese, and specifically not with everyday spoken Brazilian Portuguese, in this interview she appears unable to grasp or do justice to the achievements of her contemporaries in Brazil, the Modernist writers who reshaped literary language through their work, among other things, with the colloquial register.\n\nII\n\nNeither Bishop’s opinions nor her tone suggest that she worked tirelessly, and for years to make Brazilian poetry and literature better known in the United States, or that the conversation with Brown is itself a part of the effort. Bishop approaches her work as translator above all as a poet: she translates texts that have some affinity with her own poetic concerns, while the diction and voice of the translations are recognizably her own. She effectively reinterprets Brazilian Modernism in the terms of her own poetry. The poems and translations that result from this effort are remarkable and quite rewarding in their own right; they have no doubt achieved the goal of making Brazilian poetry better known to a more international audience.\n\nHowever, if we expand the focus of our attention beyond Bishop’s achievement in order to consider the relation of her translations to Brazilian Modernist poetry, a different picture takes shape. The language of Bishop’s translations is more standard in syntax and diction than that of Brazilian poets. Her translations draw attention away from the more polemical and vanguardist side of their work. Only readers who know the material will see the way that Bishop’s translations modulate Brazilian Modernism; those who count simply on Bishop’s translations to approach this body poetry will be unable to appreciate either the risks that the writers took with literary language or their achievement in innovating it. Bishop’s translations of Drummond fall into a further, thought-provoking pattern. Drummond’s poetry of the 1940s and 1950s, and his prose as well, consistently reflect on the poet’s sympathy for the Soviet Union and his subsequent disillusionment. Bishop steers clear from the poems devoted to political themes. Such a choice cannot help but seem frustratingly partial to those who are familiar with Drummond’s overall trajectory. This section will focus on Bishop’s modulation of Drummond’s poetry as a translator, while the topic of what she failed to translate will come to the foreground later, in the discussion of Drummond’s treatment of the Crusoe motif in a later prose text.\n\nBishop’s earliest translations of Brazilian poetry were published in 1963, a few years before the 1966 interview with Ashley Brown. The interview follows the publication in the spring 1965 issue of the same journal, Shenandoah, of selections of Brazilian poetry and prose translated by Bishop, Brown, and Helen Cauldwell. Bishop contributed to this issue translations of two poems by Carlos Drummond de Andrade, “Seven-Sided Poem” and “Don’t Kill Yourself.” Nearly ten years later, in 1972, she succeeded in publishing through Wesleyan University Press a bilingual anthology of twentieth-century Brazilian poetry, which included many of her own translations together with translations by other well-known poets. In the intervening years, Bishop steadily published translations of Brazilian poetry, in journals such as Shenandoah and The Kenyon Review, but very often also in mass circulation periodicals like the New Yorker, The New Republic, the New York Review of Books, and even the New York Times Magazine (MacMahon 1980). These translations, along with translations from several other languages, are included in the edition of her Complete Poems, a sign that Bishop considers her work as a literary translator integral to her own poetry.\n\nThe context of Bishop’s Complete Poems brings to light suggestive affinities between her poetry and the translations from the Portuguese. Themes that concern Bishop recur in the translations. Drummond’s “The Table,” “Family Portrait,” and “Infancy” are explorations of family and loss, as are the two poems by Joaquim Cardozo, “Cemetery of Childhood” and “Elegy for Maria Alves,” while the certainty of loss lies in the background of Manuel Bandeira’s “My Last Poem.” There is an evident affinity between Bishop’s “The Burglar of Babylon” and “The Death and Life of a Severino,” an excerpt from João Cabral de Melo Neto’s verse narrative of rural migration during a severe drought. Cabral’s poem is composed in a meter that is at once very old and characteristic of popular poetry, the redondilha maior (or the seven-syllable line). This prosodic choice seems analogous to Bishop’s use of the ballad form in “Burglar.” Her cruelly descriptive poems about poverty in Brazil find echoes both in Cabral’s work and in Manuel Bandeira’s prose poem, “Brazilian Tragedy.” The irreverent, often unsettling humor of the Brazilian Modernists seems continuous at times with Bishop’s own sense of the absurd. A case in point is “In the Middle of the Road,” her translation of Drummond’s sarcastic avant-garde improvisation on the opening line of Dante’s Inferno, which the Brazilian poet unceremoniously combines with language from a Parnassian, quite formal sonnet by the Brazilian Olavo Bilac, “Nel mezzo del camin.” Rendered in Bishop’s precise diction and spare, elegant language, these translations of Brazilian Modernist poets read very well in English.\n\nNevertheless, scholars of Brazilian literature have fairly often expressed reservations about Bishop’s translations. Paulo Henriques Britto, for instance, notes that the quality of her translations “is in general not what we would expect from such a remarkable poet” (Bishop 1999, 39). In part—but only in part—such reservations are the inevitable result of the movement of the texts from one context to another—from Brazilian Modernism to Bishop’s “completely American” poetry. Her translation of Drummond’s “Infância,” a poem directly relevant for the discussion of “Crusoe in England,” helps illustrate this point. Drummond’s “Infância” holds considerable authority in Brazil. It is the second poem of his earliest collection, Alguma poesia (Some Poetry, 1930), which is a landmark of the Brazilian Modernist movement. The poem announces themes that were to occupy him all through his career, such as his family and their past as traditional, wealthy landowners in the rural region of Minas Gerais. Beyond that, the poem has been discussed by numerous influential critics since it was first published. Bishop’s translation cannot help but extract this text from a dense literary, critical, and broadly cultural network, where it occupies a central position, in order to introduce it into a wholly new context, where it will be largely unknown. Itamar Ben-Zohar’s discussion of the hierarchical relations in the literary polysystem sheds light on the varying levels of prestige held by Drummond’s poem and its translation by Bishop: while “Infância” is “central” to Brazilian Modernism, Bishop’s “Infancy” remains “peripheral” to American poetry (Even-Zohar 2012, 193). In such circumstances, any discrepancy between Bishop’s translation and the source text will likely be taken as a disproportionate loss by those who are familiar with Drummond’s poetry and have long admired it.\n\nYet Bishop’s translation of “Infância” has been criticized quite pointedly, in ways that go beyond such general uneasiness (Burns 2002). Tom Burns notes two significant discrepancies, one lexical and the other syntactical, between “Infância” and its translation by Bishop. The first discrepancy lies in the title. A more recent translation by Richard Zenith renders it more accurately as “Childhood,” instead of “Infancy”3 (Andrade 2015, 7). The second, syntactical discrepancy deserves to be examined closely, since it calls attention to some ways in which the translation softens the most experimental aspects of the poem.\n\nThe speaker of Drummond’s “Infância” recalls the experience of reading Robinson Crusoe as a boy, in his family home, not far from his mother and infant brother. The simplicity of the style imitates a child’s language and helps establish the boy’s perspective. A series of simple sentences and a few nominal ones, joined together by parataxis, suffice to describe the domestic scene. Drummond’s reliance on parataxis also exemplifies the Modernists’ experimentation with literary language: It is a fair illustration of their effort to move away from nineteenth-century rhetorical conventions, which relied heavily on hypotaxis. Bishop’s translation takes away some of the edge of the poem by moving it away from parataxis.\n\nThis claim may be illustrated by considering Drummond’s poem together with Bishop’s and Zenith’s translations.\n\nInfancia\n\nby Carlos Drummond de Andrade\n\nMeu pai montava a cavalo, ia para o campo.\n\nMinha mãe ficava sentada cosendo.\n\nMeu irmão pequeno dormia.\n\nEu sozinho menino entre mangueiras\n\nlia a história de Robinson Crusoé, 5\n\ncomprida história que não acaba mais.\n\nNo meio-dia branco de luz uma voz que aprendeu\n\na ninar nos longes da senzala—e nunca se esqueceu\n\nchamava para o café.\n\nCafé preto que nem a preta velha 10\n\ncafé gostoso\n\ncafé bom.\n\nMinha mãe ficava sentada cosendo\n\nolhando para mim:\n\n—Psiu … não acorde o menino. 15\n\nPara o berço onde pousou um mosquito.\n\nE dava um suspiro … que fundo!\n\nLá longe meu pai campeava\n\nno mato sem fim da fazenda.\n\nE eu não sabia que minha história 20\n\nera mais bonita que a de Robinson Crusoe.\n\nInfancy\n\ntranslated by Elizabeth Bishop\n\nMy father got on his horse and went to the field.\n\nMy mother stayed sitting and sewing.\n\nMy little brother slept.\n\nA small boy alone under the mango trees,\n\nI read the story of Robinson Crusoe, 5\n\nthe long story that never comes to an end.\n\nAt noon, white with light, a voice that had learned\n\nlullabies long ago in the slave quarters—and never forgot—\n\ncalled us for coffee.\n\nCoffee blacker than the black old woman 10\n\ndelicious coffee\n\ngood coffee.\n\nMy mother stayed sitting and sewing\n\nwatching me:\n\nSh—don’t wake the boy. 15\n\nShe stopped the cradle when a mosquito had lit\n\nand gave a sigh … how deep!\n\nAway off there my father went riding\n\nthrough the farm’s endless wastes.\n\nAnd I didn’t know that my story 20\n\nwas prettier than that of Robinson Crusoe.\n\n(Bishop 1974, 86)\n\nCHILDHOOD\n\ntranslation by Richard Zenith\n\nMy father rode off on his horse to the fields.\n\nMy mother sat in a chair and sewed.\n\nMy little brother slept.\n\nAnd I, on my own among mango trees,\n\nread the story of Robinson Crusoe. 5\n\nA long story that never ends.\n\nIn the white light of noon, a voice that learned lullabies\n\nin shanties from the slave days and never forgot them\n\ncalled us for coffee.\n\nCoffee as black as the old black maid, 10\n\npungent coffee,\n\ngood coffee.\n\nMy mother, still sitting there sewing,\n\nlooked at me:\n\n“Shhh … don’t wake the baby.” 15\n\nThen at the cradle where a mosquito had landed.\n\nShe uttered a sigh … how deep!\n\nFar away my father was riding\n\nin the ranch’s endless pastures.\n\nAnd I didn’t know that my story 20\n\nwas more beautiful than Robinson Crusoe’s.\n\n(Andrade 2015, 7)\n\nIt is worth remarking on the poem’s diction at the start, however briefly. For a reader familiar with idiomatic Brazilian Portuguese, the preference of the Modernists for colloquial language is evident on line 10: “Café preto que nem a preta velha” (Coffee as black as the old black maid). The poet uses the informal and familiar phrase que nem (“as,” in Zenith’s translation). This phrase has the same meaning as the standard conjunction como, yet it is not, even now, acceptable in Brazil’s standard written language; it does work well in this poem, however, because the expression is characteristic of a child’s speech and helps characterize Drummond’s speaker.\n\nThe syntactical discrepancy that Burns notes occurs on line 16, when Bishop’s translation transforms a nominal sentence into a complete one. She translates para, a preposition equivalent to “to,” as if it were a verb form, the past tense of the verb parar (to stop). A literal translation of line 16, “Para o berço onde pousou o mosquito,” reads, “To the cradle where the mosquito has touched down,” yet Bishop translates, “She stopped the cradle where a mosquito has lit.” The translator silently normalizes Drummond’s syntax, by introducing a verb that is absent from the source text. We cannot rule out that Bishop simply decided to correct a line that seemed too much like a sentence fragment. At the same time, perhaps a translation that remained closer to Drummond’s text would not work well in a poem in English. Zenith finds a roundabout solution to the problem. By relying on parallelism, his translation calls attention to an implicit verb, look at, without directly using it: “Then [looked] at the cradle where a mosquito had landed.”\n\nThe implications of Bishop’s normalizing translation deserve to be explored. Bishop’s text does not afford English readers an insight into Drummond’s linguistic experimentation, or into his achievements either—for instance, when the poet brings an extremely colloquial phrase such as que nem into the poem without a distracting effect. On the other hand, Bishop’s translation reads well. It is fluent. Lawrence Venuti has questioned the value placed on fluency in translation, arguing that this linguistic effect is implicated in concealing the work of the translator, rendering her invisible. In the terms of Venutti’s argument, Bishop may be seen as a domesticating translator, who chooses to smooth out Drummond’s poetry in order to make it more accessible to an audience in the United States.\n\nHowever, although Bishop may seem invisible as a translator, she is remarkably visible as a poet. Her translation is consistent, above all, with the more standard and neutral register of Bishop’s own poetry. As Justin Read has suggested, translation, or mistranslation, serves “as the means through which Bishop asserts her own personality” (Read 2003, 318). At this point of the discussion, her translation of “Infância” affords a retrospective insight into the opinions Bishop voiced in her 1966 interview with Ashley Brown. The comment that Brazilian critics have found so objectionable—“you just can’t use colloquial speech in that way”—may be understood more as an expression of the translator’s frustration than as a clear-cut judgment on Brazilian poetry. Her remark points to a significant problem that Bishop must have encountered as a translator. It must have been a considerable challenge to translate the use of the colloquial register by Brazilian Modernists and at the same time write poems that would read well in the context of Bishop’s own poetry or, more generally, in the context of the work of an American poet of her generation and background.\n\nIn her translation of Drummond’s “Infância,” Bishop at once explores a theme that is important to her own work and confronts the challenge that the distinctive traits of Brazilian Modernism pose to her style. Although “Infancy” is a resonant text in the context of her poetry, when we consider the relation between the translation and Drummond’s poem, it becomes clear that Bishop modulates his text by bringing it closer to the standard register that prevails in her own work. Even if this process of reelaboration seems characteristic of the way a poet would approach the work of translating another, Bishop effectively softens the vanguardist edge that Drummond’s poem has in Portuguese.4\n\nThis discussion has followed a double pattern: at the same time as it recognizes Bishop’s achievement as a translator, it calls attention to the nuanced, not altogether accepting relationship that her translation establishes to Drummond’s source poem in Portuguese. The category of world literature is especially helpful, I suggest, when it leads us to search for perspectives that bring into focus the complexity of literary relationships such as the one Bishop sustains with Drummond. As we will see, although the two poets seem widely separated in terms of language and literary tradition, Bishop’s approach to Drummond’s poetry proved especially fruitful for the composition of “Crusoe in England.”\n\nIII\n\nIn this farewell poem to Brazil, Bishop again engages with Drummond’s work and adapts it to her own purposes. “Crusoe in England” evokes an image of Brazil by taking up a motif that has a similar resonance in Drummond’s work—Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe—yet develops the allusion in a different direction. Drummond sidesteps the novel’s colonial outlook. Bishop meanwhile voices the prejudice and violence of colonialism through the speaker, even as her dramatic monologue draws attention, through irony, to the limits of Crusoe’s perspective. Bishop further relies on this poetic form to integrate the colloquial register into the poem: she takes up a distinctive poetic strategy of Brazilian Modernism and contains it at the same time, treating the colloquial as no more than an element in the characterization of the speaker. Here, Bishop enacts a dialogue that recognizes the originality of Brazilian poets and at the same time marks the distance between her work and theirs. This chapter argues that, from the point of view of a discussion of “Crusoe in England,” the perspective of world literature again helps bring into focus the complex ways in which Bishop’s poetry engages with Drummond’s.\n\nThis argument builds on Maria Lúcia Milléo Martins’s discussion of “Infância” and “Crusoe in England,” in her groundbreaking comparative work, Duas Artes. Martins has argued that both Drummond and Bishop rely on the figure of the island to establish lyric subjectivity and at the same time explore the poet’s relationship to a wider world. In the background of her analysis lies an influential reading of Drummond’s “Infância” by Silviano Santiago, who sees in this early poem a key moment in the constitution of the poet’s subjectivity.\n\nWe see Bishop’s relationship to Drummond from a new angle, I suggest, if we consider the ways that each of the two poets reworks Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe’s adventures unfold in the historically recognizable world of European expansion. Through their allusions, the two poets evoke the area and period in which the novel develops, together with its outlook and morals, but also its characters, with their motivations and beliefs. More specifically, Drummond’s and Bishop’s references betray a parallel concern with a space that plays an important role in the novel, even though it is less in evidence than the desert island—“the Brasils.”\n\nThe allusion to Brazil is more evident in Bishop’s poem. Her dramatic monologue is set in the period when Crusoe, his travels and adventures over, is back in England, living in comfort. A reader of the novel will recall that the character’s affluence is the direct result of his long-term business dealings in Brazil. Although neither Bishop nor Drummond mentions it directly, all the while that Crusoe had been living in his desert island, he had been the owner of a profitable “Plantation in the Brasils.” However, he finds himself penniless when he returns to England: there is “nothing to relieve, or assist” him, because Robinson had been “long given over for dead,” and his family had made “no Provision” for him (Defoe 1994, 201). The closing pages of the novel are devoted to his efforts to remedy the unhappy situation. These passages give a detailed account of the voyages, transactions, and legal measures that allowed Crusoe not only to recover the profit that his sugar plantation had made while he was away, but also eventually to sell the entire property in land and, that goes without saying, slaves. By focusing on this final moment of Crusoe’s trajectory, Bishop ironically places her speaker in the position of the colonizer who has made his fortune from the commercial exploitation, specifically, of a slave plantation in Brazil. As Bishop once stressed in an interview, Crusoe was “really awful” (Bishop 1996, 88).\n\nIn Drummond’s “Infância” the allusion to Robinson Crusoe likewise evokes the background image of a large rural estate in Brazil, but from a contrasting perspective. It will be clear to a Brazilian reader that the quiet domestic scene that the poet describes takes place in a country property. Short though the poem is, it paints a vivid picture of the social, gender, and racial hierarchies in the young reader’s family. The father owns the horse that he rides out on and implicitly the land as well; it is a workday routine for him to visit his property on horseback. The mother is tied to the space of the home in a way that the father is not, and something must be weighing on her, or she wouldn’t be sighing so deeply. The picture of a family from the traditional Brazilian elite is completed by the affectionate and markedly racialized language describing the old black woman, the preta velha, who had once lived nos longes da senzala, or in the faraway slave quarters.\n\nIn contrast to Bishop, Drummond strives to depict Brazilian landowners in the perspective of family intimacy, exploring conflicts and bonds from the inside. Not only do the closing lines of “Infância” affirm his claim to poetic voice; they announce a theme that will prove of central importance to Drummond’s poetry as a whole. Those who are familiar with his work will recognize the theme of the patriarchal family of the traditional Brazilian elite, which will concern Drummond throughout his career: “I didn’t know that my story / was more beautiful than Crusoe’s.” A seminal essay by Antonio Candido has explored in detail the poet’s conflicted treatment of “the extraordinary power of the family group,” and in particular his depiction of the “devouring patriarch” (Candido 1995, 144; see also Coelho 1973).\n\nNeither Crusoe’s colonial outlook nor the prejudices of its protagonist are relevant to the way “Infância” reworks the intertext. Drummond establishes, instead, a competitive relationship directly with the author, Defoe, by asserting that the história he has to tell is mais bonita than Crusoe’s, literally “more beautiful,” but with a wider positive connotation—more attractive, more interesting, better. The poet neatly sets aside here the exoticism that is so prevalent in the novel. Yet the line resonates further still, since the história that the poet claims as his own is at once a “story” and “history.” Drummond implicitly calls here for a history constructed from a different, mais bonita, and perhaps better perspective than Defoe’s.5\n\nElizabeth Bishop, in contrast, has the protagonist of Defoe’s novel serve the crucial function of speaker in her dramatic monologue. Unlike Drummond, whose speaker is firmly rooted in traditional Brazilian society, Bishop imagines a traveler who belongs neither in the island nor in the estates he owned, and implicitly not even in England. By focusing attention on Crusoe’s prejudices and colonial background, this approach opens the way for much of the poem’s irony.\n\nHelen Vendler’s comments on a recurrent structure in Bishop’s poetry offers a productive perspective for retracing the irony of “Crusoe in England.” Vendler notes that a “compelled dark triad” repeatedly brings together the exotic, the fantastic, and death in Bishop’s poetry. In “Crusoe in England,” this complex is given “full imaginative play” twice. The first instance is an actual death scene. “Crusoe’s hands fantastically ‘dye’ a baby goat bright red” with the result that his mother no longer recognizes him and, Vendler infers, the “undernourished” baby goat dies. The other death scene is a dream in which Crusoe kills a human baby, after mistaking it for a baby goat (Vendler 2002, 31). Defoe’s novel, for its part, insistently pairs two out of the three elements in Bishop’s triad, the exotic and death. By bringing the fantastic in as a third element, Bishop alters the relationship between the other two terms, opening up a wide and unsettling perspective on the intertext.\n\nThe close relationship between the exotic and death is very evident in the passages of Robinson Crusoe that describe the protagonist’s obsessive dreams of killing “Canibals” and “Savages.” Before Friday appears, Crusoe has a series of near and increasingly closer encounters with indigenous people: he sees a footprint in the sand, then he finds the remains of a fire, together with “Skulls, Hands, Feet, and other Bones of humane Bodies”; finally, he observes cannibalism from a distance, through a looking glass (Defoe 1994, 112–34). Each episode is followed by a long period of overwhelming fear—“Apprehension,” “Frights and Terror”—in which Crusoe finds himself in “the Murthering humor” and ceaselessly makes plans to “destroy some of these Monsters.” At night he dreams about it.\n\n[A]nd then [I] propos’d, that I would place myself in Ambush, in some convenient Place, with my three Guns, all double loaded; and in the middle of their bloody Ceremony, let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at ever shoot; and then following upon them with my three Pistols, and my Sword, I made no doubt, but that if there was twenty I should kill them all: This Fancy pleas’d my Thoughts for some Weeks, and I was so full of it, that I often dream’d of it; and sometimes that I was just going to let fly at them in my Sleep. (Defoe 1994, 122)\n\nThe exotic indigenous people appear here as “Canibals,” at the same time as the European, alone in the exotic island, responds to their presence with fantasies of murder. In this passage as in many others in the novel, murdering violence defines the characters of the stranded Englishman and the native inhabitants alike, and further frames their relationship.\n\nThe figure of the cannibal, nearly a commonplace of the discourse of European expansion into the Americas, takes shape in Defoe’s novel as a modulation of the exotic as murderous. Bishop’s retelling of Crusoe’s dream of murder is obscenely violent, yet very funny at the same time.\n\nBut then I’d dream of things\n\nlike slitting a baby’s throat, mistaking it\n\nfor a baby goat. I’d have\n\nnightmares of other islands (ll. 131–34)\n\nThe internal rhyme “throat/goat” is at once unexpected and obvious. It is hard not to laugh. Bishop brings to the foreground and undermines, all at the same time, the exoticism, violence, and colonial outlook of the Defoe intertext. My comments here find a parallel in Kim Fortuny’s argument about Bishop’s use of the techniques of comedy to mock “the colonial enterprise” in this poem (Fortuny 2003, 85).\n\nBishop’s ironic treatment of the character she borrows from Defoe is especially evident in the detailed descriptions of the island’s “flora,” “fauna,” and “geography” seen from his perspective. This lengthy passage takes up most of the eight initial stanzas of the poem; it reads like a parodic, nightmarish inventory of the motifs of tropical exoticism. The turtles and goats borrowed from Defoe’s novel recur insistently, and together with them an accumulation of motifs evoking the nature of the tropics: volcanoes, waves, clouds, rain, folds of lava, tree snails, gulls, water spouts. Fantastically, “sometimes the whole place hissed,” with large, heavy, grotesque turtles that sound “like teakettles.” By the end of this descriptive passage, immediately after Robinson recounts his murderous dream, the islands themselves appear multiplied and distorted, absurdly proliferating into infinity.\n\n[…] I’d have\n\nnightmares of other islands\n\nstretching away from mine, infinities\n\nof islands, islands spawning islands,\n\nlike frog eggs turning into polliwogs\n\nof islands […] (ll. 134–38)\n\nAlthough Crusoe stresses the strangeness of the scene from the beginning, his tone becomes increasingly impatient as the poem develops, until the lines just quoted, when he reaches the high point of a crescendo of exasperation. (The new stanza that begins after this passage breaks the pattern of multiplicative description and takes the poem into a different direction: “Just when I thought I couldn’t stand it / another minute longer, Friday came.”)\n\nThe absurdist tenor of Bishop’s portrayal of Crusoe’s island brings to mind a memorable passage on the strangeness of nature in Albert Camus’ “The Myth of Sisyphus.” At the start of his essay on the difficulty and joy of living in a world lacking the illusion of transcendent meaning, Camus explores “the feeling of absurdity.” One of his examples is the sudden, unexpected awareness that nature is dense and foreign to us—in a passage that reads nearly as if Bishop had glossed it in this poem: “these hills, the softness of the sky, the outline of these trees at this very minute lose the illusory meaning with which we had clothed them, henceforth more remote than a lost paradise” (Camus 1975, 14).\n\nThe reference to “The Myth of Sisyphus” is useful in calling attention to a theme that remains half-hidden in “Crusoe in England” but that offers, nonetheless, one of the keys to the construction of the poem: that of the meaning of Crusoe’s experience on the tropical island. Although the treatment of the exotic as absurd occupies the foreground and takes up most of the space, a few passages of Crusoe’s speech suggest that there was more to the time he spent on the island. In the first stanza, introducing his “un-rediscovered, unrenamable island,” Crusoe stresses that “none of the books has ever got it right.” The motif reappears later, when Crusoe moves beyond the description of the strange island to the recollection of his joyful life with Friday: “Accounts of that have everything all wrong.” Through the contrast between these brief asides and the lengthy descriptions of the island, the poem adds depth to Crusoe’s story, suggesting that something about the experience goes beyond what he is able to put into words, and further beyond the stories that the “books” and “accounts” have been able to tell.\n\nThe suggestion that all along there was more to what Crusoe could say reappears in the coda of the last two stanzas, in a passage that directly brings up the topic of the meaning of his experience. After an abrupt shift from Crusoe’s recollections to his present, the poem develops an image from Defoe’s novel, the knife that had been essential to the survival of the protagonist.\n\n[…] I’m old.\n\nI’m bored too, sipping my real tea,\n\nsurrounded by uninteresting lumber.\n\nThe knife there on the shelf—\n\nit reeked of meaning, like a crucifix.\n\nIt lived. How many years did I\n\nbeg it, implore it not to break?\n\nI knew each nick and scratch by heart,\n\nthe bluish blade, the broken tip,\n\nthe lines of wood-grain on the handle …\n\nNow it won’t look at me at all.\n\nThe living soul has dribbled away.\n\nMy eyes rest on it and pass on. (ll. 159–70)\n\nThe poem establishes here a series of overlapping contrasts: past and present; England and tropical island; old age and youth; on the one hand, uninteresting lumber, tea, and a knife “there on the shelf,” while on the other, a knife that had “reeked of meaning” and had had “a living soul.” The existential implications of Bishop’s enduring interest in travel come to the fore. Camus’ Sisyphus lets go of hope for the future and passionately struggles to live in “the present and the succession of presents” of the world (Camus 1975, 63). In contrast, Bishop’s Crusoe is quite bored by his static and uninteresting present in England, but has found meaning in the past, even if he and all others remain unable to articulate it.\n\nThe creation of this inarticulate speaker is key to the construction of “Crusoe in England”: this formal element enables the full play of the poem’s irony. By creating a Crusoe who is at once loquacious and massively uncomprehending, Bishop opens up new perspectives on the Defoe intertext. At the same time, the poem makes it clear that Crusoe’s perspective does not define him entirely. Bishop suggests the overwhelming depth of the speaker’s experience on the island and with Friday by contrasting his lengthy speech to some quiet, mostly brief asides that hint at what he cannot quite put into words. The overall effect of the poem hinges on a Crusoe whose speech betrays more than he realizes, but who at the same time remains unable to express or maybe even grasp the meaning of his time on the island.\n\nAccordingly, the voice of the speaker is informal throughout the poem, and often quite rough: Crusoe’s island is “a sort of cloud-dump”; the noise of goats, seagulls, and turtles, he remembers, “got on my nerves,” while “dreams were the worst.” Even as the informal language is consistent with Defoe’s character, in the light of Bishop’s engagement with Drummond another aspect of the speaker comes to the fore: the voice of the old Crusoe integrates the colloquial register into this poem. We may discern in Bishop’s adoption of this composition technique a poet’s homage to Drummond, perhaps even more generally to Brazilian Modernism as a whole. Nevertheless, despite her reliance on colloquial diction, “Crusoe in England” is a reserved and elegant poem; it is precise and polished, and all the more unsettling for that. The form of the dramatic monologue allows Bishop to take some distance from Drummond and keep the colloquial register contained thereby. Again in this instance, the poet reinterprets Drummond’s work in the terms of her own poetry.\n\nA fundamental contrast in the relationship that Drummond and Bishop establish to Defoe’s novel becomes clear as a result of this discussion. In “Crusoe in England,” Bishop retains the perspective of the colonizer even as she makes it the focus of the poem’s irony. In contrast, Drummond’s “Infância” is lightly and thoroughly dismissive of both Defoe’s story and the outlook of his protagonist.\n\nThis reading of “Crusoe in England” in the light of Bishop’s relationship to Drummond’s poetry offers, finally, some insights into the limits of the category of world literature. Bishop’s enduring and thoughtful engagement with Drummond’s work has largely escaped the attention of critics working in English. It is not difficult to grasp what motivates such a blank in scholarship. There is a language barrier to consider, first of all. Drummond writes in a language that is unfamiliar to students of Bishop’s works; in addition, only a portion of his poetry is available in translation in English or any other major European language. Beyond that, it seems necessary to call attention to the differences in literary prestige between English and Brazilian Portuguese. The significance of Drummond’s poetry for Bishop does not appear as self-evident to an English-language audience. In contrast, the same audience will easily identify and explore the links between Bishop’s poem and Defoe’s novel—even as it fails to see that Drummond mediates Bishop’s approach to Crusoe. The discussion of Bishop’s relationship to Drummond brings to light, at this point, an inequality of literary prestige that is constitutive of the field of world literature. It further shows the profound effect that disparities such as this may have in directing critical approaches to comparative analysis.\n\nIV\n\nIn the 1950s, Carlos Drummond de Andrade had a Sunday column in Correio da Manhã, one of the most important newspapers in Rio de Janeiro. By then, he had more than established his reputation as a poet; he was also recognized as an influential Left intellectual. Drummond generally published short prose pieces, or crônicas, in this Sunday column. This was the context of the initial publication of “Divagações sobre a ilha” (Digressions on the island), a text in which the poet describes himself as a pequeno Robinson moderno—a “little modern Robinson”—because of his escapist fantasy of living in an island. This crônica was later to become the opening piece of a prose anthology published in 1952; it also suggested the title for the collection, “Passeios na Ilha,” or Walking around the Island (Andrade 1952). This contextual information is useful to show that Drummond’s reworking of motifs from Robinson Crusoe circulated widely in Brazil in the 1950s; Bishop, who began living in Rio de Janeiro in 1951, is likely to have been familiar with this aspect of his work, and in particular with this text, which was quite well-known then and remains so even now.\n\nThe crônica “Divagações sobre a ilha” implicitly reflects on the poet’s conflicted relationship to Communism. Brazilians know well that during World War II Drummond was sympathetic to the Soviet Union: he wrote pro-Soviet poetry, publishing it at times in Communist-leaning journals, but at times also in mass circulation newspapers that varied in their political tendency. In 1945, he published a collection of poetry, A Rosa do Povo (The People’s Rose), in which he included poems on the war and political themes, together with several other topics. This book is widely taken to illustrate Drummond’s achievement in writing poetry that at once exemplifies political commitment and questions the project of committed literature (Simon 1978). In addition, the poet served on the editorial board of a Communist newspaper, Tribuna Popular (Popular Tribune), and regularly contributed to it (Segatto 1982, 77). However, Drummond soon stopped sending his work to this newspaper, and he broke with the Brazilian Communist Party in October 1945. Years later, in 1951, Drummond published another major collection of poetry, Claro Enigma (Clear Enigma), which has been widely interpreted as a reflection on political disillusionment (Camilo 2001).6\n\nThe prose collection that cites Defoe’s novel, Passeios na ilha (Walking around the Island), was published shortly after Claro enigma (1951). Brazilian critic Vagner Camilo has carefully reconstructed Drummond’s break with Communism and the attacks that the poet suffered from the Party in its aftermath. Camilo has argued that this context sheds light on the transformation in Drummond’s between the 1945 and the 1951 collections of poetry. For this critic, the Communist Party is the “evident addressee” of the crônica in which Drummond cites Crusoe, “Divagações sobre a ilha” (Digressions on the island). Camilo further shows that this prose text is key to understanding Drummond’s movement away from the poetics of commitment in the 1945 collection A rosa do povo and toward his “new attitude”—pessimistic and disillusioned—in the 1951 collection Claro enigma (Camilo 2001, 92–93).\n\n“Divagações sobre a ilha” is a brief, conversational, and digressive journalistic piece; it may be easily enjoyed as a piece of light Sunday reading. Yet the poet’s quarrel with the Communist Party is never far from the surface.7 The crônica revolves around the poet’s fantasy of one day buying an island. This conceit opens the way for Drummond to examine the claims for commitment made by those who “seek the center of action itself,” balancing them against the natural human tendency of appreciating “the grace of unaffected gestures, the cultivation of spontaneous forms, the pleasure of being one with animals, plant species, and atmospheric phenomena.” Drummond takes a good-humored distance from Defoe’s novel. By stressing that he does not want encounters with animals that challenge men’s “strength and fear,” he alludes to the mostly tame turtles, goats, and fowl of Crusoe’s island. At the same time, pointedly departing from Crusoe’s exclusively Christian reading habits, Drummond stresses that he will allow “neither the Bible nor vinyl” in his fantasy. He proceeds to stress that, despite Plato’s interdiction, poets are acceptable, but only so long as they “behave as if they were not poets.”\n\nThe polemic with Communism fully emerges in the closing paragraphs.\n\nThere comes a time when it’s best to escape, not so much from man’s malice, but from his incandescent kindness. Abstract kindness makes us merciless. And the thought of saving the world often leads to the most abundant—and needless—carnage. (Andrade 1952, 16)\n\nIn the paragraph that follows, the next to last, the poet briefly identifies himself with Robinson. He stresses that the price of an island is “relatively high” because it usually amounts to “disillusion.” He proceeds to mention, as if in passing, “the weight of attacks leveled” against the “little modern Robinson,” who has chosen to “take his distance from small quarrels” by dreaming of an island. At this point, contextual information is again helpful. Vagner Camilo has shown that Drummond was a “preferred target” of the communists in their attempts to demoralize, “in speech and in print,” the non-Stalinist Left (Camilo 2001, 70–73).\n\nDespite Bishop’s sustained engagement with Drummond’s poetry, the political resonance of his treatment of the Robinson motif, in this crônica at least, is remarkably absent from her work. Beyond that, working as a translator, Bishop sets aside a significant body of poetry in which Drummond reflects on commitment and its difficulties, on the War, and eventually on political disillusionment. If we were to judge from what Bishop filters out from Drummond’s work, it would be difficult to guess that the Brazilian poet had such a long and conflicted history with communism, that political engagement and the movement away from it play a crucial role in the development of his poetry, or that political themes are of crucial importance to the collections that include many of the pieces Bishop translated.\n\nBishop’s omissions may be understood from more than one point of view. Her choices as a translator make sense when they are considered in the perspective of her own poetry. Most of the poems that she translated rework themes that concern her as well, such as family and loss. At the same time, the overtly pro-Soviet poems that Drummond included in A rosa do povo are unlike anything Bishop could write. They are direct and referential; they tend to the prosaic and may seem formless.8 It is not difficult to see that a poet as understated, elliptical, and controlled as Bishop would not be interested in translating Drummond’s lengthy “Carta a Stalingrado” (Letter to Stalingrad), his “Telegrama de Moscou” (Wire from Moscow), or yet his “Mas Viveremos” (We’ll Live), an implicit reflection on the end of the Third International as Julio Castañon Guimarães has shown in the critical edition of his poetry he organized (Andrade 2012, 478).\n\nHowever, the fact that Bishop leaves Drummond’s fraught relationship to communism out of the picture deserves to be understood in historical terms as well. It will be helpful to call attention here to some internal evidence that suggests that Bishop was familiar with Drummond’s crônica on disillusionment: “Crusoe in England” briefly converges with some details of Drummond’s prose text. Whereas the Brazilian poet forbids the Bible on his island, Bishop also takes her distance from Defoe’s puritanical moralism by mocking the “miserable philosophy” that was “the smallest” of his “island’s industries.” Like Drummond, Bishop stresses that the animals of the island are tame. Despite such indirect allusions, Bishop sets aside in her poem any reference to the disillusionment with communism that informs Drummond’s desire to escape to an island. Bishop’s own position vis-à-vis communism must have played a part in this omission.\n\nWe find a broad characterization of Bishop’s political views at the beginning of Steven Gould Axelrod’s essay on the poet’s distinctive “textual anticipation of a queer politics.” Axelrod notes that Bishop participated in a liberal, “anti-Communist, pro-social justice” consensus, which was characteristic of mainstream American culture in the mid-twentieth century (Axelrod 2014, 36). Harris Feinsod has recently examined Bishop’s anticommunism in the context of her years in Brazil. Feinsod argues that Bishop engaged in an effort of “anti-communist cultural diplomacy” while she was in the country; in particular, he shows that Bishop sought and at times obtained support for her literary initiatives from the Congress for Cultural Freedom (Feinsod 2017). It seems disingenuous to claim that Bishop’s anticommunism did not play a role in her selective engagement with Drummond’s poetry, both as a translator and in the composition of “Crusoe in England.” Bishop’s omissions are consistent with the broader context of American Cold War anticommunism.\n\nV\n\nThe preceding exploration of Bishop’s engagement with Drummond’s work speaks in a variety of ways to current discussions of world literature. The point that compels attention, first and foremost, is that is very easy not to notice Bishop’s relationship to Drummond; this connection has remained largely “un-rediscovered, un-renamable,” much like the island in Bishop’s poem. The hidden-in-plain-sight character of the relationship by itself provides a useful angle of approach to both the perspectives that world literature affords and the thorny difficulties that it exposes as a category of literary scholarship. Bishop’s engagement with Drummond’s poetry developed over a fairly long period, at least from 1963, when she first published translations of his poetry, until 1976, when “Crusoe in England” appeared in the collection Geography III. The interviews in which Bishop discusses Brazilian poetry, her translations, and her own poetry, all help retrace an enduring and many-sided engagement. Yet these diverse texts do not necessarily add up to make a single, unequivocal picture. In her interviews, Bishop seems predominantly concerned with asserting her claim to remaining a “completely American poet.” In her translations Bishop mainly explores themes that are central to her own poetry, but at the same time she confronts the challenges posed by the linguistic experimentation of Brazilian Modernists. In “Crusoe in England,” finally, we see Bishop hold on to her distinctive style, concerns, and approach—and remain faithful to the character of a “completely American” poet—yet make room for the voice of the Brazilian poet, at least to some extent. Suggestively, in this poem Bishop relies heavily on the colloquial register, a poetic strategy that she had at first criticized. We have seen, then, the poet’s attitude to Drummond (and Brazilian Modernism) change from denial and defensiveness, in early interviews, to considered dialogue in “Crusoe in England.” Nevertheless, there is a point at which Bishop absolutely keeps her distance from Drummond: she neither engages with the poems that directly explore political themes nor acknowledges his pro-Soviet sympathies and subsequent disillusionment.\n\nA number of topics that are recurrent in systematic attempts to conceptualize world literature have come to the fore in the course of this discussion: the structuring power of the major literary languages, English in this case; the crucial role played by translators, like Bishop, as mediators between literary languages, and the perennial challenge posed by the diversity of the world’s languages, so many of which, like Portuguese, have never been fully integrated into a world literary system.\n\nPascale Casanova has approached these problems from the perspective of the sociology of literature. In her view, the hierarchical structure of modern world literature is defined by systemic imbalances of prestige. The power of literary institutions is highest at the center, while truly innovative writing is created in the periphery. The system remains dynamic thanks to the work of translators, who mediate between center and periphery and thereby open the way for writers of “dominated” languages to receive “consecration” at the center (Casanova 2004, 135). In the terms of Casanova’s argument, Bishop has played such a mediating role in relation to Drummond’s poetry, not just as a translator but as a poet as well. It seems necessary to stress, however, the extent to which consecration has proved elusive for the Brazilian poet. For all Bishop’s efforts, Drummond’s poetry has not as yet attained recognition in the circuit of world literature.\n\nWalter Cohen’s recent A History of European Literature considers the historically changing relationship between powerful literary languages and spoken languages in order to propose a model for the development of world literature. Taking as a model a literary system defined both by cross-cultural influence and by shared themes and forms, Cohen identifies five historical periods altogether, which span from the moment when literacy was invented five millennia ago up until the present. For Cohen, the most recent period, which starts after World War II and is marked by an unprecedented expansion of European literature, has resulted in the creation of a new “global literary system” through a process of “self-abolishing contradiction” (Cohen 2017, 7). The role of global English is not a given in this context. English may “eventually restrict access to other literary languages or even undermine them,” but it may also come to “function like earlier cosmopolitan languages, such as Sanskrit and Latin, or even French and Occitan, encouraging vernacular art.” Cohen calls for a commitment to work toward bringing about the second alternative (Cohen 2017, 493). The story of Bishop’s engagement with Drummond is consistent with the two possibilities Cohen outlines. Because of structural differences in the prestige of English and Brazilian Portuguese as literary languages, it is all too easy to overlook the relationship between the two poets. At the same time, the effort to call attention to Bishop’s engagement with Drummond may itself serve as a way to resist the homogenizing power of English. It is nevertheless difficult to be optimistic about the effectiveness of this attempt or others like it, such is the hegemonic power of English.\n\nAlexander Beecroft likewise calls attention to the importance of literary languages in making up the complex systems of circulation of literary texts. However, Beecroft proceeds to identify, in addition, five other operative “patterns of constraint”: politics, economics, religion, cultural politics, and technologies of distribution (27). Through their interaction, these six factors shape a series of successive and complex “literary biomes.” In Beecroft’s account, Bishop’s approximation to Drummond develops in the context of a worldwide system of competing national literatures. (Beecroft, unlike Cohen, places a global literary system in the hypothetical future.) This model is helpful, above all, in suggesting some reasons why the literary relationship between Bishop and Drummond has remained mostly invisible: each writer’s work circulates within a circumscribed national system; the circulation of Drummond’s poetry is certainly more restricted than Bishop’s.\n\nDavid Damrosch’s influential account of world literature, in contrast, does not bring linguistic diversity to the foreground as a problem for consideration. Rather than having a hierarchical or complex structure, for Damrosch world literature is constituted through acts of reading, when “several foreign works begin to resonate together in our mind” (298). Translation enables this dynamic process: not only does it make possible the international circulation of literary works; it exemplifies the detached mode of reading that characterizes world literature, independent from a specialist’s outlook or nationalist commitments. It seems necessary to note, however, that throughout his argument Damrosch implicitly has in mind translations into English. The opening chapter of What Is World Literature? clarifies his perspective.\n\nI will be concentrating predominantly (though not exclusively) on world literature as it has been construed over the past century in a specific cultural space, that of the formerly provincial and now metropolitan United States. (Damrosch 2003, 27)\n\nThese remarks follow closely on paragraphs that stress that “world literature itself is constituted very differently in different cultures” and illustrate this point with brief discussions of India and Brazil (Damrosch 2003, 26–27). Nevertheless, our discussion of Bishop and Drummond has shown that it is quite easy to lose sight of a major Brazilian poet. It does not seem likely that world literature, when constituted from the perspective of Brazil, should gain much traction internationally.\n\nAlthough most accounts of world literature stress the importance of translation, scholars committed to translation studies have expressed significant reservations about this category. Gayatri Spivak discerns in “U.S. style world literature” a project of disciplining, or reining in the languages of the Global South; she calls instead for an opening up to other languages, so that comparative literary scholarship may also flourish in other, different contexts as well (Spivak 2003, 39). This critique rests on Spivak’s understanding of translation as an ethical practice that requires the patient, always incomplete effort to learn more languages in order to establish a relationship at once responsible and intimate to cultural others. Nevertheless, Spivak’s philological commitments undercut such a utopian vision. Spivak stresses that she never teaches “anything whose original [she] cannot read” (Spivak 2000, 23). The necessary conclusion to this line of thought is that Spivak would teach Elizabeth Bishop but not Carlos Drummond de Andrade—with the inevitable result that the relationship between the two poets would escape consideration.\n\nEmily Apter, for her part, criticizes world literature as a liberal, “agglomerative rubric” that blunts “political critique.” These reservations are grounded in her understanding of translation as negotiation (Apter 2013, 40). Apter proposes that a focus on translation and its thorny difficulties—untranslatability, mistranslation, language conflict—will open the way for comparisons on a planetary scale that do not reproduce the logic of empire. In part, this approach sheds light on Bishop’s engagement with Drummond: the challenges that Bishop found in translating his poetry bring to light a sharp contrast between her project and that of the Brazilian Modernists. Nevertheless, the specifically political aspect of their relationship becomes clear only when we consider all that Bishop chose not to translate. The significant body of poetry in which Drummond explores his conflicted relationship to Communism—his approximation, his enduring reservations, and his eventual disillusionment—escapes consideration for as long as we keep our focus on what Bishop has in effect translated. Bishop’s omissions refer us, rather, to the historical context of the 1960s. They are best understood through ever-expanding circles of historical interpretation: her selections are consistent with Bishop’s anticommunist opinions; they make Drummond’s poetry more accessible to an American reading public that generally shares such an outlook; finally, they are consistent with the cultural policy, and more generally with the foreign policy of the United States toward Brazil, and Latin America as a whole.\n\nBy looking into Bishop’s approach to the poetry of Carlos Drummond de Andrade, this chapter has shown that the American poet engaged in a sustained, generous effort to establish an effective relationship to a tradition that must have been entirely unfamiliar to her—an enduring “effort of affection,” to borrow the title of her essay on Marianne Moore, but also that of Paulo Henriques Britto’s Portuguese translation of her selected prose (Bishop 1996). However, current accounts of world literature shed light on this relationship only in part; they partly obscure it as well, and at times work to exclude it from consideration altogether. The same is also true of current critiques of the category.\n\nIn order to bring Bishop’s relationship to Drummond into better focus, it has been necessary to move back and forth between English and Portuguese and the traditions of these languages. Such oscillations allow us to appreciate the way Bishop modulates Drummond’s poetry while she translates it, develops motifs shared with the Brazilian poet, and even brings his diction to some extent into her own work; at the same time they enable us to catch Bishop’s consequential omissions. This discussion has called attention to further literary connections. Each poet has established a distinctive relationship to a shared early modern intertext: while Bishop re-creates Robinson’s colonial outlook and ironically points out its limitations, Drummond dismisses the discourse of colonialism, laying claim to a historical perspective different from Defoe’s, and mais bonita.\n\nThe kind of triangulation pursued by this argument is akin to binocular vision: without it we are left only with flat images of the poets and lose sight of the depth and complexity of literary relationships. I’d like to suggest that the category of world literature is at its most productive when it leads us to search for such double, perhaps even multiple perspectives. This approach helps recover some of the information that, as Beecroft points out, is inevitably reduced out of the system. I hope that I have been able to show that the noise in the system is interesting, and may reward the effort to pay attention with new insights.\n\nNotes\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAlmeida, Sandra Regina Goulart, Glaucia Renate Gonçalves, and Eliana Lourenço de Lima Reis, eds. 2002.
