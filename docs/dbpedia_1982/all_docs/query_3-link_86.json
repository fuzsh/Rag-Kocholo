        "text": "‚ú® My Journey at Sopra Steria ‚ú® It‚Äôs 18h45 and I am leaving the office after my official #OnboardingDay If you never heard about Sopra Steria do not fear: it was my case a few months back. About the company: The group recently acquired Tobania and Ordina and positions itself as a pioneering company that stands at the forefront of the #digitaltransformation landscape. Known for its unwavering commitment to excellence, it is: üéä top 3 on the Belgian market üéä top 5 on the European market Specializing in cutting-edge solutions for businesses and #publicsector entities (the European Commission representing 1/4 of the clients) the company leverages its deep industry knowledge and technological acumen to drive transformative change. Operating in various sectors, including finance, health, defense, Sopra Steria empowers its clients to navigate the complexities of the digital era with confidence. From developing innovative software solutions to providing strategic consultancy services, the IT industry is instrumental in reshaping how businesses operate, and individuals experience the world. Today not only I did learn about all horizontals and verticals (the famous matrix üò¶), but I had a warm welcome from colleagues into a vibrant community of professionals. At the end of the onboarding, we were asked to pick a word to define the day and a value we cherish at the workplace: of course, mine was ‚Äúwarm welcome‚Äù and respect for others which I believe it is a fundamental in everyday life. I was also genuinely moved by the personal path life of some colleagues who trusted us enough to share their stories. Lesson learnt: you never know what people went through, so one additional reason to be thoughtful towards others and cultivate teamwork. Stay tuned as I delve deeper into the heart of my new responsibilities. Here‚Äôs to new beginnings and limitless possibilities! #SopraSteria #DigitalInnovation #GreatPlaceToWork #NewBeginnings üöÄ\n\nI started my first job on 21th Jan, 2008 with MytecSoft ‚Äî that made yesterday my 16th work anniversary‚Ä¶ When you move from one job to another, one project to another, all that goes on in your mind, is that you have to keep going, keep working. My career goal was to simply make the most of opportunities given to me, and to keep learning and growing incrementally. When you look back it feels like a lifetime‚Ä¶ A career span is made up of so many highs and lows, that it becomes difficult to pick out one or two‚Ä¶ Thus, it is an opportune time to thank every person who has supported me in the last 16 years, who has encouraged me and instilled faith in me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm grateful for the tremendous support from Leaders, readers and mentors, who kept me going every time I doubted myself‚Ä¶ And of course, not to forget family and friends ‚Äî without them none of it would have been possible. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll be doing in the coming years, but I‚Äôm happy where I am now‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs all that matters. The possibilities of a life and career are endless‚Ä¶we simply need to be open to exploring them‚Ä¶the rest usually falls into place! Team is the biggest success in career . Keep Learning Keep Growing. #sap #s4hana #abap #sapfico #saptechnical #saparchitect #accenture #accentureindia #sapfunctional\n\nIf you think that company or person is doing better then you, use that as fuel to skill-up to Triumph in your own right üÜôÔ∏è Lean into gratitude for what you have already accomplished, go the extra mile and congratulate others for their success üëèüèø Welcome in the confidence, that if this person has achieved it then so can I ‚ú®Ô∏è Always use that fuel to prove yourself right that you belong in that space, you can dominate the market and you are awesome at what you do üòé Personally, my fuel is looking at the likes of Oracle SAP ServiceNow to Accenture Capgemini Wipro and Infosys Consulting with the knowing my business will be as big and successful as them within the Recruitment and consulting space. What fuels you to compel you to Triumph?"
