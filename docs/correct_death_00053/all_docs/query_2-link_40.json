        "text": "So if the giant DEPRESSION and DEATH up above didn't give it away, this section isn't going to be an upper.\n\nIn 1957, Williams's play Orpheus Descending opened on Broadway. It was a critical and commercial flop, closing after only sixty-eight performances. Williams became deeply depressed and underwent psychoanalysis.\n\nWe hope he didn't consult his parents. We all remember how they handled mental illness.\n\nWell...all of us, except Rose.\n\nTwo more of Williams's plays soon flopped, but in 1961, The Night of the Iguana premiered and won Williams his third and final Tony Award. The play was his last critical success for a decade.\n\nDepression wasn't the only culprit in Williams's creative collapse. In the mid-1950s, he started using drugs and alcohol to deal with his constant anxiety.\n\nWe use ice cream and Netflix to deal with our anxiety, so...yeah, we're pretty hardcore, too.\n\nBy the early 1960s, his daily intake of substances had grown to staggering proportions. In any given day, Tennessee could knock back a fifth of liquor, two packs of cigarettes, and handfuls of pills.12\n\nBut could he binge Netflix for so long that the company sends a representative to check and see if he was okay?\n\nYeah. Didn't think so. Point, Shmoop.\n\nWilliams was also receiving care from Max Jacobsen, a.k.a. \"Dr. Feel Good.\" The New York City doctor was known for providing his well-to-do patients with prescriptions for vast quantities of mood-altering drugs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his license was revoked after patients died.\n\nShould've prescribed Netflix, Max.\n\nWilliams spoke openly about his dependency on barbiturates, saying that they unblocked his creativity. However, many biographers believe they blunted his creative spark.\n\nPerhaps the biggest blow came in 1963, when his partner, Frank Merlo, died of lung cancer. Grief-stricken, Williams fell into a depression that lasted for ten years. In 1969, he had a nervous breakdown and his brother Dakin had him committed to a mental hospital in St. Louis, where Williams stayed for three months.\n\nWhen asked about his decision, Dakin said, \"there were certain measures that had to be...dakin.\"\n\n...Fine, we'll stop making puns about Dakin.\n\nIn 1972, the play Small Craft Warnings opened off-Broadway and ran for a respectable two hundred performances. It was the last of Williams's professional successes. He wrote a string of critical stinkers, some of which closed after fewer than a dozen performances. Though he was hurt by the reviews at times, Williams refused to give up his craft. \"I'm very conscious of my decline in popularity, but I don't permit it to stop me because I have the example of so many playwrights before me. I know the dreadful notices Ibsen got,\" he told an interviewer. \"So I keep writing. I am sometimes pleased with what I do - for me, that's enough.\"13\n\nAnd so it was, until February 24th 1983, when Williams choked to death on a medicine bottle cap in his room at the Hotel Elys√©e in New York City. The 71-year-old was buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nUpon his death, Marlon Brando said, \"I always felt like Tennessee and I were compatriots. He told the truth as best he perceived it, and never turned away from things that beset or frightened him. We are all diminished by his death.\"14"
