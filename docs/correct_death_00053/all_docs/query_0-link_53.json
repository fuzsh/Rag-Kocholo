        "text": "Tennessee Williams was born Thomas Lanier Williams in Columbus, Mississippi in 1911. Williams' first essay, \"Can a Wife Be a Good Sport?\" was published in Smart Set magazine when he was only 16. Influenced by Anton Chekhov and Henrik Ibsen, Williams began writing plays. In 1935 his play Cairo! Shanghai! Bombay! was produced by the Memphis Garden Players. Several more of Williams' plays were produced in St. Louis the following year. In 1938 inspired by a newspaper article that described rioting and prisoner torture in a Philadelphia County prison, Williams wrote his fourth full-length play: Not About Nightingales. At the end of 1938 Williams moved to the French Quarter section of New Orleans. This would prove to be a decisive move in his literary career and, indeed, his life. In the Vieux Carre, a rooming house at 722 Toulouse Street, Williams' underwent a personal and artistic transformation from \"Tom\" to \"Tennessee,\" a change he would chronicle decades later in a play, Vieux Carre, first produced in 1977. After the 1940 opening of his Battle of Angels in Boston (later reworked as Orpheus Descending), Williams tried his hand in Hollywood writing a screenplay for Lana Turner. He returned to the theatre with The Glass Menagerie (1945) and A Streetcar Named Desire(1947), which was awarded, among others, the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Success followed upon success with Summer and Smoke (1948), The Rose Tattoo (1951), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955, Pulitzer Prize), Orpheus Descending (1957), Sweet Bird of Youth (1959) and Night of the Iguana (1961). Williams' place in the American theatre was evident as early as 1947, with the immense Broadway success of A Streetcar Named Desire. Having garnered two Pulitzer Prizes, four New York Critics Circle awards, the National Arts Club Medal of Honor for Literature and countless others, Williams died in 1983 at the age of 71, leaving behind living shadows of himself: characters with immortality that continue to entertain, enlighten and question. With the rediscovery and premiere of Tennessee Williams' unproduced 1938 play, Not About Nightingales, audiences and scholars gain a valuable new perspective into Williams' artistic development. Not About Nightingales received Tony, Outer Critics Circle Award and a Drama Desk Award nomination as Best Play for 1999."
