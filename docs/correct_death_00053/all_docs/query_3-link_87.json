        "text": "from The Gay & Lesbian Literary Heritage, ed. Claude J. Summers (New York: Henry Holt, 1995), which is the best references work on GLBT Literature. CAPITALIZED NAMES refer to related articles in the book.\n\nLike many Nineteenth Century writers who were celebrities as well as artists, particularly writers whose work is often autobiographical, Williams's life is almost as well known as his work. Born Thomas Lanier Williams in 1911, his mother was a prim minister's daughter, his father a tough shoe salesman who called his son \"Miss Nancy.\" In the autobiographical The Glass Menagerie (1945), Williams includes his father only as a smiling photograph on the wall, a case of artistic wishful thinking. Williams's deepest attachment was to his sister, Rose, institutionalized in the 1930s and lobotomized after accusing her father of sexual abuse. A published writer of fiction and poetry since he was a teenager, Williams studied writing at the University of Iowa and, after some initial failures, became the best known playwright of the 1940s and 1950s. The last twenty years of his life were spent trying to recapture the success of his early plays, but substance abuse and a loss of self and artistic control are evident in his later work. He died from choking on the cap of a medicine container.\n\nWilliams's gayness was an open secret he neither publicly confirmed nor denied until the post-Stonewall era when gay critics took him to task for not coming out, which he did in a series of public utterances, his Memoirs (1975), self-portraits in some of the later plays, and the novel, Moishe and the World of Reason (1975), all of which document, often pathetically, Williams's sense of himself as a gay man. There are several volumes of witty, confessional letters to friends DONALD WINDHAM and Maria St. Just and a raft of cynical, exploitative kiss-and-tell books by men who claimed to know Williams well in his later, declining years. However, anyone who had read his stories and poems, in which Williams could be more candid than he could be in works written for a Broadway audience, had ample evidence of his homosexuality.\n\nTennessee Williams's work poses fascinating problems for the gay reader. At his best, Williams wrote some of the greatest American plays, but though homosexuals are sometimes mentioned, they are dead, closeted safely in the exposition but never appearing on stage. In his post-Stonewall plays, in which openly homosexual characters appear, they serve only to dramatize Williams's negative feelings about his own homosexuality. In the 1940s and 1950s, Williams presented in his finest stories poetic renderings of homosexual desire, but homoeroticism was always linked to death. Only in his lyric poetry does one find positive expression of homoerotic desire.\n\nThese contradictions are not presented to damn Williams for not having a contemporary gay sensibility but to say that his attitude toward his own homosexuality reflected the era in which he lived. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the McCarthy era, during which Williams wrote his best work, homosexuality branded one a traitor as well as a \"degenerate.\" Williams's best work was an expression of his homosexuality combined with the intense neuroses that fueled his imagination and crippled his life. Gay critics have debated in recent years whether Williams's work is marked by \"internalized homophobia\" (Clum) or whether he is a subversive artist whose work can be best interpreted through the lens of leftist French theorists like ROLAND BARTHES and MlCHEL FOUCAULT (Savran). David Bergman sees Williams's characteristic linking of homosexuality and cannibalism as both religious (the homosexual as martyr) and Freudian (homosexuality as accommodation to and rebellion against the father figure), as well as part of a central American gay literary tradition that has its roots in the work of HERMAN MELVILLE. The diverse but complementary work of these critics can be read as necessary counters to the heterosexist critics of the past who either ignored Williams's homosexuality altogether or saw it as the root of his personal and artistic failings. As is the case with many gay artists, the gay critical discussion of Williams, however lively, is just beginning.\n\nA starting point for gay readers of Williams is not the plays but the short stories, particularly the two set in the decaying Joy Rio movie theater, \"Hard Candy \" and \"The Mysteries of the Joy Rio.\" The Joy Rio is a once opulent opera house with horseshoe tiers of boxes above the orchestra and balcony level. Now the theater shows westerns, mass-produced myths of conventional American masculinity, while in the dark, roped-off upper boxes, various combinations of people engage in furtive sex. There lonely watchmaker Emil Kroger spent many hours before he fell in love with Pablo Gonzalez and succumbed to cancer of the bowels. There lonely Pablo, dying of the same disease, looks for brief moments of joy. There fat old Mr. Krupper, with his bag of hard candy and pocketful of quarters to bribe boys for sexual favors, succumbs to a heart attack while kneeling before the most beautiful boy he had ever seen. Theater in these stories is not only the place for the display of conventional heterosexual myths. In its dark corners, furtive homosexual dramas are also played out, dramas of transient joy, of aging, ugly people coming into contact with youth and beauty. In these moments of ecstasy and worship that the theater offers, it becomes a cathedral to those alliteratively linked religious concepts in Williams's work, desire and death. In these stories, one sees some of Williams's basic connections: sodomy with malignancy of the bowels, and sex as simultaneous confrontation with beauty and death. One also sees Williams's typical sex object, the young, dark, down-and-out hustler who is sometimes an angel of death, sometimes (as in \"One Arm\") a GENET-like punk saint. The stories open a theatrical space for the acting out of homosexual desire that is also disease and death. The most revolutionary aspect of these stories is contained in the narrative voice, both deadpan and playful, valorizing the activity at the Joy Rio while describing it as a prim outsider would see it - Williams is always aware of the prejudices of his audience. The double entendre of the title \"Hard Candy\" is typical of the sly humor with which Williams deflates the pathos of the situations he creates. The same playfulness is contained in Williams's wittier gay poems, like \"San Sebastiana de Sodoma,\" in which \"Mary from Her tower / of heaven\" watches arrows pierce the throat and thigh of the martyr who was \"an emperor's concubine,\" or his best-known poem, \"Life Story,\" a hilarious depiction of post-coital attempts at communication. Blanche DuBois demonstrates the same playfulness while flirting with the young paperboy in A Streetcar Named Desire, transforming the event into grand theater while understanding its more banal premise, \"You make my mouth water.\n\nOne sees Williams's darker connections in two of his major plays, Cat On a Hot Tin Roof (1955) and Suddenly Last Summer (1958). In Cat On a Hot Tin Roof, Brick Pollitt and his wife are living in the room once occupied by Jack Straw and Peter Ochello, the founders of the plantation now run by Big Daddy. Straw and Ochello are dead, but the bed they shared dominates the setting. Homosexual love is both dead and central to the play. The omnisexual, phallic Big Daddy, who hints at a sexual relationship with his former bosses, who left him their plantation, is dying of cancer of the bowels. Big Daddy's son, Brick, a former football star, is drinking himself to death, following in the footsteps of his beloved friend, Skipper. Brick is trapped by the sexual categories he has been taught: Men are for friendship, women are for sex. Unfortunately for him, those categories have become blurred: His best friend was sexually attracted to him, and his wife wants their marriage to have, in addition to sex, the honesty of a friendship. Brick hung up on his friend's admission of desire and has shut out his wife sexually and emotionally. Unable to endure any kind of intimacy, Brick drinks himself into detachment.\n\nBrick's real problem is that he cannot face the complexity of his own emotions and sexual desires. He needs to see his feelings for Skipper as pure because the thought of being branded as a queer terrifies him. Like all deeply closeted people, Brick is obsessed with what his audience will think. The central scene of Cat On a Hot Tin Roof is a reversal of the usual father-son confrontation over homosexuality. Here son Brick is horrified that Big Daddy is not shocked at the thought of homosexuality while Big Daddy sees Brick's rejection of Skipper as a profound betrayal.\n\nThroughout the play, Williams privileges the troubled closeted homosexual over the fertile heterosexuals. The heterosexual is Brick's awkward, nerdy brother, Gooper, trapped in a loveless marriage with the crass, hyperfertile Mae. Both Gooper and Mae see the plantation as rightfully theirs, for they have done all the right things. Gooper is a successful lawyer and family man. To him, it is outrageous that Big Daddy would favor the drunken wastrel whose marriage is a lie. Fertility of the land and the womb is crucial to the future of the Pollitt plantation, but that plantation was the offspring of a gay couple and will go to Brick and his determined wife, Maggie. Cat On a Hot Tin Roof comes as close to valorizing homosexuality as Williams got in his plays.\n\nSuddenly Last Summer is one of Williams's more poetic dramas, a meditation on desire and cannibalism, which combines many of Williams's more common themes and images. A young woman, Catherine, has been institutionalized and threatened with the possibility of lobotomy for telling the truth about the death of her cousin, Sebastian Venable. Catherine is one of the many women in Williams's work (one thinks particularly of Laura in The Glass Menagerie and Blanche DuBois) whose fate (institutionalization and the threat of lobotomy) is that of his sister, Rose. Catherine has been brought to the conservatory of the splendid New Orleans home of Sebastian's powerful mother to face her family and a psychiatrist. The conservatory is filled with carnivorous plants and filled with the sounds of the jungle. It is Sebastian's garden, representing his vision of nature, that he tried to capture in his poetry but was most vividly depicted in his death as he was torn apart and eaten by the poor Mexican boys whose sexual favors he sought.\n\nSebastian saw the world as variations on cannibalism, but the ultimate violence is threatened by his mother: \"Cut this hideous story out of her brain.\" Mrs. Venable, intent on protecting her son's image as an asexual visionary primarily devoted to his poetry and to her as his muse, will mutilate Catherine's mind rather than have the truth known about her son's homosexual activity. However, the psychiatrist will not order the lobotomy and Catherine's narrative, the truth about Sebastian, will take precedence over his privately published poetry. On one level, Suddenly Last Summer can be seen and read as Williams's depiction of the relationship between homosexual life and art, about the price paid for revealing the policed secret of homosexuality. Yet once again, the homosexual is dead, never seen but only discussed, like Skipper in Cat On a Hot Tin Roof and Blanche's first husband who shot himself when Blanche publicly confronted him with his homosexuality. Only Baron de Charlus in the more fantastic Camino Real (1953) appears on stage. When in the 1970s Williams could actually depict homosexuality more candidly, he created, in Small Craft Warnings (1970), a self-hating homosexual artist who laments the \"deadening coarseness\" in the lives of most homosexuals.\n\nHowever, this literal reading of Williams's plays neglects the ways he brilliantly codes his plays so that gay readings are possible. A Streetcar Named Desire, in particular, can be seen and read as a gay play. Its theatrical transformations, CAMP, and careful use of gay slang (less known by a general audience in 1947) allow gay audiences to read their own transgressive text. This is not to say that Blanche is literally a gay man in drag but can be read as male and/or female, gay and/or straight. Certainly the focus on the animal magnetism of the macho Stanley Kowalski, treating him as the object of characters' and audience's gaze and desire and - in his silly, sometime brutal masculine posturing - also of their ridicule, can be given a gay reading. Belle Reprieve, the recent gender-inverted deconstruction of Streetcar performed by the gay troupe Bloolips and the lesbian troupe Split Britches, offered a hilarious but cogent gay interpretation of Williams's classic.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBergman, David.
