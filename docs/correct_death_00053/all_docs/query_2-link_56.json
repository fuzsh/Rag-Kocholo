        "text": "March 26, 1911 – February 25, 1983\n\nThomas Lanier Williams was an American writer who is primarily known for his plays The Glass Menagerie, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire, among others. After a staggeringly successful run that saw at least 10 of his plays produced on Broadway, his career and personal life started a steady downward spiral. Following the death of his long-time partner, Williams struggled with depression and addiction to alcohol and narcotics. Though he continued to write throughout his life, his style mirrored his mood and his later work was never as well-received as his early work. Tennessee Williams died in a New York hotel after choking to death on the lid of a bottle of eye drops. Drugs may have been involved. He was 71.\n\nBurial\n\nCalvary Cemetery – St. Louis, MO\n\nSpecific Location\n\nSection 15A; Get a map at the office or online, Section 15 is made up of 3 small sections, Tennessee Williams is buried near the road in the northwest corner of the western section."
