        "text": "Thomas Lanier Williams III (1911–1983), known by his pen name Tennessee Williams, was an American playwright and screenwriter, considered one of the foremost playwrights of 20th-century American drama. “The Vengeance Of Nitocris” is his first professional story, published when he was 17. His success arrived at age 33 with The Glass Menagerie becoming a hit, followed by A Streetcar Named Desire (1947), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955), Sweet Bird of Youth (1959), and The Night of the Iguana (1961). His success made him one of the most notable homosexual men in the public eye in mid-century America, and he battled alcoholism and dependence on various combinations of amphetamines and barbiturates. In 1979, four years before his death, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. Despite his last will and testament’s specific request that he be buried at sea “like Hart Crane,” his body was interred in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri near his mother’s."
