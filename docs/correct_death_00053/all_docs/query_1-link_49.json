        "text": "In life, he openly detested St. Louis. And in death, Tennessee Williams — perhaps not coincidentally — asked that his cremains be scattered in the Gulf of Mexico, near where the poet Hart Crane, a creative inspiration, ended his life by jumping from a cruise ship in 1932.\n\nThose final wishes, suffice it to say, were not carried out as intended upon the playwright’s death at age 71 in 1983.\n\nNot only were the requests for cremation and burial at sea ignored, but the mortal remains were relegated to rest for eternity in the city despised by Williams.\n\nHow the eminent St. Louis man of letters wound up in Calvary Cemetery is a saga worthy of a vengeance-themed Williams stage production.\n\n“From a Freudian point of view, it can easily be seen as an act of revenge,” says Washington University professor and Williams scholar Henry Schvey.\n\nBorn Thomas Lanier Williams in Mississippi, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning creator of “A Glass Menagerie,” “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” and nearly 100 other plays, novels, poems and short stories, he left no room for interpretation when it came to his feelings about the city where he spent the formative years of his life.\n\n“I found St. Louisans cold, smug, complacent, intolerant, stupid and provincial. … I hate the place,” the playwright said in a 1946 Post-Dispatch interview following the Broadway opening of “A Streetcar Named Desire.”\n\nCarrie Houk, founder and executive artistic director of the Tennessee Williams Festival St. Louis, ventures that the playwright’s public sentiments allow for wiggle room.\n\n“I wouldn’t exactly say that Tennessee Williams loathed St. Louis,” says Houk. “I believe that he loathed the circumstances in his life during his years here.”\n\nThere is nonetheless some reason to believe Williams bore a grudge to his grave toward St. Louis.\n\nThe lead role in the final act of Tennessee Williams’ life went to Walter “Dakin” Williams, the Metro East attorney who decreed that the body of his older, estranged brother should be returned to St. Louis for burial alongside his mother, Edwina, in the Calvary family plot.\n\n“You could make an argument that it is fitting and betrayal at the same time,” Schvey says. “It’s loaded with resonance.”\n\nThere is ample evidence to suggest that a story concocted by Dakin to lure his brother to St. Louis in 1969 was the catalyst for an estrangement that persevered through the remainder of Tennessee’s life.\n\nTold by Dakin that his mother lay gravely ill, Tennessee rushed home to find Edwina in good health and a commitment order assigning Tennessee to the psychiatric ward at Barnes Hospital for treatment of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nWilliams emerged six months later to resume his writing.\n\nBut by all accounts he and Dakin spoke infrequently if ever again.\n\n“The popularly repeated story was that (Tennessee Williams) never forgave his brother for a 1969 stay at Barnes Hospital where he was treated for drug addiction in a psychiatric ward,” says Karen Goering, chief operating officer of the Missouri History Museum.\n\nSchvey contends that Tennessee Williams was “saved” by the intervention of his brother. “But it was an act (Tennessee Williams) did not forgive,” he says.\n\nTennessee Williams, like Hart Crane, struggled with his sexual orientation, although he eventually became more open about his preferences in an era when most gay men remained closeted.\n\nIt is therefore no accident that the subtext of sexuality joined by death is found in the works that vaulted Williams into the pantheon of greatest 20th-century playwrights.\n\nOn Feb. 25, 1983, Williams choked to death after swallowing a bottle cap in a New York hotel room (an account that remains in dispute).\n\nDakin embarked for New York to arrange a funeral and burial.\n\nThe arrangements at one juncture entailed interment in the Ohio graveyard where Williams’ grandparents were laid to rest.\n\nDakin chose instead to draw on his brother’s flirtation with Catholicism (“He converted for one day to see what it was like,” according to Schvey) by arranging for burial at Archdiocesan Calvary in North St. Louis.\n\n“Against his wishes, Dakin had him buried in the one place he would have dreaded being,” Schvey says.\n\nDeath did not end what Schvey characterizes as Dakin’s “love-hate” relationship with his playwright brother.\n\nAccording to Schvey, Dakin in his later years was a regular presence at Tennessee Williams celebrations and retrospectives.\n\nSchvey says that in addition to capitalizing on Tennessee’s fame, Dakin had a habit of advancing the theory that the playwright may have been murdered.\n\nDakin died in 2008. He is buried in the family plot along with Edwina, his sister, Rose (a model for several characters in the Williams repertoire), and the man identified on the front of his headstone as Thomas Lanier Williams and on the back by the adopted name that resonates still on stages throughout the world:\n\nTennessee Williams\n\n1911-1983\n\nPoet\n\nPlaywright\n\n“The violets in the mountains\n\nhave broken the rocks!”\n\nCamino Real\n\nHouk, who leads Tennessee Williams Festival actors on a pilgrimage to Calvary Cemetery, makes the argument that the locale where the playwright rests is fitting and appropriate:\n\n“Although I cannot think that he would be thrilled about the fact that his last wishes were not honored, selfishly, it is wonderful for the legions of lovers of Mr. Williams’ work to have a place to pay respects and reflect on the beauty and importance of his plays, poems, essays and letters.”\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nSteve Giegerich\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
