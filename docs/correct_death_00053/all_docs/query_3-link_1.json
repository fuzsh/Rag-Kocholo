        "text": "In honor of Pride Month, I wanted to highlight the relationship between Tennessee Williams and Frank Merlo. Williams was renowned for his contributions to the theater world. Some of his plays include famous works such as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, A Streetcar Named Desire, and The Glass Menagerie. Williams, who was openly gay, often featured gay characters and themes, and other topics considered taboo at the time. Despite this, his plays were generally well-received by both critics and the public. Frank Merlo was a working-class Italian American from New Jersey. He worked as an actor on occasion but was primarily Williams’ personal assistant.\n\nThe two men met in 1948 at Atlantic House, a bar in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Williams describes the first time he saw Merlo in his Memoirs, “… he leaned smoking against the porch railing and he was wearing Levis and I looked and looked at him. My continual and intense scrutiny must have burned through his shoulders, for after a while he turned toward me and grinned,” (p.133). This encounter resulted in a relationship that ran the course of 15 years. In 1951, he even went on to write a play inspired by Merlo, “The Rose Tattoo”, which was his “love-play” to the world. It even has a dedication that reads, “To Frankie in Return for Sicily.”\n\nAccording to his memoirs, for Williams, living with Merlo in his Manhattan apartment and in his house in Key West were some of his happiest and most productive years. But Williams was heavily involved with alcohol and various drugs. This, combined with Williams’ promiscuity, put a strain on their relationship and Williams’ writing.\n\nThen, in 1962, Merlo was diagnosed with lung cancer. As his health declined, Williams remained by his side and housed Merlo in his Manhattan apartment. Later, the cancer was deemed inoperable, and Merlo died in 1963. His last words to Williams were, “I’m used to you now,” which Williams accepted as an admission of Merlo’s love.\n\nMany consider The Night of the Iguana to be the last successful play he wrote, which premiered on Broadway in 1961. He fell into a period of depression and increased drug use following Merlo’s death and was never able to regain the success he had experienced earlier in his career. Williams himself attributed the subsequent failures to the death of Frank Merlo.\n\nOn February 25, 1983, Williams was found dead at the age of 71.\n\nI’ll end with an excerpt from one of Williams’ poems, “We have not Long to Love” from The Collected Poems of Tennessee Williams:\n\n“…Intimate the silence,\n\ndim and warm.\n\nI could but did not, reach\n\nto touch your arm.\n\nI could, but do not, break\n\nthat which is still.\n\n(Almost the faintest whisper\n\nwould be shrill.)\n\nSo moments pass as though\n\nthey wished to stay.\n\nWe have not long to love.\n\nA night. A day…”\n\nDiscover more:\n\nSearch Chronicling America for coverage of Tennessee Williams’ life and work in historic newspapers.\n\nTennessee Williams. Memoirs. 1975.
