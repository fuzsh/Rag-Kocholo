        "text": "Hollywood’s sad history of misuse of ethnic and/or black actors is well documented. African-Americans were forced to play maids and eye-rolling “clown’’ parts. Mexican-Americans, too, were maligned, with mustachioed actors often depicting indolent or untrustworthy characters. American Indians also felt the sting of Hollywood’s racism, sneered at as “savages’’ in the Westerns of John Wayne, et al. (“The Searchers’’ is an egregious case in point.)\n\nNor were these the only groups to be undervalued by the film industry in those times. Albeit less blatantly, Chinese-American actors were stereotyped and shunted to Poverty Row B-pictures. (It was also not uncommon for a white actor to be made over in order to play Chinese characters: a pursuivant, for instance, a war lord, or, most famously, detective Charlie Chan, played by Swedish-born actor Warner Oland and American Sidney Toler, of Scottish descent.)\n\nThough others — such as Lotus Liu — followed, the most notable Asian actress of the period was Anna May Wong (1905-1961), a second-generation Chinese born in Los Angeles. She was Hollywood’s first Chinese-American star, though her relationship with studios was tenuous. Wong began acting in silent films, and won critical acclaim for her part in “The Toll of the Sea,” a two-strip Technicolor production from 1922. But typecasting set in, and Wong was relegated to “Dragon Lady’’ roles. She lobbied for the lead in a major film — “The Good Earth’’ (1935) — but was ignored by MGM bosses in favor of Luise Rainer (who won an Oscar for her performance). In recent years, Wong’s career has been burnished somewhat by film historians.\n\nSuch has not been the case, however, with Maylia (1925- ), a diminutive Chinese-American actress whose brief career never gained traction, but who nevertheless fell into Hollywood myth-making. Born Gloria Chin in Detroit, she was a 20-something co-ed visiting Southern California when she was spotted in a Hollywood restaurant by the wife of a producer of the soon-to-be-made “To the Ends of the Earth’’ (1948), a ham-handed crime drama with one of the strangest “twist’’ endings in memory.\n\nBecause of her striking beauty, Chin was given a screen test and subsequent part in the movie, which starred former singer/hoofer Dick Powell as a sanctimonious narcotics agent. Chin’s name was changed to the more exotic-sounding “Maylia’’ (which, according to press material released at the time, meant “beautiful’’ in Cantonese). The studio also touted her as “the first Chinese starlet since Anna May Wong’’; like her screen name, a fabrication.\n\nMaylia played “Shu Pan,’’ a young Chinese woman on holiday with her “governess” (played by the Swedish actress Signe Hasso). During the shoot, Maylia underwent another, more natural, name change when she married fellow actor Benson Fong (of the “Charlie Chan’’ series.) Her subsequent pregnancy upset studio plans, and she worked out the remainder of her contract with bit parts in low-budget serial installments, such as “Boston Blackie’s Chinese Adventure.” The birth of her second child in 1950 effectively marked the end of Maylia’s film career.\n\n“To the Ends of the Earth’’ was directed by Robert Stevenson (1905-1986), who later became something of a house director for Walt Disney Productions. The plot centered on Powell’s efforts to track down a ring of opium smugglers, and the movie’s clever conceit lay in convincing the audience that Hasso’s character was the ringleader. In the final scene, however, it’s revealed that Maylia’s “Shu Pan’’ was the culprit all along. She’s captured, and physically thrown against a wall by Powell, who points to the motionless figure lying on the floor and orders his fellow agents: “Tie up that mess of garbage!’’ (Role-playing, of course, but I have to wonder: Would such abuse have been directed at an American actress?) Perhaps not surprisingly, Shu Pan, the villainess, was the film’s most interesting character, while Powell’s wooden, platitude-spouting agent was tedious.\n\nIn short, their Asian physiognomy committed actors in postwar Hollywood to career graveyards. Fortunately, the passage of time and changing attitudes improved a situation that, quite frankly, had nowhere to go but up.\n\nBob Leddy"
