It is the only state encyclopedia in the country to be produced by a library system. The EOA strives to offer a definitive, comprehensive, and accurate record of America’s twenty-fifth state. The mission of this free online encyclopedia is to collect and disseminate information on all aspects of the state’s history and culture and to provide a comprehensive reference work for historians, teachers, students, and others seeking to understand and appreciate Arkansas’s heritage. The EOA debuted online to the public in May 2006 as a work in progress. At that time, it contained approximately 700 entries and 900 pieces of media; as of 2014, the site offers more than 3,600 entries and more than 4,800 pieces of media.\n\nEOA staff members: Guy Lancaster, Editor Mike Keckhaver, Media Editor Mike Polston, Staff Historian Ali Welky, Assistant Editor Kay Bland, Education Coordinator Jasmine Jobe, Editorial Assistant Former EOA staff members: Tom W.

Joe no. 39, bought at Books Plus in Jonesboro, Arkansas, in 1985, when I was nine years old. Most kids probably pick up their first issues a bit younger than that, sometimes encouraged by a parent who had fond memories of superheroes and soldiers. But my father was still nursing a grudge against his own mother, who—because he wouldn’t clean his room one day—tossed away his copies of Fantastic Four no. 1, Namor the Sub-Mariner no. 1, and Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos no. 1. Poor dad. My discovery of comic books probably brought back some painful memories for him. That was nearly thirty years ago, when comic books were 75 cents, which seemed expensive back then but seems like almost nothing now, in this era when single issues have long since broken the three-dollar mark. Despite the passage of almost three decades, I can still easily call to mind some of the visuals in those comic books, such as the high cliff our heroes must descend in order to approach the enemy base unawares. And I remember being confused by military time. “Let’s rendezvous at 2300 hours.” I could do the math and knew that 2300 hours was nearly 100 days—just how long were these missions? Until my father explained the twenty-four-hour clock to me, I thought our eponymous “Real American Hero” had more free time on his hands than he really should. Why do I remember all of this? Why is a G.I. Joe comic book of three decades’ vintage in the forefront of my mind while certain novels I’ve read much more recently do not strike the same chord? I think the combination of visuals and text goes a long way toward explaining that. Comics theorist Scott McCloud, in his 1993 book Understanding Comics, cites several antecedents to the comic book form—for example, Egyptian hieroglyphics and illuminated Bible manuscripts—to prove that this combination\n\nof word and image has long standing in human culture. In fact, human beings evolved as visual creatures, so it’s no accident that certain visual cues resonate with our memories more than text. Rock art in European caves dates back to 40,000 or so years ago and may have been produced for religious ceremonies. Written language is much newer, showing up in the world only in the Bronze Age, having perhaps evolved from the marks used to count goods received. But while it’s amazing that this tradesman’s shorthand eventually developed to give us such magnificent works as George Eliot’s Middlemarch, it doesn’t change the fact that a random G.I. Joe issue still ranks higher in my memory, annoying as that is. There is power in the combination of media, in word and image brought together. That is why we wanted to do this book. We here at the Encyclopedia of Arkansas project wanted to make a book presenting some of the more interesting facets of Arkansas history in a manner that would resonate in a unique way. The online Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture—portions of which are presented in this volume—went live to the public on May 2, 2006. It now includes more than 3,600 entries and 4,800 pieces of media, and it continues to grow at an astonishing rate, adding more with each passing year. As closely as I work on the text day in and day out, these days, when I think about the Barker-Karpis Gang (p. 66), what first comes to mind is Ron Wolfe’s drawing of that sweet old granny version of Ma Barker, armed with a bomb, a knife, two guns, and a cake. It captures something that words can’t, as does his picture of a mischievous Helen Spence (p. 104) escaping from custody in her checkered dress. (And what’s with her smile, by the way? Isn’t it amazing how a crooked line like that can load a figure down with ambiguity?) Our illustrator Ron Wolfe has been kicking around the comics scene for some time, from writing duties on Clive Barker’s Hellraiser in the early 1990s down to the present day with his own series, Knights of the Living Dead. He also writes and illustrates for the state’s most widely circulated newspaper, the Arkansas\n\nDemocrat-Gazette. Ron has that cartoonist’s knack of caricature, of capturing the emotional gamut from absurdity to horror in a few spare lines, and his talents are on full display in this book. No one has yet caught on film the “monster” that allegedly haunts the White River, but even if someone did tomorrow, I’ll bet you will still find that Ron’s drawing of a smiling, Nessie-like creature (p. 151) holds first place in your brain. I’m thrilled that he has turned his talents to illustrating these vignettes of our state’s history. Arkansas has a rich heritage, and believe me when I say that you won’t be forgetting the stories presented herein anytime soon, for Ron’s style perfectly captures the often lunatic twists and turns our state has taken through the years.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Arkansas has been made possible by the hard work of hundreds of authors from not only Arkansas but also around the country and the world. Some of their work is represented here in this volume. We thank each and every one of them for working to bring so many interesting facets of state and local history to light. If you want to delve even further into the state’s history, the University of Arkansas Press has published several general volumes on Arkansas history. Two have recently been released in second editions: Arkansas: A Narrative History by Jeannie M. Whayne, Thomas A. DeBlack, George Sabo, and Morris S. Arnold (2013) and A Documentary History of Arkansas, edited by C. Fred Williams, S. Charles Bolton, Carl H. Moneyhon, and LeRoy T. Williams (2013). UA Press also published the four-volume “Histories of Arkansas” series covering particular time periods in greater detail: Arkansas, 1800–1860: Remote and Restless by S. Charles Bolton (1998), With Fire and Sword: Arkansas, 1861–1874 by Thomas A. DeBlack (2003), Arkansas and the New South, 1874–1929 by Carl H. Moneyhon (1997), and Arkansas in the Modern Era, 1930–1999 by Ben F. Johnson III (2000). Another general history that many have enjoyed is Michael B. Dougan’s Arkansas Odyssey: The Saga of Arkansas from Prehistoric Times to the Present (1994); a second edition of this is reportedly in the works.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, thirty years from now, you’ll be thankful that you can talk with some expertise about the Brooks-Baxter War or the shadier history of Hot Springs. That will have made this whole project worthwhile.\n\nIf, after reading this book, you want to delve a little further into Arkansas history, the best place to start is the online Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture, from which these entries were pulled. Each entry is not only illustrated with historical media and hyperlinked to other entries, it also has a bibliography at the bottom that will guide you to more specific resources on that particular subject. In addition, there are overview entries covering specific time periods, from prehistory to the present, as well as larger themes, such as “Religion,” “Environment,” and “Literature and Authors.” The Encyclopedia of Arkansas is the perfect starting point for any introduction to the state’s history and culture, and the staff of the EOA works diligently to keep all its information up to date.\n\nAside from UA Press, Butler Center Books, the publishing arm of the Butler Center for Arkansas Studies at the Central Arkansas Library System, also regularly publishes books on state history, including another EOA project, the Encyclopedia of Arkansas Music, edited by Ali Welky and Michael Keckhaver (2013). Arkansas is also home to a highly regarded journal of state history, the Arkansas Historical Quarterly, published by the Arkansas Historical Association since 1942. Most counties have a local historical association, and museums dedicated to state and local history exist throughout the state.\n\n6\n\nIn short, if this book has piqued your interest, there are numerous avenues for further exploration. You won’t believe what’s out there. Enjoy!\n\nArkansas Loan and Thrift\n\nthat he had throat cancer. Bennett died in 1979 without going to trial.\n\nMore than 2,000 people and churches lost money when AL&T collapsed. The receiver eventually recovered about a fourth of the $4.2 million placed in the company. Securities, bank, and savingsand-loan officials for Faubus backed off regulating the institution, heeding the official but secret advice of the attorney general and the intervention of powerful state legislators, two of whom, Representative Paul Van Dalsem of Perryville (Perry County) and Senator Joe Lee Anderson of Helena (Phillips County), would be listed in the indictment as co-conspirators, along with other state officials and politicians. Cartoons by George Fisher in the Arkansas Gazette popularized the scandal for some years.\n\nJokingly called “Arkansas Loan and Theft,” Arkansas Loan and Thrift Corporation (AL&T) was a hybrid bank that operated for three years outside state banking laws with the help of political connections in the 1960s. AL&T became a symbol of the corruption and lethargy that were the products of Governor Orval Faubus’s twelve-year control of the statehouse and, in the opinion of Governor Winthrop Rockefeller, the Democratic Party’s unfettered reign since Reconstruction. The ensuing grand jury indictment said the AL&T’s organizers ran the finance company illegally and dissipated depositors’ money by making loans to themselves and their companies, friends, and confederates— loans that were never repaid—and by giving themselves and friends large stock dividends even though the company was broke. The chief operating officer and two other executives were convicted and sentenced to prison for fraud, as well as conspiracy and bribery. Bruce Bennett, who helped organize AL&T while he was attorney general, was indicted on twenty-eight counts, but a longtime friend from El Dorado (Union County), U.S. District Judge Oren Harris, delayed the trial when Bennett revealed\n\nThe bank seemed to be the brainchild of Ernest A. Bartlett Jr., a twenty-five-year-old used-car dealer, and Bennett, a politician from El Dorado who was elected attorney general in 1956 by inveighing against racial integration. Bennett ran an unsuccessful race for governor against Faubus in 1960, accusing him of being soft on integration, and regained the attorney general’s office in 1962. He made a final race for governor in 1968 while a grand jury was investigating his role in AL&T. Bartlett, Bennett, and others set up AL&T in December 1964; the incorporation papers were prepared in the attorney general’s office by an assistant attorney general, who received AL&T shares. Bartlett and Bennett found a defunct finance company, United Loan and Investment, which had a charter from 1937 as an industrial loan company. It was incorporated into AL&T and became the finance company’s authority for taking deposits. Van Dalsem, a longtime leader of the House of Representatives and 8\n\nFaubus’s floor leader, arranged for Bennett to buy an inactive insurance company from the House speaker, J. H. Cottrell Jr. of Little Rock (Pulaski County). Bennett then sold it at a profit to AL&T, which renamed it Savings Guaranty Corporation, a shell company that would “insure” people’s deposits in AL&T. It was given more than 1,000 shares of AL&T stock, the only assets it would ever own. AL&T wrote Savings Guaranty a check for $580,000, which allowed the state insurance examiner, who received AL&T stock, to certify that the insurance company had the capital to insure deposits. Then Savings Guaranty sent the money back to AL&T and took an IOU. AL&T advertised that it would pay an interest rate of 5.75% for deposits, more than banks and savings-and-loan associations could offer, and that deposits were safer than if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured them. Actually, Savings Guaranty had no assets but the worthless AL&T stock, but in ads it used what looked like the official federal seal. The company opened a headquarters at Van Buren (Crawford County) and offices around the state. It spent $150,000 on advertising and accumulated more than $4 million in deposits. Bennett issued five official opinions to Van Dalsem and state regulators explaining that AL&T’s operations were perfectly legal and that, because it operated under the auspices of an old industrial loan charter rather than a bank or savings-and-loan charter, the state securities commissioner, bank commissioner, and savings-and-loan commissioner could not regulate its activities. Bennett never released the opinions publicly; they were found in the files at AL&T when it went into receivership. The state securities commissioner testified in Bartlett’s criminal trial that when he moved to regulate AL&T and suspended Bartlett’s broker’s license, Bennett threatened to go to Faubus about his interference. Faubus insisted he never did anything to help the company and knew little about its operations. Bartlett maintained that Bennett’s opinion giving legal sanction to AL&T was written by William J. Smith, Faubus’s legal counsel, and that Smith advised\n\nFaubus on the company’s formation. Smith denied this. When Judge Joe Purcell defeated Bennett for the office of attorney general in 1966, he quickly moved to shutter AL&T. He filed a lawsuit in Pulaski County Chancery Court on January 23, 1967, ten days after taking office, contending that AL&T was selling securities illegally. The case was assigned to Chancellor Kay L. Matthews, a former Faubus aide. The next day, Bartlett visited Matthews’s law and business partner, Claude Carpenter Jr., also a former Faubus aide, and paid him a substantial retainer for AL&T. Carpenter would be named a co-conspirator in the subsequent indictment. He testified at Bartlett’s trial in 1969 that he never did anything for the fees except discuss football with Bartlett and accompany him on a private plane trip to Las Vegas. Judge Matthews never brought Purcell’s suit to trial. One of Carpenter’s connections to AL&T was mentioned in a hearing more than two years later, and Matthews disqualified himself from the case. On March 13, 1968, acting on a motion by lawyers of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. District Judge John E. Miller of Fort Smith (Sebastian County) closed AL&T and put it into receivership. At a hearing on the claims against the company, a minister said churches that had invested their building funds in AL&T should have first call on any recovered assets because such assets were “God’s money.” Judge Miller famously countered that God should have been wise enough not to put his money in AL&T. A federal grand jury indicted Bennett, Bartlett, and two officers from Booneville (Logan County)—Afton Borum and Hoyt Borum—on twenty-eight counts. Judge Harris severed Bennett’s case from the others and gave him a continuance when Bennett said he was ill. The government eventually gave up on trying Bennett. Bartlett was convicted and sentenced to five years and fined $5,000. The Borum brothers were convicted and received even shorter sentences. Ernest Dumas Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nPolitics\n\nArkansas Negro Democratic Association\n\nThe Arkansas Negro Democratic Association (ANDA) was founded in 1928 by Little Rock (Pulaski County) physician John Marshall Robinson, who served as president until 1952, and a number of other prominent black professionals. Between 1928 and 1952, ANDA was the leading voice of black Arkansas Democrats in the state. Although ANDA tackled a number of issues concerned with racial discrimination, its principal focus was on winning the right for black citizens to participate in the activities of the Arkansas Democratic Party, especially its primary elections.\n\n10\n\nIn Arkansas, the payment of a one-dollar poll tax qualified a person to vote, irrespective of race. But exclusion from state Democratic Party primary elections significantly disfranchised black voters since that party dominated state politics. When white Democrats in Little Rock prevented African Americans from voting in the party’s primary elections in 1928, Robinson petitioned the courts for redress. After a temporary restraining order was overturned, Robinson then sued for the right to vote in Robinson v. Holman (1930). The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld the use of all-white primaries, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case on appeal.\n\nAlthough Robinson’s and ANDA’s activism was muted by the Great Depression of the 1930s, it was revived again in the 1940s. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Louisiana case of United States v. Classic (1941) declared that primary elections were subject to federal regulation. However, ANDA members were once more turned away from the polls on election day. It took another U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Texas case of Smith v. Allwright (1944) to clarify the situation. In that case, the Court explicitly stated that the use of all-white primary elections to disfranchise black voters was unconstitutional. Black Arkansans voted in the 1944 primary elections. In 1945, white Democrats sought to reverse this by amending party membership rules and initiating a complex double primary system. This provided for city and statewide primaries that excluded African Americans and for federal primaries at which blacks could vote but only at segregated ballot boxes. Arkansas Secretary of State C. G. Hall said that Robinson was not eligible to vote at all because of a conviction for manslaughter in 1911. Robinson believed that he had already been pardoned for the crime, but in exchange for his citizenship rights fully restored, he offered to resign as ANDA president. After the 1944 elections, Governor Homer Adkins pardoned him, apparently unconditionally.\n\nsupporters then changed the name of the organization to the Arkansas Democratic Voters Association (ADVA) to assimilate into the integrated Arkansas Democratic Party. Both ANDA and ADVA were the forerunners of what is today known as the Arkansas Democratic Black Caucus. The common mission of all these organizations has been to give voice to the concerns of black Arkansas Democratic Party voters, members, and elected officials. John A. Kirk University of Arkansas at Little Rock\n\nRobinson found his authority increasingly challenged by younger black activists who sought to use the black vote more strategically to extract concessions from white politicians. In 1949, I. S. McClinton founded and became president of the Young Negro Democrats. In 1950, the Little Rock branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) brought an end to the all-white primaries in Arkansas when it supported Little Rock minister J. H. Gatlin’s lawsuit for a place on the Democratic Party primary ballot. The courts ruled in Gatlin’s favor. Later that year, the State Democratic Convention changed party rules to admit African Americans. When Robinson announced his retirement from politics in 1952, McClinton was elected ANDA president. McClinton and his Politics\n\nArkansas Real Estate Bank and Arkansas State Bank\n\nstockholders elected the rest. Each branch had a local board of directors based on a similar formula. Subscribers to the bank’s stock totaled 325 people, and most were leading men in the state, including Anthony H. Davies, Horace F. Walworth, and U.S. Senator Ambrose H. Sevier—all Chicot County planters. Most stockholders lived in counties bordering the Mississippi or Red rivers, with more than twenty-five percent of all stock owned by twenty-eight men in Chicot County. Subscribers typically bought stock by mortgaging land, which was appraised far above its market value. In turn, they borrowed up to half of the value of their stock, capped at $30,000.\n\nIn 1836, the establishment of the Arkansas Real Estate Bank became the initial act to pass the first state legislature. Momentum for a state-sponsored bank began during the territorial phase when planters and other lowland agricultural interests sought ways to enhance the availability of capital. The Real Estate Bank’s charter required the state to issue $2 million in five-percent bonds, the proceeds from which would serve as the bank’s capital. But the state held no authority for immediate supervision of the bank’s operations other than the appointment of a minority of the bank’s directors. From 1836 to 1855, when the state took over control, the Real Estate Bank proved to be a source of political corruption, financial mismanagement, and intense sectional conflict among politicians.\n\nAccusations of favoritism and spoilage in the Real Estate Bank dominated the 1837 legislative session. One critic, Joseph J. Anthony, a representative from Randolph County, wrote a resolution attacking the bank as a source of special privilege. House Speaker John Wilson, who was also president of the bank, defended its operation and vouched for its financial integrity. On December 4, during a debate on a bill to encourage the taking of wolf pelts, Anthony sarcastically alluded to Wilson’s connections to the bank, after which Wilson killed Anthony with a bowie knife on the House floor. Wilson’s friends secured a change of venue for his trial so that his acquittal was assured.\n\nThe Arkansas State Bank, the sister institution to the Real Estate Bank, provided some funding for commercial projects, though most of its funds facilitated land sales. Its greatest legacy, however, was saddling the new state government with a burdensome debt and instigating several accounts of political corruption. In the end, the bank’s failure jeopardized both public and private banking in Arkansas due to the public outcry against its operation.\n\nAfter that, Davies became bank president and authorized T. T. Williamson and Senator Sevier to float bank bonds in New York City to raise specie and paper issued by stable banks in other states. But most of the bonds were sold to the North American Banking and Trust Company and the U.S. Treasury. Sevier and his relatives (a.k.a. “The Family”) continued to exercise great influence over the bank and benefit from its operation through the early 1850s.\n\nLike the Arkansas State Bank (which operated from 1836 to 1843), the Real Estate Bank enjoyed bipartisan support. Anthony H. Davies and John Ringgold, both prominent Whigs, wrote the bank’s charter, and the Democratic legislature approved it. Other than being a product of the surge of new banks established in the country at the time, the Real Estate Bank’s stated purpose was to promote the interests of lowland planters. It had four locations: the headquarters in Little Rock (Pulaski County) and branches in the cotton belt areas of Columbia (Chicot County), Helena (Phillips County), and Washington (Hempstead County). The state appointed one-fourth of the board of directors, and\n\nWith subscriptions, specie, and acceptable bank notes now available, the Real Estate Bank opened for business December 10, 1838, in Little Rock, and the other branches opened the next spring.

In April 1842, the central board of directors passed a deed of assignment allocating the bank’s assets to fifteen trustees, who replaced local branch boards and eliminated all state appointees. It was hoped the transfer would bring fiscal restraint to the bank, redeem depreciating paper, and pay interest for the state bonds used for capitalization. But the trustees, mostly Democrats, stifled outside surveillance of the bank’s activities. Whigs as much as Democrats feared a full investigation of the bank’s activities, but each side continued to blame the other for the bank’s mismanagement. Outright repudiation failed to materialize, however, and the financial weakness of the Arkansas State Bank and the Real Estate Bank continued. The Arkansas State Bank ceased operation in 1843. Almost immediately, politicians and voters led by Governor Archibald Yell blamed not only the bank’s faulty and inflationary lending policy but the bank itself. Many blamed all banks. As a result, the first amendment to the state’s constitution forbade banks from operating in Arkansas. It gained voter approval in 1846. cie payments so that bank officials could issue far more credit than was held in reserve. Within a year, the bank’s circulation increased from $153,910 to $759,000. Bank officials followed a fractional reserve policy whereby bank notes exceeded the amount of specie on deposit. When coupled with mismanagement, the bank’s lending policy flooded the market with bank notes, whose value depreciated. By the end of the first year of operation, interest payments came due on the bank’s bonds. To alleviate the crisis, bank officials skirted legality and took out a $121,000 loan from the North American Bank and Trust Company of New York. Additional pressure on the bank came from small debtors, who believed bank officials discriminated against them in favor of large landowners and stockholders. One example, the Phillips\n\nBy the late 1840s, the Arkansas General Assembly followed many other states in imposing stiff constitutional regulations on the relationship between government officials and banking. The Real Estate Bank continued to function until April 1855, when the state assumed control of its assets and ordered a reckoning of its accounts. The banking crisis in Arkansas reflected the end of an era both nationally and locally. But while a private banking system rapidly developed elsewhere, Arkansas long remained plagued by the lack of significant stores of capital. The impact of the banking prohibition remains unsolved by historians. Carey M. Roberts Arkansas Tech University\n\nPolitics\n\nBig Lake Wars\n\n14\n\nCompetition and contention over an abundant (and unregulated) storehouse of northeastern Arkansas wildlife from the mid-1870s until 1915 led to violence and controversy known as the Big Lake Wars. Big Lake refers to a section of western Mississippi County created by the massive New Madrid Earthquakes of 1811–1812. “War” may be a misleading description of the events because there were no formalities, declarations, truces, or settlements. However, the conflict had a lasting impact on the state and even on the nation. The Big Lake Wars pitted local residents, who were mostly poor, against affluent northerners, chiefly from St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nEarly Arkansas maps labeled the sparsely populated area between Crowley’s Ridge and the Mississippi River as “the Great Swamp.” After the Civil War, the railroad boom included the building of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway from St. Louis to Texarkana (Miller County), as well as the construction of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway (Frisco). Both railroads built branch lines in northeastern Arkansas to haul timber from the vast hardwood forests to meet the building needs of the nation. The post–Civil War period also spawned hunting excursions as a pastime for the well-to-do. Groups, some that formed into hunting clubs, chartered railroad cars to travel to the Big Lake area for extended hunts in a time when there were no state or federal regulations on the taking of wild game. The trains that took out timber also provided transportation for the products of the market hunters—mostly deer, ducks, and fish. Subsistence hunting, food for tables, became overshadowed by hunting that brought in money. Restaurants north of Arkansas often featured wild game from the Big Lake area, and iced barrels of venison, ducks, fish, and even frogs went aboard the trains in the area and headed north. The fish were usually largemouth bass and crappie, as catfish were disdained at that time. Friction quickly arose between the local hunters and the visiting sportsmen, both using the same timberland lowland area. The St. Louis people began leasing land to keep out other hunters, and disputes flared into fights, shootings, and beatings. Some clubhouses and lodges, which were constructed with the readily available hardwood lumber, were burned. Local residents regarded the watery Big Lake country as theirs to hunt. Clubs signed leases and bought land, and lumber companies bought the timber rights. Titles to the land, however, were sometimes questionable if not fraudulent. Numerous court actions resulted. An avalanche of local legislation came out of the Arkansas General Assembly but was largely ineffective. Some of the laws prohibited out-of-state residents from hunting\n\nin Arkansas, and the wealthy sportsmen often paid the fines and went on hunting. At the beginning of the twentieth century, concerns over dwindling wildlife populations emerged on a national level as well as in Arkansas. The international Migratory Bird Treaty was passed by Congress in 1913, putting ducks and geese under federal control. New federal and state laws were passed to establish hunting seasons and, later, to set daily limits on the taking of wildlife. Big Lake National Wildlife Refuge, the first such refuge in Arkansas, was established in 1915, and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC) was created, also in 1915. The prime mover behind the formation of the AGFC was state senator Junius Marion Futrell of Paragould (Greene County), which is near Big Lake; Futrell later became governor. Arkansas’s governor in 1915, George Washington Hays, pitched his support behind Futrell’s legislation to get it passed and signed into law. The new agency had a staff of nine part-time game wardens to patrol the entire state, and one was a Paragould resident. These agencies, refuges, and regulations helped bring the four decades of conflict to a close. Not directly tied to the Big Lake situation was the arrival of rice farming in the Grand Prairie region of Arkansas. Migrating ducks made seasonal use of the farms’ man-made reservoirs in addition to the nearby bottomland hardwood areas, and Stuttgart (Arkansas County) became a center of duck hunting. But the wintering ducks did not forsake Big Lake. To aid in their management, the AGFC in the early 1950s created Big Lake Wildlife Management Area on the eastern side of Big Lake National Wildlife Refuge, along with St. Francis Sunken Lands Wildlife Management area just to the west and southwest. A 1980s report by the federal refuge’s manager estimated that one million ducks were on the refuge in an early December survey. Joe Mosby Conway, Arkansas\n\nPolitics\n\nBrooks-Baxter War\n\nThe Brooks-Baxter War, which occurred during April and May 1874, was an armed conflict between the supporters of two rivals for the governorship—Joseph Brooks and Elisha Baxter. The violence spilled out of Little Rock (Pulaski County) into much of the state and was resolved only when the federal government intervened. The result of the war, recognition of Elisha Baxter as the governor, brought a practical end to Republican rule in the state and thus ended the era of Reconstruction.\n\nsettle the dispute, and he continued his efforts to displace Baxter, taking his dispute to the state courts. His legal appeals failed until changing political circumstances and shifting alliances created a court favorable to his position. The new condition was the regular Republican leaders’ loss of faith in Baxter, who not only tried to get former Democratic leaders to support him but adopted a hostile attitude toward one of the Republican Party’s major economic programs—state aid to railroads. Shortly after Baxter refused to sign bonds designated for the Arkansas Central Railroad and raised questions about the legality of all railroad bonds, Republican regulars, including U.S. senators Powell Clayton and Stephen Dorsey, met in Little Rock and determined to remove the governor. After that meeting, the Pulaski County Circuit Court of Judge John Whytock took up a request by Brooks for a writ giving him possession of the governor’s office that had languished since June 1873. On April 15, 1874, Whytock ruled in favor of Brooks and issued the writ.\n\nQuestions concerning the results of the state’s 1872 gubernatorial election brought about the Brooks-Baxter War. In that election, Joseph Brooks—a carpetbagger with a radical reputation and the leader of the party faction known as the “Brindletails”—ran as a Reform Republican, supporting the national Liberal Republican movement, including Horace Greeley for president, and advancing a local plan to end the disfranchisement of former Confederates, reduce taxes, cut government expenses, and limit the power of the governor. His program attracted conservative Republicans and Democrats, who saw his programs as the best way for them to recapture power and backed him despite his radical past. Republican regulars, often called “Minstrels,” backed Elisha Baxter, a scalawag who ran on a platform promising many of the same reforms proposed by Brooks. Central to the campaign was the issue of disfranchisement and the ability of the Minstrels to maintain control of the state government. Brooks may actually have won the subsequent election, but Baxter’s supporters controlled the election machinery and declared Baxter and other regulars victors, despite evidence of widespread irregularities. Brooks and his supporters refused to accept the results. They appealed the seating of the regular party’s candidates in Congress and secured one seat for a pro-Brooks candidate. Brooks also appealed the gubernatorial election to the legislature, but the legislature refused to hear his case.\n\nBrooks acted quickly and marched to the State House with a group of armed men and the Pulaski County sheriff. Confronting Baxter, the sheriff demanded that the governor leave his office. Alone except for his young son, the governor left under protest. Baxter immediately went to St. Johns’ Military Academy, where he began to gather his supporters and telegraphed President Ulysses S. Grant, requesting support from U.S. forces at the Little Rock Arsenal in his efforts to retake his office. By the next morning, he had gathered 200 men, and they moved to the Anthony House, just east of the capitol, and began to prepare to recapture the State House by force. From the Anthony House, Baxter proclaimed martial law in Pulaski County, naming Thomas P. Dockery military governor of Little Rock, and called on the state militia for support. Brooks, in turn, fortified the State House, using furniture to barricade windows and doors.

The next day, federal troops began building a barricade between the two sides to prevent further bloodshed. Baxter responded to the intervention of the army with a complaint to Grant that its presence prevented him from reclaiming his office. The federal force’s actions also may have convinced him that violence would not regain him his office. On April 22, he informed Grant that he intended to call the legislature into session to settle the rival claims. The same day, Grant replied that he approved any peaceful solution. The war continued, but after April 22, the real struggle for the office shifted to Washington DC. The last week of April, Attorney General George H. Williams began meetings with representatives of the two factions in Washington. Prominent Little Rock attorney Uriah M. Rose, along with Albert Pike and former senator Robert W. Johnson, presented the case for Baxter. Senators Clayton and Dorsey represented Brooks.\n\nThe two governors had earlier stated their intention to hold on to their office even if it required the shedding of blood. The rapid gathering of large groups of armed men in Little Rock practically guaranteed that. After the call for support by the two parties, military companies loyal to one or the other began arriving. By April 20, Baxter’s men numbered more than 1,000, and Brooks had mustered almost as many. By that day, Baxter’s supporters crowed that they were ready to move against the State House. With orders from Washington DC to prevent a clash, Colonel Thomas E.

On May 1, White dispersed Brooks supporters in Lincoln County and Arkansas County, and two days later, they fought another battle near Arkansas Post (Arkansas County), killing five more men. Several other confrontations would take place, with skirmishes on May 8 at Lonoke (Lonoke County) and at the mouth of Palarm Creek, where Baxter’s troops tried to stop delivery to Brooks of a shipment of weapons taken from Arkansas Industrial University—now the University of Arkansas (UA) in Fayetteville (Washington County). Later estimates put the number killed in all of these confrontations at more than 200.\n\nsettle the issue. On May 10, Baxter and Brooks agreed, although Baxter replied that he saw no reason for a special session because he had already called the legislature into session. Attorney General Williams agreed, but Brooks objected and declared he would not abide by any decision of the legislature. Seeing that there could be no compromise, Grant now asked his attorney general for a decision on who should be governor. After having heard the cases of the contending parties, Williams issued his opinion May 15. He said Baxter was the legal governor. That day, the president issued a proclamation indicating that because the legitimate government of Arkansas, Baxter’s, had asked for federal aid in suppressing insurrectionary forces, he would provide assistance and ordered all those opposed to the existing government to disperse.\n\nIn Little Rock, the situation also remained tense. Baxter’s supporters dug up a buried Civil War sixty-four-pounder cannon, repaired it, named it “the Lady Baxter,” and used it to threaten the opponent.

She served from 1932 to 1945 and was a strong supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s economic recovery legislation during the Great Depression.\n\nHattie Wyatt was born to William Carroll Wyatt and Lucy Burch Wyatt on February 1, 1878, near Bakersville, Tennessee. It is unknown how many siblings she had, though the 1900 Census shows four children living at her parents’ residence. When she was four, she moved with her family to Hustburg, Tennessee, where she helped on the family farm and in her father’s general store. She enrolled in Ebenezer College in Hustburg but later transferred to Dickson Normal College in Dickson, Tennessee, where she received a BA in 1896. After working several years as a schoolteacher in Tennessee, Wyatt married Thaddeus (Thad) Horatius Caraway of Clay County, Arkansas, a fellow Dickson graduate, on February 5, 1902. They settled in Jonesboro (Craighead County). She focused on taking care of the home and raising their three sons while her husband practiced law and began his political career. After he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1912, the family moved to Maryland. He represented Arkansas in the House from March 4, 1913, until March 3, 1921. After campaigning on issues that grew out of World War I, Thaddeus Caraway won 20\n\na Senate seat in 1920 and served in the Senate from March 4, 1921, until his unexpected death on November 6, 1931. On November 13, 1931, Arkansas governor Harvey Parnell appointed Caraway to fill the vacancy caused by her husband’s death. She was sworn in on December 8, 1931, and was confirmed in a special election on January 12, 1932, thus becoming the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate. On May 9, 1932, she became the first woman to preside over the Senate (when the vice president, Charles Curtis, was resting), and she took that opportunity to announce her intention to run for reelection, to the surprise of many who had not expected her to run. Caraway was reelected in 1932 after a campaign tour with Huey P. Long, the populist senator from Louisiana. Long was motivated by sympathy for Caraway’s being a widow as well as by his ambition to extend his influence into the home state of his rival, Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson. In 1938, Caraway ran for reelection against Congressman John L. McClellan, whose campaign slogan was “We need another man in the Senate,” and she won with the support of veterans, women, and union members. Caraway’s Senate career came to a close when she was defeated by J. William Fulbright in 1944. Her term ended on January 2, 1945. Caraway spoke on the Senate floor so infrequently that she became known as Silent Hattie. She believed in speaking briefly with well-chosen words and stated that she did not want to waste the taxpayers’ money on printing speeches in the Congressional Record. However, she often voiced her opinions in committee meetings. Caraway became the first woman to chair a Senate committee when she served as chair of the Senate Committee on Enrolled Bills from 1933 to 1944. She also requested and was assigned to the Agriculture Committee because of the importance of farming in her state. The committee governed flood control and the navigation of rivers, two issues also very relevant to Arkansas. A strong supporter of Roosevelt’s New Deal legislation, Caraway seconded his nomination for reelection at the 1936 Dem-\n\nocratic National Convention. In a rare speech to the Senate on relief and work-relief appropriations on May 25, 1938, Caraway stated, “My philosophy of legislation, and really on life, is to be broad-minded enough to consider human relationships and the well-being of all the people as worthy of consideration, to realize that all human beings are entitled to earn, so far as possible, their daily bread, and to try to prevent the exploitation of the underprivileged.” Occasionally Caraway did not support Roosevelt’s policies. Although she voiced her opinions about equality of human beings when it came to New Deal legislation, Caraway was a woman from the South, where commonly held political views did not always coincide with those of Roosevelt. In 1938, Caraway joined many southern senators in voting against anti–poll tax and anti-lynching legislation, both of which Caraway viewed as unconstitutional. She also opposed the repeal of Prohibition. Caraway was instrumental in securing Camp Robinson, Fort Chaffee, two Japanese relocation centers at Jerome (Drew and Chicot counties) and Rohwer (Desha County), five air bases, defense ordnance plants, and aluminum factories in Arkansas during World War II. Caraway also worked for the Equal Nationality Treaty of 1934, which extended to women numerous nationality rights previously limited to men. In 1943, she became the first woman in the Senate to cosponsor the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. After leaving the Senate, Caraway remained in Washington in other civil service positions. She served on the United States Employees’ Compensation Commission from 1945 to 1946 and on the Employees’ Compensation Appeals Board from 1946 until her death.

The Arkansas system mirrored that of other southern states during this period and reflected the desire to reduce the cost and administrative problems of the state’s prisons. While the system achieved its economic goals, it was typified by corruption and the abuse of prisoners, problems that ultimately brought about its abolition.\n\nAnother major change in the nature of the convict lease system came in 1883. In the lease negotiated that year, Arkansas adopted the practice of other southern states by requiring the lessee to pay the state for convict labor. The lease became a major source of income for the state, making the system particularly difficult to eliminate. The 1883 lease was secured by J. P. Townshend and L. A. Fitzpatrick, Helena (Phillips County) planters, who later maintained the contract with Met L. Jones as a corporation, the Arkansas Industrial Company. The Arkansas Industrial Company continued to give work to some inmates at the prison, but hundreds were sent outside the walls to work for subcontractors. An 1890 prison report indicated that those working in camps around the state were laboring on plantations, building railroads, and mining coal in the Coal Hill (Johnson County) area of western Arkansas.\n\nIn Arkansas, the convict lease system originated during the Reconstruction era when, in 1867, the state contracted with the firm of Hodges, Peay, and Ayliff to provide work for prisoners in the penitentiary at Little Rock (Pulaski County). The state agreed to pay the company thirty-five cents a day for the convicts’ support and also purchased the machinery to establish a factory within the prison. Managing the prison apparently was lucrative, and until 1873, several other individuals secured the management contract, including Asa Hodges, a Little Rock brick and wagon manufacturer and prominent Republican politician, who took over the prisons in 1869. Typically, the prison lessee not only provided work within the prison walls but also subcontracted prisoners to work throughout the area.\n\nThe convict lease system led to considerable corruption. In its early days, lessees took state payments and put little into the maintenance of prisoners. Later, contractors and subcontractors saw prison labor as a means of securing cheap workers who did not need to be provided proper care. Problems became so great that in 1888, a legislative committee investigated conditions at the Coal Hill camp; beginning in 1890, a prison inspector visited and reported on conditions in all of the camps. These examinations indicated that prisoners suffered from overcrowding, inadequate food and housing, and insufficient clothing. Health and hygiene facilities were non-existent. In addition, prisoners were subjected to violent physical punishment and abuse by the guards. Contractors also failed to provide security for the prison camps, and escapes became commonplace.\n\nIn 1873, as Reconstruction was coming to an end, the state legislature revised its program of prison leases and ended payments made to the lessee to support the prisoners. That year’s contract with John M. Peck and his silent partner, Colonel Zebulon Ward, leased prisoners to Peck and required that the lessee furnish labor, food, clothing, and housing for them. The state was to have no expenses. In 1875, Ward bought out Peck and held the prison contract until 1883. Ward profited greatly from his contract, benefiting from the rapid increase in the state’s prison population from 1876 to 1882 after the legislature’s passage in 1875 of a law that made the theft of any property worth two dollars or more punishable by one to five years in prison. Ward also received the contract to expand the state prison, using convict labor.\n\nConcern with conditions in the camps became an issue in state politics after 1888, with farmer movements such as the Agricultural Wheel and the Farmers’ Alliance, along with the Knights of Labor, calling for the end of the system. The legislature made an 22\n\ninitial attempt to improve circumstances in 1893 when it did not renew the lease to the Arkansas Industrial Company. Unfortunately, state financial resources were inadequate to create a system that allowed the state to take over full maintenance of the prisoners. Instead, while the state assumed control over the inmates, it began its own subcontracting system by placing prisoners on farms as sharecroppers, at work on the railroads, and in other business enterprises around the state. All the abuses seen in 1888 and 1890 continued as the state placed its prisoners under the control of private contractors, and in 1909, Governor George Donaghey, elected as a progressive Democrat, asked for the lease system to be abolished in his first message to the legislature. Legislators favored the reform but refused to appropriate the money necessary to create a prison farm big enough to employ all of the state’s prisoners. In 1912, Donaghey resolved to end the system and determined how many prisoners could be placed on the existing state farm near Grady (Lincoln County); he then paroled enough prisoners to reduce the population to that number.\n\npurchase of land for a larger prison farm in Jefferson County, now known as the Tucker Unit, formally halted the leases the next year.\n\nDonaghey had effectively ended the system, although the legislature’s\n\nCarl H. Moneyhon University of Arkansas at Little Rock Politics\n\nCrittenden County Expulsion of 1888\n\nIn July 1888, a group of influential white citizens in Crittenden County expelled from the county a number of prominent African-American citizens and county officials. Apparently weary of the fusion governments that had prevailed there for years, as well as fearful of the outcome of the upcoming September and November elections, they hoped their actions would intimidate black voters and ensure a victory for white Democrats.\n\nInstead, on the morning of July 12, several prominent white citizens—among them Judge S. A. Martin, Sheriff W. F. Werner, Colonel J. F. Smith, Dr. W. M. Bingham, and L. P. Berry, all of whom had attended the Memphis meeting—reported that they had received anonymous letters asking them to leave the county. A group of armed whites came to the courthouse and ordered Lewis, Ferguson, and Ferguson’s deputy, J. L. Flemming, to leave the building. The three were told about the letters and asked to leave the county. Ferguson replied that he knew nothing about the letters and asked that the circuit court investigate the accusations. According to the Contested Election Case of Featherston[e] v. Cate, a person in the infuriated crowd declared, “God damn you, you’ve got to leave this county, this is a white man’s government and we are tired of negro dominance; we have been planning this for the past two years, and no more Negroes or Republicans shall hold office in this county.”\n\nFollowing the Civil War, land agents began to recruit black laborers from around the South to work in the cotton fields. By 1870, the black population in Crittenden County had reached sixty-seven percent, leading to the emergence of a black middle class tied to the Republican Party. After 1874, when the Democratic Party returned to power, Crittenden County, like several other black majority counties in the state, ran elections under a “fusion agreement,” in which political parties met prior to the election and allotted certain offices to Democrats and others to Republicans, with concurrence that the candidates put up by each party would run unopposed. However, Democratic-led voter fraud, as well as racial tensions, were on the rise in the county. By 1880, the county population was eight percent African American.\n\nA group of seventy-five to 100 armed whites also rounded up a number of the county’s other prominent African Americans, forcing eleven of them at gunpoint to go to Memphis. After everyone had been expelled, white citizens searched homes, businesses, and lodge halls for weapons and ammunition. None were found. This first action was followed by a second wave of expulsions, focusing more on prominent citizens and black Republicans who owned property. Among these were York Byers, who owned 200 acres of land, and Jim Devers, a member of the Agricultural Wheel, a third-party organization. Black men began disappearing from the fields and going into hiding.\n\nEarly in the summer of 1888, a group of approximately twenty-five of Crittenden County’s white citizens met in Memphis, Tennessee, to formulate a plan to rid the county of its black officials. According to the New York Times, during the first week of July “a half dozen prominent planters” were reportedly “notified through their colored servants that their lives were in danger, as the negroes were determined to drive the white people out of the county or kill them.” In response, the county’s whites armed themselves with Winchester rifles procured in Memphis. Meanwhile, the county judge D. W. Lewis and the county clerk David Ferguson, both black, had been indicted for public drunkenness, and the trial was to be held on July 12. The trial, however, never took place.\n\nBy July 15, the Times was reporting that the “race war” had ended. The situation was far from over, however. By July 16, Ferguson, county assessor J. R. Rooks, and O. W. Mitchum were in Little Rock to present Governor Simon Hughes with a petition, signed by seventeen other exiles, asking him for protection so they could return to the county. The governor took no action but 24\n\nexecution would not safely be intrusted [sic] either to a set of midnight conspirators or to a lot of armed and excited citizens.” By July 24, the grand jury issued indictments against the nineteen African Americans they believed had conspired to produce the anonymous letters. No indictments were handed down against white citizens who had driven African Americans from the county. According to the Times, although there had been rumors about subsequent lynchings and trouble between blacks and whites in Marion: “The county has been quiet as a millpond since the drunken negro officials and their fellow conspirators were compelled to take ‘French leave.’” There were continued efforts on the part of whites to disrupt the upcoming September elections. Attempts were made to interfere with the county’s Republican convention. The new Democratic county judge appointed all Democrats to be election judges. This, coupled with the fact that Democrats held all major county offices, made it possible for the Democrats to intimidate voters and effectively control the election process. Despite all this effort, however, the Union Labor Party still carried the county with fifty-four percent of the vote in the September gubernatorial election. The November elections were also marked by fraud. According to the official results, the Democratic candidate defeated Lewis Porter Featherstone in the race for the First Congressional District. Featherstone contested the results, and the U.S. House of Representatives found evidence of fraud and intimidation and awarded him the seat in February 1890. instead filled all vacant county offices with white Democrats. Within days, according to the New York Times, Judge J. E. Riddick had charged a grand jury “to discover and indict for conspiracy the persons who sent the threatening letters to white citizens of the county, which gave rise to the recent race troubles,” adding, “There is no such punishment as expatriation known to the laws of this country, and even if there were, its\n\nIn the long run, the Crittenden County expulsion failed to quash African-American participation in the electoral process. Black candidates, including state representative George W. Watson, continued to be elected until statewide disenfranchisement laws were enacted in the mid-1890s. Nancy Snell Griffith Clinton, South Carolina Politics\n\nElection Fraud\n\nQuestionable balloting procedures and fraudulent vote counts began early in Arkansas’s political history and were a regular component of the state’s politics, especially in rural areas, until about 1970. The state’s tradition of one-party rule in which consequential elections were decided in party primaries, the absence of unbiased political information in the form of independent newspapers, and a traditionalistic political culture in which the activities of the ruling elite were generally unquestioned by the masses all contributed to an environment in which fraud—fundamentally problematic for a representative democracy—could persist. Such fraudulent behavior in Arkansas had its roots in the politics of “The Family,” the Democratic regime that controlled the state’s politics in the period following statehood. This Johnson-Conway-Sevier-Rector cousinhood accumulated 190 years of public office-holding, including two U.S. senators and three governors in antebellum Arkansas. Other offices went only to their partisans, and the Family’s control of all aspects of the election machinery in the state made that control easier. For instance, U.S. senator Ambrose Sevier, about to be caught up in a public bank scandal in the early 1840s, was quickly reelected by the state legislature before an investigation of his impropriety could come to light. The fraud of this era created a norm that would follow even after the Family’s political demise.\n\n26\n\nIn the Reconstruction era, election fraud continued, most tellingly in the conflicted 1872 gubernatorial election between Elisha Baxter and Joseph Brooks that culminated in what came to be called the Brooks-Baxter War. Fraud intensified when the Redeemers, the Democrats who returned to political power in the state following the Reconstruction era, felt threatened elector-\n\nally by a fusion of Republicans and Populists during the 1880s. The most consequential election in the state during this period was the governor’s election of 1888 in which an allied group of political factions supported Charles M. Norwood, the gubernatorial candidate of the dissident Union Labor Party, against Democrat James P. Eagle. By the standards of states accustomed to closely competitive general elections, the attempt was an abject failure. Eagle received 99,229 votes to the 84,273 votes cast for Norwood. For those unaccustomed to genuine competition, however, this election was ominously close, especially because of the amount of fraud that had been necessary to secure even this “narrow” victory. A congressional election in the central portion of the state between Democrat Clifton R. Breckenridge and John Clayton, running as a Republican, resulted in an even more marginal (and even more dubious) Democratic victory. When Clayton attempted to provoke a federal investigation into the voting process, he was murdered in Plumerville (Conway County). These events were followed by “electoral reform” in the form of an 1891 state law. Especially considering the fraud, thuggery, and violence that had come to characterize the election process, the Election Reform Act of 1891 had some genuinely laudable provisions for those with a normative preference for clean elections. One element of the law, for example, prohibited the last-minute transfer of polling places. However, the two most important provisions of the statute were obviously intended to ensure the future electoral fortunes of the Democratic establishment. One effectively turned over all the state’s election machinery to the Democratic Party, with only token representation for minority parties. The other disfranchised illiterates (over onefourth of the population at that time) by removing all political symbols from the ballot and providing that only the precinct judges (all Democrats) could assist illiterates in preparing their ballots. During this period, the legislature also initiated a state constitutional amendment that placed a one-dollar poll tax on the “privilege” of voting, and in 1892 (by which time the 1891 reforms\n\nwere in effect), this amendment was ratified. While scholars debate the extent to which these changes reflected a genuinely reformist impulse in reaction to the flagrant election abuses that had become commonplace, there can be no dispute over the resulting dramatic decline in voting—from 191,448 participants in the 1890 election to 129,337 in 1900—nor about the growing importance of local political leaders with an ability to “deliver” the votes in their geographical enclaves. According to V. O. Key, the foremost scholar on the politics of the South during this period, “These local potentates loom larger in Arkansas than in most southern states.” In the absence of party competition to clarify issue differences and of mass technology for reaching the voters, a statewide contest depended largely upon lining up the support of local leaders, often housed in county courthouses or city halls, who could corral their area’s vote. The foremost function of any statewide campaign manager was to line up these local bosses, and in many instances it was necessary to bargain on the basis of a quid pro quo. One gubernatorial campaign manager of the 1940s recalls, “Some wanted jobs, some wanted roads, some wanted both—but they all wanted something.” Many also expected a cash payment, euphemistically called “walking-around money.” Virtually any statewide contest was tainted by the tactics necessary to ensure victory in certain counties, and despite numerous charges of fraud by the losers and occasional court challenges, the courts were generally as inclined as the citizenry to look the other way. Southern politics scholar Boyce Drummond, writing in 1957, concluded that “at least three gubernatorial races, two United States Senatorial races, and one Congressional race since 1930 were decided by corrupt practices.” Key concluded that while “Tennessee has the most consistent and widespread habit of fraud,” Arkansas was “a close second.” Despite a law requiring such, there were almost no voting booths in Arkansas until the late 1960s; thus, real or perceived intimidation of voters by poll workers appointed to their posts by the local leaders generally achieved the desired goal. Other,\n\nPolitics\n\nmore entrepreneurial, voters asked for something in return for their votes. In Newton County, for example, it was traditional to wait outside the courthouse on election day until one got the “highest dollar” and then a congratulatory slug of whiskey afterward. However, should such practices prove insufficient, there remained the infinite possibilities of outright fraud: deliberate defacement and subsequent discarding of ballots as they were counted and wholesale destruction (through burning, trashing, and even, in one instance, eating) of ballots if necessary. Absentee ballots were particularly susceptible to such fraudulent acts. Perhaps most troubling was the role of poll tax receipts, the voters’ ticket to the voting process, in electoral shenanigans. Savvy politicians learned to monitor the poll tax for citizens who failed to meet the deadline for payment and pay the tax (and receive the receipt) for the prospective voters. Unless challenged, anyone could vote who showed the poll tax receipt and signed the election register. It was not uncommon for a single person to cast multiple votes as proxies using such receipts, thus giving a local potentate immense electoral power.\n\ning experts provided evidence that the same hand had signed for all the receipts. Within months, McLaughlin was on his way to prison, and his electoral machine was broken. The GI Revolt, seen in other counties along with Garland, sensitized Arkansans to the shame of widespread, casual election fraud and the desirability of honestly conducted elections. McMath rode his role as the leader of the movement to the governorship in 1948. Despite his success at the state level, electoral fraud in the state did not end. Indeed, in his six victories in gubernatorial races starting in 1954, Governor Orval Faubus developed an immensely powerful statewide machine. Thus, as Winthrop Rockefeller began to build a state Republican Party to challenge the Faubus-controlled Democratic Party, he saw electoral reform in the state as an essential element. After his loss to Faubus in the 1964 governor’s race, Rockefeller funded the Election Research Council that worked with the League of Women Voters to gather the data that would justify major reform. The investigators found that a majority of absentee ballots cast in 1964 in the state were invalid, and they uncovered clear evidence of election-day fraud at polling places around the state.\n\nBased on local mores and the perceived stakes of the outcomes of statewide elections, these kinds of practices were much more widespread and flagrant in some localities than in others. Perhaps the leader in electoral corruption was Garland County, where the sustainability of illegal gambling operations absolutely necessitated a compliant state political establishment and where Leo McLaughlin controlled Garland County politics from his seat as mayor of Hot Springs. Sidney McMath and other leaders of the so-called GI Revolt returned home after World War II and challenged McLaughlin’s control. In the 1946 Democratic primary, McLaughlin used control of poll taxes to defeat the GI slate of candidates except McMath, who was elected prosecutor. In the fall general election, those who had been denied election in the primary all ran as independents. Included on the ticket was an independent candidate for Congress, important because it allowed a challenge of the poll tax issue in federal court. An investigation of the record showed that poll tax receipts had been issued in alphabetical order in every city ward. Handwrit-\n\nWhen elected governor, Rockefeller fought for reforms such as private balloting. But, more than reformed laws, factors such as a change in public expectations about the sanctity of the vote, a vibrant two-party system, and an independent press that could uncover problematic electoral practices ultimately undermined fraud in the state. While the mechanics of voting continue to be dogged by problems in each election cycle in parts of the state and disputes still arise about the interpretation of state election laws, these clearly are not the purposeful shenanigans seen as recently as the early 1970s. Governor Mike Huckabee’s statement on Don Imus’s nationally syndicated radio program just before the 2000 election—that Arkansas was a “banana republic” rife with “ballot fraud”—was seen even by his own partisans as undeniably hyperbolic. Jay Barth Hendrix College 28\n\nThe Family\n\n“The Family”—or “The Dynasty”—was the name given to a powerful group of Democrats who dominated Arkansas politics in the years between statehood and the Civil War. The roots of the Family stretched back into the territorial period, when it coalesced around territorial delegate Henry Conway, the scion of a wealthy Tennessee family. In 1827, Conway was mortally wounded in a duel with Territorial Secretary Robert Crittenden, his former patron and the most powerful political figure in Arkansas in the territorial era. The killing of Conway exacerbated the schism in Arkansas politics between Crittenden and his supporters, who made up the basis for the Whig Party in Arkansas, and the followers of the slain Conway, staunch Democrats and supporters of Andrew Jackson, who portrayed themselves as champions of the common man. Among the latter group were Conway’s younger brother James; his cousins, Elias and Wharton Rector; and another cousin, Ambrose Sevier. Sevier was elected to the remainder of Henry Conway’s term and served in that capacity until Arkansas became a state in 1836. On September 27, 1827, he married Juliette Johnson, the daughter of Benjamin Johnson, a Superior Court judge for the Arkansas Territory. Since many members of the group were related by blood or by marriage, the political alliance of Conways, Rectors, Sevier, and Johnson soon came to be referred to as “The Family.” The results of the first state elections in 1836 confirmed the Family’s dominance in Arkansas politics. James Conway was elected the state’s first governor, Ambrose Sevier was chosen by the state legislature to be one of the state’s first U.S. senators, and Benjamin Johnson was appointed by President Andrew Jackson to be the state’s first federal district judge. That same year, Benjamin Johnson’s brother, Richard M. Johnson, was elected vice president of the United States on a ticket with Martin Van Buren.\n\nIn the late antebellum period, a second generation of Family politicians emerged. Foremost among them were Benjamin Johnson’s son, Robert Ward Johnson, who served the state as a congressman and later as a U.S. senator, and Elias Conway, the youngest brother of Henry and James, who served two terms as governor between 1852 and 1860. Ironically, the end of the Family’s domination of Arkansas politics came in 1860 at the hands of Henry Massie Rector, the son of Family member Elias Rector and blood relative of the Conways and Sevier. In the gubernatorial election of that year, Rector challenged Family candidate Richard H. Johnson. Following a bitter campaign in which the Family’s long-time dominance of Arkansas politics was a central theme, Rector defeated Johnson by almost 3,000 votes. It was the first significant defeat for a Family politician since statehood. Robert Ward Johnson later served in the Confederate Senate, but Rector’s victory and the coming of the Civil War effectively ended the Family’s domination of Arkansas politics. Thomas A. DeBlack Arkansas Tech University\n\nPolitics\n\nFeatherstone v. Cate\n\nIn the Arkansas election of 1888, Agricultural Wheel members and other groups formed the Union Labor Party and allied with the Republicans to offer a serious challenge to the Democrats. In 1889, the Featherstone v. Cate congressional hearings resulted from allegations of election fraud in the race for U.S. representative from Arkansas’s First Congressional District, a district comprising seventeen eastern counties including Craighead, Crittenden, Cross, Lee, Phillips, and St. Francis. In 1888, the race for first district representative pitted Independent candidate Lewis P. Featherstone of Forrest City (St. Francis County) against Democratic judge William Henderson Cate of Jonesboro (Craighead County). Initially, the election results showed Cate the winner with 15,576 votes to Featherstone’s 14,238. In late November 1888, Featherstone, alleging fraud in Crittenden, Cross, Lee, Phillips, and St. Francis counties, announced his contest of the election. Among those counties where Featherstone alleged fraud, only in Cross did Cate receive a majority of votes over him. Featherstone garnered a majority of votes over Cate in St. Francis County, as well as in the black-majority, heavily Republican counties of Crittenden, Lee, and Phillips. Featherstone apparently believed that his margin would have been larger had election fraud not occurred.\n\n30\n\nThe Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives held the case hearings in 1889. A majority of the House Elections Committee ruled that there was “[sufficient] evidence…to establish a conspiracy to defraud in Crittenden County,” citing a pre-election purge of the African-American Republican county officers. In July 1888, the white Democratic Crittenden County sheriff had led a group of armed whites who gained control of the county\n\ngovernment by forcibly removing the black Republican county officers from office. State election law required the county court to appoint three election judges, representing different political parties, to preside over elections in each township. The House committee ruled that the July purge enabled the Crittenden County Democrats to appoint all Democratic election judges. In November 1888, the Democratic election judges in Crittenden County utilized fraudulent ballot boxes in the heavily Republican Scanlin, Cat Island, and Crawfordsville townships and held no elections in the Idlewild and Furgeson townships. The House committee also cited voting irregularities in Phillips County, which further reduced Cate’s majority over Featherstone. In his notice of contest, Featherstone, noting that he received only eighty-nine votes to Cate’s 224 in Lee County’s Independence Township, alleged that the Democratic election officers there had committed fraud. The House committee reported that, after giving testimony, a witness from Independence Township was “arrested for perjury and placed under $1,000 bond to answer to the state court.” Cate’s lawyer then claimed that he would have arrested anyone he believed to have testified falsely on Featherstone’s behalf. Accusing Cate’s lawyer of witness intimidation, the House committee ruled that Cate “must lose 224 votes returned for him, and [Featherstone] must be allowed 3 more votes than were returned for him.”\n\nsas Gazette insisted that Featherstone “now sits in Judge Cate’s seat…and is probably mentally the weakest man ever admitted to a seat in Congress.” While in Congress, Featherstone earned even more enmity among Arkansas Democrats when he voted for the hated Lodge elections or “force” bill, which would have authorized federal supervision of southern elections to ensure that African Americans voted freely. In 1890, Featherstone ran for reelection to Congress as a Union Laborite. He lost to Cate, although—as in 1888—he garnered a majority of votes in Crittenden, Lee, Phillips, and St. Francis counties. In November 1890, the Arkansas Gazette happily announced that “all Jonesboro is wild with enthusiasm tonight over [Cate’s] great victory.” The Featherstone v. Cate hearings, by highlighting the extent of election fraud in Arkansas, testified to the seriousness of the interracial third-party challenge to Democratic dominance in the late nineteenth century. Melanie Welch Mayflower, Arkansas\n\nIn his home county of St. Francis, Featherstone alleged that the Democratic election officers in Franks Township had committed fraud. He also alleged fraud in St. Francis County’s Blackfish Township, where no election was held in November 1888. In 1888, tension was high between Democrats and Union Laborites in the county. During the September 1888 election, three black Republicans and three white Union Laborites had won the county offices, and a shooting in the heavily black Franks Township had wounded a group of politically active Democrats. Finally, the House determined that Featherstone was elected representative by a majority of eighty-six votes, and he was seated in Congress in March 1890. The outraged Democratic ArkanPolitics\n\ngraduated from high school in Hot Springs, a city in which he had observed firsthand how the McLaughlin organization controlled almost every aspect of the local government. After World War II, he took up a pledge to challenge the political leadership of the spa city. In 1946, McMath filed in the Democratic Party primary for prosecuting attorney of the Eighteenth Judicial District, which included Garland and Montgomery counties, and recruited fellow veteran Clyde Brown to file for district judge with jurisdiction over the same two counties. Before the filing period closed, the two GIs had succeeded in recruiting candidates for each of the elected offices. However, while the “reformers” shared a common interest in defeating the entrenched incumbents, they were not ideologically united. Some had been interested in seeking public office long before the GI Revolt was organized, and they used the new anti-establishment group as a means to advance their ambitions. The call for reform in Hot Springs was based in part on two official reports. The first came from a 1942 federal grand jury report that found that Garland County election officials had ignored and/or violated most of the state’s election laws in the elections of that year. Another grand jury report released while the 1946 primary campaign was in progress noted that graft and corruption had permeated the public school system, as well as the business, religious, and social activities in the city. Citing these abuses as evidence of a clear need for reform, the GIs used their military training to organize every voting precinct in Garland and Montgomery counties, working in pairs to reduce possible harassment from the opposition.\n\nGI Revolt\n\nThe political reform movement known as the GI Revolt emerged during the county political campaigns of 1946. Typically associated with World War II veterans eager to bring change to their hometowns and the state of Arkansas, the movement actually was broader than just military service veterans and had somewhat of a statewide impact. The term “GI” was shorthand for “Government Improvement” (a play on the term GI—General Issue, i.e., enlisted men—because many involved in the movement were returning GIs and officers), and the movement had an identifiable organization in six counties: Cleveland, Crittenden, Garland, Montgomery, Pope, and Yell, as well as the city of Pine Bluff (Jefferson County). Most attention on the GI Revolt has focused on Hot Springs and the rest of Garland County. There, hometown war hero Sidney Sanders (Sid) McMath organized fellow World War II veterans to challenge the political leadership of Mayor Leo P. McLaughlin and key city and county elected officials. McMath\n\n32\n\nA number of other counties had earned a reputation as “machine counties,” which meant the political offices were controlled by selected individuals who used a variety of tactics to gain and maintain office. Key among the “control” devices was the poll tax receipt. To be eligible to vote in a party primary, one had to show evidence of having paid a poll tax. For the general election in November, voters could pay the poll tax up to twenty days before the election. Savvy politicians had learned to monitor tax records and pay the poll tax for those citizens who\n\nfailed to meet the deadline. Unless challenged, any individual could vote simply by showing the poll tax receipt and signing the election register. It was not uncommon in many counties for a single individual to cast multiple votes as proxies using poll tax receipts. To challenge a vote’s legitimacy, the challenger was required to file a petition and present evidence of fraud with a state court—or federal court if the dispute involved a candidate for federal office. In Garland County, McLaughlin and his allies used the poll tax as a way to defeat everyone on the GI ticket except McMath in the Democratic primary. Believing that their defeat had been engineered by fraudulent use of poll tax receipts, the GIs filed as independent candidates to run in the November general election. Included on the ticket was Pat Mullis—not a veteran but a friend and law school classmate of McMath—who filed for the Fourth Congressional District position. Mullis then filed a lawsuit in Arkansas Western District Court on behalf of his fellow “independents,” claiming poll tax receipts had been illegally issued and used. While collecting evidence for the trial, GI supporters found that in every city ward, poll tax receipts had been issued in alphabetical order, sometimes eighteen names to a block. Moreover, the signatures for each block of names appeared to be in the handwriting of a single individual. Judge John Miller ruled in favor of the GIs, noting in part that individuals organizing in alphabetical order and presenting themselves to the county clerk to pay their poll tax was a statistical improbability. Also, the testimony of an expert witness from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation saying that the signatures were in the same handwriting was sufficient proof to allow Judge Miller to issue an order setting aside almost twenty-four percent of the poll tax receipts issued for the primary election. Motivated by their court victory, the GI independents mounted an aggressive campaign for the general election. Organizing a new “poll tax drive,” they encouraged citizens to pay their own poll tax and be prepared to vote in November. Their efforts were\n\nrewarded in spectacular fashion. When the results were tabulated, the GI ticket had won every seat in Garland County. Results from the GI tickets in the other five counties were not so clearly delineated. While a number of war veterans campaigning as reform candidates did get elected to public office in 1946, there was no definable pattern to their success, and as was the tradition in Arkansas politics, the personality of the candidate and local circumstances typically determined election outcomes. Moreover, in Garland County in particular, almost half of the candidates elected on the GI ticket in 1946 were themselves criticized for using public office for personal gain within a decade after their initial election. McMath tried, with some success, to extend his good government influence beyond Hot Springs by inviting fellow GIs to join the Young Democrats organization. He also used the publicity he gained from challenging the McLaughlin organization to launch a successful campaign for governor in 1948. As governor, McMath moved away from local government improvement issues and focused more on matters of statewide interest. By 1950, the GI Revolt was in disarray. Organized initially to work for “honest government,” the leadership failed to develop a broad-based agenda and was unable to negate the corruptive practices of the poll tax. Arkansas’s more than 200,000 World War II veterans were never able to become a cohesive unit. While most had either witnessed first hand, or at least been informed of, the totalitarian practices of Germany, Italy, and Japan, few related those practices to their own counties and hometowns. Moreover, during the 1950s and 1960s, new “McLaughlin-like” organizations emerged in various parts of the state. It was not until the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolished the poll tax in federal elections that a measure of political reform was restored in the state. The GI Revolt lacked sufficient clarity on what constituted good government and was too localized to be considered a real revolt. C. Fred Williams University of Arkansas at Little Rock\n\nPolitics\n\nMarlin Hawkins\n\na two-and-a-half-year hiatus from March 1943 to September 1945 to serve in the U.S. Army at Camp Robinson in North Little Rock (Pulaski County). Hawkins had persuaded the local draft board to draft him in spite of his lost eye. He was then placed in a position of restricted service, where he performed a variety of clerical duties.\n\n(1913–1995)\n\nMarlin Conover Hawkins served Conway County as an elected official for thirty-eight years. His ability to deliver votes to statewide and national candidates gave Hawkins a profile in state politics that was rare for a county official. His political machine is an important part of Arkansas’s political lore, and the effects of his political contacts are still evident in Conway County.\n\nIn 1946, and again in 1948, Hawkins won election as the county treasurer. His dominance of the absentee voting in those elections revealed an important tool that became part of Hawkins’s machine. His supporters studied the electoral procedures to identify and use processes such as absentee voting to their advantage. Hawkins’s supporters could identify the voters that would be sympathetic, aid them in receiving an absentee ballot, and then have the extra benefit of knowing the ballot had been mailed before election day. These tactics also first raised fraud accusations that followed Hawkins throughout his public life. In 1950, when Hawkins won the Democratic nomination for sheriff by 218 votes, his opponent, Sheriff Elmer Thomas, charged Hawkins with fraud in the applications for absentee ballots. Hawkins had dominated the absentee return, 253 to 49. When his petition to contest the election was overruled, Thomas ran against Hawkins as an independent candidate in the general election, only to lose again. Hawkins began the first of twenty-eight years as the Conway County sheriff and collector.\n\nMarlin Hawkins was born on April 22, 1913, near Center Ridge (Conway County) to John Carl and Nettie Mae Hawkins; John Carl Hawkins, a sharecropper and part-time barber, died in 1929. As the second of seven children, part of the burden of supporting the family fell on Hawkins. He worked as a sharecropper and part-time janitor until Olen Fullerton, a family friend, encouraged him to enroll in a nine-month college course in bookkeeping at Harding College, then located in Morrilton (Conway County). In 1934, Hawkins landed his first government job as a bookkeeper with the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). In 1935, he became the Conway County Welfare Board’s first case worker as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). He would stay in government service for the rest of his professional career. By the age of twenty-two, Hawkins knew the daily struggles that rural Arkansans faced in the Depression, as well as the importance of help from friends. Hawkins combined his energy, his rural roots, and his new position on the Conway County Welfare Board to find jobs and government aid for the people in his district. He joked in his autobiography about turning his “blind eye” (he had lost it at the age of eight) to the livestock that belonged to some of the people he helped. The less he reported of a family’s possessions, the more the family received in government assistance. Hawkins credits the gratitude of many of the people he helped for his 1940 victory to his first elected office, the Conway County circuit clerk and recorder. He held that office for six years, with\n\n34\n\nHawkins had crafted a highly effective political machine that was built on his personal contacts with people throughout the county. His position on the welfare board had allowed him to direct government assistance, and as sheriff, he still had access to contacts that could provide direct aid, employment, or other forms of charitable aid. Before each election, people he knew received a letter in which Hawkins personally endo"
