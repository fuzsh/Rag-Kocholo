Their trial heard Johnson was the hitman who was caught on CCTV chasing Butler, and Austin was the getaway driver. Their first trial was halted after a House of Lords ruled in an unrelated case that it was illegal for any witness to give evidence without the defence knowing who they were. Five witnesses had given evidence anonymously and the judge stopped the trial as the prosecution case was about to close. Questions were asked in Parliament following the collapse of the trial and four-year investigation, which cost £6m. The 2008 Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act, which secured anonymity of witnesses, was rushed through in the July. The five witnesses agreed to give evidence again and were able to keep their anonymity. A second trial, costing £2m, went ahead last April but the jury was unable to agree verdicts. The final trial, costing £1m, began in Feb 2010. One witness told the trial Johnson said he had been recruited for the job by Mr Butler’s wife, Yvonne, and her daughter Marcia. Johnson had said Marcia had told him Mr Butler had sexually molested her when she had been younger and her mother had offered £5,000 for him to be killed, the jury heard. It emerged during the trials that Marcia Butler, who had been living with Austin’s brother Ricky, was also having an affair with his other brother, Peter. Mrs Butler and her daughter have never been charged in connection with the murder. Butler’s neighbour Jennifer Long told the trial he had been involved in crime, as well as other activities such as wheelclamping and evicting gypsies from council land. Ms Long refused to answer questions about Butler’s relationship with a former police officer, Detective Constable Chris Cubitt. But prosecutor Nigel Rumfitt QC read out a statement she had made in which she said Mr Butler had told her Mr Cubitt was a “corrupt police officer” who was involved in robberies and bringing in “illegals” (illegal immigrants). Ms Long told police Mr Butler had told her Mr Cubitt was “trying to stitch him up” and he said he was going to tell a senior police officer all about Mr Cubitt’s activities. Defence lawyers also sought to point the finger at a man called Richard Cabby, who suffered fatal injuries after being attacked on Christmas Day 2005.
