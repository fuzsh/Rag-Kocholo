        "text": "Guy Williams was born on January 14, 1924, as Armand Joseph Catalano (called by the Italian version of his name, “Armando,” by his family) of Sicilian parentage, in the Washington Heights area in New York City.\n\nSo he was Italian playing a Spanish Zorro and later he got lost in space. I wonder what they called him on the set?\n\nSidney Toler, was Scotish.\n\nMichael Ansara came to the United States with his American parents at the age of two, from Syria. He played an Indian in Broken Arrow. He was married to Barbara Eden who played Genie."
