        "text": "1919 Pawnee Chief - Pawnee County, OK\n\nPawnee Co: Pawnee Newspapers 1919\n\nby Rita Buford [email protected]\n\nWith Permission From D. Jo Ferguson, Publisher Of Pawnee Chief\n\nFebruary 27, 1919 Pawnee Courier-Dispatch and Times-Democrat\n\nReport of Death Is Exaggerated\n\nEmmett CARRION, a son of Joe CARRION of Pawnee, recently returned after an absence of nearly eleven years. He ran away from the Chilocco Indian School when a small boy, and no word was ever received from him, until his unexpected return just a few days ago.\n\nHe was somewhat surprised to find that the records of the County Court contained proof of his death, and that his estate in this county had been administered. He insisted however, that with all due deference to the infallibility of our Courts, they were for once in error, and at once proceeded to file a motion to set aside the administration and strike the word \"deceased\" from his description in the court records.\n\nThe case is set for hearing March 5th, at which time Emmett will try to convince the court that he is not now, nor ever was dead, and that for the reason the decree declaring him dead, and the administration of his property should be vacated and set aside and held for naught.\n\nEmmett, being a healthy and vigorous young man of 23 years, who is just out of the service of the United States, has no fear but the fact of his being alive can be established. At least he hopes to show that the report of his death is somewhat exaggerated.\n\nHe Got The Bacon\n\nA.E. UNDERWOOD, of near Dixie, was in Pawnee Friday, and told us that Thursday night someone robbed his smoke house of all of his summers meat and ninety pounds of lard. At the price of meat and lard, this was almost as serious as robbing a bank. Getting help to look for it, wagon tracks were discovered near the smoke house and upon further search, it was found to be a Negro that had worked for Mr. UNDERWOOD. They followed him to Tulsa, where they found the man with a jar of lard on his shoulder, going to sell it. Sheriff MCINTYRE was sent for and the man and all of the meat but one ham, and all except seven pounds of the lard was captured. The sheriff brought him back to Pawnee, where he will stay for a while.\n\nBound Over To Next Term of District Court - Dave JACKSON, colored, arrested last week on the charge of burglary, was given a preliminary hearing before Judge VERNE this morning. He was bound over to district court for trial.\n\nEntertained\n\nMrs. J.L. LEHEW entertained Mrs. TANSY, Mrs. ROBINSON and Mrs. LILLIE at her home Saturday, in honor of her mother, Mrs. HUTCHINSON's 82nd birthday. The occasion was a perfect surprise to Mrs. HUTCHINSON, and not until the last guest had arrived did she realize that it was her party. A splendid luncheon was served and the ladies enjoyed themselves very much.\n\nUp-To-Dates Entertain\n\nOn February 14th, the ladies of the Up-To-Date Club entertained their husbands at the lovely home of Mr. and Mrs. John DONAHY. The evening was spent in playing games and with music, after which, delicious refreshments consisting of hot biscuits, chicken salad, olives, coffee, cake and ice cream were enjoyed. The cake and ice cream was pink and white, the color scheme of the evening. The home was beautifully decorated. Those present were Judge and Mrs. COLE, Mr. and Mrs. R.W. STRATTON, Mr. and Mrs. Geo. BERRY, Mr. and Mrs. J.B. WOOD, Mr. and Mrs. E.R. MCNEILL, Mr. and Mrs. R.W. JOHNSON, Mr. and Mrs. James FRAZIER, Mr. and Mrs. GILL, Mr. and Mrs. B. BARNES, Mr. and Mrs. J.A. PETER, Mesdames MARLIN, KELLY, CECIL, JAY, HUGHES, WELLER and HIET.\n\nBOWERS - OLIVER\n\nAt nine o'clock on last Saturday evening, in the city of Lawton, Oklahoma, Miss Mildred OLIVER of Pawnee, became the bride of Mr. Harry BOWERS of Lawton. The wedding took place at the Presbyterian manse, Rev. T.J. IRWIN officiating. Only a few relatives and friends were present. The bride wore a blue traveling suit and hat to match and the groom looked his best in his uniform. He is the son of D.M. BOWERS of 405 C Avenue, and was employed with his father in the jewelry business, before he entered the services of the government, since which time he has been in the Quartermaster Corps stationed at Fort Sill. He is a graduate of the Lawton High School, and is very highly respected by his friends. The bride is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W.A. OLIVER of this city, and is so well known by every one here, that it is unnecessary to speak of her good qualities. Her family are among the most highly respected in Pawnee, and the training she has had will have admirably prepared her for her new position in life. Mr. BOWERS is expecting his discharge soon, and they are planning to take up their residence in Los Angeles, California, where they have both spent a year, and like the country. They are expected in Pawnee soon to visit her parents for a short time. They have the best wishes of her many friends for a happy and prosperous life.\n\nArrested On Charge Of Stealing Horses\n\nTom FINCH is in the toils of the law and is making a visit at Hotel MCINTYRE as the result of the alleged appropriation of a horse and buggy from D.D. HOSTUTLER. Preliminary hearing will be held next Tuesday.\n\nRetires From Farming - W.C. WHITAKER was in town Tuesday, arranging his affairs for an indefinite absence. He recently had a sale of his personal property and has rented his farm. He leaves this week for Blackwell, for a visit with friends, and will then go back to his old home in Kansas, and then expects to spend the summer at different points in the west.\n\nCame Back\n\nAfter six weeks of sickness, we will say we are more than thankful to our many kind neighbors and friends for their help, and especially to Mrs. N.S. ALLEN for her services. I will forgive the fellow who started the report that I was dead, but it surely makes a fellow have a dark brown taste in his mouth and a chill run through him to have someone call and ask what time he died and so on. I almost thought that it was real, when at the same time the phone rang, the undertaker drove up, and had a large bottle, but it proved to be grape juice instead of embalming fluid. So, we thank you all. J.N. LIZAR and Family.\n\nWedding\n\nMiss Claire BIDDISON, second daughter of Mr. and Mrs. V.H. BIDDISON, and Dr. J.W. LUMB of Sioux City, Iowa, were married Saturday morning, the ceremony taking place at 11:30 o'clock in the home of the bride's parents, 1205 North Denver Avenue.\n\nPreceding the hour for the nuptial service, Miss Fannie BIDDISON, the bride's sister, sang \"Thine for life,\" by Mascheroni, after which the ring service was read by Rev. KERR, of the First Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe bride wore a gown of white georgette and carried a shower of sweet peas. Her traveling suit was a spring model in the reindeer shade. Breakfast for the 20 guests, which included only the immediate members of the two families and a few friends was served at 12. The dining room and table decorations were of pink and white sweet peas. Doctor and Mrs. LUMB left during the afternoon for Sioux City to reside. Mr. and Mrs. K.W. LUMB, of Manhattan, Kansas, parents of Doctor LUMB; Mrs. SCHOEF of Wakefield, Kansas, and Mrs. DOVERSPIKE of Alta Vista, Kansas, his sisters, were out-of-town guests. Representative and Mrs. W.

Well, I was glad to hear from all of my folks at once, for I got five letters all dated January 3rd. I sure was busy for a while reading them. Tho' I've never heard from Bertha yet. Hope I do an way. I sure wish I was back to the dear old states for I have seen more of France than I wanted to see. I don't like this rough country. I want to be where I can see something once in a while, talk to who I please and go where I please once more.\n\nI am working in the kitchen, I have to wash dishes for about 260 men and help wait on them at meal time, so I am going to get me a job in a hotel when I get back home, ha ha. You know how I will do that. I am with lots of the Oklahoma boys, we have as good a time as we can in this Frog country. (We call the French Frogs.)\n\nI am celebrating some tonight. I have been drinking beer and cognac, ha, ha. The French are as bad for drinks as the Germans. Well, I will close, hoping to hear from you soon.\n\nFrom your brother,\n\nPvt. Robt. Allen BOWDEN\n\nBase Hosp. 99, A.E.F. France\n\n* * *\n\nSomewhere in Germany\n\nDecember 19, 1918\n\nDear Mother:\n\nI will try and write you a few lines this morning, as it is raining and is nothing much to do, and as you know that just suits me. Well mother, I've always wanted to go to Germany. Well, I am here now. It is not the place that I expected to see, although the people treat me fine. They are glad we are here. They like the American people fine but they do not like the French much. They way that if it were not for us, they would still be in war. I am staying in a house with the German and have got a good bed to sleep in and can sure sleep too, after being in the trenches so long. There are six of we boys staying at the same place. We sure have a good time; there is a little boy here; he carries in the wood and keeps the fire going for us all the time. We are going to have a big dinner Christmas day. We also had a good dinner on Thanksgiving. That was one Thanksgiving day that we had something to be thankful for and there was no gun shooting and we could not hear the cannon roar. I went to the front in August and was there until the end. We have been marching most of the time. We have been through Luxemburg and also across the corner of Belgium. Their country is about the same, that is in the way of buildings and that is the first thing I notice when I go into a town. Everything is build of stone here in Germany. They have fine building stone here. While in France it is all limestone.\n\nWell mother, I spent the 4th of July on the Atlantic ocean at Halifax, Canada, and Thanksgiving in France, and will spend Christmas in Germany. I hope that you will have a fine Christmas and that the boys will be home by that time if not before. I would write Ethel a letter but have lost her address. I ought to know it but I don't know whether it is Pawnee or Masham. How is Dutch and the other boys coming and also Helen. I think of her every day. I guess she is a big girl by this time.\n\nHoping to hear from you real soon. I will close as ever,\n\nYour son,\n\nPvt. James E. HEPPEL\n\nCo. D., 357th Inf. A.E.F. A.P.O. 770\n\n* * *\n\nWell Ben, I wish you were her to help me drink beer and cognac, as is is fine and plentiful. This sure is a rough country. Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee are nothing compared with France. You look one way and see the mountains and the other the sea. There are lots of sceneries here alright, but I can't learn to like it. I only weighed 130 pounds Christmas day, the day I was released from the hospital after having a severe attack of influenza and bronchitis, and now I weigh 170. My lungs bother me some yet. I puff like a steam engine, some puffing is it not? I am sending you one of my pictures taken by a Frog or you would call him a Frenchman. We sure had a time coming over here. We rode in Frog cars. They would only hold 8 horses and 40 men and believe me we were sure a squeezed up bunch.\n\nWell Lillian, I want you to write to Bertha and see why she doesn't know she has a brother in the army. I am sorry to hear of their bad luck and hope they are alright now. Well, I will close, hoping you are all well, so answer soon and all of the news.\n\nFrom your brother, Pvt. Robt. Allen ROWDEN\n\nBase Hospital, No. 99, A.E.F.\n\nP.S. Tell all of my old friends \"hello\" for me.\n\n* * *\n\nWell father:\n\nWill drop you a few lines to let you know I am well and feeling good. An I expect to be in Pawnee by the 25th but no sooner. I have been to N.Y., it is a big place. I have spent eight days over there but I will have to stick around till I get my discharge and I will get it the fifteenth, but I want to stop in Chicago a day or so. Say everything is high over here too. We had to pay 27 cents for one egg in France but it costs us 15 over here. Well, I can stay in the army and draw $15 a month. I don't know but it is the best I can do, but I would have stayed in France if they let me. Well, I guess that everybody is well.

NUTTLE.\n\nMarch 06, 1919 Pawnee Courier-Dispatch & Times-Democrat\n\nTom PERRY Kills Wife And Self\n\nAbout 9 o'clock this (Thursday) morning, Tom PERRY, who lives five miles northeast of Jennings, in a quarrel with his wife, shot her with a shotgun, the charge entering her left side just under the shoulder blade, inflicting a wound from which she died instantly. Mr. PERRY was standing so close to Mrs. PERRY that the flash from the gun set her clothing on fire. One of the children, a little girl, was standing near, but ran to where a brother and sister were working in the timber near by. The boy started for a neighbors to give the alarm. Mr. PERRY followed a short distance, calling him back, but the boy kept on.\n\nWhen the boy returned with neighbors, Perry's body was found lying on a little knoll a short distance from the house, with his head blown completely off. He had placed the muzzle of the gun under his chin, evidently, thus putting an end to his troubles. The Perrys were people of middle age and leave five children to mourn their untimely deaths. Sheriff MCINTYRE was called and after examination, found there was nothing he could do, other than send out the undertaker.\n\nDied - Frank YINGLING was stricken with paralysis at the office of Atty Thurman HURST yesterday afternoon, and was taken to the home of R.P. BANKS, where he and his wife have been staying for some months. He was as well as usual up to the time he was stricken. Mr. and Mrs. YINGLING have lived at Pawnee for many years, and only in the last few years had moved away. He still owned a great deal of property here, and it was to look after this that they were here. Arrangements have not yet been made for the funeral, and the obituary will appear next week.\n\nNew Battery Man: H.V.

ORTON, City Attorney; G.H. THOMPSON, City Marshal.\n\nNew Dray Line: CUSTER & MCGUIRE have opened up a dray line and are out for business - any kind of hauling and delivery work.

She is a fine girl and her parents are very proud of her.\n\nKilling At Quay: About dusk Friday evening, Carl SKENE was shot and almost instantly killed by Deputy Sheriff SMITH of Payne County, in the town of Quay, which lies partly in Payne and partly in Pawnee County. It seems that Mrs. SKENE had a driving horse that recently had got into the habit of balking to such an extent that she was unable to drive it, and Carl SKENE, and a man who was working for SKENE, decided to try to break it of this habit. With this object in view, Carl and the man hitched it up after supper last Friday and drove it from SKENE farm a mile and a half west of Quay into town. Just in front of the Quay Mercantile store, the horse balked and SKENE began whipping it, using a buggy whip. This alarmed some women in a rooming house, who sent for the Deputy Sheriff for the purpose of having SKENE arrested.\n\nIn the meantime, a man in charge of the gas plant, came out and protested against whipping the horse. SKENE resented this interference and some words followed. Just as the horse finally started, Mr. SMITH came up from behind on the run, and seeing the buggy driving off at a gallop called upon SKENE to halt. This he did not do, and it is very likely that he never heard the officer. The man from the gas plant called to the Deputy to shoot and he at once opened fire, firing three shots, one of which struck SKENE in the back of the head, coming out at his mouth. He fell forward upon his face, dropping the whip and the lines, and the man who was riding with him sprang out of the buggy and caught the horse. SKENE died within an hour, without regaining consciousness.\n\nThe occurrence caused considerable feeling, and for some time it looked as if mob violence would result, but wise counsels prevailed and SMITH was taken to jail at Guthrie. The man who called to SMITH to shoot was knocked down and beaten up, and feeling against him was so strong that he thought it wise to leave town for a while.\n\nCarl SKENE was a young man of about 32 years of age and leaves a wife and four children. He was engaged in the cattle business and has many friends in this part of the country. His father is one of the old settlers of this country, and the Skenes are among the best of our citizens. Deputy SMITH is not so well known, but was respected and esteemed by those who did know him. He will be tried on a charge of murder in Payne County. There is no evidence that there was the least feeling between the two men, and the man with SKENE says he never heard the command to halt. It seems that it is an unfortunate affair of losing his head by an officer, as the offense was not of character to justify killing. Quay has had much trouble since the discovery of oil there, and it has been a very difficult place to enforce the law. A previous Deputy Sheriff was once disarmed, beaten, and forced to leave town.\n\nKeystone Bank Robbed Friday\n\nTwo bold bandits, shortly after the opening hour last Friday morning, entered the Keystone State Bank, covered the cashier and president with guns, secured all the cash in sight, rifled the safety deposit boxes, locked the bank officers in the vault, and escaped out the back door just as a lady employee entered the front door. About $1,200 in cash was secured and enough Liberty bonds to bring the total amount of loot up to nearly $4,500. The robbers were tracked in the snow to a point where the Cimarron and Arkansas rivers join, where they evidently had left a boat, in which they expected to make their getaway. The boat had been washed away and the robbers then returned to the hills near town, where the trail was lost. Wires were cut and communication with officers at Pawnee, Tulsa and Sapulpa took time. Sheriff MCINTYRE did not get to Keystone until Friday night, and by that time the trail was cold.\n\nChurch Banquet: The men's banquet, held at the Christian Tabernacle Tuesday evening, met with wonderful success, and a large attendance was had. everyone expressed their appreciation of the efforts given by the ladies who made preparations for the dinner, which, putting it mildly, was elaborate and served with painstaking care. Rev. J. Walter TURNER, pastor of the church, expressed his gratitude and took part in making the event a success, and deserves a large credit for the work he is doing, which is resulting in a progressive organization in our city. He is a hard worker and extends a hearty welcome to all services of the church.\n\nMarriage: Miss Mary A. MOTT, of Stillwater, Oklahoma, was united in marriage to Mr. John HANSON of Yale, Oklahoma, at the Methodist Parsonage, on Wednesday, February 26, 1919, by Rev. F.D. STEVICK. Mr. HANSON is a prosperous fruit grower and farmer of Yale. May happiness and prosperity attend the happy couple.\n\nA Letter From a Soldier Boy\n\nJanuary 11, 1919\n\nDear Folks:\n\nHow are you by this time, I am the same as ever - fine. It is cold as h- here. Twenty below zero. I received the package you sent and also the letter that came after the package. How is everybody at home by now. I am sending you a picture of myself and some friends. So you can guess how we are dressed. We pretty nearly smother to death some times. Remember I told you about Dick. This is the fellow that transferred with me. He is still with me. Don't know for sure, but I think we will be separated soon. I hope not anyway. Well, tell Clarence and Mary hello for me, and don't look for me back for quite a while. The war is over in France, but not over here. Got a letter from Hazel and one from Chas. DAUHL in Denver the other day. They are giving me the devil because I don't write. Well, I can't help it, if they were over here they would not write either. Cause every time I think of this country, I get mad. Guess that is the reason they won't let us tell you about yours truly. Well, this may be but a few lines but it may make the grade well.

A. 11th Infantry, A.E.F. January 31, 1919. To Mr. Harry W. BOCK, Sr., Pawnee, Oklahoma.\n\nThe following are the details and the verification of your son's death, by the present First Sergeant Arthur T. MURPHY. Erving D. COLVIN, Captain 11th Infantry, Commanding Company.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regard to your son's death, I can give you the details exactly. On the 5th day of November, 1918, our regiment was ordered to advance across the river Muese, Verdun sector, France. We started the advance about noon, and kept on going all day, and dug in for the night. Harry made a careful survey of the company, to ascertain the number of casualties. When he came to my platoon he remarked, \"I believe I am going to get mine about tomorrow boys.\" We started out early the next morning and advance farther. The following day, November 7th, about 5 p.m., your son met a sudden death. He was hit over the right eye with a piece of shrapnel which came out under his right ear, and at the same instant was struck in the head with a machine gun bullet, causing death instantly.\n\nThe next morning, Lieut. RICH, then in command of the company, sent a detail of six men back to where Harry fell and buried him. When the body was located there were no personal effects on it, except his service record and other papers, which were forwarded to the Personnel office. Harry is buried on the edge of the Bold Du Carrol Woods, the nearest large city being Verdun, about forty kilometers southeast. This statement is absolutely correct, for I was with the company the night Harry was killed, and saw him lying dead in a shell crater, waiting for burial. Your son was a soldier, who feared no danger, and was often cautioned about his aggressiveness. He died a hero's death, for the love of his country, mankind, and humanity. Yours respectfully, Arthur T. MURPHY, 1st Sgt, Co. \"A\" 11th In.

I want you to go ahead and rent the farm because I can't tell what will happen.\n\nWe would have been home by this time, but we have had orders changed so many times, I don't know what will happen next. But, as soon as were are released from this army of occupation we are on our way home. The German people are very nice to us, and treat us nice, but I don't like this country.\n\nIt has been snowing the last few days, but haven't seen any cold weather here yet. We are farther north here than any part of the states.\n\nThe Germans say it is the mildest winter they have seen since 1898. The grass is still green and cabbage is still growing. The Germans are short on horses. They work milk cows as oxen. I've seen a few oxen too, but very few horses. The French army of occupation are awful hard on the Germans and are having trouble all the time, but they sure love the Americans and say they had no cause to fight the Americans. I will write as soon as I find out when I'm coming home.\n\nFebruary 23, 1919\n\nDear mother and father:\n\nI just received your letter, was sure glad to hear from you. I have been rather busy here lately, mostly doing nothing, but busy all the time.\n\nWe have a few more officers now, between 40 and 50, so it makes quite a little more work. I'm getting nearly all your letters, but sometimes I get the last ones before I get the first, as some of them are delayed on the road.\n\nWill, I'm getting tired of the army, and am longing to get home once more. I'm having a pretty good time but the idea of being tied down I do not like it at all. Seems they are rather slow about sending us home. There are ten divisions in the army of occupation and the French say we ought to have twenty.\n\nThe Americans and Germans get along fine, and also the British, but they don't like the French. The British and Americans don't like them either and will not associate with them. We are thirty-seven miles from the Rhine River here and also about that far from Belgium.\n\nI have put in for a pass to Paris, but I don't know when I will get it. I got a pass to Coblens - that is headquarters of 7th army, or army of occupation. I saw the Rhine River and also took a ride up the river about three miles and back. Coblens is a beautiful town and I had a good time on the trip.\n\nI don't know a thing when I will get to come home. Everything is quiet and nobody knows anything. It ought not to be long, but it will take a month to go home from here. I am wearing one service stripe now, and I figure I will get the other before I get out of the army. It has been raining here for the last few days. The hills are green and the trees have begun to put out, so spring is almost here.\n\nWell, I must close, as ever\n\nYour loving son, Oliver BRENNEMAN - 358 Supply Co., A.E.F., Germany\n\nHouse Creek:\n\nMr. and Mrs. SHULAN's daughter, Violet and children, visited with them last Sunday and Monday.\n\nMarie COMPTON spent the weekend with home home folks, returned back to Pawnee, Sunday evening.\n\nMr. and Mrs. A.E.
