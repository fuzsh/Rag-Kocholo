A visionary restaurateur, master storyteller, caring mentor, and loving husband and father, Will was born July 27, 1961 in Rocky Mount, NC. Will was predeceased by his father, Dr. Lewis Thorp, Jr., his mother Harriet Williamson Thorp, and his stepmother Nancy Yelverton Thorp; he was also predeceased by his cousin William Mahler Thorp. Will graduated from Rocky Mount Senior High in 1979. He briefly attended UNC Wilmington and then earned an associates degree in Culinary Arts from Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College. He moved to the Outer Banks in 1984 and worked as a chef at Kellys Restaurant and Tavern in Nags Head, and subsequently helped launch the restaurant at the Village of Nags Head Golf Links. While he enjoyed these positions and made many lifelong friends, Will was anxious to create his own establishment, and in December 1989 opened Tortugas Lie in Nags Head, an innovative concept for its time. Seeing the need for a casual dining space in Kitty Hawk, Will opened Rundown Café in April 1993, and then returned to his eastern North Carolina roots by inaugurating High Cotton BBQ in Kitty Hawk in April 2002. While his professional successes were many, Will will be most fondly remembered for his exceptionally generous nature. Always ready with a smile, kind word, funny joke, or amusing story, he was the consummate host and loved making people feel special. He also took great delight in helping others, from mentoring at-risk youth through the Dare County Friends of Youth program, to mentoring a vast number of employees, many of whom recognized great success of their own thanks to his caring guidance. He also had a true love for the outdoors and enjoyed hunting and shooting; he was a member of the Mt. Carmel Hunt Club and the Outer Banks Gun Club, and was an honorary member of the G.J. Mendel Botanical Society. Will maintained a special love for the wide open spaces of South Dakota, where he spent many happy times as an honorary cowboy. His greatest love, however, was his family, and he was always ready to boast of his daughter Helens accomplishments; he proved himself to be the Best Horse Dad Ever. Will will be sorely missed by his wife, Sherry White Thorp and daughter Helen Mae Thorp, both of the Kitty Hawk residence. Will is also survived by a sister, Routh Cooper (Matt) of Mars Hill, NC, and brothers Lewis Thorp III (Cindy) of Advance, NC, David Thorp of Raleigh, NC, and Bob Bennett of Richmond, VA. His cousins were like siblings to him: Helen Thorp of Chapel Hill, NC, John Thorp Jr. (Joe Carol) of Chapel Hill, NC, Dan Thorp of Sheldon, SC, and Hall Thorp (Sharon) of Rocky Mount, NC. He will also be dearly missed by his mother-in-law, Linda White of Southern Shores, NC. Will also leaves behind a host of other relatives and, because he never met a stranger, a countless number of friends, and he will be deeply missed by all who knew him. The family wishes to thank Adoration Hospice for their kind and loving care of Will in his final weeks. Will also wished to recognize and thank Dr. and Mrs. Donny and Jackie Lynn of Petersburg, VA, whose generous loan enabled Will to open Tortugas Lie in 1989, eventually paving the way for many other successful Outer Banks restaurants.

Ms. Emily Lou Tillett, a lifelong resident of Wanchese, NC passed away after a year of declining health. Ms. Lou was a multi-talented lady. She was well-known for her floral designs and creations. Her Island Florist Shop was in downtown Manteo until the late 70s when she moved her business to Wanchese. An award as Floral Designer of the Year gave her the opportunity to teach floral design at the College of the Albemarle. She loved being a chicken and egg person (as she called it). Her flowers were visible in some local restaurants and, in exchange, she enjoyed fine dining. Lou also made it a point to see that those in need of flowers received them, even when payment was in question. Lou was generous to a fault. If she had a dime in her pocket, she gave away nine cents of it. If a stranger needed a ride, she never hesitated to offer transportation and used it as an opportunity to witness in the Lords name. She always said, That may be Jesus Im helping. Eastern Star was an important part of her life as a 50 year member. During those years she created many beautiful and unique decorations for banquets and stage settings. Whatever she needed to carry out her décor, she wasnt bashful about borrowing, but in turn, always gave a credit to the lender for the donation. Although a lifetime member of Bethany United Methodist Church in Wanchese, Lou enjoyed visiting other churches, especially the Assembly of God congregations. She always made sure her home church had Easter lilies in the Lenton season and poinsettias during Advent. Ms. Lou was a dutiful, loving daughter to the late Mrs. Sophronia Meekins Tillett. In addition to her mother, she was predeceased by four brothers, Dalton Tillett, Wylie Tillett, Oswald Tillett, and Alton Tew Tillett. Left to cherish her memories are her sister, Mrs. Joyce Meekins of Wanchese, numerous nieces and nephews, special friends and caregivers, her loved cats, BeBe and Butter. She will live forever in our hearts and memories. A loving friend and true disciple of the Christ, Ms. Lou will be laid to rest at Bethany United Methodist Church on Sunday, October 17, 2010 at 2:00 pm, with interment at the Tillett Cemetery next to her mother and officiated by Rev. David Daniels, Rev. Dr. Jerome Smith and Rev. Mark Hinson. The family will receive friends at Twiford Colony Chapel, Manteo on Saturday evening from 7:00 to 8:30 pm and at other times at the home of her sister, Joyce Meekins in Wanchese.

Mrs. Tillett was born in Manteo, NC on September 30, 1930, and was the daughter of the late Albert and Florence Virginia Daniels. In addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by her husband, Willett Tillett; brothers, Jerry, Curtis, Luther, Cloyce, Bill, and Murray; and sister, Annie Laurie. She is survived by her five children, Justin Tillett (Margie), Shelly Keller, Jerry Tillett (Tanya), Arty Tillett (Pam), and Lori Toler (Les); ten grandchildren, Jason, Jeremy, Caroline, Ara, Will, Evan, Madee, Cassie, and Macy; three great-grandchildren, Alyssa, Ashby, and Asher; and a sister, Frances Coleman. Her mother a Midgett, father a Daniels, and husband a Tillett, Jeanine was as local as you get. Mrs. Tillett retired from the Dare County Schools Transportation Department after 30 years of service as a clerk. She had also worked alongside her husband in operating and building (literally and in the business sense) The Fin N Feather Motel. She was devoted to the Shriners organization, always finding joy in furtherance of its charitable causes. Jeanine was characterized by an uncanny ability to make each person feel special, an omnipresent affectionate smile upon tilted head and a keen and ascerbic wit. Her quips, zingers and barbs were pointed but not sharp; stinging only slightly while amusing all around. Flora Jeanine was known to everyone from politicians to children, doctors to Walmart clerks as Neenie, a moniker with which was dubbed by her oldest grandson. She birthed five children, loved nieces and nephews as her own but was a mother to many. Before giving up cooking several years ago she was prone to cook large meals using Army pots as noted by one visiting Turkish college student. In the words of her longest care-taker and now friend, Everyone she meets fall in love with Neenie. She will be remembered for many things, not the least of which was her sartorial propensity, (even when going for medical treatment). She was brightly attired with perfectly matching outfits and accessories, including earrings, handbag, scarf, necklace, shoes, etc. Who imagined there could be so many accouterments in each particular shade of blue. Who, knowing her will forget her affinity for (or obsession with) the little white ceramic adorned with blue know as blue delft. There was always an array, from a menagerie of animals, nativity scene, ornaments and thimbles ubiquitously appearing throughout her home. Having survived adversity, tragedy and near poverty without dwelling upon either of them, she developed a toughness and resiliency with which she contended and bounced back from the myriad of ailments and diseases which attacked her. Her life exemplified the philosophy you dont have to be rich to be generous. She was generous to the last. Jeanine was happiest when she could herd her large family to gather anywhere for any occasion. She remained sanguine throughout her life but a few days ago she said Im ready to see Jesus. Her mansion, not made with hands, will no doubt be colorful and lavishly ornamented. Until then, when we gather there with you Neen, tot kijk (farewell). A funeral will be held at 12:00 pm on Monday, May 15, 2017, at Coastal Family Church with Rev. Stephen Wescott and Rev. Reggie Scarborough officiating. Burial will take place at Cudworth Cemetery. The family will receive friends and relatives for a visitation one hour prior to the service.
