        "text": "WSM: Let’s start with our typical interview questions. What’s your name, where are you from, and how long have you been wakesurfing?\n\nGabrielle: Gabrielle Hockley, Cranbrook BC Canada, 4 years.\n\nWSM: Prior to wakesurfing, were you doing any other towed watersports?\n\nGabrielle: I was really into wakeboarding and spent some time competing in Canada and the US. I also spent my childhood barefooting, slalom skiing, and did a little bit of trick skiing.\n\nWSM: Can you recall the first time you experienced wakesurfing? What lake were you on and were you immediately hooked or did that come with time?\n\nGabrielle: I was in Florida working at The Wakeboard Camp. We went out on the boat with Amber Wing and a few of her friends and tried it for the first time. I thought it was fun but didn’t really think about doing it again for a couple of years.\n\nWSM: What was the first trick you learned and how long did it take you to get it?\n\nGabrielle: A 360, I learned it the first summer I started surfing. It took me only a couple attempts to get it the first time and then, of course, you lose it for a while again after that.\n\nWSM: What’s your favorite trick to do?\n\nGabrielle: Switch airs or 720’s.\n\nWSM: Take us through your warm up. When you get up for the first time on any given day, what tricks do you do first?\n\nGabrielle: I always try to put together a run as if I was in a competition the first time I get up. Which normally includes some air grabs, 360, air 180, and 720.\n\nWSM: Who was surfing first, you or Isaac?\n\nGabrielle: I actually didn’t ever surf again after the first time until I started hanging out with Isaac who had been surfing for a few years already.\n\nWSM: Follow-up to the last question, who has the bigger bag of tricks?\n\nGabrielle: I would say Isaac does but its hard to compare when its surf against skim lol.\n\nWSM: We have to ask about snowmobiling. The pictures you have posted look like something off of a postcard! How long have you been riding a sled and where has been your favorite place to ride at?\n\nGabrielle: I got my first snowmobile when I was 3. So, I have been sledding for about 25 years. I really love riding my local area near Cranbrook and I also really enjoy Revelstoke. I would like to get the opportunity to travel a little further for sledding though outside of Canada.\n\nWSM: You’re predominantly a surf style rider but do you ever ride skim?\n\nGabrielle: I use to skim about once a year but this last season I probably rode about 6 or 7 times. I plan to start skimming more in the future.\n\nWSM: Tell us about your sponsors. What’s your current equipment setup?\n\nGabrielle: I ride a Gia Surf Board made by Kanuk Board Co. which is the most amazing board I have ever ridden. I will be riding behind a 2018 Nautique G23 this season from Wizard Lake Marine and using a Glidesoul 3mm full suit for the first half of the season and a Glidesoul front zip springsuit for the other half. We have pretty cold water most of the riding season.\n\nWSM: Tell us about Kanuk, how’d you get hooked up with them?\n\nGabrielle: I actually got introduced to the owners through a friend I met at the Koocanusa Wakesurf Challenge (Cody Inman) he is also one of there team riders!\n\nWSM: If you could take one celebrity wakesurfing with you who would it be and why?\n\nGabrielle: Isaac won’t like this answer haha but Channing Tatum, and I think all the ladies would know why…. lol.\n\n[Editor’s note: *All guys feel free to insert an eye roll here*]\n\nWSM: If you had your choice of music when riding, what would it be?\n\nGabrielle: Reggae (Collie Buddz, Seedless, Damian Marley), The Eagles, or Gangster Rap/hip-hop (Merkules, Nate Dogg, Slaine, Madchild, Snak the Ripper, Tech N9ne)\n\nWSM: Where would you like to see wakesurfing go in the future?\n\nGabrielle: I would like to see competitions expand into Canada more which definitely happened this last season, but to keep moving in this direction as it gets more people in our area involved in wakesurfing! Also, to see the juniors divisions grow and have more division options as of now skim and surf are combined for juniors.\n\nWSM: What advice would you give a newcomer to the sport that’s looking to progress and learn new tricks?\n\nGabrielle: If you don’t have someone to help teach you, get some video footage of the trick. It’s easier to see what you are doing wrong rather than just going by the feel of it. Also, try a trick a few times but take a break and just have fun if you get frustrated and come back to it with a fresh mind.\n\nWSM: What tricks are you working on? Anything you feel like lettings us know about?\n\nGabrielle: At the end of the season I landed a couple Air 180’s to switch front shuv, so I am working on getting those more solid. I would like to get some switch spins in my bag of tricks, a blind body varial, and backside 180 to switch front shuv.\n\nWSM: Do you have anyone you’d like to thank?\n\nGabrielle: My husband of course as he is my biggest fan and boat driver/coach, Caro from H2O School, Ron and Gord at Wizard Lake Marine, Paul from Kanuk Board Co, Rob from Just Liquid Sports, Glidesoul, and Chuck, Niki, Douglas, and Charlie for being my boat family!\n\nWSM: Would you like to plug any social media?\n\nGabrielle: Instagram- GabrielleHockley\n\nfacebook.com – GabrielleHockley\n\nSnapchat – GabbyHockley\n\ntwitter.com – TheSledderGirl\n\nWe want to thank Gabrielle for giving WSM her time and we look forward to seeing more of her as she continues to progress in her career and push wakesurfing into the future!"
