        "text": "Ukrainian-born French actress (born 1979)\n\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is Kostyantynivna and the family name is Kurylenko.\n\nOlga Kostyantynivna Kurylenko (Ukrainian: Ольга Костянтинівна Куриленко, IPA: [ˈɔlʲɦɐ kosʲtʲɐnˈtɪn⁽ʲ⁾iu̯nɐ kʊrɪˈlɛnko]; born 14 November 1979) is an actress. Born and raised in Ukraine, she moved to France at age 16 to pursue a modelling career. Kurylenko refocused on acting in 2004 and had her breakthrough film role in the action-thriller Hitman (2007). She gained recognition as Camille Montes in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace (2008).\n\nKurylenko has also starred in Terrence Malick's To the Wonder (2012), Martin McDonagh's dark comedy Seven Psychopaths (2012), the science fiction film Oblivion (2013), Armando Iannucci's political satire The Death of Stalin (2017), Terry Gilliam's The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2018), the Netflix miniseries Treason (2022), and the action film Extraction 2 (2023).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nOlga Kostyantynivna Kurylenko[1] was born on 14 November 1979[2] in Berdyansk, a port city in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union.[3] Her father, Konstantin Kurylenko, is Ukrainian, and her mother, Marina Alyabusheva—who teaches art and is an exhibited artist—was born in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia and is of Russian and Belarusian ancestry. Her parents divorced when she was three years old, and she was raised by her mother. Kurylenko rarely had contact with her father, meeting him for the first time after the split at age eight and later at age thirteen.[4][5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nKurylenko moved to Moscow at age 15. At age 16, she moved to Paris.[6] In 1996, Kurylenko signed a contract with the Paris-based Madison modelling agency where she met her publicist Valérie Rosen.[7] The following year, by the age of 18, she had appeared on the covers of Vogue and Elle magazines.[8] While working as a model in Paris, Kurylenko supported her mother in Ukraine.[9]\n\nShe also appeared on the covers of Madame Figaro and Marie Claire magazines.[10] She became the face of brands Bebe, Clarins, and Helena Rubinstein.[10] She has also modelled for Roberto Cavalli and Kenzo[11] and appeared in the Victoria's Secret catalogue.[12]\n\nIn 1998, she features in the music video of French Raï style singer Faudel called \"Tellement Je T'aime\".\n\nOne of her first acting appearances was in Seal's music video, \"Love's Divine\" in 2003,[13] but her film career truly began in France in 2004 when she shot her first feature film, The Ring Finger,[14] for which she received the certificate of excellence award at the 2006 Brooklyn International Film Festival for her performance. She next starred in the Paris, je t'aime (2006) segment Quartier de la Madeleine opposite Elijah Wood. That same year, she was selected to be the face of Kenzo's new fragrance, Kenzo Amour.[15] She has appeared in all subsequent Kenzo Amour advertisements.[citation needed]\n\nKurylenko quit modelling in 2006, after over ten years of working in the industry and moved on to acting.[14]\n\nIn 2007, she starred in Hitman alongside Timothy Olyphant. She had a minor role in Max Payne as Natasha.\n\nShe played Bond girl Camille Montes in the 2008 James Bond film, Quantum of Solace (after beating out Gal Gadot in the auditions).[16] In the film she plays the role of Bolivian Secret Service agent Camille Montes, who teams up with Bond to stop a terrorist organization and avenge the death of her parents.[17][18] Russian politician Sergey Malinkovich wrote an open letter to Kurylenko.[19] In it he said: \"In the name of all communists we appeal to you ... deserter of Slavic world. The Soviet Union gave you free education, free medical care but nobody knew you would commit an act of intellectual and moral betrayal and become a movie girl of Bond, who in his movies kills hundreds of Soviet people and citizens of other socialist countries.\"[19]\n\nShe was featured on the cover of the December 2008 issue of the US edition of Maxim magazine[20] and on the cover of the February 2009 issue of the Ukrainian edition of Maxim.[21] In Ukraine the mayor of Berdyansk suggested naming a street after her in early 2008,[citation needed] and she and her mother met Ukraine's First Lady Kateryna Yushchenko in President Victor Yushchenko's family country house.[7][8]\n\nKurylenko appeared in Terrence Malick's romantic drama film To the Wonder starring Ben Affleck and Rachel McAdams. The film was shot in the fall of 2010 in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.[22] She also appeared in Oblivion, a science fiction film starring Tom Cruise and directed by Joseph Kosinski.[23] Kurylenko played Alice Fournier in the spy thriller November Man.[24] In 2014, Kurylenko starred in the historical drama film The Water Diviner alongside Russell Crowe (who made his directorial debut), Jacqueline McKenzie and Jai Courtney. She also played the headmistress in Vampire Academy. She later acted in films such as Momentum, Mara and The Bay of Silence.\n\nIn 2017, she appeared in Armando Iannucci's political satire film The Death of Stalin as the Soviet pianist Maria Yudina. The film was a critical success and starred Steve Buscemi, Simon Russell Beale, Jason Issacs, Michael Palin, and Jeffrey Tambor. The following year she starred in Terry Gilliam's epic adventure film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2018) starring Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce where it premiered at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. She also appeared as Baroness Roxane de Giverny in The Emperor of Paris, and as the Russian spy in the Rowan Atkinson led comedy film Johnny English Strikes Again (2018).\n\nIn 2021, she starred in the action thriller film Sentinelle.[25] In the same year, she played Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Black Widow.[26][27] In October, she was cast in comedy heist film High Heat alongside Don Johnson.[28]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nKurylenko acquired French citizenship in 2001,[29] which she called \"a practical decision\" because it was easier to travel with a French passport without a visa, as opposed to travelling with a Ukrainian passport.[30] In 2000, Kurylenko married French fashion photographer Cedric van Mol, whom she divorced four years later.[31] In 2006, Kurylenko married American mobile phone accessory entrepreneur Damian Gabrielle, whom she divorced the next year.[32] She moved to London in 2009.[33][34][35]\n\nKurylenko has a son (b. 2015) with her former partner, English actor and writer Max Benitz, whom she met in 2014.[36][37] She expressed support for Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[38]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nList of film performances by Olga Kurylenko Year Title Role Director Notes 2005 The Ring Finger Iris Diane Bertrand 2006 Paris, je t'aime The Vampire Vincenzo Natali Segment: Quartier de la Madeleine The Serpent Sofia Éric Barbier 2007 Hitman Nika Boronina Xavier Gens 2008 À l'est de moi The Russian prostitute Bojena Horackova Max Payne Natasha Sax John Moore Quantum of Solace Camille Montes Marc Forster 2009 The Assassin Next Door Galia Danny Lerner 2010 Centurion Etain Neil Marshall 2011 There Be Dragons Ildiko Roland Joffé Land of Oblivion Anya Michale Boganim Also executive producer 2012 Erased Anna Brandt Philipp Stölzl To the Wonder Marina Terrence Malick Seven Psychopaths Angela Martin McDonagh 2013 Oblivion Julia Rusakova Harper Joseph Kosinski 2014 Vampire Academy Ellen Kirova Mark Waters The November Man Alice Fournier/Mira Filipova Roger Donaldson The Water Diviner Ayshe Russell Crowe 2015 A Perfect Day Katya Fernando León de Aranoa Momentum Alex Farraday Stephen S.
