        "text": "Exercise Video Side Story December 22, 2013\n\nPosted by Alexander Sawit in Stuff in General.\n\ntrackback\n\nBy Alex Sawit\n\nDecember 21, 2013\n\nIt‚Äôs the most sensational viral video of the year from the Philippines, having gotten well over 3 million views on YouTube as of this writing and inspiring numerous ‚Äúslow motion edits‚Äù and even a spoof video from enthusiastic fans. Not surprisingly, the Ellen Adarna Exercise Video by Seven Productions continues to ignite discussions among folks eagerly asking, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù\n\nAs a member of Seven Productions, I can assure Cyrano friends that there‚Äôs stuff in the pipeline.\n\nIn the meantime, I‚Äôll let you read this email conversation I had with Wes and Raffy ‚Äì the awesome guys behind the camera for whom Ellen promoted the now famous tagline, ‚ÄúExercise. It‚Äôs good for you.‚Äù ‚Äì about an interesting discussion I had here at the wine shop. It‚Äôs just to give you an idea about how much painstaking care we bros put into coming up with winning concepts for our public service messages.\n\nHubba-hubba‚Ä¶\n\n10 December 2013\n\nThought I‚Äôd share this story just for fun.\n\nAn American fellow named Dave, who is a regular customer of The Curator (aka the Cyrano back room), was talking to me last night about the Ellen Adarna video.\n\nHe made conversation by comparing Ellen‚Äôs boxing video to a yoga video featuring the ex-wife of a friend/colleague of his back in the States named Damien Gabrielle. He showed me the video on his iPhone but you can watch it on YouTube:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3CaGSbzaOA\n\nThe ex-wife starred as a Bond girl in ‚ÄúQuantum of Solace‚Äù and most recently appeared with Tom Cruise in ‚ÄúOblivion‚Äù.\n\nTwo thoughts I should tell Dave next time: 1) the YouTube video of his friend‚Äôs ex-wife only got 70k+ views in over a year; and 2) he should introduce her to Wes & Raffy.\n\n‚Äì Alex\n\n[REPLY]\n\n*****, this girl iiiiiis hollywood hot ! üôÇ\n\nThanks for the link. Now, I want to get my Yoga on.\n\nhahaha\n\n‚Äì Raffy\n\n[REPLY]\n\nHahaha yeah I can‚Äôt wait to make more üôÇ\n\n‚Äì Wes\n\nYoga video of Olga Kurylenko for Complex magazine."
