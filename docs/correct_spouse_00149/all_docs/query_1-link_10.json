        "text": "Sultry Quantum Of Solace star Olga Kurylenko is one of the most seductive-looking Bond girls ever to catch the eye of 007, but the sexy actress insists she is not interested in men. Following the recent break-up of her second marriage – to American mobile phone mogul Damien Gabrielle – Olga has decided she would rather be alone.\n\n“You can’t judge someone by the way they look because it’s actually totally different,” says the Ukrainian-born actress. “I’m not what you think I am. I’m not a person who has had a lot of romance in my life. Maybe I look like that, but I’m not a romantic person. Sorry to disappoint you.”\n\nOlga left Gabrielle claiming he was jealous of her blossoming career and seems determined to remain single.\n\n“I never look for romance and I’m not interested in it,” says the 28-year-old. “If it happens, it happens, but it’s very hard for me to like somebody. I’d rather be alone than with a person who doesn’t fit with me. Most of my life I’ve been alone.”\n\nIn Quantum Of Solace, Olga plays Camille, a girl with a tragic past who is bent on revenge against the man who killed her family. In the process, she is one of the few Bond girls who does not sleep with 007, played again by Daniel Craig. It’s something Olga is proud of.\n\n“I don’t think Camille is a typical Bond girl,” she says. “I am happy she doesn’t sleep with Bond because he’s done enough of that and slept with a lot of women before. When she meets Bond, sex is the last thing on her mind.”\n\nEqually, Olga is no bimbo, speaking fluent English and French. Born into poverty in the little Ukrainian town of Berdyansk, she grew up in hardship.\n\n“I ate cabbage my whole childhood,” she says with a laugh. “My mother said it was good for my breasts, but I think she lied.”\n\nOlga was just three when her mum Marina went through a divorce. “She is the one who left my father, it was her choice and I respect it,” says Olga. “I think it’s better to have one parent and get a lot of love than have two and get none. I never missed my father at all.”\n\nRaised by her mother and grandmother, Olga was 13 when she was spotted by a scout who offered her a modelling job. Four years later, she moved to Paris and was soon gracing the covers of Vogue, Elle and other top fashion magazines.\n\nIn 2000, she got married for the first time, to photographer Cedric Van Mol. Four years later they were divorced, although they remain good friends.\n\nOlga then began film studies and signed with a small agency in Paris putting her on the long road to movie stardom. For her role as Camille, Olga had to train extensively with stuntmen to prepare for some of the action scenes.\n\n“In one of the scenes where Bond and I are escaping from the bad guys, I had to drive like a maniac,” she says. “I had to make a high-speed turn between two buildings that were really close to each other. They filmed the scene many times and Daniel was very brave because he was sitting next to me. But he kept cool, just like the real Bond!”\n\nFor Olga, the most difficult scene in the movie took place on a speeding boat.\n\n“For two weeks we were on the boat every day going really fast,” she recalls. “We had to crash the boat over and over again because they don’t just film it once. It’s like nothing I’ve ever done before.”\n\nIn the little free time she has these days, Olga tries to catch up with all the things she missed out on growing up in a closed Communist state.\n\n“I read or watch movies because living in the Soviet Union I wasn’t able to see a lot of films,” she says. “I realise I missed such a big part of life. So many things weren’t available and I just emerged into this world where there are so many options and it’s just beautiful.”\n\nOlga is also coping with being hugely in demand.\n\n“I’m getting a lot of scripts sent to me,” she admits. “I want a challenge – parts that make me wonder how I can do them. I want something totally different otherwise it’s not interesting for me.”"
