        "text": "Olga Kurylenko could just be Hollywood's happiest accident. It was never in the script that a Victoria's Secret model could turn her hand to acting so convincingly, or that a Bond Girl could become anything more than just that.\n\nBut Kurylenko, 30, admittedly still most famous for her role as Camille Montes in Quantum of Solace, looks set to overcome her two most bittersweet associations in order to ensure that mainstream exposure doesn't come at the cost of career longevity.\n\nSeldom has an actress with such limited previous on-screen experience taken a sip from the poisoned chalice that is 007's sweetheart status, and survived to accept anything more than a walk-on role. But add the model-actress crossover to that equation, which boasts even fewer success stories, and Kurylenko becomes an interesting anomaly indeed.\n\nIn a short space of time, the Ukrainian-born French citizen who speaks five languages has already taken on a variety of roles and genres under some highly-respected directors, most notably the likes of Academy Award nominees Roland Joffé (The Killing Fields, 1984), Andrew Niccol (The Truman Show, 1999) and Terrance Malick (The Thin Red Line, 1998).\n\nBut without the need for a thesis on Kurylenko's unique and winning formula, her successful Bond re-emergence mostly boils down to her deadly combination of raw talent, breathtaking beauty and a willingness to appear in the buff. Just like the fire triangle, remove any of these elements and the result isn't quite so explosive. In reference to her part in Kirot she told The Sun: \"I've never had a problem getting naked in a film - I sent my body double back because I wanted to do the scenes myself.\"\n\nVowing never to re-marry after divorcing French fashion photographer Cedric van Mol and American entrepreneur Damian Gabrielle hasn't affected her career either - there's still that available but unobtainable lure. She told aceshowbiz.com, \"I think I'll be single my whole life. I don't want to make sacrifices on my own development.\"\n\nHer willingness to get involved in her own action scenes sets her further apart from the pack - from learning how to strip a gun to partaking in high speed boat chases. She was also able to brush off criticism from pro-communist groups who considered her a traitor for becoming the first Bond girl from a former Soviet state.\n\nIf indeed Daniel Craig has become the metrosexual, politically-correct and at times even emotional 21st century Bond, who refuses to down his signature beverage, mouth his catchphrase or spend half the day carving notches on the bedpost, then Olga Kurylenko is the perfect modern Bond girl to star alongside him. And, for the record, she's the only one whom he hasn't notched up… yet.\n\nWhile making up for the forced cultural-diversions, and at times effeminating meanderings of Hollywood's perceived male evolution of Bond, Kurylenko is just as far from the damsel in distress that Ian Fleming's writings had originally portrayed.\n\nHitman, Max Payne, Quantum of Solace and Kirot have made Kurylenko a cut-and-paste action flick-chick. That's quite a desirable niche market for any upcoming actress, but unlike the Megan Foxes of this world, Kurylenko has been wise to diversify her roles.\n\nLining up for an appearance in Neil Marshall's all-action summer blockbuster Centurion playing Etain, a Celtic warrior without a tongue (a non-speaking role we guess) does little to emphasise our point. But Joffe's There Be Dragons, a 2010 dramatisation of the life of a modern day saint set amid the Spanish Civil War, wherein she plays a young Hungarian fighting with the republicans in the International Brigade, restores the argument somewhat. Then there's the Luc Besson-produced RAD, where Kurylenko portrays Marie Curie in a 2011 scheduled biopic of the Polish physicist's discovery of radium and her subsequent struggle to keep the Nazis from the door.\n\nThis will be followed by the still unnamed romantic drama by director Terrance Malick, starring Christian Bale, Rachael McAdams and Javier Bardem, which begins production in the autumn. Plus an appearance alongside Ralph Fiennes in Coronet a debut piece from Temple Clark and The Cross a sci-fi from Andrew Niccol with Orlando Bloom. Fast becoming known as a versatile and dependable actress, as well as titillating eye-candy with the ability to hold a gun, Kurylenko's survived it all to get this far.\n\nFans of French cinema who saw Kurylenko in her earlier art-house works such as her 2005 acting debut in L'Annulaire (Ring Finger) won't be in the least bit surprised at how her career has mapped out.\n\nHer ability to say so much in so few words in the awkward and eerie little-known on-screen adaptation of Yoko Ogawa's novel became the blue touch paper that sparked a certificate of excellence at the 2006 Brooklyn International Film Festival.\n\nIt earned her enough respect and recognition in the industry to land two more French roles in Paris, Je t'aime and The Serpent in 2006.\n\nIt was all in stark contrast to her only other acting experience at the time, which was a 2003 Seal music video, Love's Divine.\n\nWith that sort of start it could have all gone awry for the girl who escaped the abject poverty of her Soviet upbringing thanks to a chance encounter with a modelling scout while holidaying in Moscow at the age of 13. Moving to France as a full-time model at 17, she was able to send money home to her single mother, who shared a flat with Kurylenko's grandparents, aunt, uncle and cousin.\n\nAs fan sites quote, \"My dad didn't leave my mum - her whole life men wanted to marry her but she said no. It was very hard and we struggled, we had nothing to eat, but she said she would never go with a man for the ease of life - not if she didn't love them.\"\n\nA real golden ticket kind of story, she swapped re-stitched hand-me-downs for the designer clothes of the catwalk and graced the cover of Vogue all before the age of 18, then she discovered acting.\n\nThe rest may be history but it's a history she certainly seems to be firmly in control of."
