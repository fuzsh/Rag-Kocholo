        "text": "Rev. Robert Otto Bartz, Jr. was born on November 24, 1952 in Green Bay, WI to Rev. Robert Otto Bartz and Helene (Engelhardt). His childhood years were spent in Arlington Heights, IL where he attended St. Peter Lutheran School. For high school he traveled to Milwaukee, WI where he attended Concordia High School. He spent his college years at Concordia Teachers Colleges in Seward, NE and River Forest, IL. He was married to Lindysue Luster on March 20, 1976. They moved to St. Louis, MO where he attended Concordia Seminary. He vicared at Christ Lutheran in Austin, TX. He graduated and was ordained in 1981. His first call was to Messiah in Waldorf, MD and then to St. Matthew in Bel Air, MD. He took a call to Messiah Lutheran in Elkhart, IN in 1983 and to Trinity Lutheran in Culver, IN in 1989 where he served as worker / priest, working also as a psych tech at Oaklawn Hospital and then as an orderly in surgery at Elkhart General Hospital. In 2001 he received a call to Immanuel in Richton Park, IL. There he was also highly involved with community projects. In 2013 he “retired” and moved to Three Rivers, MI. Retirement did not last long since he was soon pastoring St. Peter Lutheran in Three Rivers. After receiving training in intentional interim pastoral ministry, he resigned from St. Peter to do intentional interim ministry but his plans were interrupted by the covid pandemic. St. Paul in Centreville called him as vacancy pastor, serving there until 2022 when he took an intentional interim position at Faith Lutheran in Easton, PA. In 2023, he began serving in interim position at Emmaus Lutheran in Wauseon, OH where he served until his death on July 11, 2024.\n\nPastor Bob is survived by his wife, Lindysue Luster-Bartz, 8 children and spouses: David (Melissa), Peter (Jennifer), Jennifer Bradfield (Daniel), Andrew (Meghan), Stephen (Alena), Philip (Victoria), Benjamin (Gabrielle), and Rachel Cipich (Jacob), 14 grandchildren (Noah, Sarah, Audrey, Claire, Jonathan, Joseph, Eleanor, Olivia, Elijah, Ezekiel, Grace, Damian, Miara, and Peyton), and sister, Susan Bartz Herrick. He was preceded in death by his parents, Rev. Dr. Robert O. Bartz and Helene, granddaughter, Hannah, and nephew, Luke.\n\nFuneral services for Pastor Bob will be held at 10:00am Wednesday, July 17, 2024 at St. Peters Lutheran Church, 1200 Arnold St., Three Rivers, MI 49093.

Burial will be at 2:00pm at Southlawn Cemetery, 61430 Old U.S. 31 South, South Bend, IN 46614.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family is requesting donations be made to the LCC K-9 Comfort Dog Ministry of Lutheran Church Charities, www.lutheranchurchcharities.com or 3020 Milwaukee Ave., Northbrook, IL 60022\n\nPalmer Funeral Home – Welsheimer Chapel is assisting the family with arrangements.
