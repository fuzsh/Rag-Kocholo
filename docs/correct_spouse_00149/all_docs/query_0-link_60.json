Admittedly that's not actually what she just said -- she merely invited herself to a wedding of which I have no knowledge -- but as English isn't the first language of the Ukrainian actress I feel I'm entitled to some artistic licence which has allowed me to translate \"would you invite me when you get married?\" into an outright proposal.",

        "text": "In fact, Kurylenko's English is near perfect, so I can't maintain this dream any longer, but obviously the answer to the question, whatever she meant by it, would be yes. Tall, slim, with large green eyes and olive skin, Kurylenko, 28, is every bit as glamorous as you would expect. Yet she's no ordinary Bond girl. Where Casino Royale went back to the beginning to shape the story behind 007, the 22nd instalment of the franchise, Quantum of Solace, develops this plotline.\n\nBut this time, Bond has an accomplice in the form of the alluring and mysterious Camille (played by Kurylenko). Like Bond, she is a trained assassin hell-bent on revenge. While Bond seeks to find those responsible for the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd, at the end of Casino Royale, Camille is hunting the Bolivian group responsible for her parents' death. She's a significantly more developed character than the \"loved and left\" Bond girls of the past.\n\nShe's such a prominent part of Quantum of Solace that Kurylenko seems to share billing with Daniel Craig on the posters for the movie, where the two stride side-by-side through the South American desert with their formal clothes in tatters and scars on their faces. The poster also hints at the intensity of the action which has seen Quantum of Solace dubbed the most violent Bond movie ever.\n\nIt was a gruelling process for Kurylenko in what is just her second English language film. For months before shooting, she was in rehearsals, undergoing four hours of intensive fighting training and sky-diving and weapons practice. It's all slightly surreal for Kurylenko, who left her home town of Berdyansk, 800 kilometres from Kiev, when she was just 16 to travel to Paris to become a model.\n\nIt had been a tough upbringing after her parents separated when she was in her infancy (she has claimed to have met her father only three times in her life) and she was raised by her mother, Marina, to whom she is extremely close. Marina has even travelled with her to London, where we meet, to attend the world premiere of the movie with her.\n\nMarina was a teacher and they lived, along with six other relatives, in a small apartment in Berdyansk. Times were tough, and, as she got older, Kurylenko become aware of the family's lack of money. \"We lived salary to salary,\" she says. \"It wasn't poverty like in India. But when you can't afford a new sweater or new shoes it can be upsetting, as a child. But you're just happy so long as you get love and I did get a lot of love.\n\n\"I remember when the Soviet Union collapsed and the parents of my classmates started going to Turkey and doing commerce. They would bring the kids back things from there, but it was all new for us. And my mum worked as a teacher -- no Turkey; no presents.\"\n\nShe laughs as she recalls her schooldays. They were interrupted when she was spotted at 13 on Moscow subway and asked to do modelling. Three years of 30-hour train journeys from Berdyansk to Moscow (with her mother as company) ensued before she made the decision to move to Paris -- where she still lives -- to try her luck. \"That's when I started earning money and I was able to buy my jeans and my shoes,\" she says smiling.\n\nThough she says that mentally she was never 100 per cent committed to fashion, she accumulated covers for Elle, Vogue and Marie Claire as well as high-profile ad campaigns for Clarins, Helena Rubinstein and Kenzo. All the while she wished to act, but she lacked enough French to attend auditions.\n\nInitially, being separated from her mother was tough, she says, but packing it in and returning to Berdyansk was never an option. \"I moved into a studio on my own because I didn't want to stay in an apartment with all models because it was too crazy for me. But I went for something which was hard, too, because suddenly I was all alone. However it's a part of modelling. It's a pretty lonely job. I'm grateful because seeing where I came from this job allowed me to be independent, to have my apartment and live and help my mother.\"\n\nShe certainly seems to have a determination that, you would assume, is a product of her upbringing. She insists that however lonely it was in Paris, she remained aware of how fortunate she was. \"Some people work in factories,\" she says. \"[Modelling] was hard solitude-wise, but nothing can be perfect. I'm not going to complain. The job was definitely overpaid.\"\n\nIt was in Paris that she met and fell in love with a French photographer, Cedric Van Mol. When she was 20, the two married but split four years later and divorced. She then met an American mobile phone entrepreneur Damian Gabrielle, who persuaded her to walk up the aisle again. But the marriage lasted just over a year and they divorced in 2007. Most psychiatrists would see her two failed marriages by the age of 28 as a search for a father figure. She insists, however, that she loved both men, and has no \"regrets about it\".\n\n\"Both marriages, I loved the guys. I was in love with them. They are great people and for whatever reason it didn't work out. Sometimes you love people but it's just a connection. You can't be in the same place all the time. It just happens. I still have good thoughts about them.\n\n\"If I had to come back I would still marry them because I had a great time with them. Each of them taught me something and I taught them something. It's an exchange.\" She refutes the suggestion that she may have been too young. \"I don't think I was too young. In Europe you think it's young but in my country they think you're an old lady by 22. Nobody would want you.\" This last line is delivered tongue-in-cheek. It's hard to imagine many Bond girls being left on the shelf in their mid-20s because people feel they're too old.\n\nYet Kurylenko admits that she was less than keen to get married for a second time, but was persuaded by Gabrielle. \"The second one I told him, 'we don't have to get married, it's just a signature, the most important thing is love,' but he really wanted to. He had never been married before, so he thought it was fun. He just wanted a big party. It was the best party in the world. I enjoyed it. I definitely don't regret it. It's my favourite wedding. I've been to a lot of weddings and my favourite is my own. We had so much fun, we danced, I was wearing this dress ... \" She trails off as she recalls the wedding which took place in Spain. \"We're all going to die anyway,\" she continues, \"so why not have the fun stuff in your life.\"\n\nNow single, understandably she says has no desire to get married again. \"It's not important. I'd rather be in love.\" Instead, she is content to have a good time at other people's weddings, which leads her to ask if one day she can come to mine. At that moment I know exactly how 007 feels. You just can't say no to a Bond girl.\n\nQuantum of Solace is in cinemas nationwide"
