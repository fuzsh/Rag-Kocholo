She has become known to the public after the appearance in the image of the new James Bond’s girlfriend in the movie Quantum of Solace.\n\nSuch movies with her participation as Oblivion, Seven Psychopaths, La corrispondenza have gained broad popularity.\n\nChildhood and youth\n\nOlga Kurylenko was born on the 14th of November, 1979 in the Ukrainian town of Berdiansk. She is a Scorpio according to her zodiac sign. Her father Konstantin Kurylenko is Ukrainian by his origin and her mother Marina Alyabysheva came from Irkutsk region and had Russian-Belarusian roots.\n\nHer parents separated in a short time after their daughter's birth. Olga stayed to live with her mother who was suffering because of her husband’s leaving. They had to make ends meet as they hardly had enough money. Olga Kurylenko's mother was working as an ordinary art teacher and received a low salary. The family lacked money.\n\nThe woman gave private art lessons in attempts to earn additionally but hasn't improved the situation. Olga’s mother was forced to leave to earn money.

But anyway she hasn't left her desire to receive a good education. The girl attended the music school where she was learning to play the piano and also visited the ballet school. At the same time, the future celebrity has never dreamed of becoming a pianist or a ballet dancer. At that time Olga Kurylenko even didn't think of the acting career and of popularity. The girl wanted to become a doctor as well as her beloved grandmother.\n\nWhen Olga turned thirteen, her mother took her to Moscow. In the Russian capital, has managed to get a highly paid job. Once in the Moscow subway, Olga was noticed by the representative of the model agency who offered her to take part in the casting. But when the man learned that the girl was only thirteen years old, she didn't receive any more offers from the model agency. But Olga still had thoughts about the modeling future. In a short time, the girl began to attend the model courses.\n\nTwo years later Olga Kurylenko brought her portfolio to Madison agency. Her mother helped her to make this portfolio. The girl got this job. Having concluded the favorable contract, being just sixteen years, the girl went to Paris.\n\nThe model arrived in France having the basic knowledge of the English language. The girl didn't know the French language at all. At first, the girl had only one thought to come back to her homeland. But her first success helped her to overcome the difficulties of the behind the scenes of the model industry.\n\nIn a short time, the photos of the beautiful girl appeared on the covers of the popular magazines. Vogue, ELLE and Marie Claire published the model's photos with great pleasure, and the well-known Nivea cosmetic company even chose Olga Kurylenko as the face of their advertising campaign in Japan. After the Nivea campaign, the girl received similar offers from Clarins and Helena Rubinstein cosmetic brands.\n\nBy the end of the nineties, Olga Kurylenko who possesses beautiful appearance (her growth is 176 cm, and she weighs 64 kilos) has achieved great success in her model career. One could see the images of the Ukrainian model even on the large billboards in New York. The girl was showered with the offers from the model agencies.

She began to take acting skills lessons at the prestigious Parisian drama school.\n\nMovies\n\nOlga Kurylenko had her debut in cinematography in 2001. The beginning actress received the episodic role in the series Largo Winch. Later there followed other roles among which it’s worth noting the role of Kurylenko in the low-budget erotic picture L'annulaire. In this movie, Olga appeared in the leading role, but the picture turned out to be a failure.\n\nIn 2006 the model has won the right to be considered the actress. This year Olga Kurylenko played the role of the vampire in the picture Paris, I Love You. The well-known actor Elijah Wood became her partner on the movie set. During the same period, there were released two more movies with the participation of the actress – Le porte-bonheur and Le serpent.

Jack is going to look for the truth and to face the truth\", – Kurylenko told at the press conference in Moscow where she presented the movie together with Tom Cruise.\n\nIn 2015 the fans of Olga Kurylenko saw their favorite movie actress in the picture Momentum.

In 1999 the actress got married for the first time. The photographer Cedric van Mol became her husband. At the same time, Olga became the citizen of France. Together the couple has lived for four years, but later they decided to break up.\n\nThe American businessman Damian Gabrielle became the second husband of Kurylenko in 2006. Just in half a year, they began to have problems in their marriage. She had children neither in the first marriage nor in the second one.\n\nFor a long time, Olga Kurylenko was dedicating her life for work and new roles only and concentrated her energy on the acting career. In 2015 the press began to talk about the love affair of Olga with the London actor and journalist Max Benitz despite the secrecy of the actress. In autumn of the same year, Olga gave birth to their son Alexander Max Horatio.\n\nIn April of 2017 for the first time \"Bond's girlfriend\" showed her son to the public.

The actress prefers versatile rest quiet as well as extreme. Kurylenko loves the movies directed by David Lynch and Lars Von Trier.\n\nAnd the greatest dream for Olga is to earn one billion dollars. She needs this money to open the modern hospital in which there will be the latest medical technologies. And all the people who need it will get this for free. She has already taken the first step to the charity activity. The actress has helped to buy medical equipment for Berdiansk local hospital.\n\nEven though Olga earns huge fees for the shootings in the movies, she doesn't refuse to take part in the advertising campaigns. She advertises cosmetic hair brands, perfumes, and even elite alcohol brand.\n\nOlga Kurylenko at present\n\nAt present, the actress continues to work actively in the movies and advertising. In 2017 at International Toronto Film Festival there was premiered the movie The Death of Stalin directed by Armando Iannucci. The plot is focused on the narration of the situation around the death of the general secretary after which there began the struggle for the power. Nikita Khrushchev and Lavrentiy Beria also take part in this struggle. Olga Kurylenko received the secondary role, but it was the crucial role in the plot. The actress performed the role of the pianist Maria Yudina. It was she who put to the envelope with the phonograph record the note with the wish of death to Joseph Stalin. But you should remember that after all this is the political and satirical comedy.\n\nIn Russia, a lot of people met this picture as a mockery at the history. Moreover, there was published the open letter to the Minister of Culture of the Russian Federation - Vladimir Medinsky from the Russian artists. As a result, two days before the premiere the movie’s distribution certificate was canceled.\n\nIn 2018 the actress enriched her filmography with a couple of pictures at once. In September there was premiered the thriller Mara featuring Olga in the significant role. The news about her participation in this movie appeared already in 2014. And when the fans of this genre learned that \"the special effect person\" Javier Botet would be Kurylenko's partner in this movie, they had no doubts in the \"horror\" of this picture. Botet's participation means that there will be something lean, flexible, terrible, with long curvy fingers. Before the movie came out, the actress began to publish scaring shots from this horror on her Instagram and Twitter.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Olga Kurylenko copes with skill with any movie genre. So, in April of 2018, there came out the fantastic thriller Dans la brume. The French actor Romain Duris became her partner on the movie set. He is famous for his roles in the following movies – Froth on the Daydream, Heartbreaker and All the Money in the World.\n\nAnd on the 20th of September there came out the long-awaited sequel of the picture Johnny English Reborn - Johnny English Strikes Again. Olga Kurylenko will become the new beloved of the leading character. It's rather funny as earlier the actress performed the role of James Bond's girlfriend, and the series of the movies about the unfortunate spy is a parody to Bondiana.\n\nFilmography\n\n2001 – Largo Winch\n\n2006 – Paris, je t'aime\n\n2007 – Hitman\n\n2008 – Max Payne\n\n2008 – Quantum of Solace\n\n2010 – Centurion\n\n2011 – There Be Dragons\n\n2011 – Land of Oblivion\n\n2012 – Seven Psychopaths\n\n2013 – Oblivion\n\n2014 – Empires of the Deep\n\n2015 – Momentum\n\n2017 – The Death of Stalin\n\n2018 – Mara\n\n2018 – Johnny English Strikes Again\n\nPhoto"
