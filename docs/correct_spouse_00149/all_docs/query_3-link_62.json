        "text": "Dwyane Wade should've consulted with his better half. The Bulls guard and future Hall of Famer fell victim to the pressures of social media, and got in on Chance the Rapper's #SoGoneChallenge, and posted a video of himself rapping over the instrumental to R&B goddess Monica's 2003 jam by the same name and embarrassed himself before all 5.78 million of his followers. He's as wack on the mic as he's nice on the court.\n\nMORE: NBA stars set to play against their old team in 16-17\n\nIt's easy to see how the three-time champion got caught up. He's a hit on Snapchat and all the cool kids were doing it. Homie should've staye in his own lane though. All he had to do was defer to his better half for some objective insight into whether or night he should've kicked a rhyme.\n\nWade's wife, actress Gabrielle Union wasn't too far away, and would've told him to stick to his day job instead of rapping.\n\nWhere Wade was weak, another member of his NBA brotherhood, Blazers' guard Damian Lillard, arguably the best \"rapthlete\" in the world, was strong.\n\n. @Dame_Lillard bringing it on the #SoGoneChallenge ‚ô®‚ô® pic.twitter.com/mYVi4LiMMT\n\n‚Äî Monica (@MonicaBrown) August 13, 2016\n\nLillard wasn't the only athlete to get their bars off either.\n\nCheck out former NFL wideout and current NFL Network personality Nate Burelson's skills.\n\n#SoGoneChallenge Y'all thought I was joking when I said I can rap? #ART = #AthletesRapToo...I see you @Dame_Lillard pic.twitter.com/UHTT6nfB6J\n\n‚Äî Nathaniel E Burleson (@Nate13Burleson) August 16, 2016\n\nIowa State point guard Monte Morris, represented his hometown of Flint, Mich. with some autobiographical, instropective lyrics.\n\n#SoGoneChallenge üî•üî•üî•‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/joAdoQqgha\n\n‚Äî BigGame (@MonteMorris11) August 16, 2016\n\nAlways the show stopper, Monica, who's married to former NBA guard Shannon Brown, shut the challenge down, with her own offering in the challenge, including a cameo by none other than Missy Elliot, who produced the \"So Gone.\"\n\nIn studio with @missyelliott and decided to join my own challenge #SoGoneChallenge you all continue to inspire me‚ù§Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/IGaG28nYYH\n\n‚Äî Monica (@MonicaBrown) August 16, 2016\n\nWho's going to take the challenge next?"
