        "text": "You were probably introduced to Olga Kurylenko in 2007, when she starred as Nika Boronina in the film adaptation of the popular video game Hitman. Or in 2008, when she became a Bond Girl in Quantum of Solace. In the five years since, the beautiful model and actress has seen her career ascend through high-profile modeling gigs and starring roles in summer blockbusters. She's the star of two wildly different upcoming films — Oblivion, a sci-fi epic starring Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, and helmed by Tron: Legacy director Joseph Kosinski; and To the Wonder, the latest film by Terrence Malick, out this weekend. As we approach the release of these movies, a list of facts you may want to know about Olga Kurylenko, and a few extra photos, below:\n\nDespite being born in Soviet Ukraine, she acquired French citizenship in 2001.\n\nShe trained as a ballerina and studied the piano for seven years.\n\nAfter her parents divorced when she was 3, her mother and grandmother raised her.\n\nShe grew up in poverty, and had to wear homemade clothes and ratty sweaters to school.\n\nShe was discovered at age 13, when a talent agent spotted her in a Moscow subway station.\n\nShe learned French in six months, after moving to Paris at age 16 for her modeling career.\n\nShe speaks Russian and English fluently, too.\n\nHer first acting appearance came in 2003, in the music video for Seal's \"Love's Divine.\"\n\nShe has been married twice: in 2000 to French fashion photographer Cedric van Mol, and in 2006, to American cellphone accessory entrepreneur Damian Gabrielle.\n\nShe was told she'd be the next Bond Girl on Christmas Eve, 2007. Merry Christmas, indeed."
