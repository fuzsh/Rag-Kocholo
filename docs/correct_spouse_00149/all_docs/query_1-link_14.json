        "text": "What if we could go back in time and have the confidence we did as kids? 🤔 I LOVE this clip from a little over a year ago when my youngest girls were 7 & 9 💖 Their responses to Michelle’s question taught me a lot about how much we adults can second-guess ourselves. What an advantage it is to exude that childlike self-confidence we’re each born with! Enjoy this clip from the first interview my kids have ever been part of and huge thanks to 🍒 Michelle Falanga ⎮ Voice Actor-Writer-Actor 🍒 and Jessica Lewis 🦋 Voiceover Artist for the opportunity! Check out the link to the full interview in their post 👇 #LindleyKidsVO #KidVoices #PodcastInterview #TeamLindley\n\nI love this beautiful FREE offering put on by Natasha Marchewka & Kim Wilson ⎮ Voice Talent of Speechless Voiceover Industry Podcast. I've heard from so many voiceover colleagues about the issue of rejection. It can kill your motivation, steal your joy, and create apathy when trying to move forward in your business. No one wants that for you, my friends. If you've ever experienced this, I hope you'll sign up for this FREE event happening a week from today. These four are TOP industry experts (2 coaches & 2 casting directors) and straight shooters when it comes to sharing truth. Check out this webinar and others offered by Speechless VO at https://lnkd.in/gpZhtQHQ Be encouraged today! #OnlineEvent #FacingRejection #CareerAdvice #SpeechlessVO #Voiceover #VoiceActing\n\nLast night’s class hosted by National Association of Voice Actors (NAVA) with my good friends Maria Pendolino and Carin Gilfry was a massive success! We raised over $3500 for Vocal Victims Advocacy Group and there were nearly 90 live attendees with several more who purchased tickets for replay access. There was joy, motivation, truth bombs, and gold nuggets filling the Zoom room and the support for one another was absolutely incredible. ✨ Some may not know this, but when I was first starting out in my career, Maria was already 4 years into hers, and she has generously answered several of my questions through the years. So in her honor, I want to share my slide deck with everyone in case it’s helpful. May you also look for ways you can give a hand up to someone behind you 🤝 #SupportOthers #SecretsToSuccess #Friendship #Mentorship #TracyLindleyVoiceovers #Voiceover #Journey\n\nThis lil cutie is on FIRE! 🔥 Yesterday she had a double session day and her first experience working with an international client! 🙌 Alina’s first commercial booking of the day came from our incredible agent, Vincent LeBica at DPN TALENT, INC. where she played a sick kid who needed some medicine. 🤒 One of the producers said he wanted to reach through the line and give her a hug, she sounded so convincing! 🤗 The second session came as a kind referral from bilingual Spanish voice talent Jhoana Nichols - Hispanic Voice Actress—check her out if you’re looking for a female Spanish voice talent or accented English! Alina has been working towards learning Spanish through DuoLingo this summer, so she was delighted to recognize a few words from a native speaker during the session—but we’re grateful our engineer was bilingual! 🇲🇽 This kid is just a natural and even understands that pants in the booth are not required 🤷🏻♀️🙈 So thankful for all those who are making these opportunities possible for my babies! 😍🫶🥰 —— Need a kid voice for your next project? I’ve probably got one who can help! Reach out anytime and feel free to check out their demos under the “Kids” tab on my website #LindleyKidsVO #YoungVoices #KidVoiceover #MomManager #TracyLindleyVoiceovers #VoiceoverFamily\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time someone asked to \"pick my brain\"... well I'd at least have enough to buy a chicken sandwich 🤷♀️ But y'know what, we ALL need advice no matter what stage we're at in our careers. So myself, Carin Gilfry and Maria Pendolino are here for you! 💖 We are coming in hot with a 15-minute chat each to give you our tops tips on what we think has helped move the needle in each of our 6-figure voiceover careers. And the cool part is that we've all found success our own way! 🙌 Then, bring ALL your burning questions for an extensive time of Q&A--ask us anything! 🔥 We invite YOU to join the three of us TOMORROW NIGHT for a 90-minute class starting at 4pm PT/7pm ET. Tickets are \"pay what you can\" and every single dollar goes to the Vocal Victims Advocacy Group to fund legal action to help repay a group of 80+ voice actors collectively owed $75K. In the voiceover industry, we support our own 🤝 ❣ Sign up at https://lnkd.in/grtvzzbH *** Replay access will be sent to everyone who purchases a ticket *** See you tomorrow night on Zoom! #NAVAVoices #OnlineEvent #SecretsToSuccess #VocalVictimsAdvocacyGroup #CarinGilfry #MariaPendolino #TracyLindleyVoiceovers #LadyBosses\n\nAs an avid podcast listener, it's always such an honor when I'm asked to come on a podcast and share my story. Episode 223 of Voice Acting Stories features the first half of my conversation with host and voice actor Veronica Barrera and we had the best time! Topics ranged from who I would most love to have dinner with, to AI, to why I love connecting on LinkedIn, to advice to my younger self, and everything in between! Curious to hear our chat? Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/gvGUjXAK Part 2 drops next week! #Podcast #Interview #TracyLindleyVoiceovers #VoiceActingStories\n\nThat glass ceiling has another crack in it!⚡️ If you watched the presidential debate last night, you might have heard my voice during the first commercial break—for this Fox News Media promo! 📺 As every seasoned voice actor knows, promo is notoriously difficult to get into, but even harder if you’re a woman. 💁🏻♀️ Yet Fox is breaking tradition and showing their support for more female voices in promo by hiring this mom of four in Missouri to reach the masses. 🗣️🎤 And to think that I never would have had a chance to audition if I hadn’t sent a LinkedIn message to a producer at Fox News waaayy back in 2015. 📥 Direct marketing has the power to connect two professionals who need each other, even in this wildly improbable scenario. 🤯 I am incredibly grateful to be chosen for this opportunity, and even more thankful that Fox sees the value in making sure America hears more women’s voices. 🔊 Looking forward to whatever lies ahead! #WomenInPromo #TracyLindleyVoiceovers #FoxNews #FemaleVoiceTalent #BreakingGlassCeilings #WomenInVoiceover #FemaleVoices"
