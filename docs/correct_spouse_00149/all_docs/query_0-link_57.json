        "text": "\"Thank God I`m single... I read medical books in my spare time... You just get in front of the camera and smile, even if you don`t feel happy. So it`s a lie... I do love hamburgers...\" Interview\n\nStunning actress Olga Kurylenko told how her mother feared she was going to be kidnapped by sex traffickers.\n\nThe new Bond beauty`s big break came when she was approached by a modelling agency on the Moscow subway aged just 15.\n\nBut her mum refused to let her talk to the firm because she was concerned that it was run by gangsters.\n\nOlga said: \"I went on vacation to Moscow with my mum and a woman stopped us on a subway.\n\n\"She spoke to my mum and said she thought I could be a model.\n\n\"But my mum and I went back to the Ukraine because we thought we would have to talk about it.\n\n\"Then she called and asked us to come to do some tests. Mum came with me to see everything was fine and that it was a real agency and not some trafficking of girls to become sex slaves.\n\n\"When she knew it was all real, she let me go alone.\n\n\"So I started travelling around the Ukraine and then Europe.\"\n\nNow Olga, 28, is the latest Bond femme fatale, ensuring that once more the famous spy is starring alongside an impossibly beautiful woman.\n\nAnd while the good news for all single men out there is that the Ukranian beauty is also unattached, having recently divorced from her second husband Damien Gabrielle, the bad news is that she is loving being young, free and single.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who lives in Paris, said: \"I want to say, `Thank God I`m single,` but that might offend people.\n\n\"Sorry, but I ended a relationship a few months ago and I`ve had enough.\n\n\"I`m really enjoying my freedom. Nobody asks, `Where are you going? What have you been doing? Why?` I hate those questions. I hate jealousy, I hate possessiveness.\n\n\"Why do people always want to possess you and try to make you their thing? I`m nobody`s possession. I`d rather be alone than deal with that.\"\n\nStarring next to Daniel Craig in the latest Bond film Quantum Of Solace, the highly anticipated sequel to Casino Royale, the model turned actress looks set to be a Hollywood A-Lister by the time she is 30.\n\nAnd that`s quite an achievement, considering the level of poverty she was born into.\n\nShe was born in the Ukranian city of Berdyansk to a Ukrainian father and Russian mother. They divorced when she was just three, leaving Olga to be raised singlehandedly by her mum.\n\nAnd while she used to dream of growing up to be an actress, one job grabbed her attention even more.\n\nOlga said: \"I went to school theatre so I was always participating in plays. I loved it.\n\n\"But while that was high on my dreams, there was something I wanted to do even more - to be a doctor. I love medicine and I`m very passionate about it.\n\n\"My grandmother was a doctor and had all these medical books at home and I kept reading them.\n\n\"I think it`s so amazing. I even still read medical books in my spare time.\n\n\"My mum used to come in and she`d find me looking at these horrible and disgusting pictures in the books. She couldn`t understand it.\"\n\nOLGA`S acting career took off in France three years ago when she starred in a string of French films.\n\nThen last year, she appeared alongside Dougray Scott in Xavier Gens` film Hitman.\n\nFrom there, she landed the role of Camille, a morally ambiguous Russian-Bolivian agent, in Quantum Of Solace, beating off a string of A-list Hollywood actresses. Not that Olga is allowing herself to get carried away in all the hype.\n\nShe said: \"I`d rather not talk about that because who knows? I have a few projects that may happen, but until it`s definite I don`t like to say in case it doesn`t work out.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, Olga says she reckons Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever, saying she thinks he suits the part perfectly and is a great actor.\n\nShe even reckons nude scenes alongside 007 were a breeze.\n\nShe said: \"The sex scenes are OK, I can handle it. I`m used to it. I`ve done a lot of modeling and I`ve done naked scenes a few times before.\n\n\"There`s nothing to be anxious about. If other people don`t make a big deal about it, then you won`t feel uncomfortable.\n\n\"My mother taught me that there is nothing to laugh at or be embarrassed about when it comes to the human body. We are all made in the same way.\"\n\nAnd Olga reckons acting is a much more honest way of earning her living than modelling ever was.\n\nAlthough she still does the odd bit of pouting and posing for TV adverts and campaigns that appeal to her, Olga thinks acting is a far more truthful profession.\n\nShe said: \"A modeling career is nothing to look for, there`s no research. It`s just a lie. It`s just pictures.\n\n\"You just get in front of the camera and smile, even if you don`t feel happy. So it`s a lie. It`s not you. It`s all fake.\n\n\"But you can`t lie in a movie. If you`re acting, you have to be involved.\n\n\"Even if you`re sad, the moment you play the person, if she`s happy you have to find the happiness somewhere. It`s a different thing. You have to be there. You can`t just be detached.\"\n\nIt is just as well for Olga that her film career is taking off so spectacularly, as she reckons it`s time to quit the catwalk.\n\nShe said: \"It`s coming to an end little by little. I don`t think I am too old to model as such.\n\n\"If I had nothing else to do, I could still get a lot of work as a model. I could work for at least seven years - until I was 35, easily.\n\n\"I see the girls now and there are some models even past age that and they still look great.\n\n\"There`s work for every age, so they need models that are older, too. That`s not a problem, but I`m done with it.\n\n\"I want to do something else and I want to have fun.\n\n\"I`m very impatient to do other things.\" And annoyingly, Olga claims that she doesn`t do much in the way of work to keep her fabulous figure in shape - even admitting a penchant for hamburgers.\n\nShe said: \"I`m so bad. I`m really lazy. But for the movie I`ve been going to the gym and training a lot.\n\n\"When it`s accessible, I`ll work out. But where I live in Paris, there`s no gym around me, so I don`t do it as a part of my normal life.\n\n\"There`s no way I`d take time to do it. Well, if I had a gym on my roof, maybe.\n\n\"My mum has a good figure, but you always have to maintain it. It`s always better when I work out.\n\n\"But I do love hamburgers. I`m always looking for a good burger.\n\n\"I like to eat everything, it`s just a matter of balance.\""
