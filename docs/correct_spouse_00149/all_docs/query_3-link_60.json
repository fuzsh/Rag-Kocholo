He’s been at bp around 12 years and recently moved from the US to India to help set up our new TSI center in Pune. ✈️ “I’m a mechanical engineer by background, but the core of what I do is supporting people to achieve the best they can to overcome barriers in their work,” he says. 🚧 “What excites me with TSI is applying the positive bp culture to hard-working new team members. This all comes down to ‘who we are’: living our purpose, playing to win and caring for others.” 🥇 Want to know more? Read Vaibhav’s full story below and check out our latest TSI job opportunities. 👀 #lifeatbp\n\nJugaad….a term I had heard of but didn’t understand its magnitude until I arrived in India. We’ve been living in India for 4 months now, and I can't believe how much I've grown to love this country! The people have been extremely warm and welcoming, and I've learned so much from their diverse perspectives. What really stands out is their resilience and resourcefulness. They've taught me to embrace chaos and find beauty in unexpected places. I am even more grateful to be part of the new technical hub in Pune #bptsi where I’ll have a chance to work with the country’s ambitious talent. To top it off - the natural beauty is breathtaking - we’ve been enjoying the local sites - from the Dagusheth Ganesh temple to the hill station of Mahabeleswar to the beaches of Goa - we are fully soaking in everything this rich culture has to offer. #India #bptsi #jugaad #LivingInIndia #CultureShock #Foodie #NatureLover #Resilience"
