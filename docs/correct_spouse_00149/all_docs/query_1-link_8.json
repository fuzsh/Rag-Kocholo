        "text": "Like most of us when we reach our thirties, Olga Kurylenko has a few exes. They’re not ex-partners, you understand – although the Ukrainian-born beauty is twice-divorced. No, this slender star with the sultry looks is already an ex-model and an ex-Bond girl. But her ambitions don’t stop there. ‘Bond wasn’t my goal. It just happened,’ she says in her husky Slavic accent, admitting that plotting her path after co-starring with Daniel Craig in Quantum Of Solace has not been easy. ‘I said “no” a lot. But now there are other problems – not to get stuck.’\n\nIn truth, that shouldn’t be an issue for the 33-year-old, who is so famous in her home town of Berdyansk that the former mayor suggested naming a street after her. With a lead role with Tom Cruise in the post-apocalyptic Oblivion on the way, at the other end of the scale is To The Wonder, an achingly poignant art-house romance from Terrence Malick, the acclaimed director of The Tree Of Life. Kurylenko – who plays Marina, a single mother who uproots her life in Paris to be with Ben Affleck’s Oklahoma engineer – was hand-picked by Malick purely from footage he’d seen of her face.\n\nBeing Malick’s muse brings with it a fantastic career cachet, as proved the case for his Tree Of Life star Jessica Chastain. But Kurylenko, today wearing a grey Valentino dress and nude heels, is far too entrenched in the experience of working with him to worry about the aftermath. ‘You just want to cut your chest open and give everything to him,’ she says, quite seriously. ‘I had no fear. I was crazy. I did anything he asked me and I didn’t question him. I remember he asked me to open and smell the garbage, and get into it – and I did it. I knew that it’s going to look like a masterpiece afterwards.’\n\nWhat about the film’s theme – would she give up everything for love, as her character does? ‘Ideally, I think I would,’ she smiles. ‘I’m a bit of a romantic. In theory! But the mind steps in and starts talking.’\n\nGiven she has two marriages behind her – to French fashion photographer Cedric van Mol (which ended in 2004, after four years) and to entrepreneur Damian Gabrielle (which lasted little over a year) – it’s gladdening to see she hasn’t been put off affairs of the heart.\n\nNow she’s with actor Danny Huston – son of legendary director John, and Angelica’s half-brother – who is some 17 years her senior. They met on the 1950s-set US drama series Magic City – she plays a former nightclub dancer, he plays a Miami mobster – but having just shot the second season, they have yet to be on camera together.\n\n‘I have never worked with Danny – isn’t it amazing? I don’t have a single scene with him. Our characters never even cross paths – it’s ridiculous! I just want to act with him. He’s such a brilliant actor. Why does everyone else get the pleasure?’\n\nUnlike Huston, Kurylenko did not grow up as Hollywood royalty. ‘I’m just a very simple girl,’ she says. ‘Much more than anyone could imagine.’ Her parents divorced when she was three and she was raised by her art teacher mother, Marina.\n\nHer life changed when, aged 13, she was on holiday in Moscow and a modelling scout spotted her travelling on the Metro. Even now she’s blown away by this moment. ‘It was literally a miracle in my life,’ she says. ‘I kept thinking after I went back home: “It’s not only in books and movies, it happened to me!”’\n\nSigning with a Parisian agency, she moved to France – even taking French citizenship in 2001 – and landed on the covers of Vogue and Elle aged just 18. But the lifestyle of a superstar model was not for her.\n\n‘I was lonely travelling around by myself,’ she says. ‘With modelling, you go somewhere for 24 hours and you don’t even see the city, you don’t talk to people or see the culture. I didn’t keep any friends, because you can’t make friends. It’s very difficult. Also, apart from work, they all hang out in modelling crowds and parties. I never did. I didn’t feel I belonged there.’\n\nWhere she does belong is on the big screen. After an eye-catching turn in 2006 French thriller The Serpent, Kurylenko graduated from throwaway Hollywood action flicks (Hitman, Max Payne) to classier fare. Next up she’s a mystery survivor in the Cruise-led Oblivion – though Kurylenko, who moved to London in 2009, promises she’s not about to head to Hollywood. ‘When I’m in America, I feel like I’m so far away from my roots,’ she says, ‘and here I don’t – I’m European. Just walking on the street in London makes you feel like everything has a meaning.’ Malick would be proud.\n\nTo The Wonder opens tomorrow."
