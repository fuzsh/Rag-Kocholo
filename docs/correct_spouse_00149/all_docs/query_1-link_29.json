        "text": "It was in 1993 that Hollywood realized the dream of putting a video game movie up on the big screen with Super Mario Bros., and setting the stage for a long legacy of questionable choices, troubled productions, and gamers’ pixel tears left in their wake. But like the kid who just has to pump in one more quarter to reach for that high score, the studios keep on trying (while the fans just keep on hoping), and we’re celebrating that sort of sheer tenacity with this guide to the best video game movies (and plenty of the worst) ranked by Tomatometer!\n\n(Photo by Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nHere, you will find the near-decent (Rampage, Resident Evil), the should’ve-been-goods (Assassin’s Creed, Warcraft), the ridiculous-but-we-love-thems (Mortal Kombat, Silent Hill), and the ones made by Uwe Boll, who deserves his own category (Alone in the Dark, House of the Dead). We’re using a 20-review minimum cutoff for inclusion from theatrical releases only, because it’s not just enough to make a questionable movie, critics need to witness the aftermath, too.\n\nAnd in May 2019, Detective Pikachu officially broke the video game curse! Fitting that Nintendo, whose Super Mario Bros. movie started all this trouble, would be the one to end it. And in another surprise 2019 development, the second Angry Birds movie has slingshot the naysayers by racking up plenty of critical praise, toppling Pikachu mere months after its release.\n\nThen in 2020, when it didn’t seem it had a chili dog’s chance in hell, Sonic the Hedgehog to general critics enthusiasm, marking three Fresh video game movies in two years. And then, in 2021, Werewolves Within went Certified Fresh, establishing it as by-far the best-reviewed video game movie!\n\nThe latest, 2023’s The Super Mario Bros., dives back to familiar territory for this genre, which seems like it will perpetually dance on the edge of Freshdom. Also from this year: Gran Turismo, based on the long-running hardcore sim from Sony, and which the poster really, totally wants to make sure you know it’s BASED ON A TRUE STORY. Then Five Nights at Freddy sliced up some horror for Saw-lite thrills. See all the high scores (and lots and lots of the lows) with our guide to video game movies ranked by Tomatometer, with Certified Fresh film(s) first! —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\nWerewolves Within (2021) 86%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 93055%\n\nCritics Consensus: Werewolves Within is the rare horror comedy that offers equal helpings of either genre -- and adds up to a whole lot of fun in the bargain.\n\nSynopsis: After a proposed pipeline creates divisions within the small town of Beaverfield, and a snowstorm traps its residents together inside...

After settling in Green...

Aiding in the... [More]\n\nDirected By: Rob Letterman\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 77886%\n\nCritics Consensus: Gran Turismo's brisk action and feel-good underdog drama are undermined by its loose telling of the fact-based story, but this is still a generally solid racing movie.\n\nSynopsis: Based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough, the film is the ultimate wish fulfillment tale of a teenage Gran...

Powered with incredible speed, Sonic embraces his new home on...

Movie is a colorful -- albeit thinly plotted -- animated adventure that has about as many Nintendos as Nintendon'ts.\n\nSynopsis: Mario and Luigi go on a whirlwind adventure through Mushroom Kingdom, uniting with a cast of familiar characters to defeat...

Hoping to solve the mystery...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Paul W.S. Anderson\n\n#17\n\nAdjusted Score: 45374%\n\nCritics Consensus: It doesn't offer much in the way of substance, but Prince of Persia is a suitably entertaining swashbuckler -- and a substantial improvement over most video game adaptations.\n\nSynopsis: In the holy city of Alamut resides the Sands of Time, which gives mortals the power to turn back time....
