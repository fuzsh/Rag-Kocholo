        "text": "Pabst Blue Ribbon was the beer of choice in Suzy Denison’s family.\n\nIt was the 1930s and ’40s in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and her uncles were distributors of the light-as-air American lager.\n\nKnown colloquially as “PBR,” the bestselling beer appealed to the pocketbook, keeping thirst at bay without letting flavor get in the way.\n\nDenison, now 91, was around 7 or 8 when her parents allowed her “one sip” of the wispy beer. Although the taste has faded from her memory, she’s certain it was “a far cry from ale, porter or stout” — the bolder, more popular beers of today.\n\nWhile she couldn’t have known it at the time, Denison would grow up to become a historic figure in the modern microbrewery movement — a role she’s just begun to get credit for.\n\nAmerica’s first modern microbrewery\n\nIn 1976, a year before Pabst Blue Ribbon would see its sales peak at 18 million barrels, Denison (then Stern) was new to Sonoma County when she was introduced to Jack McAuliffe, a local homebrewer.\n\nMcAuliffe shared his dream of opening a small, local brewery with beers inspired by the English-style ales, stouts and porters he’d sampled while stationed in Scotland with the U.S. Navy.\n\nDenison, a recently divorced mother of three nearly-grown children, was up for an adventure. So she and her friend Jane Zimmerman pitched in $1,500 each to fund McAuliffe’s idea.\n\nThe result would become New Albion Brewing Company, the country’s modern microbrewery, according to the California Craft Beer Association. Located in Sonoma, the brewery was a partnership between Denison, McAuliffe and Zimmerman, who worked together to build the brand from the ground up.\n\nWhile McAuliffe designed the brewery and sourced a mishmash of parts (often from the junkyard), Denison and Zimmerman got a crash course in building permits, welding and sheetrocking.\n\nBy the time New Albion opened its doors in 1977, their compact, gravity-fed brewery was the smallest licensed operation in the United States.\n\nThe New Albion difference\n\nIn a country flooded with complex, artisan microbrews, it’s hard to imagine a time when beer was defined largely by lager.\n\nNew Albion, with its fuller-bodied, small-batch brews and use of Cascade hops, signified a sea change in the beer industry as the first modern microbrewery.\n\nWhile San Francisco’s Anchor Brewing had been producing European-style beers since 1896, New Albion was smaller (450 barrels per year) — and somewhat cobbled together — which signaled a new wave of craft brewing.\n\n“New Albion didn’t have any new brewing equipment, so Jack had to build everything out of old dairy equipment and other parts,” said Don Barkley, former brewer at New Albion. “But he did it in a way that was quite sophisticated — in an unsophisticated kind of way. His approach was very scientific.”\n\nBefore Barkley arrived in 1978, Denison and Zimmerman frequently handled the beer brewing themselves.\n\n“The work wasn’t complicated, but it was extremely labor intensive and involved very heavy lifting,” said Denison in an interview for the Smithsonian Institute’s American Brewing History Initiative. “The hardest aspect was making sure we did the brew properly. We were terrified Jack would come back and find out we had destroyed a batch. But he seemed very pleased with the both of us.”\n\nWithin a year, Zimmerman — who had gone back to school to be a marriage family counselor — decided to call it quits. Denison, however, decided to hang on.\n\n“It was very demanding work, but I enjoyed the challenge,” said Denison. “I had friends visit and they thought it was terrible I was working so hard. But it was definitely a satisfying experience.”\n\nOne day, Barkley showed up at the brewery and asked for a job. A recent graduate of UC Davis’ brewing science program, he was eager to get his feet wet.\n\n“Jack immediately turned around and threw me out the door. That was rather startling!” he said. “But I went back a month later and Suzy was sitting behind the desk. When I told her I would work for free, she asked when I could start.\"\n\nOnce Barkley and another brewer named Michael Lovett were brought on to handle brewing, Denison took over New Albion’s administrative duties. Her van — which could have been paid a salary considering how many hours it spent on the job — was put to work delivering beer.\n\nWithin a short time, New Albion became a great success, especially in the town of Sonoma where restaurants couldn’t get their hands on enough of the local brew.\n\n“It was crazy,” said Denison, in her interview with the Smithsonian. “All the places we delivered to were just thrilled. People liked that it was a small, local handmade product. And we used Cascade hops, so the flavor was excellent — and different from what people had been drinking.”\n\nAn untimely end\n\nA few years in, McAuliffe decided he wanted to expand New Albion and open a brewpub. Numerous investors were interested, but McAuliffe was insistent he maintain at least 51% of the business.\n\n“We worked very hard to bring in an investor, but Jack was unwilling to part with enough control to take the next step,” said Barkley. “He was very driven. But with his inability as an entrepreneur, he just ran out of money.”\n\nIn 1982, just six years after it was launched, New Albion closed its doors for good. McAuliffe, Barkley and Lovett went on to work for Hopland Brewery (later named Mendocino Brewing Company) in Hopland.\n\nShortly thereafter, McAuliffe left the beer industry and shied away from the spotlight for good.\n\nDenison, who was left in major debt when New Albion closed, admits she was not in a good place at the time — especially once McAuliffe disappeared into obscurity.\n\n“It was a great, difficult loss for me — a loss of identity,” she said. “I ended up leaving Sonoma and spending a year traveling in India by myself.”\n\nWhat’s in a name\n\nDenison, who has lived in Seattle since 1988, admitted she was surprised to discover she and Zimmerman had been written out of the New Albion story.\n\nToday, McAuliffe is frequently considered the godfather of the modern craft beer movement. Denison and Zimmerman are rarely mentioned.\n\n“There is absolutely no doubt Suzy was instrumental at New Albion, and it never would have gotten where it did without her,” said Barkley. “Jack’s personality was pretty rough. Suzy was able to connect with people, and that was essential in opening doors for the brewery.\"\n\nTara Nurin, a beer journalist and author of “A Woman’s Place is in the Brewhouse” (Chicago Review Press, 2021), said people often think the brewer represents the entire brewery — an assumption that’s held for centuries.\n\n“That’s just not factually accurate,” said Nurin. “Throughout history, women have worked behind the scenes and not gotten credit. In the case of New Albion, people always talk about Jack. But the reality is that there would not have been a New Albion if it weren’t for Suzy and Jane.\"\n\nNew beginnings?\n\nOver the last 40 years, numerous efforts have been made to revive New Albion.\n\nIn 1993, Jim Koch of the Boston Beer Company (Sam Adams) acquired the New Albion trademark as it was set to expire. In 2012, the brewery released a limited-edition New Albion Ale before transferring the trademarked assets back to McAuliffe.\n\nThen in 2000, McAuliffe was united with his daughter, Renee DeLuca, who had been searching for her birth father.\n\nDeLuca, who lives in Cleveland, Ohio, took over the trademark in 2013 and has since made it her mission to preserve and share the New Albion story.\n\nThis July, she collaborated with Wolf House Brewing in Cloverdale to produce a limited-edition New Albion Ale for a beer event at the Museum of Sonoma County.\n\nWhile DeLuca has toyed with the idea of reviving New Albion and giving the brewery a permanent new home, she admits it’s not in the cards for her personally. But that doesn’t mean she’s not keeping an open mind.\n\n“Honestly, if I were to find a new home for New Albion, it would definitely be in Northern California,” she said. “We’re just starting to explore that right now.”\n\nSpecial thanks to Theresa McCulla, former curator of the American Brewing History Initiative at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History, for providing access to Suzy Denison’s oral history.\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Sarah Doyle at 707-521-5478 or sarah.doyle@pressdemocrat.com.
