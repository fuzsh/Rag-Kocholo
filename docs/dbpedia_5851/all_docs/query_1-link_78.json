        "text": "Generation of family ownership: Fourth.\n\nAnnual revenues: More than $500 million in 2011.\n\nNumber of employees: 2,000 globally.\n\nYears with the company: 35.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFirst job at this company: I did a little of everything. I packed caps, swept the floor, worked in shipping and receiving, did some artwork and worked on mechanical projects. I even worked on the line making caps. It takes 22 steps to make a fitted cap—I've done all 22.\n\nMost memorable thing I learned from my father: Your word is your bond. If you tell someone you'll do something, you'd better make sure you do it.\n\nMost memorable thing I learned from my mother: The art of perfectionism. Do it right or don't do it at all.\n\nBest thing about this job: I get to see our products on the greatest athletes and entertainers in the world.\n\nWorst thing about this job: Making tough decisions about staff. Sometimes the best people don't work out.\n\nOne of our greatest successes: Our long relationship with Major League Baseball. We've been the supplier of headwear to the teams since the 1930s. If you have a product that hasn't been tried before and you believe in it, I believe any of the leagues—baseball, or the NFL or any of the leagues—will give you an opportunity. But you need a good product and a good business plan, and you must be able to show them how you can generate revenue for them.\n\nBest advice I ever got: Surround yourself with great people and learn how to listen.\n\nQuote from our company's mission statement: We believe in self-expression. We do mass customization for our customers, which gives our end-consumers the ability to buy something that reflects their affinity to a team or their personal style, for example.\n\nOn my office desk: My 2009 Yankees world championship ring. My father always got a ring from George Steinbrenner when they won, and the franchise carried on the tradition with me.\n\nOne of my greatest accomplishments: Taking a small family manufacturing company and turning it into a global brand. To go global, be prepared to spend a lot of time in the markets you want to develop.\n\nAdvice I'd give someone wishing to enter this business: It might look fun, but you better be prepared for long hours. We go up against the likes of brands like Nike, Reebok and others.\n\nOn a day off I like toâ¦ spend time with family and golf or ski.\n\nPhilanthropic causes our family supports: Cancer research. My father died of cancer, so it's a cause that's close to us.\n\nB>Book(s) I think every family business leader should read: Why Me? Wealth: Creating, Receiving, and Passing It On, by Denise Kenyon-Rouvinez, Thierry Lombard, Matthieu Ricard and John Ward.\n\nI realized I had emerged from my parents' shadow whenâ¦ my father came to my office door and asked if I had a few minutes to talk. For years, on Saturdays, I'd try to get the courage to go to his office and ask him about the business.\n\nFuture succession plans: My two older children have chosen different paths. We have executives and professional managers in place and are preparing to move forward without another family member. But I'm only 51; I have a long way to go.\n\nWords I live by: Don't ever assume. Get the facts and make educated decisions.\n\n— As told to Patricia Olsen"
