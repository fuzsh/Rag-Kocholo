        "text": "BUFFALO, N.Y. – Christopher H. Koch, CEO of New Era Cap Co., has been named the 2013 Buffalo Niagara Executive of the Year by the University at Buffalo School of Management.\n\nThe award will be presented at the 64th Annual School of Management Alumni Association Awards Banquet beginning at 5:30 p.m. on Nov. 6, at the Statler Hotel, 107 Delaware Ave., Buffalo.\n\nKoch was selected by a vote of past honorees and the board of directors of the alumni association, who cited his strategic vision and commitment to Western New York.\n\nA fourth generation CEO of the family-owned company, Koch has exhibited drive and passion while carrying on his family name and transforming the New Era brand into an iconic international symbol.\n\nHeadquartered in Buffalo, New Era is an international lifestyle brand with an authentic sports heritage that dates back more than 90 years. Best known for being the official on-field cap for Major League Baseball and the National Football League, New Era is the brand of choice not only for its headwear collection, but also for its accessories and apparel lines.\n\nKoch participates on a variety of boards, including the Buffalo Sabres Foundation, the National Federation for Just Communities of Western New York and the Erie County Law Enforcement Foundation. This year he was appointed by New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo as a UB Council member. He has also served on the national board of the Jackie Robinson Foundation since 2009.\n\nEstablished in 1949, the Buffalo Niagara Executive of the Year award is presented annually to an individual who resides in or has a major impact on the region, and whose career has been distinguished by executive success and civic leadership. Recent honorees include Michael W. Cropp, president and CEO of Independent Health, James R. Kaskie, president and CEO of Kaleida Health, Donna M. Fernandes, president and CEO of the Buffalo Zoo, John R. Koelmel, president and CEO of First Niagara Financial Group Inc., and Robert D. Gioia, president of The John R. Oishei Foundation.\n\nFor information about the awards banquet, contact the School of Management’s Office of Alumni and External Relations at mgt-alumni@buffalo.edu or 716-645-3224."
