        "text": "Over the course of his 20-year career, Chris Koch has carved a niche for himself directing films and TV shows featuring slightly off-kilter but lovable characters and the often embarrassing situations in which they find themselves. His earliest directing credits came on the '90s Nickelodeon series, \"The Adventures of Pete and Pete,\" which follows the surreal adventures of two red haired brothers (Big Pete and Little Pete) and their equally bizarre friends and neighbors. In 2000, Koch made his feature film debut with the Chevy Chase comedy, \"Snow Day,\" about a group of students who plot to keep their snowed-in school closed. A few years later, he helmed the romantic comedy, \"A Guy Thing,\" which starred skateboarder-turned-actor Jason Lee as a hapless groom who jeopardizes his relationship with his controlling fiancee by accidentally sleeping with her cousin. The two later reunited when Koch directed over a dozen episodes of Lee's award-winning sitcom, \"My Name is Earl,\" about a repentant criminal's attempts to make up for his checkered past. Between 2003 and 2010, Koch also directed numerous episodes of the quirky medical comedy, \"Scrubs,\" and worked on the TV movie, \"Lipshitz Saves the World,\" about a high school outcast who may be the world's last, best hope. Koch has since directed multiple episodes of the multi-generational sitcom, \"Modern Family,\" and the life-after-divorce comedy, \"Cougar Town.\""
