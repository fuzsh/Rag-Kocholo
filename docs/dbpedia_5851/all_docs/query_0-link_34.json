        "text": "The title of Christopher Koch’s third novel, The Doubleman, perfectly captures the complex nature of its ­creator. Koch was a restless traveller, who ­remained deeply attached to his native Tasmania. He believed that the tan­gible world existed alongside an invis­ible world of spirits. He felt that beauty was never far away from terror, whether in the landscape or in human nature. These were the ideas that he explored in eight meticulously crafted novels.\n\nMany of his books were inspired or influenced by people and places close to his heart. Koch is best known for his 1978 novel The Year of Living Dangerously, which draws on his younger brother’s life as a journalist in Indonesia during the violent breakdown of ­President Sukarno’s regime.\n\nIn"
