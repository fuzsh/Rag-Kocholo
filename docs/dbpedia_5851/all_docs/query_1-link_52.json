        "text": "Kyle Steven Koch, 56, of Wyoming, MN passed away peacefully and surrounded by his family on April 9, 2021, after a brief battle with cancer.\n\nHe was born July 9, 1964 to Pius & Jeanette (Weekes) Koch in Bismarck, ND. He attended elementary school in Flasher, ND and graduated high school in 1982 from Carrington High School in Carrington, ND. He attended Bismarck Junior College, studying automotive technology and began his career at Sheldon Joppru Toyota in Bismarck. He married Holly Wolff in 1984 and they moved to the Twin Cities in 1988, when Kyle became a technician with Maplewood Toyota, where he worked until the time of his death.\n\nKyle was a devoted, loving father to his two children and raising his kids was his ultimate pride and priority of life. His son Rory was born in 1987 and his daughter Chelsey was born in 1991. Kyle was so excited to welcome his first grandson Elliot to the family in 2019 and was thrilled to learn a second grandchild is expected in September 2021.\n\nKyle had a beautiful relationship with Jesus and was always guided by his Catholic faith. He was honored to serve as an usher at St. Peter Catholic Church in Forest Lake, MN. He was known for the many ways he could connect with people and offer generosity to his family, neighbors, friends and strangers.\n\nKyle was passionate about his hobbies: dirt-track racing, golfing, Elvis music and attending concerts - especially Garth Brooks and Kenny Chesney. He always cheered for the Denver Broncos and his favorite quarterback, John Elway.\n\nDuring Kyle’s 33 year career with Toyota, he received the national Quality Champion Award eight times, most recently just three weeks ago. In 2010, he was honored to be inducted into the prestigious International Customer Service Champions Society. He attended the ceremony in Japan with Chelsey, where just one person in the world was named in his category.\n\nHe is survived by son, Rory (Alexis) Koch; grandson, Elliott and arriving grandchild; daughter, Chelsey Koch (Mike Mann); Holly Koch, mother of his children; parents, Pius & Jeanette Koch; brother, Carey (Bobbi) Koch; sister, Kim Schafer (Stacy Gall); brother, Kevin (Lisa) Koch; and his nieces/nephews: Amanda (Chris), Harley & Arianna Johnson, Christopher Koch (Danielle Feland), Cole (Stephanie) Schafer, Megan (Drew) Papke, Hannah and Emelia Koch. Kyle was honored to be the Godfather to Amanda Johnson, Hannah Koch, Curtis Reisnour & Ashley Reisnour. He was preceded in death by his grandparents, brother Craig Koch and brother-in-law Ron Schafer.\n\nFrom the very beginning of Kyle’s brief cancer journey, he reminded us all that “GOD’S GOT THIS.” And for now and into eternity…God’s got him.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation to your local church or community charity in honor of Kyle’s legacy.\n\nA visitation will be held 5-7 PM, on Friday, April 16, 2021, at the Church of St. Joseph, 108 3rd St NE, Mandan, ND. A Prayer Service will be held at 7:00 PM, on Friday, April 16th following the visitation at the church. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 9:30 AM, on Saturday, April 17, 2021, at the Church of St. Joseph with Father Dennis Schafer as celebrant. Burial will follow in St. Mary's Cemetery in Bismarck.\n\nFor those of you who are unable to attend, live streaming will be available at the Church of St. Joseph's YouTube page."
