        "text": "\"I have been learning to write for something like 45 years,\" said the author who had brought us The Year Of Living Dangerously, later made into a film in 1982 starring Mel Gibson.\n\n\"I say 'learning to write' because writers never cease to learn their craft.\n\n\"And with each small extra discovery, even at my advanced age, the excitement of one's first fatal step is rekindled. Should the excitement ever die it will be time to quit writing.\"\n\nFortunately for his legion of loyal fans that excitement never did die and Koch continued to produce new material as recently as last year with the launch of his eighth novel Lost Voices.\n\nBorn in Hobart, Tasmania, to Burton and Phyllis Koch, Christopher grew up wanting to become a comic strip artist and for a time worked as a caricaturist on the local newspaper. By his late teens Koch realised the novel was \"the supreme comic strip\" so opted to study English together with philosophy and ancient history at the University of Tasmania.\n\nIn 1951 he had his first poem published and seven years later, after touring Europe and India and working in London as a waiter and teacher, his first novel The Boys In The Island was released to critical acclaim.\n\nLiving in Sydney, Koch worked as a radio producer but his heart belonged to writing and at the age of 40 he decided to take it up full-time. He produced a catalogue of novels and received Australia's highest literary honour the Miles Franklin Award.\n\nHe died after a year-long battle with cancer and is survived by his second wife Robin and son Gareth from his first marriage to Irene Vilnonis."
