        "text": "Christopher Koch was an awarded and beloved Australian fiction writer.\n\nBorn and educated in Tasmania, Christopher Koch wanted to be a writer from a very young age. He had a poem published first and was briefly a press artist for The Mercury newspaper in Hobart. But an English teacher encouraged his poetry and working in a bookstore instilled in him a deep appreciation of the classics. By 26 he had published his first work of fiction, The Boys in the Island.\n\nHe may be best known for his 1978 novel The Year of Living Dangerously, set in Indonesia during the breakdown of President Sukarno's rule. In 1982 it was adapted into a very successful film - directed by Peter Weir with a cast that included Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver. Koch co-wrote the screenplay, which was nominated for an Academy award.\n\nDuring his life he worked as a teacher, a cadet journalist for a while and then later in radio for the ABC. However from 1972 he was writing full time and produced 10 works over his decades long career; mostly fiction, with one collection of essays and one work of non-fiction. He was awarded the prestigious Miles Franklin Award twice and his work received international praise, especially from other authors.\n\nHe received his AO in 1995 for his contribution to Australian Literature. Christopher Koch died in 2013. He was referred to as the voice of generations by Australian literary critics. This interview with Margaret Throsby was first broadcast in 1994.\n\nOn Beethoven:\n\n\"Iâ€™ve been devoted to him all my life.\"\n\nOn traditional Irish music:\n\n\"This music is the classical music of the Celts.\"\n\nOn Tasmania:\n\n\"Something about the configuration of the hills makes you feel that there is something behind the landscape.\"\n\nChristopher Koch's music choices\n\nDowland: The Earl of Essex Galliard\n\nGareth Koch (guitar)\n\nGluck: \"Che faro senza Eurydice\" from Orfeo and Euridice\n\nChorus and Orchestra of the former Netherlands Opera / Charles Bruck. Kathleen Ferrier (soprano)\n\nBeethoven: Piano Sonata No.23 in F minor, Op. 57 \"Appassionato\": II. Andante con moto\n\nSviatoslav Richter (piano)\n\nTrad: Limericks Lamentation\n\nThe Chieftans"
