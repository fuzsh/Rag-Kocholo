        "text": "Brad Koch became the Marian Ware Director of Athletics, Physical Education, and Recreation in July 2021, making him the department's fourth full-time director of athletics since the men's and women's departments merged in 1979.\n\nSince Koch’s arrival at Swarthmore, varsity programs have combined for 12 Centennial Conference Championships, 13 NCAA Tournament appearances and one individual NCAA National Championship. Swarthmore student-athletes have also combined for 62 All-America selections during his tenure.\n\nIn his first year with the Garnet, Koch made an immediate impact on the department with several key accomplishments. Koch added extra support staff in areas of Strength and Conditioning and Equipment Operations, which were areas of critical need. He also added Amber Buller, PhD, licensed psychologist, to the staff to work with student-athletes, coaches, and staff with a primary emphasis on mental health and how to manage depression and anxiety.\n\nIn addition to adding support staff, Koch made several new additions to the coaching staff in his first year. Koch hired Tana Thomas as head men's golf coach with plans to build a women's golf program, while also elevating the position to full-time. He also removed the interim tag from head women's basketball coach Dawn Grant, while adding the department's first full-time assistant coaches to women's basketball, women's soccer, and men's lacrosse. Koch has championed a five-year, phased approach to add one full-time assistant coach to each intercollegiate program.\n\nIn his second year, Koch continued his commitment to expand the department’s staffing with several new additions. Koch added a fifth full-time certified athletic trainer to better accommodate the needs of Garnet student-athletes. He also added a second full-time equipment manager and promoted Mike Stratton to Athletics Operations and Facilities Coordinator. He then added full-time assistant coaches for volleyball, men’s basketball and women’s lacrosse.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Koch developed a partnership with Move Well Physical Therapy to provide physical therapy services to student-athletes on campus, beginning in Fall 2023. In addition, he spearheaded a nutrition station for student-athletes to promote a wraparound approach for student-athlete care and well-being. Koch championed the creation of a comprehensive Department of Athletics, Physical Education, and Recreation Operations Handbook - outlining policies, procedures, and guidelines of all operations and support services provided in the department.\n\nIn 2023-24, Koch secured the NCAA Strategic Alliance Matching Grant (SAMG) to add an Assistant Director of Athletics for Compliance and Diversity & Inclusion position, beginning with the 2024-25 academic year. It is the first position of its kind in the Department of Athletics.\n\nKoch promoted Chris Irvin to Assistant Director of Athletics with an added focus on shepherding community service initiatives throughout the department. As of June 2024, the men's basketball, baseball, women's basketball, men's lacrosse, softball, field hockey, women's soccer, and men's tennis programs are partnered with Team Impact, an organization that gives kids facing life-threatening or chronic illnesses a dose of joy through the power of being matched with a team. Koch aims to increase the Garnet's partnership with the goal of having 100% participation across Swarthmore's 21 athletic programs.\n\nIn addition, Koch continued his long-term plan of expanding coaching staffs by adding full-time assistant coaches in field hockey, cross country/track & field, and swimming. The assistant swimming coach also serves as an Assistant Aquatics Director and aids in the overall management of Ware Pool, while providing support and oversight to the completion of swim tests for the student body. Koch also added LED lighting to Clothier Field Stadium in July of 2024, aiding institutional goals behind sustainability.\n\nKoch has worked closely with the Office of Institutional Advancement, along with parents, alumni, and friends of the College to raise close to $950,000 in gift income in his first three years. Looking ahead, he is in the planning stages of implementing improvements to Clothier Softball Field, including ADA-compliant grandstand seating, a permanent press box, and backstop/fence branding.\n\nSince joining the department, Koch spearheaded efforts to hire SFBN (Sports Fan Base Network), a professional broadcasting service to provide play-by-play commentary for all live-streamed athletic contests, augmenting Swarthmore's viewership, communications reach, and service to fans across the globe. During the summer of 2022, Koch worked closely with the Facilities team and vendors to plan and complete various capital projects including: full Clothier Field turf and track replacement and brand refresh, Tarble Gym floor replacement and brand refresh, Mullan Center tennis court replacement and color scheme change, Tarble Athletics suite and lobby alterations, and HVAC installation in locker rooms.\n\nKoch is currently serving on a number of committees, including the Steering Committee for the College’s rebranding efforts, the Advisory Committee for the Cunningham Fields Renovation and Field House Replacement Projects, and the Athletics and Well-Being Fundraising Committee. He is the Chair of the Athletics Leadership Council and Co-Chair of the Athletics Advisory Committee. Additionally, he is a member of the President’s Senior Staff. Koch also serves as the Centennial Conference AD liaison for the sport of men’s golf and is a member of the Conference Board of Delegates."
