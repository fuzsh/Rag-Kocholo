        "text": "(1932–2013). The novels of Australian writer C.J. Koch often explore the relationship of illusion with reality. Two of his books, The Doubleman and Highways to a War, won the Miles Franklin Award, Australia’s highest literary honor.\n\nChristopher John Koch was born in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, on July 16, 1932. He was educated at the University of Tasmania and worked for the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a radio producer before devoting himself to writing in 1972. The influence of his travel and work experiences—which include a UNESCO assignment to organize radio production facilities in Indonesia—appears throughout his work."
