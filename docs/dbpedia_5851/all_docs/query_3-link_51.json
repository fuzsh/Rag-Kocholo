        "text": "Choose a Staff Member:\n\nJoe Koch\n\nTitle\n\nAssistant Coach\n\nJoe Koch announced his retirement as head coach at East Stroudsburg University in September of 2020. He was on the staff at ESU for 37 seasons, including 35 as a head coach prior to his retirement. He now serves as a volunteer assistant with ESU's cross country and track & field programs.\n\nKoch spent 34 seasons as the head women's cross country coach, 32 as head men's cross country coach, and 32 as the head men's track and field coach. He was also the head women's track and field coach for 17 years before turning the reigns over to longtime assistant coach Chris Merli prior to the 2006-07 season.\n\nKoch's athletes enjoyed a tremendous amount of success over the past three decades. The track and field program has produced 70 All-America Awards (36 men, 34 women) from 1990-2020. A total of 22 athletes earned multiple All-America honors during the stretch, including high jumpers Lynn Mayer, a 2011 graduate who was a six-time All-American, and four-time All-America high jumper Karen (Way) Gaita, the 1991 NCAA Division II outdoor champion.\n\nAt the conference level, the Warriors won 141 individual PSAC championships (85 men, 56 women) and 21 relay titles (14 men, 7 women) from 1990-2020.\n\nThe men's program was PSAC runner-up at the conference championships eight times in Koch's final 11 years (2009 outdoors, 2010 indoors/outdoors, 2011 outdoors, 2013 indoors and 2014 indoors/outdoors, 2019 indoors).\n\nKoch was named the PSAC and USTFCCCA Atlantic Region Coach of the Year following the 2009 outdoor season. He was also chosen as the NCAA Women's Regional Coach of the Year and ECAC Co-Women's Coach of the Year in 2001, and was the ECAC Men's Coach of the Year in 1990 when his squad won the ECAC indoor championships.\n\nIn cross country, Koch received the ECAC Women's Coach of the Year in 1995 and PSAC Coach of the Year in 1994. He sent 21 individual runners and three teams, the 1989 and 2012 men and 1999 women, to the NCAA Division II Championships. Jan Blake (1996), Tina Vosper (1998), Vanessa Andes (2003-04), Rose Mascoli (2010) and Frank Fezza (2012) have been All-Americans.\n\nThe Hackensack, N.J. native ran track and field and cross country for four years at the University of Delaware and was captain of the Blue Hens' cross country team as a senior in 1979. Koch lives in East Stroudsburg with his wife Deborah, son Matthew Edward and daughter Kristen Joann.\n\nESU Track & Field All-Americans since 1990\n\nMen's\n\n2019 indoor - Justin Miller (TJ)\n\n2019 indoor - Dominic Walton (Shot put)\n\n2017 outdoor - Steve Morgan (110H)\n\n2017 indoor - Steve Morgan (60H)\n\n2016 outdoor - Travis Toth (Hammer)\n\n2016 indoor - William Berry (HJ), Travis Toth (Weight)\n\n2015 outdoor - William Berry (HJ)\n\n2014 outdoor - Travis Toth (Hammer)\n\n2014 indoor - Seth Bailey (HJ)\n\n2013 outdoor - Matt Tholis (Javelin), Josh Hontz (Javelin)\n\n2012 outdoor - Matt Tholis (Javelin), Dan Johnson (Decathlon)\n\n2011 outdoor - Josh Hontz (Javelin)\n\n2011 indoor - Negus Graham (400)\n\n2010 outdoor - Negus Graham (400), Paul Wagner (Hammer), 4x100m Relay\n\n2010 indoor - Negus Graham (400)\n\n2009 outdoor - Paul Wagner (Hammer)\n\n2009 indoor - Rusty Smith (60H)\n\n2008 outdoor - Iuri Pinto (1500)\n\n2008 indoor - Rusty Smith (60H)\n\n2004 outdoor - Dan Gale (Javelin)\n\n2003 outdoor - Barry Krammes (Javelin)\n\n2003 indoor - Mike Newhard (HJ)\n\n2002 outdoor - Barry Krammes (Javelin)\n\n2002 indoor - Mike Newhard (HJ)\n\n1998 indoor - Rob Stone (LJ)\n\n1996 indoor - Rob Stone (LJ)\n\n1994 indoor - Rob Stone (LJ)\n\n1992 outdoor - Lance Branyan (Javelin), Al Yackenchick (Javelin)\n\n1991 indoor - Martin Brans (1500)\n\n1990 indoor - Martin Brans (1500)\n\nWomen's\n\n2018 outdoor - Aspen Gaita (Hept)\n\n2018 indoor - Aspen Gaita (Pent)\n\n2017 indoor - Aspen Gaita (Pent)\n\n2015 outdoor - Christina O'Connor (HJ)\n\n2015 indoor - Christina O'Connor (HJ)\n\n2014 outdoor - Christina O'Connor (HJ)\n\n2013 indoor - Christina O'Connor (HJ)\n\n2011 outdoor - Rose Mascoli (5,000; 10,000), Lynn Mayer (HJ)\n\n2011 indoor - Lynn Mayer (HJ)\n\n2010 outdoor - Lynn Mayer (HJ)\n\n2010 indoor - Lynn Mayer (HJ)\n\n2008 outdoor - Lynn Mayer (HJ)\n\n2008 indoor - Lynn Mayer (HJ)\n\n2007 outdoor - Leslie Martin (Hept)\n\n2007 indoor - Leslie Martin (HJ)\n\n2005 outdoor - Vanessa Andes (10,000)\n\n2001 outdoor - Jenn Grube (Javelin), Quanette Jester (TJ)\n\n2001 indoor - Shavanna Ross (HJ)\n\n2000 outdoor - Jenn Grube (Javelin)\n\n1999 outdoor - Tina Vosper (10,000), Jenelle Strine (Hammer)\n\n1999 indoor - Tina Vosper (5,000)\n\n1997 indoor - Jane Blake (mile)\n\n1996 outdoor - Jan Blake (1500)\n\n1995 outdoor - Jan Blake (1500)\n\n1993 outdoor - Jenn Moyer (10,000)\n\n1991 outdoor - Karen Way (HJ)\n\n1991 indoor - Karen Way (HJ)\n\n1990 outdoor - Karen Way (HJ)\n\n1990 indoor - Jenn Moyer (3,000)\n\nCross Country All-Americans\n\n2012 - Frank Fezza\n\n2010 - Rose Mascoli\n\n2004 - Vanessa Andes\n\n2003 - Vanessa Andes\n\n1998 - Tina Vosper\n\n1996 - Jan Blake"
