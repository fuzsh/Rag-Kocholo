        "text": "Christopher Koch was born with itchy feet. Like the characters in his novels, the Tasmanian author spent most of his life wrestling with a longing for his birthplace and a desire to escape it.\n\nHe was born and raised in Hobart, but lived mostly on the Australian mainland, owning homes at different times in Mosman, Turramurra, Bilgola and Wahroonga in Sydney and in Leura in the Blue Mountains. Occasionally he returned to his roots, including Launceston and, most recently, Richmond, not far from Hobart.\n\nHe once said, while living in Sydney, \"Tasmania's a very provincial place, it's very isolated, and you feel that. Now I live in a sort of exile.\"\n\nYet from the moment Koch decided to be a writer, the landscape and people of Tasmania were the core ingredients that propelled his work. All his eight novels, including those set in other places with \"nomadic protagonists who yearn for other lands\" – such as the two that won Miles Franklin Literary Awards, The Doubleman and Highway to a War – draw on his Tasmanian background.\n\nCatholic-educated, Koch believed in the existence of evil and was a traditional storyteller whose books dealt with themes of spirituality, illusion and reality, and cultural identity. He was often described as \"an old fashioned writer\" and had little patience for postmodernism, lamenting what he saw as \"a shift in modern fiction away from the bedrocks of story and character to the shifty ground of authorial intrusion\".\n\nFor this reason he revered the work of Conrad, Dostoyevsky and Eliot along with modern authors such as as Cormac McCarthy and Richard Ford.\n\nHe was also of a generation that was defined by Australia's post-war engagement with Asia. He is best known for his 1978 novel The Year of Living Dangerously, which is about an Australian correspondent, Guy Hamilton, caught up in the 1965 abortive coup against the Indonesian dictator Sukarno. The story was loosely inspired by his younger brother Philip Koch's experience as a journalist in Indonesia.\n\nDuring the making of the popular movie version, starring Mel Gibson, Koch fell out with the director Peter Weir, which led to David Williamson being drafted to rewrite the author's script.\n\nThe novel was huge success by Australian publishing standards, selling 80,000 copies before it was adapted as a film, and more than 200,000 since. It cemented Koch's reputation as a writer, winning the National Book Council Award for Australian Literature, and helped open Australians' eyes to the politics and culture of their northern neighbour.\n\nChristopher John Koch was born to an Anglican father and Catholic mother on July 16, 1932. His paternal ancestors were part of the German Lutheran diaspora that arrived in South Australia in the 1840s, when his maternal ancestors, Anglo-Irish immigrants, were arriving in Tasmania. Of Koch's two Irish great-great grandmothers, one, Margaret O'Meara, was convicted of larceny and shipped to Van Diemen's Land, and the other, Jane Devereux, married Captain James Hurburgh, whose job was to capture runaway convicts. His great-great grandfather, John (Johann) Koch, was a renowned architect.\n\nKoch grew up with his brother, Phillip, in the Hobart suburb of New Town and later in Lenah Valley, where his sister, Susan, was born. He was schooled at Clemes College, St Virgil's College and Hobart High School. After enduring \"phallic jokes\" at school about his name (which means cook in German) he changed its pronunication to \"kosh\".\n\nAs a boy he wanted to be a comic strip artist and at age 17 worked as a caricauritist on the Hobart Mercury newspaper. But by his late teens Koch realised the novel was \"the supreme comic strip\". He studied English, philosophy and ancient history at the University of Tasmania and in 1951 one of his poems was published in The Bulletin magazine.\n\nAfter graduating he moved, age 21, to the mainland, then toured Europe and stopped over in India. He worked for two years in London, mostly as a waiter and a teacher, while completing a novel The Boys in the Island, which he had started at university. A call-up up for national service (because he was a British subject) convinced him to return home, but Koch left his manuscript with an agent who sold it to a British publisher. This coming-of-age story about a Tasmanian boy was published in 1958 and launched Koch's literary career after receiving good reviews.\n\nKoch had moved to Sydney in 1956, renting a room in a big old house in Elizabeth Bay Road. In 1957 he started a cadetship with the ABC and in 1959 married Irene Vilnonis, a pianist from Lithuania. He was awarded a grant from the Standford Writing Fellowships to attend a course at Standford University in California, where he met Ken Kesey, who introduced him to marijuana. \"I didn't mind trying it,\" Koch said, \"but I didn't go for disoriented prose much.\" Later he travelled to Milan, where his son, Gareth, now a celebrated classical guitarist, was born in 1962.\n\nKoch worked as a radio producer at the ABC in Sydney for 12 years, responsible for broadcasts for schools. The ABC transferred him to Indonesia in 1968 on a UNESCO assignment to organise radio facilities. That year his second novel Across the Sea Wall, in which the protaganist undertakes a journey through mystic India, was published.\n\nIn 1972, age 40, while living with his wife and son in South Yarra, Koch realised he needed to leave the ABC if he wanted to write. So he moved to Launceston, where he subsisted on teaching adult education courses. But his marriage suffered and he divorced in 1979.\n\nTwo years later he visited China, which was depicted in Chinese Journey, his poetic 1985 travelogue co-written with Nicholas Hasluck. His fourth novel - The Doubleman, which Leonie Kramer called \"an imaginitive analysis of the sixties\", came out the same year and won the first of his two Miles Franklin Literary Awards.\n\nHowever, the book some regard as Koch's best is his 1995 novel, Highway to a War. It is set during the Indochina conflicts and is about photojournalist Mike Langford, who disappears in Khmer-Rouge Cambodia in 1976. The Langford character is said to be modelled on Koch's old schoolmate from Hobart High, the late Neil Davis, as well as other war photographers such as Sean Flynn and Tim Page. The novel won Koch's second Miles Franklin.\n\nFour years later he produced a companion book, Beware of the Past, Out of Ireland, in which Langford's great-great grandfather, Robert Devereux, a young idealist, endures the harsh reality of Van Diemen's Land through his love for an Irish convict, Kathleen O'Rahilly.\n\nSoon after, in 2002, Koch wrote a non-fiction book about his Irish heritage called The Many Coloured Land. That was followed by The Memory Room, an espionage novel about two former students from Tasmania. Koch's eighth and final novel, published in 2012, was Lost Voices. Described as \"an astonishingly beautiful evocation of Tasmania's rich and intricate past\", it is partly about a fictitious bushranger who tries to establish a utopia near Hobart.\n\nKoch was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1995 and remarried in the late 1990s to Robin Allanah Whyte-Butler. By 2004 he had enough of \"overcrowded\" Sydney and he and Robin moved from Wahroonga to a half-hectare property in Richmond, outside Hobart.\n\nRichmond is rich with links to the author's family history. Richmond's Town Hall was designed by Koch's architect grandfather, Rudolph, and two of his great-great-grandparents were married in a church in Sorell, a nearby township. The house is located just out of the town. Robin established a large garden, which allowed Koch to indulge his passion for trees – he planted about 60.\n\nFrom the desk in his study Koch could see the Coal River winding through a flood plain below, a serene image that must have comforted a writer whose work reflected a lifelong sense of place."
