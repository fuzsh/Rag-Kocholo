        "text": "PLYMOUTH — Plymouth FFA hosted a world-famous speaker last month as part of its Self Improvement Day.\n\nOn Friday, Dec. 8, students participated in many different breakout rooms where they learned about ways to cope with issues they may be facing, how to meditate and relax, and many other practices to better themselves and their habits.\n\nAfter all the rotations, students headed to the gym to be introduced to Canadian farmer, Chris Koch.\n\nBut Chris isn’t your typical farmer, He was born without arms and legs. However, this didn’t stop him from following his dreams. Growing up he played baseball and hockey with other kids and helped on his grandpa’s farm whenever he could.\n\nAfter graduating high school, he moved to Calgary to pursue his secondary education. Today, when Chris isn’t farming he’s traveling the world sharing his story. He carries the message “If I Can.”\n\nHe chooses to not let his disadvantages get in the way of sharing his story and changing lives all over the globe.\n\n“Happiness, positivity and love are all contagious,” Koch said. “Hatred, negativity and fear are also contagious. Which of these do you want to spread?\n\n“Whatever situation you find yourself in, you’ll always get out and make the most of life.”\n\nNo matter what happens in life, figure out what YOU can do to fix the situation and make things better. Place the responsibility on your shoulders.\n\nIt might seem easier to place the blame on others or on extraneous factors and make it seem like life happens to you. That just prolongs the situation and you’ll only feel like you’re stuck, spinning your wheels.\n\nHe also challenged students, sharing the quote: “Fear kills more dreams than failure ever will.”\n\n“You can play it safe or you can play the game,” Koch said.\n\nChris is a huge advocate of pushing yourself out of your comfort zone and doing the things that scare you and challenge you.\n\n“When you voluntarily take yourself out of your comfort zone, you’re getting yourself comfortable with being uncomfortable,” and that’s a good thing.\n\nChris also presented to South Central High School.\n\nBetween his presentations at South Central High School and Plymouth-Shiloh High School, he got to jump in the combine and harvest some field corn with Jason Putt, of Putt Farms in Greenwich.\n\nOhio becomes the fifth state Chris has been lucky enough to farm in, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and California being the others.\n\nChris even took the time to have lunch with teachers, presenters, and FFA members followed by supper with the Plymouth-Shiloh FFA alumni members.\n\nPlymouth FFA and students and staff of Plymouth High School and Shiloh Middle School would like to thank the Plymouth-Shiloh FFA Alumni for financially sponsoring our guest speaker so our students could hear his inspiring message.\n\nThank you to everyone who supports their fundraisers as well, making this guest speaker possible, you are so appreciated."
