        "text": "In salute to the anniversary of the late Christopher Koch OA (b. 16th July 1932-23 September 2013), I re-read his breakout novel, The Year of Living Dangerously, published to great acclaim in 1978.\n\nWikipedia tells us somewhat peevishly that it was not even on the short list for the Miles Franklin Award, but of course it wasn’t. It wasn’t eligible under the terms of Miles Franklin’s bequest that the award is for ‘a novel which is of the highest literary merit and presents Australian life in any of its phases’. Koch’s novel is set uncompromisingly in Indonesia, during the soon-to-be-deposed President Sukarno’s 1965 ‘Year of Living Dangerously’. That was why Australians loved it: Indonesia was in the news in 1975 for all the wrong reasons, and Koch’s novel captured the sense of crisis and betrayal on our doorstep. The Year of Living Dangerously won the 1978 Age Book of the Year Award and the 1979 National Book Council Award, and it made Koch’s name.\n\nAustralian journalists in the novel who felt threatened on the streets of Jakarta in 1965 had good cause to feel betrayed. Only twenty years beforehand, Australia had been Indonesia’s most stalwart and highly effective supporter of its declaration of independence in 1945 which was rejected by Dutch colonists. Four years of intransigent negotiations and bloody conflict ensued. But through diplomatic channels in the UN and elsewhere, Australia led one of the first successes of the United Nations and of regional diplomacy: an end to the fighting in the Indonesian archipelago and the bringing into being of a new and great member of the world community. But although Koch’s novel is derived from historical events, Australia’s support is remembered only by its narrator who is older than the other journalists.\n\nTo maintain his grip on power, Sukarno was whipping up postcolonial vilification which made it necessary for western journalists to seek refuge in the Wayang — a foreigner’s bar in a foreigner’s hotel. Because outside, Konfrontasi had shifted from military confrontation with Malaysia to Konfrontasi within the nation so it was wise for white faces never to go out alone, to go out at night, or to go into certain pockets of the city. As Cookie, the journalist-narrator who tells the story some years after events, recalls:\n\nSukarno had popularised the term, hypnotising his crowds at the great rallies we covered almost every week at the Jakarta Sports Stadium he had built with Russian money.\n\nHe had made for himself and his people a sort of theatre there; a theatre of romantic-revolutionary euphoria in which they were spellbound. And he had created a strange propaganda world of paper and capital letters: a world divided between the NEFOS—New Emerging Forces—and the OLDEFOS—Old Fashioned Forces—where we whites were called NEKOLIM: ‘neo-colonial imperialists’. Bung Karno showed a genius for such coinings, as a substitute for economic management. Talismans, intended to change reality, they have all gone under glass now, with the other debased coinage of history: but in that year, Konfrontasi was a term to juggle with. Malaysia was confronted. Its protector Britain was confronted. The United States was confronted. The whole western world and India as well were confronted, while the Bung warmed his ego at the blaze, striking dictatorial attitudes from Europe’s nineteen thirties, his black pitji tilted in defiance: a baffling mixture of menace and playboy appeal. The people sometimes called him bapak—father—but really, he was the Bung. the daring elder brother who carried out every outrageous scheme they had ever longed for, and shouted every imagined insult at the world’s Establishment—and at shady colonial masters who might try to come back. (p.8-9)\n\nCookie is an old hand, and one in whom some of his compatriots confide, especially as the alcohol flows in the Wayang bar. From this vantage-point, he weaves his story, supplementing these confidences with dossiers that had been covertly kept by Billy Kwan, a Chinese-Australian photojournalist with mysterious access to members of the government and diplomatic services. That is how Cookie knows about the sex-lives of this mostly male company of journalists, and it’s how he discovers the souring of Kwan’s admiration for Sukarno.\n\nSukarno’s schemes include flirting among the rival communists from the USSR and China. Russian money had paid for grandiose building projects but a bedroom confidence reveals a rumour that the Chinese are sending weapons to arm the peasants for a revolution. But the Muslim majority are not keen on the atheism demanded by the PKI (Partai Komunis Indonesia i.e. the Indonesian Communist Party), and as Sukarno’s ambitious adversaries in the government and the military know, aligning with communism is risky during the Cold War.\n\nBesides, the rhetoric of revolution belongs in another place and time. When the economy collapses and there is no rice to feed the people, Sukarno tells them to ‘plunder the capitalist bureaucrats’ but Kwan — who had hero-worshipped Sukarno — recognises what that means is that the poor plunder one another.\n\n‘Who’s a “capitalist bureaucrat”? The owner of a kerbside stall; or the smallest peasant. Plunder the small farmer! It’s the green light for the PKI, and a class struggle invented for the cities of nineteenth century Europe.’ (P.216)\n\nKwan is the moral core of the story. In company and in the privacy of his room, he expresses his profound dismay about the poverty that betrays the promise of independence. He understands Sukarno’s populist appeal, but he recognises his hero’s failure. Sukarno’s military background was no preparation for transition to an independent economy. While his ego expressed itself in Stalinist monuments and buildings to assert the importance of Jakarta as a world capital city, his people were starving. The trigger for Kwan’s disillusionment to morph into action, was the death of a little boy from a poor family that he had been supporting.\n\nThe symbolism of the wayang demonstrates Koch’s familiarity with his locale. The dustjacket author profile tells us that Koch…\n\n…had spent over ten years as a producer with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, working mainly in Sydney. He has also lived for extended periods in Europe and has travelled in Asia, visiting Indonesia on a number of occasions. He carried out a mission there for UNESCO in 1968, preparing a report that led towards the setting up of educational broadcasting in that country. He has since had a continuing interest in Javanese culture.\n\nThe Wayang puppet performances that have entertained generations of Indonesians, satirise current events even as they borrow from Indigenous myths, and retell stories from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. Guy Hamilton, the journalist who relies on Kwan for his contacts, sees a performance…\n\nThe figures of India’s great Pandava story, transformed into weird cartoons, formally addressed each other, laughed and wept, prepared for battle in their chariots. Ogres who were coarse as Westerners ranted and broke wind, while the audience laughed derisively. Hamilton was introduced to the Wayang of the Right and the Wayang of the Left, who are in constant conflict.\n\nAs history tells us, that conflict erupted into a messy coup, followed by an anti-communist purge estimated to have taken the lives of 500,000 to one million people. The journalists scramble…\n\nWhile the novel focusses on a team of foreign journalists trying to decipher the enigma of Sukarno as a charismatic leader leading his country into political chaos, the 1982 film directed by Peter Weir, was tagged ‘A love caught in the fire of revolution’). It was more about the love triangle between the Australian journalist Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson) and British Embassy officer Jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver) and Billy Kwan, a Chinese-Australian photo-journalist with dwarfism (played by Linda Hunt). It was shot in the Philippines because both the film and the novel had been banned in Indonesia under Sukarno’s successor Suharto. Indonesians finally got to read the book and see the film after Suharto’s forced resignation in 1988.\n\nI have Koch’s book A Many-coloured Land, an Irish Memoir, but I don’t have a biography about him. He died just over a decade ago, so I hope someone is busy working on one now.\n\nAuthor: Christopher Koch\n\nTitle: The Year of Living Dangerously\n\nPublisher: Thomas Nelson, Australia, 1978\n\nDustjacket design by David Lancashire\n\nISBN: 0170052540, hbk., First Edition, 296 pages\n\nSource: Personal library, purchased second-hand, $70.00\n\nImage credits:"
