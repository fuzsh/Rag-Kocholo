        "text": "Christopher Paul (Chris) Koch\n\n1950 - 2024\n\nChris died peacefully, at his home, Friday, April 5, 2024. He was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania and raised in Decatur, Georgia. Chris' interest in archeology began as a young child when he found his first arrowhead while living in Tennessee. His passion led to a bachelor's degree in Anthropology from Georgia State University. He continued his education at the University of Toronto where he received his master's and PhD also in Anthropology.\n\nChris spent many years in Africa after completing his PhD and continued as a senior lecturer at the University of Nairobi. During this period, Chris was a highly respected professional in his field where he also mentored and encouraged many students to achieve their dreams.\n\nChris' happiest days were working at Koobi Fora Field School in Turkana District, Northern Kenya, where he continued his passion for Archeology and mentoring future archaeologists.\n\nWhile teaching at the University of Nairobi, Chris met his friend, James Gitau, who later moved to the United States and became his life-partner.\n\nChris' achievements were not only limited to his work in Archeology. He was also involved in many other endeavors including the African Studies Association as the Director, at Emory University, the Atlanta Beltline Project, politics, Atlanta history, and preservation and cultural resource management.\n\nMost recently, Chris continued his work as a FEMA consultant in Puerto Rico and St Croix, US Virgin Islands, where he continues to have many friends and colleagues.\n\nChris will be remembered by his friends for his wisdom, wit, and great jokes. He worked tirelessly until his last days. He was dear and lovely to everyone who knew him. He had beautiful smiles and great laughter.\n\nChris is survived by his longtime friend and partner, James Gitau. He is also survived by his brothers Matthew and Nick. Chris is preceded in death by his mother, Vilma, father, Albert, and his sister Resa.\n\nIt is with great pride, honor, and love that we celebrate the life of Chris Koch. Chris, always thinking of others first, touched the lives of everyone he met. He will be greatly missed and never forgotten.\n\nThe family will be holding a private service and burial Saturday April 13 at Decatur Cemetery in Decatur, Georgia.\n\nDonations, in lieu of flowers, may be directed to Grady Hospital at: www.gradyhealthfoundation.org"
