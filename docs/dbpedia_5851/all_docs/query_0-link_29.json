Because the real point about Chris, who died in September, aged 81, after a yearlong battle with cancer, is that he was the most sophisticated, important and profound novelist that Australia has produced.\n\nNo other Australian novelist has had the depth of learning, the artistic sophistication, the profound psychological understanding and the sheer craftsmanship to bring such perfect novels to the page as Chris did."
