        "text": "Abstract The collection of radio producer Christopher Koch contains scripts for the 1964 twelve-part radio documentary This Little Light; typed transcriptions of audio recordings made for the documentary; and audio recordings of African American intellectual W.E.B. DuBois on open reel tapes, which were collected for a commemorative program on DuBois following his death in 1963. Produced for the noncommercial radio station WBAI in New York City, This Little Light focused on Freedom Summer in Mississippi and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and examined student activism, the murders of civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwartz in Philadelphia, Miss., freedom schools, and a high school boycott in Shaw, Miss. The DuBois recordings include addresses by him and his memorial service in Achimota, Ghana. Acquired as part of the Southern Historical Collection."
