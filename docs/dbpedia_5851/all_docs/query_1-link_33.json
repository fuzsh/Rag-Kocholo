After high school Mr. Koch enlisted in the Navy and traveled the world. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from SUNY Brockport and majored in alcohol and substance abuse counseling.\n\nMr. Koch fought a long battle with Multiple Sclerosis, but those who knew him well know it was the Buffalo Sabresâ€™ awe-inspiring debacle of the season that really broke his heart. He had a true love for the game.\n\nMr. Koch is survived by siblings Fritz, Peter, Eugene (Julie), Lil, Rodney A. (Pam) Morgan and Paula Morgan; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nMr. Koch was a very special uncle to Emily Koch McArdle.

Fred and Joanne; stepmother Suzanne N. Koch; and sisters Suzanne Koch Gosman and Amy M. (Ron) Lasker.\n\nThe memorial service will be held on Saturday, May 3 at 10 a.m. at Kenneth Howe Funeral Home, 64 Maple Road.\n\nDonations may be made to the National MS Society, P.O.
