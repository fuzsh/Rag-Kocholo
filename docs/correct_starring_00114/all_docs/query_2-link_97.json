        "text": "You're appearing alongside Maureen Lipman in the play Daytona, which has just transferred to the West End. How did you come to be involved?\n\nI've been coming to London for years, I've always loved hanging here. A couple of years ago, through my wife [Welsh singer-songwriter Judith Owen], I met Maureen Lipman and we became friends. Then I got sent the Daytona script with a note saying that Maureen had suggested me to play her husband. I read the script and it was brilliant, so I thought \"thank you Maureen\" and \"yes please\".\n\nWhat's it like working with Maureen Lipman CBE?\n\nI hate all that theatrical luvvie stuff, so I'm sorry in advance, but she's a joy. We laugh a lot, she's smart and knows her stuff. I'm working with really fine, properly trained British actors and I'm some American guy with no training, but there's been no sense of hauteur or any attitude at all.\n\nHow do you feel about making your West End debut?\n\nIt's both exciting and scary. But I've been on some frightening stages before: the Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall… Daunting places that get the butterflies going. So I'll survive this, one way or another.\n\nDaytona's writer Oliver Cotton stars alongside you and Lipman. Is that tricky because you can't slag off the script?\n\nOh no, the words \"Who wrote this shit?\" are spoken with even greater frequency than usual. Sometimes by him.\n\nBallroom dancing features highly in the play. How's that been?\n\nHorrible. I told them I don't dance when they interviewed me and now I prove it nightly.\n\nIs Maureen a better mover than you?\n\nI'm not going to make invidious comparisons or qualitative assessments of a national treasure. There are occasional trodden-on toes or bumped knees but no finger-pointing.\n\nSo you won't be doing Strictly Come Dancing anytime soon?\n\nNo. NO! Can I say that in capital letters with 15 exclamation points after it? Absolutely not. I'm not a fan of those competition shows or \"hey, look what happened to this washed-up celebrity\" shows.\n\nThey're good to satirise, though. You've made a web series called What's With Honey Poo Poo?, parodying Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.\n\nYeah, my wife and I couldn't help ourselves. We were so appalled when we saw that show and went, \"God, there's no way to make this worse… Oh, hang on, yes there is!\" My hope is that if it can't go viral, it can at least go bacterial.\n\nYou turned 70 recently. How's your eighth decade treating you?\n\nAs long as the plumbing and limbs still work, I'm happy. I'm still fairly athletic in my pursuits. I do stretches every morning and serious yoga. Not the hot sweaty type – I don't believe yoga is calisthenics in fancy pants. I practise a variant of hatha yoga. I also play basketball whenever I can.\n\nYou're combining this play with The Simpsons [Shearer voices the likes of Mr Burns and Ned Flanders, among others] and your weekly radio programme, Le Show. That must be quite a juggling act.\n\nThe radio thing is easier because it's under my complete control. The Simpsons is a more fraught matter and there's time zone constraints, but it gets done.\n\nAre those Simpsons voices second nature now?\n\nAfter 27 years, it's third nature. Doing voices is like singing and remembering songs. My wife's just been touring with a brilliant young Portuguese percussionist who's in Ronnie Scott's house band here. He likes basketball, so we played – I beat the crap out of him, by the way – and the thought occurred to me: \"I've been doing The Simpsons longer than this guy's been on the Earth.\"\n\nDo you see The Simpsons as a job for life?\n\nThe show will continue until the Fox network can find a new hit comedy show for 8pm and, based on their track record so far, I'd give us another 50 years. No lack of respect to the fine Fox network, of course.\n\nDo you still enjoy it?\n\nI never wanted to do a regular sitcom because I'd be incredibly bored doing the same character week in, week out. But the beauty of The Simpsons is that it's 15, 16, 17 characters. It's the variety that keeps it interesting. And hey, they're all my children.\n\nYou voice both Mr Burns and his assistant-cum-unrequited admirer Smithers. Is it a bit like being infatuated with yourself?\n\nSure. There's a self-love thing going on there. And what's wrong with that?\n\nDo you think the quality of The Simpsons has ebbed and flowed over the years?\n\nI think about it but I don't talk about it.\n\nIt's Glastonbury this weekend and Spinal Tap played there five years ago. How was it?\n\nGreat but a bit of a blur. Looking out at that vast sea of people, you can see about 2,000 of them and the rest look like a backdrop they've wheeled in from a studio lot. The response you get from 130,000 people is like a mammoth energy ball coming at you and you just try to ride it. It's exhilarating, intoxicating and it goes by in a split second. The most memorable thing was driving back to London afterwards. It was 6.30pm, someone saw this little thing to the left of the motorway and went: \"Look, there's Stonehenge.\" I went: \"Come on, that's a replica where a petrol station should be.\" But of course, it's the real one. So at 6.45pm, we drove in and they said no, we're closing at 7. Christopher [Guest] and I are fairly shy but our keyboard player, God bless him, is a fairly forward lad so he just walked up and said: \"You've gotta let these guys in, they put this place on the map.\" The gates duly opened. So that goes down as my favourite ever solstice.\n\nAny plans for a Tap reunion? There were rumours of 30th anniversary gigs…\n\nThere was very loose talk. But loose talk sinks walks.\n\nWhat's Derek Smalls [Spinal Tap bassist, played by Shearer] up to at the moment?\n\nWell, the horticultural bug has bit him, so he's trying to breed a black carnation. He'd also gone to therapy for internet addiction but he's come out the other side. Well, he sent me emails to that effect. Thousands of them.\n\nAny more collaborations with Christopher Guest planned?\n\nI'm always open to that. I had breakfast with him recently and I didn't glean anything. When he's not actively engaged in a project, Chris seems pretty happy just hanging out with his family and eating nice food. He's not tremendously driven to make the next thing happen the day after tomorrow.\n\nWhereas you are more like that?\n\nI certainly am. I think the difference may be that my dad died fairly early in my life and I gleaned a sense of the limits of this thing. So farting around – or as you Brits say, faffing about – is not really something I do.\n\nAre you a fan of British comedy?\n\nYes. The tradition of sketch comedy is much more alive here than it is in America. I'm a huge fan of Harry and Paul, Armstrong and Miller, French and Saunders… Alan Partridge, of course. I saw Alpha Papa and as an Alan fan, I felt well served. I grew up listening to The Goons and thought Pete and Dud were the luckiest guys in the world. It didn't turn out to be but how amazing were they?\n\nAre you excited by the Monty Python reunion?\n\nAbsolutely. I've always admired them. I'm old friends with Terry Gilliam and was probably the first person to play Python sketches on US radio.\n\nDo you think Vladimir Putin is turning into Mr Burns?\n\nHe's certainly looking a lot more like Mr Burns but all men tend to, with age. That's life's big joke: we all end up looking like Mr Burns."
