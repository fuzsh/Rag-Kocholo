        "text": "DATE April 22, 2003 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/A\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nInterview: Alex Berenson discusses changes in accounting practices\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nThere are 14,000 publicly traded companies in the US. My guest, Alex\n\nBerenson, says that expecting all of them to be honest is unrealistic. But by\n\nthe start of the 21st century, all manner of companies were abusing accounting\n\nrules to mislead their investors seemingly without fear of being caught. In\n\nhis new book, Berenson investigates the accounting methods many companies have\n\nused to help them publish profitable but misleading and inaccurate quarterly\n\nearnings reports.\n\nBerenson is a business reporter for The New York Times and a former reporter\n\nfor The Denver Post and TheStreet.com. His new book is called \"The Number.\"\n\nThe `number' refers to the most important number in a company's quarterly\n\nearnings report, the bottom-line figure of the earnings per share. It's a\n\nnumber investors are obsessed with, and Berenson says it represents the\n\nshort-term mind set that infected Wall Street and corporate America in the\n\nlate '90s. I asked him to explain how the number is calculated.\n\nMr. ALEX BERENSON (Financial Investigative Reporter, The New York Times):\n\nThe base number, the number that the company reports, is its actual earnings,\n\nwhat its sales were, what its costs were. You know, you sort of net those two\n\nthings. You subtract cost from sales and you get profits. And right now\n\nactually we're in the middle of corporate earnings season. Companies like GE\n\nand like Microsoft are reporting their profits right now, saying, `We made,\n\nyou know, X billion dollars in the first quarter, and we have, you know, Y\n\nbillion shares outstanding, so it works out that we made 25 cents a share, or\n\nwe made 63 cents a share.' And then Wall Street looks at that number and\n\ncompares it to what analysts had forecast earnings would be.\n\nSo, for example, if Microsoft made 25 cents a share and the estimate was 22\n\ncents a share, everyone says, `Oh, this is wonderful. This is a great quarter\n\nfor the company. The future is bright. It's a new day dawning. Buy. You\n\nknow, buy, buy, buy.' And the stock goes up. It can go up significantly.\n\nCertainly in the late '90s stocks often went up very significantly if you beat\n\nyour estimates. And then if the estimate was 28 cents and they report 25\n\ncents, all of a sudden the sky is falling and the company's stock can be\n\nabsolutely penalized. And, you know, if this happens too many quarters in a\n\nrow, suddenly the CEO is out, and it's time for a, you know, change.\n\nGROSS: Now you said that although the number is used by investors, and it's\n\nconsidered to be very important, it's a lie. In what sense is it a lie?\n\nMr. BERENSON: Well, it's a lie because it's very hard for a company to\n\nactually calculate its earnings over any three-month period. It's a lie\n\nbecause you have to--people imagine that, `Well, you know, I know how much I\n\nmake and I know broadly how much I spend, so I know whether I'm saving money\n\nor whether I'm, you know, going deeper into debt. And so it should be pretty\n\neasy for a big company to do the same thing.'\n\nIn reality the level of detail and complexity that goes into a corporate\n\nearnings report, a quarterly corporate earnings report, is almost unfathomable\n\nto the average person. You have to estimate hundreds and hundreds of\n\ndifferent variables. You have to determine whether or not you actually made a\n\nsale, whether you actually got paid, whether, you know, the truck that you own\n\nwent down in value by $500 or $700. And, you know, you multiply that by\n\n20,000 trucks, and all of the sudden you're talking about some real money.\n\nAnd so to believe that a company knows to the penny, you know, or even to the\n\nmillion dollars, if it's GE, exactly what it made in a quarter is a lie. And\n\npeople used to, I think, understand that a bit more because it used to be that\n\nanalysts estimated earnings within a range. They would say, `Well, a\n\ncompany's going to make $1.90 to $2.00 this quarter. And so if the company\n\nmade $1.91, it was OK. If the company made $1.99 it was OK. But when you\n\nhave a consensus estimate, you can't have a consensus range estimate. You\n\nhave to have a consensus estimate that's to a point, to a penny. And so it\n\nbecame, well, Wall Street thinks the company's going to make $1.94 this\n\nquarter, and all of the sudden if you made $1.92, it wasn't so good. And if\n\nyou made $1.97, things were great, which is a silly way to think about things.\n\nBut, unfortunately people--you know, investing is complicated and difficult,\n\nand people like sort of simple maxims. And this became the overriding maxim:\n\nDid you make your number? Did you meet estimates? Are things good or bad?\n\nAnd so there was increasing, growing pressure on companies to make sure they\n\ndid make their numbers. And because there's variability in accounting,\n\nbecause it's fairly simple in any one quarter to make a minor adjustment here\n\nor there so you can make sure you made your estimate, then companies did start\n\nto cheat. And the companies that were cheating already cheated more.\n\nGROSS: And when you say cheating, you, in part, mean creative accounting.\n\nMr. BERENSON: I mean, there's all kinds of cheating, but yes. I mean selling\n\nstuff when you don't actually think you're going to get paid but counting it\n\nas a sale and booking a profit from it. I mean marking up your pension fund\n\nmore than you actually can make on it and booking that as a profit. There's\n\ndozens, literally dozens, of major ways that companies can play with the\n\nrules. There's something called GAAP, Generally Accepted Accounting\n\nPrinciples. But within GAAP there's a lot of variability, and there's stuff\n\nthat is in the gray area of GAAP, and there's stuff that's clearly beyond\n\nGAAP. And then there's stuff that's, you know, probably illegal, you know,\n\nnot just a violation of GAAP, but really a violation of the securities laws.\n\nAnd then there's stuff that's definitely illegal. So there's a wide\n\ncontinuum. But I would say that almost every company, by the late '90s, was\n\nat least pushing the boundaries of GAAP.\n\nGROSS: Accounting is, in some ways, an exact science. You know, it's an\n\nempirical approach to figuring out profits and losses. On the other hand,\n\nthere's a lot of subjectivity in actually making those evaluations when you're\n\ntalking about big corporate accounting. And one of the areas where there is a\n\nlot of subjectivity within the analysis is in something called accrual\n\naccounting. Can you explain what accrual accounting is and why so many\n\ncorporations really need to use accrual accounting?\n\nMr. BERENSON: Sure. Just about every big company uses accrual accounting\n\nbecause what it is supposed to do is match your expenses and your sales not\n\nbased on when the cash comes in but based on when a sale is actually made or\n\nwhen you actually have an expense related to a specific product. So what\n\nyou're trying to do is give people a real picture of how the business is\n\nrunning because there are going to be times when you're appearing to be\n\nprofitable when you're actually spending cash and, in fact, when you're going\n\nto be profitable but your cash is flowing out. Let's say you're building a\n\nnew plant because demand is so big for that new car you just introduced.\n\nWell, you have to spend money for that plant. So if you were just counting\n\ncash flow, it would look like you were losing money, but that's not actually\n\nwhat's going on in the reality of the business. The reality of the business\n\nis that things are good and you're making money. And that's what accrual\n\ncounting is supposed to measure.\n\nPeople generally think about their own finances on a cash basis. The cash\n\ncomes in, you know, and fairly rapidly it flows out. It flows out to credit\n\ncard companies, or it flows out to a restaurant. And you get paid on a\n\nmonthly or a weekly or a biweekly basis, so it's pretty easy for you to match\n\nyour cash flows. But for companies it's a lot more complicated, and accrual\n\naccounting is supposed to measure that complexity.\n\nUnfortunately, it is an art as well as a science because sometimes it's not\n\nclear that you've made a sale that you're going to get paid for. Sometimes\n\nyou might be talking to a customer and they say, `Well, we'll take your\n\nproduct, and we think we're going to buy it, but we want to test it out, and,\n\nyou know, we want the ability to return it. Well, that is not really a sale,\n\nyou know, under any accounting, under accrual accounting. You shouldn't book\n\nthat as a sale. But if you're short on your quarter and that one sale might\n\nget you there, you might say, `Well, let's count that as a sale, and we'll\n\njust write our customer a letter saying, \"You know what? You can return that\n\nif you want. We'll give you a letter on the side, but we won't put that in\n\nthe contract, and we'll tell the accountants that's a sale.\"' That's the kind\n\nof thing that shouldn't happen but does happen and accrual accounting allows\n\nto happen.\n\nGROSS: We've been talking a little bit about creative accounting practices\n\nthat sometimes cross the line and mislead investors. Who's supposed to be\n\nmaking sure that that doesn't happen, that the accounting and the quarterly\n\nreports are as accurate as possible?\n\nMr. BERENSON: Well, the two main outside groups that are supposed to keep an\n\neye on things are the accounting industry itself, which is--you know, if\n\nyou're a CPA, that means you're a certified public accountant, and\n\ntheoretically you don't just have responsibility to the company; you have a\n\nresponsibility to the shareholders as well; and then the SEC, the Securities\n\nand Exchange Commission, which was created in the '30s after the first, you\n\nknow, sort of huge bubble and bust in American markets in the 20th century,\n\nyou know, the 1920s boom that led to the '29 crash that a lot of people felt\n\nled to the Depression.\n\nSo you have the SEC and you have the accounting industry, and unfortunately\n\nneither of those groups is quite as strong as we all would have liked to\n\nthink. The accounting industry has a big structural problem, and that is that\n\nit is paid by the company. You know, it's hired by executives. It's paid by\n\nthe company. And yet theoretically it's responsible to shareholders. And so\n\nit's really trying to serve two masters. During the '90s you definitely saw a\n\nchange in accounting culture, whereas, you know, certainly in the '50s and the\n\n'60s and the '70s these really were guys with green eye shades. They didn't\n\nthink of themselves as salesmen. They didn't like to have to go out and pitch\n\nbusiness.\n\nBy the '80s and certainly by the '90s, there was a new breed inside accounting\n\nfirms, and some of these people were not even accountants at all. There were\n\na lot of consultants at the firms. The firms had gotten a lot bigger. They'd\n\ngotten to be more like companies and less like partnerships. And so the\n\ntraditional accountant was sort of overwhelmed. And, you know, when you're a\n\nconsultant, your job is to sell, and the way you sell to your customer, you\n\nknow, if your customer is an executive, is not by telling him, `You can't do\n\nthat. That is not allowed under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.'\n\nThe way you do it is by saying, `Well, let's find a way to make this deal\n\nwork. Let's find a way to make that transaction profitable for you. Let's\n\nfind a way that you can do this and report a profit.' And that happened a lot\n\nin the accounting industry in the 1990s.\n\nAnd I think only now are we seeing how badly the industry was corrupted from\n\nthe inside. And only now, I think, are accountants beginning to say, `We do\n\nhave some professional responsibilities that maybe we didn't pay enough\n\nattention to in the late '90s.' But honestly I'm not seeing as much of it\n\nfrom the industry as I would like. You have not seen the CEOs of the major\n\nfour accounting firms that remain talking about their responsibilities that\n\nmuch. You know, I think the accountants, for 100 years, have really tried to\n\navoid facing this dilemma of being paid by companies while serving investors\n\nhead on, and it's going to take a long time before they face up to it.\n\nGROSS: Now what about the SEC? What is the SEC supposed to be doing to\n\nregulate financial reports and to make sure that they're accurate?\n\nMr. BERENSON: Well, the SEC is the last line of defense. The SEC--you know,\n\nits role is not to supervise every deal made by a public company. Its role is\n\nnot to examine the books of every company every year. But its role is to make\n\nsure that in cases where there is fraud or where there is egregious behavior\n\nthat it steps in. Its role is to be the policemen of the securities markets.\n\nBut, unfortunately, the SEC just did not have the resources to carry that role\n\nout in the late '90s. It had 3,000 employees, which is twice as many\n\nemployees as it had had 60 years before, and the markets are far larger and\n\nmore complex than they were 60 years ago. They're far larger and more complex\n\nthan they were 20 years ago.\n\nIn addition, the SEC paid less than private law firms, than private accounting\n\nfirms. And so, you know, really talented people at the SEC would say, `Well,\n\nI can make, you know, X at the SEC or I can make five-X if I go work for a law\n\nfirm.' And eventually that's a pretty hard decision to make to sacrifice that\n\nso you can work for a government agency, especially if you feel like you're\n\nnot getting the resources that you need to prosecute big cases.\n\nSo by the late '90s the SEC was pretty much overwhelmed. There's a great\n\nquote from a Republican congressman--I believe it was in '98 or '99--and he\n\nsaid, `Well, I think the SEC is doing a great job and doesn't need any more\n\nresources. Look at how many people are investing in the markets.' To me\n\nthat's the same logic as saying, `Well, look at how many people are flying.\n\nClearly we can cut the FAA's budget.' And yet that was the logic of the late\n\n'90s.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Alex Berenson, author of the new book \"The Number.\" More\n\nafter a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Alex Berenson, author of the new book \"The Number: How the\n\nDrive for Quarterly Earnings Corrupted Wall Street and Corporate America.\"\n\nWe talked a little bit about accrual accounting and how that could be used,\n\nyou know, kind of creatively to make it seem like you've made more profits\n\nthan you really have. Can you just like run through quickly some of the other\n\npractices that you think contributed to the kind of faking of the number, of\n\nthe bottom line in the quarterly reports?\n\nMr. BERENSON: Sure. I mean, the two biggest are that companies count a lot\n\nin their pension income as operating income. So that means essentially\n\nbecause the stock market was going up, companies were able to report stronger\n\nprofits, and that obviously helped the stock market to continue to go up, you\n\nknow, which sort of starts to smell like a Ponzi scheme. Another huge factor\n\nis stock options and the fact that stock options are not counted as an\n\nexpense. And people who really know accounting, like Warren Buffett, think\n\nthat this is a joke, that stock options are certainly a compensation expense.\n\nThey're given to employees because they're valuable. And it seems ludicrous\n\nthat you wouldn't have to count that as an expense. And yet companies did not\n\ncount it as an expense.\n\nAnd then there's a variety of smaller tricks companies can do. They can sort\n\nof try to capitalize expenses, which means you spend money now but you say,\n\n`Well, this is really for the future,' even if you can't really demonstrate\n\nany benefit in the future from it. But you just stick it on your balance\n\nsheet instead of counting it as an expense. And there's a lot of other\n\nsmaller tricks companies can use.\n\nIf I can go back to the stock options for just a second, though, to me that is\n\nanother major contributing factor to the rise in accounting fraud in the late\n\n'90s because what stock options did is they very closely tied CEO pay and\n\nexecutive pay to the performance of stock price. And in one way that's a good\n\nthing. You want your CEO to be thinking about his stock price a little bit.\n\nYou don't want him to be making bad investments. You don't want him to be\n\nwasting shareholders' money. But when you have a situation where the stock\n\ngoes up for one year or two years, the CEO can make $50 million or $100\n\nmillion, really life-changing amounts of money. Then, you know, he or she is\n\ngoing to be incredibly tempted to do whatever is necessary to make sure that\n\nstock price goes up and stays up long enough for him to cash out.\n\nAnd I don't think it's any coincidence that the biggest frauds of the late\n\n'90s, the biggest accounting scams, are generally companies where the CEOs\n\ntook home 50 or 100 or in some cases several hundred million dollars from\n\nstock options.\n\nGROSS: What do you think investors can do to be more confident of the numbers\n\nin the quarterly reports?\n\nMr. BERENSON: You know, it's a hard question because unless you have a CPA or\n\na CFA, you're a chartered financial analyst, it's pretty tough to go through\n\nall this stuff and read it with a fine-toothed comb. There's a few things you\n\ncan do, though. You can make sure you're diversified so that, you know, your\n\nlife savings is not all in one company, especially if it's the company that\n\nyou work for. That's a really big mistake, you know, the people at Enron\n\nmade, some people at Tyco made, people at other big companies where there's\n\nbeen accounting blowups have made, because in some cases the company's going\n\nto have to lay people off just at the same time its stock is going down. So\n\nthat's a really bad thing obviously to have happen to you.\n\nYou can also say to yourself, `Does what this company's doing make sense?'\n\nYou know, people with Enron could never really understand how it was making\n\nmoney, and yet they continued to invest in it. Tyco, which is a company that\n\nI've written about, is a roll-up, and roll-ups meaning that it bought a lot of\n\nsmaller companies. It mainly grew by acquisition, not internally. And\n\nroll-ups have a long history of blowing up because there's a lot of accounting\n\ngames you can do whenever you buy a company. It's one of the easiest ways to\n\ncheat--is in taking over another company.\n\nAnd yet the guys from Tyco said, `Well, we do it differently. We're not like\n\nother conglomerates. We're not like other roll-ups. We really know how to\n\nrun these businesses.' And you have to ask yourself, `You really know how to\n\nrun five different kinds of businesses better than the existing management,\n\nand that's why your profits are so strong?' You know, that story just didn't\n\nmake sense. Bnd yet because the accounting profits were there, because Tyco\n\nwas able to get its accountants to sign off and show a steadily rising\n\nearnings stream, people just bought it. And so if the business does not make\n\nsense to you, you should stay away from it. Now naturally sometimes that\n\nmight cost you some money you might not invest into some great company\n\nbecause, you know, it was a little more complicated than you could understand.\n\nBut in the long run investing is complicated, and it's your money and you\n\nreally need to be careful before you decide to put it into a company.\n\nGROSS: Is there any more regulation you would like to see the SEC do of\n\naccounting and reporting?\n\nMr. BERENSON: I would like to see the SEC be funded in a way that it can\n\ncarry out its responsibilities. I think we have the structure in place, and\n\nwe also have something new called the Public Company Accounting Oversight\n\nBoard, which was brought into law last year as part of Sarbanes-Oxley, the\n\nlegislation that was passed over the summer of last year. And hopefully\n\nSarbanes-Oxley, which strengthened the penalties for companies that commit\n\naccounting fraud, and the Accounting Oversight Board will combine to\n\nstrengthen a system that is pretty strong as long as the resources are devoted\n\nto it.\n\nWhat's been fascinating to me about this is I don't consider myself an\n\nideologue particularly, and yet my book has generated some heat from the right\n\nbecause there's definitely a conservative ideology that the market is always\n\nright and that regulation is a mistake almost at any level. And, you know, I\n\nthink we've had too much of that philosophy in the last few years. And I\n\nthink regulation is an important part of making markets work.\n\nI think CEOs do respond to incentives. I think if they see a high risk of\n\ngetting caught and relatively low rewards because they don't have huge stock\n\noptions, they're less likely to cheat than if they see no risk of getting\n\ncaught and huge rewards. And so I think as important as the regulatory\n\nstructure is having the resources to make that real. Otherwise it's just sort\n\nof dusty laws that are not enforced.\n\nGROSS: Well, thank you so much for sharing some of the things you've learned\n\nin the past few years. Thank you very much for talking with us.\n\nMr. BERENSON: Thanks, Terry.

We're hirsute in all the wrong\n\nplaces. And we fancy ourselves probably the most purest of the second or\n\nthird wave of folk acts that actually hit the charts.

So we look down\n\nprobably on everybody else in this film.\n\nThe obvious guess that most people make is Kingston Trio, but there's a little\n\nbit of Peter, Paul & Mary in this, there's a little bit of Brothers Four,\n\nalthough we're missing a brother, groups like that, you know?

So I thought we'd play two versions of a song that you\n\nco-wrote called \"Never Did No Wanderin.'\"\n\nMr. SHEARER: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: And we'll have The Folksmen version, and then we'll have like the more\n\ncommercial version by...\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yeah. The toothpaste commercial.\n\nGROSS: ...yeah--The New Main Street Singers. But, first, tell us the story\n\nof writing the song.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Well, the writing process was really, as every other part of the\n\nprocess of making this movie, totally different from the normal Hollywood\n\nscheme. Chris--Chris being the director--didn't have a list of songs he\n\nneeded and then call us up and just go, `I need this, this, this and this,'\n\nand we did it to order. We really were like kind of making up the songs based\n\non what we thought, you know, groups needed and what was funny about this kind\n\nof folk music.\n\nSo Michael McKean and I were at my house one day, and I dug up an old record\n\nof the \"Hootenanny\" program. It was a prime-time series on ABC featuring folk\n\nmusic--that's how commercial it got--hosted by that old folkie himself, Jack\n\nLinkletter. And we were listening to a track by--tell me how folkie this\n\ngroup name sounds--The Yachtsmen(ph). And something in the song triggered us\n\nto start saying, you know, `We need a song about rambling. Everybody's got a\n\nrambling song.' That's the one of the great cliches of folk music is a\n\nrambling--`I've been rambling. I've been going here and there.' And I\n\nstarted doing a little bass riff, and Michael and I started playing, and then\n\nwe just thought, you know, `The comic twist on this is a guy who never did no\n\nrambling, never did no wandering.'\n\nGROSS: OK, which leads us right into the song. So first The Folksmen\n\nversion, the pure version, and then the commercial sellout version, The New\n\nMain Street Singers. And this is from the soundtrack of \"A Mighty Wind.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"Never Did No Wanderin'\")\n\nTHE FOLKSMEN: (Singing) My mama was the cold north wind and my daddy was the\n\nson of a railroad man from west of hell where the trains don't even run.\n\nNever heard the whistle of a southbound freight or the singing of its drivin'\n\nwheel. No, I never did no wanderin', never did no wanderin', never did no\n\nwanderin' after all.\n\nTHE NEW MAIN STREET SINGERS: (Singing) Wanderin'. Never did no wanderin.'\n\nMy mother was a cold north wind. My daddy was the son of a railroad man from\n\nwest of hell where the trains don't even run. Never heard the whistle of a\n\nlonesome freight or the singing of its drivin' wheel. No, I never did no\n\nwanderin', never did no wanderin', never did no wanderin' after all.\n\nGROSS: That's two versions of \"Never Did No Wanderin'\" co-written by my\n\nguest, Harry Shearer, one of the stars of the new folk music mockumentary \"A\n\nMighty Wind.\"\n\nDid you ever go through a folk music period yourself?\n\nMr. SHEARER: Not really. Christopher played folk music. Christopher played\n\nbluegrass as a youngster, which is, I guess, one of the purest forms of folk\n\nand/or country music, just really relies on very good playing, among other\n\nthings. But, you know, I remember this music sort of swirling around me when\n\nI was in college, but I was sort of a diehard Frank, Ella, Mel Torme guy. So\n\nI'd hear this music, and every once in a while I'd hear like a weird chord in\n\na Kingston Trio song and go, `Hmm, they've been listening to The High-Lows.'\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. SHEARER: But aside from that, you know, this wasn't my music.\n\nGROSS: Well, The New Main Street Singers have some very High-Lows kind of\n\nharmonies.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yes, they do. Well, John Michael Higgens, who performs as the\n\nleader of it and is also the vocal arranger of that, has that kind of ear. He\n\ngrew up listening to--he said to me once--he's the first person who ever said\n\nto me, his experience being the same as mine, `I just listened to\n\narrangements. If I heard a good arrangement, I didn't care what kind of music\n\nit was.' So he has this ear for great arrangements, and he just throws all\n\nthese sixth and seventh chords in where they don't belong just for the fun of\n\nit.\n\nGROSS: Well, you weren't used to singing folk harmonies. I mean, that's not\n\nthe kind of harmonies you'd sing in Spinal Tap.\n\nMr. SHEARER: No. But, you know, they're sort of in everybody's head, I\n\nguess, or at least they were in all of our heads. That wasn't nearly as much\n\nwork as--you know, everybody in this movie, or almost everybody, either picked\n\nup a new instrument or had to relearn--Gene Levy hadn't played a guitar in 30\n\nyears; Higgens had never played a tenor guitar; Catherine O'Hara had never\n\nplayed the Autoharp; and Parker Posey learned the mandoline for this movie.\n\nSo there was a lot of picking and learning going on, and, you know, a lot of\n\ntrust by Christopher to believe that everybody would--'cause he recorded the\n\nmusic live in the concert sequences--be ready on that day to be in concert\n\nform. It's emblematic of the trust he showed us all through the making of the\n\npicture.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Harry Shearer. He's one of the stars of the new folk\n\nmusic satire \"A Mighty Wind.\" More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nTHE FOLKSMEN: (Singing) Wiley. First Mate Peter's a hardened man.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Harry Shearer. He's one of the stars of the new folk\n\nmusic satire \"A Mighty Wind.\" He also does many of the voices on \"The\n\nSimpsons,\" and he's the host of \"Le Show,\" a public radio program of political\n\nand cultural satire.\n\nSo did you have to learn to play or sing in ways that you had never done\n\nbefore?\n\nMr. SHEARER: I had to really get serious about the stand-up bass, the upright\n\nbass. We had done these gigs from time to time, and I'd pick it up and just\n\nwhack away at it a bit and then put it down again. But we did--a couple of\n\nyears ago, before we did the tour with Spinal Tap, there was a show at Royce\n\nHall at UCLA. Hal Wilner put together a couple of evenings of a tribute to\n\nHarry Smith, who was a folk music archaeologist I guess is the best way to\n\ndescribe him. And everybody came and did songs that Harry Smith had found.\n\nAnd we did three of our own songs because we couldn't be bothered to learn\n\nany Harry Smith songs. And so everybody liked us because we were the\n\nbest-rehearsed people on the bill because we were doing our own stuff.\n\nAnd I had rented this bass, and I just thought, as every amateur does,\n\n`Doggone it, it must be me. I'm not getting enough sound out of this\n\ninstrument.' So I'd work harder and harder at it, and at the end of those\n\ncouple of gigs I had a real nice case of tendinitis. And that's when I\n\nrealized, `OK, I get it. I'll do what the real musicians do. I'll get a good\n\ninstrument first and get it set up the way I like it,' and then, you know,\n\nreally, I played it every day until we made the movie.\n\nGROSS: OK. Time for another song.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Hmm.\n\nGROSS: Here's another song by The Folksmen, and this is called \"Old Joe's\n\nPlace.' And this is the song that actually charted for them.\n\nMr. SHEARER: This is our hit. It got to number 17.\n\nGROSS: You co-wrote the song.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yes.\n\nGROSS: Tell us about writing it.\n\nMr. SHEARER: This was, I think, one of the first Folksmen tunes we wrote when\n\nwe did this piece on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and the premise was this washed-up\n\nfolk group was, for some reason, getting a chance to appear on \"Saturday Night\n\nLive.\" And so you see them backstage before the show trying to decide whether\n\nthey should do their Spanish Civil War song or some, you know, song about a\n\nreal tragedy, a train wreck in a coal mine--you know, keep resisting the idea\n\nof doing the obvious song, which is the only one everybody's ever heard of us.\n\nAnd then, of course, we get on stage and do \"Old Joe's Place,\" so that was the\n\ngag. And it's a typical kind of good timey folk song where every time the\n\nchorus comes around it gets longer.\n\nGROSS: It struck me as very Burl Ives.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yeah, I guess so. It's Burl something.\n\nGROSS: OK. This is The Folksmen with my guest, Harry Shearer, \"Old Joe's\n\nPlace\" from the soundtrack of the folk mockumentary \"A Mighty Wind.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"Old Joe's Place\")\n\nTHE FOLKSMEN: (Singing) Whenever I'm out a-wanderin', chasin' a rainbow\n\ndream, I often stop and think about a place I've never seen, where friendly\n\nfolks can gather and raise the rafters high, with songs and tales of\n\nyesteryear until they say, `Goodbye.' Well, there's a puppy in the parlor and\n\na skillet on the stove and a smelly old blanket that a Navajo wove. There's\n\nchicken on the table, but you got to say grace. There's always something\n\ncooking at Old Joe's Place. Now folks come by around evening time as soon as\n\nthe sun goes down. Some drop in from right next door and some from out of\n\ntown.\n\nUnidentified Man: Pick it.\n\nTHE FOLKSMEN: Well, there's a puppy in the parlor and a skillet on the stove\n\nand a smelly old blanket that a Navajo wove. There's popcorn in the popper\n\nand a porker in the pot. There's pie in the pantry and the coffee's always\n\nhot. There's chicken on the table, but you got to say grace. There's always\n\nsomething cooking at Old Joe's Place.\n\nGROSS: That's \"Old Joe's Place\" with my guest, Harry Shearer, doing bass\n\nvoice and playing bass as well. It's from the soundtrack of the film \"A\n\nMighty Wind,\" the new folk mockumentary.\n\nWhat else did you listen to? You mentioned going back and watching old\n\nepisodes of \"Hootenanny.\"\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: What else did you try to immerse yourself in to prepare for your role,\n\nto get into character?\n\nMr. SHEARER: Well, I can't tell you about some of it because it will give\n\naway a big joke at the end. Suffice to say there was a piece that aired on\n\nNPR a few years back that I cherished for its unintentional comic value, and I\n\nwent and reviewed that for that joke.\n\nBut there's a wonderful documentary about The Weavers, which focuses around a\n\nWeavers' reunion. And since we were going to be reuniting after a long\n\nabsence, we all looked at that as sort of a template for, you know, the\n\nbehavior of these guys. I listened to a lot of--I, sadly, in my extremely\n\neclectic and never-surrendered LP collection, have a lot of folk records that\n\nI had never had occasion to listen to till now for, you know, singing style\n\nand things like that.\n\nBut in terms of character, I didn't do--yeah, I guess I did a little bit of\n\nresearch on guys in groups and just saw what their career trajectories were\n\nafter the `folk music scare,' as Martin Mull calls it, evaporated just to see,\n\nyou know, how paths went before I kind of contributed my little bit as to what\n\nMark Shubb, the character I play--what his life had been since The Folksmen\n\nbroke up.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Harry Shearer. And in the new folk music mockumentary \"A\n\nMighty Wind\" he plays the bass player and bass singer with the folk group The\n\nFolksmen. He co-wrote a lot of the songs in the movie. Harry Shearer also\n\nhosts the public radio show, a political satire, \"Le Show,\" and he does a lot\n\nof voices on \"The Simpsons\" and has been in a whole bunch of movies.\n\nI know this isn't the first time that you've had to do satire about something\n\nas dangerous as war. But, you know, what's it like for you, you know, when\n\nyou're in the middle of war, when you're facing war, to then have to find the\n\nfunny part?\n\nMr. SHEARER: Well, actually this was much easier than doing what I do in the\n\nimmediate wake of 9/11. I think that had a much more traumatic effect on a\n\nlot more people in the audience. And I just thought that was a more\n\nchallenging environment.\n\nYou know, this is another one of our remote-control wars that we're kind of\n\ngetting very good at. And the main difference was that, as with 9/11, some of\n\nmy affiliates, some of them in a town very near to you, Terry, would start\n\npre-empting me as soon as things got serious, you know. And my reaction was,\n\n`Hey, wait a minute. I'm doing material on this subject, too, you know? I'm\n\nnot doing my Pamela Anderson material right now. And it maybe is valuable for\n\npeople to hear this at this time.'\n\nOtherwise, you know, you just get far more inundated in terms of the media\n\ninput. And I found myself watching and listening and reading to way, way more\n\nstuff than I do normally to try to keep up because, you know, when the news\n\nchannels here--here's an odd moment--all news, then you have to kind of look\n\nbehind what they're doing or look around what they're doing to see what else\n\nis going on. So I just found myself kind of obsessing on it, as I would\n\nnormally anyway, but the radio show is just a way to have an excuse for the\n\nobsessions.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Harry Shearer. He's one of the stars of the new folk\n\nmusic satire \"A Mighty Wind.\" More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Harry Shearer. He's one of the stars of the new folk\n\nmusic satire \"A Mighty Wind.\" He also does many of the voices on \"The\n\nSimpsons,\" and he's the host of \"Le Show,\" a public radio program of political\n\nand cultural satire. When we left off, we were talking about the satirical\n\nsketches he did on the show during the war in Iraq.\n\nWhy don't we hear an excerpt of one of the sketches that you did? And this is\n\n\"Extra Access Tonight,\" which is your version of \"Access\" or \"Extra\" or\n\n\"Entertainment Tonight,\" \"Access TV.\"\n\nMr. SHEARER: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. So this is them talking about how the war news is affecting\n\ntelevision and the Academy Awards.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Extra Access Tonight\")\n\nMr. SHEARER: (As host) If it's wartime, this must be Tuesday, and television\n\nprogrammers are adjusting at a pace that must be stimulating `shock and awe'\n\nin the competition. The Motion Picture Academy decided that the first victim\n\nof this war was the red carpet arrival ceremony, leaving Oscar preshow hostess\n\nJoan Rivers dishing her heart out.\n\n(As Joan Rivers) I mean, it's a great carpet. I mean, what are you supposed\n\nto do with that? That's for the dignity. I mean, yeah, if they wanted\n\ndignity, they should have told Courtney Love to stay home. OK, she's not\n\nreally as the Oscars, is she? I mean, but what are we supposed to say as\n\nthese people arrive? Ah, can you believe that gray suit? Oh, oh, my God,\n\nthose lapels are notched! I mean, you know, it's all right for me;.I have a\n\ncareer. But poor Melissa.\n\n(As host) Co-executive producer Jaime Melarkin(ph) is making last-minute\n\nchanges in NBC's hit reality show \"Fear Factor.\"\n\n(As Jaime Melarkin) All the insect-related stunts are out for the duration of\n\nthe hostilities. We've been banking less-disgusting challenges for just a\n\nsituation like this. This week the contestants all have to eat sweetbreads.\n\nYou know, it's still like, `Yick!' but it's a classier kind of yick.\n\n(As host) On the news of the networks, the competition heats up in wartime.\n\nWe talked to CNN's Aaron Brown.\n\n(As Aaron Brown) In terms of the people over there, everybody's, you know,\n\nsent their `A Teams.' So it is really a contest about in the chair next to\n\nthe anchor who's got the best former generals. And I just happen to think our\n\nformer generals are top of the line.\n\n(As host) Not surprisingly, Dan Rather has a different take on the war, the\n\nnetwork war.\n\n(As Dan Rather) I'll tell you this, CBS News, as a gold-standard-type\n\ntelevision news operation, has--we've got two mandates that we're crippled\n\ncritter serious about, do the best possible electronic journalism about this\n\nconflict, real pedal-to-the-metal journalism, and, two, make rock-solid sure\n\nfor certain that we don't put the Howard Stern prank caller on the air\n\nanymore.\n\n(As host) For the networks, there's one...\n\nGROSS: That's an excerpt of a sketch from Harry Shearer's public radio\n\nprogram \"Le Show,\" with Harry Shearer doing all the voices.\n\nMr. SHEARER: That's a good example, Terry, of how one can work comedically in\n\ntimes that people might think, (in low voice) `Well, this is a little serious.\n\nThis is a little dramatic. What are you going to do? Make fun of the\n\nkillings?'\n\nNo, the media, one way or another, is always ripe for satire at times like\n\nthis, (as Aaron Brown), especially people like Aaron Brown who has been a\n\nparticular bete noire of mine lately, as I think you may know. It is...\n\nGROSS: That's Aaron Brown from CNN. Why is...\n\nMr. SHEARER: ...Aaron Brown from CNN.\n\nWell, you know, first of all, Aaron Brown--one trick I've learned is you kind\n\nof try to figure out who--if you're trying to do somebody, get a character,\n\nyou try to figure out whom they're doing. I realize when I was trying to get\n\nahold of a character of the voice of Dick Clark that Dick Clark had actually\n\ngrown up listening to Arthur Gottfried(ph), and that kind of helped me figure\n\nout how to (as Dick Clark) do Dick Clark. You know, 'cause Dick Clark has\n\nthis relaxed way of talking, and I thought, `Who was he listening to?'\n\nGROSS: That's great. That's really interesting.\n\nMr. SHEARER: And with Aaron you can hear he spent way too much time watching\n\nTed Koppel because Ted Koppel will never say, `It's.' He'll always say, (as\n\nTed Koppel) `It is a,' (in normal voice) you know, to kind of focus you on the\n\nthing he's going to say. And Aaron has, (as Aaron Brown) `It is a very hard\n\nhard story we have to,' (in normal voice) and then, of course, it's just his\n\ninsane self-obsession, like we care how hard it was for them to do the story,\n\nyou know. (As Aaron Brown) Andrea Koppel, you've had a long day. Take the\n\nrest of the night. (In normal voice) Do that on e-mail; don't waste air time.\n\nGROSS: That dates back to \"Entertainment Tonight,\" I think, 'cause that's the\n\nfirst time, like, years ago on \"Entertainment Tonight\" when people would be\n\ncomplimenting, `Leonard, that was an excellent film review.'\n\nMr. SHEARER: Oh, God.\n\nGROSS: `Thank you for that.'\n\nMr. SHEARER: Well, it actually, goes to, I think, before that to local news\n\nwhere they were just told to chat with each other. And, `Bill, good weather\n\ntonight. That's a good-looking forecast. I'd change that suit jacket,\n\nhowever.' That stuff, you know. Everything bad started with local news.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm. Well, Harry, I think we'll close with a great sketch that you\n\ndid of the Larry King show. Do you want to say anything about this sketch\n\nbefore we hear it?\n\nMr. SHEARER: The guest has been on with Larry before. Right after 9/11 he\n\npremiered a song that he had called \"Where's Your Flag?\" which was just\n\nchallenging businesses. He was saying he wasn't going to go into any business\n\nthat didn't have a flag in the window.\n\nAnd I told you this off the air. My favorite story ever about being\n\nrecognized was when I was flying into San Francisco Airport recently, and I\n\nwas in the men's room just washing my hands, you know, because of the epidemic\n\nand everything. And you don't like to be approached when you're in the men's\n\nroom. But a guy walked up to me sending very strong non-stalker vibes and\n\njust said two words to me, (in other voice) `Duey Gordon(ph),' and it broke me\n\nup, so.\n\nGROSS: That's great. Well, Harry Shearer, it's been great to talk with you.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Terry, it's always a pleasure.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Le Show\")\n\nMr. SHEARER: (As announcer) CNN coverage of the war in Iraq continues with a\n\nspecial edition of \"Larry King Live.\" Now here's \"Larry King Live.\"\n\n(As Larry King) We're in Lexington, Kentucky, tonight where I'll be emceeing\n\nthe Mint Julip Ball(ph) for the benefit of the Pulmonary Edema Foundation\n\nMonday night. Coming up next hour, our own Aaron Brown discusses his\n\nanxieties about the war with Dr. Phil.\n\nBut right now in our Los Angeles studio an old friend of \"Larry King Live,\"\n\neven though he's young enough to be my son from my fifth marriage. He first\n\nhit the spotlight with the boy band Boys 'R' Us(ph). He's been on his own now\n\nfor a couple of years building his solo career. And he's with us tonight\n\nbecause--well, he's going to tell us why he's here tonight. That's why he's\n\nhere. The fabulous Duey Gordon.\n\n(As Duey Gordon) Good evening, Larry. Thanks for having me back.\n\n(As Larry King) Yeah.\n\n(As Duey Gordon) I know it's wartime and I'm no general or journalist or\n\nanything, but...\n\n(As Larry King) Well, you know, Duey, I think people want to know about the\n\naffect of the war on the ordinary celebrity, even Ma.\n\n(As Duey Gordon) Well, I hope so, Larry.\n\n(As Larry King) Yeah.\n\n(As Duey Gordon) As you know, I don't think an artist has to keep his heart\n\noff his sleeve all the time. I think you remember I was involved in the whole\n\npost-9/11 patriotism thing before it was even a bandwagon. So...\n\n(As Larry King) No. You're song \"Where's Your Flag?\" was toppin' the charts\n\nright up till the promotion...\n\nGROSS: Harry Shearer from his public radio program \"Le Show.\" He's one of\n\nthe stars of the new film \"A Mighty Wind.\" I'm Terry Gross.\n\nWe'll close with a recording by Nina Simone. She died yesterday at the age of\n\n70. This is her 1967 version of the Bob Dylan song \"I Shall Be Released.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"I Shall Be Released\")"
