Back then he was known as the ‘whitest Black man on television.’ Then, a couple of years ago, I received an email saying they’d employed a Black actor, who then copied my voice. The result is a Black man imitating a white man imitating the whitest Black man on TV.”\n\nKevin Michael Richardson took over the role of Dr. Hibbert in 2021. Shearer still voices Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Principal Skinner, Mr. Burns, Waylon Smithers, Rainier Wolfcastle, and Kent Brockman, among many more.\n\nRELATED: ‘The Simpsons’ Co-Creator Says Homer Will Keep On Strangling Bart: “Nothing’s Getting Tamed”\n\nShearer also said he “wasn’t sure about joining The Simpsons in 1989,” as “voice actors are usually given a script after the animation is completed.”\n\n“I took the job because it was the other way around,” he added. “I play more than 20 characters but the evil nuclear power plant owner, Mr. Burns, is a favorite. I styled his voice on Ronald Reagan.”\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nHollywood & Media Deaths In 2024: Photo Gallery & Obituaries\n\n2024-25 Awards Season Calendar - Dates For Oscars, Tonys, Guilds, BAFTAs, Spirits & More\n\nNew Series On Broadcast Networks In 2024-25: Photo Gallery"
