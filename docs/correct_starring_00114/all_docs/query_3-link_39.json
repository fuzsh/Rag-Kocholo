Also cowrote Spinal Tap Reunion.\n\nSIDELIGHTS:\n\nComic actor and writer Harry Shearer, best known for the cult classic movie This Is Spinal Tap, has been involved with show business since early childhood, when he appeared on \"The Jack Benny Show\" at age seven and in the movie Abbott and Costello Go to Mars in 1953. Born in Los Angeles, Shearer studied political science at the University of California at Los Angeles and then pursued graduate work at Harvard University in urban government. He soon returned to California, contributing freelance articles to Newsweek and Los Angeles Times as well as New West, Los Angeles magazine and Film Comment. Shearer also taught English and social studies in high school and worked in the California State Legislature. But his true calling proved to be satire.\n\nShearer was a founding member of the comedy group the Credibility Gap, with whom he began to build his writing and performing career. He cowrote, coproduced, and performed on their albums A Great Gift Idea and The Bronze Age of Radio. He went on to cowrite and coproduce Albert Brooks's album A Star Is Bought and to host the Los Angeles radio program Le Show, which has become nationally syndicated. In 1979 he joined the hit TV show Saturday Night Live as a writer and regular cast member. Though he left the show after his first season, he returned for another season in 1984.\n\nShearer has worked on several films as an actor and screenwriter. He has appeared in Cracking Up, Real Life (for which he co-wrote the screenplay), One-Trick Pony, The Right Stuff, The Fisher King, A League of Their Own, Wayne's World Two, I'll Do Anything, and Speechless. He has also played voice roles in Animalympics and My Stepmother Is an Alien. Shearer has also done voice roles for the popular animated television series The Simpsons and has appeared in such television programs as Harry Shearer's News Quiz and Likely Stories. This Is Spinal Tap, however, remains Shearer's best-known work.\n\nThe film, directed by Rob Reiner in 1984, is a spoof of such music classics as Woodstock, 1970—which chronicled the famed rock concert that gave its name to a generation—and The Last Waltz, 1978, which was a farewell tribute to The Band. This Is Spinal Tap, structured as a mock-documentary, follows the career of the fictional English band Spinal Tap from their genesis as 1960s-era flower children to their transformation into heavy metal stars. Shearer, who plays the role of bass player Derek Smalls, wrote the script with partners Michael McKean (lead singer David St. Hubbins) and Christopher Guest (lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel). \"For all its japes and jokes, the movie is really about exhaustion of the spirit,\" remarked Richard Corliss in Time. This Is Spinal Tap, which gained an immediate following among the baby boomer generation and other rock fans, also impressed serious critics like Stanley Kauffmann of the New Republic, who stated: \"If Monty Python were American, this is the rock-documentary satire they might have made.\"\n\nIn 1993 Shearer published a collection of his newspaper columns titled Man Bites Town: Notes of a Man Who Doesn't Take Notes. His first book, it received favorable reviews for its consistent humor. A Publishers Weekly contributor noted that the book has \"style, wit, and above all, a resonance that echoes beyond its brief confine.\" Shearer is \"at his funniest when marveling at the world's absurdities,\" observed Joe Collins in Booklist.\n\nAlso in 1993, Shearer joined the Spinal Tap gang once more for TV's much-welcomed A Spinal Tap Reunion, which Shearer also co-wrote. This special featured the band's reunion concert at London's Royal Albert Hall. Like the film, reviewers noted, the television special achieved a high level of satire. A contributor to Entertainment Weekly pointed out that the heavy metal song parodies are \"pretty funny,\" but that the best aspects of A Spinal Tap Reunion are the interviews with various personalities who are requested to comment on the merits of the band.\n\nIn his 1999 book It's the Stupidity, Stupid: Why (Some) People Hate Clinton and Why the Rest of Us Have to Watch, Shearer examines the extremely negative feelings many people had at the time about then-President Bill Clinton. Richard Corliss, writing in Time, called the book \"a smart challenge to lazy thinking.\"\n\nShearer's unbounded creativity has also led him to novel writing. His first novel, Not Enough Indians, is a satire about the locals of Gammage, NY, who, in an effort to keep their town alive, petition the government to recognize them as an Indian tribe named the Filaquonsett so they can go into the casino business. After building the casino, they find themselves in a feud with a neighboring tribe that has a casino. For impinging on their casino business, the neighboring tribe builds a toxic dump next to the casino built by the Filaquonsett tribe. Allison Block, writing in Booklist, called Not Enough Indians a \"wickedly funny debut novel.\" A Kirkus Reviews contributor noted that the author \"has a fine time lampooning just about every institution and piety modern America has to offer.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nInternational Motion Picture Almanac, Quigley Publishing (New York, NY), 1996.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBooklist, April 1, 1993, Joe Collins, review of Man Bites Town, p. 1402; August 1, 2006, Allison Block, review of Not Enough Indians, p. 43.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, December 18, 1992, review of Spinal Tap Reunion, p. 50.\n\nKirkus Reviews, August 1, 2006, review of Not Enough Indians, p. 750.\n\nLibrary Journal, September 1, 2006, Christine DeZelar, review of Not Enough Indians, p. 138.\n\nLos Angeles, December, 2002, R.J.
