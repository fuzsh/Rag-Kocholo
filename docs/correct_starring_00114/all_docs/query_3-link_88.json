        "text": "Actor Harry Shearer, who voices Mr. Burns, Ned Flanders and Smithers on The Simpsons, will return to the animated show after all.\n\nEntertainment Weekly reports that Shearer has signed the same deal as his five fellow primary voice actors on The Simpsons: Dan Castellaneta, Yeardley Smith, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright and Hank Azaria. That means Shearer is contracted for four more seasons (though FOX has only renewed the show for two more years right now), earning an estimated $300,000 USD per episode.\n\nShearer's signing is surprising because the actor announced he was leaving The Simpsons back in May. At the time, Shearer said he wanted the freedom to do other work, which baffled Simpsons showrunner and executive producer Al Jean, who claimed all of the cast has great free time to pursue other project.\n\nJean even wished Shearer the best of luck in his future endeavors while revealing that the voice actor's roles would be recast. That won't be the case now, however, with Shearer back on board. The 71-year-old actor also provides the voices of Seymour Skinner, Lenny, Dr. Hibbert, Kent Brockman, Reverend Lovejoy and Otto.\n\nAs for Shearer's late signing, it shouldn't interrupt the 27th season of The Simpsons. There are apparently seven holdover episodes from last season (with Shearer's voice), and his contract was signed early enough before new cast members were brought on.\n\nEvan Campbell is a freelance news writer who streams games on his Twitch channel and chats about movies and TV series on Twitter."
