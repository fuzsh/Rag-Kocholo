        "text": "Updated May 14, 2015, 9:14 a.m. ET:\n\nHarry Shearer‘s Simpsons roles will be recast after the voice actor passed on re-upping, showrunner Al Jean said.\n\nThe Simpsons producer said that Shearer was “offered the same deal the rest of the cast accepted, and passed,’’ in a statement to the New York Times’ Dave Itzkoff. Jean added that Shearer’s characters will be “recast with the finest voiceover talent available.’’\n\n“The show will go on and we wish him well,’’ Jean said, then joking: “Maggie took it hard.’’\n\nAlso read: 10 things learned from Fox’s Upfront event\n\n[fragment number=0]\n\nShearer will appear in this year’s “Treehouse of Horror,’’ however, Jean said on Twitter. The actor reiterated to his own fans on Twitter that the decision “wasn’t about money.’’ Still, there’s some confusion, Jean admits, as he says they always let Shearer have “freedom’’ for other projects — which was the actor’s provided reason for not re-upping.\n\n[fragment number=1]\n\nFox did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment on the matter.\n\nAlso read: Watch trailers for new Fox shows: Minority Report, John Stamos in Grandfathered, Rob Lowe in The Grinder (video)\n\nPreviously:\n\nThe voice actor behind The Simpsons characters Mr. Burns, Ned Flanders and Principal Skinner has announced that he is leaving the show.\n\nHarry Shearer shared the news that he won’t return to the Fox animated classic on Wednesday night via Twitter.\n\n“From James L. Brooks‘ lawyer: “show will go on, Harry will not be part of it, wish him the best,’’ he wrote, referring to The Simpsons producer, Brooks.\n\n“This because I wanted what we’ve always had: the freedom to do other work. Of course, I wish him the very best.’’\n\nAlso read: The Simpsons gets 2-season renewal from Fox\n\nHe went on to thank fans for their support over the years.\n\nShearer, 71, has worked as an actor, comedian, writer, voice artist, musician, author, radio host and director over the course of his long career. He co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in the 1984 satirical rock film This Is Spinal Tap, and then worked on Saturday Night Live as an unofficial replacement for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, which he reportedly called “living hell.’’\n\nAlso read: The Simpsons Bart and Lisa sing about their crappy hometown (video)\n\nShearer joined The Simpsons in 1989, and despite initially being concerned that voice work would be boring, he has since brought some of the most distinctive characters to life, saying that he modeled Mr. Burns on Ronald Reagan and Lionel Barrymore.\n\nFox renewed The Simpsons for its incredible 27th and 28th seasons earlier this month. All-in, that will take the series to 625 episodes.\n\nThis season, The Simpsons is averaging a 2.7 rating/8 share among adults 18-49 and six million total viewers, per Nielsen’s “most current’’ numbers, which incorporates Live Plus 7 Day Viewing where available, and it has won 31 Emmys.\n\nRead Shearer’s tweets below.\n\n[fragment number=2]\n\n[fragment number=3]\n\n[fragment number=4]"
