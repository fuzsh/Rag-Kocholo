We finally broke the sound barrier\" someone cries, as if anyone in earshot or in the audience hadn't worked that out—while the epilogue (\"And for a brief moment, Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot anyone had ever seen\") just feels like a cheap shot...especially given that it's spoken by Levon Helm, who also plays Yeager's gum-loaning wingman. But the arrival of Jeff Goldblum and Harry Shearer in minor roles heralds a marvelous change of pace, and Kaufman's affectionate satire of the Mercury program's training regimen and PR campaign enlivens docudrama conventions by…\n\n35mm at the Music Box as part of the Chicago Critics Film Festival. Almost 48-year-old me was there, as was 8-year-old me. We both left exhilarated. This is a first ballot entry into the 'They Don't Make 'Em Like They Used To' Hall of Fame. My brain actually can't reconcile that the man who wrote and directed this isn't one of the first 5-7 names mentioned in the discussion of greatest directors ever; the choices Philip Kaufman makes are that striking. I need to find a platform to discuss this more. Hell, I may need to record a commentary. But a few thoughts:\n\n-How about the fact that we don't meet even one of the future astronauts for at least…\n\n\"[...] But on that glorious day in May 1963, Gordo Cooper went higher, farther, and faster than any other American - 22 complete orbits around the world; he was the last American ever to go into space alone. And for a brief moment, Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot anyone had ever seen.\"\n\nWhen I was excavating the bottom drawers of my dad's office filing cabinet a few weeks after his death in 2016, I happened upon old spiral notebooks filled with his recordings of every name and every single event portrayed in this story, not to mention every subsequent astronaut name, Apollo mission, rocket launch, etc that followed after it. My dad always told me his first love as…\n\nDon’t let the 3 hour+ runtime deter you, The Right Stuff flies by at Mach 2.0. It is a comprehensive look at the evolution of the space program from sound barrier flight tests through the beginnings of the space race. Featuring an amazing ensemble cast, this is an entertaining and educational thrill ride for all ages.\n\nBasically, if you like metal things that fly through the air, this is a must see. The Right Stuff reminds us that these test pilots are science’s rock stars. If I could live alternate lives, one variation would have to be that of one of these adrenaline junkies who live life right at the very edge. Few existences seem more exhilarating and worthwhile despite…\n\nCowboys going into space. One of the few movies made in Hollywood after the mid-60s that can be right called Fordian. Mythmaking and its double mirror. American exceptionalism and its feats of clay. It is about how Cold War made it essential to print the legend about the US space program. only it was made when the same Cold War was still ongoing (and one of the characters was an actual presidential hopeful) which adds an extra bite. It tones down Wolfe's jabs at Mercury while keeping the book overall shape and perspective and adding the larger doubling giving and take between myths and their cracks as a continuous thing (which might also be argued is the difference between writing…\n\nThis adaptation of Tom Wolfe's extensively researched novel covers an awful lot of ground so fortunately has a charitable runtime of over three hours. The story commences in 1947 with test pilot Captain Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier and culminating with the successful launch of Mercury-Atlas 9, the final crewed space mission of the U.S. Mercury program, piloted by astronaut Gordon Cooper.\n\nDirected by Philip Kaufman and co-written with William Goldman, it utilises Yeager as a counterpoint for the training and eventual undertakings of seven astronauts chosen for Project Mercury, America's first human spaceflight program. While the core of the narrative focuses mainly on the training and exploitation of the astronauts, Kaufman applies himself to keeping their plotlines counterweighted…\n\nSam Shepard and Dennis Quaid play polar opposites in The Right Stuff, the story of the United States’ most famous penis-measuring contest. Every time Jeff Goldblum runs down the hall to deliver disheartening news about Russia giving us the space race smack down, our resolve to redeem ourselves grows. And grows. LBJ doesn’t take L’s lightly.\n\nShepard plays Chuck Yeager, the cool, reserved test pilot that breaks sound barriers but doesn’t engage in the local pilots’ bar smack talking. He’s got the talent, he’s got the rep, and he’s got Barbara Hershey! He’s also got the too cool to be too cool for school vibe Sam Shepard often exudes. Unfortunately, Yeager’s lack of a college diploma keeps him from becoming…"
