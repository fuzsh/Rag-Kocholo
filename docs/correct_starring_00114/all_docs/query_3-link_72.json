        "text": "The American Archive of Public Broadcasting Preserves 2,000 Le Show Programs for the Nation\n\nPress Contact: María Peña, Library of Congress, (202) 739-1075, mpena@loc.gov | Emily Balk, GBH, 617-300-5317, emily_balk@wgbh.org\n\nNEW LE SHOW COLLECTION AND EXHIBIT PROVIDE ACCESS AND CONTEXT TO SHEARER’S LEGACY IN PUBLIC MEDIA AND SATIRE\n\n“Wildly clever, iconoclastic stew of talk, music, political commentary, readings of inadvertently funny public documents or trade magazines and scripted skits.“ –VOGUE MAGAZINE\n\nThis December, to mark the fortieth anniversary of celebrated actor, author, director, musician, political satirist and broadcaster Harry Shearer’s weekly hour-long public radio series Le Show, the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, a collaboration between the Library of Congress and Boston public media producer GBH, is launching the Le Show Collection, a publicly accessible digital archive of more than 2,000 hours of broadcasts, stretching back over the past four decades.\n\nSince December 1983, the star of The Simpsons and Spinal Tap has unfailingly produced and presented this weekly, hour-long romp through the worlds of media, politics, sports and show business with a heady mix of biting satire, probing interviews, comedy sketches and a wide-ranging musical selection from wherever he is in the world.\n\nShearer’s first foray into public radio was The Voice of America from KCRW in Santa Monica, which premiered on December 4, 1983. The show was later named The Hour of Power and then Le Show in 1985. Shearer’s comic sketches and song parodies include uncanny impersonations of all the US presidents over the years. From Reagan to Bush, Clinton to Obama, Trump to Biden, they all feature in ongoing series modelled adroitly on pertinent popular culture formats. The news reports detail often-buried perspectives on official policies (“News from Outside the Bubble”) and organizational cultures (“News of Inspectors General”); perception management (“Apologies of the Week”); trends in business, media, and advertising (“Reading the Trades”); threats to the planet (“News of the Warm,” “News of the Atom,” and “News of Microplastics”); and cyber-security breaches (“Smart World”). In-depth interviews with world-leading experts in their fields – authors, journalists, politicians, scientists, artists and performers, give searching insights into the most vital issues of our times.\n\n“Nothing is more evanescent than doing a radio show. So it’s deliciously ironic to have them collected like this, for leisurely review. I have always loved radio, and Le Show has always been a way of being in contact with an audience without having to cater to heavily inebriated people,” said Shearer. ”Thanks to all the folks up and down the line who have made Le Show’s improbable endurance possible.”\n\nUp to now, this rich collection of programming has only existed on cassettes, CDs and DATs as a private collection of Shearer’s company, Century of Progress Productions. However, in 2021 the Library of Congress and Century of Progress Productions began to work together to ensure the collection of more than 2,000 Le Show episodes, at risk of degradation, would be preserved for present and future generations.\n\nThis year, from December 11, they will be available to researchers, educators, journalists and the public on the AAPB website.\n\n“Le Show’s comedy has roots in traditions that came to the fore in the 1950s, when a young generation of satirists commented regularly on current events in nightclubs, college campuses, and political cartoons, often revealing hidden logics, absurdities, and hypocrisies through artistic imitations,” said Alan Gevinson, the Library of Congress project director for AAPB. “At the dawn of the twenty-first century, satirical news-oriented television shows provided critical alternatives to more traditional presentations of the news. Bridging both eras, Le Show, now fully digitized, will be a treasure trove for cultural historians, media scholars, and the public to explore our recent collective past through satirical creations. The AAPB is honored to archive such a vital collection.”\n\nComplementing the Le Show Collection, the AAPB exhibit Harry Shearer’s Le Show: Sonic Portal to News, Satire, Memory, History curated by Rosa A. Eberly, Associate Professor of Rhetoric, Department of Communication Arts & Sciences, Penn State University, provides historical context to Le Show and shines a spotlight on a representative fraction of the Le Show collection. The exhibit includes nine sections that offer an overview of the series and showcases what Eberly calls Shearer’s “sonic satire and information-sharing” on Le Show over the past four decades. ​​Shearer contributed four short pieces about the evolution of Le Show over the decades, charting its development from the 1980s to the present.\n\n“Harry Shearer’s Le Show is a cornucopia of vital information, sonic satire, and rhetorical richness well worth listening to again and again,” said Eberly. “If journalism is the first rough draft of history, Le Show is a second, revised through a lens of satire, each week managing not only to teach but somehow to delight — though the delight is sometimes excruciating.”\n\nAbout the American Archive of Public Broadcasting\n\nThe American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) is a collaboration between the Library of Congress and the WGBH Educational Foundation to coordinate a national effort to preserve at-risk public media before its content is lost to posterity and provide a central web portal for access to the unique programming that public stations have aired over the past 70 years. To date, over 160,000 digital files of television and radio programming contributed by more than 430 public media organizations, producers and archives across the United States have been preserved and made accessible for long-term preservation and access. The entire collection is available on location at the Library of Congress and GBH, and more than 100,000 files are available online at americanarchive.org.\n\nHarry Shearer Biography\n\nHarry Shearer is best known for his work on both THE SIMPSONS and THIS IS SPINAL TAP.
