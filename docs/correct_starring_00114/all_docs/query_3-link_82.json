        "text": "Harry Shearer, the actor who voices Mr Burns, Ned Flanders and many other characters in The Simpsons, has announced he is leaving the show.\n\nHe revealed the news on Twitter, where he told fans he wants to pursue other projects.\n\nShearer, who also voices Principal Skinner and Kent Brockman, quoted executive producer James L Brooks' lawyer who reportedly said: \"Show will go on, Harry will not be part of it.\"\n\nHis tweets read: \"From James L. Brooks' lawyer: \"show will go on, Harry will not be part of it, wish him the best. (1/2)\n\n\"This because I wanted what we've always had: the freedom to do other work. Of course, I wish him the very best. (2/2).\"\n\nIt had been reported that production on seasons 27 and 28 was being delayed by Shearer, who was holding out for a deal on his contract.\n\nIt is not clear what led to the actor choosing to leave the show after over 25 years as a key part of the team.\n\nShearer did not comment on what the future holds for the characters he voices, who also include Mr Burns' adoring aide Waylon Smithers, Reverend Lovejoy and Scratchy.\n\nBut The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean tweeted: \"#everysimpsonsever The show will go on, made by people who love it and see in it the most wonderful vehicle for satire ever.\"\n\nHe reassured fans worried about characters being killed off that they will be recast if Shearer does not return\n\nIn reference to Game Of Thrones' notoriously gruesome episode called the Red Wedding where many characters died, Jean said there would be \"no yellow wedding\".\n\nFans have expressed their shock at Shearer's departure.\n\n@jome20 wrote on Twitter: \"This is the most depressing news I've heard today. I know Simpsons has to end as some point. But I'm not ready for that.\"\n\n@adiskype said: \"Good~grief. How i wish it was April Fools Day.OMG.Harry. That it should come to this. 'The Simpsons' is over&done w/out ye.\""
