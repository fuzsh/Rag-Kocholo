        "text": "Harry Shearer\n\nHarry Shearer arrives at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards on Sunday, Feb. 10, 2008, in Los Angeles.\n\n(Chris Pizzello | The Associated Press)\n\n\"The Simpsons\" has been renewed for seasons 27 and 28, but one iconic voice won't be returning to the Fox animated series this fall.\n\nHarry Shearer, the voice of Mr. Burns, Homer's neighbor Ned Flanders and Principal Skinner, announced early Thursday morning that he is leaving the show after 26 years. In a series of tweets, the 71-year-old actor hinted at contract problems, saying he wanted \"the freedom to do other work.\"\n\nTMZ reports Shearer was the last cast member who hadn't yet signed on for the 2-year contract extension with Fox, and negotiations apparently broken down. Sources tell the celebrity gossip site he had issues with money in his contract, specifically on the back end and merchandising.\n\nShearer has been a part of the longest-running show on TV since it debuted in 1989, though \"The Simpsons\" appeared earlier than that as part of \"The Tracy Ullman Show.\" He has voiced more than 100 characters in the cartoon town of Springfield, including Smithers, Kent Brockman and many minor characters."
