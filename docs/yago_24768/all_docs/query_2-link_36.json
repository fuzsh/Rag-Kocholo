        "text": "HOLLYWOOD -- Lilli Palmer, an acclaimed actress and author in Europe and the United States who will be seen in her final role in next week's 'Peter The Great' TV miniseries, has died of a heart attack, it was announced Tuesday. She was 71.\n\nFriends of the family said Palmer, who underwent a gall bladder operation late last year, suffered the attack at home in Los Angeles Monday. A spokesman at Forest Lawn Mortuary in Glendale said funeral arrangements would be private.\n\nPalmer, the former wife of actor Rex Harrison, was a striking woman with large slightly hooded eyes and a wide emotional range. She began her career on the stage in London in the 1930s and married Harrison in 1939. In the 1940s she moved to the New York stage and to Hollywood.\n\nAmong Palmer's films were 'Cloak and Dagger' with Gary Cooper in 1945, 'Body and Soul' with John Garfield in 1948, 'The Four Poster' with Harrison in 1952, 'The Pleasure of His Company' with Fred Astaire in 1961, 'The Counterfeit Traitor' with William Holden' in 1952 and 'The Boys From Brazil' with Gregory Peck in 1978.\n\nShe won several acting honors including three Golden Globe awards, the Cinema Nuova Gold Plaque of Venice, the Donatello Award of Italy, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures Award and two television Emmys.\n\nIn 'Peter the Great,' a four-part NBC miniseries that begins Sunday, Palmer plays Natalya, the mother of the young Peter, dedicated to both her son and her homeland. A network spokesman described her performance as 'beautiful and regal.'\n\n'Lilli was a gracious, lovely lady, a pleasure and a delight to work with, a trooper in every sense of that word,' said producer Marvin Chomsky.\n\n'She held up under the extreme Russian cold and rigors of shooting in the Soviet Union. She was always in good humor and had a smile for everyone. She endured long hours in the makeup chair and never ever complained.'\n\nPalmer was born in Posen, then in East Prussia but later part of Poland, on May 24, 1914, and moved to Berlin at age 4. Her mother was an actress, her father, Dr. Alfred Peiser, chief of surgery at one of Berlin's biggest Jewish hospitals.\n\nShe showed an early interest in acting and at 18 in 1932 joined one of Germany's best repertory companies, the State Theater of Darmstadt.\n\nAdolf Hitler's thugs staged an anti-Semitic demonstration at the theater a year later but she escaped harm because her father was a World War I hero. Her contract with the Frankfurt Playhouse was canceled without explanation in 1933, however, and her father put her on a train for Paris.\n\nShe traveled on to London in 1935 and quickly gained a reputation on stage and screen. She met and married Harrison -- then the reigning matinee idol of the British stage -- in Birmingham, England, in 1939. They had one son, Carey, who became a professor in England, and were divorced in 1957.\n\n'I thought I'd have a fling and it lasted 17 years,' she once said of the stormy marriage. 'He took violent umbrage that I wrote about the breakup of our marriage (in her autobiography).\n\n'But I was terribly upset. I thought I married for life and that was my bad luck. Things started to go wrong when we went to Hollywood. If I'd been able to drink and had enjoyed all those parties I might still be with him, but I'd be a totally different person.'\n\nHarrison objected to her contention that he married her successor, his third wife, actress Kay Kendall, because he knew Kendall was dying and wanted to bring her happiness.\n\nPalmer branched out as an author and a painter, and her acting appearances became less frequent. The personal plea of Noel Coward tempted her back to the stage in 1966 but she complained that 'acting is bleeding boring' and said she hoped to confine herself to cameo film roles, preferably cameos.\n\nHer autobiography, 'Change Lobsters and Dance,' sold more than 1 million copies and was translated into several languages, and its success as well as the plaudits of literary critics surprised and delighted her.\n\n'I never thought it would interest anyone,' she said. 'I wasn't in a concentration camp. I wasn't raped. I wasn't violated. I was so lucky. When I got that kick in the behind from Hitler I thought it was the tragedy of my life. But it was the luck of my life.'\n\nA sequel to the autobiography, in the form of a novel, 'The Red Raven,' appeared in 1978. Another novel, 'A Time to Embrace,' was published in 1980, and she enjoyed more success in 1983 with 'Night Music,' about a professor whose life changes after his wife dies of a heart attack.\n\nAfter her divorce from Harrison, Palmer married Argentine-born German writer and actor Carlos Thompson. They lived on a mountainside near Zurich.\n\nPalmer also made several appearances on American television, including 'Ford Theater.' She and Harrison worked together on TV in the mid-1950s, co-starring on the 'U.S. Steel Hour's' anthology and on 'Omnibus,' for which they did Maxwell Anderson's 'The Trial of Anne Boleyn.'"
