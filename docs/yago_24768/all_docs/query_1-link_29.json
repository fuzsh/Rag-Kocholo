        "text": "When he accepted his Academy Award for My Fair Lady (1964), he dedicated it to his \"two fair ladies\", Audrey Hepburn and Julie Andrews. Andrews had played Eliza Doolittle in the Broadway production, but was passed over for the film version in favor of Hepburn.\n\nKnighted by Queen Elizabeth II of England at the age of 81. At the time of his investiture as a knight, Harrison stated that he thought his best film performance was not as Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady (1964), for which he'd won his Oscar, but as Julius Caesar in Cleopatra (1963), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. (1989)\n\nHe had a reputation for being very abrupt with his fans. One night, after a stage performance of \"My Fair Lady,\" it was late, cold and pouring rain and an old woman was standing alone outside the stage door. As Rex emerged, she asked him for his autograph. Rex told her abruptly to \"Sod off\"; the old woman was so enraged that she rolled up her program and struck him with it. Harrison's co-star Stanley Holloway, who had followed Rex out in time to see this, commented sarcastically that, for the first time in theater history, \"The fan has hit the shit!\".\n\nBy the time the film version of My Fair Lady (1964), producer Jack L. Warner was concerned that Harrison, by then, in his mid-50s, was too old to play Henry Higgins, as the character was supposed to be in his late 30s.\n\nWas so fanatical about wine that he often sent the bottles back if it was not to his liking, sometimes even to his own wine cellar.\n\nWon three Tony Awards: in 1949, as Best Actor (Dramatic) for \"Anne of the Thousand Days\"; in 1957, as Best Actor (Musical) for \"My Fair Lady\", which he recreated in an Oscar-winning performance in the film version of the same title, My Fair Lady (1964) and a Special Tony Award in 1969. He was also nominated in 1984 as Best Actor (Play) for his role as Capt. Shotover in George Bernard Shaw's \"Heartbreak House\".\n\nTwice appeared with fellow Academy Award winner Claudette Colbert late in their careers in Broadway productions; \"The Kingfisher\" by William Douglas-Home opening at the Biltmore Theatre on December 16, 1978, running for 181 performances and \"Aren't We All\" by Frederick Lonsdale, opening at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on April 2, 1985, running for 93 performances."
