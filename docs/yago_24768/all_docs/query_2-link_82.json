Her rising career took her to Hollywood in 1945, where she, together with her first husband Rex Harrison – quickly achieved acceptance. When she returned to Germany in 1964, after successes on Broadway, she was overwhelmed with offers and awards (among them two national film awards). Her books have been translated into more than 30 languages."
