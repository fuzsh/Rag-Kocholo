        "text": "If you have been paying close attention over the past three weeks, you would have noticed that Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited fuel stations are popping up around your locality.\n\nThe number of NNPC stations in Nigeria will increase over the next few months. That’s because on October 1st, 2022, the NNPC announced that it had acquired all the retail service stations under Oando Plc.\n\nThe Oando retail brand, OVH Energy Marketing, is the owner and operator of all the Oando-branded fuel stations in Nigeria. Now that NNPC has bought them all, the Oando fuel stations in your locality will rebrand as NNPC fuel stations.\n\nMetrics\n\nBefore buying Oando fuel stations, NNPC was operating over 500 fuel stations of its own. Oando, on the other hand, had 380. So, in the next few months, NNPC-branded fuel stations in Nigeria will become more than 800.\n\nOther assets that NNPC acquired from Oando include eight liquefied petroleum gas plants, three lube blending plants, three aviation depots, 12 warehouses, and one reception jetty with a 240,000 metric tons monthly capacity.\n\nHow does this affect you as a Nigerian?\n\nAcross the country, customers have complained about buying petrol at different rates from different locations and fuel stations.\n\nAs NNPC fuel stations will soon increase, it gives more Nigerians the opportunity to buy premium motor spirit (PMS) also known as petrol at the official rate of N189.46 per litre. NNPC fuel stations are known for always selling petrol at official rates.\n\nWhat you should know"
