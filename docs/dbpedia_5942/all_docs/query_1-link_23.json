Strategic & Operational Review Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic & Operational Review Terminaling Oando Terminals and Logistics (OTL): Industrialisation is accelerating in West Africa, and with it, the private development of the much-needed energy infrastructure required to drive growth represents a sustained opportunity for value creation for best in class operators. Overview This division, a downstream asset development organisation, combines commercial, technical and socio-political understanding to excel in this space. OTL is set to complete its ﬁrst major investment as Oando leads the way in signiﬁcantly reducing the cost of importing products into the country. The organisation completed the ﬁnancing and commenced construction of the pioneer Apapa Submarine Pipeline (ASP) project: A jetty in the Lagos harbour connected to the Major Marketers’ storage facilities by a half kilometre subsea pipeline, and a new 3km onshore line delivering almost 3 million tonnes of petroleum products a year. OTL will maintain an interest in advantaged downstream asset development projects such as Liqueﬁed Petroleum Gas (LPG) storage and world scale white fuels terminaling in the south- west that will receive products destined for inland delivery. These projects will seek to further enhance the sector leadership of the downstream division. In summary, the division is on the verge of creating increased value, whilst the company remains poised to secure additional opportunities as they arise out of new insight and new partnerships. Oando’s entry into the terminals business completes its presence in all segments of the energy value chain. 45,000Ship berthing capacity for larger vessels of up to 45,000 tonnes cargoes currently restricted by shallow draft at other ports Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 13\n\n14.

Inspiring energy Growth through transformation and innovation Inspiring energy Growth through transformation and innovation xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx 2014 saw the company continue its journey upstream and become a major upstream player in Nigeria with the acquisition of the ConocoPhillips Nigerian business. Strategic & Operational Review Chairman’s statement 54kboeddaily production Chairman’s Statement 2014 will probably stand as the most pivotal yet challenging year of my tenure as Chairman of your company. Global oil prices fell sharply during the latter part of 2014, as a result of excess supply and weakening demand across all major consumers of energy. For the past 4 years till mid 2014, oil prices were stable at approximately $110 per barrel, but dropped by almost 50% by the end of the year. We have seen further falls in 2015 and all indicators point to a new norm for oil prices which imply that some adjustments are required in the short to mid-term, while we continue to plan for a proﬁtable long term future that will see increasing demand for energy. In application of the most prudent accounting principles and guided by our unwavering commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, we have executed an exhaustive valuation of all oil and gas assets and absorbed signiﬁcant impairments that have materially impacted both our income statement and our balance sheet. While these impairments were seen consistently across the sector internationally, we do not take them lightly; as your stewards, our primary task is to retain your trust and support through these cyclically trying times to deliver value over the long term. While 2014 began on a high note with the re-basing of the national accounts, which increased Nigeria’s GDP to $509 billion, making us the largest economy in Africa and 26th in the world, the excitement of the rebasing was marred by falling oil prices and increased instability in the North, which impacted Nigeria’s economic growth in 2014. The reduction in foreign exchange receipts, decline of funds into the external reserves, increase in budget deﬁcit, exit of foreign investors from the stock markets and ﬁxed income (bond) markets all contributed to a devaluation in the naira of approximately 19% by the end of the year. For a company reporting in naira with signiﬁcant dollar instruments, this resulted in signiﬁcant foreign exchange losses across the Group. Strategy Delivery 2014 saw the company continue its journey upstream and become a major upstream player in Nigeria with the acquisition of the ConocoPhillips Nigerian business. Our growth in the higher margin upstream sector will provide greater value creation upside while requiring us to rationalise our asset portfolio to concentrate more on upstream opportunities and deleverage our balance sheet to reﬂect the inherent risk in the sector. I am glad to report that these new assets did not incur any impairments on 95% of its producing portfolio and remain a solid addition to our portfolio, contributing over 54,000 boepd to our production proﬁle, compared to approximately 4,000 bpd in 2013. Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 201418\n\n19. Strategic & Operational Review Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Our legacy assets saw continued capital investment which will support solid production volumes for the mid to long term. However, the majority of the asset impairments were borne here and the operations focus here will switch to one of best in class operations integrity and cost management, while retaining our full commitment to the highest standards of safety. Our oilﬁeld services business, consisting of the best swamp drilling rig ﬂeet in the region, remained challenged by funding issues that have typiﬁed Nigerian Joint Venture operations over the last decade. Fleet utilisation was signiﬁcantly reduced and as such, further impairments were borne here. Future proﬁtability in this sector will be driven by the approval of alternative funding arrangements for JV operations in Nigeria and we look forward with optimism of seeing concrete progress in 2015. Our gas and power business goes from strength to strength with the commencement of the latest expansion to our Lagos pipeline franchise, the fourth of its kind. We remain bullish in our commitment to gas and power and will continue to grow aggressively in this space bringing innovative solutions to create value and accelerate adoption of gas as the primary energy source for power. Our downstream business continued to serve the nation as the leading fuels provider in the toughest of circumstances. A notable development was the proposed strategic partnership that may ultimately see a majority economic share of the downstream business change hands to Helios Investment Partners and the Vitol Group. As we pivot the business upstream and extract value from our historic investments in downstream, we retain our engagement to this key pillar of the Nigerian economy and will continue adding value through the launch of new customer experience enhancements and the expansion of previously undervalued products such as LPG. Outlook Global crude oil prices could remain at current low levels for an extended period, reducing investment viability, potential revenues and proﬁts and in turn, operating cash ﬂows. Despite these challenges we remain steadfast in our commitment to our strategic goals of growth in the upstream. As government policy continues to evolve in the gas and power sector, we remain well positioned to capitalise on what is a remarkable opportunity and will seek dedicated funding to plot a winning path for that journey. Along with selected asset sales and divestments, we will seek to deleverage the balance sheet and create a platform for long term proﬁtability. HRM Oba Michael A.

Business Review Inspiring energy Growth through transformation and innovation Business Review Group chief executive’s report Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 201424 In 2014, we completed our transition to an upstream led organisation and at the same time absorbed signiﬁcant asset impairments typical of the sector we have elected to enter. This has led to an earnings loss that will be unfamiliar to most of our shareholders and it is with great humility and with recognition of the privilege accorded that I present your company’s operational and ﬁnancial performance for 2014. It was an extremely volatile year for the oil and gas industry as crude oil prices dropped from an average of $110 per barrel to $55 per barrel at the end of the year. The decline in global oil prices, which continued in 2015, forced us to record signiﬁcant reductions to the fair value of our asset portfolio. This led us to accept non-cash impairments and due to the associated impact on the Nigerian economy, material devaluation charges on our dollar denominated instruments. The upstream’s signiﬁcant upside opportunities come with commodity pricing risk, as such, the impairment tests, based on economically producible volumes at current price projections, carried out on all our legacy assets, resulted in write downs of over N130 bn. In addition to this, we also made prudent provisions for government receivables totaling N13.4billion, despite being in possession of a Tribunal award for the same amount. As mandated, we continue to prioritise safety and are pleased to report another year of record breaking Lost Time Injury (LTI) performance across all our operations with zero time lost to injury. It was still a game changing year for the company, despite the challenges, as we evolved from a predominantly downstream company to a leading indigenous upstream player with the landmark $1.5billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips Nigerian oil and gas business. This saw our upstream division move from ~4,000 bbls to ~54,000 boepd, and our 2P reserves grow from 18.9mmboe to 420mmboe by the end of 2014. The increased production and the sale of our hedging instrument enabled the upstream subsidiary, OER, to pay down in excess of $350 million of our initial $900 million acquisition debt to date. The year also saw signiﬁcant progress with our legacy assets. Abo-12 well was successfully drilled with lower completion performed and ﬂow tested and Abo-8 well was completed as an oil producer on the Anom01 and Anom02 reservoirs. Ebendo-6 well was drilled, completed and tested, increasing production capacity to 7,140, in which OER has a working interest of 3,213 bbl/d. Ebendo-7 was successfully drilled and tested and together with our operating partners, we successfully completed the 51Km Umugini evacuation pipeline which It was still a game changing year for the company, despite the challenges, as we evolved from a predominantly downstream company to a leading indigenous upstream player with the landmark $1.5billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips Nigerian oil and gas business. 420mmboe 2P reserves Mr. J. A. Tinubu Group Chief Executive\n\n25. provides an alternative route for crude transport from the Ebendo ﬁeld for crude oil produced from the Ebendo ﬁeld through the Trans Forcados export pipeline. In the midstream, we commenced construction of the Greater Lagos Pipeline Expansion (Phase IV) Project, a 9km pipeline which will open up the Ijora - Lagos Island - Victoria Island markets to our gas products. We expect connection to new customers along the pipeline route will begin in 2016. In furtherance of our leadership position in the sector, the subsidiary also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with General Electric to engage in various initiatives to develop power generation projects, Compressed Natural Gas facilities and mini Liqueﬁed Natural Gas projects in the country. While we will seek to extract value from strategic asset sales in this part of the business due to the ﬁxed nature of project returns upon elimination of construction risk, as government policy evolves and opens up new vistas, we will seek new investment partners and heavily commit to continued leadership in gasping the value creation opportunities we are convinced exist here in gas distribution and power generation. The downstream division continued to show leadership with the launch of key products to the Nigerian market to boost vendor and customer experience: The Smart Pay system offers ﬂexible payment options to our customers, the Extranet provides customers with real time access to transaction information and an increase in Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) installations, increases storage facilities by 1.4million litres of AGO and PMS. The Company has progressed discussions for a strategic partnership with Helios Investment Partners and Vitol group to divest 60% economic rights of Oando Downstream for a total enterprise valuation of $461 million. This is in line with our strategic goals of placing our fundamental growth expectations on the Upstream with the cash proceeds of the divestment utilised towards debt reduction to bolster our balance sheet. Our strategic focus is to increase our operational efﬁciencies to support returns in a challenged operating environment, accelerate the effort to deleverage our balance sheet by adding selected asset sales and return the company to proﬁtability. At the same time, we will maintain our focus on safety, capabilities development of our people and the highest standards of corporate governance to create the necessary platform to be the partner of choice for appropriately priced Nigerian upstream assets as they may be made available through IOC divestment programmes and reﬁnancing efforts of recent acquisitions made prior to the oil price fall.

Global growth remained signiﬁcantly below the 10-year average for Asia Paciﬁc, Europe & Eurasia, and South and Central America. Growth was below average for all regions except North America. Oil remains the world’s leading fuel, with 32.6% of global energy consumption. Emerging markets continued to dominate the growth in global energy consumption despite the fact that growth in these countries was well below its 10-year average. China and India grew by 4.2% and 7.1% respectively making it the largest national increments to global energy consumption. Global oil production more than doubled that of global oil consumption, rising by about 2.1 million b/d. Non-OPEC production recorded a growth of 2.1 million b/d with the United States recoding the largest growth in the world of over 1.6 million b/d. OPEC’s production remained ﬂat and share of production dropped to 41%, its lowest since 2003. In Nigeria, the recent decline in crude oil prices has resulted in short and medium term economic challenges. Nigeria is an oil exporter with oil revenue making up to 90% of the government’s foreign exchange earnings; this strain has led to a major devaluation of the local currency (Naira). Although it is the 13th largest oil producer, Nigeria continues to lack proper oil reﬁneries and imports its petroleum products. The Federal Government is continuously burdened with the responsibility of paying subsidies to oil marketers, in 2014 the Federal Government paid about N 832.1 Billion ($5.5 Billion) in oil subsidies. Despite the current environment, domestic oil production has risen slightly by 2.5%, and onshore divestments continue to be an industry trend further driving indigenous participation in the country.

Following acquisition of its interest in the NAOC JV on July 31st 2014, OER’s working interest share of total production sold from NAOC JV in 2014 was 7.5 MMboe (comprised of 2.5 MMbbls of oil, 27.2 Bscf of gas and 0.5MMbbls of natural gas liquids). Therefore, in 2014, OER’s share of daily production sold from NAOC JV averaged 24,672 Mboe per day (consisting of 13,768 bbls/d of oil, 147,945 MMscf/d of gas and 2,582 bbls/d of natural gas liquids), over the period after acquisition. As of December 31, 2014, OER held a net share in the NAOC JV 2P reserves of 401.2 MMboe (comprised of 131.5MMbbl of oil, 14.6 MMbbls of natural gas liquids and 1,530.9 Bscf of gas), working interest Best estimate unrisked Contingent resources of 38.9 MMboe, working interest Best estimate of risked Contingent resources of 32.1MMboe, working interest Mean estimate unrisked Prospective resources of 44.2 MMboe and working interest Mean estimate of risked Prospective resources of 15.2 MMboe. The assets of the NAOC JV also include extensive infrastructure, comprising 12 Flowstations, an oil processing centre, an oil export terminal, three gas plants (Kwale, Ob-Ob and Ogbainbiri), the Kwale-Okpai IPP, a network of approximately 1,190 km of pipelines and associated infrastructure including, roads, power stations and heliports. Some of the NAOC JV’s main export pipelines are used by third parties and agreements are in place for transportation and processing. In addition, some gas is supplied from the Akri ﬁeld to the Oguta plant. Reserves have been attributed to Beniboye in OML 62, which is currently not producing. The wells and ﬂowstation are capable of producing but production stopped in 2013 after the assets was vandalized. Prior to that incident, the ﬁeld was producing about 2,000 barrels of oil per day, which was evacuated to Shell-operated Forcados Terminal 10km away. Capital Budgets and Budgeted Capital Expenditure: From July 30 to December 31, 2014 capital expenditures on OMLs 60–63 totaled approximately $38.1 million. Capital expenditures included $9.9 million spent on development drilling activities in OMLs 61 and OML 63 plus a number of work- over activities in the area. In addition, OER incurred $28.3 million on facilities related to the Ebocha Oil Centre, production facility enhancements and the repair of gas pipelines. In 2015 OER will continue developing OMLs 60 - 63 and estimates that $35.6 million will be expended on crude oil related projects and $24.1 million on gas projects in OMLs 60 - 63. The anticipated crude oil development expenditures include signiﬁcant investment in environmental and safety projects, new development drilling, and completions and recompletions of previously drilled wells. Planned natural gas projects consist of drilling and completing new wells, along with enhancements to natural gas facilities and pipelines. OML 56 (EBENDO) Overview Ebendo Marginal License (42.75% OER WI; Energia, an indigenous company and operator, 55% WI), was carved from OML 56 in the central Niger Delta, approximately 100 km north-west of Port Harcourt. The License covers an area of 65 km2 (16,062 acres). The License includes two ﬁelds, the Ebendo ﬁeld (producing), Obodeti ﬁeld (undeveloped) and one prospect, Ebendo North. Ebendo operates under Marginal Field terms that beneﬁt from advantageous ﬁscal terms. Production from the Ebendo ﬁeld began in 2009 and the ﬁeld currently has ﬁve producing wells. OER’s working interest share of total production sold from Ebendo in 2014 was 0.65 MMboe (consisting of 0.4 MMbbls of oil and 1.5 Bscf of gas), hence OER’s share of daily production sold from Ebendo averaged 690 Mboe per day (consisting of 970 bbls/d of oil and 4,136 MMscf/day). As of December 31, 2014, the Ebendo License held net 2P reserves of 7.9 MMboe (comprised 5.4 MMbbls oil and 14.9 Bscf of gas), working interest Best estimate unrisked Contingent resources of 1.3 MMboe, working interest Best estimate of risked Contingent resources of 0.9 MMboe, working interest Mean estimate unrisked Prospective resources of 1.2 MMboe and working interest Mean estimate of risked Prospective resources of 0.2 MMboe. Following the successful drilling of Ebendo wells 5, 6 over 2013 and well 7 over 2014, oil production capacity within OML 56 has grown to 7,140 bbls/d gross for OER and Energia Limited the operator of the asset (3,052 bbls/d net to OER). Prior to December 2014, full production capacity had been hampered because the export of oil had been constrained at 3,093 bbls/d (1,322 bbls/d net to OER) via the Ase River- NAOC JV pipeline network. The Umugini pipeline, which has a capacity of 45,000 bbls/d and was completed in December 2014, now provides an alternative evacuation route for Ebendo’s crude oil enabling the asset to produce at full capacity. Capital Projects and Budgeted Expenditure OER budgeted $22.7 million in capital expenditures for Ebendo in 2014 and actually incurred a total of $10.7 million on activities which included the drilling of Ebendo 7 and the purchase of additional crude oil storage tanks for the ﬁeld. OER also participated in the completion of the Umugini pipeline. The budget variance in capital expenditures was a result of higher cost of completing of the Ebendo 7 well that resulted in deferring the drilling of an additional well and construction of a new ﬂow station into 2016. The Umugini pipeline was completed in December 2014. In 2015, OER has budgeted $7.7 million in capital expenditures for facility and pipeline overhauls and enhancements.\n\n31. Strategic & Operational Review Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 31 OML 13 (QUA IBO) Overview Qua Ibo (40% OER WI and technical partner; NEPN, an indigenous company, 60% WI and operator) is located in onshore Nigeria, near the mouth of the Qua Iboe River, immediately adjacent to the ExxonMobil Qua Ibo Terminal. The License covers an area of 14 km2 (3,459 acres) and includes one producing ﬁeld (Qua Ibo). Qua Ibo operates under Marginal Field terms that beneﬁt from advantageous ﬁscal terms. In its capacity as technical services provider, ORPS oversees, together with NEPN, the operations on Qua Ibo. ORPS agreed to fund certain aspects of NEPN’s costs on Qua Ibo until ﬁrst oil, following which ORPS will be entitled to 90% of NEPN's sales proceeds from its 60% share of crude oil production until NEPN's obligation plus a 10% fee is paid in full. The production facility was commissioned in December 2014 and the ﬁeld demonstrated potential above 2000bbls/d but sustained production did not commence before year end. Production from two wells, via three strings, is scheduled to start properly in ﬁrst quarter of 2015, following the completion of the associated cluster crude delivery and sales infrastructure into the Qua Iboe Terminal. As of December 31, 2014, Qua Ibo License held net 2P reserves of 3.5 MMbbls of oil, working interest Best estimate unrisked Contingent resources of 0.5 MMboe and working interest Best estimate risked Contingent resources of 0.3 MMboe. Capital Projects and Budgeted Capital Expenditure In 2014, OER incurred capital expenditure of $14.7 million on pipeline, crude processing, facility costs and the construction of a ﬂow station, allowing for new crude oil production from the Qua Ibo ﬁeld’s C4 and D5 reservoirs in January 2015. Budgeted capital expenditures for Qua Ibo were $40.6 million in 2014. The reduction in capital expenditures in 2014 as compared to budget was a result of delaying the drilling of Well 5 until 2015. In 2015, OER has budgeted $0.6 million in capital expenditure for facility enhancements. OML 125 (ABO) Overview OML 125 (15% OER WI; Eni, operator, 85% WI) is located approximately 40 km offshore from the western Nigerian coast in water depths ranging from 550 m to 1,100 m. The License covers an area of 1,983 km2 (490,010 acres). The License includes one producing ﬁeld (Abo ﬁeld), one undeveloped discovery (Abo North) and 13 prospects, of which 6 were evaluated for the 51-101 Statement. OML 125 operates under a Production Sharing Contract. Production from the Abo ﬁeld began in 2003 and the ﬁeld currently has four producing wells, two other wells are shut- in pending ﬂowline repairs while another is waiting on the arrival of an oil well Christmas tree. In addition there are two water injection wells and two gas injection wells. In 2014, OER’s working interest share of total production from OML 125 was 1,205,630 bbls of oil, hence OER’s share of daily production sold from OML 125 averaged 3,303bbls/d of oil. Capital Projects and Budgeted Capital Expenditure During 2014 OER incurred $89.7 million of capital expenditure primarily on drilling and completions and production infrastructure, compared to budgeted capital expenditures of $37.5 million for OML 125 in 2014. OER completed and hooked up ABO 8, drilled and completed ABO 12, re-entered and sidetracked the ABO 3 well. Production infrastructure expenditures included enhancements to its FPSO, capital maintenance on ﬂowlines and a new phase of gathering systems. The signiﬁcant increase in actual expenditures as compared to the 2014 budget was primarily the result of the additional project of re-entering and sidetracking ABO 3 well plus higher than anticipated costs to drill and complete ABO 12. In 2015, OER has budgeted $68.4 million for capital expenditure such as gathering system construction projects, installing ABO 12 upper completion, drilling and completion of ABO 13, along with safety projects and maintenance projects extending the life of the FPSO. 2014 impairments on OML 125 totaled N14.3 billion. OML 90 (AKEPO) Overview Akepo Marginal License (40% OER WI and technical partner; Sogenal, operator, 60% WI) was carved from OML 90 and located in shallow waters (<20m) of the western Niger Delta. The License covers an area of 26 km2 (6,425 acres). The License includes one undeveloped ﬁeld (Akepo) and two prospects (A and B, collectively referred to as Akepo North). Akepo operates under Marginal Field terms that beneﬁt from advantageous ﬁscal terms. As of December 31, 2014, Akepo License held working interest Best estimate unrisked Contingent resources of 3.3MMboe, working interest Best estimate of risked Contingent resources of 2.2 MMboe, working interest Mean estimate unrisked Prospective resources of 3.7 MMboe and working interest Mean estimate of risked Prospective resources of 1.2 MMboe. The Akepo ﬁeld was discovered in 1993 and is currently being studied for development. Currently, there are no production facilities installed at Akepo. A production well (Akepo-1ST) was drilled and tested in 2009. Plans for standalone development using a leased ﬂoating production facility have been aborted due to its sub-economic outlook. The current development concept involves a single-well tie-back to a nearby facility (Britannia-U FPSO). Technical studies and negotiations are ongoing with expectation of commencing production in 2017. 2014 impairments on OML 90 totaled N11.3 billion.\n\n32. OML 134 (OBERAN) OML 134 (15% OER WI; NAE operator, 85% WI) is located offshore in water depths ranging from 550 m to 1,100 m approximately 80 km from the western Nigerian coast. The License covers an area of 1,132 km2 (279,723 acres). The License includes three undeveloped discoveries (Oberan-1 fault block, Oberan-2 fault block and Minidiogboro), two single-well discoveries (Engule and Udoro) and nine prospects, of which six were evaluated for the 51-101 Statement. There has been no production from OML 134 to date. As of December 31, 2014, OML 134 held working interest Best estimate unrisked Contingent resources of 1.5 MMboe, working interest Best estimate of risked Contingent resources is 0.8 MMboe, working interest Mean estimate unrisked Prospective resources of 16.9 MMboe and working interest Mean estimate of risked Prospective resources of 3.9 MMboe. Presently, there are no producing ﬁelds within the License area. There is one discovered and partially appraised ﬁeld (Oberan) and three shallow single-well discoveries (Engule, Udoro and Mindiogboro). The most recent activity on OML 134 was the drilling of Mindiogboro-1 exploration which ended in January 2014. The well encountered gas in the shallower reservoirs targeted. For 2015 budgeted capital expenditure of $2.64 million is planned, mostly relating to geotechnical, AVO, sedimentological and structural studies. 2014 impairments on OML 134 totaled N46.6 billion. OML 145 OML 145 (20% OER WI; ExxonMobil operator, 80% WI) is located offshore in water depths ranging from 1,000 to 1,500m, approximately 110 km from the western Nigerian coast. OER acquired interests in OML 145 as part of the acquisition of ConocoPhillips’s Nigerian business in July 2014. The license covers an area of 1,293 km2 (319,507.5 acres) and includes two undeveloped discoveries (Uge and Uge North), two single-well discoveries (Nza and Orso) and ﬁve prospects. There has been no production from OML 145 to date.

OML 131 OML131 (100% WI; operator OER) is located offshore in water depths ranging from 500 to 1,200 m approximately 70 km from the western Nigerian coast. OER acquired interests in OML 131 as part of the acquisition of ConocoPhillips’s Nigerian business in July 2014. The license is expected to be unitized with OML 135 with a resulting unit share of 51% for OML 131. OML 131 covers an area of 1,204 km2 (301,000 acres) and includes two undeveloped discoveries (Bolia-Chota and Ebitemi) and 2 prospects (Pulolulu and Chota East). There has been no production from OML 131 to date. As of December 31, 2014, OML 131 held working interest Best estimate unrisked Contingent resources of 41.2 MMboe, working interest Best estimate of risked Contingent resources of 23.6 MMboe, working interest Mean estimate unrisked Prospective resources of 165.9 MMboe and working interest Mean estimate of risked Prospective resources of 38.4 MMboe. 2014 impairments on OML 131 totaled N1.6 billion. BLOCKS 5 AND 12, EEZ OF STP OER holds its interest in Blocks 5 and 12 through its 81.5% interest in EEL. In February 2010, in accordance with agreements signed in 2001 and 2003, the government of STP awarded OER Blocks 5 and 12, located within the country’s EEZ. EEZ Block 5 (81.5% WI) is the subject of PSCs which were signed on April 18, 2012 and a $2 million signature bonus was paid. Negotiations with the government for Block 12 are still continuing. During 2011, existing 2D seismic surveys were used to complete the evaluation of the blocks and identify a number of prospects. In order to manage the exposure to the risks of high cost exploration in a frontier province in ultra- deepwater, EEL is considering farm-outs. A number of international oil companies have visited the data room in order to assess the opportunity, though there have been no ﬁrm commitments from any of them. As at December 31, 2014 EEL had a total commitment of $5.2 million related to the provision of a performance guarantee and commitment to a four year work program of 2D and 3D seismic acquisition and studies. If justiﬁed by the results of the seismic surveys, EEL can elect (for an additional cost to be determined) to drill the ﬁrst exploration well in the following period of two years. OER funded the full $5.2 million commitment during the ﬁrst quarter of 2014 by delivering a performance bond. OPL 321 AND OPL 323 Overview OPL 321 and OPL 323 (24.5% WI; operator KNOC) are located adjacent to OML 125, offshore from the Nigerian coast, at a water depth of 950 m to 2,000 m. The Licenses cover a combined area of 2,147 km2 (530,535 acres). The Licenses are presently the subject of a dispute between the operator, KNOC, and the Nigerian Government. Due to this ongoing dispute, since 2008 exploration on these Licenses has not been possible and as a result, OER requested and Strategic & Operational Review Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 33\n\n34. received a refund of the aggregate signature bonus paid by OER in respect of the two Licenses ($162 million). No wells have been drilled on the Licenses to date. The License includes ﬁve sizeable prospects (Gorilla, Lobster, Octopus and Whale (OPL 323) and Elephant (OPL 321)). As of December 31, 2014, OPLs 321 and 323 jointly held working interest Mean estimate unrisked Prospective resources of 673.6 MMboe and working interest Mean estimate risked Prospective resources of 149.9 MMboe. 2014 impairments on OPL 321 and 323 totaled N359.8 million. Capital Projects and Budgeted Capital Expenditure on Non-producing Licences OER budgeted $14.6 million in capital expenditures on its Licenses without production. The planned spending on these holdings was signiﬁcantly reduced as OER continues to reassess the geological and geophysical aspects of its projects along with the environmental impacts. In 2015, OER estimates $3.7 million of capital expenditures will be incurred on its Licenses without production. OPL 236 OEPL was awarded this block in May 2007 and the PSC was signed with NNPC in February 2008. This conferred OEPL with a 95% working interest and operatorship of the block. RFO Ventures is the local content vehicle (LCV) with a 5% participatory interest. The block is located onshore Akwa Ibom State with a total acreage of 1,650 km2. A Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMOU) was signed with the Ukana community in August 2008. OPL 236 is currently in the exploration stage with best estimate 2C Contingent Resources of 42.54 Bscf attributable to OEPL. In 2010, 2D seismic data for OPL 236 was purchased and digitized. Work is ongoing on a development program aimed at harnessing the gas reserves in line with the proposed industry gas master plan and delivering the much needed clean energy for the growing energy needs of the utilities and power industry within the region. OPL 278 In January 2006, OEPL acquired a 60% working interest pursuant to a PSC between the Group, CAMAC, Allied Energy and First Axis and the NNPC, in respect of OPL 278. OPL 278 is operated by OEPL under a joint operating agreement (“JOA”) made between OEPL, CAMAC, Allied Energy and First Axis. OPL 278 is located offshore of Rivers State in a transition zone (swamp to shallow marine) on an area of 91.9 km2. Three prospects have been identiﬁed in OPL 278, which are Ke, Prospect A and Prospect B. OPL 282 On 8 August 2006, OEPL acquired a 4% working interest in the PSC between NAOC, Alliance Oil Producing Nigeria Limited (“AOPN”) and NNPC, in respect of OPL 282 (the “OPL 282 PSC”). NAOC holds a 90% working interest in the OPL 282 PSC, while AOPN, which represents the LCV in OPL 282, holds the remaining 10% working interest. The Group holds 40% of the shares in AOPN, while ARC Oil and Gas Nigeria Limited holds the remaining 60%. OPL 282 is operated by NAOC under a JOA made between NAOC and AOPN. OPL 282 is located in a transition zone (onshore to shallow marine) in Bayelsa State, on an area of 695 km2. This block is currently in the exploration phase. An exploratory drilling campaign in the block was kicked off with the Tinpa 1 Dir well, which spudded in Q4, 2011. Tinpa 1 was successfully drilled to a TD of 3700 MD, and it encountered the oil and associated gas in three sands, which were successfully tested and completed. Tinpa 2 was drilled and completed in Q2, 2013 but did not encounter hydrocarbon bearing sands. The well was subsequently plugged and abandoned.

Business Review Inspiring energy Growth through transformation and innovation Business Review Oando Energy Services Limited (OES) Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 201436 The swing in price of crude from $104.71/bbl. in January 2014 to a low of $59.46/bbl. in December 2014 negatively impacted Producer conﬁdence and dampened new investments in global drilling activities. This coupled with the slash in the budget for JV Operators initiated by the National Petroleum Corporation (“NNPC”) in Q3 2013 that continued in 2014 proved to be a disincentive for Operators as manifested in the corresponding reduction in the number of active rigs in-country. As the leading swamp drilling contractor, Oando Energy Services Limited (“OESL”) was signiﬁcantly affected as its contracts with the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (“NAOC”) for OES Teamwork and Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (“SPDC”) for the OES Passion respectively were suspended as a result of insufﬁcient funds. OESL’s other Product Services Lines (“PSL”), drill bits, drilling ﬂuids and mud engineering business, were hard-hit as their collective revenue fell by 12% during the period.

Discussions were initiated and reached advanced stages with potential clients which resulted in the issuance of Letter of Intent (“LOI”) for the rig by Perenco of France and Tenoil of Nigeria, however, these LOIs did not result in work for the rig as the planned drilling programs were postponed. The OES Passion, which celebrated two (2) years without an LTI incident in May, drilled and completed 4 wells for SPDC and achieved an operational efﬁciency of 91.1% before the suspension of the contract in August due to budget cuts. However, discussions with SPDC resumed in November towards the possible reactivation of the rig. Major equipment repairs, maintenance and an accommodation upgrade were carried out, which included replacement of the drawworks motor, rotary table motor as well as the overhaul/inspection and certiﬁcation of TDS by National Oilﬁeld Varco (NOV). OES Integrity continued working for NAOC throughout the year drilling and completing 2 high pressure wells. The rig maintained its zero LTI safety record for the ﬁfth year running and achieved a 96.6% operational efﬁciency surpassing its operational efﬁciency target of 95%. During the same period a brand new Top Drive System (“TDS”) was installed to further improve performance as the rig drilled the deepest NAOC wells in the swamp region and also carried out the 5-yearly major equipment overhaul of equipment such as Travelling Block and Crown Block amongst others, concluding the project in record time and ensuring minimal downtime. OES Respect remained stacked at the Federal Ocean Terminal (“FOT”) in Onne despite several enquiries, tenders and marketing efforts. The Drilling Fluids business continued to provide services to clients such as Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (“SNEPCo”), Energia Limited (“Energia”), Oando Energy Resources Limited (“OER”), Enageed Resources Limited (“Enageed”) TOTAL and NAOC. The unit was able to post a proﬁt for the year despite the challenges experienced with the increase in mud products and availability, and the scaling down of operations by clients. The planned commencement of the utilization of the 25,000bbls mud plant in partnership with Librod Chemicals was postponed as construction of the plant was yet to be completed. The scope of the Drill Bits unit was expanded to include a list of services which would comprise the supply of drill bits, provision of sand control, Directional Drilling (“DD”), Logging While Drilling (“LWD”) / Measurement While Drilling (“MWD”) and Casing Running services. OES executed a Sales Agreement with a Canadian partner company for the marketing of Slotted Liners (a patented sand control technology) in Nigeria in line with the plan for the full deployment of the technology. The partnership with Halliburton Drill Bits Systems (“Halliburton”) continued despite the removal of the exclusivity clause which Strategic & Operational Review Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 37 91% operational efﬁciency by OES Passion\n\n38. initially gave OESL the sole right to distribute Halliburton bits in Nigeria regardless of Halliburton’s entrance into the Nigerian market. The casing running business kicked off with the signing of an agreement with an indigenous company. The management of OESL took the strategic decision to move its Drilling and Completions Businesses to one of its subsidiary now known as “OES Drilling and Completion Services Limited (“OES DCSL”)” which will be saddled with the responsibility to focus on the speciﬁc needs of the drilling and completion ﬂuids as well as the drilling and completions systems units. This was seen as the ﬁrst step to securing the autonomy and ﬂexibility to fund OESL’s Product Service Lines businesses. OESL took concrete steps towards achieving the planned entry into the deepwater drilling terrain by signing a Memorandum of Agreement with an established offshore drilling contractor. Tenders were submitted to prospective clients to aid our entry into this niche sector.In demonstration of its commitment to maintain the high standards set by the company through the strict adherence to policies and procedures, OESL began preparation in earnest for the ISO 14001:2004 EMS certiﬁcation before the end of the year. To mitigate against impact of revenue loss, discussions were held with ﬁnanciers to explore debt reﬁnancing options. 2015 outlook Conclusion of the autonomy implementation for the Completions Systems businesses through OES DCSL will be aggressively pursued to ensure the drilling and completion ﬂuids as well as the drilling and completions systems units achieve the growth targets set. With active alliances in place, vigorous client engagement has commenced and will continue towards ensuring contracts are secured for MWD/LWD/DD and casing running services as well as deploying the slotted liner technology. The supplier base for chemicals has also been expanded to include more capable suppliers and the commencement of the use of the mud plant will boost OESL’s capacity to supply products to clients as well as reduce its exposure to current partners. Discussions have reached advanced stages with SPDC for the reactivation of the OES Passion and it is expected that the rig will commence working for SPDC by Q2 2015. The regularization of the contract extension for OES Integrity contract with NAOC will be aggressively pursued as well as ensure follow-on work is secured for the rig with NAOC and also reduce our current receivables with them. It is expected that a contract will be signed for OES Respect before the end of 2015 due to the several engagements with interested independent operators. OESL will continue to pursue its drive to make an entrance into the offshore terrain and will maintain its current alliances as well as look for opportunities to partner with offshore rig contractors for joint deployment of rigs. The process of obtaining the ISO 14001:2004 EMS certiﬁcation has begun in earnest and will be concluded in 2015. The company recognizes the challenges currently facing the industry as regards the dearth of skilled manpower and as our rigs begin to get contracts, our focus will be to continue our ongoing capacity building programs drive to attract and engage skilled personnel who will work and be trained within our operations unit to deliver quality service to our clients.

Strategic & Operational Review Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Oando Gas & Power Limited In Oando Gas & Power (OGP), we are determined to continuously grow our gas and power sector footprint in Nigeria and the West African region, deploy efﬁcient solutions, and leverage our performance- driven people to enable organizational and customer competitiveness. Review of 2014 During the year under review, we provided competitive solutions to the needs of our customers in the gas and power space through the following operational assets: • Gaslink Nigeria Limited (GNL) • East Horizon Gas Company (EHGC) • Central Horizon Gas Company (CHGC) • Gas Networks Services Limited (GNSL) • Akute Power Limited (APL) • Alausa Power Limited (ALPL) OGP continued to maintain its Quality Management System Certiﬁcation and compliance with the ISO 9001:2008 Standard. In 2014, OGP was certiﬁed to an Integrated Management System (ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007). The ISO 14001 afﬁrms our commitment to Environmental Management Systems while the OHSAS 18001 certiﬁes our best practices in Occupational Health and Safety. OGP also achieved 1 million man- hours Lost Time Injury-Free industry milestone, a testament to our commitment to safe practices for our people and the environment where we operate. 2014 Financial Highlights (Unaudited) The 2014 unaudited ﬁnancial results for OG&P shows a turnover of N29.3 billion, representing a 7% increase over previous year’s result of N27.5 billion which was mainly driven by increase in price of natural gas. In the same year under review, a Proﬁt after Tax (PAT) of N4.05 billion was achieved. This indicates a 13% increase over the comparative ﬁgure of N3.6 billion in 2013. Natural Gas Distribution Natural Gas Distribution Gaslink Nigeria Limited (GNL), OGP’s ﬂagship company, supplied natural gas to over 150 industrial customers through its circa 100km pipeline network in Greater Lagos Industrial Area. During the year under review, we achieved connection of 13 additional customers to our existing pipeline network. We commenced the construction work on the Greater Lagos Pipeline Expansion (Phase IV) Project of about 9km which is expected to open up the Ijora - Lagos Island - Victoria Island markets to our gas products. The project is at its advanced stage of completion and we will start to connect new customers along the pipeline route in 2015. ￼￼￼￼ ￼￼￼￼￼ ￼ In 2014, we commissioned our de- sanding facility which was built to control the occasional sand incursion in a certain segment of our pipeline. During the year under review, we experienced 6 days of total gas outage due to industrial action by our supplier, the Nigeria Gas Company (NGC). In addition, some partial outage and insufﬁcient supply pressure were recorded for about 120 days due to pipeline vandalism, production facilities maintenance and equipment malfunctioning at the NGC City Gate. All these resulted in reduced gas consumption by our customers thereby impacting on our targeted volume sales. East Horizon Gas Company (EHGC), We operated EHGC only in the ﬁrst quarter of 2014, as Oando Plc completed the divestment of its shares in the asset to Seven Energy International Limited. This transaction supported Oando’s upstream growth agenda and also creates capacity for OGP to execute its several other midstream projects. The transaction was completed on 31st March 2014. ￼ 1million man-hours Lost Time Injury-Free industry milestone achieved by OGP Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 43\n\n44. Central Horizon Gas Company (CHGC), is the vehicle incorporated to takeover, rehabilitate and to expand the Trans Amadi industrial area pipeline network. It currently delivers natural gas to 10 industrial customers in Port Harcourt. In 2014, we continued the existing pipeline rehabilitation works which included installation of access way, scrubber and valve replacement & surface corrosion control. In addition, we executed the installation of Cathodic Protection System to protect our pipeline network from surface rust. ￼ We experienced 8 days of network-wide gas outage in the pipeline in 2014, a signiﬁcant improvement over the 36 days recorded in 2013. The gas outages were mainly due to SPDC’s maintenance shutdown, vandalism of SPDC gas pipeline, maintenance of Above Ground Installations (AGI), and valve failure at SPDC Pressure station. During the year, CHGC achieved 1 additional customer connect along its existing pipeline network. We have completed feasibility study of the pipeline expansion projects and in the process of securing relevant regulatory permits/licenses. Construction work is expected to be completed by October 2015. Gas Network Services Limited (GNSL), is the project vehicle for our pilot Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) offering. This project enables customers outside our existing pipeline grid to access natural gas for their industrial processes and power generation. The plant, located in Isolo area of Lagos State, commenced commercial operation in September 2013. ￼ During the year under review, we added 3 additional customers to our clientele, bringing the total number of customers to 7 as at end of 2014. The business Business Review Inspiring energy Growth through transformation and innovation Business Review OGP 2014 asset profiles Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 201444 10industrial customers supplied natural gas by CHGH in Port Harcourt\n\n45. experienced low ramp up of capacity utilization and challenges of low supply pressure from input gas supplies which resulted in inability of GNSL to compress gas for about 989hours in 2014. We have now dedicated adequate resources to ensure speedy ramp up of the capacity utilization of the plant. ￼ Power Generation Akute Power Limited (APL), our ﬁrst Independent Power Plant (IPP) continued to be in operation for four years. The 12.15MW dedicated gas ﬁred power plant has continued to enhance Lagos Water Corporation’s (LWC) operational efﬁciency and contributes to more available potable water and by extension improved standard of living across Ogun and Lagos States. ￼ In the year under review, we achieved an average plant availability of 99.1% and Zero Lost Time Injury (LTI). The plant however recorded some restricted capacity in November and December 2014 due to synchronization and exhaust faults on some of its engines. Alausa Power Limited (ALPL), is the 2nd IPP developed by Oando Gas & Power to provide a dedicated electric power supply to Lagos State Government Secretariat and other government facilities in Alausa environs. In 2014, upgrade of the existing Alausa Power distribution network was carried out to cover LTV, Radio Lagos and other LASG parastatals as well as the entire Obafemi Awolowo Way streetlights. The plant achieved an average plant availability of 96.99% and Zero Lost Time Injury (LTI). However, the plant recorded frequent shutdowns due to on- ﬁeld distribution faults and Balance of Plant (BOP) malfunctions. A technical audit has now been conducted and the recommendations will be implemented in the course of 2015. Business Outlook Oando Gas & Power will continue to grow its business portfolio leveraging organic growth, mergers, acquisitions and divestments opportunities. We will remain a key player in the gas & power sector in Nigeria. Our business plan is premised on strategic expansion of our existing businesses as well as increased capacity utilization in our assets that are currently operating below full capacity utilization. OGP is also focused on ensuring wider market presence and pioneering technological deployment in the gas distribution space in the country. Following the development and operation of a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) plant in Lagos, OGP will develop additional innovative virtual pipelines solutions including small scale Liqueﬁed Natural Gas (mini-LNG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) plants in various parts of the country to meet the gas demands of power plants and industrial customers which do not have access to gas pipeline infrastructure. OGP will progress its participation in the development of a 300mmscf/day gas processing facility recently awarded to her consortium in the Central Franchise Area to ensure we take a leading position in the gas processing business in Nigeria. We will also continue to strive to create ﬁrst mover advantage in future industrial concentration as demonstrated in the planned expansion of OGP’s Central Horizon Gas pipeline in Port Harcourt by about 11km to connect huge industrial concerns in the axis. Furthermore, we will pursue the expansion in OGP’s gas pipeline footprint upon approval and award of the proposed ~400km EIIJ gas distribution project by NNPC –which feasibility study is currently being concluded with OGP playing a lead role in its project development process. While we have developed a portfolio of captive power generation assets serving Lagos State utilities, we are determined to grow the power portfolio to 330MW across Nigeria within the next 5 years. For efﬁcient value accretion, we will continue to rationalize our portfolio (invest, acquire & divest) and go for higher value/scale initiatives in the mid- long term. OGP’s power asset expansion will be driven by participation in embedded power generation, strategic partnerships in power asset acquisition/development and leveraging on our ability to facilitate gas fuel supplies.

OMP’s operations cover the sales, marketing and distribution of the major petroleum products including Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK), Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK), Low Pour Fuel (LPFO), Lubricating Oils, Greases, Liqueﬁed Petroleum Gas (LPG, commonly known as cooking gas), and Bitumen. 2014 Review The past year had its share of successes and challenges for us as a nation and a company. The GDP rebasing completed in the ﬁrst half of the year propelled Nigeria to the top of the continent’s economic chart, displacing South Africa and giving credence to a long-standing belief in the country’s economic dominance. The rebasing was evidence that the economic indices now reﬂect a structural shift towards a higher phase of growth driven by the services sector. Conversely, the falling global oil prices witnessed over the second half of the year eventually led to the devaluation of the Naira amidst increased instability in the north, impacting economic growth.. For the Downstream players including OMP, the delayed release of the ﬁrst quarter PMS import allocations by the Petroleum Products Pricing and Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) got the year off to a slow start as PMS contributes 50%+ of the company’s revenues. This put pressure on our earnings ability, reﬂected in reduction of turnover by 6.7% from 2013 ﬁgures. In addition to this, delays associated with the subsidy payments by the Government has remained fairly the same averaging 130 days with commercial interest rates climbing by approximately 300 basis points from an average of 17% in January 2014 to 20% in December 2014 on bank facilities. The foregoing, in addition to the devaluation effect of the Naira, impacted proﬁtability reducing net margins by 81.3% compared to 2013.

Strategic & Operational Review Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Major successes witnessed during 2014 by OMP include: • The African Skills Development Initiative: Also known as the Oleum mechanic village initiative, it was designed to empower the informal vehicle repair industry with an objective to grow product awareness of our lubricant offerings. The program targets 1000 mechanics over the next ﬁve years and we are pleased to report that the ﬁrst batch of 100 mechanics graduated in December, 2014. • Smart Pay: An automated cash system at our service stations which affords ﬂexible payment options to our customers, thereby improving the customer experience. Currently, the platform is available in 56 stations nationwide. • The Extranet: This is a portal which gives customers real time access to information pertaining their transactions i.e. order status, account statement etc. giving them more control over their product supply management. • Increase in our Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) installations: OMP commissioned combined storage facilities of 1.4 million+ litres of AGO and PMS in 2014 • These initiatives are aimed at ensuring we grow our position in the industry and continue to deliver returns to our shareholders. Product Review PMS volumes were 1.2bn litres, slipping by 7% compared to 2013 driven by a shortfall gap experienced in Q1 as a result of delayed PMS PPPRA allocation. AGO volumes sold during the year stood at 296m litres, a 2% drop compared to 2013. Product sales were maintained by optimizing sales via our retail and commercial channels. HHK sales reduced by 9% to 111m litres due to supply gaps; we however maintained market leadership amongst the major marketers (MOMAN) with 33% market share. Other products (Lubricants, Specialties) ATK sales for the year totaled 146m litres, a 17% increase from 2013 driven by bulk sales to MOMAN. Our share of the major marketers market increased by 300 basis points from 24%. Lubricants volumes reduced by 6% from 2013 to 16m litres. This reduction is attributable to the sustained onslaught of grey products in the industry. Our share of MOMAN market was however maintained at 15%. Initiatives to drive up margins in 2014 such as localized sales promotions; Mechanic Village storms (MV) etc. have yielded results as margins grew by 3% despite the reduced sales. LPG sales stood at 38,440MT reﬂecting a growth of 80% over 2013. This growth enhanced our MOMAN leadership position with a 79% share. Performance in 2014 was driven by product availability due to partnerships with the Petroleum Products and Marketing Company (PPMC) & the Nigerian Liqueﬁed Natural Gas Company (NLNG). 80% growth in LPG sales Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 49\n\n50. 2015 Outlook Despite the bearish operating environment, Oando Marketing PLC remains resolute in maintaining its objective of being the most efﬁcient reﬁned products distribution company, driven by cost leadership, quality and innovation. We will continue to intensify the growth of our high margin Lubricants and Liqueﬁed Petroleum Gas (LPG) businesses and invest in new opportunities to diversify our income streams. 2015 initiatives includes: • The deployment of business intelligence tools which will improve the efﬁciency of our internal operating systems and generate cost savings • The setup of 5 new Pay As You Gas Plants across the country • Market storms across the nation which are designed to increase the brand awareness of our lubricant and LPG offerings • The launch of the new Oleum Transformer bottle as well as new lubricant offerings such as the Oleum Syn, Oleum Super XP which are expected to drive our market dominance amongst MOMAN up to 17% • Promotions during the holidays e.g. Easter, Ramadan etc. to boost sales of all products. • Partnership with the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) which will increase our brand exposure. • Continuation of our African Skills Development Initiative in Ibadan and Benin.
