        "text": "Oil corporation wholly owned by government of Nigeria\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited is a state oil company in Nigeria. Still a fully-owned government company, it was transformed from into a limited liability company in July 2022.[1] NNPC Limited is the only entity licensed to operate in the country's petroleum industry. It partners with foreign oil companies to exploit Nigeria's fossil fuel resources.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nNNPC was established on 1 April 1977 as a merger of the Nigerian National Oil Corporation and the Federal Ministry of Petroleum and Energy Resources.[2] NNPC by law manages the joint venture between the Nigerian federal government and a number of foreign multinational corporations, which include Royal Dutch Shell, Agip, ExxonMobil, TotalEnergies, Chevron, and Texaco (now merged with Chevron). Through collaboration with these companies, the Nigerian government conducts petroleum exploration and production.[2]\n\nThe NNPC Towers in Abuja is the headquarters of NNPC. Consisting of four identical towers, the complex is located on Herbert Macaulay Way, Central Business District Abuja. NNPC also has zonal offices in Lagos, Kaduna, Benin City, Port Harcourt and Warri. It has an international office located in London, United Kingdom.[3] In October 2019, NNPC stated that it had signed a $2.5 billion pre-payment agreement with Nigeria LNG for upstream gas development projects.[4]\n\nIn December 2021, the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Ltd signed a ₦621 billion Memorandum of Understanding to finance the construction of critical road infrastructure in Nigeria.[5]\n\nFollowing passage of a Petroleum Industry Act in August 2021, NNPC now operates as a commercial entity without relying on government funding and direct controls. NNPC was established as a limited liability corporation in the hopes that a private entity will find it easier to access international capital markets. The company will continue to ensure energy security in Nigeria.[6] On the 27th June, 2024, it delivered its first DES LNG Cargo at Futtsu, Japan. [7]\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nPresident Buhari appointed Mele Kyari as the new group managing director (GMD) now known as the group chief executive officer(GCEO) of NNPC.[8] Kyari replaces Maikanti Baru.\n\nLate Dr. Maikanti Baru (7 July 1959 – 29 May 2020) was the former group managing director (GMD). He was appointed group managing director on 4 July 2016, under the presidency of Muhammadu Buhari; he succeeded Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, the Nigerian Minister of State for Petroleum (2015–2019).[9]\n\nIn compliance with Section 59 (2) of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021, President Bola Tinubu has approved the appointment of a new Board and Management team for the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) with effect from December 1, 2023.\n\n1.

Each of the directorate is headed by an executive vice president (EVP).
