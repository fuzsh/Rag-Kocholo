        "text": "The Claimant, in its pre-hearing submission, describes the terms of the Side Letter as follows:\n\n6.2 The Side Letter referred to \"the Production Sharing Contract [...] relating to OPL Nos. 211, 316 and any subsequent OML(s) that may be derived therefrom\", and stated that \"Pursuant to Government policy, the PSC will be approved with the guarantee that the following terms which require amendments to existing Nigerian law are applicable and enforceable\". Thus, like the PSCs themselves and the Memorandum, the Side Letter expressly recognized that NAOC was taking on a \"package\" of two PSCs.\n\n6.3 The \"terms which require amendments to existing Nigerian Laws\" were stated to be those set out in the left hand column of the table below. They included, in particular, the following amendments to the existing tax regime.\n\n(a) PPT at 50% (instead of the existing rate of 85%);\n\n(b) Investment Tax Credit at 50% (instead of the existing rates of between 5% and 20%); and\n\n(c) preferential royalty rates.\n\n6.4. The Side Letter was expressed to be \"valid until the respective applicable laws are amended to reflect the terms of the PSC herein stated\" [A/3/86].\n\n6.5 In March 1999 (nearly six years later), the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Decree 1999 (Decree No. 9 of 1999) [E/8] was enacted, effecting the necessary changes to Nigerian Laws referred to in the Side Letter. Pursuant to Section 19 thereof [E/8/150]. Decree No. 9 of 1999 was \"deemed to have come into force on 1st January, 1993\". As this date precedes the date of the PSC and 211 PSC (5 July 1993), the effect is as if the preferential tax regime was already part of Nigerian law before the PSC and 211 PSC were signed.\n\n6.6. For ease of reference, the table below sets out (1) the contractual provisions referred to in the Side Letter as requiring amendments to existing Nigerian Laws, (2) the corresponding PSC clause reference, and (3) the corresponding provision in Decree No. 9 of 1999 which effected the necessary amendment to existing Nigerian Laws.\n\nSide Letter PSC Decree No. 9 of 1999\"The OPL shall be for a maximum term of ten (10) years\" [A/3/85] Clause 3.1(a) [A/l/8] s.2 [E/8/145]\"The Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT)for petroleum operations under the PSC shall be 50% flat in accordance with the PSC terms \" [A/3/85] Clause 15.2(b) [A/1/29]; Annex B Article III paragraph 2(c) [A/l/46] s.3(1) [E/8/145-146]\"The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for NNPC and the contractor in respect of petroleum operations under the PSC shall be 50% flat in accordance with the PSC terms\" [A/3/85] Clause 15.3(b).l [A/l/29] Annex B Article III paragraph 2(d) [A/l/46] s.4(1) [E/8/145-146]\"Royalty Rates shall be as provided in the PSC\" [A/3/85] Clause 15.1 [A/l/29] s.5(1) [E/8/146]\"Computation and payment of estimated and final PPT is to be made in US dollars on the basis of the US dollar returns filed' [A/3/85] Annex B Article III paragraph 2(e) [A/l/46] s.6 [E/8//146]\n\nThe PSC sets out how the lifting and sharing of Available Crude Oil is formally summarized. The relevant provisions are described below.\n\n(i) Each month, the Contractor completes a \"monthly accounting analysis\", also known as a \"Schedule B-l\": \"Annex B, Article IV paragraph 1. Schedule B-1 records details of the past month’s lifting of Available Crude Oil, and how the proceeds of that lifting have been allocated, as a matter of accounting, as between the different financial categories of Available Crude Oil. This allocation is done on the basis of contractual entitlement, and does not correspond to the amounts of proceeds that each Party has actually received (because the proceeds of sale generated by any given lifting can only be physically received by the lifting Party).\n\n(ii) Annex B Article IV paragraph 1 states that the Schedule B-ls are to be \"furnished to CORPORATION... for consideration and approval\". The purpose of this provision is to enable NNPC to confirm that its own records regarding details of the past month’s lifting (lifting date, number of barrels lifted, etc.) accord with those of the Contractor.\n\n(iii) Following the end of each quarter, the contractor uses the information recorded in the three Schedule B-ls for the quarter to prepare an \"Actual Quarterly Liftings Allocation\", also known as a \"Schedule C-2\": Annex C Article IV paragraph 1. Schedule C2 records the total amounts of proceeds allocated (as a matter of accounting) to each of Royalty Oil, Cost Oil, Tax Oil and Profit Oil (being the amounts of proceeds that each party was contractually entitled to receive during the past quarter), and compares these allocated amounts with the total amounts of proceeds physically received by each of the Parties during the quarter. The difference between the allocated amounts and the amounts actually received is then recorded as the \"Proceeds Imbalance\" for the past quarter.\n\n(iv) Proceeds Imbalance is defined in Annex C Article II paragraph 1 (f) as \"the difference between each Party’s Proceeds to which it is entitled and the Proceeds which each Party has actually received, as reflected in each quarter’s Schedule C-2 of this Procedure\". There will always be a Proceeds Imbalance, because the number of barrels lifted will never generate the precise amounts of proceeds needed to match precisely the allocation of (for example) Cost Oil for the relevant month/quarter. However, as explained below, the purpose of the estimated Lifting Allocation\" procedure is to keep the Proceeds Imbalance as close to zero as possible.\n\n(v) Annex C, Article IV, paragraph 1 provides for the historical information contained in the Schedule C-2 to be \"agreed to by the CORPORATION\".\n\n(vi) Pursuant to Annex C Article IV paragraph 3, on a quarterly basis the Contractor notifies NNPC of the \"estimated Lifting Allocation\" which can be produced and made available for lifting during the \"Forecast Quarter\" (being the calendar quarter immediately following the Current Quarter). Unlike the actual, historical information contained in the Schedule B-ls and Schedule C-2s, this notification is forward-looking.\n\n(vii) The significance of the estimated Lifting Allocation is that, pursuant to Annex C Article II paragraph 4, neither Party may \"nominate\" to lift more oil than under the estimated Lifting Allocation notified by the Contractor\"\n\n\"each Party shall notify the other of its Primary Nomination of Available Crude Oil which it intends to lift during the Forecast Quarter which shall not exceed its estimated Lifting Allocation.\"\n\n(viii) Lifting Allocation is defined in Annex C, Article II, paragraph 1 (c), and it \"means the quantity of Available Crude Oil which each Party has the right to take in kind, lift and dispose of in accordance with Clause 9 of the Contract\".\n\n(ix) Unlike the historical monthly accounting analyses (Schedule B-l) and actual quarterly lifting allocations (Schedule C-2), the Contractor’s notifications of the estimated Lifting Allocation are not subject to any form of approval from NNPC.\n\n(x) The agreed form of notification is Schedule C-l. In practice, as explained in Okutu/29 [D/3/39], the course of conduct between the Parties has been that the Contractor’s notifications of each Party’s estimated Lifting Allocation is made via (1) the Contractor’s \"lifting programme\" letters circulated each month, (2) the Contractor’s presentations at the monthly \"curtailment meetings\", and (3) the Contractor’s presentations at the \"cost recovery and oil entitlements meetings\", rather than by the circulation of Schedule C-ls.\n\n(xi) The Estimated Lifting Allocation involves \"the actual Proceeds Imbalance computed for the first preceding quarter\" (as referred to in Annex C Article IV paragraph 2) and the \"estimated Proceeds Imbalance for the Current Quarter\" (as referred to in Annex C Article IV paragraph 3. As the PSC makes clear, the Proceeds Imbalance (both actual and estimated) is of critical importance, because it must be taken into account in the \"estimated Lifting Allocations\", in such a way as to ensure that the Proceeds Imbalance is kept as close to zero as possible. Thus, Annex C Article III paragraph 3 provides for:\n\n\"Such estimated Lifting Allocation shall take into account any Proceeds Imbalance for the quarter first preceding the Current Quarter and any estimated Proceeds Imbalance for the Current Quarter\"\n\nThe Tribunal now considers the Respondent’s submission based on Section 251(1) of the Constitution of Nigeria. This provides as follows:\n\n\"(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an Act of the National Assembly, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other court in civil causes and matters —\n\n(a) relating to the revenue of the Government of the Federation in which the said Government or any organ thereof or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the said Government is a party;\n\n(b) connected with or pertaining to the taxation of companies and other bodies established or carrying on business in Nigeria and all other persons subject to Federal taxation;\n\n(c) connected with or pertaining to customs and excise duties and export duties, including any claim by or against the Nigeria Customs Service or any member or officer thereof, arising from the performance of any duty imposed under any regulation relating to customs and excise duties and export duties;\n\n(d) connected with or pertaining to banking, banks, other financial institutions, including any action between one bank and another, any action by or against the Central Bank of Nigeria arising from banking, foreign exchange, coinage, legal tender, bills of exchange, letters of credit, promissory notes and other fiscal measures:\n\nProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to any dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual customer and their bank;\n\n(e) arising from the operation of the Companies and Allied Matters Act or any other enactment replacing the Act or regulating the operation of companies incorporated under the Companies and Allied Matters Act;\n\n(f) any Federal enactment relating to copyright, patent, designs, trademarks and passing-off industrial designs and merchandise marks, business names, commercial and industrial monopolies, combines and trusts, standards of goods and commodities and industrial standards;\n\n(g) any admiralty jurisdiction, including shipping and navigation on the River Niger or River Benue and their affluents and on such other inland waterway as may be designated by any enactment to be an international waterway, all Federal ports, (including the constitution and powers of the ports authorities for Federal ports) and carriage by sea;\n\n(h) diplomatic, consular and trade representation;\n\n(i) citizenship, naturalisation and aliens, deportation of persons who are not citizens of Nigeria, extradition, immigration into and emigration from Nigeria, passports and visas;\n\n(j) bankruptcy and insolvency;\n\n(k) aviation and safety of aircraft.\n\n(l) arms, ammunition and explosives;\n\n(m) drugs and poisons;\n\n(n) mines and minerals (including oil fields, oil mining, geological surveys and natural gas);\n\n(o) weights and measures;\n\n(p) the administration or the management and control of the Federal Government or any of its agencies;\n\n(q) subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the operation and interpretation of this Constitution in so far as it affects the Federal Government or any of its agencies;\n\n(r) any action or proceeding for a declaration or injunction affecting the validity of any executive or administrative action or decision by the Federal Government or any of its agencies; and\n\n(s) such other jurisdiction civil or criminal and whether to the exclusion of any other court or not as may be conferred upon it by an Act of the National Assembly:\n\nProvided that nothing in the provisions of paragraphs (p), (q) and (r) of this subsection shall prevent a person from seeking redress against the Federal Government or any of its agencies in an action for damages, injunction or specific performance where the action is based on any enactment, law or equity.\"\n\nThe Respondent’s main argument on non-arbitrability is expressed in its Post-Hearing Brief as follows:\n\n4.2...it is respectfully submitted that it is pointless to pretend that an arbitral award is effective and binding on the parties if it is not enforceable. In Nigeria, tax must be paid as determined by the FIRS, or ultimately by the national courts after a process that starts with the TAT. Therefore, if the FIRS assesses tax, recoverable under a PSC as Tax Oil, in the sum of, say, N100, and the tribunal finds and award that the tax, recoverable under the PSC as Tax Oil, is N20 then the FIRS’ right to collect the N100 (and that of the Federal Government to receive N100) is affected. As the FIRS may still insist that the oil to be lifted to pay the tax has to be sufficient to pay the N100 (assuming of course that the assessment is upheld after the appeal process), and not N20, any award directing that Tax Oil is N20 will not provide any effective resolution to the parties’ dispute. The tribunal has no power to make any award as to what the tax (and therefore Tax Oil) ought to be. The evidence before the Tribunal is that the FIRS assessment as to how the tax liability of the PSC Contract Area is to be computed differs from that preferred by the Claimants, and which the Claimants now urge the Tribunal to uphold as correct. However, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal should ensure that it does nothing to bring the institution of arbitration into disrepute by accepting jurisdiction in a matter that requires public, and not private, adjudication. The manner in which PSC tax is computed is not a private matter of concern only to the parties in this arbitration. The Tribunal has received evidence that there are a number of PSCs in existence in Nigeria, involving numerous other parties. None of such other parties would be bound to follow and accept the decision of the Tribunal as to how tax is to be computed and assessed. Only the process that commences with the TAT is capable of doing this. For this, and other reasons that follow, the Tribunal should decline to adjudicate.\n\n4.3 As already submitted above, an award of the Tribunal cannot effectively resolve the disputes between the parties. The FIRS position runs counter to that of the Claimants. The FIRS is under no obligation to accept any award made by the Tribunal, and therefore does not have to accept any interpretation of the statutes that the Tribunal might make, whether for the Claimants or for the Respondent.\n\n4.4 As is clear from the example given above, a mismatch between an award of the Tribunal and the position taken, or to be taken, by the FIRS would make any award of the Tribunal ineffective, in reality. It has to be remembered that the amount of tax due, and therefore, the amount of Tax Oil to be lifted is the product of the application of statutes, and not simply of contractual provisions. The result of the process is a public liability and not simply a private contractual obligation. Statutory provisions such as those in contemplation in this case cannot, therefore, be the preserve of a private tribunal. The provisions must be adjudicated upon in a public forum, commencing with proceedings before the TAT.\n\nThe system established by Section 33 and Section 45 of the PTA is as follows:\n\n(a) Not later than two months after the commencement of each accounting period, returns of \"estimated tax for such accounting period\" must be filed. If and when the revisions are made, a further return setting out the \"revised estimated tax for such period\" must be filed. (See Section 33 of the PPTA).\n\n(b) PPT is payable \"in equal monthly instalments\", by reference to the above returns of estimated tax. (See Section 45 of the PPTA, which cross-references Section 33).\n\n(c) Under Section 45 of the PPTA, the first monthly instalment of PPT:\n\n(i) is due and payable not later than the third month of the accounting period; and\n\n(ii) is to be in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the amount of PPT estimated to be chargeable for the accounting perio d.\n\n(d) Each of the remaining monthly instalments of PPT:\n\n(i) is due and payable not later than the last day of the relevant month; and\n\n(ii) is to be in an amount equal to the amount of PPT estimated to be chargeable for the accounting period by reference to the last returns of estimated tax submitted in accordance with Section 33, less so much as has already been paid for such accounting period, divided by the number of such monthly payments remaining to be made in respect to such account period.\n\n(e) Within five months of the end of each account period, final PPT returns for the past accounting period are to be filed. (See Section 30(2) of the PPTA).\n\n(f) If, following the filing of the final PPT returns, the amount of PPT paid during the course of the relevant accounting period (on the basis of the estimation system describe above) falls short of the final amount ultimately assessed by the FIRS, then a \"thirteenth instalment\" is payable. See Section 45(4) of the PPTA.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal make an award declaring and ordering that, under the PSC:\n\n(a) The Corporation is not entitled to nominate and is not entitled to lift Available Crude Oil in excess of the quantities of Available Crude Oil allocated to the Corporation by the Contractor from time to time;\n\n(b) the Contractor is entitled to allocate to itself and lift as Cost Oil from OPL 316 and an OML derived therefrom (Including OML 125) such quantum of Available Crude Oil as will generate an amount of Proceeds sufficient fro recovery of Operating Costs incurred in OPL 211 and any OML derived therefrom (including OLM 134), as well as for recovery of Operating Costs incurred in OPL 316 and any OML derived therefrom (including OML 125);\n\n(c) the Contractor is entitled to amortise, and to allocate to itself and lift as Cost Oil such quantum of Available Crude Oil as enables the Contractor to recover Capital Costs in equal annual instalments over a five-year period;\n\n(d) the Contractor is entitled to:\n\n(i) compute the PPT (if any) payable;\n\n(ii) prepare and submit to the Corporation PPT returns, which PPT returns the Corporation is obliged to file with the FIRS; and\n\n(iii) allocate and lift Available Crude Oil, on the basis\n\n-1- of the consolidation for PPT purposes of OPLs 316 and 211 and any OMLs derived therefrom;\n\n-2- that ITC is to be deducted only from assessable tax, and not also from the cost of capital assets;\n\n-3- that the \"actual PPT liability payable during each month\" is an amount equal to one-twelfth of the amount of PPT estimated to be chargeable for the accounting period;\n\n-4- that the amount referred to in \"3\" above reflects one-twelfth of the amount of the capital allowances estimated to be due for the accounting period, and on the basis that a full year’s capital allowance (at the applicable rate set out in Table II of t\n\n-5- that the total sum of the Signature Bonuses paid under the 316 PSC and the 211 PSC (which, asset out above, the Contractor is entitled to consolidate for PPT purposes) is subject to capital allowances under the Second Schedule of the PPT Act;\n\n-6- that the interest on the loan entered into by NAE for the sole purpose of financing operations in the Abo field is deductible in computing the amount of profits subject to PPT; and\n\n-7- that the non-operator costs that the Contractor deducts (as having been incurred \"wholly, exclusively and necessarily\" for the purposes of OPL 316 and/or OPL 211) in computing the amount of profits subject to PPT are properly deductible.\n\nBased on the Tribunal’s conclusions as to liability, the Tribunal hereby awards as follows:\n\n(1) The Respondent has breached the PSC by purporting to nominate, lift, receive and retain the proceeds of the sale of, quantities of available Crude Oil which the Claimants had allocated to themselves and nominated in accordance with the PSC and which Claimants were, accordingly, entitled to lift.\n\n(2) Under the PSC:\n\n(i) The Respondent is not entitled to nominate, and is not entitled to lift Available Crude Oil in excess of the quantities of Available Crude Oil allocated from time to time to the Respondent by the Claimants.\n\n(ii) The Claimants are entitled to allocate to themselves and to lift as Cost Oil from OPL 316 and any OML(s) derived therefrom (including OML 125) such quantum of Available Crude Oil as will generate an amount of Proceeds sufficient for recovery of Operating Costs incurred in OPL 211 and any OML(s) derived therefrom (including OML 134), as well as for recovery of Operating Costs incurred in OPL 316 and any OML(s) derived therefrom (including OML 125).\n\n(iii) The Claimants are entitled to allocate to themselves and to lift as Cost Oil from OPL 316 and any OML(s) derived therefrom (include OML '125) such quantum of Available Crude Oil as enables the Claimants to recover Capital Costs in five equal instalments over five consecutive accounting periods, without any pro-rating of instalments.\n\n(iv) The Claimants are entitled to (a) compute the PPT (if any) payable, (b) prepare and submit to the Respondent PPT returns (which PPT returns the Respondent is obliged to file with the FIRS), and (c) allocate and lift Available Crude Oil on the basis:\n\n(a) that the Claimants are entitled to consolidate for PPT purposes OPL 316 and OPL 211 and any OML(s) derived therefrom (including OML 125 and OML 134);\n\n(b) that ITC is to be deducted only from assessable tax, and is not to be deducted from the cost of capital assets, nor from \"qualifying expenditure\" (as that term is defined in the Second Schedule of the PPT Act);\n\n(c) that the \"actual PPT liability payable during each month\" is determined (in accordance with Section 33 and Section 45 of the PPTA) on the basis of one-twelfth of the amount of PPT estimated to be chargeable for the accounting period;\n\n(d) that the \"actual PPT liability payable during each month\" reflects one-twelfth of the amount of the capital allowances estimated to be due for the accounting period, and reflects the fact that a full accounting period’s capital allowance (at the applicable rate set out in Table II of the Second Schedule to the PPTA) is available for the accounting period in which an asset which is \"qualifying expenditure\" (as that term is defined in the Second Schedule of the PPTA) is acquired or first used, regardless of when in that accounting period the asset was acquired or first used, without any pro-rating; and\n\n(e) that the total sum of the Signature Bonuses paid under the PSC and the 211 PSC (which, as set out above, the Claimants are entitled to consolidate for PPT purposes) attracts capital allowances under the Second Schedule of the PPT Act.\n\n(f) that, for the remainder of the term of the PSC, the Respondent (whether acting by itself, its privies, agents, sub-contractors, or any person claiming through or under it):\n\n(v) shall not nominate and shall not lift any Available Crude Oil in excess of the Claimants’ allocations to the Respondent of Available Crude Oil; and shall not in any way impede the Claimants’ allocations, nominations and liftings of Available Crude Oil;\n\n(vi) shall not file with FIRS any PPT returns (whether estimated or final) in respect of the PSC, other than the PPT returns prepared and submitted from time to time to the Respondent by the Claimants;\n\n(vii) shall not pay as PPT any sums in excess of the amount of Proceeds generated from the lifting of Available Crude Oil which is, from time to time, allocated to the Respondent by the Claimants as Tax Oil;\n\n(viii) shall file with FIRS any and all PPT returns (whether estimated or final) which the Claimants have submitted to the Respondent for onward filing with FIRS but which the Respondent has, prior to the date of the Tribunal’s Award, failed to file with FIRS; and\n\n(ix) shall make available to the Claimants copies of receipts issued by FIRS, bearing the names of each Party, for all payments made (including past payments) for PPT.\n\n(x) The PPT returns which the Respondent has itself prepared and filed with FIRS (instead of, or in addition to, the PPT returns prepared by the Claimants and submitted to the Respondent for onward filing with FIRS) are contrary to the PSC in that they do not reflect Claimants’ entitlement to compute the PPT (if any) payable on the basis of the points set out above.\n\n(3) Claimants’ claims for interest on loans and non-operator costs are denied."
