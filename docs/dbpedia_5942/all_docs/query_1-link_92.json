        "text": "By Michael Effiong\n\nIn his essay “The Talented Tenth,” W.E.B. Du Bois wrote, “The Negro race, like all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men.” Alhaji Aliko Dangote is exactly the type of exceptional Africans Du Bois had in mind.\n\nFrom small beginnings, he has built a business empire and a brand that has put him among the richest and the most influential businessmen on the continent and in fact, planet earth.\n\nFor those who meet Dangote for the first time, his polite, soft-spoken demeanor is impossible to forget. But don’t be mistaken, this cool mien belies his inner toughness.\n\nThe kind of toughness, vision, passion and determination that will propel anyone to success against all odds. The kind of toughness that will make you want to thread where others dread; the kind of toughness that will make you believe that you can make impossible possible; the kind of toughness that will make you dream up a gargantuan project like the Dangote Refinery & Petrochemical, a project that his fellow billionaire and businessman, Mr. Femi Otedola has christened, THE DANGOTE WONDERLAND.\n\nIndeed, that project tucked inside the Lekki Area in the outskirts of Lagos is a wonder to behold. Pictures do not do justice to this mega project; it is the kind of project that you have to see to appreciate its true worth and magnificence.\n\nThose who have been to the site after being wowed by its sheer size, and of course the audacity and ambition of its designers could not help but soliloquize about the visionary Aliko Dangote, “What was he thinking?’\n\nHe alone knew where he was going when a few days after his 56th birthday in April, 2013 he told the world about his dream of building a refinery in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the Dangote Petroleum Refinery will be the largest single train petroleum refinery in the world with a capacity to refine 650,000 barrels of crude daily and employ thousands of Nigerians directly and indirectly.\n\nLocated in the Lekki Free Trade Zone, in Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos State, the facility covers a land area of approximately 2,635 hectares which is six times the size of the famous Victoria Island.\n\nRevealing why he chose Lagos State for the project, the Forbes-listed billionaire noted that Lagos was investment friendly and the Governor was very willing to help resolve all issues.\n\nEvery one knows that to finance this kind of project was not going to be easy, but Dangote’s track record of business excellence did the magic.\n\nThis much was revealed along with the financing model at the signing ceremony of the first tranche of loan secured for the Refinery. This was a $3.3 billion term loan facility supported by a consortium of 12 local and international banks. The loan facility was jointly coordinated by Standard Chartered Bank as the Global Coordinator, and Guaranty Trust Bank Plc as the Local Coordinator.\n\nAt the ceremony, President/Chief Executive of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote said: “This plant will further entrench Africa’s role on the global map as not only a valued contributor for natural resources, but also a competent manufacturer of refined products and fertilizer. As a result, several African nations will be less reliant on importing fuel and fertilizer from foreign markets, reducing the negative impact of negotiating terms within increasingly turbulent international markets.”\n\n“We will end up spending between $12 billion to $14 billion. The funding is going to come through equity, commercial bank loans, export credit agencies and developmental banks,” Dangote noted.\n\nHe added “We have done the numbers and we are sure of numbers. This is a project that will redefine the sector”\n\nAlso speaking, CEO of Standard Chartered Bank in Nigeria, Ms. Bola Adesola, added: “Standard Chartered is proud to support the Dangote Group in a project which will significantly boost Nigeria’s economic productivity and create valuable jobs with specialist skills from key growth sectors. This project is an historic example of self-empowerment and leadership for the continent as a whole – and is made possible through effective partnerships between the Nigerian private sector, Government and international financial institutions. Standard Chartered remains committed to being here for good in Nigeria, and the region.”\n\nAnd for Mr. Segun Agbaje, Managing Director of Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, “This landmark project reinforces Dangote’s commitment to the development of the Nigerian economy. We are proud to be associated with Dangote on this transaction and this demonstrates the bank’s commitment to supporting the development of the agriculture and oil and gas industries.”\n\nThat was not all, Dangote also signed a loan of $650 million from the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), $300 million loan from the African Development Bank and $997.4 million in training grant from the United States Trade and Development Agency for 100 of its staff.\n\nWith the funds to kick off in place, Dangote then had to seek partners that will help the dream become a reality.\n\nAccording to a report by Businessday, India state-owned firm, Engineers India Limited was contracted to provide project management consultancy (PMC) services, as well as engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) for the Nigerian refinery, US-based Honeywell UOP was contracted for the supply of catalyst regeneration and dryer regeneration control systems, column trays, heat exchanger tubes, a modular CCR unit, and catalyst coolers among other equipment, C&I Leasing was contracted to provide transportation and installation services for mooring systems and subsea pipelines of the refinery, Hang Xiao Steel Structure Company is to provide steel structure and Jan De Nul Group was engaged for carrying out land reclamation works.\n\nFurthermore, MAN Diesel & Turbo was contracted for supplying two compressor trains, Air Liquide Engineering & Construction was contracted for supplying the SMR units.\n\nFabtech (18 columns), Schneider Electric (process automation systems), SOFEC (Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring buoys), and WABAG (raw water treatment plant) and Still Earth Construction were also part of the contractors on the project.\n\nThus, work began in earnest and so when the Publisher of The Boss, Dele Momodu, Billionaire businessman, Femi Otedola visited the Refinery just last week, they were astounded at the amount of work that had been done.\n\nThe Dangote Petroleum Refinery has the capacity to meet 100% of the Nigerian requirement of all refined products (Gasoline, 57 million litres per day; Diesel, 27 litres per day; Kerosene, 11 million litres per day and Aviation Jet, 9 million litres per day) and also have surplus of each of these products for export.\n\nThe 400 MW Power Plant in the Refinery alone will be able to meet the total power requirement of Ibadan DisCo of 860,316 MWh covering five States including Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Kwara and Ekiti. A Captive Power plant comprising three Steam Turbine Generators of 40 MW capacity each, making a Total of 120 MW is also part of the package.\n\nIn addition, the Refinery will create market for $11 billion per annum of Nigerian Crude. Interestingly, the facility is designed for 100% Nigerian Crude with flexibility to process other crudes. Of course, its strategically located marine infrastructure for Crude receipts & product trade is an added advantage.\n\nAlso part of this humongous project is the Dangote Fertilizer Plant which will have two of the World’s Largest Fertilizer Trains – Three Million Tonnes per Annum capacity at 1.5m per train. It is bigger than the 1.4 million tonnes per annum of the former champion, Indorama Fertilizer Limited.\n\nThe Fertilizer Project is the largest Granulated Urea Fertilizer complex coming up in the entire fertilizer industry history in the world, with an investment of $2 Billion (Two billion US Dollars).\n\nThe complex consists of Ammonia and Urea plants, with associated facilities and infrastructure to produce 3 MMTPA Urea, the complex envisages:\n\n• 2 x 2,200 MTPD Ammonia Plants based on Halder Topsoe technology\n\n• 2 x 4,000 MTPD Melt Urea Plants based on Snamprogetti technology\n\n• 2 x 4,000 MTPD Urea Granulation Plants based on Uhde Technology\n\nThe Fertilizer from this plant will be channeled into growing the local agriculture sector which is essential in producing healthy crops and promoting Nigeria and West Africa’s agricultural development. The Petrochemical plant will also produce Polypropylene which is a common component of most plastic and fabric products.\n\nWe are told that the the first products from this fertilizer facility will be ready for the market by the end of this February and as a matter of fact, distributors have already been assembled and they are set for action.\n\nIn other to ensure that this facility is first-rate, the company has deployed the most advanced technology and bench marks itself with the best standards in the world.\n\nWe gathered that in very aspect of the project, Dangote and his team have not settled for anything but the very best.\n\nFor example, Dangote Refinery has the biggest single-train facility used for refining crude. The atmospheric equipment which was manufactured by Sinopec company in China, is the primary unit processor of crude oil into fuels.\n\nCapt Rajen Sacher, Head, Maritime and Ports Infrastructure of Dangote said the equipment weighs 2250MT; Length, 112.5m; Width, 14.036m; and Height, 13.752m. The above-mentioned weight does not include the weight of the internal trays which is approx. 536 MT.”\n\nHe said that the crude oil processor took 14 months in construction by Sinopec company in China and eight weeks to be brought down to Nigeria.\n\n“Dangote refinery also invested heavily in dredging the sea from the refinery to Apapa for easy passage of the vessel,” he said. The piece of equipment which has the length of a soccer field, has the weight of 320 large elephants.\n\nIt was because of this and other heavy duty equipment called Out of Dimension that the company had to construct a special jetty which has made its work easier.\n\nTalking of construction of its structures, the concrete for piling, residual catalytic cracking sub-structure, pavement plant areas, building in plant and non-plant areas and roads and drains have been carefully crafted to ensure maximum fortification.\n\nIt currently has the largest ready mix concrete production facility in the world. At thickness of 9 inches, 16 metres wide, the concrete required for the Refinery project is enough to pave the entire Federal Roads in Lagos (720KM).\n\nIn terms of providing employment, the Dangote Refinery has employed over 10,000 Nigerian personnel on site, with employment by the various contractors and subcontractors at the site reaching 7,500. The current ratio of Nigerians to Expatriates is 93% Nigerians to 7% Expats.\n\nApart from creating employment, Dangote, we gathered, is also passionate about technology transfer to Nigerians.\n\nIn this regard, a total of 900 Nigerian Engineers are being trained in design, engineering and design of the refinery. There are currently other Engineers currently under-going training.\n\nFurthermore, the company recently completed the training of 200 artisans selected from the host communities in the areas of Masonry, Carpentry, AC Electricians, Plumbing, Welders, Iron-benders and Auto Mechanics. This was achieved in collaboration with the Nigerian Directorate of Employment and Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board. (This is one of Dangote Refinery’s Corporate Social Responsibility programmes within the host communities). Batch B of trainees are currently undergoing training and will soon graduate.\n\nWithout any shadow of doubt, Dangote Refinery was built with the future in mind and that is why as part of the project a residential facility to accommodate its staff was being constructed.\n\nSo far, accommodation for over 30,000 workers is ready as well those for 2,000 Managers. In addition, site offices, warehouses and lay-down areas have been completed.\n\nThis forward-thinking policy of Dangote Group helped the company in no small measure during the COVID-19 lockdown of last year. Because it had these accommodation facilities in place, it was able to safely monitor and house many of its staff which ensured that the disruption to its operations was minimal.\n\nWithout any shadow of doubt, the Refinery Project will definitely have tremendous benefit to the country.\n\nThe benefits include: Technology transfer, employment, power generation, professional development, production of petrochemicals, increased demand for domestic crude. unhindered availability of the product, development of local area and ancillary industries, availability of high quality products (Euro V Grade), annual Foreign Exchange earnings from exports of USD 5.5 billion and annual Foreign Exchange Saving from import substitution of USD 7.5 billion.\n\nAs a responsible corporate organisation, the company, we gathered, is committed to holistic development of its host communities and local institutions, as such it has executed comprehensive and robust community development initiatives in partnership with host communities.\n\nSome of these initiatives are also designed to mitigate project impact on these communities whilst also improving its own operational efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, it instituted a well thought out Grievance Management Process (GMP) to ensure that all project related grievances from host communities or stakeholders are effectively addressed. The GMP was communicated to communities during stakeholder engagement using local language to aid understanding.\n\nSome of these notable initiatives include:\n\nWater, Sanitation & Hygiene(WASH) Initiative – Under this scheme, the Project has provided 14 functional boreholes to its host communities. It has also gone one step further by undertaking quarterly lab tests to check for water portability.\n\nThere is also the Farmers Livelihood Support Programme: Dangote Fertiliser is currently implementing a livelihood support programme for farmers and Project Affected Persons(PAPs) impacted by the 53km gas pipeline constructed for the Fertiliser Project.\n\nThe programme which targets 150 beneficiaries aims at building capacities of farmers in innovative farming techniques, distributing adapted cassava stem cells and providing technical support to farmers to ensure proper planting practices which ultimately results in increased farming yields. It will also build capacities of local entrepreneurs on SME management and the income generating potentials of cassava by-products.\n\nDangote has also embarked on an initiative to provide further support to improving educational systems in Ibeju-Lekki and Epe locality. The educational support initiative is a tripartite programme consisting of scholarship, capacity building for teachers and school infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition, Scholarship was awarded to 52 secondary school students whilst some financial support was provided to their parents and or guardians. Tertiary students will be included in the next batch of the scheme.\n\nFurthermore, about 100 teachers, principals and school administrators were trained in teaching techniques for the 21st century. After which they were monitored in class on how they were using the skills acquired.\n\nStill on education, the company plans to renovate existing structures, building new schools, donating school furniture and equipment etc. This component of the education support initiative will take off this year.\n\nAlready, it has constructed a block of 6 classrooms with restroom facilities and staff rooms. This was handed over at a formal ceremony in December 2020.\n\nYouth development was also an area it took seriously. 400 local youths have been trained in two batches of 200 beneficiaries per batch. They are being trained on acquiring vocational skills such as plumbing, masonry, welding, iron bending, auto mechanics and electrical works. First batch of trainees graduated in September 2020 and some of them have been engaged; 2nd batch of trainees will graduate in February 2021.\n\nIt also organized programmes to build the capacity of local institutions such as the Community Development Committee (CDC), Project Implementation Committee(PIC), local leaders, youth leaders etc. on various subject areas such as stakeholder engagement, advocacy, networking, conflict resolution and negotiation, presentation skills, influx and impact of influx etc.\n\nOn a biannual basis, the Managers of the Dangote facility undertakes a project disclosure meeting to inform the communities on project status, impacts and impact mitigation strategies. Input are also sought from community stakeholders at these meetings and this information is integrated into the mitigation strategy.\n\nApart from the recent visit of Otedola and Momodu, many prominent Nigerians who recognize the great potential of this gigantic project have also paid a visit to the site.\n\nWhen he was taken on tour of the facility, Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo described the Project as ambitious and intimidating.\n\nHe was not alone, the Governor of Central Bank, Mr. Godwin Emefiele also toured the facility and was very impressed. He noted that Dangote facility will employ over 70, 000 Nigerians when it starts operation and will also save the country foreign exchange.\n\nAn elated Alhaji Dangote noted at the occasion that his company “will be one of the highest foreign exchange generating companies, going forward”. Adding ”I must really confess that without government support, there is no way we could have done what we have done so far”\n\nFrom all indications, this project is certainly going to add zest as well as stimulate the Nigerian economywhen it comes fully on stream.\n\nBy Eric Elezuo\n\nIn the recent times, the Nigerian space has been very volatile as anger occasioned by extreme hunger, continue to ravage the land. This situation has led to a massive protest against the less than 15-months-old President Bola Tinubu-led administration in states across the nation, especially in the Northwest and Northeast corridors of the regions.\n\nThemed #EndBadGovernanceInNigeria, the protests have been described as the consequence of a bottled up anger, which has engulfed Nigerians, from the extreme hardship that resulted with the pronouncement of Tinubu’s “Subsidy is gone” address on May 29, 2023.\n\nWith various manifestations of theories being propounded as the reasons for the consequential crises, most elites have said the a new constitution that will address the basic structure of the Peoples of Nigeria is urgently needed to assurge the desires of thr people, others have opined that at a time like this, all Nigerians are interested in is food for survival, and not constitution.\n\n“Yes, we need a new constitution to address a lot of lopsided issues in the Nigerian nation, but as it stands today, the most important to address is hunger and hardship that has reduced many families to beggars, and has also made even the hitherto well to do members of the society to relapse into oblivion,” a hardship protester said.\n\nAs at the moment, a N500 plate of food cannot quench a form of hunger in roadside cafeterias otherwise ‘mama put’. One has to cough out as much as 1500 to 2000 to be able to have a ‘decent’ roadside. The eateries are now no go areas to average salary earner.\n\nIn the same vein a moderate tuber of yam that can serve for one meal in a family of 3/4 persons cost about 5000 as against 1000/1500. A bag of rice sells at N85000 depending on the location. Tomatoes and other cooking ingredients are gradually going beyond the reach of the regular.\n\nTinubu has therefore, in a make or mar effort to redeem image, launched into unproductive distribution of palliative to both individuals and governments, all in a bid to attempt to curb the resultant hardship, which has been acknowledged by the government. The effort has painted the administration as a palliative government of Nigeria, that has no clear-cut agenda to give the people a good life.\n\nIt would be recalled that life took a dramatic turn for the worse for Nigerians on May 29, 2023 minutes after President Tinubu was sworn in. It all took three simple words to bring a world of gloom to the citizens, who were hoping for a positive change from the drab eight years of General Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. What Nigerians got was a clear distance from prosperity and survival. In between May 2023 and the present, the situation has remained unprecedented as high cost of living, loss of jobs and general disconnect from deep-rooted welfarism have become the order of the day. Nigerians have continued to tell a tale of woe, the Tinubu loyalists have continued to defend a very bad situation, albeit unsuccessfully.\n\nFrom the moment President Tinubu declared the unfamous subsidy is gone jargon, a drastic change occurred. And as if not deterred in the provision of antipeople policies, more policies and decisions that have further pushed citizens to the precipice were dished out including floating of the dollar, that has made naira a no use in the international money market, hike in elecrricity tarriff, and worse of all, the disappearance of operations of not a few multinational businesses.\n\n” alt=”” aria-hidden=”true” />Microsoft announced the shutting down of its development centre in Nigeria, just two years after the opening of the centre in Lagos. This development adversley affected Nigerians, many of whom were employees in the firms and others.\n\nIn 2023, GlaxoSmithKline, Nigeria’s second-biggest drug producer, unceremoniously left the country after 51 years of operation. The British pharmaceutical giant said its prescription medicines and vaccines will only be sold in the country through third-party distributors. The same fate befell Unilever which shut down its home care and skin cleansing business. In the same 2023, another pharmaceutical multinational, Sanofi, left Nigeria.\n\nProcter & Gamble (P&G), the US consumer goods powerhouse, which has been operating in the country for 30 years and ran two manufacturing plants in Ibadan, Oyo State and Agbara, Ogun State, closed down business operations and switched to only importation activity, describing the Nigeria market as problematic for the corporation.\n\nOther companies that have called it quits with Nigeria since the advent of the Tinubu administration are Equinor Nigeria Energy Company (ENEC), a Norwegian energy corporation, which holds a 53.85 percent ownership in oil mining lease (OML) 128, including a 20.21 percent stake in the Agbami field, operated by Chevron. The company announced the sale of its Nigerian operations after three decades in the country’s energy market, including the company’s stake in Agbami oil field which were all sold to a Nigerian-owned firm, Chappal Energies.\n\nJumia Food and Bolt Foods also joined the long queue of companies that left Nigeria in December 2023. All blamed the rising and unstable foreign exchange rates and other unbearable government policies.\n\nBut the Tinubu government has continually told everyone that all was well, and the economy is on the right footing.\n\nIt is worth knowing that these aforementioned companies are known and in the limelight bwcause they are foreign companies. This is saying that in the alleged bad governance policies, private owned companies, the SMEs who could not even withstand the harsh inflation and cost of doing business have also packed up, as a direct consequence of the subsidy is gone pronouncement. These closures created wide gap of joblessness, unemployment and resultant hardship and hunger. This also heightened the spate of insecurity, thuggery, armed and petty robbery, kidnapping, banditry and outright terrorism.\n\nIt was not therefore, a surprise when out of the blues, a notice of 10-day long protest tagged #EndBadGovernance in Nigeria was initiated. The organizers, who were originally dismissed as faceless, outlined its demands including a reverse to previous electricity tariff regime, return of subsidy among other demands.\n\nThe Tinubu addressed any of the demands, but engaged in propaganda and threats using instrumentality of government, thugs, traditional institutions as in Lagos State, emergency groups and more. The protest however, held, and was successful in states, but failed in many other states, especially in the southeast.\n\nAfter the third day when it became violent in the north east and west regions, President Tinubu addressed the nation. But Nigerians across board described his broadcast as porous and failed to address the spirit of the protest, which was a demand for end of hunger and hardship. Tinubu asked for more time, reiterating that his policies are for the good of the nation, no matter how unbearable they are.\n\nHe said, “In the past 14 months, our government has made significant strides in rebuilding the foundation of our economy to carry us into a future of plenty and abundance. On the fiscal side, aggregate government revenues have more than doubled, hitting over 9.1 trillion Naira in the first half of 2024 compared to the first half of 2023 due to our efforts at blocking leakages, introducing automation, and mobilising funding creatively without additional burden on the people. Productivity is gradually increasing in the non-oil sector, reaching new levels and taking advantage of the opportunities in the current economic ambience.\n\n“My dear brothers and sisters, we have come this far. Coming from a place where our country spent 97% of all our revenue on debt service; we have been able to reduce that to 68% in the last 13 months. We have also cleared legitimate outstanding foreign exchange obligations of about $5billion without any adverse impact on our programmes.\n\n“This has given us more financial freedom and the room to spend more money on you, our citizens, to fund essential social services like education and healthcare. It has also led to our State, and Local Governments receiving the highest allocations ever in our country’s history from the Federation Account.”\n\nHowever, personalities like former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, Nobel Laureate, Wole Soyinka among others derided the speech as lacking in substance, and failed to address the issue of hunger, which is the major reason for the protest.\n\nAccording to Soyinka, the president also failed to mentioned the extrajudicial killings of some protesters by security agencies during the uprising.\n\n“His outline of the government’s remedial action since inception, aimed at warding off just such an outbreak, will undoubtedly receive expert and sustained attention both for effectiveness and in content analysis. My primary concern, quite predictably, is the continuing deterioration of the state’s seizure of protest management, an area in which the presidential address fell conspicuously short,” Soyinka said.\n\nIn his response former VP Atiku said, “His speech neglects the pressing economic hardships that have besieged Nigerian families since the very beginning of his tenure.\n\n“This address lacks credibility and fails to offer any immediate, tangible solutions to the Nigerian people. Given the extensive publicity surrounding the protests and the threats issued by government officials against demonstrators, one would have expected President Tinubu to present groundbreaking reforms, particularly those aimed at reducing the exorbitant costs of governance.\n\n“But alas, no such announcements were made. The President ignored the protesters’ demands, such as suspending the purchase of aircraft for the President, downsizing his bloated cabinet, or even eliminating the costly and burdensome office of the First Lady, who has been indulging in extravagant trips at the nation’s expense.”\n\nOther than Tinubu’s apologists, loyalists and direct beneficiaries of his government, the entire nation is constantly voicing the fact that food is in dire need before families begin to slump in mid motion as a result of inherent and uncontrolled hunger.\n\nIt is not known the direction any other protest will take in the near future, but the truth remains that the government of Tinubu must rise to the occasion, and remedy an already messed up situation so that Nigerians can heave a little sigh of relief in the buildup to returning to economic statusquo before a new direction is carved.\n\nBut notable Nigerians like veteran journalists, Chief Dele Momodu, has said there is no hope of recovery for the economy if Tinubu continues in the direction he is going.\n\nIn an article titled, “A Nation in Pain,” where he insisted that only a miracle can avert what awaits the country, Momodu said, “Let those who still care plead with these people to have mercy on Nigeria. No matter how long Tinubu spends, he will fail spectacularly and sink Nigeria, unless he can drastically reduce the insensitivity and the ongoing jamborees in his government. Sadly, he doesn’t seem inclined that way.”\n\nIt’s obvious that time is ticking on Tinubu as a result of the non-availability of food, what may not be obvious is the trend of the next protest.\n\nYes, a new constitution is good to address lopsided affairs, but availability of food is the most important thing at the moment because citizens have to be alive to put together a new constitution.\n\nBy Eric Elezuo\n\nFollowing the war of words, or as Chief Dele Momodu puts it, the cold war going on currently between Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote and his refinery on one hand, and the Federal Government of Nigeria on the other hand, regarding alleged sabotage and frustration in the supply of crude oil and legitimacy, another Nigerian businessman in the oil sector, Chief Tony Chinyere, has spoken up again, calling out the government of Nigeria of deliberately seeking the downfall of Dangote Refinery on the same way they ruined his refinery in Sierra Leone many years ago.\n\nChief Chinyere, the Chairman of Cross Oceans West Africa Limited, who is regarded as the richest foreigner in the West African country told The Boss in an exclusive conversation that the government of Nigeria, presently led by Bola Tinubu, is on the verge of frustrating and ruining Dangote and his refinery in the same manner the frustrated him out of business many years ago, and covered it up with executive fiat.\n\nChinyere is also the Chairman of Nigerian Community, and President of Nigerian Union in Sierra Leone. According to him, “I’m everything for Nigeria in Sierra Leone”, and that gave him the leverage to front for Nigeria in Sierra Leone’s internal affairs.\n\nHe said: “What is happening to Dangote is exactly the same thing the Federal Government did to me here in Sierra Leone. What’s happening to him is what they came and did to me in Sierra Leone, destroyed my business and my refinery. The same people; Tinubu, Oando, NNPC joined hands to destroy my refinery, saying they were pursuing Abacha, when Abacha has no share here.\n\n“So, We cannot run Nigeria this way. We have to remind them that the same thing happened to me. The federal government did it, and they sent delegation, which confirmed that they were wrong. They promised to pay me, but till date, no one has paid me anything. I’ve written to Tinubu and everyone concerned but nothing. Nobody should treat anybody the way they have treated me.\n\n“They told me to stop going to arbitration, and I did, yet they did not pay me. It cannot continue to be like this,” Chinyere lamented to The Boss.\n\nWhile volunteering publications dating back 10 or more years in the past, Chinyere released documents that indicted the government of Nigeria of culpability in the whole episode to led to his losing his refinery, and by extension, a larger part of his business conglomerate.\n\nIn an article titled Battle over Abacha’s Refinery in Sierra Leone, and published in 2017 in thenewsnigeria.com, the following was presented in revelations bordering on the journey of legitimacy between Chinyere and Nigerian government:\n\n“Chief Tony Chinyere, Chairman of Cross Oceans West Africa Limited, who owns 18.07 per cent equity in West Africa Refinery Company, WARCO, otherwise called Abacha Refinrey has, for over a year been fighting alleged sharp practices by the Nigerian Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in the sale of the Federal Government’s holding in the refinery, the only such facility in Sierra Leone. Beyond dragging the parties to court of law in Sierra Leone, Chinyere had asked former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the late President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, at different times, to wade into the crisis. He had equally made concessionary offers to end the contentious matter, but the opposing party had different ideas, allegedly conniving with the BPE and Oando Plc and deploying underhand tactics to perpetuate its hold on the disputed company.\n\n“Genesis of the crisis\n\n“TheNEWS gathered that the WARCO saga began after Unipetrol, (now Oando Plc), on Chief Chinyere’s intervention and facilitation successfully bid for the liquidation of Sierra Leone Refinery Company for $1.2 million.\n\n“Chinyere stated that “WARCO was formed in 1995 after Unipetrol bid for the liquidated Sierra Leone Refinery. “After the bid, Cross Oceans, a company in which Chinyere had controlling shares, was subsequently offered 18.07 per cent of the total shares of WARCO valued at $388,000, which was fully paid for; and was, therefore, made a pioneer director of the company, alongside a representative of Unipetrol Nigeria (Oando).”\n\n“The Federal Government of Nigeria at the inception, had no stake in WARCO but got involved when it confiscated the shares of companies in the refinery traced to the late Head of State, General Sani Abacha. After taking over Abacha’s stocks and in line with its policy to divest shares from the refinery, the Federal Government instructed the Bureau of Public Enterprises to sell the shares. Oando also decided to sell its shares, opting to do so through the BPE and the stocks consolidated as 72.66 per cent with FG’s 48.44 per cent and Oando’s 24.22 per cent.\n\n“The Cross Oceans boss accused the officials of BPE and Oando of deliberately manipulating the bidding process, undervaluing the shares and selling to a front, Mr. Thorlu Bangura, a Sierra Leonean, owner of Majestic Oil. Conditions issued by the BPE, while inviting strategic investors for expression of interest, clearly precluded Majestic Oil, it was gathered. For instance, evidence of successful investment in and management of downstream oil and gas companies was a key qualifying demand which Majestic Oil could not have met. Official records in Sierra Leone available to TheNEWS indicated that the company was incorporated in 2002 and “remained inactive since incorporation.” It only roared to life in 2004 to emerge as BPE’s preferred bidder for the FG/Oando shares.\n\n“It was further gathered that the provision of WARCO’s Memorandum and Articles of Association,which allowed existing shareholders right of first offer in the event that any of the owners decided to sell his holding, was disregarded. A meeting was purported to have been held where those provisions were suspended. Chief Chinyere claimed not to have been invited to the meeting.\n\n“During the bidding process, Oando disclosed to the would-be bidders of the existence of a debenture loan granted WARCO to the tune of $602,272, which with accrued interest had risen to $922,229.04. The disclosure of the liability was meant to scare bidders to give opportunity to manipulate the process, the Cross Oceans chairman alleged. He buttressed his argument with the revelation that soon after the other bidders withdrew, Oando and BPE, without recourse to other shareholders, reduced the debenture loan to $308,809.45 without informing the other bidders.\n\n““As if that was not enough fraud, soon after the alleged sale (to Majestic Oil), they (Oando and BPE) met again without reference to shareholders and further reduced the debenture loan to $194,804.50,” Chinyere stated. According to him, the value of the consolidated shares of FG and Oando (72 per cent), which is $1,560,000 was surprisingly sold to Majestic Oil for a paltry $363,300. “The amount is below the $388,000 my company paid in 1995 for a mere 18.07 per cent shares,” the Cross Oceans boss lamented. “Could that be said to be a very transparent way of selling government shares and interest in a company?” he queried.\n\n“Cross Oceans headed for court\n\n“Apparently aggrieved by the developments, Cross Oceans headed for the law court in Sierra Leone and got an injunction against Majestic Oil. The Federal Government and Oando were the other defendants in the suit, challenging the sale of WARCO shares. The trial judge, A.B. Raschid, ordered officials, employees and agents of Majestic Oil to “vacate the offices and facility of the first defendant (WARCO).” The Judge further pronounced that Majestic Oil should not re-enter the premises and facility of WARCO at Kissy Dockyard in Freetown until the hearing of the application brought by council to Cross Oceans had been heard. Cross Oceans was also granted the right of access to WARCO to verify that Majestic Oil was complying with the injunctions.\n\n“Despite the court injunction, BPE and Oando were eager to hand over WARCO to Majestic Oil and at a meeting held in Freetown, they purportedly appointed Mr Thorlu Bangura and his relations as alternate directors to represent their interests in the company. “How can you explain a situation whereby shares held by a Nigerian in a foreign land, whose transfer was put on hold by a law court, was now consigned to a family whose members were never legally known to the BPE and Oando? This is the mother of all frauds being perpetrated by officials of a country that is supposedly fighting corruption,” Chief Chinyere lamented.\n\n“Sierra Leonean government’s intervention\n\n“Because of the strategic importance of WARCO to the Sierra Leonean economy, Attorney-General summoned a meeting of the contending parties in February 2005 and despite the count injunction in his favour, Chief Chinyere conceded to the brokered arrangement excluding both Cross Oceans and Majestic Oil from running the refinery. A committee comprising Sierra Leonean government agencies was set up to run the refinery until contrary instructions come from the court.\n\n“The Cross Oceans boss said he consented to the Sierra Leonean government’s arrangement for an independent body to oversee the refinery’s operation to avoid being blackmailed as being adamant and out to sabotage that country’s economy.\n\n“Majestic Oil has, with the connivance of Sierra Leonean government officials been allegedly circumventing the arrangement, operating WARCO and diverting its moneys into private accounts. Bangura, it was learnt, mockingly offered to buy out Cross Oceans from WARCO, offering $165,000 for the company’s 18.07 per cent holding bought for $388,000 in 1995.\n\n“This is contrary to Cross Oceans concessionary offer to refund $363,300 paid to BPE/Oando to Majestic Oil and in addition offer the company 10 per cent of the FG/Oando’s consolidated shares free of charge and make Mr. Thorlu Bangura chairman of WARCO. Alternatively, Chief Chinyere offered to be bought out for the sum of $500,000.\n\n“FG’s disturbing silence\n\n“Although it is believed that the mishandling of the WARCO shares sale led to the sack of former Director-General of BPE, Dr. J.J. Bala, the Federal Government’s intervention to redress the wrongs in the WARCO affair is yet to materialise. The Sierra Leonean Attorney General was said to have quoted his Nigerian counterpart as affirming that the Federal Government’s shares were sold to Majestic Oil and pleading that the matter be resolved to avoid embarrassing the Nigerian government in the on-going court action. The Sierra Leonean Attorney-General also urged Chinyere to seek redress in Nigeria as Majestic Oil was holding FG and Oando’s shares, threatening that he would advise his government to impose a decision and repossess the refinery.\n\n“The development appears to be assuming the status whereby Sierra Leone would protect one of her own against a foreigner, while Nigeria looks eager to sacrifice her own citizen in a deal made awry by government officials. The question about who wins at the close of this two-nation contest blows in the wind.\n\n“The matter was taken to the ECOWAS Court for adjudication. TheNEWS was reliably informed that the ECOWAS Court has referred the matter to the Nigerian Courts for further adjudication.”\n\nChinyere recalled with copious documents, some of which are on Federal government reports requesting that he be invited and compensated to the role he played for Nigeria and ECOMOG, and how ‘one thousand battalion of soldiers were released by the rebels’.\n\nHe added that “I negotiated for their release, and they wrote me that they were going to give an award, but till date, there’s no award.”\n\nFurther in his narrative, Chinyere called out the Bureau for Public Enterprise for their role in making it impossible for him to get what belongs to him.\n\nHe said: “How can BPE give me support when they took the role to act as informers against a Nigerian investor by giving information to a Sierra Leone company that has no track record about Oil Refinery and was recently registered, and has not even paid taxes to Sierra Leone Government, now became the winner of highly prepared tender by BPE. All that took place was inside dealing and suppling information about my business to Majestic Oil in Sierra Leone.\n\n“After admitting that they did things very wrong in their own report and recommended that I should be invited to be paid compensation up to date after winning all court cases in Sierra Leone, they still did not invite me to discuss my settlement while they agreed that after the release of their visit to Sierra Leone that they will act with honesty to settle this matter.\n\n“Now it’s the Government of Sierra Leone and other fake Nigerian business men that are enjoying the benefits of my investment while I’m left to suffer all humiliation.\n\n“This not good for our country that I have saved in many capacity even saving the life of 1,000 Nigerian soldiers that were captured by the rebels in Sierra Leone where the Embassy nominated me as president of Nigerian Union in Sierra Leone to go and release my brothers from the rebels, which I did and they asked me that I should use my helicopter to bring out the rebel leader from the bush which I did because the western Government failed to render such help to ECOMOG and Nigerian Government but I did again because I believe in my country Nigeria, and we are taught to be good ambassadors when we are in a foreign country.\n\n“The Nigerian government recommended that I should be honoured by our government, but up till now I did not even receive a thank you letter from our Government or any invitation for what I have been doing for our Government rather it’s the opposite to help other people to destroy all my business I worked hard to build.\n\n“I’m lost with words as I don’t know what to do anymore when everyone has condemned what BPE did even the man that BPE sold to his company in writing and all these are captured in the federal Government report written to the presidency for action to settle my payment.”\n\nChinyere has maintained that till present, his payment has not been initiated not to talk of completed.\n\n“The same gang fighting Dangote today is the same gang that destroyed my business in Sierra Leone,” Chinyere concluded.\n\nDocuments supplied by Chief Tony Chinyere"
