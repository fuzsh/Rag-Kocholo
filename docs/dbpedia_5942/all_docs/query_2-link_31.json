        "text": "At long last, Dangote refinery comes on stream More than a decade after the dream was disclosed, Dangote refinery went live on Friday. The long-awaited giant refinery has started producing diesel and aviation fuel. The announcement was made today by Dangote Group. ‚ÄúThis is a big day for Nigeria. This is a game changer for our country, and I am very fulfilled with the actualisation of this project,‚Äù Aliko Dangote, its founder, said. In April 2013, when Dangote disclosed his plan to build a refinery with a capacity of about 400,000 barrels per day, I was a budding energy reporter. For over eight years, I reported extensively on the project and visited several times the complex that houses the refinery as well as petrochemical and fertiliser plants. Dangote had set sights on the oil refining sector long before he announced plans to build a plant. His conglomerate was part of the consortium, Bluestar Oil Services Limited, that bought the 51 per cent stake in Port Harcourt and Kaduna refineries President Olusegun Obasanjo sold in the twilight of his tenure in 2007. But Obasanjo's successor, President Umaru Yar‚ÄôAdua, revoked the sale following public outcry, particularly from oil unions, which argued that the refineries were wrongly sold. Dangote had initially set a target of late 2016 for the completion of the 400,000bpd refinery he announced in 2013 that he wanted to build, according to Reuters. Five months later, the company announced the signing of a $3.3bn loan between it and a consortium of local and foreign banks, in addition to Dangote's equity contribution of $3.50bn. The location of the refinery, petrochemical and fertiliser complex was later changed to Lekki Free Trade Zone, Lagos from Olokola LNG Free Trade Zone in Ogun State. Dangote also announced in March 2015 that the refinery's capacity had been increased to 650,000bpd. ‚ÄúWe will finish the mechanical [part] by the end of 2019 if hopefully, we don‚Äôt have the same rain because of the raining season this year‚Ä¶\" Dangote told Bloomberg TV in November 2018. \"We will start production by the end of the first quarter of 2020.\" The company announced in December that year the arrival from China of the crude distillation column, which it said took 14 months to be constructed by Sinopec and eight weeks to bring to Nigeria. But the mechanical construction was not completed in 2019 as envisaged, and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic the following year threw a spanner in the works. In January 2022, Dangote said mechanical work had been completed, hoping to be in the market before the end of the third quarter. During the commissioning of the plant in May last year, Dangote said the first product would be in the market in July or August. But that did not materialise. A top executive of the company was quoted by S&P Global Platts as saying production would start in October. That target was missed too. At long last, it has come on stream! ‚Ä¢'Femi Asu, a business journo\n\nThe administration of President Obasanjo introduced the modular refinery initiative to ramp up the nation‚Äôs refining capacity and meet local demand and granted licenses to private investors to build modular refineries but none of them was successful. Also, President Jonathan granted licenses to private investors to build modular refineries to ease the local supply of petroleum products, especially household kerosene (HHK), which does not require sophisticated technology to produce. Unfortunately, none of them was successful except one (Aradel) When the Niger Delta Avengers (NDA) sabotaged Nigeria's oil infrastructure for months in bombings that forced oil production to drop from 2.2m barrels a day to 1.4m barrels a day because Buhari defeated Jonathan in the 2015 Presidential election between 2015 and 2016. Unfortunately, Nigeria hasn't recovered from the sabotage. In 2017, the administration of President Buhari use modular refinery initiative to drive rapid development in the Niger Delta to give hope to the people of the region and his administration was successful to leave behind five modular refineries apart from Dangote refinery despite that the Niger Delta militants sabotaged his government. 1. Niger Delta Petroleum Refinery (Aradel)‚Äì The initial 1,000 bbls/day AGO topping plant was commissioned in 2010. Currently, the 3-train, 11,000 bbls/day modular refinery produces Automotive Gas Oil, Dual Purpose Kerosene, Marine Diesel Oil, High-Pour Fuel Oil, and Naphtha. 2.OPAC Refinery, Delta state‚ÄìThis 10,000-bpd modular refinery located in Kwale, Delta state was completed in 2021. 3. Waltersmith Petroman Oil Limited's refinery‚Äì The refinery is a 5,000-bpd oil refinery located in Imo State. The refinery started operations in 2020, with plans to expand its capacity to 50,000 bpd in the coming years. 4. Duport Midstream Company Limited‚Äì Located in Edo State, this is a 2,500-BPD refinery that was completed in 2022 and started production in 2023. 5. Edo Refinery and Petro Chemical Company‚Äì This project is a wholly owned subsidiary of AIPCC Energy. It operates in two phases with capacities of 1,000 BPSD and 5,000 BPSD and has been commissioned and is fully operational. The refined products sold are Diesel, Naphtha and Low Pour Fuel Oil (LPFO). Work on Phase 2 (12,000 bpd) has already commenced, with full operations slated to start in March 2024. The federal government has stakes in some of these refineries likewise, the Edo State government. More Modular refineries will start operation in the country as modular refineries have commenced discussions with the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) in a bid to access part of the $18bn fund being planned by the bank for the development of refineries in Nigeria and other African countries. In 2022, Nigeria exported $1.04B in Refined Petroleum, Petroleum Gas ($9.04B) and Nitrogenous Fertilizers ($2B). Thank you, Baba Buhari ‚úåÔ∏è #GodBlessNigeria #GodBlessBuhari #MayTinubuSucceed\n\nQatar is a significant player in the global petroleum industry, particularly in the production and export of natural gas and crude oil. Here are some key points regarding petroleum in Qatar: Crude Oil Production: While Qatar is renowned for its extensive natural gas reserves, it also produces crude oil. The crude oil fields in Qatar are not as large as its natural gas reserves, but they contribute to the country's overall hydrocarbon production. North Field: The North Field, also known as the North Dome, is a massive offshore natural gas field located in the Persian Gulf. It is part of the larger South Pars/North Dome Gas-Condensate field, which Qatar shares with Iran. The North Field is a critical source of natural gas for Qatar's energy industry. Oil Fields: Qatar has several oil fields, with the most significant ones being located both onshore and offshore. Some of the major onshore oil fields include Dukhan and Idd El-Shargi, while offshore fields include Bul Hanine and Maydan Mahzam. Qatar Petroleum (QP): Qatar Petroleum is the state-owned company responsible for managing and overseeing the country's oil and gas resources. QP is actively involved in exploration, production, refining, and export activities related to petroleum. Refining and Downstream Activities: Qatar has refining facilities that process crude oil into various petroleum products. The downstream sector includes activities such as refining, petrochemical production, and the development of a diverse range of value-added products. Exports: Qatar is a significant exporter of both liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude oil. The country's strategic location in the Persian Gulf facilitates the transportation of these energy products to international markets. International Partnerships: Qatar has formed partnerships with various international companies to enhance its capabilities in petroleum exploration, production, and downstream activities. These partnerships contribute to the development of the country's oil and gas sector\n\n#NigeriaisopenforbusinessüöÄ üöÄOil production nears 1.7mbpd ‚Äì NNPC!üöÄ From 1.28 million barrels per day in April, the Group Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, Mele Kyari, says Nigeria‚Äôs oil production was inching towards 1.7mbpd as of Saturday.üí∞üí∞ This is as the NNPCL boss hinted that, critical gas infrastructure projects are ongoing to ensure the transport of 8 billion stock of gas daily through an extensive pipeline network within the next four years.

Ltd. (NNPC) has opened bidding for operation and maintenance rights for the under-repair Port Harcourt refinery in the oil-rich Niger Delta. The refinery has a total crude distillation capacity of 210,000 barrels per day at two plants, according to information from the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE). The older of the two was built 1965 while the second was built 1989. The NNPC is currently rehabilitating the refinery under a two-phase $1.5-billion project. Phase one targets to put the complex onstream at a 60 percent utilization rate while the second phase involves raising the utilization rate to 90 percent, according to a report from the Nigerian Television Authority March 22, 2019. The NNPC reported December 21, 2023, the project has reached mechanical completion while the entire rehabilitation achieved 77.4 percent completion as of the time. The NNPC is now looking for ‚Äúreputable and credible Operations & Maintenance companies to operate and maintain one of its refineries, Port Harcourt Refining Co., to ensure reliability and sustainability to meet the nation‚Äôs fuel supply and energy security obligations‚Äù, said the invitation for expression of interest. The state operator restricted bidders to those with an annual turnover of at least $2 billion from 2019 to 2022. Besides operation and maintenance experience, technical requirements include experience with fluid catalytic cracking and conversion units, as well as experience in commissioning, post-commissioning and turnaround. Interested companies must also have conducted relevant business in Nigeria or other parts of Africa. Bidders must be actively registered with the regulatory bodies in their respective countries of incorporation, with registration validity beyond 2023. Bidders have until February 26, 2024, to file all requirements. The government plans to privatize Port Harcourt Refining Co. It has an authorized share capital of NGN5 million ($5,480), consisting of five million ordinary shares priced NGN 1 ($0.001) each, according to the company‚Äôs profile on the BPE website. While under state control, it is being incorporated as a separate entity outside NNPC to allow for a new capital structure for the refinery operator, the profile says. The company‚Äôs 1999‚Äì2004 income data on the BPE website shows it was unprofitable 2000 onward. The refinery rarely operated above 50 percent of its capacity, according to the BPE. ‚ÄúPoor maintenance of facilities and inadequate manpower has over the years been the major reason for epileptic performance of the refinery‚Äù, the BPE says. However, ‚Äú[t]he Refinery operating at 90 ‚Äì 95 percent capacity and with current crude prices is expected to recoup its investment and make profits in just a few years of operations‚Äù, according to the BPE. The newer of the two refining plants was originally intended for export. ‚Äú\n\nNigeria needs to issue more oil &gas drilling licences for local companies. The Dangote Petroleum Refinery is set to start producing Automotive Gas Oil, also known as diesel, and JetA1 or aviation fuel in January 2024, while the production of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, is being delayed by the supply of crude oil in installments. It was gathered on Sunday that the facility would require a minimum of six million barrels of crude oil to kick-start the full production of refined petroleum products including AGO, PMS, Jet A1 and Dual Purpose Kerosene, otherwise called kerosene. But what the refinery got last week was one million barrels of crude, while the remaining five million barrels would arrive at the $20bn facility in another five installments. The Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemical Project, a subsidiary of Dangote Industries Limited, is a 650,000 barrels per day crude oil refinery, located in Dangote Industries Free Zone, Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos, Nigeria. Meet Ondo Regent Whose Father Reigned For Three Days | Punch Dangote Petroleum Refinery with the capacity to refine 650,000 barrels of crude oil per day covers an area of approximately 2,635 hectares and is located in the Lekki Free Trade Zone in Lagos. On November 2, 2023, The PUNCH reported that the failure to supply crude oil to domestic refineries, including the multi-billion dollar Dangote refinery, stalled the production of refined petroleum products at the facilities. The report also stated that the lack of crude oil supply came as the 650,000 barrels per day Dangote Refinery in Lagos missed the October production projection it had earlier set. It pointed out that the October production target miss made it the second time in 2023 that Dangote Refinery would raise hopes in Africa, especially Nigeria, of a possible end to petrol importation. Following The PUNCH‚Äôs report, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited swiftly declared the next day November 3, 2023, that it was set to provide six million barrels of crude oil to the Dangote Refinery. It, however, has yet to do so. But on Friday, the management of Dangote Refinery confirmed the receipt of one million barrels of crude oil, adding that this would lead to the production of refined products at the facility. ‚ÄúIn a major step towards boosting Nigeria‚Äôs domestic refining capacity and attaining energy security (self-sufficiency), Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemicals plant has purchased one million barrels of Agbami crude grade from Shell International Trading and Shipping Company Limited, one of the largest trading companies in Nigeria as well as globally, trading over eight million barrels of crude oil per day,‚Äù the oil firm had stated.\n\nSinopec News QINGDAO, China, Nov. 3, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (HKG: 0386, \"Sinopec\") has officially put China's first and also the world's largest LNG storage tank of 270,000 cubic meters into service on November 2 at its Qingdao LNG Receiving Terminal. The tank will add 165 million cubic meters of storage capacity to meet the gas demand of 2.16 million households for five months during the winter heating season, which will enhance and guarantee the natural gas supply in North China. China‚Äôs Largest LNG Storage Tank of 270,000 Cubic Meters Now in Operation.
