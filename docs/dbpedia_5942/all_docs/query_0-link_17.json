        "text": "The petrochemical industry, that elegant new alchemy of our times, dramatizes the paradox of modern technology: its blessings are mixed with plagues.\n\nThe ancient goal of alchemy, turning baser metals into gold, can now be achieved by modern atom‐smashing techniques, but the expense is prohibitive. However, where classical alchemy has failed to meet the test of the marketplace, that elegant new alchemy of our times — the petrochemical industry — has succeeded.\n\nThe petrochemical industry's products, made chiefly out of crude oil and natural gas, make up a marvelous catalogue of useful materials: cloth with the sheen of silk or the fuzziness of wool; cables stronger than steel; synthetics with the elasticity of rubber, the flexibility of leather, the lightness of paper, or the workableness of wood; detergents that wash as well as soap without curdling in hard water; chemicals that can kill dandelions, but not grass; repel mosquitoes, but not people; diminish sniffles, reduce blood pressure, or cure tuberculosis.\n\nBut something has gone wrong. Increasingly, the chemist succeeds, brilliantly, in synthesizing a new, useful, highly competitive substance, only to have it cast aside because of its biological hazards: Food dyes and fire‐retardants for children's sleepwear are banned because they may cause cancer; a new industry to produce plastic soda bottles, developed at a cost of $50 million, comes to an abrupt halt as the Food and Drug Administration discovers that a chemical which may leach out of the bottles causes tumors in mice; pesticides are taken off the market because they kill fish and wildlife; firemen would like to ban plastic building materials because they produce toxic fumes when they burn.\n\nThe petrochemical industry, by any ordinary criteria — its rate of growth, its profitability, the apparent eagerness of consumers to purchase huge quantities of its products — is the most successful in postwar America. Yet it is now caught by forces that threaten its viability. The industry's raw materials, petroleum and natural gas — once cheap and plentiful — are now becoming astronomically expensive as the supplies shrink and become increasingly uncertain. The industry has been beset by Federal regulations and by pressure from the public, often based on the widespread fear of cancer, to control not only the dissemination of its toxic wastes, but also of some of the industry's most salable products, such as saccharin. These pressures on a major American industry have important implications for the economy, for the availability of jobs, for the future of industrial technology, and will affect the availability of products that most of us have taken for granted, and may soon have to do without.\n\nThe petrochemical industry is a huge success in the marketplace. Since World War II, the industry's detergents have driven soap out of a market that it monopolized for perhaps a thousand years; in textiles, synthetic fibers have massively displaced cotton and wool; plastics have replaced long‐established uses of metals, wood and glass; food production has become heavily dependent on fertilizers, pesticides and other agricultural chemicals; synthetic drugs and toiletries have become a major enterprise in an area of commerce once represented by concoctions of herbs.\n\nIn most industrial nations the petrochemical industry has become the fastest‐growing sector of manufacturing. In the United States, in the last 30 years, it has grown at an annual rate of about 8 percent, twice the rate of growth of manufacturing industries as a whole. The industry's economic rewards have been correspondingly large: In that period its rate of profit has generally led those of all major industries; and the pharmaceuticals have led all the rest, recording profits ranging about 20 percent, as compared with the II percent average for manufacturing as a whole.\n\nYet the petrochemical industry dramatizes the paradox of modern technology: Its blessings are mixed with plagues. Here are some of the more recent troubles:\n\n• In Michigan, because a chemical plant inadvertently combined a fire‐retardant with animal feed, thousands of cattle and millions of chickens were lost, and hundreds of people made ill.\n\n• In Virginia, because of the careless operation of a small insecticide plant, the entire Chesapeake Bay fishing industry has been threatened, and dozens of chemical workers have had their health ruined.\n\n• In Seveso, Italy — a small town near Milan — the accidental release of a few pounds of a highly toxic chemical from a petrochemical plant has caused serious illness among hundreds of children and forced the evacuation, now in its second year, of 700 people from their homes.\n\nThe most chilling prospect is that much of the cancer problem in the United States may eventually be laid at the door of the petrochemical industry. The most drastic actions taken against the petrochemical industry thus far the banning of DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides, and most recently PCB— have been largely based on their hazards as possible carcinogens. It has been estimated that perhaps three‐fourths of the incidence of cancer in the United States is due to environmental agents, and a recent county‐by‐county survey of cancer incidence shows a significant correlation with the local concentrations of petrochemical operations. The highest incidence of bladder cancer in the United States is found in Salem County, N.J., an area dense with refineries and petrochemical plants. A particularly alarming fact is that since the 1960's the downward trend in the death rate among United States males has stopped and reversed itself, and according to a recent U.S. Public Health Service survey, cancers (other than those attributed to smoking) are prominent among the causes of the rising death rate. Since many cancers may develop only 10 years or more after exposure to the instigating substance, and since widespread exposure to petrochemical products has occurred only in the last 20 to 25 years, there is reason to fear that these changes may foreshadow an upsurge in the incidence of cancer. If so, we may be facing an epidemic of environmental cancer, induced by past, irremediable exposures to petrochemicals.\n\nThe quandary of the petrochemical industry is that the unique reasons for its success and growth — that it can produce a growing variety of new manmade substances, and can sell them cheaply, but only in very large amounts — are themselves the sources of its growing threat to society. Pressed by its economic structure to create ever more chemically complex man‐made products on huge scales, the industry now confronts a hard fact of nature —that the more complex these products, the more likely they are to harm living things, including people, and the more widespread they are, the greater their toxic impact.\n\nThe petrochemical industry is fundamentally different from all other production industries. To begin with, it is a process industry. This sets it off from ordinary manufacturing such as the production of automobiles, dresses or frying pans. In these enterprises, the form of the final product is different from that of the starting materials, but the substances of which it is made—steel, glass and rubber; cotton, wool or nylon; iron or aluminum — remain unchanged. In contrast, in a process industry a new substance is produced: Iron ore, coke and oxygen, properly combined, become steel; sand and lime, heated together, become glass; two petrochemicals, butadiene and styrene, appropriately reacted, become synthetic rubber.\n\nHowever, where the other process industries produce only a few different types of steel or glass, the petrochemical industry converts oil and natural gas into many hundreds of chemically different substances. The industry is based on the chemistry of the carbon atom, which can combine in enormously variable ways with the other atoms that most frequently occur in carbon‐containing compounds, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. The industry's processes branch like some great genealogical tree: From crude oil, which contains 10 major primary constituents, the industry produces about 75 chief intermediate chemicals, which are converted into about 100 large‐scale end products, each manufactured in amounts ranging from one million to three billion pounds per year. At each successive stage, the industry produces more numerous, more varied, and, as we shall see, more dangerous substances.\n\nMaterials flow constantly through the industry's gargantuan network of multiply interconnected pipelines, separators and reactors. Since storage is very expensive and therefore limited in capacity, everything that enters the system has to go somewhere: It is either carted off as a final product, burned by the industry itself as a fuel (or wastefully as a “flare”) or — too often — expelled into the environment as waste.\n\nThe petrochemical industry has a strong, built‐in tendency to proliferate, to elaborate the number and variety of its products. Consider what happened when the industry began to market one of its most successful products, polyethylene film — that ubiquitous wrapping around everything from supermarket beefsteaks to kitchen leftovers. Through the strange, Rube Goldberg economics of the petrochemical industry, acrylic fiber captured the rug market largely because supermarkets began to use huge amounts of polyethylene film to wrap vegetables and cuts of meat. It happened this way: The film is manufactured from ethylene. Ethylene production yields, as a major byproduct, propylene. At first, this was burned by the industry as a fuel. But then it was discovered that propylene could be converted to acrylonitrile, which could then be used to manufacture acrylic fibers for rugs. When propylene was sold for that purpose, it brought a price twice its value as fuel. This saving significantly reduced the cost of producing ethylene, ultimately cutting the price of polyethylene film as well, and expanding its sales. Therefore, at the same time, acrylic fiber was marketable at an attractive price because it could be produced cheaply and in amounts.\n\nThus, new products are often created not so much to meet the consumer's needs as the industry's. This approach is clearly reflected in a typical petrochemical company's (the Hooker Chemical Company) research policy: “Rather than manufacturing known products by a known method for a known market . . . the research department is now free to develop any product that looks promising. If there is not a market for it, the sales development group seeks to create one.”\n\nThis helps to explain why petrochemical products characteristically invade the rest of the production system. Since synthetic detergents appeared in the 1940's, they have captured about 85 percent of the market once held by soap. Since 1950, synthetic fibers have taken over about 70 percent of the United States textile market, once largely held by cotton and wool. The production of plastics has grown at the rate of 16 percent per year, while the production of competitive materials has been much slower: Leather has increased at an annual rate of only 1.2 percent, paper at 4.8 percent, and lumber production has decreased at a rate of 0.5 percent per year.\n\nThe petrochemical industry seems to have developed a kind of economic imperialism, forcing consumers to give up old products, most of them natural, for synthetic replacements. If this judgment seems harsh, it is nevertheless shared by one of the leaders of the British petrochemical industry, Lord Beeching: “Instead of producing known products to satisfy existing industrial needs, it [the petrochemical industry] is, increasingly, producing new forms of matter which not only replace the materials used by existing industries, but which cause extension and modification of those industries. . . To an increasing degree it forces existing industries to adapt themselves to use its products.” The truth of Lord Beeching's generalization is evident to anyone who has recently tried to find a pure cotton shirt, a laundry cleaner free of synthetics, or a wooden clothespin.\n\nThe rapidly changing energy situation is likely to intensify these problems. Fearing a shortage of natural gas, a large sector of the petrochemical industry is planning to substitute crude oil as a source of ethylene. This switch will demand new capital investments that are three to four times greater than current investments in naturalgas‐based facilities, no small feat in a period of capital shortage. Using crude oil for ethylene production will mean that many more leftover chemicals will be produced, and, according to a recent analysis of the situation in Business Week, “a much wider variety of products.” Not surprisingly, Edward G. Jefferson, senior vice president of DuPont, sees this new situation as “one in which the petrochemical industry becomes an even more important mainstay of the United States economy.” Once more, the peculiar technological and economic design of the petrochemical industry forces it to proliferate new products and to penetrate more deeply into the national economy.\n\nThe petrochemical invasion has been particularly targeted against the largest, most long‐established markets —for clothing, building materials, furniture, appliances, cleansers and other necessities. These invasions succeed because synthetic petrochemical products can be manufactured in large volumes at low prices. This capability is, in turn, the outcome of the technological design of the petrochemical industry. The machinery used in the flow processes that characterize petrochemical production is very complex, replete with miles of piping, specially built reactor vessels, numerous valves, switches, recording devices and elaborate controls. The machinery is very expensive; the petrochemical industry is the most capital intensive of all major manufacturing industries, producing only about 80 cents of value added per dollar of capital invested, as compared with about $3.64, in the case of a typical natural competitor, the leather industry. Since the size and the output of a petrochemical plant can be increased a great deal without a proportional increase in the numbers of expensive valves and controls — or in the amount of labor needed to operate them — there is a considerable economy of scale. A large investment in machinery is more profitable than a small one. As a result, large petrochemical plants are much more economically efficient than small ones. If the capacity of a typical petrochemical plant is increased from one million to 10 million pounds per year, the cost of manufacturing a pound of product is reduced by twothirds. Thus, petrochemical products can he sold at a low price, but only in very large amounts.\n\nThis gives the petrochemical industry a powerful economic advantage in invading large, well‐developed markets such as the clothing field. These markets usually exhibit what economists call a “high elasticity of demand”: Demand for a particular product rises disproportionately with a fall in price, and vice versa. Synthetic fibers and plastics can readily invade such a market by selling at the low prices made possible by the economies of scale and the by product development typical of the petrochemical industry. Thus, between 1960 and 1970, as the price of polyvinyl chloride fell by 75 percent, consumption increased by 500 percent, enabling the plastic to replace leather in clothes, handbags, shoes and gloves.\n\nFor all these reasons, the economic success of the petrochemical industry has been a self‐fulfilling prophecy. Once the industry became established, it was bound to grow, and, by further reducing prices, growth carried the industry into new markets, further accelerating its expansion. The industry would appear to he an invincible competitor in the marketplace of a free economy.\n\nYet the industry has been increasingly vulnerable to the dangers inherent in its own product ion processes. That the industry itself has thus far been unable to reduce its hazards to a level acceptable to the public is evident from the intensely critical response to recent environmental catastrophes. The Kepone accident, for example, resulted in an unprecendented fine — $13 million — levied against the Allied Chemical Corporation for its responsibility in the disaster; civil suits involved more than $100 million in damage claims.\n\nAdditional evidence that the industry itself can no longer cope with the growing risks inherent in its operations is found in its insurance record. Ordinarily, commercial enterprises protect themselves against such risks by obtaining insurance to cover the expected cost of possible damages. When the risk and the possible damage are high, the premium is large; when the possible damage is very great, and difficult to compute accurately, insurance is usually unobtainable. In recent years, the petrochemical industry has suffered from both of these difficulties. A recent survey of the problem in Chemical & Engineering News complains of “skyrocketing insurance premiums, with renewals sometimes 30 to 50 times higher than the old rate. Policies canceled, often without notice or reason. Throughout the industry, companies are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain product liability insurance.”\n\nTwo of the petrochemical industry's trade associations have considered establishing their own insurance companies, somewhere in the Bahamas. Another proposed solution is no‐fault insurence pos sibly based on a Federal insurance company. Like the nuclear‐power industry before it (which, by virtue of the PriceAnderson Act, is now provided with Federal insurance coverage against the huge damage that might result from an accident), the petrochemical industry may find it necessary to shift the burden of insurance risks from its own, private responsibility, to society's.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the industry's earlier economic advantages have backfired. Originally, the industry's raw materials, petroleum and natural gas, were plentiful and available at a constant price. Now the situation is dramatically different. With the energy crisis, the industry's dependence on these fuels has become a serious economic liability, as supplies become shaky and their costs rise at an astronomical rate. At the same time, the petrochemical industry may be particularly vulnerable to the growing shortage of investment capital. The industry's vaunted high labor productivity, which is nearly three times the average for that of all manufacturing industries, is achieved at the expense of very intense inverstments of capital.\n\nThe clash between the economic success of synthetic petrochemicals and their increasing vulnerability to biological complaints is the inevitable result of the very fact that the petrochemicals are synthetic — made by man, not nature. In every living cell there is a tightly integrated network of chemical processes which has evolved over three billion years of trial and error. In all of the countless organisms that have lived over this time, and in all of their even more numerous separate cells, there has been a huge number of opportunities for chemical errors — the production of substances that could disrupt the delicately balanced chemistry of the living cell. Like other evolutionary misfits, any organism that made these chemical mistakes perished, so that the genetic tendency to produce the offending substance was eliminated from the line of evolutionary descent. One can imagine that at some point in the course of evolution some unfortunate cell managed to synthesize, let us say, DDT—and became a casualty in the evolutionary struggle to survive.\n\nAnother requirement for evolutionary survival is that every substance synthesized by living things must be broken down by them as well — be biodegradable. It is this biological rule which establishes the distinctive closed cycles of ecology. When petrochemical technology synthesizes a new complex substance that is alien to living things, they are likely to lack the enzymes needed to degrade the substance — which then accumulates as waste. This explains why our beaches have become blanketed in debris, since nondegradable synthetics have replaced hemp cordage, wooden spoons and paper cups, which, because they were made of natural cellulose, soon decayed.\n\nThe likelihood that a synthetic organic chemical will be biologically hazardous increases with its complexity; the more elaborate its structure, the more likely that some part of it will be incompatible with the normal chemistry of life. While only 10 percent of the relatively simple primary constituents of petroleum and natural gas are classified as “highly toxic,” by the time the petrochemical tree has branched several times to yield much more complex products, the proportion of highly toxic substances has increased to about 50 percent. Thus, as the petrochemical industry is forced by the logic of its economic design to produce increasing numbers of ever more complex synthetic substances, it also increases the risk that some of these products will be dangerous to living things\n\nAs the uses of a product expand, it comes in contact with people in rapidly increasing numbers and in new ways. Then, the built‐in propensity of man‐made organic chemicals to cause biological troubles has many new opportunities to express itself. Unfortunately, the industry does not readily respond to this change. According to a recent Environmental Protection Agency survey, as production expands “. . . there is essentially no mechanism that triggers expanded toxicological and environmental testing. Such expanded testing, when it occurs, is nearly always in response to a reaction to some adverse finding outside the company.” The survey points out, for example, that although United States production of vinyl chloride — a substance recently shown to cause cancer — increased from 321 million pounds in 1952 to 5,300 million pounds in 1973, the industry's assessment of the health hazard failed to keep up with the sharply increased human exposure “until after some adverse publications in the scientific literature,” as the E.P.A. report says.\n\nNevertheless, whether heeded or not, the earliest warning that a petrochemical has a potential for large‐scale disaster usually comes from within the industry: Chemical workers, who inevitably are most exposed to the substance, become ill. For example, production of PCB expanded from 20,000 tons in 1960 to 43,000 tons in 1970, although as early as 1941 the severe effects of PCB on workers’ health had caused public‐health officials to publish warnings that “human contact with PCB should be avoided.” Had this admonition been heeded, the expanded use of PCB. especially in products accessible to human contact, such as plastics, paint, ink and paper, and its spread into the environment — not to speak of repeated industrial exposures — could have been avoided.\n\nSuch failures to appreciate in good time the biological hazards of petrochemicals are sometimes not so much a matter of neglect as of impotence. In some cases, analytical methods are unable to detect the very low levels at which many substances are toxic. For example, PCB was detectable in the environment only after chemical analysts learned how to separate it from its close relative, DDT. In other cases, as synthetic substances penetrate into the intricate network of the environment, they begin to interact, not only with natural substances but with each other, creating a statistical nightmare. Thus, many of the several hundred synthetic organic chemicals that now find their way into water supplies readily react with the chlorine used in water purification and form new substances, which may in turn react with each other. A common product of these reactions is chloroform, which has now become the most ubiquitoos synthetic organic pollu tant of United States water supplies; it is a carcinogen. In the area of Charleston, W. Va., where seven large petrochemical plants and several smaller ones annually emit tons of waste substances into the air, 128 different synthetic organic compounds have been identified among them. Several of the waste substances can cause cancer and birth defects. No one knows how many other hazardous substances are produced by the further reaction that may occur among the original pollutants, once they mix in the air.\n\nThe most serious threat to the petrochemical industry is that society is becoming less willing to bear the “externalities” — the risks that the industry has imposed on society as a result of its private success. The strongest evidence is the recent passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act late in 1976. The act empowers the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances judged to “present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.” In reaching this judgment, the administrator must conduct open hearings, in which all interested parties, including public‐interest and citizens’ groups, can participate, with Federal financial assistance, if needed. In establishing a rule to govern a particular substance, the administrator must consider not only its hazard to health and the environment, but also its benefits, the availability of substitutes which are less hazardous, the “reasonably ascertainable economic consequences of the rule . . .” and its “social impact.”\n\nGiven this broad mandate for an open discussion of a substance's biological hazards and its economic and social virtues and faults as compared with those of alternatives, this new legislation may result in two very different outcomes for the petrochemical industry and for society.\n\nOne possible outcome is that enforcement of the act will become bogged down in niggling debates over what constitutes “an unreasonable risk of injury” and over the comparable benefits of each particular substance. Predictably, industry representatives will argue that the risk of injury is insignificant, while public‐interest groups will argue the opposite. Test results will be debated; analytical methods questioned; statistics compared. In view of the enormous number of substances to be considered, running into the thousands, it is easy to envisage the end result of this approach. Substance by substance, disputed judgments of their hazards will slowly emerge from a vast bureaucratic jungle. It is to be hoped that this will gradually reduce the number of hazardous substances to which we are exposed. But it will do little to correct the problem at its source, which is that petrochemical production is governed not so much by society's needs for the products as by the industry's need to make a profit by manufacturing a growing variety of substances in the largest possible amounts\n\nOn the other hand, if sufficient attention is given to the act's broad mandate to compare the benefits and risks of a petrochemical product with those of available substitutes — including natural ones —and to consider the economic and social consequences of choosing between them, the hearings may have an entirely different outcome. Industry representatives are then likely to reiterate their belief in the benefits of their products, relative to the risks: that agricultural chemicals produce plentiful food at reasonable prices; that synthetic textiles produce affordable clothes which are easy to maintain; that plastic auto parts are lighter, stronger and cheaper than metal ones; that the construction of a plant to manufacture a new plastic substitute for leather will create new jobs. In rebuttal, their opponents may well reply that recent studies show that some commercial farmers do about as well with organic methods as their conventional neighbors who use chemicals, that cotton fabrics are much less energy intensive than synthetic ones (which are, after all, made from petroleum and natural gas); that the economic gains afforded by cheaper auto parts are offset by the economic drain imposed on a capital‐short economy by the capital‐intensive petrochemical industry; that because leather production is much more labor intensive than the petrochemical industry, the displacement of leather by a new plastic will reduce, rather than increase, the total number of available jobs.\n\nGuided by this broader mandate, the Toxic Substances Control Act can do much more than regulate the use of hazardous materials. It can, in fact, open what the industry may regard as a political Pandora's box, providing an arena in which the public will be able to intervene effectively in a process that is normally the exclusive domain of industrial managers: decisions about what to produce and how to produce it.\n\nThis issue has already been raised in connection with nuclear power. Concern over its hazards has led to a growing demand for phasing out the industry: its social burden has generated a demand for social governance of the industry. Many Americans already hold strong opinions about one major petrochemical product, plastics. A recent public‐opinion poll conducted for the Society of the Plastics Industry showed that, in comparison with alternative goods, many public officials regard plastics as the most hazardous alternative, and the product which they would be most willing to do without,"
