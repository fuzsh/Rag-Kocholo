The\n\nfonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,\n\nredistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved\n\nnames are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,\n\nhowever, cannot be released under any other type of license.

These can be\n\nincluded either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or\n\nin the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or\n\nbinary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\n\n3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font\n\nName(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding\n\nCopyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as\n\npresented to the users.\n\n4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font\n\nSoftware shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any\n\nModified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the\n\nCopyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written\n\npermission.\n\n5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,\n\nmust be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be\n\ndistributed under any other license.
