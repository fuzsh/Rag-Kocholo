Because Meridio integrates so closely with these products, users find it much easier to adopt eDRM disciplines into their daily work. This overcome one of the biggest problems the industry has faced in EDRM deployments – securing rapid user acceptance and buy-in. At a more detailed technical architecture level Meridio has been designed for optimal operation in a wide range of business operations, and supports innovations such as remote usage, replication and federated systems. Meridio has also been designed to the highest security levels and meets the latest international standards for RM systems Intependent from Type + Source of Information Management + Archive (Exchange/Outlook/Notes) SAP Archive Link Interface (certified)\n\n5 Hierarchical Fileplan Usability and Control Feature for Records Managers\n\nA Fileplan is the structure that represents an organizations records classification scheme Used to classify records in context Every record must have a defined location within a fileplan A record may be classified in multiple locations within the fileplan Allows users work in common classifications A Hierarchical Fileplan provides an a familiar way for users and administrators to organize and classify records Essential for a Centralized approach to Records An important usability feature in an eDRM system is a Fileplan. A fileplan is the tool a records manager uses to define the organizations records filing. Meridio represents a fileplan as a hierarchy. This has several usability advantages. It appears as a familiar foldering system. More than foldering system though, changes can be ‘rippled’ up and down the hierarchy, easing the task of maintenance and adding new fileplan members. A Meridio fileplan allows the records department the control it needs to define records policy. A Meridio fileplan is also a tool to allow easy declaration of records. Fileplan entries typically map to how user work. For example, everyone knows how to work in a project. Projects are organized around themes, like they are for customers, and for each customer, there are different project. In a specific project, there are different kinds of container, one for customer communications, one for internal specifications. This model translates directly to a fileplan. Users operate in the project, and never really know they are doing the work to declare records. 5\n\n6 Document / Record Lifecycle\n\nDocument / Record Lifecycle with MOSS 2007 Document / Record Lifecycle Author control Corporate Control Collaboration Document Creation Version Control and / or Regulatory Compliance Business Rules Records Router Audit trails Life Cycle Management Secure Archiving Publish/Declare Activity Archive Transfer ILM Storage management Replication, Federation Scalability High security Hierarchical Fileplan Destroy DM process / time RM\n\n7 Meridio provides… Massively scalable repository for storing all information of an organization Securely, reliably, and meeting compliance requirements Seamless access to that information through familiar Microsoft applications SharePoint, Outlook, Office Flexible storage lifecycle management of content within an organization Storage devices, archive etc. Advanced Records Management DoD5015, TNA, Moreq compliant Replication, Federation, Smart client functionality to support requirements of globally dispersed organizations 7\n\n8 Customers No1 Requirements\n\nDocument and Records Management Requirements Manage business records which have long retention periods Drive retention and policy centrally Control and Share large amounts of information within an Organization Cost Efficiency in Storage Infrastructure Allowing non-active content in SharePoint to be stored externally in low cost storage Industry figures show the TCO of at least 2X to maintain content inside of a SQL database over a file system There is an additional savings of almost 2X by storing content in a special-purpose device, like EMC Centera or NetAPP Need for seamless end user experience SharePoint as a collaboration platform Use of SharePoint team sites to access information (whether it is active or not)\n\n9 Requirements for Governance Key Organizational Goals\n\nSatisfy Regulatory Compliance Deliver the Right Information Manage the Proliferation of Information Enterprise Access and Performance Excellent Usability and Flexibility Control the Cost of Storage Organizations look to technology to help meet key Governance Goals: First, eDRM technology has to satisfy the organizations compliance requirements. These are varied, and industry specific, but driven by industry best practices. Content is a key asset of an organization. An eDRM system should be an active information repository, delivering the right information must be delivered to the right people, at the right time. At the same time, information must be controlled, to manage its proliferation to control litigation risk To be a true information tool, the document and records must have true enterprise access, and the scalability to deliver good performance for all users regardless of the geographic diversity in the organization. eDRM technology must have excellent usability to be successful. Usability issues have stopped many an eDRM initiative, so proprietary software must be kept at a minimum. It also must be flexible enough, to satisfy the compliance mandate of the industry it operates in. Lastly, storage costs must be minimized. An eDRM system manages a great deal of content. IT is under pressure to keep their storage costs down. Meridio links content to expected usage over time to minimize storage costs.\n\n10 Meridio Extends MOSS 2007 Regulated and Complex eDRM Requirements\n\nRegulated Industries Manufacturing Automobile, Plant, Energy, Oil & Gas and Utilities Sector Financial Services Banking, Insurance, Brokerage Research & Dev Biotechnology, Pharma, Hi-tech-Industry Government Central Gov, Defense, Security and Intelligence Specialized Security Regional Government Information Complexity Multi-department, multi-site, multi-national Growing No of internal + external rules, regulations, laws Deal with the needs of long term Archiving Ongoing Litigation, Legal Discovery, Audit issues Now, lets talk about just how Meridio Extends MOSS 2007 to meet the needs of Regulated and Complex eDRM Requirements. Regulated Industries, such as the Energy segment to the Manufacturing and the Financial Server ices markets are highly regulated. At the same time, they rely on intellectual capitol to gain a competitive advantage. eDRM systems must not only comply with the regulations that drive these industries, they must keep their litigation exposure down, and at the same time, re-purpose records as an information source. A tall order. Government is highly standards driven. At the same time, Defense, Security and Intelligence drive the needs for specialized security and the desire to have a shared services environment The more an organization relies on their eDRM system for decision making, the more Meridio is a requirement. The more distributed the organization is, the more challenging it is to meet their information management needs with MOSS. Meridio meets an organizations information management needs, regardless of how difficult the environment is. And all this time content is building, putting a strain on the IT infrastructure. Meridio delivers storage management to help deal with this long term issue.\n\n11 Meridio and Office 2007 Meridio 5.0 Linking Records to ERP Data\n\nRM Standards Instant Message Capture Hierarchical Records Classification Cross-Repository Legal Discovery Content Replication Information Lifecycle Management Enterprise Policy Management Manage Legacy Repositories Government Security High Volume Journaled Physical Records Records Re-use Basic Content Services Collaboration Holds Management of Records Repository Policy Based File Plan Record Routing Office Server 2007 RM Document Level Security (Build Slide) Meridio and Microsoft Office 2007 work together to deliver comprehensive Records Management. The Microsoft platform is the foundation for our solutions. (1) Microsoft Office Server 2007 adds key capabilities to address collaboration, document and records needs. Office Server 2007 RM adds what Gartner Group has termed “Basic Content Services” of management, policy based file plan, holds, document security and routing.

MOSS is designed to meet the needs of the widest possible audience. Meridio is targeted at the segments of the market who have Specialized eDRM requirements, and have complex information management needs. On the Information Complexity Dimension, Meridio helps manage the cost of storage, by implementing an ILM strategy not only on Meridio content, but content stored in MOSS directly. Meridio helps an organization leverage their records as an information management tool, using records as a key knowledge source. Meridio has the practical scalability for enterprise document and records management, using 100% Microsoft technologies to meet the capacity needs of the most demanding and dispersed organization. On the Application Specialization dimension Meridio has specialized security, needed in many markets including Government/Defence, Professional and Financial Services. Information Complexity and Specialization combine to define the needs for Regulated Industries, who have complex eDRM requirements. Application Specialization\n\n13 Regulated Industries Require Comprehensive and Flexible Control from Meridio\n\nIncreased Control for the Records Manager Centralized Control Delegating Authority to Records Administrators Controlling how much flexibility users have Enhanced Security and Auditing Meet Government and Industry Needs Weigh Security needs with Usability Specialized Content Management of and Instant Messages Regulations challenge an organization. They have to build policies that allow them to comply with a mandate. This puts considerable pressure on the organization, as lack of compliance can result in fines, penalties and bad publicity. To satisfy the needs of Regulated Industries, you have to allow the Records Management function the freedom to decide how they want to define records: through a centralized policy, administrated from the records department, to some delegation of control to records administrators, who implement policy in departments and sites. How much users involvement is also key. In some industries, it is only the end user who can properly categorize records. In others it is a business process driven by the records management function. All are valid, all have to be supported by an eDRM product. Security goes with industry. Government and Defense in particular has its own security model. The art with implementing security is not impacting usability. The two, security and usability can be at opposite ends of the spectrum unless they are designed in. Regulatory Compliance deals with specialized content, like high-volume management. eDRM systems must not only support this requirement, but they must meet the performance needs demands,.\n\n14 Specialized Security Balancing Security and Usability\n\nGovernment and Regulated Industries have demanding security requirements that extend to the entire document lifecycle Additional Security at the feature and system level are needed to satisfy this requirement Meridio can deliver advanced security for the entire document lifecycle Ethical Walls “Government” or Security for Classified Processing Penetration testing A common requirement in regulated industries and government is advanced security. Meridio delivers advanced security as a feature to the system. Meridio is certified by the US Department of Defense for use in classified processing. Meridio is also used in specialized intelligence applications, where it has to pass stringent penetration testing to be compliant. Many industries have specific security requirements. Industries such as professional services and audit have strict “ethical wall” requirements, to ensure that customer who are competitors do not have their proprietary information shared.\n\n15 Microsoft Meridio 5.0 Microsoft brings records management to a wide audience in Office 2007 Meridio focuses on complex RM needs and market segments who have these high security - for Military, R&D, etc. scalability geographically, on User and content ILM, storage management and secure archiving replication, federation, offline high-volume -management, instant message capture certification for DOD, TNA, PRO, etc. all with usage of familiar tools for eDRM Meridio and Microsoft offer a joint value proposition in records management. According to the Gartner Group, less than 20% of organization today have their electronic records properly managed. That is a staggeringly small number, given the risks involved. Microsoft Office 2007 will integrate records features directly into the Office platform. This will expand electronic records by making records technologies more readily accessible.
