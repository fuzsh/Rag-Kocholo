Tenuta Meridio also features two swimming pools with panoramic views, a biolake, also with panoramic views, that immerses you in nature, offering a unique experience, and an outdoor hot tub to fully enjoy moments of pure relaxation.

The better the energy efficiency rating, the lower the energy consumption and cost of air-conditioning the building. Please note: buildings belonging to the same class can also have very different energy consumptions if the shape and climate zone are different.\n\nWhat is the EPgl (Global Energy Performance index)?\n\nThe EPgl indicates how much energy is consumed so that the building or the building unit reaches comfort conditions, and is based on the energy services present and according to the type of property under standard use. The unit of measurement is kWh/m2 per year.\n\nWe recommend that you check with the advertiser if the energy efficiency rating of the property is updated to Law 90/2013.\n\nJoin our Newsletter and get Explora Italia mag as a gift\n\nBy subscribing to this newsletter, you’ll receive:\n\nBest Italian property deals\n\nUpdates about our services\n\nNews about Italy and its property market\n\nWe guarantee your privacy.\n\nYour personal data will never be shared with any third party.\n\nEmail address\n\nI agree to your Terms of use and Privacy policy"
