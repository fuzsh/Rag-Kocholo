        "meta_description": "POSITION\r\nTenuta Meridio is a complex of three buildings, situated in an exceptionally unique location, at the heart of the Val d’Orcia, one of the most picturesque regions of Tuscany. Surrounded by gentle green hills and lush vineyards, the property offers breathtaking panoramic views of golden wheat fields and olive groves stretching as far as the eye can see. The landscape is punctuated only by solitary cypress trees and dirt roads winding through the hills. Its strategic location, between Pienza and San Quirico d’Orcia, allows for cultural excursions to Pienza, San Quirico d’Orcia, Monticchiello, Montalcino, Montepulciano, and Siena. The estate is accessible via a scenic road that traverses the valley, offering visitors a journey immersed in the natural beauty and tranquility of the Tuscan countryside. This privileged position allows guests to enjoy the peace and serenity of the UNESCO World Heritage landscape.\r\n\r\nGARDEN AND OUTDOOR SPACE\r\nFor all three buildings, the outdoor space consists of a large garden, providing the property with a unique connection to the surrounding landscape. The typical cypress trees, offering shaded areas where you can relax or spend time in good company, gently caressed by a light breeze, make these spaces even more pleasant and refreshing. Tenuta Meridio also features two swimming pools with panoramic views, a biolake, also with panoramic views, that immerses you in nature, offering a unique experience, and an outdoor hot tub to fully enjoy moments of pure relaxation. In summary, the true wealth of this magnificent property is undoubtedly the outdoor space, which makes it unique in its kind.\r\n\r\nINTERIOR LAYOUT\r\nBUILDING 1\r\nBasement: one flooring, one bathroom, and two cellars. \r\nGround Floor: two dining rooms, one kitchen, nine bathrooms, seven bedrooms, three of which have a living room and two kitchenettes, one pantry, one storage room, one changing room, four porches and one entrance.\r\nBUILDING 2 \r\nGround Floor: six bedrooms, one double with attached bathroom and kitchen\r\nFirst Floor: four bedrooms, one double with attached bathroom and kitchen.\r\nBUILDING 3 \r\nBasement Floor: two technical rooms and storage room.\r\nGround Floor: six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, one kitchen, one reception, one utility room, one living room, one storage room, one breakfast room, one hallway, one portico, one porch and two terraces.\r\n\r\nFINISHES\r\nThis magnificent estate, dating back to the 1700s, has undergone recent renovations to provide all modern comforts without altering the ancient charm and atmosphere, creating a perfect harmony between the property and the surrounding landscape. The estate boasts high quality finishes that enhance its rustic and elegant appeal. The terracotta floors impart warmth and timeless beauty to the spaces, providing a perfect foundation for traditional furnishings. The chestnut wood beams, visible in all rooms, add an authentic touch and a robustness that only solid wood can offer. The solid chestnut wood windows, equipped with double glazing, ensure excellent thermal and acoustic insulation while beautifully framing views of the surrounding landscape. The shutters, also made of chestnut wood, complete the exterior with classic elegance and provide additional protection. The bathrooms are finished in ceramic, combining practicality and beauty. Together, these finishes give the estate a distinctive character where tradition and artisanal quality blend harmoniously.",
