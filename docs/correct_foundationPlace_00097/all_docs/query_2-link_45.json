        "text": "Sustainability Report2021 Letter to Stakeholders Giovanni Stevanato had a dream and a vision. He wanted to create world-class glass manufacturing activities in Piom-bino Dese, Italy, and set a standard of excellence in the industry. Seventy years ago, we took over his legacy, proudly building a global manufacturing enterprise with an international team of dedicated professionals driven by his same passion and desire to keep learning and improving. In 2021, we joined the New York Stock Exchange and began the next chapter in our storied history. The listing will further strengthen our integrated offerings, increase Stevanatos market penetration across our business segments and accelerate our growth. We are proud of what we have accomplished and excited for our future as a listed company. As a global operation with 16 sites around the world, we foster a culture that values diversity and respects individual contributions that spark innovation, leadership and exceptional performance. Our strength comes from working together as One Team towards a common goal: enhance the integrity of medicines to help people live a better life. To do so, we work alongside customers, partners and the scientific community to find effective, high-quality solutions to new problems, pushing the limits of knowledge further and further while always keeping the customer and patient at the center of what we do. Along the way, our Values and Guiding Principles provide a framework for our ethical-social responsibilities and ensure our accountability. As with any organization, we have been through some challenging times. There were moments when we modified our plans and changed direction in order to meet the needs of our stakeholders. In those instances, we evaluated, adjusted and altered our approach, reacting to, or sometimes even anticipating, market demands. But we held steadfastly to our belief that the best way to make a difference is by transforming an obstacle into an opportunity for growth. We are now a leading global provider of drug containment, delivery and diagnostic solutions to the biopharma-ceutical and life sciences industries. We deliver an integrated, end-to-end portfolio of products, processes and services that address customer needs across the entire drug life cycle at each of the development, clinical and commercial stages. Our core capabilities in scientific research and development, technical innovation and engineering excellence are central to our ability to offer integrated, value-added solutions to our clients. Through our investments in research and development and with our global reach, we have secured a leadership position in the drug development and delivery value chain. Over our 70-year history, we have earned a leading reputation for high quality and reliability, enabling us to become the partner of choice for more than 700 companies globally, including 41 of the top 50 pharmaceutical companies (which comprise all of the top 15), and eight of the top ten in-vitro diagnostic companies, as measured by 2020 revenue data collected by Global Data. We also serve 15 of the top 20 biotechnology companies by market capitalization in the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index and over 100 biotechnology customers in total. IV |\n\nSustainability Report2021 Our priority is to provide flexible, integrated, end-to-end solutions that preserve the integrity of pharmaceutical products, enabling our customers to deliver safe and effective drug products to patients quickly and efficiently while reducing the time to market, total cost of ownership (i.e., logistic, storage and personnel costs) and supply chain risk. We achieve this by developing our products in partnership with our customers and leveraging our scientific research, technical expertise, engineering and manufacturing excellence in order to meet the exact specifications and quality standards required for their drug products. In 2021, we significantly ramped up our efforts to align Stevanatos corporate culture with relevant environmental, social and governance elements. We are committed to embedding sustainability values into policies and practices and establishing a culture of integrity. We are also dedicated to satisfying our sta- keholders interests and expectations. In this respect, we strive to grow and support our customers while making a positive impact for the benefit of all, in everything we do. We consider ourselves an interdependent and responsible member of the community we live in and, as such, we do our part to promote initiatives and solutions that foster the health and wellbeing of society and the planet. For the first time, we have voluntarily elected to provide complete, transparent non-financial reporting to our stakeholders and investors. Our 2021 Sustainability Report not only considers the Companys financial and economic results, but also highlights the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of the Group. This is our first published Sustainability Report subject to limited assurance and prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, which demonstrates our unwavering commitment to sustainability. V |\n\nSustainability Report2021 In regards to ESG governance, the Board has shown its strong commitment through the constitution of the ESG Committee. Several functions are involved in the management of ESG matters according to each relevant area of accountability. As a baseline, Stevanato Group tackles ESG risks and opportunities in accordance with current legislation and regulations. In the last quarter of 2021, real GDP growth in the euro area slowed down after two quarters of strong expansion but reached its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2021. Hence, GDP is estimated to have increased by 5.2% in 2021 following a 6.4% decline in 2020. The U.S. economy recovered from the recession caused by Covid-19 with GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels as early as mid-2021. Expansionary growth in China, however, remained weak. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Chinas GDP growth rose to 1.6% over the previous quarter, an increase that brought twelve-month growth to 8.1% in 2021. The emergence of the Omicron variant continues to pose risks to growth in the short term. Thus, growth is likely to remain subdued in the first quarter of 2022 as the ongoing pandemic continues to affect economic activity. High uncertainty also stems from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine which erupted at the end of February 2022, posing potentially severe economic consequences. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have increased production capacity to support our customers efforts to provide a rapid response. In this context, we have been providing: (i) glass vials and syringes to approximately 90% of the currently marketed vaccine programs, according to estimates based on public information (WHO, EMA, FDA); and (ii) plastic diagnostic consumables for the detection and diagnosis of COVID19. COVID-19 has generated increased demand for our products and services, further enabling us to accelerate our growth strategy. Going forward, we expect demand for syringes, vials and related products and services to remain elevated as the COVID-19 vaccine and treatment programs continue to roll-out globally, and as our customers contemplate the transition from mul-ti-dose to single-dose formats. In addition, we expect continued tailwinds as epidemic preparedness, including the ongoing global COVID-19 vaccine rollout, booster shot distribution and new vaccination programs, remains a priority for governments. The Company has made meaningful progress and significant milestones were achieved in 2021. None of this would have been possible without the invaluable contribution of our dedicated and passionate employees. We would also like to express our sincere appreciation to Stevanato Groups stakeholdersour suppliers, customers, universities and research centersas well as our shareholders and Board of Directors, communities, local authority and regulators. You have been, and will continue to be, an integral part of our success. Much has been done, but even more is left to do. Challenges are part of our history and the stepping stones to the future we intend to build, day after day. Franco Stevanato Executive Chairman Stevanato Group S.p.A.

The following GRI disclosures have been referenced within this document using a GRI-Referenced approach: 102-1, 102-2, 102-3, 102-4, 102-5, 102-6, 102-7, 102-8, 102-9, 102-10, 102-11, 102-12, 102-13, 102-14, 102-16, 102-18, 102-40, 102-41, 102-42, 102-43, 102-44, 102-45, 102-46, 102-47, 102-48, 102-49, 102-50, 102-51, 102-52, 102-53, 102-54, 102-55, 102-56, 103- 1, 103-2, 103-3, 201-1, 204-1, 205-3, 206-1, 302-1, 303-1, 303-2, 303-3, 303-4, 305-1, 305-2, 306-1, 306-2, 306-3, 307-1, 401-1, 401-2, 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 403-6, 403-7, 403-9, 405-1, 406-1, 413-2, 416-2. For more details, please see the table GRI Content Index in the appendix. The contents of the Report were selected based on the results of a materiality analysis carried out in 2020, which identified the material topics for the Group and its stakeholders published within this document as described in Chapter 2. The materiality analysis included the identification of possible ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) topics relevant to the Group, the prioritization of the topics identified, and their approval by SGs management. Note that the results of the materiality analysis process were examined and approved by the Board of Director at the meeting held on February 18, 2021. In line with the reporting guidelines, the sustainability information presentation reflects the principle of materiality. In regards to the reporting process, a global working group of approximately one hundred individuals was established from across the Group. The working group was coordinated and supported in its endeavors to determine the most significant information per material topic, select the appropriate indicators, collect and validate the narrative, and define the management approach and pertinent data. Specifically, the information included herein was taken both from the Groups IT system and from the sustainability reporting package (data collection sheets and narrative collection forms). Plant managers across the Groups local entities were also asked to identify the most important locally-based projects and initiatives, which were described as required. In order to properly manage the reporting process, a Sustainability Reporting Procedure was set up. It defined and illustrated how to prepare the Groups Sustainability Report in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines issued by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). This procedure also included timing, tools, roles and responsibilities of the functions and individuals. To ensure responsiveness and proper application of the procedures, the reporting process was extensively discussed and agreed upon by the working group. The information presented in this report refers solely to 2021 and includes a comparison with the previous year or past where possible. The information collected and reported is based on measurable data. In addition, in order to correctly present the Groups performance and help to ensure data reliability, the use of estimates has been limited as much as possible. If they are provided, they have been made using the best methods available and are properly identified. The statement presents both positive and negative aspects equally with a comment on the results when appropriate. This report was approved by the Board of Directors of Stevanato Group S.p.A. on April 11, 2022. This document was submitted to a compliance opinion (limited assurance engagement according to the criteria indicated by the ISAE 3000 Revised standard) by Deloitte & Touche S.p.A., which expresses, in a separate report, a certificate of compliance with the GRI Standards. The audit was carried out in accordance with the procedures indicated in the Independent Auditors Report, included in this document.

The familys close ties to the business have been fundamental in allowing the company to expand. It has been able to develop naturally while always understanding the ever-increasing complexity of doing business. As the Group has grown, a structured and skilled management team with international roots has been put into place. Stevanato Group has adopted a corporate governance that sets the rules for the appropriate management of the Group, separating ownership from the operating activities. The Group is managed by the Board of Directors, which meets at least four times per year to make key decisions on reserved topics. The Group is led by an experienced, highly motivated, diverse Board, leading to more objectivity and independence, and an executive team with a proven track record of operational excellence.

The purpose of the Group is to conduct a lawful, ethical, profitable and sustainable business in order to create value over the long term as reported below in the company chart. Stevanato Group 32 |\n\nSustainability Report2021 1.5 Ethics, integrity and compliance An essential factor for success, and an indispensable asset to the Companys reputation, is the adoption of high ethical conduct standards. The Values and Guiding Principles followed by the Group are the building blocks of its Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics defines the guidelines and criteria of conduct for all recipients, and aims to ensure compliance with regulations in force to prevent improper acts or behavior and to help protect the legitimate interests of customers, employees, shareholders, business and financial partners, communities and all the different stakeholder groups. The Code of Ethics has been disseminated in all of Steva-nato Groups companies. Overall, the Code of Ethics has the function of promoting fairness and loyalty in the management of transactions and human relations, within and outside the Group, by those who work on behalf of the Group. The recipients of the Code of Ethics, who are directors, employees, collaborators, suppliers and all those who, in any way, operate on behalf of the Group, are obliged to observe and enforce the provisions contained in it, by adopting the right behavior designed to preserve the Groups image and the integrity of its economic and human heritage. Stevanato Group 34 |\n\nSustainability Report2021 The specific provisions contained in the Code of Ethics have been reported in specific internal policies and procedures that ensure compliance with the principles and guidelines of the Code of Ethics (e.g., anti-corruption, insider trading, related parties and anti-discrimination). In this regard, it should be noted that the Group also approved an anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy on July 2, 2021, and approved an anti-discrimination policy on December 17, 2021. For further details on these policies please refer to the investors section of the corporate website. Stevanato Group acts in compliance with intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights, as well as with international laws and regulations in order to protect such rights. In 2021, no cases of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations were registered. Since April 2021, Stevanato Group has adopted a whistleblowing procedure to correctly manage the reporting of any violations and irregularities concerning the Code of Ethics related to Italian Legal Entities. In this context, Stevanato Group ensures that business is conducted in line with fairness, completeness and transparency of information and legitimacy, excluding any form of corruption or favoritism. Employees can report any violations or suspected violations to the Company through a dedicated email address: csr-complian-ce@stevanatogroup.com. The information transmitted is promptly checked and, once the Report has been verified, the case is submitted to the competent corporate department for the application of any disciplinary sanctions or for the activation of contractual termination mechanisms. This whistleblowing procedure is designed to ensure the confidentiality of the person reporting the issue and the information received, as well as its validity. Note that, no grievances as of December 31, 2021, have been sent to the relevant function inbox and, during 2021, no cases of incidents of corruption or human rights violations were recorded in the Group. In accordance with Italian law, Steva-nato Group has introduced an Organizational, Management and Control model for its Italian entities as per Legislative Decree no. 231/01. The management principles envisaged by the Organizational, Management and Control framework are aimed at preventing the commission of crimes by employees, or any other crimes connected to Stevanato Group that may involve the Groups Italian companies. The Group is currently working to strengthen management systems within the foreign companies to ensure compliance with each local law, taking into consideration the provisions of the Model of Organization, Management and Control pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01. The parent company, Stevanato Group S.p.A., has set up a Supervisory Body pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01, responsible for monitoring compliance, operating and updating the Model. A communication channel has been set up at the e-mail address odv.steva-natogroup@stevanatogroup.com, which only members of the Supervisory Board may access to receive reports of any violations or suspected violations of the Model from internal and external subjects. Stevanato Group 35 |\n\nSustainability Report2021| 2.1 Approach to sustainability Stevanato Group aims to align its corporate culture and business operations with relevant Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) elements pursuing a sustainable corporate model. The Group is committed to embedding sustainability values into its policies and practices and to establishing a culture of integrity. SG believes that the challenge and opportunity is to continue growing and supporting its customers through regenerative business innovation, while making a positive impact for the benefit of all, in everything the Company does. The Group considers itself an interdependent and responsible member of the community it operates in and, as such, promotes initiatives and solutions that foster the health and wellbeing of society and the planet as a whole. As a key player in the pharmaceutical and healthcare market, Stevanato Group is focused on developing and strengthening its sustainability practices. As stated in its EHS policy, Stevanato Group aims to protect the environment, to operate under the principles of sustainability on a global level, and to integrate EHS management into all business processes, including the commitment to energy-saving programs and the optimization of natural resources consumption. In addition, Stevanato Group pursues the Life Cycle Perspective of selected products, packaging and processes as part of its corporate Circular Economy innovation program. As such, it strives to improve the environmental and societal impact of its business through the integration of principles such as: (i) Design out waste and pollution; (ii) Keep products and materials in use; (iii) Regenerate natural systems. These sustainable practices can help mitigate impact in areas such as climate- change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. Finally, Stevanato Group fosters Public-Private co-innovation through collaboration with Universities/ Joint Labs to advance education and awareness on such topics. Through a materiality assessment, the Group has identified the ESG issues most relevant to the organization and its stakeholders. The issues considered have a substantial impact on Stevanato Groups environmental, social and economic performance, or may substantially influence stakeholders decisions. Therefore, as required by the Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Stevanato Group has defined and organized the contents of the Sustainability Report to provide disclosure on how the Group manages sustainability by assessing these material issues. Sustainability 38\n\n2. Core Team refers to the head of main corporate functions. C-suite refers to the Chief executive-level managers within Stevanato Group. Sustainability Report2021 The process conducted by the Group has been developed with reference to the main international standards. First, SG has identified the potentially relevant topics for the company and the main Group stakeholders through an analysis of the context in which the Group operates. The main sources were a benchmarking analysis of peers, online pharmaceutical and healthcare market research, the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board Materiality Map for the company sector, internal documents, policies and commitments, and published rating agency searches. Consequently, a set of 14 relevant sustainability topics were selected and identified. These topics, divided into five categories (environmental responsibility, people responsibility, social responsibility, economic and company responsibility, and clients/product responsibility), were assessed through stakeholder engagement workshops and a remote survey. The main steps followed by the Group are reported in the chart below. Identification of Relevant Topics Analysis of the context in which the Group operates, regarding the reference sector Definition of a list of relevant topics Internal Assessment External Assessment Assessment by Group management Assessment by and internal stakeholders external stakeholder Stevanato Group Materiality Matrix The assessment process involved both internal and external stakeholders in a Core Team and C-suite2 workshop. They were asked to evaluate the relevance of fourteen topics from the perspective of Stevanato Group employees and management. External stakeholders also filled out an online survey with a valuation scale from 1 (not important) to 5 (highly important), and each sustainability topic was evaluated based on its relevance for stakeholders. The feedback gathered confirmed the materiality of all 14 topics. The results of the analysis were examined and approved for the 2021 Sustainability Report by the Board of Directors at a meeting held on February 18, 2021.

On the other hand, certain elements closely associated with human resources, such as occupational health & safety and human capital management and development, highlighted the importance of the Companys policies towards people. In addition, the importance of social and economic topics such as business ethics, governance and compliance, economic performance and value creation, and responsible supply chain and procurement are clear. In terms of environmental responsibility, attention is mainly dedicated to the reduction of environmental impacts for products and processes along with the energy consumption and waste management. Once the Group had identified the 14 material topics, which are the subject of this Sustainability Report, they were linked to specific GRI KPIs with focus on each sustainability area. The preparation of the Groups 2021 Sustainability Report was based on a structured reporting practice formalized through the Sustainability Reporting Procedure. It defines and outlines how to prepare the Groups Sustainability Report at the operational level, in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines issued by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). As discussed and agreed upon, the procedure included timing, tools, roles and responsibilities of the functions and individuals part of the working group (about one hundred individuals across the Group), to ensure the engagement and proper application of such procedure by the working group, it was extensively presented, discussed and commonly agreed.\n\ntical issues emerged from stakeholder engagement activities carried out by Group companies. The following figure provides an overview of Stevanatos seven most relevant stakeholder categories based on an in-depth analysis of the reference sector (peers and customers) carried out during the materiality analysis. Stevanato Group adopts practices that encourage dialogue and involvement with all stakeholder categories. Engagement is considered an essential element of the Groups sustainability strategy and is directly correlated with the Groups medium and long-term success. The main channels of dialogue and interaction are summarized below. The methods and frequency of stakeholder involvement vary according to the issues and opportunities subject to discussion during the year. Employes Shareholders and Board of Directors Regulators and authority Universities and research centres Community and local authority Customers Suppliers Finally, it is important to note that the procedure requires correct and compliant GRI KPIs associated with the involved functions and is coordinated by the Process Owner (Chief Financial Officer) and the Deputy Process Owner (responsible for the duties delegated by the Process Owner), as per assignment by the Board of Directors. Stevanato Group has also aligned its material topics with 15 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the action program of the 193 UN member Countries. Below is a table showing the connection between Stevanato material topics and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Group has adopted flexible and diversified practices to share present and future Group development strategies with its main stakeholders.

The difference between value created and distributed is the economic value retained by Stevanato Group, which goes towards further developing Group business, and is equal to more than 189 million €. In 2021, Stevanato Group directly generated over 865 million € in economic value (+29% in respect to 670 million € in 2020), of which 98% is attributed to busi- ness activity revenue and the remaining 2% is divided in other income, net financial income, income from participation and exchange rate differences. ECONOMIC VALUE DISTRIBUTED TO STAKEHOLDERS CATEGORIES IN PERCENTAGE IN 2021 Total economic value distributed by the Group 675,906 million € 62,74% Suppliers 31,31% Personnel 4,65% Public Administration 1,28% Lenders 0,03% Donations 3. Over the course of 2021, shareholders remuneration was covered by a withdrawal from the extraordinary reserve, thus not affecting the distribution of the economic value generated in 2021. Specifically, during 2021 dividends amounting to 11.2 million € were distributed to shareholders through the use of the extraordinary reserve.\n\nrevenues are reported in both segments and include a detailed breakdown of high-value solutions and other containment and delivery solutions. The figure shows the strong double-digit growth in all business sectors of the Group operational activities, confirming the commitment and efforts of all Group employees. The high-value solutions are complex products, processes and services for which the Group owns the intellectual property rights and has a strong proprietary know-how. 3.2 Key financial results During 2021, the Group continued working actively to support pharma companies in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, it experienced a growth in demand for its high-value solutions as well as other containment and delivery solutions, making 2021 a remarkable year for Stevanato Group with an increase in total revenue of more than 180 million € compared to 2020. The Group demonstrated strong resilience and effective capacity-building in response to the demand, overcoming the difficult challenges of the global situation. Overall, 2021s increase in revenue, together with the investments in production capacity, provided a solid foundation for further growth in 2022 in both of Stevanatos business segments, as analyzed below. Stevanato Groups business segment revenue can be divided into Biophar-maceutical and Diagnostic Solutions and Engineering. In the table below,\n\nIn 2021, Stevanato Group generated approximately 82% of total sales from the Biopharmaceutical and Diagnostic Solutions segment (85% in 2020) and approximately 18% from the Engineering segment (15% in 2020). The increase in Group revenue by 27.5% between 2020 and 2021 was driven by a growth in sales of high-value solutions in our Biopharmaceutical and Diagnostic Solutions segment and strong sales from our Engineering segment. Revenue generated in the Biopharma-ceutical and Diagnostic Solutions segment increased by 129.1 million € (or 22.9%), mainly due to the growth in high-value solutions (with an increase of 42.0% compared to 2020) and a general increase in other containment and delivery solutions (increase of 16.2%). Revenue growth of 54.3% in the Engineering segment was driven by an increase in sales in all business lines of the segment (glass converting, vi- sual inspection machinery, assembly platforms and secondary packaging machinery) as well as from after-sales business. Considering the global presence of the Group, the total revenue can be divided into four different geographical areas: EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific), North America and South America. Revenue shows an increase in all the geographic markets with the highest growth in the APAC market (+75.4%). Revenue increased by 18.3% in North America, by 17.8 % in South America, and by 23.9% in Europe, the Groups traditional market. From these results, it is possible to confirm the Groups capacity to strengthen its presence in almost all geographical regions, enter new markets, extend existing business relationships, and launch new solutions to consolidate positioning in markets with excellent growth prospects.

In 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic caused both governments and private organizations to implement numerous measures seeking to contain the spread of the virus. These measures impacted, and are expected to continue impacting, the Groups business and operations in several ways. Initially, unfavorable short-term impacts of COVID-19 on production and operational capabilities mainly included: (i) a temporary decrease in the sales of certain non-COVID-19 products as a result of traditional healthcare procedures being postponed and the diversion of our production capacity to support the rollout of the COVID 19 vaccine worldwide; (ii) labor absenteeism; (iii) disruptions to production lines; (iv) delays in, and increased costs of, logistics. However, COVID-19 also provided an uplift to the Groups business with an acceleration of revenue from the sale of syringes and vials for vaccination programs globally. Stevanato Group has been supplying: (i) glass vials and syringes to approximately 90% of currently marketed vaccine programs, according to our estimates based on public information (WHO, EMA, FDA); and (ii) plastic diagnostic consumables for the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19. Going forward, the Group expects demand for syringes, vials and related products and services to remain elevated as the COVID-19 vaccine and treatment programs continue to roll-out globally, and as customers contemplate the transition from multi-dose formats to single-dose formats. In addition, the Group expects continued tailwinds as epidemic preparedness, including the ongoing global COVID-19 vaccine rollout, booster shot distribution and new vaccination programs, remain a priority for governments. Longer-term, there remains uncertainty around the magnitude of the impact of COVID-19 and the demand for our solutions. Many scientists predict that COVID-19 will eventually transition to an endemic state. While timing of this transition is difficult to predict, experts believe that the transition may likely occur over the next twelve to twenty-four months. This may result in a continued need and relatively stable demand for the Groups products and services related to COVID-19, which would be integrated into the standard vaccine business in the coming years.\n\nSustainability Report2021 When it comes to ready-to-fill products, no solution matches Stevanato Groups EZ-fill®.

The two R&D divisions cooperate in perfect synergy in terms of maximizing value creation and accomplishing cross-functional projects. The mutual strategy of Stevanato Groups R&D department is based on three fundamental pillars that focus and align the R&D team with the Companys business growth: These three pillars are the guidelines of the Groups R&D divisions: each R&D project is designed to contribute and support one or more of these pillars. 4.2.1 R&D FOR DRUG CONTAINMENT SOLUTIONS (DCS) The R&D team of the Biopharmaceuti-cal and Diagnostic Solutions segment is responsible for the development of many important Stevanato Group products and features, including the Drug Containment Solutions (DCS) portfolio. Regarding the first pillar, the DCS team is continuously developing syringes, vials and cartridges with the lowest particle generation, reduced or even no extractable release, and a metal-free option. In addition, the team is responsible for the improvement of deep freeze/dead volume properties of Stevanato solutions to refine the Vaccine and Gene Therapies application. To deliver superior quality Process Excellence & Digitalization, the Drug Containment So- lutions team is working on different assignments, among which, the development of a unique identification and serialization of individual containers, the integration of Artificial Intelligence to improve visual inspection, and the use of virtual prototypes that accelerate development of inspection and assembly. Finally, the DCS team projects also contribute to the development of Drug Delivery Systems patient-centricity, sustainability and digitalization, especially by providing the best primary packaging fully compatible with the devices under development. The main innovations included in the Drug containment solutions portfolio are: ALBA® Platform ALBA® is a sterile glass container platform including vials, and syringes with equivalent chemical and mechanical characteristics. All the ALBA® products have an internal lubricant layer which is cross-linked with the surface of the glass. The advantage given by this innovative platform is in limiting the quantity of silicone that is then released by the primary container, thereby improving both the quality and safety of the final product. Furthermore, the superior stability of the lubricant layer ensures no failures with self-administration injection related to auto injector applications, allowing for improved compliance with therapies. ALBA® involves several different internal and external companies with competences that range from design and testing to manufacturing. In 2021, its main activities were focused on assessing alternative grades of silicone as coating materials, thus obtaining an even more improved and reproducible product.\n\nIntegrated Safety System (ISS) The Integrated Safety System is an advanced, fully passive shield that prevents needle-stick injuries. ISS Integrated Safety System aims to offer a pre-assembled system ensuring passive needle protection after the injection of medicinal products for use in both hospital and household environments. It benefits not only the end-user thanks to its simple user experience and its intuitive application, but also the pharma-company with a reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). It is an active project that involves more than twenty different internal and external companies which represent the full spectrum of expertise, from Safety System design development to industrial production. In 2021, the first commercial product based on our ISS system was approved by Regulatory Authorities and launched on the market. Primary Container Traceability This project permits the traceability of the container in every part of the manufacturing process. Every container can be marked with a unique serial number identifier and traced with a 2D barcode-reading machine. Primary Container Traceability enables the manufacturers to improve the drug life cycle by facilitating the tracking of potential issues within each process stage, preventing product mix-ups, permitting segregation in the event of a process issue, improving patient safety and maintaining ownership of the products identity even if the packaging/label has been damaged. Feasibility studies of the concept have been completed, allowing next steps to be taken in project development. In addition, Stevanato Group began looking into sustainability measures as part of its corporate Circular Economy innovation program. In particular, projects were mobilized to identify alternative materials and processes that would provide more sustainable sterilization techniques while maintaining the overall performance of materials post-sterilization cycle. The possibility of identifying the best material to be used across different products and sterilization conditions would give the Group a significant advantage in terms of simplifying and improving its long-term supply chain. SG is also actively collaborating with the scientific community and universities to advance its scientific insight into the Groups current and prospective product line, as well as to provide its customers with the latest know-how on specific products. In certain research areas, including chemical-physical and morphological characterization of glass surfaces and drug interactions, we cooperate with universities such as Ca Fo-scari University (Venice, Italy), Federico II University (Naples, Italy), the National University of Ireland Mynooth (Ireland), and the University of Trento (Italy). 4.2.2 R&D ON DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS (DDS) In addition to the activities related to Drug Containment Solutions, a fundamental responsibility of Biopharma-ceutical and Diagnostic Solutions R&D is the development and expansion of Stevanato Groups Drug Delivery Sy- stems (DDS) portfolio. This includes developing innovative delivery solutions that are focused on usability, safety, performance and manufacturability. The main projects on which the department is working are the following:\n\nAlina® is a disposable, multi-dose pen injector platform for subcutaneous administration of injectable therapy. The platform is available in variable and fixed-dose versions compatible with established therapeutic regimens as well as innovative drug therapies related to diabetes care. The project involves multiple SG sites and functions and an international design and development team. An Auto-injector Platform is critical to the growth strategy of Stevanato Groups integrated offering. This is supported by the ongoing market demand for auto-injector solutions. The R&D team continues to assess various auto-injector technologies, including both non-emergency use and emergency-use devices, while considering its environmental footprint as a key determinant of product suitability. Stevanato Groups Wearable Product is designed for subcutaneous delivery of non-opioid anesthetics. The device enables controlled self-administration of therapy while reducing unnecessary hospital stays. The re-usable cradle component extends the lifespan of the product to multiple-u-ses and reduces product waste for a more sustainable device solution. This is the first of many steps in SGs corporate Circular Economy innovation program. The overall concept of this wearable product can be extended to a platform capable of large volume delivery from different cartridges. ICOcap® is a capsule-based dry-powder inhaler for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory-related diseases. It has similar performance to established inhalers on the market while offering improved handling features. The project involves multiple SG sites and functions and an international design and development team. 4.2.3 R&D ON ENGINEERING To advance R&D in the Engineering segment, the Group has invested in the latest equipment and expanded its lines and services to improve production and best serve its customers in four main product areas: Glass tube Converting, Visual Inspection, Assembly and Packaging. The Engineering department aims to achieve high performance and to understand internal and external expectations in order to clearly guide product development in the following directions:  High performance: line and equipment capable of achieving superior operating performance in the long term (OEE, Overall Equipment Effectiveness) whilst being cost effective and reducing the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership).  Quality and reliability: completion of the portfolio range based on modular architecture with the main target being a stable platform able to minimize planned, and avoid unplanned, downtime.\n\n Smart and connected equipment and lines: development of smart solutions by building machine intelligence into equipment via features like prediction, aided guidance and self-adjustment. Machines and lines are connected in a cyber-secure way to the cloud where big data technology can generate valuable information through advanced data analytics. The Deep Learning models embedded in the visual inspection solutions provide customers with an efficient system to assist them in significantly reducing the FRR (False Rejection Rate) and increasing the DR (Detection Rate). The Engineering quality control systems are designed to ensure that the manufacturing processes, including those of pharma customers and contracted manufacturing companies, comply with Generic Good Practice (GxP) standards based on the Good Automated Manufacturing Practice (GAMP) guidelines issued by the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE). Each individual piece of machinery/equipment is developed and manufactured as a project and ad-hoc project management tools are utilized to manage every stage and minimize risk. Similarly to the Biopharmaceutical and Diagnostic Solutions R&D division, the Engineering division contributes to the three R&D pillars, in particular, to Process Excellence & Digitalization. Below are the main projects under Engineering R&D essential to promoting innovation and increasing Stevanato Groups competitiveness and market share. Smart Factories  the Group has designed its production plants to be highly interconnected with the objective of:  Performance monitoring thanks to an automatic real-time data acquisition system that continuously controls the performance of equipment and lines. The system is equipped with a simple and intuitive user interface on fixed and portable devices, and is fully integrated with the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) equipment at all levels, from shop floor to corporate offices.  Improvement in solving capabilities with equipment that, in case of a problem, offers step-by-step guidance via accelerated Root Cause Analysis (RCA). After the analysis, the equipment guides the operator through the problem resolution process and stores all the pertinent\n\nSustainability Report2021 information in a Big Data repository in order to improve the next RCA.  Improvement in predicting capabilities through the constant analysis and evaluation of data and operating parameters in machines and lines, helping to anticipate future downtime.  Automatic adjustment via equipment capable of setting optimal ranges for glass formation without the need of operator expertise. Also maintains long-term high-quality production while minimizing energy consumption.  Video Remote Assistance with real-time video support from a remote technician able to assist the on-site operator dealing with a machine operation problem.  Artificial Intelligence applied to Visual Inspection  Stevanato Group has started using artificial intelligence (AI) in visual inspection to address the problem of false rejects. AI enables the system to correlate the actual image of the product under inspection with a vast library of similar images of accepted and rejected products, thereby identifying the likelihood of it belonging to one of the categories. The phar-ma industry has been actively studying this technology over the past two years and Stevanato Group is among the forerunners, with the expectation of increasing its market share in the future.  With standard visual technology, operators use classical parameters of measurement, using their own experience and taking samples from production. False rejects are the inevitable trade-off of having access to a limited set of samples. Sometimes good products are rejected out of extreme caution. Research 76 |\n\nDigital Twin the device is a virtual replica of a machine or line with examples of application on both Assembly and Visual Inspection. The customer can review its performance and interact virtually with the equipment before going into production. By experiencing the machine in advance, the customer can anticipate possible problems and reduce the production time needed once a decision is made. The digital twin can also be used both as a promotional tool and as a substitute for a possible test phase. Vision Robot Unit the Visual Robot Unit represents a new product within the product portfolio of Stevanato Groups Pharma Vision area. It consists of a new type of automatized production machine that allows for flexibility during manual inspection along with the replicability and stability given by automatic equipment. It aims to address two main market needs: the demand for improved inspection performance and an extremely flexible unit to satisfy low-volume markets. The objective is to allow the Group to increase its position within emerging markets determined by low-production output per minute and high value of the product to be inspected. New SW and HW Platform for Inspection Equipment4 SG heavily invested in a new SW platform in 2021 aiming to improve performance and increase customer satisfaction. The platform merges know-how from both InnoScan and Optrel brands, whose combined resources have advanced overall efficiency and reduced timelines for the final customer. Moreover, the new SW platform leverages a series of new inspection tools which can improve the final DR (Detection Rate) and FRR (False Rejection Rate). Lines development improvements SG is developing new lines with the purpose of reducing capital expenditures and industrial costs, increasing productivity and improving in-line quality control. Such projects also involve syringe systems production. 4. CVT, CVT Sy and CVT Core Research 77 |\n\nSustainability Report2021 Assembly | CollectQX data collection tool: CollectQX was developed in cooperation with a pharmaceutical company to create the best solution for data analysis, easy interface and future implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The unique tool is useful for the Group during running-in as well as for customer operations, maintenance and data analytics (please see the image below to better understand the project scope). The Engineering R&D projects noted above involved more than 30 highly-skilled employees. Batch Recipe Quality checks/-data Machine ID Product ID Workposition ID All Parameter Serialization ID Timestamp(s) All connected to each single Datapoint 4.2.4 ANALYTICAL SERVICES Another important branch in R&D for Ste-vanato Group is Lab Analytics. Its goal is to investigate and analyze chemical-physical phenomena and study the interactions between containers and drugs. In 2012, SG Lab started out as a laboratory staffed by a small group of young scientists, whose ranks soon began to grow. Today, SG Lab has a staff of more than 15 people including researchers, scientists, engineers, laboratory technicians and people in charge of ISO 17025 and, starting in 2021, ISO 13485 quality-systems management. The team can rely on members trained in the fields of chemistry, engineering, physics and pharmaceutical sciences who are able to examine and define each aspect of a drug product. Their knowledge ranges from add-on components to the performance of glass primary containers and how they interact with the drug. They also have a series of skills acquired and developed in the study and analysis of drug-container closure system and delivery devices. Staff training and development has always been a fundamental part of Stevanato Groups agenda. The Group continues to invest in modern analytical instruments and in the acquisition of new skills, both internally and through external collaboration with universities and analytical excellence centers. Its personnel can rely on a solid knowledge base and a technical-scientific approach, enabling it to tackle future challenges with confidence. Research 78\n\nSustainability Report2021 US TEC AT THE HEART OF THE BIOTECH COMMUNITY, BRINGING VALUE TO STEVANATO GROUPS LABORATORY SERVICES To respond to the growing demand in the US biologics market for integrated analytical offerings and project management services, in September 2020 Stevanato Group established a Boston-based laboratory and Technology Excellence Center (TEC). US TEC can be considered an additional R&D and investigational testing facility. Its services can help determine new ways of improving product quality or identify the cause of any current quality issues. The laboratory is modelled after the SG Laboratories (with the same QMS system) and provides a full-service approach to support biopharma companies along their drug development journey, from the early phase to commercialization and lifecycle management. Leveraging the Groups extensive knowledge in materials science of glass, plastics and rubber, US TEC supports one of the most critical decisions for biopharma industry players: how to select the optimum glass container. Making the right choice during the early-stage of product development ensures two-fold compatibility: Drug and Container Closure System as well as Container Closure System integration into Drug Delivery Systems. Since R&D represents a key driver for Stevanato Groups growth, the US TEC advises on materials science, chemistry and engineering performance. Located in the cradle of the biotech region, US TEC easily integrates into the product development team and the value chain of local customers. In addition to supporting Stevanato Groups existing large company partners, US TEC offers an opportunity for new, smaller to mid-sized companies to collaborate with the Groups wide offering. The long-term objective of US TEC is providing a continuum of representation from container to device management. Research 79 |\n\nSustainability Report2021 Everyone in Stevanato Group, from senior management to individual employees, is accountable and strives to ensure the continuous improvement and effectiveness of Stevanato Group Quality Management System and Steva-nato Group Quality Policy. FOCUS ON QUALITY Among all its Drug Containment Solutions plants worldwide, the Group provides the same quality of product. The main advantage of this feature is that it best supports business continuity for SG customers: by producing the exact same product worldwide, with documented corporate audits, the company is able to manage risk mitigation and offer production flexibility. To reach the same level of quality across all SG sites, the Group ensures continuous alignment among its plants through product experts in Operational Excellence and Quality that support each site in case of issues, creating a portfolio of knowledge that is continuously shared among the sites. Regular trainings and discussions within the quality department allow all sites to stay up-to-date in both product quality and quality compliance, and keep abreast of industry trends in order to meet the highest regulatory and quality compliance standards. In general, the impact of product quality and responsibility is directly related to Stevanato Groups activities. In fact, the primary goal for everyone involved in the production process is linked with Stevanato Groups mission to create systems that enhance the integrity of parenteral medicines, ensuring maximum quality of the primary packaging. For example, pharmaceutical containers are integral to the pharmaceutical product itself, therefore their quality affects patient safety. In this regard, all employees are accountable for following Stevanato Group Quality Management System in order to maximize the quality and integrity of its products. Drug containment, diagnostic and delivery solutions are often borne out of years of collaboration with customers to develop the optimal manner of containing a drug product and delivering it to the patient community. The customized solutions provided vary depending on the characteristics and chemical composition of the pharmaceutical products, logistics needs (for example, ease of transport and shelf-life), factors such as the patient community to which the drug product is primarily addressed (including, potentially, its geographic location) and specific regulatory requirements. The containment and delivery solution provided is an integral part of the drug product itself and is included as part of the regulatory filings required to approve drug product marketing and commercialization. The quality and dependability of drug containment and delivery solutions is critical to obtaining commercialization and marketing approval from regulatory agencies. As a result, it is often the case that drug product containment and delivery solution cannot be changed without amending the regulatory filings that have been specifically approved by the relevant regulatory agency. During 2021, there were no incidents of non-compliance with regulations and/ or voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services within the reporting period.
