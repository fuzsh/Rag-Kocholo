        "text": "​The Murideo SIX-G is an HDMI pattern generator intended for the AV integration market to confirm HDMI 2.0(b) and HDCP 2.2 operation at the 18 Gbps level. Additionally, the SIX-G is an excellent field troubleshooting tool for distributed high bandwidth HDMI systems and a reference source for video calibration.\n\nThe handheld device is portable thanks to a built-in battery and can generate over 100 different test patterns for setup, calibration and troubleshooting. There’s a three-inch color display with simplified menus as well as free PC control software. The SIX-G also features Hot Plug Detect, EDID read/write functionality and the ability to create custom resolutions. There’s the option for either RS232 or USB control and support for CalMAN and Light Illusion calibration software. The SIX-G is the only unit to carry the complete suite of ISF test patterns, select-able color output level, RGB Triplets and Constant APL (Average Picture Level) all in one place, making it a calibrators dream. The SIX-G is ISF Labs and DPL Labs certified, the firmware is field upgradable, and it even includes audio confidence tests.\n\nPair the SIX-G with the SIX-A Analyzer and you have the most powerful (and affordable) HDMI system troubleshooting system on the planet!\n\nNEW: Custom Pattern Uploader & Library Now Available!\n\nThe SIX-G just got more powerful! Now you can upload any image/pattern you want in 1920x1080 format. The uploader will store the pattern in one of the 10 available \"slots\" for recall later. It will even upload the thumbnail to the LCD screen. It supports .jpeg, .png, .bin and .bmp. We are proud to bring you this enhancement based on your feedback.\n\nAlong with it comes a complete Pattern Library with patterns from various sources including the ISF in various resolutions. You can access them all for free and use them as you wish. Note, even though the library has many resolutions including UHD and 4K patterns, the Pattern Uploader only supports 1920x1080 at this time.\n\nYou can access the the Pattern Uploader & Library at our new, consolidated, downloads page.\n\nSIX-G Features:\n\nHDMI 2.0 Support\n\n600 Mcsc - 2160P @60 4:4:4 Maximum Resolution\n\nColor Space Selectable\n\nFull Range RGB (0-255)\n\nSMPTE RGB (16-235)\n\nYC444, 422, 420 (16-235)\n\nAuto Detect (read EDID – display preferred format)\n\nHigh Bit Depth – 8, 10, 12, and 16 bit per pixel support\n\nHDR (High Dynamic Range) Support\n\nMultiple HDR Memories\n\nHDR 10, 10+\n\nHLG\n\nDolby Vision – includes go/no-go test\n\nCustom HDR Memory\n\nBT. 2020 Wide Color Gamut (WCG) Support\n\nHDCP Content Type Selectable\n\nType 0 – Type 0 content can pass over any version of HDCP ( 1.X or 2.X) – like 1080P – all 1080P content is type 0.\n\nType 1 – Type 1 content requires mandatory HDCP 2.2 – will not pass over any 1.X infrastructure. Most 4K UHD movies at type 1.\n\nScramble Mode Selectable\n\nSelect 1 for testing TMDS Character Rates >340 Mcsc (over 10.2 Gbps)\n\nSelect 0 for testing TMDS Character Rates <340 Mcsc (under 10.2 Gbps)\n\nNote: Scrambling for EMI/RFI Reduction. Scrambling is done in all the three data channels ­- TMDS channels 0, 1, and 2. EMI/RFI reduction in the TMDS clock channel is achieved by reducing clock frequency to one-fourth and reducing the clock amplitude. By default, the scrambling is enabled in HDMI 2.0 at TMDS bit rates above 3.4 Gbps to 6.0 Gbps. The Source enables scrambling for TMDS rates below 3.4 Gbps if both the Source and the Sink support scrambling at that TMDS character rate.\n\nFull 10-Bit RGB Triplet Generator (0-1024 RGB)\n\nHDCP Selectable – Off, HDCP 2.2 or HDCP 1.X\n\nHot Plug Detect Indicator\n\nISF Labs Certified\n\nDPL Labs Certified\n\nEDID Read and Save functionality\n\nMultiple EDID Memories\n\nRead and Display EDID (short form on device, long form on PC)\n\nEmulate any display\n\nUSB Control and free PC software\n\nAPI (Application Programming Interface) Available\n\nReference Source / Auto-Control for CalMAN, Light Illusion, and Argyll color calibration software.\n\nPortable - Battery Operated > Rechargeable batteries included make field troubleshooting much easier.\n\nOptimized Ergonomics – 3” LCD display and simple menu system makes SIX-G very user friendly.\n\nISF Test Patterns including contrast, brightness, color, tint, sharpness and more\n\nMulti-cultural family pattern for verifying flesh tones\n\nPattern Uploader\n\n4K 1:78 (16x9) Geometry Patterns in all 4K frame rates\n\nIncludes audio confidence test tones > to make sure audio is active on the HDMI line"
