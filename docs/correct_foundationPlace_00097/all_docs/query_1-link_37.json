        "text": "Apple TV streaming service will be available in more than 100 countries next years. This is what some reports from Cnbc and The Information declared in the latest days. According to these reports, the service will launch in the US in the first half of 2019 and in other 100 countries after a few months and will make Apple a competitor with Amazon Prime Video and Netflix.\n\nWhat is the service going to be about and how will it work? Let’s analyze together.\n\nApple TV streaming service: what is it?\n\nApple is planning to launch a new digital video service for all Apple’s owners next year.\n\nApple TV streaming service may work on a standalone app or within the existing TV app and will mix original content, given away for free to device owners, and subscription services, which will allow them to subscribe for online services, offered by network and cable providers.\n\nAccording to the project lines, every people owning an Apple device, as an iPhone, an iPad or an Apple TV, will access the service with a preinstalled TV app. In this way, Apple will reach two goals together: on one hand, people could access exclusive content while remaining in Apple, on the other hand, the company can enter a new market and gain new customers.\n\nAn idea coming from the past\n\nApple’s idea to bring television into the digital age is not new.\n\nSeven years ago, Walter Isaac wrote that Steve Jobs revealed him this idea to crack streaming like Apple already did for digital media and other smartphone apps. By the way, until today, nothing changed for Apple’s users in this sector, while other companies as Amazon and Netflix have built, in the meanwhile, strong “empires”, by mixing original programming and licensed content.\n\nNow Apple appears to be finally ready to change this route.\n\nApple TV streaming service: strengths and weakness of this project"
