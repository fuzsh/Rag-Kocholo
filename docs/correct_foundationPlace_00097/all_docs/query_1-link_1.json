        "text": "Prioritizing preventative care services is crucial for maintaining a healthy and happy household. In this blog, we will explore six practical tips on how to make the most of your preventative care services and create a thriving household.\n\nâ\n\n1. Establish a Strong Doctor-Patient Relationship:Â\n\nThe foundation of effective preventative care lies in having a reliable and trustworthy healthcare provider. Even if youâve been with the same practice for years, ask yourself, âAm I pleased? Does this doctor have my best interest at heart? Are they trying to get to the bottom of my symptoms to help me be the healthiest version of myself?â\n\nâ\n\nTake the time to research and choose a primary care physician who aligns with your family's values and needs. Building a strong doctor-patient relationship fosters open communication, encourages transparency, and allows for personalized preventive care plans tailored to your family's unique circumstances.\n\nâ\n\nIf youâre not sure where to start when trying to find a new physician, start with your trusted circle of friends and peers, look at reviews on multiple sites to gain perspective, and of course be sure the physician is in your health plans network.Â\n\nâ\n\n2. Schedule Regular Check-ups:\n\nRegular check-ups are the cornerstone of preventative care. Make it a priority to schedule routine visits for every family member, even if they appear to be in good health. These visits allow healthcare professionals to conduct thorough assessments, identify potential health risks, and provide guidance on lifestyle modifications that can prevent future complications.Â\n\nâ\n\nIf youâre unsure what is considered a preventative care visit, refer to your health plan summary of details or call the customer service number on the back of your insurance card. For each member of your family, these visits will look different and have a different frequency. For example, children visit the doctor for preventative care more often than middle-aged adults.Â\n\nâ\n\nStaying on top of your preventative care visits will help you stay ahead of serious health diagnoses, help prevent human suffering, and help decrease the amount of time off youâll need in the future. Studies show that workers who avoid medical care, end up missing more work because of serious illness down the road. Remember, prevention is always better than cure!Â\n\nâ\n\n3. Stay Up-to-date with Vaccinations:\n\nVaccinations are a critical aspect of preventative care, especially for children. You can find the recommended schedule for childhood vaccinations by the American Academy of Pediatrics HERE. Most often these visits are covered by insurance programs and would be considered part of your child's preventative and wellness checks.Â\n\nâ\n\nEnsure that everyone in your household receives age-appropriate vaccinations according to the recommended immunization schedule for adults set by the Centers for Disease Control. Vaccinations protect against a variety of illnesses, preventing the spread of diseases within your family and the wider community.Â\n\nâ\n\n4. Screenings and Preventative Tests:\n\nMany health conditions can be detected early through screenings and preventative tests. Keep track of recommended screenings such as mammograms, pap smears, cholesterol checks, blood pressure monitoring, and colonoscopies. Your physician can provide you with a detailed list of screenings they would recommend for someone your age.Â\n\nâ\n\nOnce again, avoiding medical care for routine exams can lead to late diagnosis, increased pain and suffering, limited care options, and lastly decreased survival rates for serious illnesses. Discuss these tests with your healthcare provider and ensure that your family members undergo them at the recommended intervals.Â\n\nâ\n\nAccording to Healthy People, a federal program administered by the United States Department of Health and Human Services,Â\n\nâ\n\nâroutine cardiovascular exams alone save tens of thousands of adult lives each year.âÂ\n\nâ\n\nRemember, early detection often leads to more successful treatment outcomes and a happier and healthier household.\n\nâ\n\n5. Prioritize a Healthy Lifestyle:\n\nPreventative care extends beyond doctor visits. Encourage your household to adopt a healthy lifestyle by emphasizing regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep. Engage in physical activities together, prepare nutritious meals as a family, and create a conducive environment for restful sleep.Â\n\nâ\n\nThere are several ways for you to start your health journey, a local nutritionist is just one suggestion. This specialist can work with your physician and can work with you to craft a personalized health plan for you and your family based on individual needs.Â\n\nâ\n\nThe same goes for regular exercise, you donât have to join an expensive gym or hire a pricey trainer, although those are great options, you can start small. Ask around in your community for local meet-ups, walking/running clubs, and the like. Youâd be surprised how many people are just wanting a little accountability like yourself.Â\n\nÂ\n\nThese lifestyle habits will significantly reduce the risk of chronic diseases and promote overall well-being for your family.Â\n\nâ\n\n6. Mental Health Matters:\n\nDon't forget about the importance of mental health in preventative care. Encourage open conversations about emotions, and stress management techniques, and seek professional help when necessary.Â\n\nâ\n\nAccording to a study in Forbes Health, âIn 2020â¦only 37.4% of males received mental health servicesâ Life is difficult at times and we all need an outlet, we cannot let the âmental healthâ stigma be attached to such care that so greatly impacts our daily life.\n\nâ\n\nIncreased stress leads to poor work performance, strained relationships, and increased health concerns. Consult with your insurance provider to see what mental health services are available under your preventative care plan.\n\nâ\n\nPrioritize activities that promote relaxation, such as mindfulness exercises, hobbies, and spending quality time together as a family will help to lighten the mental load and teach better self-control when stressful situations do arise.Â\n\nâ\n\nBy embracing preventative care services, your household can lay the foundation for a lifetime of good health and well-being. Take charge of your wellness journey by building a strong relationship with your healthcare provider, scheduling regular check-ups, staying up-to-date with vaccinations and screenings, and adopting a healthy lifestyle.Â\n\nâ\n\nRemember, prevention is the key to a happy and thriving household. Start today, and let preventative care be your family's guiding light toward a brighter future!\n\nâ\n\nTo review Meridioâs affordable health offering visit: getmeridio.com\n\nâ"
