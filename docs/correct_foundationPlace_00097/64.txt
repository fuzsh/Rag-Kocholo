Description

POSITION

Tenuta Meridio is a complex of three buildings, situated in an exceptionally unique location, at the heart of the Val d’Orcia, one of the most picturesque regions of Tuscany. Surrounded by gentle green hills and lush vineyards, the property offers breathtaking panoramic views of golden wheat fields and olive groves stretching as far as the eye can see. The landscape is punctuated only by solitary cypress trees and dirt roads winding through the hills. Its strategic location, between Pienza and San Quirico d’Orcia, allows for cultural excursions to Pienza, San Quirico d’Orcia, Monticchiello, Montalcino, Montepulciano, and Siena. The estate is accessible via a scenic road that traverses the valley, offering visitors a journey immersed in the natural beauty and tranquility of the Tuscan countryside. This privileged position allows guests to enjoy the peace and serenity of the UNESCO World Heritage landscape.

GARDEN AND OUTDOOR SPACE

For all three buildings, the outdoor space consists of a large garden, providing the property with a unique connection to the surrounding landscape. The typical cypress trees, offering shaded areas where you can relax or spend time in good company, gently caressed by a light breeze, make these spaces even more pleasant and refreshing. Tenuta Meridio also features two swimming pools with panoramic views, a biolake, also with panoramic views, that immerses you in nature, offering a unique experience, and an outdoor hot tub to fully enjoy moments of pure relaxation. In summary, the true wealth of this magnificent property is undoubtedly the outdoor space, which makes it unique in its kind.

What is the Energy Efficiency Rating?

The energy efficiency rating is a value expressed by letters ranging from A4 to G which indicates the energy quality and consumption of the building based on parameters such as the shape and climate zone in which it is located. The better the energy efficiency rating, the lower the energy consumption and cost of air-conditioning the building. Please note: buildings belonging to the same class can also have very different energy consumptions if the shape and climate zone are different.

What is the EPgl (Global Energy Performance index)?

The EPgl indicates how much energy is consumed so that the building or the building unit reaches comfort conditions, and is based on the energy services present and according to the type of property under standard use. The unit of measurement is kWh/m2 per year.
