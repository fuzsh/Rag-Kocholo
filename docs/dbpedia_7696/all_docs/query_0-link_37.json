        "text": "Summary\n\nChernow's goal is to make Washington as close to the living, breathing figure he was to his contemporaries, rather than the lifeless role model he is today to most people. He was only able to achieve so much because he could bottle and funnel his intense emotion to his noble cause\n\nThe Rabbit Hole is written by Blas Moros.

Original Design by Thilo Konzok.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nWashington always sought to conceal his feelings and not express too much emotion. He was a master at controlling his emotions but when he cracked, he was full of great wrath. Opacity was his means for influence and shaping events. He commanded respect from all because people knew how emotional and passionate he was, yet how well he managed these emotions. He possessed the gift of listening and self command but only after work hard at attaining these traits\n\nWashington's great grandfather was a successful military man who later came to possess thousands of acres in Virginia and this wealth would be eventually passed down to George. Washington's father remarried to Marry Ball after his first wife died and she would have a tremendous influence on George. She was a very moral woman who stood strong in times adversity but had a temper. Washington's father died young and forced Washington to take much responsibility at a young age. His mother was tough and they did not have a loving relationship. She made George uneasy with criticism and emotionally closed. His older brother Lawrence was a great influence on him and pushed him to pursue a military career\n\nWashington is an incredible case of self improvement as he had little to no formal education but was self taught through books and experience. Washington is a story of self construction. Washington was also a physical specimen - taller than 6' with almost comically large hands and feet, athletic, graceful and a good dancer\n\nWashington's first job was as a land surveyor and this would influence his future love of land and land speculation\n\nAlready by the age of 22 Washington had distinguished himself militarily and politically but a skirmish with the French almost ruined his reputation. However, he acted bravely and his reputation was soon restored. He learned early on the effectiveness of guerrilla type warfare that the Native Americans fought. Washington had to learn to mask his ambition as he too often butted heads with more senior leaders. He often felt slighted by the British military traditions and was sometimes passed for deserving promotions\n\nEarly on Washington decided it was of utmost importance to have a loyal and well trained army. He was able to take a ragtag group and instill some training and order into this already courageous group. He came to love his men and through his leadership and courage on the battlefield, his men came to love him too - was able to get the most out of his men\n\nWashington married Martha Dandridge Custis, a short, wealthy widow with a warm, even temperament. She had two children, Jackie and Patsy, who Washington adopted. The oldest son, Jackie, was a jet setter and ignored the education Washington so badly wanted as a youth. Patsy died young and caused her parents much grief but it gave Washington a sizable inheritance which helped a lot with his large debt and to expand Mt. Vernon. He had no children of his own\n\nWashington was strict but relatively fair and humane with his slaves\n\nWashington was extremely prompt and believed a judicious and efficient use of time was a sure path to success\n\nThe Tea Party was a seminal moment as it furthered the colonists' aversion to taxation without representation. Washington, having been out of the military since his glory days of the French and Indian War, took an important political position at this time and much frustration with the British began bubbling over in him and advocated a petition of British goods and perhaps even military action. Washington was soon elected to the First Continental Congress. He was soon after unanimously elected to be the commander in chief of the continental army once it was assembled. His wealth and self command made him a popular choice. His ragtag army from every corner of the colonies was difficult to unite and train but they showed more courage and will than any other army. There were many other obstacles too such as lack of gunpowder, fewer fit men than he had anticipated and much more. His self command was vital at this time in order to keep his men optimistic even though he knew how dismal the situation looked. Secrecy and deception were key tools he used throughout the war. Washington saw the war as a struggle of good vs evil and urged his men to treat POW humanely and to be a model citizen for all the colonies. Creating a draft was not politically possible at this time and Washington eventually decided to bar slaves from serving but free blacks were allowed in\n\nWashington was careful but a bit unorthodox in his selection of high ranking generals. General Greene had almost no military experience and General Knox was very overweight. Washington bucked his aristocratic streak and gave promising men the opportunity to rise and learn although they didn't seem to have the credentials. Nearly all the men he chose performed admirably. Washington excelled as a leader because he was able to select the men he saw as most able and then get the most out of them. After the war, Washington assembled one of the most impressive and effect cabinet members in history, notably Hamilton as Secretary of Treasury and Jefferson as Secretary of State\n\nThomas Paine's Common Sense energized a demoralized American army and the populace for American independence\n\nWashington was able to win back Boston from the British by setting up cannons in the middle of the night and scaring the British. This was a great victory with no deaths and Washington was praised the country over\n\nThe American army were getting beat early but Washington pulled some military magic and got some much needed victories at Trenton and Princeton. Washington portrayed a mystique and energy which won him over the admiration and respect of every man under his command\n\nHamilton was very young when he became Washington's aide de camp and helped extensively with any written correspondence. They made a great team but their very different personalities often clashed\n\nHoratio Gates rose through the military ranks and while he won several important battles, he butted heads with Washington as he tried to blacken his name and remove him from his position as general\n\nMarquis de Lafayette became Washington's protege and one of the key commanders of the American Revolution. Baron Von Steuben introduced order and uniformity across the army\n\nIt is to Washington's credit that he studied England's weaknesses but also her strengths in order to determine what practices to exploit and which to emulate. With Hamilton's influence, Washington established the national debt and national bank\n\nWashington had full faith in Benedict Arnold and was shaken and distraught when he found out he had a betrayed his country\n\nWashington greatest achievement laid in cobbling together unifying and motivating a dove verse group of people who had to come over substantial odds to be the British army\n\nWashington's view on abolition softened over his tenure and throughout the war\n\nAfter the United States Britain the prospect of keys was difficult for Washington too. He was worried about exerting his own influence and speaking his mind on what he used to be the correct course of action for the United States after gaining independence. Washington ceding his power after the war was one of his most important and meaningful acts. He understood his power to be \"on rent\" and returned it as soon as it was appropriate to do so. Washington had a very busy public life, entertaining thousands of people who wanted to see and meet this great hero. Washington was nominated to be president a couple years later which again but him in a non partisan role\n\nWashington left Martha and Mt. Vernon for over 4 months to join the Constitutional Convention which drew up the Constitution. As the Constitution was ratified, Washington was expected to put it into action as the first President. This expectation was likely a major cause for the great support the Constitution received. That Washington willingly gave up his military power after the war, was seen as reluctantly accepting the presidential nomination and the fact he had no children added to people's desire for him to lead. His no children made it less likely that power would simply be handed down\n\nWashington never lost his stylish desire and lived quite lavishly although he faced significant financial worries\n\nWashington saw the VP as the head of the legislature which diminished Adam's role and influence\n\nAfter having the capital in Philadelphia for a temporary 10 year stint, Washington, Jefferson and L'enfant chose the site and designed America's new capital in Washington DC\n\nIt was vital that Washington serve as president although he was reluctant to step back into the public light. He was sure he'd retire after his first term but there was much fraction and his continued tenure was necessary for the success of the new nation\n\nWashington rose even higher in people's minds when he willingly gave up political power after his second term. Washington's farewell address touched on many important political points and took a clear Federalist stance. He thought there should be commercial over political ties and that a strong central government was important for the future success of the country. His just actions and influential decisions forever shaped the presidential role and proved that a republic could be run without absolute authority and that the leader is an extension of the people. His biggest failings lay in not abolishing slavery and the poor dealings with Native American uprisings\n\nAdams became the second president and Jefferson the VP\n\nWashington was able to put his conscience at ease once he revised his will and freed all the slaves he owned once he passed away\n\nWhat I got out of it\n\nLearning about Washington the man was really interesting to me. His desire to keep learning, his like of English fashion and at times extravagant spending, how indebted he became during the war, his relationship with Martha which was more friendly than loving and the raging temper which was buried beneath his icy interior\n\nIn the Latticework, we've distilled, curated, and interconnected the 750+book summaries from The Rabbit Hole.
