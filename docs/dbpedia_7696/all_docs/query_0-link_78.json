        "text": "After securing America’s independence from Britain, George Washington planned to retire to his Virginia home, Mount Vernon. Instead, he was called back into public service for an additional eight years as the first president of the United States.\n\nMount Vernon was of great personal importance to Washington, but he also had a profound impact on the neighboring community of Alexandria, completing the first survey and plan for the town. The federal city itself remains one of his greatest legacies. In 1790, Congress selected this area north of Mount Vernon as the permanent seat of government for the United States.\n\nGeorge Washington and His World explored the role of each of these three places in President Washington’s life and legacy, through portraits, letters and other artifacts in the museum's Albert H. Small Washingtoniana Collection. The exhibition also marked the curatorial debut of 17 GW students who studied history with Professor Denver Brunsman. The class contributed to exhibition development, research and label writing.\n\nOrganized in cooperation with the Albert H. Small Center for National Capital Area Studies"
