        "text": "There is a lot going on in the Mamakating, New York. Located in Sullivan County in the Catskills, it is the oldest town in the county and one whose history is in lead mining and tanneries. Leather produced in Mamakating was well-known and sought after by the Union Army for boots, saddles, and other goods. The old school building in Summitville has been renovated into an archive room with pictures and artifacts of the history of the area.\n\nLocated in the middle of the township of Mamakating is Wurtsboro. It consists mostly of neighborhoods, giving the area a community feel. It also has a fire station and a post office. In the town center are many restaurants, the township’s library, banks, and elementary school. There is also the town pool, which is open daily in the summer. Spring Glen also has a grocery store and a general store, and Summitville has a fire station.\n\nA bit further south east is the township of Bloomingburg, which is the largest one in Mamakating. There aren’t many neighborhoods, but businesses fill the streets, including restaurants that offer Chinese food and pizza, plus a diner. For shopping, there is Bloomingburg Grocery and a Dollar General store. Bloomingburg has a gas station, post office, and several churches of varying denominations.\n\nPhilipsport Community Center, located in the township of Phillipsport, hosts many community events, including an annual summertime farmers’ market. The center also offers family-friendly events, such as breakfast with Santa, a community yard sale, and programs that benefit causes and projects in the area. Elementary-aged children can enjoy the Mamakating Summer Camp that runs from July to August at the Mamakating Town Park in Bloomington.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to explore the outdoors in Mamakating, including three state forests: Shawangunk Ridge, Roosa Gap, and Wurtsboro Ridge. They offer unbelievable views and adventures. Each location has hiking trails that can also be used for skiing and snow shoeing in the winter. Hunting, trapping, and camping are also open in these forests with applicable licensing. There is also the Basha Kill Marsh and Basha Kill Wildlife Refuge. This area is a good place for fishing, although special fishing regulations do apply, so double-check requirements for the area.\n\nWhether you choose to live in the town areas of Bloomingburg or Wurtsboro, or you prefer the country life, Mamakating has everything you need: shopping, dining, sports, and recreation."
