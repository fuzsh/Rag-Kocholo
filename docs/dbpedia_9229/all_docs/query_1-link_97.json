        "text": "The Treasure hunt continues….\n\nI had not found the treasure in New Mexico and studied the information at my hotel room in Colorado. The brochures on Wyoming, Yellowstone and Cody Wyoming had convinced me that the treasure must be in the West Yellowstone or one of the other places that Forrest had written about in his books.\n\nWyoming has always interested me and I thought that it would be exciting and challenging to look for the Forrest Fenn treasure while I was on vacation in the state. For the sake of not being complacent and lacking imagination, I accepted the challenge to find the Forrest Fenn Treasure in Wyoming. In the winter months, nonetheless.\n\nMany of the clues in the poem point to Wyoming as the destination for the Fenn Fortune. In fact, it all starts with WWWH. Where warm waters halt, or for purposes of this treasure search: WWWH= WAS WYOMING WHERE HIDDEN?\n\nAfter all, Wyoming starts with a big W. We all know the most modern day treasures are found under Big W’s like the one in It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, World. A movie, if watched closely, may reveal many of the clues to finding the treasure.\n\nMoreover, Wyoming contains part of the Yellowstone National Park System. And we all know FF’s affinity for that place. From spending time with his family and close friends to providing guide services to earn extra money during the summer, Forrest has plenty of stories about that place. But I feel that there are other potential locations for the Treasure in Wyoming. Well, enough with the horsing around, let’s get to my story of the Wyoming Treasure Hunt.\n\nIt was nearly 9 am when I began my search for the Forrest Fenn Treasure in WY. I pulled the old Winebago off of Interstate 80 (a place an 80 year old might go) and headed down monument road. This road transverssed a plateau that rose to nearly 8800 feet. It led me to the Ames Brothers Monument. You can read more about it here: http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2259\n\nThis monument was erected in honor of Oliver and Oakes(tree name, double omegas)Ames, who in some opinion were the first insider traders to bilk our country out of millions of dollars. Ironically, they made their first fortune selling shovels to miners looking for gold. Posthumous immortality, however, eluded the Ames Brothers. The Union Pacific went bankrupt in the 1890s, and its tracks were moved south to a less expensive route. The pyramid no longer had a captive audience — or any audience. The Lincoln Highway was later built along the old rail bed, but it was rerouted in 1920, leaving the pyramid abandoned for good. Now bird poop stains the faces of Oliver and Oakes, and in recent years both of their noses have partly fallen (or been shot) off.\n\nBeing on monument road and close to where three creeks converge, I thought this was as good of a blaze as any. The town of Sherman is also near. Here you will find that Sherman had, as a part of the railroad yards, a windmill the vanes of which had a diameter of 20 feet. It was used to pump water into a tank holding 50,000 gallons. Additionally, the yard had a roundhouse with five stalls and a turntable. The railroad shops were required, in great part, by the necessity of double-heading the locomotives up the steep grade from Laramie. Even today in wintertime the grade on the Interstate out of Laramie can be an adventure. In 1901, with the construction of the Dale Creek embankment, the railroad tracks were moved several miles away. Today, little remains except pottery shards and rusted tin cans. Some artifacts, however, are newer. On the day that I was there, a faded Pepsi can bearing the 1984 football schedule for the Wyoming team was found. As with all historical artifacts should be, it was left in place.\n\nI must have spent all of an hour and a half looking for the treasure at the Ames Monument. Relating it to clues, did not lead me to the treasure chest. The fact that the Ames Brothers have lost their noses, keeps reminding me of Pinocchio.\n\nBy noon, I had become bored with this place and decided to move on further west on Interstate 80 also knows as the Lincoln Highway. At this point, I came across the settlement of Point of Rocks.\n\nPoint of Rocks Station, 22 miles northeast of Rock Springs and one-half mile south of I-80, was built in 1861 or 1862 by Ben Holladay when Indian depredations completed interdicted stage traffic on the Oregon Trail and forced traffic further south. The move did not completely stop the problem and the station was burned by the Indians at least once. In 1863, Overland ex-superintendent Joseph Slade held up the stage near here, killing 7 passengers, resulting in the start of the cemetary. The Railroad reached Point of Rocks in 1868, but for many years the town remained an important junction point for stages and freighters going to South Pass. In 1870, a stage left twice daily for South Pass City, a jolting 15 hour ride. With the decline of South Pass City and the mines, stage service was discontinued in 1877, and the station became a private residence and a school.\n\nThe last resident of the station was Jim McKee who reputedly was a member of the hole-in-the-Wall Gang. The Union Pacific, who by then had acquired title to the building, attempted evict him, but was thwarted by McKee’s threats of bodily harm to the railroad representative. To deter other visitors McKee posted a smallpox warning on the door. Today, the town is little more than an interchange on I-80 with several trailer homes, a gas station and fireworks store. Fireworks! Alas, I had found the blaze.\n\nOkay, so I admit, I was on vacation and I was really interested in tracing some of the old Indian trading routes, like the one from South Pass to Point of Rocks. Just imagine how brave each of the Indian tribes must have been to trade with each other. The thought that an Indian tribe might bring medicine bows and trade them for Gold was one that I just could not get out of my mind. I spent a few minutes relating the Indian Stories to the Point of rocks station and then continue to head on the greener pastures. Purple Sage and Green River were just down the road and must be clues to the location of the gold. Moreover, Pilot Butte was just north of both Purple Sage and Green River. Unfortunately, I turned too soon and ended up on highway 191 heading north through Reliance and Eden and ended up in Farson.\n\nIt was getting late and I needed a place to park the Winabego. The park director provided me an overview of the area.\n\n“From the very beginning, Farson has been a place for travellers to stop and rest. The Big Sandy Pony Express Station was located in the area. Now, the Farson Mercantile is an oasis for those who love ice cream. It has been renowned as the “home of the big cone” state wide. The town of Farson was named for John Farson, who funded an irrigation project for Eden and Farson which allowed the area to thrive. Farson sits in high desert country, which provides several opportunities for recreation. In just a short drive you can see wild horses, the Killpecker Sand Dunes, historic markers from the Pony Express, Oregon Trail, Mormon Trail and petroglyphs.”\n\nI had not found the Home of Brown, but I enjoyed an Ice Cream cone. With this new found information, I must be on the right track. And perhaps it is time for a Lesson in Geology and History because you must be wondering why I am looking for the Forrest Fenn Treasure here.\n\nIn a land known for its scarcity of precipitation, water has been a powerful force in shaping the Red Desert. Former rivers from the Paleocene and later epochs and the ancient Lake Gosiute deposited between 10,000 feet (3,000 m) and 20,000 feet (6,100 m) of sediment in the Red Desert’s geographic basin.[2]\n\nLake Gosiute began to fill the Red Desert for the first time in the early Eocene epoch. Subsequent climate and tectonic activities during the lake’s lifespan of 4 million years saw repeated patterns of rising and falling water levels. Gosiute reached its maximum surface area of 15,000 square miles with its shoreline stretching into Utah and Colorado.[2] Other times the lake evaporated completely.\n\nLake Gosiute left behind a high concentration of saline materials and a deep primal ooze of organic matter. The former produced today’s highly-valued mineral trona, while the latter created coal-bed methane gas, coal, and the world’s largest known oil-shale deposit.[2] Energy sources have made the region the epicenter of today’s natural gas boom in Wyoming.\n\nThe Continental Divide branches to the desert’s northwest and rejoins in the southeast, creating the Great Divide Basin from which no surface water drains. Steamboat Mountain and other desert mesas or buttes provide seeps and springs that serve as a water source for small streams such as Morrow Creek. While the basin’s interior waters are intermittent, the desert is bounded to the west by the Green River and to the east by the North Platte River.Scientists trace the story of human presence in the Red Desert back 12,000 years.[2] Striking evidence of early human inhabitants is seen in rock art found at the Boar’s Tusk, Seedskadee, and East Flaming Gorge areas. Researchers interpret the petroglyphs carved into rock at these sites as biographical, ceremonial, or spiritual expressions.[2] The Red Desert’s Black Art petrogylph is thought to date back 11,500 years, according to anthropologist and cultural historian Russell L. Tanner who says the rock art may be the continent’s oldest\n\nI slept well that night with not a single dream or nightmare. I had an earlier nightmare where wood peckers were dispatched to remove my nose for telling lies and writing stories. It must have had something to do with the Ames brothers and the bird poop. Nonetheless, I quickly packed my awning back into the trailer and was ready to hit the road on up to Lander. It was just a few miles on up Highway 28. Unfortunately, there was not much to see along the road but sage brush and the occassional pinion tree.\n\nLander was known as Pushroot, Fort Brown, and Fort Auger prior to its current name. The town was named Lander in honor of General Frederick W. Lander, a famous transcontinental explorer who surveyed the Oregon Trail’s Lander Cutoff.[8] Several miles southeast of town near present-day U.S. Route 287 is the site of Wyoming’s first oil well, circa 1884.[9] The town was incorporated in 1890.[10]\n\nOn October 1, 1906, Lander became the westward terminus of the “Cowboy Line” of the Chicago and North Western Railway, thus originating the slogan “where rails end and trails begin.” Originally intended to be a transcontinental mainline to Coos Bay, Oregon, or Eureka, California, the line never went further west, and service to Lander was abandoned in 1972.\n\nAll of the clues from the scrapbooks, the poem, and other social media sites. Is the home of BROWN Lander Wyoming? Pushroot-found among the roots. Push in the right direction. How obvious did it need to be? All the other Wyoming clues. Where rails end and trails begin. AND OMG EUREKA.\n\nOne of the country’s major bronze foundries, Eagle Bronze, is located in Lander, as is the International Headquarters of the National Outdoor Leadership School and other environment and land-related non profit organizations including offices of the Wyoming Outdoor Council, the Wyoming office of The Nature Conservancy, the Wyoming Wildlife Federation, and Wyoming Catholic College.\n\nIn addition to the public sector and a traditional agriculture and grazing economy, the economy of Lander and the region are supported by substantial tourism. Located at the foot of the Wind River Mountains, Lander serves as a point of departure for camping, hunting, fishing, wilderness travel, climbing, and mountaineering. .\n\nSO, where have we seen this before. ER UH Wally Eagle (Eagle Bronze) Wind River Mountains too many citations to count in scrapbooks and stories. National Outdoor Leadership School and the Former Girl Scout Preserve hit home with the ranch school themes. Not to mention the numerous outfitters that provide horse back riding and dude ranching opportunities.\n\nOf course, we must remember that we cannot ignore the poem. To do so would be a grave mistake. All of this information about Lander WAS too good to be true. While Fort Brown may have been a name for the now City of Lander, that would be too easy in terms of FennSpeak. But perhaps I was in the right area and was willing to entertain the thought that Lander could be the home of perhaps another BROWN. I unfolded my RV awning, opened a couple of beers and enjoyed the marvel gaze from the Shoshone National Forest.\n\nIn 1957, Mummy Cave was rediscovered by a local resident on the north side of the North Fork Shoshone River, adjacent to U.S. Routes 14/16/20, 15 mi (24 km) east of Yellowstone National Park.[10] Subsequent archeological excavations in the 1960s produced evidence that the cave had been occupied for over 9,000 years.[11] The oldest deposits in the cave yielded prismatic stone blades.\n\nColter explored the Absaroka Mountains, crossing over Togwotee Pass and entering the valley known today as Jackson Hole.[14] Colter survived a grizzly bear attack and a pursuit by a band of Blackfeet Indians who had taken his horse.[13] The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814.[15]\n\nI am not even going to try to explain all of the clues mentioned in the above diatribe about the Shoshone Forest Preserve connections to the FF poem, scrapbooks, and hints and books. If you do not believe the treasure is in Wyoming, you need to fold up your tent and go back to looking in New Mexico.\n\nSpeaking of diatribes, here is another:\n\nYou should know that I often tell stories, some of which are partially true, but others that are as big as Pinocchio’s nose. It is a bad habit and probably one that I learned from being in a sales job for over 9 years. I always try to do more than is required but for some reason, my extra efforts are under appreciated. Sometimes, I feel like a piece of wood being maniputalated by a marionette, just waiting for a Fox and a Cat to have its way with me.\n\nBack to the story.\n\nI did not sleep very well in my camper at the Shoshone Park. I kept having a nightmare that included horses, Indian Spirits and archeologists. I truly believe that the lands that were inhabited by Indians and Travellers of the past do have the ability to enter our subconscious and influence our thoughts. I have felt this way in both the Rio Grande River area in New Mexico and now in the Wind River area. It must be upon the wind that these spirits travel for I do not see them but I can feel their touch.\n\nI screamed as I woke up as if someone was excavating my bones from a sepulture. The man was dressed in a long fur coat from the Victorian area and was sporting a mustache. For some odd reason, his axe was picking at my nose. His assistant exclaimed to the man, “Mr. Bones, what have you discovered now?”\n\nI scrambled out of bed to find my smartphone. I had to find out who was picking at my nose in my sleep. It was at the point when I Googled “Mr. Bones Paleanotologist.” I came up with the following entry:\n\nBarnum Brown (February 12, 1873 – February 5, 1963),[1] commonly referred to as Mr. Bones, was an American paleontologist. Named after the circus showman P.T. Barnum, he discovered the first documented remains of Tyrannosaurus rex during a career that made him one of the most famous fossil hunters working from the late Victorian era into the early 20th century.\n\nAfter working a handful of years in Wyoming for AMNH in the late 1890s, Brown led an expedition to the Hell Creek Formation of Southeastern Montana. There, in 1902, he discovered and excavated the first documented remains of Tyrannosaurus rex.[2]\n\nSo why is it that I would awaken in Wyoming to the thought of my bones being picked at by a Victorian era paleantologist? Could the answer not be more obvious? One of BARNUM BROWN’s archeological dig sites is the HOME OF BROWN.\n\nSo where is that site? And who would know where to find fossils, rare books and treasures?\n\nSome of you may now think that I am heading to Crook County Wyoming or perhaps Hell Creek, Montana. But that would be too easy. It is the obscure facts that you must uncover to find the Fenn Treasure. And here is one of the most obscure of all. Tying together Forrests fondness for books with his experience in archeology, the two interesect at the following obscure publication. A Triceratops Hunt In Pioneer Wyoming: The Journals Of Barnum Brown & J.p. Sams: The University Expedition Of 1895″ (2004) ISBN 0-931271-77-0\n\nOkay so now I just sold a thousand copies of a rare book that does not even exist in its original form. Luckily it has been republished. So it was back to google to find out where in the Hell’s Creek is Pioneer Wyoming? Easy right? Go ahead try to find the book on line or a citation for a town named Pioneer, Wyoming. Go look at maps from 1890 and try to find it. Here is one!\n\nhttp://www.historicmapworks.com/Atlas/US/33851/Wyoming+1895+State+Map/\n\nI could not find the town of Pioneer.\n\nI was stumped and felt like a one legged fighter at an ASS kicking contest. Yeah,I almost lost my leg because someone put me to close to a termite mound. I had a close call one other time near a blaze but luckily I was able to go in the right direction and not fall into the firehole.\n\nHow Dumb could I be? Surely there is a town called Pioneer and a treasure to be found. After all, the author mentioned it in the title. And this might not even be the correct book. Barnum had spent time in both Wyoming and Montana and Canada. Over a half century of fossil hunting in all. It was going to be nearly impossible to figure out which site was the home of Brown.\n\nI had now reached a fork in the road. You could search nearly all of the sites and never come up with the correct one. It was back to the poem for study and reflection. Over the past year I had collected the following information about Wyoming and its history of Indians, Mining and Archeology. Where in Hell Creek was the treasure?\n\nHowe Dinosaur Quarry\n\nOne of the best known fossil sites in the basin is the Howe Dinosaur Quarry near Shell, Wyoming. First excavated in 1934 by the famous paleontologist, Barnum Brown, of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, this became a world renowned site for its large assemblage of dinosaur bones (over 4,000 fossilized bones), mostly sauropods, in a single area. Sinclair Oil Company financed this expedition and it was documented in major news outlets and scientific publications.\n\nDana Dinosaur Quarry\n\nAnother private site, the Dana Dinosaur Quarry near Ten Sleep, Wyoming has rapidly become a major dinosaur quarry. Over a dozen individual skeletons have so far been discovered, representing a variety of species, including predator and prey, both large and small, including “Einstein”, a huge Apatosaurus which was recently displayed in the Abu Dhabi airport.\n\nBone Cabin Quarry\n\nBone Cabin Quarry was a dinosaur quarry that laid approximately fifty-five miles northwest of Laramie, Wyoming near historic Como Bluff. During the summer of 1897 Walter W. Granger, a paleontologist from the American Museum of Natural History, came upon a hillside littered with Jurassic period dinosaur bone fragments. Nearby was a sheepherder’s cabin built entirely out of fossil bones, hence the name “Bone Cabin Quarry.” After Granger’s discovery in late August 1897, the quarry was kept secret until the summer of 1898, when the manpower could be amassed to undertake a full-scale excavation. Bone Cabin Quarry was excavated from 1898 until 1905, when the productivity of specimens thinned. Some of the dinosaurs found at the Bone Cabin Quarry include Stegosaurus, Allosaurus and Apatosaurus.\n\nAbout five miles southwest of Bone Cabin Quarry, a further quarry, called Nine Mile Quarry, was opened up in June 1899, near Nine Mile Crossing of Little Medicine Bow River. An incomplete Brontosaurus skeleton was recovered.\n\nTRICERATOPS\n\nThe story A Triceratops Hunt in Pioneer Wyoming. In the summer of 1895, a team from the University ventured into the frontier lands of of eastern Wyoming with the explicit goal of finding a Triceratops for display at the young Natural History Museum. The team was led by Samuel Wendell Williston, founder of the University’s geology department. Although Williston’s specialty was entomology, he had previously worked under Marsh at Yale and was well-acquainted with the plethora of dinosaurs on which his mentor had published. Also on the expedition were Regent James Polk Sams, and two individuals whose names are quite familiar to anyone with an interest in the history of paleontology, Barnum Brown and Elmer Riggs.\n\nThe team found the Triceratops they were looking for on July 9, near the confluence of Lightning and Lance Creeks. By July 22, the skull was fully excavated and crated for a journey by train. The fossil apparently garnered a fair amount of attention on the journey; while Triceratops is well known today, in 1895 few had any idea that animals such as this had ever walked the Earth. And yet, here was clear, physical evidence of an extinct animal like nothing alive in the modern world, and it would soon be displayed for all to see in the University Museum.\n\nIMPORTANT SITES IN WYOMING\n\nCopper Mountain\n\nCopper Mountain is the name locally applied to that portion of the Owl Creek Range of the Wind River Mountains which lies east of the Big Horn River, and has been the scene of active prospecting for both gold and copper for the past year or two. The territory embraced is about twenty miles long by about six or eight wide, and the formations shown are schist, diorite, two distinct granite flows, and the whole skirted by the sedimentaries which overlie the uplift on the north and east sides of the mountain.\n\nOn the west end the canon of the Big Horn River cuts through the range, and the properties of the Boysen Company are situated here. A power plant is being built to furnish power for the mines of this locality, light the Central Wyoming towns, and supply power for the other enterprises of this section. A dam is being constructed, and the plant is being installed as rapidly as possible.\n\nMuch prospecting has been done here, and some deep tunneling done from the canon side, but so far no results have been given to the public. Near by are several promising properties, and considerable gold ore has been reported from this end of the mountain.\n\nOn the east end of the mountain the Williams-Luman mine bids fair to make Central Wyoming famous for both gold and copper, and in point of production and occurrence of the ores.\n\nCASPER\n\nWith the arrival of the railroad in 1888, Casper became a prime shipping point for wool rapidly replacing Rawlins as the center of wool production in the state. In the same year George Weber formed the Bank of Casper. In 1891 he sold the bank to lawyer and ranchman William Ascan Denecke (1861-1947) who continued operation of the bank as W. A. Deneck & Co.. Denecke was a partner with Nathan S. Bristol in an adjacent ranch supply house known as N. S. Bristol & Co. Bristol was a well respected businessman of Casper, a 32nd Degree Scottish Rite, a Trustee of the University of Wyoming.\n\nThe year following the arrival of the railroad, Natrona County was formed with Casper competing with Bessimer Bend to be the seat. Bessimer Bend is now a ghost town. But like a number of other end-of-the-track towns, Casper tended to be a bit “wild and woolly.” Hence, newly elected sheriff, William W. Jaycox, had his hands full.\n\nMEDICINE BOW\n\nOn November 25, 1913, a small item appeared in the Tribune. The highway was to go through Medicine Bow. Elk Mountain continued the fight. In the July 21, 1914, Tribune a dispatch from Elk Mountain reported:\n\nLet no one persuade you to deviate from this section of the Lincoln Highway selected by the highway officials by reason of its scenic conditions, outing facilities and reduced mileage. You may be informed that the road is impassable, the bridges out, gates locked and you will be fined for trespassing, all of which is false. The road is in good condition with one or two minor exceptions. Stones large and small have been removed from the larger per cent of the road and work is being done continually to add to the comfort of the traveler\n\nTHE TOWN OF LUSK\n\nAs will be observed, during a spring thaw, the streets turn to mud, a sticky, gunky partially clay mud, referred to as gumbo. The 19th Century artist Thomas Moran wrote of gumbo:\n\nWhen wet it is the blackest, stickiest, most India-rubber-like mud that extists on earth. Like the gathering snowball, it accumulates on whatever comes in contact with it, and is so adhesive that it never falls away of its own weight, as any well regulated mud will do, but must be laboriously removed when you or your wagon-wheels become clogged with it. * * * * The horses * * * started off cheerfully; but the terrible gumbo soon began to discourage them. We tried walking to relieve them of our weight, but soon found that the friendly gumbo had us in its embrace, making our feet like lead.”Century Magazine, “Artists’ Adventures,” 1893.\n\nCompared to gumbo, Georgia clay in its wimpiness turns red with embarassment. Walking across a corral in the gumbo is an adventure. One’s boots sink into the mire. A vacuum formed with the clay threatens to suck the boots completely off. If one reaches down to grab the tops of the boots to lift one’s feet out of the gumbo, one may very well take a tumble into the gunk.\n\nLANCE CREEK\n\nAt one time, Lance Creek had some 2,000 residents, but by 1985, the population had declined to about 50. Lance Creek is now most noted for upper Crataceous dinosaurs discoveries at several sites between Lance Creek and Crazy Woman Creek, including the discovery in 1908 of the Edmontosaurus “Mummy” by Charles Sternberg and his sons. Allegedly, the Sternberg were working on behalf of the British Museum, but in a scene remininscent of the Bone Wars, the mummy was sold by Sternberg to the American Museum of Naural History for $2,000.00. The mummy is significant in that the specimen preserves an impression of almost an entire dinosaur hide.\n\nLOST SPRINGS\n\nTo the west of Keeline in Converse County, lies the smallest incorporated municipality in the United States, Lost Springs, population 1, 4, or 5, depending on who is doing the counting. The 2000 census only reflected 1. It has been contended that that the census taker only counted the mayor and missed the three councilmen.\n\nSPANISH DIGGINGS\n\nSouth of Manville, Jireh, Lost Springs, Keeline is am area extending into Platte County and Goshen County north pf Hartville. The area is bounded on the east by the Rawhide Buttes, the Haystack Range and on the west by an area known as the ” Spanish Diggings.” The Spanish Diggings themselves are an area in the Southwest corner of Niobrara County extending across the south county line into northeastern Platte County. It is an area of canyons such as Muskrat Canyon, Dead Horse Canyon and Whalen Canyon. In Whalen Canyon there are a number of caves showing signs of previous human habitation. Thus rumors arose that Whalen Canyon had been used as a hideout for the infamous Jack Slade and his gang. Muskrat Canyon is an area of abandoned mines. Access from the horth even today is difficult. In the summer, streams such a Muddy Creek and Spanish Creek are subject to unexpected flash floods.\n\nWhalen Canyon was rumored to be the an area in which the infamous Jack Slade had hidden his loot. William Lauk and Joseph Stein had come to the area about 1881 and allegedly became a partner of an individual who claimed to have been a member of the Slade gang. The two searched for the cache. One day, so the story goes, the partner went out on a burro but never returned. It was said that the partner was later seen at Ft. Laramie spending money as if it was going out of style and then disappeared. Did the partner find Slade’s gold and cut Stein out of his share? Is the story true? We will never know.\n\nImportant Indian History\n\nChief Washakie (c.1798[1]/1810 – February 20, 1900) was a renowned warrior first mentioned in 1840 in the written record of the American fur trapper, Osborne Russell. In 1851, at the urging of trapper Jim Bridger, Washakie led a band of Shoshones to the council meetings of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851). Essentially from that time until his death, he was considered the head of the Eastern Shoshones by the representatives of the United States government.[1]\n\nSage Creek Station\n\nSage Creek Station (June 8, 1865) – Just a few days after Lieutenant James A. Brown detached five men of the Ohio Cavalry to guard the Sage Creek Station on the Overland Road west of Fort Halleck, Wyoming, they were attacked by about 100 Lakota Siouxand Cheyenne warriors. After just about one hour of fighting, the troops found their ammunition low and were forced to evacuate with two civilians. Desperately outnumbered, the men faced an eight-mile run west to reach Pine Grove Station, with the Indians in pursuit. During the running battle, two soldiers and one of the civilians were killed, two soldiers were wounded, and another, who was wounded was captured. Only two of the soldiers made it to Pine Grove Station. The wounded and captured soldier and the second civilian were never found. The battle took place near Saratoga, Wyoming\n\nBone Pile Creek\n\nBattle of Bone Pile Creek (August 13-15, 1865) – Hoping to pioneer and publicize a shorter route to Montana during its gold filled heydays, a prominent Iowa merchant James Sawyers organized an expedition. The expedition team was comprised of 53 men, 15 wagons, and 90 oxen. Joining them was an emigrant train of five wagons and 36 freight wagons owned by C.E. Hedges & Company of Sioux City, Iowa. This large group was escorted by Captain George Williford leading 143 men of the Volunteer Dakota Cavalry. The party traveled slowly up the Niobrara River, at times struggling through sand hills with temperatures climbing over 100 degrees. By the time they reached the badlands of the upper White River, Captain Williford was running out of provisions and sent sent 15 men to Fort Laramie, about 75 miles southwest, for needed supplies on July 21, 1865.\n\nBy August 9th, the expedition had reached the Belle Fourche River and decided to strike northwest to the Powder River. However, they found the next 30 miles very rough with little water, which convinced Sawyers that it was not the place for a wagon road. He turned the wagon train around. Along the way, they were harassed by Sioux and Cheyenne warriors. On August 13th, the expedition planned to camp on Bone Pile Creek, about ten miles southwest of present-day Gillette, Wyoming. However, before they arrived a band of Cheyenne killed Nathaniel D. Hedges, a 19-year-old partner in the freighting firm, and ran off eight horses about 1.5 miles from the intended campsite. When they reached the campsite, the group corralled their wagons, dug in to protect themselves from further attacks. They buried Hedges in the center of the corral and concealed the grave. The next day the Indians reappeared and made a dash for the horses but were driven off. On the 15th, about 500 Sioux and Cheyenne warriors circled the camp and began shooting. The expedition men wanted to negotiate with the Indians and give them supplies. Captain George Williford objected to this idea, doubting that it would work; however a wagon load of supplies, which included sugar, bacon, coffee, flour, and tobacco were given to the warriors. When the wagons then began to move again, Williford proved to be correct. Just as they were getting underway, a large group attacked the train killing two soldiers – John Rawze and Anthony Nelson. Fighting back, two of the warriors were also killed. Nelson’s body was the only recovered and he was buried alongside Hedges. Rawze’s body could not be found. The Indians backed off and the expedition continued on.\n\nSweetwater\n\nSweetwater Mining District (1868-70) – Though digging for gold in the South Pass area began as early as 1842, mining activity was very sporadic until after the Civil War. The rich Carissa Mine was discovered in June, 1867 and shortly afterwards, was attacked by Sioux Indians killed three miners and drove the rest away. However, the trespassers would soon return along with hundreds of others, as word of the gold find spread. In violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, the miners continued to flock to the area as more gold veins were discovered and the towns of Atlantic City and Miners Delight were organized.\n\nIn May, 1868, angry Indians raided the area and stole an estimated 100 horses and mules. But, this did not scare the miners away. Before long, they had replenished their animals. The following month, the warriors returned, once again stealing the stock as well as general merchandise, and killed four men. Still the fortune-hungry prospectors stayed.\n\nThree Crossings\n\nThree Crossings (August 9, 1868) – On August 9, 1868, Indians attacked an ox train bringing in supplies for one of the new mercantile establishments. At what was called Three Crossings on the Sweetwater River, the two freighters, were attacked by Indians. The wagon driver, named Dave Hayes, was seriously wounded and the other man, known as “Uncle Hirst,” was hit in the heel. Though they were both injured, they succeeded in driving off the Indians. Hayes was so seriously wounded he could not continue to travel, so, Hirst made him comfortable by wrapping him in blankets under the protection of the wagon and went for help. Hirst returned with two men to rescue the wounded Dave Hayes and rescue the supplies — William Rose and William Tweed. Also, going in the direction was Major Baldwin, who was going after supplies with a train of wagons.\n\nUpon his return with William Rose, William Tweed, a Major Baldwin, and a man named Leach. When they arrived at Three Crossings, they found the driver dead and the merchandise gone. Retracing their steps, they were attacked by Indians near a place called the Ice Slough. After a spirited engagement, Major Baldwin was driven back, and William Tweed and the man named Leach were wounded. William Rose, who was riding a fast horse was determined to ride for help. But, he wouldn’t make it. With the Indians in full pursuit, he was shot in the back of the head and he fell from his saddle. However, the diversion was enough to allow the others to escape.\n\nThis attack so aroused the people in the mining district that 27 men, well mounted and armed, went in pursuit of the Indians but, were unable to find them. They buried the bodies of William Rose and David Hayes and returned to the camps. Before long, they were back to looking for gold; though now, they were much better armed.\n\nMedicine Bow:\n\nNamed after the Native American powwows in which numerous tribes would congregate here in search of mountain mahogany, which was an excellent wood for the manufacturing of bows, and to perform rituals hoped to cure diseases and thus make “good medicine”. Areas of interest include the Snowy Range where the highest peak is Medicine Bow Peak at 12,013 feet (3,662 m) and is visible from Snowy Range Pass, 10,847 ft (3,306 m), on Wyoming highway 130. The Encampment River, Huston Park, Savage Run and Platte River Wildernesses are all located within the Medicine Bow portion of the National Forest\n\nThe town of Medicine Bow got its name from the nearby river, where plains Indians made their bows from elements found near its banks. Cattlemen and sheepherders found the plains ideal and soon a town developed and was named Medicine Bow after the nearby river of the same name. Indians were a constant threat to the new town. Attacks were frequent and one lasted long enough that the Cavalry from Fort Steele had to save the town\n\nBattle of Lightening Creek\n\nThe Last Indian Battle (October 24, 1903) – By the time this skirmish occurred, Indian battles had become a thing of the past and “civilization” had taken over Wyoming. However, on October 24, 1903, one more skirmish would occur. Also called Battle of Lightening Creek, the conflict occurred after Weston County Sheriff William Miller received word of that several bands of Indians were roaming about the southern part of the county. The Indians, led by Chief Charley Smith had left the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota to go hunting near Thunder Creek. Allegedly hunting illegally, the Indians had not only violated game laws, but, were also said to have killed some stock on the range. Sheriff Miller and a posse caught up with a portion of the band on October 23rd and arrested 12 of them at the mouth of Lance Creek. The Indians were then disarmed and escorted back to Newcastle, Wyoming by Deputy Hilton, Ed Buchanan and Arthur Edlund.\n\nThe remaining posse members, including Sheriff Miller, then went after the rest of the band, catching up with them on the Dry Fork of the Cheyenne River. Finding a group of about 20 warriors and 30 women, he demanded that they surrender; however Chief Charley Smith refused. Miller, in the meantime, realized he did not have enough men to to make an arrest and withdrew. The next day after obtaining reinforcements, the posse caught up with the band near the confluence of Lightning Creek and Thunder Creek. Once again, Miller demanded that they surrender but they refused and one Indian opened fire on the posse. In the ensuing skirmish, Sheriff Miller suffered a fatal wound and bled to death, Deputy Louis Falkenberg was shot in the neck, five Indians were killed, and Chief Charley Smith was severely wounded. He died the next day.\n\nWHERE IN ALL OF THIS MESS ARE THE CLUES?\n\nI had found the Home of Brown, but which town was it? I started to hum the Johnny Cash Song “I’ve Been Everywhere” to myself\n\nAfton Airport Road Albany Albin Alcova Alpine Alpine Northeast Alpine NorthwestAlta Antelope Hills Antelope Valley-Crestview Arapahoe Arrowhead Springs Arvada Atlantic City Auburn Baggs Bairoil Bar Nunn Basin Bedford Bessemer BendBig HornBig PineyBondurant Boulde rBoulder Flats Brookhurst Buffalo Burlington Burns Byron Calpe Carter Casper Casper Mountain Centennial Cheyenne Chugcreek Chugwater Clearmont ClearviewAcre Cody Cokeville Cora Cowley Crowheart Danie Dayton Deaver Diamondville Dixon Douglas Dubois East Thermopolis Eden Edgerton Elk Mountain Esterbrook Ethete Etna Evanston Evansville Fairview Farson Fontenelle Fort Bridger Fort Laramie Fort Washakie Fox Farm-College Frannie Garland Gillette Glendo Glenrock Grand Encampment Granger Green River Greybull Grover Guernsey Hanna Hartrandt Hartville Hawk Springs Hill View Heights Hoback Homa Hills Hudson Hulett Huntley Hyattville Jackson James Town Jeffrey City Johnstown Kaycee Kemmerer Kirby La Barge La Grange Lakeview North Lance Creek Lander Laramie Lingle Little America Lonetree Lost Springs Lovell Lucerne Lusk Lyman McKinnon Mc Nutt Manderson Manville Marbleton Meadow Acres Meadow Lark Lake Medicine Bow Meeteetse Midwest Mills Moorcroft Moose Wilson Road Mountain View Mountain View Newcastle North Rock Springs Oakley Opal Osage Owl Creek Parkman Pavillion Pine Bluffs Pinedale Pine Haven Point of Rocks Powder River Powell Purple Sage Rafter J Ranch Ralston Ranchester Ranchettes Rawlins Red Butte Reliance Riverside Riverton Robertson Rock River Rock Springs Rolling Hills Saratoga Sheridan Shoshoni Sinclair Slater Sleepy Hollow Smoot South Flat South Greeley South Park Star Valley Ranch Story Sundance Superior Sweeney Ranch Table Rock Taylor Ten Sleep Teton Village Thayne The Buttes Thermopolis Torrington Turnerville Upton Van Tassell Veteran Vista West Wamsutter Warren AFB Washakie Ten Sleep Washam West River Westview Circle Wheatland Wilson Winchester Woods Landing-Jelm Worland Wright YoderY-O Ranch\n\nI harkened back to the last few Scrapbooks to find my answers. Had not a certain Lou Anne Williams sent a letter to Mr. Fenn, it would be nearly impossible to find the chest.\n\nIn the first line, Lightning struck Forrest in the form of an email. This was the BLAZE. Lightning Creek where it intersects with Lance Creek. I had solved the puzzle. I was not going to leave my engine shut off until spring. I cranked the old heap over and floored it for Lusk. I would be brave to set foot on a place where Indians fought and Barnum Brown had found a dinosaur head. Moneta, Powder River, Casper, Glenrock, Douglas and Orin were all in my rear view mirror by the time I reached Lost Springs. Saddly, the sign coming into town listed a population of 1 and an elevation under 5000 feet. Where did I go wrong. Lightning had just struck and I had just passed Thunder Basin.\n\nWhy did I not have the treasure?\n\nI started to eliminate spots based on elevation. My second ideal spot was TEN SLEEP. Just how many times is the number 10 mentioned in the Scrapbook with the Letter from Lou Anne Williams. But the elevation at Ten Sleep was also under 5000 feet, but just barely. I continued to work on possible combinations that included Shell, Sinclair and the oil connection. But these ideas were just too slippery to hold onto. I hummed along like a well oiled machine on into the night. You might say that I was burning the midnight oil.\n\nI was exhausted and too tired to lie down and go to sleep because of my recurring nightmares. I did not want to end up like Joseph Stein and not have any gold for my efforts. But after sleeping for only about an hour, I started the Big W, as I was calling it, and headed for Medicine Bow.\n\nMedicine Bow is at the geographic coordinates: “Medicine Bow, Wyoming”,41.897778,-106.202778. The story of Indians finding wood from which to make the best bows and arrows in the land. (Brave and in The Wood) The fossils found on Como Ridge and Fossil Ridge. (Treasures old) . There are heavy loads and water high as mentioned in numerous accounts of the Medicine Bow River. The river itself looks like an umbilical cord. There is Barnum Brown who found one his most important discoveries at Como. It all lies in a basin where warm waters halted millions of years ago. Just above Medicine Bow is the locale of Wind Hill.( worth the cold north wind) There a confluence where the Pine Draw meets the Medicine Bow River.(more wood if you are not convinced). And there are treasures new with all of the oil production. And Forrest said to take the treasure and leave his bones. What a better place to do so than bone cabin quarry. I would imagine a marvel gaze or two were shared by the archeologists that discovered the cabin.\n\nSo let me recap.\n\nBone Cabin Quarry\n\nBone Cabin Quarry was a dinosaur quarry that laid approximately fifty-five miles northwest of Laramie, Wyoming near historic Como Bluff. During the summer of 1897 Walter W. Granger, a paleontologist from the American Museum of Natural History, came upon a hillside littered with Jurassic period dinosaur bone fragments. Nearby was a sheepherder’s cabin built entirely out of fossil bones, hence the name “Bone Cabin Quarry.” After Granger’s discovery in late August 1897, the quarry was kept secret until the summer of 1898, when the manpower could be amassed to undertake a full-scale excavation. Bone Cabin Quarry was excavated from 1898 until 1905, when the productivity of specimens thinned. Some of the dinosaurs found at the Bone Cabin Quarry include Stegosaurus, Allosaurus and Apatosaurus.\n\nAbout five miles southwest of Bone Cabin Quarry, a further quarry, called Nine Mile Quarry, was opened up in June 1899, near Nine Mile Crossing of Little Medicine Bow River. An incomplete Brontosaurus skeleton was recovered.\n\nNine Clues, nine mile quarry.\n\nIt all adds up to the poem.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT\n\nOf course, I may be all wrong because although I am made of wood, I do not have a lead center and cannot be the sharpest pencil in the box. It is probably over in the Medicine Bow National Park, somewhere between Brown Peak and Medicine bow peak. Probably close to the lost lake. But highway 130 is closed for the winter, so I am shutting my engine off.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPinocchio.\n\na tempestuous northerly wind began to blow and roar angrily, and it beat the poor puppet from side to side, making him swing violently, like the clatter of a bell ringing for a wedding. And the swinging gave him atrocious spasms…. His breath failed him and he could say no more. He shut his eyes, opened his mouth, stretched his legs, gave a long shudder, and hung stiff and insensible\n\nCONTINUED FROM THE WYOMING TREASURE HUNT.\n\nI had shut my engine off, but I was not retreating. I had not pulled my trailer and snowmobile all the way to Wyoming for nothing. In the words of Douglas MacArthur “We are not retreating-we are advancing in another Direction.” I had nearly worn a hole in the carpet of the Winebago while I was sorting through the information that I had gathered about The 9 Mile Quarry.. Besides, the Ghost had not disappeared, the Wolf was closing in, and the Cat had finally gotten out of the water and there could be over 30 thousand other searchers close to the treasure. I had to get there first.\n\nEarly Bird\n\nOh, if you’re a bird, be an early bird\n\nAnd catch the worm for your breakfast plate.\n\nIf you’re a bird, be an early early bird—\n\nBut if you’re a worm, sleep late.\n\n~Shel Silverstein\n\nMy wooden legs clattered together and my arms nearly splintered as I spent the next two nights with my special vision equipment prospecting for the treasure. I doug and pressed on working diligently like a beaver. I almost turned blue from all of the cold air that was entering my lungs as I struggled in the high altitude to catch my breath. I was risking all my worldly possessions in hopes of finding the gold. Was it worth it?\n\nFortunately, it was a full moon and it appeared that no one was going to interrupt my night operations. The metal detector was working great and I was covering a lot of ground with little effort. It was at about 3 am on the second night of prospecting that I had an emotional experience that changed the course of my search and later led to the treasure. I thought to myself, I could spend the rest of my life looking for the exact spot of the treasure and spend numerous nights in jail if I got caught. There must be an easier way. I grabbed my prospecting equipment and retreated to my RV for study and reflection.\n\nI began to think of the poem. My home of brown was a specific brown in name only. Barnum Brown had a finite life and could not pass the 1000 year test. While important to the field or anthropology, Brown had very little to do with Tarry Scants and Marvel Gazes. Moreover, he did not BLAZE anything. I must have the wrong BROWN. Brown must be a landmark and not a person.\n\nIt was at this point that the universe converged and a flood of information washed across my mind eroding away my dinosaur like thinking. I had been stuck in the stone age looking for fossils. The treasure was hid in the modern era. It was not bones that I was looking for, it was gold. Once again, I had it all wrong. It was not petrified wood that I was looking for, it was modern wood like mahogany forests filled with great wood for making medicine, bows, rail road ties, logs, covered wagons, fence posts, and fishing boats. I had been brave and in the petrified wood, I needed to be brave and in some more modern wood like an Indian Bow or perhaps a stick man. Somewhat ironic that Pinoccio had not thought of this earlier.\n\nMostly in the form of scrapbooks, but matching the poem, I started to think of telephone lines in the shape of umbilical cords, lost lakes, forks in the drawer, old classic cars like Plymouth and Nash, baseball teams from New York, heather or meadows, a hundred years is a centennial, the picture of the granite in his shower matches the granite peaks of Medicine Bow and Browns Peak. But wait, there is more, School House Rock, Gold Hill, Old Main, Mirror Lake, Lookout Lake, Twin Lakes, Fishhook Lake, Mutt Lake and Sheep Lake are all within a TEN Mile radius.\n\nI had solved the puzzle, but I was in the wrong place. I needed to be where my post script led me. I needed to be in the Medicine Bow National Park. BRIGGS HAD IT RIGHT. He WAS IN THE WRONG Park. But where in this TEN mile area?\n\nAt this point, we should pause for a short interlude about some research that I had done on the Snowy Range within the Medicine Bow National Park.\n\nCentennial is about 45 miles west of Laramie at the foot of the Snowy Range. Its history is that of failed dreams, in the words of Cheyenne historian Robert G. Rosenberg it is a “mere footnote in the mining history of the western United States.” According to Rosenberg, the mining rushes in 1876, 1902,, and 1923-1924 “were largely based ‘on wishful thinking, irresponsible distortion of the facts by the media, and promotional schemes.‘” Historic American Engineering Record, file No. WY-16\n\nThe first settlement in the area of present day Centennial were tie camps established in 1868 to provide railroad ties to the Union Pacific with the first homestead the following year. Shortly thereafter, the tie hacks had to withdraw from the area due to disagreements with the Indians. In 1875 by I. P. Lambing of Golden, Colorado, discovered the Centennial Mine named in honor of the country’s hundredth anniversary. In 1877, the vein of gold ended at a fault. The continuation of the vein on the other side of the fault has never been found. Thus, the original mines failed. Prospectors continued to hope.\n\nThe most important of the promotional schemes were those of Isaac Van Horn, Fred A. Miller, and Edward R. Miller. On May 16, 1905, the Acme Consolidated Gold & Mining Company, capitalized at $1,000,000.00 was organized under the laws of the State of Wyoming with Isaac Van Horn, President; Arthur S. Howe, Secretary and Treasurer, and Fred A. Miller, as general manager.\n\nAcme was a holding company for the Acme Gold & Copper Mining Co. and had an interlocking board of directors with the Laramie, Hahn’s Peak and Pacific Railroad Company and the Northern Colorado Coal Co. both of which were also incorporated under Wyoming Law and had their respective business offices in Laramie. One prospectus for the three companies was issued under the name “Boswyocolo Company.” The prospectus promised that the companies were “a new idea in finance; illustrated with views in such a way that its legitimate and sound basis cannot be questioned by the most conservative.” The Company had acquired mining rights in Gold Hill about 35 miles east of Saratoga. The initial destination of the Laramie, Hahn’s Peak and Pacific was to be Gold Hill to serve the Acme Mine.\n\nThe gold caused all kinds of excitement in Carbon, the closest point on the railroad. A stamping mill was installed. The Union Pacific made Carbon a regular stop for the expected hordes of gold miners. The gold rush, however, ended as fast as it started. At the end of 1891, Professor A.A. Johannson in the first Annual Report of the Wyoming Agricultural College (The University of Wyoming) & Experimental Station wrote:\n\n“THE GOLD HILL MINING DISTRICT. The Gold Hill camp was opened in 1890. The veins on the surface were large, strong and very rich, but unfortunately at a depth of 200 feet the ore was not worth milling. A stamp mill was erected and about $3,000 in gold was extracted.\n\nWith the failure of the railroad and mining companies, Col. Van Horn moved to Florida. By 1922, he had established an oil company to drill for oil in the Green Swamp of Polk County, Florida. On the edge of the swamp and on the shores of Lake Agnes and Mud Lake he established a new town named “Polk City.” The town, at an elevation of 200 feet, was promoted as being in the “Scenic lands” of Florida. After seven years of searching for oil without success, Col. Van Horn pulled his drilling rigs out of the swamp.\n\nThe history of mining in the Centennial Ridge and the Douglas Creek and Keystone Mining Districts has been one of periodic gold and copper rushes following by periods of disappointment.\n\nRumors circulated since the 1850’s of gold in the Douglas Creek area. Allegedly, a member of Sir St. George’s hunting expedition discovered gold in the area. The first confirmed discovery of placer gold was by Iram H. Moore in 1868. Douglas Kearns apparently discovered gold along Beaver Creek two miles east of Encampment about 1878. The Keystone was a copper mine owned at first by the Kearns Consolodated Copper Mines Co. which in 1004 was absorbed into the Keystone Mining & Development Co. In 1891, the New York Times reported the discovery of silver at Gold Hill at the head of Brush Creek\n\nThe Queen Mine and the Joker Mine, are in the Centennial Ridge and Douglas Mining Districts, located about 2-3 miles from Centennial. The Joker is located at 9,620 ft. elevation .7 miles south of Rambler. It requires about a third of a mile hike through timber\n\nHope that there is gold in them thar hills springs eternal. The Wyoming State Geological Survey announced that a sample rock had been found at Centennial Ridge that was “highly anomolous in gold,” leading to the possibility that the gold vein may yet be found. As you can see from this brief history, in some instances rather than being found in pockets of ignious rocks or along stream beds, it was found in pockets of the gullible .\n\nI awoke in the town of Centennial having driven the remainder of the night from the Fossil Beds near Como to the Historic Centennial Railroad Depot. This is a very nice museum with an old Union Pacific Railroad car and numerous pieces of old mining equipment. Of particular interest to me was the Beehive Burner. For some reason, it’s cone shape reminded me of a nose. I later learned that in the 1920s; Lars Ingermanson, Vern Anderson, and Les Bayh built this burner from scratch. It was used as part of their lumber operation through the 1950s and originally stood on a hill on the north side of the highway, across from the museum. So what is a beehive burner?\n\nGeorge Dabich Teepees compared to the Beehive Burner (below)\n\nA wood waste burner, known as a teepee burner or wigwam burner in the United States and a beehive burner in Canada, is a free-standing conical steel structure ranging from 30 to 60 feet in height. They are named for their resemblance to beehives, teepees or wigwams. A sawdust burner is cylindrical. They have an opening at the top that is covered with a steel grill or mesh to keep sparks and glowing embers from escaping. Sawdust and wood scraps are delivered to an opening near the top of the cone by means of a conveyor belt or Archimedes’ screw, whereupon they fall onto the fire near the center of the structure.\n\nTeepee or beehive burners are used to dispose of waste wood in logging yards and sawdust from sawmills by burning. As a result they produce a large quantity of smoke and ash, which is vented directly into the atmosphere without any sort of scrubbing or cleaning, contributing to poor air conditions wherever they are used.[citation needed] The burners are considered to be a major source of air pollution and are being phased out in most areas.\n\nI HAD JUST FOUND THE BLAZE!\n\nI did not know whether to be terrified or delusional with excitement. Early in my treasure hunting days, I had nearly been consumed by a blaze but had luckily escaped with just a few tooth pick sized burn spots on my feet. I was fortunate enough to not fall in the firehole. Now, I was at the threshold of another even larger blaze used specifically for the purposes of disposing of wood. Dual thoughts of finding the treasure and being reduced to ash filled my mind like the emitting smoke of a wigwam burner. The smell of burning pine and sage entered my now gigantic nose and calmed my splintered mind about the treasure and being consumed by fire. I retreated from the beehive burner and paused to reflect on the weekly words that instructed me to “Retreat to a Warm Place.” This was a warm place to some, but it was no place that I wanted to stay for very long. Some wayward forrester could easily do away with me by throwing me down the beehive burner.\n\nI had to get moving soon, all of the old logging tools in the NICI SELF Museum were making me very nervous. I did not want to end up like my brothers and sisters and be made into useful tools like sawhorses, boat oars, fans, or the timbers that make up the rafters in an adobe.\n\nOnce again, I remembered a scrapbook where a tree or a group of trees had disappeared from a certain landscape feature on a hill near Forrests Fenn’s home. This was a special tree with a carved figure of a stickman. Forrest lamented that the stickman and the tree would no longer stand and he would need to plant new trees as old men do. THERE WAS NO WAY IN HELL’S CREEK that this could not be the blaze. Where in Centennial was the treasure?\n\nhttp://www.themountainviewhotel.com/webCam.html\n\nYou can google the streetview of Centennial if you want to relive the experience described below.\n\nI spent the rest of the day looking for the treasure in Centennial. There was a large cottonwood log by the community church. A huge assortment of modern day four wheel conveyances (cars, trucks and buses) were lined up in front of the trading post. There were almost every color of the rainbow represented from red to green to blue to yellow. Almost too many to choose from. Close by was the art gallery and up on the hill sat my Winebago. Just to the west was a load of newly cut logs sitting on a trailer. All of this was just a few feet from the Blaze and the MOUNTAIN VIEW HOTEL. (marvel gaze) It was surreal. Across the street was the Country Junction store with an old Buckboard, Log Wagon and a Tractor. A few more modern day conveyances and a corvette were parked in front. And who could miss the ice cream cone. I continue on up the Street to the Old Corral Steak house and on towards the Friendly Store. It was here that I saw the Black and White Ford. Now I had encountered this situation back in New Mexico and it did not result in me having the treasure. I remembered a story about a whitey ford and new that I must be closing in on the treasure. And I was. Just up the road about 200 feet was the Bear Tree Tavern with a Dancing Bear on its sign. And at the back door of the Saloon was an ice machine. Now being the middle of winter in the rocky mountains, the meaning of being worth the cold had all sorts of meanings. It reminded me of a story about selling ice to Eskimos and how as a child my mom would always tell me the Eskimos would rub their noses together.\n\nAND NOW I BRING YOU A MUSICAL INTERLUDE –enjoy\n\nI returned to the front door of the tavern sat down at the bar. A chestnut haired women with fair skin approached to take my order. She was about 2 feet tall, had a small perfect nose. She did appear to have some excess hair on her lip. She introduced me to her daughter, a band started to play and everyone in the bar started to yodle and dance. For some reason I was oddly attracted to her. I suspect stories like this are common in Wyoming country. . We became fast friends, I called her a hairlip and she called me a wood eye, and we shared a laugh.\n\nI ordered an O’Douls beer and I struck up another conversation. She asked, “what is an old piece of wood like you doing in a place like this?” I replied by telling her about Forrest Fenn and a Treasure he had hidden in the Rocky Mountains North of Santa Fe. She seemed more interested in the story than most people I had encountered in New Mexico and the other parts of Wyoming. I continued with his stories about Yellowstone. She interrupted. “Are you referring the outfitter and flymaker that provided guide services at Yellowstone?” I said yes, one and the same. She seemed very interested so I was about to continue when another customer at the end of the bar yelled “Lou Ann, I need a Killians, Red.”\n\nLou Anne and the Treasure\n\nLou Anne returned to my end of the bar and asked me to continue with my story of Forrest Fenn. I explained how all the clues pointed to the treasure being in Centennial and that I was there to find it. I showed her the poem and she shook her head in agreement on all my solutions to the 9 clues. We discussed the poem and compared notes on into the night. It was almost midnight by now and all of the customers had retreated to their homes. It was just Lou Anne and myself warming ourselves by the propane heater.\n\nAt this point, Lou Anne interrupted and started to tell her own stories about Yellowstone and Forrest Fenn. She said that “as a child she had often vacationed up, over the divide, and into the Lamar River Basin. These were the most special days of her youth. Though her sister was there for the horses, her mom, dad, brother and Lou Anne were all there for the fishing. One time, Lou Anne caught a brown trout that was so big it would not fit into the anglers creel. She went on to explain how she had met Bob Adams who provided guide services to her family.\n\nMy mind was spinning like a wooden top in a tornado. I could barely keep still, my heart was pounding with excitement. It was all coming together for me like a miter joint in a cabinet factory. Plainly speaking, I could not contain myself any longer. At this point, I just had to ask if her sisters name was Lou Ellen.\n\nLou Anne paused for a minute. Her cheeks turned as red as her chestnut hair, her eyes became evil looking and her hand flung back like a spring on a mouse trap and she slapped my face like a mallet hitting a croquet ball. She exclaimed “Get the Hell out of my bar!” “ I have not spoken kindly of that Harlot in years, she stole our family money and is wasting it trying to find that DAMN treasure you are yammering about.”\n\nWhile working to put my huge nose back in place, I proclaimed,”so you ARE Lou Ellen Williams sister?”\n\nLou Anne laughed as a puzzled look came upon her face. She asked “Who is Lou Ellen Williams?” “ My last name is Ingermanson, I do not know of any Williams around here, we are mostly Andersons, Bayhs and Van Horns.”\n\nIt was a case of mistaken identity.\n\nShe apologized for the slap that nearly took my nose off. I asked her to come with me to look for the treasure. She declined for obvious reasons. She wished me luck and I promised to help her out if I found the treasure. We parted as friends.\n\nAs was my luck with women, I headed back to the RV alone.\n\nIt was about 27 degrees when I unloaded the snowmobile off the trailer at the Snowy (any weather, it is still called SNOWY) Range Ski and Recreation Area. My plan was to deceive the Park Manager into believing I was on vacation when I was really looking for the treasure. I was secretly going to leave the recreation area and follow the closed portion of Highway 130 up to a small access road that leads towards the Summit of Brown Peak. The road goes past the Green Rock Picnic Site along the Nash Fork River. Just a few miles on further up the road are the Centenial Fuel stop and the Mountain Meadow Cabins. At the State Road Junction, I was to take the right fork and take Road 317 up to the fork near the Open air chapel. Here, I would take the left fork and follow Telephone Creek by taking State Road 332 to the bridge over Telephone Creek. You may note that telephone creek meanders like an umbilical cord. I would continue to follow 332 back over to Highway 130. My plan was to avoid the ranger stations by taking the more scenic route over the back high country. Once back onto 130, I would turn at the next right onto Forest Road 346 and on up to the Lake.\n\nBy the time I got started, falling snow and the wind created a dense curtain.. All the way up the road I was in second gear. My tracks were quickly covered by a blanket of snow. The road ended around the next curve. I needed to swing in where a small opening existed between the trees. I flashed my lantern, I could see a draw that was the start of the pine creek trail. The storm was getting worse. It was going to be a blizzard. I stood in awe at the snow now piling up higher and higher. I suddenly felt more alone than I had in all my life. It took me a half hour to cover the first half mile. After a few more 200 yards, I followed the creek bank the trail itself was covered. Wandering off into the gullies would result in certain death. The cold crept into me deeper. The world was narrowing around me. I tripped twice over fallen logs struggling to plow through the drifting snow. I lost track of time and distance. There was only chaos ahead of me. I dropped my lantern but was able to retrieve it. I continued on. Then the cold and fatique was working on me. I would soon be wandering in circles with the last step being the end of me.\n\nSuddenly the blinding snow ceased and the hills were alive with the sound of a Blue Nose Pitbull dog barking. The “woof”, “woof”, was coming from a cabin near Telephone Creek. The barking kept getting louder and louder, so it must be real. In the wierd nighmare of the blizzard I had been thinking this was all a delusion. Next a blaze of light came through the door of the cabin as the door sprung open. Standing in front of me was Lou Ellen.\n\nAssault on the Mountain\n\nLou Ellen Ingermanson was holding a pick axe in one hand and a shot gun in the other. She had a steeley grey look in her eyes and her face showed the many tales of a hard life.\n\nShe spoke with an accent:\n\n“My sister arrived last night and said you might be coming. I have been looking for Damn Treasure for more than five years now. I saw you in the bar last night talking to my sister. Do you really think I was going to let you march right up here and have it?”\n\nLou Anne peered around the corner of the door shaking with fear. Her evil sister, who for the most part had controlled her entire life since the time they returned from their trip to Yellowstone, wacked Lou Anne with the blunt end of the pick axe and knocked her unconscious.\n\nThe cabin was in a mess, all the drawers of the cabinets were pulled open, the silverware was strewn across the floor. The refridgerator door was open, the sink was filled with dirty dishes, the curtains were ripped off the hangers. And the laundry was piled up by the washing machine. There were definitely signs of a great struggle. And the dog just kept barking. “Woof, Woof, Woof”\n\nAlthough the blizzard had just subsided, Lou Ellen readied the shotgun at my back and pointed me in the direction of Medicine Bow Trail. She handed me the pick axe and said over there.\n\nShe motioned to a clearing covered by a small tarp with hole about the size of a 10×10 box. Sorrounding it was a grove of trees, one of which had an odd figure carved in its trunk. It looked like the figure of a stick man. She said ” That hole is not nearly big enough to fit your old wooden matchstick of a body into. ”\n\n“Start digging.”\n\nI must have dug for more than an hour increasing the size of the hole large enough to fit a full size marionette. I was struggling to find anything among the roots of that sturdy old tree. Suddenly, I hit a solid object with the end of the pick axe. Unfortunately, it was only a rock. I continued to dig finding one rock after another. Finally after 3 hours of digging, She said “You can stop now.” She raised the shotgun. ……I was preparing for the end .. But at this moment she said. ” If its not here, then where is it?”\n\nI paused for a moment. Was she really asking me where I thought the treasure was? Is this a trick? How should I answer? Was there an answer? Could it be answered without revealing too much? I finally decided to answer her question with a question. I had to do it.\n\n“Rawgabbit , have you ever looked for the treasure in New Mexico?”\n\nThe gun went off and the pellets narrowly missed me as I dove into the hole.\n\nThe dog barked.\n\nThe tree behind me was not so lucky, as the carved stickman was now peppered with holes like a woodpecker trying to find larve and worms. The stick figure would no longer grace the tree in the forrest that meandered its way around the cabin at Telephone Creek.\n\nBy the time Lou Ellen and I returned from the end of Medicine Bow trail, Lou Anne had recovered consciousness and was hiding in the kitchen with a large boat oar. She came at Lou Ellen with all the energy she could muster from her tiny 42 pound body. Lou Ellen fell to the floor like a row boat going over a waterfall. She would not be paddling up any creeks this day.\n\nLou Anne lamented about her sister:\n\nThat greedy sister of mine, always had imagination but she became complacent after she fell off the horse up there in yellowstone. She just turned mean. She was obsessed with money and seemed to gamble everything she earned in hopes of striking it rich. When she heard about the Forrest Fenn Treasure, she sold all of our mining properties and railroad stock and went out looking for the treasure.. I had not heard from her for over five years until I returned the the cabin last night. The money must have finally ran out.\n\nThere was a nock at the door. It was Ranger Sloan from the Forrest Service. “I heard shots up here and saw a big hole over by the tree row. Is every body okay?”\n\nRanger Sloan\n\nRanger Sloan had moved to Wyoming to escape the trappings of modern day life. He enjoyed the simple pleasures of folk tales, art and the history of America. Some say his name was made up to include the word Eric. But who is to say. Ranger Sloan had purchased a barn up over the divide and had restored it from its dilapidated state into a museum the housed old tools used in the woodworking crafts. Some of my relatives are on display at the museum.\n\nAnd then there is the Art that Ranger Sloan created, from the murals he painted on signs all across America to the masterpieces that hang in modern museums. Ranger sloan did his part to ensure that Americas History and treasures would be preserved. He was now the Ranger at the Telephone creek station, and his presence could not be good news to Lou Anne and me.\n\nLou Anne, who knew Ranger Sloan, started to explain what had happened. She was shaking and could barely get words out of her mouth. “Ranger, that is my sister over there, she held me hostage last night, struck me in the head and took Pinoccio out into the woods to retrieve the Forrest Fenn Treasure. When they returned, I hit her with the boat oar.”\n\nRanger Sloan interrupted. “No need to explain, Lou Anne. We got a tip that Lou Ellen may be in the area and I was coming to see if she had returned to the cabin.” “She has warrants in New Mexico for Trespassing.”\n\nRanger Sloan attached the cuffs to Lou Ellen’s hands and escorted her out of the cabin. I was relieved and was thankful that I had not been arrested for the transgressions that I had just committed in getting to the cabin on telephone creek. Lou Anne gazed into my eyes and mine into hers.\n\nWould Lou Anne Ingermanson and I have a future together?\n\nLou Anne or the treasure\n\nI was attracted to Lou Anne, her chestnut hair glistened as the sun reflected off of her buttons and bows. Her blue eyes were as blue as the 2000 lakes in Wyoming and her perfect nose rubbed up against mine as we shared an Eskimo Kiss. I could see myself with Lou Anne exploring the rocky mountains looking for the treasure and one day finding it. She was perfect in every way I could imagine.\n\nBut, I had asked Lou Anne earlier if she would join me on the adventure of a lifetime and she had backed away as quickly as I had asked. Was it worth putting my heart out again in hopes of finding the love of my life?\n\nI thought to myself, it would not be fair to Lou Anne to ask her to join me. Her sister was being taken to jail, the cabin was in a shambles and the only thing she had left was The Bear Tree Tavern. I held and comforted Lou Anne reassuring her that tomorrow was another day and with mental help, her sister could recover, we could pick up the pieces around the cabin and she had the Tavern to run.\n\nShe quickly swept up the floor, hung the curtains and got the house in order. I, meanwhile, worked on cutting the tree down and filling in the hole in the back yard. We promised not to speak of what had happened ever again.\n\nWhat I was about to do would break my heart. My obsession over finding the treasure was so stong that it overpowered my better senses of a happy life along the Telephone creek.\n\n….As I waved goodbye to Lou Anne, I wondered if I had made the biggest mistake of my life.\n\nThere is Gold In Them Thar Hills.\n\nWith my heart broken, I returned to my quest. Alone and in the woods, I worked through the night to come up with a plan to get the treasure. My original intent was to go to Gold Hill, but this affair with Lou Anne and Lou Ellen had sidetracked me..\n\nI had given up one treasure for only the possibility of finding another.\n\nThe thought of Lou Anne was in the back of my mind as I pulled out a good map of the area around Gold Hill. I was now at a cabin at the end of Telephone creek and I needed to get by Lookout Lake over the Snowy Range and not be taken in by Sucker Reservior. I would then need to ford Brush Creek and put in on one side or the other of the Ryan Brothers lake. The best route looked to be on the south side just on the North banks of Keystone. I would then follow Brush Creek over to Arrastre Creek. From here, I could summit Gold Hill from a westerly approach. The elevation was perfect at just over 10000 feet.\n\nI spent nearly a week looking for the treasure near the trail along phantom lake. Especially close to the old cabin . But I could not find the treasure.\n\nAt this point, I am now convinced that the treasure could not possibly be in Wyoming. My heart lie elsewhere and I had other things to do.\n\nA Christmas Story\n\nI took the next two weeks off and enjoyed Christmas with my family. My family enjoyed some cooked goose, lingonberries, oostacaca, mashed potatoes with Brown gravy and my moms special home made bread. It was a meal fit for a King.. . . We ate everything, there were hardly any left overs. Unfortunately, I felt like I should be drinking O’Douls and eating crow prepared over an open fire…..somewhere in Wyoming.\n\nAfter we placed the few leftovers in the refridgerator, washed and dryed the dishes; it was time to open presents. My family always buys way to much junk and opening presents becomes an adventure. And alot of it is really just silly. My brother likes to wrap up last years gifts and see if anyone notices, and my mom wraps up old wood tools and presents them to me as being new. My nephew likes to take a small package, wrap it in a box, put that box in another box, then put that box in yet another box. of course all of these boxes are wrapped in different paper with some odd theme. My favorite is to wrap a note in a box, that leads to another box, that has a box with a note in it, this note then leads you to another package hidden in another spot and so on. One time , it took my youngest nephew nearly 1/2 hour to find ……………a pair of Nike shoes. A heap of Christmas paper litters the living room when we are finished and we end up sorting through the paper to find our gifts.\n\nThe economy is not very good these days.\n\nI had few weeks of time off due to the shutdown at the door and window factory. It was a temporary layoff, the owners apparently needed some dough. My brother had also been furloughed from the cabinet factory. Luckily, both of us were able to make a little extra money. In fact, the whole family was able to get some seasonal work hanging around on an old Christmas tree. It felt almost normal to be dangling from some strings and having others look at us with a marvel gaze. Did I mention we were brave and in the wood. Besides, it was something we could do as a family and we needed the money.\n\n(I am the one on theleft, my brother is in the middle and my mom is on the right)\n\nNext year, we hope to get some rolls in the Nutcracker.\n\nI was feeling sad. My beard had grown in, the hair on my chest was turning white, and I had nearly lost all of my hair on my head. I also had a runny nose. At the stroke of midnight on New Years eve, I looked in the mirror hoped that I would not have another year of bad luck. Auld Lang Sine was playing and the log on the fire had just stopped burning . My 50th birthday was in April and I really wanted to find the treasure before then.\n\nMONTANA\n\nThe states’ name is derived from the Spanish word montaña (mountain). Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but it was eventually decided that the Committee on Territories could name it whatever they wanted, so the original name of Montana was adopted.\n\nMontana is famous for its Blue Sky. Montana has several nicknames, although none official,[5] including “Big Sky Country” and “The Treasure State”, and slogans that include “Land of the Shining Mountains” and more recently “The Last Best Place”.[6] Montana is ranked fourth in size.\n\nThe mountains of Montana began forming 170 million years ago when ancient rocks were forced eastward up and over much younger rock strata. Known as the Lewis Overthrust, these sedimentary rocks are considered to have some of the finest fossilized examples of extremely early life found anywhere on Earth\n\nThe Bitterroot Mountains—one of the longest continuous ranges in the entire Rocky Mountain chain from Alaska to Mexico[24]—along with smaller ranges, including the Coeur d’Alene Mountains and the Cabinet Mountains, divide the state from Idaho. The southern third of the Bitterroot range blends into the Continental Divide.[25] Other major mountain ranges west of the Divide include the Cabinet Mountains, the Anaconda Range, the Missions, the Garnet Range, Sapphire Mountains, and Flint Creek Range\n\nThere was so much Montana and so little time, the winter months had set in and the task of finding the treasure in Montana was going to be exhausting. I had learned from my earlier experiences in New Mexico and Wyoming, that is was best to a have a plan. A specific spot should be found before putting boots on the ground. Besides, there are often sharp objects on the ground and avoiding them is the best plan.\n\nMy first inclination was to look in Hell’s creek.. I had an earlier dream about a red haired operator of a house of ill repute that I thought was promising. It was complimented by a story of an Indian that had traded a secret about a lode of silver for a pocket watch. In the end, the watch did not work, the wayward railroad executive went over a cliff on a train and the Lone Ranger got the girl.. My fascination with the actress Helena waned and I lost interest in that possible solution. Besides it all happened in Utah and the elevation was not right. Elevation seemed to be a good way to eliminate areas. I chose not to go to look at Helena too.. perhaps that was a mistake.\n\nI seemed to be making a lot of mistakes with women……..\n\nThere were several other areas of interest. One just on the Montana/Idaho border which involved a multistate solution to the treasure location, another involving Kings and Drummonds, a third one involving a pilot and yet another involving a beehive. But the most promising ones seemed to involve a connection with Yellowstone Park and/or Lewis and Clark…….. which one would be the right one.\n\nWhere to look in Montana\n\n“If you are looking in more than one spot, you do not have a solution to the poem.”\n\nI had been ignoring this advice and driving aimless around in circles in both New Mexico and Wyoming. Instead of jumping in the RV, I decided to work through the solutions on the internet with google maps, Wikipedia and other research material. I ordered The Thrill of the Chase because it was only selling for half price on ebay and the guy was throwing in a metal detector and a solution to the poem with it. The book store was getting well over 70 bucks for it and no solution. Was it a good investment, I would need to wait 5 days for standard shipping because I was too miserly to spend the extra money for overnight shipping.\n\nPilot Peak Possibilities\n\nSeveral hints and clues pointed me in the direction of the Pilot connection as the solution to getting the gold. This brought me to Pilot Peak.\n\nPilot Peak is a striking pinnacle in the immediate northeast of Yellowstone National Park, visible along US-212 highway which approaches the park from the direction of Bilings, Montana. It is part of volcanic Absaroka Range which forms the massive eastern escarpment of Yellowstone Plateau. US-212 highway is the highest road in the Yellowstone area, reaching 10940 feet elevation at Beartooth Pass, about 20 miles east of Pilot Peak. This stretch of highway winds through a spectacular alpine country, and is designated the “Beartooth Scenic Byway”. Granite Peak, Montana’s highest, is not far to the northeast. The name Pilot Peak, and it’s obvious neighbor, Index Peak, refer to the alignment of the two summits. From the north, they line up to resemble the sight on a mariner’s sextant. They proved invaluable to pioneers of the Greater Yellowstone region since they, along with the nearby Tetons, mark the boundaries of the steaming plateau known as Colter’s Hell. The Washburn expedition in 1870, credited with ‘discovering’ Yellowstone Park, used Pilot Peak to guide them to the rim of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and the incredible Geyser Basins beyond. This expedition, armed with photographs by Jackson and paintings by Thomas Moran, convinced Congress to pass the Organic Act of 1872, creating the world’s first National Park. The words are inscribed on the Roosevelt Arch outside of Gardiner, Montana: “…to be preserved … for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.”\n\nThere are two main trails that access this peak. The shortest begins just south of Cooke City at the Republic Pass trailhead. After about 1/2 mile, Woody Creek trail breaks off to the left. Follow this creek, then Hayden Creek to the large basin west of the Pilot-Index saddle. Excellent camping can be found here. Climbs of Pilot and Index peaks begin from the saddle. The long way is via the Pilot Creek trail that starts east of Cooke City on US 212. The trail is marked by a brown USFS sign, and begins just off the road. This approach requires about 8 miles of hiking to gain the more difficult north and east faces of Pilot Peak.\n\nMy better sense seemed to steer me away from Pilots Peak. Earlier I had thought that White Rock NM was related to the story about flying over Philiadelphia and the Tea with Olga Story had lead me astray to Taos. Following the vapor trail of a pilot did not seem like a good plan.\n\nBeehive Burns Me Again\n\nBeehive, Montana seemed like a logical choice for the location of the Treasure. After all, I was all so close to finding the treasure in Wyoming at the Beehive Burner in Centennial.\n\nOh Centinnial, Oh Centinnial, my mind drifted into a fantasy of me and Lou Anne rubbing noses and holding hands. The warm fire warming our feet as the snow fell outside a cabin. Music was playing, the world was in balance. She was my Queen and I was her King. There was no treasure hunt, no deadlines, my mind was at peace with the world.\n\nJust then, the smell of burning meat set of the smoke alarm and I was awoken from my Daydream. I had forgotten about the Lamb Chops in the oven. I quickly tended to the oven, put out the grease fire and cleaned up the mess.\n\nI returned to my computer for more research. I was a worker bee. I googled the map of the area and a quick Wikipedia. I nearly dropped everything I was doing when I found out that Nye was just a few miles from Beehive and both were along the Stillwater Creek.\n\nBeehive was established as a town in a deep valley along the Stillwater River west of Absarokee. Beehive had a post office from 1910 to 1953. The community still thrives as a getaway destination with many seasonal mountain homes\n\nNye was originally a copper mining camp, the town sprang into existence when Jack Nye and the Hedges brothers staked their claim. Mining continues to be an important part of the area’s economy. The Nye area was originally settled as a mining community around the 1860s when gold was discovered in the nearby mountains. All mining was suspended in 1868 due to controversy surrounding the western borders of the Crow Indian Reservation. In 1882 a new survey revealed that the mining operations were not located within the reservation boundries.\n\nA quick check of the elevations of the area indicated that Forrest had already eliminated this area based on elevation. Alas, the end was not drawing NYE.\n\nKing of Drummonds?\n\nKing Mountain looked to be promising At this point, I had learned to check elevation first, before going to Wikipedia. At over 6,000 feet, this was going to be a good one. I was particularly interest in the town of Drummond, Home of the Bullshippers. Remeber Forrest wrote the Book “The Beat of the Drum and the Whoop of the Dance.” Would I be dancing soon?\n\nDrummond, Montana lies in a mountainous area with the beautiful Flint Creek Valley as one of its many scenic areas. It is also known as Tree City USA.\n\nKing Mountain Recorder —1985 publisher M.E.\n\n“Smitty” Messerschmidt asked master farmer Billy to write up sales results and cattle prices from the Old Sales Barn.\n\nEventually the weekly stats morphed into a personal column,“Bullshipping with Billy.”\n\nBilly was promised $3 per column. And he got it. That first week.\n\nHe’s been bullshipping for free ever since.\n\n“I’m good for nothin’,” quips Billy, 50, a full-time character and part time farmer and curiosity seeker.\n\nHis column often saluted friends, which is everyone (“You’re only a stranger to me once,” Billy says).\n\nNow he mostly writes about“the old days” and “anything that tickles the funnybone” via audio tapes transcribed at the newspaper.\n\nBilly is slightly profane, sharp as a tack and totally fun. His bald head and huge nose do not go unnoticed. Prepare for epic storytelling.\n\n“He is the true bullshipper,” says King Mountain Recorder editor and publisher I. P Freeley. “He’s the guy who seems to know it all, and he’ll tell you about it, too. What I enjoy is just sitting down and listening to him.”\n\nBilly was born and raised on a farm near Greene. His dad, William emigrated from Finland..\n\nWilliam was a prolific wine-maker. Hence, Billy cannot stand wine.\n\n“Finnish policy,” he says.\n\nHe worked 25 years in the farm business, starting at age 17. His state championship bowling team was called the Short Horns.\n\n“I’ve shipped more bulls than anyone goin’,” Billy says. “I bought cattle like a drunken pilot.”” I bought ’em in bunches like bananas.”\n\nHe came to King Mountain, when the only pavement in town was along Highway 9. As mayor, he oversaw street paving, the addition of new greens at the Country Club and construction of a sewage lagoon, city water tower, public library and the Community Nut House, where Billy now resides.\n\n“I shouldn’t even be here,” he says.\n\nBut he is, thank gosh.\n\n“Billys the true businessman,” Freeley said. “He’s the guy who went through life as a salesman, basically. He sold a ton of cattle. He’s a great guy, really cares about Drummonds, loves the community. He’s that kind of a guy.”\n\nBilly has missed some weeks with his column due to his farm business. One of his favorite stories involves the time he went off to join the Marines without telling anyone.\n\nThe enlistment didn’t take. Billy was convinced to return home and help his dad on the farm. He never did hear back from the Marines.\n\nOf course, that’s a whole ’nother story.\n\n“I just write what comes out naturally,” Billy says. “Everybody is tickled, especially when I write about the old days.”\n\nAND NOW A TIP OF THE HAT TO OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS: Briggs are you listening?\n\nBulldog Drummond is a British fictional character, created by H. C. McNeile and published under his pen name “Sapper”. After an unsuccessful one-off appearance as a policeman in The Strand Magazine, the character was reworked by McNeile into a gentleman adventurer for his 1920 novel Bulldog Drummond\n\nDrummond is characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an “apparently brainless hunk of a man“,[11] He is six feet tall, weighs around 14 stone,[12] and has a “cheerful type of ugliness which inspires immediate confidence in its owner”.[13] Throughout his exploits, Drummond is joined by several of his ex-army friends and colleagues. Drummond is a gentleman with a private income;[7] he is also be construed as “a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact [sic] the war”,[17] although the character was later described by Cecil Day-Lewis as an “unspeakable public school bully”.[18] In 1974 the play Bullshot Crummond, by Ron House, was staged with Alan Shearman as Crummond.[92] The play was subsequently made into the 1983 film Bullshot.\n\nCaptain Hugh “Bullshot” Crummond (Alan Shearman) is a World War I fighter pilot, Olympic athlete, racing driver, and part-time sleuth. He must save the world from the dastardly Count Otto van Bruno (Ronald E. House), his wartime adversary, and win the heart of the damsel in distress (Diz White\n\nWARNING Irish BullWARNINGRawgabbitWARNINGBillyGoatWarning\n\n*When they tell you it isn’t real, remember, it’s still real.\n\nWhile the King Mountain and Drummond area looked promising for finding treasures, It was the backside of the mountain, so I did not think I would find any GOLD there.\n\nBig Hole River\n\nKudos for those that figured out the Haystacker(Beaverslide). Anyone want to know where it was invented?\n\nBIG HOLE RIVER\n\nAs a great improvement for preserving the wild hay for winter feeding of cattle, Herbert S. Armitage and Stephens filed for a “Hay-Stacker” patent in 1909, which was awarded in 1910. This device, commonly known as a “beaverslide” remained popular until the 1990s, when it was largely displaced by mechanized equipment for producing large round bales.[6][7][8]\n\nThe Big Hole River (Salish: Sk͏ʷumcné Sewɫk͏ʷs, “waters of the pocket gopher” [3]) is a tributary of the Jefferson River, approximately 153 miles (246 km) long, in Beaverhead County, in southwestern Montana, United States. It is the last habitat in the contiguous United States for native fluvial Arctic grayling[4] and is an historically p.opular destination for fly fishing, especially for trout. Ranches grew along the river from railroad supply points such as Divide, Montana.[5]\n\nThe beaverslide is now obsolete. It has been replaced by new, modern round balers. Long forgotten and abandoned along the highway. A pile of hay is also known as a hayrick. Could the Hastacker be the Blaze. Ever seen a pile of hay on fire?\n\nI have had this picture on my website for a long time. Would I really just be writing the story now??????????? For no real reason. Really?\n\nAt the time Lewis & Clark “discovered” the Big Hole River watershed, it was a buffer zone between several rival Native American tribes including the Nez Percé, Shoshone, Coast Salish, and Blackfeet. Lewis & Clark considered navigating up the Big Hole River, but chose the slower-flowing Beaverhead River instead. Trappers from both the Hudson’s Bay Company, the North West Company and the American Fur Company exploited the region from about 1810 to the 1840s. Miners and homesteaders settled the area between 1864 and the early 1900s\n\nThe source of the mainstem Big Hole River is Skinner Lake in the Beaverhead National Forest in the Beaverhead Mountains of the Bitterroot Range at the Continental Divide along the Montana-Idaho border in western Beaverhead County. However, Skinner Lake is in turn fed by Darkhorse Creek, which flows from Darkhorse and Cowbone Lakes, the former at 8,691 feet (2,649 m).[11] The Big Hole River flows northwest and north, past Wisdom and between the Anaconda Range to the northwest and the Pioneer Mountains to the east. It flows around the north end of the Pioneers where it forms the border between Beaverhead County and Deer Lodge County and then Silver Bow County, then southeast past the town of Wise River, Montana, where it is joined by the Wise River. Near Glen, Montana it turns northeast and joins the Beaverhead River near Twin Bridges to form the Jefferson. The Big Hole is the last habitat in the contiguous United States for native fluvial (river-dwelling) Arctic grayling\n\nOkay, I will help you a little.\n\nA, In there alone. The big Hole.\n\nB.

Doncaster Round Barn (I wish Eric Sloan would have painted the Doncaster Barn)\n\nFour Indian trails came together at a bend of the Beaverhead River north of the present school building in Twin Bridges. In 1865 they built a bridge across the Beaverhead River, and later built another bridge across the Beaverhead at the Point of Rocks.\n\nSpokane, a chestnut Thoroughbred stallion foaled in 1886.\n\nSpokane is the only horse foaled and trained in Montana to ever win the Kentucky Derby. He did it in 1889, the same year Montana was admitted to the Union. Ridden by Tennessee native Tom Kiley and sent off at 16.4:1 odds, Spokane defeated the heavily favored colt, Proctor Knott and set a new Kentucky Derby record for 1½ miles at 2:34.50.][3]\n\nThe barn in which Spokane was born, the Doncaster Round Barn, located about two miles north of Twin Bridges, Montana, has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.[4\n\nFOOLED AGAIN Elevation at Twin Bridges is 4626.\n\nI was totally lost in my google search. I did not know whether to go north toward Table Mountain and Mammoth Creek. East toward Old Baldy and Granite Peak over by Nugget Creek. South toward Adler, Virginia City and Eight Mile Creek. Or to go West towards Painted Rocks, Horse Creek and Bitterroot.\n\nI wished that I had a Navajo Guide to show me the way. I had identified 4 peaks, but did not know the way.\n\nOn to Montana and Finding My Way\n\n“Go West, young man, go West. There is health in the country, and room away from our crowds of idlers and imbeciles.” “That,” I said, “is very frank advice, but it is medicine easier given than taken. It is a wide country, but I do not know just where to go.” “………attributed to Horace Greeley or not.\n\n“Go West, young man” is a phrase often credited to the American author Horace Greeley concerning America’s expansion westward, related to the then-popular concept of Manifest Destiny Greeley favored westward expansion. He saw the fertile farmland of the west as an ideal place for people willing to work hard for the opportunity to succeed. The phrase came to symbolize the idea that agriculture could solve many of the nation’s problems of poverty and unemployment characteristic of the big cities of the East. It is one of the most commonly quoted sayings from the nineteenth century and may have had some influence on the course of American history\n\nMy best idea was right under Pinoccio’s nose, or rather it was my nose. From the time I was just a little sappling, I always loved the state of Montana. Just look at the Western Border. It looks like a face. As a child I always was able to recognize Montana by the shape of the western border. Here, the bitter root (found among the roots, Kursk Icon) Mountains separate Montana from Idaho. A multistate solution to finding the treasure has not been looked at since Forrest cleverly took many of the states out of play. WHY DID HE DO THAT?\n\nSomeone was close to finding the treasure and by taking Idaho out of the picture, he was misleading us and confining our thinking to just part of the map. Remember a good map is needed, not just one that has four States.\n\nIs it possible that parts of Montana are only accessible from roads that are on the west side of the divide? Could all of the clues be in Idaho and the last one be in Montana? Could some of the clues be in Montana, but the only way to get to the chest would be to go through Idaho?\n\nMy recent fascination with this area started in New Mexico when I took a picture of the OLD MAN”S Face in the Cimmaron State Park. I related it to the Poem Old Man in the Mirror. Once again, I was back where I started, looking in the Mirror. I sure did not want to drop it and have 7 years of bad luck. I began to find more and more information about that spot. Here are a few of my discoveries.\n\nRavalli County is a county located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Montana. As of the 2010 census, the population was 40,212.[1] Its county seat is Hamilton.[2]\n\nRavalli County is part of a north/south mountain valley bordered by the Sapphire Mountains on the East and the Bitterroot Mountains on the West. It is often referred to as the Bitterroot Valley, which is named for the Bitterroot Flower. The county is entirely on the Pacific Ocean side of the Continental Divide, which follows the Idaho-Montana border from Wyoming until Ravalli County. Here it turns east into Montana, between Chief Joseph Pass and Lost Trail Pass, and follows the Ravalli County-Beaverhead County border. Ravalli County was once home to the Bitterroot Salish tribe. The tribe was first encountered in 1805 by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which noted the friendly nature of the tribe.\n\nBitter root French trappers knew the plant as racème amer (bitter root).[6] Native American names included spetlum or spetlem, meaning “bitter”, nakamtcu (Ktanxa: naqam¢u),[7] and mo’ôtáa-heséeo’ôtse (Cheyenne, “black medicine”)[8]\n\nThe roots were consumed by tribes such as the Shoshone and the Flathead Indians as an infrequent delicacy. Traditionally, the Ktunaxa cooked bitterroot with grouse. [9] The Lemhi Shoshone believed the small red core found in the upper taproot had special powers, notably being able to stop a bear attack.[6]\n\nMeriwether Lewis ate bitterroot in 1805 and 1806 during the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The specimens he brought back were identified and given their scientific name, Lewisia rediviva.,\n\nRimini, [‘rɪm ə naj] Montana is a ghost town which is one of the oldest mining districts in the state. It was established when silver lodes were discovered in 1864. Other names for the town were Lewis and Clark, Tenmile, Vaughn, Colorado, and Bear Gulch.[2] It was the site of Camp Rimini, which trained dogs for use in WWII. It is on Tenmile Creek with Red Mountain on the east and Lee Mountain on the west.\n\nSula is located along U.S. Route 93 in southern Ravalli County. It lies along the East Fork of the Bitterroot River at the west end of Ross’ Hole, a wide valley surrounded by mountains. It is 35 miles (56 km) north along U.S. 93 to Hamilton, the county seat, and 58 miles (93 km) south over Lost Trail Pass to Salmon, Idaho.\n\nRoss’ Hole (Salish: K͏ʷtíɫ P̓upƛ̓m̓ (“big open or big clear area”), also Sk͏ʷtíɫ X̣súlex͏ʷ [1]) is a valley located in Ravalli County, in Sula State Forest, along U.S. Route 93 in the vicinity of the hamlet of Sula, Montana.\n\nIt was named after fur trader Alexander Ross, leader of a Hudson’s Bay Company trapping brigade, who camped there in 1824. According to the Encyclopedia of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, “Hole” was a term used by trappers for a broad, flat valley surrounded by mountains.[2]\n\nRepresenatative Photo, not original Painting\n\nIt is known as the subject of a famous painting, “Lewis and Clark Meeting the Flathead Indians at Ross’ Hole. ” The shape of the hill- and mountain-enclosed valley resembles a Christmas tree, with the base at the south, where the valley is about 4 miles wide. It extends northward about 8 miles, gradually tapering to a point. Except for the small community of Sula, a few ranch-houses, and highway U.S. 93, which skirts the southwestern corner of th"
