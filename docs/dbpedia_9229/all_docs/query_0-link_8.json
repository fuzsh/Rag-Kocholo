This opened up local industries such as coal, lumber, dairy, and hotel. Barges towed by mules transported goods along Rondout Creek from Pennsylvania to the Hudson River. In the canal era, Kerhonkson was known as Middleport [7]\n\nRailroad Era\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Delaware and Oswego Railroad was constructed in 1909 along the old canal towpath and a station was constructed along Main Street to ship out dairy products. The Summitville to Kingston segment was acquired by the New York, Ontario and Western. In the line's waning years, passenger service was reduced to Sunday and holiday service, and summer only.[8] The tracks were pulled up in 1957 once products were being moved by truck upstate. The path is now a popular local hiking and biking destination known as the Rail Trail. It is 3.5 miles long.\n\nPeg Leg Bates\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1951, the famed tap dancer Peg Leg Bates became the first African-American resort owner in the Catskills when he opened the Peg Leg Bates Country Club in Palentown, a hamlet in the northern end of the Kerhonkson Zip Code. His wife Alice E. Bates died in 1987, and Bates leased the property to a new owner, Doreen Richardson, in 1989.[9] Part of Route 209 in Ulster County was named “Clayton Peg Leg Bates Memorial Highway” in his honor.[10]\n\nRichardson operated the former Peg Leg Bates club as the \"Mountain Valley Resort\" until her death in 2012.[11]\n\nThe Peg Leg Bates resort played an important role in the history of the civil rights movement in 1966 when a meeting of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) held there voted to expel whites from its staff.\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nCongregation Tifereth Yehuda Veyisroel is the primary Jewish temple in the area. It was constructed in 1924. The community house also found on that property was constructed in 1954. In 2013 it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Federated Church of Kerhonkson is a Protestant church that is partially of the Methodist denomination and partially of the Reformed denomination. The church has a food pantry (\"Christ's Cupboard\"), a thrift shop, and a pet food pantry.\n\nHoly Trinity Ukrainian Catholic Church is located on Foordmore Road.[12] The parish is part of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Stamford.\n\nThe Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes on Route 209 in Kerhonkson is a Catholic mission associated with the parish of St. Mary and St. Andrew in Ellenville.[13]\n\nLocal sports\n\n[edit]\n\nKerhonkson has hosted a baseball Little League, Indian Valley Little League, since 1953. Indian Valley won the 2017 District 16 championship, defeating Rondout Valley Little League. More recently Indian Valley removed its longtime mascot, Chief Wahoo, from signs, shirts, hats, website, and Facebook for its racial insensitivity.[14]\n\nThe local swim team, the Kerhonkson Barracudas, are based out of the Kerhonkson Elementary School pool and compete against other local teams in the summer.\n\nLocal services\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Kerhonkson Fire Department is on Main Street near where the railroad used to be. It has a social hall that holds meetings of local organizations, dinners, and parties.\n\nThe Kerhonkson-Accord Volunteer Ambulance Corp is along Route 209 and provides first aid service for both Kerhonkson and Accord.\n\nNotable inhabitants\n\n[edit]\n\nEdward Aldwell - music theorist, pianist, and pedagogue\n\nPeg Leg Bates - entertainer\n\nNoel King - broadcast journalist, formerly with NPR's Morning Edition\n\nHerb Trimpe - Marvel comics artist, author\n\nWorld records\n\n[edit]\n\nKerhonkson contains what was once the world's largest garden gnome, constructed in 2005; it is situated on Route 209 in front of Kelder's Farm and is named Gnome Chomsky.[15] There are two other, larger gnomes that now hold the distinction of being the world's largest.[16]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nHudson Valley portal\n\nNew York (state) portal"
