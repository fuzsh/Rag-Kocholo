        "text": "The Purpose\n\n\"Satellite Finder Online (PHP)\" (hereafter SFO) is a Web-based version of my popular Java application \"Satellite Finder\". This service provides coordinates to help you locate geostationary satellites, primarily for those installing and pointing satellite dishes. If you are a professional dish installer and you expect to be in the field at the time you need pointing information, you may want to download \"Satellite Finder\" as well (both services are free).\n\nTo use SFO, just select a state and a town, or type in a ZIP code, and this program will generate a list of coordinates for most geostationary satellites. You may also type in any geographical position if the ZIP code database doesn't cover your location.\n\nThere is more complete documentation below the application.\n\nThe Details\n\nSFO solves a problem becoming more important as we become more reliant on satellite communications. Basically, there is now a ring of very expensive jewels circling the earth in a special orbit. Science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke first had the idea that a particular altitude would cause a satellite to appear motionless to the revolving earth below. That orbital height, about 22,300 miles, perfectly balances a satellite's orbital velocity with the earth's rotational velocity. This means we can install satellite dishes that point to particular locations in the sky, and the satellites won't drift out of view.\n\nBecause all the satellites lie directly over the equator, and because they are all at the same altitude, the mathematics required to produce viewing angles is relatively simple. In fact, the challenges in the design of this page (and of the similar Java application Satellite Finder) lay more in the area of managing a huge database of ZIP codes and associated positions that is presently over 40,000 records in size.\n\nSFO will remember a ZIP code you enter, and when you return to this page (assuming you have cookies enabled), it will recompute your last ZIP code entry. But if you want to tell SFO which ZIP code to compute without actually entering it, just produce an URL (Uniform Resource Locator, a fancy term for a Web address) that looks like this:\n\nhttp://www.arachnoid.com/satfinderonline/index.php?zipcode=98339\n\nSome users will need to enter position coordinates directly, without using the ZIP code database. One can type in coordinates by hand, but again, if you want to compute a particular position without having to manually enter the values, create an URL like this:\n\nhttp://www.arachnoid.com/satfinderonline/index.php?lat=42&lng=-120\n\nUsing this system, one could create a personal list of URLs containing frequently-used ZIP codes or positions, and click the one needed for a specific purpose without having to hand-enter the values.\n\nRemember these rules:\n\nThe SFO database doesn't contain all ZIP codes, only (more or less) those for cities with more than 15,000 people. To compute viewing angles for a location without a listed ZIP code, either:\n\nChoose a nearby city or type in a specific ZIP code (there are many more ZIP codes than there are city names), or\n\nType in a geographical position.\n\nIf you elect to enter a geographical position, remember the entries can be expressed in decimal degrees, or degrees and decimal minutes, as shown in these example entries for 40° 12.5' north:\n\n40 degrees, 12.5 minutes\n\n40.20833 degrees, 0 minutes\n\nRemember if you choose to make a single decimal degree entry as in the second example above, be sure the minute value is set to zero.\n\nPosition entries that are part of an URL (as in the earlier example) can only be in decimal degrees.\n\nWhen creating a position URL, North latitudes and East longitudes are positive, South latitudes and West longitudes are negative. This doesn't apply to entries into the page itself, where the provided N/S and E/W radio checkboxes create the hemispherical information.\n\nTurning now to the data table, the columns are:\n\n\"Sat Name\": The common name of a particular satellite.\n\n\"Sat Lng\": The geographical longitude of the satellite, its position along the geostationary orbit in Earth-centered coordinates. Specifically, a satellite with a listed orbital longitude of -120° would lie directly above Earth's equator at a terrestrial longitude of 120° West.\n\n\"Az(t)\": The true-North azimuthal angle for the satellite at the chosen site. The Azimuth represents a horizontal circle measured in degrees:\n\n0° = North\n\n90° = East\n\n180° = South\n\n270° = West\n\n\"Az(m)\": As above, but for a magnetic North reference rather than True. This number is more useful for a typical field installation where the simplest way to measure azimuth is with a magnetic compass.\n\n\"El\": An elevation angle in degrees, with 0° = horizontal and 90° = vertical. Some satellites will be listed with negative elevation numbers — these represent positions below the local horizon.\n\n\"Skew\": This specialized value is only useful for dishes that pick up more than one satellite. These dishes must be rotated along their aiming axis (skewed) to accommodate the relationship between local horizontal and the relative tilt of the geostationary orbit at the chosen location. By convention, a zero skew angle means the dish is level with the horizon, while negative values mean the dish is rotated counterclockwise as viewed from the rear.\n\nSFO computes magnetic declination using a special method that is quite accurate, more accurate than needed for satellite dish pointing. Remember when using a magnetic compass in the field that virtually all present dishes are fully or partly ferrous and will spoil the compass reading unless the compass is well removed from the dish itself.\n\nThe satellite list includes a special pseudo-satellite marked \"Dish 500 calibration\". This entry produces a pointing angle for the common DishNetwork \"Dish 500\" product, the perpendicular of which should be aimed directly between the 110° and 119° satellites (I have no special relationship with DishNetwork).\n\nIf there are other similar dishes that require special pointing angles, or if there are satellites in common television service that are not in the list above, I would appreciate hearing from interested readers with this kind of information — post to my message page.\n\nFor readers who need a customized satellite list, I recommend Satellite Finder, my free Java version of this program. It has a plain-text satellite list that is easy to edit for special purposes.\n\nBe sure to visit the Google Play Store and pick up my free, advanced Android satellite finder app — it uses the device's camera to project an image of satellite positions against the sky."
