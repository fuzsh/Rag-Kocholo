        "text": "The Finger Lakes Story Sparkling lakes, breathtaking waterfalls and rolling pastoral land dominate the landscape of the Finger Lakes Region. Over thousands of years, gigantic glaciers and coursing streams have carved this landscape. The most recent glacier moved through shallow river valleys leaving in its place deep, steep-sided troughs. When the glaciers receded north 10,000 years ago, water filled these new troughs, creating the 11 Finger Lakes. Since that time water has flowed down glacially steepened hillsides carrying debris that cut away at soft sedimentary rock to form our beautiful and unique gorges.\n\nGorge Tours provide information and insights about individual park history, ecology, gorge formation and geology. Tours last approximately one and one half hours.\n\nThe Buttermilk Falls Gorge Tour - You'll ascend approximately 600 feet on the gorge trail from its beginning at Buttermilk Falls by the time it ends just past the 42ft \"Pinnacle Rock\". The gorge trail follows Buttermilk Creek through its cool, moist, gorge past deep pools, sculpted rocks and several waterfalls. There are many beautiful stone steps on this trail making it a difficult hike for some visitors.\n\nEducational Programs are offered about a variety of topics.\n\nBirds ● Fossils ● Reptiles and Amphibians ● Insects ● Invasive Species ● Mammals ● Trees● Park Histories ● Animal Tracks ● Wilderness Survival\n\nIf don't see a specific topic please call or email us with your questions."
