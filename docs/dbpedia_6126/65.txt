Top 5 Hairspary filming location in Toronto

A bit of Hairspray history for those of you who are new. Hairspray (2007) is a musical comedy that follows 1960’s Baltimore teen, Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), as she goes after her dream: dancing on the Corny Collins Show. The Broadway musical, Hairspray (musical), was inspired by the movie Hairspray (1988). The original movie, Hairspray (1988), wasn’t actually a musical at all. Hairspray (1988) was adapted for Broadway, and then re-adpated from Broadway back to the big screen as the musical: Hairspray (2007)!

In the early 2000’s, movie musicals were having a resurgence! With the gained Oscar prestige and box office profits Chicago (2002) made, Hollywood was determined to cash in on the musical genre. There were dozens of Broadway shows being ripped straight from the stage, and plasters all over our screens! Including: The Phantom of the Opera (2004), The Producers (2005), Dreamgirls (2006), Hairspray (2007), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), and Mamma Mia! (2008). Not to mention the musical that launched a thousand haircuts High School Musical (2006).

In summary, if you (like myself) were a theatre kid, this was the PINNACLE of your childhood. And Hairspray (2007) fell right in the middle of it.

It might come as a surprise to you, but Baltimore is not in Canada. So then why was Hairspray filmed in Toronto? Money, baby! It’s a lot cheaper to film movies in Canadian city centers, then it is to film in America. Toronto specifically is a super malleable city and Hollywood has noticed. This is why even a big musical number called ‘Good Morning, Baltimore!’, depicts characters running through the streets of Toronto.

And of course, we found those streets!
