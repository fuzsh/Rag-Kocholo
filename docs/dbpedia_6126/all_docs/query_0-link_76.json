        "meta_description": "Book Vs. Movie: Hairspray\nThe 1988 John Waters Movie Vs. the 2007 Adaptation\n“Musicals in March”\n\nThe Margos continue their look at “Musicals in March” with the https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000691/ classic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairspray_(2007_film), which started with the 1988 movie starring https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001442/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_(performer), and https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001323/. Based on his experiences of being a fan of the 1957-1964 Baltimore teen dance TV program--https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0294018/, Waters was a huge fan of R&amp;B music. On the Buddy Deane show, the dancers were integrated, unlike https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049993/which was based out of Philadelphia at the same time. \n\nhttps://www.baltimoremagazine.com/section/artsentertainment/john-waters-on-keeping-the-memory-of-the-buddy-deane-show-alive/”\n\nBeing a self-described “Super Fan” of the show, the director has a well-known career as an avant-garde-loving and bizarre artist who loves things that are in bad taste. His interest in something as wholesome as Buddy Deane made him think about writing a more accessible film about a group of teen dancers/local TV stars who fight racism and oppression with their love of music and dance. \n\nGiven a modest budget of $2.8 million, the film was a box office hit, and the critics loved this new era of John Waters with even bigger hits in the 90s https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099329/ &amp; https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111127/. Waters continues to write and direct his work and is very popular as an actor who appears in everything from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvelous_Mrs._Maisel. \n\nIn 2002, the musical version premiered in Seattle with music and lyrics from https://www.marcshaiman.com/ and https://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Scott-Wittman/ and the book by https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/theater/mark-odonnell-hairspray-writer-dies-at-58.html and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Meehan_(writer). Hit is not a big enough word for this adaptation's success in the 2000s. It won eight Tony Awards (including Best Musical) in 2003 and broke all box office records in London’s West End in 2008. \n\nThe 2007 movie was directed by https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788202/ and stars https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Travolta, https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000201/, and https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000686/ and continues the big box office that started with the original 1988 film. \n\nWhat are the differences between the original and the latest version of the story of the AMAZING https://hairspray.fandom.com/wiki/Tracy_Turnblad?
