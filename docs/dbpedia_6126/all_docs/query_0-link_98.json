Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.\n\n★‘ACROSS THE UNIVERSE’ (PG-13, 131 minutes) Julie Taymor’s gorgeous musical fantasia uses 33 Beatles songs, along with a fantastic array of masks, puppets and special effects to evoke the 1960s. Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess are archetypal lovers, swept up by the counterculture, who ride the rough seas of radical politics and psychedelia.\n\n(Stephen Holden)\n\n‘THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD’ (R, 150 minutes) With his second feature, the gifted director Andrew Dominik (“Chopper”) adds another gauzy chapter to the overtaxed Jesse James myth, if not much rhyme or reason, heart or soul. Brad Pitt plays the celebrity thief, but it’s Casey Affleck, as his killer, who steals the show. (Manohla Dargis)\n\n★ ‘BANISHED’ (No rating, 87 minutes) There are ghosts haunting this quietly sorrowful documentary about the forced expulsion of black Southerners from their homes in the troubled, violent decades after the Civil War. The director, Marco Williams, doesn’t dig as hard as he should, but he has found a powerful subject. (Dargis)\n\n★ ‘THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM’ (PG-13, 111 minutes) Paul Greengrass directs, Matt Damon runs, in the fastest, smartest American action flick since ...[set ellipses] “The Bourne Supremacy.” (Dargis)\n\n‘THE BRAVE ONE’ Jodie Foster, playing a public-radio host turned vigilante gunslinger, prowls Manhattan in search of bad guys in this slick, dishonest attempt at a high-toned revenge picture. Directed, sorry to say, by Neil Jordan. (A. O. Scott)\n\n‘THE DARJEELING LIMITED’ (R, 97 minutes) Wes Anderson’s latest — in which three brothers (Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson) cross India by rail — is nothing if not precious. Which is to say that it’s vain and fussy and also that, by virtue of its visual beauty and its affectionate spirit, it’s a treasure. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘EASTERN PROMISES’ The humanism of Steve Knight’s script clashes in interesting ways with the ruthless formal rigor of the director, David Cronenberg, in this clammy, unsettling underworld tale. Viggo Mortensen is magnetic and enigmatic as a Russian mobster who shows some signs of conscience. (Scott)\n\n‘FEAST OF LOVE’ (R, 102 minutes) This hollow contrivance masquerades as a wise and witty contemporary gloss on “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” (Holden)\n\n‘GAME PLAN’ (PG, 110 minutes) A quarterback named Joe Kingman, played by Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson, learns to love the young daughter, Peyton (Madison Pettis), he never knew he had. The story is familiar and rather plainly aimed at children. But the movie is so likable that it glides over its many plot holes (including the fishy explanation of why Joe never knew about Peyton, and an 11th-hour revelation by the girl that’s even less persuasive). The film’s direction, by Andy Fickman, is raucous but never crass, and the affable Mr. Johnson is committed to every moment. (Matt Zoller Seitz)\n\n★ HAIRSPRAY (PG, 107 minutes) It’s no surprise that this musical — adapted from the Broadway show that was adapted from the John Waters movie — is good-hearted. It’s about fighting prejudice by singing and dancing. The surprise is that it’s actually good, including the singing and dancing. (Scott)\n\n★‘HELVETICA’ (No rating, 80 minutes) Overlong but fascinating, Gary Hustwit’s documentary posits Helvetica — a sans-serif typeface developed in 1957 at the Haas Foundry in Munchenstein, Switzerland — as an emblem of the machine age, a harbinger of globalization and an ally of modern art’s impulse toward innovation, simplicity and abstraction. In interviews graphic designers and theorists praise Helvetica as a conceptual breakthrough or blast it as a lowest-common-denominator typeface whose use both reflects and perpetuates conformity. (Seitz)\n\n‘IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH’ The latest film from Paul Haggis (“Crash”) hides an anguished heart under its somber procedural surface. A retired military police officer (Tommy Lee Jones) investigates the death of his son with the help of a New Mexico detective (Charlize Theron). The film is clumsy in places, but it has a quiet, gnawing power, and Mr. Jones’s performance is a tour de force. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘INTO THE WILD’ (R, 140 minutes) In his adaptation of Jon Krakauer’s best seller, Sean Penn explores the life and death of Christopher McCandless, a young wanderer who perished in the Alaskan wilderness in 1992. The story is sad, but there is something almost exuberant in Mr. Penn’s embrace of it — and in Emile Hirsch’s brilliant performance as McCandless. Rarely has the radical, romantic American attachment to the wilderness been explored with such sympathy and passion. (Scott)\n\n‘THE JANE AUSTEN BOOK CLUB’ (PG-13, 105 minutes) You can question the movie’s conceit that the novels of Jane Austen are an ideal guidebook to personal fulfillment for the modern American woman, but it is such a well-acted, literate adaptation of Karen Joy Fowler’s 2004 bestseller that your impulse is to forgive it for being the formulaic, feel-good chick flick that it is. (Holden)\n\n‘KING OF CALIFORNIA’ (PG-13, 93 minutes) In his strongest screen performance since “Wonder Boys,” Michael Douglas plays a charming maniac recently discharged from a mental institution who leads his teenage daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) on a search for buried treasure in Southern California. (Holden)\n\n‘THE KINGDOM’ (R, 111 minutes) Peter Berg’s war-on-terror revenge-fantasy action thriller, in which a team of F.B.I. investigators go to Saudi Arabia to dig for clues and extract some payback, is not especially smart or subtle. But as a fusion of escapist wish-fulfillment with topical concern, it’s not bad, either. (Scott)\n\n* ‘THE LAST WINTER’ (No rating, 100 minutes) Something wicked this way comes in this shivery, smart, eco-minded horror film set in the blinding white beauty of the Alaskan wilderness. The director, Larry Fessenden, an heir to the Val Lewton school of elegantly restrained dread, thinks green but doesn’t spare the red. (Dargis)\n\n‘LUST, CAUTION’ (NC-17, 158 minutes, in Mandarin) A sleepy, musty period drama about wartime maneuvers and bedroom calisthenics that makes poor use of the otherwise solid director Ang Lee and the great Hong Kong actor Tony Leung Chiu-Wai. The movie’s explicit sex scenes earned it an NC-17, but put me in mind of high school geometry rather than the Kama Sutra. (Dargis) ‘THE RAPE OF EUROPA’ (No rating, 117 minutes) Though it crams in a lot and can seem cursory, this documentary, about the Nazi pillaging of art and the Allied efforts to return it, covers endlessly interesting material and asks endlessly interesting questions: Should soldiers’ lives be risked to save historic sites and artwork? Can a culture survive if its art is wiped out? (Rachel Saltz)\n\n★ ‘ROMANCE AND CIGARETTES’ (R, 115 minutes) There is more raw vitality pumping through John Turturro’s song-and-dance ode to the sensual pulse of life in a Queens neighborhood than in a dozen perky high school musicals. This is a movie in which a dirty mind is a good thing. Call it “The Singing Id.” (Holden)\n\n‘3:10 TO YUMA’ (R, 117 minutes) Christian Bale and Russell Crowe saddle up for this brutal, earnest remake of a classic 1957 western. Cleanly directed by James Mangold, the picture is not great, but it is unpretentious and satisfying, thanks mainly to the two lead performances and to Peter Fonda’s grizzled turn as a Pinkerton detective. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘TOOTS’ (No rating, 84 minutes) With this first-rate portrait, the documentarian Kristi Jacobson keeps alive the memory of her grandfather Toots Shor, restaurant owner and saloonkeeper extraordinaire, who played host and drinking buddy to many celebrities during New York night life’s golden era. (Laura Kern)\n\n‘TRADE’ (R, 119 minutes) A prurient dip into the sex trafficking trough, this improbable movie follows the abduction of a young Mexican girl and the rescue efforts of her brother (Cesar Ramos) and an uptight Texas cop (Kevin Kline). Teetering between earnest exposé and salacious melodrama, “Trade” fails either to educate or tease. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\n\n★ ‘2 DAYS IN PARIS’ (R, 96 minutes, in English and French) As Julie Delpy’s romantic comedy pores over the troubled two-year relationship of a young couple visiting Paris, more specific information is revealed about their habits, tastes, personality traits and emotional and sexual chemistry than in almost any other film about a relationship. Playing the lovers, Ms. Delpy and Adam Goldberg suggest Woody Allen and Diane Keaton without shtick. (Holden)\n\nFilm Series\n\nARNAUD DESPLECHIN IN FOCUS (Tomorrow and Sunday) One of the most accomplished French filmmakers to emerge in the last 20 years, Arnaud Desplechin combines a novelist’s feel for character and detailed plotting with a filmmaker’s eye for complex, enigmatic images. He will be honored over the next two weekends with a retrospective, sponsored by the Cultural Services of the French Embassy and Les Cahiers du Cinéma, which matches films by Mr. Desplechin with the movies that originally inspired them. Tomorrow brings together “Esther Kahn” (2000), the story of an actress (Summer Phoenix) on the 19th-century London stage, with Ingmar Bergman’s romantic tragedy “Summer Interlude” (1950); on Sunday Mr. Desplechin’s gimlet-eyed examination of the world of academia, “My Sex Life ... or How I Got into an Argument” (1996) meets François Truffaut’s lyrical exploration of a love triangle, “Two English Girls” (1971). Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Dave Kehr)\n\nEVIL CITY FILM FEST 2007 (Today through Monday) In this program, now in its third year, the East Village is home to a wide-ranging selection of independent features and shorts. The festival promises to cater “as much to the counterculture as it does to any film lover.” This weekend’s presentations include “The Closet” by Luis Cortina (tonight), the story of an Argentine couple who share their Bronx apartment with a mysterious creature; a revival of Susan Seidelman’s definitive portrait of the East Village in the 1980s, “Smithereens” (tomorrow); and Karen Gehres’s “Begging Naked,” a documentary about the artist Elise Hill (Sunday). Screenings will be held at the Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, and the Millennium Theater, 66 East Fourth Street; (212) 982-9274, evilcityfilmfest.com; $9. (Kehr)\n\nVIEWS FROM THE AVANT-GARDE (Tomorrow and Sunday) Now in its 11th year, this independently organized sidebar to the New York Film Festival features recent work by both heavy-hitters (Ernie Gehr, Ken Jacobs, Peggy Ahwesh) and newcomers in the avant-garde arena. The programmers, Mark McElhatten and Gavin Smith, have managed to cram 11 different programs into two days, with sessions centered both on individual filmmakers (Helga Fanderl, Peter Hutton, Robert Beavers) and thematic surveys (“From the Canyons to the Stars,” “Stranger Than a Strange Land,” “Bits and Pieces”). Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr)"
