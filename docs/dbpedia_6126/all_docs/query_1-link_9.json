        "text": "One of my favourite musicals, an enjoyable song-full film! Great people, great songs, great performances, great dancers – what more is there to ask for? Great storyline? Yes. Original musical standing out from others? Definitely. Bit of comedy? That too! Even some romance! Again, I ask what more do you need. This is definitely one of the best musicals out there. Up with the likes of ‘Mamma Mia!’, ‘Grease’, ‘Chitty Chitty Bang Bang’, ‘Chicago’.\n\nTo begin with, the numerous recognisable actors and actresses has to be mentioned! First of all, John Travolta, although in a very different costume from his numerous other characters, but still amazing as ever. To say the least, there’s no Danny Zuko in this film. Then there’s Queen Latifah, Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken! Not forgetting, James Marsden (‘X-Men’, ‘27 Dresses’), Amanda Bynes (‘She’s the Man’, ‘The Duff’) and Brittany Snow (‘John Tucker Must Die’, ‘Pitch Perfect’). And of course High School Musical’s Zac Efron! Then introducing the perfectly selected Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad and Elijah Kelley as Seaweed. All actors play their parts brilliantly, all perfectly selected for their roles. Also helps that they all can sing and dance great as well!\n\nAs it is a musical, there are of course numerous songs within the film. Like I’ve already said, all of the songs are great. I don’t think there is a song that I don’t like in this musical, they all are enjoyable, especially the ones where they really put a show on with the performances and dancing. It’s definitely not a disappointment in that aspect, in any aspect, but happily this musical stands out as a musical. Oh and I cannot forget to mention the power Nikki Blonsky puts into her songs, the deep attitude definitely is noticed and appreciated amongst the songs.\n\nSo I guess I should quickly go over the plot if you’ve never seen the film. Set in 1962 Baltimore, revolving around Corny Collins television show are apparently “the nicest kids in town”, when Tracy makes her dream to get on the show, she struggles as Velma Von Tussle and her daughter Amber ridicule at her weight. Nevertheless, she is persistent in participating in the Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant. As it’s set in America’s 1960s, segregation between black and white people is throughout the film, the film is a celebration of integration and the struggle of bringing it to, but eventually seeing all as equal as it should have always been.\n\nSo as you can probably guess, I love this film! It’s a great feel-good film, a film to get you singing and dancing along. To say the least, I know all the songs, I guess that makes it more enjoyable. But if you’ve never seen the film and like musicals, because I appreciate they are of certain taste, then I encourage for you to watch this one! You won’t regret it. There’s comedy, there’s romance, there’s quick-pace moments and there’s moving moments. Everyone is great and played perfectly, it’s a really great film to escape into for an hour or so.\n\nAnyway, “you can’t stop the beat!”"
