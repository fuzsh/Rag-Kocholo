        "text": "LOS ANGELES — We had only just met, but John Travolta, big and handsome and hypnotic, was fondling the lapel of my navy blue blazer. \"Ooh, what a great idea to match this with a cobalt blue shirt,\" he cooed. \"I wouldn't have thought of that.\"\n\nDisarming, but doubtful. When it comes to appearances, Travolta seems to think of everything. Chatting on Father's Day in his Spanish-style home in the Brentwood hills of Los Angeles, he was a carefully considered composition in black — blazer, shirt, pants — and crocodile slip-ons. His hair was precisely deployed in a center part flip, which made his bangs look like quotation marks framing his face.\n\nBecause we were discussing his role as the obese, fashion-challenged laundress Edna Turnblad in the $75 million movie version of the musical \"Hairspray,\" which opens nationwide on Friday, the subject naturally kept returning to clothing, coiffure and body type. Before filming he had costumers, special makeup-effects people, even prop masters repeatedly revising their work to achieve the look he imagined in housedresses, fat suits and irons. He did not want to resemble a refrigerator or Jabba the Hutt, he said, but Sophia Loren with a couple of hundred extra pounds. And he got his wish: His Edna, unlike the greasy Gorgon created by Divine in the 1988 John Waters original or the Kabuki hausfrau rendered so memorably by Harvey Fierstein in the 2002 Broadway musical adaptation, has cleavage and a waist and a kind of geologic sex appeal.\n\nSo you'd think he must have known, and not cared, that complimenting a writer's color coordination might seem not just friendly but also really gay. Which would be nothing but a charming detail were it not for the controversy that had recently arisen about his taking the role of Edna in the first place. In a blog entry posted in May on the Web site of The Washington Blade (washblade.com), a gay newspaper, Kevin Naff, its editor, called for a boycott of \"Hairspray\" because of Travolta's membership in the Church of Scientology, which he described as a cult that \"rejects gays and lesbians as members and even operates reparative therapy clinics to 'cure' homosexuality.\" In a subsequent editorial Naff added that Travolta's appearance in the \"iconic gay role\" is \"even more galling given all the gay rumors that have followed him for years.\"\n\nSeated in a leather club chair in his paneled library, where books on cigars and aviation share space with Scientology treatises and a \"photographic tribute\" to the church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, Travolta was not at all defensive about any of this. Asked about Naff's comments, he did not protest with allusions to his wife of 15 years, the actress Kelly Preston, or their two children. He merely said that he was completely comfortable around gay people, that Edna wasn't gay anyway, and that the claims about Scientology were inaccurate. \"Scientology is one of the least homophobic religions,\" he said. \"It's not very interested in the body at all.\"\n\nPerhaps, but Travolta certainly is. He became a movie star on the basis of a physicality so intense — and so specific to each role — that it almost seemed choreographed. Even beyond the dance moves of \"Grease\" and \"Saturday Night Fever\" and \"Urban Cowboy,\" defining as they were, his ability to create character in the shape of his spine, the tilt of his pelvis, the isolation of various parts of his body was a revelation in films, whether musical or not. The famous slouching Watusi he devised for woozy Vincent Vega in \"Pulp Fiction\" not only nailed that character but revived a career that by 1994 had fallen into one of its weird, periodic lulls.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
