She began her career at age three as a Ford model, and also made appearances in over sixty television commercials, including spots for The Gap, Pizza Hut, Wendy's, and Jell-O (opposite Bill Cosby). Lohan made her acting debut in 1996 as the third actress to play Ali Fowler in the television drama Another World (1964). Shortly afterward she was hand-picked by Oscar-nominated writer Nancy Meyers as estranged twin sisters in an adaptation by Walt Disney Pictures of a novel by Erich Kästner, which marked Meyers' directorial debut. Lohan's first feature film, Ein Zwilling kommt selten allein (1998), a remake of Die Vermählung ihrer Eltern geben bekannt (1961), was a modest commercial success, earning her widespread critical acclaim and a Young Artist award for Best Leading Young Actress in a Feature Film, as well as Blockbuster Entertainment and YoungStar award nominations.\n\nAfter signing a three-movie contract with Disney, she returned to the small screen to star in the made-for-TV movies Zum Leben erweckt (2000) (opposite Tyra Banks) and Lass dir was einfallen! (2002) (opposite Bug Hall). She also appeared as Rose in the pilot episode of the short-lived comedy series Bette (2000), which starred Bette Midler.\n\nIn June 2001 Lohan took a brief hiatus from acting. Her music career was launched over a year later, when Estefan Enterprises made a five-album production deal with her in September 2002, and she signed a recording contract with the reactivated Casablanca Records.\n\nHowever, Lohan was not turning her back on her blossoming acting career. Just over a month previously she had been cast opposite Jamie Lee Curtis for another Disney adaptation of a novel, this time a fantasy comedy by Mary Rodgers. Freaky Friday - Ein voll verrückter Freitag (2003), a remake of Ein ganz verrückter Freitag (1976), was a huge hit (generating over $160 million in worldwide box office receipts) and critics were spellbound by delightful performances from Lohan and Curtis (who went on to receive a Golden Globe nomination for her work). In addition, Lohan won the 2004 MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Female, as well as a Saturn award nomination and another Young Artist award nomination.\n\nLohan relocated permanently to Los Angeles between projects and moved into an apartment with fellow actress Raven-Symoné. She also dated pop star Aaron Carter for a short time.\n\nHer next acting role was the title character in the comedy Bekenntnisse einer Highschool-Diva (2004), a Disney adaptation of the novel by Dyan Sheldon. The film received scathing reviews upon its release and died a quick death at the box office, but even the harshest of critics were impressed by Lohan's charming turn as aspiring actress Lola.\n\nLohan's next project, Girls Club - Vorsicht bissig! (2004), saw her reunite with Freaky Friday - Ein voll verrückter Freitag (2003) director Mark Waters. Inspired by a non-fiction book by Rosalind Wiseman and written by Saturday Night Live (1975) scribe Tina Fey, the high-school comedy-drama opened to glowing reviews and grossed $86 million in the US. This earned her status as a bankable actress, and a salary of $7.5 million for the Donald Petrie romantic comedy Zum Glück geküsst (2006).\n\nOne of the most sought-after young actresses in the industry, she starred in Bobby (2006) (opposite Demi Moore and Sharon Stone), the Disney fantasy adventure Herbie Fully Loaded - Ein toller Käfer startet durch (2005) (a pseudo-sequel to Ein toller Käfer (1969)) and the critically acclaimed Robert Altman's Last Radio Show (2006). On top of a thriving film career Lohan also launched a music career, releasing her debut album, \"Speak,\" which hit shelves in December 2004.\n\nIn 2009 Lohan launched her own fashion line titled 6126, mainly focusing on the production of women's leggings. By spring she launched a self-tanning spray line titled \"Sevin Nyne\" and by the end of the year she became an artistic designer for fashion house Ungaro.\n\nLindsay continues her career in acting, having played a supporting role in the action film Machete (2010).\n\nConsidered by many critics to be the greatest living actress, Meryl Streep has been nominated for the Academy Award an astonishing 21 times, and has won it three times. Meryl was born Mary Louise Streep in 1949 in Summit, New Jersey, to Mary Wolf (Wilkinson), a commercial artist, and Harry William Streep, Jr., a pharmaceutical executive. Her father was of German and Swiss-German descent, and her mother had English, Irish, and German ancestry.\n\nMeryl's early performing ambitions leaned toward the opera. She became interested in acting while a student at Vassar and upon graduation she enrolled in the Yale School of Drama. She gave an outstanding performance in her first film role, Julia (1977), and the next year she was nominated for her first Oscar for her role in Die durch die Hölle gehen (1978). She went on to win the Academy Award for her performances in Kramer gegen Kramer (1979) and Sophies Entscheidung (1982), in which she gave a heart-wrenching portrayal of an inmate mother in a Nazi death camp.\n\nA perfectionist in her craft and meticulous and painstaking in her preparation for her roles, Meryl turned out a string of highly acclaimed performances over the next decade in great films like Silkwood (1983); Jenseits von Afrika (1985); Wolfsmilch (1987); and Ein Schrei in der Dunkelheit (1988). Her career declined slightly in the early 1990s as a result of her inability to find suitable parts, but she shot back to the top in 1995 with her performance as Clint Eastwood's married lover in Die Brücken am Fluss (1995) and as the prodigal daughter in Marvins Töchter (1996). In 1998 she made her first venture into the area of producing, and was the executive producer for the moving Solange es noch Hoffnung gibt (1997). A realist when she talks about her future years in film, she remarked that \"...no matter what happens, my work will stand...\""
