        "text": "Quagmire's Mom\n\nLois takes Peter to open a checking account, and they discover that his first name is actually Justin, which Peter adopts as the name of his younger âbroâ-style alter-ego. Then, Peter/Justin throws a party, during which Quagmire unknowingly gets into some trouble with his mother.\n\nEncyclopedia Griffin\n\nPeter, Quagmire, Joe and Cleveland form a neighborhood detective agency, and are stunned to discover that Chris is a thief. Meanwhile, Lois is worried about Chrisâ delusional relationship with his new girlfriend, but also sees it as an opportunity for Peter to copy Chrisâ romantic gestures.\n\nDial Meg for Murder\n\nBrian gets a gig writing for a teen magazine about the average American girl, but when he starts trailing Meg for research he discovers that her desperate attempts at dating have led her to a guy in the slammer. When Brian tries to expose Megâs secret to the family, he finds that her boyfriend, Luke (guest voice Chace Crawford), has broken out of jail and has been hiding in the Griffinâs house."
