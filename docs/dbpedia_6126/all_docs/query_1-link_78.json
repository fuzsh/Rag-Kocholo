        "text": "\"Hairspray\" may be the latest film to get transformed into a movie musical, but it certainly wasn't the first. In fact, Hollywood has been turning dramatic or comedic films into movie musicals for decades.\n\nThe results have been mixed, however, with the musical versions seldom surpassing the \"straight\" originals. Of course, some notable exceptions exist, and in some instances both films merit bravos, such as the aforementioned \"Hairspray,\" a musical retooling of John Waters' 1988 film starring Ricki Lake.\n\n\"The Producers,\" Mel Brooks' 2005 musical version of his 1968 comedy, has its moments and features some excellent numbers, but the film musical lacks the panache of the original. Let's just say Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, the musical's stars, don't quite measure up to Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, the original's stars. There's also some redundancy to the musical: the original already contained the signature tune \"Springtime for Hitler.\"\n\nThe same star wattage shortage afflicts \"High Society,\" a 1956 musical remake of 1940's \"The Philadelphia Story.\" That said, any film starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Celeste Holm and Louis Armstrong isn't just whistling Dixie. But not giving the edge to the more formidable lineup of Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart borders on insanity.\n\nA stickier issue is that musicals, by their very nature, usually lack the acerbic or dramatic bite of \"straight\" originals. Again, there are exceptions.\n\nA prime example would be 1972's \"Cabaret,\" a musical remake of the 1955 British film \"I Am a Camera\" starring Julie Harris, Laurence Harvey and Shelley Winters. Musicals typically lose their dramatic impact because people just don't break out into song in the real world. \"Cabaret\" avoids this pitfall by placing almost all of its songs in a musical setting - the cabaret. A notable exception, \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me,\" retains its sting since it's a Nazi propaganda song whose onerous meaning becomes clear when the swastika on the young singer is revealed.\n\nThe Irish musical \"Once,\" one of this year's finer films, pulls off the same \"reality\" trick, as both its stars are musicians.\n\n\"Cabaret\" further ups the ante as its songs add depth to the story taking place outside the dance hall by treating the music as a mirror.\n\nOn the literary front, two movie musical powerhouses have as their source two powerhouse playwrights. William Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet,\" first filmed in 1936 starring Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard, was transformed into \"West Side Story\" in 1961. Any film featuring the music of Leonard Bernstein, the lyrics of Stephen Sondheim and the choreography of Jerome Robbins doesn't have to worry if its star, Natalie Wood, is lip-syncing.\n\nDitto for 1964's \"My Fair Lady,\" whose marquee name, Audrey Hepburn, didn't sing either. In both films, Marni Nixon, the queen of the dubbers, provides the vocals. The role of Eliza Doolittle should have gone to its Broadway star, Julie Andrews, but then we might not have had \"Mary Poppins,\" which was released in the same year.\n\n\"My Fair Lady\" is based on George Bernard Shaw's \"Pygmalion,\" which was made into a 1938 British film starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller.\n\nShakespeare's name rolls in the credits again as his \"Taming of the Shrew\" was transformed into \"Kiss Me Kate,\" a 1953 musical starring Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel. In this case, the \"straight\" film followed the musical with 1967's \"Shrew\" starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.\n\nCharles Dickens got into the act when his novel \"Oliver Twist\" was first made into a film in 1922 with Lon Chaney as Fagin. The 1968 musical version, \"Oliver!\" won the Best Picture Oscar as did \"West Side Story\" and \"My Fair Lady.\" Interestingly, none of the originals has taken home the top prize. \"The Philadelphia Story\" lost to \"Rebecca,\" and \"The Producers\" wasn't even nominated.\n\nIn the 1990s, Disney made a cottage industry out of turning live-action films into cartoon musical hybrids, mixing comedy, drama and song. For example, \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" first filmed in 1923 and once again starring Chaney, became a 1996 musical; \"Tarzan the Ape Man,\" first filmed in 1932 and starring Johnny Weissmuller, became a 1999 musical; \"Hercules,\" first filmed in 1959 and starring Steve Reeves, became a 1997 musical; and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" first filmed in 1946 and starring Jean Marais, became a 1991 musical. The latter was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar - the only animated film to be so honored - but lost to \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"\n\n\"The Phantom of the Opera,\" first filmed in 1925 and starring Chaney yet again, was transformed into a 2004 musical with Gerard Butler as the man behind the mask.\n\n\"Little Shop of Horrors,\" Roger Corman's 1960 black comedy featuring a young Jack Nicholson, became a 1986 movie musical featuring the voice of Levi Stubbs as the plant with an unhealthy appetite. Stubbs first gained fame as the lead singer of the Four Tops.\n\n\"Anna and the King of Siam,\" the 1946 film starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, was transformed into \"The King and I,\" the 1956 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical starring Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner. It was also nominated for a Best Picture Oscar but lost to \"Around the World in 80 Days.\" Shall we heave?\n\n\"Ninotchka,\" the 1939 film starring Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, became \"Silk Stockings,\" the 1957 musical starring Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire. \"Ninotchka\" was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, too, but lost to an obscure movie called \"Gone with the Wind.\"\n\nAlso from 1939 comes \"Bachelor Mother\" starring Astaire's dancing partner, Ginger Rogers. The film became the 1956 musical \"Bundle of Joy\" starring Debbie Reynolds, marking the film debut of Eddie Fisher and creating a musical matrimonial menage-a-trois. Reynolds married Fisher, who later married Elizabeth Taylor, who later married Richard Burton, who starred in \"Camelot\" on Broadway. The Arthurian legend, which serves as the basis for \"Camelot,\" has received a few \"straight\" versions over the years. My personal favorite, dating back to my childhood, is 1963's \"The Sword in the Stone,\" yet another Disney cartoon.\n\nOn a less frothy note, films of great directors have received the musical treatment, too.\n\n\"Smiles of a Summer Night,\" the 1955 Swedish film directed by Ingmar Bergman, who died last month, inspired the 1978 musical \"A Little Night Music\" starring Elizabeth Taylor. Her rendition of \"Send in the Clowns\" won't be confused with Judy Collins' version anytime soon.\n\n\"Nights of Cabiria,\" the 1957 Italian film directed by Federico Fellini, became the basis for \"Sweet Charity,\" the 1969 musical starring Shirley MacLaine.\n\nTo give the Great White Way its due, we should note that some of the \"straight\" films came from Broadway, such as \"The Philadelphia Story,\" while many of the movie musicals also got their start on Broadway, such as \"Hairspray.\"\n\nThere actually is a musical version of \"Reefer Madness,\" the 1936 propaganda film that depicts marijuana as the greatest evil since Satan. One of the worst movies of all time, the musical version first appeared off-Broadway and was later made into a cable TV movie. In case you're curious, Paula Abdul, of \"American Idol\" fame, choreographed the off-Broadway show.\n\nNow all we need is a musical version of \"Jaws.\" Cue \"Mack the Knife\" - \"Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear, and it shows them pearly white.\"\n\nAuthor, author!\n\nIt's now time for TRIVIA.\n\nLast month's tester: What actor appeared in three different films directed by the same director all beginning with the same letter in the 1960s? Serials, sequels and remakes don't count. You must name the director and the films, too.\n\nAnswer: Paul Newman. The films are \"Hud,\" \"Hombre\" and \"Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man,\" all directed by Martin Ritt.\n\nChris Libby of Marlborough was the first reader to answer the question correctly. Congratulations! Other readers answering correctly were Karen Walz of Waltham, Bill Bertera of Waltham, Michael Matondi of Hopedale and Adele Robinson of Ashland.\n\nWe'll also give credit to Stephen McAlear of Franklin and Norma Shulman of Framingham, who used the first letter in the article \"the\" in their answers. Where were the \"a\" and \"an\" responses? Clearly, yours truly has to be more specific next time. No articles! Anyway, since I wasn't more specific, the responses deserve mention.\n\nMcAlear submitted Jack Nicholson, who was in \"The Terror,\" \"The Raven\" and \"The St. Valentine's Day Massacre,\" all directed by Roger Corman. Shulman submitted Burt Lancaster, who was in \"The Train,\" \"The Young Savages\" and \"The Gypsy Moths,\" all directed by John Frankenheimer.\n\nThis month's tester: Name the two movies released three years apart, one about World War II and the other about prison life, that take their titles from works by the same author. Clue: The World War II film was released in the late 1960s. In addition to naming the two films, you must name the works and the author.\n\nThe first person to answer the trivia question correctly will receive a $10 gift certificate for The Vin Bin, 27 South Bolton St. (Rte. 85 near Rte. 20) in Marlborough.\n\nTrivia enthusiasts can call me at 508-626-4409 or e-mail me at btremblay@cnc.com.\n\nMake sure you leave your name, address and number on my message machine or e-mail so I can contact you if you answered the question correctly. The address is needed so winners can be mailed their prize. Callers should spell out their names slowly and clearly so their names will be spelled correctly in the column. Only one guess per household, please.\n\nAnswers will be accepted until 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 14. Good luck!"
