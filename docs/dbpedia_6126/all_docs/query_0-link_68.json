        "text": "Valentine's Day is near, and this year it lands on a not-so-romantic day: Monday. It’s time to master a new at-home fancy dinner, pop a bottle of bubbly from Spec’s (or to order takeout), and kick back with a movie.\n\nThere are hundreds—if not thousands—of romantic comedies and classic, sweeping love stories out there, with more being made each year. How will you choose what movie to watch while you and your significant other (or you and your furry friends, if you’re just wanting a little cinematic romantic diversion) are snuggled up under a blanket? And although some of our choices are not free to stream, saving on going out will give you the acceptance to splurge a little on a low-budget.\n\nHere’s a list of 55 movies available to freely stream with a subscription or purchase for a low price.\n\nThe Classics\n\nAn Affair to Remember (1957)\n\nThe most famous iteration of this oft-remade story! (We'll get there with its predecessor, but we're telling you now, don't bother with the 1994 take). Directed by Leo McCarey, Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant are engaged (to other people, mind you) and meet on a European cruise. They fall in love and agree to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in six months. But, when an unfortunate accident keeps her from being able to meet him, he worries that she has married—or no longer loves him. Should a movie with such clear demarcations of melodrama be as effervescent as pink champagne? You be the judge.\n\nAvailable on Amazon Prime for $3.99.\n\nCasablanca (1942)\n\nA sweeping story of love and World War II, this classic black-and-white movie follows Rick (Humphrey Bogart) a nightclub owner in, you know, Casablanca, as he realizes his old flame Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) has arrived in town. However, she's with her husband, a famed rebel, who has the German forces right on his tail. Ilsa knows that Rick has the connections to get her husband out of the country and to safety, but will old passions reignite? This movie pairs well with red wine, a charcuterie board, and asking your significant other if they would let you get on the plane at the end of the movie—and if they happen to have a Bogie-style trench coat hanging around...\n\nStreaming on HBO Max.\n\nLibeled Lady (1936)\n\nWe love all the classic screwball comedies and this one is an oft-overlooked gem, despite being an Oscar winner: When a major newspaper accuses socialite Connie (the great Myrna Loy in one of her early pairings with William Powell) of being a homewrecker, she takes out a multimillion-dollar lawsuit to clear her name. The frazzled editor-in-chief (Spencer Tracy playing second banana and still stealing just about every scene) of the newspaper, his fiancée (Jean Harlow in a role that underscores the comedic chops that were never displayed enough during her brief, brilliant career), and their friend embark on a scheme to prove Connie is the homewrecker they claim she is. Of course, things don't go as planned, and the results—\"If you don't wanna marry me, just say so!\"—are a joy to watch play out.\n\nAvailable on Amazon Prime for $2.99.\n\nLove Affair (1939)\n\nNo, this is not an An Affair to Remember remake. In fact, this is the very first version of that oft-remade classic flick.And as wonderful as the more famous version is, this one has a snap and sparkle all its own, particularly with Dunne's sharp, witty performance, from her entrance through to her zippy delivery of the final line.The film follows engaged playboy Michel Marnet (Charles Boyer), who meets spoken-for singer Terry McKay (Irene Dunne) aboard a cruise. And as wonderful as the more famous version is, this one has a snap and sparkle all its own, particularly with Dunne's sharp, witty performance, from her entrance through to her zippy delivery of the final line. Sparks fly on the cruise, but they agree to go back to their significant others once they reach New York City and meet again in six months on top of the Empire State Building. A tragic accident keeps Terry from being able to meet Michel, and he wonders if she still cares for him.\n\nAvailable on Amazon Prime and SlingTV Premium Subscription, free on Tubi.\n\nThe Awful Truth (1937)\n\nAnother screwball classic helmed by the great Leo McCary, in this one Cary Grant and Irene Dunne play a married couple in this movie, but Grant suspects that Dunne hasn’t been faithful, and Irene has the same suspicions about Grant. The two divorce and immediately rush into other relationships (#classic), but discover they still have feelings for one another and begin sabotaging each other’s new relationships to try to get back together.\n\nAvailable on Amazon Prime for $2.99.\n\nSing Your Heart Out\n\nGrease (1978)\n\nEven if you learned every song back in middle school, go take it in with fresh eyes, and your honey. Why? Because this classic movie musical will have you singing along and admiring all the bad decisions teenagers can make. Squeaky clean Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) and super cool greaser Danny (John Travolta) are in love and crossing clique lines. Perfect for a night of popcorn and nostalgia. Plus, comedy buffs take note, the great Sid Caesar has a small, but hilarious, role as the coach.\n\nAvailable on YouTube, AppleTV and Amazon Prime for $2.99.\n\nHairspray (2007)\n\nYou can’t stop the beat! Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) wants nothing more than to dance on TV, but her mom (John Travolta, in a truly endearing and sweet performance) won’t let her. But when she does get her shot, she—and her friends and family—learn a lot about not only romance, but loving also themselves and their fellow man. It’s a toe-tapping good time with a stellar cast.\n\nStreaming on Netflix.\n\nLa La Land (2016)\n\nSebastian and Mia (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone) get together because of their common desire to do what they love in Los Angeles. The two help each other strive to achieve their dreams, until both grapple with the possible implications of success and selling out—and assure each other they will always love one another. Stunning choreography (by Mandy Moore, the choreographer, not the singer/actress) and beautiful visuals make this a fun Valentine’s Day watch, while the music is fun. And honestly, despite all the shade about the \"sellout\" song Sebastian does with the John Legend character (played by none other than Legend himself) we really dig it.\n\nAvailable on Hulu Premium.\n\nMoulin Rouge! (2001)\n\nBaz Luhrmann’s classic over-the-top musical is perfect for your V-Day viewing. It's that same old story, struggling writer Christian (Ewan MacGregor) becomes the writer for a play at the Moulin Rouge through a series of wild happenstances, and he falls for the beautiful star courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman) but told with Luhrmann's incredible kaleidoscopic style. This jukebox musical is visually stunning and will have you singing, laughing, and crying the whole night long.\n\nAvailable on Hulu and Amazon Premium.\n\nSingin’ in the Rain (1952)\n\nWhen movies made the transition from silent films to “talkies,” not everyone was able to make the cut—but this musical about that process has long been hailed as one of the best musicals of Hollywood's Golden Era. Don (the incredible Gene Kelly) and Lina (Jean Hagen, so hilarious you'll be shocked to learn that her real voice sounds nothing like the infamous squeaky tones that help her dominate the film) have always been cast as a couple, but when Lina’s voice just isn’t what people imagined for a musical (in fact, it’s kind of awful!), aspiring actress Kathy (Debbie Reynolds) is hired to provide a new voice for Lina. This film also features Donald O'Connor's \"Make 'Em Laugh\" and O'Connor's physical comedy tour-de-force can only be rivaled by, well, every other brilliant part of this charming film.\n\nStreaming on HBO Max.\n\nThe Prom (2020)\n\nA teen girl wants to go to the prom with her girlfriend, but the PTA ends up canceling the prom instead. Four down-on-their-luck Broadway actors arrive to shake things up and make a brand-new prom. This fun movie-musical will have you dancing along in your seat this Valentine’s Day. Oh, and Meryl Streep is in it, plus James Corden who even managed to make that awful feline-centric movie almost palatable whenever he was on screen.\n\nStreaming on Netflix.\n\nJohn Hughes and the Best of the ’80s\n\nDirty Dancing (1987)\n\n“I’ve had the time of my life, and I owe it all to you…” This classic movie is highly quotable (“I carried a watermelon?”) and perfect for a romantic night in. This movie follows Baby (Jennifer Gray) as she forms a bond with a cute dance instructor (Patrick Swayze, H-Town's own!) at a sleepy Catskills resort. This movie may inspire you to try that lift with your boo this Valentine’s Day, but be wary, it could lead to disastrous results.\n\nAvailable on Hulu Premium.\n\nPretty in Pink (1986)\n\nMolly Ringwald, Jon Cryer, and Andrew McCarthy star in this classic Brat Pack film. Andie (Ringwald) begins dating much-cooler-than-her Blaine (McCarthy) while juggling her record store job and her best friend’s crush on her (Duckie, played by Cryer). Throughout the film, she learns that it’s hard to date outside your social sphere. And then she ruins that amazing vintage dress, but it was the 1980s, a time of so many fashion sins. Also, catch James Spader in full entitled-douche glory being thoroughly unpleasant and clearly enjoying the hell out himself in the process.\n\nAvailable to Hulu and Amazon Premium.\n\nSay Anything… (1989)\n\nOften imitated, the iconic scene of John Cusack holding up a boombox makes this movie is classic. Cusack plays Lloyd, a true optimist, who has his first love with Diane (Ione Skye), but her father does not approve of him. Nostalgic and heartwarming, unless you're just really over that Peter Gabriel song, this tale of first love is a perfect pick for Valentine’s Day.\n\nStreaming on HBO Max.\n\nSixteen Candles (1984)\n\nMolly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall: this is classic 1980’s goodness. Sam Baker (Ringwald) believes her 16th birthday will be the start of a fantastic new year for her—but, alas, her entire family forgets about it! Hijinks ensue as Sam finds herself caught between a boy she doesn’t like and a boy she does. The ending scene is truly iconic, although, yes, we too always wonder how her pink dress didn't burst into flames hovering so near all of those birthday candles.\n\nStreaming on Hulu.\n\nThe Wedding Singer (1998)\n\nNot exactly filmed in the 80's, but takes place in 1985. Adam Sandler’s character has one of the most romantic jobs– a wedding singer. Once he’s left at the altar at his own wedding, he loses all hope in finding true love until Julia (Drew Barrymore), asks for him to help plan her wedding. He falls in love with her, of course, and attempts to win her over before her wedding day.\n\nStreaming on Netflix.\n\nLove Is Dead (and They Don’t Get Together)\n\n500 Days of Summer (2009)\n\nGreeting card writer Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a hopeless romantic who has lost a bit of his zest for life. When his girlfriend Summer (played by Zooey Deschanel) breaks up with him, Tom takes the time to reflect on his relationship with her (500 days long) and rediscovers his passion once more.\n\nStreaming on Hulu and Amazon Prime.\n\nBlue Valentine (2010)\n\nThis romantic drama stars Ryan Gosling as Dean, a high school dropout with a hopeless romantic streak. He falls for Cindy (Michelle Williams), a pre-med student, pregnant with another man’s baby. This movie follows the ups and downs of their relationship in a nonlinear way, making for a unique way of viewing a doomed relationship.\n\nStreaming on Amazon Prime.\n\nBrokeback Mountain (2005)\n\nRodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and ranch hand Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) have been hired as sheepherders in the American West. They fall for each other in the mountains of Wyoming, but end up marrying other people—Ennis marries his longtime sweetheart, Alma (Michelle Williams), and Jack marries a fellow rodeo rider (Anne Hathaway). The film follows their 20-year secret relationship and will leave your heart aching this Valentine’s Day.\n\nAvailable on Hulu Premium.\n\nRoman Holiday (1953)\n\nAnn (Audrey Hepburn) is a very busy crown princess from an unnamed European country. She just wants to experience a little freedom, so she sneaks away and accidentally falls asleep on a park bench! Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), a reporter, finds her and takes her home to keep her safe—not realizing she is a princess, of course. The two go on Roman adventures together, but that’s all. Ann gets her day of freedom, and Joe gets a story he refuses to print. This film was Hepburn's big break, and her gamin looks in this film are still inspiring imitation pixie cuts to this day.\n\nAvailable on Amazon Premium.\n\nUnder the Tuscan Sun (2003)\n\nFrances Mayes (Diane Lane) has just learned that her husband is cheating on her—from an angry writer to whom she gave a bad review, no less! So, when her best friend Patti (played by Sandra Oh, marvelous throughout the film) suggests she tour Italy, Frances agrees, but then she takes it one step further and buys a villa in Tuscany to completely restart her life (and possibly find romance with the handsome Marcello) This is a great movie about starting over and taking risks. None of it plays out as planned, and Frances gradually realizes her life is all the better for that.\n\nStreaming on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe NeoClassics\n\nGhost (1990)\n\nSam (Houston's own Patrick Swayze again!) and Molly (Demi Moore) are in love. But, when Sam is murdered by his business partner, he is stuck as a ghost, totally powerless. However, by seeking out a psychic (played by Whoopi Goldberg), he is able to protect Molly from his murderer’s goons. Pair this classic with an arts-and-crafts night (Who wouldn’t want to re-create that pottery scene?). Goldberg won her Oscar for this one, and while some maintain this was an apology win (and that it should've gone to her for The Color Purple) they're missing how wonderful she is here, although, yes, she also should've won the other Oscar too.\n\nAvailable to stream on Amazon Premium.\n\nSleepless in Seattle (1993)\n\nTom Hanks and Meg Ryan star in this classic Nora Ephron film, arguably the peak of this dynamic duo's three pairings. After the death of his wife, Hanks moves to Seattle with his son, where the son promptly calls in on a radio show to find a new wife for his dad. Ryan—an engaged reporter in Baltimore—hears about this and falls in love with Hanks after hearing him on the radio. They write letters and agree to meet on top of the Empire State Building. This is classic early-’90s goodness, perfectly paired with pizza and the coziest blanket you own.\n\nStreaming on Amazon Prime.\n\nTitanic (1997)\n\nThe penny whistle. Celine Dion. Dropping the Heart of the Ocean back into the ocean? Classic. Kate Winslet plays Rose, a Philadelphia socialite on her way back to America with her fiancé and her family aboard the Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jack, a carefree but poor American artist coming back from spending time in Paris. The two meet and fall in love, but their love is on a timer, as the boat, as we all know, will inevitably sink. This romance boasts some truly iconic scenes (The handprint on the car door! The staircase! “Draw me like one of your French girls!”) and is perfect for Valentine’s Day, if you’re in a relationship or not.\n\nAvailable on Hulu and Amazon Premium.\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally (1989)\n\nHarry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan, here just beginning her reign as the queen of rom coms) are recent college graduates with a question—can a man and woman really be friends without sex coming between them? They cannot come to a conclusion, and ten years pass. Now, older and wiser, they set out to be friends. This classic features some truly iconic scenes (Katz Delicatessen, anyone?) alongside the sharp romantic commentary of Nora Ephron while being skillfully helmed by the wonderful Rob Reiner.\n\nAvailable to stream on HBO Max.\n\nToday Was a Fairytale\n\nCinderella (2015)\n\nOne of the original Disney live-action remakes, this version of the classic tale, directed by Kenneth Branagh, is nothing short of opulent. From the costumes to the scenery, this movie will have you gasping from the sheer beauty of every set piece and gown. Cinderella (Lily James) longs for a day off from her servitude, and that chance comes in the form of an invitation to the ball via the prince (Richard Madden, a.k.a. GOT’s Robb Stark). What makes this version stand out from the 1950 animated original is that Cinderella actually talks with the prince and you see the impact her kindness has on him. It’s a beautifully shot, truly romantic movie that will make you believe in fairytales.\n\nAvailable on Hulu and Amazon Premium.\n\nEnchanted (2007)\n\nWhat happens when fairytales and the real world collide? This classic Disney movie explores just that. Amy Adams plays Giselle, a hopeful young woman who longs to marry the prince. But an accidental trip down the well drops her in New York City (enormous ball gown and all), where she falls for divorce lawyer Robert Philip (played by Patrick Dempsey). Magic and real life continue to collide throughout the movie, making this a fun, whimsical movie, perfectly paired with popcorn and milkshakes. By the way, there's a sequel in the works!\n\nAvailable to stream on Disney Plus.\n\nEver After (1998)\n\nDanielle (Drew Barrymore) is a bright and vivacious girl who is hated by her wicked stepmother Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston). While this may seem like your classic Cinderella story, if you ever felt that the original needed more discussion of class, politics, and that Cinderella and the prince should chat more, this is the movie for you. Danielle disguises herself as a member of the court to get some more face-to-face time with the prince and ends up changing his life for the better. It’s a beautifully shot and romantic story, perfect for a cozy night in.\n\nAvailable on Hulu and Amazon Premium.\n\nRodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella (1997)\n\nThe cast of this movie is utter perfection. Brandy plays Cinderella, who works day and night at the beck and call of her wicked stepmother (Bernadette Peters) and evil stepsisters.
