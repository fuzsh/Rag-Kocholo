Георгия Великого мученика) is a historic Russian Orthodox church on St. George Island, Alaska.\n\nA first church was built on the island during 1870–78; the current church was constructed next to the original foundation in the 1920s. As there were no trees on the island; all materials had to be brought in. The uniqueness of this church is that it was one of a few structures on St. George not owned by the federal government during the commercial harvest of fur seals. Proceeds earned by the community members built the church that stands today.\n\nPresently the church is serviced by visiting clergy. Regular reader services still continue by the local people in both the English language and Church Slavonic.\n\nAccording to a 1979 evaluation, “of all the Russian Orthodox village churches and chapels in Alaska, this may be the best example of effective balance and integration of classic designs to produce a building pleasing to the eye and utile in its purpose.”\n\nO Holy Great Martyr George, Pray Unto God For Us!"
