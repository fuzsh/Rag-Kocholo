        "text": "In 1839 Fr Thomas Doyle bought part of St George’s Fields, a site owned by the City of London, and engaged Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin as architect to design a new church.\n\nAWN Pugin was the leader of the Gothic Revival, he is best known for his decorative work on the Houses of Parliament. The funds available did not match his first ambitious plans, and he was forced to compromise his design. The money for the upper part of the tower and a spire was never found. However the building was still very impressive and seated 3000 people.\n\nSt. George’s was opened on 4 July 1848 by Bishop (later Cardinal) Wiseman. Pope Pius IX restored the Catholic Hierarchy of England and Wales in 1850 and on 21 April 1852 St. George’s officially became the Cathedral church of the new Diocese of Southwark.\n\nOn the night of 16 April 1941, the Cathedral was hit by an incendiary bomb, starting a fire which destroyed the wooden roof and much else. The adjoining Amigo Hall temporarily became the pro-cathedral.\n\nThe new Cathedral was designed by Romilly Craze and rebuilding began in 1953, with the help of generous donations from Ireland and the USA which augmented War Damage Commission funds.\n\nIn the new Cathedral, Craze attempted to blend an Arts & Crafts/Gothic Revival style with surviving elements of the pre-war building. The two chantries and the Blessed Sacrament Chapel are the most notable survivors. Once again, there was no money for the upper part of the tower and a spire. The addition of the clerestory introduced light, air and a grandeur previously lacking.\n\nThe different types of Gothic used in the building were an attempt to suggest age, as in ancient cathedrals built over different time periods. The Baptistery was inspired by Perpendicular, whilst the Day Chapel has a Tudor-derived pattern.\n\nSpecial Points of Interest:"
