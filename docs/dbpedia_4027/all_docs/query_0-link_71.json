        "text": "The word Copt is derived from the Greek word Aigyptos, which was, in turn, derived from “Hikaptah“, one of the names for Memphis, the first capital of Ancient Egypt. The modern use of the term “Coptic” describes Egyptian Christians, as well as the last stage of the ancient Egyptian language script. Also, it describes the distinctive art and architecture that developed as an early expression of the new faith. The Coptic Church is based on the teachings of Saint Mark who brought Christianity to Egypt during the reign of the Roman emperor Nero in the first century, a dozen of years after the Lord’s ascension. He was one of the four evangelists and the one who wrote the oldest canonical gospel. Christianity spread throughout Egypt within half a century of Saint Mark’s arrival in Alexandria as is clear from the New Testament writings found in Bahnasa, in Middle Egypt, which date around the year 200 A.D., and a fragment of the Gospel of Saint John, written using the Coptic language, which was found in Upper Egypt and can be dated to the first half of the second century. The Coptic Church, which is now more than nineteen centuries old, was the subject of many prophecies in the Old Testament. Isaiah the prophet, “In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border. “Isaiah 19:19 Although fully integrated into the body of the modern Egyptian nation, the Copts have survived as strong religious entities that pride themselves on their contribution to the Christian world. The Coptic Church regards itself as a strong defendant of Christian faith.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://saintgeorgecopticchurch.org/\n\nExternal link for St. George Coptic Orthodox Church\n\nIndustry\n\nReligious Institutions\n\nCompany size\n\n51-200 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nTampa, Florida\n\nType\n\nNonprofit"
