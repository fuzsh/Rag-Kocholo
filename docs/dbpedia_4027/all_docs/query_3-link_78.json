        "text": "We share life together as a community.\n\nMembership\n\nIn addition to the important events marked by the church, St. George's families participate in the life of St. George's through membership. Those interested in learning more about belonging at St. George's are invited to attend St. George's 101, an evening with dinner, shared Eucharist, and teaching from our clergy. During this evening we'll share how the church will support you and how you can become a part of our community.\n\nTo learn more about St. George's 101, please contact Martha Rodes, Director of Lay Ministry Engagement | 615-385-2150 x 249 or martha.rodes@stgeorgesnashville.org.\n\nBaptism\n\n\"Holy Baptism is full initiation by water and the Holy Spirit into Christ's Body the Church. The bond which God establishes in baptism is indissoluble\" (The Book of Common Prayer, p. 298).\n\nSt. George's celebrates baptism of adults and children on particular days of the liturgical year. There are a limited number of slots at each service. To reserve a baptism day/time, please fill out the Baptism Request Form. Dates are added to the form throughout the year.\n\nFor the baptism of children, we ask that at least one parent should be a baptized, practicing Christian and a member of St. George’s Church. An active life in God's church is essential to Christian faith and discipleship for both the newly baptized and his or her family.\n\nQuestions? Contact Claudia Taylor, Executive Assistant to the Rector | 615-385-2150 x 218 or claudia.taylor@stgeorgesnashville.org.\n\nFirst Communion\n\nOur Communion Class is an optional 5-week course to help 3rd graders grow deeper in their faith as they gain understanding about the prayers, actions, and elements of Holy Communion. Many parents like to use this class to prepare their child for first Communion, but the class is equally beneficial for children who have already been receiving communion.\n\nQuestions? Contact Sarah Puryear, Associate Priest for Family Ministries | 615-385-2150 x 222 or sarah.puryear@stgeorgesnashville.org.\n\nConfirmation\n\nAdult and youth candidates for confirmation complete a course that empowers them to take ownership of their faith, affirm their baptismal promises, and make a public commitment to Christ. Each year in May, the Bishop makes his annual visitation to St. George's and confirms all of our adult and youth confirmands during Sunday services.\n\nOur youth traditionally prepare for confirmation in the 8th grade, but we welcome older students who have not yet been confirmed. At least one parent needs to be a member of St. George's prior to registering their youth for confirmation.\n\nQuestions about adult confirmation? Contact Martha Rodes, Director of Lay Ministry Engagement | 615-385-2150 x 249 or martha.rodes@stgeorgesnashville.org.\n\nQuestions about youth confirmation? Contact Daniel Huff, Director of Youth Ministries | 615-385-2150 x 222 or daniel.huff@stgeorgesnashville.org.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn the Diocese of Tennessee, the Sacrament of Marriage (Holy Matrimony) is a solemn public covenant in the presence of God. At least one of the parties must be an active baptized member at St. George’s. Learn more about weddings at St. George's\n\nQuestions? Contact Claudia Taylor, Executive Assistant to the Rector | 615-385-2150 x 218 or claudia.taylor@stgeorgesnashville.org.\n\nRite of Reconciliation\n\nThe Sacrament of Confession can be scheduled at any time with a priest and is strictly a voluntary request on the part of a penitent.\n\nQuestions? Contact any of our clergy at 615-385-2150.\n\nFunerals\n\nA member of the clergy should be contacted as soon as possible after a death of a church member has occurred. Although burial is not a Sacrament in the Episcopal Church, we offer a holy time to pay respects to the deceased. Follow this link for the Funeral Guidelines for services at St. George's.\n\nQuestions? Contact Claudia Taylor, Executive Assistant | 615-385-2150 x 218 or claudia.taylor@stgeorgesnashville.org.\n\nFunerals currently scheduled at St. George’s can be found online here.\n\nBurial\n\nThe Columbarium of St. George's Episcopal Church is a consecrated burial ground, set apart for the interment of the ashes of members of the parish and their families. The Columbarium is located in a courtyard adjacent to the Jane Tompkins Weeks Chapel. Plots may be purchased at any time.\n\nContact Peggy Fitzgerald, Columbarium Custodian | 615-297-2749"
