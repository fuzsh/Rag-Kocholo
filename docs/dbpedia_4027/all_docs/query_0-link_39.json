        "text": "The Greek Orthodox church of Saint George is one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt cultural heritage. This monument exists within the Fortress of Babylon, a Roman site which dates from 300 AD. Old Cairo has been identified as a core of activity by Muslims, Jewish, Coptic and Greek Orthodox religions. Several studies have been previously developed before the elaboration of this restoration project. These studies were mainly to lower the water table which has been incradibly increased due to the rapid expansion of population within the vicinity. A dewatering system was developed and identified as contract 102. This process resulted in several cracks in the structure main elements especially for the upper recently built part of the church which is in a serious condition. The vertical cracks in its outer wall, together with the roof and the dome cracks are the main threaten to the structure overall stability. These cracks initiate a serious safety problem which may result in a local or even total failure especially if the building is subjected to unexpected load conditions (earthquakes, excessive vibrations as result of explosions or even under the effect of heavy traffic vibrations). A quick intervention requires a deeper knowledge for each element of the structure and accurate investigation to develop an appropriate technique for repair and strengthening. The accurate investigation is a key element for successful intervention. The present study is based mainly on an accurate system of investigation, monitoring and data collection required for computer modeling. The computer modeling is the key element for applying a successful structural restoration intervention. The study will propose a method of analysis able to interpret and to forecast the observed damage and collapse modes."
