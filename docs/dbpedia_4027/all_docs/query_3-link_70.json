        "text": "Burial in St George’s\n\nIn mid-March 1617 Pocahontas died while making a return voyage to Virginia. The last place down-river to take on fresh food and water would have been Gravesend, and it was here that Pocahontas may well have been brought ashore, either dead or dying.\n\nThose who attended Pocahontas ensured her burial in the chancel of the parish church – the place reserved for clergy and notable parishioners. They then resumed their journey, leaving a small error in the Burial Register that no one could correct: ‘March 21 – Rebecca Wrolfe, wyffe of Thomas Rolfe gent. A Virginian lady borne, was buried in ye chancell’.\n\nCaptain Argall advised Rolfe to land his son Thomas at Plymouth, to be looked after until Rolfe’s ‘brother’, Henry (possibly a cousin) could fetch him back to London. From Virginia, Rolfe wrote, ‘My wife’s death is much lamented: my child much desired, when it is of better strength to endure so hard a passage, whose life greatly extinguisheth the sorrow of her loss, saying, “All must die. But ’tis enough that my child liveth”‘.\n\nThe following year Powhatan died. John Rolfe took a third wife, Jane Pierce, who had come out in 1610, and their child Elizabeth was born in 1620. In March 1622, John Rolfe dictated his will ‘being sick in body but of perfect mind and memory’ and presumably died of natural causes. On March 22nd at a pre-arranged signal, the Native Americans turned on the settlers, killing 340, but the survivors took their revenge and stayed on.\n\nThe Family of the Rolfes\n\nThomas, the son of Pocahontas, did not return to Virginia until about 1635. He asked permission to visit his uncle, Powhatan’s successor, but, as Captain of Fort James, he defended the settlers against his uncle’s second bid to destroy them in 1644. He married Jane Poythress, and their child, Jane, married Col. Robert Bolling in 1675. Their numerous descendants claim blood relation to Pocahontas.\n\nIn 1896, the memorial tablet to Pocahontas was put in the chancel of St George’s Church, and the memorial windows were presented by the Colonial Dames of America in 1914. In 1923, a Virginian received permission to search for the remains of Pocahontas, but nothing conclusive was found. St George’s churchyard was laid out as the Princess Pocahontas Garden in 1958, a replica of Jamestown’s statue of Pocahontas was unveiled and the Queen gave St George’s the replica of the chalice and paten used by the original settlers in 1607."
