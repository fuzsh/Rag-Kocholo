        "text": "Having visited parts of North Africa and the Middle East before, we know how common it is to see people spend a whole evening at an outdoor cafe table and only buy one mint tea all night, but here in Cairo there is another custom which has taken us by surprise: bringing your own food. Friends or families will occupy a cafe table all evening, order minimal coffee, tea or even just water, while tucking in to a bagful of food they’ve brought in from the bakers or from a takeaway, or even had delivered by courier to their table. How do these coffee houses make any money!?\n\nAnd as another quirk on the food front, there is Fasahet Somaya. Tucked around a nondescript downtown corner, this is a proper family restaurant where there is no menu, mama just cooks two or three dishes from whatever ingredients she’s bought today – and that’s what you get. We visited twice, and on both occasions the food was simply delicious home cooking.\n\nCairo has one of only two metro systems on the whole African continent (the other, surprisingly, is in Algiers) and it is a good way of swapping one kind of chaotic madness for another, so popular and well used is the network. Every train on the system has two “women only” coaches in the middle, with corresponding areas on the platforms, a result of too many incidents rather than of enlightened thinking, apparently.\n\nTaking the metro out of the centre to Old Cairo, we enter a traffic-free non-Muslim zone which is obviously therefore very different from most of the city for those two reasons alone. It’s popular with tourists too – it’s very noticeable that most of the visitors that we see at the big sights are nowhere to be seen downtown, where we’ve barely seen any at all.\n\nOld Cairo is also known as Coptic Cairo, a tiny enclave of Christianity in this heavily Muslim city and built on what is thought to be the site of Babylon (no, not THAT Babylon, but a significant one nonetheless). Beneath the Church Of St George lies a chamber known as the “cave church”, believed to be the room in which, according to interpretations of the gospels of Matthew, the holy family hid as they escaped Herod during the Flight To Egypt.\n\nOther churches, and a Greek Orthodox cemetery, surround St George’s and the Coptic Museum, as a steady stream of tourists either pay their respects and pray, or otherwise take a cursory look, buy an ice cream and get back on the bus. Despite visitor numbers, it is undoubtedly one of Cairo’s more peaceful corners. We don’t buy an ice cream, by the way – although to be fair we don’t say a prayer either.\n\nWe referred previously to parts of Cairo around the bazaar as looking like newsreel images of a bombed out city; in fact we thought that, if not war, then probably earthquake. Neither thoughts were correct. It seems that during the revolution starting in 2011 which ultimately overthrew President Mubarak almost two years later, the inevitable period of lawlessness saw, amongst other things, many residents build illegal dwellings. Once order was restored, the authorities simply took a proverbial sledgehammer to those buildings and made them uninhabitable despite them being home to hundreds of families. All that remains now is rubble and a vague plan to construct an apartment block or two.\n\nWhen you’re getting close to ending your time in a place, you tend to go back to experience something for a second time, and here for us in Cairo, it’s another bowl of koshary at Abu Tarek. And it’s just as good second time around: great koshary and great fun, the whole place rammed again with everyone eating the one single meal on the menu.\n\nSo we end our time in Cairo with what is probably the most peaceful experience this hectic city has to offer, a felucca ride on the Nile. On a sailing boat with a tall mast in a city full of low slung road bridges, you don’t actually travel very far, but bobbing around on the gentle waters in the sunshine for an hour with the sounds of the city fading into the background feels like the perfect final act in our time here.\n\nIt’s fair to say that Cairo is not the easiest city we’ve been to, it is a relentless pounding of the senses from which it’s not always easy to find refuge, and, with a limited number of worthwhile sights for such a huge and ancient city, we have probably stayed a day too long. We haven’t disliked it any way at all, but it is definitely now time to move on.\n\nRibbons, garlands and bunting are appearing in the city streets as a sacred month approaches. The next few days will see the start of Ramadan, and it strikes us as perhaps a little odd that cafes should put out bunting to herald the fact that virtually nobody is going to buy any food or drink all day for a whole month. It will be so interesting to measure the effects of Ramadan on our journey through Egypt and into Tunisia, and see first hand how it changes daily life for the people here. And just as interesting to see how the character of the Nile changes as we move southwards.\n\nOur next stop is Luxor."
