        "text": "​St. George's stands in the mainstream of classic Anglicanism that affirms the primary authority of Holy Scripture as interpreted by the church through the ages and the work of the Holy Spirit to open our hearts to its truth as systematically expressed in the Book of Common Prayer and the Articles of Religion. Anglicanism is the oldest expression of English-speaking Christianity in North America. Its origin dates to the founding of the Church of England and the extension of its missionary outreach to the Virginia Colony of the British Empire in 1607. Anglican influence on American ideals and institutions include: the biblical spirituality and literary artistry of its Prayer Book, its theological conception of Natural Law and civil government, and the moral formation of early America's great leaders. Nearly two-thirds of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and over one-half of the signers of the Constitution were Anglicans.\n\nOrganized in March of 2009, St. George's Anglican Church emerged when 93% of the Grace Church & St. Stephen's sensed a calling and recommitment to the Gospel from which the Episcopal Church was drifting. Their desire was to establish a parish that is evangelical in faith, catholic in order, and spiritually vibrant in gifts for service. As a member parish of the Anglican Diocese of the West, St. George's is one of nearly 700 congregations re-committed to Gospel proclamation and re-aligned for Christian mission in the Americas and around the world.\n\nIn March of 2009, the parish moved into a former private school that was tucked away in the Mountain Shadows neighborhood on the west side of Colorado Springs. When our lease ended 2 years later we began to look for a permanent home in downtown Colorado Springs. In the summer of 2011 we purchased the building that housed the original Grace Episcopal Church. The original part of the building was constructed in 1874, but the congregation left the building in 1925 to combine with St. Stephen's Parish. Since then the building has served as a restaurant and a night club. It has been our great delight to restore this old building back to its original glory.\n\nThe three primary points of emphasis for the parish are traditional Anglican worship and liturgy, Christian education for all ages, and outreach to our community and world.\n\nWho was St. George?"
