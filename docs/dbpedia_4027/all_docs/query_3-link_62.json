All are welcome, and we hope to see you!\n\nA four-week Sunday morning Christian formation class introducing St. George’s to folks who are new and/or curious about life in our parish.\n\nThis week’s (April 7) topic of discussion: Church History\n\nSaint George is thought to have been born into a noble Christian family in the late third century in what is now modern-day Turkey. As a soldier and officer in the Roman army, he refused to denounce his faith and persecute fellow Christians, leading to his martyrdom in 303 AD. Legend has told that Saint George slew a dragon to save a princess, the King’s daughter. Join us as we celebrate this Sain on Sunday, April 28.\n\nOur entire community is invited to SAFE to bless Eloise House and the recently-completed comfort bags. We are thrilled and honored by this invitation and hope many can attend. Both blessings will involve the laying on of hands, and our congregation will be joined by the staff and nurse advocates at SAFE as we unite to bless this sacred work. We will depart for SAFE immediately following the service, in lieu of coffee hour. People can carpool or go on their own. The address is 1515 Grove, and exact directions for parking and location on the SAFE campus will be provided that morning."
