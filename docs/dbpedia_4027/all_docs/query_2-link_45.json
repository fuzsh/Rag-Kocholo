        "text": "Christ is in our midst!\n\nWe are a growing and active parish, and we welcome you to join us.\n\nAt St. George’s, first and foremost, we worship together in the confidence that our Lord Jesus Christ is invisibly present with us, as He promised. We have a continuous history from the beginning of the Church, and we still worship the way the New Testament Church worshipped. That is, our service is directed to God in Thanksgiving for all that He has done for us, particularly through His death and Resurrection. Our worship is not trying to cater to a contemporary ‘audience,’ but it is majestic, befitting the Almighty God, as our King. At the same time, we also feel we are at home in our “Father’s house,” for we know that He has adopted us to be His children.\n\nWe also study the Faith together in the children’s church school programs and in various adult study groups. We work together on various ministries, ranging from our charity ministries to the needy to youth ministry to building maintenance. Finally, but also very important, we enjoy fellowship with one another. Our Lord Himself prayed that His disciples would be united even to the profound degree that He and His Father are one. He also said, “By this all men will know that you are my disciples: if you have love for one another.”\n\nWe believe that God has bestowed on each one of us specific gifts. We come together and bring this variety of God-given talents to the building up of His Body, the Church. The Church is the ark of our salvation, on which we are fellow travelers. In the Church, we help each other in love and unity, so that we may all arrive together in the Kingdom of God, by His grace and mercy.\n\nIn His Service,\n\nFr. Anthony"
