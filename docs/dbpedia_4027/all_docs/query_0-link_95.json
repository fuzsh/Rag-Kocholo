        "text": "It is curious that the flag that flies over the \"round\" church of St. George in Old Cairo is the Greek flag. It just carries the point that the Byzantine See is a foreign presence to an indigenous church that of the Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\nI would like to point out that you ARE monophysites insofar as you believe in the two natures becoming one.\n\nExcerpt from a letter from Bishop Auxentios regarding my question about the Copts and their claim to be Orthodox:\n\nThe short answer, Patrick, is, what do you really expect them to proclaim, that they are heretics?\n\nSo my question is, seeing we orthodox have been out of communion for so many centuries, are we nevertheless both communing from the same Cup, even though we have differences in theology, or do we need to shift(EO to CO)in order to ensure our salvation?\n\none thing that kinda got me was I hear a sermon where he actually made a joke about Orthodox thinking they are the only people getting into heaven."
