        "text": "“The eyes of the world are looking towards Egyptian youth, who are capable of changing the future of their country by offering hope and inspiration to the world. We keep them in our prayers,” said Rev. Dr Olav Fykse Tveit, general secretary of the World Council of Churches (WCC).\n\nTveit shared these views while interacting with young Egyptians of diverse Christian churches whom he met at St Mark's Cathedral in Cairo on Sunday 21 April.\n\nTveit invited young Egyptians to share their experiences, saying that when churches seek to achieve justice and peace their efforts are incomplete without concrete and visible contributions from young people.\n\n“In post-revolution Egypt churches must avoid imposing a minority approach on communities,” said Amira Edwar Abdel-Malik from the St George Coptic Catholic Church in Giza. “Young people should not become a cluster within their own churches but should go out, integrate and make their contributions to the society felt,” she added.\n\nAnother young Egyptian from the Coptic Orthodox Church, Ramy Farouk Mahrous said that a church without youth holds no future. “Seeing Jesus amidst difference is one way to recognize the beauty of diversity, which brings to life the values of ecumenism. This is what we have learned that we can use as young people to apply in our local contexts as Egyptians,” he said.\n\nTveit introduced the theme of the WCC's upcoming Assembly, “God of life, lead us to justice and peace”, to the young people attending the meeting. He said that “the WCC assembly hopes to welcome the spirit of Egypt through its young people and their meaningful participation at the assembly”. The assembly will take place in Busan, Republic of Korea from 30 October to 8 November this year.\n\nWCC general secretary meets with Pope Tawadros II (WCC news release of 21 April 2013)\n\nWCC member churches in Egypt"
