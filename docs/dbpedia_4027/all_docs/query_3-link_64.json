        "text": "St. George’s By the River is architecturally significant for its representation of a Gothic Revival style Church executed in the style of a rural English parish church, a design advocated by Anglican reformers in the mid 19th century. Organized by families who owned summer homes in Rumson when still a resort town, the church is also significant in the area of community development.\n\nThe 2004 Trust grant helped fund a preservation plan that addressed structural and exterior concerns to guide the church’s restoration."
