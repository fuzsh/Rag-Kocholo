Built above one of the fortress towers of the Babylon, the Church of St. George is a Greek Orthodox church in Coptic Cairo. It was originally built in the 7th century, but the current structure was rebuilt following a 1904 fire. St. George is the only round church in Egypt, but unlike the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre and its many imitators, this is only for practical reasons â€“ it is built atop the foundations of a Roman round tower.

Mar is a title of respect in Syriac, literally meaning my lord. It is given to all saints and bishops. Girgis is the Arabized adoption of the Greek word Georgios, thus Mar Girgis means St. George in English.
