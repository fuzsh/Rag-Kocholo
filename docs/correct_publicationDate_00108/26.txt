Disch, Thomas M.

London: MacGibbon & Kee, [1972]. Octavo, boards. First edition. Inscribed and signed by Disch to writer Mike Dickenson on the front free end paper while at the Ted Hughes writing center in Yorkshire in 1978 ."Six interweaving tales set in twenty-first century New York, a scene of high unemployment and heartless 'welfareism.' The book deals convincingly (and unusually) with the marginalized members of a future society. The result is moving and at times harrowing: a masterpiece." - Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, second edition, p. 372, "A brilliant work, utterly convincing in its portraits of people trying to get by in a world they are powerless to influence or control. The most eloquent display of the pessimism that became newly acceptable in New Wave SF." - Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-346. 1974 Nebula nominee. Pringle, Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels #66. Sargent, British and American Utopian Literature, 1516-1985, p. 338. Survey of Science Fiction Literature V, pp. 2774-77. A touch of foxing to top and fore edges, a fine copy in a nearly fine to fine dust jacket with light foxing to the verso and to the upper flap edges. (30391). Item #30391
