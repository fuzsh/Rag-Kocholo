        "text": "Author Authority in short\n\nAuthor Authority can be described as the level of authority an author has gained for a certain topic. If authors publish on trustworthy websites, their credibility and authority grows, and in turn this also helps increase the authority of other platforms they are featured on.\n\nTo successfully communicate Author Authority, authors should:\n\nCreate and maintain an \"About me\" page to explain their trustworthiness in detail\n\nFeature short biographies for every article published\n\nLink to their social media profiles\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Author Authority?\n\nAuthor Authority is a concept that describes the authority an individual author has built up on the web for a certain topic. Authors who publish on trustworthy websites build up authority, which is then applied when they publish on other platforms.\n\nThe concept of Author Authority has been around for years in a more basic form than today.\n\nRemember how in 2011, Google started showing author pictures in combination with a Google Plus profile for articles that contained the authorship markup (rel=\"author\" link relationship)?\n\nYou could say that that was the first time when many SEOs started to think about Author Authority.\n\n\"But those author pictures were removed in 2014, right?\" you ask.\n\nYep, and mid 2016 Google stopped using this authorship markup completely.\n\nBut the underlying concept of Author Authority never went away. It was still there, and it recently became very relevant again because it was mentioned specifically after Google updated its Search Quality Rater Guidelines (SQRG), and the August 1, 2018 Google update that followed.\n\nIs Author Authority a ranking factorRanking Factor\n\nThe term “Ranking Factors” describes the criteria applied by search engines when evaluating web pages in order to compile the rankings of their search results. Ranking factors can relate to a website’s content, technical implementation, user signals, backlink profile or any other features the search engine considers relevant. Understanding ranking factors is a prerequisite for effective search engine optimization.\n\nLearn more now? Probably not, but since the SQRG describes where Google wants her algorithms to go it makes sense to pay attention to this.\n\nWhy should you care about Author Authority?\n\nWhen users are searching for information on a certain topic, they prefer authoritative sources. If Glenn Gabe and a relatively unknown SEO both write about Google's latest broad core update, which article will you trust more?\n\nIn most cases, probably Glenn Gabe's article, as he's an authority in the SEO scene (especially when it comes to analyzing Google updates).\n\nNow let's apply this to SEO: knowing Google, they'll try to catch this train of thought in an algorithm and apply it to web search. That's where Author Authority comes in.\n\nWhile lots of SEOs have forgotten about Author Authority, in today's SEO era there's a strong focus on Expertise, Authority, and Trust. It's always important to explain to search engines who wrote a post.\n\nTo quote Mark Traphagen: \"The fact that author reputation and credibility are now included in the quality rater guidelines is significant.\"\n\nAuthor Authority is particularly interesting today because of the rise of fake news. When put to good use, Author Authority will decrease the amount of fake news reaching the big audiences.\n\nHow do you communicate Author Authority to search engines?\n\nThere are three important elements for successfully communicating Author Authority:\n\nThe About page\n\nLinks to social media profiles\n\nBiographies for every article published\n\nEverything revolves around the About page. All of the author's articles and social media profiles link to it, as it's the main resource about the author.\n\nThe About page\n\nThe author's About page explains in detail why the author is a trusted expert and authority on a specific topic.\n\nTypical things to include:\n\nTheir experience in the specific field\n\nOrganizations they are associated with\n\nAwards they have won\n\nAccomplishments\n\nLinks to pages backing up their authority, such as Wikipedia pages and interviews on well known websites\n\nPublished articles on other authoritative sites\n\nImplement a Schema.org type Person communicating who this page is about and where to find their about page and social media profiles.\n\nExample:\n\nThe author's social media profiles help build up their image and authority. Their name, a short bio, and links to the about page and other social media platforms need to be present on these social media profiles.\n\nBiographies for every article published\n\nIn order for you to fully benefit from Author Rank, it's essential for every page published to contain information about who created the content and is responsible for it, as stated in section 2.5.2 of the SQRG:\n\nThis is especially interesting for articles. We recommend that the author's biography contain:\n\nTheir name\n\nA biography describing their expertise and authority on the topic\n\nLinks to social media profiles: Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn\n\nLink to the About page\n\nIf it's not possible to include everything, at least make sure a link to the About page is included in the biography.\n\nAdditionally, implement the Schema.org type Article that references the author with the Author field and the publisher with the Publisher field.\n\nHow do you increase your Author Authority?\n\nSo you have everything mentioned in the previous section covered. What now?\n\nYou want to increase your Author Authority… but how do you go about this?\n\nIt all comes down to:\n\nPublishing articles on authoritative sites surrounding your area of expertise only (while making sure your bio is set up well). We can't be experts on all subjects, so stick to your own area of expertise.\n\nGrowing your following on social media, and being active there in general.\n\nDoing AMAs; getting interviewed and quoted on other sites.\n\nMaking sure the content you wrote, is actually read, shared, liked, commented on and linked to. The more authoritative the people are that engage with, and share, your content the better.\n\nSearch engines find authority increasingly important. So if you are an authority on a topic and you publish online, be sure to let search engines know about that. Let search engines connect the dots, and apply your authority to the articles you're publishing!"
