        "text": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday July 17 2008\n\nThe novelist Thomas M Disch once observed: \"America is a nation of liars, and for that reason science fiction has a special claim to be our national literature.\" However, the power of reality so intruded that Disch took his own life at the age of 68, leaving an array of work, from stories a few sentences long to a sprawling horror novel by way of witty poetry, children's fiction, opera librettos and an offbeat way with criticism as he leapt \"from one literary frogpond to another\".\n\nBorn in Des Moines, Iowa, where his father, Felix, sold magazines, he was partly educated by his mother, Helen, and brought up in Fairmont and St Paul, Minnesota. He readily memorised poetry at high school and discovered that \"the golden age of science fiction is 12, the age when we begin to read it\". A variety of jobs included being an undertaker's nightwatchman before he moved to New York, where army service intervened in 1957.\n\nOut of kilter with that, he endured a few months' psychiatric incarceration before return to Manhattan. That experience, combined with brooding upon childhood Catholicism, fuelled stories written while working as a theatre usher, among other things, before an insurance job funded architecture studies at the Cooper Union and New York University, from which he dropped out in 1962 when Fantastic Stories accepted a piece.\n\nAfter two years' copywriting, Disch wrote full time as \"a beachcomber on a semi-global scale\" in Mexico, London - as one of the \"new wave\" SF writers published by Michael Moorcock's New Worlds magazine - Italy and Turkey. His first novel, The Genocides (1965), anticipated current concerns: \"Nothing gave the yield per acre that corn did; nothing but rice gave as much nourishment per ounce. Land was at a premium now.\" The Earth is covered by one huge, hideously rooted plant, and a surviving, feuding group of humans forage like \"worms, crawling through an apple\".\n\nIn Camp Concentration (1968), conscientious objectors are given a form of syphilis, the theory being that it heightened their creativity even if it shortened their lives. While 334 (1972), chronicling a dystopian New York of the 2020s, is not as engaging, The Puppies of Terra (1966) describes a mankind under others' leash by means of \"pure electromagnetic phenomenon\" while taught by one Roxanna Proust, whose skin \"scrunched into a great delta of wrinkles, as though from the pressure of squeezing out the tears\". During the confused narrative of Echo Round His Bones (1969), a clone is instantly \"manmitted\" to Mars.\n\nThroughout the 1960s Disch continued to publish stories: The Asian Shore (1970) was an apparent travelogue that mutates splendidly, at some length, into a man's becoming fully Turkish after donning a local outfit made from \"a heavy wool-rayon blend of a sickly and slightly iridescent blue, the muted, imprecise colour of the more unhappy breeds of pigeon\". Brief, complete stories included Vapors (reprinted in the collection Getting Into Death, 1974): \"She wondered, as she stepped into the tub, whether he had told her his real name. Was it only his resemblance to the other one that made her feel like this? Had she only, perhaps, dreamed the whole splendid thing?\"\n\nFurther leapfrogging included poetry, gradually recognised for such witty conceits as A Turkish Holiday, formed entirely from book titles, while Edwardian book spines lend \"our walls their rich red-browns/As of fence posts steeped in creosote\".\n\nDisch lived with fellow poet Charles Naylor, first in London, and then in Manhattan from the 1970s. They collaborated - somehow - on a solid, historical novel, Neighbouring Lives (1980), about the Chelsea of Thomas Carlyle, of which Anthony Burgess wrote: \"The very devotion which they expend on their multiple subject matter makes for a reluctance to move on, clip, slash, subordinate detail to the elan of true fiction.\"\n\nWith The M.D. (1991), Disch attempted Stephen King-style horror, but the words slackened across 550 pages, unlike the truly shocking The Businessman (1984): unable to shake off his murdered wife, Bob Glandier sires a child upon her, the hideous foetus itself soon a ghost, all far from Disch's popular children's book The Brave Little Toaster (1980, filmed by Disney in 1987).\n\nFew might enjoy all of Disch, and he always looked forward, even creating a computer text adventure game, Amnesia (1986), not wanting to become somebody who, Norma Desmond-like, haunted conventions in hopes of continued recognition. Beset, however, by Naylor's death in 2005, an upstate home's flooding, a fire, illness and an eviction threat, he shot himself. One can only echo his ode on Philip K Dick's suicide \"with so much juice/Still to be squeezed, with all that doom could do /To force new bloom from the pollardings/Of late middle-age\".\n\nDisch, who leaves three brothers and a sister, once wrote a charming ballad about a rattlesnake in Christ's manger; The Word of God, a novel told by the deity, has just been published."
