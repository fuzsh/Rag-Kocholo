Disch.\n\nFirst published as a novel in 1972, 334 is a fix-up composed of five previously published novellas, plus a longer novella also titled \"334\"â€” all about a group of interconnected characters living in New York City in the years 2021-2026. The sections in order:\n\nThe Death of Socrates\n\nBodies\n\nEveryday Life in the Later Roman Empire\n\nEmancipation\n\nAngouleme\n\n334\n\nAll notes refer to the 1999 Vintage Books trade paperback edition; see Editions for others.\n\nThe \"Summary\" section on each page gives away some plot details, so avoid it if you're reading the book for the first time.
