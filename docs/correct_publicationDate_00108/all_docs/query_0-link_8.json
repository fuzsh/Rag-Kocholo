The book deals convincingly (and unusually) with the marginalized members of a future society. The result is moving and at times harrowing: a masterpiece.\" - Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, second edition, p. 372, \"A brilliant work, utterly convincing in its portraits of people trying to get by in a world they are powerless to influence or control. The most eloquent display of the pessimism that became newly acceptable in New Wave SF.\" - Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-346. 1974 Nebula nominee. Pringle, Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels #66. Sargent, British and American Utopian Literature, 1516-1985, p. 338. Survey of Science Fiction Literature V, pp. 2774-77.
