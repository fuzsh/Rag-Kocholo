        "text": "Can the corresponding author change once assigned?\n\nPlease ensure the corresponding author is correct at submission. Any change in authorship (including order and designations such as corresponding author) requires the written agreement of all manuscript authors, and may be subject to review in line with the relevant COPE guidelines (click here for more information). After an article has published online, any authorship changes will be accompanied by a relevant notice (correction, retraction, expression of concern).\n\nDo all journals use corresponding authors?\n\nNot all disciplines have a tradition of using corresponding authors, particularly disciplines where there are only one or two authors. However, the affiliation of a corresponding author is generally used to determine eligibility for open access article fee funding under transformative agreements by both publishers and institutions, so we require a corresponding author to be declared for all articles.\n\nDo I have to check with my institution before declaring who corresponding author is?\n\nThe corresponding author should be the person who is most appropriate to fulfil the responsibilities outlined above. We are aware, however, that this might not always be the most advantageous choice in terms of benefiting from transformative agreement funding. For this reason, and for best practice around authorship generally, we recommend article authorship, affiliation information and designation of the corresponding author is discussed and agreed as early as possible in the research process to minimise the risk of misunderstandings and disputes.\n\nHow does the designated corresponding author affect Open Access Agreement eligibility?\n\nEligibility to publish under a transformative open access agreement is based on the corresponding author’s institution – which is provided at manuscript submission – as well as the article type, and is subject to the institution’s confirmation of eligibility.\n\nNote that the date of manuscript acceptance must be during the term date of the transformative agreement in order for the manuscript to be eligible to publish under the agreement.\n\nAny article affiliations should represent the institution(s) at which the research presented was conducted and/or supported and/or approved. For non-research content, any affiliations should represent the institution(s) with which each author is currently affiliated."
