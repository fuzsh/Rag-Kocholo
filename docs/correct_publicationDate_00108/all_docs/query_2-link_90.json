        "text": "A small but possibly important correction:\n\nBack in May 2006, pervect cited a page he found at the well known mathpages.com website, which often has some quite good stuff (although I certainly wouldn't agree with everything the author writes in http://www.mathpages.com/rr/rrtoc.htm, he is a thoughtful writer), and commented\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not quite sure who the author of the above actually is, which makes it a less than perfect source to resolve a debate, but it does agree with my recollection that we don't need to postulate geodesic motion separately.\n\nThen clj4 wrote:\n\nclj4 said:\n\nHe is professor Ken Brown from Cornell.\n\n.\n\nNot true; the author of mathpages.com is called KEVIN S. Brown, and in happier days his contact information (now very outdated) appeared in his website. Verification of the author's name can be found at websites like http://home.att.net/~numericana/fame/ .\n\n(I can just hear some freshfaced InterNet newbie asking, \"why would the author of a seemingly inoffensive pedagogical website remove his name from it after more than a decade of existence?\" After some thought, and speaking as the author of some seemingly inoffensive pedagogical websites of my own, I would advise members of this forum to decline to speculate about his possible motivations.)\n\nKENNETH S. Brown, known as Ken, the distinguished topologist (well known for his textbook on buildings and other work) on the faculty at Cornell, is someone completely different.\n\nThis no doubt unintentional illustrates the dangers inherent in \"digging\" for the identity of \"anonymized\" authors of material found on the Internet. There are sometimes good reasons (e.g. investigating apparent malfeasance, but probably not mere curiosity) to try to identify a web \"handle\" with a real-life individual, but feel that this should probably be left to experts who have demonstrated good judgement and who are familiar with the use of the appropriate tools.\n\nSomeone suggested that I avoid cluttering up the board by resurrecting very old threads, but perhaps a moderator can \"quietly\" insert a link to this correction?\n\nChris Hillman\n\nHunt? No!\n\nHi, ZapperZ,\n\nZapperZ said:\n\nYes, but which thread is that? Or are you asking me to go hunt for it myself?\n\nI am still a bit of a newbie at PF, so perhaps I don't know how to cite a thread yet, but if you follow the link in my initial post up above, where I quote the mistaken claim by clj4, \"He is professor Ken Brown from Cornell\" (wrong, the author of mathpages.com is named Kevin Brown) you should be taken to the thread in question. At least that's what happens when I try this!\n\nMeJennifer said:\n\nIt looks like it is this one:\n\nhttps://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?p=992409#post992409\"\n\nRight, that's the one I mean. Look for the post by clj4; I was suggesting that a correction be added to that thread by someone with elevated privileges at PF."
