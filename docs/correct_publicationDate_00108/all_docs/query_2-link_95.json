        "text": "There has never been an author who has dominated the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list week after week like Colleen Hoover. Sure, other authors have had multiple titles appear on the best seller list for multiple weeks, but they have all fallen well short of Hoover, who boasted a total of 15 titles in a single week last summer. Three of her books, \"Reminders of Him,\" \"It Ends With Us\" and \"Verity,\" took the No. 1 spot in 2022.\n\nHoover managed to write half of the Top 10 books in sales last year. Over the past 10 years, she has gone from self-published newbie to bestselling powerhouse.\n\nSo just who is Colleen Hoover, and how did she and her novels get so popular?\n\n\"It Starts With Us\" at Bookshop from $16.73\n\n'I'm Glad My Mom Died': How Jennette McCurdy escaped her narcissistic mother's 'excruciating' abuse\n\nWho is Colleen Hoover?\n\nColleen Hoover, 42, lives in a small town in east Texas just outside Sulphur Springs. She worked for several years as a social worker before becoming a counselor at WIC, a nutrition program for women, children and infants. While at WIC, Hoover began to pursue her writing career. She would write on a laptop borrowed from her mother during her off hours, often while one of her sons was at play rehearsals. She gave the novel to her mother as a Christmas gift, and not long after, she self-published it to share with friends and family. \"Slammed\" (2012) would become her first published novel and her first book to appear on USA TODAY's Best-Selling Books list. In total, she has written 22 novels and three novellas, and contributed to two anthologies.\n\nWhat types of books does Colleen Hoover write?\n\nHoover's books fall into new adult and young adult genres. The subject matter varies. For instance, the author's interest in slam poetry heavily influenced \"Slammed.\" Both the \"Slammed\" and the \"Hopeless\" series were inspired by Hoover's social work career.\n\nBut Hoover has explored different genres in her novels. For example, her interest in the paranormal led her to write \"Layla,\" in which the title character survives a life-threatening attack, after which inexplicable things start happening around her. Hoover also has written thrillers and love stories with twists and turns involving heartbreak and mental health struggles.\n\nColleen Hoover: Author dominates best sellers list with 15 books, including 'It Ends With Us'\n\nWhich Colleen Hoover book should you read first?\n\n\"It Ends With Us\" is one of Hoover's most popular and well-received novels, and a good starting point. It has been the highest-ranking novel of Hoover's on the bestsellers list in anticipation of its sequel, \"It Starts With Us,\" which arrives Oct. 18.\n\nMany of Hoover's plot lines involve emotionally intense situations including sexual assault, surviving trauma, infertility and abusive relationships. If you want to start out with something less intense, try \"Maybe Someday.\" For young adult fans, the \"Slammed\" series, \"Regretting You\" and \"Without Merit\" are good choices.\n\nHow did Colleen Hoover's novels become popular?\n\nWhile Hoover has steadily had bestsellers since her debut on USA TODAY's list, her popularity has exploded in the past two years. Her sales surge can be attributed in part to her massive popularity on TikTok, particularly in the platform's #booktok subculture. Publishers Weekly chronicled the phenomenon when Hoover's 2016 book \"It Ends With Us\" started climbing the bestsellers lists in 2020.\n\nFifteen of Hoover's novels are on this week's list; \"It Ends With Us\" tops them all at No. 2. The novel, which has reached No. 1 before, has been on the list for a total of 76 weeks. Her latest novel, \"Reminders of Him,\" now on the list, debuted at No. 1 in January.\n\nPurchases you make through our links may earn us and our publishing partners a commission."
