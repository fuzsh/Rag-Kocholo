Salinger, Kurt Vonnegut, E.L. Doctorow, Margaret Atwood, E.B White, Richard Price and Kazuo Ishiguro.\n\nIn the aftermath of his father’s death.

It was written in the evenings to fit around careers in warehousing and law school.\n\nSachar practised part-time legal work for 9 years after graduating law school in 1980: it wasn’t until 1989 that sales of his books allowed him to pursue a single-minded writing career!\n\nSachar writes every morning of the week, although does so for typically no more than 2 hours a day.\n\nWhile working on a book, Louis Sachar never discusses his in-progress writing, not even with family or his editor!\n\nSachar is a keen bridge player, frequently entering tournaments.\n\nIf you’re a fan of Louis Sachar and his works, it might interest you to know that a production of his most well-known work, Holes, is upcoming at The Grand Theatre, Blackpool.
