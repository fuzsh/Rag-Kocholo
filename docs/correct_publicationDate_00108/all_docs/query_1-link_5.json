        "text": "Thomas M. Disch is known by many as the author of the satirical science fiction novel, On Wings of Song, (1979) and the beloved childrenâs book The Brave Little Toaster (1980), as well as 16 other novels, five novellas, eight story collections, four other childrenâs books, 12 poetry collections, four works of non-fiction, five anthologies, two plays, two audio worksââand one computer game. It is that computer game, Amnesia, that continues to draw a large following of devoted gamers, media critics, and born-digital writers to Dischâs work. It was published by Electronic Arts in 1986 for the Apple IIe, Commodore 64, and IBM PC computers.\n\nDisch was born in Iowa but spent some of his childhood in Minnesota. At 17 he moved to New York City and immersed himself in the arts. His love of this city is evident in the care he took to map it so precisely in Amnesia. During his lifetime, he served in the Army, worked odd jobs to survive, and eventually was able to make a living by his writing in his adopted city where he lived with his long-time partner, the poet Charles Naylor, until Naylorâs death in 2005. Disch died in 2008 at the age of 68, leaving behind a large body of work and one of the most famous commercially published computer games."
