The person(s) who wrote the press release. (Objection: that is often undisclosed. And when a name is mentioned, it is often an editor rather than the actual author, who is often an unnamed freelance ghostwriter.)\n\n2. The Institution. Example: Harvard University. (Objection: The institution belongs in the \"Website Title\" field instead.)\n\n3. The name of the press department? Example: \"Office of Public and Media Relations\". (Objection: that may look strange for in-text citations).\n\nHabits, opinions, objections, etc. are welcome!"
