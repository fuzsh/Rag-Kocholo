        "text": "Michael Carlson writes ... It seems somehow fitting that Tom Disch would choose Independence Day, America's biggest holiday, to put an end to his own life. This prodigiously talented writer was always just outside the mainstream of American success, something which seemed to increasingly weigh upon him. His intelligence and self-taught erudition meant his best SF work was often too coldly intellectual for its audience, while remaining too effective as SF to please the mainstream. Poetry, perhaps his greatest love, was cruel in providing a living only for teachers.\n\nOddly, I first met Tom in 1975 on a Trailways bus, on which we were both going to Middletown, Connecticut, to teach summer courses at Wesleyan University. I'm not sure how I intuited that the guy in the Hawaiian shirt with the tattooed arms, looking exactly like a sailor on shore leave, was the writer of 334 and Camp Concentration, which my young critical mind considered two of the best SF novels ever written. Like his writing, he was never quite what one expected.\n\nHe was, however, hugely entertaining, with a cutting cynical wit that often flew over people's heads, including mine. I showed him a poem with which I was particularly pleased, and he gushed, \"there's not a false word in it\". Maybe a year later I realised with a start that he'd been damning me with very faint praise indeed.\n\nHe could also be kind. When I moved to London, Tom was already here, and one night at dinner he and Charlie listened to John Sutherland praising a pastiche Victorian novel called Clara Reeve, written by Leonie Hargrove. Hargrove, of course, was Tom and Charlie, but they repaid the compliment by praising a book of Victorian criticism that John turned out to have written. It occurred to me that Tom knew full well who the author of that book had been.\n\nHis two studies of modern American poetry, The Castle of Indolence and The Castle of Perserverance, were a modern Dunciad, with Tom as our Alexander Pope, and virtually the whole of the poetry world as Colley Cibbers. His criticism, particularly his theatre column in the Nation and book reviews for Entertainment Weekly, was sharp and vivid. But his later novels, often dismissed as horror, or praised as satire, were at heart modern gothics, transmuting the subconscious fears of Victorians that surfaced in that genre, into the modern fears of middle America. Those included the Catholic church: Tom's theatrical monologue The Cardinal Detoxes (1990) attracted the wrath of the New York archdiocese, which probably made his novel The Priest (1994) all the more virulent as a result.\n\nI'd lost touch with Tom, but noted how his writing changed in recent years. He stopped submitting poetry, posting it on a blog alongside chat of less than witty bile. He called it Endzone, a last piece of self-aware wit from a writer whose genius already awaits inevitable rediscovery."
