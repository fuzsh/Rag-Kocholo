        "text": "A Writer’s Life\n\nAs the school librarian and a teacher who is keenly interested in literacy, I want my students to think of themselves as writers. Real writers. Why? Because writers write, and when we do, we think. To write is to explore worlds, both those within and those that surround us. Writing is rigor. “Real” writers know that, and when they talk to students they share that message. When students hang out with writers, they see themselves as a part of a writing community, and that leads them to think of themselves as real writers too.\n\nPreparing for a Visit\n\nThis year we visited with authors of fiction and nonfiction, picture books and novels, from places near and far. Preparation was simple and fruitful in and of itself. If a student wanted a visit with an author, they only had to do one thing—read one of the author’s books. For most, the excitement of knowing they would meet the author and be allowed to ask her or him questions drove students to read several books. For some, it meant reading every single book written by the author.\n\nOften, I would also ask students to write questions they might like to ask the author before the visit. Students asked an array of questions, everything from the expected “How do you get your ideas?” and “How long does it take to write a book?” to the career-oriented “Can you make enough money as a writer?” to the poignant “Do you think your stories help kids deal with tough times?”\n\nInviting an Author to Your School\n\nFinding authors is usually easy. Even a simple Google search will yield results—an email address or Twitter handle, for example. I’ve had good luck finding visitors on the Skype in the Classroom site and through the blog of author Kate Messner.\n\nAbout half of the authors I’ve worked with ask for remuneration for Skype visits, anywhere from $50 for an hour to $350. The other half offer free Skype visits for 15 to 30 minutes. Most authors have been willing to work with me if I didn’t have the funding. Some do advance sales; others ask me to send order forms home with the kids after the free or reduced cost visit.\n\nSome of our favorites included:"
