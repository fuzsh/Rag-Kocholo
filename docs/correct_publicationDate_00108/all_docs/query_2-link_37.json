        "text": "Most Americans today would say \"I an a writer\" not \"I am an author.\" Writing organizations are called things like \"The Science-Fiction Writers Association\" not \"The Science Fiction Authors Association.\" You can say either one, but \"author\" sounds old-fashioned. On the other hand, we say \"author of\" for a specific work and \"writer of\" for a genre. For example:\n\n\"Is Jack a writer?\"\n\n\"Yes, he's the author of 'Death on Alpha Centauri.'\"\n\n\"Is he a writer of science fiction?\"\n\n\"Yes, and mysteries too.\"\n\nIf someone dictated a book, they would be the Author, but not a \"writer\". There are also other phrases where \"author\" is not to do with writing, like \"author of your own destiny\". So, I think that authoring is more about creating, whereas writer is about... writing.\n\n\"Author\" also implies a published work. Writer implies very little. I have been writing since I was able to, but nothing published yet.\n\nYou are author of something. 'Author' is not an absolute word, it needn't indicate profession. It demands object after it. 'Writer,' whereas, is a professional. It's an absolute word. You may not mention anything else along with it.\n\nCharles Dickens was a writer. He has authored many books.\n\nThe word 'author' can be used for a non-writer as well. I am the author of my project assignment."
