Disch, who has been called one of the most important science fiction writers of his generation, died Saturday in New York.\n\nFriends said Disch, 68, who grew up in Minnesota, was found dead inside his apartment. He had fatally shot himself, according to authorities.\n\nIn the genre of science fiction, Disch was considered unconventional.\n\nThe strange new worlds he created were an odd mix: dark and horror-filled, humorous and playful. His “New Wave” work outfoxed readers’ expectations, one critic said, and made labeling a chore for publishers.\n\nBut being outside the box was a Disch trademark.\n\n“Tom Disch is one of the few people I have ever met who I would consider a genius,” said Dana Gioia, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nDisch also wrote poetry, drama criticism, book reviews, opera libretti, a computer interactive novel, plays and children’s books.\n\nThough he never won mainstream fame, Disch was highly regarded in the world of science fiction. Three of his novels, “Camp Concentration,” “334,” and “On Wings of Songs,” were named in “Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels,” a survey by critic David Pringle.\n\nBorn in Des Moines, Iowa, Disch was raised in Minneapolis. He was homely, gawky, shy, and felt different because he was an intellectual.\n\nAfter high school, he worked odd jobs and attended college in New York. In 1962, after the magazine “Fantastic Stories” published one of his short stories, Disch left school to write.\n\nHis first novel, “The Genocides,” was published in 1965. The story told of the last days of human existence and of aliens who wipe out humans the way humans kill insects in a garden.\n\nProlific and diverse in his literary output, Disch was also the author of “The Brave Little Toaster,” a children’s book, which was made into an animated film by Disney, and “Amnesia,” an interactive computer novel.\n\nEarlier in June, his satire “The Word of God: Or, Holy Writ Rewritten” was released.\n\nIn recent years, Disch suffered a series of problems. His partner, Charles Naylor, died; health and financial issues ensued; and Disch battled to remain in his apartment.\n\n— Los Angeles Times\n\nOriginally Published: July 7, 2008 at 11:01 p.m."
