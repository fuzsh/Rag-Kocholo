        "text": "Ameritech New Zealand Funding Corp. has challenged the reduction of its foreign tax credit from $69,075,951 to $69,007,613 and the denial of an additional FTC for taxes paid under a settlement with the New Zealand Inland Revenue.\n\nAmeritech New Zealand states that it is a subsidiary of Ameritech Corp. and that prior to September 24, 1994, it was included in the consolidated group of its parent. Ameritech New Zealand states that it filed a separate return for the taxable period from September 30, 1994, to December 31, 1994, and properly claimed a foreign tax credit that should have been allowed in full. Ameritech New Zealand further insists that it was entitled to an additional FTC for a $35,021 tax settlement it paid to the New Zealand Inland Revenue.\n\nUNITED STATES TAX COURT\n\nPETITION\n\nAmeritech New Zealand Funding Corporation hereby petitions for a redetermination of the deficiency set forth by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in the Notice of Deficiency dated September 15, 2000, and as the basis for its case alleges as follows:\n\n1. Ameritech New Zealand Funding Corporation (hereinafter referred to as \"Petitioner\") is a Delaware corporation with its principal office at 30 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606. Petitioner's Employer Identification Number is [TIN omitted]. The return for the period here involved, the taxable period ended December 31, 1994, was filed with the Internal Revenue Service at Kansas City, Missouri. Petitioner for the above taxable period maintained its books and filed its federal income tax returns on an accrual basis.\n\n2. The Notice of Deficiency for the taxable period ended December 31, 1994, dated September 15, 2000, was issued by the Office of the District Director, Internal Revenue Service, at Chicago, Illinois. A copy of the Notice of Deficiency is attached hereto as Exhibit A.\n\n3. The Commissioner determined a deficiency in Petitioner's income tax for the taxable period ended December 31, 1994 in the amount of $68,338. Petitioner disputes the foregoing determined deficiency. In addition, Petitioner claims all overpayments specifically alleged herein and all other overpayments which are allowable under the provisions of I.R.C. section 6512.\n\n4. The determinations of tax set forth in the Commissioner's Notice of Deficiency are based upon the following errors:\n\n(a) FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYOVER.\n\nThe Commissioner erred in reducing Petitioner's foreign tax credit from $69,075,951 to $69,007,613. As a result of this erroneous determination, the Commissioner erroneously increased Petitioner's income tax liability for the taxable period ended December 31, 1994 by the amount of $68,338.\n\n(b) NEW ZEALAND TAX SETTLEMENT.\n\nThe Commissioner erred in failing to determine that Petitioner is allowed an additional foreign tax credit for the taxable period ended December 31, 1994 for New Zealand taxes paid pursuant to a settlement with the New Zealand Inland Revenue. As of result of this failure, the Commissioner erroneously failed to decrease Petitioner's income tax by $35,021.\n\n5. The facts relating to the errors in Part 4 are as follows:\n\n(a) FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYOVER.\n\n(i) Prior to September 30, 1994, Petitioner was included in the consolidated group of its parent, Ameritech Corporation (Employer Identification Number [TIN omitted].\n\n(ii) Petitioner filed a separate return for the taxable period from September 30, 1994 to December 31, 1994.\n\n(iii) Petitioner properly claimed a foreign tax credit of $69,075,951 against its income tax liability for the taxable period ended December 31, 1994.\n\n(iv) In computing its foreign tax credit, Petitioner properly claimed a foreign tax credit carryover in the amount of $24,636,706.\n\n(v) The Commissioner has reduced Petitioner's foreign tax credit for the taxable period ended December 31, 1994 from $69,075,951 to $69,007,613.\n\n(vi) According to the Revenue Agent's Report, the Commissioner's reduction to Petitioner's foreign tax credit is the result of the disallowance of Petitioner's foreign tax credit carryover, which carryover the Commissioner has disallowed because, as of the date of the Commissioner's issuance of the Notice of Deficiency, the Commissioner had not completed the examination of the 1993 consolidated income tax return of Ameritech Corporation and Subsidiaries.\n\n(vii) Petitioner does not agree with the Commissioner's position that Petitioner is not entitled to its claimed foreign tax credit of $69,075,951.\n\n(b) NEW ZEALAND TAX SETTLEMENT.\n\n(i) In 1991 and 1993, Ameritech Holdings Limited, a New Zealand corporation which was 21 percent owned by Petitioner, sold shares it held in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand, Ltd. Ameritech Holdings Limited took the position for New Zealand tax purposes that realized profits on the sales of the shares were not taxable. The New Zealand Inland Revenue challenged this position.\n\n(ii) On July 24, 1998, a settlement was reached with the New Zealand Inland Revenue on the above issue. The settlement agreement allocated additional New Zealand tax liability to several tax periods, including calendar year 1994, which period was affected due to New Zealand tax allocations and carryforwards. The agreed New Zealand tax deficiency for 1994 was NZ$68,374 ($35,021 in U.S. Dollars) , which was paid on July 27, 1998.\n\n(iii) As a result of the above settlement, Petitioner is entitled to an additional foreign tax credit of $35,021 for the taxable period ended December 31, 1994.\n\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner prays that this Court hear this case and determine that:\n\n1. There is no deficiency in income tax due from Petitioner for the taxable period ended December 31, 1994;\n\n2. There is an overpayment in Petitioner's income tax for the foregoing year in such amount as the Court may find;\n\n3. Petitioner is entitled to all correlative adjustments allowable by operation of law;\n\n4. Petitioner is entitled to the correction of any mathematical, mechanical, computational and typographical errors in the Notice of Deficiency; and\n\n5. Petitioner is entitled to such other and further relief as the Court may deem appropriate.\n\nDated: December 12, 2000\n\nCounsel for Petitioner ADMITTED U. S. TAX COURT Robert F.
