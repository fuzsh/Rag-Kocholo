        "meta_description": "Ameritech was created as a holding company that owned five former Bell System companies in the Midwest. Under its umbrella were: Illinois Bell Telephone Company Indiana Bell Telephone Company, Inc. Michigan Bell Telephone Company Ohio Bell Telephone Company Wisconsin Bell, Inc. For Ameritech's first nine years, it maintained these Bell brands inherited from the Bell System - though public displays of the Bell companies' names were often captioned \"An Ameritech Company\". In January 1993, Ameritech officially retired the Bell brands and marketed itself with solely the Ameritech name across all five states in its territory.",
