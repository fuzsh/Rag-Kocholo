The company poised to become the largest local telephone company in the United States has gained a toehold in Canada. Chicago-based Ameritech Corporation is investing $5.1 billion to take a 20 per cent stake in BCE unit Bell Canada.

The agreement, announced Wednesday, has received approval from the boards of both companies and is expected to close by the end of May, pending regulatory approval.

"This partnership assures Bell Canada's place at the forefront of the global communications industry while keeping Bell Canada firmly under Canadian control," said BCE President and Chief Executive Jean Monty in a statement.

Monty added that BCE, Canada's most widely held company, would use the proceeds from the deal to invest in high-growth sectors such as electronic commerce, satellite services, systems integration and content.

Bell Canada is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BCE and, as part of the deal, is being reorganized to hold certain telecommunications assets previously held by BCE.

Bell Canada will acquire from BCE:

65 per cent of BCE Mobile Communications Inc., a wireless company with 2 million customers

21.5 per cent of Teleglobe Inc., a provider of international telecommunications services

BCE's equity stake in six of Canada's regional telecom companies, three of which are merging into a single entity known as AtlanticCo.

BCE will retain 80 per cent ownership of Bell Canada.

Ameritech is one of the world's 100 largest companies. It has 70,500 employees and more than $30 billion US in assets. The company has a wide-range of communications services including local and long-distance telephone and data, cellular, paging, security, cable TV and Internet.

Ameritech received Tuesday regulatory approval from the U.S. Justice Department to merge with SBC Communications in a $57-billion US deal which will create the largest local telephone company in the U.S.
