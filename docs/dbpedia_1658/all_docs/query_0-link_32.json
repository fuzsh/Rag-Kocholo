        "meta_description": "Sotahuuto by Horna, released 06 November 2007\n\n1. Lähtölaukaus\n2. Vapise, Vapahtaja\n3. Verimalja\n4. Tuhontuoja\n5. Sodanjano\n6. Ukkosmarssi\n7. Sotahuuto\n8. Vihanlietsoja\n9. Tulikäsky\n\nOnce again, the HORNA horde paves black metal’s future by recasting its past in their own, none-more-ugly light! Sotahuuto is the Finnish underground legends’ deliberate tribute to BM pioneers Bathory: Each song built around riffs strongly reminiscent of Bathory’s self-titled debut album, while kicking into the caustic, epic blackthrash of Horna’s earliest years. Easily one of the rawest, filthiest records ever!\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESS:\r\n“HORNA is the kind of howling Satanic whirlwind that would scare the shit out of the TV from Poltergeist.” - REVOLVER\r\n“...Judgment Day is coming, people, and this album is proof&quot; - digitalmetal.com\r\n\r\n\r\n* New studio album from the leading Finnish Black Metal act!\r\n* Tribute to Black Metal pioneers Bathory!\r\n* Features a grim production from Boneyard Studios (Sargeist, Baptism)!\r\n* War torn cover art sure to appease the discriminating Black Metal fan\r\n* Features Shatraug of popular Black Metal act SARGEIST!\r\n* Mandatory for fans of Dark Throne, Sargeist, Leviathan, Bathory and Satyricon.\r\n\r\nFOR ALL PHYSICAL FORMATS, EXCEPT FOR BANDCAMP EXCLUSIVES, PLEASE VISIT OUR WEBSTORE!",
