        "text": "Possibly one of the most unsung heroes of the black metal scene worldwide Finland’s Horna has an envious release rate not only in terms of quantity but also quality for over 20 years. This is the bands ninth full length release all of which are cemented together by a prolific set of EPs and splits over those. Granted Shatraug is the sole creative genius left from the original line up and is a permanent fixture within a multitude of black metal bands both former and currently. With three splits splicing the last full length and this one over the last two years Horna is a band that personifies the spirit of underground extreme metal enthusiasm.\n\nMy first attraction to Horna was plain and simply due to their logo which I think is magnificent and epitomises what Horna are about, in your face black metal Satanism that is demonic, evil and palpably terrifying in all departments. The ninth full length kicks off with “Amadriada” and for a change within black metal not a single note of an intro as this blisters into action like a vat of sulphuric acid thrown in your face. Production wise a claustrophobic ethos is felt, that creates tension and a truly oppressive cloying atmosphere like your soul is being sliced into slivers. Much of Horna’s work has that old school black metal approach and dare I say more than a hint of crust and punk ideology when the tunes delve into a grimier slower style. A shuddering malevolence is ingrained into the vocals as an immense riff break is unceremoniously flung at the listener before the rancorous blast is initiated on “Ajan Päättyessä” and contrasts heavily with the much slower approach of “Nekromantia” which possesses a funereal atmosphere where despair and anguish slide creepily into your psyche.\n\n“Saatanalle” is slightly longer and continues the theme of nihilistic terror and comes across as a black thrash tune partially as layers of malfeasance are etched into the tune alongside and unremitting blast. The riff break is outstanding and spattered with anarchic cymbal smashing for added emphasis and contrasts with the eerie start of “Puhdas” which listens like an old horror movie with church organ styling for that air of anticipatory occultism which announces itself like a nail bomb when the song nails its spiteful riff. Aggressive and melodic the track typifies the bands vitriolic style and even when the tune breaks for a bass line that too is steeped in coursing black potency.\n\n“Sodan Roihu” has a punk feel due to the gritty guitar riff and almost sleazy drum beat that is deployed making the tune melodic but still reeking of stench ridden malignancy. The percussive elements which maybe just drums and cymbals are intrinsic to the songs attitude and make this one of my favourite tracks on the album, brilliance doesn’t always come in the form of riffs. Closing this slab of hostile sonic noxiousness is “Profeettasi” which begins with that crust styled beat before exploding with a blast that will rip your face off. Horna is one of those bands that keeps it relatively simple but continually record some of the most pernicious black metal you’ll ever hear in the period of your pitiful existence on this planet.\n\n(9/10 Martin Harris)\n\nhttp://horna666.com"
