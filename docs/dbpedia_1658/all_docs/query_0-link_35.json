Simply put, their vision of unapologetic black metal is proud and pure, and played with an intensity and finesse that's familiar yet unique.",

        "text": "HORNA - Presents Track From Upcoming Album\n\nDetails\n\nPublished on Monday, 09 November 2020 15:44\n\nWritten by Tomaz\n\nFinnish black metal legends Horna premiered online the brand new track \"Haudattujen Tähtien Yönä\". The track is taken from the band's highly anticipated tenth album, Kuoleman Kirjo, set for international release on 8th December via W.T.C. Productions.\n\nHorna should need no introduction. For over 25 years now, the Finnish black metal institution - founded by uber-prolific guitarist/songwriter Shatraug (Sargeist, Behexen,...) - have built a vast, virulent body of work beyond compare. In fact, when one mentions \"Finnish black metal\" nowadays, the name Horna is immediately invoked...and for good reason. Simply put, their vision of unapologetic black metal is proud and pure, and played with an intensity and finesse that's familiar yet unique.\n\nThe new album Kuoleman Kirjo can be compared to early Horna touchstones as Kohti Yhdeksän Nousua and especially Haudankylmyyden Mailla, but in a more streamlined form - and one more asskicking, as per this line-up's utterly tyrannical stature onstage. The past is alive because the present is dead; there is no future. Horna thus continue to stand immortal, and Kuoleman Kirjo is the only firmament on the foreseeable horizon. Listen now to \"Haudattujen Tähtien Yönä\" in the player below, as well you can give a listen to previously unveiled \"Saatanan Viha\". Link"
