It´s cool!)\n\nAjattara (of the Amorphis-Singer)\n\nHorna (Black Metal)\n\nIsmo Alanko (Pop/Rock, an institution over all the years, really cool guy)\n\nZen Cafe\n\n...have to think about more, but there are truckloads of. Then I`ll edit this post.\n\nagree on Viikate\n\nLolita Vampiriá said:\n\nwhat's the name of their latest radio hit? i think i've heard it and loved it but without the title i can't dload a thing...\n\nand please do recommend your friends' bands' songs too, as long as they're available somewhere\n\nM'kay kind sir.\n\nKotiteollisuus for example Minä olen (their latest radio hit single).\n\nTry this if you will:\n\nwww.tajuvana.com -> musiikki -> there are some stuff downloadable. (And the pages are apparently in English too.)\n\nSimo has just joined in Tajuvana as their new bassist (it's not official news yet but.. )\n\nThe closer thing i could think off is a former local band called Nightshades ( thast with an s at the end ). They lyrics where in english but it was a melodic black/death with songs about aztec culture writted in a really cool way. Music was good too but they started to be lacking ( no new songs for years at the time, and then only 1 new song, basically after several years of literally the same old songs, they effectively alienated everyone ) and other problems lead to their downfall."
