        "text": "When it comes to Finnish black metal Horna is a household name and probably the biggest black metal band the country have ever produced. Not only are they one of the oldest bands going but they have released a shitload of albums during the years, with most being of very high quality! While it wasn’t long ago we got some Horna music as they released a split with Pure two years ago, it’s been five years since their last full-length album Hengen Tulet which received some mixed criticism but was at it’s peaks a very good album. I personally think Hengen Tulet was one of the better albums they’ve produced and it was only the mix that was a bit off to my ears. That’s the funny thing with Horna though, they do switch it up a bit with many of their releases and you will see a lot of fans have different favorites when it comes to the bands discography. With Kuoleman Kirjo I hope we get more of that pure dark and evil black metal we all know Horna can do.\n\nWhen an album clocks in on over an hour long warning bells actually rings to me. Why? Simply due to the fact that’s a lot of time to keep ones interest going when it comes to music and it usually means fillers (which is why I loose interest). When it comes to Kuoleman Kirjo I have to say Horna does a great effort on giving the listener a varied enough album, where the riffs are actually some of the best I’ve heard on a Horna album, yet keeping the core sound intact throughout the album and you sit there slowly headbanging from start to finish. No fillers here folks! The ice cold atmosphere and pure evil Horna is all about oozes from this release as it has a much better mix than their last effort, really giving the guitars the space it deserves, and a Horna hungry to put the world onto a veil of darkness once again.\n\nWhile it’s hard to beat what I personally think is their best album so far Sanojesi Äärelle Horna means business with Kuoleman Kirjo and I can honestly say this is one of their best albums to date, where only Envaatnags Eflos Solf Esgantaavne and of course Sanojesi Äärelle beats it when I write this. Of course I’ve only had a weeks time to get acquainted with Kuoleman Kirjo but during that week I’ve only come to like the album more and more. This is Horna with some fresh blood amongst their ranks, which seems to have reinvigorated the band as they’ve made their best album in over ten years (which says a lot seeing how many good album they’ve released during those years). They’ve somewhat gone back more to their roots when crafting this occult ritual and it has done them a huge favour. Personal favorites “Saatanan Viha”, “Elegia” or “Mustat Vuodet” are pure black metal gold that you need to hear, but honestly the whole album kicks some serious ass which is a most listen to black metal fans around the world.\n\nArtist: Horna\n\nLabel: W.T.C. Productions\n\nRelease date: December 8th, 2020\n\nFavorite track: Mustat Vuodet\n\nFor fans of: Sargeist & Satanic Warmaster\n\nScore: 4/5 Excellent\n\nHorna\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HornaOfficial\n\nW.T.C. Productions\n\nhttp://www.w-t-c.org/\n\nhttps://wtcproductions.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/W.T.C.Productions\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/w.t.c.productions/\n\nFinland and black metal goes hand in hand that much is certain. Their love for the occult and satanism has been known far and wide with bands such as Beherit, Horna and Baptism leading the way for many years. Enter the new blood, a band who will carry the torch, Aethyrick. Formed by Gall and Exile on the winter solstice of 2016 the band has been quite productive in spreading their ways of the occult to the masses with two demo albums and a full-length released prior to their latest offering Gnosis.\n\nWith great songwriting and incredible guitar play Gnosis gets me hook, line and sinker already on the first track “Will Embodied”. It’s mesmerizing and hauntingly beautiful. It’s basically a lovesong where Finnish black metal meets the Icelandic counterpart and the end result is wonderful. The follow-up “Oneiric Portals” keeps the same quality and mysticism flair to it just as well. Then the third song “Stellar Flash” changes it up with more synths and change of vocal sounds, being even more of the shrieking kind a la Ghost Bath. I personally wasn’t a big fan of this and the vocals put me off quite a bit, as did the synths where I thought they overused here. It quickly put itself back up though when “Your Mysteries” comes on where once again the melodic guitar tone shines brightly pushing the album forward. “Blood Acre” then crushes everything where the introduction of a killer guitar solo sets the pace and never let you go. The atmosphere, energy and emotions here is exactly what I hope Aethyrick brings on each song. The closing songs “Anointed Bones” and “Golden Suffering” are great additions that follows it up well as the album ends on a high note. In fact I would say the last three songs on the album stands out from the rest and if you’re in a rush I would say pick one of those three songs to see if Aethyrick is for you.\n\nWhile I thought Praxis was a solid debut Aethyrick takes it to a whole new level with Gnosis. Not only with the songwriting but the guitar tone is a massive improvement to me, the use of keyboards is better utilized too, as is the production. Hell I might just say everything has turned to the better (except me not liking “Stellar Flash”), it’s simply a matter of a band that’s taken these two years to jell together as a duo and work hard to reach their goals and it shows. There are still things to work on but they’ve used the time wisely and if Aethyrick keeps this up the more seasoned bands from Finland will have to watch out because there is a new sinister flame coming in hot.\n\nArtist: Aethyrick\n\nLabel: The Sinister Flame\n\nFor fans of: Cult of Fire & Svartidauði\n\nRelease date: January 24th, 2020\n\nFavorite song: Blood Acre\n\nScore: 4/5 Excellent\n\nFresh from the pits of hell Svartsyn are back to bring darkness onto the world of the living. For the Swedish black metal scene Svartsyn has been one of the cult bands that you know always deliver sinister mid paced, traditional black metal that we all love. Originally named Chalice and formed in 1991 it’s one of the oldest bands still going with In Death being the bands 9th full-length release. Something very few bands can be proud of. That being said it’s quite hard to fathom that Svartsyn are not known by a wider audience than they are today. Not only due to the amount of albums they’ve released but because they’ve been such an influential band.\n\nWhat you will notice from the get go is that fans of Svartsyn will feel right at home here. It’s just as brutal and devastating as ever, exactly what underground black metal is about. The song-writing is on point with In Death reeking of… you guessed it death, Satanism and darkness. Fans of the purest of Swedish black metal will definitely have a great time with In Death as it captures some of the best moments in Svartsyn’s vast discography and a lot of similarity with other Swedish black metal legends Ondskapt, Arckanum, Ofermod and Craft can be heard during the album.\n\nMy favorite tracks from the album are Dark Prophet, Black Thrones of Death and Exile in Death. Be sure to get In Death and support one of Swedens best underground black metal acts. In Death is out now through Agonia Records.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/svartsyn666\n\nLabel: Agonia Records\n\nFor fans of: Ondskapt and Arckanum\n\nFavorite song: Exile in Death\n\nNow this is the definition of a supergroup if I’ve ever seen one. Or what about this; AntiChristian (Tsjuder) on drums, Doedsadmiral (Nordjevel and Svartelder) on vocals and Shatraug (Horna, Sargeist and ex-Behexen) on guitar and bass. That’s representing some of Finlands and Norways biggest black metal acts of all time. Created 2014 Doedsvangr has obviously had a lot of hype surrounding them to see what beast they would spawn, and now the time is finally here. Satan ov Suns is the bands debut album and black metal fans all over the world be vary, this is some evil shit.\n\nFans of old school black metal such as Tsjuder, Behexen and Horna will find themselves right at home in this dark pit, as expected seeing the bands origin. Doedsadmiral is putting up yet another amazing vocal performance and he is surely one of the rising stars in the black metal scene. Veterans Shatraug and AntiChristian do what’s in all honesty expected from men of their calibre, a great display of skills by some of the best musicians in the world. If you wonder what the lyrical theme is it’s Satanism and everything around the occult. If there is one thing this trio can do extra well it’s spreading the darkness and evilness through music.\n\nIt’s quite hard to review an album made by some of the best musicians I know. For one I have insanely high expectations. When they actually live up to those expectations I find it hard to praise it as much as I should. Because it’s what I expect and I am not actually surprised a band featuring members of this level pulling this off. If it was a debut album from a band with new talent I would say this is the best debut of the year already showing itself. Now I am left here telling you this is a supergroup doing what’s expected of them, delivering an album of fierce satanic art that you need.\n\nDoedsvangr’s debut Satan ov Suns is out now through Immortal Frost Productions.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/pg/doedsvangrofficial\n\nFor fans of: Tsjuder and Behexen\n\nFavorite song: Diaboli\n\nAuthor is a name many of you might not have heard. I personally didn’t know about the band until I saw the name on last years Mörkaste Småland (black metal festival in Sweden) lineup. Back then the solo project of J.V. had one EP on it’s name, Kuolevaisen kirous, which did receive a lot of praise for it’s old school black metal sound in the veins of Finnish legends like Horna, Sargeist, Horna and Beherit. Now the time is upon us to hear the sacrifice to hells forces, Lopun Alku.\n\nWhen listening to Lopun Alku it takes me back to the 90’s. This is an homage to the lo-fi dirty sound that became black metal. It’s raw, hellish sound is something I sometimes miss and for many is a forgotten craft. You got the shrieks, blast beats and straight up black metal the way us old timers (if I can call myself that, not turned 30 just yet) remembers it. The songs build up, changing tempo when needed and makes the songs feel alive all the way through without losing it’s deadly edge. J.V. does have a knack for creating an atmosphere clouded in darkness and death I rarely see in new acts these days since most bands aren’t after that old school sound. I am sure the guys from Horna will be proud as this is a new Finnish wave continuing their legacy.\n\nIf you missed Author’s first EP Kuolevaisen kirous then make no mistake and get Lopun Alku. Good old school black metal is becoming a rarity these days so when it actually comes you make sure to support it. Lopun Alku is out now through Naturmacht Productions.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/AuthorOfficial\n\nFor fans of: Sargeist and Horna\n\nFavorite song: Lopun Alku"
