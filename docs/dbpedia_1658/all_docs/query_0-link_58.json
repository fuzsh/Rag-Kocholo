        "text": "I actually never tried to get into Horna. I've heard good things about them, like they get their shows shut down much in the same way that Marduk and Watain do, but I can't verify whether this is true or not so I haven't started buying their merch or vinyl yet.\n\nBasically, my M.O. is that if a band is getting their shows shut down by wuss activists, that I want to buy their stuff before it gets to the point where it's outright banned and is impossible to get my hands on. I don't believe that anyone has any right to be telling me what music I am allowed to buy or what shows I am allowed to pay to attend. I would like to go to Europe so that I can see some of these bands perform live, but the chances of that actually happening are slim to none because I don't think I'm actually ever going to be allowed to leave the US.\n\nCall me kooky but wouldn't it make a lot more sense to just buy the music you like the best and know you'll want to listen to? Instead of collecting expensive vinyl from bands you might not even like just because you heard they might be controversial? Buying a band's music solely based on the fact that other people you don't even know may have a problem with them is about the dumbest thing I've ever heard. And dreams of going to Europe to see bands you don't know simply to defy \"wuss activists?\" I'm beginning to think you're trolling us.\n\n6 hours ago, GoatmasterGeneral said:\n\nInstead of collecting expensive vinyl from bands you might not even like just because you heard they might be controversial?\n\nI actually buy and resell vinyl though, and controversial bands are always good to have because they're hard to find in a lot of shops because people cave to wuss activists. Problem is usually the stuff I buy lately I've ended up liking and keeping for my personal collection, so I haven't sold anything in about two weeks. I did at one time, sell a lot of the stuff I bought from Hell's Headbangers and IFB records even though I liked it and now I regret that because some of these albums were color vinyl and I realized in retrospect that I missed them.\n\nSee the thing is, when someone tries to tell me that I am \"not allowed\" to have something or listen to, watch, read, it... it makes me want to do so that much more & that stems from my childhood when tools like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson were trying to get Deicide, Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, and even Marilyn Manson banned for being \"occult\". When an obnoxious preacher would come out against a video game or a band, I knew immediately that I had to have that CD or video game and it's kind of the same way now: when people I do not respect try to get a band's shows shut down or have their music banned, it just makes me that much more resolved to get that item because I'm being told that I \"can't\" have it & \"shouldn't\" listen to it.\n\nI've found a lot of bands that I actually like this way. Watain was one of them; people complained about their live shows and protested them, so that just tells me \"I've got to check them out if these people don't like them\" and surprise surprise, I ended up really liking Watain."
