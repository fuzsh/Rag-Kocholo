        "text": "Claudia Lee Horna is a violinist and media (film, TV and video game) composer. She attended the acclaimed Berklee College of Music with a scholarship and recently graduated with a degree in Film Scoring and a minor in American Roots Music.\n\nHailing from Peru, Claudia began her musical journey on the violin at a young age. She studied in the Youth Program of the Conservatorio Nacional de Lima, building a strong orchestral and classical foundation. In tandem, she grew passionate about stories told through the animated medium, leading her to discover film and video game music and pursue a career in media composing.\n\nDuring her time at Berklee, Claudia cultivated skills in numerous musical genres, both as a performer and composer. She studied under renowned violinists Bruce Molsky, Jason Anick and Grammy nominee Sara Caswell; and film composers such as Emmy nominated Sheldon Mirowitz, Grammy Award winner Claudio Ragazzi and Emmy Award winner Mason Daring.\n\nWhether it is helping them develop their creative side through improvisation or improving their music theory skills, I like to be encouraging towards my students and guide them towards improving their skills and creativity. My teaching style varies between each student, as I like to work with each individual to develop a lesson plan that will suit both their needs and interests."
