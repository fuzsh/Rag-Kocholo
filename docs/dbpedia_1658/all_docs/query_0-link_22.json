        "text": "Hails. I'm very pleased to make you some questions after this excellent album you've just released entitled “Ääniä Yössä”. Are you ready for the interrogation?\n\nHails! Ready as can be...\n\nHorna is alive since 1995, if I'm not wrong, and you've just released your sixth album, without counting a lot of demos, splits and EP's, even a live album, so, how do you feel after all these time?\n\nI am still a possessed fucker, still worship the darkness and Satan. All couldn’t be better for many things...\n\n'Ääniä Yössä' is the title of your new full length album, which has the particularity of having been recorded only by you and Corvus during year 2004. Can you explain us why did you do it like that and why the album was recorded in two sessions in the beginning and end of that year?\n\nThe album was not planned to be a Horna release at all so it was just two different recordings with an idea to use for some project perhaps. In the end when time had passed we decided to take the songs for Horna after all and that was a good decision. It became one of the bleakest and most depressive albums Horna has.\n\nThe concept of this recording is about the “Yersinia pestis”, the plague that ravaged Europe in the 14th century. I think this subject fits perfectly with the rawness of the music of Horna, but can you tell us a bit why did you choose it or what atracted you the most from it?\n\nWe were searching for a concept to this album and as one lyric was already written, we chose to keep it all connected. Black Death was a very interesting topic because so far it’s the only good solution for mass population in the recent centuries. I am quite sure there will be another one, just a matter of time and we can count the corpses all over Europe.\n\nMusically, Horna is raw Black Metal following the tradition of the bands that emerged in the beginning of the 90's in Norway or even Finland, with it's raw sound, no need of high productions and dark feeling. What attracted you the most of that music in that moment and why did you choose to play it? What do you think about how the Black Metal scene has changed all over these years and it's situation nowadays?\n\nThe music I heard in early 90’s simply touched my soul. That was enough to make me feel possessed, feel the thrills down my bones and praise the touch of cold darkness in my soul... It was at that same point I felt the need to begin expressing myself, a possessed soul has no will of it’s own... and I became the medium of darkness. Today the scene is full of useless labels and bands who put no judgements on their releases at all, only competing in who will make the most releases out in shortest time... Honestly, there are far better stuff out on demo tapes than on CD these days. It just seems too many bands want a CD released fast as hell without even bothering to make anything else, and the worst is there is always a label to release it... But, there are still worthy dedicated dark souls which I seek all the time. That is what keeps me going.\n\nOne of the particularities of Horna is the fact that Corvus sings in finnish, which gives it, in my oppinion, a rawer feeling because of the inner rawness of your language. Did you choose it because of that or because you wanted to express your feelings in your own language?\n\nWe chose Finnish in the past to do something original at that time and nowadays it remains sort of like a trademark. We have some English written songs as well but I don’t see the appeal in that for most part of the band. We do things our way and getting recognized for that is much better than doing something we are wanted to do.\n\nI think you're not a band who is used to play a lot of gigs or tours, but you still do it from time to time, and now I've seen on your website you just played some concerts in Switzerland and Germany, how was the experience? Do you like to play live? Which country has the best ambience in your oppinion? In Switzerland you played with our countrymates Cryfemal, what do you think about them?\n\nWe enjoy playing live very much and that’s the reason we still do gigs at all. Some gigs are always fucking bad and some are over expectations, the same with the recent trip as well. Swiss gig was total shit, and no, your countrymates Crying Female never showed up later claiming they didn’t hear about the gig organizer in a week or something... and I didn’t hear from them in many weeks but we still arrived there. It’s just pathetic how some bands don’t keep their word.\n\nApart of 'Ääniä Yössä', Debemur Morti Prods. is releasing now two split albums, with Behexen and Sacrificia Mortuorum, too. The first one is a re-release of your split from 2004, but is the other one containing new recordings of Horna? You've just released a split EP with Legion Of Doom form Greece too. What about this one?\n\nThe Sacrificia Mortuorum split LP features new Horna entirealy, you can’t find a more recent recording than this yet. The split EP with LoD was an old song from 2004 I think. It was unreleased with vocals before.\n\nThis new full-length is being released now on LP too, and you released just some time ago a demo tape with demo material from 'Sudentaival' and 'Ordo Regnum Sathanas'. Do you prefer these old formats to CD? Is this just a question of confrontation to comercialism, or a matter of sound and presentation too?\n\nI like the presentation most of all. I have more tapes and vinyls than I have CD’s at home and I will keep it that way. I am possessed to get new demos from all over the world, in hopes to find yet more quality music from dark worshippers. Some releases like the “Kun Synkkä Ikuisuus Avautuu” demo tape are made in such format to make it available with as low cost as possible, not making it feel like a rip-off releasing old stuff...\n\nOk then, I've finished with the questions, so good luck for the coming future and I hope to be able to see you live one of these days. If you want to add something, it's your time...\n\n​Hails and thanks for the interview. Latest news always available at www.legion-horna.com.\n\nShatraug"
