        "text": "~\n\nGreetings, infernal warbröethers and all that. After a marathon stretch we’re finally here, hammering the last rusty nail into our 2020 LISTCRUSH series – the full-length albums that resonated most with me throughout 2020. At a cursory glance, Metal Archives has 3146 full-length black metal albums logged as being released last year. Of those, I probably only checked out around a thousand, tops. So remember: this is in no way a definitive list. I’m not the grand arbiter of taste or final word on anything. These are just the records that tickled my own personal blasphemy glands juuuust right.\n\nThe original shortlist was over 200 albums long and I’ve (excruciatingly) whittled it down to a hundred of the finest – there is no “near misses” section, because in a year in which we were absolutely spoiled for good music as most had much else better to do in quarantine, there are simply too many that would have very deservedly made the cut.\n\nThere are records that immediately blew my mind (number 92, number 2, number 8), records that crept up over time to become firm favourites (number 31), expected hypebeasts (number 4) and records that deserve FAR more attention (59, 63). There were things of beauty (58, 24) and ugliness (49, 38). There are records that I fell asleep to almost every night since they were released (number 3), thrilling new discoveries (95), old masters making a triumphant return (6)… and in the case of number ONE, records that unleashed their black irradiant glories extremely late in the year yet annihilated everything else that had come before.\n\nIf any of the album titles are highlighted, clicking that will take you to our coverage of the album (reviews, premieres, interviews and all that good stuff). This list is strictly black/blackened, so if you’d like recommendations for other genres hit me up – for example my top death metal album was Ulcerate, of course, followed by Atræ Bilis. I’d probably give label of the year to the untouchable Debemur Morti Productions and if you want to check out what I consider to be the strongest demos, EPs or Splits I heard last year, read Part 1 HERE and Part 2 HERE.\n\nThat’s it. Have at it, Listcrush is finally done for another year. Hails.\n\n~\n\nTOP 100 ALBUMS OF 2020\n\n100. FORTRESS OF THE OLDEN DAYS – Verlassenheit (Worship Tapes / A Pile Of Graves)\n\n99.

KOMMODUS – Kommodus (GoatowaRex)\n\n~\n\n1. ABIGOR – Totschläger (A Saintslayer’s Songbook) (World Terror Committee)\n\nI originally intended to keep it simple and wasn’t going to write anything at all about any album on this list, but I simply have to say a few words about this diabolical gem. After TT blew me away at the death of 2019 with the dazzling NEDXXX (well, personnel are still as-yet unconfirmed but I’d bet a solid hundred that he and Rune from Shaarimoth were involved) he’s done it again with Abigor‘s twelfth album, Totschläger (A Saintslayer’s Songbook). I’ve been listening to these nine tracks repeatedly since release and over countless spins each experience brings something new to appreciate and astound – be it tiny details in each intricate composition, or an entirely new favourite track each time. Silenius from Summoning puts in what may be the best performance of his life here, too – I liked Höllenzwang, but this proves Abigor remain at the absolute top of the game. I mean, just check out the final moments of album closer ‘Terrorkommando Eligos’ – what other band would have the testicular fortitude and sheer unbridled ability to pull off what’s ostensibly a minute or two of wild, slavering, black metal drum & bass?\n\nTHIS is, hands down, the best black metal album of the year for me. Listen to it. Hail Abigor.\n\n~\n\nUltimate respect to all artists, labels, writers and supporters of the black arts. You are all lords.\n\nLike Black Metal Daily on Facebook for more cult sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\nEmail: blackmetaldaily@outlook.com\n\nStill propping up what remains of 2018 for everyone to stare/point/laugh at as it decomposes in the summer heat – the next segment of Black Metal Daily‘s favorite releases of the year, LISTCRUSH 2018: THE EPS.\n\nFor a quick recap: Last year we had the all-too-short lists for splits and EP’s crammed into the same article, this time I’ve decided to give them a little breathing room as there were far too many excellent releases in both of those categories to not give enough of them the proper attention they deserve. Hails to all of the artists involved for bestowing such incredible music upon us once again, I listened to all of these far more than I can remember and I’ll no doubt continue to for years to come. If you missed any of these check them out; if I missed any other great EPs then by all means, feel free to let me know.\n\n~\n\n25: Cult Of Extinction – Black Nuclear Magic Attack\n\n(Sentient Ruin Laboratories)\n\nThirteen minutes of sonic carnage and destruction at borderline megaton levels. Sheer bestial fucking violence.\n\n~\n\n24: Lampir – Beneath The Flesh Of Dawn\n\n(Black Gangrene Productions)\n\nI don’t think I’ve disliked any of the foul excretions from this project yet. Oppressive, hate-filled majesty. Like your entire body is filled with burning ash.\n\n~\n\n23: Serpents Lair – Perpetual Hunger\n\n(Fallen Empire Records / Amor Fati Productions)\n\nOminous torment from the Danish horde, swarming from the abyss and devouring with lethal, arcane accuracy. Ravenous.\n\n~\n\n22: Windswept – Visionaire\n\n(Ván Records)\n\nDrudkh mastermind does good again. New album drops in February, will undoubtedly be incredible.\n\n~\n\n21: Urarv – Argentum\n\n(Svart Records)\n\nOpens with a didgeridoo, never gets any less off-the-wall than that. After all these years there’s still nobody doing it like Bjørn ‘Aldrahn’ Dencker.\n\n~\n\n20: Sarkrista – Under Sentence Of Death\n\n(Purity Through Fire)\n\nAnother exemplary pair of songs from the Germans, who never let me down. Rocking, ripping, melodic and morose all in one.\n\n~\n\n19: Aparthiva Raktadhara – Agyat Ishvar\n\n(Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nWhat the hell is this, I thought – and then my head was blown off my shoulders with the force of a thousand suns. Keen for more from these Indian annihilators.\n\n~\n\n18: Ill Omen – The Grand Usurper\n\n(Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nReturning to blistering, esoteric black metal rot after the black-doom miasma of Æ.Thy.Rift was a stellar move for these Australians. Sounds like the creature on the front cover, with added solos.\n\n~\n\n17:Gevurah – Sulphur Soul\n\n(Profound Lore Records)\n\nAfter the Canadians’ astounding debut album Hallelujah! they strip back, condense their energies and focus on their more ferocious side… and it fucking works a treat. Devastating.\n\n~\n\n16: Human Agony – Goring Christ\n\n(Invictus Productions)\n\nRavenous vocals? Check. World-ending riffs? Check. The best damned war-metal release of 2018? Quite possibly.\n\n~\n\n15: Nächtlich – Second Ritual of Night Worship\n\n(Knife Vision)\n\nOne of my favourite raw projects I discovered last year. Consistency and excellence from mysterious Canadian U.E.\n\n~\n\n14:Faceless Burial – Multiversal Abbatoir\n\n(Blood Harvest Records / Me Saco Un Ojo Records)\n\nAbsolutely brutal Australian blackened death with its own unique twist. To quote a friend of mine: “Totally original… kings of Aussie metal.”\n\n~\n\n13: Cénotaphe – Horizons\n\n(Kuunpalvelus)\n\nThis French duo are on a roll, nailing everything they put out. Their split with Circle of Oroborous was great, this EP/MLP is wonderful and the teaser track from their next EP Empyrée is also top notch (listen to that here). Why I haven’t seen more hype around this band is beyond the limits of my comprehension.\n\n~\n\n12: Alruna – Relieving The Altar\n\n(Tour de Garde / Voidland Shelter)\n\nIncredible, hypnotic and dust-laden atmospheres are conjured with ease by this shadowed Austrian cult on their first release in five years. Spells Cast Unto The Silver Gleam Of The Mountains is immense.\n\n~\n\n11: SVRM – Згарище\n\n(Trismus Records)\n\nThe unsung Ukrainian master does it again. I could have just as easily put his also-amazing previous EP Лихиї вітри стогнуть без упину, so check that out too. Forever flying under far too many radars.\n\n~\n\n10: Khandra – There Is No Division Outside Existence\n\n(Redefining Darkness Records)\n\n“The concept of the release is the flaw and inability of consciousness to reflect the boundlessness of the nothingness in the frames of reality that (reality) only exists within and in the sanity. It is a sort of an attempt of exceeding the limits of imagination, which makes the lyrics unavailable for criticism from the point of view of logical thinking. The musical vessel here is a result of expression that has no bonds with any personal emotion of social nature.” Fitting, because the debut EP from this Belarusian duo will blow your mind.\n\n~\n\n9: Olxane – Primitive Casket\n\n(Nebular Carcoma Records)\n\nAnother absolute gem from T of Kaffaljidhma. I also loved his Himelvaruwe EPs plus the follow up Olxane EP Vermilion Ruin (and they all could deservedly be in this spot), but this is probably the one I threw in the tape deck the most times this year, so it wins by default. Magical.\n\n~\n\n8: The Secret – Lux Tenebris\n\n(Southern Lord Recordings)\n\nSix years off and these Italians aren’t messing around. Black doom grind for the connoisseurs, probably would have been higher if I’d been able to spend even more time with it than I did. The last track Cupio Dissolvi will dissolve you.\n\n~\n\n7: Vessel Of Iniquity – Vessel Of Iniquity\n\n(Sentient Ruin Laboratories)\n\nThe mysterious A. White may destroy us all. I’ll pull from my review of this insane sensory assault: “…an all-out sonic assailment of inevitable destruction whipping your flesh to dust. It is fucking terrifying. Percussion teeters on the brink of becoming flat-out physical punishment as disembodied howls ride escalating waves of panic-inducing power electronics noise carnage; until it all collapses in on itself and you’re allowed to breathe for a brief, precious moment.”\n\nAs an aside – his upcoming new album is equally as good, the man is unstoppable. Review of that coming soon.\n\n~\n\n6: Horna –Kuolleiden Kuu\n\n(World Terror Committee / Blut & Eisen Prod.)\n\nSome leftover tracks from the 2015 Hengen Tulet sessions, and it’s all just as great as you’d expect. Also contains an excellent and surprising cover of popular song ‘Tähdet Tähdet’ (‘Stars, Stars’) originally released by Rauli Badding Somerjoki in 1983. Dropped on the same day as their split with Pure. That was a good day.\n\n~\n\n5: Μνήμα– The Remains Of Human Bones\n\n(Harvest of Death / Signal Rex)\n\n“You want hell on Earth? This is hell on Earth. Released quietly back in May, the second demo from Hellenic solo act Μνήμα (or MNHMA) is one of the most vicious, caustic stabs of howling cacophonous bile committed to tape this year – three tracks of rawer-than-raw black carnage that sounds like the audio equivalent of being torn limb from limb on a rack” …is what I said about this savage little EP in Indy Metal Vault‘s Albums You May Have Missed article. Just press play – see for yourself.\n\n~\n\n4: Akasha – Consuming The Soul\n\n(Grey Matter Productions)\n\nBefore the Vibrations Of Blood And Hate split, Akasha‘s sole practitioner Leech was Consuming The Soul. With riffs for days, this excellent debut slice of vampyric hatred cemented him as one to watch and placed him fourth on this list, while the split with Unrest was also fourth on that respective collection of ordered releases… will Akasha also take out that position or higher on the 2019 albums list when the debut full-length drops this year? Time will tell.\n\n~\n\n3: Voëmmr – Sombr Moebrd\n\n(Harvest Of Death / Signal Rex)\n\n“Blood-curdling, ritualistic old-school crypt-dwelling misfit music of the macabre.” …so says a review on the Bandcamp page of the Aldebaran Circle-ites, and it is rather eloquently spot on. Like summoning ancient spirits and letting them speak through you, Sombr Moebrd is a fantastic follow up to Nox Maledictvs… and perhaps a great lead-in to their next full-length, sometime in the near future?\n\n~\n\n2: Kommodus – From The Ashes Of Empire\n\n(GoatowaRex)\n\nI’ve only listed the Australian’s third demo here, but please also take this to mean the preceding One Thousand Years Of The Wolf too – both are equally deserving of this position. With a primal kinetic energy like nothing else, surprising and artful interludes scattered throughout and some mighty songwriting chops to boot, both of these demos are beyond astonishing. Easily my favourite raw Australian project. Fucking great.\n\n~\n\n1: Pa Vesh En – A Ghost\n\n(Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nAs I said when Belarusian enigma Pa Vesh En landed in 8th position during LISTCRUSH 2018: THE SPLITS for his superb offering with Temple Moon, I liked everything he released last year. Perhaps none moreso than his 7″ A Ghost – two tracks of cursed black obscurity that I listened to again and again, and then some. On the surface this might not appear much to many, but with time the raw emanations of this project burrowed their way deep inside my head and nested there, growing deeper roots with every listen and becoming exactly what I wanted when I didn’t know I wanted it. The stale lingering scent of dust from centuries past, an echoing howl through cryptal darkness… Give it a shot and listen deeply. Let A Ghost into your soul.\n\n~\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\nObskuritatem – Nekrofilm\n\nArchaist – Cosmogonic Eyes\n\nEnshrouded – The Emergence Of Crawling Shadows That Lurk Within Your Festering Soul\n\nFunerary Descent – Ov Chasms Beyond\n\nHäxenzjirkell – …von Glut und Wirbelrauch\n\nGraveir – Cenotaph\n\nCalvaire – Je Me Souviens\n\nVonlaus – Vonlaus\n\nBrood In Black – Blasfemas\n\nSoul Dissolution – Nowhere\n\n~\n\nAlmost done. Arriving soon (well at this rate I’m just hoping it’s before 2020), the final chapter – LISTCRUSH 2018:THEALBUMS. Hails.\n\n~\n\nLike Black Metal Daily on Facebook for more kvlt sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\nEmail: blackmetaldaily@outlook.com\n\nLo and behold, we’re back. Before we end up past the point of no return on the treacherous roads of 2019, let’s poke the already rotting carcass of 2018 a few more times – kicking off Black Metal Daily‘s favorite releases of the year is the next segment of LISTCRUSH 2018: THE SPLITS.\n\nLast year we had the all-too-short lists for splits and EP’s crammed into the same article, this time I’ve decided to give them a little breathing room as there were far too many excellent releases in both of those categories to not give enough of them the proper attention they deserve. Hails to all of the artists involved for bestowing such incredible music upon us once again, I listened to all of these far more than I can remember and I’ll no doubt continue to for years to come. If you missed any of these check them out; if I missed any other great splits then by all means, feel free to let me know.\n\n~\n\n20: Precaria / Deathspiral of Inherited Suffering / Dominus Ira – Metamorphosphoros\n\n(I, Voidhanger Records)\n\nI reviewed this beast earlier in 2018 (check that out here) and it only grew on me even more whenever it found its way back into my playlist. A conceptual trident, of which every sharpened point is unique – yet equally lethal as the others.\n\n~\n\n19: Crurifragium / Abysmal Lord – Split\n\n(Hells Headbangers)\n\nA blasphemic pairing of unholy bestial vomit from hell. Both back with their first new material since their last great respective albums, they don’t so much fly out of the gate as smash it up and devour it. Savagery incarnate.\n\n~\n\n18: Cénotaphe / Circle of Oroborous – Split LP\n\n(Final Agony)\n\nPerhaps surprisingly if you haven’t had the pleasure of hearing them yet the Cenotaphé side of this split is the standout for me, but overall it’s a stirring display that’s both as mesmerising and curiously obscure as its lithographic cover art.\n\n~\n\n17: Inferno / Devathorn– Zos Vel Thagirion\n\n(World Terror Committee)\n\nMystic power and rage from these two behemoths. Stunningly complementary, bewitchingly coherent and of the utmost quality from beginning to end.\n\n~\n\n16: Ancient Moon / Prosternatur– Secretum Secretorum\n\n(Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nAlmost an album’s worth of ritualistic occult mania. Ancient Moon open with an immersive 18 minute piece of diabolical hypnosis while Prosternatur continue the incantation with a tryptich of resonant revelations. Fantastic work from both sides.\n\n~\n\n15: Lampir / Gormanudr– Infection At Dusk / Apocalypse (Höllenfeuer)\n\n(Skjold / Hatework)\n\nThe sensation of nails on a blackboard, balanced on a razor blade as it glides over your skin… and it is beautiful. Gormanudr take the more orthodox route over Lampir‘s miasma, complementing and enhancing this split’s raw power.\n\n~\n\n14:Occelensbrigg / Spiral Staircase – Occelensbrigg / Spiral Staircase\n\n(Harvest of Death / Signal Rex)\n\nAldebaran Circle-ites Occelensbrigg are as undeniably great as ever, but it’s Spiral Staircase’s understated raw black emanations that demand their appearance on this list for me.\n\n~\n\n13: Jute Gyte / Spectral Lore – Helian\n\n(I, Voidhanger Records)\n\nTwo stunning compositions inspired by a 1913 poem by the great Austrian expressionist poet Georg Trakl. Mind-bending microtonal madness from the master Jute Gyte… and I think I even enjoy Spectral Lore’s side more, which is saying something.\n\n~\n\n12: Unholy Vampyric Slaughter Sect / Black Aura – Unholy Vampyric Slaughter Sect / Black Aura\n\n(Infinite Darkness Productions)\n\nHere we see the always-compelling UVSS taking things to an insanely new level of raw bleak filth, and the mysterious Bosnian wraiths in Black Aura don’t let the team down one iota either.\n\nNO DIGITAL AVAILABLE\n\n~\n\n11: Primitive Man / Unearthly Trance– Split\n\n(Relapse Records)\n\nTo play this split is to know obliteration. Blackened doom noise of the most crushing order, from two of the heaviest bands in existence. I saw some people ambivalent towards this split… I loved it. Absolutely apocalyptic.\n\n~\n\n10: Kaffaljidhma / Gethsemane– Split\n\n(Zeitgeists Publishing)\n\nPriceless Dutch raw black. An immaculate journey of transcendence through the heavens from T, as you would expect – then Gethsemane get more raucous, but no less astonishing. These recordings apparently took two years to see the light of day. It was worth the wait.\n\n~\n\n9: Horna / Pure– Split Album\n\n(World Terror Committee / Blut & Eisen Prod.)\n\nNew Horna is very, very good Horna. LRH brings something special to the table (or drum stool) on his first recordings with the band and they sound all the better for it; Pure bring the grim fury like nobody’s business. Released on Jan 4th and still held its spot on the list.\n\n~\n\n8: Pa Vesh En / Temple Moon – Pa Vesh En / Temple Moon\n\n(Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nI’ve liked everything I’ve heard thus far from Belarusian enigma Pa Vesh En, and this murky, stifled offering is no different. Temple Moon also nail it, especially on the fantastic ‘Maze of Decrepit Trees’.\n\n~\n\n7: Paysage d’Hiver / Nordlicht– Schnee (III) / Füür Rouch Ruäss\n\n(Kunsthall Productions)\n\nYeah, yeah, Schnee (III) did admittedly first surface on Myspace back in the day… but in 2018 it finally copped a long-awaited proper release, plus the first new Nordlicht music in 15 years is equally as stunning. Ice cold.\n\n~\n\n6: Vilkacis / Turia– Split\n\n(Haeresis Noviomagi /Psychic Violence Records)\n\nThere’s something incredibly gripping about Vilkacis’ approach to USBM, I couldn’t get enough of it last year. And Turia… well, they’re Turia and are seemingly incapable of putting a foot wrong.\n\n~\n\n5: Turia / Fluisteraars– De Oord\n\n(Haeresis Noviomagi / Eisenwald)\n\n…case in point, another unbelievably great track from Turia. I also played the absolute hell out of this tape, a conceptual split based on rivers that flow through each of their respective hometowns. Could have (and probably should have, along with the aforementioned Vilkacis split) finished much higher up the list on a different day. Both sides are superb.\n\n~\n\n4: Akasha / Unrest – Vibrations of Blood and Hate\n\n(Grey Matter Productions)\n\n“…Akasha brings an incredibly physical, riff-driven and abrasive chaos that crackles with power as it sounds like it could fly off the rails at any second; whilst Unrest conjures an unspeakable evil and dark magic through noise-oriented rituals, savage voodoo that will terrify and mesmerise in equal measure, and a primitive black assault straight from the hate-filled primordial core of man. Oh, and to cap it off Akasha smash out a cover of Motörhead‘s ‘Ace Of Spades’.” Like raw black metal? You need to hear this split.\n\n~\n\n3: Volahn / Xaxamatza – Gods of Pandemonium\n\n(Iron Bonehead Productions / Crepusculo Negro)\n\nOkay, I’m cheating with this one because I heard it late and didn’t realise it dropped on 24th December 2017, but fuck you: this fucking KILLS. The kind of shit that makes you want to howl a primal scream and hurl yourself through a wall. These Black Circle members complement each other perfectly and do more with one song apiece than most bands of the like can achieve in an entire album.\n\n~\n\n2: Forbidden Temple / Ultima Thule – Massacre Winds / Untitled\n\n(New Era Productions)\n\nFlemish and Dutch hordes unite in an unholy raw union for the ages. The atmosphere on this is nigh on unbelievable with both sides drawing sustenance from the black blood of ages past; Ultima Thule’s side alone would make this one of my favourite things I’d heard this year so the fact that Forbidden Temple also kill it is merely the icing on the diseased, pestilent cake. Thirty minutes all up and it still isn’t long enough. True black metal.\n\n~\n\n1: Crawl / Leviathan– CRAWL / LVTHN SPLIT\n\n(Red River Family Records)\n\nUtter death. Exactly twelve minutes each side, twenty-four minutes of spiralling downwards into a hell more wretched than anything you could ever conjure in your most feverish nightmares. Crawl’s At The Forge Of Hate wants to slowly tear off your skin and eat you alive, while the mighty Wrest does what he does better than anyone with Igneous Ashen Tears and inflicts such immense psychological wounds that you’ll never be the same again. If you call yourself a fan of either project and this isn’t your split of the year, you probably haven’t heard it yet – in which case, fix that right fucking now. Untouchable.\n\n~\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\nNorse / Host – Norse / Host Split\n\nObsidian Grave / Unholy Vampyric Slaughter Sect – Lupine Musings of a Dying Faith\n\nKrieg / Integrity – Split\n\n~\n\nComing soon – LISTCRUSH 2018: THE EPS and THEALBUMS.
