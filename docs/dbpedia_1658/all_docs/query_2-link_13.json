        "text": "Co-Leader\n\nMember since 1997, Visiting Professor at the Royal Academy of Music, Playing a Stradivari violin kindly loaned by Anna Goldman FV, Chair endowed in loving memory of the conductor Yuri Ahronovitch by his wife, Tami\n\n‘My uncle, who played the violin as an amateur and lived next door to us, used to come and play the violin in my house and at the age of two I used to imitate him playing with just a pair of wooden spoons. That’s how it started. I played my first concert with the LSO in September 1993 after finishing my studies at RAM and became a member in 1997. I became the Co-Leader in 2001.’\n\nFirst Violin\n\nMember since 2014\n\n‘I knew from being a teenager that the sound and repertoire of the symphony orchestra was my greatest love and set off to music college with that career in mind. I remember how glamorous I found the LSO, as well as their coveted branded luggage tags for instrument cases. I was embarrassingly excited when I joined and got my own!’\n\nFirst Violin\n\nMember since 1994\n\n‘When I was a teenager, my best friend presented me with my first LSO record, The Empire Strikes Back by composer John Williams. From the first bar, I was so bowled over, I just knew that I had to become part of that orchestra one day!’\n\nFirst Violin, Vice-Chair of the Board\n\nMember since 2001\n\n‘My family are huge Star Wars fans, so I was aware of the famous soundtrack from an early age. I like to think it was my destiny to aim high and play in the same orchestra as the recordings I loved as a child. Being part of the Abbey Road recordings for the prequels, conducted by John Williams, brought this home. An unforgettable experience!’\n\nFirst Violin\n\nMember since 1988\n\n‘My mother was an amateur pianist (in fact she won a competition and performed a short concerto with the LSO as a child), hence I began with the piano. The violin was offered in school and by 13, playing Rachmaninoff Symphony No 2 with the Hampshire Youth Orchestra, I had resolved that this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.’\n\nFirst Violin\n\nMember since 1997, Professor at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama\n\n‘I started the violin at age three as I was obsessed with it. Luckily there was a Suzuki method teacher nearby … I do remember the day I first saw Star Wars in Paris. I asked about that trumpet player and I swore I would play in the LSO one day!’\n\nFirst Violin, Board Member\n\nMember since 1995\n\n‘I was fortunate enough to be one of the first LSO String Experience graduates in the 1990s, taken from the Royal Academy initially to ‘experience’ some real rehearsals and concerts with the LSO. I had a wonderful time and was asked if I’d audition for the vacancy in the Second Violin section that year. The rest is history …’\n\nSub-Principal Second Violin, Chair of the Board\n\nMember since 1998\n\n‘I was lucky enough to be awarded a place on the LSO String Experience scheme while studying at the Royal College of Music. I had always wanted to join an orchestra and from the first moment of my first rehearsal I knew it had to be the LSO!’\n\nSecond Violin\n\nMember since 1996\n\n‘LSO recordings with Previn and of the Star Wars soundtracks were a part of my childhood. I was drawn to the power of the Orchestra’s sound, and it always seemed like such a classy outfit. When I decided I wanted to be a violinist, I wanted to be an orchestral violinist, and the LSO was always my aspiration.’\n\nSecond Violin\n\nMember since 2019, Professor at the Royal College of Music Junior Department\n\n‘I started the violin at the age of three with the Suzuki method, following in the footsteps of my elder sister. My violin teacher tells me he would put me on top of the living room table during my lessons in order not to break his back while teaching me as I was so small! My first violin was a well put together biscuit box with a ruler as the fingerboard, and a wooden spatula as my bow!’\n\nSecond Violin\n\nMember since 1991\n\n‘At primary school it was announced that if anyone would like to learn an instrument they should go to the library at lunchtime – so I did. I was asked if I would like to play a cello or a violin. I walked half a mile to school, so lazily chose the violin. I loved it from the very first lesson.’\n\nSecond Violin\n\nMember since 2001\n\n‘I started to play the violin at age seven. After I moved with my parents to the US when I was eleven, I always wanted to come back to live and play in the UK. The LSO was always my dream job.’\n\nCo-Principal Viola\n\nMember since 1999\n\n‘As a post-graduate student at the Royal Academy in 1995, I was selected for the LSO String Experience scheme. From that moment on, I knew that if I were to be in an orchestra, it would have to be the LSO. I was so startled by the incredible standard of the players, their dedication to the music and the variety of work which the Orchestra undertakes.’\n\nSub-Principal Viola\n\nMember since 1996, Professor at Trinity Laban\n\n‘As both of my parents were classical musicians, I was deeply immersed in music from a very early age. Growing up in Aberdeen I remember attending the many concerts given by the LSO there as part of their Shell LSO Tour. I had never heard such energy and commitment. This was the moment when the LSO became part of my life.’\n\nViola\n\nMember since 2009, Professor at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama\n\n‘I was introduced to much music as a child, not only classical, but also tango and a lot of folk music. I think by the age of twelve it was very clear in my mind that music was my greatest passion in life.’\n\nViola, Board Member\n\nMember since 2018\n\n‘I first played with the LSO as part of the String Experience scheme when I was at college. After that, I was a regular freelance player for a few years before joining as a member of the Viola section in 2018.’\n\nViola\n\nMember since 2020\n\n‘I started learning music aged six in my hometown’s music school. What a journey it has been, and still there is more to learn, discover and share! I guess that hard work and passion for music have brought me here. But equally important was finding in the viola a voice of my own, a way of connecting with others and myself.’\n\nViola\n\nMember since 1994\n\n‘One day when I was about eight years old, in assembly at my state primary school, the headteacher announced that there was going to be a violin teacher coming in once a week, and asked if anyone wanted to learn the violin. Although I was rather shy, I found myself putting my hand up and became a member of a class of eight or so budding violinists. The teacher was inspirational and I was hooked!’\n\nPrincipal Cello\n\nMember since 2021; Professor at Conservatoire Royal de Musique de Mons, Belgium, and Trinity Laban, London; Chair endowed by the LSO Friends\n\n‘I could not imagine my life without playing the cello now. I am the first musician in my family to be a soloist and I thank my grandmother every time I am on stage. It’s the only place where I have always felt completely at home.’\n\nPrincipal Cello\n\nMember since 2001; Professor at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama\n\n‘As a very stubborn four year old, I heard a cello in the Dorset Schools Orchestra and left the concert determined that that was what I was going to do. Pester power took about three years, but finally, late one night, I was called downstairs and there stood my godfather, who’d bought me a cello. I had a go right away, dressed in slippers and pyjamas!’\n\nCello\n\nMember since 2013\n\n‘When I was a chamber musician, I would spend my evenings with friends watching movies and listening to the soundtracks. When one of them told me about the LSO auditions, knowing I had been a huge admirer for years, my first thought was that I couldn’t dream of it. But I wouldn’t forgive myself if I didn’t give it a try …’\n\nCello, Board Member\n\nMember since 2007, Professor at the Royal College of Music\n\n‘I auditioned for the LSO after studying in Germany and thereafter played as a freelance player with the LSO for 20 years before becoming a member. Having hugely enjoyed the musical variety that freelance playing enabled, it became a suitable time to find depth of involvement in the LSO.’\n\nDouble Bass\n\nMember since 1992\n\n‘Coming from such an incredibly musical family, it was inevitable that I would play a musical instrument. But which one? My piano teacher fell asleep on the stool next to me in every lesson. My cello teacher uttered the words ‘you are a terrible cellist’. It was when my bass teacher came out with ‘and I also work at the signalling box at Shrewsbury Station’ that I knew I was on to something … The rest was easy.’\n\nPrincipal Flute\n\nMember since 2000; Professor at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama; Chair endowed in memory of Manja Leigh\n\n‘I saw Solti conduct the LSO when I was at college in 1992: Mozart’s ‘Haffner’ Symphony and Maher Symphony No 5. It was breathtaking. I knew then that I simply had to play in this extraordinary group of musicians.’\n\nPrincipal Piccolo\n\nMember since 2001\n\n‘Having wanted to learn an instrument at school, after chime bars, the only option was the violin. My parents thought ‘we can’t face that scratching sound, how about the flute?’ (James Galway was at number one in the charts). I was very small and the teacher started me on piccolo, not the flute – so it wasn’t much better for their ears!’\n\nPrincipal Oboe\n\nMember since 2018; Professor at the Royal College of Music\n\n‘I‘ll never forget the first rehearsal I was invited to play with the LSO – getting immersed in that sound was like a drug that immediately got me hooked. The day they offered me the job, I couldn’t believe my luck and just kept asking them if they were really sure…’\n\nPrincipal Oboe\n\nMember since 2015, Professor at the Royal College of Music\n\n‘I grew up in a very musical family and had many interests (for a long time I contemplated scientific studies), yet music always moved me on a deeper level. When I got my trial in the LSO, I was struck by the awesome level in the first rehearsal, the buzz was incredible. Since then, it continues to be a very exciting adventure.’\n\nOboe\n\nMember since 2016, Professor at the Royal College of Music\n\n‘I was lucky enough to grow up in an area with a fantastic music service – my school orchestra and our county orchestra were both great! We went on tours, played Mahler symphonies and I thought it was marvellous! So I decided to practice as hard as I could, listen to as much music as possible and see if I could make a living by playing the oboe.’\n\nPrincipal Clarinet\n\nMember since 2010, Professor at the Royal Academy of Music\n\n‘Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue and Mozart’s Gran Partita both drew me to the clarinet, which I began learning aged eight (after an attempt at the violin). I first heard the LSO live in 1994 on a National Youth Orchestra trip to hear the orchestra with Sir Colin Davis and Radu Lupu playing Mozart and Sibelius – a thrilling experience I will never forget!’\n\nClarinet, Principal E-flat Clarinet\n\nMember since 1998, Professor at the Royal Academy of Music\n\n‘Whilst studying with Nicholas Rodwell, former LSO Principal Clarinet, I attended many LSO concerts. I was inspired particularly by the beautiful woodwind sound, leading me to regard the Orchestra as being the one ensemble in the world that I should aspire to becoming a part of.’\n\nPrincipal Bassoon\n\nMember since 1999, Chair endowed by Brian & Susan Dickie\n\n‘Having spent many years sawing away on the violin, I decided I’d like to try a wind instrument with a deeper sound, so I chose the bassoon. Little did I know back then that bassoons have the most fabulous position in the orchestra, sitting right in the middle, surrounded by incredible music-making.’\n\nBassoon\n\nMember since 2007, Professor at the Royal College of Music\n\n‘Classical music wasn’t really part of my upbringing, but I remember loving hearing it. A friend played clarinet: rather than waiting for her to finishing practising, I joined the same wind band on clarinet (the waiting list for saxophone was too long). A year and lots of begging my parents later, I bought a bassoon with money earned with weekend and holiday jobs.’\n\nHorn, Board Member\n\nMember since 2005; Professor at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama\n\n‘Both my parents play the horn (as amateurs – they met playing in the BBC Staff Orchestra in the early 1970s), so it was more a case of choosing which of them was going to start teaching me! I chose my mum, mainly because she favoured the use of the B-flat side of the horn (which generally makes for far quicker progression on the instrument!)’\n\nHorn\n\nMember since 2022; Professor at the Royal College of Music\n\n‘I was never that enthusiastic about playing alone but I remember the first time playing with others – maybe eight or nine kids from my school for an assembly – and it was so much better! It was like a perfect mix of a team sport and a noisy and immersive c​ollective puzzle.’\n\nTrumpet\n\nMember since 2024\n\n‘My parents made me take up the recorder aged seven. When I threw that in the bin a year later they finally allowed me to play the trumpet! My dad used to work with a lot of brass players when I was growing up, and going to concerts and listening to them play made me want to do it for a career.’\n\nTrombone\n\nMember since 2023\n\n‘I think what made me want to pursue it as a career was going to hear great brass bands around the country, and listening to what top music-making can sound like. It inspired me to take things further and study at music college.’\n\nPrincipal Timpani\n\nMember since 1988(–90) & 2002 | Professor at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama | Professor at Trinity Laban\n\n‘I loved pop, rock and jazz music from an early age, playing my mum’s pots and pans (with her knitting needles) from age four. Andre Previn’s Music Night (on BBC) was my introduction to the LSO and during one of the programmes I said to my mum and dad: ‘that’s what I’m going to do one day’!’\n\nCo-Principal Timpani\n\nMember since 2023 | Head of Percussion at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama\n\n‘The first symphony orchestra I ever watched was the LSO! They came to my home city of Norwich and our family friend (Jonathan Lipton, former horn player with the LSO) arranged for me to watch the rehearsal. I was transfixed with the timpani and percussion and immediately thought ‘wouldn’t that be an amazing job!’\n\nPrincipal Percussion\n\nMember since 1990, Professor at the Royal Academy of Music\n\n‘I studied at Chetham’s from age eleven and not long after encountered the LSO for the first time with a BBC André Previn’s Music Night broadcast. I was totally hooked and said there and then: ‘that’s what I want to do and that’s the orchestra I want to do it with’! I’ve been incredibly lucky since then to live my musical dreams.’\n\nPrincipal Harp\n\nMember since 1994 | Professor at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama\n\n‘My aunt sang in choirs in North Wales. I went to see The Dream of Gerontius and there wasn’t room for the harp on the stage. I was flabbergasted and realised it was the sound I’d heard on the TV programme Bewitched when I was 16. That was it, I was obsessed.’"
