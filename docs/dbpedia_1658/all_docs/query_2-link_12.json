        "text": "Pay\n\nMilitary pay is divided into two categories: basic pay which is taxable, and other allowances which are not taxable. Non-taxable allowances include BAH (basic allowance for housing), BAS (basic allowance for subsistence), per diem for travel, and a clothing allowance. Members of the armed forces are allowed to claim legal residence in their home state if they so desire which may also affect their state tax status.\n\nCurrent estimated annual pay for an E-6 in the Coast Guard Band with no prior service is $65,000 (without dependents) and $72,500 (with dependents).\n\nHousing\n\nDue to the limited amount of Coast Guard Housing, band members do not receive on-base housing but instead receive a BAH as part of their pay.\n\nLeave (Vacation) Time\n\nBand members receive 30 days paid leave each year plus some federal holidays. The Coast Guard Band uses a “blanket leave” policy where specific time within the year is set aside to allow members to use their leave days. Leave requests outside of the blanket leave period are considered on a case-by-case basis and may be approved depending on the performing/rehearsals schedule and mission needs of the band.\n\nHealth Care\n\nAll members of the U.S. Armed Forces are automatically enrolled in TRICARE, the Department of Defense’s health care program for active duty personnel, retirees, and their families. Through TRICARE, members receive free comprehensive medical and dental care as needed at any military health care facility or civilian TRICARE providers. Family members may also be enrolled in TRICARE and receive medical care at military or civilian facilities through various options for little or no cost. Visit http://www.tricare.mil/ for more information.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard members may participate in the Service Members’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program at very reasonable rates.\n\nPension and Retirement\n\nThe current system is a blend of a 20-year defined benefit and a defined contribution plan. Members under the modernized retirement plan will see their defined benefit multiplier (pension) reduced from 2.5 percent to two percent and will be auto-enrolled at three percent of their basic pay into a portable TSP account upon entry to military service. Following initial entry training, each member will be able to elect their own TSP contribution level.\n\nIf a member desires to opt out of the TSP contribution for a particular year, they will automatically be renewed at three percent the following year. After 60 days of service, the Coast Guard will automatically contribute one percent of a member’s basic pay (or inactive duty pay for a Selected Reserve member) to the member’s TSP account. This one percent contribution will continue until the member separates, retires or reaches 26 years of service. This contribution is automatic and does not change during a member’s career. After the completion of two years of service, the Coast Guard will match the service member’s contribution up to an additional four percent (for a maximum of five percent total) and will continue to match that contribution until the member separates, retires or reaches 26 years of service. Each member will own all government contributions to their TSP after two years of service. After 20 years of service, a Coast Guard member will be eligible to receive a defined benefit multiplier of two percent (it’s currently 2.5 percent). A member retiring may choose to receive a lump-sum payment of either 25 or 50 percent of the total retirement benefit and a reduced monthly payout. The modernized retirement plan will also include the offer of Continuation Pay to encourage retention beyond 12 years of service and provide additional income during a member’s career. The Coast Guard will offer Continuation Pay between 2.5 and 13 times one month’s basic pay for active duty and between 0.5 and 6 times one month’s IDT pay for reserve. Any member who elects to receive Continuation Pay will incur a 4 year service obligation.\n\nEducation Benefits\n\nAll members of the band are eligible for enrollment in the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) and the new Post-9/11 GI Bill. Full information about these programs can be found at www.gibill.va.gov.\n\nThe Coast Guard also has several programs to assist with furthering your education and tuition assistance. For more information on these programs visit http://www.uscg.mil/hr/cgi/\n\nOther Benefits\n\nMembers of the Coast Guard Band are entitled same benefits as other members of the Armed Forces. These include the use of military exchanges, commissaries, gymnasiums, exercise facilities and golf courses as well as services such as legal and financial assistance. Military MWR offices offer rentals of camping equipment, canoes, and athletic equipment at little or no cost. The Coast Guard Academy is a small military base, but the New London Submarine Base in Groton, CT offers many of these services.\n\nPerformances\n\nThe Coast Guard Band is the only full time performing organization in the United States Coast Guard and performs in a wide variety of venues and for various functions around the country. Military ceremonial performances include high profile functions for the President, Secretary of DHS, Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard and other dignitaries and military personnel around the country. In addition to frequent concert band performances at the Coast Guard Academy, the band performs concerts around Southeast New England and does two national concert tours per year, each being approximately two weeks long. The Coast Guard Band has also traveled internationally including the first concert tour of a Premier U.S. Military Band in Japan in 2008 and the first performance by a U.S. Military Band in the former Soviet Union in 1989. The Coast Guard Band also has an extensive chamber recital series that performs throughout Connecticut and has also given performances at the Midwest Conference in Chicago and Carnegie Hall in New York City.\n\nDaily Schedule\n\nBecause of the variety of performance requirements for the Band, the work schedule can change frequently. The Band often performs on weekends and compensatory days are given off during the week where performance and rehearsal schedules allow. The Coast Guard Band is a self-supported organization meaning that members of the band perform a variety of non-musical duties to ensure the smooth day-to-day functioning of the organization. These collateral duties typically make up about 20% of the average work week. Most new members are assigned to the stage or load crew and assist with the loading of equipment of the setting up of chairs and stands before and after performances. Other collateral duties within the band include: Music Library, Public Affairs, Operations, Administration, Education Outreach, Finance and Supply, and Recruiting. As a member of the U.S. Coast Guard Band, your primary duty is as a working musician for the United States Government. While the schedule is often flexible enough to do other performance engagements and many members of the band perform in local orchestras such as The Hartford Symphony and Rhode Island Philharmonic, duties with the Coast Guard Band always take precedence."
