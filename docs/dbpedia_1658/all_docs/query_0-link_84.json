        "text": "Finnish Black Metal legends HORNA return with their 10th full length album. Out on December 8th via World Terror Committee.\n\nMelancholy melodies glisten into fruition upon cascades of cymbals and rolling drums before a super onslaught of chaotic vocal incantations and ferocious riffing pummels us into oblivion, Horna are back. Swirling with murky occultist darkness, the traditional Finnish Black Metal mastery is naturally present with a black flame of anguishing disdain set firmly in the heart of the crushing musicianship. Malice envelopes you from the off as the warped and primal battery continually dips into melancholy while retaining a savage aggression of unparalleled proportions to conjure a monolith of pure demonic extremity. Packed with groove and a catchy rhythmic side that will draw you in and spew your conscious into hell, it is clear this titan of the Black Metal world has not faltered in the slightest.\n\nBestial rampages of daunting guitars and relentless drums continue to lay waste with a slaughtering intensity that is matched by the feral vocals so beautifully in suitably unforgiving fashion. Howling with abyssal visions, there is a staunch tempest of vanquishing soundscapes that feels like some of the strongest from Horna to date. With a massive yet never polished production that suits the ravenous musicianship to perfection, we see all of the discordant nuances of the band while there is utter conviction in the sound. No insincerity or pretence to be found, just pure blistering hellish madness. The melodic side of the music has definitely been refined on this album as it twinkled with similar dissonance to some of the Icelandic bands but definitively stays in that camp of Finnish Black Metal with unmistakably icy riffs and punchy drums. Betwixt all of this we get a lot of intricate cymbal work akin to Mgla that sharpens the mesmerising, ritualistic riffs and even utilises some clean vocals so gorgeously. Let us hope this level of proficiency is maintained.\n\nTotalling over an hour, one could mistakenly assume there is a lot of filler or time wasting but Horna keep the militant stride marching ever onwards. When one idea stays for a while it is mesmerising but with plenty of flavour and transitions to retain a volatile hostility, insuring the desolate and barren soundscapes do not become remorseful. Each piece is fairly akin to the rest, working as a grander design to punish with its scolding infernos of daunting drums, enchanting riffs and invocation-styled screams. Ranging from grooving mid-tempos to razor-sharp blasting fury and expanding on some slower, more atmospheric pacing, this is some of the most diverse work from Horna to date. Truly elevating the magnificent catalogue into a new and uninhabitable world of cult violence for only the loyal followers to observe."
