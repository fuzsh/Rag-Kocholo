More of the same and don’t expect anything else!

A staple in black metal music, Horna is the kind of band that doesn’t need presentations, they are a force to be reckoned with since the days of old.

Having recorded LOTS OF releases throughout their career, this new album, Kuoleman Kirjo, comes as no surprise but is met with lots of joy by the true defenders of Black Metal credo.

Talking to connoisseurs, there’s nothing to say about it, only that it’s more of the same old hate of before, but if you’re not converted it’s time for explanation: brutal and raw black metal, repetitive style as showed in songs like Saatanan Viha or Elegia, the drum kit beats like a hammer on one’s head, the riffs never change, it’s an unprogressive effort to keep only the true blackbangers into it and lemme say, they do a helluva work concerning this effort.

But are different vibes too: Elävänä, Kuolleena shows a syncopated sound in a mid-tempo structure, although that doesn’t alter an iota the proposal of the album, which is some kind of, let’s say, continuity.

Mustat Vuodet is the quintessence of (this) album and encapsulates the formulae into one track that shows Scandinavian elements that I believe Horna were the first to put into Finland (apart maybe from Barathrum?). The plummeting fast drumming is primitive, the final mix is also primitive but the sensation is marvelous.

Last track Ota Minut Vastaan is snail paced but nothing really changes, doesn’t it? It doesn’t evolve, it maintains the black and raw energy. Absolutely nobody asked for more.

Horna is not the pioneers of Suomi Black Metal (there are Impaled Nazarene, Beherit and the aforementioned Barathrum), but they were the first to import and to modify what had been doing all over the North and the other important bands followed suit and for that they are like a talisman for those who seek true Suomi sounds. One cannot go wrong with Horna.

Kuoleman Kirjo is out now on W.T.C.Productions.
