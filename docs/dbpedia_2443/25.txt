Bennett High School was established in 1925 as a public school in the Buffalo City School District. It was named for Lewis J. Bennett, who donated the land for the school. Located on Main Street in the University Heights neighborhood, Bennett High School is a four-story, 270,000 square foot building that enrolls around 1,100 students per year. Bennett High School offers a full Regents curriculum, with a focus on college preparatory studies in law, technology and the arts.

Prior to federal regulations placed on asbestos in the late 1970s, asbestos was incorporated into dozens of building materials used during the construction and maintenance of Bennett High School. Workers who handled asbestos-containing materials are at risk for developing mesothelioma or lung cancer. Several renovations have taken place at Bennett High School. During these renovations, workers may have been exposed to asbestos-containing pipe covering, insulating cement, block insulation, floor tiles, window caulk, fireproofing materials and other asbestos-containing materials.

Steam pipes throughout the school were covered with asbestos-containing pipe covering. Block insulation and insulating cement covered steam boilers, exhaust breechings and ventilation ducts. Vinyl asbestos floor tiles were used in many areas of the high school, including classrooms. Windows were sealed with asbestos-containing caulk, and fireproof insulation covered the structural steel. Due to wear and tear, these materials were removed and reapplied. When contractors or maintenance personnel removed and reapplied asbestos-containing insulation, asbestos dust and fibers became airborne, which workers inhaled.
