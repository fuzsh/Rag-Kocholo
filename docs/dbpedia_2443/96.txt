Without donor support, many Bennett High School students will not be able to attend the University at Buffalo and graduate with a degree that will change their lives.

Ellen Fleysher, Bennett Class of 1962 and UB Class of 1966, established the Bennett High School Access Scholarship in 2007 to reflect her commitment to help students from her alma mater. The scholarship fills the gap in funding for four to five years of undergraduate study.

You can help make a difference in the lives of Bennett students by committing to a multi-year gift, enabling them to graduate from the University at Buffalo and pursue their dreams.
