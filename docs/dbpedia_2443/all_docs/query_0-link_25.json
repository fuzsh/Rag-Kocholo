        "text": "Tell us about yourself!\n\nMy name is Ryan Haig and I am a father, husband and a transplant from Cape Cod. Moving from the beaches to the mountains over a decade ago was quite an adjustment, but I continue to be pleasantly surprised by Hometown USA and the many benefits of being part of this community.\n\nI am a beneficiary of the radical generosity of this North Country community and God’s grace. I moved to this area without knowing a soul or having a cent to my name (a story for another day). Today I have a beautiful wife, two amazing children, a thriving career, lovely home, dynamic church community and a great network of friendship and support.\n\nI work with Amsure, the insurance division of Adirondack Trust, and I partner with many North Country businesses by providing insurance solutions. I work with the best boss, best co-workers and benefit from a great culture. I’ve never had the Sunday night “scaries” and it may be hard to believe, but I actually look forward to going to work each day. My career affords me the opportunity to do what I am most passionate about: create connection, develop authentic relationships, and live out the Golden Rule in the business community.\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nHaving not grown up in the Glens Falls area, I have a unique perspective which allows me to see what a special community this is. Of course it’s not perfect, but it is a community that values relationship and not just transaction. It has history and class but is also down to earth. It has a rich arts and nonprofit community. It has a growing and healthy business environment. It is a safe community to raise a family and the natural environment surrounding it is second to none.\n\nGlens Falls will always have a special place in my heart as this is where my wife and I were married, had our first baby, graduated college (SUNY Adirondack & Skidmore,) and started a career. We wanted more space before baby number two came along, so we bought a home not far from town. While we do not reside in Glens Falls, our life still revolves around the rhythms of the Glens Falls area with work, social life, and community engagement.\n\nWe live in an a generous community and I have benefitted from being a part of it in many ways. I have so many examples of generosity, but one of my favorites is when I was starting night classes at SUNY Adirondack while working three jobs. At the time I was wondering if I had the ability and resources to jump back into academia after being out for over a decade. After my first semester I was praying about what to do when out of the blue one of my customers who I hardly knew, offered to pay for my education. Talk about an answer to prayer! Radical generosity.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nI really do love my job, so I have two kinds of “ideal” days - weekdays and weekend days. For the perfect week day, it would start with my favorite quarterly event called Christian Business Men’s Connection. These breakfasts take place at the Queensbury Hotel where 50-100 men in our community gather to connect and be encouraged by speakers from all walks of life.\n\nFrom there I would meet up with a client and deliver something delicious from Birch Bark Eatery or Lox of Bagels. It is important to fuel up with some quality carbs in order to tackle insurance related issues for their business.\n\nAfterwards I would meet up with clients and friends on the golf course. Starting up golf this year at the ripe age of 38 is not pretty, but courtesy of PSG Golf it gets better every day. More importantly, at this stage of life, there is no other venue to spend extended quality time with great people and dig into meaningful conversations revolving around family, faith and business.\n\nAfter searching for lost golf balls in the woods for 4 hours it would be time to put the suit and tie back on and shift gears to my favorite event of the year, the Adirondack Regional Chamber’s annual gala at the Sagamore Resort. The ARCC is a special organization and always seems to attract a crowd of amazing people. This event always reminds me that we are surrounded by community champions who are continuously working and sacrificing to make this region a place that people like me can move to, raise a family and put down roots to live out the American dream.\n\nFamily days are the ones we live for. There is always plenty to do in our area and my primary task is rallying the troops (my wife Tiffany, 6-year-old daughter Elsie and 3-year-old son Adam) to seize the day. An ideal day would be a Sunday which would start off with our Pine Knolls church family.\n\nSince I am putting together the hypothetical ideal day, our favorite diner, Poopie’s, would happen to be open on this Sunday (typically only open Monday-Saturday) for a post-church brunch. There is nothing like a classic diner and one of my primary functions as a father is to introduce my children to the finer things in life.\n\nFrom there we would focus in on kiddo time: Skyzone Trampoline park, Cole’s Woods, a whirlwind playground tour- whatever it takes to let out the crazy toddler energy.\n\nAfter everyone is wiped out it would be time for date night with Tiffany. Since date nights are less frequent at this stage of life, we like to hit as many of our favorite spots as we can in one outing. This ideal date night would magically skip past any wait times and we would be able to seamlessly enjoy the patio at Doc’s (serenaded by Chris Ristau,) Farmacy, and finally Raul’s for Salmon Tacos (courtesy of JK.)\n\nWe’d arrive home just in time to watch our beloved New England Patriots dominate on Sunday night football.\n\nAnd of course, no Sunday night scaries.\n\nIdeal day indeed.\n\nOn the Past and the Future\n\nThis is a stretching time of life and it is a season that I will always wish to have back. Moving to the Glens Falls area over a decade ago started this chapter. The anchor points of getting married, welcoming my children to this world, completing a secondary education and starting a career will always be associated with putting down roots in the Glens Falls community. I have been a beneficiary of radical generosity and that generosity cannot be found just anywhere. This is a special community and I am grateful to have stumbled into it. I don’t know all that the future holds, but I do know that my calling in life is to be a servant leader in my home, at my job and in my community. I hope to play my part in giving back and continue to grow this generous spirit that is the bedrock of Hometown USA.\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nHello! My name is Erin Glock, and I live on the east side of Glens Falls with my husband Mike and our two golden retrievers, Charlie & Penny. We moved here about a year and a half ago, and purchased an adorable Cape with the best screened in porch that we all love.\n\nAlthough I have a social work background, I work for KeyBank managing a construction portfolio of income property, healthcare, community development and small business projects.\n\nOn Life in Glens Falls\n\nWe chose to live in Glens Falls after we moved back from living in Utah for two years. We love hiking and being outdoors, so we wanted to be close to the Adirondacks and everything it has to offer. Although I didn’t grow up in Glens Falls (I grew up in Clifton Park), I have some fond memories coming up to the area with my family. From learning to ski at West Mountain, attending the Adirondack Red Wings games, and seeing the WWF professional wresting at the Glens Falls Civic Center back in the 80’s (The Iron Sheik, Rowdy Roddy Piper, the Junkyard Dog!). Oh, and I was once put in a headlock by George the Animal Steele!\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nRecently, I learned to play pickleball and boy is it addicting! You can find me playing bright and early every Saturday & Sunday morning at Crandall Park. I have only been playing for six months, but it’s so much fun and I play with a wonderful and welcoming group of people. If you haven’t tried it, what are you waiting for?\n\nI also love to unwind with classes at Grounded on Glen. It is one of the most beautiful yoga studios I have ever been in. The instructors and classes are wonderful and they change your mindset by the end of the hour.\n\nMust Love Dogs\n\nWhen I’m not on the pickleball court or in yoga, I am usually walking the pups around the neighborhood, downtown, or hiking one of the many trails that surround us in the Adirondacks. One thing I appreciate about Glens Falls is how dog friendly it is. We typically like to include them in most things we do, whether it’s shopping for our outdoor gear at Fountain Square Outfitters, having a meal at Davidson Brothers (they have a dog menu!), or grabbing an adult beverage at Common Roots, they are coming with us. Also, Charlie and I recently completed therapy dog training & testing. I am really looking forward to volunteering and starting our visits to bring joy and comfort to our community.\n\nOn Supporting Small Business\n\nI love that Glens Falls is so supportive of their small business community. I grew up in a family who ran a small business. My dad owned a Goodyear franchise in downtown Schenectady for over twenty years. It’s not always easy for the small business owner and that’s why it’s so important that we invest in our own communities.\n\nWe have so many wonderful restaurants (some I still need to try), quaint shops and a thriving arts scene. Being able to access these things just by walking in my own community is something that I always wanted. I love that we can just take a stroll to grab a bite to eat, get our dogs groomed, catch a show at the theater, attend an arts festival at City Park, or grab an ice cream right off the bike path.\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nHey, I’m Mike Gerarde! I operate a golf lessons business (PSG Golf), work with a great friend at The Luxury Box, just accepted the Head Coach of Golf position at SUNY Adirondack and am involved with our family HR/Payroll business, KEENA. I have two beautiful daughters that are just like their mother (in a great way…usually), Josephine and Genevieve. It all keeps me pretty busy but it’s a “happy busy” and a great life.\n\nOn Life in Glens Falls\n\nI was born in Glens Falls and raised in Queensbury. I was blessed to be able to travel a lot while I was younger. My mom was always finding new places to go, and my grandparents took us grandkids around the whole country during the summer when we were young. From Samoa and France to the Grand Canyon and bright lights of Hong Kong, nothing compared to home. Maybe I’m just a homebody, but it always seemed like none of these places compared to Lake George, Glens Falls, and Queensbury. We’ve got everything anyone could want up here. Beautiful seasons, great food, all kinds of recreation (particularly some of the state’s best golf courses!), and most importantly, the people. There was no doubt that my girls would grow up here. I’d put Glens Falls up against any other town in America when it comes to raising a family, you just can’t beat it.\n\nWe own a home right near downtown Glens Falls. It’s an older home (1920’s) but it’s been kept in great condition and the location makes it so special. We’re walking distance to school, restaurants, bike trail, work, parks, and our favorite gas station (Stewart’s!). Our neighbors are the definition of “neighborly” — we always have each other’s back and look for ways to help each other out.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nMy ideal Glens Falls day would be waking up slow in late fall and packing the girls up in the car to get a smoothie from their mom’s smoothie truck, Jenny Jo’s, outside Crandall Library. I’d chase the girls around City Park for an hour or so, then I’d steal Haley from the smoothie truck for a dance to “In Your Atmosphere” by John Mayer on the gazebo to remind her that she’s too good for me and how lucky I am to call her mine.\n\nThen I’d head over to The Luxury Box for two lessons. The first would be with a youngster who gets to experience the joy of watching the ball fly after making solid contact for the first time, and the next would be with an older student who didn’t know he or she still had it in them to hit bombs down the middle of the fairway.\n\nAfter that, we’d all meet up at my mom’s house in Queensbury to catch noon kickoff of a Syracuse football game. We’d eat my mom’s famous buffalo chicken dip while Syracuse beats up on Clemson for four quarters. My sister would be there and we’d laugh about silly stuff going on in the world and there’d be no business talk.\n\nAfter the game I’d play a quick 9 holes at Hiland Country Club with my favorite foursome: Dave Mucha, Jeff Boss, and Sam Gleason. We’d go to Mullen’s Pub after to watch the Syracuse basketball game in the back room. Local legend JG3 would drop 40 points on Gonzaga and we’d see Jim Boeheim smile.\n\nAfter that, I’d head back to the Luxury Box to watch the UFC fights on the big screens with my brother and his friends. In between fights, we would play golf mini-games on the simulator and no matter how hard my brother tries I would beat him every time. Golf is the only thing that I can beat him in so I don’t go easy. Sorry Joe.\n\nOn the Past\n\nMy favorite memories of Glens Falls and Queensbury are Friday night and Saturday football games. The whole community coming together for some healthy competition was probably what lead to my love for all sports. Yeah, the sports were fun and the games were good, but there was nothing like seeing your friends, family, classmates, and rivals all together, rooting each other on and working towards a common goal.\n\nOn the Future\n\nI can’t think of anything that I’d change about our city as far as things to do. There’s something for everyone!\n\nFrom a business standpoint, I think our small businesses would be so strong if they all joined the Adirondack Chamber of Commerce. I don’t really like the word “requirement” but if there was some way to have every new business join the Chamber, I think we’d see more places staying in business and there would be incredible connection in the business community. The cost of membership is peanuts compared to all the benefits that membership can bring to a small business. It would just be so cool to see how much more successful our new businesses could be if they immersed themselves into the business community by joining the Chamber. I should note that I don’t work for them! But I do attribute a lot of the early success of my businesses to them, from the connections I’ve made to the advertising and marketing they do for each of their members — so I probably am biased!\n\nTell us about yourself.\n\nHi, I’m Andy O’Rourke! I’m 22 years old. I’ve lived in Glens Falls my whole life. I live at home with my parents and our two cats.\n\nI’m a graduate of Glens Falls High School (class of 2019) and SUNY Adirondack (class of 2021). I’m currently a student at Empire State College. I’m getting my BFA in Theatre and Music Education, as well as Non Profit Management. I’ve been involved with several theater productions in the area, including Glens Falls High School, Broadway Upstate, and Lighthouse Productions.\n\nI’m also the Founder, Executive Producer, and Artistic Director of All Abilities Productions. It was founded in April 2022 because I got tired of getting rejected in auditions for musicals because of my disability. I have cerebral palsy. One night, I couldn’t sleep, and at 3am I thought to myself, “I’m going to change this. I’m going to create a nonprofit for people of all abilities to be on stage.”\n\nI’d like to do a full season each year opposite all of the other art companies in the area. In 2024, when I’m done with school, we’re going to kick off our first season, which will include two full scale musicals. We have our first in-person event and fundraiser on November 13 at The Park Theater. There will be a screening of the Oscar proposed film My Disability Roadmap and an opportunity to participate in a brief discussion about the movie and challenges faced by those that are a part of the disabled community. We’ll then introduce All Abilities Productions and its mission to the community. [Click here for event details.]\n\nWhile I have a disability, I haven’t ever let that stop me. If there’s anyone out there in the same boat, I’d like to encourage them to just go for their goals. Just do it. If you’re going to fail, you’re going to fail, but you’ll get back up, and eventually you’ll succeed. I’ve been lucky in that I have a supportive family to encourage me along the way. I’d also like to thank Tracy Sullivan, Miriam Weisfeld, and Elizabeth Pietrangelo from the Adirondack Theater Festival, Emily Murphy from the Wood Theater, and Chris Ristau from The Park Theater for being such an inspiration to me. I could not do it without my amazing team of volunteer board and committee members. My current board members include Carol Lavelle, Amanda Taft, Sarah Driscoll, Rose Ann O’Rourke Taft, Carol Durant, Deanna Park, Amy Cronin, Carissa O’Rourke, Dylan Lucia, and Terry Kempf. I would also like to thank Kimberly Strauchon Verner, Esq. for her wonderful pro bono work.\n\nMy Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nIt would start with a walk on the Feeder Canal trail. I love it there, especially right now with the leaves changing. It’s so peaceful. Then I’d go to Spot Coffee. I love the Coconut Lavender Lemonade. One of our production managers at Adirondack Theater Festival came up with it (thanks Jackie!). From there, I’d be volunteering at The Wood Theater. After that, I’d go to Gourmet Cafe for dinner and then to Downtown Social for Social After Dark.\n\nI love Glens Falls. It’s such a creative hub. A couple of my other favorites are the Arts District and the Adirondack Theater Festival.\n\nOn The Past\n\nI loved watching Glens Falls win the football and basketball championships when I was a senior in high school. Being there was so much fun.\n\nOn The Future\n\nI would like to see All Abilities grow into a full season like the Adirondack Theater Festival to encourage all people, regardless of disability, race, religion, age, or gender to participate in theater.\n\nOur five year plan in the off season is to work with other nonprofit organizations to provide educational programming, such as an all-inclusive dance programs or a play writing class, or an improv acting class. We hope to give our participants experiences and the confidence and skills to share who they are and all they are able to do. We want to be able to break down the preconceived notions about disabilities and build a more inclusive community. It’s important to us to create a safe and respectful environment and celebrate creativity.\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nMy name is Cameron Gallagher, I’m a filmmaker & own Black Mountain Visuals, a video production company. I’m originally from downstate New York, but grew up in Granville, New York, not far from the Glens Falls area. I’m a movie lover and storyteller at heart. Having used my family's VHS camcorder as a kid to make funny sketches and come up with stories, I grew up on the idea of creating. In the last 4-5 years I’ve had the privilege of directing some short film projects (mainly in the horror genre) that have landed on some large platforms including online horror hub Crypt TV. One of our most recent short films “THE RICKETY MAN” premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles in 2021.\n\nI love what I do and love that I can do this here in Upstate New York, where most people said it wouldn’t be possible.\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nAs a kid living nearby, Glens Falls was always the “errands day trip” but after living in Central New York for almost two years, the vibrant opportunity here brought me back, and I’m so glad it did. For me, being able to be so close to business and an exciting area, while still having some of the comfort of feeling like I’m living “just outside of town” is a pull for me.\n\nNow, my office is downtown at WorkSmart, a Co-Working Space in Downtown Glens Falls, so being within walking distance of everything has been such a huge advantage. Being able to meet other businesses at our office space has led to incredible expansion of the business, in ways we never thought, including working with amazing brands, like JUST Water, MoodleUS, National Ag in the Classroom, and both Washington & Warren County.\n\nI rent an apartment just over the bridge in South Glens Falls, but have lived both downtown and just outside it within the last five years. Each place had cool advantages, whether it was being just a few steps from work, or being in a quiet part of the neighborhood.\n\nSome Glens Falls Favorites\n\nFirst and foremost my favorite spot is WorkSmart. I owe everything to Christy, WorkSmart’s owner, and since moving my business downtown in late 2020, it has seriously changed not only my business, but my life!\n\nA second favorite would 100% be Farmacy! By far the best food in Glens Falls (of course no hate to anyone), their food is always exciting, and it has a great atmosphere.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nIt would start at Kru Coffee with some coffee and their amazing cilantro lime sandwich! Then, off to the office at WorkSmart downtown where I’d try to not chat with all the fun people there, including my friend and business partner Zack. For lunch, I’d have to stop in at Mikado or Alif Cafe! Mikado’s Bento Box for lunch is the best bang for the buck, and Alif Cafe’s Chicken Tikka bowl is a weight lifter’s (like myself) dream. Then after work, I’d take my girlfriend Allison out to Farmacy, followed by a walk around town or on the bike trail!\n\nOn the Future\n\nGlens Falls, in my opinion, is sitting on a gold mine. With proximity to Saratoga Springs and Lake George, it truly is the perfect getaway. I’m excited and hopeful for those in local government to step up and make some exciting forward thinking changes, just like some of the amazing business owners have. I think the more fun new faces that come to downtown, the more energy just seems to seep from Glen Street.\n\nOne thing I would love to see is, of course, more movies. I’d like to see a new theater (or an existing one) take on showing old movies, whether it be deep cut films that no one has seen, or absolute classics that are a must on the big screen! After attending a film festival with my friend and business partner, Zack Porlier, in Rochester, we instantly fell in love with seeing smaller films on the big screen. What better place than Glens Falls to bring classic cinema to new and old generations alike?\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nHello, my name is Kevin Hall. I’m the owner and operator of Hallwear in Glens Falls. Hallwear is a company that specializes in custom decorated items for schools, businesses, organizations, and anyone else that wants something with a logo, design, name, or number on it! We also have a retail shop in our store that sells all kinds of items, but mostly local school spirit gear, hoodies, t-shirts, hats, and more. In addition to operating Hallwear, I coach Varsity Track & Field as well as 7th Grade Football at Glens Falls School District. I live in Glens Falls with my wife, Sarah, my four year old son, George, and my dog, Charlie. I’m a huge sports fan and both of my jobs allow me to embrace that passion in unique ways.\n\nOn Life In Glens Falls\n\nAlthough I was born in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, my family moved back here when I was three months old, and I have lived here ever since. My family has deep roots in this area. Both myself and my wife's family have lived in Glens Falls and the surrounding region since at least the late 1800s. My great-grandfather George Culver was the Chief of Police in Glens Falls from 1936-1944 and my father Dan Hall was recently the Mayor of Glens Falls from 2018-2022.\n\nAfter I graduated with a degree in marketing from Binghamton University in 2007, I decided to move back home and work for my father temporarily while I decided what to do with my life. Well, 15 years later I’m still working at the same company (but for myself instead of for my father) and I couldn’t be happier with my decision.\n\nIn 2016, my wife and I bought a house in Glens Falls in a great neighborhood near the high school. My family lives less than a mile away, my wife’s parents are a five minute walk and her three siblings (and their families) all live within about a mile and half of us. I truly believe that there is no better place in the country to raise children. When my son was diagnosed with leukemia in April of 2020, the support that he received by the members of this community blew me away. My son is very fortunate to grow up in an area full of caring and giving individuals.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nA perfect Glens Falls day would be for me to sleep for the entire day! Joking aside, I would start with a full-on sit-down breakfast with eggs and meat that would make Ron Swanson proud from any of the numerous breakfast places in town (maybe throw in some pancakes or waffles if I’m feeling extra hungry). After that I would accompany my son to one of the half dozen playgrounds he likes for some full contact playing, which would include a lot of swinging. Lunch would probably be pizza — I’m a huge pizza fan. Some of the places I frequent are Angelina’s, Talk of the Town, Mia Pizzeria, and Pizza Jerks. On Saturdays in the fall, I enjoy watching the Glens Falls varsity football team. There is a special kind of pride in seeing players I’ve coached as 7th graders grow into young adults and then take the field as varsity players. Dinner would have to be a nice medium rare steak either grilled by myself or anywhere downtown that we could walk to.\n\nOn the Past\n\nGrowing up here I have a ton of memories, but my favorite memory is a recent one. My wedding was an amazing Glens Falls day. Since my wife and I are both proud GF lifers, we wanted our special day to be in and around Glens Falls. We were married in a relatively short ceremony performed by the mayor at the time in front of the fountain in Crandall Park on a beautiful fall day.\n\nAfter the ceremony, we had our reception at The Queensbury Hotel a few short weeks after they came under the new (and current) management. With all that goes into taking over a landmark hotel, the management and staff could have easily and understandably been overwhelmed and treated us as an afterthought but let me tell you, they did not. The entire crew at The Q took care of us and helped to make that day as special as it could possibly be. We danced through the night, ate great food, and drank probably a little more than we should have! We even ended our night downtown at The Bullpen with me in my tux and my wife in her wedding dress! I don’t think I would change anything about that perfect day.\n\nOn the Future\n\nI have two ideas that I think, maybe selfishly, would improve Glens Falls. The first would be a BBQ joint that I don’t have to drive a while to get to and is open year-round. I’m a huge fan of BBQ and I think it would be different enough from the other restaurants downtown that it could thrive. I know year-round is not easy with our climate but a place like that would get my business at least weekly.\n\nThe second idea I stole from my wife. Our son was recently diagnosed with autism, and we would love a sensory play gym for him to run around in. Sensory gyms differ from other play places in that the equipment is specifically set up for kids that are neurodivergent, but other children would have just as much fun!\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nHello! My name is Tess Bannon and I am an adventurer, yogi, and the spiritual craftswoman behind Buffalo Bannon Designs. I fabricate sterling silver natural stone jewelry and offer custom designs. I studied fashion merchandising and jewelry design at Buffalo State College. Lately, I’ve been fascinated with the study of human design and stone medicine. My intention is to fuse these practices into my custom design formula, bringing new meaning to the concept of healing jewelry.\n\nI recently started working at Saratoga Farmstead B&B, which is a green certified farm-to-table bed and breakfast with a wellness focus. The energy there is so captivating. It's newly owned by my friend and Licensed Massage Therapist, Allison Menter. Together with the cook and gardener, Flo, we work harmoniously and nicknamed ourselves the farm fairies. This year we are laying down the groundwork, but we have an abundance of ideas such as yoga classes, wellness workshops and curated retreats that we hope to weave into the future of Saratoga Farmstead.\n\nIn the Glens Falls area, I am best known at MinkyMink boutique which is owned by my sister, Maura Forcier. Mo has always been my role model, and growing up we dreamed of opening a store together. Minky feels like the embodiment of that dream because I sell my jewelry there as well as having worked there for five years. I helped Minky develop their brand, created internal online systems and escalated their social media presence. The NYC buying trips were a huge highlight, but organizing themed photoshoots and modeling was my absolute favorite. I love collaborating with photographers like Court L Photo and small businesses like Epithet Floral to create epic displays of beauty and fashion. Working with influential, motivated and creative women is incredibly empowering and something that I will never stop exploring. I am so grateful for the network of entrepreneurial women in this area, especially my sister. She has taught me so much about the fashion industry as well as introducing me to the Glens Falls community. We have a very supportive relationship and after five glorious years of working side by side, our professional life has evolved into a collaborative partnership.\n\nI am embarking on a new adventure with my jewelry business that my 19 year old self would be very proud of. As for the backstory, the short of it is that it came to me during a Phish show 11 years ago and I've been dreaming about it ever since. Last year, I bought a DubBox trailer and custom designed the interior to be both a jewelry studio and a retail boutique. I like to call it my \"studiotique.”\n\nOn Glens Falls Roots\n\nWe have some deep family roots in the Glens Falls area. My father's side of the family migrated from Canada and North Creek down to Glens Falls. My great grandfather John built a house on Dix Avenue that still exists today. He and his wife Alida both worked at The Shirt Factory.\n\nMy grandfather Charlie was an anesthesiologist and started a business called Warren Anesthesia. He brought the concept of a recovery room to the Glens Falls Hospital where patients would heal post surgery. My grandma Eliene sold antiques at the Glenwood Manor in Queensbury.\n\nMy father David and his four sisters attended St. Mary's and Queensbury schools. My father met my mother Arcangela at a dinner party in Buffalo, NY. They discovered that they worked at the same hospital and lived close by. They got married in Glens Falls at St. Mary's Church and moved back to the area to grow their family. My father always dreamed of owning a farm and after many years of hard work, they built one.\n\nI grew up on this family farm with my two very inspiring older siblings, Colin and Maura. My parents are retired medical professionals but I wholeheartedly thought my dad was a farmer until first grade. My early life consisted of horseback riding, mucking stalls, feeding chickens, and playing with goats. I adored growing up this way. It helped me develop a strong work ethic and refined my love for nature and adventure.\n\nI also favored jewelry and I was fortunate to learn how to make it during metalsmithing class at Lake George High School. Art class brought me so much joy. I studied studio art, photography and graphic design. At the end of the school year I submitted my work to the juried high school art show at the Hyde Museum. They accepted the first piece of jewelry that I made, a brooch inspired by my family heritage. When I saw it displayed behind glass for the first time, I thought, \"maybe I am good at this.”\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nI live in a tiny house in Queensbury. I remodeled it with resources from the property and upcycled materials, going as green as possible. The structure is 400 sq/ft. It has an open concept with an eat-in kitchen, bedroom / living room, bathroom, closet, meditation nook, and storage loft. Next year, I'd like to build a front porch. I'm super excited to downsize, declutter and simplify my life. I am someone who collects lots of little treasures, but letting go is a practice I've cultivated over the years.\n\nWhat I love most about renovating this tiny house is the journey of it all. I thrive in an environment of my own creation and knowing exactly how much time, effort and love that went into every aspect gives me a whole new level of appreciation. I am so grateful to everyone who helped me build such a magical mini sanctuary.\n\nSome Glens Falls Favorites\n\nOne of my favorite things about Glens Falls is the flourishing art community. I feel like there are so many creative nooks and crannies all over GF. There's the Hyde Museum for art admirers, The Shirt Factory for handmade treasures, LARAC for crafty finds, The Park Theater for musical grooves, the Adirondack Film Festival for movie lovers, GEM Fest for entertainment enthusiasts, and fabulous murals sprinkled in between. Side note: I cannot wait to see the building Hannah Williams is painting! There is a beautiful flow of art, small business, nature, and industry in this city with a different artistic flair for everyone to enjoy. The love and support for small businesses here is unmatched. I thoroughly enjoy witnessing new and existing businesses thrive. It's a joy to be a part of it all. There are so many gems, but a few of my favs (besides Minky) are Juicin’ Jar, Fountain Square Outfitters, Alif Cafe, Rockhill and Laura’s Vintage.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nOne version of my perfect day spent in Glens Falls starts with a glass of lemon water and a morning yoga flow at Grounded on Glen. After movement and meditation, I grab my backpack on my walk over to Kru Coffee for a dirty chai latte with oat milk. Then I make my way to the park to find a nice tree to sit under. I spend about an hour journaling my thoughts and doodling some jewelry ideas. I have plans to meet Maura and Morgan at Farmacy for Drag Brunch, so I head over to Morg's picturesque downtown apartment and hang out until it's time to go. We have fun getting ready for the afternoon while Maura snags our table. We walk downstairs to meet her and in true big sister fashion, she already has mimosas waiting for us. Thanks Mo! It's show time and the menu's fixed so delicious small plates are being delivered while we focus our attention on the wonderful performers strutting down the center aisle. The crowd is wild, the vibe is high and the ladies are sassy! We're smiling, cheering and lovingly blushed with bubbles. After the show, we stop into MinkyMink for our obligatory visit and tell the girls all about the experience we just had. After stories, laughs and browsing of course, we drop our photos into the shared album, hug, then go our separate ways. I head home to my cozy cabin and relax for the evening. It was a fabulous day.\n\nOn the Past\n\n2020 was a strange year in so many ways but also transformative with some fun moments. In February of that year I moved into my first GF apartment with my roommate Frankie and her two cats, Honey and Winnie. We had a month of new roomie shenanigans before quarantine started. Having limitations on places you could go and the people you could see gave me the time and space to turn inward and start asking myself serious life questions about the things I value most. I started different kinds of self care, dropped a few habits, began a daily yoga and meditation practice, experimented with a new business strategy and educated myself on the complete chaos happening throughout the world. Once summer hit, Frankie and I would bike or roller skate around our neighborhood and to the park. We hung out on our back porch, ordered take-out from local restaurants, laughed on the roof, celebrated the “rainbow hour” and cozied up with the kitties watching movies from our third floor living room. During a fearful and uncertain time, our home in Glens Falls was the safe haven we didn't know we needed.\n\nOn the Future\n\nI worked across the street from a food co-op in Buffalo that was beyond spectacular. You could buy breakfast, lunch and dinner there and sometimes I did. They provide local organic produce, freshly prepared foods, hot soups, a make-your-own salad bar, an array of bulk products, sustainable items and eco-conscious groceries. It's a health nut's absolute fantasy and something I think Glens Falls would also fall in love with.\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nHi, I'm Melanie! I live in Glens Falls with my husband Christian, 16 month old son Oliver, and our dog Cooper.\n\nI have two jobs right here in Glens Falls, I am the Co-Owner of (g)row- the new kids store on Exchange Street and I also work with the team at Fronhofer Design, an engineering firm that specializes in designing and manufacturing craft beverage equipment. Although these roles are very different, I feel fortunate to be in two awesome industries right here in our little city.\n\nWhen I'm not working I am usually out adventuring with Christian and Oliver. We love hiking, spending time on the lake, walking through the neighborhoods, or grabbing a bite to eat downtown.\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nI grew up in Salem, so not far from Glens Falls. After living in Washington DC, Brooklyn, and Boston over the course of 10 years, I eventually made my way back upstate and settled in Glens Falls. It really had everything I was looking for; close to family, big city conveniences with small town charm, and walkability.\n\nI don't know many other places where you can walk 10 minutes in one direction and be at the shops, restaurants and bars, and then walk 10 minutes in the other direction and be in the woods on lit cross country ski trails. Glens Falls really does have it all!\n\nI have now lived here for 4 years and I can't imagine leaving anytime soon. I have fallen in love with this community and all that it has to offer.\n\nMy husband and I own a Colonial home right near Crandall Park that was built in 1900. Although it still has a ton of original charm, the previous owners did an incredible job renovating it. Before we moved into this house we practically gutted our old home on Crandall Street ourselves with the help of family and friends, so moving into a home without a lot of projects has been a treat.\n\nWe love our neighborhood and definitely take advantage of how close we are to Crandall Park. We are always headed there for a walk, the playground, the splash pad, or a round of disc golf.\n\nSome Glens Falls Favorites\n\nI know I keep bringing this up but truly, my favorite thing about Glens Falls is the walkability. I love that we can walk to the park, multiple trail systems, restaurants, bars, and even the grocery store. I love not having to get in my car and I have met so many people by just being out walking.\n\nAs for hidden gems, The Hyde Collection and the Children's World Awareness Museum top the list for me. Both are places that I need to visit more often and think they get overlooked when it comes to what our city has to offer.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nThis is a tough one and totally depends on the day of the week, so here is my ideal Sunday. It would start with taking our dog, Cooper, for a walk to Crandall Park and of course we’d have to stop at the swings and ducks for Oliver. We would then grab a coffee and breakfast sandwich at KRU and walk along the Feeder Canal towpath.\n\nAfter that we would head to story time at (g)row, and then on a perfect Sunday my entire family would take a nap at the same time (I can dream, right?!).\n\nFor the evening we would get a babysitter and head somewhere serving Common Roots for a beer and dinner.\n\nThe ideal night would, of course, end with ice cream at one of our awesome soft ice cream spots!\n\nOn the Past\n\nWhen I was little we went to see Sesame Street Live at the then Civic Center. To me it felt like we were in the big city! We are so fortunate to have a venue like the Cool Insuring Arena in our downtown, and I would love to see more shows and concerts filling that space.\n\nOn the Future\n\nDreaming up new businesses is one of my favorite activities! If I had to choose just one thing I think we could really benefit from, it would be a general store downtown; a place that sells basic hardware store supplies, a refrigerator stocked with local meat, cheese and produce, and maybe even fresh flowers. Something that you can walk to downtown to meet all of your basic needs. If anyone reading this is feeling inspired to run with it, come find me — I have already been brainstorming names!\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nMy name is Cam Cardinale and I’m the Director of Marketing and Communications at Advokate, LLC, as well as the Operations Associate at the Charles R. Wood Theater. I’m a proud dog-dad to my soon to be two year old German Shepherd, Hudson! Hudson and I enjoy walking local trails such as Betar Byway and the Warren County Bike Trail.\n\nMy wonderful family resides in South Glens Falls and owns Cardinale’s Car Care. Growing up in a small family business really impacted my views of Glens Falls and shaped my mindset on supporting small, local businesses. At the repair shop, I am the Director of Business Development and Marketing. I am so thankful for the constant support of my family - including my parents Michelle and Pete and my brothers Gavin and Trey! Plus, I’ve got a new niece and I’m excited to share all of the greatness of Glens Falls with her.\n\nAdditionally, I am a huge advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights and have found that we need more programming for these individuals in and around Glens Falls. Currently, I am working with a group of folks to bring The Bridge, now known as Lower Adirondack Pride, back to life to provide a social outlet for LGBTQIA+ individuals - especially youth!\n\nI also owe a huge shoutout to Kate Austin, who has immersed me even more into the Glens Falls arts, events, and happenings! Through the last eight months at Advokate, I’ve been shown so many different perspectives of Glens Falls. It’s an honor to work with clients such as the Glens Falls Collaborative and the Warren County EDC to show how great of a place Glens Falls and Warren County as a whole are! Also, Emily Murphy and Shelley Fairbanks are my constant hype people and go along with (most) of my crazy ideas.\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nI grew up right across the bridge in South Glens Falls but have always had a strong love and passion for what’s going on in Glens Falls. The thing that really drew me into Glens Falls was the constant flow of events happening right here! From Wing Fest to Pet Fest, GEM Fest, and more, there are always events at any time of the year.\n\nThere are so many things I wish people knew about Glens Falls. The wonderful food, events, and community. The variety in local restaurants is wonderful, and you can enjoy a different type of cuisine every night of the week!\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nA perfect day in Glens Falls would start off with a breakfast sandwich from Birch Bark Eatery (or Sunday brunch from [farmacy] restobar!) followed by a stroll through City Park on the way to the Advokate office. My mid-day lunch run usually takes me to Juicin’ Jar for a wrap or Mikado for a Bento Box! After lunch, I make it a priority to attend any event that may be happening around the city. A few of the recent events I’ve loved were the LARAC June Arts Festival and Chuck Schumer’s visit to Glens Falls. Dinner is by far my favorite meal of the day. My go-to spots are [farmacy] restobar, Raul’s, Downtown City Tavern or Alif Cafe. After dinner, I often enjoy a sunset bike ride on the CDPHP Cycle bikes that you can find all around the city!\n\nOn the Past\n\nOne downtown business I was sad to see leave was Aimie’s Dinner & Movie. This would have been such a cool venue to be able to bring local films into - but I’m glad we have spaces like the Charles R. Wood Theater, Crandall Public Library, The Hyde, and The Park to show the masterpieces that local directors and filmmakers have produced.\n\nOn the Future\n\nGlens Falls is a great city - and is on track to be an even better city! I am thrilled to see new businesses bringing so much variety to the downtown area. I also can’t wait to see Rude Betty’s new space!\n\nThe Arts District of Glens Falls is constantly brainstorming and executing projects such as bike racks, painted electrical boxes, and sidewalk stamps. I am excited to see what this group of dedicated individuals comes up with next!\n\nI have an extraordinary vision for Lower Adirondack Pride and I know with the great group of people we have involved, it’ll do wonderful things for the community!\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nHey there! My name is Elaina. I am the regional recruiter for AFLAC. If someone were to ask me what my role as a recruiter entails, the best way to describe it would be that I look to find hidden talent in any industry. I work closely with our Regional Sales Coordinator, Melissa Stewart. You can find us both downtown on Fridays for our weekly afternoon happy hour at The Q or DTCT!\n\nWhen I'm not working, I love to travel! It could be a staycation in Lake George or an all-inclusive beach getaway, either way — count me in. Especially now that travel has opened up again, I want to try and cross more destinations off my list. My dream vacation would be Greece!\n\nI live downtown in Glens Falls with my boyfriend, Tony and our cat, Scarlett (aka Scar-Cheeto, Scar-Burrito, or Little Momma). We are currently searching for our first home, and I really can't see myself anywhere else but here!\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nFirst, a little backstory on me. I actually was not born in the states — I was born in New Delhi, India. My parents adopted me when I was about 8 months old. I'm a middle child — I have an older sister and younger brother who are both adopted as well. While we are not biological siblings, we are all from India. Growing up, my parents would bring us to Albany for the Indian Festival and different cultural events as a way to learn more about our culture and background. I've always enjoyed being a little \"different\" and I don't mind questions — I love to share my story! Someday I would like to go back and visit India. Plus, I wouldn't say no to authentic Indian curry! Mmm!\n\nI grew up in the Queensbury School District and graduated in 2015. My love for Glens Falls began about 5 years ago when I moved into my current apartment with my boyfriend, Tony. Being just a couple of blocks from downtown, we take advantage of everything that the city has to offer. Whether it's a walk around Crandall Park, grabbing a drink & catching a show at the Wood Theater, or simply relaxing on my porch overlooking Glen Street — I feel at home.\n\nSome Glens Falls Favorites\n\nGlens Falls has such a cool, small-town vibe. You instantly get this sense of community — it's almost like something out of a movie set!\n\nFun fact: I'm obsessed with the buildings in Glens Falls. Next time you're walking around, look up! Many of the shops and houses have unique details & colors. For example, you may notice by Siam Thai that there is an imprint of two lions with wings, almost like a gryphon. Check it out!\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nOh geez, where should I begin? The day would have to start off with brunch at Farmacy. C’mon, who doesn’t love bottomless mimosas?!\n\nOn my way home, I'd walk through Finders Keepers consignment shop. I always end up finding unique earrings and necklaces when I stop in.\n\nLater that day, I'd head over to DTCT to grab a couple more drinks before heading over to Radici for dinner. I’m sure Chef Brian will have some crazy dinner special that I’ll have to try out! Afterwards, I’d head back home to my happy spot on the porch for the rest of the evening.\n\nOn the Future\n\nOk, hear me out — a rooftop bar! We have beautiful outdoor patios but having a rooftop bar and lounge would be awesome. I could see myself hanging out there on a beautiful summer afternoon, soaking up the sun while overlooking the city.\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nMy name is Dave Globerson, I’m a Glens Falls based artist specializing in creative portraiture and illustration. I grew up in Saratoga and I graduated college from the University of Hartford Art School in 2008. My wife and I moved to the area in late 2020 and are absolutely thrilled to live here.\n\nThe pandemic shutdown awarded an interesting opportunity to pivot and start my own creative business. I’ve had a number of different career paths in the restaurant industry (as many creatives tend to gravitate towards) and as a musician, but at the end of the day I knew I wanted to be an artist. I knew there was something more for me out there. I needed a change. I started making pet portraits for my family and a few friends and posting it on Instagram. Next thing I know, a flood of requests came my way. My wife encouraged me to keep going with it, so I set up a studio in our spare bedroom, got to work, and I haven’t looked back since. I’m so thankful for her love, support, organization and critical eye. Without her I don’t know where I’d be.\n\nMy mission as an artist is to create meaningful and individualized paintings for my clients. I’m often regaled with stories about their pets or loved ones; many of my clients have hilarious narratives they give to their pets and it’s my job to bring those stories to life. I like to pepper my humor into my work (and in every aspect of my life for that matter) which has led to some genuinely hilarious pieces. I realize how uniquely fortunate I am when my work day ranges from printing a basset hound as an astronaut, a papillon as Martin Van Buren, or an Elizabethan portrait of a cat, just to name a few. Memorial paintings have become a major part of my portfolio, too. I’ve been able to help many people cope with grief through my artwork. I feel incredibly fortunate to bring light to people during difficult times.\n\nI don’t just paint pet portraits, although they are a primary focus of mine. I'm proud to have created artwork for a bunch of local 518 businesses such as Kru Coffee, Lake George Crossfit, Whitman Brewing Company, Henry Street Taproom, Flatbread Social, and Unified Beerworks. My portfolio also includes wedding portraits, traditional portraits, can labels, chalk art, spray paint murals, lawn jockeys and album art. I also painted a Saratoga Horse which is on display in front of The Posie Peddler in Saratoga, as well as several Ballet Shoes for the National Museum of Dance that are on display in front of Spot Coffee in Saratoga. I try to say yes to every commission and give it my all.\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nWhy Glens Falls, you ask? Location and community is the short answer. My wife and I eloped at Highlands Castle in May 2020 and with the money we saved we were able to afford a house. She works at Glens Falls Hospital as a PA. The main criteria was for us to find a place close to the hospital, a place for me to set up a studio and a back yard for our dog to play in.\n\nAfter looking extensively we found the perfect home. The neighborhood around Crandall Park is lovely. I love how the entire area is so community based, wholesome and neighborly. Our house is from 1905 and was maintained beautifully. We moved in during that humongous snowstorm at the tail end of 2020 and our neighbors were quick to offer us help in any way we needed. I love how beautiful everyone’s homes and gardens are each season and holiday. I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the incredible collective effort that goes into Halloween around here.\n\nSome Glens Falls Favorites\n\nOne thing I love about Glens Falls is that there are so many little hidden gems scattered throughout. Arroy Dee for sushi and thai is A+. Birch Bark Eatery donuts are a slice of heaven. Angelina’s Grandma Pizza is my personal favorite in the area. As a vinyl collector and overall music nerd, I’d also love to give a shoutout to Sweet Side Records. I would love to hear more recommendations from locals as well!\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nOur ideal day in Glens Falls? Start off with a good workout at Lake George Crossfit, get coffee and breakfast sandwiches at Kru Coffee downtown, take the dog for a walk through Crandall Park, afternoon cocktails on the front porch, then dinner at Radici. If porch cocktails aren't an option then we’d have margaritas over at Raul’s. I also love paying a visit to our friends at Common Roots for some killer beer and a delicious pizza. Especially after a hike!\n\nOn the Future\n\nMy wife and I frequent our downtown often and there are some really great shops and restaurants around the area. There are some empty storefronts that are holding tremendous potential. I could see this becoming the new hot spot for even more creative restaurants, bars, clothiers and startups.\n\nIf I could wave a magic wand, I’d love to see a proper BBQ restaurant set up somewhere downtown. If there is one and I’m missing out, please let me know!!\n\nOn the Past\n\nAlthough I grew up in Saratoga, I have fond memories of Glens Falls. My Dad had a pediatric dental practice here. His office was super fun and full of arcade games and bright colors. He used to take me over to Lox of Bagels or Steve’s Place whenever I went to visit him during a work day. Chances are, if you’re a Gen Xer or an elder Millennial from around this area, he was your dentist.\n\nThis is a wonderful town with a great sense of community. I’m glad to be part of it! For anyone interested in checking out my work or commissioning a painting, my website is www.dfgillustration.com and you can follow me on instagram @dfgillustration.\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nMy name is Benita and I am the owner of Bella Lyn's Bakery & Cafe. I'm a self taught baker, motivated by my family to turn my hobby into a business that can help support them. Most of my days consist of being a mom and a wife attempting to juggle football games, jiu jitsu, pack lunches and whatever else my children decide to indulge in.\n\nAfter all that is done, I have what seems like minutes for myself and that's when the creativity begins to flow and I'm making cupcakes or dipping fruit at three am. My true passion is giving back and I’m always looking to help those in need. I am hopeful my new business will help me do just that.\n\nOn Life In Glens Falls\n\nMy family is not originally from this area. My husband is actually a NYS Correctional Officer at one of the local facilities. After visiting the area, it quickly grew on us and he decided to transfer. We began our new life here about a year and a half ago. It is a beautiful place to live and we love how close the community seems to be. It seems to give us some of that city familiarity and small town vibes we've been looking for. I feel it's a great place to raise a family.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nMy ideal day in the city would probably start at Starky's Diner. My kids love eating breakfast there. The kids and I are most likely having hot dogs, pancakes with bacon and eggs. The hubby is going to order sausage biscuits and gravy with runny eggs. He's discovered a north country staple and he loves it.\n\nMy children are super active, so I would have to say the next stop would be Crandall Park to let the boys burn off some energy before lunch. Downtown City Tavern would definitely be our lunch stop.\n\nDate nights are unfortunately few and far between but my husband and I have been meaning to try Mikado.\n\nOn the Past\n\nOne memory that's going to stick with me was the day we moved here. We moved at the height of the pandemic - with barely any of our belongings - into a hotel. Within a week we found a home, but our furniture delivery was delayed with no expected date of arrival. We ate pizza while sitting on our floor, but regardless, we knew we were home. It felt amazing to the point we've made it a family tradition. Whenever we move we eat on the floor.\n\nOn the Future\n\nThis may seem just a little biased, but I'm going to have to say Bella Lyn's Bakery & Cafe is what Glens Falls is missing. We will be offering warm empanadas stuffed with meat and cheese inside of a flaky crisp crust. I love eating Puerto Rican rice and beans with pulled pork, but I can't find it here - so luckily it will be on our menu as well. Stay tuned!\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nMy name is Paul Nasrani. I’m the founder and owner of Adirondack Creamery Ice Cream. My wife Simi and I have two children.\n\nOn the Ice Cream Business\n\nIn the early 2000s I was the Chief Financial Officer of a company in NYC and dreaming of starting my own business. I used to make ice cream as a child on a friend's farm and began to make ice cream using simple ingredients – milk, cream, sugar and eggs — in my tiny Manhattan studio apartment for friends. My ice cream was so well received that in 2004 I quit my job and relocated to Silver Bay on Lake George start Adirondack Creamery which was also my introduction to life in the Glens Falls region. I now have an ice cream company which produces all of our ice cream with milk and cream from small family farms to stores throughout the New York Metropolitan, Hudson Valley, Capital and Adirondack regions. Some of our flavors include Whiteface Mint Chip (named after the Olympic mountain in Lake Placid), Syrian Date and Walnut (50% of the profits are donated to groups that help Syrian refugees), Chocolate Peanut Butter, Kulfi Pistachio Cardamom, Pumpkin Pie, and more.\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nWhile I had spent summer vacations on Northern Lake George throughout my youth, I was not familiar with Glens Falls until founding Adirondack Creamery in 2004. On a trip to plan the opening of Adirondack Creamery at Silver Bay, my then girlfriend, Simi (now my wife of almost 15 years) mentioned we should stay over at her mother’s place which I thought was in Albany, but it turned out to be a lovely home on Glen Lake that she had owned since the early 1990s. Simi's parents loved the Lake George region because the mountains and lakes reminded them of Kashmir, where they are from. We stayed at Glen Lake a lot during the early years of Adirondack Creamery and over the years as the ice cream company and our family grew, we spent more time there each summer, as well as the holiday season and ski weekends in winter. During the pandemic, we decided to spend most of our time at Glen Lake.\n\nSince we have been spending more time here, we have discovered wonderful things in our neighborhood (beyond the lake we love so much). For example, biking the trail to Coopers Cave (and stopping at Sprinkles on the way), shopping at the Farmer’s Market downtown, cross country skiing at Cole’s Woods, basketball in Crandall Park, the pool and trails at Gurney Lane, shows at The Wood Theater, and more. We also love the amazing proximity to our favorite Adirondack areas for outdoor activities – Northern Lake George, Keene Valley, and Lake Placid.\n\nWe really enjoyed how our neighborhood came together this past winter to create and maintain an ice rink which stayed in use until mid-March. We enjoyed hockey games that lasted until dark, skating lessons, and even a neighborhood barbeque out on the ice.\n\nSome Glens Falls Favorites\n\nI love the energy and evolving downtown – wonderful shops, an amazing library, green public spaces and of course so many wonderful food options that I can’t name them all– Morgan and Co, Mikado, Flight, Radici. A favorite hidden gem for us is La Cosina Mexicana on Bay Road and we also love Bean's Country Store in Queensbury (which sells our ice cream).\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nI’d start the day with an early morning bike trip from Glen Lake to Glens Falls, grab the first coffee at Stewart’s just off the trail, and then ride back to get in the first dip in the lake for the day. If it’s a Saturday, we’d head back downtown to pick up coffee and an egg sandwich at Flight and then to the Farmer’s Market for eggs, vegetables, fruit and whatever else looks great. We’d then head back home for another swim and cooking up some of the Farmer’s Market food on the grill for lunch.\n\nWe would kayak and swim with the boys in the afternoon and then paddle over to the Docksider for mid afternoon cocktails. In the early evening we’d all pile into our old Lincoln and head south to Common Roots for dinner outside and then we’d be off to the Glen Drive-In where we’d enjoy popcorn and our own Adirondack Creamery ice cream all while having a blast watching a feature under the stars.\n\nOn the Past\n\nI miss having Kashmiri tea with my mother-in-law on the deck of the house on Glen Lake. She was a doctor in the Albany area but had Wednesdays off and loved spending her days off here as it reminded her of the lakes and mountains of her native Kashmir. She was never happier than when our kids were running all about the yard and jumping in the lake. She passed away a few years back and I am certain she would be thrilled that her grandchildren continue to love the area as much as she did and we continue to have tea on the deck.\n\nOn the Future\n\nI'd love to see a Middle Eastern restaurant or a gourmet grocery store selling more ethnically diverse foods, similar to Kalustyans in NYC. I definitely miss the variety of food options we have in NYC.\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nHey, my name is Katie Leonka! I’m a mom of two - Tenley (3 years) and Macey (10 months). My husband Brendan is a Glens Falls fireman.\n\nI recently started working at the Glens Falls Veterans Affairs office on Ridge Street. Working with our local veterans is so rewarding. This job gives me the opportunity to give back to those who served us and this is meaningful and fulfilling to me! Every day I look forward to meeting more veterans in this position.\n\nI maintain a very small blog on Instagram (LuckyLeonkaCo) where I engage with an evolving mom community. We spotlight other moms, their experiences and perspectives, struggles with motherhood, quick meals for the busy mom, and the one thing that keeps most moms going - coffee! I share my own experiences with motherhood, the importance of positivity, and showing up when it’s not always the easiest. For example, completing a 6 month dietary restriction (cutting dairy) for my own lactose sensitive baby girl was quite the challenge recently. Featuring my custom made shirts on this blog and getting feedback from the community helps me to separate the good ideas from the ‘not-so-good’ ideas - it’s still fun!\n\nAnother fun fact about me is that I’m ordained (because your girl loves love) and I’m going to get to marry a few of my favorite people coming up in the next couple of years!\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nBrendan and I were both born at Glens Falls Hospital, and grew up in Queensbury. Fate would have it that we would inevitably meet. Interestingly enough, I grew up next door to Brendan’s Grand Aunt Madeline who used to watch me as a baby. Our paths didn’t cross until I was graduating high school. I was with his sister Brittany at the Relay for Life and Brendan was home visiting from college. About a year later we reconnected on college break at Dango’s (on Maple St) and bonded over chicken wings and good laughs. We had our first ‘official date’ at Rob and Deb’s where I distinctly remember ordering mint chocolate twist ice cream, having one lick and dropping the whole cone.\n\nWhen we were talking about where we wanted to place our own roots, we quickly knew we wanted to stay in the Glens Falls area to be close to family and in hopes that Brendan would be hired at the fire department. It seems like just yesterday, but was almost 10 years ago!\n\nGlens Falls is so up and coming! It seems like there is always a new boutique, restaurant or other interest to check out. I believe this is the ideal location for raising a family. There is so much to explore and enjoy in this tight knit community and I love that. We are growing our family here and look forward to watching the city really flourish with everything new it has to offer!\n\nOn City Living\n\nWe bought our first home in the city in 2014 from a friend’s grandfather. I knew that the search for our home was over the moment we pulled up in front of the house. We have spent the last 7 years making it our own. When we moved in, most of the walls were either wallpapered and/or white lath and plaster. We have remodeled almost every area and it looks so different. Brendan has completed our version of just about every Pinterest project I have found, including a pallet wall in our kitchen and shiplap wall in our bathroom.\n\nOur favorite part of the house is probably our New York Giants “Fan Cave” where we proudly support blue and red in almost every square inch. We love the smell of buffalo chicken dip filling the house with our family and friends screaming at the TV as if we were actually at the game.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nMy perfect Glens Falls day… oooh this is a tricky one, so I’m going to do a split perspective weekday and a weekend version!\n\nMy ideal weekday would start at Spektor for a breakfast sandwich and vanilla almond milk latte before heading to the office. I would hope for a sunny day to enjoy a walk around the city during my lunch break and eat my lunch in City Park with the beautiful tulips. Before heading back to work, I would grab an afternoon pick-me-up from Juicin’ Jar, praying that they have their chocolate ganache donuts - seriously, they are amazing! After finishing work, I would pick up my girls and head back downtown for Take-A-Bite, finished with a Raspberry Cosmo at DTCT!\n\nMy favorite day in the city is Saturday! We load the car first thing in the morning and head straight to the Glens Falls Farmers Market! Tenley especially looks forward to going to the Farmers Market to pick up her Rainbow Bagels from Alchemy Bagel. Other musts are chatting with John at Adirondack Gourmet Coffee, ground beefalo from Lick Springs Farms, Mercy Cheddar from Argyle Cheese Farmer, and our newest favorite Blue Boots Farm habanero ginger jelly - which is the perfect addition to the beefalo burger with cheddar! After the Farmers Market, we would meet my parents for a quick breakfast at Spot Coffee before heading to the Halfway Brook Trail in Queensbury. This tires the girls for their afternoon nap. Afternoons consist of hanging out with family and having a cookout poolside, or going for boat ride on Lake George. We’d end the day with date night at Doc’s for dinner. The staff at Doc’s always goes above and beyond with excellent service to ensure each guest is happy.\n\nTell us about yourselves!\n\nHello! I’m Sean Palladino and my fiancé is Michael Biele. I've worked at Global Foundries as a Logistics Technician for the past year, and before that, as a contractor for another company that works with Global. Michael works for Warren County as a Medicaid Financial Examiner. I moved in with Michael in an apartment in downtown Glens Falls after getting to know him online. Every time I visited, I got to know this area more and more. And fell in love with him and Glens Falls in the process.\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nNeither of us lived in upstate New York growing up. I grew up in a small New Jersey town close to Philadelphia and Michael lived in Rockland County, just outside of New York City. He moved here to be closer to a lot of his college friends.\n\nMichael did grow up visiting the Adirondacks with his family during the summer, from Saratoga Springs and Lake George to Camp of the Woods in Speculator.\n\nWe met online, got to know each other, and visited each other around 2016 before we decided to move in together in 2017.\n\nGlens Falls is an amazing place to live. We can head into the mountains for snow tubing in the winter, hike the trails in the spring, and make a weekend trip to the coast for the beach in the summer. We love the friendly atmosphere and local businesses popping up every month, whether it’s a new restaurant, artist, or shop.\n\nIt took many years to save up enough money to buy a home in 2021. And we got into the market at the most frantic it has ever been! We got incredibly lucky to snag one of the new construction homes in Haviland Cove Park.\n\nAfter living together in a downtown Glens Falls apartment with lots of character, a new construction home is amazing, as we start the next chapter of our lives together. A clean slate home with so much potential!\n\nEver since we met with the builder and signed the house contract, we have been dreaming up ideas for how to decorate and renovate the house and basement. Or cool landscape ideas for relaxing by the Feeder Canal. Yes, our house is right on the Feeder Canal! It’s amazing!\n\nThanks to the Glens Falls Running Club (meets on Tuesday’s at 6pm at Mean Max), I have met lots of people in the area that live around Feeder Bend and the South Street Extension. The neighborhood seems perfect for us; a mix of young and older couples, lots of dog owners, and a small local beach nearby.\n\nSome Glens Falls Favorites\n\nOur favorite thing about Glens Falls is the many local breweries. From Mean Max, Common Roots, Davidson Brothers, and more, there is no shortage of options for a cold beverage within biking or walking distance.\n\nOn a similar note, we wish more people knew about the Glens Falls Distillery right in the Shirt Factory. In fact, it’s always a flurry of surprises whenever we visit the Shirt Factory, with so many small businesses inside.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nOur ideal day around the Glens Falls area would start with breakfast at Spektor Coffee. They have the best bagels, especially with lox and cream cheese. Then we would bike along the Warren County Bikeway toward Lake George, with our backpack loaded with a swimsuit and towel to relax on Million Dollar Beach. After drying off, we would start riding back on the bikeway, stopping at the Log Jam for lunch and to shop at some local shops. We absolutely love the new Candy Space by Chad Rabinovitz!\n\nAfterward, we would continue riding back, stopping for a small ice cream cone from Cooper’s Cave along the bikeway. With our new home along the Feeder Canal, we would transition to heading eastbound on the Feeder Canal Trail and cross the canal toward home, where we would relax and enjoy a cocktail or beer by the fire pit.\n\nOn the Past\n\nWhile we haven’t been in the Glens Falls area long, we remember the first time we met the Cordes family at Davidson Brothers. We were at a Howl Story Slam event and the waitstaff didn’t have enough seats, so they asked if we wouldn’t mind sitting with Janet and John Cordes. They are the nicest people, and Janet is on the board of the Adirondack Theater Festival. At the time, ATF was offering a subscribe it forward program, where season pass subscribers can gift a season pass to someone else. They offered us a subscribe it forward pass and we got to see all the amazing plays and musicals that year, including getting to see Marc Summers in person! They definitely got us hooked on the arts in the area.\n\nOn the Future\n\nFor the future, we would love a rooftop bar. Downtown Glens Falls has lots of great building architecture, and a rooftop bar would allow a birds-eye view of the city.\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nHey! My name is Mle Rubin (MLE the phonetic pronunciation of Emily) and I am an Alternative Floral Designer here in Glens Falls. I started my own floral business, Epithet Floral, last April (2020). I focus primarily on \"Wearable Florals\"; flower crowns, floral jewelry, etc., hence the \"alternative\". I build wearable flowers for weddings, events and just everyday! I'm sure if you see me around town I'll be rocking a crown or floral earrings, my personal favorites.\n\nEpithet is a word that most people don't use in their daily vocabulary, which is why I picked it for my business name. An epithet is a nickname with an adjective in it. For example, Batman is an epithet - you can picture a man dressed as a bat just by reading that. So, a flower crown could be a physical epithet, something to put on and wear and describe yourself to the world.\n\nFlorals and plants are my passion but not the only thing I'm up to these days. I also pick blueberries for Winney's Farm (this is my 6th summer!), sling slices at Giuseppe's Pizzeria in Lake George, hostess at Doc's Restaurant, and do freelance floral work for Renaissance Floral Design in Albany.\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nI grew up and went to high school in Hartford, New York, and moved from there to Glens Falls in 2013. I remember growing up with this city and watching it blossom into the awesome place it is now. I love being a part of this community and participating in all of the events, from live music to LARAC to Taste of the North Country to Balloon Fest.\n\nGrowing up in Hartford, we had to drive everywhere if we wanted to do something. I love living close to downtown Glens Falls because I can walk! A few of my friends also live within walking distance of me. I know I sound crazy but I love to just have the power to walk around.\n\nI love the community here. I especially love the restaurant industry community here. We all know each other and I love being able to go out to any restaurant downtown and people know my name. And vice versa when industry people come into Doc's and Giuseppe's. It's a big family!\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nTo describe a perfect day in Glens Falls I need to preface it by saying that I wake up early...every day. So I am lucky enough to be able to squeeze the most out of the day. If I'm not headed straight to Winney’s to pick blueberries and I know I have the night off from the restaurants, I start slow.\n\nFirst step: explain to my dogs how much I am obsessed with them. Trip is my 8 year old Great Dane and he has no clue he weighs 160 lbs. He thinks he is teeny tiny! Braum is my 5 year old German Shepard/Malamute mix and he is half the size of Trip but he’s my head of security. My cat is rolling her eyes at us from the corner of the bed.\n\nAfter a lazy morning checking on each of my plants, sipping some tea, and maybe making a random flower crown (because, why not?), it's time for caffeine, so I head to Spektor. My order is an espresso for here and a large Happy Happens iced tea to go. I love to sit and chat with my friends that work there while I sip my espresso, maybe grab a Chronicle and sift through.\n\nA perfect day means perfect weather, so I am definitely going paddleboarding. I'll hit up Glen Lake for a few hours to swim, read and listen to WEQX. Their Sunday Rewind and Retro Lunch are my favorite shows.\n\nIf you know me, you know I love a good lunch time beer, so I'll head to one of my favorite spots, The Full Moon. After that, I’ll head home for a fire with friends and order an early dinner from Angelina's Pizza. I get a large cheese and add a little Frank's Hot Sauce and blue cheese to dip it in.\n\nNow it’s time to wander back downtown for some live music I can dance to (probably wearing a flower crown) either at the Park Theater, Downtown Social or Grateful Den.\n\nAfter, if I'm feeling mixed drinks, Doc's is the place (I know I work there and I am biased, but they are the best). The Summer Sangria is my current favorite.\n\nBasically my perfect day is eating and drinking my way around Glens Falls, wearing flowers on my head and listening to music!\n\nOn the Past\n\nBalloon Fest has always been a favorite of mine, from going to Crandall Park and the Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport with my parents and siblings when we were kids to taking my dogs \"Balloon Chasing\" in my Jeep these last few years. We love balloon season and look forward to it every year.\n\nOn the Future\n\nI think downtown needs a cool plant shop! Nothing crazy, just small and eclectic, and if they also sold beer or cider that would be ideal. Somewhere I can wander and touch plants, sip a beverage and spend all of my money!\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nMy name is Rachel Dutra. I am a former English teacher turned restauranteur / spiceologist. I am the co-owner and operator (with my husband Dave) of Rachel's Cafe and Spice Co on Warren Street in Glens Falls. In 2018 we closed our former restaurant, East End Eatery, and opened Rachel's in an effort to have a schedule that was more compatible with being a parent. Our son, Elias, is 5 and will start Kindergarten in the fall at SMSA! We recently opened a second business, Winklepickers, in our hometown of Lake George.\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nI grew up in Lake George. My parents bought an apartment building on the East Side of Glens Falls and I ended up there since my mom wanted me out of the house because my beloved cat was destroying her beloved house. I had just graduated from college and it was a perfect fit for my lifestyle. Over the years, I’ve lived in multiple apartments in the building and when we opened a restaurant downstairs I eventually ended up running it. I then made the big move to the house next door and lived there for 12 years.\n\nWe recently purchased our first home! After renting for so long it is nice to finally own something. It is a whopping 1/2 mile down the road and that actually put us in Queensbury, but we very much still feel like a part of Glens Falls. It is secluded and has a pool which our 5 year old uses everyday. We don't vacation much so we treat every Sunday like a vacation, and this house and yard is perfect for it - complete with an outdoor fireplace and room to run. We are super happy with our little slice of the universe. The house is super old and some days it feels a bit like that movie The Money Pit, but we are learning as we go!\n\nSome Glens Falls Favorites\n\nIt's kind of strange, but my favorite thing about Glens Falls is the Christmas decorations. I get up early to go to yoga at Hot Yoga Queensbury, and driving through the city when it's snowing and the lights are twinkling is the best thing ever. Until I get out of my car. I'm not a huge fan of winter.\n\nI honestly believe the hidden gem of Glens Falls is SMSA [St. Mary’s-St. Alphonsus]. This amazing little school is right under our noses and until I had a kid I had no idea the amazing place that it is. I wish more people knew that it is an incredible place to learn.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nOh man, I don't get many days off. But, I will tell you that the margaritas at Raul's are perfect for girl's night with my bestie and Dave and I enjoy grabbing a beer at Mean Max. That's the extent of my venturing out. Between the business and the kid I don't get out much!\n\nOn the Past\n\nOnce upon a time my amazing friend had a store called Sterling and Co. I miss it every day. I was constantly downtown, going to Tilley's (which I don't think was called that at the time), hitting up The Bullpen, enjoying Wallabee's way too much, heading to Siam Thai for amazing food, and of course Red Fox Books. It was the heyday in GF for me.\n\nOn the Future\n\nI’d love to see a book store in Glens Falls for sure. I know the internet and technology has made times difficult for them but I really miss having one in town. Also, a tour (self guided or otherwise) of the historic homes and buildings. Glens Falls is rich with history!\n\nHi! My name is Jordan Cleavland. I am the owner of Baked by Jordan. I spend most of my time baking yummy cupcakes out of Kelly’s Roots where my cupcakes are available to purchase weekly! I have perfected some of the most unique cupcake flavors over the last 6 years and have been a part of so many special celebrations. My favorite flavor? Funfetti Cookie Dough.\n\nWhen I am not covered in buttercream and sprinkles, I am a part time pediatric dental assistant at The Pediatric Dental Group of New York located on Broad Street in Glens Falls. I’ve worked alongside the kindest doctors and staff for 2.5 years. Flossing everyday really is that important.\n\nI have been married to the most driven and supportive husband for the last 4 years and we have a 12 year old chocolate lab named Gunner who is simply the very best.\n\nOn Life in Glens Falls\n\nI grew up in South Glens Falls and my husband Scott grew up in Glens Falls. When Scott returned home after a year long deployment to Iraq in 2016 we knew it was time to plant some roots of our own. We wanted a place to call our home. Scott and I purchased a two-family home in Glens Falls from our best friend who was looking to sell. We decided to call the main first level home and we rented out the upstairs apartment to one of my lifelong friends. Living with your fiancé and dog and having your best friend just a flight of outside stairs away is the literal dream!\n\nScott and I quickly got to work renovating the entire first floor. With Scott having the muscles and knowledge and I having the creativity and a vision we make a pretty great team. We tackled gutting the kitchen, adding new flooring, and painting until our hands cramped. Tips for surviving a renovation include: take out, living less than a mile from Lowes and understanding that Chip and Joanna Gaines have an entire crew working beside them. And when things get really hard and messy, it’s ok to call Mom and Dad for help. My Dad is so patient and handy and my Mom brings the humor, snacks and magic erasers. We are very lucky.\n\nAs the weather got warmer, we moved the projects outside, where we added a fence, some beautiful landscaping and my very first garden. Gardening has turned into one of my favorite hobbies and Gunner is always close by laying in the shady grass keeping watch on the neighborhood. Something about the soil in Glens Falls makes for the prettiest and biggest blooms!\n\nOur first home in Glens Falls holds some of our most cherished memories. I got ready for our wedding in that house and it was the home that we hosted our first Thanksgiving dinner in at the dining room table that Scott and I built together.\n\nWe now rent out both floors of our beloved first home in Glens Falls to close friends.\n\nIn January of 2020 Scott and I purchased our dream home in South Glens Falls. We still spend our time working on house projects, with our most current and favorite project being a nursery for our sweet baby girl due early this fall.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nLet me describe to you my perfect day spent in Glens Falls. First stop is grabbing two Lavender Lemonades at Spot Coffee. One Lavender Lemonade for myself and one for my gal Emily Heym at En Pointe Hair Studio who is about to work her magic on my long blonde hair.\n\nHair is in two french braids and it is time to put on my apron to set up a beautiful cupcake wedding display at one of my favorite local venues, The Queensbury Hotel.\n\nAfter I have every cupcake placed perfectly on display and the beautiful florals are on the cake it is time to re fuel. The Aloha Smoothie Bowl (no banana please) from Kelly’s Roots is screaming my name.\n\nRight around the corner from Kelly’s Roots is Rosewood Studio where I would spend the rest of the afternoon adding more ink to my floral tattoo from Glen Underwood.\n\nTake out from Siam Thai is Scott and I’s favorite go to dinner option. Give us all the crab ragoons!\n\nThe evening ends in a round of darts at Mean Max and a quick stop at Cooper’s Cave Ice Cream window and we are home and sharing a vanilla cone with rainbow sprinkles with Gunner all before 8pm.\n\nTell us about yourself!\n\nI have been an Instructor in the Summer Enrichment Program at SUNY Adirondack for 32 summers. It is my favorite place to teach. I have been teaching a mock trial course entitled \"Mystery Solved\" in which students take on roles of judges, witnesses, suspects, and attorneys for so long, that I recently taught a student whose mother was a student in one of the early incarnations of the course. We have been solving these literary and historical mysteries for about 30 of my summers there. I am retired from WSWHE BOCES, but I still do occasional enrichment courses for them, and I have been doing special courses for Saratoga Library under the heading of \"Bizarre Science\" for several years as well.\n\n[Editors Note: To find out more about the Summer Enrichment Program for students entering grades 4-10, or to sign up, click here!]\n\nWhen not teaching, I enjoy reading, especially in science periodicals and classic literature. I also play the guitar and compose songs. I am anxious to return from the world of virtual teaching to live teaching, especially for SUNY Adirondack. We have been unable to conduct my video production course, \"Lights, Camera, Action\" for the past two summers due to the pandemic.\n\nOn Life In and Around Glens Falls\n\nPrior to my teaching career, I worked at Health and Human Services for a number of years, and following my training in Albany, I was assigned to the Glens Falls District Office. It was my first choice for geographic areas, though I was initially told that few people get their first selection. This was back in the 1970's. I met my wife, who is a Queensbury native, after moving up to to the area, and we have been married since 1982. We own a home in Queensbury, not far from West Mountain. We purchased the land and had a home built amid the lovely pines.\n\nSome Glens Falls Favorites\n\nMy wife and I love history, art, and architecture and thoroughly enjoy The Chapman Museum, The Hyde Collection and the variety of excellent antique stores in the area, especially Glenwood Manor. We have also enjoyed and personally promoted the area's connection to The French and Indian War. In fact, I have taught a course entitled \"The French and Indian War in My Backyard\" which helpes extoll the virtues of Cooper's Cave, Fort Edward, Lake George, Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point. I encourage friends, relatives and my students to tour each of these important sites that we are blessed to have.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day\n\nMy wife and I are foodies who enjoy the wonderful area restaurants and count The Harvest, The Talk of The Town, and Queen of Harts among our favorites. I have a very unconventional version of the perfect day in the Glens Falls area. I choose that long-time favorite of students and teachers alike - the snow day! It begins with the news of a day off as we watch the snow pile up on our trees surrounding our home. Then after the roads clear up, it is out to lunch at New Way Lunch or Steve's Place. Afterwards, a walk along the by now navigable downtown streets, and then home in time to watch the snow cascading beautifully from the burdened pines in our back yard. It is a quiet, serene magnificence.\n\nOn the Past\n\nI miss several wonderful memories of Glens Falls, including Young's Restaurant and their remarkable Chinese food, and of course, the charming Empire Theatre. However, what I miss most is the two Double-A baseball teams we once enjoyed, the Glens Falls White Sox and the Glens Falls Tigers. I remember bringing our daughter to the games at East Field, and rooting for many of the stars who made it to the Major Leagues, including Ron Kittle and John Smoltz. Those games had a hometown feel that it is impossible to replicate.\n\nOn the Future\n\nI would certainly like to see the return of classic music shows to the Civic Center, and an organized group to effectively and specifically promote the rich 18th century historical legacy of the area. We need to reinforce an interest in the rich historical tapestry that is the Glens Falls area."
