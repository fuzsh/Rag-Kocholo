        "text": "The Biden administration has established a migrant encampment at Floyd Bennett Field, in the Gateway National Recreation Area in New York City (NYC). The House Committee on Natural Resources held a hearing late last year to hear directly from local officials, address their concerns and condemn the unprecedented action by the Biden administration to use national park land for a migrant encampment. Westerman and other Republican members traveled to the site in September 2023 and saw firsthand how access to this incredible resource is being denied to NYC residents by turning it into a migrant encampment.\n\nFloyd Bennett Field was evacuated due to hazardous weather conditions in early 2024, and migrants were moved to a local high school. Classes for students were cancelled as migrants camped out in the school. Concerns about hazardous conditions were raised weeks before by members during the committee hearing, yet were blatantly ignored by administration officials.\n\nOn January 22, 2024, Westerman and Gosar sent a letter to Mayorkas expressing their concern over the policies at Floyd Bennett Field and requesting information on how these decisions were made and what role the Department of Homeland Security played.\n\nOn Nov. 30, 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 5283, which would ensure the Biden administration’s egregious policies don’t set a dangerous precedent. The legislation prevents federal agencies from housing migrants in national parks, forests and other federal lands operated by federal land management agencies. The legislation also prevents the use of funds for housing illegal immigrants on any land under the jurisdiction of the federal land management agencies and revokes the lease between the City of New York and the National Park Service that established the migrant encampment at Floyd Bennett Field.\n\nLegislation\n\nH.R. 5283, the Protecting our Communities from Failure to Secure the Border Act of 2023, Introduced by U.S. Rep.
