        "text": "1914\n\nAppendix and index to Volume 18 of the Buffalo Historical Society Publications Reprinted by Cornell U.\n\n1914-1918 World War I: Some individuals are able to profit from the war. Prior to 1914 most the coal tar dyes used in America were imported from Germany. Following the Allied blockade of Germany, Americans began to turn to domestic dye makers. None benefited more from this turn of events than the Schoellkopf's National Aniline and Chemical Company, the largest dye plant in the country. National Aniline got even bigger during the war as coal dyes were used increasingly for the manufacture of high explosives and poison gases.\n\nW.W.I and African Americans: For years the traditional source of cheap labor for the steel mills of Lackawanna had been eastern Europe. In 1910 over half of the work force was Slavic. The war ends this, however, and in their place come a rapidly growing number of southern blacks who have begun to trek northward to Chicago, Cleveland, Lackawanna, and the other industrial centers of the Northeast.\n\nThere had always been some blacks in Lackawanna. Never a part of the regular labor force, blacks had lived on the fringes of the town, working periodically, primarily as maintenance men and as outdoor laborers in and around the mill. Their only break came during strikes when, if they could survive the bitter and brutal responses of the strikers, they found work, however temporary, inside the plant itself.\n\nThis dreadful and divisive situation began to change during the war. Now, for the first time, blacks, as a result of an increasingly serious labor shortage, were entering the labor force. Now, however, they came not as janitors and strikebreakers but rather as bona fide industrial workers.\n\nBuildings erected:\n\n452 Parkside Ave.\n\nClement House/Red Cross Building\n\nAssumuption RC Church\n\nConcrete Central grain elevator - the largest grain elevator in the world - built.\n\nJohn G. Sattler - a local real-estate tycoon and the same Sattler who owned the late department store - commissions the Sattler Theatre at 516 Broadway, near Jefferson. The architect is Henry L. Spann who will later design the Shea's North Park Theatre, which still (2002) operates on Hertel Avenue.\n\nArchitect Henry L. Spann also designs the Abbott Theatre which is a 498-seat nickelodeon built by James S. and Florence D. Savage.\n\nThe Circle Theatre, at 444 Connecticut Street, also opens its doors for business. In early 1962 Fred Keller will lease the theatre and rename it the Circle Arts, but a year or so later he will lose the lease and move to the Varsity Theatre on Bailey and takes the Circle Arts name with him.\n\n1915\n\nAppendix and Index to Volume 19 of the Buffalo Historical Society Publications Reprinted by Cornell U.\n\nThe area bounded by Michigan, Jefferson, Broadway, and William Streets has lost most of its original German population, and is now inhabited primarily by Jewish immigrants from Russia and Poland. For them, as well as for the other immigrant groups who have lived there, the East Side neighborhood is only a temporary home.\n\nJewish-American History in Buffalo Illustrations and history\n\nGlenn H. Curtiss comes to Buffalo and rents the Thomas Flyer Automobile Manufacturing Plant on Niagara Street. This is where he develops the R-model airplane which will be the forerunner of the famous Curtiss \"Jenny.\" Curtiss soon moves to a plant he builds on Churchill Street. He also rents several other facilities and ultimately builds the plant at 2050 Elmwood Avenue.\n\nAt the close of World War 1, Curtiss will build four flying boats capable of trans-ocean flight. These boats will be the first NC series, and the NC-4 well be eventually successful in circling the globe.\n\nThe Aerospace Industry in Buffalo, NY Time lines and illustrations\n\nGlenn H.

Curtiss employs 18,000 at its Buffalo facility and 3,000 at its Hammondsport, New York location. They produce 10,000 aircraft during World War I, more than 100 in a single week.\n\nThe Aerospace Industry in Buffalo, NY Time lines and illustrations\n\nGlenn H. Curtiss: Founderof The American Aviation Industry Includes many photos\n\nThe Curtiss \"Jenny,\" America's most famous World War I airplane, was developed by combining the best features of the Curtiss \"J\" and \"N\" models. The JN-3 was modified in 1916 to improve its performance and redesignated the JN-4. With America's entry into World War I on April 6, 1917, the Signal Corps began ordering large quantities of JN-4s, and by the time production was terminated after the Armistice, more than 6,000 had been delivered, the majority of them JN-4D.\n\nThe Jenny was generally used for primary flight training, but some were equipped with machine guns and bomb racks for advanced training. After World War I, hundreds were sold on the civilian market.\n\nGeorge Birge, the president of the Pierce-Arrow Company, sells the company to a group of investors from New York City for $16.5 million. Local managers, most of whom had worked with the company since 1901 are immediately dismissed and replaced by a new team from New York.\n\nSensing that a dramatic increase in production is the only way to compete in the rapidly expanding automobile industry. the new owners replace the traditional Pierce Arrow method of team production with an assembly line. The nature of work changes, too, for as mechanization and the assembly line are introduced. skilled work which comprised nearly three-fourths of all jobs in the automobile industry in 1910,declines drastically in the twenties, as the emphasis shifts to speed and efficiency in production.\n\nGeorge K. Birge Illustrations, history\n\nPan-American Building Committee List, links\n\n1920\n\nThe lower East Side is to Buffalo what it is to New York City: the neighborhood of entry for every one of the city's immigrants. For them, as well as for the other immigrant groups who have lived there, the East Side neighborhood is only a temporary home.\n\nJewish: During the 1920s many of the Jewish residents of the East Side, some of whom have been there for less than ten years, begin to move to newer and nicer neighborhoods in more northerly sections of Buffalo. See Jewish-American History in Buffalo\n\nAfrican-Americans: In 1920, 4,500 blacks move to Buffalo to fill the labor shortage; in 1930, 13,500 will migrate to buffalo. Virtually all move to the lower East Side, where there had been a small but consistent black community since the late 1820s.\n\nIn the 1920s, responding to the needs of the growing population, black-owned enterprises suddenly proliferate. Hotels, nightclubs, funeral parlors, cleaners, drug stores, restaurants, candy stores, saloons, and a Negro baseball team are some of them. Examples:\n\nSherman Walker's Funeral Home\n\nRuth-Patrick Drug Company\n\nMy Cab Company\n\nMcAvoy Theater\n\nSelf-help groups within the black community also flourish during the twenties. One of the earliest is the Colored Musicians' Union of Buffalo, founded in 1917 by black musicians who have been denied\n\nmembership in the white musicians' local. In addition, there are\n\na grocery cooperative\n\nseveral Negro lodges\n\nthe Negro Businessmen's League\n\nthe American Colored Workmen's League\n\na chapter of Marcus Garvey's United Negro Improvement Association\n\nthe Big Brothers' Association (founded by older, established East Side blacks to help ease the settlement problems of the new southern migrants), and\n\nthe Michigan Avenue YMCA, built in 1926 by a local black architect named John R. Brent.\n\nIn the 1920s, while there is no black-owned bank, the community does boast several newspapers: The Buffalo Enterprise, the Buffalo American, the Buffalo Criterion and the Voice. Abandoned by every other ethnic group that had ever lived there, the lower East Side has remained black to this day. - Source: Mark Goldman, \"High Hopes: The Rise and Decline of Buffalo, New York.\" Pub. by State U. of New York Press, Albany, 1983\n\nCynthia Van Ness, In Search of Buffalo's First Professional African-American Architect: Some Preliminary Findings History, illustrations\n\nThroughout the 1920s Buffalo's economy is dynamic and diversified, healthy and strong. The older industries - grain, steel, and lumber - employ more people and produce a larger finished product than ever before.\n\nAssociated Buffalo Architects Inc., a collective of local architects, was organized in 1920 with Charles S. Wood as President. Such prominent Buffalo architects as E. B. Green, Duane Lyman, Frederick Backus and Max Beierl were members, assisting in the collaboration on each school building design. The Association contracted with the Board of Education for the design and supervision of school building construction. From 1921 to 1925 the Association constructed public schools no. 3, 11, 31, 45, 64, 65, 66, 68, 70 and Bennett High School.\n\nC. 1920, cement companies that laid out sidewalks switched from identifying brass markers to stamps.\n\nHague, John Maxfield. History at Our Feet: Buffalo Pavement Markers Essay, illustrations\n\n15,000 people worke in twelve automobile factories\n\nThe 1920s see the rise of the chemical industry in Buffalo and nearby Niagara Falls. Within a period of a few years a whole new industry is born. Spawning companies whose impersonal names make no reference to either place or person - Carborundum, Niacet, Canadium, Vanadium, and the Alox Chemical Corporation (Hooker, named after the company's founder, is an exception) - the petrochemical industry, located in Niagara Falls, employs over fifteen hundred people by the end of the decade.\n\nThey choose Niagara Falls because that is where the electrical power is. Initially developed by Jacob Schoellkopf, the German immigrant who had made his first fortune in the tanning business, the business of producing and selling electrical power at Niagara Falls has become a gigantic enterprise by the 1920s.\n\nNothing. indeed, is more responsible for the accelerated development of the Buffalo region as an industrial center than the availability of cheap and plentiful electrical power . - Source: Mark Goldman, \"High Hopes: The Rise and Decline of Buffalo, New York.\" Pub. by State U. of New York Press, Albany, 1983, p. 216 Buildings erected:\n\n531 Linwood Avenue\n\nRalph G.

The basic line of three chassis, the 38hp, the 48hp, and the huge 66hp, are replaced with a single product. First introduced in 1920 as the Series 32, minor changes in late 1921 transform the car into the Series 33.\n\nThe Series 33 remains Pierce-Arrow's flagship model through the mid-twenties, continuing in production through early 1926. It will be replaced in 1927 and 1928 with the Series 36, which will share much of the same chassis, but will have new sheet metal. G. Elias & Bro., Inc., an established lumber company, builds airplanes on Seneca Street in Buffalo during the early 1920s. The company is the first to build a cantilever biplane and an aerodynamic twin-engined night bomber. They also pioneer the use of duraluminum in Americana aircraft, and introduce the swinging engine mount and the detachable power plant. Elias will be best known in the industry as a producer of propellers.

The widening of the roadway from forty feet to sixty feet was accompanied by the laying of new sewer lines, the placement of traffic signals, and the installation at one-hundred-foot intervals of 1500-candle-power electric light standards. The modernization of the avenue, however, occasioned the destruction of most of the splendid elm trees that had lined the thoroughfare, two rows on each side, since even before Olmsted's day. The effort by many citizens both on and off the avenue -- including artist Charles Burchfield, who had come to town in 1923 to work in the Birge wallpaper factory -- to stay the massacre of the trees was to no avail. ... It was the first of many preservation battles that were doomed to fail in a city that, like many others, came to pride itself on the destruction of its distinctive charms in the name of jobs and progress.\n\n- Source: \"Delaware Avenue,\" by Francis R.

The law is a direct assault on the eastern European Catholic and Jewish communities in cities throughout the Northeast.
