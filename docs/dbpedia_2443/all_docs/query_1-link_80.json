        "text": "The Dobyns-Bennett High School Marching Band is one of the most respected high school band programs in Tennessee and in recent years has gained national prominence. It has an established tradition of musical excellence and achievement that has been fostered for over eighty years. The 236-member-strong band is also the largest band in the state of Tennessee.\n\nProfessor S.T. “Fess” Witt came to Kingsport from Norton, Virginia to organize Dobyns-Bennett’s first school band in 1926. For many years the Dobyns-Bennett Band had a tradition of parading through the streets of downtown Kingsport before football games to excite residents for the“big game.” During World War II, the band would gather to send off Kingsport Servicemen as they left for service. The band would also participate in a parade to honor the school’s graduates every spring.\n\nToday the Dobyns-Bennett band program is comprised of a football marching band and color guard, competitive marching band and color guard, three concert bands, and a percussion ensemble. Everyone in the band program participates in the football marching band which performs a half-time show designed to entertain our football fans at both home and away games. The football marching band also participates in local and national parades. Their competitive marching band and color guard members are selected based on musical and marching abilities and their desire to achieve a high degree of artistic excellence. Their shows are performed in local, regional, and national competitive venues.\n\nHistory with the Macy's Parade[]"
