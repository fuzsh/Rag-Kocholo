        "text": "Cecelia Does anyone remember south division street? I know it is no longer there but I lived there back in 1951 1952 and I am looking for an old friend her name was Barbara smelsinger ( I am not sure if her last name is still that or if she married ,I was only 12 when we moved away to ohio . We were very close and very poor and took comfort in each others company.I grew up in the projects on East Ferry St. near Grider St... Went to school 62, then across the Street to Genesee Humboldt High, then off to Kensington High School. Graduated in 1968...Use to go to swimming pool off Grider St. Remember Kudson Dairy, and the pretzel factory in that area...There was a bakery across the street from the projects I believe called Heldmans, and just near that was a past the railroad tracks was Twin Fair...Oh what memories in good ole Buffalo. Remember the museum of Science, near Humboldt Parkway, and the round swimming pool there. Playing in the Ferry Projects with all the kids in the courts bring back so many memories of having snoball fights with the kids, iceskating, making igloos, going to parks, shopping at IGA and the butcher shop, and Agies store, Mr Weis's store, Shearers store, So many down the street to go get 1cent candy and then there was St. Matthews Church...Loved is all and still miss it. Hi, I grew up in the Kensington Area, Roosevelt Ave between suffolk and Bailey. Went to PS 78 and graduated from Kensington HS in 1967. There used to be a candy store on the corner of Roosevelt and Bailey owned by a Greek family. They made their own chocolates. They had a son named Van who played the violin. Next door used to be the Pink Poodle Lounge. There was a kind of candy store, lunch place across from the police station on Bailey ave and Comstock. Wicks, I think it was called. I would skate sometime in the rink. Loved that neighborhood. We felt so safe. I would go out an play after school and come home when the street light went on.

Rick, I came upon this page when I was googling Gressman's Bakery , Buffalo. Are you Billy and Priscilla's son? That is the only Rick I can think of, whose grandparents would have owned it. Along with Mary, Kitty and Theresa. I am Kevin and Shirley Mahoney's daughter, Mary's grand daughter, Mary Ellen. We still get back to Buffalo. Heading there at the end of the month with Kevin to see his sister Marilyn and a bunch of cousins. Really miss that bakery, hanging out in the apartments and Rawlins street. Lots of great memories. I remember the German Days Parade on Genesee St. when I was a kid. My Granparents owned Gressman's Bakery on Genesee St. Must have been 1962 or there about. Haven't lived in Buffalo for many years but the best childhood memories are from this time. My other granparents ran concessions at several locations when I was a kid. Ice skating rink at Roosevelt Park. Cazenovia in the summer when the pool was open, even had a restaurant called the Busy Bee I think it may have been in Amherst on Main next to a miniature golf. Also did the auto shows at the old Auditorium. Too young to remember the location. Also had grandparents that owned Roetzer's candy store but not sure of that location. Maybe around Baily and Genesee St.Born in 1948,Lived at 677 Riley until 1966.Went to school59 and Genesee Humboldt. Kerns hardware at corner next to Zimmermans. Texaco gas station across the street .Lived there during the construction of the expressway and miss walking to play golf at Delaware park via the tree lined Humboldt park. Kreme Kraft was favorite hangout on Fillmore Ave. A lifetime was spent playing tennis, swimming and skating at the casino by the wading pool. Old men playing cards at the park was a daily event. A neighborhood where everyone knew you and adults were respected. St MM school yard was another safe play to play under the watchful eye of the rectory. Close friends included the Burns,Szeflers,Daverns,Wienholtz, Paske's, Chudy's. What wonderful memories. We walked to Sattlers on Broadway and to the stores on Jefferson without any fear. Those days are gone but not forgotten.To Lindsey: I lived at 32 Woepple and I knew that tavern on the corner of Fillmore and Woepple well. For some reason I remember it as Pat's Tavern, but Schuh's sounds familiar too. My best friend, Mike Massey, lived at 1414 Fillmore, about 3 doors down from the Tavern. Well Mike's grandfather could always be found at the tavern. So when we needed some change to buy candy at Stanley's Deli next door we would visit grandpa Massey at his stool at the tavern. Most of the time he had been there a while, had several beers and would give us his spare change to get us out of his hair. This was around 1961 to 1967. I was only 5 years old in 1961, but I clearly remember our frequent visits to Schuh's tavern.I lived in Buffalo every Saturday (in my mind) I took the Bus from Toronto $8 return walked all down Main Street from the Bus Terminal into Neisners and the other Department Stores, there was a record store next to the Bus Station on main.It had a live group in the window Saturdays. My favourite DJ was Tommy Shannon on WKBW which I heard at home in Toronto daily on an old tube radio! Great days. Oh! yes I walked east of main to Herb Ross's great R&B record store. Great memories wish I could repeat it but all those are gone!I remember ice skating at humboldt park and then when it was summer, my grandmother taking walks at 10 or 11pm.and sitting on a park bench with her watching a crew fill the water area for swimming the next hot day. I remember walking on sycamore and rother streets to kantys grocery store, caseys variety store, smolinskis bakery, mroz meat market, newmans tavern for fish fry and church at the cathedral. And so much to see and do at the broadway market on weekends. Live animals displayed on holidays. The broadway shopping district was packed with shoppers going to sattlers, kobackers, nisners, grants, potts furniture, modern home & auto store and various jewelers and small variety shops. ... so many memories....I love these......was born in Buffalo and lived there until I was 27. Two of my friends went to work for Liberty Bank, right out of High School as comptometer operators..\n\nMy Dad worked at City Hall and I went to work for the Telephone Company on Franklin\n\nSt. When I went back there 3 years ago, I couldn't believe how Main St. has been ruined. I used to ride the NFT to Shelton Square with my Mom and then walk up and down Main St. holiday shopping. Main Street was busy and a lot of fun then.True statement but I am hoping that someday when I either retire or inherit enough-either of which comes first.\n\nI will move my wife and I to Buffalo!\n\nThats right - its a reverse migration if you will becuse the city still has beautiful parts - the people are the nicest in the US- and as far as cost you cant beat it.\n\nDestination? Somewhere along Parkside but definately downtown.\n\nGod only knows when but THAT is my retirement plan and looking forward to that day (I am now 57) and move back to a place we know.\n\nI tell my friends its THE PARIS OF NYS!I love this site- I love Buffalo and envy those lucky ones that grew up in the 40`s to early 70`s in it!\n\nThose were really \"WONDER YEARS\" of special times now long gone from society and while some great might buildings remain - way too many have gone ( I commented on War Memorial Stadium page and hope my comments make it).\n\nI guess same could be said for the great people themselves in those \"wonder years\" who have either left the area and or are gone.\n\nIts great sites like this that make you realize how great the internet can be.\n\nThanks for the memories Karl and thanks to the great people of Buffalo for their wonderful comments taking those of us back to what was once a great city and place to live.Oh wow!! Home sweet home-what memories. I was born and raised on the east side off Sycamore St. on Kosciuszko St. The old house is torn down now and the whole street looks like a ghost town-to think of the happy times being a child rowing up there. I'm 67. Went to PS 58, then PS44 on Broadway and then East High. I remember those walks to Sattler's, Neisners, GC Murphy's, the Broadway Market and the list goes on. Such fond, fond precious memories of days gone by. I was happy to stumble on this site and see the pictures of the beautiful buildings Buffalo has-so sad and painful really to see what has happened to a once thriving city. Thanks for posting these for us loyal die hard Buffalonians to see and relive. This will always be HOME to me.great site grew up on Humboldt pkwy between Sidney and Interpark Went to St Francis De Sales grammar School and graduated in 1955. Went out to dinner a few years ago with classmates and our 8th grade principle Sister Marie Denise.(recently passed)\n\nPlayed baseball, football in the park. Remember the voting booths and the horses who brought them every election season. Today where all of this is a big old trench\n\nLived next door to my great Uncle who was the Archetect of City Hall- He was tyhe Dietel of Dietel and Wade.\n\nEveryone played together: I remeber the Murphys, Sue L Sandra M, Frank B -Fettos , Dash's on Fillmore, the Busy Bee. The times were slow and easy as compared to today.I was born in 1951 in Buffalo,N.Y. at Lafayette General Hospital on Lafayette. Wow, the memories of Buffalo will stay with me forever. I remember watching them build P.S. 38 and my mother telling me that is where I was going to go to school. I remember playing in the streets till the street lights came on and then if I wasn't home I would hear my mother calling me. Wish I could hear her voice again. Going to the ice rink to skate almost every weekend...snowball fights...building igloos with my best friend. Nobody locked their doors and friends and family came and went all the time. Christmas was so magical and you had to have snow . Hanging out at Santis on Vermont Street and putting a bag of peanuts in my pop. Adults were trusted and looked up to...it was such a wonderful time...we all were skinny kids cause we never went home except to eat. I live in the South now but will always be a Buffalonian in my heart!Wayne and Robin....first Robin...I hung out at Watts restaurant all the time....and it seems to me I only remember one waitress...her name was Alice. Wayne...Lily's was an ice cream parlor on the corner of E. Ferry and Fillmore....Schuh's tavern was on Woeple and Fillmore...Zimmerman's deli was near Urban and Fillmore....across from St. Mary Magdalene school...Please anyone knowing of people that went to St. M.M....please email me...especially if it was a graduating class of 62..63 (that was the year I graduated)..or 61 or 64. email is lin71124@aol.comI recently found out that there is a general reunion for all students of St. Mary Magdalene school. One of the girls I graduated with in 1963 just found me on facebook....and she was telling me that The Protocol restaurant has this reunion every Sept. I will find out more details and pass it along.....I grew up on Winslow....hung out at Watts restaurant.....and kreme kraft...went to school with the girl who's parents owned Kraft.....the Delmar family.

Also remember the Burgards...they lived on Urban St...You can find me on facebook as Linda Massey Szefler.....would love to attend one of the reunions at the Protocol.Thank You Karl for the wonderfull pictures, it does bring back memories. I was born in Buffalo 1955. Spent most of my life there until I moved away in 1995. I remember like it was yesterday, what the city use to look like and all the streets. How busy everything was with the many business, and industry that are now gone. Now when I go on google, maps, to the street and look around, I ask myself, what happened to this building, or this business, or these homes, that use to be here and there. Sometimes, I wish I could go back in time, and make a movie of how it use to be. Four years ago was my first time to go to Buffalo.We were going to Canada. Your city has some of the most beautiful buildings I have ever seen. The one that I shall never forget,because of it's colorful beauty , best I can tell, is the top of the City Hall building. I did not get to make a picture because I didn't see it soon enough. We were crossing a bridge and I missed it. Looking at these pictures it must have been the Top of the city Hall. Does anyone know whereI might get a colored picture of that building? I would love to visit the whold city. We were on a trip for our 45 wedding anniversary. Thank you for posting these pictures. God Bless Buffalo and God Bless America!I was born in Buffalo 70 years ago. (Did I just say that!!!) I have used Google map street view to look for the house I was brought up in on Goodyear Ave. It looks more like a crack house like the rest of the neighborhood.! It is a shame that this city has been abandoned by the liberal politicians. Hillary did this city a disservice. Gone is the Jaffa sauce that Ted's Hots served under the peace bridge (although they are in Sloan on Harlem Rd. and in Tempe Arizona). Also the hot dog stand in Maryville also seved Jaffa sauce, the clam bars, Bailos hot roast beef on weck. Genesee theater was mentioned but also Baily Theater is lost and no longer there. Too bad no photos of Offerman Stadium exist. War Memorial I believe was used in the film \"The Natural\".\n\nAs Bob Hope's iconic song says \"Thanks for the Memories\"Born in this beautiful bit dying city. Kindergarten at school 58, then off to the nuns at Queen of the most Holy Rosary school on Sycamore and Sobieski. Later went to\n\nSt. Bartholomews as we moved to stevens street. Miss the swimming pool at Humbolt Park (is it still used??). Nu-Way and Zents bakery on Delevan. Fishing at Delaware park. Sure miss the local theatres, Gennesee,Grand, and others where saturday afternoons were spent. But most I miss peering into the windows of those wonderful department stores at Christmas...watching the automated Santa and riendeer. I think the train station will determine the outcome of the city...if it goes they may as well flatten the whole place. Enough rant....love to all who stayed and survived....and condolences to the many that trioed to make it work, but failed.I am so glad that I was born in Buffalo. Dad was a policeman, so We had to live in the city...something about \"response time.\" My neighborhood was Cambridge Ave. I wen tto PS 61...now a day care center. That school was my tormentor and my delight...both. I remember swimming at the Ken-Grider pool, biking and roller skating right down the streets with my fear of being hit by a car. There weren't that many then. Every one walked to school. There were no school bus issues. Our street was shaded by great elm trees. They were all single or double houses...no apartments . One neighborhood store was on the corner. My friends and I would buy an candy bar, or a bottle of \"pop\"...never called it soda. All of my friends came from in tact families...father and mother and the kids. All moms stayed home, except mine. I witnessed the party line telephone replaced with a private line, moms learning to drive, new and better appliances to brighten our home. We had the first dishwasher. I thought it was more trouble to load the dishwasher than to wash dishes by hand, but I had to load the machine anyways. Central to our entertainment, was the radio. How I loved to listen to adventure stories instead of falling asleep. There was no problem getting around Buffalo. I took the bus. Winters were no problem, either, when you are a child. I wore snow pants, a coat with matching hat, scarf and mittens and wellington boots over my shoes. No one had shoeboots then. We played on our sleds, made snow forts, threw snowballs, skated in the park. I think my childhood was so much more emotionally healthy than today's young children, who spend their time with video games. I spent my first 13 years growing up on Winslow Ave. between Fillmore and Humboldt Parkway. What a great neighborhood. And yes I remember NuWay..the first supermarket...Busy Bee on Fillmore and East Ferry.....Kraft Ice Cream Parlour also on Fillmore. Went to St. Mary Magdalene School and Church on Fillmore and Urban. I remember all the delicatessens along Fillmore....going to the ice skating rink at Humboldt Park.....Watts Restaurant .....School 59 where I went to Kindergarten. At 13 we moved to Stevens street....but kept going back to the Fillm ore area.....but there were great places in the E. Delevan area too....I miss it all.....taking the bus downtown for shopping and shows. I'm 59 now....wish we had it all back. Thanks for the great site. I wish there were pictures of some of the places on Fillmore....I'd love to see them!!\n\nwi Thanks for the memories,i grew up on stevens ave.east side off E Delevan,Went to ps 23.Iremember going to get a fish fry dinner,wrapped in brown paper from a tavern off of Northland and Schuele?when I was a voung lad,trautwines,fish store on\n\ngrider near delevan,what about the smell of freshly made potatochips at the dan-dee\n\nplant on grider,the view from the front window was mouthwatering.Then the kauders dairy icecream store,on grider.Shopping with my mother in the basement of sattlers,the food store.,the cash registers with the large numbers in the display and the crank to complete the sale.Kobackers,across the street,Burnhams,does anyone rember Goldens clothing store at bwy&filmore before the fire?,Robert Hall clothiers\n\non main streetnear the ken expressway.Oh the trees in Humbolt Park,and the swimming poolWadding in the park.Bailos,roast beef on Bailey/lovejoy,The Crystal beach Boat,iwas on it during the gang fight that ended its run.Yes it was a very scarry time,I still have memories of it,not pleasent,fit full ,sleepless nites,and I was less than 10yrs old,some of my recolections,your site is amazing,i will share this site with friends and family through out the countryTHNANKS FOR THE MEMORIESTHANKS FOR THE MEMOS, IT BRINGS BACK WONDERFUL MEMORIES OF WHEN BUFFALO WAS A PLACE THAT WE COULD WALK DOWN MAIN STREET AT NIGHT AND NEVER BE SCARED. CHRISTMAS WAS THE BEST THOUGH WHEN THEY DECORATE THE WINDOWS WITH ANIMATION. THAT WAS A HIGHLIGHT IN OUR LIVES. THANKS FOR CALLING IT THE MEMORIAL WAR STADIUM AND NOT THE ROCK PILE AS SO MANY CALL IT. WHEN I HEAR THAT I WANT TO SCREAM. I JUST SAW THE WONDERFUL SHOTS OF CRYSTAL BEACH AND BETWEEN THESE TWO IT BROUGHT MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD BACK. I HOPE THEY DO SAVE THE TRAIN STATION. I LEFT FROM THERE WHEN I WENT IN THE MARINE CORPS IN 1959. IT WAS A WONDERFUL PLACE TO JUST GO AND WALK AROUND. I LIVED IN THE AREA ALL MY LIFE UNTIL A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WHEN I MOVED TO HARLINGEN TEXAS PERMANENTLY AFTER BEING A WINTER TEXAN FOR THREE YEARS. THE POLITICIAN HAVENT DONE A THING TO SAVE BUFFALO AND THE GOVERNOR WHY DOESNT SHE DO SOMETHING FOR BUFFALO IF SHE WANTS A PROJECT. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE PHOTOS KEEP THEM COMING.\n\nGOD BLESS AMERICA & BRING THE TROOPS HOME SOON & SAFELY.\n\nJANBoth my wife and I were born in Buffalo in the 1930's,lived there until I joined the Air Force, Moved away in 1960 after the sevice time was over to Calif. Now live in Huntington Beach Ca. She attended Lafayette High, and I attended Mckinley Vocational H.S. We certainly enjoyed looking at all the photos that bring back old memories. What I liked were all the monument that were placed thru out the city at the circles and the squares down town. We do miss Buffalo, and when we do get back to visit we make sure to go back to West Side, to see all the changes that occured both bad and good. We love Buffalo..........Go Bills!....................I love the pre-1990 photos of Buffalo. I'm a local history nut and I would much rather study this area's past than the present disaster area that this city has become. I was born in the early 60's and grew up in Buffalo. I moved to western Ohio in 2000 for 6 years to be near my sweetheart, but I came home to take over the family homestead after mom died. I spent a fair amount of time around Toledo and Cleveland and the thought that always came into my head was \"Why can't Buffalo do these things?\" Did you know that Toledo now has more residents than Buffalo? It was initially nice to be back and I have always loved Buffalo, but in the past year and a half I have felt an increasing sense of urgency to flee this city, county and state before it sucks the life out of me. Those governments are simply too incompetent, too corrupt and too oppressive for me to continue to live here. I feel as if I am being driven out of town by them. I never used to be able to understand why so many people fted this city and state, but now I do and I'm looking forward to being somewhere that the government nannies aren't charging me to control every aspect of my life. I'll miss Buffalo, but not not the insane politicians and politics. At least I'll always have my memories. To all the posters, Buffalo still actually lives! We have a wonderful city with great citizens, like any major city we have our share of blight, but with the right leadership, we have all the necessary building blocks to bring it closer to it's heyday, the waterfront, Chippewa, Elmwood, world class museums, HSBC Arena (Go Sabres), restaurants and maybe a Bass Pro Shop (I dont see it, but when I have been to areas that have them they are always busy, so that would be good).\n\nYoung people are actually moving into some beautiful lofts and apartments in the downtown area. Small stores are following. Will we ever have big department downtown stores again, probably not. A lot of people say we should be like Cleveland or Baltimore, I have been to both and I would rather be like Buffalo.\n\nThanks for the wonderful photos. I just moved away from buffalo for the first time in my life we moved to Dallas boy what a small place buffalo really is it will always be home to me but the city is in a mess and because of that people have been leaving in droves sad to say these pictures are great bring back my younger years thats for all the memoriesJust visited this past weekend. It was nice to go down memory lane while there and revisit with these photos. It was a whole different world back in the 60-70's. I was born & raised on the East Side and worked in the Liberty Bank Bldg for several years now living in south central PA. They say you can never go back and I believe that is true but it sure is nice to visit and catch-up. Sarah and I are relatively recent transplants to this beautiful city. The destruction its leaders have visited upon it (Wright factory bldg, near destruction of Martin House, downtown Main Street, Broderick Park Restaurant and the oldest Buffalo house nearby and on and on) are hard to imagine. I was raised in Rochester and much the same occurred there. Maybe it's just an innate urge we have to destroy quality and beauty. But look how much is still left and how much is being saved. Let's home in on the Terminal next and rescue it.I was born and raised in South Buffalo. It is certainly sad to see the death of a city that was in a great heyday in the beginning of the century. Now it is nothing but a dead city and a welfare haven. My children had to leave the area with their degrees to obtain employment elsewhere. What the h@@@ are our politicians doing to help the area? What about our elderly, our young, and our grandchildren? Why do they have to be raised in another state? We haven't raised illiterate children!! We do have schools. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? IS THE MONEY ALL GOING INTO THE POLITIONS POCKETS? IT CERTAINLY ISN'T HELPING US, NOW IS IT???I was born and raised in Buffalo. What I see of my beautiful city makes me so sad. I was a girl growing up in the 60's and the thrill of the week was going downtown on the 15 Seneca bus on a Saturday afternoon with my girlfriends to shop and stroll Main St. Then on Sunday's we would head down there again for movies and lunch.\n\nMy heart is broken in two to see what has happened to Buffalo. I have written stories in my journal so my grandchildren will know that she was truly the \"Queen City\".Wonderful memories -- born and raised in Buffalo and left in 1978. Was there this year and my husband went downtown and came home so depressed because he said the whole City of Buffalo was boarded up. Main Street was a ghost town and the whole City has literally \"gone to the dogs\". The politicians in Buffalo and New York State should be ashamed of themselves for letting a wonderful City get so run down. I wonder if the Governor and the Senators ever visit there and if they do shame on them for not doing something to restore it -- in view of the high taxes in that State......."
