        "text": "Matthew Tully: A few final thoughts about Tony Bennett\n\nA few final thoughts in the wake of the grading controversy that shook Indiana’s education world in recent days and led to the latest tumble in the career of former Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett.\n\n1. Many Indiana schools desperately need improvement. It’s that simple. And while it’s important for policymakers and others to study the grading system at the center of this latest controversy, as well as Bennett’s actions, it shouldn’t distract us from the most important issue: the need to insist on better schools and better performance from students. Many important steps have been taken in recent years, many of them thanks for Bennett’s high-pressure ways, and the real tragedy of the school-grading scandal would be if it lessened the momentum for improvement.\n\nOne reader wrote me last week to argue that Bennett tried to do “too much, too soon.” Sorry, I just don’t agree. If anything, this state has too often done too little, too late. Big improvements, and not cautious tweaks, are what this state needs.\n\n2. Bennett messed up, big time, but that in no way says anything broader about education reformers. Some critics of reform have responded to last week’s news by trying to tarnish the many activists and educators who have worked so hard of late to change outdated policies and mindsets, improve schools and expand options for low-income families. A member of the movement, Bennett, has taken a public fall. But beware of the partisans and special interests who are attempting to exploit the situation.\n\nThis city, as much as any in the nation, is filled with wonderfully innovative and caring education reformers. They have, without question, improved the lives of many students and families. Their efforts to create charter schools and other options have forced low-performing schools and districts to respond. They deserve the city’s thanks.\n\n3. I don’t pretend to really know the politicians I cover. And Tony Bennett has clear flaws (as we all do). But despite his mistakes, I truly believe that he cares deeply about the students stuck in struggling and underperforming schools. His rhetoric was sometimes too much. His actions to help the scores of a school he supported were disappointing and troublesome. His resignation as Florida’s education commissioner was appropriate. But his over-the-top critics have long portrayed him as an evil bureaucrat intent on killing public schools. That’s just wrong.\n\nThe crass joy among of Bennett’s critics in recent days was sad to see. I understand heated political and policy disputes. I don’t understand when those who claim to care about education behave in ways that set a horrible example for students.\n\n4. With that in mind, the controversy was a reminder that the debate over education has become too personal. Both Bennett and his critics deserve blame for that, but it’s time for all of us to grow up and understand that we can disagree without waging wars.\n\nBennett’s fall, meanwhile, was another reminder that the reform movement desperately needs a high-profile leader who can bridge the divide between the education establishment and those who want big changes. These bitter wars are setting back progress. In Indianapolis, perhaps a mayor — this one or the next one — could be that leader. It would take a courageous politician, one willing to demand that both sides work together, but it would benefit the city.\n\n5. It’s also important to remember that someone you agree with or follow can mess up. It was disappointing to see some Republicans last week fiercely defending Bennett’s actions and blasting those who dared to question them. Listen, I defended Bennett’s policies, and even his style in many cases, for four years. I still believe the state’s schools are better off because of him, and the test scores tend to back that up. But sometimes you have to tell people you agree with that they are wrong."
