        "text": "Established in June 2015, the Craig “Cujo, Jr.” Bennett Scholarship is awarded to a graduating senior who has excelled in the face of adversity. This scholarship was established in memory of Craig Daniel Bennett, known as Cujo, Jr – a reference to his father’s flight call sign and to the way a seemingly harmless and vulnerable young person could grow into a passionate and powerful individual. Challenged by extensive multiple physical issues, he defied the negative predictions of skeptical doctors again and again. Craig sometimes encountered people who had difficulty seeing past his wheelchair to who he really was – for them he was a source of surprise and, once his dynamic personality made itself known, a source of inspiration. Craig was a goal-oriented fighter who whitewater rafted the New River and was elected Homecoming King at Bluefield College. He had dreams of walking to receive his diploma and of sky diving.\n\nCraig wanted to be seen as “normal”. Those who knew him saw more than that, he was extraordinary.\n\nKnowing that his life expectancy was shorter than average, Craig asked his parents to establish a scholarship in his memory. Craig Daniel was the recipient of a Bootstrap Scholarship, which is given to nominees that demonstrate the effort and will to succeed in the face of adversity. Award winners are chosen by how well they demonstrate the concept of \"pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.\" The Craig “Cujo, Jr.” Bennett Scholarship Fund also recognizes a student who uses determination and force of will to overcome odds, to meet hardship and to succeed in achieving their dreams.\n\nA scholarship of at least $500 will be awarded to a local high school senior."
