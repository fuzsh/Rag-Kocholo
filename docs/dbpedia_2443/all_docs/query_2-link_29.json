        "text": "Welcome to the 2024-2025 School Year at Cooper City High School\n\nIt is with immense excitement and pride that we welcome you to the start of the 2024-2025 school year at Cooper City High School. We are thrilled to embark on this new journey with you and your children for this school year. We hope you had a restful and enjoyable summer filled with memorable experiences. As we prepare for the first day of school on Monday, August 12, here are some important reminders to help you and your child start the school year successfully.\n\nClass Schedule Change Form 2024-25\n\nPlease fill out this form to request a course change. At this time we are ONLY taking requests to correct: - CORE CLASSES (Graduation Requirements): which are missing or duplicated. - Request Advanced Academic course. Your request will be reviewed and a message will be sent to you via CANVAS with the outcome. Please be patient as our counselors process your requests.\n\nStudent Information System and Back to School Forms\n\nThe Focus Parent Portal is your gateway to staying connected with your student's educational journey in Broward County Public Schools. For the first time, parents/guardians with multiple students will be able to access all their students in one place. The portal will allow you to monitor your student's academic progress, stay informed of upcoming school and district events, and allow you to communicate directly with your student's teachers. To create a new Parent Portal account, you will need a valid email address. Connecting each of your enrolled students will require the following information: Student's full name Student's ID number (begins with â€˜06') Student's date of birth"
