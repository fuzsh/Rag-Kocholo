        "text": "We believe in the power of education to transform lives. We are committed to educational equity, dignity and social justice for all. We will strive to remain mindful of our ever-changing society and its effect on our students.\n\nThe Bennett Alumni Association supports students, parents, staff, and administrators in their work toward graduation for all. It endorses the creation of an atmosphere of affirmative problem-solving to create and maintain positive relationships among students, faculty, administrators and the community.\n\nThe Bennett Alumni Association’s Major Fundraiser of the year is our All Class Reunion. This year, our event is on Friday, June 7, 2024. As a not-for-profit organization, we rely on the generosity of our Alumni and those who do business with us to donate to our gala evening. We’re hoping that we can count on you to donate a gift basket, gift certificates or other items suitable for raffle.\n\nWe are also looking for Alumni to be event sponsors.\n\nFor details, please call our President Neil Lange at 716-308-5451. We will send the sponsorship forms to you!"
