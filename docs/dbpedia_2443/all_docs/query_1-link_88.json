        "text": "The Bennett Grove School is the last example of an African American one room schoolhouse in Bulloch County. When the school building collapsed, we decided to move the building to the Willow Hill Campus and reconstruct it. Bennett Grove was established circa 1918 as a private family school by former slave Benjamin Bennett (1856-1941), and it served as a school in the Bulloch County Public School System until it was closed in 1952. After completing the seventh grade, Bennett Grove students graduated to the Willow Hill Junior High School. The Willow Hill School was founded in 1874 and was the oldest continually-operating school in Bulloch County when it closed in 1999. Both Bennett Grove and Willow Hill stand as living memorials to African American education in the period between the Civil War and the Civil Rights Era."
