        "text": "Rocky Mountain High School was established in 1973 by combining sophomores and juniors from Fort Collins High School and Poudre High School. Student committees were actively involved in making decisions about the school's name, colors, and mascots. Rocky's focus from the beginning was on people rather than things, activities and procedures.\n\nRocky has always been on the cutting edge in terms of innovations and new ideas. In 1992, we were one of the first schools in the nation to switch to the 4 X 4 block schedule in an effort to accommodate our students' academic needs. Our Advanced Placement program is extensive, our Integrated Services programs address a variety of students' special needs, technology is state-of-the-art, and our physical facility is both functional and attractive. Our successful music and athletic programs accommodate large numbers of students and are models for many schools throughout the state of Colorado. A diverse curriculum provides excellent academic opportunities for students, and our many clubs and activities attract large numbers of participants.\n\nRocky was completely redesigned and reconstructed in 1994-95. Rocky's three separate buildings were combined to form one unit. Classrooms were enlarged and advanced technology was integrated into the framework. New facilities were added including a state-of-the-art media center, a new vocal music room and black box theatre, a larger and unique student commons, and a 5,000 square foot fitness center. In January 2005, a new auxiliary gymnasium and multi-purpose room addition was completed.\n\nWe invite all students to build upon the tradition of excellence that previous classes have established and to take maximum advantage of the opportunities to grow and to learn. It's the Lobo Way."
