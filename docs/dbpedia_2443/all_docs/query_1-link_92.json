        "text": "2023 Forum on the Presidency\n\nTRUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS\n\nThursday, November 30, 2023\n\nMember-Only Event | Online & Onstage\n\nKansas City, Missouri\n\nOn July 26, 1948, President Harry S. Truman changed the course of American history. With the signing of Executive Order 9981, “Establishing the President’s Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services,” Truman officially declared that “there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.”\n\nTo honor the 75th anniversary of this watershed decision, the 17th annual Bennett Forum on the Presidency featured an evening of riveting storytelling exploring the genesis and legacy of Executive Order 9981. Robin Givhan, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and moderator, was joined by Brig. Gen. Terrence A. Adams, Judge Richard Gergel and Adriane D. Lentz-Smith, Ph.D.\n\nThis event was offered exclusive to Truman Library Institute members.

Judge Gergel currently presides in the same Charleston, South Carolina, courthouse where Judge Waring heard arguments from President Truman’s Justice Department against a police officer who beat and blinded Sgt. Isaac Woodard, a decorated Black World War II veteran hours after he had been honorably discharged. Though an all-white jury acquitted the police officer, the case served as a turning point for both President Truman and Judge Waring, leading to the establishment of the first Presidential Commission on Civil Rights.
