        "text": "IMPORTANT UPDATE for wireless device policy\n\nTo see more information on Disconnect to Reconnect click on link above. WIRELESS DEVICE USE NOT ALLOWED DURING SCHOOL DAY. Effective in the 2024/25 School Year. All wireless devices must be powered off or in airplane mode during the school day, from bell to bell, including passing periods and lunch unless authorized for instructional purposes. Wireless devices include cellphones, laptops, smartwatches, tablets, headphones, airpods, and other two-way communication equipment. Students violating policy are subject to disciplinary action\n\nWelcome to the 2024-2025 School Year at Cooper City High School\n\nIt is with immense excitement and pride that we welcome you to the start of the 2024-2025 school year at Cooper City High School. We are thrilled to embark on this new journey with you and your children for this school year. We hope you had a restful and enjoyable summer filled with memorable experiences. As we prepare for the first day of school on Monday, August 12, here are some important reminders to help you and your child start the school year successfully.\n\nIf you See Something, Say Something\n\nBe a Broward Buddy, Report a Tip! Call 911 immediately in an emergency. If you have a NON-Emergency Safety or Security concern, please report it through any of our available tip reporting tools. (You may choose to remain anonymous or provide contact information for a callback.) Help identify at-risk individuals BEFORE they hurt themselves or others by reporting threats, harassing behaviors, illegal activity, etc. Please provide as much information as possible especially location, date and time. The more information you provide, the better District staff can respond to your concern. Note: Anyone who knowingly submits a false tip through FortifyFL may be subject to further investigation by law enforcement and may be subject to criminal penalties under section 837.05, F.S.\n\nSafety: Before and After School and Traffic Routes\n\nFor student drop off and pick up please click here to view the traffic flow map. Safety for our students, parents, and staff is everyone's responsibility. Please practice courteous and patient driving when in the CCHS parent loop at arrival and dismissal. Pull up all the way forward to the front of the school to drop off/pick up your child. Students may only be dropped off and picked up from the sidewalk along the front of school. No student should be walking through moving traffic lanes. Thank you for doing your part to keep everyone safe."
