Here at Coral Springs High we take a lot of pride in our school and it is always present in the school's atmosphere. Our Alma Mater was composed by Sue Mitchell Wallace in 1978.\n\nCoral Springs High School\n\nAlma Mater\n\nHail to thee Coral Springs, let everyone hear us sing praise to thee our guide, in knowledge, truth and pride. As we seek new frontiers weâ€™ll remember and revere the Colts of green and blue Coral Springs High hail to you."
