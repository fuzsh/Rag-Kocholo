        "text": "We had already let the daylight in through the transparent skin. Now we could really make it the hero, wrapping the 24 learning spaces around a three-story atrium and adding a clerestory ribbon for good measure.\n\nWith a triangular plan, though, space gets weird pretty quick. We outfitted modular rectangular spaces along the lengths of the building for the research labs and open, flexible classrooms—they adapt to any subject or lesson plan—leaving the six angular rooms at the corners unprogrammed. We filled the remaining oddly shaped volumes with symmetrical exposed-concrete staircases, winding up through the building in traditional Southern style.\n\nIt’s true: We’re a big-city studio in an even bigger firm. But we scale our ambitions to our clients’ dreams, which are always scaled to their objectives. For their part, Kingsport City Schools had expectations to match their vision and, true to their educational model, they wanted to collaborate.\n\nThe triangle scheme was the boldest of the three we brought to the school district. To our delight, they were sold—with a few adjustments.\n\nWe had programmed a new library and cafeteria in the addition and slated parts of the existing structure for renovation into state-of-the-art classrooms. But the addition needs to welcome the community, they said. What if we keep the cafeteria and library we have and give the new building over to the classrooms and public event spaces?\n\nFlip the program, you say? We can do that. We would absolutely love to."
