Introduction

Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids (HDLS) is a paediatric autosomal dominant dysmyelinating disease.1 Rare adult onset cases manifest with personality change, cognitive decline and gait impairment.1–3 Diagnosis is often made following brain biopsy with the presence of giant neuroaxonal swellings known as spheroids.4

Characteristic brain MRI abnormalities of HDLS include decreased T1-weighted signal intensity of the frontoparietal white matter and corpus callosum.2 T2-weighted images reveal patchy increased signal intensity in the subcortical white matter with corticospinal tract involvement.1–4 To our knowledge, this is the first report of an abnormal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map in HDLS.
