        "text": "Abstract\n\nMicroglia play critical roles in the brain physiology and pathology. CSF1R is primarily expressed in microglia. The mono-allelic CSF1R mutation causes adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a lethal neurological disease and no rational cure in clinical trials. There are no animal models mimicking human ALSP. In this study, we first developed mouse models based on human ALSP hotspot mutations. We then utilized microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT) to replace the Csf1r-deficient microglia in ALSP mice by Csf1r-normal donor cells. With pathogenic gene correction, Mr BMT efficiently attenuated the pathologies. Previously, an ALSP patient received traditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT) due to a misdiagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy. The disease progress was halted for 15 years with unknown reasons. We demonstrated that tBMT in ALSP is equivalent to or close to Mr BMT, achieving efficient microglia replacement and therefore attenuating the ALSP progress in the mouse model. Next, we applied tBMT to replace CSF1R-deficient microglia in human patients. Our clinical results show that after microglia replacement, the ALSP course is effectively halted. Together, microglia replacement corrects the pathogenic gene and thus halts the disease progress in the mouse model and human patients. This study strongly demonstrates clinical potentials of microglia replacement in neurological disease treatments.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMicroglia are important immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). The dysfunction of microglia may cause or accelerate the CNS disorders. Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) is a tyrosine kinase1 that exclusively expresses in the brain myeloid cells, including the brain microglia (majority) and board-associated macrophages (BAMs) (minority). The survival of microglia relies on the CSF1R signaling2,3. The bi-allelic CSF1R mutation in human and mouse results in a congenital absence of microglia and is pediatrically lethal2,4. In contrast, the mono-allelic CSF1R mutation in human causes adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP)5. This CSF1R-associated microgliopathy (CAMP) is a lethal neurological disease with microglial number reduction, myelin pathology (including hypermyelination and demyelination), brain parenchymal calcification and motor impairment5–7. There is no rational cure for ALSP. For historical reasons, ALSP is also known as CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy (CRLE), hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS), and pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy (POLD)8,9.\n\nALSP is an overlooked disease and the mechanisms are poorly understood. One of the major reasons is the lack of adequate animal models mimicking human ALSP. To better study ALSP, we first generated CSF1RWT/I792T and CSF1RWT/E631K mice based on two hotspot mutations in human patients, CSF1R:NM_005211:c.2381T>C:p.I794T (the most common mutation worldwide10–12) and c.1897G>A:p.E633K (another common mutation in Europe and North America11,12). We demonstrated that these two models can mimic the human ASLP phenotypes with microglial number reduction, myelin pathology, brain parenchymal calcification and motor impairment.\n\nIn 2020, we first developed efficient strategies for microglia replacement13, which displays therapeutic potentials for neural disease treatment14–19. Since CSF1R gene mutation in microglia is the cause of ALSP, we therefore reasoned that replacing CSF1R-mutated microglia with CSF1R-normal microglia will be neuroprotective to ALSP patients. To test this hypothesis, we utilized microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT or mrBMT)13,20,21 to replace Csf1r-deficient microglia with Csf1r-normal microglia (or microglia-like cells) (refer to as replaced microglia or Mr BMT cells hereafter). We found that the gene correction by Mr BMT successfully enhances the microglia density with Csf1r-normal microglia. After microglia replacement, the ALSP symptoms were significantly alleviated including the myelin pathology, brain parenchymal calcification and motor impairment, demonstrating the therapeutic potential in pre-clinical studies.\n\nIn 2001, a patient was presumably diagnosed with adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and then received an allogeneic bone marrow cell (hematopoietic stem cell) transplantation from her unaffected brother, a standard procedure for MLD treatment22. After the traditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT) for 15 years, the disease progress has been halted7. After the identification of ALSP-causing gene5, the patient was eventually diagnosed as ALSP with CSF1R mutation while her unaffected brother (the donor) is CSF1R-normal7. This is the first time showing tBMT can alleviate the ALSP development. After that, a few cases also show the neuroprotection of tBMT in ALSP23. However, the rationale is unknown. CSF1R signaling is a general pathway regulating the fitness and cell-cell competition of microglia24. Csf1r-deficient microglia are less-fitness cells that cannot compete the better-fitness Csf1r-normal microglia. In that scenario, tBMT in ALSP is equivalent to Mr BMT, which achieves an efficient replacement in the ALSP animal. Therefore, the therapeutic effects in these tBMT-treated ALSP patients are in fact from microglia replacement that corrects the pathogenic CSF1R mutations. To systematically evaluate the therapeutic effect in human, we performed microglia replacement in four ALSP patients by tBMT, replacing their CSF1R-deficient microglia with CSF1R-normal siblings. After microglia replacement, the disease progress has been halted for at least 24 months. It demonstrates the therapeutic effect of microglia replacement in treating human ALSP.\n\nIn summary, by combing pre-clinical and clinical studies, we demonstrated that microglia replacement can correct the disease-causing gene of ALSP and halt the disease progress in the animal model and human patients. It also indicates the therapeutic potentials of microglia replacement in treating other neurological disorders.\n\nResults\n\nGeneration of CAMP model mimicking human ALSP symptoms\n\nThe adequate animal model is the prerequisite to study ALSP. To this end, we generated CSF1RWT/I792T mice by CRISPR-based gene editing. The I792T mutation in mouse CSF1R corresponds to the I794T mutation in humans (CSF1R:NM_005211:c.2381T>C:p.I794T), which is the most common mutation worldwide10–12. CSF1RWT/I792T mice showed significant microglial reductions from 6- to 16-month-old (Figure 1a-b and Figure S1). The brain calcification was observed in the CSF1RWT/I792T mouse brain (Figure 1c). The CSF1RWT/I792T mice displayed obvious motor impairments by the balance beam and rotarod tests (Figure 2a-c) and exhibited the ataxia-like behavior (Figure 2d). In addition to CSF1RWT/I792T, we also generated CSF1RWT/E631K mice by CRISPR-based gene editing. The E631K mutation in mouse CSF1R corresponds to the E633K mutation in humans (CSF1R:NM_005211:c.1897G>A:p.E633K), which is another common mutation in Europe and North America11,12. We found that CSF1RWT/E631K mice exhibited ALSP phenotypes with a microglial number reduction (Figure S2a-b and Figure S3) and brain calcification (Figure S2c). The motor impairment was observed in the balance beam and hindlimb clasping tests but not in the rotarod test (Figure S4). Collectively, by generating CSF1R mutant mice corresponding to human hotspot mutations, we built ALSP mouse models that mimic the human ALSP symptoms.\n\nMr BMT corrects the pathogenic gene and attenuates the disease progression in ALSP mice\n\nWe found that the gene correction by Mr BMT can attenuate the pathologies in the ALSP mouse brain (data will be shown soon). Next, we asked whether the pathological mitigation by Mr BMT can improve the motor performance of CSF1RWT/I792T mice. To this end, we accessed the motor performance by the balance beam, rotarod and hindlimb clasping tests (Figure 3a). Mr BMT-treated CSF1RWT/WT mice (normal replaced by normal) did not display better motor performances in the balance beam (Figure 3b, Video 1-2), rotarod (Figure 3c, Video 3) or hindlimb clasping (Figure 3d, Video 4-5). The results reveal that Mr BMT per se (without gene correction) does not enhance the motor performances. In contrast, CSF1RWT/I792T mice received Mr BMT treatment (deficient replaced by normal) display better motor performances compared to naïve CSF1RWT/I792T mice, including the less slip number in the balance beam from 6- to 16-month-old, shorter crossing time in the balance beam at 3-, 8-, 12- and 16-month-old (Figure 3b, Video 6-7), higher falling speed in the rotarod from 3- to 16-month-old (Figure 3c, Video 3), and significantly lower hindlimb clasping score at 12-month-old and a lower trend at 16-month-old (P = 0.0862) (Figure 3d, Video 8-9). Therefore, correction of the pathogenic gene by Mr BMT alleviates the motor impairments of ALSP mice.\n\nTaken together, our results demonstrated that correcting the pathogenic gene by Mr BMT effectively rescues the brain pathology and motor impairments of ALSP mice.\n\nscRNA-seq results reveal that Mr BMT reshapes ALSP oligodendrocytes to a more normal-like phenotype\n\nTo further characterize the influence of Mr BMT to the ALSP mouse brain, we harvested brains from CSF1RWT/I792T, naïve CSF1RWT/I792T and Mr BMT-treated CSF1RWT/I792T (deficient replaced by normal) mice for single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Figure 4a). To prevent the ex vivo reactivation that may influence the microglial transcriptome, we included a cocktail of transcriptional and translational inhibitors during the cell preparation procedure as previous described25,26. Fourteen cell types were identified in mouse brains according to cell-type-specific gene profiles26,27, including several clusters of microglia/macrophage were identified from CSF1RWT/I792T, naïve CSF1RWT/I792T and Mr BMT-treated CSF1RWT/I792T mice (Figure 4b). We thus subset microglia/macrophage for further analysis (Figure 4b-c). Microglia/macrophage includes Csf1r-normal microglia, Csf1r-deficient microglia, Gfp+ Csf1r-normal Mr BMT cells and BAMs (endogenous Gfp− BAM 1 and replaced Gfp+ BAM 2) (Figure 4c). As Csf1r-deficient microglia are the pathogenic cells in ALPS, we compared the transcriptome between naïve CSF1RWT/I792T and CSF1RWT/WT microglia. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (|log2FC| > 0.25, adjust P < 0.05) between these two populations, 582 biological processes were annotated by gene ontology (GO). Several biological processes were related to ALSP pathology, including axonogenesis, neuron death, axon ensheathment, regulation of myelination, and negative regulation of immune system process (Figure 4d and Table 1), suggesting the microglia-mediated etiology. In contrast, after Mr BMT treatment, 731 biological processes were enriched in the DEGs of Mr BMT-treated CSF1RWT/I792T vs naïve CSF1RWT/I792T microglia, including axonogenesis, gliogenesis, neuron death, regulation of neuron death, and regulation of myelination (Figure 4e and Table 2). The therapeutic effect of Mr BMT may mediated by these processes.\n\nAs myelin pathology is one of the hallmarks of ALSP and microglia are essential for myeline healthy28,29, we compared the influences of different microglia to the oligodendrocyte (OL) subset (Figure 4f). CSF1RWT/I792T oligodendrocytes primarily located in the distant clusters from those of CSF1RWT/WT mice (Figure 4f-g). We named these clusters as ALSP-dominant and normal-dominant clusters, respectively (Figure 4g-h). In the naïve CSF1RWT/I792T mice, 61.47% of oligodendrocytes were in the ALSP-dominant clusters. In contrast, only 28.67% of naïve CSF1RWT/I792T oligodendrocytes were in the normal-dominant clusters (Figure 4h-i). After Mr BMT treatment, only 5.17% of CSF1RWT/I792T oligodendrocytes were in ALSP-dominant clusters whereas 62.86% of them resumed to the normal-dominant phenotype (Figure 4h-i). The results indicates that the gene correction by Mr BMT can reshape the ALSP oligodendrocytes to a more normal-like phenotype.\n\ntBMT in ALSP is equivalent to Mr BMT in replacement efficiency\n\nThe fitness and cell-cell competition of microglia is regulated by CSF1R24. CSF1R deficiency makes endogenous microglia in ALSP recipient less competitive against wild-type donor cells. As a result, tBMT in ALSP is equivalent to or close to Mr BMT, achieving efficient microglia replacement (data will be shown soon).\n\nMicroglia replacement by tBMT corrects the pathogenic gene and mitigates the disease progress in ALSP mice\n\nWe found that microglia replacement by tBMT correcting the mutated Csf1r can attenuate the pathologies in the ALSP mouse brain (data will be shown soon). We then asked whether the tBMT-mediated mitigation of ALSP brain pathology can improve the motor performance in mice. We thus tested the motor performance through the balance beam, rotarod and hindlimb clasping tests (Figure 5a). tBMT-treated CSF1RWT/WT mice (normal replaced by normal) did not display better motor performances in the balance beam (Figure 5b, Video 10), rotarod (except for at 3-month-old) (Figure 5c, Video 11) or hindlimb clasping (Figure 5d, Video 12). These results indicate that tBMT per se (non-gene correction) does not lead to a better motor performance. However, tBMT-treated CSF1RWT/I792T mice (deficient replaced by normal) display improved motor performances compared to naïve CSF1RWT/I792T mice, including a less slip number in the balance beam at 6-, 12- and 16-month-old, reduced crossing time in the balance beam from 12- to 16-month-old (Figure 5b, Video 13), higher falling speed in the rotarod from 3- to 16-month-old (Figure 5c, Video 11), and significantly lower hindlimb clasping score from 12- to 16-month-old (Figure 5d, Video 14). Thus, correction of the pathogenic gene via tBMT-achieved microglia replacement improves the motor performance of ALSP mice.\n\nTaken together, the Csf1r-deficiency results in a less-fitness in the cell-cell competition. In this scenario, tBMT achieves an efficient microglia replacement in Csf1r-deficienct ALSP mice, by which thus effectively attenuates the development of brain pathologies and improves the motor performance.\n\nMicroglia replacement significantly halts the disease progress in ALSP human patients\n\nTo investigate whether microglia replacement can clinically halt or attenuate the progression of ALSP in human patients, we compared the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 4 ALSP patients who received tBMT with HLA-matched CSF1R-normal cells (patients’ information see Supplementary Table 3) (Figure 6a) to the patients who did not receive tBMT. ALSP patients exhibited atrophy in the cortex and corpus callosum in T1 sequence, as well as periventricular white matter hyperintensities in T2-FLAIR and DWI (Figure 6b). MRI revealed the rapid disease progression in the tBMT-untreated ALSP patients with more severe atrophy in T1 and more hyperintensities in T2-FLAIR and DWI (Figure 6b), resulting in an increased Sundal MRI severity score (SSS)30 (Figure 6c). In contrast, microglia replacement by tBMT effectively halted the disease progress with cortical and corpus callosum atrophy no longer exacerbated in T1, and fewer hyperintensities in T2-FLAIR and DWI (Figure 6b). The SSS remains stable for the next 24 months after replacement (Figure 6c). Therefore, microglia replacement effectively halts the pathological progression in the ALSP patient’s brain.\n\nNext, we utilized unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale part-III (UPDRS-III) (a clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation, by which a higher score indicates a more severe motor impairment31) and activity of daily living (ADL) (the self-care tasks including bathing and showering, personal hygiene and grooming, dressing and toilet hygiene, functional mobility and self-feeding, by which a lower score indicates a worse performance in daily living activities32) to further evaluate the functional improvement in motor ability. Compare to the healthy controls, the ALSP patients exhibited higher UPDRS-III and lower ADL scores (Figure 6c-d). The motor impairments of the patients exacerbated rapidly in the following 12 months (Figure 6d-e). In contrast, microglia replacement by tBMT largely halted the progress of motor dysfunctions revealed by both of UPDRS-III (an improvement trend at 6-month post replacement, P = 0.1114, and significantly improved at 12-month post replacement) (Figure 6d) and ADL (significantly improved at 6- to 12-month post replacement) (Figure 6e). Twenty-four months after the tBMT, the motor function of ALSP patients remained stable and even showed a reverse trend (Figure 6d-e). ALSP patients also manifest with cognitive declines6. We thus used mini-mental state examination (MMSE) (a 30-point questionnaire measuring cognitive impairment, by which a lower score indicates a more severe cognitive decline33,34) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) (an evaluation including short-term memory, visuospatial abilities, multiple aspects of executive function, attention, concentration, working memory, language, abstract reasoning and orientation to time and place, by which a lower score indicates a more severe cognitive decline35,36) to evaluate the cognitive function. In contrast to the tBMT-nontreated patients, the tBMT-treated patients displayed a halted motor performance and an improvement trend compared to the ALSP patients who did not receive tBMT at 6-month after replacement in both MMSE (P = 0.1180) (Figure 6f) and MoCA (P = 0.0710) (Figure 6g). Twelve-month after replacement, the progress of cognitive impairment was significantly halted and displayed a significant improvement compared to the non-replaced patients in both (MMSE) and MoCA (Figure 6f-g). The cognitive function of tBMT-treated patients remained stable 24 months after microglia replacement (Figure 6f-g). Together, our results demonstrated that microglia replacement by tBMT effectively halted the development of functional impairment in ALSP patients.\n\nSupplementary\n\nSupplementary Table 1 Biological processes enriched in the DEGs of CSF1RWT/WT vs naïve CSF1RWT/I792T microglia.\n\nSupplementary Table 2 Biological processes enriched in the DEGs of Mr BMT-treated CSF1RWT/I792T vs naïve CSF1RWT/I792T microglia.\n\nSupplementary Table 3 Baseline characteristics of ALSP patients with or without tBMT and healthy controls.\n\nVideos\n\nVideo 1 Naïve CSF1RWT/WT mouse in the balance beam test.\n\nVideo 2 Mr BMT-treated CSF1RWT/WT mouse in the balance beam test.\n\nVideo 3 Naïve CSF1RWT/WT, Mr BMT-treated CSF1RWT/WT, naïve CSF1RWT/I792T and Mr BMT-treated CSF1RWT/I792T mice in the rotarod test.\n\nVideo 4 Naïve CSF1RWT/WT mouse in the hindlimb clasping test.\n\nVideo 5 Mr BMT-treated CSF1RWT/WT mouse in the hindlimb clasping test.\n\nVideo 6 Naïve CSF1RWT/I792T mouse in the balance beam test.\n\nVideo 7 Mr BMT-treated CSF1RWT/I792T mouse in the balance beam test.\n\nVideo 8 Naïve CSF1RWT/I792T mouse in the hindlimb clasping test.\n\nVideo 9 Mr BMT-treated CSF1RWT/I792T mouse in the hindlimb clasping test.\n\nVideo 10 tBMT-treated CSF1RWT/WT mouse in the balance beam test.\n\nVideo 11 Naïve CSF1RWT/WT, tBMT-treated CSF1RWT/WT, naïve CSF1RWT/I792T and tBMT-treated CSF1RWT/I792T mice in the rotarod test.\n\nVideo 12 tBMT-treated CSF1RWT/WT mouse in the hindlimb clasping test.\n\nVideo 13 tBMT-treated CSF1RWT/I792T mouse in the balance beam test.\n\nVideo 14 tBMT-treated CSF1RWT/I792T mouse in the hindlimb clasping test.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMicroglia replacement corrects the pathogenic gene and halts the disease progress of ALSP in mice and human patients\n\nIn 2020, we first developed three efficient strategies for microglia replacement, including Mr BMT13,20, microglia replacement by peripheral blood (Mr PB or mrPB)13,37 and microglia replacement by microglia transplantation (Mr MT or mrMT)13,38. We proposed potential applications in the neurological disease treatment including attenuating the progress of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients with the TREM2R47H mutation13. Each strategy has its own advantages and can fit into different clinical scenarios13–15.\n\nEvidences from mouse models strongly demonstrated the therapeutic potentials of microglia replacement in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and a progressive neurodegeneration model16–19. These diseases, however, are not microgliopathy that with mutations in microglia specific and pathogenic causing genes. Thus, the proof from direct and rational treatment to microgliopathy is still absent. In this study, we established mouse models of CSF1R-associated microgliopathy, the major form of ALSP. We demonstrated that the correction of the pathogenic Csf1r mutation by microglia replacement is able to effectively mitigate the ALSP pathology and functional impairment in the mouse model. More importantly, based on the data of our clinical trials, we further demonstrated that microglia replacement can effectively halt the ALSP progress of human patients. This is a clinical proof of neurological disease treatment by microglia replacement. Microglia replacement therefore display great potentials in treating other neurological diseases, including microglia-causing diseases (microgliopathy) and microglia-accelerating diseases (e.g., AD with accompanying TREM2 mutation) (see Discussion in Xu et al., 2020, Cell Reports13).\n\nInterestingly, microglia replacement also displayed therapeutic effects in an AD model without mutations of any microglia-expressing genes18. The rationale why the non-gene-correction microglia replacement protects AD brain is largely unknown. The replaced cells by Mr BMT and Mr PB are not identical to resident microglia. Compared to the yolk sac-derived P2ry12+ Tmem119+ Siglech+ Mf4− Ms4a7− microglia, the bone marrow cell derived-Mr BMT cells and blood cell-derived Mr PB cells are P2ry12low Tmem119low Siglechlow Mf4+ Ms4a7+13. In this study, the expression of microglia-specific and macrophage-specific genes of Mr BMT cells are between those of resident microglia and BAMs (Figure 4c). The unique phenotype might provide some neuroprotective effects. In addition, microglial reactivation and neurodegeneration are mutually enhanced. The inflamed microglia are removed in the first step of microglia replacement. The removal of microglia per se also can ameliorate the disease pathology. It is not only in the case of neuroprotective non-gene-correction microglia replacement, but may also in the case of neuroprotective microglia repopulation39.\n\nThe cell-cell competition of microglia\n\nMicroglia display a cell-cell competition and do not “invade” the territory of their neighbors. In that way, microglia tile the brain and maintain a stable number in homeostasis. To achieve the efficient microglia, it is necessary to create a microglia-free niche and suppress the microglia proliferation in the recipient subjects13. The microglia-free niche can be achieved by CSF1R inhibition3,13,40,41 whereas suppression of microglia proliferation can be achieved by busulfan of irradiation13,21,42–44. This is echoed by a parabiosis study that allogenic myeloid cells differentiated into microglia and replaced the recipient’s microglia through a long-term ablation of CX3CR1-CreER::CSF1Rfl/fl microglia, by which simultaneously generated a microglia-free niche and inhibited the endogenous microglia without influencing donor cells45. Due to the lack of microglia-free niche in the physiological condition, tBMT is not capable of achieving an efficient microglia replacement13. However, the CSF1R-deficient ALSP is a partially microglia-free condition with reduction of microglial cell number and less cell-cell competitive24. In addition, busulfan or irradiation during the tBMT can further reduce the microglial number42–44. Therefore, ALSP is a natural microglia-free condition upon tBMT. Indeed, our results demonstrated that the replacement efficiency of tBMT in ALSP is equivalent or close to Mr BMT. It explains why the pathology can be halted in the misdiagnosed patient who received tBMT7. Furthermore, it also indicates that no extra CSF1R inhibition is required in the treatment of ALSP patients (that is tBMT).\n\nOn the other hand, for the other diseases that the microglial cell-cell competition is not impaired, microglia depletion is required for replacement. The safety of short- and long-term CSF1R inhibition has been well characterized in animals3,13,40,46,47 and human patients48–51. The microglial depletion by CSF1R inhibition has been granted US FDA approval52,53. Therefore, microglial replacement meets the safety requirements for clinical therapy. Even for some disease conditions, microglial depletion per se is neuroprotective54–61. Taken together, microglia replacement is a clinically feasible strategy showing great promising in other neurological disease treatment.\n\nMethods\n\nEthics statements\n\nAll mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Fudan University, Animal Welfare Ethics Committee at Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.

Anisomycin (HY-18982) was purchased from MedChemExpress. Busulfan (B2635) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The normal AIN-76A diet (control diet, CD) was formulated by SYSE Bio (Cat#: PD1001, Lot#: 23020802). Ketamine (H20193336) was purchased from Shanghai Pharmaceutical. PLX5622 was formulated into the AIN-76A diet (1.2 g PLX5622 per kilogram of diet by SYSE Bio Cat#: D20010801, Lot#: 23021005). Triptolide (HY-32735) was purchased from MedChemExpress. Xylazine hydrochloride (Cat#: X1251) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\nDrug administration\n\nTo pharmacologically eliminate myeloid cells, the mice were administered a PLX5622 (MCE)-formulated AIN-76A diet (1.2g PLX5622 per kilogram of diet formulated by SYSE Bio) ad libitum for 14 days. For microglia replacement, the mice were administrated 25 mg/kg busulfan by intraperitoneal injection for 4 days.\n\nBrain tissue preparation\n\nMice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane. For histological experiments, animals were sequentially perfused with 0.01 M PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Biosharp, Cat#: BL539A) in 0.01 M PBS. Brains were then carefully harvested and postfixed in 4% PFA in 0.01 MPBS at 4 °C overnight.\n\nCryosection preparation\n\nBrains and peripheral organs were dehydrated in 30% sucrose in 0.01 M PBS at 4 °C for 3-5 days. Samples were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT, SAKURA, Cat#: 4583), and frozen and stored at -80 °C before sectioning. Tissue with regions of interest was cut by a cryostat (Leica, CM1950) at a thickness of 30 μm.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and image acquisition\n\nBrain and peripheral organ sections were rinsed with 0.01 M PBS 3 times for 10 to 15 min, and then blocked for 2 hours with 4% normal donkey serum (NDS, Jackson, Cat#: 017-000-121) in 0.01 M PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Aladdin, Cat#: T109026) (PBST) at room temperature (RT), followed by incubation with primary antibodies with 1% NDS in PBST at 4 °C overnight. After rinsing with PBST for 3 times, the samples were incubated with fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies at RT for 2 hours with 1% NDS in PBST with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, D9542). Afterward, the samples were rinsed three times, and then mounted with anti-fade mounting medium (SouthernBiotech, Cat#: 0100-01).\n\nPrimary antibodies included rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:500, Wako, Cat#: 019-19741, Lot: LEP3218), goat anti-IBA1 (1:500, Abcam, Cat#: ab5076, Lot: GR3403958-1), rabbit anti-GFP (1:500, Invitrogen, Cat#: A11122, Lot: 2273763), goat anti-GFP (1:500, Abcam, Cat#ab6673, Lot:GR3408265-4).

After deparaffinization and rehydration, the tissue sections were stained with Alizarin Red S (G1038, Servicebio) for calcification labeling, and photographed with an Olympus BX43 light microscope. 40X objectives were utilized.\n\nElectron microscopy\n\nMice were intracardially perfused with 0.01 M PBS and 4% PFA and tissue with the size of 1 mm × 1 mm × 2 mm was collected from corpus callosum and then immersed in a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde (GA) and 2% PFA for more than 2 hours at 4°C, washed two times in the phosphate buffer, then fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide. The specimen was dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, and then processed into araldite resin blocks. The specimen was placed in capsules contained embedding medium and heated at 60°C for 48hours. The samples were sectioned by a diamond blade (Leica EM UC7) to 70 – 90 nm thickness, followed by stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for contrast. All the specimens were viewed by transmission electron microscope (HITACHI H-7650).\n\nMicroglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT) in mice\n\nFor Mr BMT by busulfan, 8-week-old recipient mice were fed PLX5622 from day 0 to day 14. Then, the mice received busulfan (25 mg/kg of body weight each day) from day 9 to day 12 by intraperitoneal injection. Afterward, 1 × 107 bone marrow cells harvested from the tibia and femur of the β-actin-GFP donor mouse were immediately introduced into the recipient mice on day 14 via intravenous injection. Then, the mice were fed a control diet. The mouse was fed neomycin (1.1 g/L) in acidic water (pH 2-3) throughout the procedure of microglia replacement.\n\nTraditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT) in mice\n\nTwo approaches (irradiation-13,20,21 and busulfan-based21) were used to achieve myeloid ablation of tBMT in this study. For head-shielded tBMT by irradiation, 8-week-old recipient mice were fed CD from day 0 to day 14. Then, the heads of pretreated mice were shielded by lead and exposed to 9 Gy X-ray irradiation on day 1413,20,21. For tBMT by busulfan, 8-week-old recipient mice were fed CD from day 0 to day 14. Then, the mice received busulfan (25 mg/kg of body weight each day) from day 9 to day 12 by intraperitoneal injection. Afterward, 1 × 107 bone marrow cells harvested from the tibia and femur of the β-actin-GFP donor mouse were immediately introduced into the recipient mice on day 14 via intravenous injection. Then, the mice were fed a control diet. The mouse was fed neomycin (1.1 g/L) in acidic water (pH 2-3) throughout the procedure of microglia replacement.\n\nRotarod test\n\nFor the rotarod test, the mice were placed on an accelerating rotarod cylinder, the speed was slowly accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm within 5 min. and maintain for another 5 min at 40 rpm. A trial ended when the animal dropped or spun around for 3 consecutive revolutions without attempting to run on the rods. The speed of the rotarod when the mouse dropped was recorded. The test data are presented as the mean of speed (4 trials).\n\nBalance beam test\n\nFor the balance beam test, the mice were trained 2 days before the test. On day 3, the mice were placed on balance beam, and the number of slips and time of crossing the beam was measured. A trial was considered successful when the mice walked completely from one end of the beam to the other without pause. The test data are presented as the mean of a number of slips and time of crossing the beam (3 trials).\n\nHindlimb clasping test\n\nFor the hindlimb clasping test, the mice were suspended by the tail and video-recorded for about 10 seconds. Hindlimb clasping was rated from 0 to 3 based on severity: be rated as 0 if hindlimbs splayed outward and away from the abdomen, be rated as 1 if one hindlimb retracted inwards towards the abdomen for at least 50% of the observation period, be rated as 2 if both hindlimbs partially retracted inwards towards the abdomen for at least 50% of the observation period, be rated as 3 if both hindlimbs completely retracted inwards towards the abdomen for at least 50% of the observation period.\n\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing\n\nThe cell suspension was primarily according to our previous protocol26. In brief, the mice were perfused with 0.9% saline and inhibitor cocktail solution (actinomycin D 5 μg/mL, triptolide 10 μM, anisomycin 27.1 μg/mL), then the brains of mice were quickly sliced into 200 μm sections. Next, the sections were incubated in choline chloride solution with 10 μM NBQX (Tocris, Cat#: 0373), 50 μM APV (Tocris, Cat#: 3693), inhibitor cocktail, and influx with oxygen (95% O2 and CO2) for 30 min at 37 °C. After that, the sections were digested in 20 U/mL papain (Worthington, LK003178) and 100 U/mL DNase I (Sangon, B100649-0040) for 20 min at 37 °C, then the sections were incubated in 1mg/mL protease (Sigma-Aldrich, P5147) and 1 mg/mL dispase (Worthington, LS02106) for 20 min at 25 °C. Next, the sections were gently and repeatedly blown through pipette into single-cell suspensions, then filtered through 40 μm cell strainers. The cell debris was removed by 30% Percoll (Millipore, P1644) in DPBS with 0.5%BSA. Finally, the cells resuspended in DPBS with 0.5% BSA and approximately 24,000 cells for each group (N = 3 mice) were loaded for 10x Genomics library preparation. A cocktail of transcriptional and translational inhibitors was included in the cell preparation to prevent the ex vivo microglial reactivation25,26.\n\nThe single-cell libraries were constructed using the Chromium controller and Chromium single-cell 3 reagent version 2 kit (10x Genomics). Then the libraries were sequenced at the paired-end 150 bp using HiSeq X Ten (Illumina).\n\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\n\nSample demultiplexing, barcode processing and single-cell 3’ gene counting were carried out with Cell Ranger 7.0.1 (10x Genomics). The 10-bp transcripts/UMI tags were extracted from the reads. Cellranger mkfastq with bcl2fastq 2.0.1 was applied to demultiplex raw base call files from the sequencer into sample-specific FASTQ files. Additionally, cellranger-compatible references were produced based on both genome sequences and transcriptome GTF files by using Cell Ranger mkref. These FASTQ files were aligned to the reference genome mm10 with cellranger count by using STAR 2.7.2. Aligned reads were then filtered for valid cell barcodes and UMI to generate filtered gene-barcode matrices.\n\nNext, gene-barcode matrices were analyzed with Seurat 5.0.1. For quality control, low-quality cells (detected > 7,000 genes, < 200 genes and > 10% mitochondrial genes) were discarded. Filtered data were further normalized by SCTransform. For dimension reduction, data were reduction by using RunPCA with VariableFeatures, and the top 50 principal components (PCs) of the datasets were used for clustering and tSNE/UMAP visualization. Then the markers of each cluster were calculated by FindAllMarkers with resolution = 2.\n\nTo identify different brain cell types, we used multiple cell type-specific or enriched marker genes as previously described. In brief, these genes included but were not limited to P2ry12, Tmem119, Hexb and Aif1 for microglia; Ms4a7, Mrc1, Cx3cr1 and Aif1 for macrophage; Gfp for Mr BMT derived cell; Plp1, Mog, Mag and Mbp for oligodendrocytes; S100b, Gja1, Slc1a2 and Aldh1l1 for astrocytes; Syt1 and Map2 for mature neurons, Tubb3 and Dcx for immature neurons; Syt1 and Baiap3 for neuroendocrine cells (NendC); Pdgfra for OPCs; Pdgfra, Dcn, Lama1 and Lum for vascular and leptomeningeal cells (VLMC); Acta2 for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC); Nkg7 and Skap1 for nature killer cells; Alas2 for hemoglobin-expressing vascular cells (Hb-VC); Kcnj8 and Vtn for pericytes; Cldn5 and Pecam1 for endothelial cells (EC); Npy for olfactory ensheathing glia (OEG).\n\nFor DEG analysis, DEGs among groups of cells were identified using FindMarkers with parameters of min.pct = 0.1 and thresh.use = 0.25 (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Genes with a |log2FC| > 0.25 and adjust P value < 0.05 were included and defined as DEGs. These DEGs were further used for GO and IPA analyses.\n\nGO analysis and IPA analysis\n\nGO analysis was performed using the enrichGO function of the clusterProfiler 4.6.2 package, where categories with a false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05 were considered significantly enriched; categories were simplified using the ‘simplify’ function with a cutoff value = 0.7, and visualization was performed using the dotplot and barplot functions in clusterProfiler 4.6.2. DEGs were also subjected to IPA for functional analysis using the Ingenuity Knowledge Base (Qiagen Bioinformatics). The FC and FDR values of each gene were used to perform the core analysis, and pathways enriched with an adjusted P < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched.\n\nStatistics and reproducibility\n\nThe statistical approaches were indicated in figure legends. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications13,21,26,40,41,47,64–66. Mice were randomized for the naïve, Mr BMT and tBMT groups for experiment. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. Collection and analysis of scRNA-seq data were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. Collection of behavior experiment data was blind. Behavior data of mice with obesity, cataract or severe trauma were excluded from the analyses.\n\nData availability\n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author Bo Peng at Fudan University within three months upon typical request.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Dr. Congcong Qi (Small Animal Behavior Monitoring Platform at the Laboratory Animal Resource Center, Fudan University) for the technical support in behavior tests and Jie Yang (Core Facility of Basic Medical Sciences at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine) for the technical support in transmission electron microscopy.
