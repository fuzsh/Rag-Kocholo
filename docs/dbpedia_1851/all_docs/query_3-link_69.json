PMID: 18422757; Rademakers et al.\n\n(2011) \"Mutations in the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene cause hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids.\" Nat Genet. 44(2).200-205. PMID: 22197934; Oosterhof et al.\n\n(2019) \"Homozygous Mutations in CSF1R Cause a Pediatric-Onset Leukoencephalopathy and Can Result in Congenital Absence of Microglia.\" Am J Hum Genet, 104(5):936-947, PMID: 30982608), Previously, ALSP was thought to be two separate conditions, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukoencephalopathy (POLD). However, given patients with HDLS and POLD both can have pigmented glial cells and spheroids, HDLS and POLD are considered part of the same spectrum of disease encompassed by ALSP (Nicholson et al. (2013) \"CSF1R\n\nmutations link POLD and HDLS as a single disease entity.\" Neurology 80(11): 1033-1040. PMID:\n\n23408870).\n\n100051 Patients with ALSP and pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy characteristically have swelling in the axons of the brain, called spheroids. Recent research has linked mutations in the CSF1R gene to ALSP and pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy (Rademakers et al.\n\n(2011); Nicholson et al. (2013); Oosterhof et al. (2019); Quo et al. (2019) \"Bi-allelic CSF1R\n\nMutations Cause Skeletal Dysplasia of Dysosteosclerosis-Pyle Disease Spectrum and Degenerative Encephalopathy with Brain Malformation.\" Am J Hum Genet. 104(5):925-935. PMID: 30982609).\n\n100061 The human CSF1R gene encodes a protein called colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), a homodimeric glycoprotein, is the primary ligand for CSF1R (Sherr et at. (1988) \"Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-fms).\" J\n\nCell Biochem 38(3):179-187, PMID: 2852667). CSF1R is a type III tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor that belongs to the PDGF receptor family. Members of the receptor family have protein structures consisting of immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a protein kinase domain.\n\nSpecifically, CSF1R is composed of a highly glycosylated extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular protein tyrosine-kinase domain.\n\nCSF1R is found in the outer membrane of various cell types, including macrophages, and serves as the growth factor receptor for colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) (Pridans et at. (2013) \"CSF1R\n\nmutations in hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids are loss of finiction.\"\n\nSci Rep 3: 3012. PMID:\n\n24145216; Ridge et al. (1990) \"FMS mutations in myelodysplastic, leukemic, and normal subjects.\"\n\n87(4): 1377-1380. PMID: 2406720; Oosterhof et at; Rademaker et al). Signaling via CSF1R has been shown to regulate the proliferation and development of macrophages, including microglial cells.\n\nSpecifically, CSF1R signaling may be responsible for the generation of the majority of mature macrophages, including the microglia of the brain. CSF1R deficiency negatively impacts the development of microglia in the brain (Swerdlow et al. (2009) \"Autosomal dominant subcortical gliosis presenting as frontotemporal dementia.\" Neurology 72(3):260-267. PMID:\n\n19153373; Baba et al. (2006) \"Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids: clinical, pathologic and genetic studies of a new kindred.\" Acta Neuropathol. 111(4):300-311. PMID: 16523341;\n\nOosterhof et al.;\n\nRademaker et al.; Quo et al., 2019).\n\n100071 At present, there are no effective treatment options for patients suffering from ALSP, pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy, and related diseases. Available treatments manage disease symptoms rather than treating the disease. Thus, there is a need in the art for new treatments to provide therapeutic options and improve outcomes for patients afflicted by ALSP, pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy, and related diseases.\n\n100081 All references cited herein, including patent applications and publications, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE\n\n100091 The present disclosure is generally directed to methods of treating individuals having a CSF1R-deficient disease comprising administering to the individual an antibody that binds to a TREM2 protein, where the antibody is an agonist.\n\n100101 Certain aspects of the present disclosure are based, at least in part, on the discovery that an agonistic anti-TREM2 antibody significantly improved viability of human macrophages that were grown in the presence of a CSF1R inhibitor, compared to human macrophages grown in the presence of a CSF1R inhibitor and a control IgG (see, e.g., Example 2),\n\n-2-10011] Accordingly, In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of treating or preventing a CSF1R-deficient disease comprising administering to an individual in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody that binds to a TREM2 protein, wherein the antibody is an agonist and wherein the antibody induces one or more TREM2 activities.\n\n100121 In some embodiments, the antibody enhances one or more TREM2 activities induced by binding of one or more TREM2 ligands to the TREM2 protein.

Such diseases or disorders include, but are not limited to, diseases associated with mutations in CSF1R, such as pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy; adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP); leukoencephalopathy, diffuse hereditary, with spheroids; adult-onset leukodystrophy with neuroaxonal spheroids; autosomal dominant leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids; hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS);\n\nneuroaxonal leukodystrophy; pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy; and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukoencephalopathy (POLD). Agonists of TREM2 include anti-TREM2 antibodies that induce one or more TREM2 activities and/or enhance one or more activities induced by binding of one or more ligands to TREM2. For example, agonist anti-TREM2 antibodies may decrease soluble TREM2, induce spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) phosphorylation, induce binding of TREM2 to DAP12, induce DAP12 phosphorylation, increase the proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and microgjial cells (microglia), or increase the activity and/or expression of TREM2-dependent genes.\n\n-7-Definitions [0037] As used herein, the term \"preventing\" includes providing prophylaxis with respect to occurrence or recurrence of a particular disease, disorder, or condition, including delaying onset of a particular disease, disorder, or condition, in an individual that may be predisposed to, susceptible to, or at risk of developing such a disease, disorder, or condition, but has not yet been diagnosed with the disease, disorder, or condition.\n\n100381 As used herein, an individual \"at risk\" of developing a particular disease, disorder, or condition may or may not have detectable disease or symptoms of disease, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease or symptoms of disease prior to the treatment methods described herein.\n\n\"At risk\" denotes that an individual has one or more risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of a particular disease, disorder, or condition, as known in the art. An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing a particular disease, disorder, or condition than an individual without one or more of these risk factors.\n\n100391 As used herein, the term \"treatment\" refers to clinical intervention designed to alter the natural course of the individual being treated during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include decreasing the rate of progression, ameliorating or palliating the pathological state, and remission or improved prognosis of a particular disease, disorder, or condition. An individual is successfully \"treated\", for example, if one or more symptoms associated with a particular disease, disorder, or condition are mitigated or eliminated.\n\n100401 An \"effective amount\" refers to at least an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result. An effective amount can be provided in one or more administrations. An effective amount herein may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the treatment to elicit a desired response in the individual. An effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the treatment are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired results include eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the severity, or delaying the onset of the disease, including biochemical, histological and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease. For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include clinical results such as decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the disease, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, enhancing effect of another medication such as delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival. An effective amount of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to accomplish prophylactic or therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is understood in the clinical context, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug,\n\n-8-compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an \"effective amount\" may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.\n\n100411 An \"individuar for purposes of treatment, prevention, or reduction of risk refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sport, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, rabbits, cattle, pigs, hamsters, gerbils, mice, ferrets, rats, cats, and the like. In some embodiments, the individual is human.\n\n[0042] As used herein, administration \"in conjunction\"\n\nwith another compound or composition includes simultaneous administration and/or administration at different times.\n\nAdministration in conjunction also encompasses administration as a co-formulation or administration as separate compositions, including at different dosing frequencies or intervals, and using the same route of administration or different routes of administration.\n\n[0043] The term \"immunoglobulin\" (Ig) is used interchangeably with \"antibody\" herein. The term \"antibody\" herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.\n\n100441 The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotorameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. The pairing of a VH and Vt. together forms a single antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see, e.g., Basic and Clinical Immunology, 8th Ed., Daniel P.\n\nStites, Abba I. Ten and Tristram G. Parslow (eds.), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT, 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6.\n\n[0045] The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (\"x\") and lambda Cr), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (CH), inummoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of inummoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, having heavy chains designated alpha (\"a\"), delta (\"6\"), epsilon (\"c\"), gamma (\"T\") and mu (\"jt\"), respectively. The and a classes are further divided into subclasses (isotypes) on the basis of relatively minor differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl, and IgA2.\n\nThe subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of iinmunoglobulins are well known and described generally in, for example, Abbas et at., Cellular and Molecular Immunology, gibed. (VV.B. Saunders Co., 2000).\n\n100461 \"Native antibodies\" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains.\n\nEach light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different inununoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has\n\n-9-regularly spaced intra-chain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VI) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.\n\n100471 An \"isolated' antibody, such as an isolated anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, is one that has been identified, separated and/or recovered from a component of its production enviromnent (e.g., naturally or recombinantly). Preferably, the isolated polypeptide is free from association with substantially all other contaminant components from its production environment. Contaminant components from its production enviromnent, such as those resulting from recombinant transfected cells, are materials that would typically interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified: (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain.\n\n100481 The \"variable region\" or \"variable domain\" of an antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, refers to the amino-terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain may be referred to as \"VH\" and \"W\", respectively. These domains are generally the most variable parts of the antibody (relative to other antibodies of the same class) and contain the antigen binding sites.\n\n100491 The term \"variable\" refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies, such as anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure.\n\nThe variable domain mediates antigen binding and defines the specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the entire span of the variable domains. Instead, it is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences ofimmunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD\n\n(1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of antibody to an antigen, but\n\n-10-exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.\n\n100501 The term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody, such as a monoclonal anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations and/or post-translation modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations, etc.) that may be present in minor amounts.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized by a hybridoma culture, substantially uncontaminated by other irrununoglobulins. The modifier monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein., Nature, 256:495-97(1975); Hongo et al., Hybridoma, 14 (3):253-260 (1995), Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2d ed. 1988); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybriclomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g. ,U U.S.\n\nPatent No. 4,816,567), phage-display technologies (see, e.g., Clackson et at, Nature, 352:624-628 (1991); Marks et at,.!\n\nMot Biol. 222:581-597 (1992); Sidhu etal., J Mot Blot 338(2): 299-310 (2004);\n\nLee et al., J Mot Blot 340(5):1073-1093 (2004); Fellouse, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA\n\n101(34):12467-472 (2004); and Lee et al.,1 Immunot Methods 284(1-2):119-132 (2004), yeast presentation technologies (see, e.g., W02009/036379A2; W02010105256; W02012009568, and Xu et al., Protein Eng Des.\n\nSet, 26(10):\n\n663-70 (2013), and technologies for producing human or human-like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human inununoglobulin sequences (see, e.g., WO 1998/24893; WO 1996/34096; WO 1996/33735; WO 1991/10741;\n\nJakobovits et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad Set USA 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits etal., Nature 362:255-258 (1993);\n\nBruggemann etal., Year in Immunot 7:33 (1993); U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545,807;\n\n5,545,806; 5,569,825;\n\n5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661,016; Marks etal., Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature 368:856-859(1994); Morrison, Nature 368:812-813 (1994); Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnot 14:845-851 (1996); Neuberger, Nature Biotechnot 14:826 (1996); and Lonberg and Huszar, Intern. Rev. Immunot 13:65-93 (1995).\n\n100511 The terms \"full-length antibody,\" \"intact antibody\" or \"whole antibody\" are used interchangeably to refer to an antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, in its substantially intact form, as opposed to an antibody fragment.\n\nSpecifically whole antibodies\n\n-11-include those with heavy and light chains including an Fe region. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g, human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof. In some cases, the intact antibody may have one or more effector functions.\n\n[0052] An \"antibody fragment\" comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding and/or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab)2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S.\n\nPatent 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al., Protein Eng. 8(10):1057-1062 (1995)); single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.\n\n[0053] Papain digestion of antibodies, such as anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure, produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \"Fab\" fragments, and a residual \"Fe\"\n\nfragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (VH), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (CH1). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab)2 fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments that are capable of binding and cross-linking antigen. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the CM! domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab)2 antibody fragments may be produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n[0054] The Fe fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region, which isrecognized by Fe receptors (FcR) found on certain types of cells.\n\n[0055] \"Fv\" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a darner of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody.\n\nHowever, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen) may have the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n[0056] \"Single-chain Fv\" also abbreviated as \"sFv\" or \"scFv\" are antibody fragments that comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the sFy polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vii and VI_ domains, which enables the sFy to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of the sFy, see Pltickthun in The Pharmacology ofMonoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-VerLAG-3, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).\n\n-12-100571 \"Functional fragments\" of antibodies, such as anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure, comprise a portion of an intact antibody, generally including the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody or the Fe region of an antibody which retains or has modified FcR binding capability.\n\n100581 The term \"diabodies\" refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFy fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10 residues) between the Vii and VT_ domains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the variable domains is achieved, thereby resulting ma bivalent fragment, i.e., a fragment having two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described in greater detail in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161;\n\nHollinger et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-48(1993).\n\n100591 As used herein, a \"chimeric antibody\" refers to an antibody, such as a chimeric anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is (are) identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No.\n\n4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc.\n\nNat '1 Acad Sci. USA, 81:6851-55 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies include antibodies in which the variable region of the antibody is derived from a murine antibody, and the constant region is derived from a human antibody. As used herein, \"humanized antibody\" is a subset of \"chimeric antibodies.\"\n\n100601 \"Humanized\" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies, such as humanized forms of anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure, are chitneric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human inununoglobulin. In one embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in which residues from an HVR of the recipient are replaced by residues from an HVR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances, FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance, such as binding affinity. In general, a Inunanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin sequence, and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human itnmunoglobulin sequence, although the FR\n\nregions may include one or more individual FR residue substitutions that improve antibody performance, such as binding affmity, isomerization, immunogenicity, and the like. The number of these amino acid substitutions in the FR is typically no more than 6 in the H\n\nchain, and in the L chain, no more than 3. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an\n\n-13-inununoglobulin constant region (Fe), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see, e.g., Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329(1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct Biol. 2:593-596(1992). See also, for example, Vaswani and Hamilton, Ann.\n\nAllergy, Asthma & Immunot 1:105-115 (1998); Harris, Biochem. Soc. Transactions 23:1035-1038 (1995); Hurle and Gross, Curr. Op. Biotech. 5:428-433 (1994); and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,982,321 and 7,087,409.\n\n100611 A \"human antibody\" is one that possesses an amino-acid sequence corresponding to that of an antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, that has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art.\n\nThis definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage-display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mot Riot, 227:381 (1991);\n\nMarks et al., J. Mot Biol., 222:581 (1991). Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R.\n\nLiss, p. 77(1985); Roemer et al.,/ Immunot, 147(1):86-95 (1991). See also van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Op/n. Pharmacot 5:368-74(2001). Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge, but whose endogenous loci have been disabled, e.g., immunized xenomice (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,075,181 and 6,150,584 regarding XENOMOUSEThl technology). See also, for example, Li et al., Proc. Nati Acad Sci. USA, 103:3557-3562 (2006) regarding human antibodies generated via a human B-cell hybridoma technology.\n\nAlternatively, human antibodies can also be prepared by employing yeast libraries and methods as disclosed in, for example, W02009/036379A2; W02010105256; W02012009568; and Xu et al., Protein Eng. Des.\n\nSet, 26(10): 663-70 (2013).\n\n100621 The term \"hypervariable region\" or \"HVR\" when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody-variable domain, such as that of an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, that are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH (HI, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. See, ag.,Xu et al., Immunity 13:3745 (2000); Johnson and Wu in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003)). Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain. See, e.g., Hamers-Casterman et al., Nature 363:446-448(1993) and Sheriff et al., Nature Struct Biol. 3:733-736 (1996).\n\n100631 A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. In some embodiments, the HVRs may be Kabat complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) based on sequence variability and are the most conunonly used (Kabat et al., supra). In some embodiments, the\n\n-14-HVRs may be Chothia CDRs, Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk J. Mot Biol. 196:901-917(1987)). In some embodiments, the HVRs may be AbM HVRs.\n\nThe AbM HVRs represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody-modeling software. In some embodiments, the HVRs may be \"contact\" HVRs. The \"contact\" HVRs are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.\n\nLoop Kabat AbM Chothia Contact Li L24-L34 L24-L34 L26-L32 L30-L36 H1 1131413513 1126413513 11264132 1130-113513 (Kabat munbering) Hi 1431-1135 1126-H35 1126-1132 1130-H35 (Chothia numbering) [0064] HVRs may comprise \"extended HVRs\" as follows: 24-36 or 24-34 (L1), 46-56 or 50-56 (L2), and 89-97 or 89-96 (L3) in the VL, and 26-35 (HI), 50-65 or 49-65 (a preferred embodiment) (H2), and 93-102, 94-102, or 95-102 (H3) in the VII. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra, for each of these extended HVR defmitions.\n\n[0065] \"Framework\" or \"FR\" residues are those variable domain residues other than the HVR\n\nresidues as herein defined.\n\n100661 The phrase \"variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat\" or \"amino acid position numbering as in Kabat,\" and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., supra. Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of 112 and inserted residues (e.g., residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy-chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a \"standard\" Kabat numbered sequence.\n\n[0067] The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain (approximately residues 1-107 of the light chain and residues 1-113 of the heavy chain) (e.g., Kabat et al., Sequences of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The \"EU numbering system,\" \"EU numbering\" or \"EU index\" is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (e.g., the EU index reported in Kabat et at, supra). The \"EU index as in Kabat\"\n\nrefers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. References to residue numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. References to residue numbers\n\n-15-in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU\n\nnumbering system (e.g., see United States Patent Publication No. 2010-280227).\n\n100681 An \"acceptor human framework\" as used herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VII framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework \"derived from\" a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes.\n\nIn some embodiments, the number of pre-existing amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present in a VII, preferably those changes occur at only three, two, or one of positions 71H, 73H and 78H; for instance, the amino acid residues at those positions may by 71A, 73T and/or 78A. In one embodiment, the VL\n\nacceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.\n\n100691 A \"human consensus framework\" is a framework that represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH\n\nframework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VII\n\nsequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins oflmmunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991). For the VL, the subgroup may be, e.g., subgroup kappa I, kappa II, kappa III or kappa IV as in Kabat et al., supra. Additionally, for the VH, the subgroup may be, e.g., subgroup I, subgroup II, or subgroup III as in Kabat et at., supra.\n\n100701 An \"amino acid modification' at a specified position, e.g., of an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, refers to the substitution or deletion of the specified residue, or the insertion of at least one amino acid residue adjacent to the specified residue. Insertion \"adjacent\" to a specified residue means insertion within one to two residues thereof. The insertion may be N-terminal or C-terminal to the specified residue. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution.\n\n100711 An \"affinity matured' antibody, such as an affinity matured anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody that does not possess those alteration(s). In one embodiment, an affmity-matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies may be produced by procedures known in the art. For example, Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH- and VL-domain shuffling. Random mutagencsis of HVR\n\nand/or framework residues is described by, for example: Barbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad.\n\nSet. USA 91:3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. Gene 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al../ Immunot 155:1994-2004 (1995);\n\nJackson etal., ./ Intmunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, .1 Afol.\n\nMot 226:889-896 (1992).\n\n-16-100721 As use herein, the term \"specifically binds\"\n\nrefers to measurable and reproducible binding interactions between a target and an antibody, such as between an anti-TREM2 antibody and TREM2, that is determinative of the presence of the target within a heterogeneous population of molecules, such as biological molecules. For example, an antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, that specifically binds to a target or an epitope of the target is an antibody that preferentially binds this target or epitope, e.g., with greater affinity or avidity, than it binds to other unrelated targets or epitopcs. It is also understood that an antibody that specifically binds to a first target may or may not specifically bind to a second target. As such, \"specific binding\" does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. An antibody that specifically binds to a target may have an association constant of at least about 10 3M -lor 10 4M -1, sometimes about 10 5 M -I or 10 6 M -I, in other instances about 10 6M -Ior 10 7M -', about 10 8M -1 to 10 9M -1, or about 10 I M \"to 10 11M -101 higher. A variety of inununoassay formats can be used to select antibodies specifically iimnamoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA\n\nimmunoassays are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York, or Vashist and Luong (2018) Handbook of Immunoassay Technologies, Approaches, Performances, and Applications, Academic Press, for a description of inununoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity.\n\n100731 As used herein, an antibody \"inhibits interaction\" between two proteins when the antibody disrupts, reduces, or completely eliminates an interaction between the two proteins by binding to one of the two proteins.\n\n100741 An \"agonist\" antibody is an antibody that induces (e.g., increases) one or more activities or functions of a target upon binding to the target.\n\n[0075] An \"antagonisr antibody or a \"blocking\" antibody is an antibody that reduces or eliminates (e.g., decreases) antigen binding to one or more binding partners after the antibody binds the antigen, and/or that reduces or eliminates (e.g, decreases) one or more activities or functions of the antigen after the antibody binds the antigen. In some embodiments, antagonist antibodies, or blocking antibodies substantially or completely inhibit antigen binding to one or more binding partners and/or one or more activities or functions of the antigen.\n\n100761 Antibody \"effector functions\" refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype.\n\n100771 The term \"Fe region\" herein is used to defme a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions.\n\nAlthough the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy-chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering\n\n-17-system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody.\n\nAccordingly, a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed, antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue. Suitable native-sequence Fc regions for use in the antibodies of the present disclosure include human IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4.\n\n100781 A \"native sequence Fc region\" comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native sequence human Fc regions include a native sequence human IgG1 Fc region (non-A and A allotypes); native sequence human IgG2 Fc region;\n\nnative sequence human IgG3 Fc region; and native sequence human IgG4 Fc region as well as naturally occurring variants thereof.\n\n[0079] A \"variant Fe region\" comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fe region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, preferably one or more amino acid substitution(s). Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region.\n\nThe variant Fe region herein will preferably possess at least about 80%\n\nhomology with a native sequence Fc region, and most preferably at least about 90% homology therewith, more preferably at least about 95% homology therewith.\n\n100801 \"Fe receptor\" or \"Fe]?\" describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody.\n\nThe preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FeyRI, FeyRII, and FeyRIII\n\nsubclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors, FcyRII\n\nreceptors include FcyRIIA (an 'activating receptor\") and FcyRIIB (an \"inhibiting receptor\"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof.\n\nActivating receptor FcyRIIA contains an ittununoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (\"ITAM\") in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcyRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (\"ITIMn) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see, e.g., M. Daeron, Annu. Rev. krununot 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunot 9A57-92 (1991);\n\nCapel et al., Immunomethods 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J. Lab. Clin.\n\nMed. 126: 330-41 (1995). Other FcRs are encompassed by the term \"Felt\" herein. FcRs can also increase the serum half-life of antibodies.\n\n100811 Binding to FcR in vivo and serum half-life of human FcR high-affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcR_, or in primates to which the polypeptides having a variant Fc region are administered.\n\nWO 2004/42072 (Presta) describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to RR&\n\nSee also, e.g., Shields et al., BioL Chem. 9(2):6591-6604 (2001).\n\n-18-100821 As used herein, \"percent (%) amino acid sequence identity\" and \"homology\" with respect to a peptide, polypeptide or antibody sequence refers to the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or MEGALIGNTh (DNASTAR) software.\n\nThose skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms known in the art needed to achieve maximal aligninent over the full-length of the sequences being compared.\n\n100831 An \"isolated' nucleic acid molecule, e.g., encoding an antibody such as an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the environment in which it was produced. Preferably, the isolated nucleic acid is free of association with substantially all components associated with the production environment. The isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding the polypeptides and antibodies herein are distinguished from nucleic acid existing naturally in cells.\n\n100841 The term \"vector,\" as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a \"plasmid,\"\n\nwhich refers to a circular double stranded DNA into which additional DNA\n\nsegments may be legated.\n\nAnother type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g, non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"recombinant expression vectors,\" or simply, \"expression vectors.\" In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, \"plasmid\" and \"vector\" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most conunonly used form of vector.\n\n100851 \"Polynucleotide,\" or \"nucleic acid,\" as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present,\n\n-19-modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A\n\npolynucleotide may comprise modification(s) made after synthesis, such as conjugation to a label.\n\nOther types of modifications include, for example, \"caps\"; substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog; and internuclernide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotides(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid or semi-solid supports. The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2'-0-methyl-, 2'-0-ally1-, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, a-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as ambinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs, and basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(0)S (\"thioate\"), P(S)S (\"dithioate\"), (0)NR2 (\"amidate\"), P(0)R, P(0)OR', CO, or CH2 (\"formacetal\"), in which each R\n\nor R' is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (-0-) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA\n\nand DNA.\n\n100861 A \"host cell' includes an individual cell or cell culture that can contain or contains a vector(s) or other exogenous nucleic acid, e.g., that incorporates a polynucleotide insert(s). In some embodiments, the vector or other exogenous nucleic acid is incorporated into the genome of the host cell.. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in genomic DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell includes cells transfected in vivo with a polynucleotide(s) of this invention.\n\n100871 \"Carriers\" as used herein include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers that are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and\n\n-20-concentrations employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or inununoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEENTm, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and PLURONICSTM.\n\n[0088] The term \"about\" as used herein refers to the usual error range for the respective value readily known to the skilled person in this technical field. Reference to \"about\" a value or parameter herein includes (and describes) embodiments that are directed to that value or parameter per se.\n\n100891 As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms \"a,\" \"an,\" and \"the\"\n\ninclude plural reference unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. For example, reference to an \"antibody\" is a reference to from one to many antibodies, such as molar amounts, and includes equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.\n\n[0090] It is understood that aspect and embodiments of the present disclosure described herein include \"comprising,\" \"consisting,\" and \"consisting essentially of' aspects and embodiments.\n\nMethods of the Present Disclosure [0091] The present disclosure provides methods of treating, preventing, Of reducing risk in an individual having a CSF1R-deficient disease comprising administering to the individual in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody that binds to a TREM2 protein, where the antibody is an agonist.\n\n[0092] \"CSF1R-deficient disease,\" as used herein, refers to any disease, disorder or condition resulting from deficiencies or other defects in CSF1R signaling. In certain embodiments, the disease, disorder or condition involves a CSF1R protein with reduced function as compared to CSF1R protein considered to have \"wild type\" function or that has function considered to be within normal range. In some embodiments, CSF1R-deficient diseases are characterized by a mutation in the CSF1R gene in the affected individual. The mutation typically results in reduced fiinction of CSF1R in the affected individual. The mutation may be of any type, including, for example, a missense mutation, an indel, or a mutation generating a truncated protein product.\n\n[0093] Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that agonizing TREM2 will ameliorate the effects of CSF1R deficiency in an individual having a CSF1R-deficient disease, In certain embodiments, a TREM2 antibody as described herein may activate or increase signaling downstream of CSF1R to compensate for or otherwise rescue a CSF1R deficiency.\n\nIn certain embodiments, a TREM2 antibody as described herein may induce or increase expression of CSF1R\n\n-21-that is deficient in signaling, wherein increasing the amount of such CSFIR\n\nresults in a sufficient amount of signaling.\n\n[0094] CSF1R-deficient diseases include, without limitation, pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy and adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). In some embodiments, the CSF1R-deficient disease is ALSP. In some embodiments, the CSF1R-deficient disease is pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy.\n\nAdult-Onset Leukoeneephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia 100951 In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods of treating, preventing, or reducing risk in an individual having ALSP comprising administering to the individual in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody that binds to a TREM2 protein, where the antibody is an agonist.\n\n[0096] Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is an autosomal dominant neurological condition characterized by changes in specific regions of the brain.\n\nALSP is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding CSFIR.\n\n\"Leukoencephalopathy,\" damage to the white matter of the brain, is a classic characteristic of ALSP. In addition, axonal damage caused by swelling called spheroids, is another common characteristic of ALSP.\n\nAdditional common ALSP\n\ndisease characteristics include myelin damage, loss of myelin sheaths, gliosis, autofluorescent lipid-laden macrophages, and axon destruction. Further, it is believed that damage to myelin and axons contributes to the numerous neurological signs and symptoms of individuals afflicted with ALSP\n\n(Oosterhof et at; Rademaker eta!, Guo eta!, 2019).\n\n[0097] Common symptoms of ALSP include, but are not limited to, abnormality of the cerebral white matter, behavioral changes, dementia, parkinsonism, seizures, motor aphasia, agraphia, acalculia, apraxia, bradykinesia, slow movements, central nervous system demyelination, depressivity, depression, frontal lobe dementia, gliosis, hyperreflexia, increased reflexes, extensor plantar response, hemiparesis, quadriparesis, leukoencephalopathy, memory impairment, forgetfulness, memory loss, memory problems, poor memory, mutism, inability to speak, muteness, neuronal loss in central nervous system, loss of brain cells, postural instability, balance impairment, rapid progressivity, rigidity, muscle rigidity, shuffling gait, shuffled walk, pyramidial signs, spasticity, involuntary muscle stiffness, involuntary muscle contraction, involuntary muscle spasms, personality problems, and executive dysfunction.\n\n100981 Previously, the disease now referred to as ALSP\n\nwas thought to be two different diseases, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukoencephalopathy (FOLD). Indeed, clinicians believed that pigmented glial cells were a feature of POLD, but not HDLS. Further, clinicians believed that spheroids were a feature of HDLS, but not POLD. However, a detailed analysis of the clinical and pathological features of each disease demonstrated that patients with HDLS and POLD presented with pigmented glial cells and\n\n-22-spheroids. As such, HDLS and FOLD are now considered part of the same spectrum of diseases encompassed by ALSP (Nicholson et al. (2013)).\n\n[0099] Exemplary alternative names for ALSP include, without limitation, leukoencephalopathy, diffuse hereditary, with spheroids; adult-onset leukodystrophy with neuroaxonal spheroids; autosomal dominant leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids; hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS); neuroaxonal leukodystrophy; pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy; and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukoencephalopathy (POLL)).\n\n[00100] In some embodiments, administering an anti-TREM2 agonist antibody can prevent, reduce the risk, and/or treat adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). In some embodiments, administering an anti-TREM2 antibody induces one or more TREM2 activities in an individual having adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that agonizing TREM2 will reduce the effects of CSF1R deficiency in an individual having ALSP.\n\nPediatric-Onset Leukoeneephalopathy 101011 Pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy is a rare fatal neurological disease caused by mutations in the CSF1R gene. Pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy is characterized by distinct pediatric phenotypes including: 1) developmental regression, 2) trouble with motor skills at onset, 3) epilepsy, and 4) cognitive decline. Recent investigations demonstrate that, as compared to ALSP, which is caused by heterozygous mutations in the CSFIR\n\ngene, individuals afflicted with pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy have homozygous mutations in the CSFIR gene. Further, while individuals with pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy have many neuroimaging features that overlap with ALSP, they also have distinct neuroimaging features that are not present in individuals with ALSP (Oosterhof et al.\n\n(2019)).\n\n[0102] In some embodiments, administering an anti-T1tEM2 agonist antibody can prevent, reduce the risk, and/or treat pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy. In some embodiments, administering an anti-TREM2 antibody induces one or more TREM2 activities in an individual having pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that agonizing TREM2 will reduce the effects of CSF1R deficiency in an individual having pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy.\n\nCSF1R Mutations [0103] In some embodiments, the individual having the CSF1R-deficient disease has a mutation in the CSF1R gene. As detailed above, the human CSFIR gene encodes colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). CSFIR may also be referred to by one of the following names:\n\nC-FMS, CD1 I 5, CDI 15 antigen, CSF-I receptor, CSF-IR, CSF1R HUMAN, CSFR, FIM2, FMS, FMS\n\nproto-oncogene, CSF-I-R, M-CSF-R, B24NDDOS, v-FMS, and c-FMS proto-oncogene. The chromosomal\n\n-23-location of the CSFIR gene is 5q32 and its molecular location is base pairs 150,053,291 to 150,113,372011 chromosome 5. Further, the GenBank identifier for the CSFIR\n\ngene is NG_012303.\n\n[0104] The CSF1R protein is a type III tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor that belongs to the PDGF receptor family. Specifically, CSF1R is composed of a highly glycosylated extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain.\n\nCSF1R is a cell surface receptor that acts as the receptor primarily for CSF-1, a eytokine that regulates the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and function of mononuclear phagocytic cells, including microglia. Binding of CSF-1 to CSF1R results in the formation of receptor homodimers and subsequent auto-phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain.\n\n101051 Any sequencing method known in the art may be used to identify mutations in the CSFIR\n\ngene. For example, a non-exhaustive list of sequencing methods that can be used to identify CSFIR\n\nmutations includes Sanger sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and next generation sequencing.\n\n101061 In some embodiments, the mutation in the CSFIR\n\ngene is in the portion of the gene encoding the intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain. In some embodiments, the mutation in the CSFIR gene is in any one of exons 11-21. In some embodiments, an individual with a CSF1R-deficient disease is heterozygous for the mutation in the CSFIR gene. In some embodiments, an individual with a CSF1R-deficient disease is homozygous for the mutation in the CSFIR gene. In some embodiments, the mutation in the CSFIR gene is in the portion of the gene encoding an immunoglobulin-like domain. In some embodiments, the mutation in the CSFIR\n\ngene is in the portion of the gene encoding the transmembrane domain. In some embodiments, the mutation in the CSFIR\n\ngene is in the portion of the gene encoding the regulatory juxtamembrane domain.\n\n[0107] Exemplary mutations in the CSFIR gene include, without limitation, c.1754-2A>G\n\n(p.G585_K619delinsA), c_1766G>A (p.G589E), c1897G>A (p.E6331(), c.2297T>C\n\n(p.M766T), c.2308G>C (p.A770P), c.2320-2A>G (pC774 N814del), c.2324T>A (p.I775N), c.2381T>C\n\n(p.I794T), c.2442+5G>C (p.C774 N814delinsQGLQSHVGPSLPSSSPQAQ), c.2509G>T\n\n(p.D8371), c.2546_2548de1TCT (p.F849de1), c.2546T5C (p.F849S), c.2603T>C\n\n(p.L868P), c.2624T>C (p.M875T), and c.2632C>A (p. P8781) (Oosterhof et al; Rademaker et al.).\n\n[0108] In some embodiments, administering an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure can prevent, reduce the risk, and/or treat a CSF1R-deficient disease caused by a mutant variant of CSFIR. In some embodiments, administering an anti-TREM2 antibody may induce one or more TREM2 activities in an individual having a CSF1R-deficient disease caused by a mutant variant of CSFIR.\n\nComorbidities\n\n-24-101091 Individuals with CSF1R-deficient diseases may suffer from and/or have been diagnosed with additional diseases, such as, for example, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Alzheimer disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), atypical cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), and Parkinson disease (PD).\n\nTREM2 proteins [0110] The present disclosure provides methods of treating, preventing, or reducing risk in an individual having a CSF1R-deficient disease comprising administering to the individual an antibody that binds to a TREM2 protein wherein the antibody is an agonist.\n\n[0111] Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) is variously referred to as TREM-2, TREM2a, TREM2b, TREM2c, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2a, and triggering receptor expressed on monocytes-2. TREM2 is a 230 amino acid membrane protein.\n\nTREM2 is an inununogjobulin-like receptor primarily expressed on myeloid lineage cells, including without limitation, macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, osteoclasts, and microglia. In some embodiments, TREM2 fonrns a receptor signaling complex with DAP12. In some embodiments, TREM2 phosphorylates and signals through DAP12 (an ITAM\n\ndomain adaptor protein). In some embodiments TREM2 signaling results in the downstream activation of PI3K or other intracellular signals. On myeloid cells, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signals are important for the activation of TREM2 activities, e.g., in the context of an infection response.\n\nTLRs also play a key role in the pathological inflammatory response, e.g, TLRs expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells.\n\n[0112] TREM2 proteins of the present disclosure include, without limitation, a human TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. Q9NZC2; SEQ ID NO: 1), and a non-human mammalian TREM2 protein, such as mouse TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. Q99NH8; SEQ ID NO:\n\n2), rat TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. D3ZZ89; SEQ ID NO: 3), Rhesus monkey TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. F6QVF2; SEQ ID NO: 4), cynomolgus monkey TREM2 protein (NCBI\n\nAccession No. XP 015304909.1; SEQ ID NO: 5), equine TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No.\n\nF7D6LO; SEQ ID NO: 6), pig TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. H2EZZ3; SEQ ID\n\nNO: 7), and dog TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession Na E2RP46; SEQ ID NO: 8). As used herein \"TREM2 protein\" refers to both wild-type sequences and naturally occurring variant sequences.\n\n101131 In some embodiments, an example of a human TREM2 amino acid sequence is set forth below as SEQ ID NO: 1:\n\n-25-MEPLRLLILL FVTELSGAHN TTVFQGVAGQ SLQVSCPYDS MKHWGRRKAW CRQLGEKGPC\n\nQRVVSTHNLW - LLSFLRRWNG STAITDDTLG GTLTITLRNL QPHDAGLYQC QSLHGSEADT\n\nLRKVLVEVLA - DPLDHRDAGD LWFPGESESF EDAHVEHSIS RSLLEGEIPF PPTSILLLLA\n\nCIFLIKILAA SALWAAAWHG QKPGTHPPSE LDCGHDPGYQ LQTLPGLRDT\n\n101141 In some embodiments, the human TREM2 is a preprotein that includes a signal peptide.\n\nIn some embodiments, the human TREM2 is a mature protein. In some embodiments, the mature TREM2 protein does not include a signal peptide. In some embodiments, the mature TREM2 protein is expressed on a cell. hi some embodiments, TREM2 contains a signal peptide located at amino acid residues 1-18 of human TREM2 (SEQ ID NO: 1); an extracellular inununoglobulin-like variable-type (IgV) domain located at amino acid residues 29-112 of human TREM2 (SEQ ID NO:\n\n1); additional extracellular sequences located at amino acid residues 113-174 of htunan TREM2 (SEQ ID NO: 1); a transmembrane domain located at amino acid residues 175-195 of human TREM2 (SEQ ID NO: 1);\n\nand an intracellular domain located at amino acid residues 196-230 of human TREM2 (SEQ ID NO:\n\n1). The TREM2 cleavage site has been identified as occurring on the C-terminal side of Histidine 157 (see W02018/015573), and cleavage at that site leads to shedding of the relevant portion of the TREM2 extracellular domain, detectable as an increase in soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) corresponding to that portion of TREM2.\n\n101151 The transmembrane domain of human TREM2 contains a ly sine at amino acid residue 186 that can interact with an aspartic acid in DAP12, which is a key adaptor protein that transduces signaling from TREM2, TREM1, and other related IgV family members.\n\nAnti-TREM2 antibodies [0116] Certain aspects of the present disclosure relate to antibodies (aig, monoclonal antibodies) that bind to a TREM2 protein, where the anti-TREM2 antibody is an agonist. In some embodiments, antibodies of the present disclosure bind a mature TREM2 protein. In some embodiments, antibodies of the present disclosure bind a mature TREM2 protein, wherein the mature TREM2 protein is expressed on a cell. In some embodiments, antibodies of the present disclosure bind a TREM2 protein expressed on one or more human cells selected from human dendritic cells, human macrophages, human monocytes, human osteoclasts, human Langerhans cells of skin, human Kupffer cells, human microglia, and any combinations thereof Anti-TREM2 antibodies that induce activity and/or enhance ligand-induced activity\n\n-26-1011 7] In some embodiments, an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure is an agonist antibody that induces one or more TREM2 activities. In some embodiments the antibody induces one or more activities of TREM2 after binding to a TREM2 protein that is expressed on a cell.\n\n[0118] In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure bind to a TREM2 protein without competing with, inhibiting, or otherwise blocking one or more TREM2 ligands from binding to the TREM2 protein. Examples of TREM2 ligands include, without limitation, TREM2 ligands expressed by E. coil cells, apoptotic cells, nucleic acids, anionic lipids, APOE, APOE2, APOE3, APOE4, anionic APOE, anionic APOE2, anionic APOE3, anionic APOE4, lipidated APOE, lipidated APOE2, lipidated APOE3, lipidated APOE4, zwitterionic lipids, negatively charged phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, sulfatides, phosphatidykholin, sphingomyelin, membrane phospholipids, lipidated proteins, proteolipids, lipidated peptides, and lipidated amyloid beta peptide.\n\nAccordingly, in certain embodiments, the one or more TREM2 ligands comprise E.\n\ncoil cells, apoptotic cells, nucleic acids, anionic lipids, zwitterionic lipids, negatively charged phospholipids, phosphatidylserine (PS), sulfatides, phosphatidylcholin, sphfrigomyelin (SM), phospholipids, lipidated proteins, proteolipids, lipidated peptides, and lipidated amyloid beta peptide.\n\n[0119] Anti-TREM2 antibodies used in the methods of the present disclosure are agonist antibodies. In some embodiments, antibodies of the present disclosure that bind a TREM2 protein may include agonist antibodies that due to their epitope specificity bind TREM2 and activate one or more TREM2 activities. In some embodiments, such antibodies may bind to the ligand-binding site on TREM2 and mimic the action of one or more TREM2 ligands, or stimulate TREM2 to transduce signal by binding to one or more domains that are not the ligand-binding sites. In some embodiments, the antibodies do not compete with or otherwise block ligand binding to TREM2.\n\nIn some embodiments, the antibodies, act additively or synergistically with one or more TREM2 ligands to activate and/or enhance one more TREM2 activities, as set forth below.\n\n101201 Agonist anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may display the ability to bind TREM2 without blocking simultaneous binding of one or more TREM2 ligands. The anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may further display additive and/or synergistic functional interactions with one or more TREM2 ligands. Thus, in some embodiments, the maximal activity of TREM2 when bound to anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure in combination with one or more TREM2 ligands of the present disclosure may be greater (e.g., enhanced) than the maximal activity of TREM2 when exposed to saturating concentrations of ligand alone or to saturating concentrations of the antibody alone. In addition, the activity of TREM2 at a given concentration of TREM2 ligand may be greater (e.g., enhanced) in the presence of the antibody.\n\n101211 Accordingly, in some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure have an additive effect with the one or more TREM2 ligands to enhance the one or more TREM2 activities when bound to the TREM2 protein. In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure synergize with the one or more TREM2 ligands to enhance the one or more\n\n-27-TREM2 activities. In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure increase the potency of the one or more TREM2 ligands to induce the one or more TREM2 activities, as compared to the potency of the one or more TREM2 ligands to induce the one or more TREM2 activities in the absence of the antibody. In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure enhance the one or more TREM2 activities in the absence of cell surface clustering of TREM2.

In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure increase memory and/or reduce cognitive deficit when administered to an individual.\n\nSyk phosphotylation 101241 In some embodiments, the anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may induce spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) phosphorylation after binding to a TREM2 protein expressed in a cell.\n\n101251 Spleen tyrosine kiuiase (Syk) is an intracellular signaling molecule that functions downstream of TREM2 by phosphorylating several substrates, thereby facilitating the formation of a signaling complex leading to cellular activation and inflammatory processes.\n\n101261 In some embodiments, the ability of agonist TREM2 antibodies to induce Syk activation is determined by culturing mouse macrophages and measuring the phosphorylation state of Syk protein in cell extracts. In some embodiments, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from wild-type (WT) mice, from TREM2 knockout (KO) mice, and from mice that lack expression of functional Fc receptor common gamma chain gene (FcgR KO; REF: Takai T 1994, Cell 76(3):519-\n\n29) are starved for 4 hours in 1% sertun RPMI and then removed from tissue culture dishes with PBS-EDTA, washed with PBS, and counted. In some embodiments, the cells are coated with full-length TREM2 antibodies, or with control antibodies for 15 minutes on ice. In some embodiments, after washing with cold PBS, cells are incubated at 37 C for the indicated period of time in the presence of goat anti-human IgG. In some embodiments, after stimulation, cells are lysed with lysis buffer (1%\n\nv/v NP-40%, 50 Mm Tris-HC1 (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaC1, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10%\n\nglycerol, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors) followed by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4 C to remove insoluble materials.

In some embodiments, visualization is performed with the enhanced chemilutninescence (ECL) system (GE\n\nhealthcare), as described (e.g., Peng et al., (2010) Sci Signal., 3(122):\n\nra38).\n\nDAP1 2 binding and phosphorylation 101271 In some embodiments, the anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may induce binding of TREM2 to DAP12. In other embodiments, the anti-T1tEM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may induce DAP12 phosphorylation after binding to a TREM2 protein expressed in a cell, In other embodiments, TREM2-mediated DAP12 phosphorylation is induced by one or more SRC\n\nfamily tyrosine kinases. Examples of Src family tyrosine kinases include, without limitation, Src, Syk, Yes, Fyn, Fgr, Lek, Hck, Blk, Lyn, and Frk.\n\n101 28] DAP12 is variously referred to as TYRO protein tyrosine kinase-binding protein, TYROBP, KARAP, and PLOSL. DAP12 is a transmembrane signaling protein that contains an inummoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. In certain embodiments, the anti-TREM2 antibody may induce DAP12 phosphorylation in its ITAM motif. Any method known in the art for determining protein phosphorylation, such as DAP12 phosphorylation, may be used.\n\n101 29] In some embodiments, DAY is phosphorylated by SRC family kinases, resulting in the recruitment and activation of the Syk kinase, ZAP70 lcinase, or both, to a DAP12/TREM2 complex, [0130] In some embodiments, the ability of TREM2 antibodies to induce DAP12 activation is determined by culturing mouse macrophages and measuring the phosphorylation state of DAP12 protein in cell extracts. hi some embodiments, before stimulation with antibodies, mouse wild-type (WT) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and TREM2 knockout (1(0) BMDM are starved for 4 h in 1% serum RPM!. In some embodiments, 15x106cells are incubated in ice for 15 min with full-length TREM2 antibodies or control antibodies. In some embodiments, cells are washed and incubated at 37 C for the indicated period of time in the presence of goat anti-human IgG. In some embodiments, after stimulation, cells are lysed with lysis buffer (1% v/v n-Dodecy1-13-D-maltoside, 50 Mm Tris-HC1 (pH 8,0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1,5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors), followed by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4 C to remove insoluble materials. In some embodiments, cell lysate is immunoprecipitated with a second TREM2 antibody (R&D Systems). In some embodiments, precipitated proteins are fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (4G10, Millipore).\n\nIn some embodiments, the membrane is stripped and reprobed with anti-DAP12 antibody (Cells Signaling, D7G1X). In some embodiments, each cell lysate used for TREM2 inununoprecipitations contains an equal amount of proteins, as indicated by a control antibody (anti-Actin, Santa Cruz).\n\nProliferation, survival and functionality of TREM2-expressing cells [0131] In some embodiments, the anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may increase the proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and microglial cells (microglia) after binding to TREM2 protein expressed in a cell. In some embodiments, the anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure do not inhibit the growth (e.g., proliferation and/or survival) of one or more innate immune cells.\n\n[0132] Microglial cells are a type of glial cell that are the resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord, and thus act as the first and main form of active immune defense in the central nervous\n\n-30-system (CNS). Microglial cells constitute 200% of the total glial cell population within the brain.\n\nMicroglial cells are constantly scavenging the CNS for plaques, damaged neurons and infectious agents. The brain and spinal cord are considered \"immune privileged\" organs in that they are separated from the rest of the body by a series of endothelial cells known as the blood-brain barrier, which prevents most infections from reaching the vulnerable nervous tissue. In the case where infectious agents are directly introduced to the brain or cross the blood-brain bather, microglial cells must react quickly to decrease inflammation and destroy the infectious agents before they damage the sensitive neural tissue. Due to the unavailability of antibodies from the rest of the body (few antibodies are small enough to cross the blood brain bather), microglia mast be able to recognize foreign bodies, swallow them, and act as antigen-presenting cells activating T-cells. Since this process must be done quickly to prevent potentially fatal damage, microglial cells are extremely sensitive to even small pathological changes in the CNS. They achieve this sensitivity in part by having unique potassium channels that respond to even small changes in extracellular potassium.\n\n101331 As used herein, macrophages of the present disclosure include, without limitation, M1 macrophages, activated MI macrophages, and M2 macrophages. As used herein, microglial cells of the present disclosure include, without limitation, M1 microglial cells, activated MI microglial cells, and M2 microglial cells.\n\n101341 In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may increase the expression of CD83 and/or CD86 on dendritic cells, monocytes, and/or macrophages.\n\n101351 As used herein, the rate of proliferation, survival, and/or function of macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, and/or microglia may include increased expression if the rate of proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendrite cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and/or microglia in a subject treated with an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure is greater than the rate of proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and/or microglia in a corresponding subject that is not treated with the anti-TREM2 antibody. In some embodiments, an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure may increase the rate of proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and/or microglia in a subject by at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 100%, at least 110%, at least 115%, at least 120%, at least 125%, at least 130%, at least 135%, at least 140%, at least 145%, at least 150%, at least 160%, at least 170%, at least 180%, at least 190%, or at least 200% for example, as compared to the rate of proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and/or microglia in a corresponding subject that is not treated with the anti-TREM2 antibody.
