In addition, if the patient is affected with a hematological malignancy, DNA extracted from a non-hematological source (e.g. skin fibroblasts) is strongly recommended.\n\nPlease note that, in rare cases, mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) variants may not be detectable in blood or saliva in which case DNA extracted from post-mitotic tissue such as skeletal muscle may be a better option.\n\nRead more about our sample requirements here.\n\nLeukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, an autosomal recessive or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic leukoencephalopathy is heritable and results in white matter abnormalities but does not necessarily meet the strict criteria of a leukodystrophy (PubMed: 25649058). The mainstay of diagnosis of leukodystrophy and leukoencephalopathy is neuroimaging. However, the exact diagnosis is difficult as phenotypes are variable and distinct clinical presentation can be present within the same family. Genetic testing is leading to an expansion of the phenotypic spectrum of the leukodystrophies/encephalopathies. These findings underscore the critical importance of genetic testing for establishing a clinical and pathological diagnosis.\n\nGenes in the Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy Panel and their clinical significance\n\nTo view complete table content, scroll horizontally.\n\nGene Associated phenotypes Inheritance ClinVar HGMD\n\nNon-coding variants covered by Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy Panel\n\nTo view complete table content, scroll horizontally.\n\nGene Genomic location HG19 HGVS RefSeq RS-number AIFM1 ChrX:129274636 c.697-44T>G NM_004208.3 AIFM1 ChrX:129299753 c.-123G>C NM_004208.3 rs724160014 ALDH3A2 Chr17:19561044 c.681-14T>A/G NM_001031806.1 ALDH3A2 Chr17:19561044 c.681-14T>A NM_001031806.1 ALDH3A2 Chr17:19561044 c.681-14T>G NM_001031806.1 ARSA Chr22:51064121 c.1108-12C>G NM_000487.5 rs757806374 ARSA Chr22:51064129 c.1108-20A>G NM_000487.5 COL4A1 Chr13:110802675 c.*35C>A NM_001845.4 COL4A1 Chr13:110802678 c.*32G>A/T NM_001845.4 COL4A1 Chr13:110802679 c.*31G>T NM_001845.4 CSF1R Chr5:149440654 c.1859-119G>A NM_005211.3 D2HGDH Chr2:242680425 c.293-23A>G NM_152783.3 DARS2 Chr1:173797449 c.228-22T>C NM_018122.4 DARS2 Chr1:173797449 c.228-22T>A NM_018122.4 DARS2 Chr1:173797450 c.228-21_228-20delTTinsCC NM_018122.4 DARS2 Chr1:173797450 c.228-21_228-20delTTinsC NM_018122.4 DARS2 Chr1:173797455 c.228-16C>A NM_018122.4 DARS2 Chr1:173797455 c.228-16C>G NM_018122.4 DARS2 Chr1:173797456 c.228-15C>G NM_018122.4 DARS2 Chr1:173797456 c.228-15C>A NM_018122.4 DARS2 Chr1:173797459 c.228-12C>A NM_018122.4 rs9425753 DARS2 Chr1:173797460 c.228-11C>G NM_018122.4 rs368644758 EIF2B5 Chr3:183855941 c.685-13C>G NM_003907.2 GALC Chr14:88401064 c.*12G>A NM_000153.3 rs372641636 GALC Chr14:88459574 c.-66G>C NM_000153.3 rs146439771 GALC Chr14:88459575 c.-67T>G NM_000153.3 rs571945132 GALC Chr14:88459917 c.-74T>A NM_001201402.1 GALC Chr14:88459971 c.-128C>T NM_001201402.1 rs181956126 GJC2 Chr1:228337558 c.-170A>G NM_020435.3 GJC2 Chr1:228337561 c.-167A>G NM_020435.3 GJC2 Chr1:228337709 c.-20+1G>C NM_020435.3 L2HGDH Chr14:50735527 c.906+354G>A NM_024884.2 MLC1 Chr22:50502853 c.895-226T>G NM_015166.3 MLC1 Chr22:50523373 c.-42C>T NM_015166.3 rs771159578 NDUFAF5 Chr20:13767051 c.223-907A>C NM_024120.4 NOTCH3 Chr19:15303132 c.341-26_341-24delAAC NM_000435.2 PLP1 ChrX:103031997 c.4+78_4+85delGGGGGTTC NM_000533.3 PLP1 ChrX:103041680 c.453+28_453+46delTAACAAGGGGTGGGGGAAA NM_000533.3 PLP1 ChrX:103042405 c.454-322G>A NM_000533.3 PLP1 ChrX:103042413 c.454-314T>A/G NM_000533.3 PLP1 ChrX:103042413 c.454-314T>A NM_000533.3 PLP1 ChrX:103042413 c.454-314T>G NM_000533.3 POLR3A Chr10:79737218 c.*18C>T NM_007055.3 POLR3A Chr10:79743781 c.3337-11T>C NM_007055.3 POLR3A Chr10:79769273 c.1909+22G>A NM_007055.3 rs191875469 POLR3A Chr10:79769277 c.1909+18G>A NM_007055.3 rs267608677 POLR3B Chr12:106804589 c.967-15A>G NM_018082.5 POLR3B Chr12:106831447 c.1857-12A>G NM_018082.5 rs528038639 PSAP Chr10:73583679 c.778-26C>A NM_001042465.1 RNASEH2B Chr13:51501530 c.65-13G>A NM_024570.3 RNASEH2B Chr13:51519550 c.511-13G>A NM_024570.3 SERAC1 Chr6:158576548 c.92-165C>T NM_032861.3 SERAC1 Chr6:158576622 c.92-239G>C NM_032861.3 SNORD118 Chr17:8076761 NR_033294.1 SNORD118 Chr17:8076761 NR_033294.1 rs116395281 SNORD118 Chr17:8076762 NR_033294.1 rs201787275 SOX10 Chr22:38379877 c.-84-2A>T NM_006941.3 SOX10 Chr22:38412215 c.-31954C>T NM_006941.3 rs606231342 SOX10 Chr22:38412781 c.-32520C>G NM_006941.3 rs533778281 TTC19 Chr17:15903121 c.-42G>T NM_017775.3 rs769078093\n\nTest Strengths\n\nThe strengths of this test include:\n\nCAP accredited laboratory\n\nCLIA-certified personnel performing clinical testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory\n\nPowerful sequencing technologies, advanced target enrichment methods and precision bioinformatics pipelines ensure superior analytical performance\n\nCareful construction of clinically effective and scientifically justified gene panels\n\nSome of the panels include the whole mitochondrial genome (please see the Panel Content section)\n\nOur Nucleus online portal providing transparent and easy access to quality and performance data at the patient level\n\n~2,000 non-coding disease causing variants in our clinical grade NGS assay for panels (please see ‘Non-coding disease causing variants covered by this panel’ in the Panel Content section)\n\nOur rigorous variant classification scheme\n\nOur systematic clinical interpretation workflow using proprietary software enabling accurate and traceable processing of NGS data\n\nOur comprehensive clinical statements\n\nTest Limitations\n\nThe following exons are not included in the panel as they are not sufficiently covered with high quality sequence reads: *AP4S1* (NM_001254727:6), *DEGS1* (NM_001321541:3). Genes with suboptimal coverage in our assay are marked with number sign (#) and genes with partial, or whole gene, segmental duplications in the human genome are marked with an asterisk (*) if they overlap with the UCSC pseudogene regions. Gene is considered to have suboptimal coverage when >90% of the gene’s target nucleotides are not covered at >20x with mapping quality score (MQ>20) reads. The technology may have limited sensitivity to detect variants in genes marked with these symbols (please see the Panel content table above).\n\nThis test does not detect the following:\n\nComplex inversions\n\nGene conversions\n\nBalanced translocations\n\nSome of the panels include the whole mitochondrial genome but not all (please see the Panel Content section)\n\nRepeat expansion disorders unless specifically mentioned\n\nNon-coding variants deeper than ±20 base pairs from exon-intron boundary unless otherwise indicated (please see above Panel Content / non-coding variants covered by the panel).\n\nThis test may not reliably detect the following:\n\nLow level mosaicism in nuclear genes (variant with a minor allele fraction of 14.6% is detected with 90% probability)\n\nStretches of mononucleotide repeats\n\nLow level heteroplasmy in mtDNA (>90% are detected at 5% level)\n\nIndels larger than 50bp\n\nSingle exon deletions or duplications\n\nVariants within pseudogene regions/duplicated segments\n\nSome disease causing variants present in mtDNA are not detectable from blood, thus post-mitotic tissue such as skeletal muscle may be required for establishing molecular diagnosis.\n\nThe sensitivity of this test may be reduced if DNA is extracted by a laboratory other than Blueprint Genetics.\n\nFor additional information, please refer to the Test performance section.\n\nThe genes on the panel have been carefully selected based on scientific literature, mutation databases and our experience.\n\nOur panels are sectioned from our high-quality, clinical grade NGS assay. Please see our sequencing and detection performance table for details regarding our ability to detect different types of alterations (Table).\n\nAssays have been validated for various sample types including EDTA-blood, isolated DNA (excluding from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue), saliva and dry blood spots (filter cards). These sample types were selected in order to maximize the likelihood for high-quality DNA yield. The diagnostic yield varies depending on the assay used, referring healthcare professional, hospital and country. Plus analysis increases the likelihood of finding a genetic diagnosis for your patient, as large deletions and duplications cannot be detected using sequence analysis alone. Blueprint Genetics’ Plus Analysis is a combination of both sequencing and deletion/duplication (copy number variant (CNV)) analysis.\n\nThe performance metrics listed below are from an initial validation performed at our main laboratory in Finland.

In addition, the panel includes non-coding and regulatory variants if listed above (Non-coding variants covered by the panel). Some regions of the gene(s) may be removed from the panel if specifically mentioned in the ‘Test limitations” section above. If the test includes the mitochondrial genome the target region gene list contains the mitochondrial genes. The sequencing data generated in our laboratory is analyzed with our proprietary data analysis and annotation pipeline, integrating state-of-the art algorithms and industry-standard software solutions. Incorporation of rigorous quality control steps throughout the workflow of the pipeline ensures the consistency, validity and accuracy of results. Our pipeline is streamlined to maximize sensitivity without sacrificing specificity. We have incorporated a number of reference population databases and mutation databases including, but not limited, to 1000 Genomes Project, gnomAD, ClinVar and HGMD into our clinical interpretation software to make the process effective and efficient. For missense variants, in silico variant prediction tools such as SIFT, PolyPhen,MutationTaster are used to assist with variant classification. Through our online ordering and statement reporting system, Nucleus, ordering providers have access to the details of the analysis, including patient specific sequencing metrics, a gene level coverage plot and a list of regions with suboptimal coverage (<20X for nuclear genes and <1000X for mtDNA) if applicable. This reflects our mission to build fully transparent diagnostics where ordering providers can easily visualize the crucial details of the analysis process.\n\nWe provide customers with the most comprehensive clinical report available on the market. Clinical interpretation requires a fundamental understanding of clinical genetics and genetic principles. At Blueprint Genetics, our PhD molecular geneticists, medical geneticists, and clinical consultants prepare the clinical statement together by evaluating the identified variants in the context of the phenotypic information provided in the requisition form. Our goal is to provide clinically meaningful statements that are understandable for all medical professionals regardless of whether they have formal training in genetics.\n\nVariant classification is the cornerstone of clinical interpretation and resulting patient management decisions. Our classifications follow the ACMG guideline 2015.\n\nThe final step in the analysis is orthogonal confirmation. Sequence and copy number variants classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are confirmed using bi-directional Sanger sequencing or by orthogonal methods such as qPCR/ddPCR when they do not meet our stringent NGS quality metrics for a true positive call.\n\nOur clinical statement includes tables for sequencing and copy number variants that include basic variant information (genomic coordinates, HGVS nomenclature, zygosity, allele frequencies, in silico predictions, OMIM phenotypes, and classification of the variant). In addition, the statement includes detailed descriptions of the variant, gene, and phenotype(s) including the role of the specific gene in human disease, the mutation profile, information about the gene’s variation in population cohorts, and detailed information about related phenotypes. We also provide links to the references, abstracts, and variant databases used to help ordering providers further evaluate the reported findings if desired. The conclusion summarizes all of the existing information and provides our rationale for the classification of the variant.\n\nIdentification of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in dominant disorders or their combinations in different alleles in recessive disorders are considered molecular confirmation of the clinical diagnosis. In these cases, family member testing can be used for risk stratification. We do not recommend using variants of uncertain significance (VUS) for family member risk stratification or patient management. Genetic counseling is recommended.\n\nOur interpretation team analyzes millions of variants from thousands of individuals with rare diseases. Our internal database and our understanding of variants and related phenotypes increases with every case analyzed. Our laboratory is therefore well-positioned to re-classify previously reported variants as new information becomes available. If a variant previously reported by Blueprint Genetics is re-classified, our laboratory will issue a follow-up statement to the original ordering healthcare provider at no additional cost, according to our latest follow-up reporting policy."
