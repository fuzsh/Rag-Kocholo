        "text": "METHODS OF USE OF ANTI-TREM2 ANTIBODIES\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/944,298, filed December 5, 2019 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/005,110, filed April 3, 2020, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\nSUBMISSION OF SEQUENCE LISTING ON ASCII TEXT FILE\n\n[0002] The content of the following submission on ASCII text file is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety: a computer readable form (CRF) of the Sequence Listing (file name: 735022003240SEQLIST.TXT, date recorded: December 2, 2020, size: 88 KB).\n\nFIELD OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE\n\n[0003] The present disclosure relates to therapeutic uses of anti-TREM2 antibodies.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE\n\n[0004] Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy are rare fatal neurological diseases which alter the âwhite matterâ of the central nervous system in afflicted individuals (Freeman et al. (2009) âAdult onset leukodystrophy with neuroaxonal spheroids: Clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathologic observations.â Brain Pathol. 19(1): 39-47. PMID: 18422757; Rademakers et al. (2011) âMutations in the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene cause hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids.â Nat Genet. 44(2):200-205. PMID: 22197934; Oosterhof et al. (2019) âHomozygous Mutations in CSF1R Cause a Pediatric-Onset Leukoencephalopathy and Can Result in Congenital Absence of Microglia.â Am J Hum Genet. 104(5):936-947. PMID: 30982608). Previously, ALSP was thought to be two separate conditions, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukoencephalopathy (POLD). However, given patients with HDLS and POLD both can have pigmented glial cells and spheroids, HDLS and POLD are considered part of the same spectrum of disease encompassed by ALSP (Nicholson et al. (2013) âCSF1R mutations link POLD and HDLS as a single disease entity.â Neurology 80(11): 1033-1040. PMID: 23408870).\n\n[0005] Patients with ALSP and pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy characteristically have swelling in the axons of the brain, called spheroids. Recent research has linked mutations in the CSF1R gene to ALSP and pediatric -onset leukoencephalopathy (Rademakers et al. (2011); Nicholson et al. (2013); Oosterhof et al. (2019); Guo et al. (2019) âBi-allelic CSF1R Mutations Cause Skeletal Dysplasia of Dysosteosclerosis-Pyle Disease Spectrum and Degenerative Encephalopathy with Brain Malformation.â Am J Hum Genet. 104(5):925-935. PMID: 30982609). [0006] The human CSF1R gene encodes a protein called colony -stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Colony -stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), a homodimeric glycoprotein, is the primary ligand for CSF1R (Sherr et al. (1988) âColony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-fms).â J Cell Biochem 38(3): 179-187. PMID: 2852667). CSF1R is a type III tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor that belongs to the PDGF receptor family. Members of the receptor family have protein structures consisting of immuno globulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a protein kinase domain. Specifically, CSF1R is composed of a highly glycosylated extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular protein tyrosine-kinase domain. CSF1R is found in the outer membrane of various cell types, including macrophages, and serves as the growth factor receptor for colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) (Pridans et al. (2013) âCSF1R mutations in hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids are loss of function.â Sci Rep 3: 3012. PMID: 24145216; Ridge et al. (1990) âFMS mutations in myelodysplastic, leukemic, and normal subjects.â 87(4): 1377-1380. PMID: 2406720; Oosterhof et al; Rademaker et al). Signaling via CSF1R has been shown to regulate the proliferation and development of macrophages, including microglial cells. Specifically, CSF1R signaling may be responsible for the generation of the majority of mature macrophages, including the microglia of the brain. CSF1R deficiency negatively impacts the development of microglia in the brain (Swerdlow et al. (2009) âAutosomal dominant subcortical gliosis presenting as frontotemporal dementia.â Neurology 72(3):260-267. PMID: 19153373; Baba et al. (2006) âHereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids: clinical, pathologic and genetic studies of a new kindred.â Acta Neuropathol. Ill (4) : 300-311. PMID: 16523341; Oosterhof et al.; Rademaker et al.; Guo et al., 2019).\n\n[0007] At present, there are no effective treatment options for patients suffering from ALSP, pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy, and related diseases. Available treatments manage disease symptoms rather than treating the disease. Thus, there is a need in the art for new treatments to provide therapeutic options and improve outcomes for patients afflicted by ALSP, pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy, and related diseases.\n\n[0008] All references cited herein, including patent applications and publications, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE\n\n[0009] The present disclosure is generally directed to methods of treating individuals having a CSFlR-deficient disease comprising administering to the individual an antibody that binds to a TREM2 protein, where the antibody is an agonist.\n\n[0010] Certain aspects of the present disclosure are based, at least in part, on the discovery that an agonistic anti-TREM2 antibody significantly improved viability of human macrophages that were grown in the presence of a CSF1R inhibitor, compared to human macrophages grown in the presence of a CSF1R inhibitor and a control IgG (see, e.g., Example 2).

The non-human primates were administered control or AL2p-58 huIgGl intravenously once weekly for a total of 5 doses (N = 5 per group). The concentrations of CSF1R protein (ng CSF1R protein/mg total protein) in the frontal cortex (left panel) and in the hippocampus (right panel) at 48 hours after the fifth administration of AL2p-58 huIgGl or control are provided.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE\n\n[0036] Provided herein are methods of treating disorders and diseases associated with deficiencies or other defects in CSF1R signaling by administering an agonist of TREM2. Such diseases or disorders include, but are not limited to, diseases associated with mutations in CSF1R, such as pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy; adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP); leukoencephalopathy, diffuse hereditary, with spheroids; adult-onset leukodystrophy with neuroaxonal spheroids; autosomal dominant leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids; hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS); neuroaxonal leukodystrophy; pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy; and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukoencephalopathy (POLD). Agonists of TREM2 include anti-TREM2 antibodies that induce one or more TREM2 activities and/or enhance one or more activities induced by binding of one or more ligands to TREM2. For example, agonist anti-TREM2 antibodies may decrease soluble TREM2, induce spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) phosphorylation, induce binding of TREM2 to DAP 12, induce DAP 12 phosphorylation, increase the proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and microglial cells (microglia), or increase the activity and/or expression of TREM2-dependent genes. Definitions\n\n[0037] As used herein, the term â preventing â includes providing prophylaxis with respect to occurrence or recurrence of a particular disease, disorder, or condition, including delaying onset of a particular disease, disorder, or condition, in an individual that may be predisposed to, susceptible to, or at risk of developing such a disease, disorder, or condition, but has not yet been diagnosed with the disease, disorder, or condition.\n\n[0038] As used herein, an individual âat risk' â of developing a particular disease, disorder, or condition may or may not have detectable disease or symptoms of disease, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease or symptoms of disease prior to the treatment methods described herein. âAt riskâ denotes that an individual has one or more risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of a particular disease, disorder, or condition, as known in the art. An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing a particular disease, disorder, or condition than an individual without one or more of these risk factors.\n\n[0039] As used herein, the term âtreatment refers to clinical intervention designed to alter the natural course of the individual being treated during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include decreasing the rate of progression, ameliorating or palliating the pathological state, and remission or improved prognosis of a particular disease, disorder, or condition. An individual is successfully âtreatedâ, for example, if one or more symptoms associated with a particular disease, disorder, or condition are mitigated or eliminated.\n\n[0040] An â effective amount â refers to at least an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result. An effective amount can be provided in one or more administrations. An effective amount herein may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the treatment to elicit a desired response in the individual. An effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the treatment are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired results include eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the severity, or delaying the onset of the disease, including biochemical, histological and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease. For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include clinical results such as decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the disease, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, enhancing effect of another medication such as delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival. An effective amount of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to accomplish prophylactic or therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is understood in the clinical context, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an âeffective amountâ â may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.\n\n[0041] An â individual â for purposes of treatment, prevention, or reduction of risk refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sport, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, rabbits, cattle, pigs, hamsters, gerbils, mice, ferrets, rats, cats, and the like. In some embodiments, the individual is human.\n\n[0042] As used herein, administration âin conjunction â with another compound or composition includes simultaneous administration and/or administration at different times. Administration in conjunction also encompasses administration as a co-formulation or administration as separate compositions, including at different dosing frequencies or intervals, and using the same route of administration or different routes of administration.\n\n[0043] The term â immunoglobulin (Ig) is used interchangeably with â antibody â herein. The term âantibodyâ herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. [0044] The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. The pairing of a VH and VL together forms a single antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see, e.g., Basic and Clinical Immunology, 8th Ed., Daniel P. Stites, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parslow (eds.), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT, 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6.\n\n[0045] The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (âKâ) and lambda (âlâ), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, having heavy chains designated alpha (âaâ), delta (âdâ), epsilon (âeâ), gamma (âgâ) and mu (âmâ), respectively. The g and a classes are further divided into subclasses (isotypes) on the basis of relatively minor differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl, and IgA2. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described generally in, for example, Abbas et al, Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 4th ed. (W.B. Saunders Co., 2000).\n\n[0046] â Native antibodies â are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intra-chain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.\n\n[0047] An â isolated â antibody, such as an isolated anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, is one that has been identified, separated and/or recovered from a component of its production environment (e.g., naturally or recombinantly). Preferably, the isolated polypeptide is free from association with substantially all other contaminant components from its production environment. Contaminant components from its production environment, such as those resulting from recombinant transfected cells, are materials that would typically interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified: (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain.\n\n[0048] The â variable regionâ or â variable domain â of an antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, refers to the amino-terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain may be referred to as âVHâ and âVLâ, respectively. These domains are generally the most variable parts of the antibody (relative to other antibodies of the same class) and contain the antigen binding sites.\n\n[0049] The term â variable â refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies, such as anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure. The variable domain mediates antigen binding and defines the specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the entire span of the variable domains. Instead, it is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Rabat et alâ Sequences of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity.\n\n[0050] The term â monoclonal antibodyâ as used herein refers to an antibody, such as a monoclonal anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations and/or post-translation modifications ( e.g ., isomerizations, amidations, etc) that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized by a hybridoma culture, substantially uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier âmonoclonalâ indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein., Nature, 256:495-97 (1975); Hongo et al., Hybridoma, 14 (3):253-260 (1995), Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2d ed. 1988); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567), phage-display technologies (see, e.g., Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597 (1992); Sidhu et al., J. Mol. Biol. 338(2): 299-310 (2004); Lee et al., J. Mol. Biol. 340(5): 1073-1093 (2004); Fellouse, Proc. NatâlAcad. Sci. USA 101(34): 12467-472 (2004); and Lee et al., J. Immunol. Methods 284(1-2): 119-132 (2004), yeast presentation technologies (see, e.g, W02009/036379A2; W02010105256; W02012009568, and Xu et al., Protein Eng. Des. Sel., 26(10): 663-70 (2013), and technologies for producing human or human-like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences (see, e.g., WO 1998/24893; WO 1996/34096; WO 1996/33735; WO 1991/10741; Jakobovits et al., Proc. N at 7 Acad. Sci. USA 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature 362:255-258 (1993); Bruggemann et al., Year in Immunol. 7:33 (1993); U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661,016; Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature 368:856-859 (1994); Morrison, Nature 368:812-813 (1994); Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnol. 14:845-851 (1996); Neuberger , Nature Biotechnol. 14:826 (1996); and Lonberg and Huszar, Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93 (1995).\n\n[0051] The terms â full-length antibody ,â â intact antibody â or â whole antibody â are used interchangeably to refer to an antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, in its substantially intact form, as opposed to an antibody fragment. Specifically whole antibodies include those with heavy and light chains including an Fc region. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof. In some cases, the intact antibody may have one or more effector functions.\n\n[0052] An â antibody fragmentâ comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding and/or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S. Patent 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et alâ Protein Eng. 8(10): 1057-1062 (1995)); single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.\n\n[0053] Papain digestion of antibodies, such as anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure, produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called Fab fragments, and a residual âFcâ fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (VH), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (CHI). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab')2 fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments that are capable of binding and cross-linking antigen. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the CHI domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab')2 antibody fragments may be produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n[0054] The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy -terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region, which isrecognized by Fc receptors (FcR) found on certain types of cells.\n\n[0055] âFvâ is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen) may have the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n[0056] âSingle-chain Fvâ also abbreviated as âsFvâ or â scFv â are antibody fragments that comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains, which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of the sFv, see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-VerLAG-3, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994). [0057] â Functional fragments\" of antibodies, such as anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure, comprise a portion of an intact antibody, generally including the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody or the Fc region of an antibody which retains or has modified FcR binding capability.\n\n[0058] The term â diabodies â refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFv fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10 residues) between the VH and VL domains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the variable domains is achieved, thereby resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., a fragment having two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described in greater detail in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; Hollinger et al., Proc. Natâl Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-48 (1993).\n\n[0059] As used herein, a â chimeric antibody â refers to an antibody, such as a chimeric anti- TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is (are) identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc. Natâl Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-55 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies include antibodies in which the variable region of the antibody is derived from a murine antibody, and the constant region is derived from a human antibody. As used herein, âhumanized antibodyâ is a subset of âchimeric antibodies.â [0060] â Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies, such as humanized forms of anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure, are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immuno globulin (recipient antibody) in which residues from an HVR of the recipient are replaced by residues from an HVR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances, FR residues of the human immuno globulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance, such as binding affinity. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin sequence, and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence, although the FR regions may include one or more individual FR residue substitutions that improve antibody performance, such as binding affinity, isomerization, immunogenicity, and the like. The number of these amino acid substitutions in the FR is typically no more than 6 in the H chain, and in the L chain, no more than 3. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see, e.g.. Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992). See also , for example, Vaswani and Hamilton. Ann. Allergy, Asthma & Immunol. 1:105-115 (1998); Harris, Biochem. Soc. Transactions 23:1035-1038 (1995); Hurle and Gross, Curr. Op. Biotech. 5:428-433 (1994); and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,982,321 and 7,087,409.\n\n[0061] A â human antibody is one that possesses an amino-acid sequence corresponding to that of an antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, that has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising nonhuman antigen-binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage-display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991). Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al ., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boemer et al., J. Immunol., 147(l):86-95 (1991). See also van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 5:368-74 (2001). Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge, but whose endogenous loci have been disabled, e.g., immunized xenomice (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,075,181 and 6,150,584 regarding XENOMOUSEâ¢ technology). See also, for example, Li et al., Proc. NatâlAcad. Sci. USA, 103:3557-3562 (2006) regarding human antibodies generated via a human B-cell hybridoma technology. Alternatively, human antibodies can also be prepared by employing yeast libraries and methods as disclosed in, for example, W02009/036379A2; W02010105256; W02012009568; and Xu et al., Protein Eng. Des. Sel., 26(10): 663-70 (2013).\n\n[0062] The term â hypervariable region â or â HVR â when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody -variable domain, such as that of an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, that are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH (HI, H2, H3), and three in the VL (LI, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. See, e.g, Xu et al., Immunity 13:37-45 (2000); Johnson and Wu in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003)). Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain. See, e.g., Hamers-Casterman et al., Nature 363:446-448 (1993) and Sheriff et al., Nature Struct. Biol. 3:733-736 (1996).\n\n[0063] A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. In some embodiments, the HVRs may be Kabat complementarity -determining regions (CDRs) based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used (Rabat et al., supra). In some embodiments, the HVRs may be Chothia CDRs. Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). In some embodiments, the HVRs may be AbM HVRs. The AbM HVRs represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody -modeling software. In some embodiments, the HVRs may be âcontactâ HVRs. The âcontactâ HVRs are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.\n\n[0064] HVRs may comprise âextended HVRsâ as follows: 24-36 or 24-34 (LI), 46-56 or 50-56 (L2), and 89-97 or 89-96 (L3) in the VL, and 26-35 (HI), 50-65 or 49-65 (a preferred embodiment) (H2), and 93-102, 94-102, or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra , for each of these extended HVR definitions.\n\n[0065] â Framework â or \"FR\" residues are those variable domain residues other than the HVR residues as herein defined.\n\n[0066] The phrase â variable domain residue numbering as in Kabaf or â amino acid position numbering as in Kabat ,â and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., supra. Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g., residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy -chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a âstandardâ Kabat numbered sequence.\n\n[0067] The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain (approximately residues 1-107 of the light chain and residues 1-113 of the heavy chain) (e.g., Kabat et al., Sequences of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The âEU numbering system,â âEU numberingâ or âEU indexâ is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (e.g., the EU index reported in Kabat et al, supra). The âEU index as in Kabatâ refers to the residue numbering of the human IgGl EU antibody. References to residue numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. References to residue numbers in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system ( e.g ., see United States Patent Publication No. 2010-280227).\n\n[0068] An â acceptor human framework râ as used herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework âderived fromâ a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of pre-existing amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present in a VH, preferably those changes occur at only three, two, or one of positions 71H, 73H and 78H; for instance, the amino acid residues at those positions may by 71A, 73T and/or 78A. In one embodiment, the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.\n\n[0069] A â human consensus frameworkâ is a framework that represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest , 5 th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991). Lor the VL, the subgroup may be, e.g., subgroup kappa I, kappa II, kappa III or kappa IV as in Kabat et al, supra. Additionally, for the VH, the subgroup may be, e.g., subgroup I, subgroup II, or subgroup III as in Kabat et al., supra.\n\n[0070] An â amino acid modification â at a specified position, e.g. , of an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, refers to the substitution or deletion of the specified residue, or the insertion of at least one amino acid residue adjacent to the specified residue. Insertion âadjacentâ to a specified residue means insertion within one to two residues thereof. The insertion may be N-terminal or C- terminal to the specified residue. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution.\n\n[0071] An â affinity matured â antibody, such as an affinity matured anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody that does not possess those alteration(s). In one embodiment, an affinity -matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies may be produced by procedures known in the art. Lor example, Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH- and VL-domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and/or framework residues is described by, for example: Barbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3809- 3813 (1994); Schier et al. Gene 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al. J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al., J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992). [0072] As use herein, the term â specifically bindsâ refers to measurable and reproducible binding interactions between a target and an antibody, such as between an anti-TREM2 antibody and TREM2, that is determinative of the presence of the target within a heterogeneous population of molecules, such as biological molecules. For example, an antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, that specifically binds to a target or an epitope of the target is an antibody that preferentially binds this target or epitope, e.g., with greater affinity or avidity, than it binds to other unrelated targets or epitopes. It is also understood that an antibody that specifically binds to a first target may or may not specifically bind to a second target. As such, â specific binding â does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. An antibody that specifically binds to a target may have an association constant of at least about 10 3 M -1 or 10 4M sometimes about 10 5 M -1 or 10 6M -1, in other instances about 10 6M -1 or 10 7 M -1, about 10 8M -1 to 10 9M -1, or about 10 10 M -1 to 10 11 M or higher. A variety of immunoassay formats can be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York, or Vashist and Luong (2018) Handbook of Immunoassay Technologies, Approaches, Performances, and Applications, Academic Press, for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity.\n\n[0073] As used herein, an antibody â inhibits interactionâ between two proteins when the antibody disrupts, reduces, or completely eliminates an interaction between the two proteins by binding to one of the two proteins.\n\n[0074] An â agonist â antibody is an antibody that induces (e.g., increases) one or more activities or functions of a target upon binding to the target.\n\n[0075] An â antagonist â antibody or a â blocking â antibody is an antibody that reduces or eliminates (e.g., decreases) antigen binding to one or more binding partners after the antibody binds the antigen, and/or that reduces or eliminates (e.g., decreases) one or more activities or functions of the antigen after the antibody binds the antigen. In some embodiments, antagonist antibodies, or blocking antibodies substantially or completely inhibit antigen binding to one or more binding partners and/or one or more activities or functions of the antigen.\n\n[0076] Antibody â effector functions â refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype.\n\n[0077] The term âFc region â herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy -chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed, antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue. Suitable native-sequence Fc regions for use in the antibodies of the present disclosure include human IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. [0078] A â native sequence Fc regionâ comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native sequence human Fc regions include a native sequence human IgGl Fc region (non-A and A allotypes); native sequence human IgG2 Fc region; native sequence human IgG3 Fc region; and native sequence human IgG4 Fc region as well as naturally occurring variants thereof.\n\n[0079] A â variant Fc regionâ comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, preferably one or more amino acid substitution(s). Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a native sequence Fc region, and most preferably at least about 90% homology therewith, more preferably at least about 95% homology therewith.\n\n[0080] âFc receptorâ or â FcR â describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcyRI. FcyRII, and FcyRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors, FcyRII receptors include FcyRIIA (an âactivating receptorâ) and FcyRIIB (an âinhibiting receptorâ), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcyRIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (âIT AMâ) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcyRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (âITIMâ) in its cytoplasmic domain (see, e.g., M. Daeron, Anna. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-92 (1991); Capel et al., Immunomethods 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126: 330-41 (1995). Other FcRs are encompassed by the term âFcRâ herein. FcRs can also increase the serum half-life of antibodies.\n\n[0081] Binding to FcR in vivo and serum half-life of human FcR high-affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcR, or in primates to which the polypeptides having a variant Fc region are administered. WO 2004/42072 (Presta) describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. See also, e.g., Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 9(2):6591-6604 (2001). [0082] As used herein, â percent (%) amino acid sequence identity â and homology with respect to a peptide, polypeptide or antibody sequence refers to the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or MEGALIGNâ¢ (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms known in the art needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared.\n\n[0083] An â isolated â nucleic acid molecule, e.g., encoding an antibody such as an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure, is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the environment in which it was produced. Preferably, the isolated nucleic acid is free of association with substantially all components associated with the production environment. The isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding the polypeptides and antibodies herein are distinguished from nucleic acid existing naturally in cells.\n\n[0084] The term â vector ,â as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a âplasmid,â which refers to a circular double stranded DNA into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as ârecombinant expression vectors,â or simply, âexpression vectors.â In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, âplasmidâ and âvectorâ may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.\n\n[0085] â Polynucleotide ,â or â nucleic acid,â as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may comprise modification(s) made after synthesis, such as conjugation to a label. Other types of modifications include, for example, âcapsâ; substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog; and intemucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g ., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotides(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid or semi-solid supports. The 5â and 3â terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2â -O-methyl-, 2â-0- allyl-, 2â-fluoro- or 2â-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, a-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs, and basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(0)S (âthioateâ), P(S)S (âdithioateâ), (0)NR2 (âamidateâ), P(0)R, P(0)0Râ, CO, or CH2 (âformacetalâ), in which each R or Râ is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (-0-) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.\n\n[0086] A â host cell\" includes an individual cell or cell culture that can contain or contains a vector(s) or other exogenous nucleic acid, e.g., that incorporates a polynucleotide insert(s). In some embodiments, the vector or other exogenous nucleic acid is incorporated into the genome of the host cell.. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in genomic DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell includes cells transfected in vivo with a polynucleotide(s) of this invention.\n\n[0087] â Carriersââ â as used herein include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers that are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEENâ¢, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and PLURONICSâ¢.\n\n[0088] The term â about â as used herein refers to the usual error range for the respective value readily known to the skilled person in this technical field. Reference to â about â a value or parameter herein includes (and describes) embodiments that are directed to that value or parameter per se.\n\n[0089] As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms âa,â âan,â and âtheâ include plural reference unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. For example, reference to an âantibodyâ is a reference to from one to many antibodies, such as molar amounts, and includes equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.\n\n[0090] It is understood that aspect and embodiments of the present disclosure described herein include âcomprising,â âconsisting,â and âconsisting essentially ofâ aspects and embodiments.\n\nMethods of the Present Disclosure\n\n[0091] The present disclosure provides methods of treating, preventing, or reducing risk in an individual having a CSFlR-deficient disease comprising administering to the individual in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody that binds to a TREM2 protein, where the antibody is an agonist.\n\n[0092] âCSFlR-deficient disease,â as used herein, refers to any disease, disorder or condition resulting from deficiencies or other defects in CSF1R signaling. In certain embodiments, the disease, disorder or condition involves a CSF1R protein with reduced function as compared to CSF1R protein considered to have âwild typeâ function or that has function considered to be within normal range. In some embodiments, CSFlR-deficient diseases are characterized by a mutation in the CSF1R gene in the affected individual. The mutation typically results in reduced function of CSF1R in the affected individual. The mutation may be of any type, including, for example, a missense mutation, an indel, or a mutation generating a truncated protein product.\n\n[0093] Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that agonizing TREM2 will ameliorate the effects of CSF1R deficiency in an individual having a CSFlR-deficient disease. In certain embodiments, a TREM2 antibody as described herein may activate or increase signaling downstream of CSF1R to compensate for or otherwise rescue a CSF1R deficiency. In certain embodiments, a TREM2 antibody as described herein may induce or increase expression of CSF1R that is deficient in signaling, wherein increasing the amount of such CSF1R results in a sufficient amount of signaling.\n\n[0094] CSFlR-deficient diseases include, without limitation, pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy and adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). In some embodiments, the CSFlR-deficient disease is ALSP. In some embodiments, the CSFlR-deficient disease is pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy.\n\nAdult-Onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia [0095] In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods of treating, preventing, or reducing risk in an individual having ALSP comprising administering to the individual in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody that binds to a TREM2 protein, where the antibody is an agonist.\n\n[0096] Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is an autosomal dominant neurological condition characterized by changes in specific regions of the brain. ALSP is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding CSF1R. âLeukoencephalopathy,â damage to the white matter of the brain, is a classic characteristic of ALSP. In addition, axonal damage caused by swelling called spheroids, is another common characteristic of ALSP. Additional common ALSP disease characteristics include myelin damage, loss of myelin sheaths, gliosis, autofluorescent lipid laden macrophages, and axon destruction. Further, it is believed that damage to myelin and axons contributes to the numerous neurological signs and symptoms of individuals afflicted with ALSP (Oosterhof et ah, Rademaker et al, Guo et al, 2019).\n\n[0097] Common symptoms of ALSP include, but are not limited to, abnormality of the cerebral white matter, behavioral changes, dementia, parkinsonism, seizures, motor aphasia, agraphia, acalculia, apraxia, bradykinesia, slow movements, central nervous system demyelination, depressivity, depression, frontal lobe dementia, gliosis, hyperreflexia, increased reflexes, extensor plantar response, hemiparesis, quadriparesis, leukoencephalopathy, memory impairment, forgetfulness, memory loss, memory problems, poor memory, mutism, inability to speak, muteness, neuronal loss in central nervous system, loss of brain cells, postural instability, balance impairment, rapid progressivity, rigidity, muscle rigidity, shuffling gait, shuffled walk, pyramidial signs, spasticity, involuntary muscle stiffness, involuntary muscle contraction, involuntary muscle spasms, personality problems, and executive dysfunction.\n\n[0098] Previously, the disease now referred to as ALSP was thought to be two different diseases, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukoencephalopathy (POLD). Indeed, clinicians believed that pigmented glial cells were a feature of POLD, but not HDLS. Further, clinicians believed that spheroids were a feature of HDLS, but not POLD. However, a detailed analysis of the clinical and pathological features of each disease demonstrated that patients with HDLS and POLD presented with pigmented glial cells and spheroids. As such, HDLS and POLD are now considered part of the same spectrum of diseases encompassed by ALSP (Nicholson et al. (2013)).\n\n[0099] Exemplary alternative names for ALSP include, without limitation, leukoencephalopathy, diffuse hereditary, with spheroids; adult-onset leukodystrophy with neuroaxonal spheroids; autosomal dominant leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids; hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS); neuroaxonal leukodystrophy; pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy; and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukoencephalopathy (POLD).\n\n[00100] In some embodiments, administering an anti-TREM2 agonist antibody can prevent, reduce the risk, and/or treat adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). In some embodiments, administering an anti-TREM2 antibody induces one or more TREM2 activities in an individual having adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that agonizing TREM2 will reduce the effects of CSLIR deficiency in an individual having ALSP.\n\nPediatric-Onset Leukoencephalopathy\n\n[0101] Pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy is a rare fatal neurological disease caused by mutations in the CSF1R gene. Pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy is characterized by distinct pediatric phenotypes including: 1) developmental regression, 2) trouble with motor skills at onset, 3) epilepsy, and 4) cognitive decline. Recent investigations demonstrate that, as compared to ALSP, which is caused by heterozygous mutations in the CSF1R gene, individuals afflicted with pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy have homozygous mutations in the CSF1R gene. Further, while individuals with pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy have many neuroimaging features that overlap with ALSP, they also have distinct neuroimaging features that are not present in individuals with ALSP (Oosterhof et al. (2019)).\n\n[0102] In some embodiments, administering an anti-TREM2 agonist antibody can prevent, reduce the risk, and/or treat pediatric -onset leukoencephalopathy. In some embodiments, administering an anti-TREM2 antibody induces one or more TREM2 activities in an individual having pediatric-onset leukoencephalopathy. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that agonizing TREM2 will reduce the effects of CSF1R deficiency in an individual having pediatric- onset leukoencephalopathy.\n\nCSF 1R Mutations\n\n[0103] In some embodiments, the individual having the CSFlR-deficient disease has a mutation in the CSF1R gene. As detailed above, the human CSF1R gene encodes colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). CSF1R may also be referred to by one of the following names: C-FMS, CD115, GDI 15 antigen, CSF-1 receptor, CSF-1R, CSF 1R HUMAN, CSFR, FIM2, FMS, FMS proto oncogene, CSF-l-R, M-CSF-R, BANDDOS, v-FMS, and c-FMS proto-oncogene. The chromosomal location of the CSF1R gene is 5q32 and its molecular location is base pairs 150,053,291 to 150,113,372 on chromosome 5. Further, the GenBank identifier for the CSF1R gene is NG 012303.\n\n[0104] The CSF1R protein is a type III tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor that belongs to the PDGF receptor family. Specifically, CSF1R is composed of a highly glycosylated extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain. CSF1R is a cell surface receptor that acts as the receptor primarily for CSF-1, a cytokine that regulates the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and function of mononuclear phagocytic cells, including microglia. Binding of CSF-1 to CSF1R results in the formation of receptor homodimers and subsequent auto-phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain.\n\n[0105] Any sequencing method known in the art may be used to identify mutations in the CSF1R gene. For example, a non-exhaustive list of sequencing methods that can be used to identity CSF1R mutations includes Sanger sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and next generation sequencing.\n\n[0106] In some embodiments, the mutation in the CSF1R gene is in the portion of the gene encoding the intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain. In some embodiments, the mutation in the CSF1R gene is in any one of exons 11-21. In some embodiments, an individual with a CSF1R- deficient disease is heterozygous for the mutation in the CSF1R gene. In some embodiments, an individual with a CSFIR-deficient disease is homozygous for the mutation in the CSF1R gene. In some embodiments, the mutation in the CSF1R gene is in the portion of the gene encoding an immunoglobulin-like domain. In some embodiments, the mutation in the CSF1R gene is in the portion of the gene encoding the transmembrane domain. In some embodiments, the mutation in the CSF1R gene is in the portion of the gene encoding the regulatory juxtamembrane domain.\n\n[0107] Exemplary mutations in the CSF1R gene include, without limitation, C.1754-2A>G (p.G585_K619delinsA), c 1766G>A (p.G589E), cl897G>A (p.E633K), c.2297T>C (p.M766T), c.2308G>C (p.A770P), c.2320-2A>G (pC774_N814del), c.2324T>A (p.I775N), c.2381T>C (P.I794T), c.2442+5 G>C (p.C774_N814delinsQGLQSHVGPSLPSSSPQAQ), c.2509G>T (p.D837Y), c.2546_2548delTCT (p.F849del), c.2546T>C (p.F849S), c.2603T>C (p.L868P), c.2624T>C (p.M875T), and c.2632C>A (p.P878T) (Oosterhof et alÂ·. Rademaker et al).\n\n[0108] In some embodiments, administering an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure can prevent, reduce the risk, and/or treat a CSFIR-deficient disease caused by a mutant variant of CSF1R. In some embodiments, administering an anti-TREM2 antibody may induce one or more TREM2 activities in an individual having a CSFIR-deficient disease caused by a mutant variant of CSF1R.\n\nComorbidities [0109] Individuals with CSFIR-deficient diseases may suffer from and/or have been diagnosed with additional diseases, such as, for example, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Alzheimer disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), atypical cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), and Parkinson disease (PD).\n\nTREM2 proteins\n\n[0110] The present disclosure provides methods of treating, preventing, or reducing risk in an individual having a CSFIR-deficient disease comprising administering to the individual an antibody that binds to a TREM2 protein wherein the antibody is an agonist.\n\n[0111] Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) is variously referred to as TREM-2, TREM2a, TREM2b, TREM2c, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2a, and triggering receptor expressed on monocytes-2. TREM2 is a 230 amino acid membrane protein. TREM2 is an immuno globulin-like receptor primarily expressed on myeloid lineage cells, including without limitation, macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, osteoclasts, and microglia. In some embodiments, TREM2 forms a receptor signaling complex with DAP12. In some embodiments, TREM2 phosphorylates and signals through DAP12 (an IT AM domain adaptor protein). In some embodiments TREM2 signaling results in the downstream activation of PI3K or other intracellular signals. On myeloid cells, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signals are important for the activation of TREM2 activities, e.g., in the context of an infection response. TLRs also play a key role in the pathological inflammatory response, e.g., TLRs expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells.\n\n[0112] TREM2 proteins of the present disclosure include, without limitation, a human TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. Q9NZC2; SEQ ID NO: 1), and a non-human mammalian TREM2 protein, such as mouse TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. Q99NH8; SEQ ID NO: 2), rat TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. D3ZZ89; SEQ ID NO: 3), Rhesus monkey TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. F6QVF2; SEQ ID NO: 4), cynomolgus monkey TREM2 protein (NCBI Accession No. XP 015304909.1; SEQ ID NO: 5), equine TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. F7D6L0; SEQ ID NO: 6), pig TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. H2EZZ3; SEQ ID NO: 7), and dog TREM2 protein (Uniprot Accession No. E2RP46; SEQ ID NO: 8). As used herein âTREM2 proteinâ refers to both wild-type sequences and naturally occurring variant sequences.\n\n[0113] In some embodiments, an example of a human TREM2 amino acid sequence is set forth below as SEQ ID NO: 1:\n\n[0114] In some embodiments, the human TREM2 is a preprotein that includes a signal peptide.\n\nIn some embodiments, the human TREM2 is a mature protein. In some embodiments, the mature TREM2 protein does not include a signal peptide. In some embodiments, the mature TREM2 protein is expressed on a cell. In some embodiments, TREM2 contains a signal peptide located at amino acid residues 1-18 of human TREM2 (SEQ ID NO: 1); an extracellular immunoglobulin-like variable-type (IgV) domain located at amino acid residues 29-112 of human TREM2 (SEQ ID NO: 1); additional extracellular sequences located at amino acid residues 113-174 of human TREM2 (SEQ ID NO: 1); a transmembrane domain located at amino acid residues 175-195 of human TREM2 (SEQ ID NO: 1); and an intracellular domain located at amino acid residues 196-230 of human TREM2 (SEQ ID NO: 1). The TREM2 cleavage site has been identified as occurring on the C-terminal side of Histidine 157 (see WO2018/015573), and cleavage at that site leads to shedding of the relevant portion of the TREM2 extracellular domain, detectable as an increase in soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) corresponding to that portion of TREM2.\n\n[0115] The transmembrane domain of human TREM2 contains a lysine at amino acid residue\n\n186 that can interact with an aspartic acid in DAP 12, which is a key adaptor protein that transduces signaling from TREM2, TREM1, and other related IgV family members.\n\nAnti-TREM2 antibodies\n\n[0116] Certain aspects of the present disclosure relate to antibodies ( e.g ., monoclonal antibodies) that bind to a TREM2 protein, where the anti-TREM2 antibody is an agonist. In some embodiments, antibodies of the present disclosure bind a mature TREM2 protein. In some embodiments, antibodies of the present disclosure bind a mature TREM2 protein, wherein the mature TREM2 protein is expressed on a cell. In some embodiments, antibodies of the present disclosure bind a TREM2 protein expressed on one or more human cells selected from human dendritic cells, human macrophages, human monocytes, human osteoclasts, human Langerhans cells of skin, human Kupffer cells, human microglia, and any combinations thereof.\n\nAnti-TREM2 antibodies that induce activity and/or enhance ligand-induced activity [0117] In some embodiments, an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure is an agonist antibody that induces one or more TREM2 activities. In some embodiments the antibody induces one or more activities of TREM2 after binding to a TREM2 protein that is expressed on a cell.\n\n[0118] In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure bind to a TREM2 protein without competing with, inhibiting, or otherwise blocking one or more TREM2 ligands from binding to the TREM2 protein. Examples of TREM2 ligands include, without limitation, TREM2 ligands expressed by E. coli cells, apoptotic cells, nucleic acids, anionic lipids, APOE, APOE2, APOE3, APOE4, anionic APOE, anionic APOE2, anionic APOE3, anionic APOE4, lipidated APOE, lipidated APOE2, lipidated APOE3, lipidated APOE4, zwitterionic lipids, negatively charged phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, sulfatides, phosphatidylcholin, sphingomyelin, membrane phospholipids, lipidated proteins, proteolipids, lipidated peptides, and lipidated amyloid beta peptide. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the one or more TREM2 ligands comprise E. coli cells, apoptotic cells, nucleic acids, anionic lipids, zwitterionic lipids, negatively charged phospholipids, phosphatidylserine (PS), sulfatides, phosphatidylcholin, sphingomyelin (SM), phospholipids, lipidated proteins, proteolipids, lipidated peptides, and lipidated amyloid beta peptide.\n\n[0119] Anti-TREM2 antibodies used in the methods of the present disclosure are agonist antibodies. In some embodiments, antibodies of the present disclosure that bind a TREM2 protein may include agonist antibodies that due to their epitope specificity bind TREM2 and activate one or more TREM2 activities. In some embodiments, such antibodies may bind to the ligand-binding site on TREM2 and mimic the action of one or more TREM2 ligands, or stimulate TREM2 to transduce signal by binding to one or more domains that are not the ligand-binding sites. In some embodiments, the antibodies do not compete with or otherwise block ligand binding to TREM2. In some embodiments, the antibodies, act additively or synergistically with one or more TREM2 ligands to activate and/or enhance one more TREM2 activities, as set forth below.\n\n[0120] Agonist anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may display the ability to bind TREM2 without blocking simultaneous binding of one or more TREM2 ligands. The anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may further display additive and/or synergistic functional interactions with one or more TREM2 ligands. Thus, in some embodiments, the maximal activity of TREM2 when bound to anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure in combination with one or more TREM2 ligands of the present disclosure may be greater ( e.g ., enhanced) than the maximal activity of TREM2 when exposed to saturating concentrations of ligand alone or to saturating concentrations of the antibody alone. In addition, the activity of TREM2 at a given concentration of TREM2 ligand may be greater (e.g., enhanced) in the presence of the antibody.\n\n[0121] Accordingly, in some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure have an additive effect with the one or more TREM2 ligands to enhance the one or more TREM2 activities when bound to the TREM2 protein. In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure synergize with the one or more TREM2 ligands to enhance the one or more TREM2 activities. In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure increase the potency of the one or more TREM2 ligands to induce the one or more TREM2 activities, as compared to the potency of the one or more TREM2 ligands to induce the one or more TREM2 activities in the absence of the antibody. In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure enhance the one or more TREM2 activities in the absence of cell surface clustering of TREM2. In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure enhance the one or more TREM2 activities by inducing or retaining cell surface clustering of TREM2. In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure are clustered by one or more Fc- gamma receptors expressed on one or more immune cells, including without limitation, B cells and microglial cells. In some embodiments, enhancement of the one or more TREM2 activities induced by binding of one or more TREM2 ligands to the TREM2 protein is measured on primary cells, including without limitation, dendritic cells, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, monocytes, microglia, macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, and Kupffer cells, or on cell lines.\n\n[0122] In certain embodiments, an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure that enhances one or more TREM2 activities induced by binding of one or more TREM2 ligands to the TREM2 protein induces at least a 2-fold, at least a 3-fold, at least a 4-fold, at least a 5-fold, at least a 6-fold, at least a 7-fold, at least a 8-fold, at least a 9-fold, at least a 10-fold, at least an 11-fold, at least a 12-fold, at least a 13-fold, at least a 14-fold, at least a 15-fold, at least a 16-fold, at least a 17-fold, at least an 18-fold, at least a 19-fold, at least a 20-fold or greater increase in the one or more TREM2 activities as compared to levels of the one or more TREM2 activities induced by binding of the one or more TREM2 ligands to the TREM2 protein in the absence of the anti-TREM2 antibody.\n\n[0123] In some embodiments, TREM2 activities that may be induced and/or enhanced by anti- TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure and/or one or more TREM2 ligands of the present disclosure include, without limitation, TREM2 binding to DAP 12; DAP 12 phosphorylation; activation of Syk kinase; modulation of one or more pro-inflammatory mediators selected from IFN- b, IL-lÎ±, IL-IÎ², TNF-Î±,UM-I, IL-6, IL-8, CRP, CD86, MCP-1/CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCR2, CXCL-10, Gata3, Rorc, IL-20 family members, IL-33, LIF, IFN-gamma, OSM, CNTF, GM-CSF, CSF-1, MHC-II, OPN, CDllc, GM-CSF, IL-11, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-23, optionally where the modulation occurs in one or more cells selected from macrophages, Ml macrophages, activated Ml macrophages, M2 macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and microglial cells; recruitment of Syk, ZAP70, or both to a DAP12/TREM2 complex; increasing activity of one or more TREM2-dependent genes, optionally where the one or more TREM2 -dependent genes comprise nuclear factor of activated T-cells ( FAT) transcription factors; increased survival of dendritic cells, macrophages, Ml macrophages, activated Ml macrophages, M2 macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, microglia, Ml microglia, activated Ml microglia, and M2 microglia, or any combination thereof; modulated expression of one or more stimulatory molecules selected from CD83, CD86 MHC class II, CD40, and any combination thereof, optionally where the CD40 is expressed on dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, or any combination thereof, and optionally where the dendritic cells comprise bone marrow-derived dendritic cells; increasing memory; and reducing cognitive deficit. In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure increase memory and/or reduce cognitive deficit when administered to an individual.\n\nSyk phosphorylation\n\n[0124] In some embodiments, the anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may induce spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) phosphorylation after binding to a TREM2 protein expressed in a cell. [0125] Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is an intracellular signaling molecule that functions downstream of TREM2 by phosphorylating several substrates, thereby facilitating the formation of a signaling complex leading to cellular activation and inflammatory processes.\n\n[0126] In some embodiments, the ability of agonist TREM2 antibodies to induce Syk activation is determined by culturing mouse macrophages and measuring the phosphorylation state of Syk protein in cell extracts. In some embodiments, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from wild-type (WT) mice, from TREM2 knockout (KO) mice, and from mice that lack expression of functional Fc receptor common gamma chain gene (FcgR KO; REF: Takai T 1994. Cell 76(3):519- 29) are starved for 4 hours in 1% serum RPMI and then removed from tissue culture dishes with PBS- EDTA, washed with PBS, and counted. In some embodiments, the cells are coated with full-length TREM2 antibodies, or with control antibodies for 15 minutes on ice. In some embodiments, after washing with cold PBS, cells are incubated at 37Â°C for the indicated period of time in the presence of goat anti-human IgG. In some embodiments, after stimulation, cells are lysed with lysis buffer (1% v/v NP-40%, 50 Mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors) followed by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C to remove insoluble materials. In some embodiments, lysates are then immunoprecipitated with anti-Syk antibody (N-19 for BMDM or 4D10 for human DCs, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In some embodiments, precipitated proteins are fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Millipore). In some embodiments, to confirm that all substrates are adequately immunoprecipitated, immunoblots are reprobed with anti-Syk antibody (Abeam, for BMDM) or anti-Syk (Novus Biological, for human DCs). In some embodiments, visualization is performed with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (GE healthcare), as described ( e.g ., Peng et al., (2010) Sci Signal., 3(122): ra38).\n\nDAP 12 binding and phosphorylation\n\n[0127] In some embodiments, the anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may induce binding of TREM2 to DAP12. In other embodiments, the anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may induce DAP 12 phosphorylation after binding to a TREM2 protein expressed in a cell. In other embodiments, TREM2 -mediated DAP 12 phosphorylation is induced by one or more SRC family tyrosine kinases. Examples of Src family tyrosine kinases include, without limitation, Src, Syk, Yes, Fyn, Fgr, Lck, Hck, Blk, Lyn, and Frk.\n\n[0128] DAP 12 is variously referred to as TYRO protein tyrosine kinase-binding protein, TYROBP, KARAP, and PLOSL. DAP 12 is a transmembrane signaling protein that contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (IT AM) in its cytoplasmic domain. In certain embodiments, the anti-TREM2 antibody may induce DAP 12 phosphorylation in its IT AM motif. Any method known in the art for determining protein phosphorylation, such as DAP 12 phosphorylation, may be used.\n\n[0129] In some embodiments, DAP12 is phosphorylated by SRC family kinases, resulting in the recruitment and activation of the Syk kinase, ZAP70 kinase, or both, to a DAP12/TREM2 complex. [0130] In some embodiments, the ability of TREM2 antibodies to induce DAP 12 activation is determined by culturing mouse macrophages and measuring the phosphorylation state of DAP 12 protein in cell extracts. In some embodiments, before stimulation with antibodies, mouse wild-type (WT) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and TREM2 knockout (KO) BMDM are starved for 4 h in 1% serum RPMI. In some embodiments, 15 xlO6 cells are incubated in ice for 15 min with full-length TREM2 antibodies or control antibodies. In some embodiments, cells are washed and incubated at 37Â°C for the indicated period of time in the presence of goat anti-human IgG. In some embodiments, after stimulation, cells are lysed with lysis buffer (1% v/v n-Dodccyl-Î²-D-maltosidc. 50 Mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors), followed by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C to remove insoluble materials. In some embodiments, cell lysate is immunoprecipitated with a second TREM2 antibody (R&D Systems). In some embodiments, precipitated proteins are fractionated by SDS- PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (4G10, Millipore). In some embodiments, the membrane is stripped and reprobed with anti-DAP 12 antibody (Cells Signaling, D7G1X). In some embodiments, each cell lysate used for TREM2 immunoprecipitations contains an equal amount of proteins, as indicated by a control antibody (anti-Actin, Santa Cruz).\n\nProliferation, survival and functionality ofTREM2-expressing cells [0131] In some embodiments, the anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may increase the proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and microglial cells (microglia) after binding to TREM2 protein expressed in a cell. In some embodiments, the anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure do not inhibit the growth ( e.g ., proliferation and/or survival) of one or more innate immune cells.\n\n[0132] Microglial cells are a type of glial cell that are the resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord, and thus act as the first and main form of active immune defense in the central nervous system (CNS). Microglial cells constitute 20% of the total glial cell population within the brain. Microglial cells are constantly scavenging the CNS for plaques, damaged neurons and infectious agents. The brain and spinal cord are considered \"immune privileged\" organs in that they are separated from the rest of the body by a series of endothelial cells known as the blood-brain barrier, which prevents most infections from reaching the vulnerable nervous tissue. In the case where infectious agents are directly introduced to the brain or cross the blood-brain barrier, microglial cells must react quickly to decrease inflammation and destroy the infectious agents before they damage the sensitive neural tissue. Due to the unavailability of antibodies from the rest of the body (few antibodies are small enough to cross the blood brain barrier), microglia must be able to recognize foreign bodies, swallow them, and act as antigen-presenting cells activating T-cells. Since this process must be done quickly to prevent potentially fatal damage, microglial cells are extremely sensitive to even small pathological changes in the CNS. They achieve this sensitivity in part by having unique potassium channels that respond to even small changes in extracellular potassium.\n\n[0133] As used herein, macrophages of the present disclosure include, without limitation, Ml macrophages, activated Ml macrophages, and M2 macrophages. As used herein, microglial cells of the present disclosure include, without limitation, Ml microglial cells, activated Ml microglial cells, and M2 microglial cells.\n\n[0134] In some embodiments, anti-TREM2 antibodies of the present disclosure may increase the expression of CD83 and/or CD86 on dendritic cells, monocytes, and/or macrophages.\n\n[0135] As used herein, the rate of proliferation, survival, and/or function of macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, and/or microglia may include increased expression if the rate of proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and/or microglia in a subject heated with an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure is greater than the rate of proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and/or microglia in a corresponding subject that is not heated with the anti-TREM2 antibody. In some embodiments, an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure may increase the rate of proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and/or microglia in a subject by at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 100%, at least 110%, at least 115%, at least 120%, at least 125%, at least 130%, at least 135%, at least 140%, at least 145%, at least 150%, at least 160%, at least 170%, at least 180%, at least 190%, or at least 200% for example, as compared to the rate of proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and/or microglia in a corresponding subject that is not heated with the anti-TREM2 antibody. In other embodiments, an anti-TREM2 antibody of the present disclosure may increase the rate of proliferation, survival, and/or function of dendritic cells, macropha"
