        "text": "RESULTS\n\nProximity labeling of plaque-associated axonal spheroid proteins in postmortem brain\n\nProximity labeling is a recently developed methodology for biotinylating proteins in a subcellular compartment by genetic expression of localized peroxidases or biotin ligases in live cells [29-32]. This allows subsequent identification of the subcellular proteome by using LC-MS/MS technology [33, 34]. A modification of this approach was recently introduced for localized protein biotinylation in fixed tissues, by means of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies targeted to a subcellular compartment [35-38]. We optimized these methodologies to uncover the proteome of PAAS in both human AD postmortem brains and AD-model mice (Figures 1A-D, S1A-F). For this we took advantage of the finding that phospholipase D3 (PLD3), an endolysosomal protein, is highly accumulated within PAAS around amyloid plaques (Figures 1B and S1C) [39, 40], and is specifically expressed in neurons [39] but not in glial cells (Figures 1B and S1C, G) compared to other endolysosomal markers, such as Lamp1 (Figure S1C). Furthermore, while low levels of PLD3 are also present in neuronal cell bodies (Figure S1D), semiquantitative immunofluorescence showed that the majority of PLD3 comes from PAAS (Figure S1H). This allowed us to use PLD3 as a protein bait for proximity labeling proteomics of PAAS (Figures 1C-F and S1D, F). Parallel experiments were performed using a protein bait enriched in neuronal cell bodies (NeuN), demonstrating the subcellular specificity of this technique (Figure S1E). Proximity-labeling proteomics involved the sequential incubation of postmortem AD human or mouse brains with primary antibodies against PLD3 and secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, followed by a peroxidation reaction in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and Biotin-XX-Tyramide (Figure 1A). This led to robust biotinylation of proteins contained within PAAS, as evidenced by streptavidin labeling, with very low background outside the boundaries of these axonal structures (Figures 1C-F and S1C-F). Biotinylated proteins were pulled-down from lysed tissues and detected by streptavidin-HRP western blot, demonstrating a wide range of proteins, including the protein baits PLD3 (Figures 1G and S1K) or NeuN (Figures S1J and L). Thus, our antibody-based proximity labeling pipeline in postmortem tissues enables robust tagging and isolation of subcellularly localized proteins for subsequent mass-spectrometry-based proteomic profiling of axonal spheroids.\n\nProteomic analysis of plaque-associated axonal spheroids\n\nTo reveal the PAAS proteome, human postmortem brains of patients with intermediate to high AD neuropathology were processed for proximity labeling biotinylation of proteins within axonal spheroids. Parallel experiments were done with 15-month-old AD-model mice (5XFAD) for comparative analysis (Figures 2A, S1A-B and Table S1). By comparing the proteome derived from PLD3 antibody-labeled versus unlabeled AD brains, a total of 3,026 proteins were initially detected in AD humans and 2,371 proteins in 5XFAD mice (Figures 2B, S2A-B and Table S3). We applied a cutoff defined as p value < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1 and fold change > 1 to differentiate true and false positives (Figure 2B). After applying these cut-off parameters, 368 and 917 proteins from AD humans and 5XFAD mice remained, respectively (Figures 2B, S2C-D and Table S3), among which 186 were shared between humans and mice (Figure 2C). Importantly, we were able to detect most of the proteins that had been previously identified to be enriched in PAAS (Figures 2D-E, 3A, C, E, S3-1A and Table S2-3)[5, 16, 18, 20, 41, 42].\n\nBioinformatic analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) annotation revealed that PAAS proteomic hits in humans and mice were classified within similar biological processes (i.e vesicle organization and fusion) and cellular components (i.e. presynapse, secretory vesicle) (Figures 2F-G and Table S3). These results reflected the axonal origin of PAAS and the massive accumulation of endolysosomal organelles within them. On the other hand, GO analysis of proteins that were excluded by the cutoff, showed a completely different classification pattern (Figure S2E). Moreover, proximity labeling of proteins in a different neuronal subcellular compartment using the protein bait NeuN as a bait, yielded a completely different proteome (Figure S2F and Table S3), highlighting the subcellular specificity of our proximity labeling proteomics pipeline.\n\nUncovering the molecular architecture of plaque-associated axonal spheroids\n\nTo further understand the protein networks and signaling involved in axonal spheroid pathology, we next performed protein-protein interaction analysis. We identified five main protein clusters in humans: endocytosis, phagosome, synapse, proteasome and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Figure 3A-B and Table S3). These clusters comprised around ∼50% of the PAAS proteome in humans and were mostly conserved in mice (Figures S3-1A and B). This is in agreement with the current cell biology knowledge, showing that the majority of the PAAS volume is occupied by endolysosomal vesicles [13, 14]. Notably, using signaling pathway analysis, we uncovered many pathways that were not previously appreciated to be involved in PAAS such as axon guidance, calcium and mTOR signaling (Figures 3D, S3-1C-F and Table S3), in addition to those related to the known PAAS cell biology (Figure 3D, S3-1C, S3-1G-H and Table S3). These results were cross-validated using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which highlighted similar signaling pathways, including lysosome, proteosome, ubiquitin mediated-proteolysis and mTOR (Figures S3-1I-J and Table S3).\n\nGuided by the proteomic analysis, we next selected a diverse set of proteomic hits for further validation by means of high-resolution immunofluorescence confocal imaging (Figures 3E and S3-2). We discovered proteins not previously known to be present in PAAS, that are involved in diverse cell biological functions (see diagram in Figures 3E, S3-2 and Table S2). Amongst those, we found lysosome-related proteins GAA, GBA and TPP1 (Figures 3E, S3-2A-B and S3-2P-Q); phagosome protein ATP6V0A1 (Figures 3E and S3-2C); fusion and endocytosis-related protein SYT11 (Figures 3E and S3-2D); actin cytoskeleton proteins RAC1 and SPTBN1 (Figures 3E and S3-2E-F); stress granule markers G3BP1 and G3BP2 (Figures 3E and S3-2L-O); calcium signaling molecules CAMK2A, ATP2B3, CACNA2D1 and CACNA1B (Figures 3E, S3-2G-K and R); PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins PIK3R4, AKT1, mTOR, LAMTOR, RAGA, RAGC and RAPTOR (Figures 3E, 4A and S4A), as well as transmembrane proteins and receptors ITM2B and NTRK2 (Figures 3E and S3-2M-N). Comparative analysis of protein abundance and subcellular distribution revealed similarities and differences between mice and humans (Figures S3-2A-B v.s. P-Q; G v.s. R; and S4B) that are likely to be important for future data interpretation. Altogether, our data revealed previously unappreciated protein networks and signaling pathways that may be critical for the pathogenesis of PAAS.\n\nPhosphorylated mTOR accumulates within axon spheroids as Alzheimer disease progresses\n\nOur data directed our attention to the mTOR signaling pathway, given that it is one of the most significant pathways in our proteomic analysis (Figures 3D-E and S3-1C, D, J) and that it plays critical roles in autophagy, lysosome biogenesis and local protein synthesis [23-25]. Immunofluorescence staining showed that proteins involved in mTOR signaling are enriched in axonal spheroids in postmortem human brains of patients with both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD (Figures 4 and S4A-B). Strikingly, phosphorylated-mTOR-S2448 was highly enriched in spheroids of patients with intermediate to high AD neuropathology but not in those with low AD neuropathology (Figures 4B-C), indicating that this protein can be used as a hallmark to distinguish AD brains at various disease stages (Figure 4D). Furthermore, this raises the possibility that the mTOR signaling pathway may be mechanistically involved in the formation and growth of axonal spheroids around plaques.\n\nHuman iPSC modeling recapitulates PAAS pathology\n\nTo establish a broad strategy to genetically and pharmacologically manipulate selected proteomic hits to investigate their potential roles in spheroid formation, we made use of long-term human iPSC-derived NGN2-induced glutamatergic neuron [43] and astrocyte co-cultures (Figures 5A-B and S5A-B). This system has recently been shown to be capable of recapitulating the formation of axonal spheroids following administration of exogenous aggregated beta amyloid [44]. Our optimized model showed the formation of ThioflavinS positive amyloid deposits (Figures 5B and S5C) that were surrounded by massive halos of axonal spheroids. These spheroids were enriched with autophagosomes and lysosomes (Figures 5B-C and S5D, F), and expressed phosphorylated Tau S235, S396 and S404 (Figure S5E), thus greatly resembling axonal spheroids in humans (Figure 1B). This human iPSC-derived AD model is a versatile system that allows efficient pharmacological and viral-mediated manipulations, thereby allowing mechanistic investigation of PAAS pathology in human neurons.\n\nmTOR signaling inhibition reduces PAAS pathology in human neurons\n\nWe next tested the role of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in the formation and growth of axonal spheroids. Like in postmortem human brain (Figures 4A and S4A), our iPSC-derived AD model demonstrated similar enrichment of proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway (Figures 5C and S5F). We thus tested whether pharmacological inhibition of mTOR, using Torin1, an mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor [45, 46], had any impact in the overall degree of axonal spheroid pathology. Our results showed that Torin1 treatment was able to reduce p-mTOR S2448 expression in PAAS (Figures 5D-E), indicating target engagement. Importantly, we found that both the size of individual spheroids as well as the overall number of spheroids was markedly reduced following this treatment (Figures 5F-I), without significant changes in axonal density (Figure 5J), neuronal soma or amyloid plaque size (Figures 5K, S5G and S5H). These data suggests that mTOR signaling is involved in the progression of amyloid-induced axonal spheroid formation in human neurons.\n\nmTOR signaling inhibition reduced PAAS pathology in vivo\n\nTo determine if the effect of mTOR signaling inhibition is conserved in the in vivo setting, we developed a method for viral-mediated genetic knockdown of proteins in neurons in the mouse brain, using a Cre/lox system (Figures 6A-C and S6A-B). To achieve this, we used heterozygous Mtor-floxed-5XFAD mice [47], and infected them with AAV9-hsyn-cre-2a-tdTomato virus, which allows sparse neuronal infection and visualization of individual spheroids (Figures 6D-E). Analysis of this treatment showed that individual axonal spheroid sizes were reduced by mTOR knockdown (Figure 6F-G). To determine if the overall spheroid halo sizes were also affected by this treatment, we next infected mice with AAV-PHP.eB-CAG-GFP vector which allows efficient neuronal infection (Figures 6H and S6C). Our results showed that in addition to individual axonal spheroids around plaques, heterozygous Mtor knockout significantly reduced the size of the overall axonal spheroid halos around plaques (Figure 6I-J and S6D). Importantly, these treatments had no effect on either amyloid plaque size (Figure S6F) nor overall neuronal cell body size (Figures 6K and S6E), which could potentially confound interpretation of the observed reduced spheroid pathology. Our in vivo results in mice were consistent with our in vitro results using human neurons, and indicate that mTOR signaling may be a potential therapeutic target for reducing axonal spheroid pathology.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nDespite the fact that dystrophic neurites around plaques were identified more than a century ago [9] and they are one of the most prevalent neuropathological hallmarks in AD [10, 13, 48, 49], these plaque associated axonal spheroids have not been systematically studied because of a lack of appropriate methodologies [4, 6]. In this study, we implemented for the first time a comprehensive approach including spatial proteomics, human iPSC-derived neuronal modeling and in vivo mouse genetic manipulations, to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of PAAS formation. Specifically, we optimized proximity labeling proteomics methodologies based on antibody-mediated biotinylation [35], which allowed us to uncover the molecular architecture of PAAS in postmortem human brains and AD-model mice. Using bioinformatics analysis and high-resolution confocal imaging validation, we identified many proteins and signaling pathways previously not known to be enriched in PAAS. To investigate the functional implications of these pathways on the pathogenesis of axonal spheroids in humans, we optimized a human iPSC-derived neuron-astrocyte co-culture system [44] that recapitulates the formation of PAAS. Axonal spheroids in this model strikingly resemble those seen in humans, including their massive accumulation of endolysosomal vesicles [13, 14] and cytoskeletal features, such as tau hyperphosphorylation [21, 50]. Collectively, our subcellularly resolved axonal spheroid proteomic database combined with a tractable iPSC axonal spheroid modeling, and in vivo genetic manipulations constitutes an important approach for future mechanistic investigation and therapeutic testing aimed at axonal spheroid pathology in AD. Specifically, our studies indicate the therapeutic potential of mTOR signaling for reducing axonal spheroid pathology.\n\nUncovering the axonal spheroid proteome using proximity-labeling proteomics\n\nProximity labeling proteomics with subcellular resolution is a technique that overcomes the lack of cellular and subcellular specificity of conventional tissue proteomics of micro-dissected amyloid plaques [51-53]. Importantly, the use of an antibody-based biotinylation approach [35, 36] to tag proteins in axonal spheroids, without the need for overexpression of an exogenous peroxidase or biotin ligase [29, 30, 33], allowed us to obtain a comparative proteome in humans and mice, using widely available postmortem tissues. We used PLD3 as an antibody bait because this lysosomal protein is highly enriched in PAAS of both humans and mice [39, 40]. Furthermore, PLD3 is almost exclusively expressed in neurons [39], thus reducing the potential for lysosomal contamination from other cell types.\n\nUsing this proteomic strategy, we identified many proteins that were unknown to be enriched in PAAS as well as those previously identified in these structures (Table S2 and S3), Many of the PAAS-enriched proteins were presented in both humans and mice, suggesting conserved mechanisms in the formation of spheroids. Bioinformatic analysis highlighted five main conserved networks of protein-protein-interactions including endocytosis, synapse, phagosome, proteosome and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Figures 3A-C and S3-1A-B). In addition, it also revealed signaling pathways including axon guidance, actin cytoskeleton, calcium, mTOR signaling and others (Figures 3D and S3-1C-F, J). We also noticed differences in expression levels and subcellular protein distributions between species, such as in GBA, SYT11, CAMK2, TPP1 and mTOR (Figures S3-2A, D, G, P-R and S4B). This suggests possible distinct molecular and cellular mechanisms and highlights the importance of performing parallel molecular studies in mice and humans.\n\nAmong the diverse signaling pathways identified by proteomics analysis, several possible mechanisms may be involved in PAAS formation and growth, including cytoskeletal deregulation, proteolysis dysfunction, calcium homeostasis, and mTOR signaling. In terms of cytoskeletal deregulation, we found that PAAS were enriched in various proteins belonging to signaling pathways such as axon guidance (Figures 3D and S3-1F), actin cytoskeletal signaling (Figure S3-1C), dynein heavy chain binding, filamin binding and Ral GTPase binding (Figure S3-1A-B). This suggests that cytoskeletal reorganization and plasticity could be important events in the initial formation and enlargement of PAAS. One possibility is that such cytoskeletal changes could impact retrograde and anterograde axonal cargo transport, ultimately leading to accumulation of endolysosomal vesicles [16, 54, 55] and the consequent expansion of the axon into a spheroid. Regarding proteolysis dysfunction: proteomics data revealed accumulation of proteins involved in endocytosis, phagosome, proteosome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and lysosome acidification (ATPase complex) (Figures 3A, B, D and S3-1A-C). Previous data showed protease-deficient lysosomes and autophagosome accumulated within PAAS [13], while disruption of lysosomal proteolysis caused axonal dystrophy [15]. The data suggests that focal disruption in lysosomal function within axonal segments around plaques can cause spheroid formation and growth. Pertaining to calcium homeostasis, we showed that calcium signaling proteins, such as CAMK2, calmodulin and voltage-gated calcium channel proteins CACNA1B and CACNA1D1 (Figures 3D-E, S3-1E and S3-2G-K, R), are enriched in PAAS suggesting that local calcium signaling dysregulation plays a role in PAAS pathogenesis. Interestingly, recent data showed abnormal local calcium efflux from deacidified late endosomes and amphisomes affecting axonal transport of these vesicles in PSEN1 knockout mice [56]. As for mTOR signaling, the PI3K/AkT/mTOR pathway was prominently highlighted in several of our bioinformatic analyses (Figures 3D-E, S3-1D, E, J). Importantly, we found that in human postmortem brain, phosphorylated mTOR is highly enriched in axonal spheroids (Figures 4A-B and S4A, D), and its levels correlated with the severity of disease (Figures 4B-D). Given that PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling can inhibit cell autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, an intriguing possibility is that dysregulated mTOR signaling could be an early mechanism in the accumulation and dysfunction of endolysosomal organelles [11, 12] leading to spheroid expansion.\n\niPSC modeling and genetic in vivo molecular modulation uncover targets with therapeutic potential\n\nIn recent years, human iPSC technology has facilitated investigation of Alzheimer mechanisms [57-61]. To further understand the mechanistic role of signaling molecules found to be enriched in PAAS, we optimized a human iPSC neuron-astrocyte co-culture model [44] that recapitulated well the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, including amyloid deposits, axonal spheroids and intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated tau. This system allowed for the first-time testing of the role of selected pathways potentially involved in PAAS pathology using genetic and pharmacological manipulations in human neurons. Together with our in vivo viral vector-mediated manipulations in AD-model mice, these methods constitute a comprehensive approach to examine potential targets derived from our proteomic dataset.\n\nAs a proof of concept, we focused on PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling given that it was one of the most highlighted pathways by multiple bioinformatic analyses of our PAAS proteomics data (Figures 3D-E, S3-1D, E, J) and phosphorylated mTOR was found to be a strong marker of severe\n\nPAAS pathology (Figures 4A-B and S4A, D). Using the iPSC-derived AD model we showed that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signaling led to a marked reduction in PAAS pathology (Figures 5D-J). Furthermore, viral vector-mediated genetic knockdown of mTOR in AD-model mice (Figures 6A-B and S6A-E), also demonstrated a reduction in PAAS (Figures 6C-E and S6D-E). While mTOR is known to be a regulator of cell growth and maturation [25, 45], our mTOR manipulations did not affect overall neuronal cell body size nor axon density (Figures 5J, K and S5G). Thus, the effect of mTOR modulation was selective to PAAS, supporting the role of the PI3K/AkT/mTOR singling pathway in PAAS formation or growth and highlighting its therapeutic potential.\n\nAlthough the sequence of events leading to spheroid formation remains unclear, our data supports the idea that spheroids form as a result of extracellular amyloid deposition rather than themselves being the source of focal amyloid deposition [16, 62]. The causal effect of aggregated extracellular amyloid is clearly demonstrated in our human iPSC experiments, where we show that exogenous administration of amyloid can induce PAAS that resemble those in humans and mice. Even though in this model neurons are widely exposed to diffuse amyloid β, axonal spheroids were only observed in the vicinity of compact thioflavin S positive deposits (Figures 5B, S5C and S5F). This is consistent with previous observations in humans showing that many diffuse amyloid deposits (those labeled with anti-amyloid β antibodies but not with thioflavin S), are not surrounded by PAAS, while the vast majority of thioflavin S positive deposits have extensive PAAS around them [63].\n\nAxonal spheroid pathology can also be found in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Niemann-Pick disease type C [64], Nasu Hakola disease [65], leukoencephalopathy caused by CSF1R mutations [66], Huntington’s disease [67] and others. Thus, the proteomic dataset, iPSC-derived AD model and in vivo mouse genetic manipulation strategies that we established will facilitate future mechanistic studies addressing the diversity of cell biological processes that govern axonal spheroid pathology in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nLimitations and future directions\n\nThere are several potential limitations of the current study. First, given the proximity labeling reaction radius is reported to be around 10-20 nm, some proteins that are not in close proximity to PLD3 may have not been detected in the PAAS proteome. However, PLD3 is highly enriched in axonal spheroids, thus increasing the probability of protein biotinylation. This is evidenced by the fact that we were able to capture the majority of proteins previously described to be enriched in axonal spheroids (Figures 3 and S3-1). Second, although PLD3 is enriched in spheroids of both AD humans and mice, some labeling occurs at neuronal cell bodies (∼27% of PLD3 signal is derived from cell bodies) (Figures S1D and S1H) [68, 69]. Thus, our proteomics dataset may include some neuronal cell body-specific proteins, in addition to those specifically expressed in axonal spheroids as well as in both cellular compartments. Third, we were unable to compare the levels of the various PAAS proteins at different stages of disease progression because the reduced number of plaques and axonal spheroids in very early stages of the disease markedly limited the signal-to-noise ratio of the proteomic analysis. Alternatively, quantitative protein comparisons at different stages of disease could be done using emerging techniques for multiplexed high resolution quantitative imaging [70]. While we show that the human iPSC-derived AD model recapitulates the formation of spheroids around amyloid plaques, this occurs in a relatively rapid manner that may not reflect the in vivo situation. Thus, future models may need to be perfected for more chronic buildup of amyloid deposits. In addition, co-culturing with other cell types, such as microglia, may provide additional features that better resemble the in vivo plaque microenvironment.\n\nMETHODS\n\nHuman postmortem brain tissue\n\nSnap frozen postmortem human brain specimens of frontal cortices from AD patients and age-matched controls were obtained from the Yale Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Banner Sun Health Research Institute. Detailed demographic and clinical information can be found in Figure S1 and Table S1. For proximity labeling proteomics, three AD cases with high Neuropathologic Changes score [48]: A2-3, B3, C2-3 and three age-matched controls ((Neuropathologic changes score: A0-1, B1, C0) were used. To reduce inter-sample variability and maximize signal-to-noise by avoiding brains with low-density amyloid deposition, we carefully inspected ∼20 individual postmortem brains using microscopy and selected for proteomic analysis the top 3 AD brains with the highest density of amyloid plaques and axonal spheroids within the frontal cortex. For immunofluorescence proteomic validations, 13 severe AD cases and 9 no/mild AD cases were used.\n\nHuman iPSC line and human primary astrocytes\n\nA de-identified control human iPSC line NSB3182-3 (female) was used in all experiments, fully characterized [74]. NGN2-induced glutamatergic neurons [43] were generated and co-cultured with human primary astrocytes (ThermoFisher #N7805200) for all experiments [44].\n\nMice\n\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University. WT (C57BL/6J), 5XFAD (Tg6799) mice [75] and mTOR-flox (JAX #011009) mice [47] were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. 5XFAD and WT mice, used for proximity labeling proteomics, were euthanized at 15-month-old, followed by transcardial perfusion. Three male mice per genotype (WT and 5XFAD) were used. Animals used for immunofluorescence proteomic validation were euthanized at 2-3 or 12-15 months of age, with 3 biological replicates per experiment. mTOR-flox mice were cross-bred with 5XFAD mice to create an mTOR-flox-5XFAD line. For AAV mediated mTOR heterozygous knockout experiments, mTOR-flox-5XFAD mice were injected with AAVs at 6 weeks of age. Five biological replicates (combining male and female mice) in each group were used for AAV9-hSyn-cre-2a-tdT experiment, and 3 male mice in each group were used for AAV-PHPeB experiment.\n\nAntibodies and reagents\n\nFull list of primary antibodies for known and newly validated PAAS proteins can be found in Table S2, including catalog number, RRID, dilution factors and brief staining instructions. Briefly, Anti-PLD3 antibody, anti-SMI312 and anti-Cathespin D were used to label PAAS in both mice and humans. Anti-Lamp1 and anti-Cathespin B antibodies were used to label PAAS in mice. For proteomic hits validation, anti-GAA, anti-GBA, anti-TPP1, anti-ATP6V0A1, anti-SYT11, anti-G3BP1, anti-G3BP2, anti-ITM2B, anti-SPTBN1, anti-SV2A, anti-ATP2B3, anti-CAMK2A, anti-Calmodulin, anti-SYT1, anti-CACNA2D1, anti-CACNA1B, anti-NTRK2, anti-mTOR, anti-p-mTOR S2448, anti-PIK3R4, anti-AKT1, anti-LAMTOR, anti-RAGA, anti-RAGC, anti-RHEB, anti-RAPTOR were used for validating newly identified PAAS proteins. Anti-RAGC, anti-ATG9A, anti-Ubiquitin, anti-RTN3, anti-PKC, anti-synaptophysin, anti-SNAP25, anti-VAMP2, anti-beta Tubulin III, anti-LC3B were used for immunostaining of known PAAS proteins. To reveal GFP and tdTomato protein expression, anti-GFP (1:500, RRID:AB_10000240) and anti-RFP (1:200, RRID:AB_2209751) were used respectively. For staining neuronal and glial markers in iPSC-derived human neurons, anti-neurofilament H (1:1000, RRID:AB_2149761), anti-NeuN (1:1000, RRID:AB_10711040), anti-NeuN (1:200, RRID:AB_2532109), anti-Synapsin1/2 (1:500, RRID:AB_2622240), anti-PSD95 (1:200, RRID:AB_10807979), anti-S100b (1:500, RRID:AB_2814881), anti-IBA1 (1:100, RRID:AB_2891289) were used. To stain amyloid beta deposits, anti-6e10 (1:200, RRID:AB_2565328) was used. To stain phosphorylated Tau, anti-phospho-Tau S235 (1:1000, Thermo-Fisher), anti-phospho-Tau S396 (1: 200) and anti-phospho-Tau S404 (1:200) were used (RRID see Table S2). Dendritic marker MAP2 (1:200, RRID:AB_776174) was used. Thioflavin S (Sigma-Aldrich, T1892, 2% w/v stock solution, 1:10k staining) was used to label amyloid plaques. Alexa dye conjugated secondary antibodies were used (1:600, ThermoFisher Scientific).\n\nTissue fixation\n\nWe have compared the impact of different tissue fixation approaches on the proximity labeling efficacy and protein extraction efficiency. For human brain samples, snap frozen postmortem human brains coupled with fresh fixation in 4% PFA at 4 °C for ∼24 hours worked the best; for mice, freshly perfused mouse brains and fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C for ∼24 hours performed the best in both proximity labeling efficacy and protein extraction efficiency. We found that long term fixation and storage with FFPE markedly reduced both proximity labeling and protein extraction efficiencies.\n\nProximity labeling in brain tissue\n\nProximity labeling in human and mice tissue was performed based on [35] with optimizations. Axonal spheroids were proximity labeled by using anti-PLD3 antibodies in both mice and humans. Neuronal soma were proximity labeled using anti-NeuN antibody. Briefly, frozen postmortem human brain specimens were fixed by submerging into ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde, and put onto a shaker at 4 °C for ∼ 24 hours. For mice, after transcardial perfusion, brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for ∼ 24 hours while shaking. Human and mouse brains were vibratome sectioned at 50 μm thickness. Ten sections (around 1cm x 0.8cm each) for human or mouse brain were used in each reaction/per biological replicate. Human sections contained mostly grey matter. Three biological replicates were used in each group. Sections were permeabilized by PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 7 min, followed by rinsing with PBST (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS). To quench the endogenous peroxidase activity, sections were incubated in 0.1% H2O2 for 10 min, followed by rinsing with PBST twice. Primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (0.1% Tween-20 with 1% BSA in PBS) was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a shaker, followed by PBST washes for 3 times 20 min/per wash. Secondary antibody conjugated with HRP was incubated in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by PBST washes for 3 times ∼40 min/per wash. Proximity labeling was performed by using Biotin-XX-Tyramide (ThermoFisher Scientific) dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 7.4), with H2O2 for 5 min. Biotinylation reactions were terminated by rinsing sections with freshly made 500 mM sodium ascorbate for 3 times, followed by PBST washes for 3 times.\n\nEnrichment of biotinylated proteins\n\nWe performed proximity labeling proteomics on fixed brain specimens, which may reduce the protein extraction yield compared to other proximity labeling methods using fresh tissue. Thus, we optimized the protein extraction protocol and largely increased the protein extraction yield compared to previously published methods (Figure S1I)[35]. Specifically, brain sections from proximity labeling experiments were lysed and de-crosslinked in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 8.0) with 2% SDS and protease inhibitor (Roche) at 95 °C for 45 min with constant shaking. For every 10 brain sections, 500uL lysis buffer was used. Protein lysate was sonicated using Sonic Dismembrator Model 500 (Fisher Scientific) for 3 times, 3 sec/per time at 4°C. Protein lysate was centrifuged at 12k rcf for 5 min. Then, 450 µL protein lysate supernatant was collected from each sample, incubated with 550 µL of PBST containing 200 µL prewashed streptavidin magnetic beads (ThermoFisher Scientific), protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor, to meet a final 1mL volume. Samples were then incubated on a 360° rotator at 4 °C overnight. The rest of protein lysate were used for protein concentration measurement by BCA (ThermoFisher Scientific). After incubation, beads were sequentially washed once with PBST, twice with PBST with 1 M NaCl, twice with PBS. Biotinylated proteins were eluted in elution buffer (20 µL of 20 mM DTT and 2 mM Biotin in 1X NuPAGE LDS lysis buffer (ThermoFisher) with protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor) at 95 °C for 5min. Supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 12k rcf for 1min, followed by running into a 4%–20% Tris-Glycine gel (Invitrogen) at constant 150 V until all the proteins had run into the gel (approximately 10min). Gel was rinsed once in ultrapure water (AmericanBio) and incubated in ∼50 mL of Coomassie blue R-250 staining solution (Bio-Rad) for 1 hour incubation. Gel was de-stained with Coomassie blue R-250 destaining solution (Bio-Rad) for 2 hours with 3 times buffer changes. Gel was rinsed with ultrapure water for three times. Gel containing protein samples was visualized, cut with clean blades, and kept at −20 °C.\n\nWestern blotting\n\nFor western blot, 4%–20% Tris-Glycine gels (Invitrogen) were used for protein electrophoresis following the manufacturer’s protocol. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad) at constant 350 mA for about 50 min. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 hour, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-PLD3 1:250; anti-NeuN 1:1000; anti-GAPDH 1:1000) diluted in 5% BSA in TBST on a shaker at 4 °C overnight, followed by three times of 15min washes with TBST. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA in TBST for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by three times of 15min washes with TBST. To blot biotinylated proteins on the same membrane, stripping buffer (ThermoFisher #46430) was used to cover the whole membrane and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 10-12 min, followed by rinsing with PBST for 3 times. HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000) was diluted in blocking buffer for 1-2 hours at room temperature or 4 °C overnight. Clarity Western ECL blotting substrate (Bio-Rad) and ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad) were used for chemiluminescence development and detection.\n\nIn-Gel Digestion\n\nGel slices were cut into small pieces and washed with 600 µL of water on a tilt-table for 10 minutes followed by 20 min wash with 600 µL 50% acetonitrile (ACN)/100 mM NH4HCO3 (ammonium bicarbonate, ABC). The samples were reduced by the addition of 100 µL 4.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 100 mM ABC with incubation at 37ºC for 20 min. The DTT solution was removed and the samples were cooled to room temperature. The samples were alkylated by the addition of 100µL 10mM iodoacetamide (IAN) in 100 mM ABC with incubation at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. The IAN solution was removed, and the gels were washed for 20 min with 600 µL 50% ACN/100 mM ABC, then washed for 20 min with 600 µL 50% ACN/25 mM ABC. The gels were briefly dried by SpeedVac, then resuspended in 100 µL of 25mM ABC containing 500 ng of digestion grade trypsin (Promega, V5111), and incubated at 37ºC for 16 hours. The supernatants containing the tryptic peptides were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes. Residual peptides in the gel bands were extracted with 250 µL 80% ACN/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 15 min, then combined with the original digests and dried in a SpeedVac. Peptides were dissolved in 24 µL MS loading buffer (2% acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid), with 5 µL injected for LC-MS/MS analysis.\n\nLC-MS/MS on the Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Plus\n\nLC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Plus equipped with a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system utilizing a binary solvent system (A: 100% water, 0.1% formic acid; B: 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). Trapping was performed at 5 µL/min, 99.5% Buffer A for 3 min using an ACQUITY UPLC M-Class Symmetry C18 Trap Column (100Å, 5 µm, 180µm x 20 mm, 2G, V/M; Waters, #186007496). Peptides were separated at 37 °C using an ACQUITY UPLC M-Class Peptide BEH C18 Column (130Å, 1.7 µm, 75 µm X 250 mm; Waters, #186007484) and eluted at 300 nL/min with the following gradient: 3% buffer B at initial conditions; 5% B at 2 min; 25% B at 140 min; 40% B at 165 min; 90% B at 170 min; 90% B at 180 min; return to initial conditions at 182 min. MS was acquired in profile mode over the 300-1,700 m/z range using 1 microscan, 70,000 resolution, AGC target of 3E6, and a maximum injection time of 45 ms. Data dependent MS/MS were acquired in centroid mode on the top 20 precursors per MS scan using 1 microscan, 17,500 resolution, AGC target of 1E5, maximum injection time of 100 ms, and an isolation window of 1.7 m/z. Precursors were fragmented by HCD activation with a collision energy of 28%. MS/MS were collected on species with an intensity threshold of 1E4, charge states 2-6, and peptide match preferred. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 seconds.\n\nPeptide Identification\n\nData was analyzed using Proteome Discoverer software v2.2 (Thermo Scientific). Data searching was performed using the Mascot algorithm (version 2.6.1) (Matrix Science) against the SwissProtien database with taxonomy restricted to human (20,368 sequences) or mouse (17,034 sequences) as well as a streptavidin sequence. The search parameters included tryptic digestion with up to 2 missed cleavages, 10 ppm precursor mass tolerance and 0.02 Da fragment mass tolerance, and variable (dynamic) modifications of methionine oxidation and carbamidomethyl cysteine. Normal and decoy database searches were run, with the confidence level set to 95% (p<0.05). Scaffold v5.1.2 (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability and contained at least 2 identified peptides (one uniquely assignable to the protein). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into clusters. Label-free quantification was performed with Scaffold software. Spectral intensity values were used for protein quantification between groups.\n\nProteomic data analysis\n\nTo obtain the PAAS proteome, differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by comparing proteomic hits obtained from PLD3-labeled samples versus those from control samples using no antibody. This allowed filtering of endogenously biotinylated proteins and non-specific binders to streptavidin beads. To obtain the optimal cutoff values for the statistical analysis we tested different degrees of stringency for FDR (0.1, 0.05 and 0.01) and fold change (1 and 1.5). An optimum cutoff p < 0.05, FDR < 0.1 and fold change > 1 was used for these datasets, as it captures the maximum numbers of known PAAS proteins while excluding the maximum numbers of potential contaminants. A pseudo-spectra count of 0.1 was added to all spectra values before calculating the fold changes between experimental samples and controls [76]. Post-cutoff proteomic lists were scrutinized for possible glial contaminations by cross validations using single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) transcriptomics in mice and humans [77] and Tissue Atlas in The Human Protein Atlas [78]. When a gene had an FPKM < 10 in neurons and an FPKM > 10 in other cell types in the scRNAseq datasets [77], and protein expression was not detected in neurons from the Tissue Atlas [78], this gene was excluded from the proteomic results.[78]. One such gene (TNS3) was excluded from the PAAS proteome in AD humans, and five such genes (Gsn, Ephx2, Gfap, Myh9 and Anxa2) were excluded from the PAAS proteome in AD mice. Proteomic hits that passed these thresholds were considered the final PAAS proteomes in AD humans or mice. For principal component analysis (Figures S2C-D), raw proteome data from PLD3-labeled and no antibody control samples were imported into Qlucore Omics Explorer v3.6 (Qlucore AB, Lund, Sweden). Two group comparison between PLD3 labeled and no antibody control samples was performed. A cutoff of p < 0.05 and FDR < 0.1 was applied before principal component analysis. Full lists of raw proteomic hits and filtered PAAS proteomes of AD humans and mice can be found in Table S3.\n\nFor gene ontology analysis (Figures 2F-G, S2E-F), we uploaded the final proteomes to the ToppGene Suite search portal [79] and plotted the top five or top twenty retrieved terms on cellular compartment or biological process with the lowest false discovery rates. For the protein-protein interaction network (Figures 3A-C and S3-1A-B), final proteomes were uploaded into STRING v11.0 search portal [80] to construct protein-protein interaction networks using a medium confidence interaction score 0.4 and plotted in Cytoscape (v3.8.0) [81]. Network clustering was performed using the MCODE [82] plugin in Cytoscape, and the top 8 protein clusters in AD humans were shown in Figures 3A-B; top 9 protein clusters in 5XFAD mice were shown in Figures S3-1A-B. Full lists of protein-protein-interactions and sub-clusters of PAAS proteomes of AD humans and mice can be found in Table S3. Web-based Gene Set Analysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) [83] was used to determine KEGG pathways and gene ontology cellular component for individual protein clusters for AD humans. The top AD related KEGG pathway with the lowest false discovery rate was annotated in Figures 3A-B for protein clusters 1-6 and 8, namely endocytosis, synapse, phagosome 1, proteasome, phagosome 2, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and glutamatergic synapse. Protein cluster 7 was annotated using the top gene ontology cellular component (ATPase complex), given that no AD related KEGG pathway was observed. Similarly, the top gene ontology molecular function terms were annotated for each protein cluster from 5XFAD mice (Figures S3-1A-B). For IPA pathway analysis (Figures 3D and S3-1C-H), human PAAS proteome was imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (QIAGEN, 2020 released version)[84] for canonical pathway analysis. The top two IPA pathways (phagosome maturation and synaptogenesis) with the lowest false discovery rates and another five significant IPA pathways with potential relevance to PAAS pathology listed are Figures 3D (See also S3-1C-H and Table S3). Similarly, IPA pathway analysis was performed for PAAS proteome of 5XFAD mice (Figures S3-1C and Table S3). Full lists of IPA pathway analysis of PAAS proteomes in AD humans and mice can be found in Table S3. For gene set enrichment analysis (Figure S3-1I-J), PAAS proteome of AD human were uploaded into the Broad Institute GSEA software 4.1.0 [85] to perform KEGG and Reactome analysis using default values. P values, FDR values and normalized enrichment scores were used for ranking.\n\nImmunofluorescence of fixed specimens and human iPSC-derived co-culture\n\nFor immunofluorescence of fixed specimens of humans and mice, the complete list of antibodies, dilution factors and immunofluorescence instructions can be found in Table S2. Briefly, for mice and human brains, fixation and vibratome sectioning was the same as described in the proximity labeling section. Heat-induced sodium citrate antigen retrieval was performed when necessary (see IF instructions in Table S2). Immunofluorescence staining was then performed with the following protocol: tissue was boiled in 50 mM sodium citrate with 0.05% tween-20 at 95 °C for 45 min, followed by 30 min cool down at RT and rinse with PBS for three times. Primary antibodies incubation were 12 hours to 3 days at 4 °C in blocking buffer (PBS with 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20) and secondary antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. Thioflavin S (Sigma-Aldrich, T1892, 2% w/v stock solution, 1:10k staining) was used for labeling amyloid deposits. Three times washes with PBST were performed before mounting tissues on slides with PermaFluor (Thermo Scientific, TA-030-FM).\n\nFor immunofluorescence of human iPSC-derived neuron-astrocyte co-culture, cells were washed 3 times with pre-warmed PBS before fixing with 4% PFA (ice-cold) at RT for 20 min. Cells were washed with PBS 15 min x 3 and were blocked with blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS, plus 0.1% tween-20) for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with cells at 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed with PBST 15 min x 3. Secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with cells at 4 °C overnight. ThioflavinS (2% w/v stock solution, 1:10k staining) was diluted in PBS and incubated with cells at RT for 5 min. Cells were washed with PBST 15 min x 3, before imaging.\n\nConfocal microscopy\n\nA Leica SP8 confocal microscope was used to generate all images. Laser and detector (the GaAsP hybrid detection system, photon counting mode) settings were maintained constant. For all analyses, single z stack images or tiled images were obtained in somatosensory cortex in mice. All images were obtained using a 63x oil immersion objective (N.A. 1.40), 40x water immersion objective (N.A. 1.10) or 25x water immersion objective (N.A. 0.95) at 1,024 × 1,024 pixel resolution, z-step size of 1 μm, as we previously described [63]. When indicated, deconvolution was performed using the default setting in the Leica SP8 LAS X software.\n\nLentivirus plasmid purification, lentivirus production and concentration\n\nEscherichia coli stocks for pMDLg/pRRE (MDL), pRSV-Rev (Rev), pCMV-VSV-G (VSVG), FUW-M2rtTA and pLV-TetO-hNGN2-eGFP-Puro were purchased from Addgene (12251, 12253, 8454, 20342 and 79823, respectively). Bacteria was grown in 500 mL of LB Broth (Fisher Scientific, DF0446-07-5) with 100 µg/mL Ampicillin (Sigma, A9518) overnight at 37 °C and 200 rpm. In the following day, bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and plasmids purified using the PureLink™ HiPure Plasmid Filter Maxiprep Kit (Invitrogen, K210017), following manufacturer instructions.\n\nThird generation lentiviral vectors were produced as we described [86]. Briefly, HEK 293T cells (Invitrogen, R700-07) were grown in 15-cm plates (Falcon, 353025) in DMEM (Gibco, 12430054) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, 10438026) until reaching 70-80% confluency. For cell transfection, the following solution was prepared in 500 µL of pre-warmed Opti-MEM (Gibco, 31985062) per plate: 12.2 µg of transfer plasmid, 8.1 µg of MDL, 3.1 µg of Rev, 4.1 µg of VSVG and 110 µL of Polyethylenimine (1 µg/µL; Polysciences, 23966-2). This solution was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, vortexed gently and added dropwise onto HEK 293T cells for transfection. Medium was changed after 6 h of incubation and harvested at 48 h and 72 h post transfection. Media containing viral particles was sterile-filtered and concentrated using the Lenti-X™ Concentrator (Takara Bio, 631231), according to manufacturer instructions.\n\nHuman neuron-astrocyte co-culture AD model\n\nHuman iPSC control line 3182-3 was used in this experiment, as we first described this line in [74]. Maintenance and passaging of human iPSC was performed as we previously described [87]. Human primary astrocytes (ThermoFisher #N7805200) were maintained as described in user manual. iPSC-derived NGN2-induced glutamatergic neuron generation was performed as we previously described [87]. Briefly, human iPSCs maintained in 6-well-plates were harvested by incubating in Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies AT104) 1 mL/per well plus 10 µM ROCK inhibitor THX (RI)(Tocris #1254) at 37 °C for 20 min. Dissociated iPSCs were then collected in a 50 mL falcon tube and mixed well with DMEM (ThermoFisher #11966025)(preferably 1:3 Accutase : DMEM). iPSCs were centrifuged for 4 min at RT at 1000 g. iPSC were resuspended in 1-2 mL of Stemflex (ThermoFisher) with 10µM RI and counted, diluted in Stemflex with THX to a cell suspension concentration of 1e6 cells/mL. Lentiviruses NGN2-Puro and rtTA (titer 4.40 × 10^10 gc/mL) at 50 uL per 10e6 cells of suspension were added. Cells were mixed and dispensed at 120k cells/per well (6 well size) coated with 1x Geltrex (ThermoFisher). Cells were incubated at 37 °C incubator overnight. DIV1: media was replaced with induction media (DMEM F12 with Glutamax and Sodium Pyruvate (Thermofisher, #10565018), 1% N-2 (Thermofisher, #17502048), 2% B-27-RA (Thermofisher, #12587010), Doxycycline for a final concentration of 1ug/mL). DIV2 and 3: replaced media with induction media contained puroymycin (2 ug/mL) on each day. DIV4: Neurons were dissociated with Accutase plus 10 µM RI for 20 min, washed off with 1:3 DMEM, resuspended and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min. Resuspend pellet at a concentration of 1e6 cells/ml in neuron media (Brainphys (STEMCELL, # 05790), 1% N-2, 2% B-27-RA, 1 μg/mL Natural Mouse Laminin (Thermofisher, # 23017015), 20 ng/mL BDNF (R&D, #248), 20 ng/mL GDNF (R&D, #212), 250 μg/mL Dibutyryl cyclic-AMP (Sigma, #D0627), 200 μM L-ascorbic acid (Sigma, # A4403) and 1x Anti-Anti (ThermoFisher)) with Dox 1μg/mL, puromycin 2 μg/mL, 4 µM AraC (Sigma #C6645) and 10 µM RI. Neurons were replated onto 2x Geltrex coated 96-well-plates (PerkinElmer #6055302) and seeded at 10e5 per well (96-well plate size). DIV5: media was replaced with neuron medium containing puromycin 2 μg/mL and AraC 4 μM. DIV6: media was replaced with neuron medium with 4 μM AraC. DIV8: media was replaced with neuron medium with 2 μM AraC. DIV10: human primary astrocytes were dissociated with TrypLE (ThermoFisher), washed with DMEM, centrifuged at 400 rcf for 5 min, counted and plated into NGN2 neurons culture at 20k cells/per well (96-well-plate size). Human iPSC-derived neuron-astrocyte co-culture was maintained as previously described [44] with modifications. Briefly, human neuron-astrocyte co-culture were maintained in neuron media plus 1.5% FBS for 1 week, then reduced FBS to 0.5% for another week. Media was half-changed every other day. After that, human neuron-astrocyte co-cultures were maintained in neuron maintenance medium (1X BrainPhys Basal (StemCell Technology), 1X B27 with Vitamin A (ThermoFisher), 1X N2 (ThermoFisher), 5 μg/ml Cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Creatine (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 nM β-estradiol, 200 nM Ascorbic Acid, 1 mM cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng/ml BDNF (Peprotech), 20 ng/ml GDNF (Peprotech), 1 μg/ml Laminin, 0.5 mM Glutamax (ThermoFisher), 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Peprotech), 1X Normocin (InvivoGen), 50 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (ThermoFisher)) with half-changed of media every other day until harvest, or other assays. For AD modeling, amyloid beta 1-42 peptide (AnaSpec AS-72216) was oligomerized to prepare soluble amyloid beta species as previously described [44, 60]. Briefly, soluble amyloid beta species were added to the neuron maintenance medium at a final concentration of 5 μM and applied to the human neuron-astrocyte co-culture for 7 days, with half-change of media every other day as previously described [44]. For mTOR signaling inhibition, Torin1 (TOCRIS 4247) or vehicle DMSO was added to the neuron maintenance medium at a final concentration of 250 nM [45], and applied to the human neuron-astrocyte co-culture 3 days before amyloid beta treatment. Then, Torin1 or vehicle DMSO was added to the neuron maintenance medium at 250 nM concentration, along with soluble amyloid beta species at 5 μM concentration, and applied to the human neuron-astrocyte co-culture for 7 days, with half-change of medium every other day.\n\nViral-mediated Mtor heterozygous knockout in Mtor-floxed-5XFAD mice\n\nmTOR is known to be a regulator of cell growth [25, 45], previous studies showed cell size was indistinguishable between the Mtor heterozygous knockout and wild-type cells [88], which suggests that the effects of Mtor knockout on cell size is Mtor gene-copy dose dependent. Thus, we obtained Mtor heterozygous floxed AD mice to achieve conditional Mtor heterozygous knockout, which had no effect on cell body size (Figures 6K and S6E). To achieve global neuronal Mtor heterozygous knockout in Mtor-floxed-5XFAD mice, 10 μL of AAV-PHPeB-hsyn-cre-eGFP (Addgene#105540, titer ∼1×10^13) or AAV-PHPeB-CAG-GFP (Addgene#37825, titer\n\n∼1×10^13) was retro-orbitally injected into 6-week-old Mtor-floxed-5XFAD mice. To achieve sparse neuronal Mtor heterozygous knockout, 1 μL of AAV9-hsyn-cre-2a-tdT (Addgene#107738, titer ∼1×10^13) was diluted with 3 μL of PBS and was injected into the subarachnoid space of one hemisphere at the level of somatosensory cortex in Mtor-floxed-5XFAD mice, as we previously described [63]. Mouse brains were collected 2 months after virus injection in the AAV-PHPeB experiment or at 2.5 months for the AAV9-hsyn-cre-2a-tdT injected mice. Brains were sliced, stained and imaged with confocal microscopy as abovementioned and as we previously described [63].\n\nImage analysis and quantification\n\nAll images were taken using Leica SP8 confocal microscopy, and all analyses were processed with FIJI (ImageJ) software, unless otherwise described. For analysis of PLD3 distribution in PAAS versus neuronal soma or neuronal branches outside axonal spheroids, we performed semi-quantification in postmortem brains of three AD humans, which were used for PAAS proteomics. Immunofluorescence staining of PLD3 and thioflavin S staining was performed followed by confocal imaging. PLD3 background signal was measured in each image and a background value ranging from 25-60 was subtracted to remove the noise from the background. Z stack images were then maximum projected. PAAS halos were manually circled, and raw integrated intensity (RawInt) was measured. RawInt was also measured for the whole images. PLD3 expression from PAAS was measured by sum of RawInt from all the PAAS halos, whereas expression from neuronal soma and other neuronal branches was measured by subtracting RawInt of PAAS from that of the whole image.\n\nFor p-mTOR S2448 fluorescence intensity measurement in human AD or no/mild AD postmortem brains, each zoom 1 z-stack image, containing SMI312 positive axonal spheroids around amyloid plaques, were maximum projected. Then, SMI312 positive spheroid halos were circled, and mean fluorescence intensity of the p-mTOR S2448 channel was measured within the selected circle. In the same field of view, regions without spheroids were considered as background. Three such background regions were selected, circled and p-mTOR mean intensity was measured. The three “background” p-mTOR mean intensity from each field of view was averaged. Mean intensity (p-mTOR dystrophy halo) / mean intensity (p-mTOR background) was calculated to represent the p-mTOR expression level in each axonal spheroid halo. Three fields of view were quantified in each severe AD patient, and 1-3 fields of view were quantified in each no/mild AD patient. The averaged p-mTOR expression level in each patient was used for statistics analysis.\n\nTo measure size of individual axon spheroids in human iPSC-derived neurons in the Torin1 treatment experiment, SMI312 was used to label spheroids, while ThioflavinS was used to label amyloid plaques. Tiling images were taken in each well from a 96-well-plate and were maximum projected. Individual axonal spheroids were circled using freehand tool on ImageJ, and the circle area was measured. The total number of axonal spheroid halos analyzed ranged from 50-150 within each tilling image. Two technical replicate wells were analyzed in each experiment and three batches of experiments were performed for quantification.\n\nTo measure p-mTOR S2448 mean fluorescence intensity in individual spheroids of human neurons in the Torin1 treatment experiment, confocal images were taken for each spheroid halo (SMI312 labeled) around an amyloid plaque (ThioflavinS labeled). Individual axonal spheroids were circled using freehand tool on ImageJ, at optical sections with the maximum diameter, and mean intensity in the p-mTOR channel was measured. Similarly, axon spheroid percentage and axonal density were measured after z-stacks were maximum projected. Five spheroid halos were selected randomly in each well. Two technical replicate wells were analyzed in each experiment and three batches of experiments were done for quantification. To measure human neuron cell body size with or without Torin1 treatment, iPSC co-cultures were infected by AAV2-CB7-GFP (Addgene#105542) at titer ∼7×10^9 vg/mL one week before Torin1 and amyloid beta treatment. Cells were stained with NeuN and GFP antibodies. Large field tilling imaging was performed in each well. Tilling images were maximum projected and neurons with both NeuN and GFP positive signals were measured by size, using freehand tool in ImageJ. Three technical replicate wells were analyzed in each experiment and two batches of experiments were done for quantification.\n\nFor individual axonal spheroid size measurement in the AAV9-hSyn-cre-2a-tdT infected Mtor-flox-5XFAD mice, anti-Lamp1 antibody was used for immunofluorescence staining to showcase the spheroid halo around amyloid plaques, ThioflavinS was used to label amyloid plaques, and anti-RFP antibody was used to reveal the tdTomato expression in infected neurons. Tilling images were taken at the somatosensory cortex of each animal. Three serial brain sections were used for tilling imaging for each mouse. An individual spheroid was counted when it was both tdTomato and Lamp1 positive. Individual spheroid size was measured using the freehand tool in ImageJ to circle the outline of spheroids, where it had the maximum diameter, followed by measurement of the circled area. The total number of axonal spheroid halo sanalyzed ranged from 50-150 in each tilling image.\n\nFor measuring spheroid halo size in the AAV-PHPeB infected Mtor-flox-5XFAD experiment, anti-Lamp1 antibody was used for immunofluorescence staining to showcase the spheroid halo around amyloid plaque, ThioflavinS was used to label amyloid plaques. Tilling images were taken at the somatosensory cortex of each animal. Three serial brain sections were used for tilling imaging for each mouse. A customized ImageJ macro was used to segment individual Lamp1 positive spheroid halos and amyloid plaques (Figure S6D). Using a customized MATLAB program, the segmented images were processed to measure the area of individual spheroid halos and amyloid plaque area, automatically. The spheroid halo area was excluding the area in the center occupied by the amyloid plaque. The number of axonal spheroid halos and amyloid plaques analyzed ranged from 30 to 70 in each tilling image from the Mtor-flox-5XFAD experiment.\n\nA customized CellProfiler program was used to automatically measure NeuN positive neuronal cell soma area of AAV-PHPeB infected Mtor-flox-5XFAD mice. Briefly, tilling images were taken from one hemisphere of somatosensory cortex. Tilling images were maximum projected before importing into CellProfiler (Broad Institute). The NeuN channel was set as primary object, and was used as the marker for size measurement. Three tilling images were taken from three brain sections of each animal. Three animals were used in each group."
