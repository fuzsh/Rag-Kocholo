        "text": "Microglia exert a crucial role in the homeostasis of white matter integrity, and emerging evidence suggests that microglial dysfunction plays a significant role in leukodystrophy and neurodegeneration [1‒4]. Primary microgliopathies refer to adult leukodystrophies linked to mutations in genes expressed in microglial cells and include adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD), and leukodystrophies related to variants in the negative regulator of reactive oxygen species or pseudo-TORCH syndrome [5‒11]. These are considered as type-I microgliopathies [7].\n\nMicroglia are associated with a set of pattern recognition receptors at the cell surface [12, 13]. Mutations in these microbial sensome genes also lead to primary microgliopathies by promoting neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and fronotemporal dementia (FTD) in type-II microgliopathies [7, 14]. Details are shown as flow chart in Figure 1.\n\nMutations in microglial colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM2), and TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein (TYROBP) genes can cause leukodystrophy and FTD-like clinical syndromes, whereas mutations due to TREM2 can be a risk factor for FTD, FTD-like syndromes, and Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) [7, 15]. The clinical phenotypes of primary microgliopathy are myriad, ranging from neuropsychiatric syndrome, motor disability, gait dysfunction, ataxia, pure dementia, FTD, AD, and so on [9‒11, 15, 16].\n\nNHD (or polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy [PLOSL]) and adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with ALSP exemplify how intrinsic microglial dysfunction could cause neurological or psychiatric diseases [5, 6]. NHD is caused by the mutations of genes TYROBP or TREM2 (PLOSL1 and PLOSL2, respectively). The characteristic symptoms include multiple bone cysts and fractures, and frontal lobe dementia [5‒8].\n\nSeveral cases of early-onset FTD-like syndromes involving white matter loss but lacking overt bone phenotypes have also been associated with homozygous variants as well as rare heterozygous variants in TREM2 although the mechanism remains unclear [14, 17]. Single-nucleotide variations in TREM2 have been linked to both late-onset Alzheimer’s disease and behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), pure dementia without bony changes, and NHD [18]. In AD, TREM2 is a risk factor that is highly associated with disease progression in amyloid-β pathology [19].\n\nALSP is caused by CSF1R mutations and is characterized by several neuropsychiatric symptoms such as cognitive decline, anxiety, depression, irritability, and behavioural FTD-like symptoms and AD. The motor symptoms include Parkinsonian symptoms, pyramidal, bulbar signs, and ataxia and are often misdiagnosed [20‒22].\n\nIn this report, we describe a case series of patients clinically presenting with dementia confirmed on whole-exome sequencing (WES) to have genetic defects linked to primary microgliopathy. The range of clinical, cognitive profiles, radiological patterns, and underlying novel genetic mutations linked to primary microgliopathy is reported for the first time in the Indian context.\n\nA 45-year-old female patient presented with cognitive decline, personality change, and behavioural disturbances in the form of apathy, disinhibition, overfamiliarity, a bizarre eating pattern, hyper-orality, and preference to sweets for 5 years. She had reduced attention and recent memory disturbances. She exhibited poor personal hygiene, frequent wandering, inattentiveness, loss of empathy, and problems with planning and judgement. There was a gradual decline in speech output and verbal perseverations. Subsequently, she developed navigational difficulty and difficulty in dressing and in recognizing currency. Her cognition gradually worsened and over the next 3 years, she became incontinent. There were no delusions, hallucinations, pathological bone fractures, bone pain, or swelling of ankles or wrist. There was a history of similar behavioural disturbances in the elder sister who had a premature death as shown in Figure 2.\n\nOn neurological examination, the patient had disorientation and inattentiveness. She had non-fluent aphasia and frontal release signs, along with utilization behaviour and environmental dependency. The ACE-R score was three, and the CDR score was three. Investigations for young onset dementia were negative.\n\nA clinical diagnosis of bvFTD (behavioural variant) was considered. Her brain imaging showed symmetrical atrophy of frontal, temporal lobes, and superior parietal lobules with relative preservation of occipital lobe and inferior parietal lobe. T2/FLAIR hypointensity was observed in the bilateral putamen, globus pallidus, and subcortical FLAIR intensities in the frontal lobe along with a striking thinning of the corpus callosum as shown in Figure 2. WES revealed a pathogenic splice donor variant NM_018965.4:c.40 + 1G>A in TREM2 gene (NC_000006.12:g.41163042C>T; rs766712618) in the homozygous state in the proband. The c.40 + 1G>A variant is novel (not in any individuals) in 1kG All. The c.40 + 1G>A variant is observed in 3/30,780 (0.0097%) alleles from individuals of a gnomAD South Asian background in gnomAD in only a heterozygous state and 2 other individuals with a similar phenotype in the homozygous state in our in-house database. This variant mutates a splice donor sequence, potentially resulting in the retention of large segments of intronic DNA by the mRNA and nonfunctional proteins. This variant results in the loss of a donor splice site for the clinically relevant transcript. This variant disrupts the donor splice site for an exon upstream from the penultimate exon junction and is therefore predicted to cause nonsense-mediated decay. The c.40 + 1G>A variant is a loss-of-function variant in the gene TREM2, which is intolerant of loss-of-function variants, as indicated by the presence of existing pathogenic loss-of-function variant NP_061838.1:p.E14* and 4 others. In addition, the phenotype of the proband matches with that of the disorder caused by pathogenic variants in TREM2 gene. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic (PM2 PVS1 PP4_Moderate PS4_Moderate) (submission ID to ClinVar: SUB13901156). This variant was validated on Sanger sequencing as shown in Figure 2. On a telephonic follow-up, the patient’s family reported that she had expired 1.5 years after diagnosis.\n\nThe clinical and genetic spectrum of white matter diseases due to primary microgliopathies is expanding. In this clinical case series of degenerative dementias linked to mutation in genes expressed in microglial cells, we have highlighted the spectrum of phenotypes associated with primary microgliopathies.\n\nOur study highlights 5 cases of dementia with 4 patients presenting as FTD and one with features of atypical Alzheimer’s disease from a large Indian cohort of cognitive disorder registry of subjects with dementia who subsequently had evidence of primary microgliopathy and white matter disease, as evidenced by WES and clinical imaging. All three pathogenic variants of TREM2, TYROBP, and CSF1R reported are novel, and TREM2 (without osseous changes) and TYROBP in dementia are described for the first time from a single centre in the Indian subcontinent. There are a few case reports of CSF1R reported in the literature from India, but there is no published literature where CSF1R is associated with an atypical AD phenotype so far [28‒32].\n\nTREM2 is an immune receptor found on myeloid lineage cells, forms a receptor-signalling complex with protein tyrosine kinase binding protein, and causes phagocytosis. Heterozygous variants including R47H and R62H are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease, whereas homozygous loss of function was found in families with the rare recessive NHD [33‒35]. There are also reports of behavioural variant and language variants of FTD associated with TREM2 mutation [36]. Rare variants like p.R47H, T66M, T96K, p. T96K, p. L211P, Q33X, and S116C mutations represent candidates for FTD risk [18, 36‒41].\n\nNHD is characterized by early-onset progressive dementia, bone cysts, and pathological bone fractures [5, 6, 11]. Our case 1 illustrates an interesting presentation of TREM2 as FTD without osseous changes. To date, biallelic TREM2 mutations have only been described in ten families diagnosed with FTD without the PLOSL bone phenotypes from Turkey, Lebanon, Columbia, Malaysia, and Singapore [42‒46]. The case we report is the first case of TREM2 homozygous mutation masquerading as behavioural variant FTD (without bony changes) from India and South Asia, the second case of homozygous mutation of TREM2 from India and emphasizes that genetic screening should be performed in FTD with atypical phenotypes, characterized by early onset, early parietal and hippocampal deficits, the presence of seizures and parkinsonism, extensive white matter lesions, and corpus callosum thinning [46, 47].\n\nThe novel homozygous c.40 + 1G>A variant TREM2 in our cohort presented with early-onset bvFTD, white matter signal changes, and thin corpus callosum. The navigational difficulties and parietal atrophy are well described in the patient with TREM2 mutation, and the associated clinical-genetic features provide insight into the pathogenic role of TREM2 in neurodegenerative disorders and its varied phenotypes. The c.377T>G mutation (TREM2 gene of exon 2) in the homozygous state presenting as bvFTD and bony cysts has been previously reported as the second case of Nasu-Hakola from India [47].\n\nTYROBP (also known as DAP12) is a transmembrane signalling protein [48, 49]. Recessive mutations in TYROBP have been described as causative of NHD [50, 51]. TYROBP also regulates macrophage proliferation through CSF1R and can further explain the phenotypes observed in both NHD and ALSP [52]. TYROBP may also be involved in Aβ turnover and the differentiation and function of osteoclasts. In NHD, no changes in amyloid plaques have been observed with loss-of-function mutation of TYROBP [53].\n\nCases of NHD without apparent skeletal symptoms occur in TREM2 mutations, but not in TYROBP [8]. The initial cases of TYROBP due to the deletion or nonfunctional mutations have been reported mainly from Japan, Finland, United Kingdom, etc. [54, 55]. In an earlier case report on the first case of NHD from India, the homozygous nonsense variation in exon 2 of the TYROBP gene (PGln28Ter) was detected in a younger brother of a patient with NHD [56].\n\nOur case 2 with TYROBP with FTD phenotype had significant extrapyramidal features, spasticity, severe dysphagia, and mutism which have not been so far reported commonly in TYROBP. The patient had NM_003332.4 (TYROBP):C.82C>T (p. Q28*), a stop gained variant in the homozygous state in exon 2 of 5. The p. Gln28Ter variant is novel in 1kG All, gnomAD and in the in-house database. Hence, case 2 in our cohort represents the first confirmed Pathogenic variant of TYROBP presenting as NHD, FTD and bony cysts from India.\n\nThis reported case series of 3 patients of CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy or ALSP highlights the variability in the phenotypic presentation of CSF1R mutation: cases 3 and 5 presented with FTD and case 4 presented as atypical AD. Although a few Indian reports of dementia patients with CSF1R mutation are published, the genetic novelty in case 3 was pathogenic intronic 14 mutation and the clinical novelty was that aphasia was prominent in the course of illness [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 57, 58, 59, 60]. Aphasia is described only in 19% of the series in literature [27, 57].\n\nPresently, a total of 115 CSF1R mutation sites have been identified worldwide in approximately 300 cases reported [57, 58, 59, 60] and only 13 intronic pathogenic variants have been reported in the literature. Although several variants of CSF1R are implicated as a risk for AD, phenotypically atypical variant AD confirmed by the PET MR hypoperfusion pattern in case 4 is a rarity [16].\n\nBrain parenchymal calcifications mainly in the frontal and periventricular areas in CT (75%), T2, and FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the periventricular, deep, and subcortical bifrontal or bifrontoparietal white matter with central atrophy in MRI are the classical findings [57, 61]. In addition, thinning of the corpus callosum and diffusion-restricted lesions in the white matter are hallmarks, as was demonstrated in cases 3 and 5. The functional trio of CSF1R, TREM2, and TYROBP plays a crucial role in microglial population dynamics, viability and survival [62]. The prospect of targeting microglia for the treatment of neuro-psychiatric disorders and degenerative dementias is intriguing [1].\n\nTransient microglial depletion by clodronate liposomes or CSF1R inhibitors has been shown to reduce disease progression in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease [10]. Several studies have shown the microglia-mediated regulation of plaque deposition and/or p-tau propagation by the CSF1R inhibitor [63].\n\nWith recent advances in the role of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HPSCT) in microgliopathy and the narrow therapeutic window due to rapid progression, early diagnosis of these primary microgliopathies becomes very crucial. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in microglial leukoencephalopathies has been used in a few clinical trials. The beneficial effects of immunosuppressive therapy have also been reported [63, 64, 65, 66, 67]."
