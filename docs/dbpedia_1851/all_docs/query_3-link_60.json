Please direct any questions regarding coding to the payer being billed.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Blueprint Genetics Comprehensive Epilepsy Panel (test code NE1001):\n\nRead about our accreditations, certifications and CE-marked IVD medical devices here.\n\nICD Codes\n\nRefer to the most current version of ICD-10-CM manual for a complete list of ICD-10 codes.\n\nSample Requirements\n\nBlood (min. 1ml) in an EDTA tube\n\nExtracted DNA, min. 2 μg in TE buffer or equivalent\n\nSaliva (Please see Sample Requirements for accepted saliva kits)\n\nLabel the sample tube with your patient’s name, date of birth and the date of sample collection.\n\nWe do not accept DNA samples isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. In addition, if the patient is affected with a hematological malignancy, DNA extracted from a non-hematological source (e.g. skin fibroblasts) is strongly recommended.\n\nPlease note that, in rare cases, mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) variants may not be detectable in blood or saliva in which case DNA extracted from post-mitotic tissue such as skeletal muscle may be a better option.\n\nRead more about our sample requirements here.\n\nEpilepsy is defined by recurrent, unprovoked seizures due to abnormal, synchronized neuronal firing in the brain. It is one of the most common neurological conditions. Approximately 20-30 % of epilepsy cases are caused by acquired conditions, but the remaining 70-80 % of cases are believed to be due to one or more genetic factors. The epilepsies can be broadly grouped into three classes: genetic generalized epilepsy (formerly idiopathic generalized epilepsy); focal epilepsy; and epileptic encephalopathy. There are then several specific syndromes within each class defined by differences in specific seizure types, electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and age of onset and disease progression. Epilepsy is also one of the features of many multisystemic genetic syndromes and often occurs in neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nGenes in the Comprehensive Epilepsy Panel and their clinical

test include:\n\nCAP accredited laboratory\n\nCLIA-certified personnel performing clinical testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory\n\nPowerful sequencing technologies, advanced target enrichment methods and precision bioinformatics pipelines ensure superior analytical performance\n\nCareful construction of clinically effective and scientifically justified gene panels\n\nSome of the panels include the whole mitochondrial genome (please see the Panel Content section)\n\nOur Nucleus online portal providing transparent and easy access to quality and performance data at the patient level\n\n~2,000 non-coding disease causing variants in our clinical grade NGS assay for panels (please see ‘Non-coding disease causing variants covered by this panel’ in the Panel Content section)\n\nOur rigorous variant classification scheme\n\nOur systematic clinical interpretation workflow using proprietary software enabling accurate and traceable processing of NGS data\n\nOur comprehensive clinical statements\n\nTest Limitations\n\nThis panel does not detect the expansion of a 12-nucleotide repeat (rs193922905) in the promoter region of *CSTB*. The following exons are not included in the panel as they are not sufficiently covered with high quality sequence reads: *AP4S1* (NM_001254727:6), *ARV1* (NM_001346992.2:4), *DEGS1* (NM_001321541:3), *DHPS* (NM_001206974:1), *GABRG2* (NM_198903:6), *OCLN* (NM_002538:5,7,8), *SLC39A8* (NM_001135148:1), *TK2* (NM_001271934:3), *TSFM* (NM_001172696:5), *ZNHIT3* (NM_001281432:5). Genes with suboptimal coverage in our assay are marked with number sign (#) and genes with partial, or whole gene, segmental duplications in the human genome are marked with an asterisk (*) if they overlap with the UCSC pseudogene regions. Gene is considered to have suboptimal coverage when >90% of the gene’s target nucleotides are not covered at >20x with mapping quality score (MQ>20) reads. The technology may have limited sensitivity to detect variants in genes marked with these symbols (please see the Panel content table above).\n\nThe genes on the panel have been carefully selected based on scientific literature, mutation databases and our experience.\n\nOur panels are sectioned from our high-quality, clinical grade NGS assay. Please see our sequencing and detection performance table for details regarding our ability to detect different types of alterations (Table).\n\nAssays have been validated for various sample types including EDTA-blood, isolated DNA (excluding from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue), saliva and dry blood spots (filter cards). These sample types were selected in order to maximize the likelihood for high-quality DNA yield. The diagnostic yield varies depending on the assay used, referring healthcare professional, hospital and country. Plus analysis increases the likelihood of finding a genetic diagnosis for your patient, as large deletions and duplications cannot be detected using sequence analysis alone. Blueprint Genetics’ Plus Analysis is a combination of both sequencing and deletion/duplication (copy number variant (CNV)) analysis.\n\nThe performance metrics listed below are from an initial validation performed at our main laboratory in Finland. The performance metrics of our laboratory in Marlborough, MA, are equivalent.\n\nPerformance of Blueprint Genetics high-quality, clinical grade NGS sequencing assay for panels.\n\nSensitivity % (TP/(TP+FN) Specificity % Single nucleotide variants 99.89% (99,153/99,266) >99.9999% Insertions, deletions and indels by sequence analysis 1-10 bps 99.2% (7,745/7,806) >99.9999% 11-50 bps 99.13% (2,524/2,546) >99.9999% Copy number variants (exon level dels/dups) 1 exon level deletion (heterozygous) 100% (20/20) NA 1 exon level deletion (homozygous) 100% (5/5) NA 1 exon level deletion (het or homo) 100% (25/25) NA 2-7 exon level deletion (het or homo) 100% (44/44) NA 1-9 exon level duplication (het or homo) 75% (6/8) NA Simulated CNV detection 5 exons level deletion/duplication 98.7% 100.00% Microdeletion/-duplication sdrs (large CNVs, n=37)) Size range (0.1-47 Mb) 100% (25/25) The performance presented above reached by Blueprint Genetics high-quality, clinical grade NGS sequencing assay with the following coverage metrics Mean sequencing depth 143X Nucleotides with >20x sequencing coverage (%) 99.86%\n\nPerformance of Blueprint Genetics Mitochondrial Sequencing Assay.\n\nSensitivity % Specificity % ANALYTIC VALIDATION (NA samples; n=4) Single nucleotide variants Heteroplasmic (45-100%) 100.0% (50/50) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (35-45%) 100.0% (87/87) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (25-35%) 100.0% (73/73) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (15-25%) 100.0% (77/77) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (10-15%) 100.0% (74/74) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (5-10%) 100.0% (3/3) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (<5%) 50.0% (2/4) 100.0% CLINICAL VALIDATION (n=76 samples) All types Single nucleotide variants n=2026 SNVs Heteroplasmic (45-100%) 100.0% (1940/1940) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (35-45%) 100.0% (4/4) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (25-35%) 100.0% (3/3) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (15-25%) 100.0% (3/3) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (10-15%) 100.0% (9/9) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (5-10%) 92.3% (12/13) 99.98% Heteroplasmic (<5%) 88.9% (48/54) 99.93% Insertions and deletions by sequence analysis n=40 indels Heteroplasmic (45-100%) 1-10bp 100.0% (32/32) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (5-45%) 1-10bp 100.0% (3/3) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (<5%) 1-10bp 100.0% (5/5) 99,997% SIMULATION DATA /(mitomap mutations) Insertions, and deletions 1-24 bps by sequence analysis; n=17 Homoplasmic (100%) 1-24bp 100.0% (17/17) 99.98% Heteroplasmic (50%) 100.0% (17/17) 99.99% Heteroplasmic (25%) 100.0% (17/17) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (20%) 100.0% (17/17) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (15%) 100.0% (17/17) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (10%) 94.1% (16/17) 100.0% Heteroplasmic (5%) 94.1% (16/17) 100.0% Copy number variants (separate artifical mutations; n=1500) Homoplasmic (100%) 500 bp, 1kb, 5 kb 100.0% 100.0% Heteroplasmic (50%) 500 bp, 1kb, 5 kb 100.0% 100.0% Heteroplasmic (30%) 500 bp, 1kb, 5 kb 100.0% 100.0% Heteroplasmic (20%) 500 bp, 1kb, 5 kb 99.7% 100.0% Heteroplasmic (10%) 500 bp, 1kb, 5 kb 99.0% 100.0% The performance presented above reached by following coverage metrics at assay level (n=66) Mean of medians Median of medians Mean sequencing depth MQ0 (clinical) 18224X 17366X Nucleotides with >1000x MQ0 sequencing coverage (%) (clinical) 100% rho zero cell line (=no mtDNA), mean sequencing depth 12X\n\nThe target region for each gene includes coding exons and ±20 base pairs from the exon-intron boundary. In addition, the panel includes non-coding and regulatory variants if listed above (Non-coding variants covered by the panel). Some regions of the gene(s) may be removed from the panel if specifically mentioned in the ‘Test limitations” section above. If the test includes the mitochondrial genome the target region gene list contains the mitochondrial genes. The sequencing data generated in our laboratory is analyzed with our proprietary data analysis and annotation pipeline, integrating state-of-the art algorithms and industry-standard software solutions. Incorporation of rigorous quality control steps throughout the workflow of the pipeline ensures the consistency, validity and accuracy of results. Our pipeline is streamlined to maximize sensitivity without sacrificing specificity. We have incorporated a number of reference population databases and mutation databases including, but not limited, to 1000 Genomes Project, gnomAD, ClinVar and HGMD into our clinical interpretation software to make the process effective and efficient. For missense variants, in silico variant prediction tools such as SIFT, PolyPhen,MutationTaster are used to assist with variant classification. Through our online ordering and statement reporting system, Nucleus, ordering providers have access to the details of the analysis, including patient specific sequencing metrics, a gene level coverage plot and a list of regions with suboptimal coverage (<20X for nuclear genes and <1000X for mtDNA) if applicable. This reflects our mission to build fully transparent diagnostics where ordering providers can easily visualize the crucial details of the analysis process.\n\nWe provide customers with the most comprehensive clinical report available on the market. Clinical interpretation requires a fundamental understanding of clinical genetics and genetic principles. At Blueprint Genetics, our PhD molecular geneticists, medical geneticists, and clinical consultants prepare the clinical statement together by evaluating the identified variants in the context of the phenotypic information provided in the requisition form. Our goal is to provide clinically meaningful statements that are understandable for all medical professionals regardless of whether they have formal training in genetics.\n\nVariant classification is the cornerstone of clinical interpretation and resulting patient management decisions. Our classifications follow the ACMG guideline 2015.\n\nThe final step in the analysis is orthogonal confirmation. Sequence and copy number variants classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are confirmed using bi-directional Sanger sequencing or by orthogonal methods such as qPCR/ddPCR when they do not meet our stringent NGS quality metrics for a true positive call.\n\nOur clinical statement includes tables for sequencing and copy number variants that include basic variant information (genomic coordinates, HGVS nomenclature, zygosity, allele frequencies, in silico predictions, OMIM phenotypes, and classification of the variant). In addition, the statement includes detailed descriptions of the variant, gene, and phenotype(s) including the role of the specific gene in human disease, the mutation profile, information about the gene’s variation in population cohorts, and detailed information about related phenotypes. We also provide links to the references, abstracts, and variant databases used to help ordering providers further evaluate the reported findings if desired. The conclusion summarizes all of the existing information and provides our rationale for the classification of the variant.\n\nIdentification of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in dominant disorders or their combinations in different alleles in recessive disorders are considered molecular confirmation of the clinical diagnosis. In these cases, family member testing can be used for risk stratification. We do not recommend using variants of uncertain significance (VUS) for family member risk stratification or patient management. Genetic counseling is recommended.\n\nOur interpretation team analyzes millions of variants from thousands of individuals with rare diseases. Our internal database and our understanding of variants and related phenotypes increases with every case analyzed. Our laboratory is therefore well-positioned to re-classify previously reported variants as new information becomes available. If a variant previously reported by Blueprint Genetics is re-classified, our laboratory will issue a follow-up statement to the original ordering healthcare provider at no additional cost, according to our latest follow-up reporting policy."
