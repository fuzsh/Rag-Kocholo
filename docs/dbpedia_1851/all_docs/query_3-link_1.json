        "text": "Discussion\n\nHere we describe two major ultrastructural features of the white matter in HDLS: (1) axonal spheroids and (2) the changes in capillary basal lamina. The pathology was further characterized by IEM.\n\nSpheroids contained various combinations of cytoplasmic components. Thus, some spheroids were filled with packed neurofilaments and a few trapped cellular organelles, such as mitochondria, ribosomes and vesicles, while others were packed with membrane-bound dense bodies and a few filaments scattered among them. Aggregation of filaments either pushed organelles peripherally or confined them centrally. Whether the various types of spheroids represent different stages of axonal degeneration remains unknown. It is also not clear whether the accumulation of neurofilaments is the cause or result of axonal swelling.\n\nOur early study of HDLS showed immunohistochemical staining of abundant spheroids with pNF [11]. In this study, a subset of spheroids was immunoreactive to antibodies against nonpNF and αB-crystallin. Immunostaining of nonpNF to demyelinating axons and axon-terminal spheroids is thought to be indicative of axonal transaction in multiple sclerosis [16]. αB-crystallin is a member of heat shock proteins with diverse functions in the nervous system [17]. Its roles, if any, in HDLS remains to be determined.\n\nMyelin sheaths of spheroids also showed various thicknesses. The larger (more swollen) spheroids appear to have thinner sheaths. This correlation could be confirmed by quantitative studies. Loss/thinning of myelin sheaths would result in decompaction of the sheath and subsequent swelling of axons and accumulation of axonal contents. EM also revealed vacuoles between axoplasm and myelin sheath, giving the appearance of peripheral vacuolations of spheroids by light microscopy. Since myelin sheaths are produced by oligodendrocytes, myelin pathology could be caused by oligodendrocyte degeneration. Transgenic mice overexpressing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by astrocytes selectively induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis and myelin vacuolation in the absence of immune cell infiltration. The primary demyelination then evolves to have many phagocytic macrophages, axonal damage and markedly oligodendrocyte loss [18]. In vanishing white matter disease (VWM), a disorder clinically and pathologically similar to HDLS, white matter pathology has been shown to be due, at least in part, to oligodendrocyte dysfunction and loss [19, 20]. VWM has been linked to mutations in genes encoding the subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B [21, 22], which were shown to be unaffected in HDLS in our previous study [11]. Additional quantitative and qualitative studies of oligodendrocytes are needed in HDLS.\n\nIt has been postulated that in Binswanger disease hypoperfusion of the deep white matter due to stenosis of the long penetrating arterioles causes demyelination, axonal loss and gliosis of the subcortical white matter or leukoencephalopathy [23]. In the first report of HDLS, Axelsson et al. [1] noted white matter capillary pathology in the form of duplicated basal lamina (BL). Their low magnification micrograph looked similar to ours. Here, we provide higher resolution images of common findings in capillary BL of HDLS. Normally, the vascular BL is a thin, amorphous structure that is formed by fusion of two basal laminae, each from the vascular endothelial cell/pericyte and the perivascular astrocyte [24]. In HDLS many capillaries in affected white matter showed the two basal laminae were widely separated and the widened space was deposited with large amounts of banded collagen and other material. Similar capillary ultrastructure has been reported in white matter of biopsy tissues from human leukodystrophies, including adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan's disease and Alexander's diseases [25]. Therefore, these changes cannot be due to post mortem changes in autopsy tissues. Similar collagenosis in the human cerebral periventricular white mater (WM) has been shown to increase with age, notably after 70 years of age [26]. The ages of our cases were mostly younger than that (i.e. 46, 49, 51, 55, 62 and 71 years). Further, these changes were observed in white matter beyond the periventricular area in our cases, and in spinal cords of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases with a mean age of 60.7 ± 7.8 years [27 and references therein], as well as a 15-year-old ALS patient [our unpublished data], suggesting that factor(s) other than old age may be involved. It is noteworthy that Kondo and Suzuki [25] also reported increased pinocytotic vesicles in the capillary endothelial cells and postulated that this and the widened capillary wall may be closely related to the disruption of blood-brain barrier in leukodystrophies. The banded collagen in HDLS has normal diameter (20 to 100 nm) and periodicity (65 nm). Occasionally, some fibers had diameters over 100 nm; others aggregated and showed ragged, moth-eaten appearance. Such appearance is thought to be due to dissociated or poorly packed collagen fibrils [28].\n\nPrevious studies did not identify the basal lamina components. Our IEM finding is the first to identify capillary banded collagen as being derived from type I and III collagen, which also had association with fibronectin, but not collagen type IV. A recent review lists collagen IV, laminin, nidogen and perlecan as four major components of basal lamina in general [29]. Fibronectin is not considered a component per se, due to its variable detection [29]. During cerebral angiogenesis in the rat, fibronectin was down-regulated in capillaries [30]. It was strongly increased in adult mice subjected to hypobaric hypoxia [31], indicating angiogenic role for fibronectin. In Binswanger's disease, there is a marked deposition of several collagen types, including type I, in intracerebral arterioles and capillaries [32]. Accumulation of collagen could be due to increase synthesis or decreased degradation. Metalloproteinases (MMP) are enzymes involved in degradation of extracellular matrix, and MMP-2 and -9 degrade collagen types I and III [33]. Interestingly, MMP-2 activity was decreased, while MMP-9 activity was significantly increased in spinal cord of ALS patients [34], where we and others have seen deposits of collagen in capillary basal lamina. The significance of our findings with respect to cerebral capillary function in HDLS, and perhaps other neurodegenerative disorders, remains to be investigated.\n\nOn a technical note, there are some reports that immunolabeling of fibrillar collagen requires collagenase digestion to loosen up the interactions between collagens and other extracellular components. We were able to detect capillary associated collagen in paraffin embedded sections simply by heating in pH 7 citrate buffer (data not shown), while no pretreatments were needed for IEM, indicating that these collagens are probably not tightly bound with basal lamina components. This notion agrees with the loose and random distribution of the collagens fibrils in the widened basal lamina.\n\nUltrastructure of lipid-laden macrophages has not been reported in previous cases of HDLS. The ceroid-like ultrastructural appearance, with lamellated or fingerprint-like bodies, was similar to that reported in neuronal ceroidlipofuscinoses [35] and orthochromatic leukodystrophy [36, 37] and may be nonspecific [38]. On the other hand, they appear to be a consistent finding in HDLS.\n\nIn summary, we describe ultrastructural pathology in white matter of HDLS. Spheroids of myelinated or demyelinated swollen axons contained packed pNF and variable non-pNF, mitochondria and cellular debris. Capillaries have split basal laminae with considerable deposits of banded collagen type I and III that were associated with fibronectin, but not type IV collagen. It remains to be determined if these changes are a primary cause or a reactive response of white matter degeneration in HDLS."
