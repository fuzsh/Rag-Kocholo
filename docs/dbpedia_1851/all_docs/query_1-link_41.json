        "text": "Overview\n\nLeukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that affect the white matter of the central nervous system, with some entities also affecting the peripheral nervous system. There are over 30 different leukodystrophies, with an overall population incidence of 1 in 7663 live births (09; 57). They are now most commonly grouped based on the initial pattern of central nervous system white matter abnormalities on neuroimaging. Every leukodystrophy is unique in its clinical presentation and pathologic mechanisms, but there is also significant variability within each leukodystrophy, which poses clinical challenges. However, as our knowledge increases, clinical approaches to patients with leukodystrophies and novel therapeutics are constantly being innovated. Nevertheless, early diagnosis with genetic counseling remains one of the cornerstones of patient care.\n\nKey points\n\nHistorical note and terminology\n\nThe first leukodystrophy was identified in the early 20th century. Both Nissl and Alzheimer coincidentally reported metachromatic staining of the white matter of an adult patient diagnosed with what we now call metachromatic leukodystrophy (04; 39). Globoid cell leukodystrophy, or Krabbe disease, was described in 1916 when Hallervorden suggested that globoid cells may contain kerasin or cerebroside. Biochemical and histochemical studies confirmed the presence of cerebroside in globoid cells (05), and galactocerebroside was the only glycolipid that could produce globoid cells when experimentally injected into the central nervous system of animals. Until the early 1990s, the known leukodystrophies were metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, Canavan disease, Alexander disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, and 2 forms of adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophies (02).\n\nOne difficulty has been in differentiating which clinical syndrome qualifies as a leukodystrophy rather than a leukoencephalopathy. Over the years, multiple terminologies, including demyelination, dysmyelination, leukoencephalopathy, and leukodystrophy, have been used for the varied spectrum of clinical and radiological phenotypes with white matter involvement. Most recently, a consensus of experts in the field better defined the terms. Leukodystrophies are defined as “heritable disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system involvement with common glial cell or myelin sheath abnormalities.” Disorders with significant white matter abnormality that does not meet the inclusion criteria for leukodystrophies are considered genetic leukoencephalopathies (57).\n\nThe consensus definition does emphasize that CNS diseases in which neuropathology shows primary involvement of neurons in the cerebral cortex or other gray matter structures, but in which brain MRI also detects significant abnormalities of white matter, should not be characterized as leukodystrophies. For example, disorders like San Filippo disease, Batten disease, etc., which can cause secondary white matter abnormalities, are not defined as leukodystrophies. Similarly, disorders that are primary vasculopathies resulting in white matter abnormalities are also not classified as leukodystrophies (eg, COL4A2-, COL4A1-, and CADASIL-related disorders). Interestingly, the definition does not discriminate based on clinical presentation. Many of the leukodystrophies do not present as such (eg, adrenomyeloneuropathy, PLP1 presenting as spastic paraplegia). Also, the clinical progression does not need to be progressive to meet the definition of leukodystrophy; for example, megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts caused by HEPACAM mutations can be characterized by clinical improvements.\n\nTable 1. Disorders Characterized As Leukodystrophy Under 2015 GLIA Definition\n\nPresentation and course\n\nPatients suspected of having a leukodystrophy require a thorough history (including family history), a thorough general and neurologic examination, brain MRI, and referrals to various subspecialists. Leukodystrophies are rare and clinically heterogeneous with various ages of disease onset. Some have more systemic involvement than others, and some have a more progressive course than others. Due to the clinical variability, it is difficult to create a set of symptoms common among all leukodystrophies. However, there are red flag neurologic features on history and examination that should alert a clinician to initiate a workup for leukodystrophy.\n\nClinical history. A clinical history or a family history of developmental regression or stagnation, especially in motor development is often the first symptom in many demyelinating leukodystrophies (53). Additionally, a delay in acquisition of milestones can be seen in the hypomyelinating leukodystrophies. Though many of the leukodystrophies are heritable, some have been observed as sporadic cases, especially in adult-onset leukodystrophies (33). Age of onset is also an important factor that may guide diagnosis as some leukodystrophies are more common in adults, such as adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). Most patients with ALSP will present with cognitive and frontal lobe-based behavioral symptoms and signs months before motor deficits develop (28). With many leukodystrophies, such as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, a patient may present at any age; however, presenting symptoms may be different in each age group. For example, childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy is most common between the ages of 3 and 11 years, whereas adrenomyeloneuropathy is more common among males in their third decade (52).\n\nExamination. Neurologic examination can be revealing and aid in diagnosis. Neurologic signs concerning for a central nervous system pathology, such as appendicular hypertonicity and axial hypotonicity, would indicate the need for neuroimaging. Patients with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome can have axial hypotonia and appendicular hypertonia, along with abnormal eye movements, persistence of the tonic neck reflex, and difficulty with vision (12). Other common neurologic abnormalities seen in patients with leukodystrophies are a combination of spasticity and cerebellar ataxia, as in Krabbe disease and 4H syndrome (41). This can affect all 4 extremities or only the lower extremities with delays of independent walking. Dystonia may be present when the basal ganglia are involved as in hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum and in RNA polymerase III-related leukodystrophy (47; 42; 03). Tendon reflexes are usually increased, but decreased ankle reflexes compared to knee jerks suggest the presence of a peripheral neuropathy, for example, as seen in metachromatic leukodystrophy (08). The presence of peripheral nerve involvement can be subtle with normal nerve conduction velocity (50). Sensory examination is typically grossly normal, but vibration perception is often reduced, especially when the disease process also affects peripheral nerves (37).\n\nAs many of these leukodystrophies cause systemic symptoms, a general examination is also important. Growth is often delayed in systemic disorders, such as mitochondrial diseases; head circumference may be small in patients with Krabbe disease or megalencephalic in those with Canavan disease, Alexander disease, or megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts. A complete eye examination is important as findings can help narrow diagnosis. Patients with peroxisomal biogenesis disorders commonly have cataracts, corneal clouding, and findings consistent with glaucoma. Hepatomegaly can also be seen in patients with peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (27). Examination of the mouth can reveal a variety of teeth abnormalities, such as hypodontia, suggesting 4H syndrome (50). Examination of the extremities may reveal xanthomas, indicating cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (36). Examination of the skin may show increased skin pigmentation, suggesting adrenal insufficiency and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (41); ichthyosis would suggest the diagnosis of Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (23).\n\nNeuroimaging. Neuroimaging is key to the diagnosis of a leukodystrophy. By definition, in leukodystrophies, T2-weighted MRI signal hyperintensity in the white matter must be present, but T1-weighted signal may be variable (44; 59). Isointense or hyperintense T1 signal is consistent with a hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. It is also important to note that individual MRIs are generally not sufficient to determine delayed or hypomyelination, especially when done before 1 year of age. Therefore, serial MRIs, at least 6 months apart, are generally recommended (41). Other myelin pathologies, including demyelinating leukodystrophies, cause hypointense T1 signal (44; 58).\n\nA number of leukoencephalopathies (diseases that predominantly affect the white matter of the brain) may be confused with and initially diagnosed as leukodystrophies. Therefore, it is important to consider other acquired and genetic disorders that may result in white matter disease on neuroimaging when evaluating a patient for leukodystrophy (Table 2) (57).\n\nAcquired disorders. Acquired disorders can affect the white matter of the brain. Postinfectious, infectious, and autoimmune disorders can result in demyelination without a primary genetic basis. Disorders such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, multiple sclerosis, and neuromyelitis optica typically differentiate themselves from the heritable disorders of the white matter by abrupt onset and multiphasic presentations (59). In addition, MRI abnormalities are more likely to be multifocal and patchy (44), with variation or even improvement over time and with treatment. Nevertheless, when evaluating a child with a suspected leukodystrophy, it is always important to exclude potentially treatable or reversible acquired disorders. Central nervous system injury, particularly in the perinatal period, can result in significant white matter signal abnormalities but will typically also be irregular in appearance and may result in a loss of white matter volume, characteristics to help differentiate it from a leukodystrophy (59).\n\nPrimary neuronal disorders. Primary neuronal disorders are often associated with significant white matter abnormalities (51). The infantile variants of disorders like GM1 gangliosidosis, GM2 gangliosidosis, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis may have significant white matter abnormalities because the primarily neuronal disease disrupts the normal myelination process. Later onset variants of these disorders eventually affect the cerebral white matter, and mild signal abnormalities arise related to Wallerian degeneration with loss of axons and myelin. In other disorders, such as MCT8-related disorder (62), myelination can be extremely delayed but progress over time to become almost complete. These are not considered primary white matter disorders. Primary neuronal disorders may, thus, be confused with leukodystrophies (44). When features such as significant encephalopathy and seizures are present in a child with leukoencephalopathy, primary neuronal disorders should be considered along with leukodystrophies.\n\nDisorders affecting white and gray matter. Some disorders affect the white and gray matter indiscriminately and are not leukodystrophies. When evaluating a patient with abnormal white matter on neuroimaging, it is important to carefully evaluate for associated cortical lesions. Examples include mitochondrial disorders, such as MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and seizures) and POLG1-associated mitochondrial encephalopathy, or familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, which results in both white and gray matter injury (66).\n\nVasculopathies. Vasculopathies can result in white matter signal abnormalities but are not leukodystrophies. Genetic abnormalities of the vessel wall, such as CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infants), and defects in COL4A1, such as in autosomal dominant porencephaly, can give multifocal and, in the end, confluent signal abnormalities in the periventricular and deep white matter, typically with multifocal abnormalities in the central gray matter structures and brainstem (06). Cathepsin A-related arteriopathy with strokes and leukoencephalopathy also has been described in adult patients to show extensive white matter disease (11; 20). However, because they are not primary glial cell disorders, they are arbitrarily not considered leukodystrophies.\n\nTable 2. Heritable Disorders with Significant White Matter Involvement That Are Not Leukodystrophies\n\nFor further information and assistance in unsolved leukodystrophies, please also see the Myelin Disorders Bioregistry Project at www.myelindisorders.org.\n\nIn patients with advanced neurologic signs, there is no disease-specific therapy; therefore, the main management procedures remain symptomatic and supportive and consist of the following (01):\n\nIn general, once a patient has been diagnosed with a leukodystrophy, the patient should be referred to a center with expertise in managing patients with leukodystrophies.\n\nIn select leukodystrophies, therapies exist to slow disease progression and perhaps change the natural history of the disease. In cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, early treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid has shown to slow the progression of both the neurologic and non-neurologic disease (38). Additionally, in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and typically in those who have not yet developed neurologic signs, bone marrow transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is effective and may also be partially effective in patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy and Krabbe disease (10; 60). It is not clear how transplant prevents progression of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, but the effect is likely related to immunological modification. However, in lysosomal disease, the therapeutic efficacy of transplantation relies on the migration of donor bone marrow-derived cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage into diseased target organs, where they replace the resident enzyme-deficient population and become a local and steady source of the missing enzyme (40). On the other hand, in metachromatic leukodystrophy, there is no enzymatic cross-correction; rather, inflammatory and immune modulation likely explains the therapeutic effect (65). In select metachromatic leukodystrophy patients, such as in the very early stage of the juvenile and adult forms of leukodystrophy, transplantation has been reported to delay onset and slow progression of the disease (10). Clinical experience has shown no efficacy of transplantation if performed in symptomatic patients with early-onset disease or in advanced stages for patients with late-onset disease. Unfortunately, considering these selection criteria, only a minority of metachromatic leukodystrophy patients can benefit from transplantation, which can be further limited by the availability of HLA-compatible donors (40). In addition, transplantation is associated with fairly high morbidity and mortality due to conditioning regimens, rejection, failure of engraftment, and graft-versus-host disease. However, with the advent of reduced-intensity conditioning and availability of umbilical cord blood, mortality and morbidity have been reduced, and the umbilical cord blood allows for a more readily available stem cell source (55). Ex-vivo gene therapy, which negates the need for a matched donor and the risk of rejection altogether, has been attempted for patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy (46; 16); thus far, the results are promising.\n\nCurrently, leukodystrophies thought to have disease modifying therapies are X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis; however, early detection is imperative to make a meaningful difference in outcomes (41)."
