        "text": "Pelizaeus–Merzbacher Disease\n\nPelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD, OMIM 312080) is the prototypic hypomyelinating disorder, and is caused by alterations in the proteolipid 1 (PLP1) gene [Hudson et al., 1989; Trofatter et al., 1989]. Located on Xq22.2, this gene encodes the PLP1 protein, which constitutes roughly half of all myelin protein. The most common abnormality is a duplication of the entire gene, found in 60–70 percent of PMD cases and associated with the classic form of the disease [Ellis and Malcolm, 1994; Sistermans et al., 1998]. The lack of common breakpoints in these duplications results in varying sizes of the duplicated area between patients. Missense mutations account for 10–15 percent of cases. Several missense mutations affecting splicing or putative regulation of expression have also been described. Deletions are also seen in a smaller number of cases. Triplications are present in 1–2 percent of cases; higher copy numbers have been described in one child. More complex chromosomal rearrangements involving PLP1 or its promoter region have been described in individual cases [Muncke et al., 2004]. Deletions or null mutations are rare. Roughly 15 percent of cases fulfilling diagnostic criteria for PMD do not possess identifiable PLP1 mutations, suggesting the possibility of mutations in regulatory regions beyond genetic assays.\n\nThe clinical features of PMD were well described by Pelizaeus and Merzbacher. Typically, affected boys develop a pendular nystagmus at the age of several weeks, similar to infants with congenital nystagmus. Shortly thereafter, delayed psychomotor development becomes apparent. These infants show axial hypotonia with difficult head control, titubation, exaggerated tendon reflexes, and a combination of ataxia and extrapyramidal features. Nystagmus may improve or even disappear over time. Optic atrophy is common. In classic PMD, patients are unable to walk, and often unable to sit without support. If they develop active speech, it is difficult to understand because of dysarthria and scanning speech. A learning problem or cognitive impairment is common, although motor impairment tends to be more pronounced than cognitive disability. In connatal PMD, symptoms are evident shortly after birth and often include congenital stridor, feeding difficulties, and profound hypotonia. Development is more impaired than in the classic form; connatal PMD patients do not learn to talk or sit without support, and make very little developmental progress. Microcephaly is common. Transitional PMD is intermediate in severity between the connatal and classic variants. These three subtypes likely form a continuous spectrum. Epilepsy is rare in PMD, even in the severe connatal form, and has only been described in exceptional cases.\n\nClinical course in PMD is chronic. Until late childhood or early adolescence, patients may improve and make definite, albeit slow, developmental progress. From this age, however, slow deterioration begins, with insidious progression of neurologic symptoms and slow cognitive decline. Optic atrophy, if not yet present, develops. While difficult to predict for individual patients, life expectancy is reduced, and depends on severity of neurologic deficits and additional complications. Connatal PMD patients often die within the first decade of life, classic PMD patients in the second or third decade.\n\nPMD is allelic with a relatively mild disorder, X-linked spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2), also caused by PLP1 mutations [Saugier-Veber et al., 1994]. In its pure form, the sole symptom associated with SPG2 is slowly increasing spasticity, more of the legs than of the arms, which begins during childhood or adolescence. In the complicated forms, additional symptoms, such as nystagmus, ataxia, dysarthria, and mild cognitive impairment, are present. Life expectancy in this form is normal. Peripheral neuropathy is another possible finding with certain PLP1 mutations. Altogether, alterations of PLP1 mutations give rise to a spectrum of disorders, ranging from the very severe connatal phenotype to mild spastic paraplegia with adolescent onset.\n\nGenotype–phenotype correlations have been established for most PLP1 alterations, although clinical heterogeneity among patients with common genetic alterations makes definitive characterization difficult. Symptoms do not correlate with duplication size, but high copy number appears to predict increased clinical severity. Severe epilepsy has been reported in children with triplications, an otherwise uncommon feature of PMD [Wolf et al., 2005]. Point mutations are associated with the full spectrum of PLP1-connected disorders [Cailloux et al., 2000]. Demyelinating neuropathy is associated with either null mutations or mutations in PLP-specific regions. Patients with functional null mutations show relatively mild clinical course; they usually achieve independent, albeit clumsy, ambulation, and show mild cognitive impairment and demyelinating neuropathy. As spasticity increases after the first decade, patients become wheelchair-bound and develop pseudobulbar palsy. Histopathologic investigations show evidence of length-dependent axonal degeneration in these patients and in corresponding mouse models [Garbern et al., 2002].\n\nPLP1 is a highly conserved, hydrophobic membrane protein with four transmembrane domains and a large cytosolic loop between the second and third transmembrane domains. The N- and C-termini are located in the cytoplasm. Different splicing of PLP1 yields a second, smaller isoform, DM20. Both isoforms are primarily expressed within the CNS. While the function of PLP1 and DM20 remains poorly understood, mutations that leave DM20 intact are associated with relatively mild phenotype. Mutations associated with severe phenotype likely cause protein misfolding, which activates compensatory oligodendrocytic responses that ultimately cause oligodendrocyte apoptosis. The pathogenicity of PLP1 duplications is less well understood, although it has been speculated that overexpressed PLP1 in endosomal and lysosomal compartments depletes myelin rafts of lipids necessary for the production of functional myelin compounds [Garbern, 2007].\n\nInterestingly, female heterozygotes may develop symptoms. In cases of PLP1 duplications, symptoms are rare and include transient, PMD-like symptoms in young girls. Symptom development in females tends to be associated with mutations causing mild phenotypes in males. It has been suggested that severe mutations and duplications cause early apoptosis in oligodendrocytes expressing the mutated allele in females. Oligodendrocytes expressing the wild-type allele proliferate to compensate for the loss of mutant cells. Mild mutations, however, do not elicit oligodendrocytic apoptosis, and surviving mutant cells cause impaired myelin formation and ultimate axonal degeneration. Female carriers of these mutations develop slowly progressive spastic paraplegia and cognitive decline later in life.\n\nMRI in PMD shows hypomyelination, indicated by diffusely elevated white-matter signal on T2 (Figure 71-3A). Myelination is arrested and fails to progress on repeated scans. Some patients show a more mottled, “tigroid” signal, perhaps due to small myelinated areas surrounding blood vessels. In some patients, myelin deposition is seen in the posterior limb of the internal capsule or the optic radiations. Myelination is usually present in the brainstem and sometimes in the cerebellar hemispheres. Often – but not always – the pyramidal tracts in the brainstem show high T2 signal. At a young age, atrophy is not considerable, especially in the cerebellum, although white-matter volume may be decreased. The corpus callosum is thin, reflecting lack of myelinated axons. As children grow older, generalized atrophy develops. Proton MR spectroscopy reveals low choline, due to reduced membrane turnover in the absence of myelinating oligodendrocytes, and normal to elevated N-acetylaspartate (NAA), due to more densely packed axons. Patients with null mutations or deletions show more advanced supratentorial myelination. In SPG2 patients, MRI abnormalities are variable, ranging from diffuse mild hypomyelination to mild periventricular signal changes. Carrier females sometimes display small areas of elevated white-matter signal, but MRI is usually normal.\n\nDiagnosis of PMD is based on typical clinical presentation, radiologic evidence of hypomyelination, and detection of PLP1 alterations. Routine laboratory and metabolic tests, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), are normal. As most PLP1 alterations are duplications, simple sequencing must also be accompanied by gene dose quantification by Southern blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or, more recently, multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Recently, elevation of the dipeptide N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) has been described in several PMD cases, with NAAG level appearing to predict clinical severity [Burlina et al., 2006]. The mechanism of NAAG elevation, however, remains unknown, and it is neither specific to PMD, nor a marker of hypomyelination.\n\nHypomyelination with Atrophy of the Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum\n\nHypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (HABC, OMIM 612438) is a rare disorder of unknown genetic origin [van der Knaap et al., 2002]. As no affected siblings of children with HABC have been reported, it is possible that this entity arises from a dominant de novo mutation, although autosomal-recessive inheritance remains possible. Disease severity ranges from severely affected infants presenting shortly after birth to more mildly affected children with initially normal development. In severe cases, children fail to achieve motor milestones and linguistic development, and show profound axial hypotonia. Some have nystagmus, and optic atrophy is possible. Spasticity is common. Extrapyramidal symptoms, comprising dystonia, rigidity, and choreoathetosis, are uniquely common to HABC relative to other white-matter disorders. Failure to thrive and microcephaly are common. In mildly affected children, unsupported walking is achieved within the first few years of life, sometimes on time, but is later lost. There is a combination of spasticity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and ataxia. cognitive impairment is mild, although patients tend to show cognitive decline in addition to deteriorating motor functions.\n\nRecently published neuropathologic findings from one HABC patient detail slightly reduced white-matter volume, reduced oligodendrocytes, severe myelin deficiency, especially of deep white matter, and some white-matter loss, as indicated by the presence of macrophages in perivascular regions [van der Knaap et al., 2007]. Axons appeared relatively preserved. There was mild astrocytosis and a strong presence of microglia. The putamen was visible only as a small streak, and microscopy revealed substantial neuronal loss. Cerebral cortex was normal, both macroscopically and microscopically. In the atrophic cerebellum, there was loss of granule cells. Pyramidal tracts appeared degenerated in the brainstem and spinal cord. Metabolic investigations are normal in these children.\n\nMRI shows hypomyelination. In some children, T2 white-matter signal is less hyperintense, indicating some myelin deposition. The cerebellum is atrophic, the vermis more so than the cerebellar hemispheres. Characteristic MRI features are atrophy or absence (in the later stages) of the putamen, apparent within the first year of life. The caudate is reduced, and in some patients, disappears entirely. Thalamic and pallidal volume remains normal. Over time, white-matter loss leads to supratentorial atrophy. The extent of basal ganglia and white-matter atrophy predicts clinical severity. These MRI features are considered diagnostic at this time.\n\nSialic Acid Storage Disorders\n\nSalla disease (OMIM 604369) and infantile sialic acid storage disease (ISSD, OMIM 269920) are both caused by autosomal-recessive mutations in SLC17A5, coding for Sialin, a lysosomal membrane protein transporting sialic acid from lysosomes [Verheijen et al., 1999]. The gene is located on chromosome 6q14/15. Recently, it was shown that Sialin also functions as a shuttle for aspartate and glutamate in synaptic vesicles [Miyaji et al., 2008]. Free sialic acid accumulates in lysosomes of many cell types, including liver and kidney cells and cultured fibroblasts. In leukocytes, this accumulation causes vacuoles visible at light microscopic examination. Electron microscopy reveals membrane-bound vacuoles filled with fibrillogranular amorphous material. The pathogenesis of free sialic acid storage disease and the role of sialic acid remain unclear.\n\nBoth diseases are characterized by elevated excretion of free sialic acid in urine. Sialic acid is also elevated in other fluids, such as CSF. Recently, two siblings have been described who lack the characteristic sialuria; sialic acid was elevated only in CSF [Mochel et al., 2009]. Prevalent in Finland, Salla disease is characterized by seemingly normal early development, followed by presentation with hypotonia and ataxia in the second half of the first year of life. Nystagmus is also common. It may be evident in the neonatal period and frequently disappears. Many children also show strabismus. Spasticity develops slowly, and mild extrapyramidal symptoms are common in later stages. Mean age at walking is 4 years, with roughly one-third of patients who do not develop independent ambulation. Language is severely affected and usually dysarthric; patients are, at best, able to produce short sentences. Epilepsy with short, complex focal seizures is relatively common. In some patients, there is evidence of peripheral hypomyelination with decreased nerve conduction velocities. The disease is stable over a long period of time, with ultimate late progression. Additional symptoms may include short stature or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Facial features become coarse in adulthood. Otherwise, there is no evidence for dysostosis multiplex or hepatosplenomegaly, despite the presence of free sialic acid storage in liver and spleen. Life expectancy is normal [Aula et al., 2000].\n\nISSD is a much more severe disease, with neonatal presentation and rapid progression. Hydrops fetalis is possible. Neonates may show hepatosplenomegaly and ascites. They have fair hair and coarse features. Milestones of normal development are not acquired, and death occurs within the first couple of years.\n\nA phenotype with intermediate severity relative to Salla disease and ISSD has also been identified.\n\nMRI in patients with Salla disease shows hypomyelination [Sonninen et al., 1999] (Figure 71-3D). There is white-matter volume loss. Corpus callosum may be stringlike, especially in severe cases. There is usually cerebellar atrophy, and supratentorial atrophy is found in older patients. Thickening of the calvarium is another common radiologic feature. Proton MR spectroscopy reveals a high NAA peak, likely due to elevated free sialic acid, whose N-acetyl peak co-resonates with the N-acetyl peak of NAA [Varho et al., 1999]."
