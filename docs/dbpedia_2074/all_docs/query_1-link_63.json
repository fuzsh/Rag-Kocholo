Caroline Dinkelspiel and Caroline Nilsson. Caroline Dinkelspiel followed Victoria to USA and they studied there together, Victoria was her bridesmaid. Caroline Nilsson is one of Sweden's richest women, and her father Björn was king Carl Gustaf's very good friend. When Björn died of cancer in 1999, the king and queen became like extra parents to Caroline Nilsson.\n\nLouise Thott is Madeleine's best friend. They met at Enskilda Gymnasiet and have hanged together ever since. Louise studied in London when Madeleine moved there, they have studied together in Stockholm. Louise is very involved in World Childhood Foundation. Louise is an interior decorator and has helped Madeleine to decorate many of her homes. At Madeleine's wedding Cedric Notz, one of Chris's best friends, was the bestman. At the wedding he met Andrea Brodin, one of Victoria's best friends, and now they live together in Lidingö and have a daughter.\n\nKing Carl Gustaf is a very good friend of Aje Philipson, they have known since they were very young. The king has a big group of friends, and collects them to various clubs.\n\nAlice Trolle-Wachtmeister was one of queen Silvia's closest friends. She meant very much for the queen. They met already in 1972 in Germany. Alice helped the queen to build her Household, which wasn't so easy then when the court was filled with elder, conservative men. Abba sang \"Dancing Queen\" to Silvia, but she didn't know then that one of members of Abba would become one of her closest friends. Anni-Frid Lyngstad, who married in 1992 prince Heinrich Ruzzo of Reuss, who was a friend of king Carl Gustaf, they had studied together in Sigtuna. Seven years after the wedding Anni-Frid became a widow, and queen Silvia was a great support to her then. Anni-Frid shares with the queen a great interest in charity work.\n\nCarl Philip's best friend is Jan-Åke Hansson, they studied together and Lundsberg and Jan-Åke was Carl Philip's bestman at the wedding. Carl Philip and Madeleine are very close and they share the circle of friends. Two other friends: Janne \"Flash\" Nilsson learned Carl Philip to race and Mattias Klum, a nature photographer, has helped Carl Philip at his interest in photography. Mattias was Carl Philip's mentor for many years.\n\nSofia is very close to her sisters. Sofia was at Paradise Hotel, and there was also hairdresser Marre Hitti. Today they are good friends and Marre is the one who often does Sofia's hairdos.\n\nAll friends of the royal family are loyal, discreet and absolutely not tell anything to the press. If they do, then they are out.\n\nHär är nyckelpersonerna runt kungafamiljen _ Aftonbladet\n\nIt would have been interesting whom they would have named as Daniel's best friends, but they didn't speak about him at all.\n\nAftonbladet's royal reporter Jenny Alexandersson and royal expert Sara Ericsson talked about the friends of the royal family at the \"Kungligt med Jenny\" broadcast.\n\nVictoria's closest friends are two Carolines.

She has a new hairstylist who has done her hair for most for her engagements in the past 3 years.\n\nThey have spend a couple of days in Tuscany at a house of their friends. Andrea writes at her blog:\n\nI must say that this trip has really been an eye-opener for how people actually had it this spring. I've talked to Italians, British, Frenchmen, restaurant owners, hotel owners, service staff, shop staff etc. It's so easy to have a view from home through the media but to really talk to people who have gone through something we may not even imagine - it is clearly this has left traces in people in a way that we in Sweden have not experienced in the same way when we have not been in lockdown.\n\nBut wherever we have been, we have been received with open arms. The fact that we come from Sweden is not a concern, many people think we have done quite right and had wished that Italy, for example, had not had such a strict lockdown, especially in the southern parts which did not have so many cases if some. But as they say themselves \"it had never worked with the voluntary measures you have done - we are just not like this, no one had listened or followed any advice in the same way as you people in the north\". By comparison, we have also had many of the rules and demands that they have here and our relationship in Sweden to social distance is clearly better than here. Here you hide behind the \"safety of the mask\".\n\nInteresting thoughts on Swedish culture and its relation to public policy.\n\nAndrea tells at her blog that their wedding will be in Sweden. And that they are trying to get things together for the wedding. It is a mini-wedding because of everything, but you still want it to be wonderful and atmospheric. They have sent the invitations, set the theme and flowers, Andrea has fixed a dress for herself and clothes for Ivar so far. Now they are thinking about the music and Andrea asked for suggestions for a nice song in English during the ceremony. However, she is not going to sing herself as she did at both Ivar and Isabella's christenings.\n\nAndrea is also planning the table decorations with flowers.\n\nAbout them coming to Provence, obviously the house belongs to Andrea's parents (Andrea and Cedric have been there almost every summer), because she writes that due to covid, travel restrictions and family members in the risk group, no one has been able to be there for over six months so they really needed to come and take care of the house. There was a lot to do.\n\nJaxy seems to have had a great time\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CCbewp4lHwg/\n\nThey have been at a restaurant in Plage Pampelonne beach in Tropezina, Diana:\n\nhttps://files.elle.se/uploads/sites/82/2020/07/img_3514.jpg\n\nhttps://files.elle.se/uploads/sites/82/2020/07/img_3501.jpg\n\nhttps://files.elle.se/uploads/sites/82/2020/07/img_3504.jpg\n\nhttps://files.elle.se/uploads/sites/82/2020/07/img_3517.jpg\n\nBathina Philipson is in Ibiza.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CCbpNg5JGXG/\n\nAndrea Brodin, Cedric Notz and the kids arrived last weekend from Provence to Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nYesterday Andrea and her children were at Société Nautique de Genève.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CC37-dypqeF/\n\nNice photo of Andrea in Provence\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CCwI-njp01z/\n\nPeter Forsberg celebrated yesterday his 47th birthday with his family at their summer house in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CC2tVi3JfUV/\n\nAje and Bathina Philipson had some great time a few days ago with part of their family.

The place for the wedding was scenic Ulriksdal by Edsviken.\n\nAmong the guests were best friend Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel.\n\nShe is one of Crown Princess Victoria's closest friends and he was Chris O'Neill's best man during the wedding to Princess Madeleine. It has been seven years since the TV profile and interior designer Andrea Brodin found love with entrepreneur Cedric Notz during the wedding.\n\nHe quickly chose to leave Switzerland for a life with Andrea in Sweden. In November 2016, they became the parents of their daughter Isabella, 3, and today, Saturday, they become husband and wife.\n\nToday, Saturday, a number of guests were invited to Andrea Brodin's parents Hans Eric ”Jejje” Brodin and Eva Benita ”Putzi” Brodin's beautiful home in Ulriksdal in Solna, next door to Ulriksdal's Palace Chapel. The couple have long been good friends with the royal couple.\n\nOn Instagram, Andrea Brodin has shared several details about the big day, including the color theme of the wedding is white, green and brass.\n\nWedding was held at the back of the house overlooking Edsviken.\n\nAs recently as today, she also expressed a sigh of relief over the warm and sunny weather forecast. Andrea has also arranged for each guest to have a designed bottle of hand sanitizer in their pocket.\n\nThe guests arrived shortly after five o'clock in a boat that came from Stockholm's inner city. There was a cheerful atmosphere on board and the guests were festively dressed in dark suits and elegant summer dresses. Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel were also present at the wedding, but chose to go out on their own.\n\nJust before six o'clock, the bride and groom showed up at the back of the house together with the bride's son Ivar. The wedding took place around 6 pm at the back of the house where white chairs and a rose arch stood. From the wedding venue, the guests and the bride and groom have a heavenly view of Edsviken.\n\nSocietetsparet gifta –*kronprinsessan Victoria gäst _ Aftonbladet\n\nAndrea and Cedric\n\nhttps://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagra...=90a0b1c2fae7f02de0d7618d178358d2&oe=5F6C058E\n\nhttp://imageupper.com/i/?S1200010090011D15981618862034767\n\nAndrea and Cedric, their dog Jaxy and Andrea's parents' dog Cora.\n\nhttps://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagra...=45b087a6d905ee6e36c63a40280aaee4&oe=5F699B50\n\nAndrea was wearing Antonia gown from swedish By Malina (bridal collection).\n\nAntonia gown - By Malina Official _ Designer Clothing & Accessories\n\nSvensk Damtidning's article has a video where Andrea and Cedric pose for photographers and after them Andrea's parents Hans Eric and Eva Benita Brodin.

They had chosen an unusually late wedding, it did not begin until 18.00. The wedding priest Carin Saracco is the pastor of the Church of Sweden in Mallorca.\n\nIt was here on beautiful Loviseberg in Ulriksdal's Palace Park just outside Stockholm where Crown Princess Victoria's classmate and childhood friend Andrea Brodin yesterday said yes to her Cedric Notz, after seven years together. Svensk Damtidning was the only newspaper on site.\n\nThe wedding took place out on the terrace, under an arch draped with undulating silk fabric, and on one of the chairs closest to the bride and groom sat Crown Princess Victoria, side by side with her Daniel. In honor of the day, they made a royal entrance behind black windows, driven by one of the Royal Stables' livery-dressed drivers.\n\nIt was a small and intimate wedding with only 30 guests, and Andrea and Cedric could not have chosen a more beautiful place, high above Edsviken and with a view away towards Ulriksdal Palace.\n\nEarlier in the day we saw Andrea in a glamorous white sequin dress from By Malina, knee-length and with long transparent sleeves, but now she was standing here in her wedding dress: Also the one from By Malina, a dream embroidered with sparkling stones and deep back décolletage.\n\nJust before the wedding we had a short chat with Andrea and Cedric, who were looking forward to celebrating love.\n\n- It feels so wonderful! We have really looked forward to this! Andrea said and Andrea's mother Putzi Brodin said:\n\n- We're so happy. Finally! And what a day, and what a joy… Even though we are only a few, but still, this joy we feel! That's wonderful.\n\nAndrea had chosen green, white and gold as a consistent color theme, and those tones were also repeated in the bridal bouquet, the beak party's flowers and the table decorations, all designed by the wedding florist Viktoria Falén and her Melody Flowers, who were on site well in advance to prepare. And outside, Nathalie Schuterman's brother Tom and his company Paratus Security held the positions.\n\nIt is set at seven tables and for the wedding menu was a catering team that had several chefs on site. On the other hand, the bride herself had brought the 14 boxes of porcelain here.\n\n- It's not easy to be picky with the details, haha, but I really wanted that porcelain! Andrea wrote earlier this week on her blog.\n\nThe wedding dinner was served inside the living rooms and while the guests were sitting at the table, the sun slowly set over Edsviken.\n\nAround the seven round tables sat the bride and groom's closest friends, such as Emilia de Poret with her husband Amaury, H&M's Lina von Heidenstam with her husband Petter, and Bathina and Aje Philipson. The live band that was in place did not play cool cocktail music: It was a rock classics all the way!\n\n17 magiska bilder! Victorias och Daniels fest i natt _ Svensk Dam\n\nEDIT Andrea just posted some great photos to her blog:\n\n\"A hug from us\n\nHello dear friends, what a day yesterday. You will get more pictures but right now we are enjoying this wonderful moment and our families.\"\n\nAndrea Brodins blogg på Elle.se\n\nBy Malina Bridal at Instagram\n\n\"Congratulations to beautiful @byandreabrodin who got married yesterday! You looked beyond stunning in our Antonia gown We wish you all the best!\"\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CEO1yzhnJMj/\n\nAndrea Brodin writes at her blog about her wedding dress, with a lot of good photos:\n\nWarning for many pictures, but here are a bunch of pictures of my \"first\" dress. For the dance, I changed due to Emilia's happy advice to a more dancing variant. Pictures will of course be on it as well.\n\nIt is ByMalina of course. Malin is a friend of mine so it was obvious that I would wear a dress from her. This dress was one of the first I tried and it fit perfectly right away. Just bring it on the hanger and release the stress over the dress!\n\nI had borrowed the earrings from my mother, Cedric had arranged the ring from Switzerland and the bridal bouquet had been tied by the best Melody Flowers.\n\nThen, of course, the best Lisa Höök took the pictures. Lisa is the photographer I work with the most when it comes to external images and she is a genius.\n\nYou will get so many pictures from me at the table setting and flowers, but now we have Cedric's family here and now we are going out to eat with them! Big hug and thank you for your congratulations, it warms.\n\nBrudklänning _ Andrea Brodin\n\nCedric Notz posted to his Instagram\n\n\"Just married - with a small Corona wedding. Finally I can call you my wife. Every day that passes I love you more. @byandreabrodin\"\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CEPi59YJ8uF/\n\nAndrea Brodin tells at her blog about the Wedding table setting:\n\nHere are some pictures from the wedding table setting this Saturday! Green, white and brass as I said.\n\nThe fine chairs and candlesticks in brass come from Rental Stories (which also had the magical bridal arch).

Crown Princess Victoria's childhood friend Andrea Brodin said yes to her Cedric Notz out on the beautiful terrace, in front of 30 guests. But now it is clear that the Brodin family will soon put an end to their 41 years in Ulriksdal Palace park.\n\nAndrea's parents Hans Eric and Eva Benita Brodin have decided to leave their wonderful home, the 1860s villa Loviseberg, and now it is for sale through the real estate company Per Jansson.\n\nThe villa with 12 rooms and a kitchen and lots of carpenter's joy. Loviseberg was one of the first villas built in the so-called Swiss style, according to the realtor.\n\nIn addition to the 394-square-meter house, there are also stables with three boxes, a garage for three cars with a guest floor, and a former tennis court. And a shared dock just below the house.\n\nThe Royal Palace Ulriksdal is just a stone's throw away as you can see, and Loviseberg was once built as a summer residence for the court jeweler GA Cedergren.\n\n“The dwelling house has been renovated with piety over the years, with great consideration given to the house's original style and design. A park-like idyllic garden slopes down to the water and is deliberately placed so that you can enjoy a magnificent sunset”, the broker announces.\n\nSo now you are probably wondering about the price?

Klum started as a photographer when he was 17. Later he was the first-ever Swede to have his photograph of a silvered leaf monkey on the cover of National Geographic. Since then, it’s been over 35 years of constant filming, writing, and photographing, where he’s passionately followed the changes in the planet’s nature, fauna, vulnerable cultures, and environments. He has shared these moments with a fascinated world, who through unique images got the chance to come along on his journeys. His motivation: to, through his love for nature and his holistic view on life, inspire the realization that it is how we use our time on Earth that decides its future. And he is hopeful.\n\n“New techniques and more cyclic thinking in, for instance, food production, changes behaviors.
