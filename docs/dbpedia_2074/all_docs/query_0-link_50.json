Whereas the basic liberties that all Americans enjoy are secured through the valor and dedication of the members of the Armed Forces of the United States; Whereas over 1,000,000 members of the Armed Forces are currently serving on active duty in over 120 countries worldwide; Whereas Americans also recognize with deep gratitude the contributions and sacrifices made by military families and that the members of military families share in the sacrifice and burden of protecting the Nation; Whereas the United States initiated Operation Enduring Freedom on October 19, 2001, and as of October 26, 2005, 246 members of the Armed Forces have died and 632 have been wounded in that Operation; Whereas the United States initiated Operation Iraqi Freedom on March 22, 2003, and as of October 25, 2005, 2,001 members of the Armed Forces have died and 15,220 have been wounded in that Operation; Whereas, in the words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, each of America's fallen ``stands in the unbroken line of patriots who have dared to die that freedom might live, and grow, and increase its blessings. Freedom lives, and through it, he lives - in a way that humbles the undertakings of most men''; Whereas all Americans owe the fallen, the wounded, and their families a debt that can never be fully repaid; and Whereas the sacrifices of members of the Armed Forces are often invoked in general but the fallen are seldom recognized and honored individually: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That-- (1) Congress honors the memory of Master Sergeant Evander E.
