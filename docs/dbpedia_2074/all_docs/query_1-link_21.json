Professor of geology at the University of Stockholm from 1897 until 1924, he ended his days as founder-director of the University's Geochronological Institute. There is more than one Baron de Geer in Europe. The originator of the branch of the family from which the famous geologist arose went to Sweden from what is now Belgium at the request of King Gustavus Adolphus early in the seventeenth century, and there started a large iron and steel industry. In after years successive de Geers played a great part, not only in the industry of Sweden, but also in her science and politics. Gerard's father, Louis, was Prime Minister for twelve years, and Gerard himself was a member of Parliament from 1900 until 1905. Recognition in Great Britain of his scientific eminence has been shown by award of the Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society in 1920, and by election to the foreign membership of the Royal Society in 1930.",
