        "text": "A recent discovery\n\nMy wife, Gail, is an avid genealogist, and she recently made a marvelous discovery. Nicholas Ridley, Bishop of London, who was burned at the stake in Oxford, on October 16, 1555, in the reign of “Bloody Mary,” is part of my family story because he is my 12th great-uncle. My direct family line runs from Nicholas’s older brother by two years, Hugh, who is my 11th great-grandfather.\n\nIn the course of our lives, we lived in Oxford for about 16 months, so we have very frequently walked by the Martyr’s Memorial which is located at the intersection of St Giles’, Magdalen Street, and Beaumont Street, to the west of Balliol College. Now, I wish that I had known of its importance in the history of my own family, because I would have seen it with quite different eyes.\n\nThe inscription on the base of the Martyrs’ Memorial reads:\n\n“To the Glory of God, and in grateful commemoration of His servants, Thomas Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley, Hugh Latimer, Prelates of the Church of England, who near this spot yielded their bodies to be burned, bearing witness to the sacred truths which they had affirmed and maintained against the errors of the Church of Rome, and rejoicing that to them it was given not only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer for His sake; this monument was erected by public subscription in the year of our Lord God, MDCCCXLI [1841].”\n\nIn this post, I’ll remind you of the inspiring story of Bishop Nicholas Ridley, and then I’ll lay out the genealogical details of my ancestral connection.\n\nThe life of Nicholas Ridley, my 12th Great-Uncle\n\nFor brevity, I will simply refer to Nicholas Ridley as “Ridley,” because you know whose story I’m recounting. I pondered doing some research to construct my own account, but my purpose in the first part of this post is simply to enable you to understand why I am so delighted to be related to Bishop Ridley. Consequently, I am going to give the late R. E. Nixon, formerly Principal of St. John’s College, Nottingham, England, the honor of contributing to my post his article on Ridley, in The New International Dictionary of the Christian Church for which J. D. Douglas served as general editor.\n\nRIDLEY, NICHOLAS (c. 1500-1555). Reformer and bishop of London. Born near Haltwhistle in Northumberland, he went to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1518. In 1524 he became a fellow of Pembroke and in 1527 went to the Sorbonne and Louvain, where he may have witnessed some of the Reformation controversies. He came back to Pembroke and in 1527 went to the Sorbonne and Louvain, where he may have witnessed some of the Reformation controversies. He came back to Pembroke in 1530 where he spent much of his time reading the Scriptures and learning them by heart. In 1537 he was appointed chaplain to Cranmer and the following year vicar of Herne, Kent, in Cranmer’s diocese. In 1540 he became a chaplain to the king, and master of Pembroke. In 1547 he was consecrated bishop of Rochester and in 1550 was translated to London.\n\nRidley’s long involvement in academic life was to stand him in good stead for the brief period of his episcopate. He seems to have been won round toward reformed views of the Eucharist through the study of De Corpore at Sanguini Domini, the work of a ninth-century monk, Ratramnus, or Bertram, who was refuting transubstantiation. He had previously thought transubstantiation to be primitive doctrine. From 1545 Ridley was convinced of the error of transubstantiation, and the following year he persuaded Cranmer, who in his turn persuaded Latimer. His influence was recognized by Brooks, who said at his trial, “Latimer leaneth to Cranmer, Cranmer to Ridley, and Ridley to the singularity of his own wit.” Ridley helped compile the Book of Common Prayer of 1549 and its revision in 1552, in which his eucharistic theology was given clearer liturgical expression. He was prominent in carrying through reforms in both his dioceses and when in London took the lead in the removal of stone altars and the substitution of wooden Communion tables. He was active in preaching on social questions and promoted the foundation of schools and hospitals.\n\nHe was to have returned to his native see of Durham, but on the death of Edward VI he supported the attempt to put Lady Jane Grey on the throne, and when that failed he was deprived and imprisoned. In 1554 he was taken with Cranmer and Latimer to Oxford, where they had to engage in various disputations. He stood firm by his views and, after burning of the Reformers had begun in 1555, Ridley and Latimer were sentenced to die at the stake. As the fires were lit Latimer cried out, “Be of good comfort, Master Ridley, and play the man. We shall this day light such a candle by God’s grace in England as I trust shall never be put out!”\n\nIn Oxford, on Broad Street, adjacent to Balliol College, there is a granite cross in the middle of the street, to mark the place where Latimer and Ridley were burned, followed some months later by Cranmer – as a permanent witness to that terrible event.\n\nOn a wall nearby, a plaque describes what happened there.\n\nI thank God for his work of grace in the life of my 12th Great-Uncle Nicholas, and I pray that his example will serve to encourage and inspire many others who suffer similarly for their faithfulness to the truths which they believe to have come from God. Until the Lord returns, there will always be a need in the world for “candles” like Ridley, Latimer, and Cranmer.\n\nMy genealogical connection to Nicholas Ridley\n\nThese details will probably be of interest primarily (or only) to other members of the Tiessen clan, but there may be an occasional genealogist who will have reason to examine it as well.\n\nWe can trace my father’s line back into the 15th century, to my15th great-grandfather. This is the line I’m going to trace, although it identifies links to a multitude of other lines, through the great-grandmothers that are significant figures in my ancestry. The further back we go, the greater the number of our ancestors.\n\nGeneration 1\n\nMy 15th great-grandfather was Nicholas Ridley (b. 1400)\n\nNicholas Ridley was born in Willmontswick, Northumberland in 1400. He married Alice Skelton in about 1420, in Willmontswick.\n\nGeneration 2\n\nMy 14th great-grandfather was Sir Nicholas Ridley (b. 1424)\n\nThis Nicholas Ridley was also born in Willmontswick, Northumberland, in 1424, and he died in 1467. There he married Anne Eaglesfield in 1450. She had been born in 1432, and she died in 1500.\n\nGeneration 3\n\nMy 13th great-grandfather was Sir Nicholas Ridley of Wythsmode\n\nSir Nicholas Ridley of Wythsmode, Knight was born in about 1450 in Northumberland, and he married Mary Elizabeth Curwen, thedaughter of Sir Christopher Curwen and Anne Pennington, in 1470, in Workington Hall, Cumberland, England. She had been born in Workington Hall in 1452, and she died in 1506, in Willmontswick, Northumberland.\n\nGeneration 4\n\nMy 12th great-grandfather was Christopher Ridley\n\nChristopher was the son of Nicholas Ridley of Wythsmode [b. 1450] and of Mary Elizabeth Curwen of Workington Hall, Cumberland [1452-1506]), and he was born in about 1475 in Uthank Hall, Willmontswick, Northumberland. He died in 1540, in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire. He married Anne Blenkinsop, who was born in 1475, also in Willmontswick.\n\nIn 2014, Gail and I walked across England (from Newcastle west to Bowness on Solway), by Hadrian’s Wall Path, in ten amazing days, without a drop of rain. On the night that our walk stopped in Once Brewed, we headed south to Hunter Crook Lodge, near Bardon Mills, and it is fun to realize now that we were fairly close to the manor house in which Nicholas and Hugh Ridley are commonly deemed to have been born.\n\n“Willimoteswick (or Willmontswick) is a fortified manor house situated on the south side of the South Tyne near Bardon Mill and is clearly visible as you travel east [via the highway]. The Willmontswick family occupied the Manor in the 12th century until it passed to the Ridley family in 1279. It is generally accepted as having been the birthplace of Bishop Ridley, who was burned at the stake in October 1555 for his teachings and support of Lady Jane Grey. Willimoteswick is now a family farm.” (Heart of Hadrian’s Wall)\n\nGeneration 5\n\nChristopher and Ann (Blenkinsop) Ridley are reported to have had six children:\n\nJane Ridley was born in 1497 in Willmontswick, and she died in 1562 and was buried in St. Saviour, London.\n\nHugh Ridley of Unthankhall (b. 1498) – see below.\n\nRichard Ridley was born in about 1500 in Willmontswick.\n\nAnne Ridley was born in about 1500 in Walltown, Northumberland.\n\nThe Nicholas Ridley who figures prominently in this family history was born about 1500. He is the one whose biography I detailed in the previous section of this post. He was Bishop of London and he died as a martyr, in Oxford, on Oct 16, 1555.\n\nAlice Ridley was born in 1502 in Willmontswick.\n\nMy 11th great-grandfather was Hugh Ridley\n\nHugh Ridley of Unthankwas theoldest son of Christopher and Anne, born about 1498 in Willmontswick, Northumberland, and he died in 1555. He married Isabel Heron in about 1511, in Willimontswick. She had been born about 1490 in Chipcase, Northumberland.\n\nMy 12th great-uncle was Nicholas Ridley\n\nHugh’s younger brother, Nicholas Ridley, was born about 1500 (or 1503), in Tyndale, Northumberland, and he died on October 16, 1555 in Oxford. I have told his story above.\n\nAnother 11th great-grandfather is known only as “Tiessen,” but he is a significant figure at the point where my English line merges into the Dutch one.\n\nIn this generation, a man known only as “Tiessen” shows up for the first time in our records, and all we know is that he was born about 1520 in either Belgium or the Netherlands. The important thing is that he was the father of Francis (Thijssen) Tiessen.\n\nGeneration 6\n\nHugh and Isabel (Heron) Ridley had two children that we know of:\n\nThomas Ridley was born about 1514 in Willmontswick, he married Elizabeth and he died some time after 1573.\n\nBaldwin Ridley.\n\nMy 10th great-grandfather was Baldwin Ridley\n\nBaldwin was born about 1545, in Willmontswick, Northumberland.\n\nAt some point in his life, he moved to Vlissingen, Zeeland, Netherlands. There he served as Bishop of the diocese of the English church which ministered to a large English community in that area, including the neighboring cities of Middleburg and Veere.\n\n[“Vlissingen was historically called ‘Flushing’ in English. In the 17th century Vlissingen was important enough to be a town that English speakers referred to and that had acquired its own English name. For example, Samuel Pepys referred to the town as ‘Flushing’ in his diaries. In 1673 Sir William Temple referred to Vlissingen as ‘Flushing’ once and ‘Flussingue’ twice in his book about the Netherlands. Some English writers in the Netherlands also used the Dutch name.” (Wikipedia)]\n\nUntil we discovered our English roots, through the Ridleys, I had always thought of my heritage as Dutch on my father’s side and Irish on my mother’s. I now realize, however, that my heritage was more varied, and that a lengthy English period occurred prior to the Dutch line, on my father’s side. Given the long line of English ancestors prior to this point, credit for our Dutch history goes to Baldwin Ridley, whose church work had taken him to Vlissingen.\n\nAnother of my 10th great-grandfathers was Francis (Thijssen) Tiessen\n\nFrancis Tiessen was born in 1545, in Ghent, Oost-Vlaanderen, Belgium\n\nGeneration 7\n\nMy 9th great-grandmother was Apollonia Ridley\n\nAppolonia Ridley was the daughter of Baldwin. She was born in Vlissingen, Zeeland, the Netherlands, about 1570, and she died in 1640.\n\nMy 9th great-grandfather was Daniel Francis Tiessen\n\nApollonia Ridley married Daniel Francis (Thijssen/Tysson) Tiessen in Vlissingen, Zeeland, about 1590. He had been born in 1565, in Ghent, Oost-Vlaanderen, Belgium, as the son of Francis Thijssen, who had also been born in Ghent, in 1545. Francis and his family had fled from there to Vlissingen, in 1579, during the counter-revolution under Duke Alba, because he was a Protestant. Daniel died in 1647, in Vlissingen, Zeeland.\n\nGeneration 8\n\nDaniel Francis and Apollonia (Ridley) Tiessen had four children:\n\nDaniel R. Tiessen was born about 1590 in Vlissingen, Zeeland, and he died in 1647 in Goeteborg, Vasta Gotaland, Sweden.\n\nMartin Daniel Tiessen was born in 1598, in Vlissingen, Zeeland, he married Louwysa, and he died in Goeteborg, Sweden, in 1657.\n\nMartin is remembered particularly for his outstanding naval service. He was the Dutch vice-admiral at the Battle of Albrolhos (1631) and, when the fleet returned to the Netherlands in 1634, he became master-attendant and munitions-master at the Admiralty of Zeeland in Vlissingen. After the outbreak of the war between Sweden and Denmark, the Dutch-Swedish industrialist Louis De Geer equipped at his own expense a Dutch squadron under Martin Thijssen (Tiessen), in order to strengthen the Swedish navy. Tiessen then performed outstandingly in the joint Dutch and Swedish operation at the Battle of Fehmarn (1644), where the Dutch squadron took four Danish ships at an early stage in the battle. The Danish were soundly defeated. Tiessen then took the Dutch squadron back to Vlissingen, but he returned to Sweden in 1645, becoming Admiral of the naval command at Gothenburg, which he successfully held in face of a siege by Danish naval and ground forces. When the peace with Denmark was concluded, he commanded the naval force that escorted a Swedish trading expedition to Portugal, on the return voyage successfully fending off a Royal Navy squadron that demanded salute in the Channel. Tiessen remained in command at Gothenburg until his death on May 21, 1657, before which he had been raised to the Swedish nobility by Swedish Queen Christine in 1644. At that time he was named Baron Martin Ankerhelm (or Marten Anckarhielm). [Much of this information comes from Wikipedia]\n\nClawes Tiessen was born in 1603, in Vlissingen, Zeeland, and he died in Sweden.\n\nMy 8th great-grandfather was Francis Tiessen (b. ca. 1624)\n\nFrancis Tiessen was born about 1624, in Vlissingen, Zeeland, but he went back to England, perhaps because of connections dating back to the departure from England of his grandfather, Baldwin. He married Dorothy Callant, the daughter of Garrett Gerard Collent and Alice Coxe, on September 25, 1649, in Austin Friars Church in London. Dorothy had been born about 1630. Francis died in about 1699, in Hackney, London, and Dorothy died on August 11, 1703, in St. John’s, Hackney.\n\nIn 1666, Francis was made an elder in Austin Friars Church. In his will (made in 1690), he made bequests to the Church, and to its poor, and also to a church and some relatives in Vlissingen. “His fortune is unexplained but may have had American origins, in that he advanced money for French Protestant emigrants to Carolina, in 1698, and was later described as an agent for the Carolina proprietors. He left land in Antigua to his surviving son (who left the Bridge Plantation in Antigua to a younger son Samuel) together with property in London, where his house was in Philpot Lane, and in Middlesex and other counties.” [cited from The Tyssens: Lords of Hackney, by Tim Baker]\n\nIt is worthwhile to pause here for some comment on the Austin Friars Church in London, where Francis and Dorothy were married, because the church strikes me as an interesting meeting point between the English and Dutch lines in my family story. The Dutch Church, Austin Friars (Dutch: Nederlandse Kerk Londen), is a Reformed church in the Broad Street Ward, in London. Dating back to 1550, it is the oldest Dutch-language Protestant church in the world and, as such, it is known in The Netherlands as the mother church of all Dutch reformed churches.\n\nIt is located on the site of the 13th-century Augustinian friary, and the original building was granted to Protestant refugees for their church services in 1550, but it was destroyed during the London Blitz. The present church {seen in the picture inserted here, which is by John Salmon] was built between 1950 and 1954 and is a familiar landmark in the Broad Street Ward.\n\n“By 1570, the Dutch community was the largest group of expatriates in London, numbering 5,000 out of the 100,000 total population of the time. About half of the Dutch in London were Protestants who fled the Flemish Low Countries due to religious persecution. Others were skilled craftsmen, including brewers, tile makers, weavers, artists, printers and engravers, who came to England for economic opportunities. Engraver Martin Droeshout, famous for his 1623 portrait of William Shakespeare, was among the Flemish Protestant emigrants who arrived in London.\n\n“A century later, the arrival of William of Orange brought a second wave of Dutch emigrants to London. This second group included noblemen, bankers, courtiers, merchants, architects and artists.” [Wikipedia]\n\n“The church remains active today, with weekly Dutch-language church services, confirmation classes, and meetings for various groups. The church also does outreach to the Dutch community in London, including ministering to the elderly. The church is home to two other UK registered charities: The Netherlands Benevolent Society (NBS) and The Dutch Centre.
