Seamlessly collaborate on a single shared tree with as many family members as you like.\n\nFind Your Ancestors\n\nEveryone's related. Geni users have already created over 260 million profiles. Instead of repeating their research, you can share it and connect your trees together.\n\nConnect to New Relatives\n\nOur automatic tree matches let you discover cousins who are researching the same shared ancestors that you are. Connect to new relatives easily to collaborate and share research.\n\nStay Organized\n\nUpload and store your family photos, videos, records, and sources on Geni. We make it easy to organize them by person or event and to share them with your relatives.\n\nFamilies use Geni to work together on their shared family history, to stay in touch with family members, and be reminded of family birthdays and anniversaries.\n\nGeni users are very active in discussions, where topics range from collaboration to help for beginners. A wealth of genealogy knowledge is shared in the discussions, and this is a great place for new users to get a feel for what Geni can offer.\n\nOur Projects feature provides a workspace for genealogists with similar interests to collaborate, share learnings, and discuss challenges and discoveries. Projects can exist for specific lineages, surnames, broad interests, and much more.\n\nSurname pages allow users to quickly discover profiles, document, projects, or discussions where that surname is tagged. Surname pages are crowd-sourced, so every Geni member can contribute to the \"About\" text for any given surname.\n\nOur frequently updated blog is a portal for learning about new features on Geni, discovering interesting profiles and projects, and getting to know notable members of the Geni community. Follow the blog by subscribing via RSS, liking Geni on Facebook, or following Geni on X.com."
