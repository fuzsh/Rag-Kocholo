Oct. 19, 1928, Wiesbaden, Germany), queen's commissioner of Groningen (1892-1917); son of Johan Herman Geertsema Carelszoon.\n\nGeertsema, Molly, byname of Willem Jacob Geertsema (b.

June 27, 1991, Wassenaar, Netherlands), a deputy prime minister and interior minister of the Netherlands (1971-73) and queen's commissioner of Gelderland (1973-83); grandnephew of Carel Coenraad Geertsema.

Sept. 19, 1806, Anse-à-Veau, Haiti - d. Feb. 11, 1879, Kingston, Jamaica), president of Haiti (1859-67). He was a high-ranking officer in the Haitian army, commanding a division of the expeditionary army against the Dominicans in 1844. After Pres. Faustin Soulouque proclaimed himself emperor (Faustin I) in 1849, he created Geffrard duke. But Geffrard disassociated himself from Soulouque's dictatorial regime. After earning the trust of the people, he proclaimed himself leader of the republic in Gonaïves, causing Soulouque to abdicate. As president, Geffrard reinstated order and tranquillity after the upheaval and terror of Soulouque. Geffrard is known for creating a new constitution, based on Alexandre Pétion's 1816 document, which primarily improved transportation and education. He helped restore ties with the Vatican, which had been strained since the revolutionary period. By signing a concordat with the Vatican in 1860, he expanded the domain of the Catholic Church in Haiti. The agreement contributed to the development of parochial schools, led by predominantly foreign-born clergy members. He also concluded treaties of commerce with France, Britain, and Spain. In 1861 his government became very unpopular, he being accused of subserviency to Spain, for not opposing the occupation of Santo Domingo by that power, and thereafter there were repeated revolts, particularly under the generals Léon Legros, Aimé Legros, and Sylvain Salnave. In 1866 he promulgated liberal laws but discontent among the elite and the rural piquets (peasants who were descendants of slaves) remained, eventually forcing him out of office in favour of Salnave.\n\nGegeshidze, Georgy (Andreyevich) (b. 1924, Khashuri, Georgian S.S.R. - d. 1971), first secretary of the Communist Party committee of the Abkhaz A.S.S.R. (1953-55). He was also first secretary of the party committees of Rustavi city (19...-52) and Tbilisi city (1956-61) and mayor of Tbilisi (1953).\n\nGeghamyan\n\nGeghamyan, Artashes (Mamikoni) (b. Dec. 2, 1949, Yerevan, Armenian S.S.R.), Armenian politician. During 1979-86, he held various posts at the Council of the Communist Party of Armenia. During 1987-89, he was the first secretary of the Mashtotz District Council of the Communist Party. In 1989-90, he was mayor of Yerevan. In 1990, he quit the Communist Party. In 1995, he was elected to the National Assembly (parliament) of Armenia. In April 1997, he founded the National Unity party, which in February 1998 at its extraordinary session proposed Geghamyan as a candidate for that year's presidential elections. He won only 0.4% of the vote in that election. He was again presidential candidate in 2003 (16.9% of the vote) and 2008 (0.5%).\n\nGegus, Gusztáv (b. Oct. 5, 1855, Pilismarót, Hungary - d.

Sept. 14, 1953, Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, West Germany), minister-president of Gross-Hessen (1945-47).\n\nGeingob, Hage (Gottfried) (b.

Sept. 12, 1996, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), president of Brazil (1974-79); brother of Orlando Geisel. A career army officer, he joined the military coup led by Getúlio Vargas that overthrew the elected government and installed a dictatorship in 1930. Geisel supported Vargas for 15 years, serving in a variety of military and civil administrative posts, but in 1945 he played an important part in overthrowing Vargas. During the next 15 years he held several important offices, including deputy chief of the military staff of the presidency and military representative to the National Petroleum Council, gaining a reputation for incisive leadership. He participated in the 1964 military coup that toppled Pres. João Goulart, became chief of Pres. Humberto Castelo Branco's military staff, and was promoted to general in 1966. In 1969-73 he was president of Petrobrás, the national oil corporation. Placed in the president's seat by the military oligarchy (March 15, 1974), he risked their opposition by beginning a gradual liberalization and demilitarization of the government, permitting open legislative elections in 1974, meeting with opposition leaders, and relaxing censorship. He outlined a new economic policy, \"pragmatic nationalism,\" which called for shifting emphasis from exports to the development of domestic industry. Although there had been some indication that he might be succeeded by an elected civilian president, he and his conservative supporters saw that they would be defeated in open elections. Accordingly, he took no further steps toward democratization, and official repression of the political opposition increased in 1977. He did not run for reelection in 1979 but supported Gen. João Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo, his successor as president. In 2018 a CIA memo revealed that he personally approved the summary execution of \"subversives.\"\n\n1 Year of birth was altered to 1908 to meet age limit for admission to military academy; this falsification was only publicly disclosed on the occasion of his 80th birthday.\n\nGeisel, Orlando (b. Sept. 5, 1905, Estrela, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil - d. May 30, 1979, Brasília, Brazil), army minister of Brazil (1969-74).\n\nGeithner, Timothy (Franz) (b. Aug. 18, 1961, New York City), U.S. treasury secretary (2009-13).\n\nGekht, Irina (Alfredovna) (b. Nov. 30, 1969), chairman of the government of Zaporozhye oblast (2024- ).\n\nGelder\n\nGelling\n\nGelder, Wim van, byname of Willem Teunis van Gelder (b. Jan. 21, 1942, Amsterdam, Netherlands), queen's commissioner of Zeeland (1992-2007).\n\nGeldimyradov, Khojamyrat, Turkmen Hojamyrat Geldimyradow (b. 1965, in present Akhal velayat, Turkmenistan), economy and finance minister (2007-08) and finance minister (2008) of Turkmenistan. He has also been a deputy prime minister (2008-09, 2022- ) and rector of the Turkmen State Institute of Economics and Management (2020-22).\n\nGeldiniyazov, Mammetmyrat, Turkmen Mämmetmyrat Geldinyýazow (b. 1971, Dzhebel, Turkmen S.S.R. [now in Balkan velayat, Turkmenistan]), a deputy prime minister of Turkmenistan (2020-21). He was also minister of education (2018-20).\n\nGelling, Donald (James) (b. July 5, 1938, Santon, Isle of Man), chief minister of the Isle of Man (1996-2001, 2004-06).\n\nA. Gemayel\n\nGemayel, Amin (Pierre), Arabic Amin Butrus al-Jumayyil (b. Jan. 22, 1942, Bikfaya, Lebanon), president of Lebanon (1982-88); son of Pierre Gemayel. He oversaw the Phalangist Party's vast business interests while his brother Bashir led the party's militia. He was co-founder of the rightist French-language daily newspaper Le Réveil. In contrast to his warlike brother, Amin showed himself to be conciliatory toward the other religious groups in Lebanon. He was first elected to parliament on the death of his uncle in 1970. When the civil war broke out, he fought and was injured when the jeep he was driving came under attack. During the Israeli siege of Beirut in 1982 he crossed the front line for meetings with Palestinian leaders at a time of great tension between the two sides of the divided city, an act that would have been unthinkable for Bashir. Amin was elected president of Lebanon a week after Bashir died. As president, the ineffective Amin proved no more successful than his predecessors in securing an agreement between Lebanon's warring groups that would end the country's civil war. From 1990 to July 2000, he resided in Paris as a self-exiled leader of the opposition.\n\nB. Gemayel\n\nGemayel, Bashir (Pierre), Arabic Bashir Butrus al-Jumayyil (b. Nov. 10, 1947, Bikfaya, Lebanon - d. Sept. 14, 1982, Beirut, Lebanon), Lebanese politician; son of Pierre Gemayel. He emerged during the fighting of the late 1970s as the able and ruthless leader of the Phalangist militia. He was believed to be responsible for the 1978 killing of Tony Franjieh, son of former president Suleiman Franjieh. He unified the military forces of the Maronite community in 1980 after launching several murderous surprise attacks on rival Christian militias. He formally took over control of the Phalangist Party from his father in 1980. He was elected president of Lebanon by the parliament on Aug. 23, 1982, in the face of opposition by many of the country's Muslims, who disliked his close association with sectarian violence. He was assassinated in a bomb explosion 10 days before he was due to take office.\n\nGemayel, Maurice (b. April 25, 1910, Mansoura, Egypt - d. Oct. 31, 1970, Beirut, Lebanon), Lebanese politician; cousin of Pierre Gemayel (1905-1984). He was minister of state in charge of finance (1960-61) and minister of planning (1969-70).\n\nP. Gemayel\n\n(1905-84)\n\nGemayel, (Sheikh) Pierre (Amin), Arabic Butrus Amin al-Jumayyil (b. Nov. 6, 1905, Bikfaya, Lebanon - d. Aug. 29, 1984, Bikfaya), Lebanese politician. He was born into a Christian family already powerful in the region immediately north of Beirut. He went to the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936 as captain of the Lebanese football (soccer) team. He was so impressed by the spirit and discipline of Nazi youth groups that on his return to Lebanon he helped found the right-wing authoritarian youth movement called the Phalange. He became the leader of the Phalange Party in 1937, retaining that position until 1980. This party became the political arm of the largest Christian community in Lebanon, the Maronites. He joined the forces of Fouad Chehab against those of Camille Chamoun when a rebellion broke out in 1958, led by former prime minister Saeb Salam. Gemayel was first elected to the Lebanese parliament in 1960. He was minister of public health (1958-60, 1961, 1968-69, 1984), public works, education, and agriculture (1958-60), finance (1960-61, 1968, 1969), interior (1966, 1968-69), tourism (1968-69), and posts and communications (1968-69, 1984). He ran unsuccessfully for the presidency (which was traditionally held by a Christian) in 1964 and 1970. It was the Phalangist militia that started the 1975 civil war with a massacre of Palestinians. He was instrumental in creating a large, militarily secure Christian enclave north of Beirut and became Lebanon's preeminent Christian political chieftain.\n\nP.

March 21, 1927, Reideburg [now part of Halle, Sachsen-Anhalt], Germany - d. March 31, 2016, Wachtberg, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany), German politician. During World War II he was drafted into the German armed services and was a prisoner of war at war's end. After his release he settled in what became East Germany, but in 1952 he fled to the West and soon joined the Free Democratic Party (FDP), rising quickly in its official ranks in Bremen. In 1965 he was elected to the Bundestag as a deputy for North Rhine-Westphalia. Beginning in 1969, the Free Democrats gave their support to the dominant Social Democrats in a coalition government, and Genscher became minister of the interior. Five years later he won the chairmanship of his party and the foreign ministry in the government. In 1982 the Free Democrats left the coalition with the Social Democrats and switched their allegiance to the Christian Democrats, who took over the government; Genscher then continued as foreign minister. He resigned as FDP chairman in 1985. Genscher strongly favoured better relations with the Soviet Union and the old eastern bloc and, after Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, insisted that the West should take advantage of the historic opportunities for détente. In 1989-90 he worked vigorously for German reunification and became the first foreign minister of the unified Germany until resigning in 1992.\n\nGent, Sir (Gerard) Edward (James) (b.

On Jan. 23, 1899, he was named commissioner of the Shari region and he was one of the leaders of the campaign against the Muslim leader Rabih az-Zubayr (killed April 22, 1900). Gentil was then installed at Fort-Lamy on May 29, 1900, and left there on August 25 and quit Fort-de-Possel (in the present Central African Republic, which was part of the Chad territory organized on Sept. 5, 1900) on Jan. 2, 1901, remaining titular commissioner until July 2, 1902. Thereafter he was chief administrator of Middle Congo (1902-06) and commissioner-general of French Congo (1904-08). Gabon's second-largest city, Port-Gentil, is named for him.\n\nGentile, Giovanni (b. May 30, 1875, Castelvetrano, Sicily, Italy - d.

June 7 [May 28, O.S.], 1660, Osnabrück, Hanover [Germany] - d. June 22, 1727, Osnabrück), elector of Hanover (1698-1727) and king of Great Britain and Ireland (1714-27).\n\nGeorge II, in full George Augustus, German Georg August (b. Nov. 9 [Oct. 30, O.S.], 1683, Herrenhausen Palace, Hanover [Germany] - d. Oct. 25, 1760, London, England), king of Great Britain and Ireland and elector of Hanover (1727-60); son of George I.\n\nGeorge III\n\nGeorge III, in full George William Frederick, German Georg Wilhelm Friedrich (b. June 4 [May 24, O.S.], 1738, London, England - d. Jan. 29, 1820, Windsor Castle, near London), king of Great Britain and Ireland (1760-1801) and of the United Kingdom (1801-20), elector (1760-1814) and king (1814-20) of Hanover, and king of Corsica (1794-96). He was the son of Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. On his accession he sought to rule without regard to party, to banish corruption from political practice, and to abandon the Hanoverian preoccupations of his predecessors. However, the chief minister chosen to implement his new system of politics, John Stuart, Earl of Bute, was an unpracticed politician who merely succeeded in disrupting the established politics of the day without creating a viable alternative. The result was 10 years of ministerial instability and public controversy, which ended only in 1770 with the appointment of Lord North, an able and congenial minister. George was a strong supporter of the war against America, and he viewed the concession of independence in 1783 with such detestation that he considered abdicating his throne. At the same time he fought a bitter personal feud with the Whig leader Charles James Fox, and his personal intervention brought the fall of the Fox-North ministry in 1783. He then found another minister, William Pitt the Younger, who suited him. Even as late as 1801 he preferred, however, to force Pitt to resign rather than permit Catholic emancipation, a measure that he interpreted as contrary to his coronation oath to uphold the Church of England. After 1801 his recurring bouts of insanity became a political problem and ultimately compelled him to submit to the establishment of a formal regency in 1811. The regent was his oldest son, the future George IV.\n\nGeorge IV\n\nGeorge IV, in full George Augustus Frederick, German Georg August Friedrich (b. Aug. 12, 1762, London, England - d. June 26, 1830, Windsor, Berkshire, England), king of the United Kingdom and of Hanover (1820-30). He was the eldest son of George III and Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In November 1810 George III became permanently insane, and shortly afterward the prince became regent under the terms of the Regency Act (1811). In February 1812, when the restrictions of that statute expired, George decided to retain his father's ministers rather than appoint survivors from among his old Whig friends. His decision benefited the nation, because leading Whigs were prepared to abandon the war with France and leave Napoleon the master of the European continent. As it was, Great Britain and its allies finally triumphed over Napoleon in 1815. George IV's accession on the death of his father did not add to the powers that he had possessed as regent. He insulted and intrigued against the 2nd Earl of Liverpool, prime minister from 1820 to 1827. George Canning, who became foreign secretary in 1822 and prime minister in 1827, won George's approval, partly by cultivating the friendship of Sir William Knighton, the king's physician and keeper of the privy purse, on whose advice George relied excessively. But after 1827 he ceased to have any personal weight with either of the two great parties.\n\nGeorge V\n\nGeorge V, in full George Frederick Ernest Albert (b. June 3, 1865, London, England - d. Jan. 20, 1936, Sandringham, Norfolk, England), king of the United Kingdom (1910-36). He was the second son of Prince Albert Edward, later King Edward VII. He became Duke of Cornwall and was created Prince of Wales after his father's accession in 1901, succeeded his father on May 6, 1910, and was crowned on June 22, 1911. Formidable difficulties faced the new king early in his reign. The constitutional struggle to curb the power of the House of Lords was unresolved, and the Liberal government secured an undertaking from the king that, should the lords not yield, he would create sufficient new peers to overcome the opposition. After the Liberal success in the election of December 1910, the House of Lords relented and passed the Parliament Act (1911), and the king did not have to fulfill his pledge. Respect for George greatly increased during World War I, and he visited the front in France several times. In 1917, George changed the name of his house from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor. After World War I the king was confronted by an outbreak of serious industrial unrest. He was also faced with a difficult decision on the resignation of Bonar Law in 1923, when he had to find a new prime minister. Both Lord Curzon and Stanley Baldwin had supporters among the elder statesmen whom George consulted, but, believing Baldwin had more support in the Conservative Party and that the prime minister should be in the House of Commons, the king selected him. When the Labour administration split in 1931, he persuaded Ramsay MacDonald and a part of his cabinet to remain in office and join with Conservative and Liberal ministers in the formation of a national coalition government.\n\nGeorge VI\n\nGeorge VI, also called (1920-36) Prince Albert, Duke of York, in full Albert Frederick Arthur George (b. Dec. 14, 1895, York cottage, Sandringham, Norfolk, England - d. Feb. 6, 1952, Sandringham), king of the United Kingdom (1936-52). He was the second son of the future king George V. On April 26, 1923, he was married to Lady Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon (1900-2002), youngest daughter of the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. They had two children: Princess Elizabeth (afterward Queen Elizabeth II) and Princess Margaret (afterward Countess of Snowdon). He was officially proclaimed king on Dec. 12, 1936, following the abdication of his brother Edward VIII. He was crowned on May 12, 1937. Before the outbreak of World War II, he affirmed Anglo-French solidarity and formed a close friendship with U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt, but he supported Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's \"appeasement\" policy toward Germany and Italy. In May 1940, when the House of Commons forced Chamberlain to resign, the king wished to appoint Edward Halifax (later 1st Earl of Halifax) to the premiership but was induced to select Winston Churchill, whose wartime leadership he then supported unreservedly. During the war he visited his armies on several battle fronts. Although he had ceased to be emperor of India when India and Pakistan became separate independent countries, he was formally recognized, on April 27, 1949, as head of the Commonwealth of Nations by the governments of its member states. Although he was an important symbolic leader of the British people during World War II, his reign was perhaps most important for the accelerating evolution of the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations and the postwar transformation of Britain into a welfare state.\n\nAmbrose George\n\nAndrew George\n\nGeorge, Ambrose (Vincent), finance minister of Dominica (2000-01). He was sent on leave in December 2001, pending the results of a government investigation into his alleged involvement with a local businessman who faced money laundering charges in the United States. As a result it was announced that there was no credible evidence linking George with money laundering. However, Prime Minister Pierre Charles assumed responsibility for finance and switched George to head the Ministry of Industry, Physical Planning and Enterprise Development. In 2004 he became minister of agriculture and environment, in 2005 minister of public works and public utilities, and in 2007 minister of public works and infrastructural development. In 2008 he was dropped from the cabinet following allegations of his involvement in various Internet scams. In 2010, however, he was reappointed as minister for information, telecommunication, and constituency empowerment. He lost his seat in the 2014 elections.\n\nGeorge, Andrew (Neil) (b. Oct. 9, 1952), governor of Anguilla (2006-09). He was also British ambassador to Paraguay (1998-2001).\n\nGeorge, Bode, byname of Olabode Ibiyinka George (b. Nov. 21, 1945, Lagos, Nigeria), governor of Ondo (1988-90).\n\nGeorge, Geraldine (Janet), acting defense minister of Liberia (2024- ).\n\nH. George\n\nGeorge, Henry (b. Sept. 2, 1839, Philadelphia, Pa. - d. Oct. 29, 1897, New York City), U.S. political figure. He took part in Democratic Party politics in California until 1880. There he was struck by the large tracts of land which had been freely and even recklessly granted to railway companies and other corporations. Meditating on the evils produced by those monopolies, he came to believe that the root of the social maladies of his time was the individual ownership of land. The result of his reflections was his book Progress and Poverty (1879), which had an enormous sale and was translated into many languages. Its vogue was enhanced by his pamphlets, his frequent contributions to magazines, and his lecture tours in both the United States and the British Isles. His central proposal was the \"single tax\" on land: \"What man has produced belongs to the individual producer; what God has created belongs equally to all men... therefore abolish all taxation save on the value of land.\" In 1886 he ran for mayor of New York City for the United Labor Party; he was defeated, although he ran ahead of Theodore Roosevelt. He also wrote much on free trade, stating that cause with much clearness and eloquence in his book Protection or Free Trade. In 1897 on the creation of Greater New York he became again the candidate of the labour organizations to oppose Tammany Hall. But the incessant exertions of writing, travelling, and speaking had greatly enfeebled him. He died four days before the election. The Georgist movement then declined, although it still has its adherents today. Internationally it had the most success in Denmark, where a Georgist party (Retsforbund) was long represented in parliament (1926-60, 1973-75, 1977-81) and once participated in a coalition government (1957-60). His son Henry George, Jr., was a U.S. congressman (1911-15).\n\nGeorge, Hywel (b. May 10, 1924, Holyhead, Anglesey, Wales), administrator (1967-69) and governor (1969-70) of Saint Vincent.\n\nGeorge, Norman (b. July 2, 1946, Atiu, Cook Islands), foreign minister (1984-89) and deputy prime minister (1999-2001) of the Cook Islands. He was also speaker of parliament (2004-06), being elected as such on Dec. 14, 2004, though he had lost his seat on Atiu in the 2004 general elections. He was returned to parliament in a by-election held on June 8, 2006.\n\nGeorge, Sir Robert (Allingham) (b. July 25, 1896, Cromarty, Scotland - d. [road accident] Sept. 13, 1967, London, England), governor of South Australia (1953-60); knighted 1952.\n\nGeorge, Yosiwo P(alikkun) (b. July 24, 1941, Malem, Kusaie [now Kosrae], Micronesia [now in Federated States of Micronesia] - d. Aug. 13, 2022), governor of Kosrae (1983-91) and vice president of the Federated States of Micronesia (2015-22). He was also permanent representative to the United Nations (1992-95) and ambassador to the United States (2008-12) and Israel (2010-14).\n\nGeorge-Brown, George Alfred George-Brown, Baron, original name George Alfred Brown (b. Sept. 2, 1914, London, England - d. June 2, 1985, Cornwall, England), British politician. He became full-time organizer in North London for the Transport and General Workers' Union and, as its nominee, won (1945) the parliamentary seat of Belper, Derbyshire. After serving as parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (1947-51), he became minister of works (1951). He served as deputy leader of the Labour Party (1960-70), but despite having defeated Harold Wilson in the 1961 and 1962 elections for the party's deputy leadership, he lost to Wilson when a new leader was chosen after Hugh Gaitskell's death (1963). Heading the newly created (and short-lived) Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), he faced balance of payments problems and hostility from the Treasury, on whose ground the DEA impinged. Brown's position became untenable when in a 1966 crisis Wilson took Treasury rather than DEA advice. As foreign secretary (1966-68) Brown made a strenuous but unsuccessful effort (1967) to achieve for Britain membership in the European Communities. He resigned on an impulse when he was not consulted on an urgent decision. He lost his House of Commons seat in 1970 and was created a life peer, changing his surname from Brown to George-Brown by deed poll. He resigned from the Labour Party in 1976 and was a founder-member (1981) of the Social Democratic Party.\n\nGeorge Tupou I, formerly Siaosi Taufa'ahau Tupou Maeakafa (b. 1797, Lifuka island?, Ha'apai, Tonga - d. Feb. 18, 1893, Nuku'alofa, Tonga), Tu'i Kanokupolu (1845-75) and king (1875-93) of Tonga; son of Tupouto'a.\n\nGeorge Tupou II\n\nGeorge Tupou II (b. June 18, 1874, Neiafu, Vava'u, Tonga - d.

March 18, 2012, Hong Kong, China), king of Tonga (2006-12); son of Taufa'ahau Tupou IV. He was an Oxford University graduate and completed three years' study at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. He spent 28 years working for the government after joining the civil service in 1970, and was appointed the first head of the foreign affairs ministry in 1979. The unmarried crown prince, then known as Tupouto'a, resigned from his position as minister of foreign affairs and defense in 1998. He also retired from the chair of Tonga's electric power board, its water board, and its tourism board. Tupouto'a's business interests ranged from a fishing company to brewing. Succeeding his late father as king in 2006, his coronation was postponed after rioting over political reform left eight people dead and the centre of the capital, Nuku'alofa, virtually burned to the ground. Days before his coronation in 2008, he announced that he was \"voluntarily surrendering his powers to meet the democratic aspirations of many of his people,\" leaving day-to-day affairs in charge of the prime minister.\n\nGeorge-Wout\n\nGeorge-Wout, Lucille (Andrea) (b.

Dec. 24, 1845, Copenhagen, Denmark - d. March 18, 1913, Salonika [now Thessaloniki], Greece), king of Greece (1863-1913). The second son of King Christian IX of Denmark and the brother of Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, he was nominated to the Greek throne by Britain, France, and Russia after the first Greek king, Othon, was deposed in 1862. The National Assembly accepted Vilhelm as king of the Hellenes in March 1863, and he ascended the throne as Georgios I on October 31. In 1867 he married the Grand Duchess Olga Konstantinovna of Russia. Although the early years of his reign were dominated by his harsh and unpopular adviser Count Sponneck, who was obliged to return to Denmark in 1877, he refrained from transgressing the prerogatives of the National Assembly and became one of the most successful constitutional monarchs in Europe. While taking a walk he was shot and killed by a man named Alexandros Skinas, who apparently had no political motives.\n\nGeorgios II\n\nGeorgios II (b. July 20, 1890, Tatoi, near Athens, Greece - d. April 1, 1947, Athens), king of Greece (1922-24, 1935-47). The eldest son of King Konstantinos I, he was excluded from the succession during World War I for his allegedly pro-German sympathies, but he came to the throne when his father was deposed by Gen. Nikolaos Plastiras in September 1922. Feeling ran high against the royal family, however, and, after a royalist coup d'état had been suppressed in October 1923, Georgios felt compelled to leave Greece on December 19 with his queen, Elizabeth. In March 1924 the Greek National Assembly voted the end of the monarchy and proclaimed Greece a republic. The king remained in exile until the conservative Populist Party, with the support of the army, gained control of the Assembly and declared the restoration of the monarchy in October 1935; a plebiscite, which was most probably manipulated by the prime minister, Gen. Georgios Kondylis, was held in November in an effort to demonstrate that the great majority of the people favoured his return. In 1936 Gen. Ioannis Metaxas seized power after asserting that the nation was on the verge of being taken over by the Communists. The king's support of Metaxas put the throne in a controversial position, particularly after Metaxas banned political parties, dissolved parliament, suspended constitutional rights, and even decreed the censorship of Pericles' great funeral oration to the Athenians as recorded by Thucydides. The king was forced into exile after the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, going first to Crete, then to Alexandria, and finally to London. After the war republican sentiments again threatened his throne, but he was restored by a plebiscite supervised by the Allies and returned to Greece in 1946.\n\nGeorgy, Guy (Noël) (b. Nov. 17, 1918, Paris, France - d. July 9, 2003, Paris), high commissioner of Middle Congo (1959-60). He was also ambassador to Bolivia (1961-64), Dahomey (1964-69), Libya (1969-75), Iran (1980-82), and Algeria (1982-84).\n\nGephardt\n\nGephardt, Richard (Andrew), byname Dick Gephardt (b. Jan. 31, 1941, St. Louis, Mo.), U.S. politician. He served on the St. Louis Board of Aldermen (1971-77), and in 1976 ran successfully for Congress, portraying himself as a new kind of moderate Democrat. In 2002 he won the seat for the 14th time. In 1985 he helped form the Democratic Leadership Council, the group of moderates that was a spawning ground for such national leaders as Bill Clinton. Gephardt shot to national prominence in 1988 when he won the Iowa caucus and finished second in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary. But he withdrew from the race after Super Tuesday, when he captured only one of 21 events - the primary in his home state. House Democrats picked Gephardt as the majority leader, the No. 2 position in the House, in 1989, ushering in what they hoped would be a better image for the party after controversy that led to the resignation of Speaker Jim Wright. Gephardt was the next Democrat in line to succeed Tom Foley of Washington as speaker, and Foley was defeated in the 1994 election. But so were a lot of Democrats, and Gephardt had the unhappy chore of handing the gavel to Newt Gingrich, head of the new majority Republicans, who became speaker, officially ending 40 years of Democratic control over the House. As Democratic leader Gephardt worked closely with the White House to promote its failed attempt to establish a national health care system, and he has been a stalwart supporter of campaign finance reform, increases in the minimum wage, and efforts to save Social Security. But he was at odds with the White House in 1993 in opposing the North American Free Trade Agreement. He has voted to ban a kind of late-term abortion; President Clinton vetoed the ban. In 2004 he again ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, but dropped out after coming fourth in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nGerapetritis\n\nGerapetritis, Giorgos (b. 1967, Menetes, Karpathos island, Greece), foreign minister of Greece (2023- ).

He was active in trade union affairs before he was elected to the Oslo town council in 1932. He became secretary of the Labour Party in 1934 and mayor of Oslo in 1940 but was dismissed later that year by the German occupying forces. Arrested by the Gestapo in 1941 because of his resistance to the occupation, he spent three and a half years in prisons and concentration camps. On his liberation in 1945 he returned to his post as mayor of Oslo. He became leader of the Labour Party and was asked to form a coalition government, which launched a campaign to repair the damage and divisions of the war years. Labour won a majority in the 1945 general elections and could then govern alone. Despite the Marxist and antimilitarist leanings of his youth, Gerhardsen brought Norway into NATO in 1949 and resisted Soviet attempts in 1964 to weaken Norway's commitment. Throughout his career he endeavoured to further East-West détente, and he established Norway's opposition to foreign bases and nuclear weapons. His policies, sometimes controversial abroad, gained support at home. In 1965 the Labour Party was defeated at the polls and he stepped down as party chairman, but he remained a prominent figure in Norwegian politics and served as a member of parliament until he retired in 1969.\n\nGericke van Herwijnen, Johan Eberhard Paul Ernst (b.

The Republican was elected to the state legislature in 1982. Gov. Mike Sullivan could probably have won a third term in 1994, but he ran for the Senate instead. Secretary of State Kathy Karpan was the obvious Democratic nominee, and in another year might well have won. Instead, the key contest was the Republican primary, won by Geringer. In the anti-Clinton atmosphere of November 1994, he easily prevailed over Karpan, carrying all but one county. Geringer complained of \"the increasing imbalance of power between federal and state governments\" and wanted to give life to the 10th Amendment which reserves to the states powers not delegated to the federal government. He called for Wyoming to use its mineral resources and low taxes to build a more diversified, higher-tech economy.\n\nGerlach, Manfred (b. May 8, 1928, Leipzig, Germany - d.

After his pro-Soviet broadcast on Oct. 23, 1956, large crowds gathered to protest the oppression of the Hungarian people by the Hungarian and Soviet regimes. Gerö, who was unable to crush the rebellion, called in Soviet troops who fired on the demonstrators.

Although Gerö was initially believed to have been killed by rebels in Budapest, he escaped into exile.\n\nGeroulanos, Pavlos (Marinou) (b.

March 21, 1912, Mecca [now in Saudi Arabia] - d. April 4, 1939, Baghdad, Iraq), king of Iraq (1933-39); son of Faysal I. Like all the scions of the Sharifian family, he had to spend some of his early years among the nomad tribes of the desert. While not yet in his teens he was taken, in 1921, to Baghdad, where his father had been chosen to rule. Four years later he was sent by Faysal to England to pursue his studies at Harrow. In 1928 he was recalled to Baghdad to study at the Military Academy. He showed little disposition to meddle in internal politics; his friends were not among the politicians, and except on the most important occasions, particularly those which inaugurated the material advancement of his country, such as the opening of oil pipelines or of barrages, he did not trouble to conceal his lack of interest in public affairs. Only once did he immerse himself in a major way in the manoeuvres of politicians in Baghdad. This was on the occasion of the famous coup of Gen. Bakir Sidki, who sent planes over the capital and actually dropped a few bombs in order to show the cabinet of Yasin al-Hashimi that he was in earnest. To this coup the young king was unquestionably privy, and of his approval of it there is no doubt. In the end opposition to Ghazi grew among all sections of the community in Iraq. The townspeople did not share in his delight in fast motor cars and planes, and of the tribesmen he took little notice. This conduct was in great contrast to his father, who assiduously cultivated the friendship and the respect of both townsmen and tribesmen. Ghazi died from injuries received in an accident when the car he was driving struck an electric-light standard.\n\nGhazzi, Said al-, Arabic Sa`id al-Ghazzi (b. 1893, Damascus, Syria - d.

Having become a revolutionary after World War I, he joined the then-outlawed Romanian Communist Party in 1930 and was sentenced to 12 years' hard labour for his role in the Grivita railwaymen's strike of 1933. He escaped prison in August 1944, the same month an anti-Fascist coup brought Romania into the war against Germany. He became minister of communications in the first liberation cabinet (1944-45) and played an instrumental role in forcing Prime Minister Nicolae Radescu out of office and establishing a Communist-dominated government (early 1945). He was elected secretary-general of the Communist Party in October 1945. He was also minister of public works and communications (1945-46), national economy (1946-47), and industry and commerce (1947-48) and first deputy premier (1948-52). In 1952, after purging the party of his rivals, who had been closely identified with Soviet leaders and policies, he became premier. He gradually adopted economic and foreign policies that served Romania's national interests rather than those of international socialism as defined by the Soviet leaders. He resigned as prime minister in 1955 but assumed the position of president of the State Council in 1961. Following an even more determined independent course, he overcame the objections of the other Soviet-bloc countries, which wanted Romania's economy to remain primarily agricultural, and pursued a far-reaching program of industrialization in 1964. In the mid-1960s he also demonstrated Romania's independence from Soviet domination by forming cordial relations with non-Communist nations and with China, which had become increasingly alienated from the Soviet Union.\n\nN.

In that capacity he quickly earned the dislike of many who had supported the revolution, particularly those on the left, by his authoritarian use of censorship to impose an \"Islamic\" line on the programmes and to suppress reports of views differing from Khomeini's - for instance, those favouring women's rights. During the crisis caused by the detention of U.S. hostages following the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Ghotbzadeh was appointed foreign minister (November 1979). Though his efforts to resolve the situation were viewed as sincere, he finally resigned (August 1980) over the deadlock in negotiations. Less than three months later, on Nov. 7, 1980, he was arrested after criticizing the Islamic Republican Party; he was released on November 10 but after that played no further part in public life. He was arrested again in April 1982 and accused of plotting against the regime. He apparently admitted complicity with Ayatollah Kazem Shariat-Madari in a plot against the government, but denied any conspiracy to take Khomeini's life. He was executed by a firing squad.\n\nGhozali\n\nGhozali, Sid Ahmed, Arabic Sid Ahmad Ghuzali (b.
