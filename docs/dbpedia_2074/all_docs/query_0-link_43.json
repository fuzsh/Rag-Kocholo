        "text": "George Timothy Clooney was born on May 6, 1961, in Lexington, Kentucky, to Nina Bruce (née Warren), a former beauty pageant queen, and Nick Clooney, a former anchorman and television host (who was also the brother of singer Rosemary Clooney). He has Irish, English, and German ancestry. Clooney spent most of his youth in Ohio and Kentucky, and graduated from Augusta High School. He was very active in sports such as basketball and baseball, and tried out for the Cincinnati Reds, but was not offered a contract.\n\nAfter his cousin, Miguel Ferrer, got him a small role in a feature film, Clooney began to pursue acting. His first major role was on the sitcom E/R (1984) as Ace. More roles soon followed, including George Burnett, the handsome handyman on The Facts of Life (1979); Booker Brooks, a supervisor on Roseanne (1988); and Detective James Falconer on Ein Strauß Töchter (1991). Clooney had his breakthrough when he was cast as Dr. Doug Ross on the award-winning drama series Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994), opposite Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle and Julianna Margulies.\n\nWhile filming \"ER\" (1994), Clooney starred in a number of high profile film roles, such as Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), and Tage wie dieser... (1996), opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. In 1997, Clooney took on the role of Batman in Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin (1997). The film was a moderate success in the box office, but was slammed by critics, notably for the nipple-laden Batsuit. Clooney went on to star in Steven Soderbergh's Out of Sight (1998), Terrence Malick's Der schmale Grat (1998), and David O. Russell's Three Kings - Es ist schön König zu sein (1999).\n\nIn 1999, Clooney left \"ER\" (1994) (though he would return for the season finale) and appeared in a number of films, including O Brother, Where Art Thou? - Eine Mississippi-Odyssee (2000), Der Sturm (2000) and Ocean's Eleven (2001). Collaborating once again with Steven Soderbergh, Ocean's Eleven (2001) received critical acclaim, earned more than $450 million at the box office, and spawned two sequels: Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's 13 (2007).\n\nIn 2002, Clooney made his directorial debut with Geständnisse - Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), an adaptation of TV producer Chuck Barris' autobiography. This was the first film under the banner of Section Eight Productions, a production company he founded with Steven Soderbergh. The company also produced many acclaimed films, including Dem Himmel so fern (2002), Syriana (2005), A Scanner Darkly - Der dunkle Schirm (2006) and Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005). Clooney won his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Syriana (2005), and was nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005).\n\nIn 2006, Section Eight Productions was shut down so that Soderbergh could concentrate on directing, and Clooney founded a new production company, Smokehouse Productions, with his friend and longtime business partner, Grant Heslov.\n\nClooney went on to produce and star in Michael Clayton (2007) (which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor), directed and starred in Ein verlockendes Spiel (2008), and took leading roles in Burn After Reading (2008), Männer, die auf Ziegen starren (2009), Der fantastische Mr. Fox (2009), and Jason Reitman's Up in the Air (2009). Clooney received critical acclaim for his performance in Up in the Air (2009) and was nominated for several awards, including a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award. He didn't win that year, but took home both Best Actor awards (as well as countless nominations) for his role as a father who finds out his wife was unfaithful as she lays in a coma in Alexander Payne's The Descendants - Familie und andere Angelegenheiten (2011). Through his career, Clooney has been heralded for his political activism and humanitarian work. He has served as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace since 2008, has been an advocate for the Darfur conflict, and organized the Hope for Haiti telethon, to raise money for the victims of the 2010 earthquake. In March 2012, Clooney was arrested for civil disobedience while protesting at the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\nClooney was married to actress Talia Balsam, from 1989 until 1993. After their divorce, he swore he would never marry again. Michelle Pfeiffer and Nicole Kidman bet him $10,000 that he would have children by the age of 40, and sent him a check shortly after his birthday. Clooney returned the funds and bet double or nothing he wouldn't have children by the age of 50. Although he has remained a consummate bachelor, Clooney has had many highly publicized relationships, including with former WWE wrestler Stacy Keibler. In 2014, he married lawyer and activist Amal Clooney, with whom he has two children, twins.\n\nCourteney Cox was born on June 15th, 1964 in Birmingham, Alabama, into an affluent Southern family. She is the daughter of Courteney (Bass) and Richard Lewis Cox (1930-2001), a businessman. She was the baby of the family with two older sisters (Virginia and Dottie) and an older brother, Richard, Jr. She was raised in an exclusive society town, Mountain Brook, Alabama. Courteney was the archetypal daddy's girl, and therefore was understandably devastated when, in 1974, her parents divorced, and her father moved to Florida.\n\nShe became a rebellious teen, and did not make things easy for her mother, and new stepfather, New York businessman Hunter Copeland. Now, she is great friends with both. She attended Mountain Brook High School, where she was a cheerleader, tennis player and swimmer. In her final year, she received her first taste of modeling. She appeared in an advert for the store, Parisians. Upon graduation, she left Alabama to study architecture and interior design at Mount Vernon College. After one year she dropped out to a pursue a modeling career in New York, after being signed by the prestigious Ford Modelling Agency. She appeared on the covers of teen magazines such as Tiger Beat and Little Miss, plus numerous romance novels. She then moved on to commercials for Maybeline, Noxema, New York Telephone Company and Tampax.\n\nWhile modeling, she attended acting classes, as her real dream and ambition was to be an actress. In 1984, she landed herself a small part in one episode of Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956) as a young débutante named Bunny. Her first big break, however, was being cast by Brian De Palma in the Bruce Springsteen video \"Dancing in The Dark\". In 1985, she moved to LA to star alongside Dean Paul Martin in Die Spezialisten unterwegs (1985). It was a flop, but a few years later, she was chosen out of thousands of hopefuls to play Michael J. Fox's girlfriend, psychology major Lauren Miller in Familienbande (1982).\n\nIn 1989, Familienbande (1982) ended, and Cox went through a lean spell in her career, featuring in unmemorable movies such as Mr. Destiny (1990) with Michael Caine. Fortunes changed dramatically for Cox, when in 1994, she starred alongside Jim Carrey in the unexpected hit Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), and a year later she was cast as Monica Geller on the hugely successful sitcom Friends (1994). It was this part that turned her into an international superstar and led to an American Comedy Award nomination. In 1996 Cox starred in Wes Craven's horror/comedy Scream - Schrei! (1996) . This movie grossed over $100 million at the box office, and won Cox rave reviews for her standout performance as the wickedly bitchy and smug TV reporter Gale Weathers. She went on to play this character again in each of the three sequels. Not only did her involvement in this movie lead to critical acclaim, but it also led to her meeting actor husband David Arquette. He played her on-screen love interest Dewey, and life imitated art as the two fell in love for real. Their wedding took place in San Francisco, at the historic Grace Cathedral atop Nob Hill, on June 12th, 1999. Joined by 200 guests, including Cox's film star friends Liam Neeson and Kevin Spacey, the happy couple finally became Mr. and Mrs. Arquette.\n\nAfter 35 years as a professional actor, Louis Herthum had a breakthrough year in 2017, a year that saw him upped to a series regular for season 2 of HBO's critically acclaimed \"Westworld.\" Herthum made a big impact with his memorable turn on \"Westworld,\" as Peter Abernathy, father to Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) and one of the first robots to experience programming glitches in the series first season.\n\nHerthum began his acting career in his hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His first \"big break\" came in 1991 when he joined the cast of the long-running hit CBS series \"Murder, She Wrote,\" starring as Deputy Andy Broom opposite Angela Lansbury for the show's final five seasons. His recurring television roles include his portrayal of Omar in Netflix's \"Longmire,\" and werewolf pack leader JD in season 5 of HBO's supernatural drama \"True Blood.\" Herthum has appeared in over 40 stage productions, dozens of commercials and combined over 100 films and TV shows.\n\nIn early 1996 Louis added \"Producer\" to his resume, producing his first feature film, \"Favorite Son\". Since then Louis has, through his Louisiana based production company Ransack Films, produced a total of five narrative features, including the award winning thriller, \"Red Ridge\" and one feature length documentary, \"The Season Before Spring\" (also an award winner) about the first post-Katrina Mardi Gras in 2006.\n\nLouis is avid art & antique collector and owns a 1968 Ford Mustang Fastback which he has restored in homage to the film that inspired him to go into show business - \"Bullitt\" with Steve McQueen.\n\nGregg Henry has worked with many well-known filmmakers.

Henry also stars in Star Trek - Der Aufstand (1998), and is maybe best known for the role of Val Resnick in Payback - Zahltag (1999).\n\nHenry has numerous TV credits, notably as Hollis Doyle in Scandal (2012); Hit & Run (2021) for Netflix; The Riches (2007); The Killing (2011); The Following (2013); Chicago Med (2015); Hung - Um Längen besser (2009); Hell on Wheels (2011); Gilmore Girls (2000); Law & Order: Organized Crime (2021). In a chilling portrayal of the infamous Dennis Rader, Henry starred in the critically acclaimed BTK Serial Killer (2005).\n\nOn stage, Henry most recently played the titular character in the brilliant and controversial production of Julius Caesar by the Public Theater and Oskar Eustis in Central Park. He's also performed at Seattle Rep, ACT Seattle, South Coast Rep, Old Globe Theater San Diego, and the Denver Center Theater. Henry has won thirteen Drama-Logue Awards, an L.A. Weekly Award, and the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for his stage work as producer and actor.\n\nA composer and lyricist, Henry wrote both music and lyrics for Little Egypt: The Musical, which had a successful LA run and was accepted into the NYMF festival in NYC. He composed and wrote lyrics for two additional musicals, work-shopped at the LAByrinth Theater Summer intensives.\n\nHenry plays the piano and has recorded several albums, as a professional singer and songwriter. Dwight Yoakam's cover of Henry's song, \"The Back of Your Hand\" for his album Population Me, reached #1 on CMT. Henry lives in Los Angeles, California with his wife Lisa James, a noted director for the American Theater.\n\nBlue-eyed, red-haired American character actress, often seen as resolute, strong-willed women. Though born in Kansas, Barbara Babcock spent much of her early childhood in Japan, where her father, U.S. Army Major General Conrad Stanton Babcock Jr., was posted (he was also a noted equestrian, who competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics). Her mother was Chilean-born Jadwiga Florence Noskowiak (1903-2000), a former stage actress and singer.\n\nBabcock attended universities in Lausanne and Milan and later graduated from Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She initially interviewed for a job with the State Department, aiming at a diplomatic career. When this fell through, she turned to acting, debuting on screen in 1956. From the early 60s, Babcock made guest appearances in numerous television series. She ultimately became best known for her Emmy Award-winning performance as the over-amorous Grace Gardner in NBC's Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981) and as pioneer newspaper editor Dorothy Jennings in Dr. Quinn - Ärztin aus Leidenschaft (1993) (a regular role, lasting from 1993 to 1998).\n\nBabcock featured several times on Raumschiff Enterprise (1966), though it was more often her voice that was utilized for assorted alien background characters. She also played a member of the 'underground' in episodes of Ein Käfig voller Helden (1965) and Pam Ewing's fashion boss in Dallas (1978). Babcock was one of the leads in Alan Alda's sitcom The Four Seasons (1984), about four middle-aged couples who vacation together four times annually, once per season. In this, she played the orthopedist wife of Allan Arbus (of M*A*S*H (1972) fame). Babcock subsequently starred in her own right as a demure attorney, counterpoint to Jerry Orbach's vociferous, seedy 'old school' gumshoe, in the short-lived CBS mystery drama Privatdetektiv Harry McGraw (1987). One might also remember her as one of the (ill-fated) residents of Brennen muß Salem (1979) and as a repeat guest star on Mannix (1967) and (alternating between murder victim and villainess of the week) in Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984).\n\nHer occasional forays to the big screen tended to be in smaller supporting roles, first up as an Apache kidnap victim in the Glenn Ford western Totem (1968). More recently in maternal roles, she portrayed an Irish immigrant, the mother of Nicole Kidman's character, in Ron Howard's big budget western In einem fernen Land (1992). Her last motion picture appearance was as the wife of test pilot and would-be-astronaut Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood) in Space Cowboys (2000).\n\nBarbara Babcock retired from acting in 2004, the year she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In her private life, she has had a lifelong interest in travel and exploration and has dabbled in writing. She is known as an avid crusader for animal rights.\n\nBryan Lee Cranston was born on March 7, 1956 in Hollywood, California, to Audrey Peggy Sell, a radio actress, and Joe Cranston, an actor and former amateur boxer. His maternal grandparents were German, and his father was of Irish, German, and Austrian-Jewish ancestry. He was raised in the Canoga Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, and also stayed with his grandparents, living on their poultry farm in Yucaipa. Cranston's father walked out on the family when Cranston was eleven, and they did not see each other again until 11 years later, when Cranston and his brother decide to track down their father.\n\nCranston is known for his roles as Walter White on the AMC crime drama Breaking Bad (2008), Hal on the Fox situation comedy Malcolm mittendrin (2000), and Dr. Tim Whatley on five episodes of the NBC situation comedy Seinfeld (1989).

Together with his wife, he is the father of actor Gabriel Macht, and of three other children, and also has eight grandchildren and counting. His greatest hobby and future plans are to provide a lot of entertainment for years to come. Through the years, Macht has participated in and supported various charitable causes, serving as an Honorary Board Member of the Parkinson's Resource Organization and its Master of Ceremonies for the past ten years. In 1981 and 1982, he was the original moderator of the Los Angeles Jewish Federation's JTV. He has been spokesman for the Jewish National Fund, M.C. for several Israeli Consulate functions and is a board member of The Center For Jewish Culture and Creativity under leadership of Ruth and John Rauch. In 2013 Stephen earned his M.A. in Jewish Studies at the Academy for the Jewish Religion, Ca. and is an ordained Chaplain. He officiates at weddings, baby namings, and funerals by private arrangement.\n\nVeteran theater actor James Sutorius has performed for the most prestigious regional and repertory companies in the country including California's Old Globe, La Jolla Playhouse, Center Theatre Group, Huntington Hartford, South Coast Repertory, and Pasadena Playhouse, as well as Lincoln Center, Yale Repertory, Seattle Repertory, Long Wharf Theatre, Cleveland Playhouse, Asolo State Theatre, Cleveland Playhouse, Arizona Repertory and Cherry Lane Theatre. While he has displayed his talents in scores of TV and film assignments over a three-decade period, his heart has remained true to the theater. Most recently he was seen on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre in Aaron Sorkin's new play \"The Farnsworth Invention\" that was directed by Des McAnuff and produced by Steven Spielberg. In 2007 he won two San Diego Theatre Critics Awards for his memorable performance as George in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" and for his multiple supporting roles in John Strand's play \"Lincolnesque\". Prior to that he was selected to co-star in Arthur Laurents \"2 Lives\" at the George Street Playhouse in New York and in Charles L. Mee Jr.'s play \"A Perfect Wedding\" at the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nJames was born in Ohio but raised in Wheaton, Illinois, the youngest of three sons born to an advertising executive and a homemaker. Attending the same Wheaton high school as John Belushi and Bob Woodward, James was quite active in sports. It was a leading role in a school production of \"The Desperate Hours,\" however, that altered his career ambitions. Studying at Illinois' Wesleyan University, James had played the first of his three Hamlets by the time he received his BFA. He went on to train at the Academy of Dramatic Art in Michigan for two years before relocating to New York City to try his luck.\n\nHe didn't have to wait long or pay the bills by waiting tables or opening hotel doors. His deep, classically-trained voice was perfectly suited for voiceover work and almost immediately he had the good fortune of landing a 17-year job as the voice for Ragu Spaghetti Sauce and spawning the national catchphrase \"Now, THAT'S Italian!\" Voice-over work continues to this day pitching other products such as Coca Cola and Wrangler Jeans. He also lends his distinctive voice to audio books and short story anthologies on tape.\n\nJames made an auspicious Broadway debut in 1973 with \"The Changing Room.\" In his very first entrance as a member of a rugby team, he had to walk downstage and strip off all his clothes! Instead of finding the experience terrifying, he actually found it liberating. Two years later he was playing Laertes at the Vivian Beaumont opposite Sam Waterston's Hamlet, and alongside a rising cast of stars that included Jane Alexander, Mandy Patinkin, George Hearn and John Heard. Following that in 1978 he played the son of Cameron Mitchell and Jan Sterling in \"The November People\" at the Billy Rose Theatre.\n\nIn the mid-1970s James broke into TV. With his intense good looks, he was deemed to play a number of no-nonsense professional types as well as heavies in dramatic programs. After guest roles on such shows as \"Cannon\" and \"Kojak,\" he found series regular work supporting Bob Crane on his short-lived sitcom The Bob Crane Show (1975). His break, however, came when he nabbed the starring role of investigative reporter Mike Andros in the one-season Mike Andros - Reporter der Großstadt (1977), which filmed on the streets of New York. This success convinced him to make a decisive move to Los Angeles. Appearing in a number of notable TV movies including Tod in einer kleinen Stadt (1978), Liebe vor Gericht (1978), Kreuz der Gewalt (1981), Space - Der Mensch greift nach den Sternen (1985) and Auf den Schwingen des Adlers (1986), he went on to guest star on the most popular series of the day (\"St. Elsewhere,\" \"Family Ties,\" \"21 Jump Street,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"L.A. Law,\" \"The X Files\", \"Judging Amy\"). He also found occasional recurring stints on such shows as \"Dynasty\". Sporadic film work came along in the form of I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can (1982) starring Jill Clayburgh and Windige Stadt (1984) with John Shea and Kate Capshaw.\n\nIt is his classical and contemporary work in theatre, however, that has sustained him over the years -- his multiple Hamlets and Macbeth, as well as his John Proctor in \"The Crucible,\" Trigorin in \"The Seagull,\" Astrov in \"Uncle Vanya,\" Valmont in \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses,\" McMurphy in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" Sir Thomas More in \"A Man for All Seasons,\" Dick Dudgeon in \"The Devil's Disciple\" and Marchbanks in \"Candida.\" One special highlight was his highly successful return to Broadway in 1992 when he replaced \"Monk\" actor Tony Shalhoub as son Charlie in the hard-hitting, Tony Award-winning play \"Conversations with My Father\" opposite Judd Hirsch.\n\nEver-radiant TV and film actor Susan Blakely found success on several paths she chose for herself over the years -- first as a model, then as an award-winning actress, and as a jewelry designer. The trim and trendy blonde is best known for enhancing a stream of popular films during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBorn on September 7, 1948, in Frankfurt, Germany, Susan is the daughter of U.S. Army Colonel Lawrence Blakely. While growing up, she traveled extensively throughout the world with her family including Korea, Hawaii and, finally, Texas. Following a year of study at the University of Texas, Susan moved to New York and secured a place for herself as a magazine and TV ad model for the Ford Modeling Agency.\n\nAt the same time, Susan was encouraged to try her hand at acting and studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Married in 1969 to lawyer and screenwriting hopeful Todd Merer, they moved to Hollywood to seek their fame and fortune.\n\nBilled initially as Susie Blakely, she was cast in such films as Unter Wilden (1972) (her debut) and Jene Jahre in Hollywood (1973). Her first popular movie role came about surrounded by an all-star cast in Irwin Allen's epic disaster Flammendes Inferno (1974), as the spoiled princess-like daughter of unscrupulous skyscraper builder William Holden and wife of callous, pretty-boy opportunist Richard Chamberlain. Susan willingly accepted the challenge of proving herself in Hollywood as more than just another starlet with a gorgeous face.\n\nShe did .. .and became a prominent name in Hollywood to boot ... by earning a Golden Globe and Emmy nomination for her exceptional work as \"Julie Prescott\" in the acclaimed TV mini-series epic Reich & arm (1976) with both Peter Strauss and Nick Nolte vying for her attention. It was star-making for all three leads.\n\nThis monumental acting opportunity kicked off a highly rewarding career in TV mini-movies, playing an array of flawed but fascinating and newsworthy ladies, including Hitler's mistress Eva Braun opposite Anthony Hopkins in Der Führerbunker (1981); tormented actress Frances Farmer in Will There Really Be a Morning? (1983); political wife Joan Bennett Kennedy in The Ted Kennedy Jr. Story (1986); and crime attorney Leslie Abramson in Du sollst Vater und Mutter ehren - Doppelmord in Beverly Hills (1994). A few other interesting roles came in as well that belied Susan's glossy, pretty-girl image -- ranging from an amphetamine addict in the TV movie A Cry for Love (1980) to a housewife who changes into a werewolf in the movie Meine Mutter ist ein Werwolf (1989).\n\nInto the millennium, Susan accomplished a prime, award-winning role in Hungry Hearts (2002). Other films have included co-star/featured roles in The Cherokee Strip (1937), Final Crash - Concorde in den Tod (2001), Mating Dance (2008), The Genesis Code (2010), and Displacement (2016), as well as several short films of director Marc Saltarelli -- To Comfort You (2009), Pride (2011) Remember to Breathe (2013) and Speak (2016).\n\nHaving starred on stage in the 2006 world premiere of \"Diva!\" at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, Susan has guest-starred on several popular TV programs including \"Diagnosis Murder,\" \"Baywatch,\" \"Strong Medicine,\" \"Cold Case,\" \"Nip/Tuck,\" \"Murder 101,\" \"Two and a Half Men,\" \"Brothers and Sisters,\" \"NCIS\" and \"This Is Us.\"\n\nIn recent years, Susan has broadened her horizons once again as a jewelry designer...and once again she has met this challenge with great success. Divorced from her first husband in the 1970s, Susan remarried in 1982. Her present husband, media consultant, litigation and political adviser Steve Jaffe, has also reaped rewards as a film and television producer. Many of his projects have included Susan -- the afore-mentioned Frances Farmer TV biography, the TV-movie A Cry for Love (1980), and the film Russian Holiday (1993) [aka Russian Roulette]. They reside in the Beverly Hills area."
