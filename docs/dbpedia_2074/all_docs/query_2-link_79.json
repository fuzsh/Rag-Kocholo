        "text": "Jeannette Allard\n\nBurlington\n\nOur dear mother Jeannette Allard sadly passed away on August 8, 2022, at the age of 87. She was a wonderful mother who was always there when we needed her. Her kind and loving spirit will be missed. She was born in Berkshire Vermont in 1934, to Emile Philippon and Stella Jette. She spent her youth growing up on a dairy farm near Richford Vermont and had many wonderful stories to tell of those times. She moved to Burlington in 1954. Over the years, she had many friends and was a well-loved member of the community in Burlington Vermont. Everyone that met her thought she was a sweet lady. She was predeceased by her husband, Phillip Allard who died in 1992 and granddaughter, Heather Allard. She is survived by her daughter, Deborah and Robert Daly of Shaftsbury Vermont, and sons Brian and Kristin Allard of Colchester Vermont, Bruce and Marilyn Allard and Gary Allard of Burlington Vermont, Brothers Norman and Lucia Philippon of Los Angeles, California., Albert and Nancy Philippon of Bellevue Nebraska, Robert and Suzanne Philippon of Pisgah North Carolina, Leonard Philippon of Swanton Vermont. She has ten grandchildren and four great grandchildren, three of which live in Kodiak Alaska, all of whom she loved dearly.\n\nDuring her lifetime she enjoyed camping at Lake Carmi. She took great pride in her yard and gardens and spent many hours there. Some of her favorite hobbies over the years were, country line dancing, crafting, going to garage sales and playing cards with family. She spent many years as a volunteer at the Champlain Valley Fair, which she loved, ushering at concerts, and where she sold her crafts and helped out wherever she could. During her working years, she worked as a secretary at General Electric and later as a cashier for both Price Chopper and PC grocery chains. Her great joy was spending holidays with family, especially Christmas where she enjoyed decorating her home. She will be dearly missed by her family.\n\nGraveside service info: August 11, 2022 at 1:00 PM in Lakeview Cemetery\n\nIn lieu of flowers- donations in her honor can be made to Humane Society of Chittenden County https://www.hsccvt.org/\n\nOr the McLure Miller Respite House in Colchester Vermont\n\nhttps://www.uvmhomehealth.org/donations/make-an-online-donation/\n\nGregory Edward Berg\n\nNov. 26, 1971-Aug. 3, 2022\n\nMontgomery- -Gregory Edward Berg, 50, passed away unexpectedly on Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022.\n\nHe was born in Boston MA on Nov. 26, 1971, the son of Richard and Katherine Berg. Greg was a loving father and friend and would help anyone to the point of giving his shirt off his back or his last dollar to help someone in need.\n\nGreg is survived by his son, Carter, his ex-wife, Rebecca Terhune, his mother and father: Katherine and Richard Berg; his brother, Richard Berg (Robin Williamson) as well as a host of family and friends.\n\nGreg was predeceased by his sister, Marusia Berg, paternal grandmother, Janina Zedzik, maternal grandmother and grandfather, Mieczyslawa and Gregory Scherstiuk and father -in-law, James “Jim” Terhune.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at a later date.\n\nRodney Murray\n\nEssex Jct.- -Rodney C. Murray, 73, passed away on Monday, Aug. 1, 2022 after a hard fought battle with melanoma. He was born and raised in Burlington, the son of Chester and Thelma (LaFrance) Murray and brother to Gail Thompson.\n\nRod attended Burlington schools, graduating from Burlington High School, then enlisted in the U. S. Air Force. He served four years as a Fire Prevention Specialist, finishing his tour as a Staff Sergeant.\n\nRod graduated from Champlain College with a degree in accounting and his career spanned fifty years in public and private sectors. He truly valued his coworkers and the many clients he served over the years.\n\nRod’s favorite charities were the Burlington Food Shelf and Salvation Army. For 25 years he collected turkeys and delivered them there for Thanksgiving dinners. A special thank you to Home, Health & Hospice, especially Nurse Gale Smith. We are forever grateful.\n\nWhen he could no longer play baseball or golf himself, he continued to enjoy watching the Yankees play. For many years he was a race fan at Thunder Road and a fan of the Lake Monsters. Sad to see a good man who enjoyed life so much leave us but we look forward to seeing him again in a better place.\n\nRod married Linda (LaPlant) in 1968 and, together, they raised three children: Catrina DiNapoli, Amy Goodman and Dan Murray; all of whom survive him. He delighted in his three grandchildren: Jordan DiNapoli, Isaiah DiNapoli and Graycie Elkins as well as two step-grandchildren: Caleb and Hannah Goodman.

Burawa Jr.\n\n7/13/1965-1/9/2021\n\nHenry Burawa was born in Astoria (Queens), NY, to Susan Majores and Henry Burawa Sr. He was raised in the city by his father, grandmother and foster parents. At the age of 8, Henry and his two younger sisters moved with their father first to Utica, NY and eventually to Vermont when he was 13. Henry lived on Alfred Street in Burlington and then at the Allenbrook Group Home. He graduated from South Burlington High School and went on to attend Job Corps in Vergennes and Southern Vermont and Bennington Colleges.\n\nHenry’s career path as a printer at Lane Press was cut short when, at 23, he was severely injured by a drunk driver in a car accident. After spending months recovering in the hospital relearning to walk and talk, Henry went on to work several jobs including cook at Sneakers, St. Joe’s and UVM, inventory stock manager at SAS Auto, janitor at Rice High School, and crossing guard in Burlington.\n\nHenry was proud of his Jewish heritage. He considered himself a “City Boy” and often said “I’m going to fight to be an individual”. Henry earned a black belt at Shover’s dojo, and fondly recalled being told “This little guy has a lot of Bruce Lee in him”. Henry had a unique style with his signature long hair mullet, leather pants and vest, silver jewelry, bolo tie, and perfectly shined boots. He dreamed of opening his own vintage clothing shop called “Cool Clothes for Rockers and Bluesers”.\n\nHenry felt music in his heart and soul, particularly the blues. He loved to share his voice and guitar with friends. Among Henry’s favorite artists were Paul McCartney, the Beatles, Joe Bonamoso, Etta James, Dan Hicks, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Carlos Santana, Susan Tedeschi, Wynton Marsalis, Billie Holiday, Seals and Crofts, Grace Potter, and Journey.\n\nHenry frequently said “My friends are my family”. And indeed Henry cherished many best friendships: Kristina Olsen - the Pooh (he was by her side through thick and thin - her bodyguard) and her boyfriend Nick Courville, Marty Connors (who he met at Bennington College and with whom he made music over the years), Rod Billings (his longest friend), Donald Goggins (a close friend since job corps), Stanley Carlson (whose company he frequently enjoyed), Maryanne Billings Charbonneau (“best mom ever”), Barry Emmons (whose woodworking skills he admired), Amanda Clark (with whom he shared fun times), and Christine Connors (who he also loved).\n\nOn holidays, Henry cooked elaborate meals to share with his friends as well as those he saw in need. He was a loyal person, always there to pick up friends when they fell. Henry had a generous and giving heart - he enjoyed visiting local thrift stores and would often thoughtfully choose unique gifts for those he loved.\n\nHenry was predeceased by his father, grandmother, sister Nicole and godmother Elizabeth Edgar. He leaves behind his younger sisters Laura and Dawn. He is now surrounded by the many animals that he loved: Bubba, Miss Kitty, Bear Poohs, Rod’s dog Tasha, and sweet Claudia who left this world with him.\n\nHenry wished to be an inspiration to never give up. “You put me in a corner and I’m gonna come out swinging” - “If I can do it, anyone can, I was a wreck”. Help carry on Henry’s legacy. Be loyal to those you love and kind to those in need.\n\nMusic is the language of the spirit. It opens the secret of life\n\nbringing peace, abolishing strife.\n\n— Kahlil Gibran\n\nJoan Luise (Unkelbach) Bruns\n\nJoan Luise (Unkelbach) Bruns\n\nSo.

Any printing or backyard mechanic needs can now be taken care of in the afterlife. If paradise is searching for a new Cub Scout Leader or just all around awesome father, Rene O. Grimard is now there.\n\nRene is survived by his wife of 58 years, Lois. Countless summers were spent on their Goldwing, going to the coast of Maine to eat lobster or\n\njust a morning ride to the P&H truck stop in NH, for, what he thought, was the best breakfast ever. He always said the best food is served where the truckers ate.\n\nRene was born on May 17, 1937 in Rock Island, Que., Canada, the son of Alphonse and Aurore. Rene had one brother, Marcel (Pam) and his late sisters: Lucille and Anna (LaCount).\n\nHe was a loving father of Michael (Hi), Joanne (Richard) Cavallari, Joseph (Judy), Paul (Maria) and Peter (Maryland). It did not matter what time of the day it was if you needed his help, Dad was there. He would show up at your house, with his personal tool belt preferred, to help with any project. No matter how long it took, he was there every day! If you drove off the rode into a ditch at midnight, he would be there to help tow you out. There was an incident one time, he drove up to the Canadian Border in the middle of the night because something was forgotton by one of his traveling kids, and all it cost was a cup of Dunkin Donuts coffee. When it came to his family, there was nothing he would not do. There was no time of day that he would not answer the phone.\n\nHe was a proud Grandfather of twelve grandchildren and even two great grandchildren. An uncounted number of hours were spent babysitting his grandchildren. He never refused a baby-sitting chance. If you could not make it to him, he had no problem traveling to you. “Boca”, his nickname, had no problem getting down onto the floor and playing face to face with his grandkids. There was no problem that he could not fix with a tootsie roll or a stop to the Rite Aid toy aisle.\n\nRene was and avid member of the community. He was always willing to go above and beyond to help anyone in need. He was a member of the Vermont National Guard in his early years. This continued into a position on the Burlington Police Force. He would often tell stories of patrolling North Street in Burlington in the early hours of the morning before shops were opened. After that, he would work as a Journeyman Pressman for the Offset House Publishing Company, which he would retire in 1999. Post retirement, Rene put in hours as a guide and bus driver at the Shelburne Museum. His wife and children were not his only family, Rene took great pride in helping raise hundreds of kids in the Burlington community. For over two and a half decades, Rene was involved in Burlington Cub’s Scout Pack 15, where he was a Cub Master. Rene was more than just a father to his children, he also shared his time and gifts with the other children in the community. He trained young boys on how to grow up to be responsible adults, just like he was raising his children. Hiking, camping, knot tying, canoeing, being an active and positive member of the community, whatever he could do to help the young scouts grow into responsible adults, he would do. For this the Boy Scouting Association awarded him many accommodations,: the Bronze Pelican, the Silver Beaver and the St. George award were just a few of the many awards that hung on his walls at his home. Many Sundays were started by loading up the family station wagon, grabbing an assortment of 8-track country music tapes and driving to visit all the aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins…too many to name. To Rene, his family was his life.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, Rene would like you to donate to the United Service Organization (USO), being in the military himself, he had children and grandchildren who served or are serving his country. He always had a special place in his heart for those who chose to go above and beyond.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Saturday, July 25, 2020 in St. Joseph Cathedral with interment following in New Mount Calvary Cemetery.
