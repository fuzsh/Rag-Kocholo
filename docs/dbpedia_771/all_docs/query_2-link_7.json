        "text": "1.\n\nLong Time Missing 04:38\n\nThe people all around said they don’t understand The wonder kid’s gone and some one will have their say But he worked hard for yesterday He came upon the scene with a definite plan I know about the woman who wished upon a star They said he’d never get that far I read the news that shook the world apart Now I know you’ve been a long time missing And the world won’t listen To the long time missing in your life The balladeer man with a ward from the wings Is selling his soul for so many things we knew But never dreamed they would come true The girl on the phone said she’d go it alone Waking up the world to find what she always knew Will leave you lost and lonely too Got his number it’s so hard to ring Even though you’ve been a long time missing By your own admission There’s a long time missing in your life that we found Now I lay me down Tomorrow’s gone forever Like the weather Maybe never will our dreams be found I listened to the kids and I thought I could hear A thousand and one tiny voices ringing clear Another day in your career Around the corner there’s a newer breed Even though I thought you would succeed You’ve been a long time missing By your own admission There’s a long time missing in your life You’ve been a long time missing Now the world will listen To the long time missing in your life\n\n2.\n\nDon’t look down We’re dead in the water And I know you’ve got a lot to say Patience now Ahead in the slaughter Will surely guide the disarray I fanned the fires down I’m wandering round and round To see a means of escape could be Any light eventually Jealousy is writing a letter Explaining all you mean to me What a way to go But I remember When we touched I thought I saw the lightning It meant so much but now it’s all through It’s been so hard Getting out from under you The crimson tide is flowing away Now I want to ride the endless sea But I don’t know how I’ll have the courage To ever really be set free Dislocate away Far from never Don’t look back Just go and pull the rug out Drawing black on all we’ve been through It’s been so hard Getting out from under you Right now it seems so automatic This was your lucky day I tried so hard to be diplomatic You throw it all away I fanned the fires down I’m wandering round and round Still I remember When we touched I thought I saw the lightning If it meant so much Then why’s it all through It’s been so hard Getting out from under you\n\n3.\n\nTake Me Back 04:44\n\nWas it some time ago In a place that I should know Now I feel that I’m longing for the time When the world was serene And the things I’d never seen Were always grey So far away and in between Where few dared to dream Won’t you take me back To cruise around the sidewalk scene I fell off the track (Where) nobody knows Taking partners in crime In a melancholy time Where guilt and fear Would only soon appear Had to forfeit a lot And that’s all I ever got Along the way what I could feel But not reveal Were equally real Won’t you take me back To gaze upon the sidewalk scene I can’t ask you back But I thought you should know That whatever you feel will soon come to pass Where nothing is real Except for the past And I know the darkest hour Is right in front of you So take the blinders away And simply cast away Or multiply all the things you can’t deny Nothing much to declare And strictly unaware Forgotten shame will take the blame Another time Please call the line So won’t you take me back To cruise around the sidewalk scene I fell off the track And there’s a world that’s in between The blue and the black If only I could find that scene I can’t ask you back But where did you go? Where did you go?\n\n4.\n\nNever Really Been Gone 03:29\n\nNever believed much in apparitions Or any confrontations With someone I know who once went away Calling all the ghosts inside me Or anyone to guide me All along the way I’ve fallen through Throw your heartaches away When you’re here I wanna stay Now I know you’ve never really been gone There was a time when I felt so jaded And very overrated There’s a picture I’ve just begun to see Just a bell but I know I hear you And though I long to see you I know that I’m not alone anymore So call my name in the wind Now I know just where you’ve been When I say you’ve never really been gone Yeah I feel alright to be here Inside we are two Everything is getting clearer I know it’s true. In a silent night I wonder If I’ll make it through If it’s just the spell I’m under Please say it’s you So clear away all the devastation Cause there’s a new elation We’re riding on to bluer skies Throw your heartaches away When you’re here I wanna stay Now I know you’ve never really been gone Yeah I know you’ve never really been gone.\n\n5.\n\nThe World Outside 03:21\n\nLaughing with your mother She saw through your eyes Now time has run away and left us feeling so High and dry When I fall apart you’ll face the world outside But don’t walk away until your feelings die Some things go together We learned all too well Now I can’t shake away these feelings that you’ve never Heard me tell When I fall apart you’ll face the world outside But don’t walk away until your feelings die Somewhere in time I could live without you Now can I learn no to dream about you I’ll find a way somehow Laughing with the others They saw through your eyes Now time has run away and left us feeling so High and dry When I fall apart you’ll face the world outside But don’t walk away until your feelings die When I fall apart you’ll face the world outside But don’t walk away until your feelings die\n\n6.\n\nEinstein's Day 04:43\n\nChairs next to the windows Carpets touch the halls Time slides through the windows And slips behind the walls In the dark of night or in the light of day Underneath the painting Where it once was clear Well I was rolled in water I was rolled out past the pier In the tray of colors a whirlwind appeared\n\n7.\n\nBattle Lines 05:11\n\nThere we were just coming down the mountain Getting ready to go Everyone had learned something that nobody would know I remember you in 1982 Very much aware You didn’t listen Fortunately you didn’t even care Now battle lines are fading Real life’s rearranging In the end nothing sentimental lasts that long From the ocean I ran into the rivers Tried to save my soul All to late I realized my one and only goal Nothing’s broken now I have awoken I’ve got my head on fine I’ll get around to fighting if I ever find the time And battle lines are raging All the while, we’re re-staging In our lives could we ever really stray that far Common binds withstanding Several years you’ve been handed In the end something sentimental lasts too long And the war goes on Please leave me just the way you found me I just can’t live without it now Don’t follow the world around me We were walking round and round in circles I should have been so different like a martyr Not a wayward soul You left me here so jaded now with nothing left to show And nowhere else to go Now battle lines are fading Real life’s rearranging In our lives did we ever really stray that far When battle lines are raging Count the years you’ve been waiting In the end something sentimental lasts too long Still the war goes on and on\n\n8.\n\nHappy When You're Sad 03:31\n\nIf we had a reason And there was still time Look into the season Where ya gonna hide? Thinking ’bout the summer When you’re happy when you’re sad I want to go back now but I just can’t confide In anyone around here In anyone at all I’ve lost the time of wonder I lost it in the fall They told me not to stay here To be around this curtain call And the way I’ve grown away from it all All the lights that shine for me Give me a reason to be free I think I’ll wait here for a while And feel alive Gazing back behind you In any port of call They’ll be there to find you And watch you when you fall Alone into a whirlpool Of sad faces come to pass You’ve got to save away For these dreams that never last Burning down the road now Falling through the sky Looking through a window Of only you and I I’ll only find another You’ll be happy when you’re sad In the aftermath Come tomorrow, I’ll be glad\n\n9.\n\nLove Dies Down 03:44\n\nOnce love came upon us I never made this promise Got caught up and I got in the way In this borrowed leisure A round of hearts I measure I take mine back and throw it away To where I go unknown I know I’ll stop alone I’m off this elevator Did we get very far In the endless stream of ruination Can’t you see where you are Washed away When love dies down Though I was a hip shooter Now my mind’s polluted Factless understanding Time was so demanding While the days away I know I will not sway I’m over wasted triumphs When you look from afar At the trials ahead that soon await you No you know where you are Washed away When love dies down Far from home all the while They’ll try to inundate you When you’re alone now you know They’ll try to recreate you Complicate you Not you take as you are To where I go unknown I know I’ll stop alone On to the next sensation Did we get very far in the endless stream of condemnation Can’t you see where we are In the way When love dies down Now you look from afar There’s a road ahead that soon awaits you Now you know where you are Washed away When love dies down\n\n10.\n\nTuesday Morning 02:37\n\nTuesday morning I wanna relive that day A new scene’s calling I better be on my way In your lifetime You’re walking around With your head hanging down You’ve got to look ahead Just to see what’s around There’s time to save the day Change the headline There’s something I’ve got to say Leave your deadlines And throw all your cares away Here’s tomorrow You’re banging your head On the wrong side of the bed You’ve got to understand Al the things that you dread In time will fade away With your gravity in line You’ll think all the world divine Gray skies can’t begin to sway What I want to feel today And what I know is down the line Good vibrations Are cascading down While the room is spinning round I’m saving up the nights For the days that we found So gather all your woes cos we’re leaving today Now Tuesday’s here to stay\n\n11.\n\nWaiting Without You 03:55\n\nI walked along until I got caught in a turnstile I never knew the politics of living in exile When our lives are only made up stories I’m gonna lie in Purgatory tonight Please leave me here I’m dreaming about you Now that I know I’m waiting without you Another alteration from the latest edition How was I to know I was just a transition Over here there’s still compliance I’m casting off a strange reliance I know Never again will somebody doubt you Now thatI know I’m waiting without you A lot of thoughts go by Till there’s nothing left of the past I let the future die somehow And yeah it’s going fast If you’re alone and find yourself away from the action You’ve got to dream away to see some satisfaction When our lives are only made up stories I want to try and find the glory again Please leave me here I’ll walk in the sunshine Now that there’s no one here In the meantime Please leave me here I’m dreaming about you Now that I know I’m waiting without you Waiting without you\n\n12.\n\nWeak And Watered Down 04:15\n\nWon’t you come back You’ve been gone days But I’ll find you in a gentle haze (The) news has come From where you been seen last Escaping from a wretched past The world has stuck in time Something new has taken over now Please leave me here I’m blown away Now fear has left you weak and watered down In someone else’s eyes The saddest thing may never happen now Stuck inside these weak and watered down days Take the high road Following the sun You’re bound to see a different one Leaving only what you never lost Will someday prove to pay the cost I know they’ll never find And calendars will just spill over now Forever here they’ll make you stay The year has left you weak and watered down If only for a while You’ve got to get your feet back on the ground Wandering through these weak and watered down days Leave the carnival outside Many fortune tellers lied Just in case they file you away Living only for today And calendars will just spill over now Forever here I’m blown away Now fear has left you weak and watered down In someone else’s eyes You’ve got to get your feelings turned around Stuck inside these weak and watered down days\n\n13.\n\nTwilight's In Town 03:39"
