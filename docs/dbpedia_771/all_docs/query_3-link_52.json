He joins us now to discuss his project Sea of Hopeless Angels (Unsung Records), which began as several unedited studio solo improvisations by Markus on his electric touch guitar. Those recordings were turned over to mixer Stefano Castagna, whose sonic wizardry included...\n\nToday, the Spotlight shines On Berlin-based electronic music composer and performer Hainbach.\n\nI have come to view Hainbach as much an archeologist or audio specimen collector as he is a musician.
