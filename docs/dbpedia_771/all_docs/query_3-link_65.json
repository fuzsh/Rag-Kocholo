        "text": "Compact Italian-American actor Joe Pesci was born February 9, 1943 in Newark, New Jersey, to Mary (Mesce), a part-time barber, and Angelo Pesci, a bartender and forklift driver. Pesci first broke into entertainment as a child actor, and by the mid-1950s, was starring on the series \"Star Time Kids\". In the mid-1960s, he released a record under the stage name Joe Ritchie titled \"Little Joe Sure Can Sing\", and was also playing guitar with several bands, including Joey Dee and The Starliters. He even joined with his friend Frank Vincent to start a vaudeville-style comedy act, but met with limited success (interestingly, Pesci and Vincent would later go on to co-star in several gangster films together, including GoodFellas - Drei Jahrzehnte in der Mafia (1990) and Casino (1995).\n\nPesci's first film role was as an uncredited dancer in Twist... das die Röcke fliegen (1961) and then he had to wait another 15 years for a minor role in Blutiger Zahltag (1976). His work in the second film was seen by Robert De Niro, who convinced director Martin Scorsese to cast him as Joey LaMotta in the epic boxing film Wie ein wilder Stier (1980), which really got him noticed in Hollywood. He played opposite Rodney Dangerfield in Monty, der Millionenerbe (1983), was with buddy DeNiro again in Es war einmal in Amerika (1984), nearly stole the show as con man Leo Getz in Lethal Weapon 2 - Brennpunkt L.A. (1989) and scored a Best Supporting Actor Oscar playing the psychotic Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas (1990).\n\nHis comedic talents shone again in the mega-popular Kevin - Allein zu Haus (1990), and he put in a terrific performance as co-conspirator David Ferrie in JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991). Pesci was back again as Leo Getz for Lethal Weapon 3: Die Profis sind zurück (1992), and was still a bumbling crook in Kevin - Allein in New York (1992), and had a minor role in the Robert De Niro-directed In den Straßen der Bronx (1993). He was lured back by Scorsese to play another deranged gangster named Nicky (based on real-life hood Tony Spilotro [aka \"The Ant\"]) in the violent Casino (1995), and starred in the comedies Kopflos - 8 Köpfe im Koffer (1997) and Der $100.000 Fisch (1997), although both failed to fire at the box office.\n\nPesci returned again as fast-talking con man Leo Getz in Lethal Weapon 4 - Zwei Profis räumen auf (1998). In 1999, he announced his retirement from acting and since then, he appeared only occasionally in films, including a cameo appearance in Der gute Hirte (2006). He also appeared in the music documentary I Go Back Home: Jimmy Scott (2016).\n\nMartin Charles Scorsese was born on November 17, 1942 in Queens, New York City, to Catherine Scorsese (née Cappa) and Charles Scorsese, who both worked in Manhattan's garment district, and whose families both came from Palermo, Sicily. He was raised in the neighborhood of Little Italy, which later provided the inspiration for several of his films. Scorsese earned a B.S. degree in film communications in 1964, followed by an M.A. in the same field in 1966 at New York University's School of Film. During this time, he made numerous prize-winning short films including The Big Shave (1967), and directed his first feature film, Wer klopft denn da an meine Tür? (1967).\n\nHe served as assistant director and an editor of the documentary Woodstock (1970) and won critical and popular acclaim for Hexenkessel (1973), which first paired him with actor and frequent collaborator Robert De Niro. In 1976, Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976), also starring De Niro, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and he followed that film with New York, New York (1977) and The Band (1978). Scorsese directed De Niro to an Oscar-winning performance as boxer Jake LaMotta in Wie ein wilder Stier (1980), which received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, and is hailed as one of the masterpieces of modern cinema. Scorsese went on to direct Die Farbe des Geldes (1986), Die letzte Versuchung Christi (1988), GoodFellas - Drei Jahrzehnte in der Mafia (1990), Kap der Angst (1991), Zeit der Unschuld (1993), Casino (1995) and Kundun (1997), among other films. Commissioned by the British Film Institute to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of cinema, Scorsese completed the four-hour documentary, A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies (1995), co-directed by Michael Henry Wilson.\n\nHis long-cherished project, Gangs of New York (2002), earned numerous critical honors, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Director; the Howard Hughes biopic Aviator (2004) won five Academy Awards, in addition to the Golden Globe and BAFTA awards for Best Picture. Scorsese won his first Academy Award for Best Director for Departed: Unter Feinden (2006), which was also honored with the Director's Guild of America, Golden Globe, New York Film Critics, National Board of Review and Critic's Choice awards for Best Director, in addition to four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Scorsese's documentary of the Rolling Stones in concert, Shine a Light (2008), followed, with the successful thriller Shutter Island (2010) two years later. Scorsese received his seventh Academy Award nomination for Best Director, as well as a Golden Globe Award, for Hugo Cabret (2011), which went on to win five Academy Awards.\n\nScorsese also serves as executive producer on the HBO series Boardwalk Empire (2010) for which he directed the pilot episode. Scorsese's additional awards and honors include the Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival (1995), the AFI Life Achievement Award (1997), the Honoree at the Film Society of Lincoln Center's 25th Gala Tribute (1998), the DGA Lifetime Achievement Award (2003), The Kennedy Center Honors (2007) and the HFPA Cecil B. DeMille Award (2010). Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio have worked together on five separate occasions: Gangs of New York (2002), Aviator (2004), Departed: Unter Feinden (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).\n\nThe remarkable, hyper-ambitious Material Girl who never stops re-inventing herself, Madonna has sold over three hundred million records and CDs to adoring fans worldwide. Her film career, however, is another story. Her performances have consistently drawn scathing or laughable reviews from film critics, and the films have usually had tepid, if any, success at the box office. Born Madonna Louise Ciccone in August 1958 in Bay City, Michigan, she moved to New York in 1978 and studied with renowned choreographer Alvin Ailey, joined up with the Patrick Hernandez Revue, formed a pop/dance band called Breakfast Club and began working with then-boyfriend Stephen Bray on recording several disco-oriented songs. New York producer/D.J. Mark Kamins passed her demo tapes to Sire Records in early 1982 and the rest is history. The 1980s was Madonna's boom decade, and she dominated the music charts with a succession of multimillion-selling albums, and her musical and fashion influence on young women was felt around the globe. Madonna first appeared on screen in two low-budget films marketed to an adolescent audience: A Certain Sacrifice (1979) and Crazy for you - Liebe auf der Ringermatte (1985). However, she scored a minor cult hit with Susan... verzweifelt gesucht (1985) starring alongside spunky Rosanna Arquette. Madonna's next effort with then husband Sean Penn, Shanghai Surprise (1986), was savaged by critics, although the resilient star managed to somewhat improve her standing with her next two films, the offbeat Who's That Girl (1987) (although she did receive decidedly mixed reviews, they weren't as negative as those of her previous effort) and the quirky Damon Runyon-inspired Bluthunde am Broadway (1989). The big-budget and star-filled Dick Tracy (1990) had her playing bad girl \"Breathless Mahoney\" flirting with Warren Beatty, but the epic failed to catch fire at the box office. Taking an earthier role, Madonna was much more entertaining alongside Tom Hanks and Geena Davis in Eine Klasse für sich (1992), a story about female baseball players during W.W.II. However, she again drew the wrath of critics with the sexy whodunit Body of Evidence (1993). Several other minor screen roles followed, then Madonna starred as Eva Perón in Evita (1996), a fairly well received screen adaptation of the hugely successful Broadway musical, for which she received a Golden Globe for Best Actress. The Material Girl stayed away from the movie cameras for several years, returning to co-star in the lukewarm romantic comedy Ein Freund zum Verlieben (2000), followed by the painful Stürmische Liebe - Swept away (2002). If those films weren't bad enough, she was woefully miscast as a vampish fencing instructor in the James Bond adventure James Bond 007 - Stirb an einem anderen Tag (2002). After finally admitting that her acting days were over, Madonna began a directing career in 2008 with the barely remembered Filth and Wisdom (2008) and a year later she reunited with In Bed with Madonna (1991) director Alek Keshishian to develop a script about the relationship between the Duke of Windsor and the Duchess of Windsor that led to his abdication in 1936: the result, a movie named W. E. - Die Romanze des Jahrhunderts (2011), starring James D'Arcy and Andrea Riseborough as the infernal but still royal couple, was released in 2011 to lukewarm critics but it gathered one Oscar nomination for costumes and won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for \"Masterpiece\".\n\n\"Want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\" If you have not heard of Brooke Shields before, this tagline from her Calvin Klein Jeans ad had to grab your attention. Not that she has not had a previously noteworthy resume. She was born on May 31, 1965 in New York City, to Teri (Schmon) and Frank Shields. At age 12, she starred as a child prostitute in Pretty Baby (1978). Could this movie even be made today? It was considered risky and controversial in 1978. It was followed by another blockbuster, the romance adventure drama Die blaue Lagune (1980). Brooke has proved herself to be so much more than her early films. Her broad range of work as an adult would be quite an achievement for anyone, especially given how difficult transitioning from child actor to adult often is.\n\nShe has never stopped working, whether it be a Bob Hope Christmas special, her own sitcom Susan (1996) or as an author. She also managed to work on a degree from Princeton University. She has received a number of awards during her career, most notably The People's Choice award for 1981 through 1984 in the category of Favorite Young Performer. In 1997, she was honored again with The People's Choice award for Favorite Female Performer in a New Television Series in 1997 for her work in Susan (1996). In her personal life, she was married in 1997 to tennis player Andre Agassi and was devastated when they divorced two years later. She married for the second time in 2001 to Chris Henchy. She has been open about using fertility treatments to become pregnant with their daughter, Rowan, born in 2003.\n\nWhen suffering debilitating depression after the birth of her daughter, she made the decision to put her feelings down on paper. Her book, \"Down Came the Rain: My Journey Through Postpartum Depression,\" takes a hard, honest look at what she and many other women experience after childbirth. She still lives in New York City, and is still sought after for work in movies, television, and on stage. Pretty nice list of achievements for the once Calvin Klein jeans girl.\n\nOffbeat, unconventionally pretty, and utterly mesmerizing, Ellen Barkin was born on April 16, 1954 in the Bronx, New York, to Evelyn (Rozin), a hospital administrator, and Sol Barkin, a chemical salesman. Her parents were both from Russian Jewish families. Raised in the South Bronx and Queens, New York area, she wanted to be an actress as early as her teens and was eventually accepted into Manhattan's High School of the Performing Arts.\n\nBarkin then attended Hunter College and received her degree after double majoring in history and drama. At one point she wanted to teach ancient history, but instead turned her thoughts back to her first love: acting. Barkin then continued her education at New York's Actor's Studio. Fearful of the auditioning process, she studied acting for seven years before finally landing her first audition. While continuing her studies, she worked as a waitress at the avant-garde Ocean Club. Performing off-Broadway in such plays \"Shout Across the River\" (1979), \"Extremities\" (1983), \"Fool for Love\" (1984) and \"Eden Court\" (1985), she was applauded across the board for her first film lead in American Diner (1982) opposite Mickey Rourke and Daniel Stern, and pursued sexy tough-cookie status thereafter with such quirky roles in The Big Easy - Der große Leichtsinn (1986) starring Dennis Quaid and Siesta (1987) with Irish actor Gabriel Byrne, whom she married in 1987 and separated from in 1993 after producing a son and daughter. She and Byrne divorced in 1999.\n\nWith trademark squinting eyes and slightly off-kilter facial features, Barkin continued the fascination of her seamy/steamy girl-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks status most notably opposite Al Pacino in the thriller Sea of Love - Melodie des Todes (1989). In addition, she was well cast as Robert De Niro's abused wife in Die Geschichte einer Jugend (1993), and portrayed \"Calamity Jane\" in Wild Bill (1995) with earnest. Other impressionable offbeat projects included roles in Angst und Schrecken in Las Vegas (1998), Gnadenlos schön (1999) and Mercy - Die dunkle Seite der Lust (2000). On TV, she was well-cast in the mini-movie Tropic War (1988) and won an Emmy award for her gripping performance in Wie ein Vogel ohne Flügel (1997) opposite Oprah Winfrey as another abused wife who, in this case, turns her violent anger on her own daughters.\n\nIn 2000, Barkin married billionaire Ronald O. Perelman, eleven years her senior and chairman of the Revlon company, and put her career relatively on hold, appearing sporadically in edgy films like She Hate Me (2004) and Palindrome (2004). Barkin and Perelman went through an acrimonious divorce in 2006.\n\nJust prior to her divorce in late 2005, Barkin ventured into independent film production with Applehead Pictures, a company she set up with her brother George Barkin, who is a scriptwriter and former editor-in-chief of National Lampoon and High Times, and former Independent Film Channel executive Caroline Kaplan. In her first major acting appearance since her divorce from Perelman, Barkin co-starred in Ocean's 13 (2007) with George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and former co-star Pacino. She followed up Ocean's with a supporting role in Antoine Fuqua's Gesetz der Strasse - Brooklyn's Finest (2009), Happy Tears (2009) with Parker Posey and Demi Moore, and Twelve - Doppelt so gut wie Sex! (2010).\n\nBarkin has produced features over time, including Briefe an Julia (2010) and Another Happy Day (2011) (she also starred in the latter project). On the small screen, she appeared in an episode of Modern Family (2009) and her new NBC show, The New Normal (2012), got a sneak peek during the Olympics.\n\nMore recent sightings have included the films Das Chamäleon (2010), Very Good Girls - Die Liebe eines Sommers (2013), Cobbler: Der Schuhmagier (2014), Hands of Stone (2016) and Active Adults (2017). She has had regular roles on the TV series The New Normal (2012) and Animal Kingdom (2016).\n\nByrne was the eldest of six children born to a family in Dublin, Ireland. His father was a cooper and his mother a hospital worker. He was raised Catholic and educated by the Irish Christian Brothers. He spent five years of his childhood in a seminary training to be a Catholic priest. He later said, \"I spent five years in the seminary and I suppose it was assumed that you had a vocation. I have realized subsequently that I didn't have one at all. I don't believe in God. But I did believe at the time in this notion that you were being called.\" He attended University College Dublin, where he studied archaeology and linguistics, and became proficient in Irish. He played football (soccer) in Dublin with the Stella Maris Football Club.\n\nByrne worked in archaeology after he left UCD but maintained his love of the Irish language, eventually writing Draíocht (Magic), the first drama in Irish on Ireland's national Irish television station, TG4, in 1996.\n\nHe discovered his acting ability as a young adult. Before that he worked at several occupations: archaeologist, cook, bullfighter, schoolteacher of Spanish. He began acting when he was 29 - at first on stage at the Focus Theatre and the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, later joining the Royal Court Theatre and the Royal National Theatre in London.\n\nByrne came to prominence in the final season of the Irish television show The Riordans, later starring in the spin-off series, Bracken. He made his film debut in 1981 as Lord Uther Pendragon in John Boorman's King Arthur epic, Excalibur.\n\nByrne was featured as therapist Dr. Paul Weston in the critically acclaimed HBO series In Treatment (2008).\n\nIn his return to theater in 2008, he appeared as King Arthur in Lerner and Loewe's Camelot with the New York Philharmonic, which was featured in a PBS broadcast in the Live From Lincoln Center series in May of 2008.\n\nByrne did not visit America until he was 37. In 1988, Byrne married actress Ellen Barkin with whom he has two children. The couple separated amicably in 1993 and divorced in 1999. Byrne resides in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nIn November 2004, Byrne was appointed a UNICEF Ireland Ambassador.\n\nIn 2007 Byrne was presented with the first of the newly created Volta awards at the 5th Jameson Dublin International Film Festival. This was for lifetime achievement in acting. He also received the Honorary Patronage of the University Philosophical Society, of Trinity College, Dublin, on February 20, 2007. He was awarded an honorary degree in late 2007 by the National University of Ireland, Galway, in recognition of his \"outstanding contribution to Irish and international film\"."
