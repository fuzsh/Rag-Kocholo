The story of her epic fight against egregious gender discrimination in the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra where she won the position at a screened audition in 1993, inspired author Malcolm Gladwell to write the NY Times Bestseller, Blink where Abbie’s story is detailed in the last chapter. The 11 year long court battle was documented by composer/musicologist/activist, William Osborne in an article entitled, “You Sound Like a Ladies Orchestra.” After winning her lengthy court case, Abbie won a full-tenured Professorship at the University of Music in Trossingen, Germany and left the orchestra in 1993.

The New Yorker wrote, “Sharon Moe played the prominent solos with unfaltering lip and lung. She was really something.” She was married to the late, great French Hornist Anthony Miranda. They have a beautiful daughter, Antonia. Sharon writes, “Many people want to know the difference between a good musician and a great one, I think it is devoting every day to practicing, studying and listening to music. It is a part of you. It is as important as breathing. I believe that music chooses us. It wraps around us and never lets us go… Being connected to the arts makes us different human beings. If we were all tuned in to our God given creativity, we would be able to accomplish incredible things in this world.”\n\nPioneer Award Winner Julia Studebaker began cornet lessons in public school at age 9, playing her mother’s cornet, and switched to the horn when she was 11. Growing up in Illinois, she started private lessons at age 13 with Nancy Fako, a former student of Philip Farkas, and later studied with Frank Brouk, Dale Clevenger and Ed Kleinhammer, all members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She was a member of the Youth Orchestra of Greater Chicago and the Chicago Civic Orchestra. She attended Northwestern University from 1969 to 1972, and in 1973, left to seek work in Germany. In March of 1973 she was appointed Solo Horn to the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Berlin, becoming the first woman Principal Horn in a major German orchestra, during a time when there were still all-male orchestras in Europe. Her appointment caused major reverberations throughout the symphonic music community, especially in Germany. In September 1974, Julia became Solo Horn of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam. This position was again groundbreaking, as she became the first woman Principal Horn in a major European orchestra, as well as the youngest player, and the only woman playing in a principal chair in the entire orchestra. European orchestras have not been the same since, and her legend lives on today. Her impact on others was best summed up by another woman brass player who said in a magazine interview, “Julia Studebaker paved the way for the rest of us.” The San Francisco Chronicleobserved of her work, “Far and away, the star was the Principal Horn, a leading voice in the work (Mahler’s Seventh), Julia Studebaker.” Her courage and perseverance in pursuit of her career were significant – a group of horn players in other orchestras even attempted to get the Dutch government to deny her a work permit. Her career, performing with the Chicago Lyric Opera, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (as an extra with these groups), the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Berlin (as Principal Horn), and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (as Principal Horn), spanned 30 years from 1972 to 2002. She has also performed with various orchestras and ensembles including the World Orchestra for Peace. Fellow brass soloist and IWBC Pioneer Carole Dawn Reinhardt recalls “Julia Studebaker was still in Berlin when I moved there, but left for Amsterdam in the next season. It was a sensation for Europe at that time.”\n\nAcknowledged as the first woman trumpeter in a major symphony orchestra, Marie Speziale retired from the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in 1996 after having served as Associate Principal Trumpet for thirty-two years (1964-1996).

Bette is a widow with two grown children, Diana Morris who lives in Springfield, Illinois and Lou Dasaro who just graduated with a Political Science degree from the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater.\n\nBette lives in River Forest Illinois with her Shiba Inu dog, Ming, who sings along when she plays the trumpet! Her hobbies include fishing, photography, and reading about investing.\n\nBorn and raised in Winter Haven, Florida, Constance Weldon started playing drums in the fourth grade. She then picked up the trumpet, later playing horn, valve trombone, baritone horn all on the way to her final destination, the tuba! From that day on, Connie’s life was never the same as it constantly revolved around playing the tuba. As valedictorian of Miami Jackson High School, she was offered scholarships to all of Florida’s universities. She decided to accept an academic scholarship to the University of Miami.\n\nWhile studying with Bower Murphy, the trumpet playing teacher of all brass at the University of Miami, Connie auditioned for and was accepted to the Tanglewood Music Festival in the summer of 1951. There she played under the baton of a young Leonard Bernstein as well as other promising and established professional conductors. At summer’s end, she turned down a position in the Rio de Janeiro Symphony to finish her education.\n\nConnie completed a Bachelor of Music degree in 1952 and a Master of Education in 1953 from the University of Miami. Returning to Tanglewood in 1954, she auditioned for Arthur Fiedler and joined the Boston Pops Touring Orchestra. Connie next joined the North Carolina Symphony. In 1957 she was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship Award to study in Amsterdam with the Concertgebouw tubist, Adrian Boorsma. During that time she joined the Netherlands Ballet Orkest and was acting principal tuba of the great Concertgebouw Orchestra.\n\nUpon returning to the U.S., Connie joined the Kansas City Philharmonic for two seasons, after which she returned to Florida to join the Miami Philharmonic and teach at the University of Miami. Connie quickly established a reputation as an expert teacher, known for her prescriptive and thorough approach. In Connie’s studio, musicianship and technical teaching received equal time. As a result of her successful studio building, Connie formed the University of Miami Tuba Ensemble in 1960, the first credited group of its type at any university. In this ensemble, Connie taught a higher awareness of intonation, balance, rhythm, accompaniment skills, and solo playing with musical opinion. Her success with the University of Miami Tuba Ensemble led to interest from other universities and a proliferation of this type of ensemble throughout the tuba world. Connie’s success as a teacher also led to her becoming the conductor of the University of Miami Brass Choir, one of that school’s flagship ensembles.\n\nFrom 1972 until her retirement in 1991, Connie was the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies at the University of Miami. In this position she provided guidance to thousands of future musicians and teachers. Since then, she has been honored with the University of Miami Distinguished Alumna Award, the University of Miami Distinguished Woman of the Year, the World Who’s Who of Women in Education, and the Pioneer Award of the International Women’s Brass Conference.\n\nMelba Liston, 73, a pioneering jazz trombonist, composer and arranger, died April 23, 1999. She was universally known as the first female brass player to make an impact in jazz, playing in the bands of Dizzy Gillespie and Quincy Jones. A stroke in 1985 partially paralyzed her, ending her performing career. But she continued to arrange and compose for musician Randy Weston, with the help of a computer.\n\nBorn in Kansas City, Mo., Liston met the trombone at age seven. By age eight, she was playing on a local radio station.\n\nIn 1937, Liston’s family moved to Los Angeles. At 16, she joined the musicians’ local and was writing and playing in the pit orchestra of the Lincoln Theater and later joining the band of trumpeter Gerald Wilson.\n\nIn 1949, she went on tour with Billie Holiday in the Southern United States. But it disillusioned Liston. She quit music, working for the Los Angeles Board of Education for three years, and was a movie extra plucking a harp in ‘The Prodigal’ and ‘The Ten Commandments.’\n\nIn 1955, Gillespie asked her to join his big band touring the Middle East and Asia for the State Department. A few years later, Quincy Jones formed a band to tour Europe with ‘Free and Easy’ and asked Liston to be his musical director and trombonist.\n\nIn the ’60s Liston freelanced as a player, but gigs were few. She began arranging music for MoTown performers, the Buffalo Symphony and was encouraged by Weston to compose.\n\nIn the ’70s she taught at the University of West Indies and the Jamaica Institute of Music, and in 1987, two years after her first stroke, she was awarded a Jazz Masters Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1993, she shared billing and the cover photo with Weston on their CD, ‘Volcano Blues.’\n\nSince the publishing of her biography here, Melba Liston passed away in 1999.\n\nBeacon Award Winner and Bandmaster Peggy Thomas graduated from the Eastman School of Music in 1975 with a Bachelor’s of Music in trumpet performance and from Northwestern University School of Music in 1977 with a Master’s of Music in trumpet performance. In 1976, Peggy became the first woman in the world to gain membership in a Salvation Army staff band. As a member of the Chicago Staff Band, she served as principal cornet for almost 40 years and is presently is the Deputy Bandmaster. She has recorded extensively with the Chicago Staff Band, plus recording two solo albums, Songs in the Heart and Perspectives. In 2015, Peggy won a solo competition at NABBA (North American Brass Band Association) for ‘high brass slow melody.’ Peggy has appeared as soloist, clinician and conductor throughout the United States, Canada, Korea, Netherlands, England, New Zealand and Australia. She has performed with the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra as well as occasionally subbed with the Chicago Symphony, the Rochester Philharmonic and the St. Louis Symphony. Peggy is a former student of Susan Slaughter, Vincent Cichowicz and William Scarlett. She joined the Territorial Music & Gospel Arts Department of The Salvation Army in 1979. The Salvation Army is a church; therefore the purpose of this department is to create opportunities and resources that enhance worship in the Army by utilizing the arts as a tool to bring people into a relationship with Christ. She has also taught at numerous music camps sponsored by The Salvation Army over the past 45 years. Presently Peggy serves as the bandmaster of the Norridge Citadel Band of The Salvation Army, one of the outstanding brass bands in the Midwest. The band participates in all worship services and has traveled extensively in the United States and Canada. In 1988, the band was invited to march in the 100thanniversary of the Rose Parade in Pasadena, CA. In 1999, the band traveled to England for a ten day tour. Since becoming bandmaster in 1983, she has produced over 50 CDs with this band. Peggy and her husband Scott have two married sons and three beautiful grandchildren.\n\nAward Presented by IWBC President Joanna Ross Hersey\n\nPhilip Biggs was born into a brass band family and started to play the cornet at the age of five. The following 30 years saw him play with bands in the South of England before retiring as a player in the late 1980s. From this point Philip pursued a career in promotion and marketing, taking this up full time in 1996. Philip’s first notable foray in this new direction was in 1989 when he teamed up with Richard Franklin to be the founders of the All England Masters Contest in Cambridge. Since then “the Masters” has grown in stature and has become an permanent international fixture in the brass band calendar.\n\nIn 1996, Philip was appointed by the London Symphony Orchestra as Event Manager for the 1997 European Brass Band Championships held at The Barbican Centre in the City of London. In the same year he was appointed Administrator for The National Youth Brass Band of Great Britain and has been instrumental in ensuring the very best tutors are used on their courses to teach and inspire the next generation of brass players. He expanded his role and was appointed administrator of the National Children’s Brass Band – highlighting his commitment to the future brass bands. Philip was appointed Contest Controller of The British Open Brass Band Championship in 1991 by the late Harry Mortimer C.B.E. In August of 1998 Philip was appointed Administrator of The Brass Band Summer School, succeeding Gordon Higginbottom.\n\nPhilip has since become the administrator for such prestigious events as the Spring British Open Festival in Manchester, the Brass Arts Festival at Regent Hall, London, the 2002 International Trumpet Guild Conference at the Royal Northern College of Music and the RNCM Festival of Brass. As well as his work within the Brass Band field, Philip takes pride in presenting brass playing in all its forms. His company, Philip Biggs Brass Festivals (PBBF) has engaged world class acts such as Canadian Brass, Boston Brass, The Wallace Collection, Fine Arts Brass Ensemble, Hallé Brass, London Brass and The Don Lusher Big Band in addition to renowned conductors and soloists including Bramwell Tovey, Elgar Howarth, Maurice Murphy, Allen Vizzuti, John Wallace, Vince DiMartino, James Watson, Nicholas Childs, Jens Lindemann, Robert Childs, Roger Webster, Rex Richardson, David Daws, David Childs, Phillip McCann, James Shepherd, Sheona White and Steve Sykes. In recent times Philip has also very much enjoyed working with London Symphony Orchestra Brass.\n\nIn August 2003 Philip launched The Brass Herald, a five times a year, 92 page all-colour magazine covering all aspects of brass playing, from Salvation Army Bands to Big Bands, Conservatoire Brass to Brass Bands. The all-encompassing nature of the magazine is helping to create a better understanding across the boundaries of brass playing – to the benefit of all.\n\nPhilip was made a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians of the City of London in April 2003, and in June of the same year the Freedom of the City of London was also afforded to him. In 2004 he was appointed a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians of the City of London. Philip launched the Great Northern Brass Arts Festival at The Bridgewater Hall, Manchester in September 1998 and such has been the success of this annual festival, it is now generally recognised as the foremost non-competitive festival in the brass world today. Building on its success, Philip launched the Great Northern Spring Brass Arts Festival at The Bridgewater Hall in May 2010.\n\nSince the publishing of his biography here, Philip Bigg’s passed away on September 11, 2019.\n\nMarin Alsop’s outstanding success as Music Director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra since 2007 has been recognized by two extensions in her tenure, now confirmed until 2021. As part of her artistic leadership in Baltimore, Marin Alsop has created bold initiatives that have contributed to the wider community and reached new audiences. In 2008 she launched ‘OrchKids’, which provides music education, instruments, meals and mentor ship of the city’s neediest young people. Engaging the local community, the BSO Academy and Rusty Musicians schemes also allow adult amateur musicians the chance to play alongside members of the orchestra under Alsop’s baton. 2016 saw Alsop and the orchestra celebrated the BSO’s centenary with Joshua Bell, and host the League of American Orchestras annual conference.\n\nAlsop took up the post of Principal Conductor of the São Paulo Symphony Orchestra (OSESP) in 2012 and became Music Director in July 2013, with her contract now extended to the end of 2019. She continues to steer the orchestra in its artistic and creative programming, recording ventures and its education and outreach activities, as well as their annual Campos do Jordão International Winter Festival. Alsop led the orchestra on European tours in 2012 and 2013, with acclaimed performances at the BBC Proms in London, the Concertgebouw Amsterdam and further concerts in Berlin, London, Paris, Salzburg and Vienna. In 2016 the orchestra returned to Europe once again for concerts at the BBC Proms, Edinburgh International and Lucerne festivals.\n\nMarin Alsop now conducts the world’s major orchestras, with recent and forthcoming highlights including the Chicago, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouw, La Scala Philharmonic, Budapest Festival and Danish National symphony orchestras, the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks and the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig.

She is also Artist in Residence at the Southbank Centre in London. In September 2013, Marin Alsop made history as the first female conductor of the BBC’s Last Night of the Proms in London which she returned to conduct in 2015.\n\nShe returned to the Proms in 2015 and 2016 to conduct the OAE in an all-Brahms programme and Verdi Messa da Requiem on period instruments. 2015/16 highlights included a historic return for an American musician to Cuba, conducting Lang Lang and the National Symphony Orchestra of Cuba. In March 2016, Alsop celebrated Carnegie Hall’s 125th anniversary conducting Bernstein West Side Story in the Knockdown Center, a restored factory in Queens, and she will form a significant role in the world’s centenary celebration of Leonard Bernstein. In 2016/17 Alsop returns to London for performances with the BBC Symphony and Royal Philharmonic orchestras and brings the Britten-Pears Orchestra to Southbank Centre before returning to a residency in Aldeburgh’s Snape Maltings.\n\nJuly 2016 marked Marin Alsop’s 25th and final year as Music Director of California’s Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music, where she has built a devoted audience for new music. Building an orchestra is one of Alsop’s great gifts, and she retains strong links with all of her previous orchestras including the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra (Principal Conductor 2002-8; now Conductor Emeritus) and Colorado Symphony Orchestra (Music Director 1993-2005; now Music Director Laureate).\n\nMarin Alsop is the recipient of numerous awards and is the only conductor to receive the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship, given to US residents in recognition of exceptional creative work.

Other award-winning recordings include Bernstein’s Mass (Editor’s Choice, Gramophone Awards 2010) and Jennifer Higdon’s Percussion Concerto (Grammy Award 2010). Alsop has also recorded for Decca Classics, Harmonia Mundi and Sony Classical.\n\nBorn in New York City, Marin Alsop attended Yale University and received her Master’s Degree from The Julliard School. Her career was launched when, in 1989, she was a prize-winner at the Leopold Stokowski International Conducting Competition and in the same year was the first woman to be awarded the Koussevitzky Conducting Prize from the Tanglewood Music Center, where she was a pupil of Leonard Bernstein.\n\nSylvia Greenstein, of Hackekensack, NJ, served in the WAC band from 28 September 1943 to 6 February 1946. She was among those performing at New York ports when soldiers departed and returned and she was there to welcome home the soldiers, who were prisoners in German POW camps. She says she had fun in the band. Not all of it was a hardship, but a lot of it was, such as playing on the pier when the soldiers came off the ship on stretchers and wheels chairs. Fun at the pier was meeting somebody you knew going off to war and coming home. Her most fond memories are from playing on the ship that brought back the POW’s from Germany. The band usually stood on the pier, but this time, they were invited on the ship by the Captain. She recalls one man who never came up on the ship all during the voyage home. Apparently he was badly disfigured from being burned when his plane went down, so they assumed. When he heard that the WAC band was playing on the ship, he came up. Sylvia didn’t sleep for two weeks after that.\n\nSylvia was born in Bayonne, NJ and brought up in a small town of NJ — Carteret. Carteret was a small industrial town between Perth Amboy and Rahway located in the center of the state of NJ. Sylvia graduated from Carteret High School where she was a member of the high school band. In her senior year, she played in the state solo contest and was given second rating. One of the judges was Arthur Pryor, the composer of “The Whistler and his Dog.” She graduated in the year 1940. Hadn’t touched the baritone again until she was in the WAC band. Sylvia said the WAAC was formed in 1942, but she was too young to join. The age at that time was 21 and she was only was 20. At that time, a neighbor brought over a newspaper article saying the army needed musicians. All they had to do was play. So she said she would join but she was too young. Never having been away from home, she was scared to death to go. She prayed the war would be over before she reached her 21st birthday. In the meantime, Sylvia kept telling everyone she was going to join the Army! The age limit was lowered to 20 the month before her 21st birthday. Her neighbor came over to tell her she could now join. Sylvia said she waited all this while, and will wait until she was 21 — still praying the war would be over (life was so different in her youth than it is today).\n\nThe war was not over, and since she told everyone she was going to join, she did. There was a big ceremony when she went in. They saved a great number of them up and they were sworn in at Rockefeller Center. Sylvia was standing in front of the fountain and getting all wet during the swearing in. She knew she was being sworn into the Army but I did not know she had to be baptized at the same time!! From there she was put on a train and sent to the 2nd WAC training center in Daytona Beach, FL. and was assigned to a basic training company, and after she finished basic, she was assigned to Band #1 and she play baritone horn. There were two bands at that training center. The 401 band was formed. The band director of band #l was M/Sgt. Celia I. Merrill, who was authorized to compose a band from the 2 bands, and then they were sent to Ft. Hamilton, Brooklyn, NY as the 401st. And while she was with the band, it was always the 401st. Sylvia said being in the Army during WW2 was awesome. She was extremely proud to walk down the street in the uniform of the US Army, and being a veteran of WW2 is awesome, too. Sylvia’s vanity license plate reads WW2 WAC. She says she is just flaunting her pride. Some of the additional jobs were for recruiting drives, entertaining the wounded soldiers at hospitals, and incidentals such at marching down 6th Ave. when the name of the street was changed to The Avenue of the Americas. One day when they had off, they were recalled back to play a concert in the general’s back yard because his wife was entertaining some ladies. The general was very apologetic and to make up for that, he invited the band to take a cruise on his yacht!!! Unfortunately Sylvia promised to give a pint of blood and she was called to do it the day the band went on the trip.\n\nBorn and raised on a farm outside of Griswold, Iowa, at the age of eighteen trombonist Dixie Jensen enlisted in the Army in 1960, completing basic training at Fort McClellan, in Anniston, Alabama. Since this was during the time the Army did not formally train female musicians (the males received six months of training), her musical training was limited to her school bands where she started on trombone in the fourth grade. Her high school band director recognized her talent and spent many a happy hour playing duets with her and challenging her musically. She remained stationed at Ft McClellan for the next sixteen years of her career, playing with the 14th Army Band (WAC), also known as the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) Band. She retired in 1983 after twenty-three years of service. Her various tours of duty included being the first female First Sergeant/Enlisted Band Leader of a band other than the WAC Band. After retiring Dixie completed a bachelor’s degree and went to work for The Boys and Girls Club, staying for over twelve years. In 2004 Dixie organized a reunion of women who served in the WAC Band, noting “It was amazing when we held the first reunion…such wonderful teamwork, no matter whether we had been in the band during the ’50s, ’60s or ’70s.” Still an active performer in her seventies, Dixie performs in the Calhoun County Community Band and is organizing the next WAC Band reunion for 2014. The reunions conclude with a concert by the WAC Band open to the public and attended by people from all over the United States –and Dixie still leads her trombone section.\n\nThe Women’s Army Corps (WAC) bands began in WWII with five all female bands, the 400th through the 404th Army Service Forces (ASF) Bands. The 404th ASF band was classified as “Colored,” and was the only non-white women’s military band formed during the war. While all the women’s bands faced some ridicule and discrimination at times, the African American band faced special challenges. Please visit the Pioneer Display this week at the conference for more information on this and all the bands. After WWII ended, the bands were all deactivated. In 1948 the 400th ASF Band was reactivated and designated the 14th Army Band (WAC), stationed at Ft Lee, VA. When the Army moved the WAC Center and School from Ft Lee to Ft McClellan, AL in 1954 the WAC Band moved to its permanent and final station. The 14thArmy Band was integrated with men in 1976 and the designation WAC dropped from the title. The last person to sign in to the WAC Band was named Robert and he is considered a member of the WAC Band. The WAC Band was the longest lasting of all female military bands, and it’s members are a special sisterhood.\n\nHelen Jones Woods was born in the fall of 1923. Adopted by Dr. Laurence Clifton Jones, founder of the Piney Woods Country Life School, an African American boarding school. Dr. Jones established numerous musical performing groups, ranging from choirs to marching bands to jazz bands, that would tour the state and later the country to fundraise money for the school’s existence. The Sweethearts of Rhythm were established as the first all girl jazz band at Piney Woods, where Helen Jones Woods chose the trombone as her instrument, drawn to “watching the slide go up and down” Placksin, Sally “Women and Jazz: International Sweethearts of Rhythm.” After a few years of the Sweethearts performing, they were convinced to start a career of their own to earn money for themselves. Named the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, Woods and the band mates set out to tour the country. Woods and the girls traveled and lived on the buses, known to regularly break Jim Crow laws, covering white members in makeup. The band played sets alongside popular groups like Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie. They toured Germany during WWII with the U.S.O. and recorded with RCA, which included songs like “Vi Vigor” and “Don’t Get It Twisted,” arranged for them by Maurice King. After the band had split up in 1949, Helen Jones Woods joined the Omaha Symphony but after the first performance, criticisms about her race led to the symphony’s management firing her. Woods had endured an immeasurable amount of racism and mistreatment throughout her career as a performing musician and the Omaha Symphony would be her breaking point. She left music and finished out a long career as a nurse and social worker, caring for adopted children in her free time. Woods led a prolific life and her strides as a female performing musician of color during her tenure with the International Sweethearts of Rhythm paved the way for many of us that are privileged to call ourselves female brass players."
