Voting ends on October 5, so ACT NOW! VOTE HERE! https://lnkd.in/ezVTVw4p\n\nSeptember website/print edition is out today! Every month, we produce three different sharable editions--one covering web/print media, one covering TV/video media, and one covering podcast/audio media. Overall, I firmly believe it is a net benefit for society that we have more information sources than ever before, but it certainly comes with some pitfalls. The main pitfall we all have to contend with is that not all information sources are equally reliable, and the sheer volume of them makes the media landscape difficult to sort through. Our monthly editions showcase a small fraction of the total news sources we've rated. To see where any news source lands, go check out our Interactive Media Bias Chart: https://lnkd.in/gG_paGDS"
