        "text": "Now that 90-plus-degree days are the norm here in the Baked Apple, let’s make it even hotter with these fireballs:\n\nDeep Purple – “Portable Door”; “Lazy Sod”\n\nSpeaking of Fireballs, three-fifths of the group that put out that album back in 1971 are still with us in 2024, and creating stuff that sounds like it coulda been on any one of those ’70s classics. Vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover, and drummer Ian Paice carry on with guitarist Simon McBride (not exactly Ritchie Blackmore but he does the job) and keyboardist Don Airey (who actually manages to grind out some very Jon Lord-like organ work). Deep Purple album number 23 is entitled =1 and just came out July 19. From it check out these two tracks that harken back to the Machine Head days: “Portable Door” is a kick in the head to—kids these days I suppose (“You gotta be joking, man, what are you smoking? / Blow it out through my portable door”) while “Lazy Sod” is a fun ode to, uh, all of us lazy sods (“Don’t mind me coz I’m a lazy sod / Whether you like it, like it or not / And I’m guessing not”).\n\nAs For the Future – As For the Future\n\nA “collective” (as opposed to a “band”) from NYC called As For the Future? One would expect maybe art rock, hip hop, spoken word… But no, the sounds emanating from this record are distinctly Brazilian! Granted, with wordy, witty lyrics and subject matter (at times a bit too much so), but nonetheless reminiscent of the Gilberto/Jobim songbook. As For the Future’s self-titled album kicks off with the playful bossa nova of “Don’t Do It Again” and the Zen Buddhist rumination “Koan for the Music Business” (“If a record drops in the forest, does anyone hear it?”), followed by the delightful best-track-here “You Need Me More Than You Know.” And don’t miss some of the other highlights, “Encyclopedia of Songs,” “The Mob,” “Shell,” and “Letters on the Line.” Formed by David Nagler, As For the Future also features vocalist Alexia Bomtempo, percussionist Mauro Refosco (a music director for David Byrne’s American Utopia), and twenty-odd other musicians and vocalists. Pick up the album from their Bandcamp page, where it’s been since June 14.\n\nKate Bollinger – “Any Day Now”\n\nOkay, how gorgeous is this song…and how adorable is this video? Yes, of course there’s a ton of this kind of stuff around nowadays—cute, jangly folk-pop with ethereal female vocals—but once in a while a song just folk-pop’s out of the jangly, ethereal woodwork and becomes an instant summertime earworm. So behold Charlottesville, Virginia’s singer-songwriter-guitarist Kate Bollinger and her latest, “Any Day Now.” Joining her on this one are Sam Evian on bass, slide guitar and organ, Adam Brisbin on guitars, and Jacob Grissom on drums. Bollinger has been producing EP’s since 2017, and “Any Day Now” is from her upcoming full-length release Songs From a Thousand Frames of Mind, due in September (any day now! well, almost) on the Ghostly International label.\n\nPhish – Evolve\n\nUndeterred by any external musical evolution at all during their forty years of existence, the band Phish is out with a brand new album entitled Evolve. Well, maybe they’ve evolved somewhat—how could they not—but Trey Anastasio and company continue chugging along in that jam-band vein championed in the 1970s by the Grateful Dead. Witness the pulsating Hendrix-like opener “Hey Stranger,” the funky-chunky “Oblivion” (with a refrain that must’ve originated in an Anastasio dream—one of those cool dreams with a song hook and bizarro lyrics), and the too-catchy, positively philosophical title cut. Then there is the ballad-y side of Phish (“Monsters,” “Valdese”), as well as the poppy side (“Ether Edge,” “Human Nature”), and even the Steely-Dan-on-acid (!) side (“Pillow Jets”). All in all, one of the best albums yet this year! Phish were, are and continue to be Trey Anastasio on guitar and lead vocals, Mike Gordon on bass and vocals, Page McConnell on keyboards, and Jon Fishman (there is debate whether the band is named after him) on drums.\n\nCare Again – Sit Outside\n\nIf it were 1966, this kind of stuff would exist only in the head of one person—Brian Wilson. If it were 1976, Brian Eno would come to mind. 1986, perhaps Andy Partridge. But we’re well into the twenty-first century, and alas, sounds like these are commonplace among various “projects”—i.e. individuals writing and recording music in their homes under way-out-there monikers like this one, Care Again. Actually someone named Brandon Kerrigan (with producer/co-creator Dylan Magierek), Care Again is out with a 12-track wonder entitled Sit Outside,\n\navailable since July 12 throughout the usual streaming universe. Listen to the first cut, “Stoic,” with its echoey, dripping noises and shimmering vocals, and try not to have ever heard of Pet Sounds. Then comes “Allergies,” and don’t think of an album called Before and After Science, while “Coo” continues in the Wilson vein with its ukulele and falsetto voices. The second half of Sit Outside leans more to the XTC side of things, from “Concentrate” to the whirly waltz “Waiting on Them,” the breathtaking “Muddy Melancholy,” and the closer “The End.” Skylarking? Never heard of it.\n\nThe Surfrajettes – “Easy As Pie”\n\nFinally, it wouldn’t be the heat of summer without The Surfrajettes! The Toronto-based surf-instrumental ladies debuted here in the Schizomusica pages in 2018 with their cover of Britney Spears’ “Toxic,” and now here they are with their latest single release, another perfect slice of surf-rock entitled “Easy As Pie.” Watch guitarists Nicole Damoff and Shermy Freeman, bassist Sarah Butler, and drummer Annie Lillis bang this one out in a nifty (is that still an adjective) video shot in Melanie Pringles Restaurant, a vintage diner in Whitby, Ontario. Also featuring Robin Hatch on organ, “Easy As Pie” is the title track from their upcoming album on Hi-Tide Recordings—which you can preorder here!\n\nImage credits: southernillinoisnow.com/Gary Hershorn/Getty Images, hauraki.co.nz, asforthefuture.bandcamp.com, publictheater.org, tidal.com, en.wikipedia.org, popmatters.com, songbox.com, imperfectfifth.com, genius.com, tenor.com/jdelay1\n\nTune in next time, for more summer sounds! (temp oughta be 120 by then…ouch)\n\nLeave it to Neil Young…to take his 1990 album with Crazy Horse, Ragged Glory, perform it live at a private birthday function in Toronto in November 2023, record it and then release it as a new album on April 26, 2024.\n\nLeave it to Neil Young…to re-title all the songs using a lyrical phrase from each.\n\nLeave it to Neil Young…to call the album Fu##in’ Up, after track number three on the original, re-named “Heart of Steel” here, and to bring us some of the most incredible music of the year so far in the re-imagined “Country Home” (now called “City Life”) and “Over and Over” (now “Broken Circle”).\n\nLeave it to Neil Young…to set off on a tour called “Love Earth,” with the remaining members of Crazy Horse—Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina—plus guitarist Micah Nelson (son of Willie), and featuring the choir-fire-and-brimstone sounds of Reverend Billy & The Church of Stop Shopping as an opening act.\n\nLeave it to Neil Young…to surprise his fans on the tour with a set of greatest hits including “Cinnamon Girl,” “Down By the River” (not too long and drawn-out either), “Powderfinger,” “Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black),” and “Like a Hurricane”; an acoustic mini-set of rarely-performed songs like “Comes a Time,” “Sugar Mountain,” and even his sole number-one hit from 1972 “Heart of Gold”; a nice helping of material from 1975’s Zuma (“Cortez the Killer,” “Don’t Cry No Tears,” “Danger Bird”); plus Tonight’s the Night’s stoned sing-along “Roll Another Number (For the Road),” and just a bit—“Walkin’ in My Place (Road of Tears)” (aka “Mansion on the Hill”), “A Chance on Love” (aka “Love and Only Love”), and the title cut—from the new/old album.\n\nLeave it to Neil Young…to make a stop at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens on May 14-15, 2024, wearing an old-time train engineer’s cap as he and The Horse let loose one gem after another on two windy, damp, drizzly evenings.\n\nLeave it to Neil Young…to carry on as one of rock’s great elder statesmen at 78.\n\nForest Hills Stadium photos by me\n\nOther image credits: bestclassicbands.com/Thomas Arnold, rhino.com, ian.macky.net\n\nYouTube videos courtesy of Whitechapel Ghost Video, Christian Pflaumer, Chad Sclove\n\nComing up next, new stuff to listen to as that spinning planet up there boils\n\nAs the sun sets fifty years ago on Saturday, April 6, 1974, at the Ontario Motor Speedway in California, a day-long outdoor rock festival called California Jam is coming to a spectacular climax as Deep Purple takes the stage. A month later ABC-TV broadcasts the first of four shows highlighting the festival as part of their In Concert series. The full-page ad in TV Guide is a thing of beauty with its race car/guitar motif and list of performers: Deep Purple! Emerson, Lake & Palmer! Black Sabbath! Seals & Crofts! Black Oak Arkansas! Eagles! Earth, Wind & Fire! Rare Earth! This is something not to be missed—Deep Purple is the greatest band of all-time at the time, ELP’s first album is pretty familiar, and those other groups all sound like a fun lineup. So with tape recorder at the ready, you’re there…\n\nSetting the scene with a kind of mini-documentary about the concert concept and the tech prep to make it happen, the show kicks into gear as skydivers drift earthward over the Jam, the music barely audible above the noise of rushing air. As it becomes closer and louder, the music is revealed to be a mid-Jam performance by Seals & Crofts of a song called “Fiddles of Thunder,” a lively bit of bluegrass/hoedown stuff, leading into ABC’s rundown of the broadcast—“starring in order of appearance”—announcing each band and everything in between. At the mention of “California sunset,” the excitement is thicker than L.A. smog.\n\nl-r: Rare Earth; Earth, Wind & Fire; Eagles (apologies for cut-off band members!)\n\nFirst up after the commercial break are two energetic, early-to-mid-morning performances whetting the concert-goers’ appetites for what’s to come: “Hey Big Brother” by Rare Earth and “C’mon Children” by Earth, Wind & Fire (a year before they hit it big with “That’s the Way of the World,” “Shining Star,” and other hits). The Eagles (just called “Eagles” in ’74) are up next with a nice, extended “Take It Easy” featuring special guest Jackson Browne. Feel that warm California sun on your face even now whenever you hear that song. Seals & Crofts return, in their proper lineup slot, with the beautiful “Windflowers”…then all hell breaks loose as the real rock takes over.\n\nl-r: Seals & Crofts; Black Oak Arkansas; Black Sabbath\n\nHillbilly rockers Black Oak Arkansas come bounding out with the rowdy “Jim Dandy,” featuring guest vocalist Ruby Starr. Next up is Black Sabbath’s menacing crowd-pleaser “Children of the Grave,” which is your introduction to Ozzy and company and becomes your favorite Black Sabbath song, and one of your favorite songs to this day.\n\nFollowing the above-mentioned California sunset, it’s time for your heroes—Deep Purple—and the grand finale of their California Jam set, “Space Truckin’.” It’s a defining moment in rock antics as Ritchie Blackmore shoves the end of his guitar into the television camera lens (apparently pissed off at the camera operator’s intrusiveness), hurls the hapless Stratocaster into the crowd, grabs and abuses another identical axe, and finally becomes engulfed in fire and smoke as a huge explosion erupts from the stacks behind him.\n\nThe only thing that could possibly top that is…Emerson, Lake & Palmer’s performance of Mussorgsky’s “The Great Gates of Kiev,”* which at the time you assume is their own composition, a “song” called “Pictures at an Exhibition.” When Keith Emerson starts to get violent with his keyboards, making them scream in agony, accompanied by a fireworks display overhead, it’s complete rock theatrics overload. But wait! Suddenly, Mr. Emerson sprints away backstage and reappears at a grand piano that slowly (with time-lapse videotaping, not-so-slowly) rises into the air, then turns end over end, Mr. Emerson not missing a note as he pounds out some ominous, creepy-sounding chords (and not falling off his bench, either—he must be strapped in pretty good). Yes, it’s “The Amazing Flying Piano,” and it’s a sight you’ll never forget.\n\nFollowing these musical acrobatics, the trio is back together onstage to finish up the piece, their set, the TV broadcast, and the concert itself. Nothing short of bombastic, over-the-top rock perfection! Yeah, in 1978 there’s CalJam II with headliners Aerosmith, but it’s the original one—a half-century ago this spring—that will forever be implanted in your musical memory as the ultimate day of outdoor rock.\n\n“California Jam. We’ll be right back.”\n\n—Don E. Branker, California Jam promoter and host, 1974\n\n* Fast-forward to the 41:00 mark for “The Great Gates”; this is a video of their full set.\n\nImage credits: x.com, randymeisnerheartsonfire.com, psychedelicbabymag.com, earthwindandfire.com, last.fm, instagram.com, facebook.com, theamazingkornyfonelabel.wordpress.com, stpetecatalyst.com, outlastlife.com\n\nVideo credits: californiajamfanclub.com, windhoek 35, Salug Blues Music, hdrainbowlive, Bleu Raven\n\nNext time around, Neil and the Horse are back in town\n\nAh spring, when a record reviewer’s fancy turns to…The Jesus and Mary Chain, Stephen Bluhm, Rome 56, Lynn Drury, and The Special Pillow. What?\n\nNew and very loud in 1985, a blinding strobe of a stage show in 2017, and a still-cutting-edge sound in 2024 with nods to Lou Reed, Scottish band the Jesus and Mary Chain are out with their latest, Glasgow Eyes, released March 22. Check out the jagged electro-rhythms of opener “Venal Joy” and “Jamcod” (J.A.M.C.O.D., get it?), the Neil Young-ism of “American Born” (ironic since Mr. Young is Canadian-born), the ticking timebomb uneasiness of “Discotheque”, and the pseudo-homage to the Stones, curiously titled “The Eagles and the Beatles.” Stay tuned after that for the more atmospheric air of “Silver Strings,” “Chemical Animal,” and “Second of June” (another self-band-reference in that last one). Ah, but then comes the real deal: “Girl 71” (picture Marc Bolan singing over the guitar hook of “Vicious”) and the six-minute medley of V.U.-isms “Hey Lou Reid,” with Reid spelled like JAMC founders and brothers Jim and William Reid—nice coincidence? Pick up Glasgow Eyes today from the Fuzz Club label or the band’s website.\n\nBe forewarned—this is chamber pop. REAL chamber pop. In other words, not a drum or electric guitar in sight. But plenty of piano, strings and woodwinds, plus Stephen Bluhm’s wistful voice that at times brings to mind Hatfield and the North’s Richard Sinclair…and the whole Canterbury sound…through an American show-tune lens. Bluhm’s second album, Out of the Nowhere. Into the Here., kicks off with “Any Little Thing,” a carefree-romp-through-a-storybook-meadow that also notes “There’s a traffic jam somewhere” and sports a nearly Mozartian violin interlude. From then on it’s all Mozart-meets-Canterbury-meets-…Zombies? Highlights include “Wissahickon” (referring to a creek in Philadelphia, where Bluhm grew up), “Everything Is Better Now That You’re Around” (a piano-centric love song with a Broadway touch), “Existential Crisis” (Sparks, anyone?), and the closer “There Was a Light” (inspired by, according to Bluhm, an “accidental mystical experience”). Out of the Nowhere. Into the Here. is here as of April 19 from Stephen’s bandcamp page.\n\nThey are bigger in the Netherlands than the U.S.—go figure—but NYC ex-Shirts band Rome 56 keeps churning out solid, Elvis Costello-ish music, like this one, released April 5, Paradise Is Free. The festivities begin with a kind of convoluted James Bond title, “The Man Behind the Man with the Gun,” and two stunning songs released singly last year, “Hustle of the Crowd” and “Fire in the Sky.” Then it’s the ode to “Seattle” (though Arthur Lamonica sings “I’ve never been to Seattle”), the lonesome country swagger of “At the End of the Street,” and the Buddy Holly-tinged, “Give Peace a Chance” beat of the title track. Also of note are the Dylan-esque “Invisible Man,” the old-school power-punk-pop of “Dry Ice,” and the lovely last song, “Give Myself Up to You,” which features—what, an electronically-treated accordion solo courtesy of keyboardist Kathy Lamonica? Whatever it is, it’s amazing. Rounding out Rome 56 are guitarist Derek Cheever, bassist Joe Anastasi, and drummer Edgar Goss. Grab Paradise Is Free from Think Like A Key Music or the band’s Bandcamp page.\n\nSix months ago Lynn Drury appeared here with her single “Live My Life”; now she’s out with her new album (her tenth!), entitled High Tide. From the bright blue, watery-flowery cover art and the bouncin’-in-the-bayou lead-off track, “Blue,” (of course), New Orleans-based Drury continues her “NOLAmericana” style with eleven songs as sticky and sultry as the Big Easy itself. “Fade” is reminiscent of white albums-era Fleetwood Mac, both vocal- and guitar-wise (thanks to guitarist Papa Mali), then Drury continues her slightly Stevie Nicks lilt on the title cut and the delicious “Don’t Wait.” “Love Bomb” makes a nice centerpiece with its real homespun, countrified heartbreak stuff, “Great Divide” picks up the pace with some hearty slide guitar work by Mali and Roddie Romero, followed by the aforementioned, rollicking “Live My Life” (“I don’t wanna live my life in front of a screen!”)…and Drury sums it all up with the apt “When It All Comes Down.” And it’s all anchored down by rhythm section Rene Coman on bass and Doug Belote on drums. High Tide came out April 5 and can be found on Lynn’s website or Bandcamp page.\n\nSporting one of this year’s best band names (although the Hoboken-based group has been around for two decades), The Special Pillow is led by ex-Hypnolovewheel bassist Dan Cuddy, with violinist-violist-vocalist Katie Gentile, guitarist Peter Stuart, and drummer Eric Marc Cohen. Also appearing on track number 3 of their sci-fi-ish-titled album The Special Pillow Meets the Space Monster is the horn section of Cheryl Kingan and Steven Levi, who make that song, “Fond and Foggy,” a standout. Late-60s sun-pop meets Belle and Sebastian, what could possibly go wrong? There’s also the MC5-with-violins opener “Three on a Sundial” which should be longer; “A Certain Level of Uncertainty” (ha ha) which should be shorter; “Give Up the Ghost” sung by Gentile (and/or Debby Schwartz, credited with “vocals all over the place”) which is just right; garage-psych rave-up “That’s the Way It’s Got to Be” which has got to be on the long side; and the folky finale “Nowhere to Go but Home” which coasts along on a wave of strings. Get it on CD or digitally (what? no vinyl??) from the band’s Bandcamp page.\n\n“Record tree” photo collage (aka “Sounds of Spring”) by me\n\nOther image credits: thejesusandmarychain.bandcamp.com, stephenbluhm.fun, thinklikeakey.com, louisianamusicfactory.com, thespecialpillow.bandcamp.com, giphy.com/DP Animation Maker\n\nOn the next episode, a festival turns fifty\n\nAn overture of unquestionably Pete Townshend-penned melodies, a thunderous cacophony of world war sights and sounds, and the ominous opening line “Captain Walker didn’t come home / His unborn child will never know him.” It’s The Who’s iconic rock opera Tommy, updated (slightly) for the 2024 Broadway stage, and starting/startling out with a bang as soldiers fire their rifles amid the heart-pounding music.\n\nTommy the album first comes my way through radio airplay of “Pinball Wizard” in the early ’70s, as well as a study offered during an Earth Day celebration in high school. What Tommy has to do with Earth Day no one knows, but anyway…nothing compares to what’s thrown in my face in 1975: the Ken Russell-directed motion picture version. It showcases a star-studded Who’s-Who (shut up) of rock: Elton John, Tina Turner, Eric Clapton, in addition to all members of The Who, including Roger Daltrey as Tommy. Plus Ann-Margret, British actor Oliver Reed, and even Jack Nicholson (as “The Specialist”). Then there are the colorful, over-the-top scenes depicting Tommy being tortured by his Cousin Kevin (played by Paul Nicholas—we all fondly remember “Heaven on the Seventh Floor,” don’t we?), sexually abused by his Uncle Ernie (Keith Moon in a creepy Keith Moon-type role), and drugged with LSD by the Acid Queen (a very scary Tina Turner). That movie had it all: spectacle, symbolism, disturbing scenes, and great music.\n\nNow, 55 years after the original album’s release and nearly 50 since the film, Tommy has returned to the stage (the first stage production was in 1992), and—though not as outrageous as Russell’s creation—tells the story of the traumatized, enigmatic “deaf, dumb and blind kid” Tommy Walker with minimal stage sets, dazzling lighting effects, and of course “rock opera”-caliber sound courtesy of Rick Fox and his top-notch orchestra. Ali Louis Bourzgui portrays the adult Tommy with (almost) Daltrey-worthy power on stuff like the classic rock staple “I’m Free”; Alison Luff is mom Mrs. Walker, sans Ann-Margret’s sex appeal (and no suds-beans-chocolate orgy scene either); John Ambrosino takes on the role of Uncle Ernie—but he’s no nutty Keith Moon as he commences to “Fiddle About”. However, Christina Sajous steals the show as the Acid Queen, channelling Tina Turner both vocally and visually. Oh and what’s Broadway without crazy choreography, as the cast and “Ensemble” jump, spin and climb about during numbers like “Christmas,” “Sensation,” and “Pinball Wizard.”\n\nThe 20-plus scenes more or less follow the album’s track list, plus the addition of “I Believe My Own Eyes” in Act II, which was written by Townshend for the 1992 production. “Pinball Wizard” is the obvious crowd-pleaser, even without Elton’s flash and flamboyancy—or actual pinball machines. The recurring themes of “Sparks,” “Sensation,” and “See Me, Feel Me” keep the whole thing Who-centric…up until the last number before the finale, “We’re Not Gonna Take It.” Traditionally the song is a rebellion against cult leader Tommy by his followers after he forces them to step into his shoes and relive his experience. For modern times the lyrics to that one have been updated—no more “Put in your ear plugs, put on your eye shades, you know where to put the cork” or “Hey you smoking mother nature, this is a bust!” Well of course—“mother nature” is now legal in 23 states and available at storefronts on every block. And it all ends with the entire company joining in on the majestic “Listening to You” as the theatre walls threaten to explode.\n\nIf you’re in NYC grab tickets for The Who’s Tommy at the Nederlander Theatre, where it’s slated to run through at least November. In the meantime, check out this recent performance by the Broadway cast and Mr. Townshend himself on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Like the ads say: See it! Feel it!\n\nImage credits: yahoo.com, thewho.com, ebay.com, broadwaydirect.com, tenor.com/LogLady\n\nWhen we meet again, a new music roundup for Spring (which hopefully will have Sprung)\n\nIt’s that time again. Earlier this month the president addressed the State of the Nation—and now Schizomusica shall address the State of Psychedelia! And that state, as of 2024, appears to be either extended explorations of classic neo-psych or indie-pop concoctions with definite nods to the good old days of “trendy chemical amusement aid”*\n\nFellow psychedelic music fans, make no mistake, with a name like Tomato Flower and a song called “Temple of the Mind,” this four-piece from Baltimore would make one anticipate something very mystical and meandering. But “Temple of the Mind,” from the band’s debut full-length album, No, released March 8, dispenses its hits of harmony vocals and spacey guitars in just under two minutes. Tomato Flower is guitarist-vocalists Jamison Murphy and Austyn Wohlers, drummer Mike Alfieri, and bassist Ruby Mars. Say yes to No and grab it from the Ramp Local label or the band’s website.\n\nWe welcome from Detroit Rock City a trio of ladies by the name of Shadow Show: bassist Kate Derringer, guitarist Ava East, and drummer Kerrigan Pearce. Formed in 2018, Shadow Show released their first album, Silhouettes, in 2020. “On a Cloud” is the closer on their latest, Fantasy Now!, and blends elements of 1960s garage and psych-pop (complete with trumpet) with a modern-day edge, and frosts the musical cake with poppy and powerful three-part vocal stylings (all member sing). Pick up Fantasy Now! now, from Little Cloud Records/Stolen Body Records or the band’s Bandcamp page.\n\nFolks, for those who take their psych-rock straight-up, here are Adelaide, Australia’s Sons of Zoku. Typically trippy Eastern motifs meet lyrics that are a bit on the, uh, frank side on “Nu Poeme,” the final track on their new album, ËNDL​​​Ë​​​SS, released last month. Sons of Zoku are Portuguese-born Ricardo Da Silva (guitar, vocals) and Ica Quintela (keys, vocals, percussion), along with Australians Jordan Buck (bass), Oscar Ellery (sitar, guitars), Eddie Hannemann (drums), and Hannah Yates (vocals). And they love their umlauts, this band…their debut album from 2021 is entitled S​Ü​N. Get that and other fine Sons of Zoku products from Copper Feast Records or their Bandcamp page.\n\nFinally, let’s be clear…Schizomusica readers may remember a band called The Chemistry Set from London, England. Now one of the Chemists, drummer-vocalist Dave McLean, is out with his sprawling, stunning interpretation of the 1969 Kaleidoscope song “Faintly Blowing.” McLean says the song was a Chemistry Set rehearsal staple but never recorded by the full band, so… “Faintly Blowing’ will be available April 1 as an 8-inch lathe-cut single from Fruits de Mer Records (only 100 copies, through a lottery of sorts, so sign up now!). Meantime, check out the fabulous video above, featuring brightly-colored images, exotic settings, and unnamed females (hair and clothing faintly blowing of course).\n\n* Cf. Frank Zappa, “Greggery Peccary”, 1978\n\nImage credits: psypost.org, tomatoflower.bandcamp.com, shadowshow-detroit.bandcamp.com, sonsofzoku.bandcamp.com, thestrangebrew.co.uk, giphy.com/reddit.com\n\nNext time around, the return of Tommy!\n\nStarting out in The Bronx and heading down to New Orleans (whoa, that’s a trip and we haven’t even started yet), meet Hurray for the Riff Raff—essentially Alynda Segarra plus band. Segarra was born in The Bronx, moved to New Orleans and formed Hurray for the Riff Raff in 2007. From their ninth studio album, The Past Is Still Alive, here’s the opening track, “Alibi”. Mostly an Americana affair, the song reveals Segarra’s NYC roots with the line “Marchin’ towards the East River Park / You told me your big secret on the FDR”. The album is out on February 23 on Nonesuch Records. Hurray!\n\nNow to Akron, Ohio, and singer-guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney—The Black Keys to you. Around since 2001, their twelfth album, Ohio Players, is comin’ out in April (on Nonesuch again, whaddya know), and from it here’s a nice slice of black ’n’ white boogie entitled “Beautiful People (Stay High)”. Check out the equally black ’n’ white lyric video featuring clips from a 1960 British film called Beat Girl (released in the U.S. as Wild for Kicks). You might recognize the young Oliver Reed in the plaid shirt—which was his actual role in the cast: “Plaid Shirt (Beat youth)”. But back to the song, one listen and you’ll be boppin’ back ’n’ forth just like Jennifer (Gillian Hills), Dave (Adam Faith) and Plaid Shirt.\n\nPortland, Oregon, is the next stop…and more Americana in the form of Steve Drizos, who’s been making music for some 27 years and has worked with everyone from Debbi Peterson of The Bangles to members of The Decemberists. Drizos’ second studio album, i love you now leave me alone (yup, all lower case and no, no, uh, commas, so…) just came out February 16 on Cavity Search Records (there’s a label name), and, may we present, among the commas, track #6, “katie”. A down home beauty of a song, “katie” features a real family-ish video, Drizos’ face getting painted up in the process. Find i love you now leave me alone, and related t-shirts, here.\n\nWhere to next but sunny (well, most of the time) California and the latest from veteran East Bay pop-punk trio Green Day, still Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tré Cool. The band is out with their fourteenth album, Saviors, released last month and packin’ a punch like it’s still 1994 (the year of their breakout record, Dookie). Fifteen tracks in all, but wait til ya hear #10, “Suzie Chapstick” (wait, remember her? Suzy Chaffee, the Olympic skier and ChapStick spokesperson in the 1970s?)…oh, the song…a perfect potpourri of power pop blending that Teenage Fanclub neo-pop sound with, what, The Beatles? Yup, that good, and just when it’s almost over, dig that final, band-bow-worthy chord. Best song of 2024 so far!\n\nOkay, what’s the best way to get to Sydney, Australia, ’cause next it’s Sydney group Middle Kids: guitarist-vocalist Hannah Joy, bassist Tim Fitz and drummer Harry Day. Their third album, Faith Crisis Pt 1, came out February 16 on the Lucky Number label, and features at the #9 position something called “Terrible News”. Don’t tell these folks “good news only”—this song bangs along with a Spector-worthy wall of sound and Joy yelling, “I’ll shout it til you hear me out!”. And what’s up with that video of a guy running in slo-mo through graffitied streets with a rolled-up newspaper—most likely containing nothing but terrible news. Second-best song of 2024!\n\nHop on the first flight to Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and say “dag” to The Klittens: Yaël Dekker, Katja Kahana, Michelle Geraerts, Winnie Conradi and Laurie Zantinge. Their latest self-released EP, Butter, is out March 8, and from it here’s “Atlas,” an infectious bit of indie-rock that brings to mind Suzanne Vega singing (so no, they don’t sing in Dutch) with your favorite DIY band in your favorite bedroom studio. The Klittens have been around since 2020, creating music ranging from “dark post-punk to danceable songs about grandmas,” as they say on their Bandcamp page. Grab one of the limited edition of 300 white vinyl copies of Butter here!\n\nAcross the channel we go to the U.K., and straight to the great, gritty Brit-rock-post-punk epicenter of Manchester, where who should we encounter but Oasis vocalist Liam Gallagher and Stone Roses guitarist John Squire! In a brilliant Mancunian move, these two have teamed up for an album due for release on March 1, so now please have a listen to the second single to come out pre-album: a perfect piece of prime Brit-pop called “Mars to Liverpool”. Elements from the ’60s to the ’90s combine with Gallagher’s unmistakable wide-mouthed delivery and Squire’s flawless guitar work for one of the best songs to come out of Britain this year.\n\nSo just a short train trip down to London town, and blues guitarist-singer-songwriter Bex Marshall, who sounds more like the U.S. heartland than the U.K. capital city. With a soulful, Janis Joplin-meets-Bonnie Raitt (both major influences) drawl and tastefully melancholy guitar, “5AM,” the lead single and track #4 from forthcoming album Fortuna, pulls ya in and won’t let go, so that after the song’s 4:34 time is up, it’s like it just started. Marshall is backed by a slew of musical veterans who’ve worked with superstars like Tina Turner, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, George Clinton, Elton John, Sting and Taj Mahal, among others. Fortuna is due out March 1 and you can pre-order it now from Bex’s website.\n\nWell, we’ve reached the end of this New Music excursion, and where are we anyway? Wherever the artist Veronesa is from, that’s where. First line of the song is “Saturday in L.A.”, so maybe there? Not too much information is available about Veronesa, but the song “Sweet” popped up recently among YouTube video suggestions, and what a song it is. Vocal stylings of Amy Winehouse and lovely, liquid-y guitar work over a sexy-funky beat and lines like “I got so many in’s / I got so many out’s” add up to a real runaway hit! Until we find out the who, what, when, where about Veronesa (there are a couple of other tunes on YouTube), in the meantime, enjoy the “Sweet”-ness…\n\nImage credits: clinicagomezpastor.com, amazon.com, stereogum.com, cardcow.com, stevedrizos.com, americanheritageusa.com, en.wikipedia.org, amandafromseattle.com, middlekids.bandcamp.com, simplyamsterdam.nl, clickrollboom.co.uk, amazon.co.uk, brooklynvegan.com, hippostcard.com, soundcloud.com/thebexmarshall, youtube.com, reverbnation.com, giphy.com/reddit.com\n\nNext time, Tomato Flower, Shadow Show, Sons of Zoku…State of Psychedelia anyone?\n\nHere at Schizomusica, the loose definition of the term has always been something like: a wide range of music, from one extreme to the other, often combining genres that don’t really go together. This time let’s focus on another aspect: taking music and having insane fun with it, sometimes bending it out of shape so that it barely resembles music anymore. Ready? Didn’t think so, but we’re goin’ for it anyway…history’s acute cases of Schizomusica!\n\n1930 — The Marx Brothers\n\nBack in the 1930s, the NYC-born comical genius brothers Groucho, Harpo and Chico Marx appeared in something like fourteen films—most of the pictures including segments highlighting Harpo at the harp and Chico’s unconventional but masterful piano playing. Check out this crazy scene featuring the mostly-self-taught Marx’s at their most maniacal, from the 1930 release Animal Crackers:\n\n1945 — Spike Jones\n\nComedian and bandleader Lindsey Armstrong “Spike” Jones and His City Slickers recorded outlandish spoofs of popular songs and classical pieces during the 1940s and 50s, punctuating them with cartoonish yells and wacky sound effects after a tame and seemingly “normal” intro. Get a load of this trouncing treatment of the Mills Brothers’ standard “You Always Hurt the One You Love” from 1945:\n\n1961 — John Coltrane and free jazz\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, during the heyday of jazz icons like Miles Davis and John Coltrane, some composers and performers were finding themselves limited by the established formats and sounds of jazz, and, led by greats like Ornette Coleman, took their avant-garde improvisations to new, unheard-of, dissonant and screeching heights—as Coltrane and his cohorts demonstrate here:\n\n1962 — Allan Sherman\n\nSong parodist and television producer Allan Sherman had a hit in 1963 with “Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp),” but the previous year his debut album, My Son, the Folk Singer, was unleashed—and ends with this masterpiece of Jewish humor, a madcap medley that desecrates nearly a dozen beloved old songs, entitled “Shticks and Stones”:\n\n1969 — Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band\n\nNo retrospective of musical insanity would be complete without this guy. Between 1967 and 1982 Don Van Vliet, a.k.a. Captain Beefheart, and his ever-changing Magic Band put out twelve albums, with 1969’s Trout Mask Replica regarded as the crown jewel. Produced by California classmate and fellow musical nut Frank Zappa, the double album definitely stretches the boundaries of music to the breaking point. Here we have one of the record’s most bizarre moments, “Neon Meate Dream of a Octafish”:\n\n1975 — Lou Reed’s Metal Machine Music\n\nLeave it to the late, great Lou Reed…founder of the enigmatic Velvet Underground in the mid-1960s and a successful solo act with the album Transformer and single “Walk on the Wild Side” in the early ’70s. In 1975 he dropped a real enigma entitled Metal Machine Music. A full album—in fact, a double album—of what, noise? Critics and casual listeners alike had a field day describing it, calling it everything from “ear-wrecking electronic sludge” (Rolling Stone) to “four sides of unlistenable oscillator noise” (Trouser Press). Please listen to “Part 1” (or don’t):\n\n1981 — Flipper’s “Sex Bomb”\n\nSan Francisco’s post-hardcore-punk band Flipper put this single together in 1981 and it was an immediate hit (well in post-hardcore-punk circles anyway). With a repetitive bass line and—let’s call them minimal—lyrics (basically just “Sex bomb baby, yeah!” ad infinitum), plus chaotic sound effects like car crashes, sirens and police radios, “Sex Bomb” was perfect at full blast in headphones at 6:00 a.m. in order to wake up for an early morning job (true story—such a musical masochist). Here ya go:\n\n2010 and beyond — Japanese female metal\n\nNow there’s a genre. Okay, maybe this goes back to the first definition, but…beginning around 2010 with the band Babymetal, young Japanese women have been churning out crunchy, high-speed rock like it’s no big deal. Also known as kawaii metal, the formula calls for a “kawaii” (“cute”) appearance combined with blistering heavy rock, resulting in dozens of such bands with names like Lovebites, Band-Maid, Mary’s Blood, Nemophila, Scarlet Lotus, Doll$Boxx, Anarchy Stone,… Take your pick, but as arguably the best representatives of kawaii metal in 2024, may we present…Band-Maid:\n\nSo as long as no one develops a cure anytime soon, who knows what new symptoms lie ahead…\n\nImage credits: getintothis.co.uk, discogs.com, grammy.com, bandmaidshop.com, en.wikipedia.org, ebay.com, walmart.com, giphy.com/Maudit\n\nNext time around, the first New Music Roundup of 2024\n\nWild Nothing – “Dial Tone”\n\nWelcome to the 21st, where band names often pertain to one-person “indie music projects” rather than actual “bands.” Such is the case with Virginia-based multi-instrumentalist Jack Tatum, who goes by the moniker Wild Nothing. Fourteen years after “forming” Wild Nothing, Tatum is out with his fifth full-length album, Hold, featuring in its center at track number six, a scintillating slice of sophisti-pop (yeah, the new genre) called “Dial Tone.” Get lost in the sweeping guitars and gorgeous backing vocals that drive the anti-TMI sentiment of the chorus: “I don’t need to know / Everything you’ve been up to / I just need to hear / You tell me ‘I want you’”. Hold has been out since October 27, 2023 on the Captured Tracks label, and you can grab it here. Meanwhile check out the “official visualizer” (or music video to those of us who remember something called MTV):\n\nCatbells – “Same as You”\n\nNew England-raised Catbells (no first/last name in the background here, just Catbells) has been creating music since 2021, and on October 27, 2023 (popular date!) released her debut album, Partly Cloudy, on SQFT Records. And from that record, again deep in the center at track seven (or opener on Side B for vinyl people), it’s “Same as You.” Fans of 1990s dream-pop like Mazzy Star will delight in Partly Cloudy‘s mostly “sad girl bedroom pop”—but “Same as You” stands out as more upbeat with its bouncy beat and ringing guitars, while still being…uh, sad girl bedroom pop. The song and album were produced by Billy Mohler at his Long Beach, California studio, with everything written and performed by singer-songwriter-multi-instrumentalist Catbells. “Same as You” first appeared two years ago, and here’s the cute, cat-mask-themed video:\n\nThe Small Square – “Insta”\n\nFor those who take their music powerful and poppy, welcome to The Small Square’s sophomore album, Ours & Others—ten tracks with this one, the curiously-titled “Insta,” firmly planted at number seven. Kicking off with a brief shot of tremolo-guitar, “Insta” slides straight into 2:48 minutes of Big-Star-meets-Raspberries heaven courtesy of Paul Chastain (Velvet Crush’s main guy) and John Louis Richardson. Both have worked with a real who’s-who list of 1980s-90s power-pop including Matthew Sweet, Mitch Easter, Susanna Hoffs, Tommy Keene, the Gin Blossoms, and the Shoes…and even older dudes like Roger McGuinn and Badfinger’s Joey Molland. Ours & Others came out October 31 on Farm to Label Records, and “Insta” jumps right out with that title—what’s it referring to, Instagram most likely? The present-day culture of instantaneous everything, let’s say. Here’s the (official?) video:\n\nJosephine Network – “Valerie”\n\nSo we go from solo artist-projects, to a veteran duo, to…a good old-fashioned band! Well, not that old-fashioned…frontperson-singer-songwriter-guitarist Josephine and her Network—bassist Toni Lynn DeBuono, drummer Nat Brower, guitarists Dorian DeAngelo and Keith Cayea, keyboardist Jay Pluck, and backing vocalists-percussionists Saara Untracht-Oakner and Max Hiersteiner—have been described as a “queer glam rock band,” performing at events like the “Queerly Beloved” LGBT Film Festival at Brooklyn’s Fort Greene Park as well as sold-out shows across the U.S. Have a listen to their latest, “Valerie,” self-released November 17, with guitar runs galore that are more reminiscent of ’70s album rock than glam. Elements of Eric Clapton and Dickey Betts trade places with—what, Supertramp-styled synths and sweet singing by a self-professed New York diva whose main influences are Lou Reed and Carole King. Schizomusica is alive and well! And have a look at the music video directed by Dylan Mars Greenberg:\n\nThe Libertines – “Run Run Run”\n\nIt was the “Coolest Song of the Week” last week on Little Steven’s Underground Garage (Sirius XM Channel 21), and it’s certainly one of the coolest songs of the year. It’s “Run Run Run” by the Libertines, who have been making punked-up music since 1997. Formed in London by guitarist-vocalists Carl Barât and Pete Doherty, along with bassist John Hassall and drummer Gary Powell (all four still comprising the band in 2023), the Libertines have released three albums to date. A fourth, entitled All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade, is due out next March, and features “Run Run Run” as the opener. After a Clash-Ramones-ish intro and borrowing a line from Lesley Gore (“It’s my party and I’ll cry if I want to”), the song explodes into a sonic wall of raucous garage-punk up there with the best of the Damned and the Buzzcocks, with a brilliant, sing-along Cockney chorus. You can pre-order All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade from the band’s website, but in the meantime, the video:\n\nImage credits: wildnothingct.bandcamp.com, catbells.bandcamp.com, thesmallsquare.bandcamp.com, youtube.com, genius.com, giphy.com/hallmarkecards.com\n\nNext, the big list! But, uh-oh, here comes 2024…"
