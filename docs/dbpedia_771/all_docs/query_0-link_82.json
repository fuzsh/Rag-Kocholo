Don Dixon produced subsequent demos for the band, including some of the tracks included in this collection.\n\nCURIOUS?These guys remind me of the Long Ryders, but with more passion and a spirit of abandon that I like.

A long cold winter at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, was the void from which this inexperienced and enthusiastic band was hurled. Playing everywhere from colleges to the chicken wired stages of the South, they found themselves popular by the mid-'80s. Jeffrey Dean Foster, Tim Fleming, and Stephen J. Dubner held it together through a parade of drummers including the rock solid Whitey Foster (brother of Mr. Foster). Jon P. Wurster from Pennsylvania, having written cryptic yet amusing fan letters to the band, seemed the natural choice for the bands permanent drummer. He was relieved from his job at the toothpaste factory and shipped down south.\n\nThe Right Profile toured up and down the east coast opening shows for many mid-'80s rock heroes including The Del Fuegos, the Del Lords,and Jason & The Nashville Scorchers. After Clive Davis of Arista Records left his limo long enough to see the band at CBGB's in NYC, The Right Profile signed a record deal with Arista Records in the summer of 1986. Arista was at one time home to many of the bands favorites, including Patti Smith, Graham Parker, and The Kinks. But the many Barry Manilow gold records in the hallways should have been a foreshadowing of the train wreck ahead.\n\nAfter moving to New Jersey and recording numerous demos with many producers they finally made it back down south to record with the legendary Jim Dickinson in the summer of 1987. Stephen J. Dubner left the band and guitar-wiz Eric Peterson accompanied the band to Ardent Studios in Memphis to record with Dickinson. After these sessions proved unsuccessful, it pretty much was all over but the crying.\n\nNone of the many recordings of this era of The Right Profile have ever been released. Some earlier recordings done by Mitch Easter and Don Dixon have seen the light of day. The early 3 song EP Let’s Pretend was released on Vibratune Records in the fall of 1983. The Dixon-produced sessions piqued major label interest and the song “Cosmopolitan Lovesick Blues” was later released on the European compilation LP, Welcome to Comboland.\n\nFUN FACT: Stephen Dubner from this band is the same Stephen J. Dubner who co-authored the best-selling Freakonomics(and a host of related books, syndicated public radio segments, etc.)\n\nLearn more about The Right Profile at\n\nthe NC Music History blog\n\n↧\n\nBig Bottom - a bit too big??\n\nWith all due respect to Spinal Tap and their classic song \"Big Bottom,\" I need to ask you, dear blog readers, about a different kind of bottom:\n\nthe bass frequencies on the music you download from here.\n\nI keep noticing that after I do eq work on music files to bring out the bottom end on some of the music I share here, it often sounds too bass-heavy when I play the same music on my car stereo.\n\nI usually do the eq and related work using ... (gasp, shock, horror!) Apple earbuds. As you might know, there's not much bass response in those things. So I must be adding too much on the bottom end, but I don't realize it until I play the music on a decent stereo.\n\nANYONE ELSE NOTICING THIS?\n\nIf so, leave a comment here,\n\nand I'll try to avoid this problem in future posts...\n\n↧\n\nTwo Pound Planet - Demos & Outtakes Collection\n\nDemos & Outtakes\n\n(various locations)\n\n1991 – 1994\n\nstudio recordings (sound quality range: VG+ to Ex-; all of these are in the “very listenable” category; the more polished ones could be released commercially)\n\nJoin the intriguing discussion re: is this or is this not\n\na giant snuggie at the band's new Facebook page\n\nREPERCUSSION:Mitch Easter is strongly connected to this band as producer. Here’s what AllMusic writer Dave Sleger said in his review of the group’s only full length album, Songs From the Hydrogen Jukebox: Two Pound Planet is “one of the few Mitch Easter-produced bands that escaped widespread recognition, Two Pound Planet released this stylishly packaged independent masterpiece.... From Winston-Salem, NC, this power pop quartet combines Beatlesque hooks and harmonies with Elvis Costello-like quirkiness and the deadpan delivery of the Kinks. While Easter is presumed to be the genius behind their songs and arrangements, Two Pound Planet are responsible for their own sound. Easter hopped aboard after being blown away by their demos.” (AMG rating: 4 out of 5 stars)\n\nROB SEZ:If the above recommendation isn’t enough, then take it from me.

It wasn't completed because it was decided it was too heavy for the record. I finished it in my home studio. This eventually ended up being recorded by Slawterhaus 5.\n\n02 The Harbour Song (outtake) - Recorded for An Assassination of Someone You Knew, but left off because it just didn't fit. No one liked the telephone except me. The guitar solo is Jerry Chapman.\n\n03 Before You Left (Solid State EP) - I always liked this version. Jamie Hoover changed the bass line and I re-recorded the riff on 12-string for the Assassination version. Real drums were added as well.\n\n04 The Passion of the Stars (Solid State EP) - This demo sounds more powerful than the final. Funny that. We used almost all of this on the final, just added real drums.\n\n05 I Believe (Pulltoy \"produced\" version) - This was Chris Myers - Bass, Myself - Guitar and Rich Rothermel - Drums. What I refer to as my first real Power Pop song. We'd done a live rehearsal release for mp3.com and the engineer David Roland wanted to re-record a few songs. We brought in Jerry Chapman (Two Pound Planet) to produce. Pulltoy was the band that became Neidermeyer. Rich Rothermel mysteriously passed away not long after this recording. Chris and I got together with Art Gormley (guitar) and Scot Mejan (drums) to just goof around to celebrate Rich and the band was formed. The FOR THOSE ABOUT TO POP (Neidermeyer) album is dedicated to Rich.\n\n06 Astronaut (Pulltoy \"produced\" version) - Another song from this session. You can hear Rich singing the high part on \"President\". Jerry and Chris are singing the other background parts and Jerry played tambourine I believe. I made two failed attempts at re-recording this song. This one always leaves a lump in my throat.\n\nTRACKS 07-11 INFO: The Saving Graces live set, The Garage, Winston-Salem, N.C. Feb. 1, 2003 (The Saving Graces opening for The Shazam). Michael Slawter - Guitar, Vocals, Drew Jenkins - Bass, Jay Manley - Guitar, and John Holoman - Drums. (Engineered by Robert Kirk for Treehouse Mobile.)\n\n07 Girl Automatic (live) - Probably the best live version of this song. We always had a problem getting it right live. The crowd response at the end was little jarring. I was not expecting that.\n\n08 The Things That Make You Strange (live) - My attempt at a Nuggets-style 60's rave up.\n\n09 I Belong to the Jetset World (live) - A song that would eventually end up on Outside Guiding Lights. This lineup would play steady for over a year then record live at Jamie Hoover's studio for OGL.\n\n10 What She Wants (live) - This was always our closer. This eventually ended up being recorded by Slawterhaus 5. Sorry about the F-bomb. I was just very excited.\n\n11 Ever Fallen In Love (live) - I've always been a huge Buzzcocks fan, though Magazine has had a more lasting effect.\n\n12 Any Other Way (Posies cover) - Recorded for The Posies tribute but was not chosen?!?! John Holoman - Drums, Myself - Everything Else.\n\n13 Beth (Kiss cover) - Recorded for the About A Girl tribute. Ended up on a bonus CD. Always the bridesmaid. This is myself and Jamie Hoover. All the strings are from a Proteus II (which is what Andy Partridge used on the Apple Venus record). I tried to contact Peter Criss and Gene Simmons.
