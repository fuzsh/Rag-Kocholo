        "text": "This is my first encounter with the Lone Star Wind Orchestra and I must say they are very impressive indeed [Converging Cultures, NAXOS]. The opening track, Turina’s attractive La Procession del Rocio just about sums them up. The level of technical execution is stunning with tight ensemble work and impeccable intonation. This technical excellence is supported tonally by a very well rounded full and glowing sound that has an impressive bottom end.\n\nVery seldom does a concert have the power to make everyone involved a better musician and person. This was one of those uniquely special events [Midwest Clinic 2012 performance in Chicago]. The musicality and level of commitment demonstrated by everyone was nothing short of fantastic.\n\nPeople come to the Midwest Clinic to be inspired, renewed and reminded about the importance of quality music making. Needless to say, you [Lone Star Wind Orchestra] delivered all of these (and more) in first-class fashion! Please continue to set the bar mighty high for all of us! Thank you many times over! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!\n\nIt was phenomenal and the LSWO concert was something I absolutely ADORED! The first song caught my ear like “love at first sight” because the whole orchestra played so well together. The french horns and oboes were perfectly tuned and sounded amazing!\n\nThe concert was mind-blowing! The LSWO was the best band I have ever seen and I LOVED it! The bassoons and trombones really made the LSWO shine! I didn’t hear one mistake and thanks for letting me be a Lone Star Kid!"
