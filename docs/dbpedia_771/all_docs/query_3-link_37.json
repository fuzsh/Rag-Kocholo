        "text": "The Small Square “The Small Square”\n\nPaul Chastain (Velvet Crush, Matthew Sweet) and John Louis Richardson (Tommy Keene, Gin Blossoms, Joey Molland/Badfinger) combined to form this powerful duo, with an equally powerful debut album.\n\nStarting with the understated “So Low,” it mixes roots-pop styles, but the hooks keep you engaged. The layered epic “Dream Fake (Open Your Heart)” has that tight composition; verses build up in anticipation of the rich chorus. Paul’s earthy, low vocals are in contrast to the rising riffs here. Quiet moments like “SML” which stands for “you saved my life,” and “After The Tears” have an unmistakable Big Star feel. But the quiet yields to the standout layered guitar textures of “Otherwhile” and the churning melody of “Five Nine Song.” These are great tunes that deserve more attention.\n\nSome songs go in different stylistic directions (“Wrong,” “The Trip/Sorry Again”), like melodic chaos, but it doesn’t fail to encourage repeat listens. Fans of The Velvet Crush, Posies, Matthew Sweet, and classic rock will warm to this debut quickly. Highly Recommended.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Small Square (2023 Remaster) by The Small Square\n\nRinehearts “Full Bloom”\n\nPerth power poppers Rinehearts had the good fortune to work on the new recordings with none other than legendary musician, songwriter, and producer Dom Mariani (The Stems/DM3/The Some Loves/Datura4). Mariani, who called Rinehearts “that rare band you come across from time to time, doing their thing without a lot of fuss, but with true dedication and a knack for crafting perfect pop.”\n\nBenny Ward (guitar/vocals), Mitch Long (bass), and Ross Di Blasio (drummer) take no prisoners with its raucous opener “Goodness,” and doesn’t let its foot off the gas with “Power Lines” another jangly, up-tempo winner. This is vintage power pop done right, and even the melodic harmonies “Call Me Up” have a late 70s aura, with a solid guitar break akin to The Hudson Brothers. The album’s middle has more contemplative jangling love songs “Falling Down” and “Could You Would You” which are akin to Scotland’s Dropkick. Just when things get calm, “I Don’t Mind” comes back with a rocking chorus. Almost every song hits the mark, and this needs to be considered among the best albums for my 2023 list. Super Highly Recommended!\n\nAmazon"
