        "text": "Album: Crashing The Ether\n\nYear: 2006\n\n. . .\n\nFast-forward another decade. Not that Tommy Keene hadn’t been working the entire time: there was 1998’s Isolation Party , a live album, Showtunes — which I never heard — in 2000 and 2002’s The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down, which contained a 16-minute song called “The Final Hour.” It was all good stuff, but I didn’t come out of those records with any favorite songs.\n\nHowever, in 2006, Keene released Crashing the Ether, which was recorded by Keene pretty much on his own in his home studio — with some help from long-time drummer John Richardson and to me, it was his best record since Ten Years After, because he used the best guitarist he could find to play with: Tommy Keene.\n\nAnd so a song like “Warren in the 60’s” — ostensibly about Warren Beatty, whose fingertips Woody Allen once joked he wished he could be reincarnated as — is a melange of electric guitars swirling around each other, some chugging, others jangling.\n\nHey watch your back\n\nYou know what they said about Dean\n\nI hear your song\n\nAll the boys and girls sing along\n\nA dream about a former life\n\nThey wish they had known Warren in the 60’s\n\nWhile it might be Richardson on the drums, the drum part is eccentric enough that it might be Keene himself, playing them. It’s definitely Keene on the harmonica solo, which takes place right where you’d expect the guitar solo to be, but “Warren The 60’s” doesn’t have one, but it does have some lovely stacked vocal arrangement on the outro — Keene singing with and against himself — adding yet another layer of loveliness to the proceedings.\n\n“Warren in the 60’s”\n\n“Warren in the 60’s” Live in Chicago, 2006\n\nDid you miss a Certain Song? Follow me on Twitter: @barefootjim, or Bluesky @barefootjim any of the other 4,876,987 social media platforms that exist.\n\nThe Certain Songs Database\n\nA filterable, searchable & sortable somewhat up to date database with links to every “Certain Song” post I’ve ever written.\n\nCheck it out!\n\nCertain Songs Spotify playlist\n\n(It’s recommended that you listen to this on Spotify as their embed only has 200 songs.)"
