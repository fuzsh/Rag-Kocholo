        "text": "The University of Texas Longhorn Alumni Band Charitable Fund Scholarship Program\n\nContributions to the Longhorn Alumni Band Charitable Fund provide funding for scholarships awarded to deserving Longhorn Band students. Contributions are tax deductible under IRS provisions 501 (c)(3). Individuals making substantial, sustained, or unique contributions are recognized at the annual Band Day meeting.\n\nAlthough the Charitable Fund no longer maintains its own Donor Recognition Awards Program, our partners in UT Development work diligently to recognize and honor donors of all levels who contribute to various needs of the Longhorn Band and its students.\n\nMany Longhorn Band alumni and friends have established Named Scholarships to honor former band members, loved ones, or others who share or shared their passion for the Showband of the Southwest. If you are interested in learning more about how to establish Named Scholarships or an honorary endowment for a specific purpose, including planned giving or pledged contributions over time, please contact Jen’ai James at jjames@austin.utexas.edu or Gina Hollis at gina.hollis@austin.utexas.edu.\n\nLonghorn Alumni Band Scholarships are paid out of funds provided by permanent endowments established by The Longhorn Alumni Band Charitable Fund with The University of Texas. These scholarships are awarded using criteria established in gift agreements between the LHABCF and UT.\n\nWhen an LHB student is awarded a band scholarship, whether it was established by LHAB or one of our alumni, the funds are paid from the endowment into the student’s financial aid package as defined by federal law. These funds may be applied directly against tuition, fees, housing, or other expenses paid out of whatever financial aid package the student has.\n\nAs a result, some students will be required to pay less out of pocket, while others will see a significant reduction in the amount they have to borrow using student loans. Students with the greatest need may have a financial aid package that includes other grants and awards that meet all the student’s financial needs. In those rare cases, the student will not receive a check directly for the scholarship amount, but rather the funds become part of a comprehensive package that covers the full cost of their education at U.T.\n\nSadly, the number of students whose needs are fully met comprises approximately 4% of LHB members who receive band scholarships. Our organization is committed to raising additional money to help meet the needs of more LHB students and provide additional support for the LHB and its members.\n\nScholarship Types\n\nGeneral Scholarships\n\nCurrently, the largest part of our scholarship program remains the Longhorn Alumni Band General Scholarship Fund, which provides scholarships to LHB members based upon their leadership and contributions to LHB, their academic achievements, and financial need. Unless designated otherwise, all contributions to the Charitable Fund are placed in a permanent endowment that supports these scholarships.\n\nThe Alumni Band Charitable Fund Board of Trustees works to solicit and maintain support of all types for the Longhorn Band and its students, but the largest and most important part of this program is our ongoing goal of providing a scholarship to every student in the Longhorn Band. As of Fall 2019, close to 1/3 of all students in the Longhorn Band received a band-related scholarship, and LHAB remains committed to its long-term goal of eventually extending this support to all LHB members.\n\nHonorary and Memorial Scholarships\n\nThe following scholarships were endowed through the LHAB Charitable Fund prior to partnering with UTIMCO at the University of Texas in 2017\n\nThe Carl T. Widen Memorial Scholarship\n\nCarl Widen was a member of the original Longhorn Band in 1900, and until his death in 1985 at the age of 101, was the oldest living graduate of The University of Texas. He was an active member of the Longhorn Alumni Band and gave generously to the scholarship fund. He was a founding member of the Austin Symphony, the Founders Lions Club of Austin, and a former school board president. Mr. Widen worked at all times to advance both music and education programs in the community. The Alumni Band is proud to keep his name at the forefront of excellence, not only with the Carl T. Widen Scholarship but also with our support of the Carl T. Widen Elementary School through the Austin Partners in Education Program. Mr. Widen was the embodiment of the Longhorn Band’s spirit of determination and excellence. In recognition of this, his name is immortalized by the presentation of an annual scholarship to the Longhorn Band member judged to have displayed the highest achievement in scholarship, musicianship, and leadership.\n\nThe General D. Harold Byrd Memorial Scholarship\n\nGeneral D. Harold Byrd was born in 1900 and died in 1986. He was an entrepreneur, civic leader, and philanthropist. A successful pioneer in Texas oil, he shared his wealth with The University of Texas and the Longhorn Band for over 50 years. He was honorary president of Longhorn Band, honorary lifetime member of the Longhorn Alumni Band and a Distinguished Alumnus of the University of Texas. He is fondly remembered for his giving spirit and loyalty to The University and the band he loved. The Alumni Band feels that the current members of the Longhorn Band can best select the recipient of the Byrd scholarship. The members of Longhorn Band have chosen a fellow member who demonstrates these same qualities of spirit and loyalty to both The University of Texas and the Longhorn Band.\n\nThe James Johnson Memorial Scholarship\n\nJames Johnson was born February 1st, 1962 and died January 7th, 1987. He graduated in 1980 from McCallum High School in Austin and earned his BS degree in Radio-Television and Film from UT. James was a 5-year member of the Longhorn Band, played French Horn and was member of KKY. The criteria for this special scholarship include academic excellence, involvement in Longhorn Band, and a demonstrated need for financial assistance.\n\nThe Jane and Vincent R. DiNino Honorary Scholarship\n\nVincent R. DiNino came to the University of Texas in 1955 as Director of Longhorn Bands. Affectionately known as “Mr. D”, his dynamic leadership influenced Longhorn Band members for his 20 years as director. A firm advocate of instrumental music education for all age levels, his mark on UT and the Longhorn Band exists today, as many of the sights and sounds that identify the Longhorn Band were his creations. The Longhorn Alumni Band and its scholarship program were ideas conceived by Mr. and Mrs. DiNino, together with four ex-LHB couples. Recently inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor, Mr. D — and Mrs. D — remain steadfast and loyal fans of the Longhorn Band. The scholarship in their honor goes to a Longhorn Band member with demonstrated leadership capabilities, enthusiasm for the Longhorn Band and a sound academic career.\n\nThe Moton H. Crockett Jr. Honorary Scholarship\n\nMoton Crockett graduated from Austin High School, entered the University of Texas, and joined the Longhorn Band in 1941. He was a classmate in high school and college of Curtis Popham, whose ring is worn by the Longhorn Band president. Mr. Crockett was Drum Major of the Longhorn Band and its Director from 1950-1955. In 1954, Mr. Crockett purchased Big Bertha from C.G. Conn for one dollar and brought her from Elkhart, Indiana to Austin, where he personally refurbished the big drum and presented her to the new Director, Vincent R. DiNino, in 1955. He initiated the current LHAB scholarship contribution recognition program during his term as President of the Longhorn Alumni Band, and was instrumental in establishing the LHAB Charitable Fund, serving as the first President of its Board of Trustees. Mr. Crockett continues to be an active member of the Alumni Band, and served as designated director from 1983-1994. He willingly shares his time, energy, skills and finances, most recently underwriting the restoration of Big Bertha. Mr. Crockett was one of four inaugural inductees into the Longhorn Band Hall of Honor in 1997.\n\nThe James Sims Honorary Scholarship\n\nDr. Jim Sims was a member of the Longhorn Band from 1963 to 1967. Dr. Sims was a member of the Clarinet and Flags sections, in addition to being a Section Leader and member of Kappa Kappa Psi.

Dunagan was President of LHAB 1966-67. He was the person that mentioned LHAB scholarships and passed his hat at a LHAB luncheon meeting, thus the program began. He was a cornet (trumpet) player in the band in the 20’s, wrote for The Daily Texan, promoted the band at all times. He designed the first LHAB stationery paying for many, many things in the early years of our existence out of his pocket. He was an insurance agent in Austin and a active member of the Shrine Band.
