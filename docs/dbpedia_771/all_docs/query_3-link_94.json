He also discussed the Love and Rockets tour opening for Janeâs Addiction (which kicks off this week) and a lot of very, very interesting esoterica.\n\n(The musical excerpts heard in the interview are from David Jâs albumÂ Tracks from the Attic)\n\nâ\n\nDig Deeper\n\nVisit David J atÂ davidjhaskins.comPurchase David JâsÂ Tracks from the AtticÂ fromÂ Independent Project Records,Â Qobuz, orÂ Bandcamp, and listen on yourÂ streaming platform of choiceFollow David J onÂ Patreon,Â Facebook,Â Instagram, andÂ Twitter (X)Love and Rockets (Bandcamp)The ultimate beginnerâs guide to BauhausShiva SavesDig into this episodeâs complete show notes atÂ spotlightonpodcast.comâ\n\nâ¢ Did you enjoy this episode?

As we arranged to get together, Ches suggested we includeÂ Shara Lunon, the transdisciplinary poet, vocalist, composer, and improviser featured on the album.\n\nLaugh AshÂ is one of the most intriguing records I have encountered in quite some time, with its mix of form and improvisation, acoustic and synthetic, quiet and explosiveness.\n\nIn addition to Ches and Shara, the album includes an all-star cast from todayâs creative music scene: flutist Anna Webber, clarinetist Oscar Noriega, tenor saxophonist James Brandon Lewis, trumpeter Nate Wooley, violinist Jennifer Choi, violist Kyle Armbrust, cellist Michael Nicolas, and bassist/keyboardist Shahzad Ismaily.\n\nIt is an exciting work and we had a great conversation.

The event, Improvisation in Music and Life, featured me in conversation with and performances by James Falzoneâs Division Ensemble.\n\nThe Division Ensemble is a group of master improvisers that includes James Falzone on clarinet, Ray Larsen on trumpet, Wayne Horvitz on piano, Abbey Blackwell on bass, and Rocky Martin on drums.\n\nDuring the live show, we explored the nature of improvisation in music and how its principles are relevant to all aspects of life. James and the band performed his compositions and a completely free, composed-in-the-moment piece.\n\nThe music in this episode:\n\nG.F.O.P.

See acast.com/privacy for more information.\n\nToday, the Spotlight shines On Modena, Italy-based sound artist and percussionistÂ Riccardo La Foresta.\n\nRiccardo has spent the last several years exploring the Drummophoneâan array of bass drums that create sound by being confronted with compressed air and which, in turn, produce complex acoustic drones. By combining the Drummophone with other electro-acoustic devices and changes in the air pressure in the room where it is set up, a generative system results, one that can create endless possibilities in sound.\n\nIn this engaging conversation, we discussed Riccardoâs musical journey, his experimentation in percussion, and his exploration of new techniques and approaches to drumming. We also got into the evolution of drums and percussion instruments, the influence of acoustics on composition, and the potential for drumming education in conservatory settings.\n\n(The musical excerpts heard in the interview are from Riccardo La Foresta & James Ginzburgâs albumÂ Six and Fortyâ-âSix)\n\nâ\n\nDig Deeper\n\nVisit Riccardo La Foresta atÂ riccardolaforesta.comPurchase Riccardo La Foresta & James GinzburgâsÂ Six and Fortyâ-âSixÂ onÂ QobuzÂ orÂ Bandcamp, and listen onÂ your streaming platform of choiceFollow Riccardo La Foresta onÂ InstagramÂ andÂ YouTubeRiccardo La Foresta: playing drums without playing (video)Drummophoneâs ManifestoThe Experimental Underbelly of Italian Electronic MusicRiccardo La Foresta: âCurating has taught me how to shareâDig into this episodeâs complete show notes atÂ spotlightonpodcast.comâ\n\nâ¢ Did you enjoy this episode?

He joined me earlier this year, around theÂ Sonar KollektivÂ release of his debut solo album,Â Circle Of Madness, a work that makes me glad I do not own a record store because I have no idea where I would file it. That said, it might not get filed at all because it would be playing all day.\n\nListeners will find jazz, improvisation, funk, some Berlin electronica, and moreâsometimes all in the same song. Genre is not important when the music is this compelling.\n\nJanek was as much fun to talk to as his record is to listen to. Please enjoy both.\n\n(The musical excerpts heard in the interview are from Janek van Laakâs albumÂ Circle Of Madness)\n\nâ\n\nDig Deeper\n\nPurchase Janek van LaakâsÂ Circle Of MadnessÂ onÂ QobuzÂ orÂ Bandcamp, and listen on yourÂ streaming platform of choice.Follow Janek van Laak onÂ InstagramA Music Loverâs Guide to BerlinRhythm and Raga: Learn the basics of Indian musicWhat Makes John Bonham Such a Good Drummer?Liquid Brain Orchestra on SoundCloudThe 15 Loudest Bands in the WorldJanek van Laak: Fifteen Questions about DrummingDig into this episodeâs complete show notes atÂ spotlightonpodcast.comâ\n\nâ¢ Did you enjoy this episode?

See acast.com/privacy for more information.\n\nToday, the Spotlight shines On Seattle pianist and composer Bill Anschell.\n\nWeâve had award winners of all types on the podcast, but as far as I can remember, Bill is the first to have won an award for humor: in 2014, Bill was the winner of the inaugural Paul Desmond Award, the website All About Jazzâs celebration of the funniest jazz artists. We get to that and his satirical essay, âCareers in Jazz,â which is the all-time most-read piece on All About Jazz.\n\nAs a much younger man, Bill left Seattle to study at Oberlin College and Wesleyan University. At Wesleyan, he worked with saxophone great Bill Barron and South Indian mridangam master T Ranganathan, developing an affinity for diverse and interesting rhythms that can be heard throughout his work.\n\nIn Atlanta, Bill served as Jazz Coordinator for the Southern Arts Federation, the Southâs regional arts agency. While building their jazz program, Bill made time to publish a book on grant writing and created JazzSouth, a syndicated radio show heard on more than 200 stations around the world. And he worked as a sideman around town and led his own trio. Bill is a celebrated composer and his tunes have been heard in shows like The West Wing, NCIS: LA, The Wire, and Yellowstone.\n\nOur talk touched on the evolution of jazz, the impact and legacy of fusion music, the integration of electronic music into jazz, Billâs time in Atlanta, his potential upcoming projects, and more.\n\n(The musical excerpts heard in the interview are from Bill Anschellâs album Improbable Solutions)\n\nâ\n\nDig Deeper\n\nVisit Bill Anschell at billanschell.comPurchase Bill Anschellâs Improbable Solutions from billanschell.com or Qobuz, and listen to it on your streaming platform of choiceFollow Bill Anschell on Instagram and FacebookTop Five Funniest People In JazzCareers In Jazz - Bill AnschellDig into this episodeâs complete show notes at spotlightonpodcast.comâ\n\nâ¢ Did you enjoy this episode?
