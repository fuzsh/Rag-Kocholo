        "text": "Collectively, the duo that make up The Small Square have recorded and played with everyone from The Gin Blossoms and Tommy Keene to Velvet Crush and Matthew Sweet, so it should come as little surprise that their latest project, The Small Square, is a brilliant mix of power pop and laidback indie rock.\n\nOurs & Others, the sophomore offering from vocalist Paul Chastain and drummer, percussionist, and vocalist John Louis Richardson, builds perfectly from their self-titled, eight-year-old debut. Long before coming together as The Small Squares, Chastain and Richardson had known each other for years and traveled in the same musical circles. In fact, a major theme for the album revolves around the passing of longtime mutual friend and bandmate Tommy Keene. The album closes with the duo covering Keene’s 1993 “Baby Face.” Lyrically, the powerful “Can’t Let Go (Oh, Tommy)” also appears to be about the passing of Keene.\n\nThe record opens on “Twenty-Third,” a song that perfectly blends subtle piano with a driving guitar riff that lays out the template for the next nine tracks. What follows vacillates between ‘90s college rock and elements of power pop beautifully flaunting the impressive decades in the making resumes of both Chastain and Richardson.\n\nThe two co-produced the album, working at Richardson’s Drum Farm Studio in Wisconsin. They were able to bring in several great collaborators to fill out the sound including members of the brilliant classic Power Pop band Shoes. The album closes on the Keene cover, a song that would normally sound a bit like an outlier given the slow, somber tempo, contrasting with the other songs, but it works perfectly here."
