Miss Lewis shared her name, friendship, enthusiasm and expertise with The American Prize vocal contests as Judge Emerita, and earlier served as an adjudicator for the Friedrich Schorr Memorial Performance Prize in Voice international competitions.\n\nDavid Katz and Brenda Lewis were friends and colleagues at the Hartt School of the University of Hartford during the 1980s. In 2001, when Katz moved the Schorr Prize (which he had founded with Mrs. Friedrich Schorr's blessing ten years earlier) from Michigan back to Connecticut, he turned to Miss Lewis for her assistance. Then, as the Schorr contests became part of the newly-formed competition series known as The American Prize, Brenda Lewis gladly continued to provide her advice and enthusiastic support.\n\nMaestro Katz remembers:\n\n\"She was a magnificent musician, and a no-nonsense judge. As an opera director, she did not suffer fools onstage or off; she always knew instinctively (and through a lifetime of experience) what \"worked\" and what didn't, and was never afraid to say so. She could be cutting and tough on people she thought were not giving their all to the art, but she could also be very warm and funny: the hours I spent with her at her home in Westport are among my happiest musical memories, especially when the conversation turned to her dear friend, composer Marc Blitzstein. Her stories of her years at the MET and the New York City Opera would sometimes come accompanied with gales of laughter. I learned early that underneath her crust she was loving and generous...as I have found most great artists I have known to be. I will miss her very much. Farewell, Brenda, and thank you.\"\n\n***\n\nDistinguished American soprano, Brenda Lewis, is pleased to lend her name and expertise to The American Prize national competitions in the performing arts as its first Distinguished Judge Emerita.\n\nThe following biography of Miss Lewis is adapted from a longer version written by Lucy Cross of MasterworksBroadway.com, where the full version may be found.\n\nAfter attending the Curtis Institute, Brenda Lewis made her operatic debut with the Philadelphia Opera Company in the role of the Marschallin in Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier. She was nineteen years old.\n\nMiss Lewis's first Broadway appearance was in The Merry Widow (1944). After World War II, Brenda Lewis supplemented performances at the City Center Opera (The Bartered Bride, Faust, and The Gypsy Baron, Britten's The Rape of Lucretia), with gigs as a nightclub blues singer.\n\nBrenda Lewis attributes her early success to the fact that she could absorb music and words (in any language) almost on the spot: to learn the role of Marie in Wozzeck at the NY City Center Opera she took only three days, and once in 1945, when a scheduled soprano became indisposed, she learned Marguerite in Faust in twenty-four hours.\n\nBy 1949 Brenda Lewis was the Carmen, the Salome, and the Santuzza of choice at the City Opera. One night after a performance of Salome, American composer Marc Blitzstein and conductor Leonard Bernstein came backstage to congratulate her. In the course of the conversation, Blitzstein mentioned that the soprano role of Birdie in his new opera, Regina, (based on Lillian Hellman's play The Little Foxes) was still open. \"I felt that it was fated to be mine,\" said Lewis later. Regina came to the 46th Street Theatre in New York on October 31, 1949, and played to excited and uplifted audiences for 56 performances.\n\nBrenda Lewis made her debut with the Metropolitan Opera Company in 1952 in the role of Musetta in La BohÃ¨me, and followed it very shortly thereafter with Rosalinde in Die Fledermaus. Lewis appeared at the Met as Rosalinde, as Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni, Venus in TannhÃ¤user, Marie in Wozzeck, Marina in Boris Godunov, and as Carmen, Salome, and Vanessa. Yet she did not abandon Broadway â in 1954 she performed in The Girl in Pink Tights. She continued to sing with City Opera as well, taking on the central role of Regina in revivals of the Blitzstein opera, when the production was recorded for Columbia.\n\nIn the 1950s, Lewis toured with the Metropolitan Opera to leading American cities coast to coast and had comparable successes in her signature roles with regional opera companies in Pittsburgh, Central City, New Orleans, Boston, Montreal, Seattle, San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, and Chicago. Nor was she confined to the shores of North America: she went to Rio de Janeiro to sing Venus, Musetta, Santuzza, Marguerite, Marina, and Donna Elvira, and to Cuba to sing Santuzza.\n\nIn 1956 she was engaged at the Volksoper in Vienna, Austria, to star in the first gala full-scale European production of Cole Porter's Kiss Me, Kate. It was such a sensational success that she was asked to return the following season in Annie Get Your Gun, in the Ethel Merman role. She was subsequently invited to sing both these roles at the Zurich Opera in Switzerland, as well as Carmen and Salome.\n\nIn 1963, Lewis began a new career as producer and stage director for the New Haven Opera Company in Connecticut. She had not stopped performing, however. In 1965 Jack Beeson's Lizzie Borden, with Lewis in the title role, had its world premiere at the New York City Opera; it was filmed by WGBH in Boston and broadcast nationally.\n\nIn 1973, Lewis took on yet another role: as Professor of Voice and Opera at the Hartt School of Music at the University of Hartford, where her young assistant conductor for Britten's Albert Herring was David Katz, now chief judge of The American Prize. Inaugurating a new Musical Theater Program at Hartt, Miss Lewis's Die Fledermaus at the University of Hartford in 1989 was filmed for Connecticut Public TV and won a regional Emmy.\n\nJonathan Sternberg (1919-2018)\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\n(in memoriam)\n\nUPDATE: May 2018:\n\nThe American Prize National Nonprofit Competitions in the Performing Arts and chief judge David Katz mark with sadness and a true sense of loss the death of famed American conductor and important international conducting pedagogue, Jonathan Sternberg, who died May 8, 2018 at the age of 98.\n\nWhen David Katz first conceived of The American Prize more than tten years ago, Maestro Sternberg was one of the very first to heed the call for judges, serving as advisor and adjudicator to the contests for a number of seasons well into his tenth decade. âWhen The American Prize was in its infancy, Jonathan Sternberg was there, offering his advice, his expertise, and his time,â said Katz. âNow, literally thousands of contestants and nearly $100,000 in prizes later, The American Prize thanks Maestro Sternberg for his service and understanding, and for his belief in the TAP ideal before practically anyone else did. Godâs speed, Maestro, and with so many thanks. You will be sincerely missed, not only by us, but by artists around the world.â\n\n***\n\nThe American conductor, Jonathan Sternberg, was regarded by many as one of the most distinguished conductors appearing on the international podium; his performances having been unanimously acclaimed by critics, musicians and public alike from Berlin to Buenos Aires.\n\nJonathan Sternberg was born in New York of Austro-Russian parents. As a child he studied violin at the Institute of Musical Art (now the Juilliard School) in New York. He continued his musical and academic education at the Manhattan School of Music, New York University, receiving B.A. in 1939 with viola and musicology as principal subjects. He followed that by studies in musicology at NYU Graduate School and Harvard. During his undergraduate years, he was active as a New York critic for the Musical Leader of Chicago; he also attended rehearsals of the National Orchestral Association conducted by Leon Barzin, from whom he acquired his conducting technique. Apart from two later private sessions with Barzin (1946) and two summers (1946-1947) of conducting lessons with Pierre Monteux, he was self-taught.\n\nJonathan Sternberg began his professional career on Pearl Harbor Day, December 7, 1941, conducting the National Youth Administration Orchestra of New York in Copland's\" An Outdoor Overture\", before entering military service. At the end of the war he found himself in Shanghai where he took over the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra for a season.\n\nAfter returning briefly to the USA, Jonathan Sternberg moved to Vienna, making his conducting debut with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra in 1947. Then he toured extensively as a guest conductor in Europe, North America, and the Far East. He worked closely with the Haydn scholar H.C. Robbins Landon, scouring the libraries, monasteries and churches of Austria for lost manuscripts, until Robbins Landon set up the Haydn Society, for which Sternberg made a series of pioneering recordings, initially of Haydn and Mozart, not least the 'Nelson Mass', 'Posthorn' Serenade and some dozen Haydn symphonies.\n\nOther recording premiÃ¨res under Sternberg included Schubert's Second Symphony, Rossini's Stabat mater, Prokofiev's Fifth Piano Concerto, Milhaud's Fantaisie Pastorale and Charles Ives' Set of Pieces.\n\nJonathan Sternberg also began to present modern American music to European audiences that had heard little of such repertory. With the RIAS orchestra in Berlin he conducted the first European performances of a large number of American scores, including Leonard Bernstein's Serenade, Menotti's Violin Concerto and the Second Symphony of Charles Ives. With other orchestras, Sternberg conducted the first European performances of works by Barber, Copland, Diamond and Benjamin Lees. He was also responsible for a number of world premiÃ¨res, including Rorem's First Symphony (1951).\n\nAfter a year at the helm of the Halifax Symphony Orchestra (1957â1958), Jonathan Sternberg was Music Director and the Principal Conductor of the Royal Flemish Opera in Antwerp, Belgium for five years (1961-1966). In 1966 he returned to the USA to accept an appointment as the Musical Director and Principal Conductor of the Harkeness Ballet York. Some years later he was appointed musical director and conductor of the Atlanta Municipal Theater in charge of opera and ballet performances at the new Memorial Cultural Center, opening the new Atlanta Memorial Arts Center with the American stage premiÃ¨re of Purcell's King Arthur. Outstanding among his guest engagements have been the first European tour of the Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg, several all-Beethoven concerts with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in the Royal Festival Hall, appearances with L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande in Geneva, the Orchestre Lamoureux in Paris, the orchestras of Warsaw, Prague, Berlin, Munich, Stuttgart, Basel, Brussels, Monte Carlo, etc.\n\nAfter Atlanta, Jonathan Sternberg has divided his professional time with the academic world. He took up a visiting professorship of conducting at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York (1969-1971). On leaving he took up a similar position at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, where he taught and conducted for 20 years (1971-1989). Here, too, he conducted a number of world premiÃ¨res, including Music for Chamber Orchestra by David Diamond (1976), A Lincoln Address and Night Dances by Vincent Persichetti (1977) and Skrowaczewski's Ricercari notturni for three saxophones and orchestra (1978). From 1989 he has been a lecturer at Chestnut Hill College. In addition he has continued pursuing his career as guest conductor on five continents. In his 80s he was still active on the podium and as a lecturer. From 2004 to 2008 he he was Musical and Artistic Director of the Bach Festival of Philadelphia, sister Festival in the USA to Bachfest Leipzig.\n\nIn January 2009 Jonathan Sternberg received The Conductors Guild's Award for Lifetime Service in recognition of long-standing service to the art and profession of conducting.\n\nJudges of Instrumental Performance, Composition & Conducting\n\nLeonard Atherton, judge emeritus, (1941-2021)\n\nMuncie, IN\n\n(in memoriam)\n\nLeonard Atherton (instrumental performance, conducting) joined the Ball State University School of Music Faculty in 1982.
