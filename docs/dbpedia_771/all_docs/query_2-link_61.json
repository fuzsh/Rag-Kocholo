        "text": "July, 2024\n\nWe did something we never do – we appeared together to talk about what it’s like to have two writers in the house. We had the great pleasure of being interviewed by our neighbor, Tricia Rose Burt, on her wonderful podcast, No Time to be Timid. I’ve been a listener since she started. Tricia is a gracious host and a good listener. You get caught up in her enthusiasm for her guests and all those Southern “y’alls.” Listen at Apple Podcasts, https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/no-time-to-be-timid/id1619558493 or Spotify, or https://triciaroseburt.com/podcast/sy-montgomery-and-howard-mansfield-creating-a-writing-life\n\nPlease join me for a Zoom on July 18, 3 p.m. I’ll be interviewed by Scott Mansfield, my nephew, to discuss my new book I Will Tell No War Stories: What Our Fathers Left Unsaid About World War II. Scott makes a brief appearance in the book, and contributed some research about his grandfather. This Zoom is being run by the National Museum of American Jewish Military History.

Q: Hey Liz & Matt who are you wearing? A: Huh?\n\nMay, 2024\n\nThe initial print run sold out the first week. But the publisher is keeping Amazon stocked. If there’s a lapse, it’s only for a day or so.\n\nApril, 2024\n\nThanks to Mike Stanton for conducting his thoughtful interview at Books on the Square in Providence, RI. And once again thank you to everyone who shared their poignant stories of silent fathers, and of history discovered in the attic as they opened a trunk to discover Silver and Bronze Stars, Purple Hearts, and other hints of hidden history.\n\nI enjoyed talking to Jim Braude and Margery Eagan, hosts of GBH’s Boston Public Radio. Here’s what they said about I Will Tell No War Stories:\n\n“I don’t think I’ve read anything that conveys the brutality of war as powerfully as you do…. People may think this is just a terrific history book — which it is — but it’s also a cautionary tale for those of us who see sanitized pictures of a war. The universality of this book is totally there.”\n\n— Jim Braude, co-host, Boston Public Radio, on GBH\n\n“This was really a very moving book.”\n\n— Margery Eagan, Boston Public Radio, on GBH\n\nListen to the interview here: BPR full show 4/26: Beep-Beep, Toot-Toot. At the 1:14 mark you’ll hear the lead-in music. (14 minutes)\n\nAt readings, my book is bringing forth some intense discussions and memories of fathers who fought in the Battle of the Bulge, or in the Pacific, or were shot down and taken prisoner. They all came home and did not ever talk about the war.\n\nSixteen million Americans served in that war. There are today about 85,000 surviving WWII veterans. We have arrived at an inflection point, a time when remembering this war is left to us. Which monuments, which ceremonies will continue to have meaning? We’re thinking about that now.\n\nThank you to everyone who showed up, listened, and shared your stories.\n\nToday’s the pub date for my new book, I Will Tell No War Stories: What Our Fathers Left Unsaid About World War II. Read an excerpt and an interview in the Military Times, or Air Force Times, Army Times, Navy Times, and Marine Corps Times.\n\nA big thank you to Chet Atkins and Jessica Stern for hosting the book launch party for my new book, I Will Tell No War Stories, and to Mel Allen, editor of Yankee magazine, for interviewing me. It was a wonderful evening.\n\nSigning books after giving a talk at the annual meeting of Historic Harrisville.

Elizabeth Myer of the SALT Project is the Producer/Director of the documentary film that was shown on New Hampshire and Vermont Public Television. The film is based on the concert of music and words by Ben Cosgrove and Howard Mansfield.\n\nJanuary, 2023\n\nIt was a great honor and a joy to interview Heather Cox Richardson on stage as the Toadstool Bookshop welcomed Heather back to Peterborough. Thanks to Emerson Sistare and his great Toadstool staff, sound wizard Ben Rogers, Sarah Bauhan and Henry James from Bauhan Publishing, and ace filmmaker Oriana Camara. The video of the complete interview will be posted on YouTube.\n\nAnd here’s the link to the complete video of the on stage with Heather Cox Richardson. Here’s the link: http://tinyurl.com/ywkudktf\n\nNovember, 2023\n\nIt was a pleasure to return to the Infrastructure Junkies podcast for a third time to discuss “Who Sacrifices, Who Benefits, Who Decides?” In this Season 4 finale, I explore “The Last Medieval Claim” by recounting some of the earliest battles for American soil which occurred in the courts across the ocean, and involved people who never set foot in North America. Then the conversation turns to “The Pipeline in the Neighborhood” where the human effects of a massive infrastructure project are once again examined. My thanks to hosts Dave Arnold and Kristen Short Bennett. Listen here.\n\nSomething called PictureQuotes.com has posted two quotes from my books at their website. The first, above, is from Turn & Jump and the second, below, from In the Memory House. I know nothing about how these quotes were selected. It’s interesting to see what pops up online.\n\nOctober, 2023\n\nHere’s a first look at the cover for my new book to be published in April by Lyons Press.\n\nWhen I grew up, World War II was omnipresent and hidden. This was also true of my father’s time in the Air Force. Like most of his generation, it was a rule with him not to talk about what he’d seen at war. “You’re not getting any war stories from me,” he’d say. Cleaning up the old family house the year before he died, I was surprised to find a short diary of the bombing missions he had flown. Some of the missions were harrowing. I began to fill in the details, and to be surprised again, this time by a history I thought I knew.\n\nI Will Tell No War Stories is about undoing the forgetting in our family and in a society that has hidden the horrors and cataclysm of a world at war. Some part of that forgetting was necessary for the veterans, otherwise how could they come home, how could they find peace?\n\nI Will Tell No War Stories is, finally, about learning to live with history, a theme I have explored in some of my earlier books like In the Memory House and The Same Ax, Twice.\n\nAnd here’s the first comment for I Will Tell No War Stories. Mark Bowden, the author of Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, offers his advance praise:\n\nIn this moving and absorbing book, Howard Mansfield tries to understand his father’s steadfast, lifelong refusal to discuss his service as a 19-year-old B-24 machine gunner during World War 2. There was guilt, of both the survivor and the killer, a deep sense of war’s depravity, but mostly there was the shadow of a terror so intense and sustained that not even a long life was enough to escape. To speak of it was to re-enter it. It was, as Mansfield’s research reveals, and as his father knew, an experience so overwhelming that words diminished it, as if trying to draw a frame around the infinite.\n\nThe audio book of Turn & Jump: How Time and Place Fell Apart is now available on Amazon, Audible and iTunes. It’s read by the author who is joined in the last chapter by Abenaki scholar and storyteller Marge Bruchac. She reads her own part, and sings a little.\n\nYou can hear a short sample of the introduction here.\n\nSeptember, 2023\n\nI’m looking forward to this:\n\nFrom the Toadstool Bookshop in Peterborough, NH:\n\nWe are thrilled to announce Heather Cox Richardson will now be in-conversation with local author Howard Mansfield on Saturday, January 13th, 2024 at 11am. Due to such enthusiasm and interest, we have moved the event to the Unitarian Church and have made it a ticketed event. To reserve your seats, please call our Peterborough store at 603-924-3543 and pay over the phone via card. In the case of seating availability on the day of, we will have tickets for sale at the door. We are beyond excited to welcome Heather Cox Richardson to Peterborough and hope you will join us for this special occasion!\n\nClose to 25 years ago, I opened my book The Same Ax, Twice: Restoration & Renewal in as Throwaway Age by talking about a farmer’s ax, igloos, the Shinto shrine Ise. and the USS Constitution.\n\nWhat do they all have in common?\n\nThey are preserved by being continually rebuilt. That farmer had rebuilt his ax many times. He said that he had the same ax. I wrote:\n\n“So, does that farmer have the same ax? Yes. His ax is an igloo, and a Shinto shrine. He possesses the same ax even more than a neighboring farmer who may have never repaired his own ax. To remake a thing correctly is to discover its essence.\n\n“A tool has a double life. It exists in the physical sense, all metal and wood, and it lives in the heart and the mind. Without these two lives, the tool dies. The farmer who restored his ax has a truer sense of that ax. He has the history of ax building in his hands. Museums are filled with cases of tools that no one knows how to use anymore. A repaired ax is a living tradition.\n\n“We have our own Ise Shrine, our igloo, a U.S. government-sized farmer’s ax, the U.S.S. Constitution, Old Ironsides, the oldest commissioned warship afloat in the world.”\n\nThis week I was looking up Old Ironsides as we prepared to record the audio book for The Same Ax, Twice, and I found that the website for the USS Constitution Museum had quoted from my book. They were celebrating the spirit of a living, breathing preservation. Give it a read: “Rebuilt, Preserved, Restored – USS Constitution Across the Centuries.”\n\nAnd order the book, ebook, or (soon) the audio book.\n\nJuly, 2023\n\nMy books have been honored with the Ruth & James Ewing Arts Awards for Literary Arts. This is what the presenter said:\n\nAuthor Howard Mansfield lets curiosity guide his story-telling and peppers that work with questions and observations that make one smile, pause to consider or uncomfortably confront…. Howard’s writing pursues truth through its inquisitiveness, particularly our contradictions.\n\n“It’s the city upon the hill and the slave labor to build it,” he says, writing about our history. “It’s winner-take-all greed and great acts of philanthropy and charity. It’s the founders of the country committing us to this great course, but, also, they were the slave-holders.\n\n“You’ve got to take all of that together, and it becomes your inheritance to pry that apart.”\n\nHoward is a winner of a Ruth and James Ewing Arts Award for Literary Arts. The recognition comes from his many books but also from the manner by which he explores his subjects, forcing us, in so many ways, to equally face that which we choose to discuss and that which we purposely leave unsaid.\n\nWhen he moved to New Ipswich, he visited the local historical society and explored the musty, disheveled collections there. It became the basis of his first book, “In the Memory House.”\n\n“In that book, I’m very interested in the stories we choose to tell and the stories we don’t tell,” he says. “Essentially how we choose our ancestors, who gets the displays in the museums, who gets the holidays, who has the names on the road and the landscape and what stories are we leaving out.” There are valuable observations in what Howard writes and even more wisdom in his questions.\n\nJune, 2023\n\nI’m honored to receive a Ruth and James Ewing Arts Award. They have chosen one other writer this year to receive the award: Sy Montgomery.\n\nMay, 2023\n\nI am pleased to return to the Infrastructure Junkies podcast to discuss two more chapters from The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down. On my first visit I discussed the attempts to drain the Great Dismal Swamp and told sad, important story about Romaine Tenney losing his farm, and his life, to an interstate highway. Listen here.\n\nThis time we delve into “The Land of Many Uses” — our national forests. From the mass destruction of old growth American timber throughout the 19th and 20th centuries to the creation of national forests, these national treasures may not be as safe as we would like them to be. We then head to New Hampshire’s North Country for the story “My Roots are Deeper than your Pockets” — when one’s land is more important than any amount of money, even if the landowner lacks sufficient financial resources. Listen here or here.\n\nApril, 2023\n\nI’ll be giving the keynote talk at an important conference May 7 about saving our cultural heritage from the rising seas. Many of our most treasured historic sites, like the Statue of Liberty, the Kennedy Space Center, and the country’s first permanent English settlement, Jamestown, are imperiled.\n\nSarah Sutton, a museum consultant, says: “If you’re within two to seven feet of sea level today, then saltwater is in your future this century. If, like many early cultural sites, yours was built on land that was once wetland, then saltwater is already in your basement. What to do? Document, protect, salvage, move, or abandon?”\n\nMore info: https://historyabovewater.org/2023-portsmouth/\n\nThe Habit of Turning the World Upside Down is now available as an audio book, read by the author. Listen to a sample here.\n\nIntroducing my new book:\n\nI Will Tell No War Stories. To be published by Lyons Press next year, Spring 2024.\n\nWhen I grew up, World War II was omnipresent and hidden. This was also true of my father’s time in the Air Force. Like most of his generation, it was a rule with him not to talk about what he’d seen at war. “You’re not getting any war stories from me,” he’d say.

This is a meeting of the Governing Council of the International Right of Way Association holding up my book – The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down – a book that, in places, criticizes how their profession has implemented Eminent Domain, taking property for roads, powerlines, and pipelines. But here they are, willing to hear me out, to learn. Thank you to Dave Arnold for the photo and for interviewing me on the Infrastructure Junkies podcast that he co-hosts with Kristen Short Bennett. Here’s that episode: https://tinyurl.com/yc3rhtv3\n\nInfrastructure Junkies is “an informative and sometimes irreverent podcast for those interested in eminent domain, right of way land acquisition, or infrastructure development. Topics for discussion frequently include condemnation of real property for public use, just compensation, [and] the Uniform Relocation Act.”\n\nThis is probably not a podcast you’d stumble upon. It’s about, and by, the professionals who make eminent domain happen – the lawyers, and relocation specialists in what they call “the right of way industry.” When people are fighting an impending pipeline or powerline, these folks can easily be cast as the villains.\n\nBut the podcast by two lively hosts, Dave Arnold and Kristen Short Bennett, shows the truer, more complex picture. They believe in building new roads and pipelines. They believe that “one of the things that makes this nation such a wonderful place to live is our fabulous infrastructure system. We have reliable electricity, we have running water … safe and reliable airlines, and rails, and we have roads to take us anywhere we want to go,” as co-host Arnold says. But they also know that to have your home taken by the state, no matter how good the intentions, can be a wrenching and emotional loss. “What we as right of way professionals do not always realize, however, is that every single project comes with a hidden price to humanity,” says Arnold. In some episodes lawyers on both sides of taking a property, debate, contesting the entire process and the vague, but all important phrase “just compensation.”\n\nRecently I was honored to lead off the fourth season. We discussed my book, The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down. This is what the hosts said:\n\nDave Arnold: I took Mansfield’s book off the shelf and “I began reading and it changed my life and my perspective…. The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down is now required reading for anybody who wants to come join my [legal] team.”\n\nKristen Short Bennett: “I’ve spent 16 years in the right of way industry. I have relocated over a thousand displacees. I have sat around countless kitchen tables explaining relocation benefits, listening to family histories, getting to know people from all walks of life. I pride myself on my ability to build rapport with landowners and displaces, and I’d even consider myself to be empathetic with their situations. But this book changed me as well. It shifted my perspective on what we do and the people who are impacted.\n\n“I’ll give you an example, and this might even be a little controversial. I have stated on this very podcast, I think multiple times, that we don’t take people’s property, we buy it. And I would like to today retract that statement. We absolutely do take it. We take it and they do not have a choice or a say in the matter. Oh, we pay them fair market value, sure. But we take it. And I don’t need to lie to myself anymore about what I do to sleep at night because I think that we do is important and it’s necessary. But it is not work that his done without tremendous sacrifice by people who did not choose to be part of the process.”\n\nListen to the episode of Infrastructure Junkies.\n\nJanuary, 2023\n\nAn ebook of Skylark: The Life, Lies and Inventions of Harry Atwood is now available at Amazon.\n\nNovember, 2022\n\nThe Bones of the Earth is now available as an audio book, read by the author, on Audible, iTunes or Amazon.

It’s a 1951 movie about labor strife made by Louis de Rochemont. — the inventor of the Time magazine newsreel. Think of it as On the Waterfront — which followed it several years later — but set in New Hampshire.\n\nDe Rochemont, a two-time Oscar winner, was famous for making the March of Time newsreels everyone saw at the movies before the main feature. In those pre-television days, this is where people first saw Hitler preparing for war as early as 1935, sharecroppers picking cotton in the South, the Dust Bowl, a New Orleans Jazz Band, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt being sworn in for his four terms in office, in reports mixing staged scenes with actual footage. (“It’s terrific,” said Time’s chief Henry Luce when he viewed the first reels, “but what is it?”)\n\nHe was an imposing figure. A non-stop worker “with a shock of disorderly brown hair and the haggard look of an overworked city editor, he fairly explodes with impatient energy,” said Reader’s Digest magazine. “Sleep and rest don’t figure in his schedule,” said an associate. “He turns every job into a major adventure and all the time he talks your ear off about some new enthusiasm.” Most of all, he had “velocity, a gigantic, unmodulated kind of energy” that was like “a maddened elephant crashing through the underbrush at Time, Incorporated,” said film historian Raymond Fielding.\n\nDe Rochemont’s films used a documentary style. They were “dramas from real life.” He filmed The Whistle at Eaton Falls in Exeter, Dover, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and in Boston.\n\nThis is a newly-restored print that captures the rich texture and deeply-shadowed scenes,\n\nPlease join the Exeter Historical Society, Keene State College Special Collections & Archives, and the Louis de Rochemont Heritage Films, Inc. for the Exeter, New Hampshire, premiere. The movie, stars Lloyd Bridges, Ernest Borgnine, and Dorothy Gish.\n\nAfter the film, there will be a discussion between filmmaker, professor and historian Larry Benaquist and New Hampshire author Howard Mansfield followed by a Q&A about the film.\n\nThe event is free, however, donations are appreciated.\n\nHere’s the trailer: https://youtu.be/Z1R22HMlrEs\n\nAugust, 2022\n\nOur next performance of A Journey to the White Mountains in Words & Music is Sunday, November 6, in the late afternoon, 4 to 5:30 p.m., at the Word Barn in Exeter, N.H. Tickets and directions are available here.\n\nOther upcoming shows:\n\nNovember 12 — House concert, Dublin, NH\n\nApril 14 — The Showroom, The Colonial Theater, Keene, NH.\n\nJune, 2022\n\nA warm reception at Bass Hall. Ben Cosgrove on the Steinway grand – and me reading – captivated the audience. Here’s everyone arriving, and us taking a bow. As for the performance, I have no pictures, so you’ll have to imagine that. A big thank you to everyone who was there.\n\nApril, 2022\n\nA great night at the Capitol Center for the Arts. We received a standing ovation. Sending it right back to you friends — thank you so much for being there with us for the debut of A Journey to the White Mountains in Words and Music.\n\nThe next show is June 4 at Bass Hall (Monadnock Center for History & Culture) in Peterborough, NH, 7:30 pm. For tickets click here.\n\nAnd we’ll also be at the Word Barn in Exeter, NH, November 6.\n\nMarch, 2022\n\nI’ve been working with a brilliant composer to set part of my latest book, Chasing Eden: A Book of Seekers, to music and bring it to the stage.\n\nI’ll be performing A Journey to the White Mountains in Words and Music at the Capitol Center for the Arts in Concord, NH, on Thursday, April 14, 7:30 pm.\n\nTickets ($24) are available online: https://ccanh.secure.force.com/ticket/#/events/a0S1R00000Cc8NzUAJ or by calling the box office at the Capitol Center: 603-225-1111.\n\nThe show is about how the discovery of the White Mountains affects us to this day. Pioneering artists in the 19th Century taught Americans how to look at the wilderness. Americans were eager for the lesson, and, with guidebook in hand telling them where to see the views in the famous paintings, they followed the artists. Their art created a market for the views, filled hotels with tourists, and laid the bounds for national parks across the country.\n\nToday’s tourists to the White Mountains may not know it, but they’ve come in search of an Eden created by a legion of nineteenth-century landscape painters.\n\nThe composer, Ben Cosgrove, writes landscape-inspired music, a spirited, Jazz-inflected piano in the tradition of Keith Jarrett. You can hear Ben at the keyboard here: www. BenCosgrove.com\n\nBen has held artist residencies and fellowships with the National Park Service, the National Forest Service, Harvard University, Middlebury College, the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Appalachian Mountain Club, and the Sitka Center for Art & Ecology. He has also written for Orion, Taproot, Northern Woodlands, Appalachia, and other publications.\n\nHis fourth studio album, The Trouble with Wilderness, an evocation of nature and wildness within the built environment, was released last year. The album was featured on NHPR’s Outside/In, and was deemed one of the best new releases of last spring by WBUR. The Trouble with Wilderness has been called “beautiful and fascinating” (The Maine Edge), “deeply impressive” (Independent Clauses) and “immediately evocative and fully arresting… brimming with technical mastery and emotional capital” (Seven Days).\n\nWe have been following each other’s work for years. When I first heard Ben Cosgrove’s music, it made immediate, emotional sense. In his music I hear the restlessness of America and the broad reach of the country.\n\nAs Ben says, he has been reading my books “for years, some of them over and over. He’s able to write about local history and sense of place in a thoughtful, conversational way that somehow feels both deeply personal and ringingly universal.”\n\nYou’ve all been loyal, coming to my readings and talks over the years, for which I’m grateful. This show is quite different. I hope that the words and music bring us all closer to an elemental, powerful place.\n\nFebruary, 2022\n\nI always enjoy talking to Francesca Rheannon, host of the radio show and podcast, The Writer’s Voice. She’s a sharp interviewer and a smart reader, one who dives deep into a book. I talked with Francesca about Chasing Eden: A Book of Seekers. As a bonus, in the show’s second half, she replays our 2019 talk about The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down. Listen here.\n\nI’ll be joining the Spring lecture series at the New Hampshire Historical Society:\n\n“Capturing Eden: An Exploration of White Mountain Art.”\n\nThe lectures are Thursdays, April 14 to May 12, 2022, at 6 p.m.\n\nHere’s the description for the series:\n\nIn 1836, a young British painter named Thomas Cole wrote in his “Essay on American Scenery” that “Nature has spread for us a rich and delightful banquet—shall we turn away from it? We are still in Eden.” Cole was one of the earliest artists to venture into the White Mountains of New Hampshire, seeking, as he put it, “the loveliness of verdant fields, the sublimity of lofty mountains, [and] the varied magnificence of the sky.” More than 450 artists came to the region in the 19th century, armed with sketchpads, camp stools, and white umbrellas. The views they created on canvas would become emblematic of the state. The Society’s 2022 spring lecture series explores the White Mountain artists of this era and how they shaped New Hampshire.\n\nPlease note that the spring lecture series is a members-only event.\n\nI give the second lecture, April 21:\n\n‘We Are Still In Eden’: How Artists Taught America to See Nature\n\nFor the first artists, the White Mountains was a place awaiting their discovery, a place they would conjure. By the end of the 19th century, after the paintings and the guidebooks, it had all been seen. The landscape went from begin a testament to a souvenir, but in the process, painters like Thomas Cole and writers like Thomas Starr King grappled with the sublime power of God and nature. Author Howard Mansfield talks about the legion of 19th-century landscape\n\nThe other lectures:\n\nLecture 1 (April 14): Professor Inez McDermott (Art History, New England College) giving an introductory lecture about White Mountain art, Samuel L. Gerry, and his contemporaries\n\nLecture 3 (April 28): Professor Marcia Schmidt Blaine (History, Plymouth State University) speaking on women artists in the White Mountains\n\nLecture 4 (May 5): Professor Dona Brown (History, UVM) talking about the development of the White Mountains as a tourist destination and the role that White Mountain artists played in that development\n\nLecture 5 (May 12): Mark Mitchell (Holcombe T. Green Curator of American Paintings and Sculpture, Yale University Art Gallery) talking about American landscape painting and how White Mountain art fits into that larger context.\n\nJoin The NH Historical Society. I’d love to see you there.\n\nDecember, 2021\n\nLooking good at the Harvard Book Store.\n\nFrom an interview I did with Authority Magazine, online here. One Q & A:\n\nHow do you define “Leadership”? Can you explain what you mean or give an example?\n\nThe people we admire are the ones that have a wholeness about them. They are committed in their every action to something they love. That’s true leadership. They don’t necessarily advertise themselves, but people sensing this wholeness seek them out.\n\nNovember, 2021\n\nAudio books are now available for Chasing Eden, and Summer Over Autumn. I read both of them at the nearby Loud Sun Studio in Jaffrey, New Hampshire. Download them wherever you get your audio books.\n\nTwo of New England’s best independent booksellers pick their favorite new books for fall. Chasing Eden is on both their lists:\n\n“… Writer Howard Mansfield has pursued some active chasers and written a fascinating account of individuals and groups that made attempts to create an Edenic life here on Earth. They range from the Shaker Community in Canterbury to an early 20th-century Black doctor in Keene who crossed over and back between races. And not to be missed is the powerful chapter on the 40 thousand former slaves offered ‘40 acres and a mule’ right after the Civil War. An Eden promised but not delivered.”\n\n— Willard Williams, owner, The Toadstool Bookshop, Peterborough, NH\n\n“I will second Willard’s nomination of Howard Mansfield’s new book, Chasing Eden: A Book of Seekers. Millenarian dreamers are as American as apple pie, and form a fertile subject for Howard Mansfield as he once again grapples with our history and makes it feel contemporary. Mansfield is one of the few writers working today who could be called a public intellectual — like Edmund Wilson in years gone by, or Ta-Nehisi Coates and Masha Gessen today, these are thinkers who are not affiliated with universities whose interests are wide-ranging, covering broad swathes of our cultural and literary landscape. As always, Mansfield’s fertile mind entertains as much as it educates in this fantastic new book.”\n\n— Michael Herrmann, owner Gibson’s Bookstore, Concord, NH\n\nOctober, 2021\n\nI enjoyed talking to Jim Braude and Jared Bowen on WGBH radio’s Boston Public Radio show. Listen here. Scroll down to find my part of the show.\n\nJim Braude likes the book. He said,“This book is just spectacular. Everybody should go out and buy it.”\n\nHere’s an introduction to my new book, Chasing Eden, in 2 minutes and 38 seconds:\n\nSeptember, 2021\n\nPhotographer and one-time New Hampshire Artist Laureate Gary Samson came by with a gift, a copy of New Hampshire Now, his dream project to have close to 50 photographers capture the glories and contradictions of NH. They worked for three years, including the long, long year of lockdown and protest, 2020. I was honored to write the introduction. NH Now will be out in October with exhibits all over the state. Thanks are due to the New Hampshire Historical Society and the New Hampshire Society of Photographic Artists for supporting Gary’s dream.\n\nAugust, 2021\n\nAn excerpt from my forthcoming book, Chasing Eden, is in the August issue of New Hampshire Magazine. Editor Rick Broussard says:\n\n“This issue features a number of people who have learned to “listen” with more than just their ears. Most notably, one of my literary heroes, Hancock’s Howard Mansfield, has offered us the first chapter of his new book (due out in October) to excerpt for this issue.\n\n“Mansfield’s head seems to contain an app like the one I use to identify birdsong, but his algorithm is set on detecting something more subtle. Mansfield assimilates the ambient world of towns and people and work and play, and detects the deeper notes that guide him to stories. He follows the invisible connective tissues of communities and finds links to a past that never really went away. He translates messages that our world is apparently always chirping to anyone who cares to stop and pay attention. I’ve learned that Mansfield’s words tend to impart a touch of his ability to the reader, so don’t be surprised if, once you discover him, you start to pick up on those deeper notes all around you.”\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nIt’s gratifying when a book you have written finds readers, and especially so when that book has been out for a while. My first book, Cosmopolis, published in 1990, has been picking up some new readers lately. It has been noted by scholars, most recently in The Routledge Companion to Twentieth and Early Twenty-First Century Urban Design: A History of Shifting Manifestoes, Paradigms, Generic Solutions, and Specific Designs by Jon Lang, published in September 2020.\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nProf. William Stroup at Keene State College has assigned The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down for a course he is teaching this fall, “Reading and Writing in Place.” I’ll be visiting by Zoom.\n\nI’ll be speaking at this Zoom conference about archives:\n\nNovember 2019\n\nBack in Print: At the End of Life: True Stories about How We Die. I contributed an essay, “Waiting (to go Home)” this collection of essays edited by Lee Gutkind,\n\nThe publisher, Creative Nonfiction Books, says “this is quite a terrific book, a moving and informative collection of narrative essays about how people die in the American healthcare system, with stories from the points of view of a 911 telephone operator, parents writing about losing a child, a grief counselor, and a physician losing a patient, among others. And it’s got a wonderfully thoughtful introduction from Francine Prose.\n\nMy essay is about nursing homes and hospitals. From the essay:\n\nYou can’t deny the Godot-like absurdities of the nursing home. It’s a vast diorama of waiting.\n\nIn the dayroom two men are talking about the Marx Brothers.\n\n“He could really play the harp,” the first says of Harpo.\n\n“He couldn’t talk,” says the second man.\n\n“He could talk.”\n\n“He couldn’t talk.”\n\nThey stumble along over this until the first man finally explains that Harpo could talk, but didn’t as part of his act. Then he says, “There were five Marx Brothers.” He starts to name them – Groucho, Harpo, Chico… and after awhile he comes up with Zeppo. But the fifth? They start the list over and are stumped.\n\nI’m sitting across the room with my dad. He’s in this nursing home—a different one than my mother’s —after a bad fall for a few weeks of physical therapy. We’re paying his bills. The two men are still trying to name the fifthMarx Brother. I call over:\n\n“Gummo.”\n\n“Dumbo?”\n\n“Gummo.”\n\n“Dumbo?”\n\n“Gummo. He dropped out early.”\n\n“Gummo? I don’t remember him,” and he waves his hand to the side—the classic New York gesture: eh, take it away. Having an answer has disappointed them. I feel like I have taken a bone from a dog. Who knows how long they could have pursued the mystery of the forgotten Marx Brother? They have all day, and the next.\n\nThey shift in their chairs, are quiet, and then find something to complain about. This warms them right up again.\n\nOctober 2019\n\nFifty-five years ago, farmer Romaine Tenney set fire to his barns and farmhouse, with himself inside, after his land was seized by the state to make way for Interstate 91. Now as Vermont is planning a permanent memorial, I was a guest on Vermont Public Radio’s Vermont Edition To talk about this chapter from The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down. Listen here.\n\nAugust 2019\n\nThe Same House, Twice. I loved learning about Grace McEniry’s architecture project at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design.\n\n“In this cabin intended to break down and wear out, the material and assembly logic is legible and clear to make renovation and repair part of the original concept. The project is meant to reference an old riddle: “I know a farmer who says he has had the same ax his whole life—he only changed the handle three times and the head two times. Does he have the same ax?”* How would this cabin be the same one hundred years from when it was built? I hope this project demonstrates an understanding of OSM as part of a continuum of people and places that allows for adaptation to life in one cabin over time …. *Concept and quote from: Mansfield, Howard. The Same Ax, Twice: Restoration and Renewal in a Throwaway Age. University Press of New England, 2001.” You read more about the house here.\n\nApril 2019\n\nMy favorite bookstore is in the next town, The Toadstool Bookshop in Peterborough. It’s a thriving independent bookstore where I’ve seen many authors read. It’s where I always kick off my book tours because there will be a large turnout and thoughtful questions.\n\nWillard Williams, who opened the Toadstool in 1972 with his wife Holly, told the Monadnock Ledger-Transcript in an interview about the many writers who have visited his store:\n\nQ: Over the years, what was the most memorable speaker and how did the audience respond to them?\n\nA: I don’t want to slight anybody who didn’t, but certainly our most successful ones were Howard Mansfield and Sy Montgomery. They’re a couple who live in Hancock, and they’ve each written different kinds of books. Both of them, they’re lots of fun and lots of people come to hear them, too. They give great presentations….”\n\nThank you Willard and Holly for such a vibrant, important part of our community.\n\nMarch 2019\n\nMarch 2019\n\nI am honored that one of my stories is a finalist for the City and Regional Magazine Awards (CRMA). The story, “Rising Seas,” was Yankee’s cover for March/April 2018. The CRMA said: “This moving report succeeds where many climate change reporters fail by engaging our emotions in a small snapshot of the world’s biggest story. This is powerful, outstanding writing.”\n\nFrom the Living on Earth interview:\n\nFebruary 2019\n\nTwo new interviews about The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down are now online. I talked to Steve Curwood, the host of Living on Earth. Listen here or read the short transcript. And I enjoyed my talk with Francesca Rheannon, the host and producer of the Writer’s Voice podcast .\n\nDecember 2018\n\nI get my very own state holiday. On New Hampshire Public Radio’s daily talk show, The Exchange, I was awarded a state holiday:\n\nDan Chartrand, owner of Water Street Bookstore: Sy has said—I’ve heard her say in public—that a lot of the underpinning and the theory behind her work preserving and appreciating the animals that live on this planet with us, is really based on her husband Howard’s work. Howard has written extensively about preservation and replacement. And why, when his books come out, don’t we all stop, in the state of New Hampshire, take a state holiday, and all read it at the same time? We should have a state book club. Every time Howard publishes a new book.–Dan\n\nMichael Herrman, owner of Gibson’s Bookstore: We could call it Howard Mansfield Day\n\nDan: Exactly! This guy is the most under-read author in NH and he’s one of the most important authors.\n\nMichael: It’s because he’s so hard to categorize.\n\nDan: Exactly!\n\nHost: What shelf do you put Howard Mansfield on?\n\nDan: Let’s start with The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down. Let’s everyone just take a break, read this amazing book.\n\nOh, and I’m pleased to report that both booksellers picked The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down as one of the best books of the year.\n\nRobert H. Thomas is a land use, eminent domain, and appellate lawyer who practices in Hawaii. He is also a visiting professor at William & Mary Law School in Williamsburg, Virginia. Thomas really likes The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down. It’s “a great read, and a perfect gift for those on your holiday lists,” says Thomas.\n\nThomas interviewed me for his widely-read blog on land use, property, and takings law, inversecondemnation.com. We had a lively conversation. You can tell that Robert Thomas really enjoys his work. Listen to the interview here or here.\n\nI enjoyed my visit with Peter Biello on NHPR’s show The Exchange. Listeners called in with good, challenging questions. Listen here.\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nThe first review is in for The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down:\n\nThe always eloquent Mansfield conducts an evocative foray into the history of American property rights in this slim but enormously prescient title. In a series of related essays, he takes readers from the arrival of the Europeans (who “defined the Indians by what they didn’t own”) to George Washington’s land speculation career with the Adventurers for Draining the Dismal Swamp (a slave-labor-based company attempting to drain a Virginia swamp) to contemporary struggles defending private property rights against pipeline and transmission line developers. While he crafts strikingly evocative portraits of the people he profiles (his essay on farmer Romaine Tenney, who sacrificed everything to fight against the interstate barreling across his land, is simply unforgettable), it is the scalpel like precision with which Mansfield homes in on the relationship between Americans and the land that proves most perceptive. He accepts all the complexities of his chosen subject yet is gifted with an unerring eye for the true heart of the matter. “American property is always in motion,” he writes, but it is also “our anchor and our North Star.” Who decides the best use of property? Who truly owns it? Powerful insights live on these pages, and Mansfield’s observations matter now more than ever.\n\n— Colleen Mondor, Booklist (starred review)\n\nMy new book has received its second review:\n\nThere comes a point early on in the reading of Howard Mansfield’s newest book The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down when you realize that you thought you understood what “property” meant, but in actuality, you didn’t. A point when you say to yourself: “Ok, I’m listening to what this guy has to say.” This book is a path-clearing work; the idea of property as most of us understand it has been occluded by so many branches consisting of conflicting ideas, legalese, lawsuits and the idea of eminent domain that one needs a person like Mr. Mansfield to clear away the brush and show us the path again. He does this admirably well in this, his tenth book.\n\n… All of his narratives are clear and concise, and most importantly, eye-opening. Even life-changing… At 128 pages, The Habit of Turning the World Upside Down is a quick read, but it demands a thoughtful read. Parts of it should be read to your children so they understand the incertitude of what they are taught in school. Property is a fluid thing; it can never be truly controlled, as the native peoples of North America tried to tell the first Europeans who landed in North America. Five stars and highly recommended reading.\n\n— The Miramichi Reader\n\nJuly 2018\n\nI enjoyed my visit to the Canaan Meetinghouse Readings series which is run by Phil Pochoda. Phil is a retired publishing veteran (Simon & Schuster, Prentice Hall Press, Pantheon Books, University of Michigan Press, and the University Press of New England).\n\nThank you Phil for this fine and funny introduction:\n\nMay 2018\n\nI am honored and surprised to find In the Memory House on writer Jim Rogers’ list of ten books that have made an impact on him. Jim Rogers wrote: “Not sure why I first picked up Howard Mansfield’s book In the Memory House (1993), but it is a jewel – a lyric meditation on the beauty of the nearby, the endurance of memory, and (this sounds way more ponderous than it is) on the phenomenology of living in a place, in his case rural New Hampshire. Howard Mansfield is a treasure whose essays and books deserve to be much better known.”\n\nOn Facebook, other readers joined in. The writer Rebecca Rule said, “It changed my way of thinking about old stuff. And I think a lot about old stuff.” New England College professor of art Inez McDermott said, “This book mattered to me, too. It got me out of the academic approach to art history and I began to teach, think, research and write in a more “holistic” (for lack of a better word) way.” And Leslie Rosoff Kenney said, “I also loved this book. Thank you, Howard.”\n\nApril 2018\n\nThank you Fritz Wetherbee for telling your loyal New Hampshire Chronicle viewers about Summer Over Autumn. Here’s what Fritz said:\n\nWatch this segment of New Hampshire Chronicle here.\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nEvery Monday, The American Conservative’s editorial staff, along with some regular contributors, share with their readers what they have been reading. One of those books is The Bones of the Earth:\n\n“Addison Del Mastro, assistant editor: I’ve been reading The Bones of the Earth by Howard Mansfield. I discovered this book while I was doing some research on the retail history of Route 22, one of New Jersey’s iconic post-war highway strips. It happened that Mansfield wrote a couple of pages about Route 22 here, and the kitschy midcentury signs and buildings there, some of which survive today.\n\n“The Bones of the Earth is not, however, so much about historic preservation or suburbia, as it is about cultural memory and how we think about the past. Mansfield visits some old stone bridges in New England and ponders how they were built with no mortar, by masons who could tell from the shape of a stone exactly where in the bridge it needed to go. He also wrote about a tradition sparked by the now-defunct Boston Post, in which the paper distributed gold and ebony canes to the oldest residents of several hundred New England towns, and stipulated that upon death, the cane would be transferred to the next oldest resident. At the time of its writing in 2004, a handful of towns still participated in the tradition.\n\n“When does a corporate sweepstakes like that turn into a genuine tradition? When does a faded neon sign of a smiling anthropomorphic bowling pin on an ugly highway strip meld into the nation’s cultural patrimony? Terms and ideas like “culture,” “historic preservation,” “the past,” and so many more have no clear definition and are based on many underlying assumptions. Mansfield wades into all of this to great, thought-provoking effect here.”\n\nDecember 2017\n\nSummer Over Autumn has been chosen by Water Street Bookstore in Exeter, N.H., as a Top 12 Nonfiction Book for 2017.\n\nNovember 2017\n\nSeptember 2017"
