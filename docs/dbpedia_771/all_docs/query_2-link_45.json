        "text": "Year\n\n2024\n\nPlacement\n\nAudience Choice, 1st Prize Winner\n\nAdam Jackson was born in the UK and began piano studies at the age of 7 when he moved with his family to the US. In 2017, Adam was accepted into the Kaufman Music Center High School, began studies with renowned pianist Orli Shaham in early 2018 and entered Juilliard Pre-College in 2019. Adam has performed with orchestras including the Amadeus Chamber Orchestra of Polish Radio in Poznan, Poland, the Siletz Bay, Oregon Festival Orchestra, the New York Chamber Players, the Park Avenue Chamber Symphony, and the Symphony of Westchester. Adam has performed solo recitals in the US, UK and Poland. He has participated in master classes with Richard Goode, Mikhail Voskresensky, Alexandre Moutouzkine, Boris Slutsky, and Ilana Vered. At the age of 11, Adam won 1st prize in the Under-16 category at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, appearing live on British television. In 2017, Adam won the International Young Musicians competition at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod, Wales, second prize in the Leschetizky International Concerto Competition, and third prize in the Kaufman International Youth Piano Competition, New York. In 2019, Adam won 1st place in the Special Music School Concerto Competition. Adam has attended summer festivals including, the 2018 Morningside Music Bridge at Fryderyk Chopin University, Warsaw, the 2019 “Music@Menlo” Chamber Institute, California, and studied with Arie Vardi and Hung-Kuan Chen at the 2022 Aspen Music Festival. Adam is pursuing piano performance studies at The Juilliard School of Music under the tutelage of Profs. Orli Shaham and Julian Martin.\n\nYear\n\n2015\n\nPlacement\n\nQuarterfinalist\n\nPianist Alessandro Mazzamuto is “one of the most inspiring, extraordinary pianists that I have had the joy to hear” writes Martha Argerich. He is “no virtuoso of show, no ruthless technician, but a pianist absorbed in the music who plays with as much spontaneity as poetry,” claims Pizzicato Magazine. Winner of International Classical Music Awards’ 2013 Young Instrumental Artist of the Year, the 26-year-old Sicilian pianist has won more than 60 national and international competitions in piano and chamber music. Mazzamuto has appeared as soloist with orchestras such as La Verdi (Milan), the Rias Berlin Youth Orchestra (Germany), the Chamber Orchestra of Kiev (Ukraine), the Philharmonic Orchestra of Ploesti (Romania), and the Bacau Philharmonic Orchestra (Romania), with conductors such as Daisuke Soga, Amaury du Closel, John Axelrod, Tomasz Bugaj, Ovidiu Balan, Valentin Doni, Ovidiu Marinescu, and Epifanio Comis. He has performed in numerous European and American venues such as the Salle Cortot (Paris), La Fenice (Venice), Maly Hall of the Moscow Conservatoire (Russia), University Romano of Bacau (Romania), Il Tempio (Florence), Auditorium Giuseppe Verdi (Milan), Caruth Auditorium (Dallas), and the Opera House Massimo Bellini (Italy). Finalist at the 58th edition of the prestigious Ferruccio Busoni International Piano Competition in 2011, Alessandro Mazzamuto was awarded the special prize “Gianandrea Lodovici,” which consisted of the production of a CD for the German label ARTS with worldwide distribution. This prize was given at the discretion of the president of the jury, Martha Argerich, being chosen for “a particular depth and originality of interpretation.” Thanks to the recording of the above-mentioned CD with music by Rachmaninov, Mazzamuto, together with the ARTS record company, was awarded by international critics the prize “Supersonic – Pizzicato” in 2012. Most recently, Alessandro became a winner of 2014 Center for Musical Excellence (CME) International Grant, Birte Moller Young Artists Award, and a CME Young Artist. His New York debut recital at Carnegie Hall will take place in June – 29 – 2015. Alessandro Mazzamuto graduated with honors from the Music Institute “Vincenzo Bellini” in Catania, under the guidance of Epifanio Comis. He also studied at the International Piano Academy in Imola. Currently, Alessandro is a student in the Performers Diploma program at SMU’s Meadows School of the Arts in Dallas, TX, where he studies with Professors Joaquin Achucarro and Carol Leone. Alessandro has taught piano at the Musical Institute “Pietro Vinci” in Caltagirone (Italy), the Municipal Institute “Giuseppe Privitera” in Syracuse (Italy) and the Accademia Musicale Siciliana in Adrano (Italy). He and his brother, violinist Lorenzo Mazzamuto, perform often as a celebrated duo.\n\nYear\n\n2013\n\nPlacement\n\nFinalist, Honorable Mention\n\nSince his orchestral debut at age 11, pianist Alex McDonald has soloed with the Orquesta Sinfónica del Estado de Mexico, Louisiana Philharmonic, Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, and Utah Symphony Orchestra, among others. He has performed across the United States, as well as in Israel, Mexico, Canada, Japan, and South Korea; additionally, he has been a featured performer on PBS, WRR (Dallas/Fort Worth), NPR, and WQXR (New York City). Awards include second prizes at the 2007 New Orleans International Piano Competition and 2001 Gina Bachauer International Young Artist Piano Competition, and the 2008 Harvey Fellowship by the Mustard Seed Foundation. In 2013, he was a competitor in the Fourteenth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. Mr. McDonald is currently the festival director for Basically Beethoven, a thriving summer concert series now approaching its 40th season in downtown Dallas’ Arts District. His program “Music for Animals” was hailed by Theater Jones as one of its “Concerts of the Year” in 2016. Equally passionate as a teacher, his private piano students have been admitted to Juilliard and Eastman, and have performed at Carnegie’s Weill Hall and on WRR. He has taught at Texas Woman’s University, Richland College, and The Juilliard School, where he also was a teaching fellow for both the Literature and Materials and Piano Minor departments. The Texas Music Teacher’s Association awarded him the 2017 Outstanding Achievement Award in teaching at the age of 34. Mr. McDonald received his pre-college training under Lois Nielson, his bachelor’s degree from the New England Conservatory with Academic Honors and Distinction in Performance under Russell Sherman, and his master’s and doctoral degrees from Juilliard under Yoheved Kaplinsky and Julian Martin. His doctoral document, a source study on manuscripts and editions for Liszt’s Sonata in B Minor, has been cited in the most recent edition of the sonata by Alfred Publishers, edited by Nancy Bricard.\n\nYear\n\n2022\n\nPlacement\n\n3rd Prize Winner\n\nAlexander Agate, 21, began learning piano at age 11. At 13 he was accepted into the Applied Music Scholarship program at Moorpark Community College, a two-year program during which he worked with Professor Mona DeCesare. Prior to entering college, he studied under concert pianist Robert Thies for two and a half years. Currently, he is a senior Piano Performance major at California State University, Northridge (CSUN), studying under Professor Dmitry Rachmanov.
