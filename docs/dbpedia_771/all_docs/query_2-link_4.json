        "text": "1.\n\nAstronomy 01:30\n\nWell outside in the winter light We lie in the fields tonight But you'll never reveal these chains Unlocked in the springtime in the rain And you follow the days and nights And a future that seems so bright So I'll wait through the summer lawn I'll wait in a world that seems so wrong And there is more that I can't say Except I must be dreaming She tells me now that I can't stay That I must go far away I drive over the autumn dew Don't think I'll remember you but I'll follow the days and nights I'm searching for something not so bright And that's alright\n\n2.\n\nSitting all alone in the dark You can see the sun Feeling ever so far apart I guess you always knew That I felt this way for you But you can’t wait for time Running on but only so far In a world of blame Takes me back to see where you are And if you say it’s true whey do I belong to you You can’t wait for time Laughing in the hallway while the preacher stood and read Trying to uncover all the secrets of the dead And if you say it’s true Then I’ll fall in love with you But you can’t wait for time You face a world of strangers even though you’d like to be Among the ones who walked out only wanting to be free I guess you always knew that I felt this way for you But you can’t wait for time\n\n3.\n\nNighttime 02:41\n\nAt nighttime I go out and see the people Air goes cool and hurrying on my way And dressing so sweet, all the people to see They’re looking at me, all the people to see. And when I set my eyes on you You look like a kitty And when you’re in the moon Oh you look so pretty Caught a glance in your eyes And fell through the skies Glance in your eyes And fell through the skies I’m walking down the freezing street Scarf goes out behind You said, “Get them away” Please don’t say a word “Get me out of here Get me out of here I hate it here Get me out of here” At nighttime I go out and see the people Air goes cool and hurrying on my way Glanced in your eyes and fell through the skies Dance in your eyes and fell through the skies (c) Alex Chilton\n\n4.\n\nBack To Zero Now 03:21\n\nWell, people talk in another dimension, oh They don't always realize their intentions You dont wanna be somebody's hero, no You just wanna get back to zero now tayed away, far from the madding crowd You tried to listen, they were talking way too loud There was a voice somebody near you, no There was a choice Back in line You don't really want what's left behind There’s a clown Who only gets what’s left around All the same they’ll never forget you, no Even though they don’t to want to regret you Standing there to pick up the pieces of a memory That’s in your eyes You’ve got to want to realize Look around Cause there's nothing lost but something So appealing But now you're feeling down Back in line You don't really want what's left behind There’s a clown Who only gets what’s left around That’s in your eyes You’ve got to want to realize Look around Cause there's nothing lost but something So appealing But now you're feeling down Cause people talk in another dimension, oh They don't always realize their intentions You don't wanna be someone's hero, no You just wanna get back to zero now\n\n5.\n\nDeep Six Saturday 02:33\n\nWell find a deep six Saturday Going on a go by holiday Our fortified world is tumbling down Ready for the night to turn around Hanging in with the Hardy Boys Spin around a shake behind the noise I'm tired of all the B-girls there Tomorrow is a drag anywhere Praise the sky to (holler down) You're all alone in this town All along this side view When the max out finds you There's a new upholstery Make the most of your scene now I'm sorry about the world - it's tumbling down But hazy days will turn around The selling of a soul is happening now I'll try to pull away somehow Can you show me how? We'll find a deep six Saturday We'll find a deep six Saturday Saturday Saturday Saturday Saturday Saturday\n\n6.\n\nLong Time Missing 04:02\n\nPeople all around said they don’t understand The wonder kid’s gone and some one will have their say But he worked hard for yesterday He came upon the scene with a definite plan I know about the woman who wished upon a star Said he’d never get that far I read the news that shook the world apart Now I know you’ve been a long time missing And the world won’t listen To the long time missing in your life The balladeer man with a ward from the wings is selling his soul for so many things we knew but never dreamed they would come true The girl on the phone said she’d go it alone Waking up the world to find what she always knew Will leave you lost and lonely too Got his number it’s so hard to ring even though You’ve been a long time missing by your own admission There’s a long time missing in your life that we found Now I lay me down Tomorrow’s gone forever Like the weather Maybe never will our dreams be found I listened to the kids and I thought I could hear A thousand and one tiny voices ringing clear Another day in your career Around the corner there’s a newer breed Even though I thought you would succeed You’ve been a long time missing by your own admission There’s a long time missing in your life You’ve been a long time missing now the world will listen To the long time missing in your life\n\n7.\n\nPlaces That Are Gone 03:39\n\nNow you're finding you're amused with it all We were standing so confused down the hall Just looking back before they take it all away I'm almost glad that we never wanted to stay, because These are places that are gone Now we can go on and on Back before you knew me well I was trapped inside a shell Clear away all the dust from your mind Put it all on the shelf to leave behind Because when I hold you near, we're immune to the past And I am looking ahead I just want to make it last, because These are places that are gone Now we can go on and on Back before you knew me well I was trapped inside a shell This time tomorrow we'll be gone And I just can't put my finger on My destination is not so clear I just wanna get way out of here\n\n8.\n\nKill Your Sons 04:27\n\nAll your two-bit psychiatrists are giving you electro shock They say, they let you live at home, with mom and dad Instead of mental hospital But every time you tried to read a book You couldn’t get to page 17 ‘Cause you forgot, where you were So you couldn’t even read Don’t you know, they’re gonna kill your sons Don’t you know, they’re gonna kill, kill your sons They’re gonna kill, kill your sons Until they run run run run run run run run away Mom informed me on the phone She didn’t know what to do about dad Took an axe and broke the table Aren’t you glad you’re married And sister, she got married on the island And her husband takes the train He’s big and he’s fat and he doesn’t even have a brain They’re gonna kill your sons Don’t you know, they’re gonna kill, kill your sons Don’t you know, they’re gonna kill, kill your sons Until they run away Creedmore treated me very good But Paine Whitney was even better And when I flipped on PHC I was so sad I didn’t even get a letter All of the drugs, that we took, it really was lots of fun But when they shoot you up with thorizene on crystal smoke You choke like a son of a gun Don’t you know, they’re gonna kill your sons Don’t you know, they’re gonna kill, kill your sons They’re gonna kill, kill your sons Until they run run run run run run run run away (c) Lou Reed\n\n9.\n\nNever Really Been Gone 03:19\n\nNever believed much in apparitions Or any confrontations With someone I know who once went away Calling all the ghost inside me Or anyone to guide me All along the way I’ve fallen through Throw your heartaches away When you’re here I wanna stay No I know you’ve never really been gone There was a time when I felt so jaded And very overrated There’s a picture I’ve just begun to see Just a bell but I know I hear you And though I long to see you I know that I’m not alone anymore So call my name in the wind Now I know just where you’ve been When I say you’ve never really been gone Yeah I feel alright to be here Inside we are two Everything is getting clearer I know it’s true. In a silent night I wonder If I’ll make it through If it’s just the spell I’m under Please say it’s you So clear away all the devastation Cause there’s a new elation We’re riding on to bluer skies Throw your heartaches away When you’re here I wanna stay Now I know you’ve never really been gone Yeah I know you’ve never really been gone.\n\n10.\n\nWhy do people fall apart when things aren't really quite so bad? And were you looking for the type of life you thought we never had? And does it matter that the world gets so confused with everyone Always looking for that place beyond the sun? There's a bridge on the water There's a light by the sea And when you've run from all the others Call on me When the headlinеs scream for more than just reaction You'vе felt so down a river Where your life would soon unfold There's a bridge on the water There's a light by the sea And when you've run from all the others Call on me In the morning, I woke up to find That we'd left all the old times behind Now if I've lost something, I cannot say But I'm feeling it now every day"
