        "text": "ABOUT THE ALBUM\n\n“Carry Me” is Jason’s debut album and tells a follow-up personal story of seemingly being born again from ashes. The first song on the album “Lost It All (Only Road)” sets the precedent for what is to become a personal triumph over struggles that leave us with no other choice but to pick up our wreckage and try another way.\n\nAs a guitarist for the popular Minneapolis based “36Headshots” in the mid 1990’s, playing venues such as First Avenue & 7th Street Entry, The Cabooze, and the Turf Club he gained the necessary live experience and motivation to relocate to Seattle to front his own original alternative rock band. Having had local success with performances at Sasquatch and Bumbershoot music festivals, local radio airplay and performances on KEXP, Jason found himself developing the stories which eventually led to the recording of “Carry Me\" at John Richardson’s “Drum Farm” studios in Menomonie, WI.\n\nABOUT WAREEN THOMAS FENZI\n\nWarren Thomas Fenzi is best known for his explorations in sound, storytelling and songwriting that draw from the wide open landscapes of the Southwest of which he grew up around. As a multi-instrumentalist, Fenzi concocts a diverse array of sounds and styles hinting at Indie Rock, Ambient, Soul and Folk. His aim is to create something refreshing, inspiring and innovative while inviting his listeners on a journey of introspection. With a strong undercurrent of Warren’s work maintaining a message of honesty, growth and transformation, he continues to evolve his art with an unyielding earnestness that is undeniable.\n\nFenzi recently released his debut album titled \"WTF\" and is currently working on a follow up EP, set to be released December 4th, 2018."
