        "text": "1.\n\nSo Low (2023 Remaster) 03:49\n\nyou travel so low through the blue underground you come and you go remain within and without while I am already gone now you take the slow road to get where you once belonged in from the unknown but we have already gone I am already gone now I was there and gone when you faded from the sun burned and out of luck since you can’t remember when downed by every love asking everyone “could this really be the end?” for you and your only friend you held us so low you do not know who we are you come and you go but we have already gone and I am already gone now I was already gone when you faded from the sun downed and out of luck since you can’t remember when burned by every love asking everyone “could this really be the end?” for you and your only friend when you faded in the sun burned and out of luck since you can’t remember when downed by every love and telling everyone again you slide behind the sun knowing all you’ve done could really mean the end for you and your only friend\n\n2.\n\nI tried to open up your heart but I couldn’t find it up on a shelf inside a jar as you lay down beside it and pretend not to hide but all the times denied I wondered who you are as I am looking further in floating through your disguises until the game is wearing thin or you run out of surprises I pretend not to notice so instead I’m holding on to this feeling that I need I need to know what you are you know me so show me the secret key to open your heart you know it’s true but don’t show it and you have been an enigma to me from the start I would tell you things have changed but I never know how I strike a match, ignite a flame just to see you explode now by now you should have discovered there couldn’t be any other one but you to blame you know me, so show me the secret key to open your heart you know it but don’t show it you’ve been an enigma to me from the start I can’t get through till you fall apart to know you, to show you the secret key to open your heart you know me now so show me how to find a way to open your heart you know it but don’t show it the secret key to open your heart you know it’s true but don’t show it and you have been an enigma to me from the start\n\n3.\n\nSML (2023 Remaster) 03:42\n\nwill you walk with me off into the heather can I stay with you on your mountainside could you save my life would you follow me up into the ether will you keep your name always next to mine will you save my life save my life save me will you save my life save my life will you save my life\n\n4.\n\nstraight for the day the money’s done again in time you find you can pay as you go once you’re gone long enough enough to know lightless parade cut off at the source you’re too far inside to collide with your own when you fall far enough enough to know wandering free from the borderline shadowed and far from us now reload this scene it has grown so old traded away keeping it unreal lies for a lie then you’re stranger than shown once you go far enough enough to know the distance between and the sleepless nights shadowed, half forgotten now ghosted like it’s over it is not quite so but close enough\n\n5.\n\ntake a little time before you close another door and tell me that you can remember what you’re fighting for if you take a little time and slowly try again to feel it won’t be long there’s always so much more to do then we break down and resolve to carry on you’re always tangled up in blue when you should be lost in a song take a little time before you close another door and tell me that you can remember what you’re fighting for if you take a little time and slowly try again to feel it won’t be long before you know this is for real the world it pulls us at the seems to tear us apart at what cost over the years but we can gather up our dreams and make a new start after the tears now there’s a cold rain falling don’t let it drive your hope away why don’t you stay and take a little time before you close another door and tell me that you can remember what you’re fighting for if you take a little time and slowly try again to feel it won’t be long before you know this is for real please don’t wait too long take a little time before you close another door and tell me that you can remember what you’re fighting for if you take a little time and slowly try again to feel it won’t be long before you know this is for real if you take a little time and slowly try again to feel it won’t be long before you know this is for real it won’t be long before you know I am for real\n\n6.\n\nOtherwhile (2023 Remaster) 02:51\n\nyou split the night in stereo you take your turn at turning it on you slip the strand you’re looking through you tip your hand and head from the bar traded gold for umber makes me wonder when you leave me otherwhile from another time and place in the otherwhile away you know when no one’s watching you you work the room like some fallen star I’ve got no place I’m running to I sit it out and watch from afar lose you over under makes me wonder where you you split the night in stereo you take your turn at turning us on I lose you over under makes me wonder why you leave me otherwhile from another time and place in the otherwhile away\n\n7.\n\nwe walked in star shine at the top of the world 1000 wan lights at the top of the world how about one more before we go there’s a song that we both know you can change it all around empty and golden, other side of the world older and colder, other side of the world how about one more before I go there’s a song that we both know you will change it all around we’re going to go the long way I love you too much you said I know you don’t feel right even as I’m holding on so tight we’ll take the day and when you're weary I will bring you home I’ll take you home how about one more before we go with a song that we both know you will never be alone now you have changed it all around\n\n8.\n\nsince you’re away, I can’t explain the sun went out and now that you’ve gone an absence like the sun burned out picked up the phone forgetting that the day was night wanted to say that even though we’ve lost some light you will open your eyes, appear before mine and we’ll steal back our time with only a sea between us you’re only a dream away we’re watching the same stars at night with only a sea between us I’m only a dream away we’re tracking the same stars tonight, under the same sky we follow the same fading light\n\n9.\n\nWild Chump (2023 Remaster) 02:27\n\nafter time has told you and run out when you’re finest hour can’t be found every minute makes you wait so you stop for a while every word may leave you high and dry or at best a temporary smile when there’s nothing left inside you can stop for a while and radiate so you stop for a while and radiate stop for a while and radiate radiate\n\n10.\n\nWrong (2023 Remaster) 03:46\n\nI’ve tried to remember what this is better than if I knew now what I knew then and if I’m not what I thought all along I must be wrong I must be wrong I must be wrong it’s easy to imagine how it could come to this I’ve traced a path to nowhere then I forgot what I thought all along I must be wrong I must be wrong I must be wrong I should’ve taken care I hear what I want to I could have been high instead of down here it’s hard to remember if I was better then and how I got so far from where I thought I must be wrong I must be wrong I must be wrong oh so wrong\n\n11.\n\nI know it’s not your fault the time was here, the trip was underway you called us home , the ghost moon waned October rose in frozen rain again you couldn’t stay to say goodnight you couldn’t stay to say goodnight tonight you leave us silent in your wake living from reflections I travel empty spaces and the traces of you there I see you now, I hear you I feel you near I see you now, I hear you I feel you near I see you now, I feel you near why can’t I touch you\n\n12.\n\nRattling around like a Monday pain Starting all over again Classic bringdown, old new way Changing changes, swearing it’s not the same Then lost inside but remembering Something that my Jade and I used to play I go on a Riverside ride to loose this heavy air One last backward glance and I’m halfway there Three weeks, three years, just another day Blown now, coming up for air and then Too much low flying is the take-away Saved the changes, crossed off another name Almost forgot when I tried remembering Something else that my Jade used to play The cool of a September Song will keep us keeping on One last backward glance and I’m halfway gone I wait for a Riverside vibe to move me far beyond One last backward glance and I’m halfway gone Just spin a side everybody can dig, that modal affair One last backward glance and I’m halfway there I’m halfway there\n\n13."
