        "text": "BARRY Gibb formed one-third of one of the most successful musical trios in history - the Bee Gees.\n\nHis twin brothers Maurice and Robin have sadly left us, but Barry is still going strong and is now set to join Take That for their 30th anniversary TV special. Here's his story...\n\nWho is Barry Gibb, how old is he and what's his net worth?\n\nBarry was born September 1, 1946.\n\nHe is a British singer, songwriter and record producer.\n\nHe shot to worldwide fame as a co-founder of the group Bee Gees in the late 50s, along with his brothers, Robin and Maurice.\n\nThe band continued to have success until his brothers died - Maurice in 2003 and Robin in 2012.\n\nIn the 2017 New Year's Honours list, Barry was knighted for his services to music and charity.\n\nThe 72-year-old dedicated his award to his brothers and said it was \"theirs as it is mine\".\n\nDue to his worldwide success, Barry Gibb has amassed quite a fortune and is estimated to be worth £71million.\n\nWhat are the Bee Gees biggest songs?\n\nThe Bee Gees were a world-famous band and notched up many hits internationally.\n\nTheir only album to reach the top of the UK charts was Spirits Having Flown in 1979.\n\nThey had five UK Single No1 hits and 19 top ten releases.\n\nTheir five number one singles were Massachusetts, I've Gotta Get a Message to You, Night Fever, Tragedy and You Win Again.\n\nTheir other big songs include:\n\nStayin' Alive\n\nHow Deep Is Your Love\n\nTo Love Somebody\n\nJive Talkin'\n\nMore Than A Woman\n\nHeartbreaker\n\nDon't Forget to Remember\n\nToo Much Heaven\n\nYou Should Be Dancing\n\nWill he be joining Take That?\n\nOn September 29, 2018, The Sun exclusively revealed Barry will join Take That for a TV special marking the band’s 30th anniversary.\n\nThe band are collaborating with the 72-year-old singer-songwriter as part of their celebrations.\n\nIt is understood they will record a version of the Bee Gees’ original hit How Deep Is Your Love, ­covered by Take That in 1996, and one new track.\n\nA source said: “Barry may not be your typical boy band member but he’s a British music legend.\n\n“Obviously the Bee Gees influenced Take That’s early years massively.\n\n\"The lads cannot wait to get in the studio.”"
