His zodiac sign is Virgo.\n\nBarry Gibb's spouse\n\nThe beloved singer was married twice, first to Maureen Bates, from 1966 to 1970. Little to no information is available on their meeting or why they split, and Maureen went on to live a private life outside of the public eye since their divorce.\n\nBarry initially met his now-wife, Linda Gray, in 1967. The couple met on the set of Top of the Pops in London and instantly hit it off. The couple married in 1970 and have been happily married since.\n\nHow old is Barry Gibb's wife?\n\nLinda Gray was born on September 12, 1940.

Lesley Gibb was born on January 12, 1945, in Douglas, Isle of Man, and has remained a reclusive figure.\n\nRobin Hugh Gibb was born on December 22, 1949, in Douglas, Isle of Man. He was one of the Bee Gees, as was Maurice Ernest Gibb. Maurice was also born as Robin's twin brother on December 22, 1949.\n\nAndrew Roy Gibb, the last brother, was born on March 5, 1958, in Manchester, United Kingdom. He unfortunately passed away on March 10, 1988. The singer-songwriter and actor died from Myocarditis.\n\nWho was the richest Gibb brother?\n\nRobin was among the richest siblings, sparking curiosity about his net worth. How much is Robin Gibb's estate worth? Robin Gibb’s net worth was $80 million at the time of his death in 2012, but other reports state his entire estate was valued at £93 million.\n\nAccording to The Age, Maurice Gibb’s net worth, including assets, was $2 million, leaving it all to his wife and children. Andy Gibb's net worth was reportedly $5 million at his death.\n\nLesley Gibb's net worth is mainly reported as $8 million but remains unconfirmed. This means that Barry Gibb is the richest Gibb brother.\n\nHow much is Barry Gibb worth?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth and various other sources, Barry Gibb’s net worth is $140 million. His second-richest sibling has a net worth of $80 million.\n\nHow much did Barry Gibb pay for Johnny Cash's house?\n\nIconic singer Johnny Cash's home, which he shared with his long-term partner, June, was put on the market in 2003. Barry Gibb bought the house in 2005 for $2.3 million.\n\nUnfortunately, a tragic fire began while renovations were underway in the home in 2007, leaving the house in limbo. The home was sold to a local couple in 2020 for $3.2 million.\n\nBarry Gibb's net worth is substantial, thanks to his role in the massively commercial group Bee Gees. Their loyal fans who have continued to support their work have helped them gather a significant net worth to support themselves and their loved ones following their tragic passings.\n\nREAD ALSO: Joni Mitchell’s spouses: An inside look into her current and previous relationships\n\nBriefly.co.za wrote about the colourful romantic life of Joni Mitchell, a Canadian-American singer-songwriter and painter.
