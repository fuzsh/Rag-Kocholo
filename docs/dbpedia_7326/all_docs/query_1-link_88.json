        "text": "The son of Bee Gees legend Barry Gibb was once left homeless after spiralling into drug addiction.\n\nStephen Gibb, first-born son of Barry Gibb and Linda Gibb, describes his battle with cocaine in a new podcast.\n\nHe reveals that at one point he was reduced to eating out of a dumpster.\n\nHe says: \"I was living in my van or wherever I could land. If somebody let me crash on a couch I was fortunate.\n\n\"The thing for me that was mind blowing was the old saying, from Park Avenue to park bench.\n\n\"After I lost my gig with my band I was homeless. They throw away so much good food in studios and I remember eating out of the dumpster at the record plant praying nobody would see me. I remember thinking ‘This sucks’.”\n\nStephen, 46, who has turned his life around, now plays guitar and tours with his dad, the last survivor of the Bee Gees.\n\nHe also talked about growing up in a famous family beset by “problems”.\n\nFormer Bee Gees star Maurice Gibb had alcohol issues while Andy Gibb died in 1988 aged 30, his heart fatally\n\nweakened by years of cocaine abuse.\n\nSpeaking on the podcast Addiction Talks, Stephen says: “The first time I drank I was probably 14 and downed an entire bottle of Jack Daniels [and] blacked out.”\n\nEventually he moved on to drugs. However homelessness made him determined to recover: “It was either death, prison or a mental institution.”\n\nHis dad Barry formed the mega-successful Bee Gees in 1958 with his twin brothers Maurice and Robin.\n\nThe family grew up in Chorlton, Manchester and Brother Andy, became a solo act. The ban’s 1977 record Saturday Night Fever is the top soundtrack album ever.\n\nRobin, died in 2012 aged 62 from liver and kidney failure after battling cancer. Maurice died in 2003 aged 53.\n\nBarry, who knighted in 2018, is now 73 and lives in Miami."
