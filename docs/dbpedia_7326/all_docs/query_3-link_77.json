The 71-year-old attended the ceremony with his wife Linda, and his children Michael, Alexandra and Ashley.\n\nThe Bee Gees are considered to be one of the most successful bands in history, selling over 120m albums worldwide and releasing hits including \"Staying Alive\", \"Night Fever\" and \"Tragedy\".\n\nGlastonbury 2017\n\nShow all 48\n\nMaurice Gibb died after suffering a heart attack during a bowel operation in 2003, and his twin Robin passed away from cancer in 2012.\n\n\"If it was not for my brothers, I would not be here,\" Sir Barry said. \"If I had spent my whole life writing songs on my own, it would have meant something else altogether. I hope and pray they are aware of what's happened.\"\n\nHe said the experience was \"a bit surreal\" although he added: \"It is a high award that your culture can give you and that is something I am enormously proud of.\"\n\nDetailing his conversation with Prince Charles, Sir Barry said they had met a few times and he was \"always very nice to me and I hope he is king\".\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
