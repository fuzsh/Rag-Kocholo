        "text": "Ever since Maurice passed away in 2003, it was obvious to me that Robin wanted nothing to do with Barry. During the last decade or so, Robin kept running around Europe performing in concert and singing every Bee Gees song, or making music on his own, despite saying that he hoped to work with Barry again and that they had a few ideas - it never happened! Except for a few rare exceptions where they both met up for a brief interview or to accept an award, they never made any music or performed together, and it seems to me that Robin was the one who wanted nothing to do with Barry for the remaining years he was alive.\n\nDoes anybody know the real story? Did Robin alway hate Barry deep down and when Maurice died, he said, that's it...I'm done with Barry!?\n\nHow can you hate your own brother?\n\nDarryl\n\nHate might too strong a word, but the impression I got is that Barry and Robin were both forceful personalities who always found it difficult to work together (Robin was the first of the brothers to jump ship when the group briefly split up in the late 60's, and Barry was the last to agree to rejoin). Apparently, Maurice did often play the role of peacemaker in the family, and once he was gone, the buffer the group needed to function was gone as well.\n\nMaurice was literally the \"Man In the Middle\" like the song title states, and he was the glue for the group given the polarity of Barry and Robin. My perspective of what happened after 2003 is that they each dealt with their grief in different and incompatible ways: Barry sunk into depression while Robin toured the world singing his and his brother's songs, against the wishes of Barry IIRC (he felt it was tarnishing, not enhancing the legacy, and having heard the live album from 2005 I completely agree).\n\nIt is a shame they couldn't have worked together on at least one more Bee Gees record (and second one without one brother, after Cucumber Castle). Actually many of the First Fame era were B Gibb/R Gibb compositions.\n\nIt could be that there is no personal issues and that they just prefer to do what they are doing separately for reasons none of us can imagine.\n\nThey are old. They have done this for a long time. Maybe they just want to do what they want for a change instead of being tied to some public perception of \"The BeeGees\".\n\nOne of them publically disagreeing with something the other is doing doesn't necessarily imply some kind of deep schism.\n\nIt was only nine years between Maurice and Robin's passing, and that interval may not have been enough time for Barry and Robin to find some artistic common ground. Even before Maurice's passing, Barry seemed more eager to retire from the band thing, and from music in general, while Robin, whose muse seemed increasingly to operate on a different channel from the whole Bee Gees thing circa the 1970s, was the most active about making his own music on stage and on record. By then, the Bee Gees had become Barry & Co., while Robin was the most active in terms of solo releases. Robin going back with Barry would have been effectively putting his own ideas and singing literally into the background. Even up to the end, he wasn't willing to do that.\n\nThe fact is that Robin, and Barry to an extent, kept saying that they \"hope\" to make some music again together, so if they really wanted to, they would have done it...they're both very prolific people. However, the way Robin kept touring Europe and giving interviews year and year on his own, made any possible reunion almost impossible! Unfortunately for Barry, he really didn't get do too much at all either, except for working on the GUILTY PLEASURES album with Barbra Streisand in 2005, as I get the feeling that Barry was really waiting for Robin and would have absolutely jumped at the chance to get out there again and make music with him, except that Robin didn't want any part of it. Proof of this is that Robin kept a tight schedule touring as Robin Gibb until near his death.\n\nOf course, this is all speculation, but the fact is that they didn't work together again after Maurice died and that is sad, as many years were wasted that could have resulted in some fine work and songs.\n\nYes, I agree, and apparently Robin wanted nothing to do with Barry after Maurice's death, at least when it came to working with him again. He still did the rare appearance here and there with Barry of course, but I knew that he never wanted to make music with Barry again, so obviously, Robin must have disliked or resented Barry big time...right to the end! In retrospect, it's amazing the Bee Gees even stayed together until 2003.\n\nYeah. Barry appeared completely ill at ease continuing as the Bee Gees without Maurice while Robin wanted nothing more than to work with his older brother again. A few people have mentioned this despite Barry's proclamations that Robin had always wanted to be a solo artist. Robin obviously needed an outlet for his writing talents which is why he released the most solo material of the three. This is no surprise considering that Barry basically took over the Bee Gees after Main Course. The two of them always seemed to have quite a difficult relationship while Maurice got on well with them both. It's no great mystery that they never wrote again together after Mo died. Barry just didn't seem to care. At least Robin went out on an artistic high, I think the Titanic Requiem is a lovely piece of work.\n\nSo, it really was Robin who wanted to make music with Barry again, and Barry who killed the opportunity? I'm not so sure, but that's why I started the thread...to try and find out what really happened.\n\nI'm not sure how true this is, but I think I read somewhere that Barry was upset with Robin regarding Maurice's funeral arrangements...apparently leaving him out on some details, but again, I'm not sure if this is the case or not? So, it's possible that Barry was pissed off, but only after Robin mistreated him?\n\nIn any event, Robin had always wanted to make a name for himself as a solo artist from the very beginning and after Maurice died, he kept touring and touring and touring on his own. I guess there was so much animosity between them that any thought of them getting together was an idea that would never see the light of day anyway, and if Robin was the initial cause, I can't blame Barry for not wanting Robin around while making the GUILTY PLEASURES album...yeah, it must have got really bad and ugly between them near the end.\n\nYou are aware Robin passed away last year, right ?\n\nActually Barry admitted in an interview recently that at the time of each of his brother's passing, he was not on speaking terms with each one. It was a heartbreaking interview and I recall he even got a bit choked up admitting that and said it \"was his cross to bear\" or something to that effect.\n\nI don't know why, as a collective \"we\", the music-buying fans... can't just enjoy what the Gibbs, or any other group, recorded.. and allow them to retire, stop, bicker, or whatever keeps them from making more music.\n\nwe always seem to pine for more, hoping for one more album.. like we have a vested interest.. like we can't stand for our music heroes to be anything but the artists we liked, and who get along with each other, wanting to keep cranking out music for us to hear.\n\nI'm always reading about an unearthed, never-heard recording, from 1974, or when ever, by (name of famous classic rock artist)... who cares? it wasn't heard before, because it's rubbish"
