The brothers later changed the name to Wee Johnny Hayes and the Blue Cats.\n\nLater that year, the Gibbs left the UK for Australia. The band soon changed its name to Bee Gees.\n\nTheir talent brought them to the attention of DJ Bill Gates (not that one), and it wasn't long before they secured their first record deal.\n\nBarry Gibb emotionally reflects on losing his brothers\n\nWho is Barry Gibb's wife and does he have any children?\n\nBarry Gibb's first marriage was to Maureen Bates. They married in 1966 when he was aged 19.\n\nWhen Barry Gibb invited his son and Maurice's daughter on stage for emotional revival of 'Stayin' Alive'\n\nThe couple lived together for a short period, and divorced in 1970.\n\nWhile recording Top of the Pops, Barry met the former Miss Edinburgh, Linda Gray. Later in 1970, the couple got married.\n\nBarry and Linda have five children: Stephen (born 1973), Ashley (born 1977), Travis (born 1981), Michael (born 1984) and Alexandra (born 1991).\n\nWhat songs has Barry Gibb written?\n\nDolly Parton interview: 40 years of Islands in the Stream and writing 'Jolene'\n\nBarry Gibb, a prolific songwriter, has written numerous songs both for the Bee Gees and for other artists. Some of his notable works include:\n\nFor the Bee Gees:\n\n- 'Stayin' Alive'\n\n- 'How Deep Is Your Love'\n\n- 'Night Fever'\n\n- 'Tragedy'\n\n- 'Jive Talkin''\n\n- 'You Should Be Dancing'\n\n- 'More Than a Woman'\n\n- 'Too Much Heaven'\n\n- 'Words'\n\n- 'To Love Somebody'\n\nFor Other Artists:\n\n- 'Islands in the Stream' (Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton)\n\n- 'Heartbreaker' (Dionne Warwick)\n\n- 'Guilty' (Barbra Streisand)\n\n- 'Woman in Love' (Barbra Streisand)\n\n- 'Grease' (Frankie Valli)\n\n- 'Chain Reaction' (Diana Ross)\n\n- 'Emotion' (Samantha Sang)\n\nBarry Gibb nearly died when he was a baby\n\nWhen Barry was nearly two years old, he was badly scalded.

He had to stay in hospital for two and a half months.\n\nHe later said: \"Then the gangrene set in. Because in those days, the advancement of medicine simply didn't apply to people with bad scalds, so you didn't have skin grafts, you didn't have things like that.\n\n\"But this was a particularly bad scald, and I think I had 20 minutes to live at some point. The incredible thing for me is that whole two years is wiped from my memory, the whole period of being in hospital.\n\n\"The idea of being burnt is in there somewhere, but I have no knowledge of it. I've got the scars but I have no knowledge.\""
