        "text": "Oscar S. De Priest\n\nCongressman Oscar De Priest was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1929, representing Illinois’ first Congressional District. De Priest, a Republican, was the first African American elected to Congress in the 20th century and the first Black representative elected from a northern state. His election ended a 28-year absence of Black legislators in Congress. A well-known Chicago businessman and politician, De Priest was the only Black legislator during the 71st – 73rd Congresses. While in office, he spoke out against racial discrimination, calling for the desegregation of the House restaurant and key government initiatives such as Roosevelt’s work programs. Notably, De Priest appointed Benjamin O. Davis Jr. to the United States Military Academy when the only African American line officer in the Army was Davis’s father. Upon leaving Congress, De Priest returned to Chicago City Council and was an alderman.\n\nArthur W. Mitchell\n\nCongressman Arthur W. Mitchell was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1935 after defeating Oscar De Priest for his seat. Representing Illinois’ first Congressional District, Mitchell was the first African American Democrat elected to the House. Initially a Republican, Mitchell changed parties during the early days of Roosevelt’s New Deal. During his four terms, he was the lone African American member in Congress. A lawyer and businessman, Mitchell began teaching in rural schools in Georgia and Alabama. Later he founded the Armstrong Agricultural School in West Butler, Alabama, and served as president for ten years. A fierce Roosevelt loyalist, Mitchell was highly scrutinized by Black leaders and organizations as not being progressive enough on civil rights. He introduced legislation banning lynching and discrimination. He also filed a lawsuit against the Illinois Central and Rock Island Railroads after being forced into a segregated train car just before it passed into Arkansas. This case was advanced to the U.S. Supreme Court as Mitchell v. the United States, which ruled that the railroad violated the Interstate Commerce Act. In his last congressional act, Mitchell condemned politicians as preferring the Axis powers over giving Negros any rights, comparing the atrocities of the Nazis and Japanese with the lynching of African Americans. Mitchell attended Tuskegee Institute, Columbia, and Harvard before being admitted to Washington D.C. Bar.\n\nWilliam L. Dawson\n\nCongressman William L.
