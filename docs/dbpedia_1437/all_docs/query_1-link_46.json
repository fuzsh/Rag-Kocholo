        "text": "Electoral Management\n\nElectoral management encompasses both the entity responsible for governing elections and the various mechanisms, roles and functions this entity may have. While all democracies have an election administration of some kind (often referred to as Electoral Management Bodies, or EMBs for short), the responsibilities of this entity may vary substantially. From only being responsible for the polling, conducting and tabulating of votes, EMB responsibilities can extend to also include registration of political parties, oversight of campaign finance, design of the ballot papers, drawing of electoral boundaries, resolution of electoral disputes, civic and voter education and media monitoring.\n\nConsequently, electoral management bodies vary greatly in shape and size. However, as the agencies responsible for governing elections and referenda, EMBs are ultimately responsible for safeguarding the legitimacy of democratic institutions and the peaceful transitions of power. Therefore, they need to ensure all aspects of any electoral contest meets global norms and follows the fundamental guiding principles of elections, including independence, impartiality, integrity, transparency, efficiency, professionalism and service-mindedness.\n\nThis Electoral Management Encyclopaedia topic seeks to bring together the knowledge and expertise that has been gathered worldwide about the structure and functioning of Electoral Management Bodies. By highlighting key principles and good practices from different parts of the world, the aim of this topic is to promote professional, impartial, accountable, and sustainable electoral management and EMBs that perform in the best interest of the voters.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOverview\n\nThe credibility and legitimacy of electoral processes is inextricably linked to electoral integrity. The Global Commission on Democracy, Elections and Security identified five major challenges to the conduct of elections with integrity in its 2012 report:\n\nBuilding the rule of law to substantiate claims to human rights and electoral justice;\n\nDeveloping professional and competent electoral management bodies (EMBs) with full independence of action;\n\nCreating institutions and norms of multiparty competition and division of power;\n\nRemoving barriers to universal and equal political participation; and\n\nRegulating political finance.\n\nEach of these challenges requires a multidimensional response that combines political will, effective institutional design and effective mobilization, implementation and management in practice.\n\nThe organization and administration of multiparty democratic elections was not previously considered newsworthy. An election or direct democracy poll— such as a referendum—is, however, often the single largest activity that is ever organized in a country. It is a very complex administrative task, which is implemented in a politically charged atmosphere. When it is done well, it may attract little comment. When it is not done well, or when it is undermined, the effects can be catastrophic.\n\nThe administration of many electoral events, however, passed largely unnoticed, except by those directly affected, even though the losing political parties often challenged the conduct of the election and its results. From around the mid- 1980s, this began to change. The conduct of democratic elections began to be seen, and reported, as a central element of transitions from authoritarianism or conflict resolution. Elections came to be more closely scrutinized by political parties, the media, and international and citizen election observers.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, there has also been an unprecedented commitment to electoral reforms around the world, driven by the realization in political and electoral administration circles that changing social environments required a rethink of electoral arrangements, by the critical attention of the media and election observers and by the emergence of global and regional organizations promoting democracy. As scrutiny of elections increased, from the early 1990s the lack of experience and the ‘knowledge gap’ in the technical know-how for election management was overtaken by a ‘credibility gap’ in many electoral institutions—a diminished public conﬁdence in the integrity and diligence of their activities.\n\nPublic interest has more often been focused on reforming electoral systems to enhance representation. Yet reforms to the machinery for organizing and administering electoral events are of equal importance. These include a trend toward establishing autonomous electoral management bodies with wide-ranging powers and responsibilities, and the improvement of electoral organization in order to deliver higher-quality electoral services more effectively, while enhancing the freeness and fairness of electoral events.\n\nAs the administration of elections has received more scrutiny, it has also become more professional. Electoral managers have learned from experience—their own and that of non-electoral organizations—and have formed links and networks through which ideas and practices are shared and electoral standards may be raised. There are different organizational approaches to the design and conduct of elections, but there are many common themes and issues faced by all electoral administrators.\n\nAs electoral administration has developed through greater professionalism, it has had to respond to greater challenges. In addition to their tasks related to implementing election laws and managing electoral technicalities, some EMBs have assumed responsibilities in highly political areas, for example the oversight of political finance, the registration and oversight of political parties, the role and activities of the media during elections, and the promotion of political participation. In addition, the ingenuity of those who wish to undermine the integrity of elections means that electoral administrators can never rest on their laurels: protecting electoral integrity can require a continual leapfrog process for the EMB to keep ahead.\n\nThis Topic Area is intended to be a resource to directly support those who are responding to the challenge identified by the Global Commission to build professional, competent and fully independent EMBs. In doing so, it may also support those who are responding to the commission’s other four challenges. It seeks to bring together the knowledge and expertise that has been gathered worldwide about EMB roles and functions, and the organization, ﬁnancing and management of election administration. It identiﬁes examples of practices that have been successful and those that have been less successful. It recognizes that different models may be appropriate in different contexts, and does not in general seek to be normative or prescriptive beyond the basic characteristics sought in good electoral processes: freedom, fairness, equity, integrity, voting secrecy, transparency, effectiveness, sustainability, service- mindedness, efﬁciency, impartiality and accountability.\n\nThe prime objective in compiling this topic area has been to provide practical information in a form that is easily accessible and (to the greatest extent possible) free of theorizing and electoral or management jargon. It contains information that is useful not only to those establishing institutions involved in managing elections, those in newly established electoral institutions and those in emerging democracies. This Topic Area also offers a wide range of experiences and information on good practices for those interested in assessing performance and improving administration in well-established EMBs. Equally, it provides useful data to all who have an interest or stake in electoral administration—whether in governments, political parties, the media or civil society organizations, or as interested observers of political and electoral matters.\n\nContext\n\nThe status, function, and activity of an election management body (EMB), as with any arm of government, is influenced by the social and political context within which it operates:\n\nthe level of democratic consolidation and political stability,\n\nliteracy rates,\n\nurbanisation,\n\npopulation,\n\nmobility,\n\naffluence,\n\nculture,\n\ntraditions, and\n\nmany others\n\nThe ethical principles of election administration should, nevertheless, be capable of being fulfilled whatever the economic, social, and political conditions. If they are not, the very basis of the democratic process will be brought into question.\n\nIn established democracies, administration and management of elections are often carried out by officials of the national or local government, and disputes are settled in ordinary courts. Traditions of fairness and neutrality mean that both the EMB and the courts enjoy the confidence and respect of the participants in the electoral process.\n\nThe context of election management also includes a country's history. Many developing countries have electoral practices based on the electoral laws of former colonial powers; many countries in Africa, especially, can show direct linkage to the legal tradition of the former colonial power.\n\nIn the cultural context, traditional methods of decision making that have been handed down for hundreds or even thousands of years tend to influence people's perceptions of the electoral process and should be taken into consideration by electoral policy makers and election officials.\n\nThe ability of the EMB to discharge its functions is also critically dependent on the social context of the country. A number of factors are tied to the EMB's functions, including literacy rates, costs and availability of local labour, electricity, and other utility supplies. For example, a country that is poorly endowed may opt for a temporary and centralised election administration, while an affluent country may have permanent and decentralised election management. The same goes for the conditions of service for EMB members and staff.\n\nVoter education is particularly influenced by literacy. In countries with low literacy rates, the use of party symbols has had a significant impact in making the campaign and the voting process more easily understood by the electorate.\n\nIf there is no electricity, or an undependable supply, or poor broadcasting facilities, information for voters must be disseminated by means other than radio or television. Election managers may need to set up their own radio network for administrative purposes, using shortwave radios to link local, regional, and national election offices, if telephone service is unavailable or unreliable.\n\nComputerisation can take a great deal of the monotonous routine out of election work, improve the flow of management information, and improve the speed and quality of the whole process. To work effectively, though, computer systems need a guaranteed power supply (to the point that even large back-up generators are usually advisable as a cautionary measure) and a trained workforce. The cost of the computer system, including all the related equipment, must be measured against the cost of employing and training as necessary a local work force to meet the needs of the election management body.\n\nThe procurement of supplies is an area in which there are more and more companies able to supply ever more highly specialized equipment and supplies, at a cost. Local suppliers may be able to supply many items, such as voting screens, at the best final cost if realistic specifications are set, if adequate time is available, and if the process is properly managed. In some places such as Honduras (1993), voting screens are simply pieces of fabric tacked across the corner of a room.\n\nThe social and political context is especially relevant in any consideration of election security. In some countries such as Peru (1993), the military or police are seen as allies of the civilian population in an ongoing struggle against terrorists, and their participation in the electoral process is therefore welcomed by the people. Elsewhere, the voters may perceive any military involvement in the electoral process even in the delivery of equipment and supplies to be almost sure evidence of an intent to defraud the process, in which case other measures may be needed to deliver necessary materials and ensure the security of the process.\n\nWhat is an Electoral Management Body (EMB)?\n\nThe complexity and specialist skills necessary for electoral management require that an institution or institutions be responsible for electoral activities. Such bodies have a variety of shapes and sizes, with a wide range of titles to match, such as Election Commission, Department of Elections, Electoral Council, Election Unit or Electoral Board. The term electoral management body (EMB) has been coined to refer to the body or bodies responsible for electoral management, regardless of the wider institutional framework in place.\n\nAn EMB is an organization or body that has the sole purpose of, and is legally responsible for, managing some or all of the elements that are essential for the conduct of elections and direct democracy instruments—such as referendums, citizens’ initiatives and recall votes—if those are part of the legal framework. These essential (or core) elements include:\n\ndetermining who is eligible to vote;\n\nreceiving and validating the nominations of electoral participants (for elections, political parties and/or candidates);\n\nconducting polling;\n\ncounting the votes; and\n\ntabulating the votes.\n\nIf these essential elements are allocated to various bodies, then all bodies that share these responsibilities can be considered EMBs. An EMB may be a stand- alone institution, or a distinct management unit within a larger institution that may also have non-electoral tasks.\n\nIn addition to these essential elements, an EMB may undertake other tasks that assist in the conduct of elections and direct democracy instruments, such as voter registration, boundary delimitation, voter education and information, media monitoring and electoral dispute resolution. However, a body that has no electoral responsibilities other than, for example, boundary delimitation (such as a boundary delimitation commission), electoral dispute resolution (such as an electoral court), election media monitoring (such as a media monitoring commission), or the conduct of voter education and information (such as a civic education commission) is not considered an EMB because it is not managing any of the essential elements identiﬁed above. Similarly, a national population or statistics bureau that produces electoral registers as part of the general process of population registration is not considered to be an EMB.\n\nDifferent EMBs may be established for different electoral processes. In Mexico and Poland, the EMBs are responsible for both presidential and parliamentary elections; in Australia, the national EMB deals with national-level elections, while state-level elections are the responsibility of separate state-level EMBs. In the United Kingdom (UK), the arrangements for the conduct of elections and referendums are separate.\n\nSome bodies that are not engaged in any of the essential elements of elections may nonetheless be popularly regarded as EMBs. The US Federal Election Commission (FEC) defines its mission as ‘administering and enforcing federal campaign finance laws’. However, such institutions do not qualify as EMBs under the deﬁnition above.\n\nIn addition to the division of functional responsibility for different elements of the electoral process, electoral responsibilities may be divided between bodies at different levels. For example, some elements of the conduct of elections may be managed by a national-level electoral commission, a ministry (such as the Ministry of the Interior) or a national government agency, while others are implemented by local-level commissions, regional branches of government departments or local authorities (as in Spain). The term EMB may also apply to a national electoral commission that co-manages elections together with local authorities, such as the Swedish Election Authority, which coordinates ballot paper printing, the distribution of seats and the announcement of results at the national level.\n\nWho Organizes Elections?\n\nThree models of Electoral Management\n\nA country’s electoral management model may either result from a holistic design process or be grafted onto an existing system of state administration. In post-colonial countries, the model may be strongly inﬂuenced by colonial administrative patterns. While there are many variations, there are three broad types or models of electoral management: Independent, Governmental and Mixed Models. The form of electoral management and the individual EMBs of 217 countries and territories are detailed in Annex A, which is based on International IDEA’s Electoral Management Design Database.\n\nThe three broad electoral management models are:\n\nIndependent Model\n\nGovernmental Model\n\nMixed Model\n\nSub-sections of this chapter:\n\nRepresentation of the EMB to Cabinet and the Legislature\n\nSome Guiding Principles for All EMBs\n\nThe Independent Model of Electoral Management\n\nThe Independent Model of electoral management is used in countries where elections are organized and managed by an EMB that is institutionally independent and autonomous from the executive branch of government; its members are outside the executive. Under the Independent Model, the EMB has and manages its own budget, and is not accountable to a government ministry or department. It may be accountable to the legislature, the judiciary or the head of state. EMBs under this model may enjoy varying degrees of ﬁnancial autonomy and accountability, as well as varying levels of performance accountability. Many new and emerging democracies have chosen this model, including Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Canada, Costa Rica, Estonia, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Liberia, Mauritius, Nigeria, Poland, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay.\n\nIn some countries, two bodies are established to manage elections, both of which are independent of the executive and can be considered independent EMBs. One of these bodies is likely to have responsibility for policy decisions relating to the electoral process, and the other to be responsible for conducting and implementing the electoral process. There may be provisions to insulate the implementation EMB from interference by the policy EMB in staffing and operational matters. Examples of this ‘double-independent’ framework under the Independent Model include Jamaica and Romania.\n\nThe Governmental Model of Electoral Management\n\nIn countries with the Governmental Model of electoral management, elections are organized and managed by the executive branch through a ministry (such as the Ministry of the Interior) and/or through local authorities. Where EMBs under this model exist at the national level, they are led by a minister or civil servant and are answerable to a cabinet minister. With very few exceptions, they have no ‘members’. Their budget falls within a government ministry and/or under local authorities.\n\nCountries that use this model include Denmark, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK (for elections but not referendums) and the United States. In Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the United States, elections are implemented by local authorities. In Sweden and Switzerland, the central EMB assumes a policy coordinating role.\n\nThe Mixed Model of Electoral Management\n\nThe Mixed Model of electoral management usually involves two component EMBs and a dual structure:\n\na policy, monitoring or supervisory EMB that is independent of the executive branch (like an EMB under the Independent Model) and\n\nan implementation EMB located within a department of state and/or local government (like an EMB under the Governmental Model).\n\nUnder the Mixed Model, elections are organized by the component governmental EMB, with some level of oversight provided by the component independent EMB. The Mixed Model is used in France, Japan, Spain and many former French colonies, especially in West Africa, for example Mali and Senegal.\n\nThe powers, functions and strength of the component independent EMB in relation to the component governmental EMB vary in different examples of the Mixed Model, and the classiﬁcation of a particular country as using this model is sometimes not very clear. In the past, the component independent EMB was sometimes little more than a formalized observation operation, although this version is dying out, having been abandoned, for example, in Senegal. In other cases, the component independent EMB supervises and verifies the implementation of electoral events by the component governmental EMB, and tabulates and transmits results, as in Congo (Brazzaville). In some Francophone countries, the Constitutional Council is engaged in the tabulation and declaration of results and can be considered a component independent EMB within the Mixed Model. In Chad, this applies to referendums only, and not to elections. In Mali, where elections are organized by the Ministry of Territorial Administration, both the Independent National Electoral Commission and the Constitutional Court undertake their own tabulation of results; the country thus has three component EMBs (one governmental and two independent).\n\nInternational IDEA’s 2014 survey of electoral management in 217 countries and territories worldwide showed that 63 per cent followed the Independent Model, 23 per cent the Governmental Model and 12 per cent the Mixed Model (the remaining 2 per cent corresponds to countries that do not hold national-level elections).\n\nThe relationship between the component EMBs in a Mixed Model is not always clearly deﬁned in legislation or practice, and friction can result. In the 1999 elections in Guinea (which used the Mixed Model at that time), the majority and opposition representatives in the component independent EMB had conflicting approaches to its role in supervising and verifying the elections; thus its effectiveness was heavily disputed.\n\nWhat Can Be Expected of EMBs under the Different Electoral Management Models\n\nA country’s electoral management model is an important factor in EMB behaviour, but far from the only one; it is simplistic to think of three different behaviour patterns. EMB behaviour also depends on the electoral framework, political and social expectations, and the cultural environment within which each EMB operates. Inﬂuences include the political commitment to allow an EMB to act freely and impartially, the range of powers and functions given to an EMB, the qualiﬁcations of members or staff for appointment and their terms of ofﬁce, the way in which members and/or staff are selected and appointed, the oversight and accountability framework, and whether the EMB has a legal personality and is thus able to sue and be sued. For example, an independent EMB comprising representatives of competing political parties and an independent EMB comprising non-aligned academics or others free of political association may both follow the Independent Model, but are likely to operate differently. Similarly, an EMB under the Governmental Model with a sponsoring department that controls local electoral management ofﬁces is likely to behave differently from one that depends on numerous local authorities to implement electoral activities.\n\nHowever, there are some general characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of the three Models and their EMBs. Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 list some key issues.\n\nEMBs' Attributes under the Three Broad Models of Electoral Management\n\nMixed Model electoral management encompasses a variety of structures, internal relationships and attributes. Apart from the characteristics noted in Table 1, it is difﬁcult to codify their essential and possible attributes. The relationship between the component EMBs in a Mixed Model is signiﬁcant in determining its attributes and methods of operation. Effective legal frameworks for Mixed Model electoral management clearly specify the division of powers and functions between the component policy, monitoring or supervisory EMB(s) and the component implementing EMB(s) and their interactions. Table 4 shows some examples of attributes of component EMBs under Mixed Model electoral management.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of the Three Different Electoral Management Models\n\nPermanent and Temporary EMBs\n\nThere are many phases to the electoral process: in an election, for example, these include the design and drafting of legislation, the recruitment and training of electoral staff, electoral planning, voter registration, the registration of political parties, the nomination of parties and candidates, the electoral campaign, polling, counting, the tabulation of results, the declaration of results, the resolution of electoral disputes, reporting, auditing and archiving. After the end of one electoral process, it is desirable for work to begin on the next. The entire process is described as the electoral cycle, illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nIn determining whether a permanent or temporary EMB is appropriate, workloads throughout the electoral cycle need to be considered, and the expense of maintaining a permanent institution has to be compared with the expense and time required to establish a new body for each election. Where a temporary EMB appears appropriate, it is important to consider how institutional memory relating to elections will be maintained. Where electoral events occur regularly—such as regular partial or by-elections and continuous voter registration—or where continuing electoral development work, such as ongoing voter education and information or advocacy of electoral law reform is needed, a permanent electoral institution is justiﬁable. Countries such as Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa and Thailand maintain permanent EMBs.\n\nSome countries have temporary EMBs that function only during the electoral period. Such countries may follow any of the Independent, Governmental or Mixed Models. In some cases, the governmental EMB has to be temporary because the civil servants who run elections have other full-time duties and are assigned to the EMB only during electoral periods. However, some countries with a Governmental Model of electoral management, such as Sweden, maintain a small skeleton staff to take care of electoral issues between elections, including updating the electoral register. In some countries that use the Mixed Model, the component governmental EMB is permanent in order to preserve institutional memory, while the component independent EMB is temporary and is set up only during electoral periods.\n\nCountries such as Bulgaria, Niger and Romania, whose electoral management follows the Independent Model, have permanent central EMBs that coexist with temporary subordinate EMBs at lower levels. The Russian Federation has permanent EMBs at both the federal and constituent unit levels, and Georgia has permanent EMBs at both the central and district levels. Both have temporary EMBs at the local level during the election period. Depending on the responsibilities of the subordinate EMBs and the logistics required, these structures are usually appointed from one to six months before polling day. Permanent EMBs were created in much of Central and Eastern Europe following encouragement from the Association of Central and Eastern European Election Ofﬁcials (ACEEEO) (now the Association of European Election Officials) and the recommendation of Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) election observer missions that such structures would enhance institutional memory and operational continuity.\n\nCentralized or Decentralized EMBs\n\nThe level of an EMB’s power concentration or devolution depends very much on the system of government in the country. In unitary countries, the responsibility for elections will be determined at the national level. Federal countries may have separate EMBs at the national level and in each state/province, which often operate under different legal frameworks and may implement different electoral systems.\n\nThe nature of the EMB will usually be deﬁned in the electoral law, whether this takes the form of a single omnibus law — as in the Philippines — or a separate law specifically relating to electoral administration — as in Indonesia. The legal framework may distinguish between powers and functions that are given to a central or national EMB and those given to regional or lower-level EMBs. In unitary countries, such vertical divisions of power and functions may be between different branch levels of the one national EMB, or between national and local EMBs, as in the UK.\n\nDecentralized EMB structures can ensure continuity in the EMB’s work, especially where it has responsibility for recurring tasks such as continuous voter registration.\n\nDecentralized EMBs, even if only temporary at the lower levels, can enhance inclusiveness and transparency in electoral management. However, decentralized EMBs may face a management challenge in maintaining consistent quality in service delivery.\n\nThe sustainability and relative costs of permanent vs. temporary EMBs at the regional and/ or lower levels need to be considered, as well as the advantages.\n\nIt is common in a unitary system, as in Costa Rica, Ghana and the Philippines, to have one central EMB that is responsible for all elections, which has subordinate ofﬁces at both the provincial and local levels. Countries with laws that deﬁne separate, hierarchically accountable EMBs at national, regional, administrative district and even village level often assign devolved or different powers and responsibilities to each level. Many countries, such as Indonesia, Lithuania and Slovakia, have a central EMB that devolves responsibilities for implementing some electoral functions.\n\nCountries that use the Governmental or Mixed Model may rely on local authorities to conduct all or part of the electoral activities. For example, Sweden operates a highly decentralized electoral management structure that consists of a national EMB for policy coordination and local authorities that manage elections, and Hungary and Switzerland devolve some powers to local EMBs. Devolving electoral powers and responsibilities to local authorities without appropriate oversight may make it more difﬁcult to maintain electoral consistency, service, quality and—ultimately—the freedom and fairness of elections. The United States is a good example of this difﬁculty.\n\nEMBs in Federal Countries\n\nIn federal countries, the national- and provincial-level EMBs may each have separate, devolved structures. The nature of the relationship between such EMBs, and the powers and responsibilities of each, depend on the provisions of the law. There are a variety of approaches to this relationship.\n\nIn Australia and Canada, the national EMB is responsible for national (federal) elections, while provincial EMBs are responsible for provincial and local elections.\n\nIn Brazil, the state EMBs are generally responsible for running all elections, and the national EMB is involved in the tabulation and declaration of the results for national ofﬁces.\n\nIn India, the national EMB exercises overall superintendence, control and direction over state elections. The conduct of these elections is the direct responsibility of the state chief electoral ofﬁcer, who is a senior civil servant appointed by the national EMB.\n\nIn Nigeria, the national EMB assumes responsibility for federal and state elections and referendums, while the provincial EMBs are only responsible for local elections.\n\nIn the Russian Federation, a central EMB at the national level is responsible for all federal elections; regional EMBs are responsible for elections in the 89 regions that make up the federation; and lower-level EMBs are responsible to the central EMB for federal elections and to the regional EMB for republic, regional and local elections.\n\nIn Switzerland, a national EMB is responsible for policy coordination, while local authorities manage elections.\n\nWhile there are often rivalries between EMBs at the national and provincial levels in federal systems, there are examples of cooperation. For example, in Australia, state electoral laws speciﬁcally provide that the electoral registers for provincial and local elections are to be jointly maintained with the national EMB, rather than the provinces maintaining their own registers. Such coordination in electoral laws has signiﬁcant cost-saving beneﬁts.\n\nTransitional International EMBs and National EMBs\n\nTransitional EMBs are set up temporarily to facilitate transitional elections. They are normally set up under the auspices of the international community, for example through the United Nations (UN), and consist of or include international experts as members. Countries where transitional international EMBs have been set up include Cambodia (1993), Bosnia and Herzegovina (1996), and East Timor (2000).\n\nAn advantage of transitional international EMBs is that they beneﬁt from the presence of international election experts who have vast technical knowledge and comparative electoral experience. This type of EMB structure is useful in deep- rooted conﬂict situations that require consensus building through mediation and dialogue. The presence of international experts on the EMB may bolster domestic and international stakeholder conﬁdence in supporting the electoral process. However, local ownership of the electoral process may be significantly diminished, and the more usual approach is to provide international expertise for rather than international control of the transitional election.\n\nWhile not strictly ‘international’, the EMBs in Afghanistan (2004) and South Africa (1994) were national institutions with provision for the appointment of international members. The 1994 South African EMB consisted of ﬁve international experts, but since 1996 it has had a national EMB following the Independent Model.\n\nTransitional EMBs may also consist of nationals only, often political party representatives; an example was the 53-member EMB of Indonesia in 1999. This EMB was larger than usual in an effort to provide representation and inclusiveness. In 2001, Indonesia amended its Electoral Law to provide for an 11-member expert-based EMB, and membership was subsequently reduced to seven in 2007.\n\nRepresentation of the EMB before Cabinet and the Legislature\n\nRegardless of the model or type of EMB, it needs to deal with the executive branch of government and the legislature on issues such as electoral law and budgets. It is a good practice for a multiparty committee of the legislature, such as the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in Australia, to deal with EMB matters, and for a cabinet member to handle all EMB issues in cabinet and speak on its behalf in cabinet and the legislature. For a governmental EMB, the relevant minister would usually be from the department in which the EMB is located.\n\nUnless an independent EMB within an Independent or Mixed Model also has someone to speak on its behalf—a task that may be allocated to a speciﬁed minister—it is difﬁcult for EMB matters to attract sufﬁcient attention from either the legislature or the cabinet. For example, the arrangement in Namibia— under which the speaker of parliament handles all EMB matters, including electoral law and the EMB budget—has in the past presented some problems for the EMB because the speaker is not represented in cabinet, and cabinet rules in Namibia state that proposals for legislation must ﬁrst be presented to the cabinet by one of its members. A crisis over delays in electoral law reform in 2003 led to the appointment of a temporary ‘guardian’ minister to the EMB and the Ministry of Regional and Local Government being given the legislative task. However, the general interests of the ministry led to a perception that it might not be fully neutral in undertaking this task, and debate on an effective channel between the EMB and the legislature continued.\n\nSome Guiding Principles for All EMBs\n\nRegardless of which model is used, every EMB should be certain that it can ensure the legitimacy and credibility of the processes for which it is responsible. This can be done if electoral management is founded on fundamental guiding principles.\n\nThese guiding principles form the basis of electoral administration and are essential to ensure both the actual and perceived integrity of the electoral process.\n\nIndependence\n\nThere is some confusion over the meaning of EMB independence because the term ‘independent’ embraces two different concepts: (1) structural independence from the government (the Independent Model) and (2) the ‘fearless independence’ expected of all EMBs, no matter which model is used, in that they do not bend to governmental, political or other partisan inﬂuences on their decisions. While one issue is formal and the other is normative, they are seen as linked; in many parts of the world, the Independent Model is regarded as the one most likely to ensure an EMB’s independence of decision and action.\n\nInstitutional or ‘structural’ independence can only be found in the constitution or the law. The simplest way to promote independence of decision and action in an EMB is to create a legal framework that embeds EMB independence, as provided in the constitutions and principal EMB laws of many countries, such as Mexico, South Africa, Uruguay and Zambia. While this is always feasible with the Independent Model and may be feasible when the Mixed Model is used, it may be more difﬁcult to embed under the Governmental Model, apart from strict requirements for impartiality of action, given the integration of the EMB(s) into ministries or local governments.\n\nFor both Independent and Mixed Model electoral management, a culture of independence and the commitment of EMB members to independent decision- making are more important than formal ‘structural’ independence. Strong leadership is important for maintaining an EMB’s independence of action. For example, a senior member of the judiciary may ﬁll the position of chair of an independent EMB within either model. Such a link to the judiciary may make undue interference by the government or opposition parties in EMB operations less likely. However, it would not be appropriate where the judiciary is not regarded as impartial or free of corruption, or does not have enough members for it to be able to avoid conﬂicts of interest in election-related court cases. Countries that use judges or former judges as EMB chairs include Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica and Zambia.\n\nAlternatively, the appointment of a respected public ﬁgure who is known for political non-alignment may advance the independence of the EMB. For example, Burkina Faso tackled this issue by appointing a civil society leader as the EMB chair. In governmental EMBs, the appointment as executive head of a public servant known for his or her integrity and unwillingness to be politically directed, as in Northern Ireland, can have a similar effect.\n\nImpartiality\n\nTo establish the integrity and credibility of electoral processes, and promote the widespread acceptance of election results, an EMB must not only conduct electoral events in a fearlessly independent manner; it must also be impartial in its actions. Without impartial electoral management and independent action, the integrity of the election is likely to fail, making it difﬁcult to instill widespread belief in the credibility of electoral processes, especially among the losers.\n\nEvery EMB is expected to manage elections impartially. Irrespective of the model, its source of accountability, management control or funding, the EMB should treat all election participants equally, fairly and even-handedly, without giving advantage to any political tendency or interest group.\n\nIn theory, an independent EMB made up of non-aligned ‘expert’ appointees might be best able to achieve impartiality. Other independent EMBs, for example where nominees of the contesting political parties are appointed to the EMB, may have a more difﬁcult time establishing their credentials with the public as completely impartial bodies. Except in countries that have a tradition of a non-aligned civil service, the decisions and activities of EMBs under the Governmental or Mixed Models may be publicly regarded as likely to favour the incumbent government.\n\nYet governmental EMBs in some countries that use the Mixed Model (such as Spain) and some countries that use the Governmental Model (such as Finland and Sweden) are generally regarded as impartial. Conversely, some EMBs that follow the Independent Model may be independent in name only. Impartiality may be imposed by the legal framework or EMB structure, but it has to be put into practice through the EMB’s behaviour and attitudes toward its stakeholders. Impartiality is a state of mind more than a statement in law, although it can be encouraged by a constitutional and legal framework that enables the effective external review of EMB decisions and by an EMB code of conduct with strong sanctions that are independently administered.\n\nIt is important that the general public perceives EMBs as impartial. This can best be achieved by ensuring that all EMB actions are transparent and just, and are effectively publicized and communicated.\n\nIntegrity\n\nThe EMB is the primary guarantor of the integrity and purity of the electoral process, and EMB members are directly responsibility for ensuring this. Integrity may be easier to maintain if the EMB has both full independence of action and full control of all essential electoral processes, including full control over budgets and staffing. Where other bodies have electoral functions, EMBs need to be empowered to monitor their activities closely to ensure that they meet the highest integrity standards.\n\nElectoral law and EMB regulations beneﬁt from incorporating clear powers for the EMB to deal with electoral ofﬁcials who threaten electoral integrity by acting to beneﬁt political interests or who are corrupt. Ignoring such problems can create larger public issues of integrity and credibility than the public use of disciplinary powers. To the extent that it is possible, it is in the EMB’s interest to ensure that breaches of the electoral laws, rules and codes of conduct are followed by appropriate sanctions.\n\nTransparency\n\nTransparency in operational and ﬁnancial management lays out for public scrutiny the decisions and reasoning of the EMB. Transparency is a basic good practice for all EMB activities. It can help an EMB combat perceptions of and identify actual ﬁnancial or electoral fraud, or a lack of competence or favouritism toward particular political tendencies, which can enhance its credibility. Electoral transparency may be backed by electoral law, for example by a requirement that the EMB inform the public of its activities, as in Indonesia. Or it may be required by the EMB’s code of conduct, for example the frequent media brieﬁngs and releases and stakeholder consultations undertaken by the Liberian EMB for the 2011 elections. Even without such formal backing, an EMB may adopt a transparency policy.\n\nThe absence of transparency in electoral processes invariably leads to the suspicion that fraudulent activities are taking place. For example, where observers and the public are unable to access progressive vote count and aggregation data, and where there are signiﬁcant delays in announcing and validating election results (as in Belarus and Ukraine in 2004 and Ethiopia in 2005) the credibility of the election suffers.\n\nEfﬁciency\n\nGovernments and the public expect that funds for elections will be used wisely and services delivered efﬁciently. In the face of expanding and ever more expensive technological solutions, and demands for increased effort in high-cost areas such as voter education and information, EMBs have to be careful that their programmes sustainably serve electoral efﬁciency, as well as integrity and modernity.\n\nA successful EMB is one that has displayed integrity, competence and efﬁciency. These qualities help generate public and political party conﬁdence in electoral processes. The legal framework can assist by deﬁning efﬁcient standards for electoral and ﬁnancial management. However, sometimes members of an EMB may be unfamiliar with electoral practices and procedures; at other times they may not be used to dealing with contracting for equipment and materials in a cut- throat corporate environment. The resulting inefﬁciency in election organization may easily be perceived as corrupt and fraudulent behaviour, which may lead to more serious challenges to the EMB’s credibility. Where trust is lacking in the political process generally, an EMB is unlikely to be given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nProfessionalism\n\nProfessionalism in electoral managements requires accurate, service-oriented implementation of electoral procedures by suitably skilled staff. EMBs need to ensure that all election ofﬁcials, whether core staff or temporary workers, are well trained and have the necessary skills to apply high professional standards in their technical work. Professional training prompts public trust that the entire process is ‘in good hands’. However, while a continuous training and skill development programme is an essential part of creating and maintaining a professional EMB, professionalism depends just as much on the attitude of every member and secretariat staff person. A personal commitment from each individual in an EMB to equity, accuracy, diligence and service in all they do, and to self-improvement, is necessary to maintain professionalism in electoral management.\n\nVisible professionalism in an EMB also gives political parties, civil society, voters, donors, the media and other stakeholders the conﬁdence that electoral managers are capable of undertaking their tasks effectively. A lack of visible professionalism in electoral management, on the other hand, will create public suspicions of inaccurate and perhaps fraudulent activity, and a lack of trust. It will make it easier for complaints from election losers to ﬁnd public support, whether the complaint is valid or not.\n\nService-mindedness\n\nEMBs not only have a responsibility to provide a service to their stakeholders— it is the major reason for their existence. Developing and publicizing service delivery standards for all their activities provides both internal motivators for EMB members and staff to provide high-quality service, and external yardsticks with which stakeholders can assess the EMB’s performance. Some basic service standards are often included in the electoral legal framework, as in Canada: these include time-based standards such as deadlines for announcing election results, compiling the electoral registers, distributing voters’ identiﬁcation (ID) cards or distributing information on voting location.\n\nFurther useful service delivery standards can be adopted by the EMB itself as part of its procedures for each electoral process. These may be time-based service standards such as the average, maximum and minimum times voters spend queuing to receive ballot papers, the time within which an enquiry from a member of the public will be answered, or the average time taken to process voter registration data for an elector. They may also be quality-based standards such as the percentage of electors being refused a vote due to errors on the electoral register, the proportion of materials missing or not delivered on time to polling stations, the proportion of polling stations that did not open on time on election day, or the accuracy and timely availability of preliminary voting results.\n\nAs well as such hard facts, stakeholder perceptions of EMB service performance are critical in inﬂuencing public judgments of the EMB’s integrity and effectiveness. Regular public or stakeholder surveys (for example, after elections) can provide useful information to help an EMB assess and improve its service delivery. These may be conducted by the EMB itself or be external, for example as part of the EMB’s accountability responsibilities—such as a performance review by the legislature.\n\nChapter Summary\n\nThe Legal Framework: The Context for an EMB’s Role and Powers\n\nHow Legal Instruments Define Electoral Processes\n\nThe structure, powers, functions and responsibilities of EMBs are deﬁned in those parts of a country’s legal framework that deal with electoral processes. Especially in newer democracies, the current trend is to develop a comprehensive legal framework that guarantees the independence and integrity of the electoral process, promotes consistency and equality in electoral management, and supports full and informed participation in electoral events by political parties, civil society organizations (CSOs) and electors. The full legal framework for elections can be based on a variety of sources, including the following:\n\nInternational documents, for example article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR): \"Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions: a) To take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives; b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors; c) To have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country\".\n\nRegional documents, for example the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance: ‘State Parties re-affirm their commitment to regularly holding transparent, free and fair elections in accordance with the Union’s Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa’ (article 17).\n\nThe constitution.\n\nNational laws, which may take the form of one comprehensive electoral code, as in Albania, Argentina, Armenia and the Philippines. Alternatively, there may be a set of laws covering different aspects of the electoral process. Indonesia, for example, has a Law on General Elections, a Law on Election Organisation, a Law on Presidential Elections, a Law on Political Parties, a Law Establishing the Constitutional Court (one of whose functions is the resolution of certain electoral disputes) and a Law on Local Governance, which includes provisions for elections for the heads of the regional executive branches of government. Some countries (e.g. Latvia, South Africa, Uzbekistan and Zambia) deﬁne the structure, composition and powers of their EMB in a separate law, as does Thailand, where this law has the higher status of an organic law. Other laws, such a voter registration law, ID law or a law on the organization of the national territory, can also be part of the legal framework.\n\nProvincial or state laws, which in federal countries may govern the processes for provincial or state and local electoral events (as in Australia) or for national electoral events (as in the United States).\n\nOrdinances and regulations made by national or lower-level authorities.\n\nRegulations, proclamations and directives issued by an EMB, if it has the power to do so.\n\nCustomary laws and conventions that may be integrated into electoral law, or EMB regulations or policies dealing with issues such as separate voter registration and voting arrangements for women and men.\n\nAdministrative policies made by an EMB or other bodies, and\n\nCodes of conduct (voluntary or otherwise) that may have a direct or indirect impact on the electoral process, for example, for EMBs, election participants, observers and election reporting by the media.\n\nThe organization and administration of electoral processes is complex, and always involves a substantial mass of detail. It is therefore usually speciﬁed in written laws and regulations, rather than determined by unwritten tradition or administrative policy-making. Written laws and regulations provide the beneﬁts of certainty, visibility and transparency; are easier to subject to judicial review; and are accessible to interested parties, including electors. The legal certainty provided by a detailed exposition of electoral processes embedded in law, backed by constitutional authority, will tend to promote conﬁdence in the consistency, fairness and even-handedness of electoral administration, and provide clear opportunities for legal redress. The level of detail speciﬁed at different levels of the legal framework will vary from country to country, depending on factors such as systems of law and the level of trust in EMBs’ willingness and ability to make fair and consistent decisions and policies.\n\nInternational and Regional Treaties and Agreements\n\nMany UN member countries incorporate into their domestic law (using a variety of constitutional means) key UN decisions and treaties, such as the 1966 ICCPR and the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). In such cases, domestic electoral laws, and EMB policies and actions, need to consider the treaties’ provisions as treaty obligations that their country has voluntarily adhered to, especially in relation to issues such as universal and non-discriminatory suffrage, secret and free voting, the rights of women to be elected and hold public ofﬁce, and the rights of minority language groups. Bilateral agreements between countries and regional treaties on supranational bodies (e.g. the European Union) may also contain electoral requirements. While complementary laws are usually required to give effect to such treaties, EMB actions that contradict rights contained in ratiﬁed treaties may still be legally challengeable.\n\nMember states of regional bodies, such as the OSCE, the Organization of American States (OAS) and the African Union (AU), are increasingly committing themselves through either legislative or executive ratiﬁcation to implement treaties and decisions adopted by the regional bodies. In 1990, the OSCE adopted the Copenhagen Commitments, through which its participating states \"solemnly declare that among those elements of justice which are essential to the full expression of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all human beings are…free elections that will be held at reasonable intervals by secret ballot or by equivalent free voting procedure, under conditions which ensure in practice the free expression of the opinion of the electors in the choice of their representatives\". The AU Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance provides that \"State Parties shall:\n\nEstablish and strengthen independent and impartial national electoral bodies responsible for the management of elections.\n\nEstablish and strengthen national mechanisms that redress election- related disputes in a timely manner.\n\nEnsure fair and equitable access by contesting parties and candidates to state controlled media during elections.\n\nEnsure that there is a binding code of conduct governing legally recognized political stakeholders, government and other political actors prior to, during and after elections. The code shall include a commitment by political stakeholders to accept the results of the election or challenge them through exclusively legal channels\".\n\nThe AU has backed up the charter in practice by establishing an electoral support unit within its secretariat.\n\nSimilar frameworks have been developed by sub-regional bodies, such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). One example of such a regional and enforceable treaty that affects the legal frameworks for EMBs is the ECOWAS Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance of 2001, under which member countries commit themselves to independent or impartial electoral administration and timely electoral dispute resolution.\n\nIn addition to ratiﬁed, binding treaties and decisions, there are non-binding decisions by international and regional bodies. In October 2005, the Global Declaration of Principles and Code of Conduct for International Electoral Observation was adopted by the United Nations and by a wide range of global and regional organizations; many more organizations have adopted it subsequently. In the SADC region, the Electoral Institute of Southern Africa (EISA) and the Electoral Commissions’ Forum of SADC countries (ECF) have jointly developed and adopted the Principles for Election Management, Monitoring and Observation (PEMMO), while the SADC Parliamentary Forum has established its own electoral norms and practices. These sets of principles and guidelines serve as benchmarks against which observer missions in the region assess whether an election is free, fair and credible.\n\nThe Constitution\n\nA growing number of countries are incorporating fundamental electoral provisions in their constitutions, often including the type, composition and responsibilities of the EMB. Countries such as Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Ghana, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Uruguay have set up their respective EMBs as constitutional bodies, which makes it more difﬁcult to alter their status and other constitutionally deﬁned elements. Constitutional provisions are almost always more entrenched than mere laws; constitutional amendments require, for example, a qualiﬁed majority in the legislature or a referendum. The barrier that constitutional entrenchment presents to ruling parties that wish to change electoral provisions to their advantage gives opposition parties a sense of greater protection than they would have if those provisions were contained in government regulations or statute law, which can be altered by a majority in the legislature.\n\nThe range and nature of electoral provisions that are considered appropriate to be set out in a country’s constitution vary widely according to local considerations.\n\nAustria’s constitution defines EMB membership, franchise, the Constitutional Court’s role in electoral disputes and the electoral system.\n\nThe constitution of Bangladesh deﬁnes the powers, independence and functions of the EMB, the franchise, candidate qualiﬁcations, and the maximum period between elections.\n\nCameroon’s constitution specifies political party rights, candidate qualiﬁcations, the intervals at which elections must be held, and the powers of the Supreme Court and Constitutional Council related to electoral disputes.\n\nIn Costa Rica, the constitution establishes the independence, membership and functions of the EMB, and deals with the franchise, political party rights (including government funding), electoral systems and qualiﬁcations for candidacy.\n\nFor elections in the Czech Republic, the constitution deﬁnes the franchise, the electoral system and the maximum period between elections.\n\nGhana’s constitution deals with the franchise, the establishment of the EMB, the right to form or join a political party, and the delimitation of electoral districts.\n\nIn India, the constitution has provisions establishing an EMB and addresses the franchise and electoral register, barring court interference in electoral matters and reserving seats for legally deﬁned \"castes\" and \"tribes\" in the House of the People.\n\nMadagascar’s constitution sets out candidacy rights, the electoral systems for the senate and presidency, and the Constitutional Court’s role in elections and election disputes.\n\nThe Namibian constitution enunciates the qualiﬁcations and procedures for presidential elections.\n\nPeru’s constitution deals with the autonomy, membership and functions of the National Elections Tribunal, which supervises electoral processes and is responsible for party registration, announcement of results and electoral dispute resolution. The constitution also empowers the National Ofﬁce for Electoral Processes to organize materials and logistics, funding and vote count information for all electoral events; sets out the qualiﬁcations for its chief executive; and empowers the National Registry of Identiﬁcation and Civil Status to create the electoral register from its civil registry database.\n\nThe constitution of Romania sets out the citizens’ right to elect and be elected, and requires an organic law to regulate the establishment and functioning of the Permanent Electoral Authority.\n\nSimilarly targeted electoral provisions in constitutions may also be drafted in very different ways. Consider the following two examples of constitutionally deﬁned EMB \"independence\":\n\n\"Except as provided for in this Constitution or any other law not inconsistent with this Constitution, in the performance of its functions, the Electoral Commission shall not be subject to the direction or control of any authority or person\" (article 46 of the constitution of Ghana).\n\n\"General elections shall be organized by a general election commission of a national, permanent, and independent character\" (article 22E(5) of the Indonesian constitution).\n\nWhile enshrining major electoral provisions in the constitution generates conﬁdence in the electoral system, there may be disadvantages if these provisions are too detailed. The legal framework may then be difﬁcult to change in practice because it is difﬁcult to satisfy the conditions for amending the constitution, or due to the length of time it takes to amend the constitution.\n\nThe extent to which electoral provisions are incorporated into the constitution is signiﬁcantly affected by the level of public trust in the country’s election administration. In many established democracies with a high level of public trust in lawmaking and public administration in general, and the organization of elections in particular, constitutions do not make provision for the design of the EMB. Yet it is common—and not only among ﬂedgling democracies—to have independent and robust EMBs that are supported by sophisticated and detailed legal frameworks that incorporate key electoral provisions in the constitution. The authority and clarity of the constitution foster stakeholder conﬁdence in the electoral process.\n\nElectoral Laws: Acts and Ordinances\n\nAn EMB may be established by statute, through an act of the legislature. For example, Australia, Burkina Faso and Canada established their respective EMBs entirely by statute law. It is unusual for governmental EMBs to be defined specifically in law; tasks are more frequently allocated to government agencies in an electoral law. However, in the UK (see the case study), which has no written constitution, the Electoral Commission—the EMB for referendums—is defined in statute law.\n\nIt is generally good practice when drafting such electoral statutes:\n\nto transparently lay down the legislative framework for electoral processes and clearly allocate the responsibility for ﬁlling in the gaps and/or details through secondary legislation, regulations or EMB administrative procedures;\n\nto deﬁne the status of the national EMB(s) and any subsidiary EMBs, including their accountability, powers, responsibilities and functions; and\n\nfor legislation to provide a clear and sufﬁciently detailed framework to ensure effectiveness and integrity in all matters relating to electoral administration, such as EMB member and staff appointments and tenure; operational management issues related to voter registration, political party and candidate registration, political campaigns, and voter education and information; EMB transparency; voting, vote counting and the announcement of results; ﬁnancial and asset management issues; and electoral offences and resolving electoral disputes.\n\nOther issues that may be covered in electoral legislation include boundary delimitation principles and processes, and codes of conduct for EMB members and staff, political parties, publicly-owned media and election observers.\n\nParts of the legal framework may also be enacted as secondary legislation, for example, by an EMB with the power to make regulations by some form of execu- tive decree; by a state or provincial legislature in the form of secondary legislation in a federal country; or by municipal authorities in the form of ordinances.\n\nProvisions for the conduct of provincial and local elections are often contained in separate legislation. In federal countries, national and provincial electoral legal frameworks may need to be separately deﬁned, depending on the constitutional split of powers between the national and provincial levels. Inconsistencies or overlapping provisions between national and provincial electoral legislation, for example for voter registration or voting procedures, may confuse electors. Regular consultations between federal and provincial lawmakers and electoral administrators can help minimize confusion and duplication.\n\nIn addition, where elections to a supranational body are contemplated, national legislation is likely to be necessary to deﬁne the electoral management structure within the overall supranational agreement. Looking at the example of the European Parliament, the provisions contained in the European-level legal instruments are for the most part very general in nature, and the deﬁnition of the electoral management structure for European Parliament elections is left to each member state.\n\nAs with the balance between electoral provisions in the constitution and in legislation, the balance between electoral provisions in legislation and subsidiary regulations or procedures needs to be carefully judged. Electoral legislation needs to be detailed enough to ensure integrity and effectiveness, but not so detailed that legislative amendment would be required to permit EMBs to deal with minor changes in their operations. Too much detail in the legislation can result in, for example, an EMB being unable to change its stafﬁng structure or the design of an administrative form, or to introduce ofﬁce automation systems without a change to the law. Particularly in environments where election processes take place after legislatures’ terms of ofﬁce have ended, electoral legislation needs to allow EMBs the ﬂexibility to respond to changing electoral circumstances.\n\nA modern electoral legislative scheme may entail one or several different laws. Traditional legal drafting for electoral legislation has often been precise, but in a structure and language that are not very accessible. The legislation may become particularly difﬁcult to understand if it is subject to successive amendments over time, without a fully revised and consolidated law being produced.\n\nA single omnibus law covering all electoral activity can be cumbersome, but may facilitate reference and review. Separate laws on individual issues—as in Indonesia, for example, such as the EMB, political parties, electoral registers, elections to the legislature, presidential elections and local government elections—provide clear and easy reference to speciﬁc electoral activities, but it may be too time consuming or difﬁcult to ensure that there are no conﬂicts of content between them. Another possible solution (as in Hungary) is that the substantive norms (such as suffrage rights, eligibility, number of election rounds and the electoral system) are embodied in separate laws (on elections to the legislature, local elections and referendums), while the electoral process is regulated in a common law that consists of a general part (binding on all types of elections) and special norms for each type of election.\n\nInternational IDEA’s publication International Obligations for Elections: Guidelines for Legal Frameworks discusses a number of issues to consider when designing or reviewing a legal framework for electoral management. Key considerations are summarized in Box 1.\n\nEMB Rules, Regulations and Proclamations\n\nIn some countries, an EMB has legal powers to regulate the electoral framework either by enacting new laws or by making rules and regulations that complement existing primary legislation. Such an arrangement is efficient and allows for the speedy amendment of the legal framework. For example, Uruguay’s EMB can make decisions and dictate actions that cannot be reviewed by any other branch of government. Thus it has legislative powers (making laws that govern elections), judicial powers (reviewing and interpreting laws with binding effect) and implementation powers for the laws and norms it has enacted.\n\nA more usual practice is for an EMB, particularly an independent EMB, to be empowered to make reviewable regulations by ﬁlling in the detail of concepts contained in the law, or ﬁlling existing gaps in the law. For governmental EMBs, this power may be held by the ministry within which the EMB is located. Such regulations in most countries are subject to review, generally by a court or constitutional court, to test whether they are within the powers of the EMB (or ministry) to make, and whether they are otherwise consistent with the law.\n\nIn countries such as the Gambia, Thailand and Yemen, the EMBs have the power to make regulations to facilitate their mandate, including the conduct of elections. In Namibia, the EMB has the power to issue proclamations that by law must be gazetted, and that cover issues such as political parties’ code of conduct, some procedural issues on voter registration and parties’ disclosure of foreign donations. The Indonesian EMB has speciﬁc regulatory powers in some critical areas, including voter registration, candidate registration, the conduct of election campaigns and voting processes.\n\nEMB powers to make regulations should always be exercised in such a way as to ensure consistency with both the constitution and the electoral law.\n\nMany EMBs have the power to formulate administrative policies and directions on operational issues such as their relationships with their own staff (on matters such as gender equality, afﬁrmative action, performance management and staff development) and with external stakeholders. External stakeholders include government ministries, in particular finance ministries, the legislature, political parties, CSOs and the media.\n\nUnlike regulations, which by law must be issued publicly, an EMB may have no legal obligation to publish its administrative directives and policies, although it is always good practice for it to do so. Where EMB policies have to be formally approved by the EMB, they can be made publicly available through the minutes of EMB meetings. It is important that an EMB consult its stakeholders when formulating new policies or reviewing old ones in order to foster stakeholder awareness and buy-in.\n\nChapter Summary\n\nElectoral processes are complex, standardized activities that require clear, simple and relatively comprehensive legal deﬁnition in order to promote consistency, equity and a common understanding of electoral frameworks by all electoral stakeholders.\n\nThe electoral legal framework within which an EMB operates may be deﬁned in many different types of instruments—including international and regional treaties, the constitution, national and sub-national statute law, and EMB and other regulations.\n\nInternational and regional treaties and agreements provide a framework of norms against which a country’s electoral legal arrangements can be deﬁned and assessed.\n\nThere is a trend toward deﬁning key electoral issues in the constitution, as this may provide a workable means of protecting electoral norms from manipulation by the ruling party. Electoral arrangements may be further deﬁned in statute law, secondary legislation and regulations.\n\nElectoral statute law may either be a single law or multiple laws that need to be kept in harmony. EMBs or the executive branch of government may be able to issue regulations to ﬁll in gaps in the law; usually these would be subject to some form of judicial or other review. EMBs may also be able to set their own administrative policies. For conﬁdence in election processes, it is important that all parts of the electoral framework— treaties, constitution, statute laws, and EMB and other regulations, as well as administrative policies—are freely and publicly available, and that changes are discussed and shared with key stakeholders.\n\nA balance needs to be struck between providing for certainty and consistency in the legal framework, on the one hand, and allowing an EMB the ﬂexibility to respond effectively to changing electoral circumstances on the other. The amount of electoral detail in higher-level instruments— constitutions and statute laws—will often depend on the level of trust in political participants and the EMB’s performance.\n\nInternational IDEA’s publication International Obligations for Elections: Guidelines for Legal Frameworks provides guidelines for assessing electoral legal frameworks.\n\nEMBs’ powers to make regulations should always be exercised in line with both the constitution and the electoral law.\n\nThe Composition, Roles and Functioning of an EMB\n\nAn EMB’s activities generally require both the determination of policy and the implementation of major administrative and logistics operations. Where the Governmental Model of electoral management is used, both of these functions are undertaken by civil servants, who are employed by one or more bodies of the executive. While members of the executive branch of government, such as ministers, may also take an active role in EMB policy-making under the Governmental Model, it is more common for the head of its secretariat, who may be termed director of elections or have a similar title, to be responsible for policy. It is not usual for governmental EMBs to have members; rather, they are composed entirely of secretariat (public service) staff. An exception is the Czech Republic, where EMB members are appointed from the executive branch.\n\nIn EMBs under the Independent Model, the policy function is undertaken by individual(s) (i.e. the EMB’s ‘members’) from outside the executive branch who are specially appointed for this task. Their role is similar to that of the board of a corporation—to guide the direction of the EMB—although in many cases EMB members have a full-time and more ‘hands on’ role than would be usual for a corporate board. Similarly, under the Mixed Model, the component independent EMB is guided by a ‘board’ of members.\n\nThe use of the terms ‘independent model’ or ‘independent members’ should not be confused with the independence of the EMB, which depends on its actions (see Chapter 1). People appointed by political parties can act independently, and people appointed for their expertise can act partially.\n\nEMB Membership\n\nEMB members need a very high level of management skills and commitment to maintaining integrity under pressure. Ideally, an EMB should include members with a wide range of the skills needed to ensure that it can function effectively, such as legal, communications, education, logistics, technology and corporate management skills. Public conﬁdence in EMBs is enhanced where the electoral legislation contains (1) qualiﬁcations for appointment to EMBs that are clearly deﬁned and appropriate for the complex task of managing electoral processes impartially and (2) selection and appointment mechanisms that are transparent and based on the candidates’ merits. The mode of selection and appointment, and the tenure, of EMB members vary by country. Details of the composition, appointment and tenure of EMB members are available in Annex A.\n\nThere are various titles for EMB members; each has its own nuances that are related to the basis, role and powers of the policymaking members of the EMB. In Canada, the chief electoral ofﬁcer is both the chief and sole policymaker and the head of the administration (secretariat), and is the sole EMB member. The frequently used term ‘commissioner’ is not applied consistently. In many countries that use the Independent or Mixed Model, EMB members are referred to as commissioners. In Australia, the electoral commissioner is both the head of the secretariat and a full voting member of the EMB (although not the head of the EMB), while the deputy and assistant commissioners are the staff of the secretariat. In India, the EMB has three members, the chief election commissioner and two election commissioners, and the most senior members of the secretariat are known as deputy election commissioners. In Francophone countries and Latin America, an EMB head may be termed ‘president’, and in Latin America the term ‘councillor’ is sometimes used to describe EMB members.\n\nThe chairs of EMBs in Bangladesh, Nigeria and Pakistan, who by law are known as chief electoral commissioners, serve as the EMBs’ chief executive. The role of such a chair is similar to that of an executive chair or executive director in the corporate world. Unlike chairs in some other EMBs, this type of chief electoral commissioner has executive powers and is more ‘hands on’ in directing the electoral process. Although he or she may be assisted by other commissioners and the secretariat, the chief electoral commissioner in these countries will have the ﬁnal say in matters of ﬁnance and administration, and also on key aspects of the electoral process.\n\nStatus of EMB Members\n\nFor an EMB to operate effectively, its members need to have a status that entitles them to respect from and a relationship of equality with the government, the legislature and society. In India, the three EMB members—the chief election commissioner and the two election commissioners—have the status of judges of the Supreme Court. The head of an EMB especially needs a status that affords her or him access to the highest levels of government and ensures adherence to the EMB’s decisions. The chair of the EMB in Pakistan (the chief electoral commissioner) has the same conditions of service as the chief justice, as do his counterparts in numerous other countries.\n\nWhile it is important that EMB members have a high status, it is also important that members do not behave as though they are bigger than the EMB institution they serve, or come to be regarded by society as ‘the EMB’. Personality-based institutions can be highly polarizing. A good-practice model for EMB members to follow is to personalize the institution they serve, rather than institutionalize the person or persons leading the EMB. For example, decisions may be described as the ‘decision of the commission’ rather than ‘the decision of the commissioners’.\n\nThe EMB Chair: A Special Role?\n\nIn some countries, the legal framework provides for a two-stream procedure for the appointment of EMB members: one for the chair and another for all other members. In Ghana, Guyana, Lithuania, Pakistan, Thailand and Uruguay, the EMB chair (sometimes called the EMB president) serves as a ‘ﬁrst among equals’ and is appointed by the head of state/government at a level higher than the other members. The chair of the Ghanaian EMB is appointed at the level of a senior judge, while other members are at the level of judges of a lower court. In the Solomon Islands, the speaker of parliament becomes the chair of the EMB.\n\nWhere the EMB chair is appointed on different terms than the other members and at a higher level, he or she tends to play a more prominent role, over and above that of presiding over the EMB’s meetings. He or she may have additional powers related to matters such as chairing various EMB internal subcommittees, actively supporting the secretariat in policy implementation and monitoring, and liaising with stakeholders. In Lithuania, for example, the EMB chair has speciﬁed powers to hire and ﬁre staff; to keep and direct the use of the EMB seal; and to represent the EMB in state institutions, in court and in international organizations. In Liberia, the chair of the National Elections Commission is also by law the ofﬁcial spokesperson for the commission, although secretariat staff carry out the day-to-day work of maintaining contact with the media.\n\nIn countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Costa Rica, Guam, Moldova, Russia, South Korea, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, all EMB members are appointed on the same terms, and the chair (and in some cases the vice chair and secretary) is elected by his/her peers after the ﬁrst meeting. In Mozambique, the chair is elected from among the civil society representatives. In Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Guam, the elected chair serves for only part of the commission’s term. When the chair is elected from within the EMB, the chair’s main responsibility is to preside over the meetings of the commission and/or its subcommittees if necessary.\n\nThere are no speciﬁc advantages or disadvantages associated with appointing the EMB chair as a ﬁrst among equals or having members of the EMB select their chair from among themselves. The appropriate practice depends on the context in which the EMB structure was originally designed and continues to function.\n\nThe case for a ‘ﬁrst among equals’ EMB chair is stronger where an EMB is nascent and requires some nurturing, and the position is full time. This may also apply where the chair is a full-time position and other members are part time. Where the EMB is a part-time body, it may be more appropriate for the chair to be elected by his or her peers and for him or her to have the same conditions of service as all other EMB members.\n\nEMB Members: Respected Experts or Watchdogs for Each Other?\n\nIn countries where the Independent or Mixed Model is used, electoral legislation speciﬁes the framework for EMB membership. There are myriad different legal provisions that govern this critical issue. A basic difference is between a multiparty-based EMB and an expert-based EMB. Broadly, a multiparty-based model assumes that decisions are often political and allows each political party to choose some of the members, on the assumption that each will ensure that decisions do not unduly favour other parties. By contrast, an expert-based model assumes that decisions are primarily legal or technical and seeks people with the expertise to deal with these issues competently.\n\nMultiparty-based EMBs\n\nMany countries, especially those that have experienced difﬁcult transitions from authoritarian rule to multiparty democracy, have chosen multiparty-based EMBs. In such societies, public servants are likely to have been largely discredited as electoral policymakers because of a history of being agents of the authoritarian former ruling party or military regime. The ﬁght against authoritarianism may also have polarized society to the extent that it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd public ﬁgures who are widely accepted as impartial to serve on an EMB for a transitional election. Many Central and Eastern European countries adopted multiparty-based EMBs during their transitions.\n\nMultiparty EMBs comprise a mixture of political party nominees. The legal framework may entitle all recognized or registered political parties contesting an election to be represented equally on the EMB (as in Guam), or a threshold may restrict representation — for example, to parties represented in the legislature or with more than a speciﬁed proportion of members in the legislature. Of the 20 members nominated by political parties in Guinea, half are nominated by the political party of the president and the others by the opposition parties. In Albania, the party-affiliated members represent the distribution of seats in the legislature. In Venezuela in the mid-1990s, the larger parties each had their own representative, while smaller parties of the left and right were represented collectively.\n\nPolitical party-based appointment often implies that EMB members are serving on the EMB as political party representatives or agents and, as well as impartially managing electoral processes, serve to protect their nominating parties’ interests. However, while each individual member is seen from the outside as partisan, each also ensures that the others do not take partisan advantage — so the EMB can nonetheless be credibly perceived as an impartial body. Political party-based members often hold ofﬁce for a ﬁxed term and cannot be dismissed except for cause, such as a breach of their duties, or upon their withdrawal by their nominating authority. Frequent replacement by parties of their representatives, however, has the potential to disrupt the work of the EMB.\n\nIn Guinea and Mozambique, political party nominees to an EMB are eminent persons who are required to maintain high standards of impartiality and professionalism, and thus they do not serve as political party representatives.\n\nMany electoral analysts believe that having political party representatives on an EMB engenders consensus among actors in the electoral contest and enhances transparency, both of which improve conﬁdence in the electoral process. Voters may feel more encouraged to participate in elections if the leaders of political parties play an active role in the electoral process, speciﬁcally through representation on the EMB.\n\nMultiparty EMBs may help promote trust and conﬁdence in electoral processes in the initial stages of democratic transitions. Depoliticization of EMBs may be more appropriate as conﬁdence in the electoral process grows.\n\nYet a political party-based EMB can imperil or cripple decision-making, especially where political parties’ critical interests are at stake. The presence of politicians on the EMB may undermine conﬁdentiality in matters such as the security of ballot materials. Multiparty-based EMBs also tend to generate dissatisfaction, especially among minority parties that might be excluded from the EMB either because they are not represented in the legislature or because they did not participate in the negotiation that led to the initial appointments of EMB members.\n\nExpert-based EMBs\n\nExpert-based or non-party-based EMBs are those that the legal framework requires to be made up of individuals appointed on the basis of their professional standing. In some cases, members of an expert-based EMB may be nominated by political parties or civil society, but this does not imply that they will be directed by their nominating parties or act in a partisan manner. In Mexico, although the EMB is a permanent body with 11 expert voting members, each political group in the legislature and each national political party also provides one non-voting representative.\n\nQualiﬁcations to be a member of an expert-based EMB may include impartiality, a minimum age, professional qualiﬁcations and electoral knowledge. Expert- based EMB members are often eminent public ﬁgures renowned for political neutrality who have expertise in ﬁelds such as law, public administration, political science or the media. Expert-based EMBs are found in countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Poland, Thailand and Ukraine. The law in many of these countries stipulates that EMB members must not have been active in party politics in the recent past, and must not be a political party member while serving as a member of the EMB. Nevertheless, in highly politicized situations, nominees may be seen as friendly to a particular party or faction, and there may be the perception that the parties have divided the positions between them rather than choose impartial members who are acceptable to all.\n\nOne common form of the expert-based model is judicial EMBs. In Brazil, for example, elections are the responsibility of national and state electoral tribunals, which are considered a specialized segment of the judicial branch, comprising judges of various categories along with a small number of expert lawyers; below the tribunals, regular judges are detailed for a short time to oversee electoral preparations and operations in each electoral district. The EMBs of Costa Rica and Guatemala are also judicial; all of their members are judges.\n\nEMBs with Both Expert and Multiparty Membership\n\nSome electoral legal frameworks specify that EMBs have a mixed membership of party representatives and politically non-aligned members, such as judges, academics, civil society representatives and career public servants. For example, in Côte d’Ivoire, EMB members are appointed by political parties, law and judicial societies, and government ministries. This may combine advantages from both models, producing even-handed bodies that have both political party buy-in and transparency in their operations.\n\nThis combined model can be implemented in various ways. In Mexico, the members nominated by political parties can take part in debates but cannot vote on decisions. In Mozambique, the five members designated by the parties in the legislature then select the eight expert members from nominees provided by CSOs. In Croatia, a standing national EMB comprising Supreme Court judges and other distinguished lawyers is expanded for the electoral period by representatives of the majority and opposition blocs of political parties in the national legislature. Each electoral district has similarly constituted EMBs.\n\nLike multiparty EMBs, combined EMBs can ﬁnd decision-making difﬁcult. For example in the 1999 Indonesian elections, the combined EMB was unable to validate the election results because members representing some very minor political parties refused to sign the validation unless their parties were allocated seats to which they were not entitled by their votes. Table 7 on page 113 shows some key advantages and disadvantages of multiparty, expert and combined EMBs.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Multiparty, Expert and Combined EMBs\n\nFull-time or Part-time EMB Members?\n\nWhether it is more appropriate for EMB membership to be a full-time or part- time position depends on the electoral and administrative circumstances. In a permanent EMB, workloads may be high throughout the electoral cycle and require that EMB members are full time and thus readily available for speedy consultation and decisions. Full-time EMB members may be a good option where there are recurring activities, such as regular partial or by-elections, ongoing voter education and information, continuous voter registration or continuing electoral law reforms. In a temporary EMB, the electoral period workload may be such that full-time members are preferable. Full-time EMB membership may also be appropriate where there are doubts about the impartiality and skill levels of the EMB’s secretariat.\n\nThe beneﬁt of having full-time EMB members must always be weighed against the cost of their services, when it may be years before the next election. There is also the risk of a potential conﬂict between senior members of the secretariat and full-time EMB members, especially when the former begin to interpret the full-time presence of the EMB members as interfering in the implementation of policy.\n\nSome electoral legal frameworks, such as Indonesia’s, require that EMB appointments are full time. Countries such as Gambia appoint full-time EMB members even though it is not a legal requirement.\n\nIn countries where election dates are ﬁxed and EMBs have limited responsibility between elections, it may be advisable to have part-time EMB members. In Ghana and South Sudan, EMB members are part time, while the chair and deputy are full time. It is also possible for members to serve part time in non- electoral periods and full time during electoral periods.\n\nHow Many EMB Members?\n\nThe electoral legal framework will generally specify the number of EMB members. However, when the membership of a multiparty EMB is determined by criteria such as party representation in the legislature, it is not possible to specify an exact number of members, as this number may vary over time.\n\nThe number of members of EMBs varies considerably worldwide, and need not be related to the size of the country. For example, in the small country of Lesotho, the EMB has three members, while Nigeria, a much bigger country, has a 13-member EMB. However, Canada, despite its sizeable land mass, and India, which has about 700 million voters, have one- and three-member EMBs, respectively. Having a larger number of EMB members may provide broader representation, whereas a smaller number can facilitate discussion and decision- making. Having an uneven number of members ensures that simple majority vote decisions can be made without having to resort to measures such as giving the EMB chair a casting vote. EMBs that include political party nominees tend to have more members than expert-based EMBs, in order to accommodate a credible range of political interests.\n\nElectoral law in countries such as Guatemala and Turkey allows for the appointment of alternate or deputy members to EMBs. Under certain circumstances, a deputy member can automatically take the place and exercise the powers of a member.\n\nTerm of Office of Members of Permanent EMBs\n\nIn many permanent EMBs, members have a speciﬁed term of ofﬁce. As of the end of 2013, terms of ofﬁce were three years in Malta and Rwanda; four years in the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Jamaica, Latvia and Palau; ﬁve years in Kiribati, Lesotho, and Trinidad and Tobago; six years in Nepal; seven years in the Philippines, South Africa, Uganda and Ukraine; eight years in Romania and ten years in Botswana (see Annex A). Some EMBs’ terms of ofﬁce are deﬁned in relation to the legislature’s term of ofﬁce. In Botswana, the EMB has a permanent secretariat, but EMB members are operative only during elections and hold ofﬁce for two successive terms of the legislature (equivalent to ten years). In Bhutan, India and Nepal, if a member turns 65 before the end of their appointed term, they must retire.\n\nThe EMBs in Cambodia, Canada, Ghana and Malaysia have an unspeciﬁed term of ofﬁce; once appointed, members remain in ofﬁce until they reach retirement age, unless they resign or are removed. In Canada and Malaysia the chair remains in ofﬁce until he or she reaches the age of 65.\n\nThe advantage of limiting the term of ofﬁce is that it promotes the constant generation of new ideas through new appointments. However, it may undermine institutional experience, especially if EMB members’ terms coincide with a single electoral cycle. Many electoral laws that specify limited terms of ofﬁce for EMB members allow for reappointment by mutual consent between the appointee and the appointing authority. South Africa and Zambia limit EMB members to two terms of ofﬁce, while Pakistan and Russia do not limit EMB members’ terms of ofﬁce. Reappointment is prohibited by law in Mexico and the Philippines.\n\nIn South Africa, the terms of EMB members are staggered. Every new appointment is made for a period of seven years and not for the remainder of other members’ terms. In Senegal, one-third of EMB members are appointed every three years; Mexico similarly staggers appointments. In Guam, Guinea and Senegal, if a vacancy occurs then the replacement serves only until the end of the term of the person they are replacing.\n\nStaggering EMB members’ terms of ofﬁce greatly helps retain institutional experience and provides for smooth leadership succession. If appointments are not staggered, the new EMB members should be appointed long enough after the last election to allow the former EMB members to complete and report on their election evaluation, and long enough before the next election for the new EMB members to master their responsibilities before the election period commences. This may often be around mid-way between elections.\n\nRecruitment and Appointment of EMB Members\n\nThe process of appointing EMB members involves nomination or advertisement, selection and appointment. In some countries the law has specific rules for all three stages in the process, but in others only the body that makes the appointment is specified.\n\nRecruitment Through Open Advertisement\n\nIn Iraq, members of the expert-based EMB are recruited through open advertisement. Interested candidates may apply directly to be considered for appointment or be nominated by members of the public. Applications are received and screened (through public interviews) by an independent body. The names of shortlisted candidates are submitted to the head of state for ﬁnal appointment.\n\nWhile open advertising and screening mechanisms can provide a broad range of applicants for EMB member positions and promote competence in the selection of members, they do not necessarily guarantee that the most appropriate candidates are chosen. Where the mechanism for screening and appointing EMB members is dominated by one political grouping, competent candidates who are not in favour with this grouping may have lesser chances of selection.\n\nAppointment of EMB members\n\nThe head of state appoints EMB members in many countries. In Canada, Latvia and Mexico, the legislature is responsible for appointment, while the court is responsible for appointment in Costa Rica. The division of EMB appointment powers between the executive and legislature (and judiciary) provides checks and balances in appointment procedures and enhances the appointment process. If one branch of government (especially the executive) has the sole right to appoint EMB members, there is a danger that such appointees, even if they are men and women of integrity, may be perceived by the public, and especially the opposition parties, as pawns of the appointing authority.\n\nEven if the power to appoint EMB members is divided between the executive and the legislature, this arrangement will be fettered if the same party dominates both branches, or if the executive effectively controls the legislature. In this case, the requirement of a two-thirds majority in the legislature to approve EMB appointments could be a useful remedy, because it may give minority parties a veto power; this voting rule is used in Mexico, Nigeria, Uruguay and Yemen.\n\nThe extent to which the head of state makes his or her own choice, chooses after consultation or follows the decision of others varies. In Pakistan, the head of state chooses all members, while in Guyana and Saint Lucia the head of state appoints all members but chooses only some of them. The unilateral appointment of EMB members, especially by the executive branch, has been criticized by many analysts, who argue that it could encourage the appointment of government and ruling party sympathizers rather than impartial arbiters.\n\nSome form of consultation in appointing members of the EMB is more common. Involving the legislature, including opposition parties, in the conﬁrmation process can help provide some degree of multiparty support for the appointments. Parliamentary factions and groups are consulted in Ukraine, and in Trinidad and Tobago appointments are made based on the advice of the prime minister following consultation with the opposition leader.\n\nWhether the final choice is made by the head of state or the legislature, a nominating committee or less formal grouping of individuals is used for part of the process in some cases. In Guatemala, the nominating committee is composed of university rectors and deans of law and a representative of the bar association. In Bhutan, a short list is jointly proposed by the prime minister, the chief justice, the speaker, the chairperson of the National Council and the leader of the opposition party. In Papua New Guinea, the Electoral Commission Appointments Committee is made up of the prime minister, the leader of the opposition, the chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Appointments and the chair of the Public Service Commission. In Vanuatu, the president appoints based on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission. In Malaysia, the president appoints after consulting the conference o"
