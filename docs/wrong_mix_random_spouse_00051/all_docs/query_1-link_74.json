My Dad played Weezer in the original cast and his brother was Freckles.....They are J.R Smith and Donnie \"Weezer\" Smith. Donnie is of course my Dad who is alive and doing well in Folorida, matter of fact he just left to go home.\n\nHis brother J.R. was of course less fortunate and was slain in the desert outside of Vegas several years ago. Dad saw him about a week of so before it happend.\n\nA lot of folks procalim to have been in the childhood series but were not. We do have the original stills from Hal Roach Studios and cherrish then!\n\nWhen we were children we were allowed to take them in for show and tell at school.\n\nThought you might be interested.\n\nStardanceraz\n\nPost by rascalwatcher on\n\nThat's amazing!\n\nWhen I contacted J.R. Smith, he said he had been out of contact with your father, and wasn't sure where he was living - but was looking for him.\n\nDo you have any details of how and when they were reunited?\n\nPost by rhapsody on\n\nI'm not sure where that one is from, but I know you can see the photo over at Corbis.com. If you go to pro.corbis.com/default.aspx and search for Wheezer it will come up.\n\nGettyImages.com has an assortment of interesting Our Gang photos as well, including a very cute one of Mary Ann Jackson and Wheezer kissing under an umbrella on a beach.\n\nPost by craigoman8 on\n\nThings like this topic are why I had to finally register and join in with the group (after only reading as an \"outsider\" for about 3 months or so). I probably still will be, for the most part, \"lurking in the shadows\" and not doing a reply much, but all of you are a great group and I've learned a lot over these couple of months. Besides reading wonderful things from wonderful people, I've learned from this group how to get the 1st silent Our Gang - Thanks, Robin - the Cabin Fever Little Rascals, a couple of volumes of Hallmark colorized - I didn't know they existed until this group talked about them - and lots and lots of great tidbits. I'm probably going to learn more from you all on how to find the Hal Roach silents and even the later MGM Our Gang for completion's sake. I have been showing what I have now to my kids and grandkids and they love the Rascals. I finally had to join up so I could thank you all."
