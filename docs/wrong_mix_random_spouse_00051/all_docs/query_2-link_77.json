        "text": "Suspended Animation #404\n\nWhile I have great respect and appreciation for the work of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, the silent movie comedians who consistently still make me smile and laugh are Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.\n\nWith the release of their film shorts to television in the 1950s and 1960s, there was resurgence in interest in them.\n\nUnfortunately, they couldn’t fully enjoy it because Hardy died August 7, 1957 and Laurel in February 23, 1965 although Laurel was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award. However, neither received residuals for their work.\n\nLarry Harmon has always been a controversial personality. His adeptness at self-promotion resulted in him claiming things like the creation of Bozo the Clown with little or no scrutiny. He claimed a deep friendship with Stan Laurel that is certainly undercut by one of Laurel’s last letters three days before his death where he claimed he had talked with a lawyer about suing “that a**hole”.\n\nHarmon approached Laurel and his wife Eda in 1961 about generating more income for the couple by his producing an animated series based on the film characters of Stan and Ollie. Harmon also negotiated with Hardy’s widow, Lucille, at the same time for the “likenesses” of the famous comedy pair.\n\nAt the time, there were already plans being discussed in the animation community about syndicated animated series featuring the Three Stooges and Abbot and Costello that later developed and, as I have previously discussed in one of my columns, the possibility of some type of animated series featuring the Marx Brothers.\n\nHarmon gave Laurel the impression that he was only signing a contract for an animated pilot for NBC that might lead to a series and signing for merchandise rights to only that pilot. That was not the case.\n\nHe also gave the impression he would use Chuck McCann, a friend of Laurel’s, as the voice of Hardy which met with Laurel’s approval. McCann never got along with Harmon and Harmon used Jim McGeorge instead.\n\nNBC in an announcement in the New York Times October 22nd, 1961 said that the show “would be televised in color in prime time although the weekly half-hour period has not been selected.”\n\nIn a United Press International press release dated May 7, 1961, Laurel said about the proposed project that “I hope they’ll be good. Our films approached ‘cartoonery’ and some of the things we did in the movies could be done in cartoons” referring to some of the exaggerated physical gags in the films.\n\n“I hope they won’t do all the plots of our movies in the TV series. They should have fresh stories for the cartoons,” said Laurel who said he planned to confine his activities to script consultation suggesting story lines from his home and concentrate on dialog.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times in May 1961 reported: “Laurel and Hardy, the most successful and durable team of comics in the history of entertainment, will be on television next fall—as a cartoon series.\n\n“The idea of taking the human characters and turning them into cartoon characters is Larry Harmon’s. ‘We’re going to do Laurel and hardy as a half-hour cartoon series,’ Mr. Harmon explained. ‘The figures will be those of Laurel and hardy and the voices will be theirs, too’.\n\n“At this juncture, Mr. Harmon, who is the voice of Bozo the Clown, did an imitation of Stan Laurel which caused near-by heads to swivel. “When I call Stan sometimes I imitate his voice,” Mr. Harmon said. “He still can’t get over it. ‘It’s like talking to myself,’ he told me once.”\n\nOf course, Hardy could not provide his voice because he had died four years earlier and Laurel had indicated he did not want to do the voice without “Babe” and the fact that he felt having grown older he wouldn’t be able to match his voice in the films. Harmon did the voice of Laurel in the series but examining the episodes, it changes and some say improves as the series went on.\n\nOn January 11, 1962, Laurel wrote to Richard Sloan, “I very seldom see or hear from Mr. Harmon so know little about his affairs concerning the cartoon series. I understand they have started production (I read in the trade papers here). That’s all I know about it.”\n\nSeveral letters from 1962 and 1963 repeat over and over again that Laurel had not heard from Harmon. Laurel apparently was shown a small animation “test” that disappointed him and felt was “lousy”.\n\nThrough Variety, Laurel learned in 1963 that the NBC deal was cancelled and Harmon was looking for a syndication deal. Harmon never told Laurel what happened with NBC. Supposedly, there is a 16mm copy of the pilot out there somewhere.\n\nHarmon produced some items with the Laurel and Hardy cartoon figures including a plastic coin bank with Laurel’s likeness that Laurel never knew existed until one of his fans sent him a picture of some of the toys. It is unclear whether Laurel or his wife ever received any royalties from these items. Part of the profits from the cartoon series did eventually go to Laurel’s widow.\n\nDavid L. Wolper, a documentary film maker, had aligned himself with Hanna-Barbera and had acquired the rights to make a cartoon version of Laurel and Hardy. After Laurel’s death, he approached Hanna-Barbera about making an animated series.\n\nHarmon found out and claimed that he owned the rights for a series. In a legal challenge, it was argued that while the contract may have given Harmon the right to the character from the films, it did not extend to the actual person.\n\nFinally, after much bickering both parties agreed on a state of affairs where two opposing parties agreed to disagree with Harmon giving permission to use the characters in exchange for his film company Jayark getting the distribution rights.\n\nSo it was a strange, uneasy partnership that produced the cartoon series.\n\nThe Laurel and Hardy cartoon show was an animated series with 156 episodes each running about five to six minutes and usually packaged as 62 half hours in syndication. They premiered in September 1966. HIT Entertainment acquired the rights to the series in 1998 and re-packaged the shows with new titles and theme music (Have a Party with Laurel and Hardy).\n\nBesides McGeorge and Harmon, veteran cartoon voice actors including Janet Waldo, Don Messick and Paul Frees as supporting characters.\n\nOne episode of the series Love Me, Love My Puppy is an unofficial remake of the 1931 Laurel and Hardy short Laughing Gravy where the duo try to conceal a happy puppy from an irritable landlord seeking to enforce a no-pets rent clause.\n\nMost Laurel and Hardy fans disliked the series because not only did it not try to capture the style and charm of the comedy team but instead substituted the same story ideas and gags that were in other Hanna-Barbera cartoon series of the time. The show concentrated more on dialog than slapstick action.\n\nSome argue that despite its many flaws, the series did introduce the characters to a new generation, created a plethora of collectible merchandise and kept the spirit of Laurel and Hardy alive.\n\nCritic Leonard Maltin said, “To criticize these cartoons is pointless. Any imitation, even a good one, simply cannot be Laurel and Hardy… No one can duplicate Laurel and Hardy’s greatness because they were unique.”\n\nIn 1975, Harmon was embroiled in a lawsuit with Hal Roach who had produced the original Laurel and Hardy shorts over the rights to portray Laurel and Hardy. Harmon won in a New York court. ”It was an expensive fight,” Harmon told the New York Times. ”It cost me $500,000.”\n\nIn the March 24, 1985 issue of Advertising Age, Harmon announced he was planning a new Laurel and Hardy animated mini-series and was hiring twenty to thirty animators to work on it.\n\nIn addition, he was going to produce a Christmas “fairy tale” special about the comedy pair meeting Rapunzel “based upon a story written by himself and Stan Laurel that will feature nine new songs by Jerry Livingston”.\n\nOf course, ever the entrepreneur, Harmon also promoted an upcoming Broadway musical featuring the comedy duo, a live action film about the sons of Stan and Ollie with Harmon playing the son of Stan, new toys and more."
