        "text": "\"Did Tyrannosaurus, king of all prehistoric beasts, yip, yowl or yodel? Was he a tenor, or a bass?\", wrote Hal Roach Studios to Alfred S. Romer, professor of Zoology and expert in paleontology.\n\n\"How did he, Dimetrodon, Triceratops and the other monsters who roamed the earth when time was young give vent to their antediluvian feelings, if at all?\" Roach was ready to shoot sequences in \"1,000,000 B.C.\" showing a death fight between Tyrannosaurus and Dimetrodon. Only sound was lacking.\n\nBack went Professor Romer's answer: Dimetrodon's call he did not know, but Tyrannosaurus's call bordered on the sound of a radiator steam pipe and a crocodile. The only difficulty was that there couldn't have been a death struggle, for they lived 150,000,000 years apart."
