        "text": "Oliver Hardy (born January 18, 1892, Harlem, Georgia, U.S.—died August 7, 1957, North Hollywood, California) was an American comedic film actor best known as half of the Laurel and Hardy comedy duo. Teamed with Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy made some 100 comedies—many of them classics—between 1921 and 1950.\n\nNorvell Hardy was the youngest of five children. His father died in late 1892; in tribute, the younger Hardy later adopted his father’s first name, Oliver, though he was known as “Babe” by friends and family. As a boy he toured in singing and vaudeville acts. While managing a movie theatre in 1913, Hardy decided that he could do better—or at least no worse—than the actors he saw on-screen, so he went to work at the Lubin studio in Jacksonville, Florida, the following year. He played the menacing “heavy” role in many of these early motion pictures. During the next decade Hardy appeared in more than 200 mostly short films for various studios (beginning with Outwitting Dad [1914] and including an appearance as the Tin Man in the 1925 silent version of The Wizard of Oz). In 1926 he and Laurel separately joined the Hal Roach Studios, one of Hollywood’s great comedy factories. The two soon became members of Roach’s “All-Stars,” an ensemble of comic performers featured in several short comedies. As producer Roach and director-supervisor Leo McCarey noticed the chemistry between Laurel and Hardy, the comics started to work together more often. By the end of 1927 they had officially become a team; their first successful joint comedy was the silent movie Putting Pants on Philip (1927).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn their comedies they played two friends who were brainless but eternally optimistic. Laurel was the guileless nitwit who caused most of their troubles, while Hardy was the pompous, irascible, overbearing windbag whose plans always went awry. With their incredible ignorance and stupidity they typically managed to convert a simple, everyday situation into “another nice mess.” The robust but agile Hardy was often the skilled slapstick victim of Laurel’s chronic clumsiness, and, in turn, would take his anger out on his friend. One classic and oft-repeated skit involved the two men seamlessly swapping their iconic bowler hats, with Hardy becoming increasingly flustered to find Laurel’s too-small hat repeatedly perched on his head. Hardy was often portrayed as a gallant flirt who would coyly toy with his necktie, only to be left embarrassed by Laurel’s ineptitude as the plot progressed. As the silent film era ended, the pair achieved great popularity in comedies such as The Battle of the Century (1927), Leave ’Em Laughing (1928), Two Tars (1928), Liberty (1929), and Big Business (1929).\n\nUnlike many other actors of the silent era, Laurel and Hardy easily made the transition to sound motion pictures. Hardy’s Southern tones were perfectly suited to his character, and, with the rise in popularity of musical films, the trained singer was eventually able to utilize his dulcet tenor in a number of pictures. An expert in performance, he generally left to his partner the work of writing and creating their comedy routines. Continuing to work for the Roach studio, the two made sound shorts at first. The Music Box (1932) won an Academy Award for best short subject. Starting with Pardon Us (1931), they also made full-length feature films. Of their features, Sons of the Desert (1933) and Way Out West (1937) are generally regarded as classics."
