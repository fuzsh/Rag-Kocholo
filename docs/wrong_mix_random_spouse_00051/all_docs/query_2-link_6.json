        "text": "Irish comedian\n\nNot to be confused with Hal Roach.\n\nHal Roach (4 November 1927 – 28 February 2012) was a prominent Irish comedian. He spent over 60 years in show business as a live performer, having also recorded albums, DVDs and was featured in the Guinness World Records for the longest-running engagement of a comedian at the same venue: 26 years at Jury's Irish Cabaret, Jury's Ballsbridge Hotel, Dublin.[citation needed] Despite having the same first and last name, he is not related to the pioneering comedy film producer of the exact same first and last name known for his work with Laurel and Hardy, The Little Rascals, and Harold Lloyd. Coincidentally, both people of the same first and last name are known for comedy.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn John Roche in Waterford, where he attended the Manor Christian Brothers school, Roche began his career after winning a local talent competition as a boy soprano. He initially toured with an illusionist and specialised in magic, but later moved to comedy.[1]\n\nComedy\n\n[edit]\n\nA typical Hal Roach joke is as follows: \"He told me that I have a cult following, at least I think that's what he said\".\n\nAnother- \"There is a man sitting in the middle of the road casting his fishing line... now none of us is perfect, but c'mon! So I asked him, \"How many have you caught today?\" He said, \"You're the ninth.\"\n\nPerhaps his most famous catchphrase is \"Write it down, it's a good one!\".\n\nHe was a regular panelist on the 1970s RTÉ television show What's My Line? which was based on the original American version of the same name.\n\nRoach has been cited as a major influence by other comedians such as Brendan Grace.[2]\n\nRoach was popular particularly with American tourists visiting Ireland. His act played heavily on traditional tourist imagery of Ireland and on Irish jokes. Several of his shows have been released on cassette and CD, and they are popular with tour bus drivers in several English-speaking countries who play them to passengers to help pass the time between destinations.[citation needed]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter suffering from a long bout of ill health, Roach died on 28 February 2012. The following month, RTÉ broadcast a tribute to Roach in one of its graveyard slots, a repeat airing of a programme from the That's Entertainment series first broadcast in 1972.[3]\n\nRecordings\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe King of Blarney Irish Records\n\nWe Irish Talk Like That Irish Records/Ceol\n\nHe Must Be Joking Irish Records/Ceol/Rajon\n\nI Think I'm Having One of My Turns Cabaret Records\n\nAn Audience With Irish Records/Ceol/Rajon\n\nThe Best of Irish Humour Grainne Music/Ceol/Rajon\n\nHal Roach & Friends Ovation\n\nWrite It Down Grainne Music/Rajon\n\nIt's That Man Again!
