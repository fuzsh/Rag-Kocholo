        "text": "My 2nd great-uncle, Erastus Laban Tower, served a number of years as the postmaster in Uniontown, Indiana. I wanted to find out more about his time as postmaster which at first I thought spanned from 1886 to 1911 (his obituary).\n\nThen I found that he was appointed on January 13, 1892 (U.S., Appointments of U. S. Postmasters, 1832-1971 on Ancestry.com).\n\nThe 1900 census listed him as a farmer but perhaps being postmaster did not pay well enough so he combined farming and postal work. In his wife’s obituary, it said she served as assistant postmaster. There was a 1903 list with the compensation for being a postmaster. It listed Erastus L. Tower as receiving $103.87. I believe that amount was the total annual payment, not a monthly payment.\n\nThe USPS site gave this information on how a person became a postmaster:\n\nFrom 1836 to 1971, postmasters at the larger Post Offices were appointed by the President, by and with the consent of the Senate. Postmasters earning less than $1,000 per year were appointed by the Postmaster General, generally upon the advice of the local congressman or townspeople. Regulations required that postmasters execute a valid bond and take an oath of office. Prior to 1971, it was also required that postmasters live in the delivery area of their Post Office.\n\nI’ve shared some information about Erastus Laban Tower on this blog and also on a page at a site called Hubpages. Below is his obituary which I found in a library when we visited Indiana some years ago.\n\nThis post is part of my participation in the Sepia Saturday blog challenge. They post a photo each week which sets the theme. Here’s their picture for this week, a postman in Sweden. I doubt that small town postmasters in the U.S. had official looking hats like that.\n\nThe prompt for the 52 Ancestors challenge was “beards,” so I started hunting through my family photos for bearded fellows. Wanting to be thorough and systematic, I started with the Kansas Vinings. It turns out that they were a pretty clean-shaven bunch.\n\nI did find some handsome mustaches that must have been a popular look for the early 1900s.\n\nVining Family\n\nKennedy Family\n\nI had better luck with the Kennedy family of Baldwin, Kansas. David Greacen Kennedy wore an impressive beard. His son, Jim, choose to go with a mustache.\n\nTower Family\n\nFor the Tower line in Kansas, my Civil War ancestor wore a beard most of his life. Abraham Bates Tower opted for the chin beard minus the mustache.\n\nMartin Family\n\nThree Martins with mustaches represent the Martin family.\n\nMcGhee Family\n\nThe McGhee family moved from Arkansas to Montgomery County, Kansas. Samuel Newton McGhee is the fellow with the mustache here.\n\nIt impressed me when I saw the advanced age that my 2nd great-grandfather lived to be. Born in 1837, he lived until 1930 after surviving the Civil War and 6 months in Andersonville as a prisoner of war. It gladdened me to have such a hardy soul on my family tree.\n\nI knew that his granddaughter, Bertha McGhee lived to the age of 96, so I searched further on the longevity of his children and grandchildren. Quite a few lived into their eighties, but I was hunting nonagenarians. Here’s what I’ve found so far.\n\nTower Descendants Who Lived 90+ Years\n\ndaughter – Melissa “Malissie” Angeline TOWER 1878–1970 (91 years)\n\ndaughter – Viola Matilda TOWER 1873–1964 (91 years)\n\ngranddaughter – Daisy Rachell FISCUS 1913–2006 (91 years)\n\ngranddaughter – Nancy Melvina TOWER 1899–1993 (94 years)\n\ngranddaughter – Bertha MCGHEE 1903 – 1999 (96 years)\n\nI like to think that longevity may get passed along in our genes and hope that some of those Tower genes are strong in me.\n\n52 Ancestors in 52 Weeks\n\nWeek 40 Topic: Oldest\n\nThe theme this week was “multiple” and since I don’t have many twins or triplets on my family tree, I’ll explore the multiple marriages of Mary Louisa Tower. She is the older sister by seven years of my great-grandmother, Viola Matilda Tower McGhee. There were 10 children born to Abraham and Nancy Angeline Tower, but two died very early in life.\n\nMary Louisa was their first child after Abraham returned from the Civil War. Mary’s older siblings (Laura Ann and Erastus Laban) were born before the war in Indiana, but Mary Louisa was born on July 31, 1866, in Linn County, Missouri. There were cousins there too and Alta May Williams was closest in age to Mary Louisa.\n\nThe family moved to Arkansas in 1876. By 1881, they were back in Indiana where Abraham and Nancy Tower grew up. There 20-year-old Mary Louisa met and married Peter Rudolph Newton, Jr. in Birdeye on January 1, 1884. He was the son of the minister who started the Reformed Methodist Church there. He died twelve years later leaving the widowed Mary Louisa with five children. The oldest was just 10.\n\nThe day after Christmas in 1899, Mary Louisa Tower Newton married Daniel W. Waller. Apparently, that didn’t work out, as six months later, she and the children are listed in the census with no mention of Daniel Waller. A mention in The Herald of Jasper, Indiana on April 27, 1900, told of a Dan Waller in the Dubois County jail which might explain his absence from the home. “Dan Waller, an insane prisoner in the county jail, tore the cock off the water pipe Wednesday, and let the water run in the room.” A plumber was called to solve the problem.\n\nAn earlier article shed more light on Waller’s state of mind.\n\nDan Waller insane on religion Fri, Apr 13, 1900 – 5 · The Jasper Weekly Courier (Jasper, Indiana) · Newspapers.com\n\nI don’t know if the marriage was annulled or if it ended in divorce. In 1910, her last name is listed as Waller in the census. Her 72-year-old father was living with her, and some of her children.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1912, that Mary Louisa was willing to take the plunge and marry again. On December 23rd of that year, she wed Daniel C. Vibber. Her new spouse was a barber and had his own shop. Both had lost a first spouse to death and a second spouse to divorce or annulment. Mary Louisa was 46 and Daniel Vibber was 48. Each had children still living with them.\n\nTheir marriage lasted thirty years before Daniel Vibber died. Mary Louisa was widowed for six years before dying herself on December 22, 1948, at the home of her son, Ralph Newton. Left behind to mourn her were two other sons, Rudolph Newton and John Newton; three daughters, Mrs. Bertha Combs, Mrs. Cora Cook, and Mrs. Nora Atkins. She had 29 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren. Burial was at Floral Park Cemetery in Indianapolis.\n\nOne little oddity, many of the important dates of her life centered around Christmas and the New Year.\n\nJanuary 1, 1884 – marriage to Peter Newton Jr.\n\nDecember 26, 1899 – marriage to Daniel Waller\n\nDecember 23, 1912 – marriage to Daniel Vibber\n\nDecember 22, 1948 – Mary Louisa Tower Vibber died\n\nIn tracking my ancestor’s path with the 93rd Indiana Infantry, Company G, I found this account given by Bert King as told to him by his grandfather, Daniel N. King. It is from The Herald, Jasper, Indiana 26 Mar 1977, Sat • Page 6.\n\nI’ve broken the narrative into bullet points to show the different locations and battles. I did not change the wording or sequence.\n\n“A history of Company G, 93rd Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry follows: The company organized at New Albany and mustered into the service Sept. 1, 1862.\n\nNov. 9th it moved to Cairo, III., and from thence to Memphis, Tenn.\n\nOn Nov. 26, the regiment moved from Memphis to Hurricane Creek near Oxford, Miss, and was assigned to the Eighth Division of the 16th Army Corps.\n\nDec. 20, moved to Lagrange Tenn., where the regiment stayed until\n\nJan. 8, then it moved to Corinth and was deployed along the railroad,\n\nmarched on the 13th of January, moved to Memphis and from thence to Helena, Ark., and thence to Duckport, La., where it was transferred to the 15th Army Corps.\n\nAt Jackson, the company had its first engagement with the enemy, having three men wounded.\n\nIt moved to the rear of Vicksburg arriving there May 18, and remained there until June 22.\n\nArrived at Jackson July 10 and entered the city July 17. On the I6th, Capt. Spilman was wounded through the right wrist.\n\nMoved to Oak Ridge, Miss., and from thence went on an expedition to Brownsville, Miss.,\n\nand on 15 of October had an engagement with the enemy near that place;\n\nNov. 7, marched to Vicksburg, and embarked for Memphis where it remained doing picket and provost duty until Feb. 6, 1864. Several expeditions were made from Memphis,\n\nand on June 1, embarked on what was termed the Guntown Expedition.\n\nOn the 10th of June, met the enemy under General Forrest. Here the company had four men wounded and First Lt. Munier and 24 men captured.”\n\nI won’t follow the rest of the locations as my 2nd great-grandfather was one of the 24 men from Company G captured at Guntown (also called the Battle of Brice’s Crossroads). The 93rd Infantry was under the command of D.C. Thomas of Salem, Indiana. About 150 of the 93rd were captured there. Abraham Tower and the others were sent to Andersonville Prison in Georgia where he spent the next 6 months of the war.\n\nWhen he was paroled from that notorious prison, he weighed less than 80 pounds. He traveled to Missouri to join his wife who thought he had died. She had not heard from him since his capture.\n\nRemarkably, Abraham Tower lived into his nineties outliving his wife. He died in 1930.\n\nI would love to see a better scan of this certificate. Perhaps the Indiana State Archives might have a copy. For now, this not-so-good copy that was in the newspaper will have to do.\n\nCompany G, 93rd Indiana certificate Sat, Mar 26, 1977 – Page 6 · The Herald (Jasper, Indiana) · Newspapers.com\n\nAs I browse my family tree, it saddens me to see the children who died so young. Often there is little to show that they were even here at all. Perhaps their name shows up in a census but that was only every 10 years. Maybe there’s a small headstone in a cemetery or their name is added to their parent’s stone but not always. Some families record the births, deaths, and marriages in the family Bible but many of those are lost over the years.\n\nMon, Apr 28, 1919 – 2 · graphic from an ad in The Baltimore Sun (Baltimore, Maryland) · Newspapers.com\n\nI’m looking for details on the youngest child of Abraham and Nancy Tower (my 2nd great-grandparents). Emma Lillian Tower was born in Linn County, Missouri on September 26, 1881. Her father was 43 and her mother was 41 and they already had four sons and five daughters. The family had moved there after the end of the Civil War.\n\nEmma’s father kept a small pocket diary where he recorded the names of the men in Company G, 93rd Indiana Volunteer Infantry who he served with. After the war, he noted the family dates so we know about Emma’s existence.\n\nEmma died just four years later in 1885 in Linn County, Missouri. I was unable to find the exact date of her death, what the cause was, or where she was buried. One wonders if she was a sickly child or if she died in a tragic accident at home or if some epidemic of measles or typhoid or smallpox might have swept through the county.\n\nA few years later, the family moved to Arkansas and later to Kansas. The sorrow and memories of little Emma likely faded or were overlaid by struggles, achievements, joys, and sorrows of the family as the years passed.\n\nHenry Fiscus and his wife Malissie Angeline Tower celebrated a new baby on March 27, 1916, in Kansas. They called the little one Gertie. She had three older brothers and five sisters.\n\nHer siblings were Sarah 1897, Ruthie 1899, Lewis 1901, Ruben 1903 (he died young), Nora 1906, Martha 1908, John 1911, and Daisy 1913.\n\nAt 2 1/2, Gertie lost her status as the youngest child when a baby brother, Charlie Isaac, was born in June of 1918. By this time, the family had moved to Prague, Oklahoma.\n\nLittle did the family know that the year of 1918 would be one of loss and sorrow for them. The Great War raged in Europe and young men from Prague marched bravely away to board trains and then troopships heading for France. The Fiscus family may have felt lucky that their sons were too young for the army.\n\nThen on September 11, 1918, little Gertie died. Over 100 years have passed, so we don’t know if it was the dreaded Spanish Flu that took their daughter away. I found a report that said in Oklahoma, the epidemic started around Sept. 26 in Oklahoma City and Tulsa.\n\nPerhaps Gertie Fiscus was a victim of the early arrival of influenza before it was identified as an epidemic. By October 4th, more than 1,200 Oklahomans in 24 counties had been stricken with the flu. I found another article that estimated that between October 1918 and April 1919, around “7,350 Oklahomans died of the virus and secondary infections related to it.”\n\nJust five weeks later, Prague was shaken by a destructive tornado that killed two women and injured fifteen others. 1918 was not a good year for the Fiscus family and Prague, Oklahoma.\n\nMy daily homage in March to the women in my family. By sharing their faces and stories during Women’s History Month I’m forced to dig deeper for the missing pieces of their lives. I’m hoping that others are out there looking for them as well.\n\nMaggie Pillar\n\nMargaret Ann Pillar was born on February 20, 1873, in Tennessee. Her father was Thomas F. Pillar and her mother, Nancy J. Henson. Her family lived in Jackson, Arkansas, in 1880.\n\nShe married William Warren Tower (my 2nd great-uncle) on June 12, 1892, in Boone, Arkansas. They had five children in 14 years. In 1900, the family was living in Big Creek, Taney, Missouri, where Willie was farming. They then moved to Tyro, Kansas to be near Willie’s family there. By 1910, they were in South Creek Township, Lincoln, Oklahoma. She died on August 11, 1913, at the age of 40, and was buried in Lincoln.\n\nThe Children of Margaret Ann Pillar and William Warren Tower\n\nMyrtle May 1893 – 1939\n\nCharles Edward 1895 – 1979\n\nNancy Melvina (called Vina) 1899 – 1993\n\nBessie Pearl 1903 – 1981\n\nEdith Hester 1908 – 1991\n\nMore Photos of the Family\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nBefore the Civil War engulfed his life, my great-great-grandfather labored making barrels. In the 1860 census, Abraham Bates Tower, age 22, lists cooper as his work. It shows him as living in Jennings Township, Crawford County, Indiana and I’m guessing that he wasn’t very many miles from Leavenworth, an active shipping point on the Ohio River.\n\nHe was not the only one, many other coopers worked in that township. Other occupations in the census included river pilots, wagon builders, river loaders, skiff maker, carpenters, merchants, and farmers. Probably, the local farm produce was packed into boxes and barrels for shipping on the barges that plied the Ohio River.\n\nAbraham had married Nancy Angeline Long two year earlier and they had an 8-month-old child named Laura Ann born 29 September 1859. Their son, Erastus was born August 7, 1861.\n\nThe household included Abraham’s mother-in-law, 55-year-old, Nancy Ann (Daggs) Long who was separated from her husband. Six years later, she and Thomas Long divorced.\n\nThe family shared the house with another cooper who had a wife and child. His name was T.J. Linn (age 22) and his wife was Rebecca Z. (or J) Linn (age 21). The age of this Rebecca isn’t right to be Nancy Angeline’s sister Rebecca Bolton Long who was born January 14, 1829. None of Abraham’s sisters or nieces were the right age to be Rebecca Linn. Perhaps the two families just shared housing and were not related.\n\nBefore long, Abraham Tower would go off to the Civil War as part of Company G, 93rd Indiana Volunteer Infantry. He barely survived starvation and disease in the notorious Andersonville Prison and at the end of the war reunited with Nancy Angeline in Missouri where she’d moved to be with her sister’s family.\n\nDespite long-term health issues, he farmed and there was no mention of being a cooper again. I imagine that it’s a skill that you can put to use on a farm if you have the tools. There’s always a need for barrels and wooden containers.\n\nThe Tower family traces its ancestors back to Hingham, Massachusetts. Apparently, there’s a long history in that town of coopering. Recently, I found an article called Bucket Town: Four Centuries Of Toymaking And Coopering In Hingham.\n\nNumerous settlers became coopers and the streets were lined with bucket-making shops. Thomas Lincoln, who arrived from southwest England, was considered the first cooper in the town. In 1636, he called himself a maltster and an occasional carpenter. Coopering developed into a major trade by the mid-1600s, with 30 craftsmen joining Lincoln in the trade by 1700. Unlike their peers in Boston, who were making barrels, casks and kegs, the Hingham coopers were skilled in fabricating pails to transport milk and water; tubs for curing meat, dyeing fabrics and laundering; churns for making butter; strainers and hoops for cheeses; boxes to store spices; and a number of different woodenware to carry related goods.\n\nSince these woodenwares were a necessity for settlers, Hingham craftspeople rose to the occasion. It was not until the mid-1800s that these products were sold in wholesale stores in cities like Boston. Earlier, they were purchased onboard the Hingham Station packets at Long Wharf. “The shipping records in Boston,” explains Bray, “were loaded with woodenware that was going up or down the coast, overland, to Canada or the West Indies.” Jackson adds that the Hingham buckets also traveled with prospectors out to the Gold Rush and even with the missionaries to Hawaii.\n\nSo, even generations later and a third of the way across the country, a Tower descendant carried out the tradition of coopering.\n\nIn visiting historic villages in Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, and also New Brunswick (Canada), I had the chance to see coopers at work and admire the useful buckets, washtubs, and barrels they created. All the photos are by Virginia Allain and are from those trips.\n\nMany of my immigrant ancestors made the arduous journey by sea to the colonies in search of religious freedom. The mandated, government religion in England did not suit them so in the 1600s, the Tower family set off for what became Hingham in the Massachusetts Colony. Knowing that family history, not just for the Tower family but also other early arrivals in the colonies (Vining, Joy, and likely other lines), shaped my thinking about religion.\n\nTower family history Sun, May 23, 1909 – 26 · The Boston Globe (Boston, Massachusetts) · Newspapers.com\n\nI’m a strong advocate of separation of church and state. Fortunately, the founding fathers as they worked on crafting the U.S. Constitution put that in. Jefferson, Franklin, and other great minds of the 1700s wanted to preserve the U.S. government from control by religious groups. In America, you are free to practice the religion of your choice and not have the government telling you which you can choose and not having those religions dictating laws for the government.\n\nTherefore, I’m happy to find on my family tree umpteen variations of Christianity from Quakers to even a couple of Mormons and I’m sure, some atheists too. There are probably other religions that I haven’t spotted yet on the family tree from Jewish to Islamic to Hindu. Many people today identify themselves as spiritual but not part of any organized religion.\n\nHere’s more from Wikipedia about the Great Migration which the early Tower family were part of:\n\nMany Puritans refused to conform to the wishes of the King (Charles I) and his loyal Archbishop so they fled to the Plymouth Bay or Massachusetts Bay colonies, in what has been labeled the “Great Migration.” In 1633, migration from England to the Americas began with a number of participants on a ship named the Bonaventure. Robert Peck, the Rector of St Andrew’s Church, emigrated to the new colony of Massachusetts with half of his congregation, most likely all of the 133 people on HMS Diligent, which departed in June 1638 from Ipswich, England. Peck had been censured by religious authorities for his Puritan practices, and his daughter had married the son of another well-known Puritan minister named John Rogers.\n\nThe passengers on the Diligent, working-class people such as shoemakers and millers, a number of ministers, and gentry, were mostly Puritans. Once there, the passengers founded “New” Hingham, to remind them of “Old” Hingham in England. Once most of the passengers settled there, the population of the town had doubled. More specifically they were called East Anglicans, possibly named after the former Kingdom of East Angles in which Hingham resided, and maybe after the Anglican Church.\n\nIn more recent generations, my tree contains deacons and ministers in various denominations. My great-aunt Bertha McGhee studied at Baker University in Kansas. Later, while working at the Methodist orphanage in Seward, Alaska, she used her free time to start a church in the rural community of Hope. This photo shows Bertha inside that log church in the 1940s.\n\nBertha’s Story of Going to Alaska\n\nIn 1939 on the advice of a Deaconess friend, I enrolled for a year of post-graduate training at National College for Deaconesses and Missionaries. As the time for graduation neared and field representatives came to interview graduates for appointments. I wondered if I would consider a task in Alaska if it was offered.\n\nWhile in Baker I had taken a course in the “Spread of Christianity around the World” and Dr. Ebright had assigned me the area of Alaska to study. Besides that a friend in our student volunteers for Christ had shared letters from a nurse friend of hers, who had gone with a group of children by boat from Nome via Unalaska to Seward when the Jesse Lee Home had been moved there in 1925. Nurse, Beth Stewart Dalit was to become a very dear friend of mine in the years that followed."
