        "text": "I didn't set out to do this; it just dropped into my lap. I was not searching for evidence that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Naples or anything like that. (They are still all over the place.) I was merely idling my search engine on St. Patrick's Day and came across a list of Irish flautist James Galway's Five Favorites for the Day. My eye ran down the list —with me struggling to keep up— and saw the song \"I dreamt that I dwelt in Marble Halls.\" Hah, I thought, I know that song!—or at least used to. I had stored it many years ago way back on a dusty memory shelf reserved for sentimental 19th-century songs on the order of Believe Me, if all those endearing young charms and Drink to me only with thine eyes. But I had really known nothing about the song, itself. I clicked on the link and heard a lovely rendition by Irish singer, Enya. (Audio link, below.)\n\n(So far, nothing, but then the chain of pseudo-connectivity for which I hope to become infamous started to link together like all those bits and pieces of liquid metal that make up bad-guy cyborg, Robert Patrick, in Terminator 2.)\n\n(Rewrite starts here)\n\nWhen I first started to work this item up (14 years ago!) I had heard of the song and I knew about where Bohemia was or at least used to be. It is in the modern-day Czech Republic, the capital of which is Prague. I was happy to see that the song was from a well-known opera, light-hearted, so lets says 'operetta' or 'light opera'. I wrote then:\n\n\"I dreamt that I dwelt in Marble Halls\" is an aria from the opera The Bohemian Girl composed in 1844 by Irish composer Michael William Balfe (1808-1870). (Lyrics/libretto by Alfred Bunn, 1796-1860.) Balfe was a prolific composer, writing the music for over 20 operas. The Bohemian Girl is the one work he is remembered for; it has been translated into other languages and is loosely based on a tale by Cervantes, La Gitanilla. (The Bohemian Girl is also the source of the 1936 Laurel & Hardy film of that name. Image film poster, insert, top, of which more, below.)\n\nLink to an an audio segment performed by Enya.\n\nI dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls,\n\nWith vassals and serfs at my side,\n\nAnd of all who assembled within those walls,\n\nThat I was the hope and the pride.\n\nI had riches too great to count,\n\nCould boast of a high ancestral name;\n\nBut I also dreamt, which pleased me most,\n\nThat you lov'd me still the same...\n\n(Bunn, the lyricist, was an English theatrical manager. In his successful career he ran both Drury Lane and Covent Gardens. He had a knack for lyrics, as well, and his lyrics here are skillful.) Balfe (rhymes with \"Ralph\") travelled widely and worked in Italy and France. In the late 1820s, he went to Paris, where he met Rossini, who by that time in his life had moved to France. Now —link, link, link— Balfe also had a pleasant baritone voice and a modest career on the operatic stage. Somehow —maybe he and Rossini went out drinking together— Balfe wound up singing the role of Figaro in Rossini's The Barber of Seville, presented at the Italian Opera in Paris in 1827. The Barber of Seville, of course, was composed by Rossini in 1816 in Naples. Everything is related to Naples. I rest my case! \"\n\nIf you just dropped in to this entry at this point, it helps to read the top half of this page first.\n\nentry 2 added Match 19, 2022and rewritten on March 30\n\nThe film, itself, is here. It's good. If you liked \"the Boys\" (like most of the world) you'll like this one, and hear the song that highlights the whole operetta (at 47 min into the running time of 1 hr 9 min: \"I Dreamt that I Dwelt in Marble Halls\". It's what Jacquelyn Wells looks like she's singing in this screen-grab. (She, too, as noted, was dubbed.) (Spoiler: Oliver Hardy is on the left.)\n\nI don't know if movies are magic, but they sure are complicated."
