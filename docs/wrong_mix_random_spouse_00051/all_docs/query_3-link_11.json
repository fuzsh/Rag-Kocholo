Roach is an author of books for both children and adults. In an example of the former, Presto; or, The Adventures of a Turnspit Dog, Roach follows the travels of a plucky terrier in eighteenth-century London. Presto had spent most of his life in a turnspit, \"a devilish device by which a roast was kept turning on a spit by means of a small dog's running constantly within a wheel,\" as Selma G. Lanes described it in a New York Times Book Review article. Escaping from this terrible life, Presto explores London, meeting in his wanderings a company of pickpockets, forgers, innkeepers, actors, puppeteers, and of course several other dogs. Although the terrier's adventures often result in danger, the author, observed Lanes, \"does not dwell on injustice and cruelty, but rather on fortitude and imagination, loyalty and affection—those qualities which enable heroes to prevail over blind chance.\" The book, Lanes concluded, is \"a tour de force of unobtrusive scholarship woven into a rich and suspenseful tale…. Not since Natalie Babbitt's [Tuck Everlasting] has there been so original a novel for children.\" Washington Post Book World critic Leon Garfield recommended Presto not only to children but to their parents, as well, writing that adults would be \"surprised by the high spirits, the stylishness and the honest delight in storytelling.\"\n\nA number of Roach's adult-level books focus on the historical events surrounding the infamous Salem witch trials. With In the Days of the Salem Witchcraft Trials, the author focuses on the social, political, and economic atmosphere in which the trials were conducted. She starts with a succinct summary of the trials themselves, then offers historical facts on life in Massachusetts during the 1690s, including information on religion, law, government, generally held beliefs in the supernatural, how people made their living, and the colonial economy. Kliatt reviewer Edna Boardman felt the book would be \"excellent for use in teaching units for as the first introduction to historical research.\"\n\nRoach narrows her focus even further with The Salem Witch Trials: A Day-by-Day Chronicle of a Community under Siege. In this book, she thoroughly reconstructs the daily events, interactions, and developments of the trials as they unfolded. She covers five years of witch-hunting, from 1692 to 1697, with each year broken down into by-month chapters, and each chapter further separated by day. Roach also reconstructs the social context of the trials and shows how the community lived its life from day to day as the trials and witch-hunts dragged on. She looks at contemporary dangers, such as the increasing frequency of Indian attacks, and at the religious, political, and social turmoil of the time, all of which helped create the atmosphere in which the Salem trials, unthinkable today, took place. \"The result is a work that is at once a narrative for those wanting to see the larger sweep of things and a reference book for those who want to look at the events of a particular day,\" observed Kenneth P. Minkema in Christian Century. Kendrick Frazier and Benjamin Radford, reviewing the book for the Skeptical Inquirer, called it \"a remarkable achievement,\" while a Publishers Weekly contributor attested that \"Roach's detailed reference book provides deep insights into the trial years by letting us listen to the voices of everyone involved.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBooklist, May 15, 1996, Carolyn Phelan, review of In the Days of the Salem Witchcraft Trials, p. 1584.\n\nBooks & Culture, March-April, 2003, \"What Happened in Salem?,\" review of The Salem Witch Trials: A Day-by-Day Chronicle of a Community under Siege, p. 35.\n\nChristian Century, April 19, 2003, Kenneth P.
