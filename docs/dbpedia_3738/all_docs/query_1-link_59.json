        "text": "Venue: Orpheum\n\nVCT Presents Silent Movie Mondays: Charlie Chaplin Shorts\n\nEscape to the 1920s silent movie era at the historic Orpheum theatre! Vancouver Civic Theatres is thrilled to present Silent Movie Mondays, an immersive experience that screens popular silent films accompanied by dramatic music played live on the historic Wurlitzer organ â€“ the last theatre organ in Canada still performing in its original home.\n\nJoin us in the West Coast Lounge for a pre-show performance by the Gatsby Strutters Jazz Band. Following the show, Keith Blackmore of the Vancouver Film School will host a lively discussion about the movie and the role of silent films in the evolution of film history.\n\nCharlie Chaplin Shorts\n\nIn the short films he made during his early career, Charlie Chaplin perfected what would become his trademark themes and techniques while creating films that many critics have to come to regard as his best work. Three short films will be screened:\n\nThe Fireman (1916)\n\nCharlie Chaplin stars as an earnest but incompetent fireman who can't seem to do anything right. Chaplin spots the love of his life (Edna Purviance) trapped in a burning building and leaps into heroic action to save her, unaware that his boss, the fire department chief, has agreed to let the building burn so an acquaintance can collect the insurance money.\n\nThe Floorwalker (1916)\n\nCharlie Chaplin plays a customer in a department store who becomes unwittingly entangled in a nefarious scheme. The store safe is robbed by the department store manager and floorwalker - who happens to bear a striking resemblance to Chaplin. Chaplin finds himself with the stolen money and a wild chase ensues. Known as the first silent film to contain a running staircase (escalator) gag.\n\nThe Adventurer (1917)\n\nCharlie Chaplin plays an escaped convict on the run. Shortly after breaking out of prison, he encounters a girl and her mother and heroically saves them from drowning. They happen to be members of high society and invite Chaplin into their world, where he wreaks havoc at a swanky party."
