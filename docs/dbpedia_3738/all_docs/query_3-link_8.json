        "text": "Can you guess the No. 1 fire movie for firefighters? (Spoiler alert: It’s not ‘Backdraft’)\n\nThere are dozens of films about firefighters and firefighting, including many documentaries, silent movies and comedies. In other words, as long as movies have been made, firefighting has been one of the subjects.\n\nAnd so, it’s that time again – time to take a stab at discussing films about firefighters and firefighting.\n\nOur original list from 2016 featured the top six films. And now we’re adding another great movie to the list: “Only the Brave.” Want to watch them all? Fill out the form on the page to download our best firefighting movies checklist and challenge your colleagues to see who can finish first.\n\nHere’s our list of the seven best firefighting movies of all time:\n\n7. “Ladder 49”\n\n“Ladder 49” details the life of rookie firefighter Jack Morrison as he rises through the ranks in his department. His personal dilemmas unfold as he becomes trapped in the worst blaze of his career. FireRescue1 contributor Jason Zigmont offers commentary about the movie from a firefighting and technical perspective: “The technical advisors did a good job with the scenes. I was impressed to hear a PAR check.”\n\nGet your copy\n\n6. “Fire! Trapped on the 37th Floor”\n\nEven for a TV movie, this one gets our vote. The movie is based on true events that occurred in May 1988 when the Los Angeles First Interstate Bank building caught fire. At the time it was the tallest building in the city. Smoke alarms were not working properly, which allowed the fire to grow until it was uncontrollable.\n\n5. “Crash Landing: The Rescue of Flight 232”\n\nAnother movie based on a true story, “The Rescue of Flight 232” is based on United Airlines Flight 232 from Denver to Chicago. The flight crashed during an emergency landing in 1989. Even though the focus isn’t entirely on firefighters responding to the situation, the perspective from the ground rescue workers is noteworthy.\n\n4. “Backdraft”\n\nWe’d be remiss not to include “Backdraft.” You may be surprised it doesn’t rank higher on the list, but because people constantly ask if a firefighter’s job is like “Backdraft,” it gets docked a few points. “You go, we go.”\n\nGet your copy\n\n3. “Hellfighters”\n\nThis is a movie about Chance Buckman, head of an oilfield firefighting outfit, and his professional and personal ebbs and flows. Full disclosure: You’ll either love this movie or hate it. In fact, when the movie first came out, Roger Ebert said it was a “slow moving, talkative, badly plotted bore.” But we think it’s a pretty great fire-based movie. John Wayne, who plays Buckman, will always get our vote.\n\nGet your copy\n\n2. “Only the Brave”\n\n“Only the Brave” is a well-made picture depicting the lives of the Granite Mountain Hotshots that perished during the 2013 Yarnell Hill Fire. Although I am not a wildland firefighter by trade, I believe this film brings home the true nature of the work our brothers and sisters perform in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) and forests of America. Although we already know the ending, their journey is worth your time.\n\n1. “The Towering Inferno”\n\n“The Towering Inferno,” in our opinion, is the best firefighting/disaster movie out there (even if it’s the most unrealistic fire movie on the list). Steve McQueen … Paul Newman … Faye Dunaway. Need we say more?\n\nBonus: There is one additional movie I have to mention – “Fahrenheit 451.” Two films were made of Ray Bradbury’s dystopian depiction of post second civil war firemen where instead of extinguishing fires, firemen burn books that have been deemed wrong literature by the government. By destroying the banned books, history can be rewritten as illustrated by the fireman’s rules where Ben Franklin remains the original firefighter: “Benjamin Franklin’s rules: 1) answer the alarm swiftly, 2) start the fire swiftly, 3) burn everything, 4) report back to firehouse immediately, 5) stand alert for other alarms.”\n\nGet your copy\n\nFanning the Flames: Lesser-Known Gems That Deserve the Spotlight\n\nFireproof (2008)\n\n“Fireproof” is a faith-based film that tells the story of a firefighter’s crumbling marriage and his journey to restore it. Although it doesn’t focus solely on firefighting, it offers a unique perspective on the personal struggles faced by firefighters outside their professional duties.\n\nAlways (1989)\n\nDirected by Steven Spielberg, “Always” is a romantic drama with a unique twist. It follows a courageous firefighter pilot who falls in love with his partner and must navigate the challenges of both firefighting and romance. Spielberg’s hallmark storytelling and stunning aerial firefighting scenes create a compelling narrative.\n\nFirehouse Dog (2007)\n\n“Firehouse Dog” provides a family-friendly take on the genre. The film tells the story of a Hollywood dog that goes missing and ends up in a firehouse, where it reinvigorates the crew and teaches them lessons about life, love, and loyalty.\n\nFirefighters in War and Peace: Diverse Perspectives on Heroism\n\nFrequency (2000)\n\n“Frequency” stars Dennis Quaid as a firefighter who communicates with his deceased son, a detective, due to unusual solar flares. This heartwarming thriller explores the concept of heroism and sacrifice beyond the physical realm.\n\nFire with Fire (2012)\n\nAn action film where the protagonist, a firefighter, takes on vigilante measures after witnessing a murder. Though it leans more toward action-thriller, it touches on the noble calls of duty and the blurred lines between law and justice.\n\nBeyond Hollywood: Firefighter Stories From Around the Globe\n\nFirefighters (1994, Japan)\n\nA documentary that delves into the lives of Tokyo’s busiest firemen, showcasing the universal nature of firefighting and the high stakes of the profession, even in a different cultural context.\n\nFire (1996, India)\n\nA Tamil film focusing on a group of vacationers at a forest fire lookout who must find their way back to safety during a sudden forest fire. It provides an intense look at survival and the crucial role of quick thinking during such disasters.\n\nThe Tower (2012, South Korea)\n\nA South Korean film where a massive fire engulfs a luxury supertanker in Seoul. The firefighting team attempts a daring rescue, and the film focuses on both the heroes and the trapped guests, weaving a dramatic narrative.\n\nWatching the World Burn: Firefighter Movies with a Social Commentary\n\nSt. Florian’s Gate (2007, Poland)\n\nSet in medieval Poland, “St. Florian’s Gate” tells the tale of a knight who saves his town from a fire. The film highlights themes of faith, sacrifice, and the evolution of fire brigades.\n\nIn the Line of Fire (1993)\n\nAlthough primarily a political thriller, Clint Eastwood’s character has a firefighter background. The film weaves themes of service, survival, and the mental toll of duty, drawing parallels between Secret Service agents and firefighters.\n\nBurning (2018, South Korea)\n\nA mystery drama about a former part-time worker investigating a high-profile arson case that impacted lives and politics. “Burning” offers deep social commentary through the lens of fire and firefighting.\n\nFirefighters on the Small Screen: Television’s Love Affair with the Yellow Suit\n\nChicago Fire (2012–)\n\n“Chicago Fire” is a long-running TV series that dives deep into the lives and work of firefighters, paramedics, and the rescue squad at Chicago Firehouse 51. Created by Dick Wolf, it’s known for its gripping storytelling and detailed look at both personal and professional aspects.\n\nEmergency! (1972–1979)\n\nA pioneering TV show focusing on paramedics and firefighters. Known for its mix of drama, humor, and educational content, “Emergency!” helped solidify the image of firefighters as both brave and skilled community members.\n\nRescue Me (2004–2011)\n\nStarring Denis Leary, “Rescue Me” offers a darker, more gritty look at life within the fire department. It explores the psychological strains on first responders while balancing humor and drama.\n\nStreaming Through Smoke: The Best Firefighter Movies on Netflix\n\nThe Smoke (2014)\n\nA British thriller series centered on the London Fire Brigade, following the daily lives of the crew at White Watch. It highlights their bravery and the impact of their work on their personal lives.\n\nAlways on My Mind (1982)\n\nA romantic comedy featuring a firefighter as a primary character. The film focuses on themes of love and second chances, offering a lighter interpretation of firefighter life.\n\nFirefly (2002–2003)\n\nJoss Whedon’s “Firefly,” though set in space, draws on the character of Malcolm Reynolds, whose protective nature and military background resonate with the traits of a firefighter, protecting his crew in the vast expanse of space.\n\nPyromania on the Page: Firefighter Movies That Started as Novels\n\nReport to the Commissioner (1975)\n\nA crime drama based on the novel, featuring a subplot involving a volunteer firefighter. It explores themes of justice, duty, and the parallels between firefighting and combat.\n\nFire in the Sky (1993)\n\nAdapted from “The Night the Mountain Fell,” this disaster film depicts a community’s efforts to combat a wildfire. It highlights the role of firefighters and the communal bond during such events.\n\nFire Sermon (2015)\n\nA Canadian science fiction movie set in a post-apocalyptic world. It follows a drifter seeking fresh water while avoiding fire and a menacing regime, using fire as an allegory for the human condition.\n\nMore fire movies and documentaries\n\nLet’s now consider some other firefighting films that didn’t make the list.\n\nThere is “Always,” Steven Spielberg’s homage to the aerial firefighters who fly into the flames. Starring Richard Dreyfus, Holly Hunter and John Goodman, “Always” is a reboot of the World War II-era film “A Guy Named Joe,” which starred Spencer Tracy, Irene Dunne and Van Johnson. In the original film, the story was about fighter pilots, but the plot is the same, as are the names of the characters.\n\nAt one time, one of the most expensive motion pictures ever made was “In Old Chicago.” Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, the movie depicted the O’Leary family and the Great Chicago Fire. I remember watching this film as kid on a Sunday afternoon (in the time before cable) – steamers and hand-pumpers galore. I think the steam fire engines had the same draw for me as steam locomotives."
