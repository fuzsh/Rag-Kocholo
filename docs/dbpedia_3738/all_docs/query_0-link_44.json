This book is proof that her statement was not far from wrong. For over 60 years, she has demonstrated her talent on the stage, in film, radio and television, and as a recording artist. She has managed to combine her successful acting career with other business ventures, which include cattle breeding, a sewing center, music publishing, and two production companies. She is a fine composer and artist. Additionally, she produced a beautiful and talented daughter, Tisha Sterling, who has followed her into the acting profession. Despite serious illness and a debilitating back accident, Miss Sothern has continued to act, receiving her first Academy Award nomination in 1988 for her seventieth film. Ann Sothern began her career as Harriette Lake, playing small roles in motion pictures. After success in Broadway musicals, she returned to Hollywood where her name was changed to Ann Sothern. Few actresses have played such diverse roles, from ingenues to character parts, in comedies, musicals, and dramas. Despite her versatility, many people identify Miss Sothern with her three most popular roles: Maisie Ravier, the down-on-her-luck show girl whom she played in ten films and on two radio series; Susie MacNamara, the efficient-but-meddlesome secretary to a talent agent on TV's Private Secretary; and Katy O'Connor, the ever-helpful assistant manager of a luxury hotel on TV's The Ann Sothern Show. This book is intended as an overview of Miss Sothern's life and career. It does not purport to be an in-depth biography. This volume is divided into eight sections, as follows: (1) a brief biography; (2) a filmography of the movies in which Miss Sothern appeared. Each film listing is preceded by the letter \"F.\" Entries are arranged chronologically by year of\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nAmerican release. Studio, year of release, production and cast credits, a short synopsis, and selected reviews are included for each film; (3) a listing of Miss Sothern's plays and personal appearances. This chapter includes plays performed on Broadway, on tour, and in summer stock, as well as vaudeville and nightclub appearances. Each listing is preceded by the letter \"P.\" Cities played, dates of performances, production and cast credits, a short synopsis, and selected reviews are included when available; (4) a listing of Miss Sothern's national radio appearances. This chapter is divided into two sections dealing with Miss Sothern's series and guest appearances. The two series are preceded by the letters \"RS;\" listings of guest appearances are preceded by the letter \"R.\" Each entry includes episode title, airdate, cast, and selected reviews; (5) a listing of Miss Sothern's national television appearances. This chapter is divided into two sections dealing with Miss Sothern's series and guest appearances. The series listings are preceded by the letters \"TS.\" A further division is explained at the beginning of the television chapter. The guest appearance listings are preceded by the letter \"T.\" Each entry includes episode title, airdate, cast, brief synopsis, and selected reviews. Telefilms listed in this chapter receive the same treatment as theatrical releases; (6) a discography of records made by Miss Sothern. Each listing is preceded by the letter \"D.\" This chapter encompasses recordings of all speeds. Each entry includes record label, number, songs performed by Miss Sothern, and selected reviews; (7) a listing of awards and honors bestowed upon Miss Sothern. Each entry is preceded by the letter \"A.\" Listings include the name of award and approximate year of receipt; (8) an annotated bibliography of writings by and about Miss Sothern. This chapter includes reviews, articles, and announcements from books, newspapers, magazines, tabloids, and trade papers, showing the diverse publications which have written about Miss Sothern's life and career. Each entry is preceded by the letter \"B.\" In addition, the book contains an appendix listing products advertised by Miss Sothern. A complete index of names and titles concludes the volume; index references are to the entry numbers within the various section listings.

Her mother, Annette Yde-Lake, was a concert singer who stopped touring long enough to have her first daughter in what was reported to be 40-below zero temperatures. Harriette claimed to have never seen her birthplace. Harriette's father was Walter J. Lake, variously reported as an itinerant thespian, a produce broker, a meat salesman, and an importer/exporter. Harriette's maternal grandfather was Danish violinist Hans Nilson. Her paternal grandfather was Simon Lake, inventor of the submarine. Harriette was the oldest of three daughters. Marion, born 18 months after Harriette, at one time worked as her sister's personal secretary. In later years Marion worked for Abigail Van Buren, better known as \"Dear Abby.\" Bonnie, the youngest Lake daughter, was a singer and songwriter. She sang with her husband Jack Jenney's band, as well as that of Artie Shaw. Her compositions included \"Man with a Horn,\" \"St. Francis of Assisi,\" and \"Wild Card.\". She also wrote special material for her sister. Additionally, the Lakes had a half-sister, Sally. Harriette spent her childhood narrowly escaping serious injury in a series of accidents. She often recalled that she was run over by nearly every type of wheeled vehicle except a horse and buggy - and missed it only because they were obsolete. When she was about six years old, her nightgown caught on fire while she was playing with matches at her grandmother's house. According to Movie Mirror, Harriette's mother rolled her in a rug to extinguish the flames. It took months of skin grafts to repair the scars on young Harriette's arms, legs, and back (see B-473). Harriette was educated in public schools in Waterloo, Iowa, and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her mother gave her a firm musical background, often letting young Harriette accompany her on concert tours. Harriette and Marion sometimes performed a sister act on tour until they reached\n\n2\n\nAnn Sothern\n\nschool age. According to the Minneapolis Journal, Harriette studied piano with Sophie Skjerdtingstad-Dahl and Countess Moroztyn at the McPhail School of Music where her mother taught (B-200). Harriette showed early musical talent, mastering Beethoven and Brahms by age 11. At 13, her \"Study in B\" was performed by the Minneapolis Symphony (B-12). Backyard musicals earned Harriette her first fan letter from music critic E. Johann Egilsrud, houseguest of a neighbor. According to the Milwaukee Journal, Egilsrud not only praised her performance, but predicted a bright future for Harriette in the world of music and theatre (B193). By the time she graduated from Minneapolis's Central High School in 1926, Harriette had won a city-wide musical composition contest sponsored by the Minneapolis Journal for three consecutive years. According to the New York Herald Tribune, she represented her district at the National Music Supervisor's Conference in Detroit (B-320). The Lakes divorced in 1927. Annette moved to California where she worked as a vocal coach at Warner Bros. Walter moved his import/export business to Seattle. Harriette lived with her father while attending the University of Washington for one term during the 1928/29 academic year. In 1979 she told the Seattle Times that she was too young to enroll and therefore took only a few classes (B-182). A 1959 Coronet interview quoted her as saying, \"I got good marks in everything but math\" (B-226). Despite the fact that a 1935 issue of Movie Classic said she attended the University of Washington for three years, and other publications claim that she graduated, the University of Washington's records show Harriette enrolled for only one year (B-269). While visiting her mother in California in 1929, Harriette landed a role in the motion picture Show of Shows. She appeared in a musical sequence called \"Meet My Sister\" in which many real-life sisters sang and danced in costumes representing different countries. They included Loretta Young and Sally Blane, and Sally O'Neill and Molly O'Day. Harriette played Marion Byron's sister and wore an Italian costume. According to Movie Classic, it was studio worker Bill Koenig, a friend from Minneapolis, who was responsible for Harriette's first screen test (B-269). In addition to Show of Shows, she appeared in Hearts in Exile and Hold Everything at Warner Bros. Later MGM tested her and producer Paul Bern took her under his wing. She played a small role in Doughboys, falling off a motorcycle into a mud puddle. She also dubbed the bark for a dog in a Pete Smith short. Broadway Nights (1927) and Whoopee (1930) are sometimes listed in Harriette's early filmography, however most film historians do not include them in her credits. Harriette soon became frustrated with walk-on roles. She spent more time posing for publicity stills and appearing at special events than she did acting.\n\nBiography\n\n3\n\nAccording to the Minneapolis Journal, Florenz Ziegfeld was in Hollywood working on Whoopee, an Eddie Cantor film, when he met Harriette at a party. One of the guests urged her to perform for the great showman. Ziegfeld offered her a job in one of his Broadway productions, and Harriette readily accepted, forgetting about her MGM contract. The studio did not renew her option after six months and Harriette headed east to accept Ziegfeld's offer (B-347) . Harriette was cast in Smiles, a musical starring Marilyn Miller, and Fred and Adele Astaire. As Glory, third female lead, Harriette initially had three songs: \"Blue Bowery,\" \"More Than Ever,\" and \"Dance Wedding.\" She opened in Smiles at the Colonial Theatre in Boston on October 28, 1930. According to It Ain't Necessarily So, an autobiography by cast member Larry Adler, Harriette's \"Blue Bowery\" was a hit in Boston, causing some friction with the show's star. Adler said, \"Marilyn Miller told Ziegfeld that she wanted Miss Lake out and out she was\" (B-6). The show opened in New York on November 18, 1930 without Harriette. Within a few months Harriette made her Broadway debut in America's Sweetheart, a musical with songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. She introduced \"I've Got Five Dollars\" with leading man Jack Whiting. The show lasted 135 performances. According to Rodgers and Hart, Rodgers did not want Harriette in the show, but producer Laurence Schwab insisted that she get the role of Geraldine. Harriette recalled her work in the production. \"Actually, I can't speak with any authority about Rodgers and Hart because I was so young and under my mother's thumb. Everything was her decision...The only thing I can remember about the whole play is that in the first act they pushed me into a fountain, and I always had a wet fanny every night\" (B-278). Harriette starred in a musical version of Up Pops the Devil called Everybody's Welcome in late 1931. Her co-stars were Oscar Shaw, Ann Pennington, and the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra. The show ran 139 performances. According to music expert Ray Ridge, Harriette was engaged to musician/arranger Mickey Bloom during this time. Bloom played trumpet with the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra and was later a sideman with the orchestras of Rudy Vallee, Hal Kemp, and Tommy Dorsey. Ridge, a long-time friend of Bloom, blamed the musician's infidelity for his breakup with Harriette. Harriette and Oscar Shaw were reunited in 1932 for the national tour of Of Thee I Sing. The Pulitzer-Prizewinning musical opened in Detroit on September 12, 1932 and toured successfully for seven months. After the tour, Harriette went to Chicago to rest. Three weeks later, general manager Max Siegel asked Harriette to replace Lois Moran in the Broadway company of Of Thee I Sing. The Broadway engagement had been extended for an indefinite run, however a heat wave hit New York, forcing many theatres to close for the summer. Harriette's Broadway run in Of Thee\n\n4\n\nAnn Sothern\n\nI Sing lasted one week. After Of Thee I Sing, Harriette decided to give Hollywood another try. She appeared in a beach scene in Broadway Thru a Keyhole with another aspiring starlet, Lucille Ball. The two became friends and their career paths continued to cross for the next 30 years. Harriette also appeared in the \"Shanghai Lil\" production number in Footlight Parade in 1933. According to Motion Picture, Columbia executive Harry Cohn was searching for a Scandanavian actress for the lead in Let's Fall in Love (B-164). He had seen Harriette on stage and decided she would fit the role. However, Cohn insisted that she change her name. In a 1987 interview on American Movie Classics cable, the actress told how she was transformed from Harriette Lake to Ann Sothern. \"[Harry Cohn] said, 'Well, we can't have your name Lake because there are too many Lakes,'\" Ann recalled, citing Arthur Lake and Alice Lake as examples. \"He made out a list and he called me in,\" she continued. \"On the list there were a lot of names there. Having been a good student of Shakespeare and that sort of thing, E. H. Sothern's name was there. I admired him because he was a very fine Shakespearean actor, so I took Sothern. My mother's name was Annette, so I took Ann. And that's how I became Ann Sothern\" (T-56). In the same interview she stated that her real name had come from her father's best friend, Harry. Ann scored so well in her first featured role that she was immediatly signed to a long-term contract by Columbia. During her first fourteen months in Hollywood, she made nine films, many of which were on loan-out, including Kid Mil lions, Folies Bergere, and Bl^nd.._Date_. Ironically, she was cast in Eight Bells; she had performed a scene from the play for her screen test. Ann soon tired of her ingenue roles at Columbia. \"I didn't appear in B or C pictures - I was in Z pictures,\" she recalled in a 1946 Movie Show interview (B-212). Unlike many young actresses who wanted glamorous roles and pretty wardrobes, Ann preferred parts with substance. In 1935 she told Motion Picture, \"...character parts are what I want to play most of all. I'd trade a 'pretty girl' role any day in the week for that of an old hag, if the hag was a real character\" (B-164). According to Filmograph, Ann asked Frank Capra to let her read for the role of the prostitute in Lost Horizon. \"He just laughed and said I was too young and pretty,\" Ann recalled (B-80). She asked for her release and moved to RKO in 1936. During this period, Ann went through a variety of stages, trying to find the right look for the screen. She told Movie Mirror, \"It wasn't until I had gone through an almost grotesque series of experiments on arching and straightening my eye brows, enlarging my mouth line, changing my hair from yellow-blonde to reddish-blonde to almost dark again that I realized the happy medium 'honey blonde' was the correct color and line for me!\" (B-225).\n\nBiography\n\n5\n\nAlthough her appearance was changing, her roles were not. Ann had hoped RKO would give her more fulfilling parts. Instead, she found herself teamed with Gene Raymond in a series of low-budget romantic comedies. Columbia had first loaned Ann to RKO in 1935 for Hooray for Love with Raymond. With the pair under contract in 1936, RKO reteamed them in four pictures: Walking on Air, Smartest Girl in Town, There Goes My Girl, and She's Got Everything. RKO also loaned out Ann's services for a series of less-than-stellar films. Ann was growing more dissatisfied. When RKO wanted to cast her in a small role in Joy of Living, Ann finally asked to be released from her contract. RKO conceded in 1937. Ann took a year off from films, waiting for a quality script. She spent the time reorganizing her personal life and following her husband, Roger Pryor, a bandleader and actor whom she had married in 1936. Born in 1901, Roger was the son of Arthur Pryor, a renowned orchestra leader. Roger acted on stage and sporadically led an orchestra of his own. In 1928 he married Priscilla Mitchell. They had a daughter around 1931. In 1933 Roger left his family in New Jersey to pursue a movie career. Priscilla took up residence in Reno in 1934 in order to divorce him. However, she left before the six-week waiting period was over. Ann first met Roger in Chicago in 1932 while she was starring in Of Thee I Sing and he was appearing in Blessed Event. They met again in Hollywood when they co-starred in the film The Girl Friend in 1935. According to Screen Guide, Ann and Roger rekindled their romance in Hollywood, although he was only separated from his wife (B-312). Priscilla Pryor finally went through with divorce proceedings in 1936 and married again the day after receiving her decree. By this time, Roger had gone on the road with his band. He returned to California as Ann was finishing Smartest Girl in Town and told her he had signed a year's contract for his band at the College Inn in Chicago. Despite the known separation, Ann and Roger decided to get married immediatly. However, they forgot the mandatory three-day notice period. \"Even when they remembered, they supposed that filing the intention to wed on Wednesday would allow them to marry on Saturday,\" Screen Guide reported. \"And such would be the case - except the first day doesn't count\" (B-312). With Roger due in Chicago for a band rehearsal, the only alternative to postponing the wedding was to marry after midnight. After four years of waiting, Ann and Roger were married at one minute after midnight on September 27, 1936 at the Hollywood Congregational Church. The ceremony was performed by the Reverend J. Hamilton Lash. Despite the fact that it was her first marriage, Ann wore a metallic blue gown designed by Irene because Roger had an aversion to brides in white. The Pryors spent their honeymoon in Chicago where Roger's band was playing. Ann made a personal appearance at\n\n6\n\nAnn Sothern\n\nthe Palace Theatre during the week of October 16, reminding audiences that she began her career as a singer. After the working honeymoon, Ann returned to her studio obligations. The movie magazines had a field day reporting on her long distance marriage. In 1937 Ann told Photoplay, \"...we married not to risk our love, but to save it. This way, we are continually working toward something, rather than away from it and everything we do is in anticipation of the few hours or days or weeks we can be together\" (B-128). After Ann was released from her RKO contract, she held out for a role with substance. She traveled with Roger, often appearing with his band. In November, 1937, Roger was appearing at the Baker Hotel in Dallas. Ann came to visit him for Thanksgiving. While in Dallas, she befriended David Hobbs, a ten-year-old newsboy. David came from a large, poor family. Ann convinced his parents to allow him to go to California to live with her, hoping she could eventually adopt him. David resided with Ann and Roger for two years. During that time, Ann had his teeth straightened, gave him piano lessons, and provided a fine education. Despite the luxuries, David missed his family. When his parents visited Beverly Hills, David begged to join them on the central California ranch where his father was working. He left the Pryor home to live in a tent with his 11 siblings. According to the New York Herald Tribune, David said, \"[Ann and Roger] were swell to me...but I just wanted to be home\" (B-7). Waiting for a quality role proved to be the boost Ann's career needed. However, when producer Walter Wanger offered her a character part in Trade Winds, she was cautious. She told Motion Picture in 1940, \"...I was so bent on making the right start again that I hesitated two weeks before signing for the role\" (B-268). Although the film starred Joan Bennett and Fredric March, Ann was praised by the critics as a new discovery. She was offered a role in East Side of Heaven opposite Bing Crosby, but had to turn it down because she was under contract to Roger Pryor for a series of personal appearances. Instead, the role went to Joan Blondell, an actress whom many thought resembled Ann. Ann's next offer arrived at a more opportune time and it altered her career for the next 13 years. Producer J. Walter Ruben noticed Ann's superior work in Trade Winds and offered her the title role in MGM's Maisie. Maisie Ravier was a brassy Brooklyn showgirl who became involved in a series of adventures as she drifted from job to job. Based on the stories by Wilson Collison, the film had originally been intended as a vehicle for Jean Harlow. The script had been shelved after her death in 1937 because the studio could not find a suitable replacement. Ann's work in Trade Winds reminded Ruben of her sassiness in Folies Bergere. Ruben thought Ann would be the perfect Maisie. Despite the fact that Maisie was intended as a 'B' picture, Ruben had difficulty convincing the MGM executives\n\nBiography\n\n7\n\nthat Ann was right for the role. When the film was released in 1939, it grossed more than three times its cost. MGM chief Louis B. Mayer insisted on signing Ann to a contract, guaranteeing a series of Maisie adventures. During the next thirteen years, Ann made nine more Maisie films and starred in two radio series based on the character. Ann also made Hotel for Women in 1939 for 20th Century-Fox. Her role was originally that of co-star with Linda Darnell, but the studio pared down Ann's part after the successful release of Maisie. They did not want to build up the career of an actress who had signed with a rival studio. Under her MGM contract, Ann made at least one Maisie feature a year. Although she often felt typecast, Ann used the Maisie film series as leverage to do pictures of her choice. She told Filmograph, \"Every Maisie film cost under $500,000 and made two to three times that back. Sure, I felt she was a millstone around my neck at times. I'd tell Mr. Mayer to give me a musical and I'd do another Maisie. We'd bargain in that way\" (B-80). In addition to her Maisie commitments, Ann played a variety of roles on screen and radio. She was cast as a series of dumb blondes in Joe and Ethel Turp Call on the President, Brother Orchid (on loan-out to Warner Bros.), and Dulcy. She returned to her musical roots in Lady Be Good and Panama Hattie. An emergency appendectomy on January 15, 1940 cost her the second lead in Waterloo Bridge, but she did a dramatic turn in Cry Havoc in 1943. Time announced Ann would also star in Du Barry Was a Lady, Come and Get It with Clark Gable, and an unnamed film with Spencer Tracy, however none of the projects materialized with Ann as the star (\"The New Pictures.\" Time. August 18, 1941.) Fred Stanley said she was also mentioned for The Female of the Species, a film loosely based on the career of pioneer newswoman Nellie Bly (\"Hollywood Turns to Inspirationsl Films.\" New York Times. December 19, 1943.). During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Ann made several appearances on radio anthologies like Lux Radio Theatre, Silver Theatre, and Screen Guild Theatre, which was hosted by Roger Pryor. Despite the diversity of her roles, the public identified her only as Maisie. MGM was proud to publicize the fact that fans demanded Ann sign her autograph as Maisie and that fan letters came addressed simply \"Maisie, U.S.A.\" Despite Ann's success on screen, her private life was less than idyllic. On July 7, 1939, Roger filed for bankruptcy. A smoldering cigarette destroyed the guest room Ann was decorating for Roger's daughter. In 1941, $7,000 worth of jewelry was stolen from Ann's home. That September, Ann and Roger announced a trial separation. Ann filed for divorce on April 14, 1942, on the grounds of \"great and grievous cruelty.\" She received her interlocutory decree on May 8, after telling Judge Harry R.\n\n8\n\nAnn Sothern\n\nArchbald that Roger's insistence on flying constituted cruelty. She said, \"[Roger] took up flying three years ago. I am terribly frightened by airplanes and begged him not to fly....Sometimes he would go away in his plane and I wouldn't know where he was for a week at a time\" (B-138). The decree became final on May 17, 1943. Six days later, Ann married Robert Sterling. Roger later gave up his acting career and turned to advertising. Despite their divorce, Ann and Roger remained friends until his death on January 31, 1974 at the age of 72. Ann met Bob Sterling while they were co-starring in Ringside Maisie in 1941. Born William John Hart on November 11, 1917, he was the son of baseball player Walter S. Hart. As Robert Sterling, he made his film debut in 1939. Like Ann, he was under contract to MGM where he played a series of handsome-but-unchallenging leading man roles. During her separation from Roger, Ann ran into Bob while she was visiting his neighbor, Hedy Lamarr. They began dating, starting months of speculation in the fan magazines about the possibility of marriage. Bob enlisted in the Army Air Corp in 1942 and was stationed at Thunderbird Field in Phoenix. He and Ann decided to marry after her divorce was final and he finished his primary training. An emergency appendectomy gave Bob an unexpected two weeks leave. Since he did not know when he would get home again, Bob and Ann decided to marry immediatly at the Ventura Community Church. The trip to Ventura sounded like the adventures of Maisie; Ann lost her ring and Bob forgot the marriage license. Despite the false starts, they were married May 23, 1943 by the Reverend Theodore Henderson. Ann wore a navy suit and fuschia gloves. Agent Henry Willson was best man; Ann's best friend, Muriel \"Mai\" Milland, was matron of honor. Mai's husband, actor Ray Mi 11 and, could not attend the wedding because he was home preparing punch for the Sterlings's reception. The honeymoon was brief, as Ann was in the midst of shooting Cry Havoc. During World War II, Ann showed her patriotism by touring camps and hospitals, as well as appearing at the Hollywood Canteen. She was so popular with the enlisted men that one wartime air unit named its plane \"Sothern Comfort\" in her honor. At MGM she did her part by appearing in the studio's wartime spectacular Thousands Cheer. Ann, Lucille Ball, and Marsha Hunt played prospective WAVEs in a comedy sketch with Frank Morgan. Ann also appeared in an eight-minute film short for the Department of War Information entitled You, John Jones. Ann had to turn down a role in The Harvey Girls because she was pregnant. The role went to Angela Lansbury, and Patricia Ann Sterling was born December 10, 1944. Ann was sure the baby was a boy and planned to name him Timothy Hart Sterling. Certain of a girl, Bob chose the name Patricia Ann. The Sterlings gave their daughter the\n\nBiography\n\n9\n\nnickname Tisha because they felt Pat did not suit her personality. Her godparents were director Walter Lang and Mai Milland. Ann was not content with one child. In 1945 she told Louella Parsons that she planned to retire in a few years to be a full-time wife and mother (B-339). Although Ann did not have any more children, she was active in the Foster Parents Program. In 1949 she sponsored a Greek war orphan and encouraged other film personalities, as well as her fans, to help the cause. In 1946, Ann and Bob separated. Louella Parsons insisted it was just a trial parting; like many wartime marriages, the Sterlings had to adjust when Bob was discharged (B-341). They separated again in November, 1947. Ann received an interlocutory decree of divorce on January 2, 1948, claiming Bob had caused her \"grievous mental suffering.\" The divorce became final on March 8, 1949. According to the New York Times, Bob agreed to pay $200.00 a month child support (B-31). Many hinted that it was Ann's successful career and the seven-year age difference that led to the marriage's demise. Bob married actress Anne Jeffreys in 1951 and had three sons. Despite success on television in Topper with his second wife, he left acting and went into the computer business. Ann's MGM contract was not renewed in 1947. She freelanced, making April Showers for Warner Bros., The Judge Steps Out for RKO, and A Letter to Three Wives for 20th Century-Fox. The latter, which won Academy Awards for Joseph Mankiewicz's script and direction, was Ann's most acclaimed film. She played a radio writer whose salary was larger than her English teacher husband's. She returned to MGM for a bit in Words and Music, and leads in Nancy Goes to Rio and Shadow on the Wall. During a 1949 trip to England for a Command Performance of That Forsyte Woman, Ann received an impure serum shot which gave her infectious hepatitis and kept her off the screen for three years. Forced to stay in bed, Ann's only work during this time were her Maisie radio broadcasts which were recorded in her home. At times, her eyes were so sensitive to light that the room had to be blackened. Ann credited her illness with helping to restore her faith. In 1952 she converted to Catholicism with the help of her friend Richard Egan. They were rumored to be engaged, but Ann refused to marry the devout Catholic because she had been divorced (B-463). After Ann recovered, she set about proving that she had the strength to work again. She starred on stage in the comedy Faithfully Yours with Robert Cummings in 1951. During the pre-Broadway tryouts, there was a disagreement about billing. Producer Richard Krakeur had promised both stars top billing, an impossibility in both print advertising and the marquee. Ann and Cummings agreed to alternate positions in newspaper ads and split the other promotional material equally. The play lasted only 68 performances on Broadway.\n\n10\n\nAnn Sothern\n\nReturning to California, Ann appeared in The Blue Gardenia, her first film in three years. Critics welcomed her back, claiming audiences broke into applause when she appeared on screen. Despite the warm reception, Ann's role was one of support. She decided to concentrate on the new medium of television. Ann made her television debut on The Fred Waring Show on December 16, 1951. It was followed soon after by a dramatic role in \"Lady with a Will\" on Schlitz Playhouse of Stars in 1952. She appeared on Hollywood Opening Night later that year in \"Let George Do It.\" Her performances led to several series offers; Ann finally settled on Private Secretary. The show debuted on CBS on February 1, 1953. Sponsored by Lucky Strike, Private Secretary alternated its Sunday evening spot with The Jack Benny Show. During the first two seasons, Private Secretary was rerun on NBC during the summers under the title Susie. When the series went into syndication, it kept the title Susie. Ann starred as Susan Camille MacNamara, secretary to talent agent Peter Sands. She liked the elastic format that the agency allowed, making it natural for her to go hunting for talent, and for famous guest stars to appear. Despite Ann's protests, Susie was often compared to Maisie. Although Ann admitted both had a penchant for playing \"Miss Fix-it,\" she insisted Susie was better dressed and better educated than her predecessor. Susie proved to be so popular with the nation's secretaries that Ann was named \"Favorite Private Secretary of the Year\" by the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Secretaries Association in 1954. She was awarded a bronze shorthand book. Ironically, the favorite secretary did not know how to type. Ann told TV Guide that she had to remove most of the typewriter's works in order to keep the keys from jamming while she typed on the show (B-391). The series's popularity was not limited to secretaries. Fashion tie-ins allowed all women to dress like Susie. In 1954, three Private Secretary franchises were announced: Kay Windsor Frocks, manufacturer of popular priced dresses, Ernest Donath of Boston, producer of skirts and sportswear, and Flairspecs, an optical frame specialist who promised to produce a Private Secretary style of the month. Ann's use of different frames to express Susie's mood made wearing glasses chic. During the run of Private Secretary, Ann made several appearances which showed her new legion of fans that she could sing and dance. Ann starred in a nightclub act in Reno, Las Vegas, and Chicago during the summer of 1954. She displayed her musical and comic talents in a series of numbers, including take-offs on Susie and Maisie. That fall she starred in the television adaptation of the musical Lady in the Dark on NBC. Produced by Max Liebman as his second color spectacular, most critics praised Ann's performance, as well as the show's use of color. During the mid 1950s she made appearances on The Milton Berle Show\n\nBiography\n\n11\n\nand The Red Skelton Show, as well as substituting for an ailing Loretta Young as the hostess of her program. During Private Secretary's fifth season, producer Jack Chertok sold the rights to the series to Television Programs of America (TPA). Ann's five-year contract with Chertok stipulated that she owned 25% of the series for the first three years and 42% for the fourth year. Since she felt TPA had purchased a hit property, Ann wanted a new deal negotiated on her fifth-year option. Although she praised TPA's distribution of Private Secretary reruns, she refused to film any additional episodes until a settlement was reached. Variety reported Ann wanted to produce the series herself under the new agreement (B-59). Although she was involved in a $93,000 lawsuit over the distribution of profits with Chertok, she said she would not mind if he were named producer. She told Variety, \"He's done a very creditable job....All he needs is a new accounting department\" (B-59). June Allyson and Penny Singleton were rumored to take Ann's place on Private Secretary for TPA, but the show ended its original run on March 17, 1957 with Ann's 104th episode. While settling her differences with Chertok and TPA out of court, Ann made a series of guest appearances, including variety shows like Washington Square, The Steve Allen Show, and The Perry Como Show. She hosted the musical special Holiday in Las Vegas and recreated her Susie MacNamara role on The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show. Ann's interests were not limited to her acting career. In 1953 she formed Vincent Productions, named for her patron saint, to handle financial matters for Private Secretary, and to manage the careers of two discoveries, Ginny Saturday and Tony Ramo. She started the A-Bar-S Cattle Ranch in 1953 as a recreation for her retired father and ended up selling over 1,200 head of cattle. In 1956 she opened the Ann Sothern Sewing Center in Sun Valley, Idaho. While visiting her home in Sun Valley, Ann decided she wanted to sew but could not find a shop that carried patterns and materials. She opened her own shop a few weeks later. Ann formed the A-Bar-S Music Company while she was looking for songs to record for her Sothern Exposure album in 1958. She liked a new song by Ian Bernard called \"Another Year,\" but could not include it unless it had a publisher. When Ann learned that publishers earn royalties on performances and sheet music, she entered the music publishing business. In 1958 Ann formed Anso Productions to handle her new series, The Ann Sothern Show. Originally titled Career Girl, The Ann Sothern Show cast Ann as Katy O'Connor, the assistant manager of a luxurious New York hotel. In addition to her role as Katy, Ann produced the series with Desi Arnaz, and wrote the theme song with her sister, Bonnie. Like Private Secretary, The Ann Sothern Show had a format which allowed famous guest stars to appear as themselves. And like Susie, Katy was an independent, single woman who had a penchant for\n\n12\n\nAnn Sothern\n\ninterfering. Even the cast was familiar. Ann Tyrrell, who played switchboard operator Violet Praskins on Private Secretary, joined The Ann Sothern Show as Olive Smith, Katy's secretary and roommate. As time passed, the second series began to resemble the first more closely. Katy's boss, Ernest Truex, was replaced during the middle of the first season by Don Porter as James Devery, the new hotel manager. At the end of the second season, Jesse White joined the cast as Oscar Pudney, a character not unlike his Cagey Calhoun role on Private Secretary. Gladys Hurlbut, a frequent guest star on Private Secretary, had a recurring role on The Ann Sothern Show as Olive's future mother-in-law. Redecoration of Mr. Devery's office made it look like the office of Susie's boss, Peter Sands. The Ann Sothern Show was successful until it was scheduled opposite The Untouchables. It went off the air in 1961 with Mr. Devery proposing to Katy on the last episode. Ann and Don Porter's cat-and-mouse chemistry was part of the reason for its popularity. The last episode was both delightful and frustrating to the show's fans. According to Don Porter, they purposely ended the series without a wedding, leaving it open for the series to return with Katy and Mr. Devery still playing games. After the cancellation of The Ann Sothern Show, Ann moved to New York so Tisha could attend several finishing schools. Ann spoke of starting a business to merchandise cuffs and collars, as well as a fashion business with designer Moss Mabry. Ann also talked about producing a television series. Instead, she attended Stella Adler's acting class, hoping to broaden her background to get more dramatic parts. She had previously studied with drama coach Phyllis Laughton during the 1930s. In 1959 Ann filed a protest against a government claim that she owed $722,322.44 in income taxes from 1953-56. The taxes represented her profits from the sale of Private Secretary and losses she claimed from her cattle ranch. The case was settled in 1960 with Ann paying $99,000. She was later given the Treasury Department Award. Ann had further legal troubles when her mother sued her for support in 1961. Annette Yde-Lake, 76 and suffering from advanced arteriosclerosis, demanded that Ann pay her $500 medical bills and $1,200 in monthly support. Ann insisted that she had been the sole support of her mother for years. Ann refused to continue that support when Annette left the hospital to move in with her daughter, Bonnie, and Bonnie tried to become Annette's guardian. When Ann petitioned to become her mother's guardian, Annette objected that Ann had a conflict of interest since Ann was involved in the support suit. Annette also objected to her daughter, Marion, being named guardian since Marion worked for Ann. Annette eventually dropped the support suit and Marion was named her guardian. Annette died December 12, 1962.\n\nBiography\n\n13\n\nIn September, 1962, Ann filmed a pilot for a series called Atta Boy, Mama. Aimed at the 1963-64 season, the pilot cast Ann as the widow of a small-town mayor. The pilot was written by Mac Benoff and directed by Ida Lupino. It was produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman in association with NBC at Metro studios. When the series could not find a sponsor, Ann decided to return to the stage. When Atta Boy, Mama was first mentioned in July, 1962, Ann was already looking toward a Broadway comeback. God Bless Our Bank, a Theatre Guild production, was scheduled to open in November, 1962 after a three-city try-out. With a script by Mac Benoff, a Goodson and Todman producer and the creator of Atta Boy, Mama, God Bless Our Bank promised to bring Ann back to the stage in triumph. The show was postponed until the summer of 1963 when Ann starred in a seven-week tour, now produced by Zev Bufman and Stan Seiden. Director Abe Burrows viewed the play in Westport to examine its Broadway possibilities. According to the New York Times, Ann agreed to star in the Broadway production if she liked the revisions made by Benoff and Burrows (B-476). Co-star Jeff Corey surmised that audiences did not really enjoy the play, despite their laughter at the one-liners. The play never opened in New York; Ann returned to the movies. Ann fulfilled her desire to be cast in character parts with her 1960s film roles. In Lady in a Cage she played an aging prostitute. She told Filmograph that a debate over the film's sadism ruined her chances of receiving an Oscar nomination, however she was recognized by the Foreign Press Association with a Golden Globe nomination for her role (B-80). Ann was cast as a bossy political chairwoman in The Best Man and a blowsy arcade cashier in Sylvia. Ann's most unusual role came about in 1965 when she was cast as the title character on the NBC series My Mother the Car. Often cited as one of the worst shows in television history, My Mother the Car was about a lawyer who discovers his mother has been reincarnated as a 1928 Porter. The Porter was really an antique fliver with the license plate PZR 317. Producer Rod Amateau, a director of The Ann Sothern Show, said the car was named after Don Porter, Ann's co-star on her other successful series. My Mother the Car lasted one season. Don Porter faired just as poorly with Gidget, his entry in the 1965-66 TV season. Despite introducing Sally Field to a generation of TV viewers, Gidget produced only thirty-two episodes, two more than My Mother the Car. Although Ann later regretted doing My Mother the Car, she was realistic about her motives in 1965. When the Columbus Citizen-Journal asked why she accepted the role of a talking car, she cited two reasons. \"One, I like to make and spend money. I couldn't think of an easier way to make some,\" she said. \"Two, I enjoy character roles and have no make-up problems, no hairdresser woes, or camera\n\n14\n\nAnn Sothern\n\nangles to worry about. It's like acting on radio for a TV star's pay\" (B-366). Ann never saw any of the other actors. She recorded her scenes in a booth, several episodes at a time. While working on My Mother the Car, Ann was faced with a more fulfilling acting assignment. Lucille Ball asked her to make several guest appearances on The Lucy Show. Ann played Lucy's old friend, Rosie Harrigan, now a destitute countess. Ann and Lucy's friendship dated back to their work as girls on the beach in Broadway Thru a Keyhole. They were under contract to RKO and MGM together. While Ann was starring in The Ann Sothern Show, she told several reporters, \"Lucy used to complain she got all the parts I turned down. Now I produce the show and she owns the studio. I guess that settles that.\" Despite Ann and Lucy's chemistry and friendship, Ann did not want to be tied down to another series so she did not become a regular on The Lucy Show. The seven episodes were the last time the comediennes worked together. In 1966 Ann announced she would make a pilot for Desi Arnaz's new production company. The situation comedy was to be written by I Love Lucy's Madelyn Davis and Bob Carroll, Jr. According to Davis, Ann changed her mind about the pilot, which became the series The Mothers-in-law with Eve Arden and Kaye Ballard. Meanwhile, Tisha was carving out a career of her own. She made her television debut on an episode of The Ann Sothern Show in 1960. During the late 1960s she was part of Universal Studio's training program for young actors. Her work included guest appearances on The Donna Reed Show, Get Smart, and Batman, as well as many telefilms. Her greatest acclaim came from the features Norwood and Coogan's Bluff. But Ann was most proud when Tisha made her debut at the International Debutante Ball at New York's Astor Hotel in 1962. Tisha married actor and realtor Lai Baum in Las Vegas on July 24, 1966. Although Ann claimed she approved of the marriage, she did not attend the ceremony because she was working. The Baums had a daughter, Heidi, and were later divorced. Although Ann had told many reporters that she was anxious for Tisha to marry and give her grandchildren, Tisha told TV Guide that Ann did not let Heidi call her grandmother (\"An Only Child Grows Up.\" TV Guide. June 22, 1968.). Through the years, Ann juggled TV assignments with theatre roles. In addition to such diverse series as The Legend of Jesse James, Family Affair, and Love American Style, Ann toured in many plays. She was reunited with Jesse White in a 1965 summer production of The Solid Gold Cadillac. According to Films in Review, the director of The Glass Menagerie called Ann \"the best Amanda ever\" (B-99). Although she turned down the role of Mame on Broadway, Ann starred in the musical in Hawaii to much acclaim.\n\nBiography\n\n15\n\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ann's film roles were diverse. On television, she was an over-protective mother in Congratulations, It's a Boy!, an old maid aunt in The Great Man's Whiskers, and a sympathetic Mother Superior in The Weekend Nun. In 1971 she got the opportunity to work with her daughter, Tisha, in the telefilm A Death of Innocence. Ann was called in to replace Kim Stanley on one day's notice when the actress broke her ankle. Ann played a drunken mother and won praise for a dramatic scene with co-star Shelley Winters. Critics also admired Ann's performance as a rapist's mother in the 1973 theatrical release The Killing Kind. Its limited release prevented Ann from being considered for an Oscar nomination. In 1973 Ann was appearing at the Thunderbird Dinner Theatre in Jacksonville, Florida when an accident occurred which would alter the rest of her career. During the opening night performance of Everybody Loves Opal, a piece of scenery fell on Ann, fracturing a lumbar vertebra and shattering the nerves in her legs. She finished the show and the play's run, despite her pain. In 1975 she sued the then-bankrupt Thunderbird Dinner Theatre. Ann was awarded $200,000 in 1977, but has been plagued with pain ever since the accident. Despite the fact that doctors told her she would never walk again, Ann maneuvers with the help of a cane, although she and has no feeling in her feet. In addition to her own health problems, Ann was worried about Tisha. After Tisha had a mole removed from her neck in 1976, skin cancer was discovered. According to the Chicago Tribune, a melanoma specialist from the University of California operated and a plastic surgeon repaired the damage (B-474). Completely recovered, Tisha resumed her acting career. Ann said, \"We are what are known as survivors. Between my back and her cancer, we've learned that you can surmount just about anything\" (B-474). Since the accident, Ann has been select in chosing her film roles. She told Filmograph that she accepted the part of a mahjong parlor hostess in The Golden Needles in order to see her friend Burgess Meredith and to receive a trip to Hong Kong (B-80). Crazy Mama allowed Ann to work with Tisha again; Tisha played her mother's character as a young woman in a flashback sequence. Ann turned down appearances on The Love Boat and Fantasy Island, as well as a role in a film about a grandmother who urges her daughter into prostitution. A television remake of A Letter to Three Wives cast Ann as Ma Finney, the supporting role originally played by Connie Gilchrist. According to the New York Times, the producer of the telefilm thought it would be a great marketing ploy to get one of the original stars for his remake (B-196). In 1987 Ann told the Idaho Statesman that she was also offered the role of the maid, created by Thelma Ritter. She claimed she told the producer, \"I'll have to take the mother 'cause I can't carry a bloody tray\"\n\n16\n\nAnn Sothern\n\n(B-417). A Letter to Three Wives marked the beginning of a resurgence in Ann's career. On January 5, 1987 the cable television station Nickelodeon began reruning The Ann Sothern Show in its \"Nick at Nite\" lineup. The station catered to baby-boomers with its nostalgic, seldom-seen series like The Donna Reed Show and My Three Sons. This was the first time Ann's shows had been aired with any regularity in most parts of the country for many years. During the 1960s, Ann's series were syndicated by Metromedia Producers Corp., but the shows had not been distributed widely. In 1986, 20th Century-Fox Television acquired The Ann Sothern Show and Private Secretary/Susie, and licensed them to Nickelodeon. After The Ann Sothern Show had finished its initial run, Nickelodeon aired Susie. Since then, the series have been alternating, bringing Ann a new generation of fans who are too young to remember the shows's original runs. Director Lindsay Anderson saw Ann in the remake of A Letter to' Three Wives in 1985 and thought of her for his theatrical film, The Whales of August. Producer Mike Kaplan was hesitant to offer her the part because of her immobility, but he said he and Anderson \"devised various ways of shooting the sequences so that it would be of no great concern.\" Kaplan recalled, \"She said, 'I can do anything except run' - and she can!\" Ann thought it was fate that she take the part since the character's name was Tisha. Shot off the coast of Maine in 1986, The Whales of August brought together screen legends Bette Davis, Lillian Gish, and Vincent Price. Tisha Sterling played her mother's character in a flashback sequence. Despite a clash of egos between Gish and Davis, Ann refused to get caught in the middle. Lindsay Anderson credited Ann with lessening the tension. He told People Weekly, \"When Ann appeared on the set, the whole atmosphere lightened up. She brought her own poker chips and played cards with the crew\" (B-415). Mike Kaplan recalled that Ann and Anderson, a film buff who had been charmed by Ann's performances in Lady Be Good and Words and Music, would often sing together on the set. Ann's work in The Whales of August earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress in 1988. Although she lost to Olympia Dukakis, Ann received some of the best reviews of her career. Even critics who did not like the film praised Ann's characterization of the nosey neighbor. On March 4, 1988, Ann was honored at the Santa Barbara Film Festival with a retrospective of her career. The tribute included a showing of the original A Letter to Three Wives, as well as clips from her film and TV work. In attendance were Mike Kaplan, Mary Steenburgen, Malcolm McDowell, Leonard Maltin, and designer Jean-Louis, as well as Ann's granddaughter, Heidi, and her sister, Marion. Despite the acclaim brought by The Whales of August and her Oscar nomination, Ann has been plagued by personal\n\nBiography\n\n17\n\ntragedy. She told People Weekly that 1987 was the worst year of her life (B-415). In May, Ann underwent abdominal surgery for a blocked intestine. On August 11, her granddaughter's husband, Mark Bates, was killed in a motorcycle accident. Heidi and Mark had been married in April, 1986. Ann gave the eulogy at his funeral. She told the Hollywood Reporter, \"You have to look for something positive out of a terrible thing like this. At least through his death, three other lives will be saved. They were able to donate Mark's kidneys and liver to the UCLA Medical Center to help someone else\" (B-324). Heidi's father, Lai Baum, died of cancer just 21 days before. Ann has lost many friends in recent years, including Ray Milland and Richard Egan. According to Colin Briggs, the 1988 death of her sister, Marion, was a terrible shock. Since October, 1984, Ann has lived in Ketchum, Idaho. She first went to Sun Valley in 1948, and fell in love with the area and its people. Through the years, she spent her vacations in Idaho and her working months in a series of homes which included a 17-room Bel Air mansion, a suite at New York's Hotel Plaza, and a Beverly Hills townhouse. Ann told the Idaho Mountain Express that she returned to Ketchum because the area had not changed in almost 40 years (B-126). Tisha also settled nearby. Ann quickly became a part of the community, paying for the decoration of a room at Moritz Hospital, and donating books and her script from The Whales of August to the Ketchum Community Library. She told the Idaho Statesman that she wanted to help create a theatre in Ketchum. She also planned to teach seminars on dramatics at a nearby college, as she had at Jacksonville University in 1974 (B-417). For a while in 1988, Ann was rumored to be in the running for the film version of Driving Miss Daisy, but the role went to Jessica Tandy. Ann has continued her interest in composition. In addition to \"Katy,\" the theme for The Ann Sothern Show, she composed \"Thanks for Everything,\" \"Chicken Cacciatore,\" and other songs for her series. In December, 1987, her granddaughter, Heidi, recorded two of Ann's compositions, \"Peace and Love\" and \"Children All Are We.\" According to Ginger Piotter of the Ketchum Community Library, the demonstration records were not released. Ann's interest in art began in the 1930s when she studied painting and drawing at Choinard's School in Los Angeles. During the 1950s Ann studied painting in Idaho with Robert Peter Max. A rumored 1989 art show was to benefit a Sun Valley charity. Talk of an autobiography or an inspirational book has been going on since the mid 1970s, with George Eel Is and David Chandler mentioned as collaborators. In 1989 USA Weekend reported that Ann had turned down offers from several publishers because they wanted a book full of scandal (B-137). When asked about their association with Ann, her colleagues had nothing but praise for her professionalism\n\n18\n\nAnn Sothern\n\nand generosity. Jesse White recalled her eagerness to share the laughs with her co-stars. Unlike other performers who wanted to be the star of their shows, Ann let her supporting cast shine. According to People Weekly, Jack Wrangler recalled appearing with Ann in Glad Tidings during a Chicago blizzard in 1968. When only 25 people showed up, Ann cancelled the performance, and took the audience and cast to dinner (B-415). Pat Carroll mentioned Ann's generosity in sharing her knowledge of the technical aspects of the profession. Carroll said, \"One day, while shooting the pilot 'Pandora and Friends,' she was discussing readjustment of some light with the lighting director. I asked her how she knew all that -- her answer? 'After 40 years in the industry, if you DON'T know, you're in trouble!'\" Colleagues also praised Ann's talent and personality. Marsha Hunt said, \"I admired her talent for comedy immensely, I felt that her lovely singing voice was under-rated, and thought her one of the most beautiful women I'd ever seen.\" She added, \"[Ann] struck me as the thorough professional, well prepared for the day's scenes, and she had a relaxed manner on the set...and a good sense of humor.\" Anita Mykowsky, secretary to Red Skelton, said that her boss confessed he had a secret crush on Ann during their years at MGM. Jeff Corey also admitted he had a high school crush long before he co-starred with Ann on stage and screen. He is still a fan, as well as a friend. He said, \"When I see those amazing black and white reruns and watch her work, I find she invariably delights me. She loves to perform. She was a part of that amazing generation of stars - they had a sense of who they were.\" Don Fedderson, producer of Family Affair, and Carl Reiner, both called Ann one of their favorite actresses. Mike Kaplan called Ann \"a consumate actress\" and \"a thorough professional.\" He recalled the joy and exuberance she brought to the shooting of The Whales of August and longed to work with her again. The most fitting tribute came from Don Porter, a testament to Ann's professionalism and personality. He said his chemistry with Ann was the result of similar styles and approaches, as well as a mutual respect. He added, \"I guess the pay off on the chemistry was that we remain friends after working together for seven years - many don't.\"\n\nHarriette Lake and her sister, Marion, circa 1914.

An exhibitor is impressed by the production numbers, too elaborate for any real stage: \"Honeymoon Hotel,\" \"By a Waterfall,\" and \"Shanghai Lil.\" Chester wins a contract to produce prologues for a large theatre chain and realizes his romantic feelings for his loyal secretary, Nan. REVIEWS: New York Times, 10.7.33: \"The stars that hang high over Shanghai, lighting James Cagney's sultry search for Shanghai Lil, also reveal one more side of his astonishing versatility. For Mr. Cagney, who used to be a gentleman of the ensemble himself, has not forgotten all he learned in the chorus...His song-and-dance number in the closing minutes...is almost the solo compensation for a dull and turgid musical film.\"\n\n40\n\nAnn Sothern\n\nVariety, 10.10.33: \"Then the wow finish with the three flash units as the Greek exhibitor reviews the tabs which mean a route, or else.

Jerry returns to his family. REVIEWS: New York Times, 3.2.36: \"The angular and somewhat Lombroso features of Bruce Cabot have a perverse charm when lit with the glow of fatherly pride, and those of Miss Sothern would be acceptable in any given situation, even\n\nFilmography\n\n51\n\none involving maternity.\" Variety, 3.4.36: \"Ann Sothern and Bruce Cabot are well enough cast and turn in steady performances, but they aren't more than moderate lure at the ticket windows.
