I was sitting on the redwood deck at my mother’s house in La Jolla, California, and her companion of many years, Bob Lurie, was talking with me about my current teaching and research interests. An adman by profession, Bob had a keen understanding of film, particularly of the glory days of Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s, when he’d lived in Los Angeles, having moved there from New York to attend UCLA on the GI Bill. I happened to mention to Bob that a director who really intrigued me, whose films I had taught in several of my courses, was one of Hollywood’s European transplants, a lesser-known figure among the celebrated lot, a guy named Edgar G. Ulmer. The very mention of his name prompted an outburst. “Don’t believe a word he said!” Bob exclaimed. As fate would have it, Bob’s first cousin was Shirley Ulmer, Edgar’s wife and lifelong collaborator. Bob had sat through many a meal with the director holding court and telling some of the tallest of his tales, and he wasn’t buying any of it. This, naturally, made me only more eager to explore the career of this enigmatic director, a man who clearly had talent but repeatedly exaggerated his accomplishments and affiliations, especially late in life, in such a way as to provoke total disbelief. I needed to find out more, so Bob offered to put me in touch with Shirley Ulmer. My calls went unanswered until one autumn evening in 2001, when I heard from Shirley’s daughter, Arianné, a former actor, who told me that Shirley had recently xi\n\nxii\n\n|\n\nPreface\n\npassed away. Arianné, however, had not only acted in several of her father’s films but ran the Edgar G. Ulmer Preservation Corp. out of her home office on Stone Canyon Road in Sherman Oaks, California. Not long after that, I boarded a plane from New York to Los Angeles to visit Arianné, whose passion, commitment, and charm came across even over the phone. Together we combed through the many boxes of materials—photos, letters, diaries, other unpublished manuscripts—she and her mother had been holding on to since her father’s death nearly thirty years earlier. I gathered as much material as I could, then worked my way through the various papers kept at the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In addition, I watched and rewatched all of Ulmer’s movies, some on duped videocassettes, some in brittle 16 mm prints viewed on a flatbed editing table, some on newly released DVDs, and some on the big screen. From California the journey continued onward to Vienna, where I spent the winter and spring of 2003 as a fellow at the International Research Center for Cultural Studies, trying to uncover details about Ulmer’s childhood and initial training in theater and film. While there, I often found myself reaching a series of dead ends: no records at the primary and secondary schools he purportedly attended; no definitive proof of his contributions to various early productions; no confirmation of the formal education he later claimed to have had. I continued to wade through the archives and follow up on numerous leads provided by friends and colleagues at the Austrian Film Museum and by journalist Stefan Grissemann, who had just published his German-language biography of Ulmer, Mann im Schatten: Der Filmemacher Edgar G. Ulmer (Man in the shadows: The filmmaker Edgar G. Ulmer) that same year. But the itinerant director seemed, either unwittingly or very craftily, to have covered his tracks. What made Ulmer marginal was not merely that he tended, over his thirty-five-year career as a director, to work in offbeat markets (B studios, Hollywood’s underground, European independents), and to traffic in eclectic genres (horror, race pictures, health shorts, film noir, costume dramas, science fiction), but that the details of his own life were tucked away somewhere in the dark corners of history. I left Austria after four months with a somewhat better picture of Ulmer but many mysteries unsolved. Luckily, in the final days of my stint in Vienna I had made a trip to Berlin, where I discovered a large cache of letters kept in the Paul Kohner Archives between Ulmer and his agent Ilse Lahn at the Kohner Office, mainly documenting his European\n\nPreface |\n\nxiii\n\nproductions from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. I saw immediately that to tell a fuller story of Ulmer, it would be necessary to include the lively, occasionally tense, discussions that he, Shirley, and Lahn—with periodic input by Kohner himself—carried out during the final decades of his professional life. I knew I would have to return to Berlin, the place where Ulmer had his seemingly auspicious directorial debut three-quarters of a century earlier. But while Ulmer began his career with such renowned émigré directors as Robert Siodmak, Fred Zinnemann, and Billy Wilder—all of whom collaborated on the celebrated late silent classic Menschen am Sonntag (People on Sunday, 1930)—he never enjoyed the same sort of commercial success or big-studio backing as did others in his cohort of Austrian and German-born filmmakers in America. To compare Ulmer to those great, triumphant studio careers and to the dominant rags-toriches Hollywood mythology, though, is in many ways to fail to see Ulmer’s career on its own terms. “It isn’t as if Wilder remained an unsung outcast in his own time,” observes Ed Sikov early on in his biography of Billy Wilder, “a lone artist rubbing against the grain of his culture.”1 Indeed, that’s a description far more befitting of Ulmer than of his illustrious counterparts in the film business. In 2006, when I began writing the BFI Film Classics volume on Detour, Ulmer’s best-known film, I thought I would write a “little engine that could” tale about how a lowly B picture, made on a shoestring budget, found its way into the National Registry of Films of the Library of Congress and became one of the most famous films noirs of all time. That was the line champions of his work had taken over the years. “Ulmer chose to make small films on low budgets,” writes George Lipsitz in a rather exemplary vein, “because they gave him an opportunity to explore ideas and techniques that would not have been tolerated by the big studios. His entire life history in theater and film testifies to a self-conscious struggle to pursue artistic and social truths at the risk of commercial failure.”2 But what I learned, especially after spending time with Ulmer’s personal writings, was that the truth, as it often is, was a bit more complicated. This pioneering independent filmmaker also harbored genuine, heartfelt aspirations of financial success, recognition, a studio contract, and a steadier paycheck than has often been acknowledged in Ulmer circles. And why not? The two are, to my mind, not mutually exclusive and do not make Ulmer any less of an artist. In 2008 I returned to the Paul Kohner Archives in Berlin and again dove into the papers\n\nxiv\n\n|\n\nPreface\n\ndeposited there by the “Magician of Sunset Boulevard,” as Kohner was known. What I found further balanced my understanding of Ulmer. Not exactly a model client, Ulmer often ran into trouble with his agent by making deals of his own, getting into chronic money troubles, and bellyaching intermittently about the lack of proper studio work. His letters show a man who spent most, if not all, of his career moving from one freelance assignment to the next, a man who, in the process, produced a dizzying—in some ways extraordinary, given the limitations placed on him—body of work. As Austrian critic Bert Rebhandl writes, Ulmer was “an Odysseus of cinema, who wasn’t destined to return home, but who, on his long voyage through various genres and film cultures, spanned the entire spectrum: cool modernity alongside lascivious speculation, cheap trash beside classic virtuosity.”3 In Edgar G. Ulmer: A Filmmaker at the Margins, I have attempted to track that voyage, to add previously unknown details of the director’s life and career wherever I could, and to speculate on the significance of each phase, each picture, and each itinerary. When I first set out to write this book, I was determined to find clear-cut answers to all of the disputed facts and half-truths connected to the filmmaker. But over time I became more comfortable with the impossibility of this task and with the need for a life like Ulmer’s to straddle truth and fiction almost the way a literary memoir might. In that sense this is not a straight biography—if there ever were such a thing. In the end I have chosen neither to believe wholesale what I was told on that redwood deck in La Jolla more than a decade ago nor to accept without qualification what Ulmer himself presented as the truth when he was still alive. It hasn’t made his life or career any less intriguing to me, which, I suspect, is precisely how he wanted it.\n\n1\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth Vienna is no more. What you seek there, you will not find. —Josef von Sternberg, Hollywood 1968\n\nDealing with a subject as elusive as an undocumented childhood is a daunting task, one that requires considerable resourcefulness, tact, and imagination and that ultimately relies on a fair amount of detective work and scholarly conjecture. Yet when it comes to a figure like Edgar G. Ulmer, whose life and career often seem enshrouded in unverifiable claims, some of them quite extravagant—for instance, that he was related to the eminent turn-of-the-century Viennese writer Arthur Schnitzler; that he once served as a case study for Freud’s childhood analyses; that he invented the “unchained” camera, the dolly shot, and pioneered German expressionism; or, perhaps most fabulous of all, that he directed the Atlanta fire sequence in Gone with the Wind and stepped in for Fellini to execute a long tracking shot in La dolce vita—it is perhaps fitting that what we know of his childhood be marked by a similar degree of murkiness, fantasy, and mendacity as his adult life.1 Indeed, as film scholar Lotte Eisner once claimed in a more provocative spirit, Ulmer might be considered “the greatest liar in the history of cinema.”2 Ulmer first came to public attention in the mid-1950s, when French critics from Cahiers du cinéma, the same unwavering auteurists who took special delight in finding virtues in the depraved, neglected, and misunderstood renegade directors toiling on the fringes of Hollywood (Anthony Mann, Fritz Lang, Nicholas Ray, among others), began to champion the director. In 1956 Luc Moullet dubbed Ulmer “le plus 1\n\n2\n\n|\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth\n\nmaudit des cinéastes,” and though he may not really have been the most “accursed” of filmmakers—indeed that same year François Truffaut hailed his work as “a small gift from Hollywood” and soon declared Ulmer one of America’s best directors—his largely subterranean career, and even the reception of what is likely his best-known film, Detour (1945), has often seemed utterly doomed.3 Like the poète maudit on which the term is based, the cinéaste maudit has been commonly understood as a romantic, tragic figure, whose style and sensibility spurn the mainstream, who is self-consciously outré or oppositional. The Cahiers critics gravitated toward this idea with uncommon zeal; to label a director or a film maudit was to grant a special status (Fritz Lang’s M was released in France under the title M le maudit), to recognize an aesthetic whose greatness was, perhaps, accepted by a mere few, those who were the true purveyors of the cultural avantgarde. Ulmer would come to embody this very spirit and over the course of his life and career retained his marginal status, a “termite” artist as opposed to a “white elephant” artist, in Manny Farber’s famous comparative scheme laid out in the pages of Film Culture in 1962. The peculiar force of termite art, wrote Farber, is that “it goes always forward eating its own boundaries, and, likely as not, leaves nothing in its path other than signs of eager, industrious, unkempt activity.”4 For many decades now, Ulmer has understandably remained something of an enigma in the history of American and European cinema. “Ulmer occupies an unknown, uncharted, and apparently invisible space on the margins of cinema history,” remarked John Belton in 1997.5 Although he was made the subject of several interviews, in Cahiers du cinéma in the early1960s and in extensive conversations with Peter Bogdanovich, recorded only two years before Ulmer’s death and first published posthumously, in 1974, in Film Culture, and although bits of biographical information have trickled out over the years, the mystery still lingers.6 Of the many entries contained in Rudolf Ulrich’s comprehensive reference guide Österreicher in Hollywood (Austrians in Hollywood, 1993), there is only a brief and partially inaccurate piece on Ulmer. What Ulrich does get right, however, is his opening assertion: “The first years of his life lie somewhat in the dark, as Ulmer himself gave different years of his birth in different interviews.”7 Focusing on this aspect of Ulmer’s story—both the shadowy details surrounding his life and the fact that he spent his career in the shadows\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth | 3\n\nof his cohort of famous Viennese émigré directors, including Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, and Fred Zinnemann—Austrian film critic Stefan Grissemann published his aptly titled 2003 biography of Ulmer Mann im Schatten (Man in the shadows). Regarding the filmmaker’s childhood, Grissemann observes the following: He grew up in a Viennese rental apartment located on the Hofenedergasse during the early years of the past century. It is a rather quiet, unusually hidden street in the Second District [the Leopoldstadt], only a few minutes on foot from the Praterstern, and yet not quite visible, as if cut off from the city life which begins to assert itself just two blocks away, easily reachable, but only to a person who knows what he’s looking for. Edgar Georg Ulmer’s childhood matches the kind of cinema that he would later produce: close to all that’s timely and popular, very near to that which is big, explicit, and evocative of success, and still hardly visible, kept in secrecy, almost private— something of a mystery.8\n\nMore enigmatic than all other phases of his life and career, Ulmer’s childhood, and what we know of it, has to be traced along a disparate route made up of verifiable facts and assertions that fall somewhere in the murky zone between truth and fiction. As French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, who together with Luc Moullet interviewed Ulmer in the early 1960s, has said of him: “He is a character even beyond his films, one of the rare people that when you read what he has said it’s practically impossible to be able to write his life because he was everywhere at the same time.”9 Tavernier regards Ulmer as someone given to extraordinary “invention, dream, mythomania,” a compulsive liar and inveterate fabulist, “someone who was totally original and sometimes a little mad.” Adding a critical rejoinder, however, Tavernier also considers Ulmer someone who, when you least expect it, is capable of telling the most outlandish story that turns out to be “totally accurate,” a story almost more spectacular than the patently fabricated ones he was famous for telling. Finally, as he has said of Ulmer more recently, “He seems almost like a fictitious character himself, but I can testify: He lived!”10\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nWhat we do know is that Ulmer was born on September 17, 1904. And even if he often pronounced himself a native of Vienna, sometimes claiming to be four years older than he actually was—presumably as a means of lending greater credence to his assertions of having\n\n4\n\n|\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth\n\nworked on various films when he would have barely been a teenager— the truth of the matter is that he came into the world not in the Habsburg capital but at his family’s summer residence in the provinces, in the Moravian town of Olmütz (Olomouc), in what is today the Czech Republic. His birth certificate makes it clear that his family address, which was originally where his paternal grandparents resided, was Resselgasse 1 (today Resslova 1) in the Olmütz district of Neugasse (today Nová ulice).11 He was born at home, not at the hospital, and owing to the story told by his family, that he first appeared completely covered in placenta, he was thought to have emerged from “underneath a veil,” appropriately hidden from direct view.12 His younger Viennese-born sister Elvira, known as Elly, used to like to tease her elder siblings, all of whom were born outside the city, calling them Bauernkinder (peasant children).13 Soon after his birth, however, Ulmer and his family returned to Vienna, the birthplace of his mother, where Edgar was raised in the Leopoldstadt, a district known for its high concentration of Jews, many of them from the outer reaches of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. There he was provided the basic petit-bourgeois comforts of his parents, Siegfried (Figure 1), a Moravian wine merchant, and Henriette (née Edels), an unsuccessful opera singer (Figure 2). In these early years Ulmer’s father was frequently on the road, said to return for only brief periods—just long enough to leave his wife pregnant with the next child—and his mother, not known for her warmth, earned a lifelong reputation for a nasty temper and an occasionally brutal punitive streak (when Edgar would misbehave, his wife, Shirley Ulmer, recounted many years later, “she would lock him in a dark closet and leave him there for a whole day”).14 Edgar was the eldest of four children, two boys (Edgar and Max) and two girls (Karola and Elly) (Figure 3); a fifth child, a daughter, died soon after birth. Brought up as a thoroughly secular, assimilated Viennese Jew, Ulmer claimed to have attended a local Jesuit school; in his interview with Bogdanovich he said he had never known he was a Jew until he went to high school (B 577). Yet it remains altogether unclear which school in Vienna he actually attended. It was not, in any case, the prestigious Akademisches Gymnasium to which he alludes in his unpublished autobiographical novel, “Beyond the Boundary”; nor was it the Schottengymnasium, of equally high repute in the world of Viennese secondary education. There is, as I learned after dogged efforts to secure information, no record at either school of an Edgar\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth | 5\n\nSiegfried Ulmer, circa 1900. Courtesy of Edgar G. Ulmer Preservation Corp. FIGURE 1.\n\nGeorg Ulmer ever having been a pupil there. Yet despite the paucity of hard documentation, it is still possible to speculate—based on correspondence and personal accounts—on the abilities and talents Ulmer possessed as a youngster. “He was an unusual child from all I’ve heard,” writes his wife, Shirley—whom he would marry in 1935 and who would be his lifelong collaborator and ardent defender of his reputation—in a letter of June 1939, to their young daughter, Arianné, then two years old, in an attempt to sketch a personal account of Ulmer’s family background, “eager, sensitive, strong willed and periodically morose. His tremendous ego has been fed and nurtured by himself since infancy, and despite all obstacles—all\n\n6\n\n|\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth\n\nHenriette Ulmer, circa 1900. Courtesy of Edgar G. Ulmer Preservation Corp. FIGURE 2.\n\nfamily attachments—all sentimentalities, he could remain unmoved until his purpose be achieved.”15 Indeed, in an early portrait of Ulmer as a teen, taken at a Viennese photo studio located around the corner from his family apartment, near the amusement parlors of the Prater, he has his arms folded and his chin slightly raised, projecting an air of self-confidence and maturity (Figure 4). The city of Vienna undoubtedly left its mark on the young Edgar, whose early life was thoroughly saturated with the cultural heritage of his time. This was, after all, the same Vienna that fellow filmmaker\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth | 7\n\nThe Ulmer children, circa 1912. Foreground from left: Elly, Karola, Edgar. Background: Max.

Ulmer managed to bring “art and culture,” as Tavernier observes, “to the most unexpected places.”18 From the outset he was a self-described aesthete, a Kulturfreak, as another commentator has remarked, somebody “who engorged himself and his family—and of course his films—with art of all kinds from Schumann’s piano concertos to the Venus de Milo.”19 But Vienna’s impact on the blossoming youth was not solely affirmative. In the spring of 1916, before Ulmer had reached his twelfth birthday, his father died of kidney failure while in Austrian uniform fighting on the Italian front in the First World War; like so many patriotic Austro-Hungarian Jews, Siegfried Ulmer had volunteered to serve in Emperor Franz Josef’s army. Young Edgar, not quite a full-blown adolescent, is said to have been sent alone, rather mercilessly, to identify the body of his father and to help transfer his remains to Vienna.20 There can be little doubt that such a devastating loss—a loss he forever associated with the city—was tough to digest for a young boy, and it certainly left an indelible scar, not only personally but also artistically. “In so many of his films,” observes Michael Henry Wilson, “the father figure is absent or is dead and is influencing the character from beyond the\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth | 9\n\ngrave.”21 We merely need to think of some of the most prominent examples from Ulmer’s repertoire, such as Strange Illusion (1945), Carnegie Hall (1947), or Ruthless (1948). On April 12, 1916, Siegfried Ulmer was buried in Vienna’s Zentralfriedhof. BEYOND THE BOUNDARY\n\nSome two decades after the death of his father, Ulmer dedicated a draft of his unfinished novel “Beyond the Boundary,” which is dated “Hollywood 1935”: “To one of the many thousand soldiers, who died in the first World War; In memoriam of Siegfried Ulmer, my father.”22 The ravages of war form not only the backdrop of Ulmer’s fragmented, elliptical, and deeply autobiographical text—which follows the psychological and sexual travails of Viennese adolescent George (the Anglicized version of Ulmer’s middle name) Weichert on his path through the war-torn capital—but also highlight, to a considerable extent, his own coming of age and his budding creative sensibility. Indeed, he would continue to draw on the war experience throughout his later years. Ulmer’s wife, Shirley, who typed much of the manuscript while her husband dictated it to her, has said that the book “was something that he didn’t want anybody to know about . . . like it was a diary,” or what Ulmer thought of as “[his] little private work.”23 He chose to write a novel, as he explains to Bogdanovich, “because I did not believe the literature during and after the war on both sides: in Germany and in England, it was very much the heroic thing, where enemies were friends like you never saw. I couldn’t believe that” (B 576). For years, as he continued his labors intermittently between film projects, it became something of a family joke, a book that would be published, if at all, in some later century. Realizing perhaps that this was not his usual métier, and that he needed to write in a style and a language that was not his own, he once confided to his wife, “You know, I’m a bit of a thief, because I’m trying to follow the style of Franz Werfel and [Thomas] Mann.”24 Both Werfel and Mann, who, like Ulmer, had taken up residence in the larger community of German and Austrian-born émigrés and refugees in Los Angeles of the 1930s and 1940s, were names evocative of that golden age of literature and culture with which Ulmer frequently and passionately identified himself. Consider, for instance, the opening paragraphs of the novel: It is quiet in the large dark room. The dawn hasn’t broken yet. The presence of sleeping humans is obvious. The window is open and past the snow-\n\n10\n\n|\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth\n\ncovered ledge, streams in the cold winter air. It gets quite cold in Vienna in the winter. The window looks out upon a back yard. Fore-shortened in perspective, one feels the back wall of the other house alongside. And opposite that bleak back wall, in “L” form runs a wing, housing the servant- and kitchenquarters. Beyond that . . . the skyline of Vienna. It’s futile to describe it. Listen to Schubert, Johann Strauss, to Mozart and Haydn, and you will feel the strange substance of sentimentality, charm . . . the Spanish court-ceremonial and the Wienerwald . . . the Danube.\n\nThe novel follows its protagonist, George, through the streets of the semidestitute city, from the breadlines to the brothels, and chronicles his coming of age—the traumatic death of his father, his sexual awakening in adolescence at the hands of a local prostitute, and his final departure from his maternal home, scenes taken from Ulmer’s own life. Although it is far from first-rate in terms of its overall literary quality— the text is littered with errors, frequent ellipses, and handwritten notations suggesting he hoped in vain to return to it later—it does offer something in the way of substance concerning Ulmer’s cultural sensibility, which would be adapted, never completely, often as mere traces, into his cinematic output. Indeed the sounds of Vienna, not to mention the “ghostlike” figures and “shadows” (“like thoughts in dreams”) that populate Ulmer’s oneiric work, would crop up continuously in his aural and visual lexicon. The novel’s heavy emphasis on music not only jibes with the most prominent cultural currents of fin-de-siècle Vienna but also fits the selffashioned profile of its author, who considered music his first passion and who was known to use a baton—one that originally belonged to Franz Liszt and was passed to Ulmer by the Hungarian-born musician Leo Erdody, a frequent collaborator, whose father had received it as a gift—on the set. A penciled notation (“Why does the discord of an orchestra tuning up never disturb me?”) atop the first page of the text is repeated in the closing lines of the chapter, followed by Ulmer’s rather heavy-handed, overextension of his chosen metaphor: “And so the boy George became part of the orchestra itself . . . with all its many instrumental sections. . . . He somehow too felt he was being tuned up . . . but did not actually know it.” Leading up to this, we are made to witness George’s nocturnal strolls with his maid, Poldi—a peasant girl who holds a certain erotic attraction over the adolescent boy—through the city streets and alleys. We are also treated to a critical flashback of George’s father in military uniform. His parting words, after explain-\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth |\n\n11\n\ning to his son that he may not return from the front and that he should be prepared to take care of his mother and siblings, are instructive: “Never forget your and my name . . . our good name.” Ulmer himself would bear the burden of upholding his father’s name and employs the novel as a means of paying personal homage, from its dedication onward. Throughout the narrative the trauma of war figures with great prominence. When George visits the comparatively grand, sumptuous home of his friend Heinrich, who “played the piano like a virtuoso” and is two classes ahead of George, they debate the merits of the patriotic fervor—the so-called spirit of 1914—that swept the country in the early years of the Austrian military campaign. Playing on the Latin education of Viennese schoolchildren of Ulmer’s generation, George cites Horace’s Odes, “Dulce est pro patria mori” (It is sweet to die for one’s country), and goes on, in one of the more thinly veiled autobiographical moments of the novel, to confront Heinrich: “So my father was killed in your war. What does that make us children? War orphans! . . . My mother was left with four children.” George castigates his friend for not being more sympathetic to the predicament in which thousands of women and children found themselves, standing in the breadlines with ration cards and waiting in vain for proper sustenance, an atmosphere perhaps most poignantly captured in Hugo Bettauer’s novel Die freudlose Gasse (The Joyless Street, 1925), adapted to the screen by G. W. Pabst a year later. The rotten taste of “warbread” serves as a redolent leitmotif in the novel. Following their heated discussion, George ends up storming off from his friend’s home only to find himself with a prostitute called Peppi, whom he recognizes from the breadlines in which he waits with his maid. Peppi offers a kind of familiar, possibly maternal comfort—she affectionately calls George “Bubi” (an Austrian term of affection for a small boy)—that he is willing to pay for. As his first sexual partner, Peppi is accorded special status. George insists, as a means of preserving her status as long as possible, that she accept his extra payment of ten kronen so she can spend the entire night sequestered in their hotel room without entertaining additional patrons. Upon leaving Peppi at the hotel, Ulmer draws again on his musical lexicon and has George observe, “If I were a great composer like Johann Sebastian Bach, I would write another Passion. Not with the son of God on the cross, but woman.” He then underscores the transformation: “The child George had died; because there had to be room in his soul for the man George.”\n\n12\n\n|\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth\n\nIn a highly compressed chapter, limited to a single typewritten page, Ulmer opens with yet another musical allusion, marking the chosen tempo of his work “allegro con brio,” an ostensible reference to the countless Viennese composers, from Haydn through Schoenberg, who were known to begin their symphonies in that same tempo. The setting here, however, is the horrible winter of 1916–17, when rations were cut and the initial war frenzy had begun to wane. “The once gay and noisy people of Vienna had become ominously silent,” he writes. “They shuffled like shadows through winter cold streets. . . . A melody like a dirge began slowly to rise.” The fateful night with Peppi, now months in the past, remains on the forefront of George’s mind: “Somehow he felt that this experience had unnaturally and prematurely brought him to maturity.” The young boy retreats inside himself, closing off the outside world and, like Ulmer himself ostensibly did, closing off his relationship to his mother. Ulmer writes of George, “He wanted no part of his home, nor his mother.” Over the years, in his personal writings, Ulmer would frequently revisit his animosity toward his own mother and the conflicted feelings that took root in him. “I hated my mother mentally,” he writes in a long, introspective letter to his wife, sent from Rome on April 25, 1949, and explicitly indebted to Freud (“The great inventor and prophet of psychoanalysis,” as he calls him); yet, he then adds, with the slightly bungled syntax of an émigré, “as a woman I adored her.”25 It is worth recalling that Ulmer wrote this work, in his adopted language, only ten years after arriving on these shores. His general linguistic mastery—minor syntactical errors and, in spoken English, his thick Viennese accent notwithstanding—is impressive. As for his protagonist, George leaves his mother’s house behind and moves in with a Dr. Erika Donat, an avowedly “sexless” woman he meets during a long night of drinking at a coffeehouse and who, according to the narrator, is “one of the very few young human beings who successfully has overcome the inheritance of being Viennese and therefore sentimental and gemütlich.” George announces, “I haven’t any home; never had one,” a bold pronouncement with far wider reverberations later in Ulmer’s life. Indebted to the precedent of Schnitzler, Freud, and other fin-de-siècle Viennese writers who sought to plumb the depths of the subconscious, Ulmer couches his penultimate chapter in a haze of intoxication and dreams. “This is a dream,” asserts George. “This is alcohol speaking through me.” Almost clinical in her approach, Dr. Donat engages with George in a kind of dialogic analysis, a talking cure of sorts. “You are in the embryonic development of the intellectual,”\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth |\n\n13\n\nshe tells him, noting that she belongs “to that class of physicians that prefer to tell their patients the truth.” She then goes on to explain to George, with more than a subtle nod to Nietzsche: “The intellectualist is perforce an egomaniac and possessing these requirements you shall undoubtedly become a valuable addition to that select circle of critics and oracles.” For Ulmer, as he noted repeatedly in his letters, the pure intellectual or artist, loyal to his or her pursuit—the genius perhaps—forms a separate social class. As he writes to his daughter, Arianné, from Munich, just after Christmas 1955, seemingly glossing Thus Spoke Zarathustra once more: “Art is a very high peak which very few people have really ascended. The air is thin, cold, way up there. Practically no people live up there. It’s warmer in the valley where all the other people live. There is laughter down there, children and the comfortable house and somebody who belongs to you.”26 To George, who fashions himself “the smartest boy in [his] class,” the path is similarly lonely. The penultimate chapter concludes with George lying down to sleep, with a final thought of transformation: “Always something happened to lift him from the greatest despondency to a state of security from which he was able to start the trek of his earthly existence anew.” The novel offers little in the way of resolution. In fact, the fifth and final chapter is just as skeletal as some of the other more compressed parts. There is no formal denouement. Instead, George awakens the next morning, somewhat confused and disoriented, at Dr. Donat’s home. A young woman, Miss Ilse, a student at the Academy of Dramatic Arts who was taken in by Dr. Donat two years ago, greets him in her pink robe. She teases George for wearing one of Erika’s sleeping gowns, calls him “the run-away” and mistakenly addresses him as “Joseph” instead of George, possibly an allusion to the biblical figure known to be an interpreter of dreams. George is “put properly in his place” by the rhetorical skills of the aspiring actress, and the story essentially comes to a halt there. As elsewhere in the writing process, Ulmer shows a high degree of self-awareness; indeed, the very act of writing a fragmentary, autobiographical work with literary pretensions is itself highlighted throughout the text. For example, George receives Stendhal’s Souvenirs d’égotisme (Memoirs of an Egotist), a work that is similarly autobiographical and fragmentary, as a gift for his fifteenth birthday from his friend Heinrich. Dr. Erika Donat, in conversation with George, declares herself to be “good material for a novel or play in the modern vein” and suggests possible affinities to Jakob Wassermann\n\n14\n\n|\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth\n\nand Henrik Ibsen. “Amusing to be conscious of one’s own value as story material,” she concludes, with a tacit reference to the nature of the entire project. Long after setting out to write his novel, Ulmer would remain enthralled by notions of self-mythologizing and the vast powers of the human imagination.\n\nBIG CITY OF DREAMS\n\nLike many artists before him, Ulmer felt the need to declare himself a native son of Vienna and, in so doing, claimed a profound attachment— emotional, cultural, and otherwise—to the storied city. “When Truffaut and the critics of the Cahiers du cinéma interviewed the man, he gave Vienna as his birthplace,” observes Bernd Herzogenrath. “Fashioning himself as a representative of European High Culture, Ulmer almost naturally felt the urge to repress provinciality.”27 By the eve of the Great War, just as Ulmer was approaching his tenth birthday, a catchy tune entitled “Wien, du Stadt meiner Träume” (Vienna, you are the city of my dreams), written by Rudolf Sieczynski, was making the rounds in the Imperial capital and becoming a worldwide hit (Stanley Kubrick would later use it to set the tone for his final film, the fin-de-siècle, Schnitzler-inspired Eyes Wide Shut, 1999). The song’s refrain goes as follows: Wien, Wien, nur Du allein Sollst stets die Stadt meiner Träume sein Dort wo die alten Häuser stehn, Dort wo die lieblichen Mädchen gehn . . . (Vienna, Vienna, none but you, Can be the city of my dreams come true Here, where the dear old houses loom, Where I for lovely young girls swoon . . .)28\n\nAs the scene of Ulmer’s first metropolitan experience, Vienna certainly attained the status of city of dreams, and he continued to treat it as such long after he left it behind, first for Sweden, then for Berlin to work on Max Reinhardt’s stage productions, and still later on for New York, Hollywood, and eventually back to Europe once more. Indeed, the course of Austrian cinema was not unlike the itinerary of Ulmer’s life. From the very beginning the industry was necessarily international, with well-trodden paths leading to Berlin, Paris, and, somewhat later, Hollywood.29 “Austrian film history is a phantasm,” the German film\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth |\n\n15\n\ncritic Frieda Grafe once remarked, “because it is not tied to a fixed place; its cinema is a kind of film without a specific space.” In her pithy summation, with a wink to the city’s famous literati and psychoanalysts, “Vienna was a reservoir of dreams.”30 By the time Ulmer reached his teens, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, that vibrant amalgamation of cultures and ethnicities, no longer existed. And even before that, the Jews of Vienna, as Carl Schorske has noted, had become regarded as a “supra-national people.”31 It should perhaps come as no surprise, then, that the Viennese-born, or in Ulmer’s case Viennese-trained, film directors were particularly adroit fabulists when it came to dreaming up their pasts in the film world of Hollywood, the factory of dreams. Erich von Stroheim would take on a self-avowed air of Prussian aristocracy; Otto Preminger pedaled the image of a Teutonic tyrant, something he shared with Fritz Lang; Billy Wilder embraced the identity of a former gigolo and star reporter (“In a single morning,” he boasted to Playboy’s Richard Gehman, “I interviewed Sigmund Freud, his colleague Alfred Adler, the playwright and novelist Arthur Schnitzler, and the composer Richard Strauss. In one morning”);32 and Ulmer, no less immodestly, fashioned himself a wunderkind from Reinhardt’s renowned drama school and an “aesthete from the Alps.”33 Each of these roles, and there were of course many more, would offer a new identity to the displaced émigré in need of a quick makeover, especially one that might bring more work or, at the very least, some additional grist for the public relations mill. As Ulmer once remarked of Stroheim, with a tone of approval, if not outright adulation: “I loved Stroheim. The man invented his own character—everything” (B 568).34 From childhood onward, Ulmer would remain engaged in the process of self-invention; his Viennese youth, the skills he learned, and the cultural mythology that seems to have followed him to the New World featured prominently in this process. “He is a king without a country,” insisted Frieda Grafe. “Out of necessity, he made films in Hollywood almost without any means, dark films conjured from his imagination.”35 The Viennese seemed especially well equipped for this task. “The secret affinity that existed between Hollywood on one side and Vienna or Paris on the other,” observes Thomas Elsaesser, “was that they were societies of the spectacle, cities of make-believe and of the show. The decadence of the Habsburg monarchy was in some ways the pervasive sense of impersonation, of pretending to be in possession of values and status that relied for credibility not on substance but on convincing performance, on persuading others to take an appearance for the reality.”36\n\n16\n\n|\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth\n\nUlmer with his host family in Sweden, 1919. Courtesy of Edgar G. Ulmer Preservation Corp.\n\nFIGURE 5.\n\nThere were, however, real-life events that punctuated the illusion of living merely in a spectacular world of appearances. After his father Siegfried’s death—it’s hard not to think of the event in mythical, even Wagnerian, terms—with the help of a Jewish aid organization and the U.S. Hoover Commission, Edgar and his sister Karola were sent to a foster family in Sweden, where they remained until the end of the war (his brother, Max, found foster care in England, his sister Elvira in Holland). To qualify for financial support, Ulmer’s mother, Henriette, allegedly had to present her children as orphaned nieces and nephews.37 A surviving photo from that period shows Ulmer, in 1919, with his Swedish host family. Surrounded by mostly smiling young girls, he looks strangely ill at ease, uncharacteristically serious and without any hint of play, staring rather blankly at the camera (Figure 5).\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth |\n\n17\n\nYet a much later letter, sent in May 1947 and written by Eric Kronning (né Katz) of Stockholm, one of the children in Ulmer’s host family, tells of the happy times being cared for by various Jewish families in and around Stockholm, and Ulmer himself spoke equally fondly of his time in Sweden.38 Likewise, Ulmer seems to have left a strong impression on his Swedish foster family, and it is perhaps that positive experience that made it possible for him, upon leaving Sweden, to return not to his mother (who, by 1920, had begun a relationship with a new man, something that her teenage son had difficulty countenancing) but instead, much like the character of George in “Beyond the Boundary,” to enter into yet another nonbiological family structure. Returning to Vienna in 1920, Ulmer moved in with the Schildkrauts, a father-son acting duo, Rudolph and Joseph, who were largely responsible for introducing him to the world of theater and cinema. Around this same time, in continued rebellion against his mother, he rejected her plans for him to become a furrier, a trade that Middle European Jews of his generation pursued in relatively large numbers, and instead registered for courses at Vienna’s Academy of Fine Arts. This sort of rebellion was not uncommon among Ulmer’s cohort of aspiring filmmakers. “Indeed, in the Vienna of the Twenties,” writes Neil Sinyard in his study of Fred Zinnemann, “there was a great gap between the mostly conservative and traditionbound professional class and film people, who were definitely not regarded as solid citizens.”39 At the Academy of Fine Arts, Ulmer is said to have taken courses with Alfred Roller, who, like Rudolph Schildkraut, was a close collaborator of Max Reinhardt and helped him to establish the Salzburger Festspiele.40 There is, regrettably, no surviving record at Vienna’s Academy of Fine Arts of Ulmer ever having formally enrolled; records of this sort are generally kept only for graduates of the academy, which suggests that, assuming he attended at all, he never graduated. In Shirley Ulmer’s rendition, written in a personal letter from 1939, “[Ulmer] had wanted to be a symphony conductor, but his widowed mother wouldn’t sponsor his education along these lines. Even so, he took the next best route along ‘the world of make believe’—the stage.”41 Regardless of the precise circumstances surrounding his formal studies—as Ulmer tells it, before his time with Reinhardt, “I took my schooling at the Burg Theater in Vienna” (B 562), the city’s most historically renowned dramatic venue—the true details of which will likely never be known, what is clear is that the Schildkrauts served as an important conduit for Ulmer, an initial apprenticeship of sorts in preparation for his later career. As Ulmer describes it himself, in conversation\n\n18\n\n|\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth\n\nwith Bogdanovich: “In my youth, the first time I ran away from home was with Rudolph Schildkraut and Pepi [i.e., Joseph]. Pepi was at the beginning in the theatre with me. Rudolph was, of course, a fantastic actor, and he understood kids” (B 577). In a slight variation of his own story, Ulmer’s daughter, Arianné Ulmer Cipes, a former actress who appeared in several of her father’s films, puts it this way: “My father was in Sweden as a war orphan after the First World War, and when he came back to Vienna, Rudolph Schildkraut—‘Pepe’ [sic] Schildkraut’s father—took him into his home, and Joseph and Dad (who were pretty much the same age) became close friends. Rudolph Schildkraut was a matinee idol, the Barrymore of that time. He not only took my father in as a teenager, he got him into Max Reinhardt’s dramatic school, where Dad started initially as a student to be an actor.”42 Without relying too heavily on armchair psychoanalysis—or, quite simply, on the symbol-laden absence of a biological father—it would seem to make complete sense that Rudolph Schildkraut, an actor made famous by playing a series of patriarchs and grand Shakespearian figures, from Shylock to King Lear, should be well suited to be Ulmer’s surrogate father. “At the core of Schildkraut’s art,” wrote Weimar-era theater critic Julius Bab, lies the “caring father.”43 For Bab, what was so special, and what remained seared in one’s memory after viewing Schildkraut’s many performances, was the “Vatergefühl” (paternal feeling) he transmitted. Indeed, Egon Dietrichstein featured the elder Schildkraut in his survey Die Berühmten (The Celebrities, 1920), calling him one of the last great comic actors, “strong, virtuous, formidable, like the mimes of the old school. But fine, delicate, nuanced. One cries and laughs with Schildkraut.”44 Schildkraut’s son, in his autobiography My Father and I (1959), cites an unnamed critic, possibly Bab, making a similarly laudatory assertion: “Loving, majestic, kind and cheerful, helplessly crushed and frightening in his anger—always a father. This actor from a little village in Romania put his indelible mark on the German theater because he could rise to the highest levels of his art—whenever called upon to create the character of father.”45 Alas, in his some 250-page memoir, much of it of the self-serving variety of ghostwritten autobiography, the younger Schildkraut, who enjoyed an enormously successful acting career in the United States and went on to win an Oscar for his portrayal of Captain Dreyfus in William Dieterle’s The Life of Emile Zola (1937), does not see fit to mention his friendship with Ulmer (admittedly, he also fails to mention other key friendships, including that of Peter Lorre). Yet he does speak\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth |\n\n19\n\nat great length about his father and his ties to Max Reinhardt, the socalled high priest of art, and mentions the great import of the Yiddish Theatre on New York’s Lower East Side, where Rudolph acted in a number of classic plays and where Ulmer mentions having been introduced to some of the players with whom he would later collaborate on his four Yiddish features made in the late 1930s.46 Although the Schildkrauts shuttled back and forth to Europe in the 1910s and 1920s, the dates that Ulmer gives in his interview match up, and it is fully conceivable that the Schildkrauts served as another kind of host family and as theatrical mentors to Ulmer for a brief, yet significant time.\n\nMAX REINHARDT; OR, AN AESTHETIC EDUCATION\n\nAs was the case with most German and Austrian filmmakers of his generation, Ulmer learned much of his trade in the theater. And like these acclaimed figures (F. W. Murnau, Otto Preminger, William Dieterle, and others), he eventually made his way to Max Reinhardt. “It’s very difficult to imagine today what the name Max Reinhardt meant when I grew up in Vienna,” notes Preminger in an interview from the early 1970s; and, as he suggests later in the same interview, “nobody who watched him direct and became a director could escape his influence.”47 The Schildkrauts are credited with having arranged Ulmer’s formal introduction to Reinhardt, and they both had far-reaching ties to the renowned theater impresario. Ulmer’s tenure at Reinhardt’s Berlin-based drama school, at the Deutsches Theater, or somewhat later at the Viennese Theater in der Josefstadt, however, has yet to be documented (and, in fact, given the staggering number of students who trained with Reinhardt, it may never be). What can be ascertained with relative assuredness, however, is Ulmer’s journey to New York to assist in the staging of Reinhardt’s grand production of Das Mirakel (The Miracle) at the Century Theatre, which entailed nothing short of the total transformation of a run-of-the-mill theater on the Upper West Side into a Gothic cathedral.48 Ulmer himself claims to have been involved in the stage design for the production, and he describes his first trip to New York, at the age of nineteen, as having been organized by the Schildkrauts. Indeed, Rudolph Schildkraut was part of the original cast of The Miracle that traveled to New York with the show. It is fully plausible that Ulmer had a hand, perhaps as one of the many designers or simply one of the some seven hundred people enlisted in the play’s highly successful ten-month, 298-performance run.49 The Berlin-born actor Fritz Feld, a principal in\n\n20\n\n|\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth\n\nthe Reinhardt production and a repeat player in Ulmer’s pictures of the 1940s, attests to this fact in his eulogy to Ulmer, delivered on October 3, 1972. “Edgar came to the United States in the same year as I did,” he begins, “49 years ago. We first met in Salzburg, Austria. Both of us belonged to the staff of Professor Max Reinhardt. Edgar was born in the romantic Vienna and he had all the charm of the true Viennese.”50 Yet the official record at Ellis Island, which indicates his transatlantic passage on the SS President Roosevelt and his arrival in New York Harbor on April 12, 1924 (also his place of residence as “Wein” [sic!]), puts him in Manhattan long after the opening on January 16, 1924.51 There are nevertheless a number of plausible scenarios regarding Ulmer’s involvement in The Miracle: (1) that Ulmer came at the request of his friends Feld and Schildkraut, both of whom were officially engaged in the production; (2) that he came to assist Reinhardt and his chief American collaborator, Norman Bel Geddes, in set design or some other capacity (the ship manifest lists his profession as “actor”), in the ongoing performance; or (3) that he simply seized the chance to travel to the Unites States, like countless other European theater and film people, in search of greater opportunities and financial prosperity. In an end-of-season review in the New York Times, on November 9, 1924, more than ten months after its premiere, and seven months after Ulmer’s arrival in New York, critic Stark Young hailed The Miracle as “a landmark in the history of American theatre” and went on to note that for the immense and rather lavish production—with outlay costs of more than $600,000 and total earnings of $2 million—“700 people are said to have been employed.”52 Ulmer is not listed in the official entry on The Miracle contained in Heinrich Huesmann’s Welttheater Reinhardt, the most detailed, exhaustive reference guide to Reinhardt’s productions. But Huesmann does not account for the hundreds involved and, in fact, lists only those who participated in the play’s premiere, when Ulmer had not yet landed on American shores.53 Anecdotal evidence from Reinhardt’s acclaimed New York production, as conflicting and unreliable as it may be, abounds. For instance, Shirley Ulmer tells how her husband, whose English was quite poor at the time of his arrival, allegedly offended the play’s leading lady, Diana Manners, by using expletives unwittingly as stage directions during rehearsal. In that same interview she shares the opinion with Michael Henry Wilson that The Miracle was “an inspiration for a long time in his work” and that, as a kind of morality play, it provided an archetype for Ulmer’s later projects as a filmmaker.54 Of course, the success of the\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth |\n\n21\n\nUlmer’s calling card. Courtesy of the Edgar G. Ulmer Preservation Corp. FIGURE 6.\n\nproduction, and the breakthrough that it marked for Reinhardt’s American career, made it all the more attractive for a young émigré like Ulmer looking to build a strong résumé. The kind of ardent press attention and rave reviews that the production garnered—a bold headline from the New York Journal read “Professor Reinhardt Proves He Is Fully as Great an Artist as Heralded” and eminent critic Brooks Atkinson hailed it as “a stupendous enterprise”—are reviews that any aspiring artist can only dream of.55 Regardless of the true scope of his engagement with Reinhardt, though, Ulmer clearly identified himself as part of the Reinhardt school. His visiting card from the period (presumably from the early to mid1920s) boldly asserts his affiliation (Figure 6). Here he lists his selfappointed title as director and Ausstatungschef (head of design) for the Reinhardt stage and also gives Vienna, Berlin, and New York as his cities of operation, an early gesture toward the cosmopolitan identity Ulmer embraced until his death (the transatlantic commute he began in the 1920s would resume in the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s). As for the aesthetic legacy from Reinhardt, Ulmer’s unwavering attention to mise-en-scène, to artifice and aesthetic detail may indeed be attributed to the precedent set by Reinhardt. Another strand of this legacy is reflected in his continued artistic collaborations (with people like set designer Rochus Gliese, cameraman Eugen Schüfftan, composer Leo Erdody, and émigré actors Fritz Kortner, Felix Bressart, Hedy Lamarr, and Eva Gabor, among others). We can also note his frequent reliance on European sources (stories by Viennese writers Gina Kaus, Fritz Rotter, Salka Viertel, and others) and\n\n22\n\n|\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth\n\nthe shameless inclusion of inside jokes, accented asides, and allusions ostensibly aimed at the sensibility of German-speaking émigrés in Hollywood (for example, his playful characterization of the collapsed Habsburg Empire and the haunted architect Hjalmar Poelzig in The Black Cat or his villainous figure referred to as “Karl Kraus” in Beyond the Time Barrier).56 Although much of his work, both before and after migration to America, can be checked against the historical record, there are instances, such as his professed collaborations with Fritz Lang on such acclaimed productions as Metropolis and M, that have trouble withstanding the glare of critical scrutiny. “Herr Ulmer never worked for me,” insisted Lang when asked about the repeated claims of collaboration, “neither as a film architect nor as a set designer, nor in any other capacity.”57 In the end, then, Ulmer remains something of a phantom figure, a Phantombild, as Grissemann has dubbed him. Tracking his early years is akin to tracking a Zelig-like character that seems to have been everywhere and involved in everything all at the same time. As with Woody Allen’s Zelig, we are often left to ask ourselves whether such a figure could possibly have existed or whether he’s merely a figment of our imagination. It is with good reason that the most memorable line from Andrew Sarris’s 1968 entry on the director, tucked away in the “Expressive Esoterica” section of his highly influential compendium The American Cinema, reads: “But yes, Virginia, there is an Edgar G. Ulmer, and he is no longer one of the private jokes shared by auteur critics, but one of the minor glories of the cinema.”58 Even if Ulmer’s work did not always demand a defensive reflex—Sarris calls him “a director without alibis”—his wider reputation as a teller of tall tales never quite left him. When Film Comment ran an article, in the spring of 1990, on ten of the all-time greatest apocryphal Hollywood stories, they published the piece under the wicked title “Ready When You Are, Mr. Ulmer.”59 In his witty musings in “The Decay of Lying,” Oscar Wilde comes to an apt conclusion: “The final revelation is that Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art.”60 While it may not be the proper aim of life, Ulmer’s life and his art often seem to merge, blurring on repeated occasion almost beyond recognition. “Brother, when it comes to lying,” boxer Kid Slug Rosenthal (Maxie Rosenbloom) tells his manager Big Time (Roscoe Karns) early on in Ulmer’s wartime comedy My Son, the Hero, “you’re the champ.” Another illustrative moment taken from Ulmer’s repertoire comes in his acclaimed western The Naked Dawn—rated especially highly by Truffaut and his Cahiers\n\nTraces of a Viennese Youth |\n\n23\n\ncolleagues—when the rebel protagonist attempts to impress his female admirer. The romantic, wandering outlaw Santiago (played by Arthur Kennedy, still relatively fresh off the set of Fritz Lang’s Rancho Notorious) tells Maria (Betta St. John) of the legendary beauties of Veracruz: the dancing, the drinking, and the women. Yet, after serving up a series of florid embellishments, he admits to Maria that it is really nothing more than a “fever swamp,” a fitting allegory for many of Ulmer’s cheapie productions. Given Ulmer’s own proclivity for the romantic, a predilection on which he prided himself—declaring his allegiance to the “art-possessed” directors as opposed to those vulgar enough to consider film a business— it is perhaps worth considering another romantic summation. “Did he have a tendency to exaggerate—as some have accused him?” asks Bogdanovich in the preface to the 1998 reprint of his interview with Ulmer. “Don’t most people? Certainly the movies are a fabulist’s paradise, because anything is possible. Didn’t Edgar prove that with nearly every picture? Ulmer was a child of theatre and of the movies in their childhood and he never lost his innocent wonder at the challenge and magic of the medium.”61 Listening to the taped interviews with Bogdanovich, it’s hard not to feel the passion that Ulmer had for art, for music, and of course for cinema. He told many elaborate heartfelt stories, not all of them included in the printed text, about his own legendary productions and about such stirring contemporary work as John Schlesinger’s Midnight Cowboy (1969), a picture he saw multiple times and that left a deep impression on him. “I know that some directors lie,” observes Tavernier. “They have to—or they invent things and after a few years, they believe their own lie.”62 While we may not choose to believe wholesale all that has been told by and about Edgar G. Ulmer, the story of his life, in particular his youth, would be impossible without the inclusion of at least a few of the half-truths and fabrications that helped shape him. In the remaining chapters it will be up to us to sort through the persisting myths and balance them with a more judicious, more precise understanding of the filmmaker as he came into his own.\n\n2\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins\n\nAlthough Ulmer’s first stay in New York City, in 1924, didn’t last long—he appears to have made his way west as quickly as he could—it nonetheless left several strong impressions on the newcomer. Sometime during the second half of The Miracle’s ten-month run, he found his own living quarters, got his work papers in order, and searched for employment outside of Reinhardt’s stage production.1 While still adjusting to life in New York, he came into contact with another landsman, the Austrian-born vaudeville promoter Martin Beck, whom he assisted in designing the Martin Beck Theatre, which opened its doors on West 45th Street in November 1924 (B 576).2 During Ulmer’s first months in America the theater remained for him a constant source of intellectual and cultural stimulation. “When I came to New York the first time,” remarks Ulmer in conversation with Bogdanovich, “Reinhardt hired [Rudolph] Schildkraut, who had worked for him in Europe, to play in The Miracle. And I was taken down to Second Avenue, and met the Jewish Art Theatre troupe, which had some tremendous actors—Muni Weisenfreund [Paul Muni], Jacob Adler, Maurice Schwartz—it was something which didn’t exist elsewhere in all of New York. . . . It was a second Broadway down there” (B 577–78). This early contact with the thriving Yiddish stage on New York’s Lower East Side may well have motivated Ulmer, more than a decade later, to sign on to direct the four independent Yiddish feature films he completed in the late 1930s and 1940s. His dear friend Joseph Schild24\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins |\n\n25\n\nkraut, who had arrived in New York already in August 1920, and who was in large part responsible for introducing Ulmer to life in America—he would go on to introduce Ulmer to his first wife, the Californian dancer Josephine Warner, a couple of years later—writes in his memoir: “My first impression of New York was mixed, more confusing than exhilarating. The skyline, the harbor, the piers, the crowd—all these were exactly as I had seen them in paintings and photographs. Reality was merely copying art.”3 It’s rather ironic that Schildkraut should find this relationship between art and reality in the New World, when in many instances theater and film transplants like himself were enlisted in the process of imitating reality in their art, even an imagined reality of the Old World left behind. Émigrés of Schildkraut’s generation were often assigned in the New World the productions of Old World plays or films with an explicit investment in projecting a kind of “phantom Europe.”4 Perhaps for Ulmer one of the main attractions of New York was that there were so many fellow émigrés in his midst— the city was, after all, the first destination for immigrants—many of them artists, actors, directors, and crew members, who continued to draw on their pasts as a means of communicating with their new audience. In Ulmer’s case it was often his European training and cultural sensibility that linked him to other émigrés working in the United States.\n\nARRIVAL IN HOLLYWOOD\n\nStudio mogul Carl Laemmle, the influential head of Universal who himself had migrated to America from the Southern German town of Laupheim as a teenager, was known for his deep fondness for recruiting precocious young German-speaking émigrés. In the summer of 1921, while vacationing in Karlsbad, Laemmle hired the Bohemian-born producer and future agent Paul Kohner, then a nineteen-year-old, whose famed office on Sunset Boulevard would later represent, among many other émigrés, Ulmer.5 He also contracted the future star director, Alsatian-born William Wyler (né Wilhelm Weiller)—whose mother was a distant cousin of the studio head himself and who, like Kohner, was handpicked by Laemmle on one of his annual European trips—in 1923, when Wyler had just turned twenty-one. Laemmle hired Ulmer, then also nearing his twenty-first birthday, a year later. Famous for his robust appreciation of constant company, Laemmle, or “Uncle Carl,” as he was more commonly called, often surrounded himself with members of\n\n26\n\n|\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins\n\nhis extended clan—his children, nephews and cousins, sons-in-law and adopted sons—hosting regular Sunday luncheons at his home. As the American writer and poet Ogden Nash once quipped, “Uncle Carl Laemmle has a big faemmle.”6 Owing to his youthful ambition, his proven talent, and his ability to curry favor with Uncle Carl, Ulmer got his start in the lower echelons of Universal’s Art Department, thereby earning an honorary spot in Laemmle’s extended clan, where he remained more or less in good standing for nearly a decade. Two photos of Ulmer, both taken on the Universal lot in the mid1920s, show a proud young man getting his first taste of professional life at one of Hollywood’s major studios. The first shot has him standing underneath a sign announcing Art Director C. D. (Danny) Hall’s office—Ulmer would go on to employ Hall for the set design of The Black Cat (1934) a decade later—and below Hall’s name is “Edgar G. Ulmer, Asst.” (Figure 7). His hands are tucked into his pockets, his striped tie slightly rumpled, a leather bag draped around his shoulder, all conveying the casual confidence of someone who belongs. The second photo, snapped elsewhere on the lot, shows Ulmer posing in front of a glamorous convertible sedan, a car that symbolizes in unmistakable terms the American dream (Figure 8). He is wearing the same dark suit and striped tie as in the other photo—they appear to have been taken on the same day—and when one views the two snapshots as a pair, there is the implicit logic that with enough hard work at a big studio like Universal, the rewards will no doubt be ample. “Everyone who met Edgar Ulmer in those years,” suggests Grissemann, “must have noticed it, that hunger for meaning that the young man must have exuded, this aggressive form of yearning, the nagging desire to make himself indispensable in the art of creating something enduring, regardless of how, regardless in which position.”7 In relatively large numbers, young European émigrés of Ulmer’s ilk seemed to sense, almost to smell, the opportunity in Hollywood, a place where one could make it despite one’s non-American origins.8 As the Viennese-born Fred Zinnemann would write to a friend in Berlin in December 1929, soon after his arrival in Southern California at the age of twenty-two and directly after his collaboration with Ulmer on the production of Menschen am Sonntag (People on Sunday, 1930): “Hollywood is a marvelously beautiful place, this constantly occurs to me, and then more than anything else I want to hit the ground running!”9 The excitement and eagerness to succeed, to claw one’s way into gainful employment, was quite infectious among the young émigrés, even if the cultural fit between\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins |\n\n27\n\nA studio man: Ulmer as assistant art director at Universal, circa 1925. Courtesy of Robert Ulmer. FIGURE 7.\n\nthe American dream factory and the Middle European transplants was not always a perfect one. Working in Universal’s Art Department, from roughly the end of 1924 to the middle of 1928, Ulmer’s individual ambitions began to take root. There he not only invested his energy in art direction and design but also came into contact with future collaborators such as the cinematographer Benjamin Kline, cameraman of Detour and a regular during Ulmer’s PRC years two decades later.10 While assisting Wyler on a series of small-scale westerns, produced on the Universal lot at breakneck pace and with dizzying frequency, he eventually earned the opportunity to try his hand at direction. In the short obituary that\n\n28\n\n|\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins\n\nDreaming of the big leagues: Ulmer posing with convertible sedan on the Universal lot, circa 1925. Courtesy of Robert Ulmer.\n\nFIGURE 8.\n\nappeared in the New York Times on October 2, 1972, the unnamed author claims that Ulmer became known at this time for “grinding out 24 Western two-reelers in one year.”11 As Ulmer tells it, “There were two Western streets—on the upper part of one, Willy [Wyler] worked; on the lower part of the street, I worked. When Willy used the horses and the cowboys, I had to do close-ups in my pictures. Then, when I ran out of close-ups, I’d get the horses. . . . We had the following schedule: Monday and Tuesday, you wrote your script and prepared the production; Wednesday and Thursday, you shot; Friday, you cut; and Saturday, you went to Tijuana, gambling with the old man [Carl Laemmle]” (B 567). Philip Kemp points out that much of this work with Wyler can be corroborated and that Wyler himself duly acknowledged the partnership with Ulmer (albeit as a junior assistant) during these years.12 (Small as the family circle seems to have been, it was Wyler’s mother who first put Shirley Ulmer—then still Shirley Kassler— in contact with MGM head Irving Thalberg, who encouraged her to pursue a career as a script supervisor, which is exactly how she would meet Edgar Ulmer in 1934.)13 As Carl Laemmle Jr. recounted in 1969, “He [Ulmer] started as a sketch artist but quickly became involved in\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins |\n\n29\n\nproduction. Thereafter he worked as a second or third assistant director until we gave him a chance to develop in direction by assigning him to direct some of the two-reel series Westerns which we turned out in large numbers. We had quite a few series of one kind or another at the time and we rotated Mr. Ulmer so that he would be widely enough acquainted with all our product in this area to jump into directing wherever needed on the lot.”14 In his conversations with Bogdanovich, Ulmer managed to recall one of the many B westerns some four and a half decades after the production, an otherwise forgettable, generic picture called The Border Sheriff (1926), on which he is credited as assistant director. The film, a fivereeler, features veteran cowboy stars Jack Hoxie as sheriff Cultus Collins and Peewee Holmes as his sidekick, Tater-Bug, with Robert N. Bradbury, who shot a string of westerns for Universal throughout the 1920s, taking the official director credit. As was perhaps demanded at the time, operating under the conditions of such rapid and routinized production, the film has the boilerplate characters, frenetic scenes with plenty of shoot-em-up chases on horseback, and the contrived story line—good guys (Hoxie and Holmes) working to crush the bad-guy border outlaws and shady businessmen—of any cheap 1920s western.15 It is also, however, a prime example of the kind of pared-down, minimalist filmmaking espoused by such productions and thus an early object lesson for some of Ulmer’s future projects. Wyler tells a mordant tale from his days of churning out westerns on Universal’s back lot with Ulmer. Always on the lookout for schemes to supplement studio income, Uncle Carl would charge spectators twentyfive cents to observe the filmmakers, almost like zoo animals, at work. Wyler wasn’t especially fond of this practice and would try to come up with ways of scaring off the spectators, simulating violent arguments with his actors, tossing breakaway chairs and bottles, faking a shootout, anything to clear the crowd. Without knowing it, Ulmer was made to play a part in one of these stunts involving a staged fight, a series of gunshots, and all lights on the set going off. As Wyler recounts, “When the lights came on again, one of the fellows was lying sprawled in his blood and Edgar stood over him, dumbfounded, with a gun in his hand. He didn’t know how he had gotten the gun. As he stood there watching his ‘victim’ in horror, a studio sheriff, who was in on it, put a hand on his shoulder, telling him he was under arrest for murder.”16 Ulmer allegedly fainted on the spot; when he awakened and was informed that it was nothing but a bad joke, he fainted again.\n\n30\n\n|\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins\n\nFIGURE 9.\n\nA Hollywood portrait, 1925. Courtesy of Edgar G. Ulmer Preservation Corp.\n\nAmong the Ulmer family memorabilia from the early years in Hollywood is an elegant photo portrait of the aspiring filmmaker from 1925, taken at a studio in Los Angeles, that he chose to send home to his mother in Vienna, perhaps as proof (a “Lebenszeichen,” or sign of life) of his arrival on the West Coast. It shows a handsome young man, with waves of thick brown hair and inquisitive dark eyes, in a crisp white shirt—open at the neck, as a true Californian might wear at the time—and a deliber-\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins |\n\n31\n\nate, focused gaze. In sending the picture home to Vienna, he included a carefully worded dedication, written not in German, but in English, the language of his newly adopted home: “My dear Mother from a town between desert and pacific ocean, far a way from european culture with thanks and best wishes / Edgar / Hollywood 1925” (Figure 9). Ulmer’s early characterization of Hollywood as a place removed from European culture is significant insofar as it suggests the underlying sense of alienation that someone like himself, who so strongly identified with high art and culture, must have felt working on cheap westerns in 1920s Los Angeles. As he would go on to portray it, in such films as Detour (1945), Hollywood was for him a place precariously situated between the vast, largely uninhabitable Mojave Desert and the lush, alluring, and affluent California coastline. In the 1950s, in an unpublished piece he wrote called “The Director’s Responsibility,” Ulmer again located Hollywood “between the desert and the Pacific Ocean,” but by then, some three decades after the relatively sanguine, clear-eyed photo portrait had been taken, it is a “sad and confused place.”17 As for Ulmer’s pat salutation on the portrait he sent home—“with thanks and best wishes”—it does not suggest much in the way of affection toward his mother; indeed, relations between the two were quite strained throughout the 1920s, when Ulmer officially left Vienna for America and, in keeping with his initial refusal to resettle in his maternal home after returning from Sweden, continued to assert his independence. On May 10, 1927, Henriette writes to her son, from whom she claims not to have heard anything in more than ten months, “Human beings must be able to forgive, and especially their mothers!”18 While couched in her plea for forgiveness, what originally prompted Henriette Ulmer’s letter was the news she stumbled upon that her son had collaborated with the famous German director F. W. Murnau, whose Hollywood debut for Fox Studios, Sunrise (1927), had begun production in September of 1926. What she presumably did not yet know was that her son, only a couple of weeks before the shooting of Sunrise commenced, had married a Southern Californian dancer, Josephine (Joen) Warner—a member of The Fachonettes, a dance troupe that entertained moviegoers at the Paramount Theatre in Los Angeles—at a wedding chapel in Riverside, California.19 Ulmer and Warner were married on August 21, 1926, at the St. Cecilia Chapel of Riverside’s Mission Inn. Their honeymoon would take place in Lake Arrowhead, the chosen location for shooting Sunrise, where, as was often the case for Ulmer, work came before pleasure.\n\n32\n\n|\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins\n\nOn loan from Universal, Ulmer joined forces with German-born Rochus Gliese in set design at Fox, assisting Murnau, also a former Reinhardt pupil, on his high-profile, and much-touted, production. By his account Ulmer had already worked with Gliese on Murnau’s film Die Finanzen des Grossherzogs (The Finances of the Grand Duke, 1924), made for Ufa in the summer of 1923, before Ulmer had yet reached his nineteenth birthday. Its premiere at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo on January 7, 1924, was just a few months before Ulmer’s departure for New York. In her study of Murnau, Lotte Eisner, who is otherwise generally disinclined to believe Ulmer (whom she memorably calls “the greatest liar in the history of cinema”) suggests that indeed he “collaborated” on the film.20 In February 1927 Ernst Chaparral, an editor at the highly influential German trade daily Film-Kurier, filed a report from Hollywood—perhaps the same report that eventually reached Henriette Ulmer’s hands in Vienna—about the shooting of Murnau’s Sunrise. He recounts a tour of the film locations, which he took with colleagues from a few other Berlin newspapers. “We are led,” he writes, “by the raven-dark, curly-headed, youthfully enthusiastic assistant of Gliese, Herr Ullmer [sic], a student of Max Reinhardt, who tries to pull one on us—more is the pity—regarding the joke of the 400,000 dollar production costs. We are poorly guided, as the sudden cries for help soon indicate. The apparently solid and dry, clay-like edge of the road is a gooey swamp, from which the B.Z. [Berliner Zeitung] and the FilmKurier have to fish out the Berliner Tageblatt.”21 The Germans, who partly resented the fact that Murnau had left Berlin for Hollywood and that he commanded such an extravagant budget, were particularly eager to follow the production. But the American press also paid attention and highlighted some of the same aspects. A report in the New York Times, published soon after Chaparral’s dispatch, announced that the construction of the studio set alone cost $200,000 (considerably more money than the bottom line on the vast majority of Ulmer’s subsequent production budgets).22 The collaboration with Gliese proved especially fruitful for Ulmer, who considered him a “partner, a fantastic designer and camera builder” (B 567). Gliese, whose set design for Sunrise earned an Oscar nomination, had worked on several early German film productions, including the second Golem film, Der Golem und die Tänzerin (The Golem and the Dancer, 1917), on which he served as assistant to director Paul Wegener. For Ulmer the significance of Sunrise, one of the greatest pictures Murnau ever made and, in Ulmer’s words, “the only picture\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins |\n\n33\n\nMurnau himself counted” (B 565), cannot be overestimated. The film, based on Hermann Sudermann’s short story “Die Reise nach Tilsit” (The Journey to Tilsit, 1917), blends European and American styles from the Straßenfilm to the early Hollywood melodrama and pits traditional life in the provinces against its radiant counterpart in the big city. The blissful harmony—or dreadful tedium—of family life between the nameless Man (George O’Brien) and Woman (Janet Gaynor) in the country is interrupted, much as in a classic horror film, by the intrusion of an outsider, the Woman from the City (Margaret Livingston—who, as chance would have it, bore a striking resemblance to Ulmer’s first wife, Joen Warner).23 Murnau casts these two worlds in stark opposition, opening the film with a brilliant montage, à la Walter Ruttmann’s Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Großstadt (Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, 1927), and having the city woman lure away the man of the country, indulging him in fantasies of urban decadence. To achieve this contrast most effectively, Murnau relied on highquality production design, much of it pioneered in Weimar Germany, as a means of depicting the separate worlds. As Lotte Eisner remarks, “Gliese [and, by extension, Ulmer working with him] had created every kind of landscape, from fields and meadows, through an industrial area and the sparse gardens of the suburbs to the city itself.”24 Monroe Lathrop’s rave review of Murnau’s “New Masterpiece,” published in the Los Angeles Evening Express the day after its West Coast premiere, explicitly credits “the art and camera effects to Rochus Gliese and Edgar Ulmer,” attributing to them a key role in the overall success of the film, which in Lathrop’s words is “to be classed among the cinema masterpieces in sustained beauty, in imagination and in cumulative emotional power as a whole.”25 Murnau’s personal aesthetic and his highly cultivated approach to the craft of filmmaking won over countless admirers. In her study of the German filmmaker, Eisner cites Ulmer’s assessment of working with him on Sunrise, highlighting the unusually collaborative nature of the enterprise. As part of her analysis she includes extracts from an interview she conducted with Ulmer on his tenure with Murnau: “He was a great purist who worked under a sort of hypnosis. . . . ‘Good is not good enough.’ It was the sort of leitmotiv of his art.”26 The lessons that Ulmer learned while working with Murnau—the obsessive emphasis, for example, on the aesthetic over mere commercial considerations—would stick. Indeed, four decades later Andrew Sarris would brand Ulmer “the executor of the Murnau estate.”27 One can recognize traces of the German master in several of Ulmer’s subsequent\n\n34\n\n|\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins\n\nfilms, starting with The Black Cat, which contains obvious allusions to the visual mastery of his pioneering work (e.g., Nosferatu and The Last Laugh), and leading up to his Mexican-themed western The Naked Dawn (1955), a film that is, in John Belton’s words, “a reworking of Murnau’s Sunrise—Santiago, with the lure of money for the husband and tales of exotic Veracruz for the wife, taking the part of Murnau’s Woman from the City.”28 Not only does that film present a plausible “reworking,” but it also picks up on several of Ulmer’s own recurrent themes: the false promise of material wealth; the romantic wanderings of a lonely hero; and the struggle to remain loyal to a more noble, if less profitable, calling. Many of these themes had a place in Ulmer’s personal life as well. Not long after Murnau’s film premiered in Hollywood, in late November 1927, Ulmer began to feel the pull toward Europe and toward the theater. Sometime early in the next year, he traveled back to Berlin with Gliese—Ulmer’s wife Joen also accompanied them but would return to California by 1929, after becoming pregnant—where they worked together on the set design of Max Reinhardt’s 1928 acclaimed staging of Ferdinand Bruckner’s Die Verbrecher (The Criminals) at the Deutsches Theater. Though he often claimed to have had extensive involvement in other Reinhardt productions at Theater in der Josefstadt from the early 1920s onward, Ulmer’s contribution to Bruckner’s play actually matches the historical record.29 The play debuted in late October 1928 and ran until early February of the following year. During this time Ulmer also found work on a couple of minor German film productions for Ideal-Film and Merkur-Film, ancillary companies connected to Heinrich Nebenzahl’s more prestigious Nero-Film. He is credited, for example, as Bildassistent, or production assistant, on Louis Ralph’s adventure film, written by Curt (then still “Kurt”) Siodmak, Flucht in die Fremdenlegion (Escape to the Foreign Legion, 1929). He also earned a credit as set builder on Robert Land’s Spiel um den Mann (Play around a Man, 1929).30 In Billy Wilder’s contemporary account of the young film scene in Berlin and his creation—together with Ulmer, Siodmak, and others—of the coffeehouse collective Filmstudio 1929, a oneoff production company cobbled together by crewmembers and theater impresario Moriz Seeler, he places Ulmer’s arrival in Berlin around the time that he would have worked on these other, more marginal productions. In Wilder’s thumbnail sketch, “Edgar Ulmer, 23 [sic] years old, arrived from Hollywood half a year ago. Worked as a set designer on Murnau’s Sunrise.”31\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins |\n\n35\n\nA LEGENDARY COLLABORATION IN LATE-WEIMAR GERMANY\n\nShot on the eve of the Great Depression, with essentially no budget to speak of, an equally modest cast of amateur actors, a relatively untested, unknown crew, and no major studio backing, the late silent film Menschen am Sonntag (People on Sunday) has a production history like no other of its era. After the more seasoned director Rochus Gliese abruptly abandoned the project, merely a few days into the shoot, the picture was codirected by Robert Siodmak and Ulmer, neither of whom had ever directed a full-length feature film on his own. It was more or less scripted, though not in any formal sense, by Billy (then still “Billie”) Wilder, with story input from Kurt Siodmak. The camera was operated by veteran special effects technician Eugen Schüfftan—who would later, after making his way to Hollywood, become a frequent collaborator of Ulmer’s during the 1940s—with assistance from Fred Zinnemann, and the project was produced by Filmstudio 1929 with nominal support from Nero-Film boss, and maternal uncle to Curt and Robert Siodmak, Heinrich Nebenzahl. Almost every person originally associated with the film—in particular, Ulmer, the Siodmak brothers, and Billy Wilder—would later, after migration to Hollywood and after the film’s cultural cachet had accrued over time, take more credit for the film than the record allows.32 In an interview in 1970, for example, Robert Siodmak effectively denied Wilder’s involvement, insisting that he worked no more than an hour on the production—his sole idea, in Siodmak’s recollection, was that Annie, the model girlfriend in the film, should stay home in bed—and claimed that Ulmer, after eight days on the shoot, returned to America. He asserted, moreover, that Ulmer really only worked one day. “On the first day,” remembers Siodmak, “he wanted to take the thing away from me.”33 Retrospective accounts of this kind differ quite radically, even those told by the same person. In Siodmak’s posthumously published memoir, Zwischen Berlin und Hollywood (Between Berlin and Hollywood), for instance, he refers to Ulmer as his “co-director” and maintains that Ulmer had his true interests at heart.34 For his part, Ulmer, who claims to have “organized” the entire production, and to have bankrolled it with money brought from the United States, remembered it as a truly collaborative undertaking: “Our main weapon was that everyone could contribute his bit; even the assistant Zinnemann was allowed to participate in the discussion.”35 Many years later, in Gerald Koll’s documentary on the making of the film, Weekend\n\n36\n\n|\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins\n\nam Wannsee (Weekend at the Wannsee, 2000), Brigitte Borchert, who plays the girl from the Electrola shop, remarks, with perhaps less of a personal stake: “They didn’t have a script or anything. . . . We’d sit at a nearby table while they’d decide what to do that day. . . . It was completely improvised.”36 By her account, Wilder’s main function on the set was to hold a sun reflector. Contemporary journalistic accounts of the shoot add a few critical details and offer further testimony about who was actually involved. During the early weeks of production, in July 1929, a pair of articles published in the Weimar Berlin popular press reported on the unconventional character of the work—its programmatic working title was “So ist es und nicht anders” (This is how it is, and no different)—offering, much like a press kit would do, short profiles of the cast and crew. In the Filmspiegel supplement of the Berliner Tageblatt on July 25, 1929, Delia Arnd-Steinitz discusses the initial screen tests at Berlin’s Thielplatz, not far from the Grunewald forest, and the revolutionary decision on the part of the newly founded Filmstudio 1929 (she names Seeler, Ulmer, and Robert Siodmak as the founders) to use amateurs as a means of expressing real-life authenticity. “The plot,” she writes, “should come as close as possible to reality, to the natural course of our days; the events, moods, and conflicts of everyday life should be represented without kitsch, pathos, or sentimentality.”37 Accompanying the article are several photos from the ongoing production, one of which shows Ulmer, together with Siodmak, Gliese (still present in the early days of the shoot), and Seeler, taking the screen test of two of the film’s amateur actors, Christl Ehlers and Erwin Splettstößer. Five days later, in another article published in the afternoon edition of the Berliner Zeitung, the cultural reporter Pem (a.k.a. Paul Erich Marcus, a regular at the Romanisches Café, where the project was allegedly first hatched), filed a dispatch, “Film mit Dilettanten” (Film with dilettantes), on the next phase of shooting on location at the Nikolassee train station and at the surrounding beaches and forests of Wannsee and Grunewald. He provides an overview of the film crew, often misspelling or mistaking their names altogether, and giving a cheeky summary of their professional background: “Script: Billie Wider [sic], coffeehouse-born journalist and gagman . . . Direction: Rochus Gliese, actually a set designer, but he doesn’t need to design the Grunewald. . . . Set professional and jack-of-all-trades: Fred [sic] Ulmer, a fiery business hater [Betriebshasser] and Hollywood-studio connoisseur.”38 Such descriptions, while meant more as humorous caricatures than profes-\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins |\n\n37\n\nsional bona fides, are revealing nonetheless; Pem’s portrayal of Ulmer as having both a strong antiestablishment attitude and the insight of someone who had already amassed experience working in Hollywood is itself illuminating. Finally, in the same article the accompanying photo from the shoot on location shows Seeler, Schüfftan, and Ulmer, all of them identified in the caption, huddled around a camera in the middle of the forest. “Here something is evolving,” writes Pem, commenting on the transitional and possibly transformative quality of the project, “which can only be thought of as an experiment, a mere signpost; and that’s already saying something in our schematized and calibrated age in which technology has grown at a rate over life.”39 In terms of the formal innovations of the film, People on Sunday takes the city symphony film, commonly associated with Ruttmann’s Berlin—and, in the international arena, with Alberto Cavalcanti’s Rien que les heures (1926) and Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera (1929), among others—in a new direction. Unconcerned with merely capturing a “Querschnitt,” or cross-section, of the German metropolis, the film cannily blends avant-garde documentary and narrative cinema into something that is less abstract and far more improvised, natural, and overtly romantic than its predecessors. While it draws in part on the once dominant trend of Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity), with its periodic riffs on popular advertising, design, photography, and technology—and, more generally, on the wider contemporaneous trend in Europe and America of capturing the pulsating life of a city on celluloid—its main conceit is its utter defiance of prevailing modes and industry norms. The film turns its back on studio production, instead allowing the city and its many inviting locations (its boulevards and cafés, lakes, boardwalks, beaches, and other places of leisure and recreation) to substitute for the standard reliance on sets, while at the same time allowing amateurs to play the roles otherwise reserved for film stars. It is, as we are told at the outset, “a film without actors.” The premise of the film couldn’t be more basic: in the heart of the city, near the Bahnhof-Zoo subway station, amid the intense bustle of commerce and traffic, a modern boy-meets-girl story seems to be transpiring before our eyes. A chance encounter between two young, slightly aimless urban strollers results in an impromptu scheme for a Sunday outing, which, after each one shows up with a best friend in tow, becomes a frolicsome double date at one of Berlin’s nearby lakes (Figure 10); the fifth member of the cast, in a witty twist attributed to Wilder, oversleeps, missing the entire outing. What ultimately unfolds in just a little over an\n\n38\n\n|\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins\n\nLeisure world: a late-Weimar double date at the lake.

We see the four protagonists listening to music, swimming, enjoying a picnic, riding a pedal boat, alternating their love interests, and trying in general to squeeze the most out of the day. The style of the film is natural, the setting unpretentious, and the atmosphere, perhaps the core of the entire film, shamelessly flirtatious. More than anything, a new kind of directness, an unmediated, unvarnished representation of everyday life as it is experienced by members of a young, urban consumer class is what the filmmakers seem to have been after, in marked contrast to the spectacular big-budget pictures being produced at Ufa at the time. Among the most evocative working titles, in addition to “So ist es und nicht anders,” were those of a universal appeal, such as “Sommer 29” (Summer ’29) and “Junge Leute wie alle” (Young people like us), a wink at the critics and target audience. By casting amateurs in roles based on their true day jobs and with their real names still attached to them, all from the minor professions of\n\nToward a Cinema at the Margins |\n\n39\n\na burgeoning young, urban workforce, the film crew was able to offer an unusually honest, verité rendering of their world to an audience that was preoccupied with the same values, social mores, dreams, and anxieties as the protagonists on the screen. In the opening credits, following the initial announcement, made via intertitle, that the film’s five lead characters appear here before the camera for the first time and are today back at their old jobs, we are immediately introduced to them in their respective pursuits: the jovial taxi driver Erwin Splettstößer, seated behind the wheel of a cab bearing the Berlin license plate “IA 10088”; the charming record salesgirl Brigitte Borchert in front of the Electrola shop on Kurfürstendamm—where Moriz Seeler is said to have discovered her—who last month, so the title reads, sold 150 copies of the hit song “In einer kleinen Konditorei” (In a little pastry shop);40 the tall, dark and slender Wolfgang von Waltershausen, a former officer, farmer, antique dealer, and gigolo, currently working as a traveling wine merchant, puffing on his cigarette with an air of obvious self-assuredness; the very chic, urbane Christl Ehlers, who enters what appears to be a casting studio and who, we are told, “wears down her heels as a film extra”; and, finally, Annie Schreyer, a model, reclining, filing her nails, and waiting in vain for the next job. In a similar manner to the early Soviet avant-garde—Ulmer claims to have taken the chief inspiration from Vertov—the film has its characters serve as a series of social types, easily recognizable by the audience. Writing in Weimar Germany’s Communist Party newspaper, Die rote Fahne, critic Alfred Kemeny extolled the fact that the film evolved “outside the German capitalist film industry” and underscored the influence of Russian cinema: “the plot is plain, as if simply carved out of life, and that here, as in the Russian films, human beings, real, real, real [sic] human beings ‘play’ [their true roles].”41 The film’s five leads participate actively in forming the very mass culture that they represent onscreen, a culture with which Weimar-era cinemagoers readily identified. “"
