        "text": "At the opening party of a colossal, but poorly constructed, office building, a massive fire breaks out that threatens to destroy the tower and everyone in it.\n\nBased on the true story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a group of elite firefighters who risk everything to protect a town from a historic wildfire.\n\nTwo feuding siblings carrying on a heroic family tradition as Chicago firefighters. But when a puzzling series of arson attacks is reported, they are forced to set aside their differences to solve the mystery surrounding these crimes.\n\nThe sequel to the 1991 hit, follows an investigator with the Chicago F.D., who has to track down an arms dealer who use deadly fires as a distraction.\n\nA ruthless pyromaniac is on the loose in a southern village of Norway. They don't know he's not a stranger, but one of them. We follow him, the fire brigade chief's own son, spreading fear in secret.\n\nInto the Fire follows the story of Walter Hartwig, a lieutenant in the New York City Harbor Unit, who finally comes to terms with what is really important about this life.\n\nIn the year 2047, a fierce battle rages between a ruthless villain and an android resistance group. Identical twin brothers - one a jazz musician and former cop, the other a troubled gun for hire with a gambling problem - find themselves caught in the middle.\n\nFirefighter Jesse Graves has to save ornithologist Jennifer and other people caught in a forest fire, which was set up by the lawyer of convicted killer Earl Shaye, who escaped from the prison with several of his inmates posing as firefighters to recover thirty-seven million dollars in stashed loot.\n\nWhen a crummy hotel burns down in Australia, the American co-owner tries to find out whether or not the fire was deliberately set or just an accident.\n\nOn November 18, 1947, as a fire took hold in the basement of Ballantynes department store in Christchurch, 500 employees kept working and hundreds of shoppers roamed through the showrooms or chatted over tea and cakes in the cafe. Staff were eagerly awaiting a visit from reigning Miss New Zealand Mary Wootton and management were quick to reassure staff and customers alike that, despite a bit of smoke, there was nothing to worry about. Hours later, 41 people were dead.\n\nFollowing the lives of firefighters as they deal with joys and hardships, both on the job and with their own personal lives.\n\nA firefighter, injured and trapped in a burning building, has flashbacks of his life as he drifts in and out of consciousness. Meanwhile, fellow firefighters led by the Chief attempt to rescue him.\n\nA convict starts a fire in a forest to cover his escape, but the fire goes out of control and threatens to destroy a small mountain community."
