        "text": "One of the most famous images in film history comes from a movie that no one but silent movie nerds ever watches: in 1923's Safety Last!, Harold Lloyd hung from the hands of a clock that hung from a set that sat on top of 908 S. Broadway in Downtown LA, and swung into America's hearts. The movie confirmed Lloyd's star status; he became one of the richest comedians of the silent era and built Los Angeles's most ridiculously lavish movie star estate, Greenacres, in 1929. Safety Last!, released on April 1, 1923, tells the stirring tale of an idiot from Indiana who climbs a building so he doesn't have to tell his girlfriend he's not rich. It was shot mainly in Hollywood and Downtown, and many of the places it features are still around today, incredibly, but Safety Last! is set in an entirely different Los Angelesâ€”in the early '20s, streetcars were packed, Downtown was bustling, Hollywood was dusty, and LAPD officers refrained from shooting drunk guys. And so here we've mapped the filming locations of Safety Last! (with a big debt to John Bengtson's Chaplin-Keaton-Lloyd film locations (and more) blog, which includes a handy Downtown walking tour among many other resources); it's on Hulu Plus if you want to see it yourself.\n\nRead More"
