When first seen he is rather gauche, not exactly aloof but somewhat withdrawn from the all-male student company around him. As he discovers romance for the first time in the quite lovely form of Norma Shearer, he blossoms. Here, we have what Sigmund Romberg described in his original-source operetta as \"the sunshine of our happy youth.\" Of course, it all fades away as the demands of society intervene. Life changes so seldom for the better, as Ramon Novarro himself was to discover. Once the prince becomes a king, once the actor becomes a star, he must, if not withdraw from the all-male companionship, at least keep it securely hidden from the prying eyes of society. The establishment, be it the studio system or the Catholic Church, makes demands on public figures, and those demands can lead to tragic consequences. In The Student Prince, Ramon Novarro loses the one love of his life. In real life, the actor lost the majority of those whom he had loved through the years, along with the ability to cope, and, ultimately, his life. This story of human frailty is recounted here in carefully considered and well-documented style by Andre Scares. It might perhaps be regarded as the gay version of An American Tragedy—or, in view of Novarro's roots, A PanAmerican Tragedy.\n\nI never met Ramon Novarro. He died three years before I came to the United States and began interviewing and socializing with the last members of the silent film community. When I was a young man in London in the\n\nx\n\n• Foreword\n\n1960s, my interest in silent film was such that I did belong to both the Rudolph Valentino Memorial Guild and the Ramon Novarro Film Club. The guild was a somewhat more formal group, with monthly film screenings at the elegant home of direct-voice medium Leslie Flint, who would converse on a regular basis with Valentino (busy in the other world, appearing in new musicals composed by Ivor Novello and speaking English better than he ever did in this life). The Ramon Novarro Film Club was distinctly more homey, and its members, I realize in hindsight, less affected. It would meet at the homes of the various members, including John Lanchbery, then principal conductor of the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden. When Novarro was killed, John worried how his film club members would react to news of his homosexuality, of which we were both aware. He need not have been concerned; the ladies of the fan club simply ignored it, preferring to believe that their hero had been murdered by a couple of thugs who had invaded his property. On one occasion, I invited the Ramon Novarro Film Club to my apartment to view a 16mm print of a ten-minute interview with Novarro conducted for the BBC by Philip Jenkinson. My projector failed to work, and Leslie Flint, who lived in the same building, graciously invited the film club to watch the film in a minitheater previously dedicated only to the productions of Rudolph Valentino. Thus, for the first time since Novarro was an extra and Valentino was the star of The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in 1921, the two actors shared a screen—and afternoon tea was also served. In retrospect, I feel great affection for Audrey Homan, who ran the Ramon Novarro Film Club, and for the members whose names I no longer remember. They were a fine group of ordinary individuals, devoted to Novarro's memory. In many ways, Novarro was as decent and as caring as his fan club members. I can still recall his telephoning Audrey, and all of us gathering around to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to him on what turned out to be the last birthday celebration of his life. When I did make it to Hollywood, one of the first stars to invite me to her home on a regular basis was Novarro's (and Valentino's) leading lady Alice Terry. Somewhat plump, and far from being as reclusive as one would be led to believe, Alice was full of good humor and funny stories relating to her career and that of her director husband, Rex Ingram. She had been a close friend to Novarro from the 1920s until his death, and he was the one individual of whom she said little and never joked.\n\nForeword\n\n•\n\nxi\n\nAlice Terry once remarked to me that the biggest thing Valentino ever did was to die. His early death gave him immortality, which a continuing career and a likely disastrous debut in talkies would not have done. Strangely, Novarro's death also gave him a form of immortality. He is remembered not as one of the best leading men of silent films, who made an easy transition to sound, but rather because of the brutal circumstances of his death. With this biography, Andre Scares sets the record straight. He provides a full account of Novarro's early years in Mexico and the United States, his close ties to his family, and his first efforts to enter the world of entertainment. Through meticulous research in the payroll records of Metro and MGM, through a viewing of Novarro's extant films, a reading of the trade and fan publications, and conversations with those from the period still alive, Andre Scares offers the definitive record of Ramon Novarro's rise from extra to Hollywood star. That image is never obscured by fan worship. The author notes both Novarro's strengths and faults as an actor. I have always felt that under Rex Ingram's direction, Novarro proves his worth as a performer. He is not bad in the title role of Ben-Hur, but, one has to admit, he is a little flabby in the seminude scenes. He lacks the muscular definition of George Walsh, the first actor assigned to the role. To his credit, Novarro can, and does, play sailors and football players at MGM despite his obvious failings in the physicality of the roles and his lack of sympathy with the characterizations. Ramon Novarro is a star, but he is also a leadingo man to some of the finest actresses of the period, from his most frequent (and best), Alice Terry, to Greta Garbo. Novarro's career aside, Andre Scares has also managed to provide as definitive as possible a record of the actor's private life. He does not stoop to cheap gossip or innuendo, but documents what can be proven, having talked to Novarro's family, former costars, and others—including, for the first time, the convicted killers. Incredibly, the author has also unearthed parts of Novarro's unpublished memoirs (with the assistance of the actor's literary executor, Leonard Shannon) and his personal correspondence in libraries and in private hands. These sources provide the reader with a unique account of Ramon Novarro's thoughts and deeds. Because he was a public figure, Novarro's problems as a gay man were greater than those of other homosexual men during that period. A visit to a gay bar or a casual pickup on Hollywood Boulevard was out of the question. He could only be seen at gay nightspots if he was in the company\n\nxii\n\n•\n\nForeword\n\nof a woman, usually the accommodating Alice Terry. (Alice served as a beard so often that when another gay actor, Barry Norton, was seen escorting her around town, a gossip columnist in The Hollywood Reporter asked whom Norton was trying to fool.) Aside from one long-term relationship with publicist and entertainment journalist Herbert Howe, Novarro enjoyed no lasting affairs; in later years, his only solace lay in young men obtained through a male escort agency. Two of those young men were found guilty in Ramon Novarro's death. It was a tragedy for all concerned—not just Novarro—and it was so unnecessary. His killing is symbolic of the danger that gay men of his generation faced. It is not accused killers Paul and Tom Ferguson who should have been on trial in 1969 but American society. It is all here in Beyond Paradise, Read it and weep for a man and a generation. And thank Andre Scares for providing us with the opportunity to understand, to sympathize with, and perhaps to chastise the Mexican film star of the 1920s and 1930s, the closeted gay man, the guilt-ridden human being who was Ramon Novarro.\n\nPREFACE\n\nO\n\nn Halloween morning 1968, radio and television newscasts announced the discovery of actor Ramon Novarro's badly beaten, bloodied corpse in his Spanish-style Hollywood Hills home. The grisly news shocked those who knew Novarro personally as well as the millions of older moviegoers who decades earlier had admired the star of Een-Hur, Scaramouch, and The Student Prince. At the time of his death a half-forgotten figure of another era, the sixty-nine-year-old Novarro had been one of the most popular film performers of the 1920s and early 1930s—and filmdom's first Latin American star. By the late 1960s, however, Novarro's acting career consisted mainly of guest spots in television series. If it were not for the horrendous manner in which he was killed, his passing would have received scant notice. As it was, Novarro's death made front-page news the world over. More than a thousand mourners passed by his bier while his body lay in state in a downtown Los Angeles mortuary. In the days that followed, two young brothers were arrested and charged with Novarro's murder. Each told the police that he was not responsible for Novarro's death, and that they had gone to the actor's house to \"hustle\" him. Shortly thereafter, news reports about the police investigation disclosed that the romantic hero who on-screen had made love to some of Hollywood's most glamorous stars—from Alice Terry and Barbara La Marr to Greta Garbo, Myrna Loy, Joan Crawford, and Norma Shearer—was offscreen sexually attracted to men. This revelation, at a time when homosexuality was still considered either a serious psychological disorder or a form of sexual perversion, came as another shock to many, including some who thought they had known Novarro intimately. Although the actor had frequently asserted\n\nxiv\n\n•\n\nPreface\n\nin the press that he would never marry and in later years had openly declared that marriage was \"one mistake I did not make,\" fans and some friends were aghast that the deeply religious man described in the Variety obituary as a \"gentle, gentlemanly version\" of Valentino had been a homosexual. Granted, Novarro's reputation had not been spotless. In the last three decades of his life, several encounters with the law for drunken driving had been widely reported. Even so, the Novarro image ingrained in the public's mind was a composite of respectability: the consummate and well-liked professional; the generous son and brother who had supported his large Mexican family after becoming a Hollywood star in the early 1920s; and especially the ardent Catholic who during his life had more than once seriously considered the priesthood or the monastery. A series of lurid revelations during the trial of the two accused killers further shattered Novarro's old public image as a paragon of virtue. In the months and years to come, those disclosures would lead to outlandish rumors about the manner of Novarro's death and to distortions about Novarro's life and character. These fables have overshadowed his professional accomplishments and his historical importance as the first Latin American performer to succeed in Hollywood. MGM's top male star at the dawn of the sound era and one of the biggest international box-office attractions of his day, Novarro was also a darling of the critics of the 1920s and 1930s. The New York Herald Tribune's highly respected Richard Watts, Jr., expressing the opinion of most of his colleagues, once declared the Mexican star \"one of the most charming, intelligent, tasteful and generally expert of screen players, and he is so attractive a performer that he seems competent even in the midst of an atrocity.\" Despite Novarro's highly successful transition to sound films, aided by a fine singing voice, serious miscasting and formulaic roles in several \"atrocities\" eventually cooled the ardor of film audiences. Since his best work has generally been unavailable until fairly recently, Novarro has largely been forgotten by modern film audiences and film historians alike. Yet the truth remains that no other Latin American performer—from Gilbert Roland and Dolores del Rio to Ricardo Montalban and Anthony Quinn—has ever reached the prominence held by Ramon Novarro at the peak of his career.\n\nBeyond Paradise\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nONE\n\nMexican Roots\n\nG\n\net Out Your Maps! And look up Buango [sic],\" proclaimed a geographically challenged fan magazine writer in the January 1923 issue of Photoplay. \"Never heard of it? Neither did we. But it's destined for immortality.\" That city—actually Durango, Mexico—was the birthplace of Ramon Novarro (born Samaniego), Metro Pictures' fast-ascending romantic star. According to Metro's publicity department, in the veins of the handsome young Mexican heartthrob ran the blood of the earliest Spanish conquistadores mingled with that of Aztec royalty, a studio-created myth that only partly matched Novarro's actual family history.\n\nIn the ninth century, a half-Moorish prince of the Iberian kingdom of Navarra erected a castle near the village of Samaniego (possibly of Celtic origin), a few miles north of the Ebro River in modern Spain's Basque country. In time, his descendants, who became one of the most renowned noble families in the region, adopted the village designation as their own surname, thus giving birth to the Samaniego lineage. Through intermarriages with other blue-blooded families, the Samaniegos spread across the northern section of the Iberian Peninsula, where the Samaniego men often held high offices reserved for the nobility. Ramon Novarro's direct ancestors came from the small Castilian town of Burgos, from which two brothers emigrated to the New World in the early seventeenth century. The Samaniegos' long journey from Europe to New Spain, a territory that encompassed all the land under Spanish rule north of the Isthmus of Panama, occurred approximately one century after the arrival of the first Spanish conquistadores. Eduardo Samaniego, Ramon Novarro's youngest\n\n2\n\n. BEYOND PARADISE\n\nbrother, recounted in his memoirs that his ancestors settled in the town of Queretaro, about 160 miles northwest of Mexico City. There, Eduardo asserts, they helped in the fight against the Otomi Indians, for which service the Samaniegos were awarded the title of counts. By the time of Mexico's independence from Spanish rule in 1821, Novarro's branch of the Samaniegos had settled in Bavispe, a small, desolate village in the northwestern Sonora Province. Don Florentino Samaniego served as commander of the local presidio, while his wife, Maria Josefa Delgado, of the influential Ortiz family of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico, tended their five children—one of whom was to become Novarro's paternal grandfather, Mariano Samaniego Delgado (in Mexico, following the Spanish custom, the mother's maiden name is placed after the father's surname). In 1838, after Don Florentino was killed during an Apache raid, six-yearold Mariano traveled two hundred miles northeast with his widowed mother and his siblings to El Paso del Norte (known today as Ciudad Juarez, or simply Juarez), in the neighboring state of Chihuahua. Their final destination was the home of Mariano's maternal grandmother, then living with her brother, the revered Father Ramon Ortiz. As one of the most important and influential personages in the region, Mariano's great-uncle was at the center of the social life of El Paso del Norte. Throughout the years, Father Ortiz shared his spacious house— surrounded by seven acres of orchards, vineyards, and corrals—with two older sisters, several nephews and nieces, his personal servants, and numerous guests. Besides his religious and social duties, the padre was actively involved in political affairs, even organizing an armed resistance to the invading American armies during the Mexican War in the mid-1840s. One consequence of that war that was to directly affect the Samaniegos was the forfeiture of Mexican territory to the United States. After losing Alta California and Nuevo Mexico to American forces, Mexico ceded all territories north of both the Rio Grande and the Gila River to its northern neighbor. This border shift, certified by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, would haunt the Samaniegos for generations as a later change in the course of the Rio Grande resulted in the loss of their land in the JuarezEl Paso area to the American government.\n\nWith the financial assistance of his great-uncle Father Ortiz, the young Mariano Samaniego received his education at a seminary in Durango, located approximately four hundred miles south of El Paso del Norte. He also studied in Mexico City, and a few years later left for Europe to attend\n\nMexican Roots\n\n• 3\n\nmedical school at the University of Paris. While in France, he befriended Felipe Perez Gavilan (his was a composite surname), with whom he shared the same nationality, professional interests, and upper-class background. In I860, Mariano—now Dr. Samaniego—and Felipe returned together to Mexico, finding their native country again embroiled in warfare. A threeyear civil war, which pitted the clerical-military institutions against those who sought to break the establishments political grip, was nearmg its end. One year later, France's interventionist army and the puppet government of Ferdinand Maximilian became the new foes. Throughout that crisis, Dr. Samaniego served as a surgeon in the Republican Army of the North under the command of General Luis Terrazas, one of Chihuahua's most powerful men and the state's governor for several terms. Dr. Samaniego married Maria Carmen Siqueiros during that time, settling his wife in El Paso del Norte, whereas Felipe settled in Durango after his marriage to Rosa Guerrero, an alleged descendant of Aztec nobility. Following the withdrawal of the last French troops from Mexico in March 1867 and the execution of Maximilian in June of that year, peace was finally declared. Once relieved of active duty, Dr. Samaniego returned to El Paso del Norte, where, for the next three decades, he was to practice medicine and dentistry on both sides of the Mexican-American border. During that period, he would also serve in the Chihuahua legislature, function three times as interim state governor, act as the state representative in the Mexican National Congress, and serve as the Mexican vice-consul in Franklin, Texas, just across the Rio Grande from El Paso del Norte. In addition, he fathered six children, one of whom was to become Ramon Novarro's father—Mariano Nicolas Samaniego, born in 1871. Growing up near the U.S. border, the young Mariano spoke fluent English. He attended high school in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and later studied at the University of Pennsylvania's Dental School. In that period, Mariano paid a visit to the Perez Gavilan household while on a business trip to Durango. He was then introduced to Felipe's daughter, the petite brunette Maria Leonor, one year his junior. Gifted with a dramatic soprano voice, Leonor had begun taking voicetraining lessons at the age of seven. She occasionally sang at family parties, but the Perez Gavilans were a traditional well-to-do Mexican family, and a career—especially one onstage—was unthinkable for a respectable woman. Yet, Leonor would never completely abandon singing. At times, she would sit at the piano and sing anas from Tosca or Aida, and in later years she and Novarro would spend hours singing together. Leonor soon established a close rapport with Mariano, a development\n\n4 . BEYOND PARADISE that must have pleased both patriarchs of those two prominent families. The courtship resulted in marriage on October 24, 1892, at about the time of Mariano's graduation from the dental school; after the wedding, the couple settled in Durango, quite possibly so Leonor could remain close to her family.\n\nLying in a fertile valley of the Sierra Madre almost seven thousand feet above sea level, Durango, known as la Perla del Guadiana—the Pearl of the Guadiana Valley—had its origins in the exploitation of iron ore in the surrounding mountains. The riches acquired from the mines were lavishly spent on exquisite colonial edifices, many of which exhibited decorated portals, elaborate arches, and carefully landscaped courtyards and gardens. Some, such as the Juan Jose Zambrano residence—which even housed the millionaire's own private theater—were magnificent palaces that reflected the wealth and power of Durango's elite. In the mid-1890s, Dr. Mariano Samaniego opened a dental office in his new home at 39 de la Septima Calle de Negrete, and according to family lore, he quickly earned a reputation as one of the best dentists in that town of nearly thirty thousand inhabitants. Besides housing Dr. Samamego's busy practice, the residence consisted of a kitchen, a vestibule, a bathroom, a living room, and several bedrooms. Corridors of polished tiles led to three inner courts, each centered on a pileta, a small water receptacle surrounded by pots of flowers, beside which a shade tree grew. In the back, a mirador—a wide, sheltered terrace—overlooked an orchard of orange, cherry, peach, and other fruit trees. Along the perimeter, vine-covered walls, iron-bound doors, and shuttered windows kept the house cool and secluded. Emilio, the Samaniegos' first child, was born in 1895. He was followed by twelve siblings: Guadalupe, Rosa, Ramon, Leonor, Mariano, Maria de la Luz, Antonio, Jose, Felipe, Carmen, Angel, and Eduardo, born in 1911, when Senora Samaniego was thirty-nine years old. Like most nations of the time, Mexico had high birth rates and high infant- and child-mortality rates. Unsanitary conditions and inadequate medical care made childhood deaths commonplace even in wealthier households. Emilio died of scarlet fever before his fifth birthday, while diphtheria was the likely cause of Felipe's death at the age of three. Since Emilio had been the firstborn and Felipe the tenth, Senora Samaniego referred to their early deaths as \"tithes\" she had paid—diezmos y primicias, the first of the crop and a tenth of the remainder given to the Church. Ramon, who became the oldest surviving male child by the time he was\n\nMexican Roots\n\n• 5\n\none year old, was born at the family home on the Calle de Negrete on the morning of February 6, 1899. Numerous sources state that he was baptized with fourteen names but used only Jose Ramon Gil Samaniego after reaching adulthood. Such a profusion of names may conceivably have been given him at his christening, though his birth certificate shows only three names: Ramon Gil Samaniego. While the older girls at the Samaniego household helped in the care of their younger siblings, Ramon was cared for by Senora Samaniego herself. The boy, for his part, endeavored to please his mother, whether performing odd jobs to buy her an engraved gold medal as a memento of a rare singing performance, or developing an appreciation for the things she liked. Mother and son's close bond was made even stronger by those shared interests, one of which was a fondness for music and theater. Ramon was six years old when his mother began teaching him piano, as she envisioned her eldest son becoming a concert pianist. A few years later, his musical education was extended to include voice, and soon he was singing in church choirs. Also at the age of six, a cotton-wigged Ramon performed his first acting piece with sister Guadalupe at their grandmother's birthday party: a recitation of Spanish poet Ramon Campoamor's \"Quien supiera escribir\" (\"If Only I Could Write\"), the tale of an illiterate peasant girl who begs a priest to compose a letter to her sweetheart. Inspired by the warm applause, Ramon later presented a series of puppet shows in a marionette theater, a gift from his mother on his eighth birthday. In those early theatrical endeavors, he was frequently joined by his cousin and fellow theater enthusiast Rafael Perez Gavilan, while the Samaniego girls helped to set the stage by embroidering the minitheater's curtains. Holidays and weekends were often spent at one of the Perez Gavilans' haciendas. The main property was La Hacienda de Navacoyan, on the outskirts of Durango, though Senora Samaniego's La Ochoa and her brother Luis's La Sauceda, which was surrounded by the imposing Sierra Madre range, were also frequent holiday destinations. Years later, Novarro nostalgically recalled \"wonderful summers ... on the family ranch, where we lived out of doors, swam, and rode horseback.\" Although the Samaniego children did not actually live outdoors while at the family haciendas—La Sauceda, for example, possessed a spacious main house, its own church, and cottages for the workers—in those relatively isolated days in rural Mexico (the country's population in 1910 was a little more than fifteen million), it probably felt as though they did. For the children, simple things left lasting impressions. The sighting of African Americans was a thrilling event, as blacks were practically nonexistent\n\n6\n\n• BEYOND PARADISE\n\nin that part of Mexico. In order to glimpse the unusual-looking foreigners, the children would ride on horseback to the train station to wave at the black porters aboard American trains. (Years later, blacks still held a distinct interest for at least one Samaniego. When Novarro met architect Paul Williams at a small cocktail party, he rose to his feet, saying, \"You're the first of your race that I have had the pleasure of meeting. May I shake the hand of so distinguished a member?\" Williams politely obliged.)\n\nAs was the custom in Mexico—especially among the upper classes, which were both spiritually and politically associated with the Catholic Church— religion played a central role in the upbringing of the Samaniego children. Daily mass was an obligation, not a choice. At the haciendas, if the children failed to attend mass in the morning, they were not allowed to go horseback riding in the afternoon. As would be expected, they went to mass assiduously. Following Mexican tradition, Christmas letters were written to the Holy Child, not to Santa Claus; during Easter, the emphasis was not on bunnies and chocolate eggs, but on burning an effigy of Judas. Birthdays were celebrated twice: on the day of one's birth and on the day of one's patron saint (Ramon's other birthday celebration was held on August 31). In accordance with its preeminence as an archdiocese, early-twentiethcentury Durango boasted a vast array of Catholic structures, including the majestic baroque Catedral Basilica Menor, the Church of Santa Ana also in the baroque style, the sanctuaries of Guadalupe and Our Lady of the Angels, and the Church of the Compania. These shrines were not merely tourist attractions or relics of another era; they were real places of worship. Growing up surrounded by those sumptuous examples of religious reverence and by his family's traditional beliefs, Ramon found Catholicism an almost tangible part of his existence. In the Samaniego household, religious devotion was closely intertwined with familial devotion. Each night before going to bed, the children dropped to one knee to receive their mother's blessing, a Catholic ritual suggesting the saintliness of parents. Senora Samaniego, in particular, represented the bastion of faith and tradition in the family, as she was responsible for instilling in her offspring the proper cultural and social mores. According to Herbert Howe, Novarro's future publicist and companion, there was little demonstration of affection in the home. \"Compliments were never paid,\" Howe observed. \"Whatever came, came as a gift of God and to Him only thanks was rendered.\" Howe theorized that such restraint in the expression\n\nMexican Roots\n\n• 7\n\nof tenderness during his formative years might explain Novarro s own lack of warmth in his adult years.\n\nThe Samaniegos' untroubled days were abruptly shattered by a double blow in the early 1910s. Still in his early forties, Dr. Samaniego developed facial neuralgia, a disease that caused sudden, strong shocks in the nerves on the right side of his face. Each time he underwent surgery, some facial nerves had to be removed, which eventually resulted in a severe impairment of his optical nerves. Physically unable to continue his dental practice, Dr. Samaniego had to resort to other sorts of work. He began teaching English at the Institute Juarez, but without the dental office, his income was substantially curtailed. Ramon, the eldest son, was barely in his teens and still too young to find a job. Income from the La Ochoa hacienda surely helped, though in all likelihood the Samaniegos managed to stay financially afloat through the help of their relatives. Another sort of crisis, however, could not be remedied by family intervention. By 1910, President Porfirio Diaz had dominated Mexican politics for more than three decades. But with the passing of the years, Mexicans had become increasingly resentful of the regime's disregard of citizens' rights and the blatant political favoritism shown for Diaz's cronies and foreign interests. Exacerbating the general dissatisfaction, the country's economy had foundered during the first decade of the twentieth century. High inflation and unemployment led to unrest, and as protests mounted, repression intensified. Thus the groundwork was laid for the revolution, which exploded in 1910 after the defeat of landowner and industrialist Francisco E. Madero in that summer's fraudulent presidential election. In November, Madero, who had fled to the United States, led an uprising against the Diaz government, which was brought down several months later. Diaz resigned and left for Paris, but the fighting continued unabated. In their struggle for power, divergent groups of revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries battled one another, while fighting also erupted within the disparate groups themselves. Durango soon became enmeshed in the turmoil. In May 1911, bandits and rebels, many of whom were displaced peasants, attacked the town, while federal soldiers erected barricades throughout the area. The situation briefly improved in the aftermath of Madero's victorious entry into Mexico City, but after Victoriano Huerta, commandant of the federal forces, seized control of the capital from Madero in February 1913, the second phase of the revolution began. Following a siege of forty days in late spring, Durango\n\n8 . BEYOND PARADISE became one of the first state capitals to fall into the hands of anti-Huerta revolutionaries. Learning establishments were closed, including Our Lady of Guadalupe, the school Ramon was attending. A state of anarchy prevailed as rival rebel leaders fought to take control of the city. Houses, stores, and businesses were ransacked, and entire districts went up in flames. Durango's citizens lived in perpetual fear. Stray bullets killed innocent bystanders even inside their homes. A knock at the door in the middle of the night could mean death to anyone who was identified with the wrong political faction. To escape the danger, which was especially grave for a family belonging to the urban elite, the Samaniegos left for Mexico City, where conditions had been somewhat normalized. Once the family was settled with some wealthy relatives, the children started school again. Ramon was sent to the prestigious Institute Cientifico de Mexico, which had been founded by Jesuit priests. This one-story, late-eighteenth-century building was popularly known as the Colegio de los Mascarones, or School of the Big Figureheads, because the effigies atop its portals looked like the sculpted figures on the prows of boats. Fan magazines would later assert that at Mascarones fourteen-year-old Ramon went through military training, developed into an accomplished athlete and track champion, and during breaks from those strenuous physical activities studied music, French, and English. Those probably exaggerated claims can be neither confirmed nor disproved, for the school's records for that tumultuous period have long since disappeared. Months after the Samaniegos' arrival in Mexico City, another counterrevolution broke out. This latest uprising led to Huerta's ouster by Venustiano Carranza and his Constitutionalist Army. Following this latest change in government, news arrived that conditions in Durango had improved. Dr. Samaniego, who was probably excused from military service because of his poor health, decided to return home to check on the family possessions, taking with him Ramon, Angel, and Eduardo. Soon after their arrival in Durango, more fighting erupted, severing all communications between that city and the capital for eleven agonizing months. In the spring of 1915, the family was finally reunited in Durango. Shortly thereafter, Guadalupe and Rosa announced their desire to enter a convent, and they were soon followed by the young Leonor, who felt quite lost after the departure of her two older sisters. Ramon, then sixteen years old, had developed into a rebellious teenager, poking fun at the local townspeople and putting \"questionable ideas\" into the heads of children who had been entrusted to him. But influenced by his sisters' decision, Ramon too began considering the religious life. Years later, he jokingly recalled his wish \"to die a martyr and be canonized.\" He began fasting, sleeping on the floor\n\nMexican Roots\n\n• 9\n\nwithout covering, performing servants' duties, rising daily at five in the morning, and walking around with eyes downcast. Other children started singing \"Ave Maria\" whenever they saw him, \"but I was rapt to Heaven, and did not mind.\" Exaggerated as such a story may be, the young Ramon conceivably decided that only certain types of behavior were appropriate for those truly serious about the teachings of the Church. Catholicism was not something reserved only for morning mass. Faith was to be lived at every moment of one's existence. As an upper-class youth, Ramon may also have been attracted to the high social status of the priesthood. The clergy had lost some of its power since the government of nineteenth-century statesman Benito Juarez, but it was still a wealthy and influential social force in Mexico. Thus, belonging to so revered and respected an institution could be not only an answer to a spiritual call, but also an affirmation of one's social standing. Likewise, the call of the priesthood could also be seen as Ramon's attempt to cling to an older and more traditional social order, an understandable view for a young man who was witnessing the destruction of his way of life. Whatever the underlying motivations may have been at that time, Novarro's faith was to remain constant throughout the years—though his devoutness did vary according to his emotional state. But dreams of martyrdom and sainthood were brushed aside once Ramon became enthralled by the operatic stage. He gave up the idea of becoming a priest, at least temporarily, after seeing an old Metropolitan Opera advertisement for Enrico Caruso and Geraldine Farrar in Manon. Additionally, the youngster had been greatly impressed by the (then still unfinished) Palacio de Bellas Artes while in the capital. \"In Mexico City the Opera is a beautiful place,\" Novarro recalled for Smenland magazine in 1929. \"[It's] a wonderful temple of music comparable only to the Paris Opera in grandeur.\" The elaborate costumes and decor, the social prestige, and the overall glamorous atmosphere of the opera world thus charmed him away from a stark life inside a Mexican monastery. \"Perhaps it was the devil tempting me,\" Novarro remarked years later. \"I'm still not so sure it wasn't.\" To eradicate any sense of guilt for his defection, Ramon consulted the local priest, who granted him sanction to make music his life's work.\n\nIn the mid-1910s, Dr. Samaniego was again working as a night school English teacher at the Institute Juarez, one of the few educational establishments that remained open in Durango. But despite periods of tranquillity, the Samaniegos realized they could not remain in town with the constant\n\n10 • BEYOND PARADISE threat of attacks by marauders from either side of the ongoing conflict. Furthermore, with most schools closed, they would be unable to provide an education for their children. The couple eventually decided they should send the children to the United States, where they could stay with Dr. Samaniego's relatives in El Paso or Los Angeles. This venture appealed to Ramon, for even though his English was spotty—and to some extent would remain so for the rest of his life—there were markedly better opportunities for an artistic career north of the Rio Grande than he could possibly find in revolution-plagued Mexico. After much haggling, he finally persuaded his mother to allow him to travel north ahead of everyone else. In September 1916, seventeen-year-old Ramon, accompanied by fifteenyear-old Mariano, headed north to Texas by train. About one-third of the way into the trip, in the small town of Escalon, the train stopped. The bridge ahead of them had been destroyed. Then word came that the bridge leading back to Durango had also been blown up. For two days, the two Durango travelers survived on tortillas, beans, and dirty water, while Ramon fretted that the rebel Pancho Villa might invade the town and have his ears cut off—an unqualified disaster for an aspirant to a music career. Finally, a train arrived from Torreon bearing bridge-building personnel; but since Ramon was unsure about the quality of their work, he decided to walk back to Durango with his brother. Upon the two brothers' return, Senora Samaniego insisted that it was God's will that they stay home, to which Ramon countered, \"Maybe he was just testing us.\" Determined to prove to both God and his mother that his destiny lay on the northern side of the border, Ramon, carrying $100 (approximately $1,350 today) in gold coins and now accompanied by both Mariano and a local friend, once more attempted the perilous journey north, but this time via Monterrey and Piedras Negras. A few days later, after going through immigration procedures that included a physical examination, bathing, and disinfecting, Ramon and Mariano were safe in Eagle Pass, Texas. They proceeded to El Paso to meet with their relatives, but shortly afterward—without notifying their parents—the duo headed farther west, as Ramon was intent on pursuing a show business career in Los Angeles. In the fall of 1917, the rest of the family followed. For them, too, it was a dismal train ride from Durango to El Paso. Corpses hanging from telephone poles along the tracks across northern Mexico's desolate landscape were a constant reminder of the danger posed by rebels, renegade government forces, and common thieves. The many potential hazards notwithstanding, the Samaniegos reached the safety of El Paso in November 1917. Guadalupe, Rosa, and the young Leonor were the only family members\n\nMexican Kuols\n\n•\n\n11\n\nwho remained behind. Guadalupe had become a novice in the Order of the Sisters of the Cross and was eventually sent to the Church of San Juan Bautista in Coyoacan, a suburb of Mexico City, where she was to manage the sisterhood's business affairs. Rosa had joined the Order of the Sisters of Charity, adopting the name of her older sister Guadalupe (which must have caused some confusion in the family). After her novitiate in Havana, she was assigned to nurse leprosy sufferers in the Canary Islands. From there, she was relocated to Madrid and later to Teruel, in northeastern Spain. The young Leonor followed in Rosa's footsteps, also being sent to Cuba, then to the Canary Islands, and later to Spain, where she remained until the early 1930s. To attend to business interests, the Samamegos stayed in El Paso for nearly a year. But the promise of the milder Southern California weather, coupled with the desire to see Ramon and Mariano, motivated the family to move west. In August 1918, they were finally reunited in Los Angeles.\n\nTWO\n\nArrival in Paradise\n\nM\n\ny mother thought it was the closest place to paradise,\" recalled Carmen Gavilan, and for a family recently arrived from a country torn by a bloody revolution, Los Angeles probably did seem like paradise. In the late 1910s, the city was surrounded by open spaces and green hillsides with rows of flowery pepper trees, while its streets were lined with date and fan palms. Near-constant sunshine, pure air, and a leisurely pace further contributed to the city's paradisiacal allure. But for all its apparent serenity, the sleepy Mexican town of several decades earlier had been transformed into a fast-growing American city. Los Angeles County's population almost doubled from 500,000 in 1910 to more than 930,000 by the end of the decade. Along with the thousands of new residents arriving from the American Midwest, two other forces helped spur this colossal growth: Mexican immigration and the booming film industry, which had relocated en masse from the East Coast. The first local film studios had been makeshift affairs, but once the industry achieved a sense of security, permanent facilities were built in an area stretching from Culver City, just a few miles from the Pacific Ocean, to the eastern end of the San Fernando Valley and East Los Angeles, approximately fifteen miles away. Before the 1910s were over, motion pictures had become the county's leading industry. In the meantime, Mexican immigrants were settling primarily in the downtown Plaza area, then known as Sonoratown, so they could easily get to work in the nearby railroads. Main Street between Sixth and Macy Streets was the heart of the community, with restaurants, theaters, barbershops, pool halls, and numerous other businesses catering to Mexican nationals. By far the fastest-growing national group in California during the 1910s, Mexicans\n\nArrival in Paradise •\n\n13\n\nbegan spreading eastward from the Plaza into Alhambra and East Los Angeles. Some of this great influx from south of the border coincided with the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, which resulted in widespread labor shortages. Mexicans were especially welcome as cheap and hard workers, but, paradoxically, the war also brought on a surge of antiforeign sentiment. In parts of the American Southwest, including the then largely WASP city of Los Angeles, the seething xenophobia took the form of a \"Brown Scare,\" as locals feared the invasion of poor, uneducated, brownskinned Catholics into their communities. During that same period, Mexicans also became one of the main targets of a \"scare\" of another color—red—after federal agents launched a hunt for alleged Communists and anarchists, an operation supported by merchants and manufacturers whose main objective was to prevent labor organizing. Since many Mexicans worked in crucial sectors of the economy, such as railroad construction and agriculture, they were perceived as a particularly serious threat. This association of Mexicans with Communism would continue for years, and later was to affect Novarro directly. To avoid being targeted by the several scares—and as a sign of their own ethnic prejudices—the small minority of upper-class Mexicans (even if they had Indian blood) and Mexicans of European ancestry often referred to themselves as \"Spanish.\" Despite their dark brown hair and eyes, the Samaniegos were lighter skinned than most of their fellow nationals, but they too must have had to deal with anti-Mexican discrimination—whether or not they called themselves Spanish. Mexican children, for example, were often segregated into schools of inferior quality, while their parents frequently had to pay higher rents than white Americans for comparable dwellings.\n\nRamon and Mariano arrived in Los Angeles on Thanksgiving Day, 1916. At first, they stayed with their physician uncle, Dr. Jose Samaniego, and his family at 420 South Serrano Avenue, about two miles west of downtown. The two young brothers remained at their uncles home until sometime in 1917, when their names first appear in the Los Angeles city directory (Ramon is listed as \"Raymond\") as residents of a boardinghouse on 852 South Main Street, in the heart of the downtown district. In spite of their uncles assistance, Ramon and Mariano faced severe financial hardships during their first two years in Los Angeles. Lured by the glamour of Hollywood—and disregarding his parents' disapproval—shortly\n\n14 . BEYOND PARADISE after his arrival Ramon temporarily set opera to the side to try his luck in the film business. With only minimal security at the studios, he had little difficulty walking through the gates and into casting offices, but actually landing a job was a different matter. The dark-haired, brown-eyed, handsome young Mexican was competing daily with thousands of other applicants. \"I almost lost hope,\" he later told Picture-Play's Margaret Ettinger. \"Finally one day, I was given an extra part. Then I thought my days of hardship were over. But they weren't. It was months before I was cast as an extra again, and in the meantime I nearly starved.\" In those preunion times, for a daily salary ranging from $3 to $5 (approximately $30 to $50 today), extras had to be on the set by early morning and sometimes work until late at night, without the benefit of overtime pay or any of today's amenities. It was hard and irregular work that rarely led to larger roles, but for the inexperienced Ramon, working as an extra was the only way to break into the business. His first bit part was that of a Mexican bandit in the 1917 Famous Players—Lasky release The Jaguar's Claws, for which he traveled with the company to the Mojave Desert. Believing this to be his big chance—\"my motto was, Anything to Attract the Attention of ^ibur Boss\"—Ramon began \"acting\" during a pivotal scene. Unimpressed, director Marshall Neilan immediately ordered him out. Ramon's other bit roles that year included a German soldier in The Little American, starring Mary Pickford, and an Aztec warrior in Cecil B. DeMille's The Woman God Forgot. According to Herbert Howe, the determined young Mexican once again tried to attract some attention by displaying his piano virtuosity to the film's star, opera diva Geraldine Farrar—feeling insulted when she acknowledged his playing with a mere \"pretty good.\" Thrilled with his first $5 (instead of the usual $3) extra role, Ramon also appeared as a shepherd in The Hostage, allegedly through the influence of the picture's star, matinee idol Wallace Reid, who had taken a liking to the struggling extra after meeting him on the set of The Woman God Forgot. Since extra and bit player work remained sporadic, Ramon supplemented his income with a variety of odd jobs, such as grocery clerk and busboy at the celebrity-packed Victor Hugo Restaurant, and made good use of his childhood music lessons by tutoring in piano. But his most surprising moneymaking activity during that lean period was posing nude for students at the J. Francis Smith School of Illustration and Painting (future film star Leatrice Joy was a fellow model). In the late 1910s, baring one's body even for art's sake was perceived in most circles as a form of depravity. Nude modeling was thus a peculiar choice of work for a youngster who not long before had considered becom-\n\nArrival in Paradise\n\n•\n\n15\n\ning a priest. Ramon likely saw nothing wrong with that activity for himself, though he would certainly have forbidden any of his siblings from doing the same. He was an artist, and in his view, artists were exempt from the traditional moral code. In later years, he would accept, even admire, the unorthodox behavior of many of his female costars, while frowning upon the same in his sisters. This moral compartmentalization—or double standard—would remain a constant element in Novarro's life: he would embrace or reject the conservative cultural values he was raised with according to the circumstances. Ramon obtained a steadier source of income working as an usher at Tally's Theater and Clune's Auditorium, jobs that also gave him the chance to rub elbows with stars of the theater and music worlds. Now a firm believer in French psychotherapist Emile Coue's motto, \"Every day in every way I'm getting better and better,\" Ramon was confident that others would soon recognize his multifarious talents. Hence, he began scattering seeds wherever he could, from the film studios to the stage and the opera, with the hope that at least one of them would bear fruit. He later claimed to have tried auditioning for Geraldine Farrar, dance diva Anna Pavlova, stage grand dame Minnie Maddern Fiske, and opera singer Mary Garden, who was allegedly impressed by the young usher's boldness but, like the other celebrities, quietly ignored his pleas. Another way Ramon found to make himself visible to both celebrities and talent scouts was working for $10 a week as a combination usher and bit player at the Majestic Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The stock company, which had been set up to showcase the talents of established stage performers Edward Everett Horton, Evelyn Varden, and Franklin Pangborn, would allow Ramon to encounter influential show business figures both onstage and in the audience. As a put-down of Method actors, Novarro would later affirm that he neither required nor sought dramatic-school training, but his time with the Majestic company (and later at the Hollywood Community Theater) served as a hands-on apprenticeship. His first role with the company was that of a Japanese bird seller in J. H. Benrimo's The Willow Tree, which was followed by numerous other parts that, however small, exposed him to the techniques and expertise of the Majestic's stage veterans. After Novarro had become a star, columnist Louella Parsons described how he had learned every part in every play presented at the Majestic with a determination—or perhaps obsessiveness—that surprised both directors and fellow actors. Even if such dedication was exaggerated for publicity purposes, the young immigrant was consumed with the idea of success in\n\n16 . BEYOND PARADISE the new country. Film actress Betty Blythe, who later appeared with a bearded and heavily made-up Ramon (as Herod) in a production of Oscar Wilde's Salome at the Hollywood Community Theater, remembered seeing him play three different parts in one production, and \"doing each one with equal skill\"\n\nIn the summer of 1918, around the time his family arrived in Los Angeles, Ramon's professional fortunes took a turn for the better with the appearance of choreographer Marion Morgan. Since the mid-1910s, this former director of summer dance programs at the University of California at Berkeley had been touring the country with her own ballet company. Inspired by history and classical legends, Morgan's modernistic dances were performed at upscale vaudeville theaters and as prologues to feature films at the more prestigious movie palaces. In the summer of 1918, while looking for a male dancer who would not be drafted and sent to the battlefields of Europe, Morgan spotted Ramon in a production at the Majestic. She allegedly picked him for the ballet Attila and the Huns because she liked his physique, though the actual reason for her choosing the five-foot-six-mch, slightly pudgy bit player with no dance experience was most probably his Mexican citizenship. In August, Ramon left his family house and headed to New Ysrk, where Attila rehearsals would be held. He rented a room in a boardinghouse on Forty-ninth Street, and, since he was not getting paid during rehearsals, worked nights as a pastry boy at the Horn and Hardart Automat on Broadway for $1.60 a night. Obsessed with pursuing a show business career during the day and forced to earn a living at night, an exhausted Ramon developed sore feet, which slowed him down on the dance stage. He was summarily fired, but had to be rehired when his replacement proved to be even less adequate. Despite his exhaustion, Ramon must have been a quick study, for in early fall he left New ^lork with the Attila and the Huns troupe for a tour of the Orpheum theater circuit in the northern United States and Canada. Morgan's latest routine, described by an enthralled Milwaukee reviewer as \"quite the most beautiful thing of the year,\" depicted a sinuous Attila and his fellow serpentine Huns as they battled and pillaged their way through Italy. Despite the acclaim, Ramon felt homesick after months on the road. \"I was anxious to get back to the West Coast,\" he later recalled, \"and, though I almost expected to go through the same hardships I had endured before, even then the call was too strong to resist. There was that inner desire to suffer, I believe.\" Melodramatics aside, Ramon missed his family and perhaps felt he should do more to help in their support. Also, touring\n\nArrival in Paradise\n\n•\n\n17\n\ntheaters in Wisconsin or Ontario would not do as much for his career as appearing at the Majestic in Los Angeles, where he could be seen by talent scouts. In June 1919, Morgan's troupe finally returned to Los Angeles. After two more weeks with the company, Ramon decided he had had enough of vaudeville and opted instead to once again haunt the casting offices of film studios. He resumed his work as an usher at the Majestic and began taking dance lessons from Ernest Belcher, a long-faced, impeccably groomed Englishman who owned the renowned Celeste School of Dancing in Hollywood. Belcher's thirteen-year-old stepdaughter, actress Lina Basquette (then the child star of the Lena Baskette Featurettes), later recalled having had her first crush on the twenty-year-old Mexican dance student. She was not alone. Fellow Belcher alumna Derelys Perdue, a slender brunette who became Novarro's frequent dance partner, was also infatuated with the handsome young Mexican. Ramon's interests, however, lay elsewhere. During his stint at the Majestic and with Morgan's troupe, Ramon learned more than acting techniques and dance steps. Having been raised in an environment in which rules of conduct for both genders were precise, narrow, and strictly enforced, he was likely both terrified and fascinated by the relative freedom from societal mores enjoyed—at least on the surface—by artists. If Ramon was not fully aware of his sexual orientation by the late 1910s, his contact with show people opened his eyes to manifestations of human sexuality taught neither by church nor by family. Marion Morgan, for instance, preferred the company of women to that of men, and would in later years become film director Dorothy Arzner's life partner. The Majestic players Edward Everett Horton and Franklin Pangborn were both \"prissy\" types—a characteristic they would use to good advantage in films of the 1930s and 1940s—whose sexual orientation was no secret among their coworkers. In sharp contrast, Ramon quite possibly had had little—if any—understanding of homosexuality while growing up in Durango. The institution of the Code of Napoleon during Emperor Maximilian's rule had decriminalized same-sex relations, but these continued to be frowned on by the Mexican government. Effeminate men were frequently harassed by the police, and those accused of having engaged in homosexual acts could be sent to jail. De facto prejudice against gays was so pervasive that many—perhaps most— Mexicans remained unaware that sex with a partner of the same gender was actually legal. Thus, despite Ramon's recent exposure to a wider spectrum of human sexuality and his own personal views about artists like himself, he still had\n\n18 . BEYOND PARADISE to cope with his cultural constraints. Certain kinds of activities were deemed unfit for a man, and even though Ramon rebelled against such arbitrary rules, he remained susceptible to self-doubt. \"I didn't take the work seriously,\" he would later confess to Photoplay about his dancing with Morgan's troupe. \"... I was afraid of being thought a sis.\" In reality, the struggling actor and dancer had good reason to believe he lacked a strong virile image, for his delicate features, slight stature, and mild manner could be—and sometimes were—perceived as effeminate. Lina Basquette remembered that her mother, much to the teenager's chagrin, used to refer to Ramon as a \"sissy.\" Such a derisive remark may have stemmed from Mrs. Belcher's prejudices against soft-mannered male dancers, though she may have been aware of an intimate attachment between Ramon and a fellow dance student. While at Belcher's studio, Ramon had met Louis Samuel, a small, dark ballet dancer three years his junior. The two quickly became close friends in spite of their different temperaments and backgrounds—while the Mexican Catholic Ramon was lively and carefree, the Hungarian Jewish Samuel was taciturn and distrustful. Years later, Basquette would recall that Samuel watched over Ramon the way \"Damon guarded Pythias,\" asserting that he \"saw to it that Ramon was well protected— especially from females.\" In a letter to author Allan Ellenberger, Basquette remembered Samuel as \"insanely jealous of man, woman or child that Ramon felt a friendship or affection for. He had a sullen disposition and seldom did his eyes stray from Ramon.\" The exact type of relationship Ramon and Samuel shared has never been made clear, though Basquette's remarks suggest that it was more than a simple friendship. The two Belcher alumni were to remain intimate—though not necessarily involved—until their association was abruptly shattered in the early 1930s.\n\nMeanwhile, Ramon persevered in his efforts to make his mark in Hollywood. In the summer of 1919, while working as a busboy at the Alexandria Hotel, the main hub of the film community's social life, Ramon heard that the legendary director D. W. Griffith was searching for a new leading man for his next production. Years later, Novarro would remember, \"When D. W. used to come in to lunch at the Alexandria, I always made sure that I cleared his table. He always said that he discovered me. Actually, I discovered him.\" At the Los Angeles premiere of Broken Blossoms, Ramon approached the venerated director of The Birth of a Nation, asking him for a chance in films. Probably trying to get rid of him, Griffith consented to see the eager youth\n\nArrival in Paradise\n\n•\n\n19\n\nat his studio the following day. The next day and every day for the ensuing two weeks, Ramon expectantly waited at the studio's reception bench for hours. When Griffith finally decided to see him, the young actor was ready with a short scene he himself had written. According to \"On the Road with Ramon,\" Herbert Howe's humorous version of Novarro's life for Motion Picture, Ramon's acting piece concerned a neurotic murderer who, while on his way to a prison cell, is throttled by the ghost of his victim. While Ramon choked himself, Griffith abruptly interrupted the drama to inquire, \"But who is the victim?\" \"That,\" came the reply, \"is left to the imagination.\" Intrigued, Griffith ordered a test. A report was promised for the following day, but when Ramon heard nothing, he wrote a pleading letter and rushed to the director's turf at the Alexandria. After bribing a bellhop, Ramon headed for the director's room. When the door opened, he handed the letter to a disheveled, pajama-clad Griffith and blurted out, \"My future is in your hands, Mr. Griffith.\" As it turned out, Ramon's professional future lay elsewhere. Griffith returned to his Long Island studio and never bothered calling the spirited Mexican. \"I sometimes wonder,\" Novarro later observed, \"if there was really any film in that camera.\"\n\nWhile Ramon was working at the Alexandria (off and on in the late 1910s), another young Latin was making the rounds at the hotel. An Italian immigrant who had been earning his living as a small-time actor, tea dancer, and escort, Rodolfo Guglielmi—later to be known as Rudolph Valentino— was trying to make himself visible to talent scouts. Legend has it that around this time a romance developed between the two future Latin Lovers, as nothing could be more ironic to Hollywood gossipmongers than an affair between two male film stars known as heterosexual sex symbols. Novarro and Valentino were ideal targets. Despite his circumspection, Novarro was known in certain Hollywood circles to be gay, and his death made that knowledge public, whereas rumors questioning the androgynous Valentino's masculinity abounded during his reign as Hollywood's supreme screen lover. Those tales were created largely by resentful and xenophobic male members of the press who derisively referred to Valentino as a \"wop,\" a \"he-vamp,\" and, most infamously, a \"pink powder puff.\" Valentino's overly ornamented screen appearances and passionate displays of love, which were deemed unmasculine by conservative American men and a threat to impressionable\n\n20\n\n• BEYOND PARADISE\n\nyoung male filmgoers, helped fuel the anti-Valentino rhetoric. Stories about the star's habit of using women's beauty products (which he firmly denied) and his problematic first marriage to Jean Acker, a lesbian who locked him out of the bedroom on their wedding night, did nothing to still the rumors. A second marriage to the willful (and oft-rumored bisexual) Natacha Rambova only led to more tales about Valentino's unmanliness, as word spread that Rambova was the one who wore the pants in the Valentino household. Claims that Valentino had homosexual inclinations have so far been unfounded, but even if they had been true, that in itself would be no indication that he and Novarro were ever lovers. In a 1962 interview, Novarro stated that he had met his fellow Latin Lover only once, while the struggling Mexican was eking out a living as an usher at Clune's Auditorium. Actually, he saw Valentino at least one more time, during the filming of Rex Ingram s The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, in which Valentino stars and Ramon appears as an extra. Nonetheless, there is no evidence that they ever socialized, nor that any sort of more intimate relationship—platonic or otherwise—ever developed between them. If the Valentino-Novarro rumors began while Novarro was still alive, he surely was not embarrassed by them. In later years, he would make jokes about having his name tied to that of the more popular Latin Lover, once referring to himself as the devoted \"woman in black,\" a perennial visitor to Valentino's grave.\n\nSince his return to Los Angeles with Marion Morgan's troupe, Ramon had been living with his family in a rented two-story house at 2323 Hope Street, several blocks south of the boardinghouse where he had previously stayed. Senora Samaniego had wanted to buy the Hope Street property, but her husband concluded they could not afford the $6,000 price and refused to borrow the required amount from his relatives. Though Los Angeles initially seemed like paradise compared to war-torn Durango, life in the new land was anything but paradisiacal for the Samaniegos. Their sole income was the dwindling inheritance left by Dr. Samaniego's father and the little money Ramon and Mariano earned at odd jobs. Except for Ramon (and perhaps Mariano, then working as a bottler in a dairy), whose English had improved since his arrival, the only family member who spoke fluent English was the semi-invalid Dr. Samaniego. The lack of a good command of English reduced the other family members' chances for employment and made their struggle in that period of high\n\nArrival in Paradise • 21\n\ninflation even more daunting. Even so, in the close-knit Mexican community, they were no doubt helped in their search for jobs by Dr. Samaniego's relatives and assorted comadres and compadres. The children were sent to school, and eventually most family members began working at odd jobs. Jose became a soda jerk at a local drugstore, Angel and Eduardo sold the Los Angeles Times at the corner of Pico and Union, Antonio delivered furniture, Luz and Carmen worked as part-time stock-girls at the Broadway department store, and Senora Samaniego gave singing lessons. Unable to hold a job, Dr. Samaniego kept busy taking chiropractic lessons. As a conservative man with conventional ideas about his duties as husband and father, Dr. Samaniego's male ego must have been seriously bruised by his inability to support his family. Worst of all, he was the one being supported by them. With his father semi-incapacitated, Ramon, as the eldest male child, had to assume most of the responsibility for the family's support. Such responsibility, however, clashed with his artistic ambitions. Traditional families like the Samaniegos regarded film actors—with the exception of Hollywood royalty such as Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish—as only slightly more respectable than thieves and prostitutes. According to Novarro, his mother, who still envisioned him as a venerated concert pianist, staunchly opposed his acting pursuits, while Dr. Samaniego was particularly disdainful of his oldest son's chosen career path, often declaring he had \"a first-class nut in the family that would never amount to anything.\" But no amount of scolding, protesting, or ridicule from his parents was to prevent the relentlessly ambitious young man from pursuing his professional goal. While Ramon doggedly pursued a show business career, an unexpected disaster threatened his family's—and his own—chances for remaining in Los Angeles. One night, eleven-year-old Carmen stopped playing with her dolls in the attic to go have dinner downstairs, leaving a lighted candle behind. After the meal, Jose went upstairs and immediately darted back down yelling, \"The house is on fire!\" All ten Samaniegos ran about trying to salvage what they could, but, as the fire rapidly spread, all they could do was stand in front of the house and watch it burn. The firemen eventually managed to extinguish the flames, but the water caused more damage than the fire itself, and many family possessions were lost to looters. The Samaniegos had nowhere to go. A return to Durango would have been unwise. Whatever the political climate in Mexico, the Samaniegos had no guarantee that they would be able to rebuild their lives with the Mexican economy and social fabric nearly destroyed by almost a decade of warfare. A move back to El Paso to stay with relatives was a possibility, but the\n\n22\n\n• BEYOND PARADISE\n\nharsher climate would have been detrimental to Dr. Samaniego's health. Ultimately, the family opted to stay in Los Angeles, counting on the assistance of Dr. Samaniego's brother and of the local Mexican community. A few months after the fire the family found a new home: a two-story Craftsman house at 1340 Constance Street, just southwest of downtown and only a short distance from their previous residence. At that time, Constance Street lay in a mostly middle-class white neighborhood, and only blocks away from the Bonnie Brae and Alvarado mansions, where several Hollywood celebrities lived. This was a preferred residential area for upperclass Mexican emigres. They could hobnob with some of the city's elite while remaining conveniently close to Spanish-speaking merchants and the flavor of Mexican culture. Despite the house fire, the search for another residence, and the Samaniegos' ever-unstable financial situation—even with outside assistance, most of them had to earn a living—Ramon was unstoppable in his quest for success. While dancing with Derelys Perdue in a prologue at the Kinema Theater he met actor Richard Dix, then working for Goldwyn Pictures during the day and dating Perdue at night. Dix was so impressed by a bit Ramon had done in a Mabel Normand picture that he tried to induce his studio to give the dancing Mexican a chance, but, as Dix would later remember, \"No one seemed especially interested.\" Unable to secure a substantial part, Ramon continued laboring as an extra in films. Sometimes he also appeared on-screen in highly stylized dance sequences choreographed by Marion Morgan; among them were an ancient Roman bacchanal in Allen Holubar's Man—Woman—Marriage, in which he and Derelys Perdue danced semmaked atop a mirrored table (a week's work at $25 a day), and the dagger dance in the Mack Sennett feature A Small Town Idol. In the latter sequence, also with Perdue, Ramon is nearly unrecognizable garbed in a glittering loincloth and under heavy faunlike makeup. In late 1920, Ramon finally landed an actual screen role in Goldwyn's Mr. Barnes of New York, receiving billing for the first time, as the Corsican youth Antonio Paoli. Though still a minor part—Paoli gets killed in a duel a few minutes into the picture—Ramon's role is crucial, as his death sets the vendetta plot in motion. Paoli's sister vows revenge for her brother's death but must first identify his killer, who might well be her new husband. Director Victor Schertzinger gave the young hopeful a chance in this Tom Moore vehicle after watching Ramon portray a lovestruck dancing shepherd in The Concert. Novarro later said that Schertzinger was so impressed with his work that he had Paoli's role enlarged (additional takes were shot by future MGM producer Paul Bern).\n\nArrival in Paradise\n\n•\n\n23\n\nAround that time, Ramon altered his family name by adding an 5 at the end of \"Samaniego.\" (\"Ramon\" had already been changed to \"Ramon\" in print ads for his dance routines.) The ardently Catholic twenty-one-year-old was an equally ardent believer in seers, palm readers, and numerology, which assigns different values to letters of the alphabet. The extra 5 was supposed to give his name the cosmic vibrations of the \"master number\" eleven, a number especially conducive to success in artistic endeavors. But regardless of the name change, any hopes Ramon had for immediate recognition were dashed when Goldwyn shelved Mr. Barnes of New York, possibly because of a backlog in the studio's output. Only several months later, in the summer of 1921, did Ramon's professional luck change, with the appearance of artist and poet Ferdinand Pinney Earle. The burly, handsome forty-three-year-old Earle (nicknamed \"Affinity Earle\" after stating in court during a divorce lawsuit that he felt only \"affinity\" for his mistress) had been working for the studios as a designer of ornate dialogue intertitles since the mid-1910s. His ultimate goal was to transpose great operas onto film, but after considering Aida, Faust, Tristan and Isolde, and The Ring of the Niebelungen for his directorial debut, Earle settled on the poems of Omar Khayyam, \"the astronomer poet of Persia.\" Earle later explained that he was \"determined not to launch the production of my Opus No. I until I had adequately protected myself against all the usual evils of the way, especially as I was to make an entirely new type of picture.\" Probably because no major studio was interested in the project, Earle signed with impresario Theodore Ahrens, who then formed the Rubaiyat Company with Earle as acting president. Earle's contract also stipulated that he was to be the picture's author, director, editor, production manager, and art director, and that no changes could be made without his written consent. He was thus assured that his depiction of The Rulaiyat of Omar Khayyam, \"might be produced under ideal conditions and safeguarded from intolerable interferences and outside worries.\" In early June 1921, production began at the Hollywood Studios and at a lot on Earle's two-and-a-half-acre estate at 2140 North Highland Avenue, which had been temporarily converted into a studio. (The sand dune scenes were filmed in Oxnard, a coastal town approximately sixty miles northwest of Los Angeles.) Celebrated Shakespearean actor Frederick Warde was selected for the part of Omar Khayyam, and high-culture stage actress and director Hedwiga Reicher was chosen as the second female lead, while Earle cast himself in the role of Destiny. (Future King Kong screamer Fay Wray, then a guest at Earle's house, was cast as an extra.) The leading lady was found in late June in the person of eighteen-year-\n\n24 . BEYOND PARADISE old beauty-contest winner Kathleen Key. Earle had placed ads in search of a \"girl of oriental beauty,\" and found her in this pert, dark-eyed brunette. The director also found the romantic male lead through an ad in the trades. According to Earle's son Eyvmd, \"Ramon came to the front door one day and was hired.\" Ramon's looks, which could pass as Middle Eastern, and the poise and grace of movement he had acquired as a dancer were the likely reasons for his landing the role of Omar Khayyam's nephew, Ben-Ali. In addition to acting in the picture, Ramon was to choreograph its dance sequences. Earle's version of The Rubaiyat dealt with Khayyam and Ben-Ali's struggles against a desert bandit, a simplistic storyline that would be offset by the production's sets, cinematography, and special effects. Through multiple exposures, Earle melded elaborate paintings and miniatures to the built sets, a creative way to save money while also giving the picture a magical grandeur. Describing the effect as \"motion painting,\" Earle explained, \"My object has been to create a dream world so convincing... as to baffle the beholder and at the same time to achieve many times richer and vaster sets—without wrecking the finances of a Rockefeller.\" When asked if the picture might be too artistic for the average moviegoer, Earle replied, \"The privilege of enjoying beauty is not confined to the upper classes. It is a universal thing. ... I have not attempted to make it a picture for the few.\" The moneymen, however, disagreed. Earle would later refer to the making of The Rubaiyat as a \"bloody venture,\" for besides abhorring his juvenile's performance—Earle \"just thought I was terrible,\" Novarro recalled in the 1950s—the director had to persevere with his production \"in spite of continual and infernal interferences.\" After the picture was completed, Theodore Ahrens confiscated several reels of the film without Earle's knowledge and, complaining that \"there was too much artistic aroma\" in the $65,000 production (the average cost for a studio picture at the time), ordered that the film be reassembled without the director's input. In response, Earle filed a lawsuit in federal court demanding an injunction against the release of the film. For the moment, Earle triumphed. Exhibition of The Rubaiyat, which was scheduled to preview in New \"fork on January 14, 1922, was barred by the courts. Later that year, Ramon lamented, \"It may never be shown to the public, but such a beautiful screen poem it is, so sensual.\" In September 1922, more than one year after filming had been completed, a truncated version of The Rubaiyat was shown to a private audience of studio chiefs, financiers, artists, critics, and socialites. \"Two solid hours vanished as but a minute, so fascinating did the production prove,\" wrote an enthralled re-\n\nArrival in Paradise\n\n•\n\n25\n\nviewer. The audience was so enthusiastic that they burst into applause at the mere sight of Earle's sets. Earle himself was satisfied with the visual qualities of the picture, and had by then (after seeing the rough cut) changed his mind about Ramon's work. United Artists offered to distribute The Rubaiyat, but several months later handed the still-unreleased film back to Earle. (In his autobiography, Eyvind Earle asserts that the makers of UA's The Thief of Bagdad stole the decor and numerous scenes from The RubaiyatJ) Ultimately, Earle's \"motion painting\" was shelved for lack of a distributor. Without the benefit of a marquee name, the picture was deemed too artistic to be commercially viable, while the December 1922 release of First National's Omar the Tentmaker—about the same Persian poet—further hindered its box-office prospects.\n\nLong before the New ^ibrk special screening of The Rubaiyat, Ramon had been desperately looking for more acting parts. Since he was presumably \"terrible\" in that picture, the still-unknown actor feared that unless he landed another role before the release of Earle's \"motion painting,\" he would never work again. Yet, when director J. Emmett Flynn saw a Rubaiyat sequence in the fall of 1921 for the purpose of evaluating Kathleen Key, he completely ignored Key and instead asked Ramon to test for a part in his prestigious costume drama Monte Cristo. But despite Flynn's enthusiasm and his careful direction of Ramon's tests, Fox ultimately opted for a name actor, Gaston Glass, forcing the luckless Ramon to continue his seemingly futile struggles. Ramon then joined the Hollywood Community Theater, a one-hundredseat playhouse in the heart of Hollywood that served both as a showcase for budding talent and as a means for established stars such as Wallace Reid, Conrad Nagel, and Henry B. Walthall to demonstrate their versatility. None of the talent involved received payment, but that disadvantage was offset by the guaranteed success of the shows, which were performed for sold-out audiences packed with film industry professionals. The appeal of the Community Theater notwithstanding, Ramon was most probably disheartened to return to minor parts on the semiprofessional stage after having savored an important role in a feature film. But a man for whom he had briefly worked in the recent past was unexpectedly to show up again and dramatically change the aspiring actor's fortunes. Enter Rex Ingram.\n\nTHREE\n\nRamon's Columbus\n\nA\n\nfter watching Rex Ingram's 1921 adaptation of Vicente Blasco Ibanez's Tie Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, playwright and film critic Robert E. Sherwood remarked that the picture \"will be hailed as a great dramatic achievement; one which deserves—more than any other picture play that the war inspired—to be handed down to generations yet unborn.... [It] is a living, breathing answer to those who still refuse to take motion pictures seriously. Its production lifts the silent drama to an artistic plane that it has never touched before.\" The nearly bankrupt Metro Pictures had a large financial stake in The Four Horsemen. The production costs had reached an astounding $608,000, at a time when the average budget for feature films was $60,000. Ingram himself had much to lose if the film failed to ignite at the box office. As his first superproduction, The Four Horsemen could either propel him to the forefront of Hollywood directors or destroy his chances of ever achieving that status. To the relief of all involved, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, which premiered in New Yark on March 6, 1921, proved to be a phenomenal hit. At the end of its run, The Four Horsemen had reportedly earned more than $4 million in box-office rentals, perhaps surpassed only by D. W. Griffiths 1915 The Birth of a Nation (box-office numbers for the Griffith picture are unreliable). The picture catapulted twenty-four-year-old Rudolph Valentino to international superstardom and turned Ingram into one of the top film directors of the time, second in prestige only to Griffith. In The Four Horsemen's famous tango scene, shot sometime in the second half of 1920, Ramon danced in the background with his sister Luz (often misidentified as the much younger Carmen), though they cannot be dis-\n\nRamon's C o l u m b u s\n\n• 27\n\ncerned on screen. Ramon, however, can be briefly glimpsed in the Call to Arms sequence—in which a woman wrapped in the French flag sings \"La Marseillaise\"—looking outraged at a man who refuses to stand up while the anthem is sung. But for Ingram, Ramon was just one among the hundreds of extras used in the picture. The director paid him scant notice during filming and later remarked he had no recollection of the Mexican extra on The Four Horsemen set. Yet, The Four Horsemen is, even if indirectly, an important picture in the career of the unnoticed Mexican extra, for it brought together figures who were to loom large in his professional future. Kathleen Key, who had a small part in the film, a few months later became his love interest in The Ruhaiyat, June Mathis, The Four Horsemen's scenarist and unofficial producer, was to become the creative force behind Ben~Hur. Alice Terry, the picture's leading lady, would be Ramon's leading lady in four films. And, finally, there was Rex Ingram.\n\nRex Ingram—not to be confused with the 1940s character actor of the same name—was the man Erich von Stroheim called \"the world's greatest director.\" His work inspired Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu to pursue a film career. The Red Shoes codirector Michael Powell, who got his first job working for Ingram, once referred to him as \"the greatest stylist of his time,\" while filmmaker David Lean acknowledged an indebtedness to Ingram's cinematic vision. When future MGM head Dore Schary was asked to name the top creative people in the early days of film, his choices were D. W. Griffith, Rex Ingram, Cecil B. DeMille, and Erich von Stroheim—in that order. Born Reginald Ingram Montgomery Hitchcock in Dublin on January 15, 1893, Ingram spent most of his childhood in the several Irish towns to which his clergyman father was assigned. He later attended St. Columba's College in Dublin County, and in 1911, two years after his mother s death, he emigrated to the United States, where he worked at rail yards in New Haven and studied sculpture at Yale. After watching the 1911 Vitagraph film version of A Tale of Two Cities, the handsome young Irishman became fascinated with the artistic possibilities offered by motion pictures. In 1913, he joined the Edison Company in the Bronx as actor, scriptwriter, and general handyman, moving to Vitagraph's Brooklyn studios the following year as a contract actor under the name Rex Hitchcock. By 1915, he had settled behind the cameras as Rex Ingram, writing vehicles for Theda Bara and other major Fox stars. One year later, the twenty-three-year-old Ingram began his career as a\n\n28 . BEYOND PARADISE director at the Universal lot in Los Angeles. His first film, the underworld melodrama The Great Problem, was followed by nine other pictures at that studio, nearly all of them set m exotic locales. According to Ingram biographer Liam O'Leary, the director gradually gained a reputation for his \"fine pictorial sense, relentless pursuit of atmosphere,\" and, being highly superstitious, for his \"use of deformed actors, especially dwarfs and hunchbacks.\" Ingram's unquestionable talent was matched only by his arrogance, fiery temperament, and lack of respect for authority. \"He had a bad temper,\" one of his assistants, Jean Comte de Limur, would later remark. \"He didn't like people very much.... He was not friendly at all with anybody. And he was peculiar.\" The first serious consequence of his short temper came about in late 1917, when he was fired by Universal after disagreements with the studio bosses. Following a two-year professional lull, a stint with the Royal Canadian Air Force, an unsuccessful marriage to actress Doris Pawn, a successful return to Universal, and two popular pictures for Metro, Ingram was selected for the plum job of directing The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. June Mathis, one of the most powerful women in Hollywood at that time, had persuaded Metro officials to give the twenty-seven-year-old Irishman a chance after working with him in Hearts Are Trumps. In spite of the solid craftsmanship of Ingram's earlier work, the masterful care and attention to pictorial detail he brought to The Four Horsemen came as a surprise. Much like Stroheim, Ingram wanted total control over his films and tirelessly strove for realism in every aspect of their production. In The Four Horsemen, for example, he demanded that Rudolph Valentino and Alice Terry speak their (inaudible) lines in French so as to give greater authenticity to their characters. Ingram's obsessive care paid off once again with the July 1921 release of The Conquering Power—also starring Terry and Valentino, and with more inaudible French dialogue. Critics and audiences alike were captivated by the picture's painstaking detail, despite a production environment fraught with problems. During the making of The Conquering Power, Valentino—pushed by then lover Natacha Rambova—fought Metro for a steeper raise than the extra $50 a week the studio had given him after The Four Horsemen. Metro would go only as high as another $50 (for a total of $400). Feeling exploited, the angry star refused to cooperate with Ingram throughout the production, an attitude that led to volcanic fights with the pugnacious director. Upon the picture's completion, Valentino moved to Famous Players—Lasky, where, for $500 a week, he starred that same year in another blockbuster, The Sheik— thus confirming his reputation as the great screen lover of the era.\n\nRamon's Columbus\n\n• 29\n\nA more serious professional loss for Ingram was the departure of June Mathis, who also left Metro for Famous Players. According to cinematographer John F. Seitz, Mathis already resented Ingram's getting too much credit for The Four Horsemen and was infuriated by both the director's and the studio's treatment of her beloved Valentino. Due to Mathis's abrupt departure, her unfinished screenplay for Ingram's next project, the bucolic Turn to the Right, had to be completed by Mary O'Hara (the future author of My Friend Flicka). Two years later, Ingram's falling-out with Mathis would prove tremendously costly to him; but for now, Metro retained enough confidence in the director to entrust him with the studio's most distinguished production for the following year: an elaborate screen adaptation of Sir Anthony Hope's 1894 swashbuckling novel The Prisoner of Zenda. In the early 1920s, the success of the German import Madame Dubarry and of the Douglas Fairbanks swashbucklers The Mark of Zorro and The Three Musketeers led to a vogue for costume spectacles. Cosmopolitan produced When Knighthood Was in Flower, Famous Players—Lasky came up with To Have and to Hold, Griffith filmed Orphans of the Storm, First National starred Richard Barthelmess in The Fighting Blade, and Fairbanks himself got busy again working on his screen version of Rohin Hood. Cecil B. DeMille wanted to produce The Prisoner of Zenda with Wallace Reid in the lead, but DeMille had a formidable rival to contend with. Zenda was said to be the first novel Ingram had ever read, and the Metro contract director was determined to translate it into film. Set in the mythical kingdom of Ruritama, The Prisoner of Zenda is a tale of love and betrayal, honor and greed, exchanged identities and rousing swordfighting: the weakling King Rudolf is kidnapped by his villainous half brother's gang, led by the suave Rupert of Hentzau, and must be temporarily replaced by a vacationing Englishman. Metro's extravagant adaptation was to be based both on the Hope novel and on the Edward Rose play that had opened in London in 1896.\n\nThe story goes that while directing The Conquering Power, Ingram picked Ramon out of the ranks of extras as a potential threat to an increasingly difficult Valentino. Ingram vowed that he would turn the young unknown into a star, and thus demonstrate to the temperamental Italian that he was not indispensable. \"That was studio publicity—the usual bunk,\" Novarro, who did not even work in that Ingram picture, would inform writer DeWitt Bodeen years later. \"It didn't happen like that at all.\" In all probability, Ingram first noticed Ramon when Ferdinand Earle\n\n50 . BEYOND PARADISE showed him a cut of the as yet unreleased Rubaiyat. (Ingram had developed such a fascination with the poems of Omar Khayyam that he had once worked on his own translation.) Not long afterward, Ingram saw Ramon perform at the Hollywood Community Theater, at the suggestion of Margaret Loomis, a dancer and actress then playing a supporting role in the directors Turn to the Right and Ramon's partner in a Spanish pantomime called The Royal Fandango. Liam O'Leary asserts that \"Ingram was impressed with the boy, and felt that here was the substitute for Valentino. There were the good looks, grace of movement, the Latin temperament, all allied to real acting ability.\" Margaret Ettinger concurred in Picture-Play: \"Mr. Ingram was looking for a 'Rupert [of Hentzau],' and Ramon was the type he desired.\" According to Novarro, however, it took more than dancing the fandango for him to land the role of the debonair Ruritaman schemer. Margaret Loomis, probably aware that Ramon had lost the Monte Cristo role because of his lack of public recognition, urged him to see Ingram, as the director was not averse to hiring an unknown. Following his Fandango partner's advice, Ramon headed for 1721 Romaine Avenue, near downtown Hollywood, where, in the words of columnist Adela Rogers St. Johns, Metro Pictures stood \"so prettily, all shining white and bright green shutters and well-kept lawns, clipped hedges and little flower beds.\" Reaching Ingram amid these well-tended confines, however, turned out to be more difficult than the aspiring actor had expected. \"When I went to the Metro casting office and asked to see Mr. Ingram,\" Novarro told Bodeen, \"I got exactly nowhere.\" After leaving Metro, the dejected Ramon headed to the nearby Hollywood Studios, where Ferdinand Earle was editing The Rubaiyat. Once there, he persuaded Earle to write him a personal letter of introduction to Ingram, which read: \"My dear Mr. Ingram: Columbus discovered America today [October 12], a few hundred years ago, and you may date today as your discovery of Ramon. He has walked away with The Rubaiyat. I take the liberty of introducing him to you.\" With Earle's letter in hand, Ramon bypassed the casting director and headed straight to Ingram's set. The director received the short, dark twentytwo-year-old with courtesy, but remarked that he envisioned Rupert of Hentzau as a mature, six-foot-tall, Teutonic-looking actor. \"I had my makeup kit with me,\" Novarro later recalled, \"and asked him to describe exactly what type he had in mind.\" Ingram drew four sketches of his mental image of Rupert of Hentzau's face on the back of Earle's letter. \"My heart sank when I saw mustaches and a short Prussian beard,\" continued Novarro. \"I\n\nRamon's Columbus\n\n• 31\n\nwas very young then and my own beard took months to become even scraggly.\" Ingram, impressed by Ramon's eagerness, let him test for the part the following day. He liked the youths performance, but still thought him too young. Even after a second test, for which the makeup man provided Ramon with a false mustache and goatee, Ingram still considered the young Mexican too immature for the role—until he came up with the idea of having Ramon sport a monocle. \"When Mr. Ingram ran that [third] test off, he was pleased,\" Novarro later remembered. Metro immediately put the ecstatic actor on its payroll for $100 a week (approximately $1,000 today), while Ingram promised that \"I would be his new leading man and that he would groom me for stardom. I was deliriously happy, and didn't dare believe it. But that's exactly what he did.\" Had Ramon been hired to play the small role in Monte Cristo, which was in production at the time of The Prisoner of Zenda casting, he would have missed his chance of being discovered by one of the most prominent directors in the industry. A fervent believer in the \"All's for the best\" philosophy, whenever Novarro reminisced about this stroke of luck that had completely changed the course of his life, he would invariably marvel, \"It's just wonderful how fate works.\"\n\nProduction on The Prisoner of Z.enda began early in November 1921, with Lewis Stone, one of the rare actors Ingram respected, top-billed in the dual roles of King Rudolf of Ruritania and the Englishman Rudolf Rassendyll; Ingram's fiancee, Alice Terry, as Princess Flavia; and Barbara La Marr, known as \"the girl who was too beautiful,\" as Antoinette de Mauban, the object of Rupert of Hentzau's lust. With Ingram's exacting guidance, Ramon succeeded in appearing as skilled on-screen as his more seasoned fellow performers, and later remembered his experiences during filming as \"a lot of fencing, a lot of hard work, very happy.\" Despite the close friendship that steadily developed between them, Novarro always saw Ingram as a figure to be deferred to. The director, for his part, felt paternalistic toward the young Mexican six years his junior. Even years later, Novarro would often refer to his early mentor as \"Mr. Ingram.\" On the other hand, there was never such formality between Ramon and Ingram's lovely wife-to-be. Born in Vincennes, Indiana, on July 24, 1899, Alice Frances Taaffe moved\n\n32 . BEYOND PARADISE with her family to Southern California in the early 1910s, where she began working as an extra at the Thomas Ince Studio in Culver City. Like Novarro, Alice went through a long and arduous apprenticeship, appearing in numerous bits and a few small supporting parts, until landing her first major role in Ingram s Hearts Are Trumps in 1920. To look acceptable on-screen, the chocolate eclair—loving actress had to go on a strict diet, have her teeth straightened, and don a blond wig. The look matched her cool aloofness so well that the auburn-haired Alice Taaffe, now renamed Alice Terry, became a (near) permanent film blonde. Terry achieved top leading-lady status in her next picture, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, though she was never to reach true stardom. That was partly due to her own lack of ambition, and partly because the cool screen persona projected by the warm, witty, and extroverted real-life Terry was too aloof for most filmgoers. Even critics felt she was too reserved, and frequently remarked upon her chilly demeanor. Ironically, Terry's performances remain effective because of that very restraint, especially when compared to those of her overly emotive costars. Ingram and Terry first met in 1917 while she was working as an extra in the director's Humdrum Brown. They became more closely acquainted two years later, after Terry, still working as an extra, fled in tears from the set of The Day She Paid. Ingram had screamed at her during filming, but later apologized and asked her to accept a small role in Shore Acres, which he was going to direct at Metro. From then on, Terry played the female lead in all but two of Ingram's films. o What began as a brother-sister relationship eventually developed into a romance of sorts. Ingram was often too deeply immersed in his work to give much attention to Terry, though he did find time for their wedding on Saturday, November 5, 1921. Even then, the director would not allow marriage to disrupt his work. The couple were back on The Prisoner of Zenda set the following Monday.\n\nAs Zenda was to be one of the major Hollywood productions of the year, Ramon realized that this was his chance to prove himself as star material. If he failed, another opportunity might not be forthcoming. Luckily, he could count on both the director and the leading lady for absolute support. During a location shoot in the San Bernardino Mountains, when all members of the Zenda company were required to share rooms, Ramon was paired with Malcolm McGregor, a handsome young actor who had known Ingram\n\nRamon's Columbus\n\n•\n\n33\n\nat Yale. The morning after their first night at the inn, a shaky and whitefaced McGregor approached Terry and declared he would not spend another night in the same room with Ramon. McGregor refused to elaborate, but Terry assumed that Ramon had made unwanted advances toward him. Terry's—and surely Ingram's—discovery of Ramon's sexual orientation made no difference to them. The subject was probably left undiscussed, but Ramon knew that he had been accepted as he was. Regardless of his sexuality, he was to have the lead in all four of Ingram's productions in the next two years.\n\nIn late March 1922, a little more than one month after production had ended on The Prisoner of Zenda, shooting began on Ingram's next project, a remake of Black Orchids, one of the director's own 1917 Universal releases. According to film editor Grant Whytock, the previous version had been \"murdered by the front office for being too erotic,\" so Ingram had decided to tackle the same story again, making it \"twice as erotic.\" The director himself wrote the scenario, which was inspired by Vendetta, English fantasist Marie Corelli's Gothic tale of lust, murder, and revenge: A novelist reads to his capricious daughter his latest story about an alluring Parisian fortune-teller who wreaks havoc in the lives of men—one is poisoned, another is mortally wounded in a duel, and a third is stabbed. The vamp gets her comeuppance when she is locked in a dungeon by one of the betrayed lovers and left to starve to death. The writer's daughter is understandably impressed by the story and decides that instead of a life of fanciful dalliances, she will accept the love of her faithful suitor. It would be a challenge to Ingrams trademark visual flair to turn this cheaply lurid tale into a major Metro production. After a brief return to the Hollywood Community Theater, where he played a small role as an Italian doctor in Enter Madame, Ramon was given two roles in Black Orchids. He was to portray the vamp's true love, Ivan de Maupin, and the young suitor Henri in the wraparound story. Alice Terry wanted to play the killer-vamp Zareda, and was actually announced for the role in early reports, but Ingram felt she could not project a sufficiently wicked persona. Instead, he chose fellow Zenda player Barbara La Marr, who would also play the writer's frivolous daughter. Others in the production included Zenda cast members Lewis Stone as the man who ultimately destroys Zareda and her lover; Ingram regular Edward Connelly; and an orangutan named Joe Martin, a holdover from the 1917 film and the star of A Monkey\n\n34 .
