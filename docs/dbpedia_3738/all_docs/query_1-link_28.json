        "text": "The film opens with images of the modern motor vehicles which comprise Surrey Fire Brigade's Mobile Fire Column. The stationary vehicles include Radio Equipped Land Rovers, a Maintenance Van, a Communication Unit lorry, a Foam Tender lorry, a Canteen Van and a Dispatch Riders Motorcycle. The film proceeds to show some of the contemporary fire fighting technology being employed by the Brigade. Four firemen carry a Self Propelled Pump, whilst another balances two lightweight pipes on his shoulders. There are also images of a completed fibreglass tank and sections of an experimental concrete tank. Elsewhere one of the firemen models a mobile radio wireless which is strapped across his chest.\n\nThe film ends with a demonstration of a new pump, pipes and hoses which has been staged both for the film's viewers and for the official spectators who have gathered at Wotton House. The firemen pump water from a stream along half a mile of piping to the fibreglass tank. The water in the tank supplies ca. fifteen powerful hoses which are filmed shooting powerful jets of water high into the air."
