        "text": "What are 'forever chemicals'?\n\n'Forever chemicals' have been widely used across the globe since the 1940s. They comprise per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) which is the collective name given to a group of fluorinated compounds. PFAS are ubiquitous in nature due to their inability to break down in nature. The Environmental Agency report that the long history of their use has resulted in “a legacy of environmental contamination that is challenging to remediate”. Furthermore, the chemicals frequently labelled as “toxic” have been linked to health problems since the 1990s.\n\nWhat is AFFF Foam?\n\nAqueous film-forming foams (AFFF) is a synthetic-based foam used to extinguish flammable or combustible liquid fuel fires, such as blazes involving oil and gas (also known as Class B fires). AFFF was reportedly developed in the 1960s by chemical giant 3M before being used for many decades by Fire Departments internationally as the “gold standard” for extinguishing liquid fuel fires. Additionally, the substance was frequently used by fire brigades in training exercises.\n\nConversely, this once integral and life-saving substance is now deemed operationally dangerous by the international community and is being phased out globally. This is because the foam contains highly toxic “forever chemicals”.\n\nHealth Risks\n\nThe European Commission recently assigned the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) with the task of investigating the environmental and health risks posed by the use of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in firefighting foams.\n\nTheir report dated 23 March 2022 confirmed that “there is evidence to suggest that exposure to PFASs can lead to adverse health effects in humans (by eating or drinking food or water contaminated by PFASs).\n\nIn particular the US EPA22 highlight studies that indicate the long-chain (chain length of eight or more) species PFOS and PFOA can cause reproductive and developmental, liver and kidney, and immunological effects on laboratory animals. Furthermore, both chemicals have caused tumours in animal studies”.\n\nThe Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the EPA have linked PFAS to health problems, including:\n\nIncreases in cholesterol\n\nHigh blood pressure and preeclampsia in pregnant women\n\nDecreased response to vaccination in children\n\nImmune system changes\n\nLiver enzyme changes\n\nDecreases in infant birth weight\n\nIncreased risk of certain cancers, including kidney and testicular cancer\n\nThyroid disorders\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) also identify that PFAS in AFFF are toxic and carcinogenic to animals and potentially to humans. They have conducted several studies which found that human exposure to PFAS results in a significantly increased rate of kidney, prostate and testicular cancer. Accordingly, AFFF is considered an occupational hazard which has been linked to cancers and other health concerns.\n\nRegulation of AFFF\n\nHistorically, a key ingredient of AFFF was Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) which is a type of PFA subsequently found to be toxic.\n\nScientists and health experts have communicated their concerns with the potential hazards of exposure to PFAS since the 1970s.\n\nMore recently, the global community has begun to acknowledge the potential damage “forever chemicals” are causing to the environment and to human health and a movement ensued to restrict their use.\n\nNevertheless, it was not until 2002 that the manufacture of PFOS was largely discontinued, when US manufacturer 3M, ceased production.\n\nThereafter, in May 2009, PFOS were included in Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) which restricted the manufacture, import and export of PFOS.\n\nFollowing the discontinuance of PFOS based foaming agents, fire departments relied on foam containing fluorinated and hydrocarbon-based products. However, these foaming agents contain PFOAs which are a different type of PFA. In May 2019 further restrictions were implemented under the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 in respect of the use of PFOAs and PFOAs were added to Annex A of the convention to be eliminated.\n\nCurrent changes to legislation\n\nIn keeping with EU Regulations, since July 4, 2020 the following has been required:\n\nAll existing stocks of AFFF containing PFOA installed in a premises may only be used for Class B fires (the burning of flammable liquids).\n\nUse of AFFF containing PFOA is prohibited for training purposes.\n\nTesting of equipment/systems of AFFF containing PFOA is only allowed if releases are contained and can be properly disposed of.\n\nSince 01 January 2023 fire-fighting foam containing PFOAs have been prohibited if the foam cannot be contained or collected after a fire has been extinguished. From July 2025, there will be a total ban on the use of fire-fighting foam containing PFOA. The fire-fighting industry has long required environmentally friendly, non-toxic foaming agents but it is only now that the industry is recognising the potential benefits in switching to 'fluorine free' foams.\n\nAlthough the initiative to restrict the use of AFFF is relatively new, as mentioned above, concerns have been raised about the use of 'forever chemicals' since the 1970s.\n\nA valid question arising from this information is why has it taken so long for this potentially harmful substance to be banned? The answer is unclear but one possible explanation is that manufacturers of AFFF may have knowingly sought to prioritise monetary gains at the expense of the wider public health concerns.\n\nUS Class Actions\n\nClass actions in the USA have been instigated against manufacturers of AFFF. The cases suggest that manufacturers of AFFF which include 3M and DuPont knew or ought to have known that the substances caused an elevated risk of cancers. It has been suggested that manufacturers became aware of the health implications of long-term exposure to PFAs in the 1990s.\n\nThe City of Stuart on the Atlantic Coast of Florida alleges that AFFF used during training exercises by fireman contaminated its water supply and as a result the city is suing manufacturers of AFFF (including 3M) for their failure to warn, amongst other allegations. The trial is set to begin on June 5, 2023.\n\nAs of 15 December 2022, a total of 3,399 AFFF (firefighting foam) class action cases had been filed in the USA. The nature of these cases is two-fold:\n\nClaims are brought on behalf of fire fighters who claim prolonged exposure to the AFFF Foam has caused them to develop cancer.\n\nClaims are also brought on behalf of individuals adversely effected by contamination of PFAS into their water.\n\nInitially, 3M sought to argue that they should be immune from liability because the AFFF products were produced in keeping with a government contract. In September 2022, the Court rejected their defence as 3M withheld information from the government about the potential health risks of AFFF. It is not yet clear how these cases will pan out, but it is possible that claims of a similar nature could be brought through the UK Courts.\n\nDo I have a claim?\n\nOccupational AFFF Exposure"
