        "text": "\"'Looking for Life': Traces of Slavery in the Structures and Social Lives of Southern Swahili Towns,\" by Felicitas Becker. Abstract: This article traces the history of slavery and of post-slavery struggles for livelihood and status in the layout, the physical structures, and the social lives of three towns on the southern Swahili Coast: Kilwa, Mikindani, and Lindi. These towns were long surrounded by plantations that relied on the labor of enslaved people. In the first decades of the twentieth century, slave populations dissipated quickly. In towns, the colonial cash crop economy, voluntary rural-urban migration, and the decline of slave-owning elites combined to allow former slaves to assimilate and adopt new urbanite identities. Sufi orders played a central role in affording ex-slaves a respectable presence in town. Nevertheless, former slave owners and former slaves lived in different parts of these towns, former slaves' livelihoods were more precarious, and the imputation of slave origins remains offensive, even today. Indeed, the era of slavery still divides people and still engages the social imagination. Keywords: East Africa, slavery, post-slavery, Sufism, Islam, inequality, urban geography, villagization (link).\n\nThe Journal provides a focal point for peer-reviewed publications in interdisciplinary studies in archaeology, history, material culture, and heritage dynamics concerning African descendant populations and cultures across the globe. We welcome articles on broad topics, including the historical processes of culture, economics, gender, power, and racialization operating within and upon African descendant communities. We seek to engage scholarly, professional, and community perspectives on the social dynamics and historical legacies of African descendant cultures and communities worldwide.\n\nWe are proud to celebrate our journal's 10th anniversary! And belated congratulations to lead editor Lydia Wilson Marshall for receiving the John L. Cotter Award for excellence in historical archaeology from the Society for Historical Archaeology (link)!\n\n[Return to table of contents]\n\nRestorative Justice in Heritage Studies & Archaeology\n\nA New Book Series with Routledge Press\n\nOverview: Restorative justice in heritage and archaeology embraces initiatives for reconciliation of past societal transgressions using processes that are multivocal, dialogic, historically informed, community based, negotiated, and transformative. This series will present works that promote the active and often unconventional ways that archaeologists, historians, and heritage scholars are contributing to a process of remaking. Our authors work to define and illuminate the best practices for restorative justice in these fields and to identify how practitioners and their collaborators are working to redress, reconcile, and remake contemporary society.\n\nBackground: The concept of \"restorative justice\" has been employed mainly in criminal justice and human rights contexts. For example, restorative justice in the realm of criminal sanctions involves a process of justice other than penalties and imprisonment, and typically entails rehabilitation of offenders through reconciliation with victims and a related, stakeholder community. Such initiatives emerged in the 1970s as ways to address the shortcomings of Western legal systems. New approaches focus on perpetrators of wrongs taking responsibility and acknowledging the harms they created. At the same time, victims of harm have a space to grieve, express their perspectives and stories, seek answers and responses to their needs, and repair relationships.\n\nFor example, an archaeological and historical study of past sites of enslavement could provide a focal point for creating new commemorations negotiated among members of local and descendant communities related to those sites. Existing memorials to historical figures who engaged in past oppressive regimes provide similar opportunities for dialog and negotiation to envision new ways to address the context and significance of those figures and the many people who were targets of their oppression. Such restorative justice efforts typically focus on multiple perspectives and modes of reconciliation, rather than a narrow vision of retribution and punishment. Reparation initiatives are often multivocal, layered, multiplex, and visionary in this way.\n\nOther examples of such restorative justice projects in archaeology and heritage studies include the current work in Tulsa, Oklahoma to document the 1921 destruction of Black Wall Street and the continuing dynamics of African-American heritage in Tulsa to the present. Elsewhere, archaeologists are collaborating with members of African-American and Indigenous communities to search for missing children. Similar projects search for the remains of the casualties of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). Heritage activists also engage with instances of apartheid, cultural destruction through assimilation policies, and genocide in several countries, including work of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions in Canada and South Africa. These examples highlight the bilateral, dialogic, and ongoing process of working towards transformative, meaningful, and enduring justice for aggrieved parties.\n\nSeries Editors: Nedra K.

The center will help to grow the network in South Carolina by serving as a resource to property owners, community leaders, and organizations interested in joining the network.\"\n\n\"Congress created the African American Civil Rights Network in 2017 to present a comprehensive narrative of the people, places, and events associated with the civil rights movement in the United States. The network encompasses historic sites, museums, libraries, and interpretive programs to commemorate, honor, and understand the history, significance, and ongoing relevance of the movement.\"\n\n\"The partnership will help the center preserve and grow collections, including new oral histories; train K-12teachers; create and host public programs; and develop exhibits that chronicle the history of the civil rights movement in South Carolina and the United States.\"\n\n[Read this full article online >>>].\n\n[Return to table of contents]\n\nClotilda Descendants Marked Anniversary of Last Slave Ship\n\nBy NBCnews.com\n\n\"Descendants of the last African people abducted into slavery and brought to America's shores gathered over the weekend on the banks of an Alabama river to pay tribute to their ancestors.\"\n\n\"The descendants of the 110 people aboard the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to bring enslaved African people to the United States, held a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the vessel's arrival.\"\n\n\"Dressed in white and walking slowly to the beat of an African drum, the descendants made their way to the banks of the Mobile River near Alabama's coast. A wreath of white, yellow and red flowers was carried into the river by a kayaker and released into the waters.\"\n\n\"The event marked the anniversary of the ship arriving 162 years ago with 110 enslaved people brought to the country against their will, Darron Patterson, president of the Clotilda Descendants Association, said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.\"\n\n\"In 1860, the Clotilda illegally transported 110 people from what is now the west African nation of Benin to Mobile, Alabama. The voyage, which happened decades after the law banning the importation of slaves had taken effect, began as a bet when a wealthy plantation owner wagered he could import a shipload of slaves without being caught.\"\n\n\"The 2019 discovery of the remnants of the Clotilda sparked renewed interest in its saga. But Patterson said the focus should be on the people it carried.\"\n\n\"'It's not about the ship. It's not about sails or nails or wood. It's about the people who were in the cargo hold. And their stories were amazing stories,' he said. Patterson's great-great-grandfather, Kupolleea beekeeper, farmer and woodworkerwas one of the 110 on the ship.\"\n\n\"The captives of the Clotilda endured a cruel ocean voyage packed into a cargo hold and five years of slavery but were able to maintain their African customs, Patterson said.\"\n\n\"'The biggest thing for us is to make sure that no one ever forgets this story... America has a long way to go in learning how to embrace its history, including its dark slave history,' Patterson said.\"\n\n\"The 'landing' ceremony was held near the bridge to the Africatown community founded by Clotilda survivors after the Civil War.\"\n\n\"'Proud of my heritage. I'd like to say even more so proud of the resilience and the legacy that they left behind,' descendant Ronald Ellis Jr told Fox10.\"\n\n[Read this full article online >>>].\n\n[Return to table of contents]\n\nRecent Dissertations on History\n\nThe following, non-exhaustive list of dissertations and masters theses on African diaspora history for the period since September 2010 was compiled by Chris Fennell based on listings in the Proquest.com service.

In The Devil's Half Acre, New York Times bestselling author Kristen Green draws on years of research to tell the extraordinary and little-known story of young Mary Lumpkin, an enslaved woman who blazed a path of liberation for thousands. She was forced to have the children of a brutal slave trader and live on the premises of his slave jail, known as the \"Devil's Half Acre.\" When she inherited the jail after the death of her slaveholder, she transformed it into \"God's Half Acre,\" a school where Black men could fulfill their dreams. It still exists today as Virginia Union University, one of America's first Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\nA sweeping narrative of a life in the margins of the American slave trade, The Devil's Half Acre brings Mary Lumpkin into the light. This is the story of the resilience of a woman on the path to freedom, her historic contributions, and her enduring legacy .\n\n[Return to table of contents]\n\nNew Book\n\nInside/Outside: Adventures in Caribbean History and Anthropology\n\nBy Richard Price\n\nUniversity of Georgia Press, Cloth\n\n272 pp., ISBN-13: 978-0820362656, 2022.\n\nDescription from the Publisher:\n\nRichard Price's story is told with honesty, humor, and insight. Inside/Outside relates his life as an anthropologist, historian, and Caribbeanist  from conducting predawn discussions with Maroon historians deep in the rainforest of Suriname to editing the world's first book series on Atlantic history and culture; from weekly meetings with Claude Le´vi-Strauss in Paris to long-term collaboration with Sidney Mintz; from adventures at sea with Martiniquan fishermen to negotiating the ivory towers of Harvard, Yale, and Johns Hopkins; from explorations of the art of Romare Bearden to number crunching from the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database. It is a tale of life experiences and often-unconventional life decisions, inside (and outside) the academic world. Readers look over Price's shouldersand those of his wife and research partner, Sally Priceas he developed the ideas for some of the twentieth- and twenty-first century's most important books in the fields of history, anthropology, and Caribbean studies. Includes discussions of research and field work on African diaspora cultures and Saamaka history in Suriname, Martinique, and Guyane (French Guiana).\n\n[Return to table of contents]\n\nNew Exhibit\n\nSpirit in the Dark: Religion in Black Music, Activism and Popular Culture\n\nNational Museum of African American History and Culture\n\nSmithsonian Mall, Washington, DC.\n\nNovember 2022 to November 2023\n\nFrom the Museum:\n\n\"Spirit in the Dark\" opened in November at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Sometimes in the foreground, sometimes in the background, at times in the shadowsreligion is essential to the story of Black America. The exhibition includes photographs of several prominent African Americans, such as Aretha Franklin, Duke Ellington, Marvin Gaye, Angela Davis, Malcolm X, Maya Angelou, Reverend Ike and Jesse Jackson, examining religion's impact on their lives and the larger Black community. Objects in the museum's collection testify to religion's role in the struggle for human dignity and social equality. \"Spirit in the Dark\" examines Black religious life through a selection of photographs from the Johnson Publishing Company, publisher of Ebony, Jet and Negro Digest.\n\nThe images in the exhibition spotlight noteworthy individualsincluding religious and political leaders, musicians, authors, athletes, activists and educatorsand are supported by an array of objects from the museum's collection, many on display for the first time. Diverse aspects of the Black Religious experience are revealed by stories of artists blurring the boundaries between the holy and the profane, Black religious leaders bearing witness to wrongs and lighting the pathway to freedom and activists articulating the complex dimensions of the suffering and trauma of Black people in America.\n\nCurated by the museum's Center for the Study of African American Religious Life, a selection of musical and spoken-word performances evokes themes and subjects explored in the \"Spirit in the Dark\" exhibition. The tracks, spanning an array of genres and eras, express diverse artistic visions and religious experiences.\n\n[Return to table of contents]\n\nNew Exhibit\n\nThe City Beyond the White City:\n\nRace, Two Chicago Homes, and their Neighborhoods\n\nNovember 3, 2022 to October 28, 2023\n\nPhysical Exhibit at Charnley-Persky House, 1365 N. Astor St., Chicago\n\nVirtual Exhibit at beyondthewhitecity.org\n\nFrom the Curators:\n\nThe City Beyond the White City: Race, Two Chicago Homes, and their Neighborhoods, connects the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, also called the \"White City,\" to the material, spatial, and social histories of two 1892 structuresthe Charnley-Persky House and the Mecca Flatslocated respectively on Chicago's privileged Near North and disinvested Near South Sides. The physical exhibition, featuring archaeologically recovered artifacts, is accompanied by a virtual exhibit; together they frame the history of race, structures of racism, and the built environment in Chicago.\n\nThe City Beyond the White City features over 30 individual artifacts excavated from the Charnley-Persky House (Adler & Sullivan, 18911892) and from the former Mecca Flats (Edbrooke & Burnham, 18911892). Together, archival documents, oral histories, and 19th- and early-20th-century artifacts unearthed in archaeological digs are used to interpret a nuanced public history of race and place in Chicago for student and public audiences.\n\nThe exhibition is co-curated by Dr. Rebecca Graff, associate professor of anthropology at Lake Forest College, and the late Pauline Saliga, former executive director of the Society of Architectural Historians and the Charnley-Persky House Museum Foundation.\n\n\"The structures themselvesthe Charnley-Persky House and the Mecca Flatsset the stories of those who lived there in motion,\" said Dr. Graff. \"But ultimately, this exhibition is an intervention between unpeopled architectural histories and narrativity about race and racism in Chicago that lacks a connection to the built environment and human experiences of place, not least the historic experiences of racism in Chicago. Archaeological insights plus architectural histories help to get us there.\"\n\nThe exhibition is organized thematically into four sections. The first section, \"Race and the World's Fair Marketplace,\" looks at the Fair as a literal marketplace for commodities and an ideological marketplace for schemes on race. Late-19th-century racial ideologies are not always central to discussions of sites of architectural significance. But to understand people's experiences of the built environment on three scalesthe neighborhoods, the buildings, and the objects they left behindthe exhibit starts with the racial ideologies that suffused the 1893 Fair to see how they were made material at home.\n\nThe second section looks at consumption, health, and sanitation in turn-of-the-century Chicago. Contrary to what might be expected, the people who lived and worked in the Charnley House and in the Mecca Flats at the turn of the 20th century shared similar challenges to their health and sanitary infrastructureones that defied a simple socioeconomic pattern.\n\nIdeologies of the domestic sphere and the women, domestic servants, and children who formed it, were undergoing a rapid transformation. Racialized notions of American womanhood, in part impacted by the ratification of the 20th Amendment, played out differently at the three sites. \"Women, Children, and the Domestic Sphere,\" focuses on six notable women from the three sites: Nancy Green and Sophia Hayden; Helen Charnley and Marion Stephens; and Madame Nobia A. Franklin and Gwendolyn Brooks. Each of these women highlight the social history that converges around the sites. The section also looks at the children of Bronzeville and the Gold Coast, and the racialization of domestic laborers at the Mecca Flats and the Charnley House.\n\nThe final section, \"Urban Renewal and Racial Ideology,\" is perhaps the most significant because it forces the viewer to confront the lingering inequities built into American cities like Chicago. Mid-20th-century federal and state urban renewal programs built upon the slum clearance legislation of the 19th century, destroying countless historic structures and vital neighborhoods largely without considering the interests and desires of the affected communities. Some of the most egregious examples of this in Chicago took place in Bronzeville, but the Gold Coast also experienced this destruction.\n\n[Return to table of contents]\n\nNew Podcast\n\nKinways: Black Museology Podcast\n\nBy Richard Paul Benjamin\n\nEpisodes available online\n\nFollow updates and discussions.\n\nDr. Benjamin is head of the International Slavery Museum and a visiting professor at the University of Liverpool's department of history.

Yet, the nature, temporality, and consequences of decolonization remain contested. The tragic loss of human lives, the erosion of indigenous cultures, religions and languages, along with the depletion of natural resources have continued well beyond the period of decolonization. In fact, independent nations on the African continent and in the diaspora continue to contend with the hegemonic presence of former imperial powers as well as newer economic and resource-hungry global powers such as China and the United States. Efforts to denounce these global hegemonies and regain control of the land, politics, economy, language, and history of the African continent and its diasporas often go unnoticed in Western media, and in Western classrooms. In contrast, this conference, jointly organized by the New York African Studies Association (NYASA) and the University of Calabar, Nigeria aims to create dialogues and encourage exchanges between scholars, teachers, students, and community members, around the question of global hegemonies in Africa and the African diaspora, and the various ways in which their influence has been and continues to be addressed and combatted.\n\nWe invite papers that examine the continuing decolonization of global hegemonies in Africa and the African diaspora in conjunction with questions of sources and methods, knowledge production, migration, health, labor, gender and sexuality, performing and visual arts, religion and spirituality, artefacts and museums, civic society, mental health and trauma, information technologies, economy, social sciences, pan-African youth mobilization, equity and integration in higher education, political engagement, environmental studies, and architecture. We welcome contributors from a range of disciplines, including political science, history, geography, architecture, literature, museum studies, medicine, law, religious studies, gender studies, music, Anthropology, sociology, archaeology, environmental studies, business and economics, etc. We also invite proposals from undergraduate students, graduate students, independent scholars and practitioners, as well as community leaders and members of the civic society. While the conference committee is particularly interested in proposals on the theme of decolonization and hegemonic discourses, we will also welcome proposals for presentations, panels, posters, and roundtables that address any dimension of African and African diasporic studies. We are also interested in presentations that reflect African knowledge productions systems such as music, dance, drumming and story-telling. Participants are also welcome to present their papers in African languages.\n\nSubmission Guidelines: Abstracts should be emailed to nyasacalabar@gmail.com; Abstracts should be between 250 to 350 words; Participants should submit only one paper abstract; Papers must have a maximum of two presenters; Roundtables and panels may have up to 6 participants; January 27, 2023: Deadline for submission of panels, roundtable, papers, and workshop proposals. We have a rolling review of abstracts.; April 20: Deadline for Early Bird Registration. At the time of submitting your proposal, please indicate if you will need media resources (e.g. Audio-Visual Equipment) for your presentation. Also let us know if your presentation would be in an African language.

It is envisioned that the theme will encourage individual papers and symposia that address the increasingly global character of the discipline in the past, present and future, as well as themes of movement and diaspora, and industrialization and mechanization. Many European archaeologists also define 'historical' archaeology differently, noting that the historical record dates back to earlier periods, and this conference may provide the opportunity to explore disciplinary definitions in a global context while still focusing on the post-1500 world.\n\nSHA's annual conferences include many presentations of subjects concerning African diaspora archaeology.\n\nThe conference will include a roundtable discussion on \"Repatriation, Reparation, and Reclamation,\" moderated by Kisha Supernant, Director, Institute of Prairie and Indigenous Archaeology. \"In this roundtable, participants will discuss their experiences with issues relating to the repatriation of ancestors and belongings, the need for reparation, and the role of historical archaeology in reclaiming narratives of the past by communities impacted by colonization. The intention of the roundtable is to foster connection and conversation between SHA members who are actively working on repatriation and reparation, especially Black and Indigenous archaeologists, and to discuss how to move forward in ways that center the needs and voices of descendant and ancestral communities.\"\n\nAnother roundtable discussion will focus on \"Interrupting Racism and Sexism in Archaeology,\" moderated by Mia L. Carey and L. Charde Reid: \"Has racism and sexism impacted your academic or professional career in archeology? If yes, join us for an interactive discussion about how to identify and interrupt racism and sexism in the discipline. After a brief refresher on the impact of unconscious bias and microaggressions, participants will use the \"calling out, calling out\" inclusion and equity tool to recognize, name, and address behaviors that cause historically marginalized harm in academia; CRM; hiring retention and recruitment; fieldwork; and training. By the end, participants will be able to walk away with practical tools for combating racism and sexism across the discipline.\"\n\nThe conference program also includes symposia on subjects such as: Global Archaeologies of the Long Emancipation; African American Death and Burial; Africa's Discovery of the World from Archaeological Perspectives: Revisiting Moments of First Contact, Colonialism, and Global Transformation; Materialities of (Un)Freedom: Examining the Material Consequences of Inequality within Historical Archaeology; Global Black Archaeologies: Mobilizing Critical, Anti-Racist, De/Anti-Colonial, and Black Feminist Archaeologies in Uncertain Times; \"Folkeliv\" and Black Folks' Lives: Archaeology, History, and Contemporary Black Atlantic Communities; Maritime Archaeology in West Africa; among others.\n\n[Return to table of contents]\n\nBook Review\n\nChristopher P. Barton. The Archaeology of Race and Class at Timbuctoo: A Black Community in New Jersey. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2022. 152 pp., with figures, tables, index (Cloth), ISBN-13: 9780813069272.\n\nReviewed for the African Diaspora Archaeology Newsletter by John P. McCarthy, RPA Retired (Dover, DE).\n\nDrawn from Barton's 2015 doctoral dissertation at Temple University, Identity, and Improvisation: Archaeology at the African American Community of Timbuctoo, New Jersey, this concise volume considers issues of the material expression of race and class as documented archaeology at a South Jersey community established in 1826 by formerly enslaved \"runaways\" and Free Blacks. Timbuctoo was one of a number of small African American communities formed at the margins of Northeastern population centers in the nineteenth-century including Sadlertown in Camden County also, like Timbuctoo, near Philadelphia and Shunk Hollow in Bergen County, outside New York City. Timbuctoo became an important stop on the \"Underground Railroad,\" assisting escapees as they traveled north to freedom.\n\nBarton's understanding of the intersectionality of race and class, as outlined in a chapter devoted to the topic, provides the theoretical structure of the project. The book also reviews the history of the community from documentary and oral sources, and explains how the archaeological investigation of the community was conducted as a deeply collaborative community project. Barton's study is introduced with a foreword by Guy Weston, a prominent member of the descendant and local communities. The results of geophysical survey and excavation work are reviewed, especially the results from excavating the Davis Site, a small house with cellar built sometime after 1879 and apparently abandoned in the 1920s-30s. Subsequently, it was the site of a community trash midden into the 1940s, from which over 15,000 artifacts were recovered.\n\nThe physical layout of the community, the use of yard space and the practice of \"yard sweeping,\" and consumer behaviors such as home canning, the purchase of commercial peanut butter, and the acquisition and display of select items collectively regarded as \"bric-a-brac,\" are among the topics explored in detail. Barton convincingly argues that persevering in a racialized, class-oriented society required African Americans to adopt a distinct world view that both enabled and restricted individual practice. He sees the actions of marginalized groups and individuals as improvisational responses developed from living on the social and economic periphery. However, the residents of Timbuctoo were not simply the victims of racial and class-based repression in their daily lives; rather, the members of this community were active social agents who used material goods as \"both reflectors and constructors of collective and individual identities\" (p. 108).\n\nIn his concluding comments, Barton notes the importance of the archaeological study of marginalized communities which shines light on all but unknown social actors from the past, showing how they, in this instance, used landscape, consumer culture, and their own resourcefulness to create meaning and empower themselves in the face of a broader culture of repression. These themes continue to resonate as the struggle against racism continues.\n\nThis is a finely crafted volume in which the reader is not drowned in the detailed minutia of archaeological data. Results are clearly and concisely discussed; the focus is refreshingly on the \"what\" and the \"why\" of its importance over the \"how\" of methods and data description. That said, I, for one, would like to know more about the recovered artifact assemblage, especially results usually collectively classified as \"small finds\" and \"personal items\" which are among the most powerful conveyers of meaning.\n\nIf there is a weakness to point to, it is that Barton has relied exclusively on the historical archaeological literature to develop his understanding of historic consumer culture and related behaviors. While his discussion of that literature is quite thorough, the lack of discussion of the work of other theorists such as Daniel Miller (Material Culture and Mass Consumption, 1987, Material Cultures: Why Some Things Matter, 1998), Colin Campbell (The Romantic Ethic and The Spirit of Modern Consumerism, 1987), and Michael Solomon (Consumer Behavior: Buying, Having, and Being, 1992) is regrettable.\n\nThe Archaeology of Race and Class at Timbuctoo: A Black Community in New Jersey is an important addition to the literature of the African Diaspora in the New World, and it will be engaging for anyone interested in African-American history and culture in the Northeast, or in consumer behavior in conditions of adversity. This study also presents a model of community engagement and participation that must be the future of an archaeological discipline that operates in the interests of more than those of the practitioners alone. As such, and due to its relative brevity, it is recommended for classroom use at undergraduate levels (a lower-priced, paperback edition will apparently be available in the future).\n\n[Return to table of contents]\n\nBook Review\n\nYesenia Barragan. Freedom's Captives: Slavery and Gradual Emancipation on the Colombian Black Pacific. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2021. 346 pp. (Paperback), with illustrations and maps. ISBN-13: ?978-1108941051.\n\nH-Net Book Review, published by H-LatAm, https://networks.h-net.org/h-latam (Nov. 2022).\n\nReviewed for H-LatAm by Angela Pérez-Villa (Western Michigan University).\n\nYesenia Barragan's long-awaited book is a welcome contribution both to Colombian historiography and to the scholarship on slavery and abolition in the Atlantic world. Barragan focuses on the northern Colombian Pacific lowlands to examine how enslaved and free African-descended people navigated the social entrapments that emerged between the promulgation of the Free Womb law in 1821which mandated that children born to enslaved mothers would not inherit their legal status as slavesand the final formal abolition of slavery in 1852. She refers to this thirty-one-year period as the time of \"gradual emancipation rule\" and argues that it was a distinct historical moment in which slaveholders paradoxically reinforced the exploitation and disciplining of captives under a system of slavery in decline. Her examination of this paradox in the province of Chocó reveals not only the pitfalls of liberal freedom but also the existence of other modes of freedom devised by enslaved men and women living in the Pacific lowlands. These modes of freedom, argues Barragan, constituted \"small-scale, ordinary revolutions\" that allow readers to learn about enslaved families' participation in the contentious legal terrains of gradual emancipation through decades of political turmoil, conservative backlash, and civil war (p. 281).\n\nThe book is structured in three parts that take readers on a journey through the social universe of the Black Pacific. Readers learn about the daily life of skilled enslaved people who navigated rivers or extracted gold and the critical questions that emerged about freedom and emancipation in the context of the Wars of Independence. Readers also learn about Colombian elites who debated, drafted, and ratified the Free Womb law in a nascent public sphere; the persistent actions of enslaved families to secure freedom; and eventually the constraints faced by former slaves determined to live autonomously in a deeply fragmented society. Barragan's commitment to upholding an \"ethics of historical care\" in this painstakingly documented book is demonstrated through her attention to detail and her creative effort to center the voices of the enslaved while making visible the analytical challenges posed by slavery's archive (p. 31). To do this, Barragan is inspired by the methodological labor of scholars like Marisa Fuentes, Saidiya Hartman, and Stephanie Camp. In every chapter, Barragan weaves the stories of African descended men, women, and children from the Chocó into a larger historical narrative with utmost respect and imagination. Through this historical ethnographic approach, readers are compelled to engage with African-descended people's struggles for freedom while facing the frustrations generated by incomplete or silent archives.\n\nBarragan is good at guiding the reader through those silences by engaging other sources, raising questions, and using informed speculation when necessary. For instance, in chapters 1 and 2, she examines foreigners' travelogues when reconstructing the everyday life of bogas (black rowers) and mazamorreros (free black gold prospectors) in the Pacific lowlands. She mines their detailed descriptions of natural landscapes and social relations in order to complicate highly violent and gendered perspectives about African-descended people while pointing at alternative scenarios. Beyond this, her analysis also unveils how foreigners wrote about Colombia's new laws for international audiences and the diplomatic exchanges that emerged concerning abolition. In chapter 3, Barragan discusses the intricate legislative construction of the law in Colombia and compares it to the versions ratified in Argentina, Paraguay, and Peru. This comparative perspective provides helpful insights to understand how they differed from one another, despite having the same end goal, on issues like breastfeeding and designated age for sale. Differences among these laws point to the priorities of lawmakers at the time. In the case of Colombia, Barragan's close examination of periodicals from the period helps her reconstruct intellectual, legal, and economic discourses in defense or against the Free Womb law. The passionate letters and rebuttals published by these newspapers examined carefully by Barraganreveal the deep economic anxieties felt by a segment of the slaveholding class as well as the rivalries that existed between family clans with different perspectives on slavery.\n\nBarragan's meticulous approach to civil and notarial records shines through specifically in chapters 4 and 5, where readers are introduced to several episodes involving Free Womb captives and their families. Readers learn that the Catholic Church played a crucial role in the public dissemination of the law by displaying details on its doors. Aware of the legal possibilities to secure freedom for their children, enslaved parents often mobilized their limited resources to obtain important documents like birth certificates, to claim the right to motherhood, or to initiate lawsuits against slaveholders who sold or traded children who were \"free by the law\" (pp. 175-76). On this last point, Barragan's discussion reveals how slaveholders engaged in the trafficking of Free Womb captives through their inclusion in wills, dowries, inventories, and notes of sale. Furthermore, Barragan argues that slaveholders' management of Free Womb captives as \"assets\" is a reflection of developing modern capitalist practices that intensified in the 1840s and that, as discussed in chapter 6, might have motivated them to privatize land and forests in attempts to contain the physical and economic mobility of Afro-Colombians.\n\nThe book contains a careful selection of images, primary sources from endangered archives, and original maps that illustrate arguments and offer an excellent example to undergraduate and graduate students about the historian's craft. The author's creative use of sources appears, for instance, in chapter 2 where Barragan used an inventory list to create a map that displays house values on three main streets in the city of Quibdó. The map provides a striking image of the city's urban and social organization while visually revealing how property with greater value almost always stood along the riverbank. Additionally, the author's elegant writing style and ability to interconnect every chapter deliver a great reading experience. This means that it is worth assigning the book rather than individual chapters since the scaffolding that appears through the narrative could confuse or distract single-chapter readers. Overall, this book excels at placing the Chocó at the center of discussions on abolition in the Atlantic world while positioning Barragan as an innovative voice in the study of Colombian history today.\n\n[Citation: Angela Pérez-Villa.

London: Hurst and Co., 2020. 301 pp. (Cloth). ISBN-13: 978-1-5416-1967-8.\n\nH-Net Book Review, published by H-Africa, https://networks.h-net.org/h-africa (Sept. 2022).\n\nReviewed for H-Africa by Andrew E. Barnes (Arizona State University).\n\nThe twenty-first century has seen a growing recognition by scholars of the falsity of the nineteenth-century European notion that European societies had evolved in social and biological isolation from other old-world populations and hence the viability of ideas about \"pure races\" as the starting point for construction of arguments about nationalism. The two books under discussion in this review take the search for a historical understanding to replace the old notions of Europe's racial past in opposing directions. Olivette Otele's African Europeans: An Untold Story makes a case first that peoples of African descent have been a discernible racial minority in Europe since the era of the Roman empire, and second, that since Roman times,as a racial minority, peoples of African descent have suffered from forms of discrimination and oppression that continue to be repeated in the present. Otele sees the George Floyd tragedy not as just an incident in the racial history of the United States, but as reflective of a historical pattern of interaction between peoples of African and peoples of European descent. The point of her survey of race relations past and present inEurope is to provide those sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter movement with the historical knowledge they need for their struggle. Richard C. Maguire's Africans in East Anglia builds an argument for race as a designation for people of African descent in England as a bourgeois construct developed and promoted across England most systematically by participants in the Atlantic slave trade and Atlantic colonial plantation economies. Maguire situates his study in the tradition of British Marxist labor history and seeks to show the ongoing utility of E. P. Thompson's classic The Making of the English Working Class (1963) for comprehending English social history. In the western regions of England, centered around the town of Norwich, Maguire find that individuals recognizable as Africans appear in the archival record on a progressively more regular basis starting at the end of the fifteenth century. Yet, other than notations of phenotypic appearance, the archival records show no evidence of Africans as distinct or different from other immigrant peoples entering the region. Rather, and this is Maguire's point, peoples of African descent are recognized in the archival record as members of the English working class, with lives conforming to working-class norms of work and lifestyle. African peoples start being noted as racially distinct only at the end of the seventeenth century, when participants in the Atlantic economy begin to settle in the region and have some impact on regional culture and society. It is from that point forward that notions of race begin to trump notions of class. Still, through the start of the nineteenth century, the cutoff point for Maguire's study, the patterns of discrimination and oppression talked about by Otele are not a discernible feature of race relations in the region.\n\nIn different ways and for different reasons, methodology would be an issue raised about both studies by some historians. Otele's study is surprisingly Eurocentric in its one-to-one equation of European history with world civilization. To be fair, Otele's study is more concerned with the present than the past and she shows a fair amount of due diligence in scouring the European past for illustration of her thesis. The best chapter and primary reward for reading the book is the last chapter, where she offers a wide-ranging survey of race and gender in contemporary Europe from the perspective of identity politics. In the 1990s, the writings of John and Jean Comaroff questioned the value of using archival materials as a mirror of social and cultural realities. Though they are not mentioned, Maguire's monograph is a remarkable rebuttal to their argument. Meticulously, Maguire combed the state and church archives for the East Anglia region to discover every citation of individuals of African descent. To the extent to which records reveal racism, he makes a plausible argument that racism was a trapping of the rise of the bourgeoisie. Unfortunately, that is not the main argument he is trying to make. He wants to affirm that peoples of African descent living in East Anglia absorbed working-class consciousness. His argument here is completely constructed from silence. Strikingly, in a twenty-first-century historical study dedicated to the discussion of Afro-English consciousness, he doesnot quote or communicate the thinking of a single East Anglian of African descent. Maybe peoples of African descent shared the values and sensibilities of their non-African neighbors; maybe after generations of intermarriage they lost all awareness of their distant African ancestors, but Maguire offers no evidence to prove either conclusion.\n\nAgain, in differing ways, both of these works suggest that what W. E. B. Du Bois famously labeled \"the problem of the color line\" persists into the twentieth-first century. Neither work finds a way to fit theEuropeans who resulted from unions between peoples of African and European descent cleanly into its argument. Otele's book takes identity politics as its starting point. The only way it can fit these individuals into its argument is by postulating that they have a \"dual heritage,\" leaving unexplained just what the term means and how it should be understood to have operated as a historical phenomenon. Maguire insists that the term \"mulatto\" had no regional parlance until retired West Indian plantation owners introduced it into the archival record, raising the question of just how the phenotypic legacies of African ancestry were (or were not) acknowledged by locals before the eighteenth century. An interesting question prompted by Maguire's research in fact is whether \"mulatto\" was used in eighteenth-century East Anglia in much the same way that the term \"mestizo\" was used in eighteenth-century Mexico, to signal a form of creolization that involved both phenotypical as well as cultural amalgamation. Both Otele's work and Maguire's work represent a movement away from a conceptualization of Europe's racial past held in thrall to the needs of European nationalists. Both, though, struggle to make the new historical understanding confirm arguments about race and class from the last century.\n\n[Citation: Andrew E. Barnes.

Basquiat catapulted to fame when the contemporary art establishment embraced his street graffiti work, finding it raw, vibrant, and revolutionary. Part of a street movement that encompassed rap and punk, his art became an embodiment of hip hop. He appropriated poetry, found articles, painting, folkloric masks, and drawing into his graffiti murals and paintings. His meteoric rise was cut short at the age of 27 when he died of a heroin overdose.\"\n\n\"Rebellious by nature, he tested the limits of his teachers, friends, and family, eventually dropping out of school, an action that prompted his father to kick him out of the house. He crashed with friends and continued his street art with his graffiti partner and school friend Al Diaz.\"\n\n\"He was soon discovered by important gallerists in Manhattan and was represented by major dealers by the time he was 20. It was his international dealer, Bruno Bischofberger, who introduced him to Warhol. By 1983, at the age of 22 he became the youngest artist to show at the Whitney Museum's Biennial.\"\n\n\"In 1986, Bischofberger organized his trip to the Ivory Coast for an exhibition of his work at the French Cultural Institute in Abidjan. Although the show received only mixed reviews from its perplexed audience who considered the work shocking, his art resonated in a particularly strong manner with local African artists, most of whom had been rejected by the establishment of their community. One group of artists called the Vouvou, a derogatory expression used to imply worthless junk, was very taken by his work because it so closely mirrored their own. Poor, and without the means to purchase paints and canvases, they improvised with what they found in their villages working with cardboard, copper, animal skins, bark, and feathers. Their subject matter, much of which is seen in Basquiat's work, reflected skulls, death, fear, and their black skin. Neither the Vouvou nor Basquiat had had any previous encounter; the similarities are striking. Although Basquiat had never been to Africa, he had what he explained was a cultural memory. As he said, 'I don't have to look for it. It exists. It's there in Africa. Our cultural memory follows us everywhere.'\"\n\n[Read this full article online. >>> Watch a discussion with film Director Cyril Bérard and Producer Rachel Kahn, moderated by Franklin Sirmans, Director of Pérez Art Museum Miami and an expert on Basquiat's works >>>].\n\n[Return to table of contents]\n\n©2022 African Diaspora Archaeology Network\n\nCopyright and all rights reserved by\n\nindividual authors for each article.\n\nPlease send comments, suggestions,\n\nor questions to the editors\n\nLast updated: December 18, 2022\n\nText only menu\n\nSearch"
