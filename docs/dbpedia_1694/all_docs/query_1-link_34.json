        "text": "DARTMOUTH -- Author Katherine Vaz says it is impossible to be a writer and not love the Azores for its people and their stories.\n\n\"There is an automatic magic we don't think of on a day-to-day basis,\" she said yesterday in an interview with The Standard-Times. \"It is a sensibility that permeates everything.\"\n\nMrs. Vaz, the author of the critically acclaimed novel \"Saudade,\" says the book may be made into a movie soon. The rights have been purchased recently by actress Marlee Maitlin.\n\n\"It is still in the early stages and they are in the process of finding a screenwriter at the moment,\" she said.\n\nMrs. Vaz, an assistant professor at University of California at Davis, will speak today at Umass Dartmouth as part of a day-long conference on the Portuguese-American experience.\n\nA second-generation Azorean, Mrs. Vaz is working on a second novel that revolves around a mainland Portuguese nun who fell in love with a French mercenary during the Portuguese revolution from Spain in the 17th century.\n\nWhile the nun gained enormous fame for her work in Portugal, she was thought of as a product of French fiction writers outside the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe book, titled \"Mariana,\" will be out in the spring in Europe and will be released later in the United States. It is being translated into six languages.\n\n\"'Mariana' is based on the real story of a Sister Mariana Alcoforado of Beja, Portugal,\" Mrs. Vaz said. \"She wrote five famous love letters to a French cavalry cfficer whom she fell in love with. He spread the letters around in salons in France and they were later published there.\"\n\nMrs. Vaz said that unlike her first novel, which took place in the Azores, this book is based on a true story and she had to interview family members and search through historical documents in order to write it.\n\n\"The letters ended up being best sellers in France right away,\" said Mrs. Vaz. \"She is very well known in Portugal but she is not known here. People in the academic community in the United States think she was created by the French.\"\n\n\"She was really a remarkable woman,\" Mrs. Vaz, 41, continued. \"What interested me was the very passionate affair she had and how she continued in her work. She was considered a brilliant accountant and had to raise a birth sister all by herself.\n\n\"She even persuaded a duke out of his property on behalf of the convent,\" she said. \"There were so many things I found to like about her and her family. I thought I was just going to do a new translation of the letters, but it turned into a family saga.\"\n\nA California native who is half Irish, Ms. Vaz said that she was always influenced by the Portuguese around her in California.\n\n\"The joke is that I get great material from my father's side of the family and the love of being a story teller from my mother's,\" she said laughing. \"The stories that fascinated me the most were the ones that came to me from my Azorean relatives. They seemed to have a consciousness that is very beautiful.\"\n\nThe UMass conference is sponsored by the Luso-American Development Foundation, the Portuguese-American Leadership Council of the United States and the Center for Portuguese Studies. The event will delve into the demographics, socialization and politics surrounding the Portuguese migration to the United States.\n\nAlso scheduled to appear and perform will be Nuno Bettencourt, the guitarist for the now defunct rock band, the Extreme.\n\nAmong the speakers for the event, which kicks off at 8 a.m., will be the director of Brown University's Portuguese and Brazilian Studies Program, Onesimo Almeida.\n\nMr. Almeida will appear along with fellow Brown Professor and author George Monteiro.\n\nDonald Warren of California State University will be hosting a picture show from the Old West depicting Portuguese sheep herders, miners and other expansion-oriented trades in early America.\n\nThe event will have several moderators, including Dr. Mary Vermette and Judge Phillip Rivard Raposa, justice for the Massachusetts Superior Court.\n\nThere also will be a special political roundtable featuring Rep. Richard Pombo of California, state Rep. Antonio F.D. Cabral of New Bedford and Sen. Paul Tavares of Rhode Island.\n\nOther speakers for the day include\n\nPeter H. Cressy, chancellor of UMass Dartmouth\n\nMary Parente Borba, president of the Portuguese-American Leadership Council.\n\nJerry Williams of California State University, Chico, who will speak on \"A model for teaching about International Migration and Ethnic Interaction.\n\nJoseph Machado of the Portuguese Historical Museum of California, who will discuss \"The California Portuguese Immigrant Community in the Year 2000.\"\n\nJournalist Pedro Bicudo of RTPi who will speak on \"The Portuguese-American as an Ethnic Audience.\"\n\nRita Marinho of UMass-Dartmouth, whose subject is \"The political Assimilation of the Portuguese a current appraisal.\"\n\nDulce Maria Scott of Butler University who will speak about \"Portuguese-American Business People from California, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey.\"\n\nThe event will take place in Room 153 of Group VI building. Parking is in lots 8 and 9."
