        "text": "Ethnic group native to Portugal\n\nFor a specific analysis of the population of Portugal, see Demographics of Portugal.\n\nEthnic group\n\nThe Portuguese people (Portuguese: Portugueses – masculine – or Portuguesas) are a Romance-speaking ethnic group and nation indigenous to Portugal, a country in the west of the Iberian Peninsula in the south-west of Europe, who share a common culture, ancestry and language.[92][93][94]\n\nThe political origin of the Portuguese state can be traced back to the founding of the County of Portugal in 868. However, it was not until the Battle of São Mamede (1128) that Portugal gained international recognition as a kingdom through the Treaty of Zamora and the papal bull Manifestis Probatum. This establishment of the Portuguese state in the 12th century paved the way for the Portuguese people to unite as a nation.[95][96][97]\n\nThe Portuguese played an important role in sailing, and explored several distant lands previously unknown to Europeans in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania (southwest Pacific Ocean). In 1415, with the conquest of Ceuta, the Portuguese began to play a significant role in the Age of Discovery, which culminated in a colonial empire, considered as one of the first global empires and one of the world's major economic, political and military powers in the 15th and 16th centuries, with territories that are now part of numerous countries.[98][99][100] Portugal helped to the subsequent domination of Western civilization by other neighboring European nations.[101][102][103][100]\n\nDue to the large historical extent from the 16th century of the Portuguese Empire and the subsequent colonization of territories in Asia, Africa and the Americas, as well as historical and recent emigration, Portuguese dispersed to different parts of the world.[104]\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Portuguese people's heritage largely derives from the Indo-European (Lusitanians, Conii)[105][106][107] and Celtic peoples (Gallaecians, Turduli and Celtici),[108][109][110] who were later Romanized after the conquest of the region by the ancient Romans.[111][112][113] As a result of Roman colonization, the Portuguese language – the native language of the overwhelming majority of Portuguese people – stems from Vulgar Latin.[114]\n\nA number of male lineages descend from Germanic tribes who arrived as ruling elites after the Roman period, starting in 409.[115] These included the Suebi, Buri, Hasdingi Vandals and Visigoths. The pastoral North Caucasus' Alans left small traces in a few central-southern areas (e.g. Alenquer, from \"Alen Kerke\" or \"Temple of the Alans\").[116][117][118][119]\n\nThe Umayyad conquest of Iberia, between the early 8th century until the 12th century, also left small Moorish, Jewish and Saqaliba genetic contributions in the country.[120][121][111][112][122] Other minor – as well as later – influences include small Viking settlements between the 9th and 11th centuries, made by Norsemen who raided coastal areas mainly in the northern regions of Douro and Minho.[123][124][125][126] There is also low-incidence, pre-Roman influence from ancient Phoenicians and Greeks in southern coastal areas.[127]\n\nName\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name Portugal, from which the Portuguese take their name, is a compound name that comes from the Latin word Portus (meaning port) and a second word Cale, whose meaning and origin are unclear. Cale is probably a reminder of the Gallaeci (also known as Callaeci), a Celtic tribe that lived in the area today part of Northern Portugal.\n\nThere is also the possibility that the name comes from the early settlement of Cale (today's Gaia), situated on the mouth of the Douro River on the Atlantic coast (Portus Cale). The name Cale seems to come from the Celts – perhaps from one of their specifications, Cailleach – but which, in everyday life, was synonymous with shelter, anchorage or door.[128] Among other theories, some suggest that Cale may stem from the Greek word for \"beautiful\" kalós. Another theory for Portugal postulates a French derivation, Portus Gallus[129] \"port of the Gauls\".\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the area around Cale became known through the Visigoths as Portucale. Portucale could have evolved in the 7th and 8th centuries, to become Portugale, or Portugal, from the 9th century. The term denoted the area between the Douro and Minho rivers.[130]\n\nEarly inhabitants\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Genetic history of Europe\n\nThe early populations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Portuguese are a Southwestern European population, with origins predominantly from Southern and Western Europe. The earliest modern humans inhabiting Portugal are believed to have been Paleolithic peoples that may have arrived in the Iberian Peninsula as early as 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. Current interpretation of Y-chromosome and mtDNA data suggests that modern-day Portuguese trace a proportion of these lineages to the paleolithic peoples who began settling the European continent between the end of the last glaciation around 45,000 years ago.\n\nNorthern Iberia is believed to have been a major Ice age refuge from which Paleolithic humans later colonized Europe. Migrations from what is now northern Iberia during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic link modern Iberians to the populations of much of Western Europe, and particularly the British Isles and Atlantic Europe.[131]\n\nY-chromosome haplogroup R1b is the most common haplogroup in practically all of the Iberian peninsula and western Europe.[132] Within the R1b haplogroup there are modal haplotypes. One of the best-characterized of these haplotypes is the Atlantic Modal Haplotype (AMH). This haplotype reaches the highest frequencies in the Iberian Peninsula and in the British Isles. In Portugal it reckons generally 65% in the South summing 87% northwards, and in some regions 96%.[133]\n\nThe Neolithic\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Early European Farmers\n\nThe Neolithic colonization of Europe from Western Asia and the Middle East, beginning around 10,000 years ago, reached Iberia as well as it had previously reached the rest of the continent, although according to the demic diffusion model its impact was greatest in the southern and eastern regions of the European continent.[134]\n\nThe Celts and the arrival of the Indo-Europeans\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting in the 3rd millennium BC, during the Bronze Age, the first wave of migrations by speakers of Indo-European languages into Iberia occurred. Major genetic studies, carried out since 2015, have now shown that the expansion of haplogroup R1b in Western Europe, most common in many areas of Atlantic Europe, is primarily due to massive migrations from the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Eastern Europe during the Bronze Age, along with carriers of Indo-European languages like proto-Celtic and proto-Italic. Unlike older studies on uniparental markers, large amounts of autosomal DNA were analyzed in addition to paternal Y-DNA. An autosomal component was detected in modern Europeans which was not present in the Neolithic or Mesolithic, and which entered into Europe with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as the Indo-European languages.[135][136][137]\n\nThe first immigrations of Indo-European languages speakers were later followed by waves of Celts. The Celts arrived in the territory that is today Portugal about 3,000 years ago[138] even though the migration phenomenon was particularly intense from the 7th to the 5th centuries BC.[139][140]\n\nThese two processes defined Iberia's, and Portugal's, cultural landscape \"Continental in the northwest and Mediterranean towards the southeast\", as historian José Mattoso describes it.[141]\n\nThe northwest–southeast cultural shift also shows in genetic differences: based on 2016 findings,[142] haplogroup H, a cluster that is nested within the haplogroup R category, is more prevalent along the Atlantic façade, including the Cantabrian Coast and Portugal. It displays the highest frequency in Galicia (northwestern corner of Iberia). The frequency of haplogroup H shows a decreasing trend from the Atlantic façade toward the Mediterranean regions.\n\nThis finding adds strong evidence where Galicia and Northern Portugal was found to be a cul-de-sac population, a kind of European edge for a major ancient central European migration. Therefore, there is an interesting pattern of genetic continuity existing along the Cantabria coast and Portugal, a pattern that has been observed previously when minor sub-clades of the mtDNA phylogeny were examined.[143]\n\nGiven the origins from Paleolithic and Neolithic settlers, as well as Bronze Age and Iron Age Indo-European migrations, one can say that the Portuguese ethnic origin is mainly a mixture of pre-Celts or para-Celts, such as the Lusitanians[144] of Lusitania, and Celtic peoples such as Gallaeci of Gallaecia, the Celtici[145] and the Cynetes[146] of Alentejo and the Algarve.\n\nPre-Roman populations\n\n[edit]\n\nLusitanians\n\n[edit]\n\nNot to be confused with Lusatia.\n\nThe Lusitanians (or Lusitānus – singular – Lusitani – plural – in Latin) were an Indo-European speaking people living in the Western Iberian Peninsula long before it became the Roman province of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of Salamanca). They spoke the Lusitanian language, of which only a few short written fragments survive. Most Portuguese consider the Lusitanians as their ancestors, although the northern regions (Minho, Douro, Trás-os-Montes) identify more with the Gallaecians. Prominent modern linguists such as Ellis Evans believe that Gallaecian-Lusitanian was one language (thus not separate languages) of the \"p\" Celtic variant.[147][148] They were a large tribe that lived between the rivers Douro and Tagus.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that the Lusitanians may have originated in the Alps and settled in the region in the 6th century BC. Some modern scholars like Dáithí Ó hÓgáin consider them to be indigenous[149] of the country. He also claims they were initially dominated by the Celts, before gaining full independence from them. The Romanian archaeologist Scarlat Lambrino [ro], active in Portugal for many years, proposed that they were originally a tribal Celtic group, related to the Lusones.[150]\n\nThe first area settled by the Lusitanians was probably the Douro Valley and the region of Beira Alta; they subsequently moved south, and expanded on both sides of the Tagus river, before being conquered by the Romans.\n\nThe Lusitanian ethnogenesis and, in particular, their language, is still not completely understood. They originated from either Proto-Celtic or Proto-Italic populations who spread from Central Europe into western Europe after new Yamnaya migrations into the Danube Valley, while Proto-Germanic and Proto-Balto-Slavic may have developed east of the Carpathian Mountains, in present-day Ukraine, moving north and spreading with the Corded Ware culture in Middle Europe (third millennium BCE). One theory postulates that a European branch of Indo-European dialects, termed \"North-west Indo-European\" and associated with the Bell Beaker culture, may have been ancestral to not only Celtic and Italic, but also to Germanic and Balto-Slavic.[151]\n\nThe Celtic root of the Lusitanians and their language, is further emphasized by recent research by the Max Planck Institute on the origins of Indo-European languages. This comprehensive genetic-linguistic study, identifies one common Celtic branch of peoples and languages spanning most of Atlantic Europe, including Lusitania, at around 7,000 BC. This new work contradicts previous theories which excluded Lusitanian from the Celtic linguistic family.[152]\n\nIn Roman times, the original Roman province of Lusitania was extended north of the areas occupied by the Lusitanians to include the territories of Asturias and Gallaecia but these were soon ceded to the jurisdiction of the Provincia Tarraconensis in the north, while the south remained the Provincia Lusitania et Vettones. After this, Lusitania's northern border was along the Douro river, while its eastern border passed through Salmantica and Caesarobriga to the Anas (Guadiana) river.\n\nOther Pre-Roman groups (excluding Lusitanians)\n\n[edit]\n\nAs the Lusitanians fought fiercely against the Romans for independence, the name Lusitania was adopted by the Gallaeci, tribes living north of the Douro, and other closely surrounding tribes, eventually spreading as a label to all the nearby peoples fighting Roman rule in the west of Iberia. It was for this reason that the Romans came to name their original province in the area, that initially covered the entire western side of the Iberian peninsula, Lusitania.\n\nHere is a list of the tribes, often known by their Latin names, who were living in the area of modern Portugal prior to Roman rule:\n\nBardili (Turduli) – living in the Setúbal peninsula;\n\nBracari – living between the rivers Tâmega and Cávado, in the area of the modern city of Braga;\n\nCallaici – living along and north of the Douro;\n\nCeltici – Celts living in Alentejo;\n\nCoelerni – living in the mountains between the rivers Tua and Sabor;\n\nCynetes or Conii – living in the Algarve and the south of Alentejo;\n\nEquaesi – living in the most mountainous region of modern Portugal;\n\nGrovii – a mysterious tribe living in the Minho valley;\n\nInteramici – living in Trás-os-Montes and in the border areas with Galicia and León (in modern Spain);\n\nLeuni – living between the rivers Lima and Minho;\n\nLuanqui – living between the rivers Tâmega and Tua;\n\nLimici – living in the swamps of the river Lima, on the border between Portugal and Galicia;\n\nNarbasi – living in the north of modern Portugal (interior) and nearby area of southern Galicia;\n\nNemetati – living north of the Douro Valley in the area of Mondim;\n\nOestriminis also referred to as Sefes and supposedly linked to the Cempsii [pt].[153] There is not a consensus regarding their exact origins and location. They are believed to have been the first known humans to inhabit the whole Atlantic margin covering Portugal and Galicia, the people from ‘Finis terrae’ at the end of the Western world.[154][155]\n\nPaesuri – a dependent tribe of the Lusitanians, living between the rivers Douro and Vouga;\n\nQuaquerni – living in the mountains at the mouths of rivers Cávado and Tâmega;\n\nSeurbi – living between the rivers Cávado and Lima (or even reaching the river Minho);\n\nTamagani – from the area of Chaves, near the river Tâmega;\n\nTapoli – another dependent tribe of the Lusitanians, living north of the river Tagus, on the border between modern Portugal and Spain;\n\nTurdetani – In southern municipalities such as São Brás de Alportel\n\nTurduli – in the east of Alentejo (Guadiana Valley);\n\nTurduli Veteres – literally \"ancient Turduli\", living south of the estuary of the river Douro;\n\nTurdulorum Oppida – Turduli living in the Portuguese region of Estremadura and Beira Litoral;\n\nTurodi – living in Trás-os-Montes and bordering areas of Galicia;\n\nVettones – living in the eastern border areas of Portugal, and in Spanish provinces of Ávila and Salamanca, as well as parts of Zamora, Toledo and Cáceres;\n\nZoelae – living in the mountains of Serra da Nogueira [pt], Sanabria and Culebra, up to the mountains of Mogadouro in northern Portugal and adjacent areas of Galicia.\n\nRomanization\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Lusitanian War\n\nThe Roman Republic conquered the Iberian Peninsula during the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C. from the vast maritime empire of Carthage during the Punic Wars.\n\nSince 193 B.C., the Lusitanians had been fighting Rome and its expansion into the peninsula following the defeat and occupation of Carthage in North Africa. They defended themselves bravely for years, causing the Roman invaders serious defeats although, in the end they were severely punished by Praetor Servius Galba in 150 B.C. Springing a clever trap, he killed 9,000 Lusitanians and later sold 20,000 more as slaves further northeast in the newly conquered Roman provinces in Gaul (modern France).\n\nThree years later (147 B.C.), Viriathus became the leader of the Lusitanians and severely damaged the Roman rule in Lusitania and beyond. He commanded a confederation of Celtic tribes[157] and prevented the Roman expansion through guerrilla warfare. In 139 B.C. Viriathus was betrayed and killed in his sleep by his companions (who had been sent as emissaries to the Romans), Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus, bribed by Marcus Popillius Laenas. However, when Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus returned to receive their reward by the Romans, the Consul Quintus Servilius Caepio ordered their execution, declaring that \"Rome does not pay traitors\".\n\nViriathus[159] is the first ‘national hero’ and he has, for the Portuguese, the same significance that Vercingetorix[160] has for the French or Boudicca[161] enjoys among the English. After Viriathus' rule, the celticized Lusitanians became largely romanized, adopting Roman culture and the Latin language.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Lusitanian cities, in a manner similar to those of the rest of the Roman-Iberian peninsula, eventually gained the status of \"Citizens of Rome\". During the last centuries of the Roman colonization many saints venerated by the Catholic church emerged from the territory of modern-day Portugal. These include Saint Engrácia, Saint Quitéria and Saint Marina of Aguas Santas among others.\n\nThe Romans also left a major impact on the population, both genetically and in Portuguese culture; the Portuguese language derives mostly from Latin, given that the language itself is mostly a local later evolution of the Roman language after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.[111][112] According to Mario Pei, the phonetic distance found nowadays between Portuguese and Latin stands at 31%.[162][163] The Roman domination lasted from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD.\n\nMiddle Ages\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the Romans, Germanic peoples, namely the Suebi, (see Suebi Kingdom) the Buri, and the Visigoths (who are estimated to have formed 2–3% of the population),[165][166][167][168] ruled the peninsula as elites for several centuries and assimilated into the local populations. Some of the Vandals (Silingi and Hasdingi) and Alans[169] also remained. The Suebians of northern and central Portugal and of Galicia were the most numerous of the Germanic tribes. Portugal and Galicia, (along with Catalonia which was part of the Frankish Kingdom), are the regions with the highest ratios today of Germanic Y-DNA in the Iberian peninsula.[citation needed]\n\nOther minor – as well as later – influences include small Viking settlements between the 9th and 11th centuries, made by Norsemen who raided coastal areas mainly in the northern regions of Douro and Minho.[170][124][171][126]\n\nThe Moors occupied what is now Portugal from the 8th century until the Reconquista movement expelled them from the Algarve in 1249. Some of their population, mainly Berbers and Jews converted to Christianity and became New Christians (Cristãos novos); some descendants of these people are still identifiable by their new surnames.[172] Several genetic studies, including the most comprehensive genome-wide studies published on historical and modern populations of the Iberian Peninsula, conclude that the Moorish occupation left little to no Jewish, Arab and Berber genetic influence throughout most of Iberia, with higher incidence in the south and west, and lower incidence in the northeast; almost nonexistent in the Basque Country.[173][174][111][112]\n\nFollowing the end of the Reconquista and the Conquest of Faro, religious and ethnic minorities such as the so-called \"new Christians\" or the \"Ciganos\" (Roma gypsies)[175] would later suffer persecution from the state and the Holy Inquisition. As a consequence, many were expelled and condemned under the Auto-da-fé[176] sentencing or fled the country, creating a Jewish diaspora in the Netherlands,[177] England, modern-day US,[178] Brazil,[179] The Balkans[180] as well as other parts of the world.\n\nThe emergence of the Portuguese Nation (868 AD onwards)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe political origin of the Portuguese state is in the founding of County of Portugal in 868 (Portuguese: Condado Portucalense; in documents of the period the name used was Portugalia[181]). It was the first time in its history that a cohesive nationalism emerged, as even during the Roman Era, the indigenous populations were from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.\n\nAlthough the country was established as a county in 868, it was only after the Battle of São Mamede on 24 June 1128 that Portugal was officially recognised as a kingdom in virtue of the Treaty of Zamora and the papal bull Manifestis Probatum of Pope Alexander III. The establishment of the Portuguese state in the 12th century paved the way for the Portuguese to group together as a nation.[95][96][97]\n\nA subsequent turning point in Portuguese nationalism was the Battle of Aljubarrota in 1385, linked to the figure of Brites de Almeida putting an end to any Castilian ambitions to take over the Portuguese throne.\n\nGenetic comparisons\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Portuguese share a degree of ethnic characteristics with the Basques,[182] since ancient times. The results of the present HLA study in Portuguese populations show that they have features in common with Basques and some Spaniards from Madrid: a high frequency of the HLA-haplotypes A29-B44-DR7 (ancient Western Europeans) and A1-B8-DR3 are found as common characteristics. Many Portuguese and Basques do not show the Mediterranean A33-B14-DR1 haplotype, confirming a lower admixture with Mediterraneans.[143]\n\nThe Portuguese have a unique characteristic among world populations: a high frequency of HLA-A25-B18-DR15 and A26-B38-DR13, which may reflect a still detectable founder effect coming from ancient Portuguese, i.e., Oestriminis and Cynetes.[183] According to an early genetic study, the Portuguese are a relatively distinct population according to HLA data, as they have a high frequency of the HLA-A25-B18-DR15 and A26-B38-DR13 genes, the latter being a unique Portuguese marker. In Europe, the A25-B18-DR15 gene is only found in Portugal, and it is also observed in white North Americans and in Brazilians (very likely of Portuguese ancestry).[184]\n\nThe pan-European haplotype A1-B8-DR3 and the western-European haplotype A29-B44-DR7 are shared by Portuguese, Basques and Spaniards. The latter is also common in Irish, southern English, and western French populations.[184]\n\nAccording to a genetic study of the human Y-chromosome haplogroup among the Portuguese conducted in 2005, men from mainland Portugal, the Azores and Madeira belonged to 78–83% of the \"Western European\" haplogroup R1b, and Mediterranean J and E3b.[185]\n\nThe comparative table shows statistics by haplogroups of Portuguese men with men of European countries, and communities.\n\nCountry/Haplogroup I1 I2*/I2a I2b R1a R1b G J2 J*/J1 E1b1b T Q N Portugal 2 1.5 3 1.5 56 6.5 9.5 3 14 2.5 0.5 0 France 8.5 3 3.5 3 58.5 5.5 6 1.5 7.5 1 0.5 0 United Kingdom 8 1 4.5 0.5 80 2 2.5 0.5 0.5 0 0 0 Germany 16 1.5 4.5 16 44.5 5 4.5 0 5.5 1 0.5 1 Ireland 6 1 5 2.5 81 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 Italy 4.5 3 2.5 4 39 9 15.5 3 13.5 2.5 0 0 Spain 1.5 4.5 1 2 69 3 8 1.5 7 2.5 0 0 Ukraine 4.5 20.5 0.5 44 8 3 4.5 0.5 6.5 1 0.5 5.5 Ashkenazi Jews 4 10 9 9.5 19 19 20.5 2 0.5 5 0 1.5 Sephardi Jews 1 5 13 15 25 22 9 6 0 2 0 2\n\nCulturally and linguistically, the Portuguese are close to the Galicians who live in northwestern Spain.[186][187][188][189] The similarities among the two groups are very pronounced and some people claim that Galician and Portuguese are, in fact, the same language (see also: Reintegrationism).[190][191]\n\nDemography\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics of Portugal\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Demographics of Portugal\n\nThere are around 9.15 million Portuguese-born people in Portugal,[192] out of a total population of 10.467 million[193] (87.4%).\n\nConcerning citizenship, there are about 782,000 foreigners legally living in the country (7.47%), thus approximately 9.685 million people living in Portugal hold Portuguese citizenship or legal residency.[194]\n\nAgeing is a major issue in Portugal as the median age stands at 46.8 years (while in the EU as a whole it is 44.4 years)[195] and people aged 65 or more now account for 23.4% of the total population.[196] This is due to a low total fertility rate (1.35 against the EU average of 1.53)[196] as well as to a very high life expectancy at birth (82.65).[197] Due to the high percentage of senior citizens, the crude mortality rate (12%)[198] exceeds the crude birth rate (7.6%).[199]\n\nWith respect to the infant mortality rate, Portugal boasts one of the lowest in the world (2.6%), attesting to a significant improvement in living conditions since 1961, when 8.9% of newborns would die.[200] The average age of women at first childbirth stands at 29.9 years, in contrast to the EU average of 28.2.[201]\n\nAbout 66.85% of the population lives in urban settings, with the population being unevenly distributed and concentrated along the coast and in the Lisbon metropolitan area, where 2,883,645, or 27.67% of the population, live.[202][203]\n\nAbout 64.88% of the national population, or 6,760,989 people, live in the 56 municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, about 18.2% of all national municipalities. On the other hand, there are 122 municipalities, about 39.6% of all national municipalities, with a population of 10,000 inhabitants or less, totaling 678,855 inhabitants, about 6.51% of the national population.\n\nNative minority languages in Portugal\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Languages of Portugal\n\nThe main language spoken as first language by the overwhelming majority of the population is Portuguese.[204] Other autochthonous languages spoken include:\n\nCaló (see also Caló language), the language of the Portuguese-Romani community. There are about 52,000 Romani people in Portugal.[205]\n\nMirandês (see also Mirandese language), officially recognised as an official language.[206] It enjoys special protection in the area of Miranda do Douro, Vimioso and Mogadouro. As of today, there are about 15,000 people who speak the language (0.14%).[207][208][209][210] The language is part of the Asturian-Leonese linguistic group which includes the Asturian and Leonese minority languages of Northwestern Spain.[211][212][213][214][215] All of the speakers are bilingual and speak Portuguese as well and code-switching is common.\n\nBarranquenhu (see also Barranquenho), spoken in the town of Barrancos (in the border between Extremadura and Andalusia, in Spain, and Portugal). As of today, there are about 3,000 speakers of the language (0.03%).[216] It is a dialect of Portuguese heavily influenced by Extremaduran and, more recently, southern Spanish.\n\nMinderico – a sociolect or argot spoken in Minde, practically extinct. There are about 150 speakers left[217][218]\n\nPortuguese Sign Language, the official language for the deaf community in Portugal. There are about 30,000 deaf people (0.29%) in Portugal who use the language.[219] Interestingly, the first teacher of deaf-mutes in France was Portuguese-Jew Jacob Rodrigues Pereira.\n\nEthnic minorities in Portugal\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Immigration to Portugal\n\nPeople from the former colonies, particularly Brazil, Portuguese Africa (especially Afro-Portuguese), Macau, Portuguese India and Timor-Leste, have been migrating to Portugal since the 1900s.\n\nA great number of Slavs, especially Ukrainians (now one of the biggest ethnic minorities[220][221]) and Russians, as well as Moldovans, Romanians, Bulgarians and Georgians, have been migrating to Portugal since the late 20th century. A new wave of Ukrainians arrived in Portugal after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and there are now approximately 60,000 Ukrainian refugees in Portugal, making them the second largest migrant community in Portugal, after Brazil's. [222][223]\n\nThere is a Chinese minority of Macau Cantonese origin as well as of Chinese mainlanders.\n\nOther Asian communities relevant in numbers include Indians, Nepalis, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis while, dealing with Latin Americans, Venezuelans – numbering about 27,700 – are particularly present.[224]\n\nIn addition, there is a small minority of Romani – about 52,000 in number.[225][226]\n\nPortugal is also home to other EU and EEA/EFTA nationals (French, Germans, Dutch, Swedes, Spaniards). The UK and France represented the largest senior residents communities in the country as of 2019, they are part of a larger expatriate community including Germans, Dutch, Belgians and Swedes as well.[227]\n\nOfficially registered foreigners accounted to 7.3% of the population,[194] with the tendency to increase further.[228] These include both citizens born in Portugal with foreign citizenship and foreign immigrants. Descendants of immigrants are excluded (Portugal, like many European countries, does not collect data on ethnicity) and those who, regardless of place of birth or citizenship at birth, were Portuguese citizens (see also Portuguese nationality law).\n\nDealing with religious minorities, there are also about 100,000 Muslims[229][230] and an even smaller minority of Jews of about 5,000–6,000 people (the majority are Sephardi such as the Belmonte Jews, while some others are Ashkenazi).[231][232][233][234]\n\nFlag maps of the five most important foreign communities[a] in each Portuguese district as of 01.01.22[235]\n\nFlag map of the most common foreign nationality in Portugal per each district.

The first additional names are usually the mother's family surname(s) and the father's family surname(s). For practicality, usually only the last surname (excluding prepositions) is used in formal greetings.\n\nPortugal has a highly adaptable naming system that complies with the country's legal framework. The law mandates that a child must be given at least one personal name and one surname from either parent. Additionally, there is a limit to the number of names that can be given, which is set at a maximum of two personal names and four surnames.[236]\n\nIn pre-Roman times, the inhabitants of what is now Portugal had either a single name or a name followed by a patronym, which reflected their ethnicity or the tribe/region they belonged to. These names could be Celtic, Lusitanian, Iberian, or Conii. However, the Roman onomastic system began to slowly gain popularity after the first century AD. This system involved adopting a Roman name or the tria nomina, which consisted of a praenomen (given name), nomen (gentile), and cognomen. Today, most Portuguese surnames have a Germanic patronymic (such as Henriques, Pires, Rodrigues, Lopes, Nunes, Mendes, Fernandes etc. where the ending -es means \"son of\"), locative (Gouveia, Guimarães, Lima, Maia, Mascarenhas, Serpa, Montes, Fonseca, Barroso), religious origin (Cruz, Reis, De Jesus, Moysés, Nascimento), occupational (Carpinteiro (carpenter), Malheiro (wool-maker, thresher), Jardineiro (gardener), or derived from physical appearance (Branco (white), Trigueiro (brown, tanned), Louraço (blond). Toponymic, locative, and religion-derived surnames are often preceded by the preposition 'of' in its varying forms: (De, de), (Do, do- masculine), (Da, da- feminine) or 'of the' (dos, Dos, das, Das – plural) such as De Carvalho, Da Silva, de Gouveia, Da Costa, da Maia, do Nascimento, dos Santos, das Mercês. If the preposition is followed by a vowel, sometimes apostrophes are used in surnames (or stage names) such as D'Oliveira, d'Abranches, d'Eça. In some previous Portuguese colonies in Asia (India, Malaysia, East Timor) there are alternative spellings such as 'D'Souza, Desouza, De Cunha, Ferrao, Dessais, Balsemao, Conceicao, Gurjao, Mathias, Thomaz.\n\nBelow there is a list of the most frequent 25 surnames in Portugal; the \"percent frequency\" figures are higher than one might expect because the majority of Portuguese individuals have multiple surnames. To illustrate, if we assume that surname distribution is relatively uniform (at least for those with high frequency), we can infer that roughly 0.5626% (9.44 x 0.0596) of the Portuguese population carries both the surnames Silva and Santos simultaneously.[237][238][239]\n\nRank Surname Percent Frequency Absolute Frequency (in 1,000s) 1 Silva 9.44% 999 2 Santos 5.96% 628 3 Ferreira 5.25% 553 4 Pereira 4.88% 514 5 Oliveira 3.71% 391 6 Costa 3.68% 387 7 Rodrigues 3.57% 376 8 Martins 3.23% 340 9 Jesus 2.99% 315 10 Sousa 2.95% 311 11 Fernandes 2.82% 297 12 Gonçalves 2.76% 291 13 Gomes 2.57% 271 14 Lopes 2.52% 265 15 Marques 2.51% 265 16 Alves 2.37% 250 17 Almeida 2.27% 239 18 Ribeiro 2.27% 239 19 Pinto 2.09% 220 20 Carvalho 1.97% 208 21 Teixeira 1.69% 178 22 Moreira 1.54% 162 23 Correia 1.53% 161 24 Mendes 1.39% 146 25 Nunes 1.32% 139\n\nPortuguese diaspora\n\n[edit]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nPortugal has traditionally been a land of emigration: according to estimates, in the whole world there could easily be more than one hundred million people with recognizable Portuguese ancestors, with Portuguese diasporas found everywhere, in many diverse regions around the globe in all continents. Due to the extent of the phenomenon and lack of sources dealing with statistics dating hundreds of years ago, the total number of people of Portuguese descent is hard to estimate.[240][241][242]\n\nThe extension of the phenomenon is due to explorations carried in the 15th and 16th centuries as well as to the subsequent colonial expansion. Colonization encouraged worldwide emigration of Portuguese from the 15th century onwards to South Asia, the Americas, Macau, East-Timor, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar[243] and Africa, particularly to the former colonies (see Luso-Africans). Portuguese emigration also contributed to the settlement of the Atlantic islands, the population of Brazil (where the majority of the current population is of Portuguese descent) and the formation of communities of partial-Portuguese ethnic-cultural origin – as in Goa Catholic Goans, in Sri Lanka Portuguese Burghers, in Malacca the Kristang and in Macau the Macaense. The Portuguese Empire, which lasted nearly 600 years, ended when Macau was returned to China in 1999. As a consequence, during those 600 years, millions of people left Portugal. As a result of inter-ethnic marriage and cultural influences, dialects based on Portuguese have occurred both in the former colonies (e.g. Forro) and in other countries (e.g. Papiamentu).\n\nIn addition, a considerable segment of the Portuguese communities abroad is due to recent mass emigration phenomena, mainly driven by economic reasons, dating to the 19th and 20th centuries. In fact, between 1886 and 1966 Portugal, after Ireland, was the second Western European country to lose more people to emigration.[244]\n\nFrom the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, nearly two million Portuguese left Europe to live mainly in Brazil and with significant numbers to the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.[245] About 1.2 million Brazilian citizens are native Portuguese.[246] Significant verified Portuguese minorities exist in several countries (see table below).[247]\n\nBy 1989 some 4,000,000 Portuguese citizens were living abroad, mainly in France, Germany, Brazil, South Africa, Canada, Venezuela, and the United States.[248] Estimates from 2021 point that as much as 5 million Portuguese citizens (thus not taking into account descendants or citizens not registered within the Portuguese consular authorities) may be living abroad.[249]\n\nWithin Europe, substantial concentrations of Portuguese may be found in Francophone countries like France, Luxembourg and Switzerland, spurred in part by the linguistic proximity that exists between the Portuguese and the French language. In fact, according to data from the General Directorate of Consular Affairs and Portuguese Communities of the Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the countries with the largest Portuguese communities are, in ascending order of demographic importance, France, the UK and Switzerland.[250]\n\nGenerally speaking, Portuguese diaspora communities often feel a strong bond to the land of their ancestors, their language, their culture and their national dishes such as cod.\n\nPortuguese Sephardi Jews\n\n[edit]\n\nDating back many centuries, descendants of Portuguese Sephardi Jews are found everywhere in the world, with notable communities having settled in significant numbers in Israel, the Netherlands, the United States, France, Venezuela, Brazil and Turkey.\n\nThe Expulsion\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Portuguese Jewish diaspora was mainly a result of the expulsion decree[251] issued in 1496 by the Portuguese monarchy, which targeted Jews living in Portugal. This decree forced many Jews to either convert to Christianity (leading to the emergence of Cristão-novos and of Crypto-Judaism practices) or to leave the country, leading to a diaspora of Portuguese Jews throughout Europe and Brazil. In Brazil[252] many of the early colonists were also originally Sephardi Jews who, following their conversion, were known as New Christians (see Anusim).[253][254]\n\nThe Emigration\n\nIt is believed that up to 10,000 Portuguese-Jews might have migrated to France from 1497; this phenomenon remained noticeable up until the 1600s, when the Netherlands became a favourite choice.[255][256]\n\nThe Netherlands and England became in fact top destinations for Portuguese-Jewish emigrants due to the absence of the Inquisition. Other that adding to the economical and cultural aspects of their host countries,[257] the Portuguese-Jews also established institutions that are still present, such as the Esnoga, in Amsterdam, The Congregation Shearith Israel – the oldest Jewish congregation in the United States – , Bevis Marks Synagogue – the oldest synagogue in the United Kingdom – the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal – the oldest synagogue in Canada – , Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, City Lights Booksellers & Publishers or the David Cardozo Academy in Jerusalem.\n\nMinor communities thrived in the Balkans,[258] Italy,[259] the Ottoman Empire[260][261] and Germany, especially in Hamburg (see Elijah Aboab Cardoso Joan d'Acosta and Samuel ben Abraham Aboab).[262]\n\nPortuguese-Jews were also responsible for the appearance of Papiamentu[263] (a 300,000 speakers-strong[264] Portuguese-based creole now official language in Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire) and of Sranan Tongo, an English-based creole influenced by Portuguese spoken by more than 500,000 people in Suriname.[265][266]\n\nThe Shoah\n\nDuring the Shoah, nearly 4,000 Jews of Portuguese descent residing in the Netherlands lost their lives, making up the largest group of casualties with a Portuguese background in the Nazi German genocide.[267][268] Among famous Portuguese-Jewish victims of the Shoah is painter Baruch Lopes Leão de Laguna. It is worth highlighting that, although officially neutral, the Portuguese regime at that time, Estado Novo, aligned with Germany's ideology and failed to fully protect its citizens and other Jewish people living overseas.[269][270][271] Despite the lack of support by the Portuguese authorities, some Jews of both Portuguese[272] and non-Portuguese descent, were saved thanks to the actions of individual citizens such as Carlos Sampaio Garrido, Joaquim Carreira, José Brito Mendes and the well known case of Aristides de Sousa Mendes,[273] who alone helped 34,000 Jews escaping Nazi violence.[274]\n\nPortuguese-Jews nowadays\n\nOver 500 years after the expulsion decree, in 2015 the Portuguese parliament officially acknowledged the expulsion of its citizens of Jewish descent as unrightful. To try and make up for long-lasting historical injustices, the government passed a law known as \"Law of Return\".[275] The law aimed to right the historic wrongs of the Portuguese Inquisition, which resulted in the expulsion or forced conversion of thousands of Jews from Portugal in the 15th and 16th centuries. The law grants citizenship to any descendants of those persecuted Jews able to confirm their Sephardic Jewish ancestry and a \"connection\" to Portugal. It is intended to provide a measure of justice and recognition to those whose families suffered from discrimination and persecution five centuries prior.[276][277][278][279]\n\nSince 2015, more than 140,000 people of Sephardic descent, from 60 countries (mostly from Israel or Turkey) applied for Portuguese citizenship.[280][281][282][283] Unfortunately, soon after this law was approved, it transpired that a number of foreigners with no legitimate historical Sephardic links were granted Portuguese citizenship, among those, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich became Portuguese – thus EU – citizens under the new law. Due to cases of abuse and loopholes in this law which was meant as reparation towards a minority, the judiciary was prompted to intervene and review this law.[284][285][286][287]\n\nNotable people of Portuguese-Jewish descent include:\n\nAmatus Lusitanus (1511–1568): Jewish physician said to have discovered the valves in the azygos vein.\n\nGracia Mendes Nasi (1510–1569): Philanthropist and one of the wealthiest Jewish women of Renaissance Europe\n\nLeonora Duarte (1610–1678): a Flemish composer and musician\n\nBaruch Spinoza (1632–1677): Dutch philosopher of Portuguese-Jewish origin\n\nCatherine da Costa (1679–1756): English miniaturist\n\nDavid Ricardo (1772–1823): a British political economist\n\nRehuel Lobatto (1797–1866): Dutch mathematician whose notable contributions include Gauss-Lobatto quadrature method and the Lobatto polynomials\n\nIsaäc da Costa (1798–1860): a Jewish poet.\n\nPereire brothers (19th century): major figures in the development of France's finance and infrastructure\n\nSamuel Sarphati (1813–1866): Dutch physician and Amsterdam city planner\n\nSolomon Nunes Carvalho (1815–1897): American painter, photographer, author and inventor\n\nGrace Aguilar (1816–1847): English novelist, poet and writer on Jewish history and religion\n\nCamille Pissarro (1830–1903): a Danish-French Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painter considered the \"dean of the Impressionist painters\"[288]\n\nFrancis Lewis Cardozo (1836–1903): American clergyman, politician, and educator. When elected in South Carolina as Secretary of State in 1868, he was the first African American to hold a statewide office in the United States\n\nMaud Nathan (1862–1946): American social worker, labor activist and women's suffragist\n\nFederigo Enriques (1871–1946): Italian mathematician, now known principally as the first to give a classification of algebraic surfaces in birational geometry, and other contributions in algebraic geometry\n\nFrieda Belinfante (1904–1995): Dutch cellist, philharmonic conductor, a prominent lesbian, and a member of the Dutch resistance during World War II\n\nWilliam Leonard Pereira (1909–1985): American architect\n\nAbraham Pais (1918–2000): Dutch-American physicist and science historian\n\nLouisa Benson Craig (1941–2010): Burmese-born two-time beauty pageant winner and Karen rebel leader of Portuguese-Jewish descent[289][290]\n\nAlberto Portugheis (1941): Argentine pianist\n\nHenrique Cymerman (1959): Israeli journalist\n\nShon Weissman (1996): Israeli footballer\n\nThe Americas outside of Brazil\n\n[edit]\n\nThe United States\n\nSee also: Portuguese Americans and Portuguese-American neighborhoods\n\nThe United States has had bilateral relations with Portugal since its early years. After the American Revolutionary War, Portugal became the first neutral country to acknowledge the United States.[291]\n\nDespite Portugal never colonizing—nor attempting to colonize—the current territory of the United States of America, navigators such as João Fernandes Lavrador, Miguel Corte-Real and João Rodrigues Cabrilho are among the earliest documented European explorers. The Dighton Rock, in Southeastern Massachusetts, is a testimony of the early Portuguese presence in the country.[292][293][294][295]\n\nMathias de Sousa, who was potentially a Sephardic Jew of mixed African background, is believed to be the first documented Portuguese resident of colonial United States.[296] Additionally, one of the earliest Portuguese Jews in the United States, Isaac Touro, is commemorated in the name of the country's oldest synagogue, the Touro Synagogue.\n\nDespite the relations between the two countries dating hundreds of years, the Portuguese started to settle in significant numbers only in the 19th century, with major migration waves occurring in the first half of the 20th century, especially from the Azores.[297][298][299][300] Of the 1,4 million Portuguese Americans found in the nation today (0.4% of the US population) the majority of them are originally from the Azores. Not only the arrival of Azorean emigrants was easier because of geographic proximity, but it was also encouraged by the Azorean Refugee Act of 1958, sponsored by Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy and Rhode Island senator John Pastore so as to help the population affected by the 1957–58, the Capelinhos volcano eruption.[301][302][303] Moreover, it is noteworthy that the 1965 Immigration Act stated that if someone had legal or American relatives in the United States who could serve as a sponsor, they could be given the status of legal aliens. This act dramatically increased Portuguese immigration into the 1970s and 1980s.[304]\n\nMajor Portuguese communities are found in New Jersey (particularly in Newark), the New England states, California and along the Gulf Coast (Louisiana). Springfield, Illinois once possessed the largest Portuguese community in the Midwest.[305] In the Pacific, Hawaii (see Portuguese immigration to Hawaii) has a sizable Portuguese population, encouraged by the availability of labor contracts on the islands 150 years ago.[306]\n\nThe Portuguese community in the US is the second largest in the Americas after the one found in Brazil.\n\nCanada\n\nSee also: Portuguese Canadians\n\nCanada, particularly Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, has developed a significant Portuguese community since the 1940s. The availability of more job opportunities in Canada attracted a significant number of Portuguese migrants, leading to the flourishing of Portuguese culture in the subsequent decade. Many Portuguese residents took the initiative to purchase homes and establish their own businesses, resulting in contributing to the Canadian cultural landscape.\n\nAccording to the 2016 Census, there were 482,610, or 1.4% of Canadians, who claimed full or partial Portuguese ancestry.[307]\n\nTwo major neighbourhoods where the Portuguese heritage is particularly present include Little Portugal, in both Toronto and Montréal. Montréal's Little Portugal, known as \"Petit Portugal\" in French, is adorned with numerous Portuguese shops, restaurants, and cafes, and it is also home to \"Parc du Portugal\" (Portugal's park), embellished with vibrant murals and elements inspired by Portuguese design.[308][309]\n\nPortuguese Canadians are proud of their heritage and, despite the geographical distance between the two countries, interest towards the language remains vivid.[310][311][312] Recent statistics reveal that the Portuguese language is spoken by over 330,000 Canadians, making up around 1% of the population.[313] It is considered one of the most significant cultural contributions that the Portuguese have made to Canada, adding to its diversity and enriching the country as a whole.[314][315][316]\n\nDespite the growth the community has seen in the 20th century, significant testimonies of the Portuguese presence in Canada include the name of one of the 10 provinces of Canada: Newfoundland and Labrador. King Henry VII coined the name \"New found land\" for the territory explored by Sebastian and John Cabot.. In Portuguese, the land is known as Terra Nova, which translates to \"new land,\" and is also referred to as Terre-Neuve in French, the name for the province's island region. The name Terra Nova is commonly used on the island, including in the name of Terra Nova National Park. The influence of early Portuguese exploration is evident in the name of Labrador, which is derived from the surname of Portuguese navigator João Fernandes Lavrador.[317] Other remnants of early Portuguese exploration include toponyms such as Baccalieu (from bacalhau, Portuguese for codfish) and Portugal Cove. Portuguese cartographer Diogo Ribeiro is responsible for one of the earliest maps depicting the territory of modern-day Canada.[318]\n\nThe Caribbean\n\nThere are Portuguese influenced people with their own Portuguese-influenced culture and Portuguese-based dialects in parts of the world other than former Portuguese colonies. In the Caribbean, in particular, although never colonized by the Portuguese, the Lusitanian heritage remains strong thanks to the migrants that from the 1830s came as indentured labourers, especially from Madeira. In fact, although the first Portuguese who settled in the region were merchants or Portuguese-Jews fleeing the Portuguese Inquisition,[319] the mass migration that took place in the 19th century coincided with the abolition of slavery in the British colonies. As a result, the Portuguese, along with Indians and Chinese, were called upon to replace slave labor. The Portuguese took a prominent part in shaping the population of the West Indies and today their descendants form an active minority in many countries across the region.\n\nAs part of a larger system of low-wage labour, about 2,500 Portuguese left for Antigua and Barbuda[320] (where, as of today, little more than 1,000 people still speak the language),[321] 30,000 to Guyana (4.3% of the population in 1891)[322] (see Portuguese immigrants in Guyana) and another 2,000 settled in Trinidad and Tobago (see Portuguese immigrants in Trinidad and Tobago)[323][324][325] between the mid-1800s and the mid-1900s.[326][327][328] With regards to Guyana the Portuguese heritage is still alive in the numerous enterprises established by members of the community. Despite today numbering about 2,000 people, the Portuguese community's contributions are recognized and recently (2016) the second international airport of the country was renamed after a Portuguese Guyanese individual.[326][329]\n\nPortuguese fishermen, farmers and indentured labourers dispersed also across other Caribbean countries, especially in Jamaica (about 5,700 people, primarily of Portuguese-Jewish descent),[330][331][332][333][334] St. Vincent and the Grenadines (0.7% of the population),[335] the briefly reclaimed by the Portuguese Empire island of Barbados – where there is still high influence from the Portuguese community[336] and Suriname (see Portuguese immigrants in Suriname). Dealing with Suriname, it is noteworthy that its first capital, Torarica (literally \"rich Torah\" in Portuguese), was established by Portuguese-Jewish settlers. Minor communities exist in Grenada,[337] Saint Lucia,[338] Saint Kitts and Nevis[339] and the Cayman Islands[340]\n\nIn the Caribbean territories of Overseas France there are about 4,000 Portuguese people, especially in Saint Barthélemy (where they constitute about a third of the population), Guadeloupe and Martinique.[341][342][343]\n\nPortuguese heritage is still very tangible in Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao. In the three territories, the official language, Papiamentu, retains numerous Portuguese elements.\n\nMoreover, the North Atlantic archipelago of Bermuda (10%[344] to 25%[345] of the population) has had sustained immigration especially from the Azores, as well as from Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands since the 1840s.[346]\n\nLatin America (excluding Brazil)\n\nMexico (see Portuguese Mexicans) has had flows of Portuguese immigration since the colonial period until the early 20th century, the most important settlements are in north eastern cities,[347] such as Saltillo, Monterrey, Durango and Torreon. Santiago Tequixquiac, due to its natural conditions and its lime and stone mining deposits, was a place of settlement for Portuguese Crypto-Jews during the colonial period, they were brought there together with the Tlaxcalans and peninsular Spaniards to appease the Otomi indigenous people, in that town. Many Lusitanian cultural traits were preserved throughout the 19th century, such as forcados, gastronomy, some Sephardic customs and the surnames of its inhabitants. Every year dozens of young people seek to experience the adventure of catching a bull in the bullring, and one of the Portuguese traditions that prevail in Mexico.[348] A notable Portuguese-Mexican Jew was Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal, executed by burning at the stake by the Inquisition for judaizing in 1596.\n\nPortuguese communities are also present in Central American countries such as Cuba, Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico.[349] Notable members of the community include activist Ada Bello, businesswoman Alexis Victoria Yeb, former Nicaraguan First Lady Lila Teresita Abaunza and Felipa Colón de Toledo.\n\nVenezuela has the biggest number of Portuguese people in Latin America after Brazil (see Portuguese Venezuelans) . Portuguese started arriving to Venezuela in the early and middle 20th century as economic immigrants particularly from Madeira.[350] In Venezuela about 1.3 million people (4.61% of the population) is of Portuguese descent.[350] The emigration towards Venezuela occurred mainly in the 1940s and 1950s. The extense Luso-Venezuelan community includes personalities such as María Gabriela de Faría, Marjorie de Sousa, Vanessa Gonçalves, Kimberly Dos Ramos and Laura Gonçalves.\n\nColombia did not witness mass Portuguese immigration, since the Portuguese tended to move to countries where immigration was not curbed but promoted, such as Brazil and Venezuela. Although Portuguese may have explored the area during the Age of Discovery, there is not evidence that they established communities in nowadays Colombia. It is noteworthy that Colombia was under full Spanish sovereignty, as defined by the Treaty of Tordesillas. The Portuguese embassy in Bogota estimates that there are around 800 Portuguese nationals who live in Colombia, although the numbers could be much higher as Portuguese are not obliged to register their presence within consulates abroad. The number of people of Portuguese ancestry is not known, but it is safe to assume that they have integrated very well in the Colombian society and are indistinguishable, except for some surnames, from other Colombians.[351][352]\n\nIn Peru, Portuguese immigration gradually began at the time of the Viceroyalty of Peru until the beginning of the 19th century, without being massive. Many sailors who traveled along the Peruvian coast, and later entered the country following the route from the Atlantic through the Amazon River established themselves in Peru, intermarrying with local people. There are also records of Luso-Brazilians in the cities surrounding the Brazil-Peru border. Although the number of Portuguese citizens in Peru is not high (about 2,000 people),[353] Peruvians with Portuguese ancestors could easily be as much as 1 million people, including direct and indirect descendants, which represents about 3% of the national total.[354] A famous Peruvian of Portuguese descent is popular TV presenter Janet Barboza [es].\n\nThe Cono Sur region had Portuguese immigration since the early 20th century. The community in Argentina (See Portuguese Argentines and Cape Verdean Argentines), Uruguay (see Portuguese Uruguayans) and Chile numbers around 255,000 people combined[355][356][357] (0.37% of the population of the region).\n\nIn particular, Portuguese Uruguayans are mainly of Azorean descent[358] even though Portuguese presence in the country dates back to the colonal times, in particular to the establishment of Colonia del Sacramento by the Portuguese in 1680,[359] which eventually turned into a regional center of smuggling. Other Portuguese entered Uruguay as Brazilians of Portuguese descent, who crossed the border into the country ever since it became independent from Brazil itself. During the second half of the 19th century and part of the 20th, several additional Portuguese immigrants arrived; the last wave was during 1930–1965.[360][361] As of 2021, 3,069[362] Portuguese citizens have registered as residing in Uruguay within Portuguese authorities. In addition to Portuguese citizens, there are also many luso-descendants (lusodescendentes) whose numbers are hard to estimate.[363][355]\n\nArgentina-Portugal relations date back to the early European explorations in the region, as the Río de la Plata (literally, silver river) was first explored by the Portuguese in the 1510s. In Argentina, Portuguese immigration has been relatively limited due to a preference for the Portuguese-speaking neighboring Brazil. However, the Portuguese constituted the second-largest immigrant group after the Spanish before 1816 and continued to arrive throughout the 19th century. While a significant number settled in the interior of the country, with the primary destination for Portuguese immigrants being Buenos Aires. Many men from Lisbon, Porto, and coastal regions of Portugal, with diverse occupations but predominantly in maritime professions such as sailors, stevedores, and porters, were already present in these areas. During the 1970s, they began to organize themselves ethnically, and over the following decades, community life, including mutual support organizations, clubs, and newspapers, became more active.[364][365] A popular member of the Portuguese community in Argentina was best-selling author Silvina Bullrich.\n\nAfrica\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Portuguese Africans\n\nIn the early twentieth century the Portuguese government encouraged white emigration to Angola and Mozambique, and by the 1970s, there were up to 1 million Portuguese settlers living in their overseas African provinces.[366] Minor communities also settled in Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe, Portuguese influences are still found in these countries, where Portuguese enjoys the status of official language.\n\nFollowing the Carnation Revolution, as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975, An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal or moved to other countries. For many, Portugal was more an historical homeland than the actual country of birth. Despite this, thousands of people left and went to a country they had never been to.[367] These people are often referred as Retornados (literally, those who came back).\n\nOther Portuguese moved to South Africa, Brazil, Botswana and Algeria.[368][369][370][371][372] In particular, in South Africa there is now the largest Portuguese community in the continent, numbering about 700,000 people (more than the city of Lisbon itself).\n\nPortuguese descendants still make up a significant minority in the former colonies where, as a result of intermarriage and cultural influences, they form the bulk of Mestiços (Mixed African-European people).[373][374][375][376]\n\nIn Europe outside of Portugal\n\n[edit]\n\nFrance, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, Andorra and Switzerland\n\nDue to the linguistic proximity between Portuguese and French and the plurality of schools in Portugal which promotes French as foreign language many Portuguese nationals started migrating towards French speaking countries in Europe (namely, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco and the French-speaking part of Switzerland) in the 1960s, for economic reasons and to avoid conscription to fight in Portuguese Overseas provinces. Interestingly, migration to Andorra - where, although Catalan is the sole official language, French is widely spoken - made the Portuguese the third largest ethnic group in the state, after Andorrans and Spaniards.[377][378][379][380]\n\nAccording to the most recent estimates of both Eurostat and INE, around 15.4% of Portuguese people are fluent in French.[381][382] Although relatively popular still, French has been dwindling, and English is taught in schools as a global language. For instance, in 2005 the proportion of Portuguese adults fluent in French stood at 24%[383] which indicates a clear decline in younger speakers. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy noticing that 70% of middle school students study French.[384] French media are widely available in Portugal (newspapers, magazines, radio stations and TV channels) and many libraries still offer a French-language section.\n\nSome Portuguese migration to the more affluent French speaking countries in Europe exists, although not as significant as in post-WWII decades.\n\nBetween France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, Andorra and Switzerland there are more than 2,260,000 Portuguese citizens and, taking int account People with Portuguese ancestry not holding Portuguese nationality their numbers could easily soar up to 2,7 million: for instance, France alone hosts 450,000 Luso-descendants or lusodescendentes. In fact, with more than 1,55 million Portuguese citizens[385] and up to 2 million people of Portuguese descent,[386] France hosts, by far, the largest community of Portuguese people outside of Portugal, second only to Brazil (see Portuguese in France).\n\nThere are records of Portuguese people living in France since the early centuries of the Portuguese kingdom, notably merchants but also Portuguese-Jews and Portuguese nobles: even Louis XIV or \"le Roi Soleil\" was of Portuguese descent through his grandfather Philip II. Despite their being present in the country for centuries, Portuguese nationals have only relatively recently started to move to France in large numbers: for comparison, there were less than 40,000 Portuguese in France on the eve of WWII.[387][388]\n\nFrom the 1960s, the economic stagnation of Brazil, a traditional destination, measures taken by France to attract Portuguese workers, António de Oliveira Salazar's dictatorship and the colonial wars, were all factors that contributed to 1,000,000 people fleeing Portugal and going to France from 1960 to 1974.[389][390][391][392][393] After 1974, despite remaining a major destination for Portuguese migrants, Portuguese nationals have started moving to Luxembourg and Monaco (1980s), Switzerland (1990s) and – increasingly – Belgium and Andorra (2000s). This is also due to the tightening control of immigration by French authorities following the 1973 oil crisis.[394][395][396][397]\n\nPortuguese constitute 23.4% of the population of Luxembourg, which makes them one of the largest ethnic groups as a proportion of the total national population, second only to native Luxembourgers (see Portuguese in Luxembourg). Andorra is inhabited by 16,300 Portuguese nationals (19.4% of the population)[398][399], Monaco hosts around 1,000 Portuguese nationals (3.3% of the Population)[400] while Belgium is home to around 80,000 Portuguese nationals (0.7% of the population).[401]\n\nIn Switzerland, Portuguese have settled mainly in Romandy. In fact, while official figures suggest that Portuguese is spoken by 5% of the population of Switzerland as a whole at home - by comparison Italian, an official language of Switzerland, is spoken by 8.8% - the figure rises to 10.1% in French speaking Switzerland, thus making Portuguese the most spoken language in the region's households, second only to French. Around 460,000 Portuguese nationals live in the country according to the latest estimates (5.3% of Switzerland's population).[402]\n\nFamous Swiss people of Portuguese descent include snooker player Alexander Ursenbacher, models Pedro Mendes and Nomi Fernandes, actress Yaël Boon and Olympic medalist Stéphane Lambiel.\n\nNotable Belgians of Portuguese descent include – apart from nobles such as Queen Elizabeth or King Leopold III – fashion designer Veronique Branquinho, footballer Yannick Carrasco, actress Rose Bertram, sprinter Jonathan Sacoor and actress Helena Noguerra.\n\nDespite Portuguese migration towards these countries has steadily declined over the years, from 2003 to 2022 around 615,000 Portuguese nationals have moved towards these countries, especially during the years following the 2008 financial crisis. Interestingly, as of 2021 around 40% has returned to Portugal, in particular after 2015, when the economic outlook the Mediterranean country bettered significantly.[403]\n\nImmigration of Portuguese nationals in Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Switzerland in 2003–2022 (2022 data for Belgium missing)[404] 2003–2006 2007–2010 2011–2014 2015–2018 2019–2022 Total Switzerland 50,346 59,329 69,172 40,438 33,608 252,893 France 39,960 33,708 68,216 40,345 28,967 211,196 Luxembourg 14,956 16,605 18,592 16,723 14,556 81,432 Belgium 7,694 11,064 14,693 11,297 9,029 53,777 Andorra 7,167 3,204 1,067 1,122 884 13,444 Total 120,123 123,910 171,740 109,925 87,044 612,742\n\nGermany\n\nSee also: Portuguese in Germany\n\nIn the post-war period, Hundreds of thousands of Portuguese settled as guest workers in other European countries, especially in Western Europe. On 17 March 1964, the recruitment agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and Portugal was signed under the Erhard I cabinet. The Portuguese Armando Rodrigues de Sá was officially welcomed in 1964 as the millionth \"guest worker\" in Germany and was given a certificate of honor and a two-seater Zündapp Sport Combinette – Mokick.[405] The number of Portuguese citizens living in Germany is estimated at 245,000 as of 2021.[406] The largest Portuguese community is located in Hamburg with about 25,000 people with Portuguese descent. There is also a Portugiesenviertel (Portuguese quarter) in Hamburg near the Port of Hamburg and between the subway stations of Landungsbrücken and Baumwall where many Portuguese restaurants and cafes are located there.\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, people of Portuguese origin were estimated at 400,000 in 2021 by Portuguese authorities (see Portuguese in the United Kingdom).[407][408] Although unconfirmed, other sources claim that there might be as much as 500,000 Portuguese in the country,[409] a considerably higher than the estimated 170,000 Portuguese-born people residing in the country in 2021[410] (this figure does not include British-born people of Portuguese descent).\n\nIn areas such as Thetford and the crown dependencies of Jersey and Guernsey, the Portuguese form the largest ethnic minority groups at 30% of the population, 9.03% and 3.13% respectively.\n\nThe British capital London is home to the largest number of Portuguese people in the UK, with the majority being found in the Western boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth and Westminster.[411]\n\nPortuguese ancestry in the Brazilian population\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Portuguese Brazilians\n\nPortuguese emigration to Brazil from the beginning of colonization, in 1500 to Present Source: Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) Decade Nationality 1500–1700 1701–1760 1808–1817 1827–1829 1837–1841 1856–1857 1881–1900 1901–1930 1931–1950 1951–1960 1961–1967 1981–1991 1991–2023 Portuguese 100,000 600,000 24,000 2,004 629 16,108 316,204 754,147 148,699 235,635 54,767 4,605 400,000\n\nDue to the emigration of a significant part of the Portuguese towards Brazil, they played a particularly important role in the formation of Brazilians as a nation, becoming one of its main components. In fact, given the shared past and the fact that Portuguese deeply influenced the formation of Brazilians as a nation, the Portuguese are the largest European immigrant group in Brazil. In colonial times, over 700,000 Portuguese settled in Brazil, and most of them went there during the gold rush of the 18th century.[412] Brazil received more European settlers during its colonial era than any other country in the Americas. Between 1500 and 1760, about 700,000 Europeans immigrated to Brazil, compared to 530,000 European immigrants in the United States.[413][414] They managed to be the only significant European population to populate the country during colonization, even though there were French and Dutch invasions. The Portuguese migration was strongly marked by the predominance of men (colonial reports from the 16th and 17th centuries almost always report the absence or rarity of Portuguese women). This lack of women worried the Jesuits, who asked the Portuguese King to send any kind of Portuguese women to Brazil, even the socially undesirable (e.g. prostitutes or women with mental maladies such as Down Syndrome) if necessary.[415][416] The Crown responded by sending groups of Iberian orphan maidens to marry both cohorts of marriageable men, the nobles and the peasants. Some of which were even primarily studying to be nuns.[415][417]\n\nThe Crown also shipped over many Órfãs do Rei of what was considered \"good birth\" to colonial Brazil to marry Portuguese settlers of high rank. Órfãs do Rei literally translates to \"Orphans of the King\", and they were Portuguese female orphans in nubile age. There were noble and non-noble maidens and they were daughters of military compatriots who died in battle for the king or noblemen who died overseas and whose upbringing was paid by the Crown. Bahia's port in the East received one of the first groups of orphans in 1551. In colonial Brazil, the Portuguese men competed for women, because among the African slaves and the female component of Indigenous peoples of the Americas were minorities.[419] This explains why the Portuguese men left more descendants in Brazil than the Amerindian or African men did. The Indigenous and African women were \"dominated\" by the Portuguese men, preventing men of color to find partners with whom they could have children. Added to this, White people had a much better quality of life and therefore a lower mortality rate than the black and indigenous population. Then, even though the Portuguese migration during colonial Brazil was smaller (3.2 million Indians estimated at the beginning of colonization and 4.8 million Africans brought since then, compared to the descendants of the over 700,000 Portuguese immigrants) the \"white\" population (whose ancestry was predominantly Portuguese) was as large as the \"non-white\" population in the early 19th century, just before independence from Portugal.[420][421][419] After independence from Portugal in 1822, around 1.7 million Portuguese immigrants settled in Brazil.[419]\n\nPortuguese immigration into Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries was marked by its concentration in the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The immigrants opted mostly for urban centers. Portuguese women appeared with some regularity among immigrants, with percentage variation in different decades and regions of the country. However, even among the more recent influx of Portuguese immigrants at the turn of the 20th century, there were 319 men to each 100 women among them.[422] The Portuguese were different from other immigrants in Brazil, like the Germans,[423] or Italians[424] who brought many women along with them (even though the proportion of men was higher in any immigrant community). Despite the small female proportion, Portuguese men married mainly Portuguese women. Female immigrants rarely married Brazilian men. In this context, the Portuguese had a rate of endogamy which was higher than any other European immigrant community, and behind only the Japanese among all immigrants.[425]\n\nEven with Portuguese heritage, many Portuguese-Brazilians identify themselves as being simply Brazilians, since Portuguese culture was a dominant cultural influence in the formation of Brazil (like many British Americans in the United States, who will never describe themselves as of British extraction, but only as \"Americans\", since British culture was a dominant cultural influence in the formation of The United States).\n\nIn 1872, there were 3.7 million Whites in Brazil (the vast majority of them of Portuguese ancestry), 4.1 million mixed-race people (mostly of Portuguese-African-Amerindian ancestry) and 1.9 million Blacks. These numbers give the percentage of 80% of people with total or partial Portuguese ancestry in Brazil in the 1870s.[426]\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a new large wave of immigrants from Portugal arrived. From 1881 to 1991, over 1.5 million Portuguese immigrated to Brazil. In 1906, for example, there were 133,393 Portuguese-born people living in Rio de Janeiro, comprising 16% of the city's population. Rio is, still today, considered the largest \"Portuguese city\" outside of Portugal itself, with 1% Portuguese-born people.[413][427]\n\nGenetic studies also confirm the strong Portuguese genetic influence in Brazilians. According to a study, at least half of the Brazilian population's Y Chromosome (male inheritance) comes from Portugal. Black Brazilians have an average of 48% non-African genes, most of them may come from Portuguese ancestors. On the other hand, 33% Amerindian and 28% African contribution to the total mtDNA (female inheritance) of white Brazilians was found[3][4]\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a predominant degree of European ancestry (mostly Portuguese, due to the dominant Portuguese influx among European colonization and immigration to Brazil) combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values from 51% to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.[428]\n\nA large community-based multicenter autosomal study from 2015, considering representative samples from three different urban communities located in the Northeast (Salvador, capital of Bahia), Southeast (Bambuí, interior of Minas Gerais) and South Brazilian (Pelotas, interior of Rio Grande do Sul) regions, estimated European ancestry to be 42.4%, 83.8% and 85.3%, respectively.[429] In all three cities, European ancestors were mainly Iberian.\n\nIt was estimated that around 5 million Brazilians (2.3% of the country's population) can acquire Portuguese citizenship, due to the last Portuguese nationality law that grants citizenship to grandchildren of Portuguese nationals.[430]\n\nOceania\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Portuguese Australians and Portuguese New Zealanders\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have sizeable Portuguese communities.\n\nIn Australia, although their numbers are relatively small in comparison to the Greek and Italian communities, the Portuguese constitute a highly organized, self-aware, and active community across various aspects of Australian life. Despite being among the early settlers, with some (unproven) theories that state they might have discovered Australia, their numbers have never been massive, when compared to major communities. The Portuguese immigration to Australia experienced a boom after the Carnation Revolution and the Indonesian Invasion of Timor-Leste. The Portuguese are dispersed throughout the country and engage in activities such as sports teams, social clubs, radio programs, newspapers, cultural festivals, culinary events, and even have a designated Portuguese neighborhood. The 73,903 people of Portuguese descent constitute about 0.28% of the Australian population. Portuguese cuisine has gained popularity within mainstream Australian society, exemplified by the rapid expansion and establishment of restaurants and fast-food outlets such as \"Nando's\", \"Oporto,\" and \"Ogalo.\" The delectable Portuguese pastry known as \"pastel de nata\" is widely enjoyed and readily available throughout the country. Many of the Portuguese are from Madeira.[431][432][433][434][435] Notable Portuguese Australians include Naomi Sequeira, Kate DeAraugo, Junie Morosi, Lyndsey Rodrigues, Sophie Masson and Irina Dunn.\n\nThe community in New Zealand is much smaller and the 1,500 Portuguese people living there (although the numbers could be significantly higher) constitute about 0.03% of the population. On 22 April 2010, the Office of Ethnic Affairs officially recognized Portuguese New Zealanders as a distinct community in New Zealand. A symbolic act of tying the 70th ribbon to Parliament's mooring stone in the Parliament House Galleria marked this recognition. In addition to their official recognition, the Portuguese community in New Zealand organizes various annual gatherings and celebrations, such as Portugal Day, and maintains a friendship association. Portuguese individuals were among the early settlers in New Zealand, although immigration from Portugal declined gradually until the 1960s. After the Carnation Revolution, the community started to increase again.[436][437]\n\nIn addition, about 900 Portuguese live in the French collectivity of New Caledonia (0.38% of the population).[438]\n\nAsia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Luso-Asians\n\nPortuguese influences are found throughout Asia, especially in Macau (see Macanese people), Timor-Leste and India (see Luso-Indian), all territories where the Portuguese maintained colonies up to the 20th century.[439][440]\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nLuso-Asian communities have had a strong presence in Southeast Asia since the 15th century. As a result of inter-ethnic marriage, dialects based on Portuguese have occurred in the former Portuguese territories now part of Malaysia (see Kristang people) and Singapore (see Eurasian Singaporeans). In particular, notable Kristang people from Malaysia include Kimberley Leggett, Jojo Sturys [ms], Joan Margaret Marbeck, Elaine Daly [ms], Nor Aliah Lee [ms], Melissa Tan, Andrea Fonseka, Anna Jobling [ms] and Cheryl Samad [ms]. People of Portuguese descent from Singapore include personalities such as Pilar Arlando, Mary Klass and Vernetta Lopez.\n\nOther communities are found in Indonesia (see Portuguese Indonesians and Mardjiker), with significant populations of Portuguese descent living in Lamno (the so-called \"mata biru\" or blue-eyed people), Aceh, Maluku Islands and Kampung Tugu.[441][442][443][444][445][446] Portuguese vestiges in Indonesia include dozens of loanwords as well as the introduction of Roman Catholicism (3.12% of the population but still the major religion in NTT) and Keroncong, similar to Portuguese cavaquinho.[447][448][449][450] In recent years many Indonesians of Portuguese descent have been active in the entertainment industry such as, among others, Puteri Indonesia Elfin Pertiwi Rappa or actress Millane Fernandez [id]. In neighbouring Philippines, actress Sophie Albert is another example of Portuguese-South Asian working in the said industry.\n\nDue to early Portuguese explorers, communities of Portuguese descent are also found in Myanmar (see Bayingyi people)[451][452] and Thailand (see Kudi Chin).[453][454] In Thailand, during the reign of King Narai the Great the Portuguese community in Ayutthaya is thought to have peaked at 6,000 people.[455] Notable Thai of Portuguese descent include Francis Chit, known for being the first Thai photographer, Maria Guyomar de Pinha, responsible for introducing Fios de ovos (or Foi Thong in Thai) and sangkhaya into Thai cuisine or actresses such as Kung Nang Pattamasuta [th], Krystal Vee or Neon Issara [th].\n\nIndian Subcontinent\n\nIn Sri Lanka (see Burgher people, Portuguese Burghers and Mestiços), home to around 40,000 Burghers. A notable Portuguese Burger was the best-selling author Rosemary Rogers. In addition, as a consequence of the Portuguese invasion of Sri Lanka, during the 16th and 17th centuries, many Portuguese language surnames were adopted among the Sinhalese people. As a result, Perera and Fernando eventually became the most common names in Sri Lanka.[456][457][458] Afro Sri-Lankans also retain a Portuguese identity.[459] Major Portuguese contributions to Sri Lanka, dating to the colonial period, include, apart from archaeological vestiges, about 1,000 loanwords in Sinhala of Portuguese origin,[460] Baila music (from the Portuguese bailar, meaning to dance), culinary innovations such as \"Bolo di amor\" (literally Love cake) or \"Bolo Folhado\" (literally Puff Pastry)[461] as well as the introduction of Roman Catholicism (approximately 6.1% of the population identifies as Catholic) and the endangered Sri Lankan Portuguese creole.[462][463]\n\nIn Pakistan (see Portuguese in Pakistan) there is a small Portuguese community numbering about 64 people,[464] even though other estimates point at 400 people of Portuguese origin in Karachi alone.[465] Notable Portuguese Pakistani include actress Dilshad Vadsaria and scholar Bernadette Louise Dean. Despite today not being numerically visible[466] it is noteworthy to remember that, before the partition of India, it is estimated that the Goan community in Karachi numbered up to 15,000. The majority of them after 1947 moved back to Goa or went to other territories controlled by the Portuguese, as well as to the UK.[467] The Portuguese community has greatly contributed to the musical scene of the pre-1947 Karachi.[466] As of today, about 6,000 Goans remain in Pakistan, mainly in Karachi.[465]\n\nPortuguese heritage is also present in Bangladesh, where they were the first Europeans to arrive:[468] not only did the Portuguese introduce Catholicism, a religion now professed by about 375,000 Bangladeshis,[469] but their heritage extends also to more than 1,500 words in Bengali that are of Portuguese origin.[470] In colonial times, the Portuguese population in Bangladesh may have reached 40,000 people[471][472] but, as time went by, many resettled to other colonies. Those who remained are now perfectly integrated in the larger Bangladeshi society. Notable examples of Portuguese influence in Bangladesh are the surnames bore by a large part of the Catholics, as well as Bangladesh's oldest church, the Holy Rosary Church in Dhaka.[473] As of now, the Portuguese community in Bangladesh is almost no existent with only a few expatriates[474] and some descendants of the early settlers.\n\nNevertheless, the most important Portuguese community found today in the Indian subcontinent – as well as in Asia as a whole when taking into account people with distant Portuguese ancestry – remains the one that has settled in India, especially in Goa, Damão e Diu and Dadrá e Nagar Aveli.[475]\n\nEast Asia\n\nA small but growing Portuguese community – consisting mainly of recent expats and numbering about 3,500 people – is found in Japan,[476][477] South Korea,[478] China[479][480] and Taiwan, whose name used by European literature until the 20th century – Formosa, meaning \"Beautiful (island)\" - came from Portuguese.[481]\n\nA 20,700 people-strong community also exists in Hong Kong, mainly of Macanese descent.[482] Notable people of Portuguese descent from Hong Kong include personalities such as Joe Junior, Michelle Reis, Rowan Varty, Rita Carpio and Ray Cordeiro.\n\nDue to the shared past, the most important Portuguese community in Eastern Asia is the one in Macau, that was, until 1999, a Portuguese colony. With more than 150,000 Portuguese citizens, accounting for 22.34% of the total population, Portuguese influence in Macau is still very visible and Macau still has, as of today, the largest concentration of Portuguese nationals in Asia as well as one of the most important in the world.[483] Notable people from Macau of Portuguese descent include personalities such as singer Germano Guilherme [zh].\n\nList of countries by population of Portuguese heritage\n\n[edit]\n\nCountry Population % of country Criterion Portuguese in North America Portuguese American 1,400,000

In the 16th century, Portugal's literature entered its \"Golden Age\", during which time poets like Luís de Camões and Francisco de Sá de Miranda were some of the nation's most renowned literary figures.[610] Portuguese is often referred as to the \"língua de Camões\" (Camões's language), highlighting the importance the author had in forging the national identity as well as the domestic literary production.[611]\n\nFamous Portuguese authors from the Age of Discoveries include Públia Hortênsia de Castro, Gomes Eanes de Zurara, Joana Vaz, Fernão Mendes Pinto (author of Peregrinação), Joana da Gama, Fernão Lopes and Violante do Céu.[612]\n\nA new generation of authors appeared in the 19th century, including Almeida Garrett, who is credited with founding modern Portuguese literature. His writings reflect the political and social revolutions taking place in Portugal at the time, and his writing style is recognized as exceptionally original and unique for the time.[613]\n\nPortuguese authors like Fernando Pessoa and Guerra Junqueiro gained international acclaim for their writings in the 20th century. In this century there was a great rise in the country's literary production. It is worth mentioning that Pessoa, due to him being considered very innovative and ground-breaking for his time, is often referred to as one of the most emblematic 20th-century Portuguese authors and his contributions to the nation's literary production are among the most notable ones.[614][615]\n\nWith modern authors like José Saramago and António Lobo Antunes, receiving both home and foreign critical recognition, Portuguese literature is still thriving today. These authors write about identity, culture, and society, and their writing reflects Portugal's rich and varied cultural legacy.\n\nNotable Portuguese authors from the XIX centur onwards also include Ana Vicente, Richard Zimler, Ana Plácido, Mário Cesariny, Ana Hatherly, Cesário Verde, Isabel Stilwell, Miguel Torga, Ana de Castro Osório, Alves Redol, Maria Archer, Antero de Quental, Isabel Alçada, Wenceslau de Moraes, Vimala Devi, Alexandre Herculano, Dulce Maria Cardoso, Maria Gabriela Llansol, Abel Botelho, Fernanda Botelho, Isabel da Nóbrega, Rita Vilela [pt], Maria Gabriela Llansol and Natália Correia. Dealing with contemporary poetry, notable figures include Matilde Campilho [pt] and Ana Daniel.\n\nMoreover, Susan Lowndes Marques, writer and journalist, was a leading figure in the Portuguese-British community in Lisbon, and contributed to promoting Portugal in the UK. Still nowadays, with more than 2 million Britons coming to Portugal for their holidays every year, they are the most common international tourists in the country, second only to Spaniards.\n\nLaw and Justice\n\n[edit]\n\nPortugal has not had as major of an impact on law and justice as some other Western countries, yet there have been famous Portuguese personalities over the years. Portugal created a legal system for its overseas possessions during the Age of Discovery, creating the basis for current international law. Another notable example is the 20th century, lawyer and diplomat José Cutileiro, who played a significant role in the negotiations that led to Portugal and Spain's entry into the European Union in 1986.\n\nParticularly in the domain of human rights, Portugal has contributed significantly to the growth of international rights. The European Convention on Human Rights, which was established in 1950 with the purpose of defending human rights and basic freedoms, was one of the initiatives championed by Portugal, together with other EU countries, since its accession into the EU.\n\nNotable Portuguese active in the field of Law and Justice include Paula Teixeira da Cruz (previous Minister of Justice), Boaventura de Sousa Santos GOSE (one of the most prominent Portuguese living left-wing intellectuals. ), Susana Amador, Henrique O'Neill, Maria Santos Pais (served as Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on Violence against Children), Januário Lourenço (invented the Electronic Power of Attorney and the Electronic Divorce.), Isabel Oneto, Guilherme d'Oliveira Martins, Heloísa Apolónia and António Vitorino (former European Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs).\n\nScience and technology\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Portugal, research and development (R&D) units belong mainly to state universities and autonomous state research institutes carry out science and technology through a network. However, there are also non-state research institutes and some private projects.[616][617]\n\nIn the country's history the University of Lisbon, established in 1290 as a Studium Generale played a significant role. During the Age of Discovery a prime role was given to the study of technical requirements for navigation: clearly a topic of great importance in Portugal at this period, when control of sea trade was the primary source of Portuguese wealth. It was in this very period that major Portuguese contributions to the scientific world appeared, most notably the Caravel – a light and fast ship designed for coastal navigation and the Portolan – a maritime map used since the early Middle Ages for navigation. The Portuguese were also responsible for the introduction of the Compass rose on maps[618] and for the improvement of devices and techniques for guidance and navigation, such as the cross-staff.[619]\n\nOther contributions include the nonius, the nautical astrolabe, the boat and the Black Maple Sword. During these times João Faras identified the Southern Cross while Francisco de Pina, in Asia, is credited for the invention of the modern Vietnamese alphabet (Quốc ngữ), often misattributed to French Alexandre de Rhodes.[620] In Viet Nam was also active botanist João de Loureiro.\n\nIn the 18th century, one of the oldest learned societies of Portugal, the Lisbon Academy of Sciences, was founded in 1779. During this time the Passarola was conceived. It was also during the 18th century that natural philosopher Jean Hyacinthe de Magellan was active and that Bento de Moura Portugal improved Thomas Savery's steam engine.\n\nWithin the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese established in 1792 the oldest engineering school of Latin America (the Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho), as well as the oldest medical college of Asia (the Escola Médico-Cirúrgica de Goa) in 1842.\n\nDuring the late 19th century the Portuguese Bartolomeu de Gusmão introduced the Pyreliophore and Maximiliano Augusto Herrmann developed the Herrmann wall telephone. It was also the time in which spectrography pioneer Francisco Miranda da Costa Lobo and telectroscope pioneer Adriano de Paiva were active.\n\nIn 1949, the Portuguese neurologist António Egas Moniz, an early developer of the cerebral angiography, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.\n\nModern contributions to the scientific community coming from Portugal include, among others, the drug Zebinix, the All-on-4 method (dentistry), the Multibanco, the Coloradd and the Prepaid mobile phone.\n\nAfter WWII major Portuguese scientific and technical institutions emerged; among them is worth citing the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) an international centre for biomedical research and founded by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation (FCG) in 1961 and ranked as one of the Top Ten best Places for post-docs, by The Scientist – Faculty of 1000.\n\nOther major instituitions include the Champalimaud Foundation, created at the bequest of Portuguese industrialist and entrepreneur, António de Sommer Champalimaud that focuses on the fields of neuroscience and oncology, and the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory in Braga.\n\nDespite its small size, In 2001 Portugal was ranked 28th among countries that contributed to the top 1% of the world's highly cited publications and Portugal was ranked 32nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2022.[621][622]\n\nWithin Europe and the European Union (EU), Portugal has full membership into several pan-European scientific organizations like the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), ITER, and the European Southern Observatory (ESO). Portuguese scientists and technicians work in all of those organizations. In the period 2005–2007, Portugal was the EU member state with the highest growth rate in research and development (R&D) investment as a percentage of the GDP – a 46% growth. Portugal's R&D investment equals 1.2% of Portuguese GDP. This was the 15th largest allocation of funds as a percentage of the GDP for R&D, among the 27 EU member states in 2007.[623]\n\nOverall, the Portuguese contributed in numerous scientific fields.
