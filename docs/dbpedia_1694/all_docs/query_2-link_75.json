        "text": "Djamila Ribeiro is a writer.\n\nHolds a bachelor’s degree in Philosophy and a master’s degree in Political Philosophy from the Federal University of São Paulo.\n\nCoordinates the Plural Feminisms Iniative, which comprises the Plural Feminisms Space, which supports women in social vulnerability; the online platform Plural Feminisms, with online content about antiracism and feminism; and the Book Collection Plural Feminisms, written by black women and men about critical perspectives on gender and race.\n\nShe is the author of “Where We Stand”, published by Yale University Press. Since 2024, she is guest professor at New York University (NYU).\n\nAuthor of “Who’s Afraid of Black Feminism?”, “Short Anti-racist Guide” and “Letters to my Grandmother” (Companhia das Letras), “Transatlantic Diallogue” (Editions Anacaona), with translations into several languages.\n\nShe is an immortal occupant of the chair #28 of the Academy of Literature of São Paulo. Columnist of the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, she was assistant secretary for Human Rights in São Paulo in 2016. She is a laureate of the 2019 Prince Claus Prize, awarded by the Kingdom of the Netherlands and considered by the BBC as one of the 100 Most Influential Women in the World.\n\nIn 2020, she won the Jabuti Award, the most important in Brazilian literature, in the category of Human Sciences, for A Short Anti-racist Guide. In 2021, she was the first Brazilian person in history to be honored by the BET Awards, granted by the USA Black community.\n\nIn 2023, she was laureated with The Franco-German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law.\n\nLoving mother of Thulane Ribeiro.\n\nPROFESSIONAL MEMORIAL\n\nAs coordinator of the editorial initiatives, she has published texts and books by more than 80 Black authors. The label is an independent project that aims to publish Black people, especially women, from Brazil and Latin America, as well as to democratize the knowledge of these social groups, which have been historically invisible.\n\nThe Plural Feminisms Collection is owned by the label and has been publishing critical themes, written by Black people, at an affordable price and accessible language. The small, didactic format of book, distributed at the doors of the cultural launches promoted by the collection broke paradigms in the publishing market and became a roaring success with hundreds of thousands of copies sold.\n\n“Where We Stand” (in Portuguese “Lugar de Fala”) is her the first work published and was released in November 2017. Since its release, it has figured among the best-selling works in all lists of the publishing market. It was in the second best-seller position of the Paraty Literary Fair of 2018, the largest in Brazil, which was considered a historical achievement, since it was an independent editorial label. It is worth mentioning that in 2019, Place of Speech was in the 9th position on FLIP’s list, making a double Best Seller List in consecutive years, another remarkable achievement in the history of Brazilian literature. In addition, it figured in the first position of bestsellers of dozens of literary fairs, such as the Book Fair of Cachoeira (FLICA), Literary Fair of the Peripheries (FLUP), Literary Festival of Porto Alegre, the Pelourinho Book Fair (FLIPELÔ), among many others.\n\nBy the publisher Companhia das Letras, Djamila is the author of three books. The book “Who’s Afraid of Black Feminism?”, published in 2018, gathers her writings in the column she kept for years at the CartaCapital magazine and figures in repeated bestseller lists at bookstores or literary fairs. The texts published in the column have been incorporated in several pedagogical materials for elementary and high schools across the country and are references for anti-racist and feminist debates.\n\nIn November 2019, “Short Anti-racist Guide” was released, her book with the greatest repercussions in the country and which has been on the list of best-selling books in Veja Magazine for more than 80 weeks. The book has 11 chapters on topics such as contemporary racism, Blackness, whiteness, racial violence, culture, desire and affection, and it also brings a glossary of Black authors. In February 2021, Djamila reached the mark of 500 thousand books sold in Brazil.\n\nIn her recent book “Letters to my Grandmother”, Djamila rescues her memories in letters to her grandmother Antonia, telling of her childhood, adolescence and challenges of adult life. Since its release, the book has already appeared on the bestseller list and has had a very touching impact on its readers.\n\nA fifth book called “Transatlantic Dialogues”, which puts together meetings between her and Nadia Yala, a professor at the University of Paris 8, was published in France by Editions Anacaona in 2020 and will be published by Bazar do Tempo in 2024.\n\nWe can say one of her main honors occurred on September 2022, when she was sworn in at the Literary Academy of São Paulo, in chair 28, succeeding the historical and brilliant Brazilian writer Lygia Fagundes Telles. The inauguration ceremony filled the Largo do Arouche building with people from different social places who were involved by the atabaques drumming of Djamila’s terreiro community, which organized the whole party.\n\nShe became the youngest among her contemporary immortal fellows and the second Black woman in history to occupy a chair, following in the footsteps of the writer Ruth Guimarães.\n\nHer books are widely read in undergraduate and graduate course syllabuses. “Where We Stand” alone, for example, according to Google Academics, which measures the bibliometric impact of undergraduate and graduate works in the country, recorded a total of 657 citations in Master’s and Doctoral works in the second half of 2020, and Djamila is “only” an undergraduate and Master from the Federal University of São Paulo.\n\nLines of thousands of people formed at fairs and literary events for autographs where she passed in the country, such as in Salvador, Belém, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Fortaleza, Teresina, Rio Branco, Curitiba, Natal, Bonito, Ribeirão Preto, Bauru, and many others. There has been classroom readings in elementary and high schools with debates and discussion, public school teaching materials, as well as handouts adopted in several private schools, in language schools and used in prestigious entrance exams, such as Fuvest and Unicamp, as well as adopted as a mandatory bibliography of Philosophy at the Federal University of Paraná.\n\nDjamila is the author of more than a dozen prefaces in publishings, one of the first being the preface of “Women, Race and Class,” written by American Black feminist Angela Davis. It was Djamila who contacted her to have the book translated and published in Brazil in 2016. In her career, other prefaces of paramount importance stood out, such as the catalog of the exhibition of the Portuguese multidisciplinary thinker Grada Kilomba at the Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo, about Greek myths interpreted by the decolonial perspective.\n\nDjamila also pens the preface to “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings”, by the American writer Maya Angelou, with a preface also by Oprah Winfrey; the preface to “The Bluest Eye”, by Toni Morrison, the first and only Black woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. The preface to this work stemmed from the TAG Livros book club. Toni Morrison would pass away months later, but she could, still alive, be aware of the work prefaced by Djamila Ribeiro, a fact that brought her a lot of emotion.\n\nOver the years, there have been several international meetings with thinkers from all over the world, such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Achille Mbembe, Ruby Bridges, Kalaf Epalanga, Mamadou Ba, Ruth Gilmore, among others. In 2022, at the Salão Carioca do Livro, Djamila mediated the lecture given by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in a Maracanãzinho stadium crowded by thousands of people who sold out in minutes. The gathering was part of an agenda of meetings between the writers involved in a lot of affection.\n\nDjamila Ribeiro and her editorial work\n\nIn partnership with the publisher Jandaíra, led by publisher Lizandra Magon, Djamila coordinates the Sueli Carneiro Publisher and, as its editor, published “Sueli Carneiro: Writings of a Life”, by the honored Sueli Carneiro. The launch event at SESC Pompéia brought together admirers, the writer’s family and emblematic figures of the Brazilian Black movement. The second published title “Ó Paí Prezada: racismo e sexismo tomando bonde nas penitenciárias femininas”, the master’s dissertation of Carla Akotirene by the Federal University of Bahia.\n\nIn November 2020, the third book of the label: Quilombola Women, which, under the Coordination of Selma Dealdina, brings together eighteen women from different quilombola communities in the country. It is an unprecedented work in the history of the country that had the support of the National Coordination for the Articulation of Rural Black Quilombola Communities (CONAQ). In September 2021, the label released its first translation, the book “Black Power”, by the Trinbagonian and US-based activist Kwame Ture, also known as Stokely Carmichael. The book is prefaced by his son Bokar Ture and was a landmark in the civil rights movement in the twentieth century, being responsible for coining the expression “institutional racism”.\n\nAt the end of 2021, through an open call with support of the entrepreneur Maurício Rocha, “A New History, Made of Stories: Invisible Black Personalities in the History of Brazil” was published. The book, which brings together 16 texts by Black scholars from different parts of Brazil, rescues Black personalities worthy of recognition for their contributions to history.\n\nIn 2022, the book “Quilombola Education: territorialities, knowledge and the struggles for rights”’ was published, which collects texts resulting from the I Virtual National Quilombola Education Day, an event that was a partnership between the University of Brasília (UnB) and CONAQ.\n\nIn the same year, the Okán Dùdù (Black Heart) series was launched, which aims to publish books on African-based religions. The premiere was the book “Axé, the power to accomplish: messages to change your day” by Rodney William.\n\nThe most recent work, released in October 2022, was “The Black resistance to the racial exclusion project – Brazil 200 years (1822-2022)”, organized by Prof. Hélio Santos, who gathered 18 texts by historical figures of the Black movement, such as Kabengele Munanga, Sueli Carneiro, Cida Bento, Ana Maria Gonçalves, among many others, to reflect on the bicentennial of Brazil’s independence from a Black perspective. Djamila Ribeiro published a paper in this work with the title “The urgent democratization of media: a Gasparian approach”.\n\nDjamila Ribeiro and the Plural Feminisms collection\n\nThe Plural Feminisms collection, which is inside Sueli Carneiro’s book seal, has already become an essential collective work for raising awareness among the Brazilian population about antiracist and feminist perspectives, as well as revolutionizing the Brazilian publishing market by expanding the space for the large-scale publication of Black non-fiction productions of theoretical quality and social engagement.\n\nThirteen titles have been published to date, exceeding the mark of 300,000 books sold. They are in the following order: Place of Speech; Mass Incarceration, by Juliana Borges; Empowerment, by Joice Berth; Intersectionality, by Carla Akotirene; Structural Racism, by Silvio Almeida; Recreational Racism, by Adilson Moreira; Cultural Appropriation, by Rodney William; Religious Intolerance, by Sidnei Barreto; Colorism, by Alessandra Devulsky and Transfeminism, by Letícia Nascimento; “Domestic Work”, by Juliana Teixeira; “Hate Speech on Social Networks”, by Luiz valério Trindade, “Racial Quotas”, by Lívia Sant’anna Vaz and “Lesbianity”, by Dedê Fatumma.\n\nThe transformations promoted in Brazil by the editorial work of Djamila Ribeiro have been and will continue to be the object of much historical reflection. From the outset, it should be noted that the hundreds of thousands of books sold are not only an expressive number of the success of the works themselves. According to research by Regina Dalcastagnè, from the university of Djamila Ribeiro, between 1964 and 2014, publications by Black people in major publishers represented only 10% of catalogs.\n\nIn the editorial movement fronted by Djamila, these works also represented a strengthening of the group of Black people in the market, becoming a factor responsible for the significant increase in works published by Black people in the country.\n\n“When Djamila (Ribeiro) quotes Audre Lorde or other incredible Black authors, whether fiction, nonfiction, poetry or theater, publishers go after it,” says Florencia Ferrari, Director of Ubu Publishing in an interview with the newspaper O Globo.\n\nEditorial Work Abroad\n\nDjamila Ribeiro’s editorial work has crossed the Atlantic and established solid roots in Europe. Due to partnerships with publishers in France, Italy and Spain, their articulation has led to translations of the works, so far translated and published in French in Editions Anacaona (Joice Berth, Adilson Moreira, Rodney William, Alessandra Devulsky, Letícia Nascimento and Dedê Fatumma), Spanish (Juliana Borges) and Italian in Capovolte Edizioni (Carla Akotirene and Luiz Valério Trindade).\n\nThe pandemic slowed the going of authors of the Collection to the countries, postponing the arrival of the Black Brazilian intelligentsia in an booming scenario. Between 2019 and early 2020, in France alone there were two long tours and some quick passages through the country. The tours were in partnership with the Accor hotel chain. All events with a full house and presence in important literary festivals. The post-pandemic return was in October 2022, with a tour by Djamila Ribeiro and Rodney William in France, Belgium and Germany. Djamila was about to launch her four books in French, while Pai Rodney became the third author in the Collection to undertake her book launch tour. This particular journey was supported by the Accor chain and the Air France airline.\n\nIn 2022, Djamila Ribeiro was in Italy at the Turin International Book Fair, where she released some of her works in Italian published by Capovolte – in particular the translation of Place of Speech. In 2023, Djamila leaves for a launch tour where she will also feature the translation of the Short Anti-racist Guide and the book Letters to my Grandmother.\n\nDjamila Ribeiro is a member of the Beauvoir Society, which brings together scholars of the thoughts of Simone de Beauvoir, having spoken at two conferences: in Oregon, in the United States, while still an undergraduate student in Philosophy, and in St. Louis, also in the United States, as a Master’s student.

In 2021, she joined L’oreal’s international diversity board in Paris. In 2022, at the invitation of YouTube, she produced with the support of the Investigative Journalism Association (Abraji), the course “Journalism Against Hegemonic: reflections for a new present”, an open course based on the one that she taught at PUC-SP and PUC-RS and that, in just one month, added more than 3 thousand hours of playback, being adopted in several undergraduate programs in communication.\n\nIn her career, has carried out a series of campaigns and specific advertising actions for brands.

Djamila did not receive any fees for this action.\n\nIn 2020, she launched the online platform plural Feminisms courses for audiovisual communication and studies on Black feminism, among other approaches to racial and feminist studies. The day after the launch, she received an invitation from actor Paulo Gustavo to occupy his Instagram page for a month, an unprecedented action in Brazil and, in terms of scale and duration worldwide. The occupation inspired infinite similar actions and from it came the promotion of popular projects in what became known by the hashtag #JuntospelaTransformação. More than 80 projects were supported with training and distribution of signatures for engagement in communities. With the support of presenter Fernanda Gentil, five thousand signatures were distributed to non-governmental organizations.

The events and the space itself have received important support from Ambev. The fields of activity of the space are diverse and new ones are to come, such as the publication of the open call for participation of the Johnnie Walker Fund for support and professionalization of initiatives of Black women entrepreneurs.\n\nWith only eight months of operation, more than a thousand women have already been assisted and countless people have been present at the space’s events. The complete information was summarized in a document handed over to the French Minister of Human Rights, Ms. Catherine Colonna, visiting the Espaço in February 2022.\n\nSão Paulo, February 28, 2023 – Date of publication of her website with biographical information, information and link to book purchase, latest articles, professional schedule and contact info.\n\nLast updated: June 06, 2023.\n\nDjamila Ribeiro PR Team"
