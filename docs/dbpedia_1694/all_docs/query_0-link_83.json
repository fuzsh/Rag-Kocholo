        "text": "The 1453 Ottoman conquest of Constantinople under Sultan Mehmet al-Fatih (the Conqueror, who ruled from 1444-1446 and again from 1451-1481) left a profound impact on Jewish history and genealogy in the region. As I explain in my presentation In the Lands of Osman: Jewish Genealogy in the Former Ottoman Empire, this marked a pivotal moment. The Sultan ordered much of the Jewish community in his realm to relocate to Constantinople, making Istanbul the largest community of Romaniote Jews in the Empire.\n\nIn the generations that followed, while the Romaniote population remained centered in Constantinople, many individuals and families returned to Greece, re-establishing communities in places such as Arta, Chalkida, Ioannina, Larissa, Trikkala, and Volos, and rejoining existing communities like Chania and Corfu.\n\nThe most dramatic demographic shift was still on the horizon: the arrival of the Sepharadim, the Jews of Iberia. While it is widely believed that Sultan Bayezit II (1481-1512), who succeeded his father Mehmet al-Fatih, supposedly stated upon the issuance of the Alhambra Decree:\n\n“You venture to call Ferdinand a wise ruler,” he said to his courtiers, “he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine!”\n\nin actuality, there is no evidence of this and the story likely originated in the mythmaking of the 400th anniversary of the Decree. In 1892, the Jews of the Empire marked the anniversary by honoring the ancestors of Sultan Abdulhamit II (who reigned from 1876 to 1909) for their role in providing sanctuary to the refugees during their time of desperation.\n\nThe truth, as reality often is, is far more complex. It was shaped by a period of cultural development during the 16th and early 17th centuries. Many diverse Jewish communities either migrated or were absorbed into the growing Ottoman Empire. These groups included Italian Jews (Italkim), Sepharadim (1492 refugees), Portuguese/New Christians, Jews from Sicily and Calabria, Jews from the Eastern or Arab world (Mustarabim), as well as the aforementioned Romaniote and Ashkenazi communities. Later, Jews of the Caucasus (Kavkazim), Yemenite Jews (Temanim), and Persian Jews (Parsim) would also be absorbed or emigrate to the Empire. During this time, these disparate communities would come to form a Judeo-Spanish, or Ladino, speaking community in the Ottoman heartland (Balkans, Anatolia, Syria, and the Holy Land) with a shared origin story of 1492.\n\nJewish Genealogy in Greece\n\nPursuing Jewish Genealogy in Greece is rewarding but difficult. Unlike in Christian Europe where a modern civil registration dates to the early 19th century in most cases, civil registration in the Ottoman Empire really only dates to the Hamidian period (1876-1909), with standardization achieved more or less in the early 20th century. In modern Greece, outside of some exceptions, civil registration generally dates from 1925 onward (as per Gregory Kontos of Greek Ancestry). Prior to civil registration, the responsibility of maintaining any records fell on the Jewish community. Unfortunately, many of these archives were lost, destroyed, or fragmented during the Nazi Occupation or, in the case of Salonika, heavily damaged in the Great Fire of 1917.\n\nJewish genealogy in Greece can appear positively daunting. However, a lot more exists and is just waiting to be uncovered in your journey. Many communities have manuscripts or archives that have survived in places like the Jewish Museum in Athens, the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki, the Central Archive for the History of the Jewish People (CAHJP), Yad Ben Zvi, or countless libraries and private archives globally. Additionally there are the Ottoman Archives in Turkey and the State Archives System of Greece, both of which hold extensive documentation of Jewish history in Greece, spanning from the 15th century to the present day. There are also secondary archives like the Alliance Israélite Universelle in Paris, diplomatic archives all across Europe, and, of course, records and documents produced by individuals from the communities globally that record names and information seemingly lost over time. Finally, DNA testing for genealogy (Y-DNA, Mitochondrial DNA, and Autosomal DNA) which can reconnect families and strengthen construction of family trees where the documentation no longer exists or is heavily fragmented.\n\nIn the next section, I'll dive into a fascinating case study utilizing my own family history to demonstrate the incredible potential of working with diverse archives, languages, and data sources in Greece.\n\nThe Mijan Family of Larissa\n\nIn order to grasp the full scope of this research journey, we must begin at the beginning. As a teenager, my great-uncle Morris told me that his mother, my great-grandmother Rebecca Angel, was born in Larissa, Greece. She was the only daughter of her mother, Mazaltov Mijan, and third child of her father, Moise Angel (whose family I will discuss in a future article about Jewish Genealogy in Greece). Rebecca, as I would come to discover, was named for her father’s first wife, Rebecca Sami, who had passed away. Mazaltov and Rebecca arrived in America on August 21, 1910 aboard the Martha Washington. Their arrival contact was their brother-in-law and uncle, respectively, Moise Kabeli.\n\nIn today's world, digital technologies are advancing at an increasing rate. As computer processors and chips become more powerful and programs are developed to take advantage of their increased speed and power, the possibilities are endless. With these technologies, advances in heritage and genealogy have been made that were unimaginable even twenty years ago.From being able to digitize and create 3D models using a digital camera or even an iPad, to teaching computers how to read centuries-old handwritten documents and make them searchable (such as with programs like Tranksribus), digital technology offers a whole new world in which to engage with personal and built heritage.\n\nDespite the incredible advances these digital technologies have given us, there is also a darker side that threatens to make our ancestors nothing more than marionettes dancing on a computer screen . In recent years, several companies have started to provide services that enable them to record individuals and use artificial intelligence to develop an avatar that can interact with users and \"learn” to converse. Other companies have used AI to make a photograph into an animated video that follows a pre-programmed series of movements, making it seem as if the person is in front of you and glancing all around as they wait for their portrait to be taken. When one looks at a single such animation in isolation, it may seem lifelike. However, if you consider the infinite number of photographs, each of which repeats the same, mindless series of mechanical movements, it becomes deeply unnerving. When these programs use artificial intelligence to assign a procedurally generated voice to an ancestor, it becomes even more disturbing.\n\nThis is not meant to target any particular brand or company, but rather to highlight a trend that has gained momentum in recent years. I genuinely believe that these programs are developed in response to what companies perceive the market to want. And in fact, some people do find it intriguing and even thrilling to watch AI turn our ancestors from static portraits into versions that appear to come to life on our screens.\n\nI am here to make the case for Heritage.\n\nThe late historian David Lowenthal writes in his 2005 article “Natural and cultural heritage” that “Heritage denotes everything we suppose has been handed down to us from the past.” The image above of a family looking through an old photo album exemplifies this concept in a tangible way. The very act of holding family heirlooms such as this in your hands is itself an heirloom, an act which has been passed down from generation to generation. And although we may never have met the people in the albums, they played a significant role in the lives of our ancestors and in their world. In these images, we see the faces of our ancestors and their families long after they have passed into dust, and we discover anew in our time little bits and pieces of their world through their photos, albums, diaries, manuscripts, and documents.\n\nFor me, heritage is about how we engage with the past and how we tell the stories of those who came before us to the generations yet to come. The past is never dead; it lives on in all of us. There is something vital and timeless about this idea in that, even after our ancestors and loved ones are gone, we are able to keep their memories and stories alive by passing them on to the next generation. So it should come as no surprise that I believe that using AI to recreate their voices, alter their images, or recreate their thoughts would serve instead to remove their souls and voices and replace them with cheap imitations. It is the ultimate nihilistic conclusion to the processes of collecting names that can occur in the course of genealogy. My late great uncle told me a story of my great-great-grandfather; When my great-great grandfather asked him if he would come to America, my great great great grandfather replied that no, he wouldn’t because “the stones were too uncivilized”.\n\nTo me, using AI to recreate their voices, their images, or their thoughts removes our ancestors’ souls and their voices and in fact is the ultimate, nihilistic end of name collecting that can so often be a part of genealogy and heritage. My great-great grandfather, as told to me by my late great-uncle, is reputed to have told my great-grandfather when asked if he would come to America, that no, he wouldn’t because the stones were “too uncivilized”.\n\nI don’t want a computer to approximate their voices and likenesses and have them repeat that story at me. I want that story to be passed down and become embellished and mythified. What makes genealogy so meaningful is that exploring the past through the micro-histories of our families and their journeys allows us to see the world for all of its complexity. We see that our ancestors were people like us, with hopes and dreams, with mistakes and failings. That they aren’t puppets guided by a computer’s idea of their humanity, but rather that they were individuals, with souls and their own unique voices, that time leaves bits and pieces to be passed down to us.\n\nThis is the story of a man, a Portuguese Jew living in Amsterdam who left only a fleeting trace on the world other than his bones buried in the Portuguese Jewish Beth Ahaim (House of Life) at Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, just outside of Amsterdam. There is almost nothing known about this man beyond an epitaph and a few ephemeral documents. Yet the precious few clues that remain tell a rather remarkable story of just how similar our world today is to the one he once inhabited in the 17th century.\n\nPeople are people.\n\nOn March 29, 1662, a 70-year old man named Abraham Vaes testified in Amsterdam in front of notary Hector Friesma. Alongside him also appeared 26-year old Eliau de Liaõ and 23-year old Eliza Israel. All three were testifying about a certain incident they had witnessed in the “op Vloijenburgh” (the Vlooienburg island, where the early Jewish community was centered in Amsterdam. In the 19th century, it was connected to the neighboring island, where the Portuguese Synagogue is today). But who was Abraham Vaes?\n\n(Before I continue with the story, I must give you the disclaimer that the name is spelled multiple different ways, depending on who was recording it, but it’s all the same name. So you will see Vaes, Vas, and Vaz in this and all of them are correct.)\n\nThe 1910 census is much the same, except for a tragic note beside Kate’s name. This is the last census in which women were asked the delicate questions of “how many children have you given birth to?” and “how many are now living?” (something that would be unthinkable for the census to ask today). Kate’s answer to the former is fourteen, and the latter is eight, meaning that she had lost two children since 1900 in addition to having her youngest daughter. Jacob, Louis, Harry, Solomon, and Fannie are all at home. Louis, at 14 years old, is no longer in school but working as an office boy. His two older brothers are also working; only Solomon and Fannie are in school.\n\nSo then the question: how did this young man die?\n\nI finally found a death certificate for one Samuel Schreiber, dated for the same date on the grave, a naval enlistee who died in the naval hospital in Great Lakes, Illinois- the location of the navy’s only boot camp. His body was shipped back to New York. No parents were given on the death certificate. And yet, I was sure that this was Solomon. So I pulled the WWI Naval Casualties record. Even though he did not die at war, or even graduate boot camp, he would be there. This gave me a next of kin: a John Schreiber in Freehold, New Jersey. Looking at Solomon’s siblings, Jacob was the most likely candidate to anglicize to John, and I had the name of his wife. And sure enough, on the 1920 census, he is living in Freehold. Over the years, he alternates between Jacob, John, and Jack. But this was a solid confirmation that Samuel Schreiber and Solomon Schreiber were one and the same.\n\nHe, too, was far away from home when he became ill in a pandemic. I survived, he did not. 102 years separated our respective illnesses; he, from the Spanish Flu, me, from COVID-19. And while I can only imagine how he felt in that hospital in Illinois, over 800 miles from home, I think I know a little bit. That fear that you will never see your mother again, never hug your siblings. That every time you close your eyes, you might not wake up. The shivering from fever, the gasping for air. Every hacking cough that feels like your chest is going to crack. And that deep, eternal fear that something terrible is lurking around the corner, and the profound loneliness of going through it all without a familiar face or hand to hold.\n\nI wonder about Kate, and how she handled her youngest son dying so far away from home. One look at this grave tells you how deeply this young man was loved. His family was not wealthy, but his grave is beautiful, designed with care. From the American flag on the upper left to the phrase “my beloved son and our dear brother”, every bit of it is designed with care. For a family that would not have had much money, they scraped it together and ensured that Solomon would have a fitting grave.\n\nKate would lose another child the following year in the same pandemic – Solomon’s older sister, Ida, a 39-year-old married mother of ten children. Ida’s eleventh and youngest child, a boy named Samuel in English but Solomon in Hebrew for his uncle, had died at only four months old that May. Kate herself would die a decade after her son at 70 years old.\n\nDespite him having many nieces and nephews, and they most likely having innumerable descendants of their own, it seems that Solomon is all but forgotten. The only online trees that have his name in them do not record his death- he simply vanishes. His grave does not have perpetual care, and so, when I returned to Mt. Zion in August after recovering from my own illness, the walk to Solomon’s grave was impassible- unlike my November visit, the snow had not yet cleared the weeds. I was able to walk on the path behind him, though, and leave a stone on his grave.\n\nI do not want to be the only person to remember him, the boy with the beautiful grave, and so I bring his story to you- a story befitting of pandemic times of a young man, the New York-born son of immigrants, who joined the navy and died too young of the Spanish Flu, so far away from home.\n\nMay his memory be a blessing.\n\nMost of the Jewish population of Spain fled with the Expulsion in 1492. Some went to North Africa, some went to the Levant, some went to the rising Ottoman Empire, and some went to the city-states of the Italian Peninsula. However, many went across the border into Portugal. Gregório’s parents and grandparents likely may have been amongst these refugees, crossing the border from Spain into Portugal.\n\nThe sea journey was dangerous and replete with rumors and news of pirates kidnapping Jewish refugees and holding them for a king’s ransom, or even selling them into slavery. Many of the Jews in newly unified Spain, instead, went to Portugal, believing that while times were difficult, the Alhambra Decree would soon be rescinded. Maria José Pimenta Ferro Tavares in their authoritative work, Os Judeus em Portugal No Seculo XV (The Jews in Portugal in the 15th Century), estimates the number of Jews in Portugal in 1496 at a maximum of 30,000 people based on the sisão poll tax collected that year. This is where our story truly begins.\n\nIn 1496, in order to marry the daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, King Manuel I of Portugal had to extend the Alhambra Decree to his domain as part of the dowry agreement. King Manuel, of course, was not interested in expelling a large part of his population. Instead, he enacted the decree but forcibly baptized all of his Jewish subjects in 1496 and 1497 to Catholicism and thus, as new converts to the faith, they were not allowed to leave Portugal. In Spain, the Inquisition had already been active for almost 20 years, but a grace period had been instituted – no Inquisition was established for these new converts, now called the Cristãos Novos (the New Christians). This only formally ended with the establishment of the Inquisition in Portugal, 40 years later.\n\nBecause there wasn’t a formal Inquisition, there was no formal mechanism for prosecuting heretics and ensuring adherence to Catholicism. As a result, a distinct and enduring Crypto-Judaism developed among the New Christians. Furthermore, even though the forced baptism was meant to assimilate the New Christians by making them indistinguishable from the Old Christians in name, discrimination by Old Christians and preferences among New Christians to stay within trusted networks led to lasting divisions between the two communities.\n\nIn Spain and Portugal, in order to enter into society for powerful positions, usually one had to prove that one was of “Pure, undirtied Iberian blood” (Christian). The so-called limpieza de sangre (in Spanish)/limpeza de sangue (in Portuguese), required the person to testify as to their genealogy through their grandparents and show that they were neither of Muslim nor Jewish blood. These genealogies, while often true, could just as easily be falsified. In many cases, these genealogical examinations could go even deeper.\n\nBy Caitlin Hollander\n\nA 47-year-old leather importer and his wife arrived in New York City on a business trip. Most likely exhausted from the long journey from Mexico, they checked into a midtown hotel where the businessman noticed that he had a headache. He took some medication and went to sleep, probably thinking it little more than a side effect of the stress of the trip. But he started to feel worse and after developing worrying symptoms, went to the hospital. They transferred him to another hospital, one more able to handle a potentially contagious condition. There, he was determined to be having an adverse reaction to the headache medication he had taken - nothing serious. The appropriate medication was administered; yet, his symptoms worsened. After 8 days in New York City, he was dead. The cause of death was ruled “erythema multiforme with laryngotracheobronchitis and bronchopneumonia” - essentially, the allergic reaction plus bronchitis and pneumonia.\n\nThen, two patients who had also been in the hospital at the same time as the businessman became ill with the same symptoms:, a young man in his 20s and an infant. Both had already been discharged and returned home to their families. More tests were performed - after all, allergic reactions are not contagious - and it was discovered that they had something far worse than anyone had imagined.\n\nSmallpox\n\nThe year was 1947. Eugene LaBar was the first smallpox fatality in New York City in 35 years. The two additional patients had gone home to crowded apartments; it would be discovered later that the young man, Ismael Acosta, had infected his wife, Carmen, who would be the second fatality in this outbreak. Carmen Acosta was 27 years old, eight months pregnant, and the last person to die of smallpox in New York City.\n\nEver\n\nAccording to Dr. Weinstein’s writeup after the fact (which I have included at the end of this article), smallpox was officially confirmed in Ismael Acosta on April 4th; nearly a month after LaBar’s death on March 10th. Immediately, the Health Department sprang into action. The laboratories producing the vaccination began working 24 hours a day. 179 city buildings were used for vaccination stations:schools, hospitals, police and fire stations. Hundreds of thousands of doses were sent by the army and navy. Mayor O’Dwyer was among the first to be vaccinated, and even President Truman was vaccinated in order to give a speech in New York City. To quote Dr. Weinstein:\n\n“In a period of less than a month, 6,350,000 people were vaccinated in New York City, over 5,000,000 of them within the two week period following the appeal for universal vaccination by the Mayor. Never before had so many people been vaccinated in such a city and on such short notice.”\n\nThe task was monumental. But somehow, when the city was declared smallpox-free in mid-April, only 12 people had been made ill and only two had died. To contrast, in a 1945 outbreak in Puget Sound, Washington, 65 people caught smallpox and 20 died. Again, to quote Dr. Weinstein:\n\n“During the period 1900 to 1929, epidemics of virulent smallpox were reported throughout the United States. Notable among these were the outbreaks in 1921 in Denver and Kansas City, when the former city reported 924 cases and 37 deaths, and the latter 943 cases and 160 deaths. In 1924, Detroit reported 1,610 cases and 163 deaths. In 1901, an epidemic of smallpox in New York City resulted in 1,959 cases and 410 deaths. Had the same rate prevailed in the 1947 outbreak, there would have been 4,310 cases and 902 deaths.”\n\nTo give an idea of the magnitude of this achievement, in 1972 there was a smallpox outbreak in what was then Yugoslavia. 175 people would be infected, and 35 would die. This was a fraction of what happened in New York City a quarter of a century before. One would think that Israel Weinstein’s name would be shouted from the rooftops, that there would be schools, hospitals, and streets named after him. But there are not.\n\nBoth Lucy and Rose had been born to immigrant parents. Both women lost their American citizenship due to teenaged marriages to men substantially older than them — Rose Feldman was only 17 at the time of her marriage to 23-year-old Charles Glickstein, and Lucy DeFalco’s husband was 19, six years her senior. This was not the case with Sarah Shevak, nee Weinberg, who applied for United States citizenship in that same court in Newark. She was only two months younger than her husband Solomon, who had been born in what is now Belarus. Sarah had been born in Manhattan; her father, Isaac, had been born there as well, and her mother, Zillie, was born in Pennsylvania. And yet at 63 years of age, this second generation American was not technically a US citizen, despite her grandparents coming to the US over a century before her 1950 citizenship application.\n\nThe law that stripped these women — most of whom who had never left the United States — of their citizenship had been enacted on March 2, 1907 as part of the Expatriation Act. As a result of their loss of citizenship, these women could be subject to deportation. Many were forced to register as enemy aliens during WWI and WWII. 12 years after this law was enacted, another implication was discovered — despite the nineteenth amendment granting women the right to vote, women like Sarah Shevak would not have been able to, despite being born in the United States. And even when the law was technically repealed in 1922 as a part of the Cable Act, women married to aliens “ineligible for citizenship” (typically used to refer to Asians but also to draft dodgers or those who had deserted the US military) still lost their American citizenship upon marriage, as did women who married a non-citizen and then lived abroad for two years.\n\nAt its core, the law was deeply sexist and xenophobic; similar to arguments against the female vote, arguments against women retaining their US citizenship upon marriage to a noncitizen husband centered around the idea that women could not have loyalties or opinions separate from the husbands. In fact, these laws took that idea one step further, tethering a woman’s identity to her husband’s. Even when the husband’s country of origin did not offer reciprocal citizenship to his wife upon marriage, she would lose her citizenship, rendering her stateless. Tying a woman’s citizenship to her husband’s also meant that if he did not wish to naturalize, she had no path to citizenship — a married woman could not file for citizenship on her own account. Even if she was estranged from her husband, the courts would require a divorce before she could pursue citizenship.\n\nTo further complicate the matter, divorce laws of the era were notoriously strict, and in some states, a non-citizen could not file for divorce — effectively holding non-citizen women hostage to their estranged husbands. Even though women’s citizenships became their own — in most cases — following the passage of the Cable Act in 1922, it was not until 1931 that no woman lost her citizenship upon marriage (even if her husband was ineligible for citizenship) and then finally only 1936 that these women were given a path to regain their citizenship — and even then, only if the marriage itself had ended either through death or divorce.\n\nFinally, in 1940, Congress passed a law allowing even married women to regain their lost citizenships — 33 years after they had declared that women had no right to their own nationality independent of their husbands, 18 years after they had declared that only some women had that right depending on who they had married, 9 years after they had declared that all women would retain their citizenships upon marriages, and 4 years after they had declared that the women stripped of their citizenship could regain it regardless of their marital status.\n\nThis era of American history — spanning 33 years from its inception to end — is rarely spoken about or taught today. It is little known, even in genealogical circles. And yet, these petitions for repatriation continued long into living memory. In December 1969, a 79 year old widow named Lillian Weber took her oath of citizenship. She was 5’3 and 130lbs with grey hair and brown eyes, the mother of two grown sons — and like Sarah, Rose, and Lucy had been born in America.\n\nFurther reading: https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1998/summer/women-and-naturalization-1.html\n\nProblem solved, right? “Was my ancestor Sephardic?” could be answered by this expert list, stating conclusively that your family’s surname had belonged to known Sephardic communities.\n\nHowever, there was one slight issue: that list was fraudulent and a poor copy of indexing work done by the late Harry Stein, who didn’t claim that all of the surnames he indexed were belonging to Sephardic families; just that the books he consulted on Sephardic genealogy and history, had some kind of reference to the surname. Furthermore, not all of the surnames he indexed even belonged to Jews or were in exclusive use by Jews.\n\nIn genealogy, history, anthropology, and archaeology, it is always critical to ask questions of the sources you are reading, even if it is a primary source.\n\nUnfortunately, because of lists like that, myths perpetuated by heritage tourism (“Jews forced to convert took the names of fruit trees, Catholic themes, and plants in order to ‘hide’” being one such popular legend routinely sold by tour guides and books in Spain and Portugal), and, quite frankly, inadequate teaching about the history of Sephardic Jewry, a lot of confusion exists today about Sephardic genealogy and history. With this series on Sephardic genealogy and history, I hope to shed some light and encourage people to ask questions about the past in order to better understand the present and future.\n\nSo, what is a ‘Sephardic surname’? To put it simply, it is any surname used by someone in the Sephardic community. For the purposes of this series, I will be using the term Sephardic, exclusively meaning those with a genealogical tie to expulsees and conversos/New Christians, as well as those who joined later on. This does not necessarily include other Jewish populations who follow Sephardic traditions and approaches to Jewish law and identify as Sephardim/pan-Sephardim as well, who do not have a genealogical connection.\n\nUnlike most other Jewish communities, surnames have a longstanding usage and tradition amongst Sephardic Jews. In the Iberian peninsula, surnames began being used in the 10th century CE, reaching popular usage by the 15th century. Jews in the Peninsula, like Catholics and Muslims, took to this new tradition readily and thus, the tradition of familial surnames predated the end of Iberian Jewry. Famous surnames like Abarbanel, Benveniste, Zacuto, ibn Yahya, and Palache could be found amongst Iberian Jews in the centuries preceding the persecutions, Expulsion, and forced conversion.\n\nSo, to return to the original question, “What is a Sephardic Surname?”\n\nThere are two main categories of surnames:\n\nPre-Expulsion Surnames\n\nThese surnames could be toponyms (names related to the place), Arabic names, occupations, Hebrew names, and more. Some pre-expulsion surnames include:\n\nAbarbanel, Abensur, Aboab, Almosnino, Alsheikh, Altaras, Amarillo, Barzilay, Benaroya, Benatar, Benbassat, Bendalec, Ben Ghiat, Bensousan, Benveniste, Faraggi, Franco, Haleva, Herrera, Marcos, Nahmias, Palache, Pardo, Pesso, Policar, Saporta, Saltiel, Senior, Sion, Toledano, Valensi, Zacuto\n\nWhat’s important is that New Christian surnames are indistinguishable from non-Jewish, Old Christian surnames because they are the same. Furthermore, you can have innumerable combinations of names, including siblings with different surnames entirely, as long as the family names existed within the recent genealogy of the family. In my own research, I have a set of siblings born in Viseu, Portugal, and Bayonne and Bordeaux, France who moved to Amsterdam, London, Barbados, and possibly Newport, Rhode Island that have the surnames Mendes, Mendes Sereno/Serrano, and Nunes Mantensa. All the same generation!\n\nSome examples of double surnames found among Portuguese Jews include:\n\nAboab da Fonseca, Franco da Costa, Franco Mendes, Gomes da Costa, Henriques Nunes, Lopes Pereira, Mendes da Costa, Mendes Seixas, Nunes Vaz, Rodrigues Pereira, Pardo Roques, Sarfaty Pina, Vaz Dias, Vaz Lopes, Vaz Nunes, Vaz Villareal\n\nTo sum it up, Sephardic surnames have a long and storied history. Many family names are ancient and have deep roots in Sephardic genealogy and history. Yet, the appearance of a surname in your genealogy that was used by a Sephardic family in the past and today is not an indication of an actual Sephardic genealogy and connection. Each case must be studied critically, understanding all of the data points including communities, oral histories, archives, and genetics. In my own family, we discovered that our surname’s origin lies not in a creation of Dutch Ashkenazim for the Napoleonic surname registration in 1811, but is actually a Dutchification of a Portuguese surname, Vaz, uncovering a previously forgotten and unknown history of a family that became Ashkenazi in the mid-18th century in Amsterdam. This story was only uncovered due to a deep study of YDNA and the archives of Amsterdam.\n\nIf you think you have Sephardic heritage, please feel free to reach out to us and we will be happy to provide a consult and develop a plan for researching your ancestral past. For an amazing further resource on Sephardic surnames, please see the excellent Dicionário sefaradi de sobrenomes by Guilherme Faiguenboim, Paulo Valadares, and Anna Rosa Campagnano, which gives an extensive list of documented surnames of Sephardic Jews and the communities they came from across the world, including archival sources. In the next blog in this series, I will discuss more on who the New Christians were, their genealogies, and their impact on Sephardic history.\n\nBy Caitlin Hollander\n\nSo, having read Part 1, you may now be asking a few questions:\n\nWhen did my family name change?\n\nWhy was I told it was changed at Ellis Island?\n\nYou might even be asking the question I ask when I encounter this:\n\nWhy did these name changes happen?\n\nAs much of the immigrant experience, especially the Jewish immigrant experience, is centered around New York, many of my answers and much of my reasoning will also revolve around New York. So, while the reasons and general social attitudes I cite may be ubiquitous to the Jewish experience, the mechanisms by which the name changes occurred are not. In New York, there were a few routes to legally change one’s name. First, as I explained in part 1, one could change their name during the naturalization process (as my own great grandfather did). Secondly, one could change their name through a legal process: either through the county clerk of where the person resided or through New York Civil Court. Or thirdly, one could change their name by simply using the new name in everyday use. To this day, as long as the intent is not to defraud or present oneself falsely, someone in New York still has the right to adopt any name they like without legal procedure.\n\nThis last option was extremely common, especially among poorer immigrants around the turn of the century. Why go through the time, expense, and complication of a lawyer and court when one could simply wake up and decide “now I am John Smith”? The second most common would be through naturalization; a convenient thing for genealogists, where the name changes are noted on a document that is typically easily obtained. The final route, through a court order, is the most interesting for our purposes, as these name changers had to provide reasoning as to why their name needed to be changed.\n\nWhile researching for her fantastic book (which I highly recommend), A Rosenberg by Any Other Name: A History of Jewish Name Changing in America, Kirsten Fermaglich pulled a large number of name change applications from the courts in New York City. As these records are fairly accessible for me, I decided to do the same. And as she did, I found a wide variety of reasons. Many were to simplify a name; they cited that no one could spell or pronounce it (as was the case with the Lucivjansky family, originally from Slovakia, in 1950; their name was changed to Lawson). But, in many cases, they cited that the name was an obstacle to employment prospects- a reflection of antisemitism. I saw this reason cited by Isidore Abramowitz in 1913; he became Theodore Arnold; the same with Carl Abrahamson, later Carl Auderson, a year later in 1914. This reason was, I suspect, an unstated motivation behind many of the changes I saw; David Lubitz to Gerald Lloyd, the Levy family to Leyson, Hyman Lifschitz to Hal Leeds, Morris Goldberg to Morris Gilbert. Want ads of the era appear to support this; many state that they are a “Christian company”, or outright state “Christian preferred”. Meanwhile, help wanted ads from the same time period that mention Jewishness seem to do so almost apologetically; stating that the family seeking to hire a cook needs one who understands kashrut, or that the hospital seeking a social worker is a Jewish one.\n\nA marked difference can be seen in this pair of ads that appeared beside each other in the March 5, 1920 edition of the New York Herald; the former is seeking a young man to make himself “generally useful” in the office of a large manufacturing firm, and proudly states that they are a Christian company. The latter seeks a young man to work nights in an office and states that he must be “good at figures, willing worker, understanding Jewish [Yiddish]”. The former ad all but outright states that they are seeking a Christian employee; the latter, simply an employee who understands the language. Even in these cases, in which the desire for a Christian employee is not outright stated, it is understood. And so, one can easily picture Hyman Lifschitz becoming Hal Leeds for further economic opportunity, especially as he rose in the white collar world. Similarly, prestigious educational institutions practiced widespread, well-known discrimination against Jews; Emory University Dental is well known for this practice continuing into the 1960s, and Harvard had a famous quota on Jewish students. In the professional world or for those seeking to rise into it, a surname indicating Jewishness could serve as a significant handicap.\n\nBut don’t simply take my word for it. In February 1948, an anonymous Jewish American published an article in the Atlantic Monthly (now The Atlantic) entitled “I Changed My Name”. He describes the reasons why he and his brother changed from their birth surname, which he describes as “forthrightly Jewish”, to a name he describes as “both neutral and euphonious”. Citing a lack of religiousness, a lack of connection to his Jewish heritage, and a desire for safety (one that was paramount in the minds of Jews everywhere after the Shoah) he says:\n\n“I just wanted to fool them [antisemites] into the impression that I was human”.\n\nAt the same time, though, you see many examples of a name remaining “Jewish”, but simplified in a way to make pronunciation and spelling easier for people in America. Louis Cohen in 1915 became Louis Diamond, Nachum Churelutszky to Nathan Cohen, Rubin Lupchansky to Rubin Lubin and Abraham Chait to Abraham Friedman in 1913. The motivation was not always a reaction to antisemitism, but often (as stated in the petitions) one of simplification. This is also often the case in the only situation that can be found where names were indeed consistently changed for an immigrant- in schools. Even today, international students will often be pressured to use an “American” name that is easier for teachers and peers to pronounce.\n\nSometimes, this name change happened before even boarding the ship to America; if one had a brother, husband, or uncle in America who had already gone from Rabinowitz to Robins (as David Rabinowitz of New York did in 1921), the immigrant would often adopt this new, shortened name before even boarding the ship. This is why you often see a husband immigrate under one surname, and his wife arrive a year later with their children under the new, shortened name.\n\nSo now for the biggest question: If all of this is true, then why was I told that my ancestor had his or her name changed at Ellis Island? Was I lied to?\n\nThe answer is, as most answers are, not so straightforward. There are many elements at play; The idea of the name change at Ellis Island is deeply ingrained in American culture from movies such as The Godfather Part II. That image of Ellis Island being the place where name changes occurred permeates our culture – it is why this myth is so pervasive. Ellis Island was often a shorthand for “when we immigrated”; immigrants who did not pass through Ellis Island would often use it as shorthand, even when different ports and even different cities were at play. Often their descendants are shocked when I find a missing passenger manifest that reveals their ancestors entered not through Ellis, but through Boston, San Francisco, Tampa, New Orleans, Galveston, or even into a Canadian port followed by a land border crossing.\n\nAs for the idea that “the name was changed for us,” this too comes from a mix of causes. There is, at its essence, an element of shame. In April 1948, a writer named David Cohen responded in the Atlantic Monthly to Anonymous's aforementioned article with one of his own, entitled “I’ve Kept My Name”. He states, in his first sentence, what the examples above showed so well “The most frequent reason for name-changing among Jews is to get jobs in areas where there is marked economic discrimination against them.” But he answers Anonymous’s reasoning with defiance, stating:\n\n“Bearing an unmistakably Jewish name, I am spared the crude comments of virulent anti-Semites, for even they retain a modicum of manners in my presence; and, there being no possibility of mistake, I am not asked to join groups that do not \"take\" Jews. I am accepted by my fellows as a human being, or I am rejected as a Jew.”\n\nThis attitude towards name changing, especially in the Jewish world, grew over time with the counterculture and anti-assimilation movements seen in the 1960s and 1970s and beyond. Attitudes changed too, as laws were created to forbid discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and religion. No longer was a “Jewish name” as much of a social handicap; and when something is not currently a threat, we have a harder time imagining a world where it could be one. And so people, aware that their name had changed at some point, invented a reason why. It could not be their ancestor, after all, they were proudly Jewish, but must be some powerful antisemitic, xenophobic entity.\n\nAnd so the image of the callous Ellis Island inspector, changing the names of poor immigrants without a thought to their heritage, was born, whitewashing a world in which that proudly Jewish immigrant must change his or her name from Horowitz to Harris, from Goldberg to Gilbert, not out of shame of who they were, but as a strategy to survive and thrive in their new home.\n\nBy Caitlin Hollander\n\nThere is a joke that I am almost required to begin this with- and so I will, because I cannot resist a joke, especially not one so well-worn as this:\n\nA Jewish man arrives at Ellis Island. He has been told by his brother, who is already in America, that one should take a new name for their new country. He thinks and thinks, and finally settles on Sam Cohen- it is American, but still Jewish.\n\nPleased by his choice, he begins his walk up massive flights of stairs carrying his heavy bags. He runs his new name through his head as he walks, committing it to memory. He finally reaches the top of the stairs and is overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle. An immigration officer barks out to him, “NAME?”\n\nThe Jew is caught off guard, and flustered, replies “Shoyn fargesin” (“I’ve already forgotten” in Yiddish).\n\nAnd so the immigration official dutifully writes down his answer, and Sean Ferguson begins his life in America.\n\nWe know this scene very well- it’s ingrained in our culture from movies like The Godfather Part II to jokes like the one I related above. Likewise, we are told by our grandparents “oh, the name was changed at Ellis Island”. And at first glance, it seems to be true- from mobsters (Meyer Lansky was born Meier Suchowlanski) to actors (Jack Benny was Benjamin Kubelsky), everyone seems to have come to America with a different name. This story is an accepted part of the early 20th century immigrant experience- that immigration officials changed the names of immigrants due to racism, misunderstandings, an attempt to “Americanize”, or simply because they did not care.\n\nBut none of it is true- simply put, it is one of the greatest urban legends ingrained in the modern American psyche. The commonly given reasons behind these supposed name changes do not hold up to the historical facts of immigration through Ellis Island.\n\nThe names recorded at Ellis Island were taken directly from the passenger manifests, which were made up at the port of departure. In addition, Ellis Island employed a number of interpreters who spoke the immigrants’ native languages. In 1911, Commissioner William Williams wrote to Washington, providing both the number of interpreters for each language and asking for funding to hire more.\n\n“Languages known by interpreters: Arabic (2), Albanian (2), Armenian (2), Bohemian Czech (4), Bosnian (1), Bulgarian (5), Croatian (7), Dalmatian (2), Danish (2), Dutch (1), Finnish (1), Flemish (1), French (14), German (14), Greek (8), Herzegovinian (1), Italian (11), Lithuanian (2), Macedonian (1), Hungarian (4), Montenegrin (4), Moravian Czech (1), Norwegian (2), Persian (1), Polish (6), Portuguese (1), Rumanian (4), Russian (6), Ruthenian (4), Serbian (6), Slovak (7), Slovenian (2), Spanish (2), Swedish (3), Turkish (6), and Yiddish (9).”\n\nAnd in 1914, the chief medical officer, Dr. L.L. Williams wrote to Washington describing his requirements for new interpreters:\n\n“The languages with which they should be familiar are named below in the order of their importance, viz.: Italian, Polish, Yiddish and German, Greek, Russian, Croatian and Slovenian, Lithuanian, Ruthenian and Hungarian. Each of the five interpreters should be able to speak at least two of the languages named and it is very desirable that all of those named should be spoken by the fine interpreters collectively, if practicable.\n\nIn addition to these languages, knowledge of Portuguese, Spanish, French, Turkish and Syrian, and Scandinavian languages would increase the usefulness of any of the candidates.”\n\nIn short, especially for Jewish immigrants, there was absolutely someone at the port of entry who not only spoke their language but were specifically assigned to interpret for them- often immigrants or children of immigrants themselves. In addition, the manifests were made up at the port of departure, not at the port of entry, and the names were copied down directly from said original manifests- not written down by a clerk at the port of entry.\n\nBut a more practical barrier existed to a permanent name change being made at Ellis Island in the early 20th century, and one that we do not think of in the age of digitization. Once you left Ellis Island, there was nothing indicated what name you had entered under, at least nothing that would matter in your day to day life. Depending on the era in which they had come to America, the immigrant might never see what name they had entered under. Alien Registration Forms were only created in 1940. Even when applying for citizenship, you provided first, the name you went by and second, the name under which you entered the US (as seen in the petition for naturalization above). The assumption was that the former was now your legal name. After 1906, when nationwide standardization of the process was instituted, you had to simply provide affidavits from witnesses that had known you in the US for 5 years- later on, proofs of arrival were included in petitions for naturalization, but this part of the process was only slowly adapted. And no ID existed at the time for a job, school, or housing to require. If the immigrant from the joke at the beginning of this article walked out of Ellis Island and introduced himself as Sam Cohen, no one would stop him- because who would know?\n\nPart 2 of this blog post will give examples of situations in which immigrants’ names were changed, and discuss why this myth became so prevalent in the collective American consciousness\n\nFurther reading:\n\nhttps://www.uscis.gov/history-and-genealogy/genealogy/immigrant-name-changes\n\nhttps://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/07/02/name-changes-ellis-island\n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/ask-smithsonian-did-ellis-island-officials-really-change-names-immigrants-180961544/"
