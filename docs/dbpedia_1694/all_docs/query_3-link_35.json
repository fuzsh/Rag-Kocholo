        "text": "Who is Ariel Castro?\n\nJos&eacute; Ariel Castro is a Brazilian professor and was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1937. He graduated in Modern Languages (1959) and completed his formal post-graduation studies at the level of specialization, master degree and PhD in Portuguese language at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro - UFRJ (1968-1974). For his PhD he attended also at the same time several courses under the guidance of the Emeritus Professor Kurt Baldinger at the Neuphilologische Fakult&auml;t of the University of Heidelberg, where Baldinger had been the last Rektor. Later on he accomplished a post-doctorate in Linguistic Geography and Historical Linguistics granted by the German Foundation Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung at the same University (1976-1978). After obtaining in the UFRJ the degree of \"Livre Docente\" (1977), a traditional academic title which qualifies a teacher to work on a rank above the Associate Professor, he became Full Professor of Romanve Philology in its Faculty of Letters (1981) with special attention to the relation between History and language practice and development. He is now a pensionated professor at the UFRJ. As a researcher, the author has tried to find the historical meaning of documents from medieval Portugal to the time of the discovery of Brazil and the following colonial period, revealing unedited life and work details of historical, cultural or literary personages like the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, the Portuguese king Afonso Henriques and his children, the Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares Cabral and his notary Pero Vaz de Caminha, the jesuit Jos&eacute; de Anchieta, the navigator Amerigo Vespucci and others. As a historian, he is a researcher that does everything with documents he analyses and is a frequent consultant to the main European and Brazilian libraries besides the use of his own large private library. Typical of this kind of work are his essays on the Brazilian language, officially Portuguese, and culture: Fundamentos da hist&oacute;ria externa do portugu&ecirc;s do Brasil, L&iacute;ngua, sociedade e cultura no Brasil, Forma&ccedil;&atilde;o e desenvolvimento da l&iacute;ngua nacional brasileira, A&ccedil;&atilde;o dos jesu&iacute;tas no processo de forma&ccedil;&atilde;o cultural do Brasil, O movimento academicista e o processo cultural do Brasil col&ocirc;nia, Literatura e sociedade no Brasil joanino. He was visiting professor for courses and/or conferences in the universities of Berlin, Mainz, Heidelberg, Venice, Cagliari, Padova and Pavia. Ariel Castro has a Homepage, Ariel Castro's Corner since June 22, 1996, where he displays many examples of what he has researched and written in the fields o Linguistics, Philology, Literature and History, regarding Brazil, Portugal, France and Western Europe in general.\n\nWhat are some examples of Narrative Poems?\n\nHere are some that I found on Wikipedia's Narrative poetry page:The Adventures & Brave Deeds Of The Ship's Cat On The Spanish Maine: Together With The Most Lamentable Losse Of The Alcestis & Triumphant Firing Of The Port Of Chagres by Richard AdamsAutobiography of Red by Anne Carson\"The Ballad Of Charlotte Dymond\" by Charles CausleyThe Book of the Duchess by Geoffrey ChaucerThe Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey ChaucerThe Charge of the Light Brigade by Alfred, Lord TennysonCrank by Ellen HopkinsCrossing America by Leo ConnellanThe Divine Comedy by DanteDon Juanby Lord ByronThe Eve of St. Agnes by John KeatsCantar de Mio Cid, (anonymous) medieval epicThe Elder Edda (anonymous)The Homeric Epics (Iliad, Odyssey, and The Homeric Hymns)The Epic of GilgameshThe Hunting of the Snark by Lewis CarrollThe Kalevala (the Finish national epic)Lamia by John Keats\"The Highwayman\" by Alfred NoyesThe Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun by J.R.R.
