        "text": "Three years ago at UMass Dartmouth, writer Frank X. Gaspar made a side revelation about the title of his poetry book, \"The Holyoke.\"\n\n\"Holyoke\" was the brand name for a steam boiler manufactured in the Massachusetts city with the same name, a memory from Mr. Gaspar's childhood in Provincetown that stuck in his mind.\n\nLike the old, long-gone boilers, the book itself is described as an \"elegy to a gone world\" populated with Portuguese immigrant fishermen.\n\nMr. Gaspar may venture to tell the story of \"The Holyoke\" during a Sept. 22 colloquium on contemporary Portuguese-American literature at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston.\n\nIf he does not, there will still be plenty to talk about.\n\nMr. Gaspar is one of four Portuguese-American writers taking part in \"Escrita da Vida — Vida da Escrita,\" a free colloquium organized by the Massachusetts Foundation for the Arts and the Center for Portuguese Studies and Culture at UMass Dartmouth.\n\nThe other participating authors are Katherine Vaz, Julian Silva and Erika de Vasconcelos.\n\nThe event runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and includes a performance of \"Through a Portagee Gate,\" a play based on New Bedford native Charles Reis Felix's memoir adapted by Culture*Park of New Bedford. There will be a post-performance discussion, as well.\n\nOrganizers hope the event and a companion series of discussions at local libraries serve to demonstrate the significant contributions of Portuguese-Americans to American literature.\n\nHosts for the reading and discussion series will include the Casa da Saudade branch library in New Bedford, and the public libraries in Fall River, Taunton, Cambridge and Ludlow.\n\nEach participating library will provide the five books in the series free of charge to interested participants. Books will be distributed about two weeks before each session. Participants will be able to take the book home, read it and return on the scheduled evening for a presentation and discussion with a specially trained discussion leader.\n\nHere's a closer look at each of the participating authors and the works they are presenting at the colloquium:\n\nIn addition to \"The Holyoke,\" Frank X. Gaspar is the award-winning author of \"Mass for the Grace of a Happy Death\" and \"A Field Guide to the Heavens,\" which won the Brittingham Prize for Poetry. A resident of Southern California, he is also the author of the autobiographical novel \"Leaving Pico,\" which won the Barnes & Noble Discover Award and the California Book Award for First Fiction. Colloquium organizers describe \"The Holyoke,\" Mr. Gaspar's presentation, as \"an elegy to a gone world — one peopled with fishermen and laborers and wives and mothers, all adhering, in one degree or another, to an Old-World Catholic way of life. The men fish perilously in the North Atlantic waters. The old ones, the velhos and velhas, still speak in the old tongue and dream of the green hills of their Azorean homeland ... 'The Holyoke' explores the small raptures and terrors, the jubilations and laments, of a life both profoundly sensed and gracefully examined.\"\n\nKatherine Vaz is the Briggs-Copeland Lecturer in Fiction at Harvard University, and the author of the novels \"Saudade\" and \"Mariana,\" the latter selected one of the top 30 international books by the Library of Congress. At the colloquium, her earlier work, \"Fado and Other Stories,\" a collection of short fiction, will be discussed. Organizers describe Ms. Vaz's prose as \"grounded in the meaning and value the land gives to human existence.\" In one of her stories, a woman sleeps with the village priest, trying to regain the land the church took from her family; in another, relatives in the Azores fight over a plot of land owned by their expatriate cousin. By turns the stories focus on the details of their characters' lives, then pull back to reveal the panorama of an entire culture, according to a description provided by the MFH.\n\nJulian Silva is a fourth-generation Portuguese-American. His Azorean ancestors settled in the San Francisco Bay area in the 1870s. The Center for Portuguese Studies at UMass Dartmouth just published Mr. Silva's novel \"Distant Music,\" itself two distinct stories,\"The Gunnysack Castle\" and \"The Death of Mae Ramos.\" According to organizers, the \"two discretely shaped yet interdependent narratives creating a family saga from the viewpoints of both maternal and paternal lines comprise this large and capacious diptych. 'Distant Music' begins in the 19th century and extends well into the 20th, retelling the story of the Woods and Ramos families and their descendants in rough-and-tumble California. In crisp, succinct and often elegant prose, rich in deftly selected detail, Julian Silva celebrates not only the resilience of men and women confronted with failure but, even more important, he exposes the compromised morality of their achievement.\"\n\nErika de Vasconcelos is a Toronto-based novelist, the daughter of Portuguese immigrants. She has published two novels: \"Between the Stillness and the Grove\" and \"My Darling Dead Ones.\" According to organizers, \"in this luminous first novel (\"My Darling Dead Ones\") Erika de Vasconcelos has created some of the strongest and most complex female characters in contemporary fiction. Her novel explores the connections that remain when you move from a European past to a North American present, the emotional legacies you inherit, and the bonds that hold or break.\"\n\n\"Memories of Portugal are rendered with supple, sensuous immediacy,\" writes the Calgary Herald. \"The forward-backward structure mirrors the journey Fiona takes into her family's past, as a way to come terms with her present. The result is an album of family photographs that catches us off guard by collapsing time, showing us something of ourselves in the images of the past.\"\n\nWhile the Sept. 22 colloquium is free, registration is required. To register go to http://www.mfh.org/escrita/index.html. Transportation will be available from The Standard-Times parking lot at 25 Elm St., New Bedford. The bus will depart at 8 a.m. and return at 3:30 p.m. Bus tickets are $20 each.\n\nContact Joao Ferreira at jferreira@s-t.com"
