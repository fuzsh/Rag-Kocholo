        "meta_description": "This paper highlights the significance of essential shifts in the social history of the Algarve, in the south of Portugal—namely through currents of migration from specific areas of the region—for our understanding of its built fabric, its traditions and modernisation processes. Traces of parallel developments in “vernacular” building custom in the Algarve and (postcolonial) Brazil during the 1870s, of Algarvian civil engineers building skyscrapers in São Paulo and commissioning modern architecture in Faro (Algarve) in the 1950s, and of Algarvian migrants prospering in Venezuela and becoming developers supporting modernism back home in the 1960s signal the impact of transcontinental migration flows, from Portugal to South America and back, on the creation of a constellation of building practices. Understanding these practices prompts us to push the boundaries of the history of modern European architecture to encompass the agency of non-architect migrants and their many roles. As designers, builders, dwellers and clients, who in some instances influenced the work of key architects while remaining marginal to the historical account of the profession, they were often the conduit of architectural changes that shaped the built environment.",

        "text": "Notes\n\nSibyl Moholy-Nagy, “The Diaspora,” Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, vol. 24, no. 1, 1965, p. 24–25. Very recent scholarship and international meetings specifically devoted to the circulation of architecture and transnational dissemination still place strong emphasis on the role of the architect, e.g. Metamorphosis: Architectural Modernity Between Europe and the Americas 1870–1970, international conference organised by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, the Society of Architectural Historians and the European Architectural History Network in Zurich, 2008, and Architectural Elective Affinities, international conference organised by the European Architectural History Network and the Faculdade de Arquitectura e Urbanismo da Universidade de São Paulo in São Paulo, 2013.\n\nSee the recent article by Kathleen James-Chakraborty, “Louis Kahn in Ahmedabad and Dhaka,” in Johan Lagae and Kim De Raedt (eds.), ABE Journal, themed issue of Global experts “off radar,” no. 4, 2014, URL: https://journals.openedition.org/abe/3385. Accessed 30 July 2014.\n\nSee for example the pioneering work of Ita Heinze-Greenberg, Erich Mendelsohn: Bauten und Projekte in Palästina (1934–1941), Munich: Scaneg, 1986 (Beiträge zur Kunstwissenschaft, 7).\n\nTestified by a recent surge in scholarship on the subject, e.g. Tom Avermaete and Johan Lagae (eds.), OASE Journal for Architecture, no. 82, 2010, theme issue L’Afrique c’est chic: Architecture and Planning in Africa 1950–1970, p. 35–54. URL: http://www.oasejournal.nl/en/Issues/82. Accessed 22 July 2015; and Lukasz Stanek (ed.), Journal of Architecture, vol. 17, no. 3, themed issue Cold War transfer: Architecture and planning from socialist countries in the “Third World”, 2011.\n\nMy approach here is similar to that adopted by Sarah Lynn Lopez in “The Remittance House: Architecture of Migration in Rural Mexico,” Buildings and Landscapes: Journal of the Vernacular Architecture Forum, vol. 17, no. 2, 2010, p. 33–52, and I would like to borrow her useful distinction between “transnational building practices initiated ‘from below’”—the subject of both articles, hers and mine—and “the actions and practices of corporate builders or international architects who built across borders” (note 1), p. 50. I thank the anonymous peer-reviewer who suggested this reference.\n\nThe concept of “systems of migration,” applying to migration currents a “systems approach” initially developed by social geographers for the study of rural–urban mobility, refers to “empirically observable interconnected migrations” or “a cluster of moves between a region of origin and a receiving region that continues over a period of time,” considering the migration experience of specific geographical areas within global patterns of population mobility. On the concept and its development see e.g. Dirk Hoerder, “Migration in the Atlantic Economies: Regional European Origins and Worldwide Expansion,” in Dirk Hoerder and Leslie Page Moch (eds.), European Migrants: Global and Local Perspectives, Boston, MA: Northeastern University Press, 1996, p. 21–51, and Jan Lucassen, Leo Lucassen and Patrick Manning, “Migration History: Multidisciplinary Approaches,” in Jan Lucassen, Leo Lucassen and Patrick Manning (eds.), Migration History in World History: Multidisciplinary Approaches, Leiden; Boston, MA: Brill, 2010 (Studie in global history, 3), p. 3–35.\n\nAn essential reference of this attention is the pioneering work of Dell Upton and his disciples. See e.g. Dell Upton (ed.), America’s Architectural Roots: Ethnic Groups that Built America, New York, NY: Preservation Press, 1986 (Building Watchers Series); and Dell Upton, Architecture in the United States, Oxford; New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1998 (Oxford history of art). A very recent example, focused on the consequences of such exchanges on the built and social fabric of the home country today, is Sarah Lynn Lopez, The Remittance Landscape: Spaces of Migration in Rural Mexico and Urban USA, Chicago, IL; London: University of Chicago Press, 2015.\n\nRicardo Agarez, Regionalism, Modernism and Vernacular Tradition in the Architecture of the Algarve, Portugal, 1925–1965, doctoral dissertation, The Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London, 2013. A book based on the dissertation is to be published in Ashgate’s series “Studies in Architecture”.\n\nPortugal was one of the countries with the highest rates of emigration in Europe, ranking second only to Ireland at the end of the nineteenth century, and just behind Italy and Scotland on the eve of World War I in emigrants per one thousand inhabitants; cf. Dudley Baines, Emigration from Europe, 1815–1930, Cambridge; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 4.\n\nFor recent examples of a new approach to the subject, see Isabel Cardoso’s doctoral dissertation on the building practices of North Portugal emigrants to France in the 1970s, Imaginário e História das Casas dos “Portugueses de França,” Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 2008, which partly extends the pioneering socio-anthropologic work of Roselyne de Villanova, Carolina Leite and Isabel Raposo, Maisons de rêve au Portugal: Enquête sur des migrants batisseurs, Paris: Éditions Créaphis, 1994; and Tiago Castela’s doctoral dissertation on the self-building activity of rural migrants and returned emigrants in the suburbs of Lisbon since the 1960s, A Liberal Space: A History of the Illegalized Working-Class Extensions of Lisbon, University of California, Berkeley, 2011. The architect Manuel Graça Dias was possibly the first, in the 1980s, to shock Portuguese architectural culture by drawing attention to the role of the returned emigrant in shaping the landscape in the north of Portugal, cherishing the spontaneity of this production with a tongue-in-cheek, provocative tone. See Manuel Graça Dias, “Formas Arquitectónicas Populares e Urbanas (Vernáculas?) em Portugal (Sem se saber porquê e 49 legendas),” in Mário Ferreira Lages and Artur Teodoro de Matos (eds.), Portugal: Percursos de Interculturalidade, Lisbon: Alto Comissariado para a Imigração e Diálogo Intercultural, 2008, p. 313–352.\n\nAdam Sharr, “Primitive and the Everyday: Sergison Bates, Lefebvre and the Guilt of Architectural Expertise,” in Jo Odgers, Flora Samuel and Adam Sharr (eds.), Primitive: Original Matters in Architecture, New York, NY: Routledge, 2006, p. 248–249.\n\nStephen Cairns, “Drifting: Architecture/Migrancy,” in Stephen Cairns (ed.), Drifting: Architecture and Migrancy, London; New York, NY: Routledge, 2004 (Architext series), p. 21–22.\n\nThis paper forms part of a new research project, provisionally entitled Migrant Building Practices: The Circulation of Architecture with Portuguese Labour, 1870–1970. Its ongoing preparation led the author to pursue two short-term scientific missions in the cadre of the COST Action IS0904, European Architecture beyond Europe: Sharing Research and Knowledge on Dissemination Processes, Historical Data and Material Legacy (19th–20th centuries), at Ghent University (hosted by Prof. Johan Lagae, in June 2013) and at the Institut national de l’histoire de l’art, Paris (hosted by Prof. Mercedes Volait, in March 2014). The author thanks the COST Action management committee and his hosts for creating these opportunities to further his research and take part in this groundbreaking project. Within the topic of this project, the author is also co-chairing the session “Building Practices in Transcontinental Migration” at the Society of Architectural Historians 68th Annual Conference, in Chicago (15-19 April 2015).\n\nFor a clear example of these impassioned accounts, see Nuno Teotónio Pereira, “O Combate pela Arquitectura Moderna em Portugal. Um Contributo Açoreano,” Atlântida, no. 1, 1999, p. 229–238.\n\nFor recent case studies on the role of migrants as key players in the building world, the best example is perhaps the excellent monograph on the architecture of a master-builder-turned-migrant in central Portugal between the 1930s and the 1970s, by Domingos Tavares, Francisco Farinhas: Realismo Moderno, Porto: Dafne, 2008 (Equações de Arquitectura).\n\nThe region called the Algarve (from the Arabic Al-Gharb [“the West”] Al-Andalus, i.e. west of the Moorish domains of Andalusia) was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate in the eigth century and conquered back by the Christian king of Portugal between 1189 and 1249.\n\nMarcelo J. Borges, Chains of Gold: Portuguese Migration to Argentina in Transatlantic Perspective, Leiden; Boston, MA: Brill, 2009 (Studies in global social history, 2), p. 72. This is one of the most thorough investigations to date on the social, economic and cultural features of Algarvian settlers overseas; however, little mention is made of their building practices, either at home or abroad. For an important precedent to Borges’s studies on migration from the Algarve, see the Algarvian geographer Carminda Cavaco’s investigations of the 1970s into the migration currents to Spain and Morocco, namely in Carminda Cavaco, “Migrações Internacionais de Trabalhadores do Sotavento Algarvio,” Finisterra. Revista Portuguesa de Geografia, vol. 6, no. 11, 1971, p. 41–83. URL: http://www.ceg.ul.pt/finisterra/. Accessed 17 July 2015.\n\nFor example: architect Carlos Ramos’s pioneering modernist hospital building in São Brás de Alportel (1930–1932) was built with funds collected among emigrants to Argentina; cf. Afonso da Cunha Duarte, São Brás de Alportel. Memórias, São Brás de Alportel: Casa da Cultura António Bentes, 2005, p. 177; and Olhão’s post-war modernist masterpiece, architects Manuel Laginha and Rogério Martins’s social service centre (1951–1958), was financed by Mr. José dos Santos Rufino, who was a returned emigrant to Mozambique; cf. Antero Nobre, História Breve da Vila de Olhão da Restauração, Olhão: A Voz de Olhão, 1984, p. 139.\n\nNotably one of the first modern seaside hotels in the Algarve, architects Jorge Ferreira Chaves and Frederico Sant’Ana’s remarkable Hotel do Garbe in Armação de Pêra (1959–1963), was commissioned by Mr. Francisco Oliveira Santos, who was a returned emigrant to Angola; cf. Manuel Ferreira Chaves (in discussion with the author, August 2010).\n\nSee José Damião Rodrigues, “No Povoamento dos Açores,” in Maria da Graça Maia Marques (ed.), O Algarve da Antiguidade aos Nossos Dias, Lisbon: Colibri, 1999, p. 163–169.\n\nGünter Weimer, Arquitectura popular brasileira, São Paulo: Martins Fontes, 2005 (Raízes), p. 78, and Ana Tostões and José Manuel Fernandes, Arquitectura Popular dos Açores, Lisbon: Ordem dos Arquitectos, 2000.\n\nLouis-Léger Vauthier, “Des maisons d’habitation au Brésil,” Revue générale de l’architecture et des travaux publics, no. 11, 1853, p. 247 (Lettre III). Vauthier’s Lettres are generally considered one of the earliest sources on the non-monumental architecture of Brazil.\n\nGünter Weimer, Arquitectura popular brasileira, op. cit. (note 21), p. 96–98, 100, 103.\n\nIbid., p. 94–107.\n\nNamely in the symbolic representations of the regions of Portugal at the most important mid-century international expositions, such as Paris 1937, New York 1939 and San Francisco 1939, as well as in the “regional display” that featured prominently as part of the Exposition of the Portuguese World held in Lisbon in 1940. See Ricardo Agarez, “Regional Identity for the Leisure of Travellers: Early Tourism Infrastructure in the Algarve (Portugal), 1940–1965,” The Journal of Architecture, vol. 18, no. 5, 2013, p. 721–743.\n\nJacinto Palma Dias and João Brissos, O Algarve Revisitado, Lisbon: Lisboa 94; Festa do Livro, 1994.\n\nOn the modernist fascination with the “vernacular” buildings of Olhão, see Ricardo Agarez, “Olhão, Modern Vernacular and Vernacular Modernism,” in First International Meeting EAHN – European Architectural History Network, Guimarães: eahn; Universidade do Minho – Escola de Arquitectura, 2010, p. 128–135.\n\nFor a discussion of this misapprehension and its implications, see Ricardo Agarez, “Vernacular, Conservative, Modernist: The Uncomfortable ‘Zone 6’ (Algarve) of the Portuguese Folk Architecture Survey (1955–1961),” in Joana Cunha Leal, Maria Helena Maia and Alexandra Cardoso (eds.), To and Fro: Modernism and Vernacular Architecture, Porto: Centro de Estudos Arnaldo Araújo da cesap/esap, 2013, p. 31–50.\n\nE.g. in Mariano Feio, Le Bas Alentejo et l’Algarve, Lisbon: Union Géographique Internationale, 1949.

Accessed 29 December 2012. It is estimated that between 1855 and 1914 Brazil attracted 80 to 90 per cent of the Portuguese emigration contingent; cf.

Explorations en histoire urbaine, Tervuren: Koninklijk museum voor Midden-Afrika/Musée royal d'Afrique centrale; Louvain-la-Neuve: Université catholique de Louvain; Paris: L’Harmattan, 2007 (Cahiers africains/Afrika studies), p. 157–178.\n\nThe existing, comprehensive social history studies on the Portuguese immigrants in Brazil in the last two centuries are clearly insufficient, especially given the scale of the phenomenon and its enduring repercussions in both countries. This limitation and the reasons for it were discussed in Ana Silvia Volpi Scott, “Verso e Reverso da Imigração Portuguesa: O Caso de São Paulo entre as Décadas de 1820 a 1930,” Oceanos, no. 44, 2000, p. 127–142, and id., “As duas faces da imigração portuguesa para o Brasil (décadas de 1820–1930),” in Vicente Pérez Moreda and Blanca Sánchez Alonso (eds.), Congreso de Historia Económica, Saragossa: Institución Fernando el Católico, 2001. URL: http://www.unizar.es/eueez/cahe/volpiscott.pdf. Accessed 22 July 2015. Recently, a large-scale research project that attempts to fill the gap has been developed by CEPESE—Centre of Studies on Population, Economy and Society, in Porto, entitled The Emigration from North Portugal to Brazil; it comprises contributions from Portuguese and Brazilian scholars but is focused solely on immigrants from north Portugal. The first results of this research were published as two theme issues of the journal Revista População e Sociedade, numbers 14 and 15, 2007.\n\nHerbert S. Klein, “The Social and Economic Integration of Portuguese Immigrants in Brazil in the Late Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries,” Journal of Latin American Studies, vol. 23, no. 2, 1991, p. 309–337.\n\nThe cortiços built by Portuguese tavern-owners/speculators in Rio played a strong part in the animosity Brazilians directed at their former colonisers in the late 19th century, and in the construct of a stereotype of the greedy, uncouth Portuguese that lasts to this day in Brazil and still helps to explain the deep-set resentment that many Brazilians of all social strata continue to nurture towards the Portuguese. The importance of the cortiço as a materialisation of postcolonial Portuguese exploitation of the Brazilian people is clear in coeval literature—e.g. see Aluísio Azevedo, O cortiço (1890)—and has been the object of social sciences studies, e.g. Gladys Sabina Ribeiro, “Porque você veio encher o pandulho aqui? Os portugueses, o antilusitanismo e a exploração das moradias populares no Rio de Janeiro da República Velha,” Análise Social, vol. 29, no. 127, 1994, p. 631–654.\n\nManuel Teixeira, “A Habitação Popular no Século xix – Características Morfológicas, a Transmissão de Modelos: as Ilhas do Porto e os Cortiços do Rio de Janeiro,” Análise Social, vol. 29, no. 127, 1994, p. 555–579.\n\nIbid., p. 577–578.\n\nFor example, Lindener Pareto Júnior’s master’s dissertation at Faculdade de Arquitetura e Urbanismo of Universidade de São Paulo, entitled O cotidiano em construção: os “práticos licenciados” em São Paulo (1893–1933), of 2011, detailed the background and careers of master-builders and designers (some of whom were later labelled as architects) in São Paulo at the turn of the twentieth century; many of these were Italian and German migrants, while a smaller number was either Portuguese or of Portuguese descent.\n\nThe Algarvian part in modern-day colonization efforts in Angola was first researched and published by Alberto Iria in Breve Notícia Acerca da Expansão e Esforço Colonizador dos Pescadores Olhanenses no Sul de Angola: Subsídios para a Historia da Colonização Algarvia em África, Lisbon: Sociedade Nacional de Tipografia, 1938. A recent survey of Portuguese colonial architecture in Africa quoted the architect Luis Amaral as noting how the Algarvians “made a piece of Algarve in Moçâmedes,” cf. José M. Fernandes and Filipe Themudo Barata (eds.), Património de Origem Portuguesa no Mundo: Arquitectura e Urbanismo. África Mar Vermelho Golfo Pérsico, Lisbon: Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, 2010, p. 478.\n\nThis understanding is clear, for example, in the scholarship produced by members of the Vernacular Architecture Forum in the last two decades. For a study that focuses specifically on local building practices resulting from the contribution of migrant builders, see e.g. Chris Wilson, “Pitched Roofs over Flat: The Emergence of a New Building Tradition in Hispanic New Mexico,” in Thomas Carter and Bernard L. Herman (eds.), Perspectives in Vernacular Architecture, IV, Columbia, MO; London: University of Missouri Press for the Vernacular Architecture Forum, 1991, p. 87–97.\n\nSee José Vitorino, “A Complexidade do Fenómeno Emigratório no País e no Algarve’, in 2º Congresso Nacional Sobre o Algarve, [Silves]: [Racal Clube de Silves], 1982.\n\nSee João Pereira Neto, “América Latina e Europa: Dois Sentidos, Duas Épocas da Emigração Algarvia,” in 3º Congresso Sobre o Algarve, [Silves]: Racal Clube de Silves, 1984.\n\nFor a discussion of this appropriation process, see Ricardo Agarez, “Metropolitan Narratives on Peripheral Contexts: Buildings and Constructs in Algarve (South Portugal), c. 1950,” in Ruth Morrow and Mohamed Gamal Abdelmonem (eds.), Peripheries: Edge Conditions in Architecture, London: Routledge, 2012 (Critiques, 8), p. 209–224.\n\nThe exhibition of the architect’s work curated by Gonçalo Vargas, “Manuel Gomes da Costa: Moderno ao Sul” (Faro, 2009), followed this narrative, as did the article by José M. Fernandes, “De Jorge de Oliveira a Gomes da Costa. Dois Autores e Duas Concepções da Arquitectura no Século xx em Faro,” Monumentos, no. 24, 2006, p. 140–147.\n\nManuel Gomes da Costa, project statement 1 April 1954, 104/1954 (Rua Manuel Ascensão), Faro (Portugal), Câmara Municipal de Faro, Secção de Arquivo de Obras.\n\nThe influence of Brazilian post-war modernism on Portuguese architecture—through vehicles such as the MoMA exhibition and the catalogue Brazil Builds (1943), the exhibition of Brazilian architecture in Lisbon (1948), the monograph issues of the French journal L’Architecture d’Aujourd’hui (1947, 1953), and Mindlin’s Modern Architecture in Brazil (1956)—has been amply discussed in Portuguese scholarship. See for instance Ana Tostões, Os Verdes Anos na Arquitectura Portuguesa dos Anos 50, Porto: FAUP, 1997 (Argumentos, 14); Ana Tostões, “Moderno e Nacional na Arquitectura Portuguesa. A Descoberta da Modernidade Brasileira,” in José Pessôa, Moderno e Nacional, Niterói: Editora da Universidade Federal Fluminense, 2006, p. 101–124; Ana Vaz Milheiro, A Construção do Brasil: Relações com a Cultura Arquitectónica Portuguesa, Porto: FAUP, 2005; Ana Vaz Milheiro, “O Brasil moderno e a sua influência na arquitectura portuguesa: A tradição em Brazil builds (1943) e o seu reflexo no Inquérito à Arquitectura Popular em Portugal (1955–1961),” in Fernando Diniz Moreira, Arquitectura moderna no Norte e Nordeste do Brasil: Universalidade e diversidade, Recife: docomomo, 2007; and Ana Vaz Milheiro, “Experiências em Concreto Armado na África Portuguesa: Influências do Brasil,” Pós, vol. 16, no. 25, 2009, p. 56–79.\n\nCf.

Transcription in possession of the interviewer.\n\nGio Ponti, “Coraggio del Venezuela,” Domus, no. 295, 1954.\n\nThis development, which deeply impressed foreign observers, was portrayed at the time in human geography studies, e.g. Jean Ulric, Venezuela, Paris: Éditions du Seuil, 1961 (Petite planète, 29), and in a few architecture titles that generally focused on the work of architect Villanueva, e.g. Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, Carlos Raúl Villanueva and the Architecture of Venezuela, London: Tiranti, 1964. For recent scholarship by Venezuelan authors, see Anita Berrizbeitia’s sophisticated contextualization in Roberto Burle Marx in Caracas: Parque del Este, 1956–1961, Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005 (Penn Studies in Landscape Architecture).\n\nMay Lumsden, “Caracas—The Buildingest City in South America,” Architectural Forum, vol. 101, no. 5, 1954.\n\nA project best known for Alexander Calder’s iconic aula magna ceiling. See e.g. Enrique Larrañaga, “Toward the Visibility of the Invisible,” in Jean-François Lejeune, Cruelty and Utopia: Cities and Landscapes of Latin America, (1st published in connection with an exhibition at the civa in Brussels, May 22–Oct 5, 2003. Trans. Accents sprl-bvba), New York, NY: Princeton Architectural Press, 2003.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1959, 70.5% of the total emigration from Algarve went to South America; cf. João Pereira Neto, “América Latina e Europa: Dois Sentidos, Duas Épocas da Emigração Algarvia,” in 3º Congresso Sobre o Algarve, [Silves]: Racal Clube de Silves, 1984.\n\nAlgarvian workers headed for Venezuela amounted to 19% of all departures in the 1950s; cf. Marcelo J. Borges, Chains of Gold, op. cit. (note 17), p. 116–117.\n\nTwo of the priorities of Algarvian emigrants to Venezuela on their return were land acquisition and house building; cf. João Pereira Neto, “O Contributo dos Emigrantes para o Desenvolvimento do Algarve,” in 2º Congresso Nacional Sobre o Algarve, [Silves]: [Racal Clube de Silves], 1982.\n\nAntónio Pinheiro Brandão and José Brandão Pinheiro trusted Gomes da Costa with twelve commissions between 1952 and 1965.\n\nCommissioned by Mr. José Brandão Pinheiro, 957/1959 (House in Ilha de Faro), Faro (Portugal), Câmara Municipal de Faro, Secção de Arquivo de Obras.\n\nCommissioned by Mr. António Pinheiro Brandão, Faro (Portugal), 162/1959 (Rua de Berlim 15), by Ms. Albertina Pires Dias Brandão, 484/1959 (Rua de Berlim 13) and by Mr. José Brandão Pinheiro, 1265/1962 (Rua de Berlim 35), Faro (Portugal), Câmara Municipal de Faro, Secção de Arquivo de Obras.\n\nThe buildings on both sides of the top end of Avenida Cinco de Outubro, 1098/1957 and 700/1965, Faro (Portugal), Câmara Municipal de Faro, Secção de Arquivo de Obras.\n\nManuel Gomes da Costa, project statement 12 January 1959, 162/1959 (Rua de Berlim 15), Faro (Portugal), Câmara Municipal de Faro, Secção de Arquivo de Obras.\n\nThese where commissioned by Ms. Maria do Livramento Horta das Neves, a resident of El-Jadida (house in Rua Dr. Parreira 40, LU 48/1963, and building in Rua Eng. Arantes e Oliveira, unbuilt project of September 1964), and by Mr. Joaquim Viegas dos Prazeres, a resident of Mèknes (house in Rua dos Mouros 52, LU 12/1964), Tavira (Portugal), Câmara Municipal de Tavira, Arquivo Histórico.\n\nA very good example of such studies is Alice Friedman’s enlightening discussion of the role of women clients in the creation of some of the most important houses in modern architecture’s canon: Alice T. Friedman, Women and the Making of the Modern House: A Social and Architectural History, New York, NY: Harry N. Abrams, 1998.\n\nHaut de page"
