        "text": "SILVA, A. J. M. (2015), The fable of the cod and the promised sea. About Portuguese traditions of bacalhau, in BARATA, F. T- and ROCHA, J. M. (eds.), Heritages and Memories from the Sea, Proceedings of the 1st International Conference of the UNESCO Chair in Intangible Heritage and Traditional Know-How: Linking Heritage, 14-16 January 2015. University of Evora, Évora, pp. 130-143. ABSTRACT Salt cod (bacalhau in Portuguese) occupied for centuries an important place in the diet of the Portuguese, it is also true that we cannot understand this constant presence regardless of changes in fisheries, trade networks between the North Atlantic and Southern Europe, drying techniques and the social context of consumption during the same period. This presentation revisits different kinds of old and new sources that refute the idea of a simple continuity in the consumption, fishing and drying techniques of bacalhau. Mapping discontinuities in these different historical contexts brings us to consider the collective memory built around the bacalhau as a social force, more active than ever. At the same time, this memory is itself the product of a continuous process of reinvention, selective and labile, that constantly renegotiates the place that the “faithful friend” has in the imagination of communities that claim, in one way or another, their commitment to the idea of “portugality”.\n\nFor several centuries, salt cod have been a staple food in Spain and Portugal. We tend today to forget that the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula also ate stockfish during the same period. This paper will review issues and historical evidence related to the air-dried unsalted cod consumption in these two countries, from the beginning of the Middle Ages to the present days. The goal is to re-evaluate the rewriting of the Iberian cod saga in the context of the ongoing attempt to revaluing the Catalan cuisine as an intangible cultural heritage and to promoting food tourism in the ports of the Costa Brava\n\n“Annona ou Mixto-Curioso” is the first known published culinary magazine in Portugal. Anonymous, it was published weekly in Lisbon between 1836 and 1837, with only 36 issues published. It was the first printed culinary title published between 1789 and 1841, period in which were only reedited previous printed titles: “Arte de Cozinha” (first edition in 1680) and “Cozinheiro Moderno” (first edition in 1780). The editorial in the first issue assures to the reader that the objective was to praise the “most necessary, and more convenient object, the taste recreation and the pleasant conservation of the existence”, inspired by the valorization of the social and cultural dimensions of the “good taste” as an element of “civilization” in the first quarter of the 19 th century, Focused in the publication of recipes and culinary techniques, each weekly issue was formed by an average of 20 entries, including recipes of soups, meat, fish and sweets which origins were omitted. The analysis of the recipes revealed that the major part were selected from the previous centuries’ printed Portuguese cookbooks but, in a considerable number of cases, there were no previous written record known, including some more humble and popular recipes, very different from the complex and international proposals selected from the previous cookbooks. The present study aims to describe what was selected to this publication and how these selection could help to understand the exposure of the Portuguese aristocratic and bourgeois classes to the international gastronomic revolution in the first half of the 19 th century.\n\nThe fourteen essays in Food, Texts, and Cultures in Latin America and Spain showcase the eye-opening potential of a food lens withing colonial studies, ethnic and racial studies, gender and sexuality studies, and studies of power dynamics, nationalisms and nation building, theories of embodiment, and identity. In short, Food, Texts and Cultures in Latin America and Spain grapples with an emerging field in need of a foundational text, and does so from multiple angles.The studies span from the Middle Ages to twenty-first century, and the contributing scholars occupy diverse fields within Latin American and Hispanic studies. As such, their essays showcase eclectic critical and theoretical approaches to the subject of Latin American and Iberian Food. Food, Texts, and Cultures in Latin America and Spain also introduces the first English-language publication of woks from such award-winning scholars as Adolfo Castañón of the Mexican Academy of Language; Sergio Ramírez, winner of the 2017 Miguel de Cervantes Prize in Literature; And Carmen Simón Palmer, winner of the 2015 Julián Marías Prize for Research.\n\nThis work aims to analyze the verbal-visual texts published in the custom culinary magazine Sabe Bem (SB), one of the branded content communication vehicles of Pingo Doce, a supermarket that is part of Jerónimo Martins, a Portuguese corporate group that is ranked as the 50th major global retails, and operates in food distribution in Portugal, Poland, and Colombia. In order to understand some transformation in Portuguese food culture during the first year of the pandemic, January/February 2020 to May/June 2021, SB´s editions were selected to be verified in this work. This study was supported by the theoretical and methodological frameworks of the semiotics of culture presented by the semiotician Y. Lotman (1986). The enunciators' discourses were examined to see how they organize a food semiosphere during a global crisis time. Thanks to this route, it was identified that in the period of the first year of the pandemic, the discourses in SB magazine have extolled the Portuguese nationalism through messages around different produced food items from different regions in this country.\n\nThe Portuguese influence on the metropolitan region of Mumbai is not only undeniable but also ubiquitous. This influence takes various forms - this dissertation will focus on two such forms, namely, language and cuisine. Different historical narratives often lead to an 'editing' of history, which is a phenomenon that has taken place with Mumbai's Portuguese cultural heritage. This dissertation will, thus, attempt to overcome this challenge and conduct an in-depth analysis of the long-lasting impact left on Mumbai by its Portuguese colonizers and the bond that remains between Mumbai and Portugal even today, with an emphasis on tracing the history and influence of language and cuisine."
