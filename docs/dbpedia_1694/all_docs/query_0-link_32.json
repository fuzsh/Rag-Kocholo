        "text": "\"Operatic... and memorably vivid.\" --Kirkus (starred review)\n\n\"Focus on the Protestant Portuguese's exile from Madeira... creates a fascinating framework for this episodic yet sweeping literary novel that is equal parts love story and immigrant experience...\" --Booklist\n\n\"In lyrical prose, Vaz conveys her characters' curiosity about the world's beauty and doles out powerful observations on human nature... Readers will be entranced by this ambitious and heartbreaking saga.\" --Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n\"Katherine Vaz has given us yet another magical novel with vivid imagery and the complexities of cultural identity. Above the Salt is a sprawling epic narrative with thought-provoking and exquisitely crafted language that explores the impact of history, religion, culture, and migration. It is a compelling saga, a literary masterpiece that celebrates the enduring power of love and reflects on our shared heritage.\" --Diniz Borges, writer, editor, translator\n\n\"Vaz has written an epic love story, about time and distance and miracles and a fate written in the stars. The writing is astonishing, beautiful; the book impossible to put down.\" --Whitney Otto, author of How To Make an American Quilt\n\n\"Above the Salt is a lyrically haunting historical tale of what lovers overcome to manifest their destinies and find their best selves. Set against a backdrop of horticulture, migration, religion, and renewal, Katherine Vaz's novel sweeps us across decades and seas--from a tiny Portuguese island off the coast of Africa to the sprawling American Midwest--to expertly weave faith, hope, betrayal, and resilience into a story of enduring love.\"\n\n--Amina Gautier, author of The Best That You Can Do\n\n\"What are our obligations to honor and love?

Now we have a new novel from her, and the magic has expanded.\" --Alexander Chee, author of Edinburgh and The Queen of the Night\n\n\"Katherine Vaz offers us a story of discovery, loss, and the fragile but unwavering bonds of love that endure despite it all. This epic saga confirms her as one of our best writers.\" --Maaza Mengiste, author of The Shadow King, shortlisted for the 2020 Booker Prize\n\n\"Since the publication of her first novel, Saudade, Katherine Vaz has stood out as a Portuguese American writer uniquely capable of expressing the inchoate longing of the Portuguese soul. Now, with Above the Salt, she becomes the pre-eminent voice of those of us who are part of the vast Portuguese diaspora with this visionary, immigrants' tale told through her rueful, hallucinogenic prose.\" --Michael Rezendes, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist"
