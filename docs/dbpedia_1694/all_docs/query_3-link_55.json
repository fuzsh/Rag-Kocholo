We delved into some serious subjects: the legacy of racism in the South, gun control, and substance abuse, but despite all of that, we managed to laugh every now and then because he is hilarious!\n\n(And I said the word \"interesting\" about a gazillion times--Why? Why did I keep saying the same word over and over again as if I was malfunctioning?)\n\nAnyway, George taught me a lot about persevering despite the fact that he (like many of us) gets sick of his own voice. He shared an anecdote about working with C. Michael Curtis of \"The Atlantic Monthly\" that shocked and delighted me.\n\nWe laughed about that too.\n\nPlease read his story, \"I'm Down Here on the Floor,\" before you listen to the podcast on Apple, Spotify, Audible, or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nMy apologies to StorySouth. I forgot to mention where the story was published during the podcast, but this is actually the second story in a row from StorySouth. Check out Jason Ockert's story \"The Peoplemachines\" from the September 1st episode as well.\n\nAlso, here's a link to The Atlantic Monthly story George mentioned called \"Show and Tell.\" I think the paywall might be down now (?), but I subscribe to that magazine, so someone needs to let me know.\n\n*Warning: There is some profanity on this episode, folks.\n\nSee you next month when I'll be talking to Bonnie Jo Campbell about her story, \"Boar Taint,\" from The Kenyon Review.\n\nCheers,\n\nKelly\n\nBio: George Singleton has published eight collections of stories, two novels, and a book of writing advice.
