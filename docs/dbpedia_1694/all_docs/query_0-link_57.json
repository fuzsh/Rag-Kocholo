Through the parody of nineteenth-century religious and scientific discourses (Eça), and of symbolist poetics (Álvaro de Campos), as well as the recontextualization of early-modern Portuguese travel writing tropes, these two writers propose two alternative understandings of Portugal’s specific position in the modern geopolitics of empire. This article argues that the prescience of Eça’s and Pessoa’s critiques of orientalism forecloses, rather than authorizes, future essentialist views of Portugal’s historical specificity as evidence of exceptionalism.\n\nA collection of innovative and insightful essays providing a critical and theoretical reflection on the concept and history of Lusofonia. \"Lusofonia and Its Futures\" is a richly textured collection of essays on the Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) world, comprised of over 230 million people in eight countries on four continents. The notion of Lusofonia encompasses the cultural identities generated by Portuguese-speakers with shared as well as divergent histories. This volume presents a nuanced and critical study of the concept and history of Lusofonia from a variety of theoretical approaches. In addition to this thematic focus, Lusofonia and Its Futures includes fiction in translation by writers from several countries in the Lusophone world as well as scholarly essays on such topics as the English novel in Brazilian literature and the reception of Fernando Pessoa in Brazil.\n\nThis thesis investigates the spaces of interaction between Portuguese and Brazilian modernists. Relocations and transfigurations of the Ulysses myth are the main threads reconceptualizing the nation in the works analysed. In this respect, ‘Portuguese Ulyssism’ is an axial cultural construct, which this thesis partially absorbs but also departs from, in order to assert mutating literary experiences referring to the Camonean version of the myth in the Renaissance epic Os Lusíadas/The Lusiads. The research, therefore, suggests a Ulyssian voyaging of the mind in Pessoa’s and the brothers Campos’s works. For this, it reveals a dialogue between the modernists of both countries who, outside of their respective national literatures, open a space of interaction beyond the territories of nation-states through texts on exile, national identity, and colonialism. This thesis suggests that Portugal’s Modernism is evidence of the double-writing on the nation of the country’s leading modernists: Fe..."
