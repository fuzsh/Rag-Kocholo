A publicação é da responsabilidade dos seus autores.\n\nComunidades\n\nBehind the Stars, More Stars: The Tagus/Disquiet Collection of New Luso-American Writing – Elaine Avila\n\nBehind the Stars, More\n\nStars: The Tagus/Disquiet Collection of New Luso-American Writing is an essential\n\nnew collection of contemporary American writers of Lusophone-country descent\n\nedited by Christopher Larkosh, Associate Professor at the University of\n\nMassachusetts Dartmouth and Oona Patrick of the Disquiet International Literary\n\nProgram in Lisbon. Tagus Press describes their new publication as presenting\n\n\"experimental and boundary-breaking prose especially from women, people of\n\ncolor, and LGBTQ writers,\" and imagining \"a more diverse and inclusive\n\nLuso-American and Portuguese-American literary scene, which has traditionally\n\nbeen dominated by male voices.\" The writers were all participants of the\n\n\"Writing the Luso Experience\" workshops at the Disquiet International\n\nLiterary Program in Lisbon, which is going into its ninth year. Behind the\n\nStars, More Stars includes Disquiet faculty Katherine Vaz and Frank X.\n\nGaspar, alongside writers from the workshops such as Traci Brimhall, Jarita\n\nDavis, Hugo Dos Santos, and previously unpublished women writers.\n\nElaine Avila, Disquiet\n\nFaculty/Fulbright Scholar to Portugal (2019), interviews editors Oona Patrick\n\nand Christopher Larkosh, to celebrate the publication of this formally\n\nexperimental, exuberantly funny, exaltedly detailed, delightfully\n\ncontradictory, gut wrenching and poignant anthology.\n\nInterview with Christopher\n\nLarkosh\n\nOne of the many reasons I\n\nlove this anthology is that it exemplifies your vision for the Portuguese in\n\nthe Americas Series at Tagus Press. Can you tell PAJ readers about the new\n\ndirections you are taking?\n\nThanks for saying so, Elaine.\n\nWhen I began my two-year stint at Director of Tagus Press in 2015 I was in\n\nLisbon at Disquiet with then-Managing Editor Mário Pereira. In our discussions\n\nwith Oona and program participants, our interactions only underscored what we\n\nhad had in mind for some time: to place more emphasis on those narratives that\n\nhadn’t yet been told or explored in as much depth as others. Our most recent\n\npublications, most notably the 2016 collection of poetry titled Return\n\nFlights, by the Cape Verdean-American writer and Disquiet alumna Jarita\n\nDavis, is a reflection of this shared desire to open up the discussion of who\n\nwe are as a community to a wider range of perspectives.\n\nThese perspectives, however,\n\nare not limited merely to those shaped by race and racialization, ethnicity,\n\ngender identity and sexuality. Equally important are those understandings of\n\nidentity that depart from more critical interpretations of the experience of\n\nlife under the Salazar dictatorship and its intrinsic components of colonial\n\nrule, emigration and political exile. The Portuguese-American diaspora, as well\n\nas other \"Lusodiasporic\" communities as I call them, are irreversibly shaped by\n\nthese historical processes, so I guess I simply wanted what we publish and\n\noffer for a more inclusive discussion In the community to reflect that.\n\nHopefully with this heightened historical consciousness as an intrinsic part of\n\nour cultural identity, we might even be able to challenge and counter more\n\neffectively those authoritarian rumblings we might notice in our everyday\n\nculture and political life on this side of the Atlantic as well.\n\nYou mention that perhaps the\n\ngreat Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector’s \"literary and existential\n\nsensibility has been the most inseparable\" from your own. Please tell us more.\n\nThank you for picking up on\n\nthis and asking me about it. When I began this journey into transnational\n\nLusophone studies, the first work I ever read in Portuguese was the novel A\n\nmaça no escuro by Clarice Lispector. It was the summer of 1984; I can\n\nremember sitting on a bench on the edge of Oak Bluffs Harbor with this book in\n\nmy hand as the ferryboats sailed in and out on their way to and from Woods\n\nHole, Falmouth and Hyannis. At the time the migration of Brazilians to Martha’s\n\nVineyard had not yet begun in earnest, but in a few short years the Island\n\nwould once again have a year-round population of Portuguese speakers, albeit\n\nfrom a different place that most of my childhood classmates and neighbors; i.\n\ne., the Azorean island of Faial. It is this openness to a broader understanding\n\nof identification with the Portuguese language that I wish to share with my\n\nstudents of Portuguese, and I always find myself overjoyed when one of my\n\nPortuguese-American students finds a new favorite author among the wide range\n\nof Brazilian authors I assign in both undergraduate and graduate seminars.\n\nAs for me, what I appreciate\n\nmost in Clarice’s work in particular is her connection with a broad expanse of\n\nspace and time while still aware of the challenges of describing even the most limited of physical spaces or a single moment in one’s own subjective emotional\n\nexperience, a challenge both impossible and necessary at the same time. I am\n\nabout to teach her novel A paixão Segundo G.H. again to my advanced\n\nstudents next week; the ways it continues to spur discussions among all my\n\nstudents about the limits of one’s literary world, not to mention the fleeting\n\nnature of existential certainty, is one that I always look forward to, even 28\n\nyears after the first time I taught it as a graduate student at Berkeley back\n\nin the spring of 1991.\n\nHow has your relationship to\n\nthe Portuguese-American community in America influenced this anthology?\n\nMy relationship to the\n\nPortuguese-American community in my home region is a multifaceted one, as well\n\nas one that naturally continues to shift and change over time. When I was a\n\nchild, it meant my relationship with the people in my hometown, my classmates\n\nat school, or that with my afterschool piano teacher Mrs. Coutinho who lived\n\nnext door to what was then the public library in my hometown. It meant the\n\nPortuguese Feast held at the Holy Ghost Society grounds down the street from my\n\nhouse, or my mother’s friends and colleagues at Tisbury School, the recipes for\n\nPortuguese soup and sweet bread they shared with her, the same ones that I\n\ncontinue to share with others to this day. When we tell these stories of those\n\nwe knew and cared about, we recognize how much there is to share.\n\nOf course there was also the\n\noccasional television show on WTEV Channel 6 that chronicled the lives and\n\nexperiences of the much larger Portuguese diaspora communities on the mainland,\n\nbut aside from the occasional appearance of a Portuguese-American television\n\nactress like Karen Valentine on the show Room 222, or the hits of the New Bedford-based\n\nCape Verdean musical group Tavares as they became part of mainstream popular\n\nculture, we still lived a relatively insular cultural existence when it came to\n\nthe role of Portuguese-American culture in everyday life. I grew up in this\n\ncommunity, and always considered myself a part of it as so many others did,\n\nregardless of ethnicity. In college and graduate school, my interests may have\n\nbroadened to the Portuguese language alongside other world languages and\n\nliteratures, as well as literary and cultural theory, but it was my continuing\n\ninterest in Portuguese-American literature and culture that would eventually be\n\nwhat brought me back to southeastern Massachusetts after being hired to teach\n\nat UMass Dartmouth in 2007.\n\nNowadays, that I find myself\n\nonce again settling in here, I might also mention grateful I am to have found a\n\nnew home in East Providence, Rhode Island, in a solidly Azorean-American\n\nneighbourhood, something that, while a point of departure for many in our\n\nacademic field, is not always part of their everyday lived experience. I feel\n\nlucky to live in a completely bilingual environment both at home and at work,\n\nwhether with my neighbors, at local businesses, or with my advanced students,\n\nwho also teach and play important roles in their local communities. This fully\n\nbilingual environment of culture, education and community is one that I hope\n\nall Portuguese-Americans will be able to enjoy as we continue current projects\n\nof cultural agency such as those at Tagus Press and the Disquiet program.\n\nWhy did your trip to the\n\nAzores, when you and Tagus Press received a grant from FLAD to take your PhD\n\nstudents to the Azores, become vital to Behind the Stars, More Stars?\n\nYou mention you went to São Miguel (including the University of the Azores),\n\nFaial and Pico….\n\nSpending time with graduate\n\nand undergraduate students is always an important part of my work, but it would\n\nbe difficult if not impossible to ignore the symbolic importance of the Azores\n\nas a cultural point of origin for my Portuguese-American students and\n\ncolleagues, and maybe even for myself to some extent. I was especially moved by\n\nmy visit to the site of the Capelinhos volcanic eruption, a geological event\n\nthat ended up having much significant political and cultural consequences for\n\nus here in southeastern New England, especially after the passing of the\n\nPastore-Kennedy Act, also known as the Azorean Refugee Act of 1958, which\n\nallowed countless thousands of Azoreans and Portuguese to immigrate to the\n\nregion, changing its cultural landscape for years to come, including the one I\n\nwas born into and grew up in.\n\nHaving dinner in Horta at\n\nthe house of the cousin of one of my students was another unforgettable\n\nexperience, one that underscored the importance of food and hospitality to this\n\ntransatlantic culinary culture we share. Equally important, however, were the\n\nreadings from Portuguese-American literature that students completed before the\n\nstart of the trip, which allowed them to interpret the landscape and culture\n\nfrom a distinct but no less valid diasporic perspective and which gave a more\n\nnuanced frame of reference to our cultural discussions.\n\nAfter this shared experience\n\nof reconnecting to a broad set of cultural commonplaces, signs and symbols, it\n\nwas all the more gratifying to visit our counterparts at the University of the\n\nAzores, where I gave a lecture on Portuguese-American literature assisted by my\n\ndoctoral student Maggie Felisberto before Prof. Vamberto Freitas and a room\n\nfull of Azorean students interested in Portuguese-American culture. The\n\nadministrators we met were pleasantly surprised that our students were unlike\n\nmost from the US, as ours were already fluent in Portuguese, with no need for\n\nour hosts to speak English. Ultimately, promoting this kind of effective\n\ncultural diplomacy, whether by way of greater functional bilingualism or\n\nincreased\n\ncultural literacy, as this\n\ntransnational cultural dialogue continues to evolve, is a commitment that I now\n\nknow these students are committed to carrying forward, be it as educators,\n\nresearchers, translators, and yes, published authors.\n\nDo you find Azorean\n\nliterature has a different sensibility than the mainland? How does this play\n\nout in Portuguese American literature?\n\nSometimes it does, but\n\ntraces of what some might consider insular mindset can be found in continental\n\nauthors, just as certain commonplaces from one corner of the Lusophone world\n\nresurface elsewhere. So while some might make a case for Azorean literature\n\nbeing separate and distinct from continental Portuguese literature, much as\n\nmany cultural critics may highlight the differences between, say,\n\nPortuguese-American and Luso-Canadian cultural production, I am more interested\n\nin how these different points of departure criss-cross, interact and dialogue\n\nwith one another, exploring the commonalities that allow us to imagine\n\nourselves in ever- greater community with one another.\n\nYou expand our understanding\n\nof the diaspora by publishing Goan and Cabo Verdean, female and LGBTQ+ writers,\n\nwith this anthology and your work at the press. How did this become part of\n\nyour work?\n\nLike so many of my\n\ncolleagues at UMass Dartmouth, we have always placed a high value on creating\n\nan educational experience that is sensitive to the needs and academic interests\n\nof a wide range of students, both inside and outside of the local\n\nPortuguese-American community. My own PhD students have written on women in\n\nAzorean literature and domestic violence towards women in Portuguese literature\n\nand culture. My MA students have done excellent work on local Portuguese-American\n\nculture, but also on Cape Verdean diasporic culture as well. I am fortunate to\n\nhave the unique opportunity to work in a department and program that prizes and\n\nencourages recognition of the specific cultural milieu that makes our teaching\n\nand research possible.\n\nMy research over the last\n\ntwenty-odd years has always been concerned with questions of transcultural\n\nunderstandings of gender and sexuality, both in the Portuguese-speaking world,\n\nparticularly Brazil, but also in a wide range of other global cultural and\n\nlinguistic contexts, from Quebec to Argentina and from Central Europe to India\n\nand the Far East. I want to encourage this kind of transcultural discussion and\n\nresearch on gender and sexual diversity, both in local Portuguese-American\n\nculture and in a broader transnational and Lusodiasporic framework.\n\nAround the time I began work\n\nin Portuguese at UMass Dartmouth, a new set of research opportunities had\n\nalready begun opening up for me that took all over the world, to places where\n\nPortuguese culture came into contact with others. At the same time that I\n\nreturned to places like Portugal, Brazil and Macau, I had the chance to add new\n\nexperiences in Mozambique (2006), Cape Verde (2008), Goa (2009), Melaka (2010)\n\nand finally the Azores for the first time on a quick stopover in 2011, right\n\nbefore beginning FLAD-funded research on Goa in Lisbon and attending the\n\nDisquiet program. So all of these experiences, while they may seem separate and\n\nperhaps even irreconcilably different to others, still seem intertwined, and in\n\nfact, inextricable\n\nfrom one another to me, and\n\nI can only hope that this collection of new writing will encourage others in\n\nthe community to draw these same connections, boht in their intellectual life,\n\ntheir travels and intercultural contacts and in their everyday lived experience\n\nof cultural and ethnic identity as something beautifully complex and always\n\nsubject to some measure of reconfiguration.\n\nThis anthology represents\n\nthe relationship you have forged between Tagus Press and Disquiet International\n\nLiterary Program in Lisbon. What excites you the most?\n\nWhat excites me most in any\n\nliterary project I have been part of is encouraging new voices to emerge and\n\ndevelop over time. What excites me the most long-term is awaiting new work by\n\nboth well-established and newer authors: Frank X. Gaspar’s latest book, due to\n\nbe out with Tagus sometime this year, for example, as well as other featured\n\nauthors who are currently debuting full-length literary works. I also remain\n\npassionate about contributing to and sharing some of the latest academic\n\nresearch on this community as reflected in its literature and culture,\n\nesepecially that scholarship edited and published at UMass Dartmouth in the\n\nlatest issue of our academic journal due out this spring. As Lead Editor of\n\nthis issue, this is without a doubt another exciting development for me (PLCS\n\nNo 32, Luso-American Literatures and Cultures Today). For the time\n\nbeing, however, especially as this volume of new Luso-American writing goes to\n\npress, one sure to be a new point of contact and discussion with participants\n\nand alumni of the Disquiet program, I feel I already have more than enough to\n\nbe excited about.\n\nInterview with Oona Patrick\n\nYou’ve written essential\n\nsurveys of Portuguese literature, incisively about Lisbon, exquisitely about\n\nProvincetown from the Portuguese point of view. Behind the Stars, More Stars\n\nis yet another touchstone of this calibre. Why did you decide to edit this\n\nanthology at this point in your career?\n\nAs Doris Lessing said, \"Do\n\nit now. The conditions are always impossible.\" Taking this on in 2015 when\n\nChris Larkosh (co-editor) approached me with the idea was like the leap into\n\nbeginning the Disquiet International Literary Program in Lisbon in 2010- I\n\ncouldn’t pass it up. Having the support of Tagus Press behind the collection,\n\nespecially from executive editor Mario Pereira, made it all worthwhile.\n\nAt Disquiet, I love to\n\nintroduce writers to each other, and this collection is about making\n\nintroductions. It’s a small sample from only the first five years of the\n\nprogram. We wanted to create a snapshot of a particular time, not an\n\nall-encompassing anthology (hence the deliberate use of \"collection\" in the\n\nsubtitle). There are so many more writers I would have liked to include. I hope\n\nemerging writers, especially, will see that there’s a place for them in this\n\ncrowd, even if they aren’t able to attend Disquiet.\n\nThere are many voices in\n\nthis collection we have not heard from before.\n\nI don’t think I’ll ever\n\nforget one moment during a joint event at FLAD held by Disquiet and the\n\nUniversity of Lisbon’s \"Neither Here Nor There\" conference in 2013. A group of\n\nLusa alums and participants, who’d been noticing how the conference program\n\nreferenced what felt like an overwhelming number of older male writers, huddled\n\nin an aisle to talk. We collaborated on a question about this for the panel of\n\nprominent Luso-American and Luso-Canadian writers scheduled to speak next. We\n\ndecided to ask them to address the \"disparity between the make- up of the\n\nmajority of the emerging Luso-American writers coming through the Disquiet\n\nprogram and the preponderance of white, hetero, male writers currently being\n\npublished, reviewed, and studied in the Luso-American literary world,\" and to\n\npress them on whether they at least thought more women will be published in the\n\nfuture.\n\nAs a shy person who has to\n\nprepare for about a week to do a three-minute introduction, asking that\n\nquestion on behalf of our group was one of the scariest moments of my life. I\n\nbarely got through it, though honestly it was nothing compared to a\n\nProvincetown Town Meeting. The question received flippant or incomplete\n\nanswers, and no one could seem to find any satisfying answer for why publishing\n\nhad been so skewed.\n\nWhat happened next is what\n\nshocked me: late the next morning, I heard that my question had dominated\n\ndiscussion across nearly every workshop at our program. The problems of the\n\nLuso-\n\nAmerican world had\n\nunexpectedly been taken up by a sample of the larger literary community. I’d\n\nnever seen that happen before, and I wondered if this had been what we needed\n\nto do, to risk sharing these problems. Maybe this is what a place at the table\n\nfor Luso-Americans in the literary world would actually look like in the\n\nfuture. I like to think that this book becoming a reality has made good on this\n\nuncomfortable and disquieting moment. To my mind, Behind the Stars is\n\nalso for everybody who was there that year, to whom I just want to say obrigada.\n\nAs I say in the acknowledgments to the book, the vision of our alumni\n\norganizers and activists was a huge part of the inspiration for the collection,\n\nwhich is again only a small step toward a truly representative Luso-American\n\nliterary scene.\n\nDo you mind sharing a bit\n\nabout the Luso Workshop for PAJ Readers who may not be familiar with it?\n\nThe Writing the Luso\n\nExperience Workshop came about because Jeff Parker, co-founder and Director of\n\nDisquiet, requested funding from the Luso-American Development Foundation\n\n(FLAD) specifically for fellowships for Luso-American writers to form a\n\nworkshop of their own at the first Disquiet in 2011. These FLAD fellowships,\n\nalong with partial scholarships for runners-up, have helped make it possible\n\nfor many of our 80 Luso-descendant alumni (which includes those with ties to\n\nany Lusophone country), to take part in Disquiet. So far the workshop has been\n\ntaught by two of the leading Portuguese American writers: Frank X. Gaspar and\n\nKatherine Vaz. This year, which will be its ninth, it will be taught by Chris\n\nArnold, the Brazilian American author of The Third Bank of the River: Power\n\nand Survival in the Twenty-First- Century Amazon, with a visit from Cape\n\nVerdean American poet and Tagus author Jarita Davis. Both are Disquiet alums.\n\nThe Luso workshop was among\n\nthe first of its kind for North American writers with Lusophone-country\n\nheritage. It’s also been special because it’s not part of an exclusively Luso-\n\nAmerican academic conference or event-there’s cross-pollination with writers,\n\neditors, translators, and publishers from all backgrounds.\n\nThe majority of the non-Luso\n\nparticipants at Disquiet are new to Portugal, and may not have had previous\n\ninterest in Lusophone literature, but we find that Lisbon works its magic fast\n\nand has changed that for good for many of our 700 alumni.\n\nHow has inspiring an\n\nemergent voice affected your own writing?\n\nMeeting all those other\n\nLuso-descendant writers at Disquiet broadened my perspective on Luso-American\n\ncommunities like the one I grew up in. It gave me a big-picture view of what I\n\nwas writing about in my memoir of my hometown, a community that has undergone\n\npainful changes recently-changes that threatened to pit one minority group\n\nagainst another in conflict over the many meanings of a tiny place.\n\nI’ve also been inspired by a\n\nlot of activist spirits like yourself who’ve pushed me to do more with my\n\nwriting than I would have dared without this backing, especially when it comes\n\nto writing about class and various kinds of discrimination. I still sit in on\n\nthe workshop at Disquiet whenever I can; it reconnects me to a kind of\n\ncollective Luso-American voice, and to voices beyond that definition. I know of\n\nno other space like it and I have learned an incredible amount from everyone\n\nwho’s come through it.\n\nWhat changes have you seen\n\nsince Disquiet began?\n\nMore people are pursuing\n\nwriting and not giving up, and this is crucial. The Luso workshop has gifted\n\nmany of us the colleagues we need to help us persevere in the long\n\nhaul-countering that pernicious myth that writers work only in isolation. Frank\n\nX. Gaspar encouraged us to try to publish outside the niche we thought we were\n\nconfined to, which made us more ambitious, and Katherine Vaz has shown us the\n\nimportance of giving back via teaching and mentorship. By reaching across\n\nborders in the Lusophone world, we’ve had extraordinary opportunities to\n\ncompare experiences, to sense the vastness of our history. We may continue writing\n\nabout our\n\nown small corners of this\n\nworld, but not without some understanding of the reach of the Portuguese\n\nempire, and how horrific it could be.\n\nI vividly remember Anthony\n\nde Sa remarking at a talk that he hadn’t felt the support of his local Portuguese\n\ncommunity at all when he started out, and that’s something we have seen change.\n\nThe heartfelt community response to readings our alumni have put together\n\nacross North America makes me believe that there was already a hunger for our\n\nwork. We’ve had audiences of family and friends who’d never been to a literary\n\nreading before, or who’d never heard someone read a story with them or their\n\ncommunity represented in it. These moments have made everything worth it.\n\nYou mention how your own\n\nwriting experiments with genre, form, and upends taboos, and how this has\n\ninfluenced your sensibility as an editor.\n\nSuch experiments have often\n\nhad a strong association with underrepresented voices forging new tools to talk\n\nabout their lives and approach supressed topics. I love looking at the shape\n\nof prose on the page, and this makes me seek out stories told via the\n\njuxtaposition of fragments and incorporation of found forms. I can also enjoy a\n\ngood bout of alternative punctuation as found in Saramago; all of this, I think,\n\nhas origins in my love of poetry.\n\nMy childhood in\n\nProvincetown, with its layers of communities interacting, influenced me deeply.\n\nOur own community could be stifling, but we lived among so much joy and freedom\n\nand activism that sensibilities mingled. Also, I didn’t grow up Catholic, because\n\nof rebellions and drama in 1910s Provincetown, and I felt separate because of\n\nthat for a long time. All this is to give fair warning: readers should know\n\nbefore they pick up this book that it is not intended for children or those\n\nwith a delicate sensibility. I joke that we’re going to get banned in New\n\nBedford.\n\nDisquiet has begun a new\n\nresidency in the Azores. Do you find that Azorean literature is distinct?\n\nThe Azores are at the heart\n\nof my experience of Portugal, both because that’s where my family roots are,\n\nand because I believe what Vamberto Freitas (an essential Azorean literary\n\ncritic and scholar) pointed out to me: that you could see the Azores everywhere\n\nin Provincetown. I’d grown up in a kind of antique mirror of island life in a\n\nmostly Portuguese American town that was quite isolated for most of the year.\n\nWhen I first saw the Azores, I felt like I finally understood Provincetown.\n\nAzorean literature does seem\n\nto have distinct concerns, which have special appeal to Americans (immigration,\n\nrebellion, independence, insularity, discrimination). The islands are tied to\n\nsome of our greatest literature, Melville’s work, among others. They’re also\n\nthe site of America’s oldest continuously-operating consulate, because Portugal\n\nwas among the very first countries in the world to recognize the U.S. after the\n\nAmerican Revolution. Americans traveling to Portugal for the first time always\n\nask me if they should go to Lisbon or Porto-I tell them to stop in the Azores.\n\nThere’s something poignant\n\nto me about a place that periodically comes on the world stage, usually because\n\nof its strategic location, and then drops from view, so much so that until\n\nrecently many Americans didn’t know the archipelago’s name. Voices persisting\n\nin an overlooked geography are so interesting to me. There’s also the\n\nastounding natural beauty- though I know from Cape Cod that behind every\n\nextreme or mythologized landscape there’s some tough living, too: start with\n\nJoão de Melo’s novels if you want to learn more.\n\nDo you have advice for people\n\nadvocating for their own literary communities? For those of us breaking\n\nsilence?\n\nIt begins with building\n\nnumbers and growing the internal connections, so that there’s a group\n\namplifying one another from many directions, not one person. At least from my\n\nexperience of Luso-American communities, this requires a shift from a very\n\nnatural focus on small, exclusive groups of close friends and family, or\n\nso-called strong ties, to opening oneself to also having \"loose ties\" in\n\nlarger, more inclusive communities, including social media networks. It also\n\ntakes keeping in mind that other people’s successes do not detract from your\n\nown-they can help an entire community: others have paved the way for all of us.\n\nAs for the courage to break\n\nsilence, there’s nothing like a look back at the past, at the Three Marias, for\n\nexample, or at the sound-proofed typewriter you told me about in Lisbon’s\n\nAljube Museum of Resistance and Freedom.\n\nI picture the rooms where we\n\nhold Disquiet workshops in Lisbon’s historic Centro Nacional de Cultura, where\n\nthe number 28 streetcar rumbles and screeches on the street below every fifteen\n\nminutes or so, making it difficult to hear people speak. As most Disquieters\n\nlearn in their first few days, the artists and writers who met in those same\n\nrooms before the overthrow of the dictatorship in 1974 famously took advantage\n\nof these moments when the secret police couldn’t eavesdrop to switch from\n\ninnocuous artistic discussions to whispered plans for revolution.\n\nWhen the tram passed during\n\nthe Luso workshop we’d pause and joke about conspiring too, in our own ways.\n\nPoetry, prose, critique-Let’s change this world! Burn it all down! Pass it\n\non!– poetry, prose, critique. There’s an alternate story just out of\n\nearshot that’s someday going to become louder.\n\nFor me, that rhythm is like\n\nwriting essays: you listen for the whispered story you’re telling yourself in\n\nsecret, inlaid in odd details and inexplicable metaphors and rooms you keep\n\nrevisiting.\n\nThat clandestine Lisbon\n\nrhythm is something we carry home in our bones, a growing resonance.\n\n*\n\n\"Originally published by Portuguese American Journal, April 2019\""
