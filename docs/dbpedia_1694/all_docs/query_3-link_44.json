        "text": "1 Session: Sunday, August 11\n\n1:00-4:00pm ET\n\nKyle Dillon Hertz\n\nThis craft course is led by Kyle Dillon Hertz, author of The Lookback Window, which was longlisted for the VCU Cabell First Novelist Prize, and was a New York Times Editors' Choice. Vanity Fair named The Lookback Window one of the best novels of 2023. His work can be found in Esquire, Freeman’s, Time, and elsewhere. He received his MFA from NYU and a residency from Yaddo. He teaches at The New School.\n\nIn this seminar, we will examine the myriad appearances of intimacy in fiction. What are all the different ways that writers have used intimacy to create a profound sense of being? When we write, we want to reach the reader, and we do this through exploring the opposing forces of mind and body in literature. Through characters thinking, touching, wanting, fighting one another. So how do the greats do this? And how can we use as many of these techniques in our work as possible? We will examine passages from Patricia Highsmith's Carol, Raven Leilani's Luster, and Andrew Holleran's The Beauty of Men, among other writers.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nWriters will leave the class with numerous methods of intimacy. We will look at twenty different examples of such literary techniques, and you will be able to apply them to your own work.\n\nWriters will look closely at the work of Raven Leilani, Patricia Highsmith, and Andrew Holleran.\n\nWriters will have a chance to think about their own work and have a q&a about it at the end of class."
