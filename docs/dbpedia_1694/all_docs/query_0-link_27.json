        "text": "Rutgers University–Newark alumna Marina Carreira (MFA ’14), a queer Luso-American writer and multimedia artist raised in the Ironbound section of Newark, was recently one of four writers awarded a 2024 DISQUIET Luso-American Fellowship.\n\nThe prestigious literary prize, given annually to writers of Portuguese descent from North America by Dzanc Books and the Luso-American Development Foundation, provides publication and a full-tuition scholarship to attend the DISQUIET International Literary Program in Lisbon, Portugal, a two-week summer program that brings writers from North America and around the world together with Portuguese writers for intensive writing workshops in that country's capital city.\n\nThe twelfth annual program, to be held June 23-July 5, takes its inspiration from The Book of Disquiet by heralded Lisbon poet Fernando Pessoa; from the city of Lisbon itself; and from the late Portuguese poet Alberto de Lacerda, who believed above all in the importance of literary community. In winning the award, Carreira is following in the footsteps of several MFA alumni, including former winner Ananda Lima and ex-finalists Paula Neves and Hugo Dos Santos.\n\nA Pushcart Prize nominee, Carreira is the author of Desgracada (Bottlecap Press, 2023), Tanto Tanto (Cavankerry Press, 2022), Save the Bathwater (Get Fresh Books, 2018), and I Sing To That Bird Knowing It Won't Sing Back (Finishing Line Press, 2017). She has exhibited her art at the Newark Museum, Morris Museum, ArtFront Galleries, Monmouth University Center for the Arts, among others. Carreira was honored in 2021 as the City of Newark's LGBTQ Pride Champion for her work in LGBTIQ+ advocacy and mutual aid. She works as an administrator in higher education and teaches Women and Gender Studies at Kean University. Find her on Instagram and Tik Tok at @savethebathewater.\n\nWe recently sat down with Carreira to discuss this latest award.\n\nWhen did you first find out about this fellowship, and what was your initial response to the news?\n\nI have known about this fellowship for many years now, learning about it from other Luso-American poet friends who attended and raved about it. And every year, I yearned to be part of DISQUIET, but work, motherhood and financial challenges always prohibited me. I'm in a really good place in my life right now, and decided to give it a shot and apply. When I read the acceptance email, I literally cried. This fellowship means so much to me.\n\nWhen I read the acceptance email, I literally cried. This fellowship means so much to me.\n\nWhat does it mean for you to be going back to Portugal and Lisbon?\n\nI spent every summer of childhood and adolescence in Nazare and Fanhais—a small village near Nazare—with my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. I was in Portugal last year, a wonderful two weeks on the beach with my books. To be returning again this year, as a student and writer in Lisbon, means that I will indulge in all the coffee and sweets and fado and color and poetry of this glorious city. I am most looking forward to workshopping with my cohort, working on my next collection of poems, having deep conversations about art and literature, and meeting Katherine Vaz, Jose Luis Peixoto, and other amazing faculty members that I know will rock my little Luso world with their wisdom.\n\nWhat will you work on during the two-week workshop?\n\nI have a project—a collection of poems centered around queer first-generation women's landscapes and collective dreamscapes—that I'm hoping to start fleshing out via this fellowship. I'm certain that the conversations and workshops with my fellows and faculty will not only inspire me to consider all the spaces that \"othered\" women inhabit but urge me to dig deep into the complexities of these spaces as they relate to the current state of womanhood in 2024 America. I also plan to eat as many pasteis de nata as possible, catch a fado in a little taverna, and just delight in all the street art and architecture of my homeland's capital.\n\nWhat does it mean personally and professionally to have won this prize?\n\nProfessionally, it is extremely validating to be a recipient of the Luso-American Fellowship. Winning this prestigious prize enhances my reputation within the poetry/literary world and demonstrates earned respect and recognition from peers, colleagues and other writers. I feel like this prize will also open doors to new opportunities as well as help expand my network. Personally, winning this prize is proof for my 12-year-old self that my stories matter and have a place in the canon. My inner-child dream come true.\n\nAny final thoughts?\n\nI would be unable to participate in this fellowship were it not for the tremendous and loving support of my parents, who will be caretaking my children during my stay in Lisbon. My parents have been my biggest allies, and I just want to publicly thank them and tell them I love them muito, muito. Big shout-out to my children Amalia and Simone, my partner Sam, my sister Suzy and my ride-or-dies (Emiley, Lynne, Tina, Liz, Toma, Kat, Ysabel), as well as the presses who have brought my collections to life: Get Fresh Publishing, Cavankerry Press, Finishing Line Press, and Bottlecap Press. And of course, a HUGE thank you to the folks at DISQUIET."
