        "text": "The data analytics concentration will arm you with a high-demand skill set—the ability to analyze, manipulate and draw inferences from large data sets. This rising discipline requires practitioners with know-how that cuts across core business disciplines and well-developed critical thinking and communication skills, which are deeply informed by context.\n\nThe data analytics concentration must be coupled with a primary concentration within the business administration major. The primary concentrations are:\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nFinancial analysis\n\nHuman resources management\n\nManagement information systems\n\nMarketing\n\nOperations and supply chain management\n\nYou receive both the theoretical and practical knowledge essential to applying advanced business data analytics methods and models to a diverse set of business topics and challenges across these functional concentrations in our program.\n\nFor full curricular plan and course descriptions, refer to the undergraduate catalog.\n\nA student’s degree requirements are determined by the year they begin as a matriculated student at UB. There are sometimes slight curricular adjustments from year to year. Therefore, students should always refer to their academic advisement report located in their HUB student center for their specific degree requirements in consultation with their academic advisor."
