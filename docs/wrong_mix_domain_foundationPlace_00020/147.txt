The Rotary Club of San Francisco, entrusted with many bequests over the long years of its history, created The San Francisco Rotary Foundation in 1959. Today, the San Francisco Rotary Foundationâs endowment of more than $5 million serves as the financial bedrock for the many service projects of the Rotary Club of San Francisco.

Our service projects usually come under the seven Areas of Focus identified by Rotary International:

Promoting peace.

Fighting disease.

Providing clean water, sanitation, and hygiene.

Saving mothers and children.

Supporting education.

Growing local economies.

Supporting the environment.

The San Francisco Rotary Foundation supports the programs that our Club members care about and guarantees that these two primary hallmarks of a successful project are met:

Providing opportunities for hands-on service for our members.

Assuring that our dollars make a difference.

Bringing publicity to the Rotary Club of San Francisco.

The San Francisco Rotary Foundation encourages Club members to recommend specific ways we can help our neighbors both near and far, and amplifies our impact by partnering with other Rotary Clubs around the world.

The selfless support of Club members and friends helps the Foundation thrive through both smooth and challenging economic times. Your generosity has made the San Francisco Rotary Foundation a major force for good across the globe. You can see more information about the projects the San Francisco Rotary Foundation currently supports here. The Foundation also serves as trustee for more than $500,000 distributed to the University of San Francisco pursuant to a trust established by the late Club member, Scharleen Colant.
