Symptoms

Assume that you changed the location of a personal folder in Windows, such as Documents or Downloads, and mapped the folder to another personal folder. When you try to change the location of the folder again, the operation fails.

For example:

If the personal folder was mapped to a personal folder in the OneDrive folder on the computer, the following error message is received:

Can't move the folder because there is a folder in the same location that can't be redirected. Access is denied.
