It would be nice to save the game in the same location i chose to install the game, so that my 256 GB hard drive isn't eaten up with junk. I have it set up as a small ssd boot drive with storage on larger HDDs. I played less than an hour the other day, and the auto saves are up to 155 MB. Doesn't seem like a lot, but when you're reserving that space for OS stuff, it makes a big difference. Thank you for your consideration.",
