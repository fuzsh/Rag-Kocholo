You should have received an email prompting you to reset your password. This link will ask for your email address and will send an email with a link to enter and confirm a new password. Please check your spam and junk folders to see if filtering options directed the reset email there.\n\nSometimes the password reset email gets blocked by the schoolâ€™s firewall. In these cases, it cannot be accessed in the spam folder either. If you need to reset your password, you can always email: contact@jasonfoundation.com or you can call us at: 615-264-2323. Additionally, so that you, and your colleagues, do not continue to have this problem in the future, please let your school IT department know that you are not receiving the password reset emails and ask them to whitelist jasonfoundation.com.\n\nThe modules will not allow a user to mark complete if there was any skipping during the play of the video. If the video does skip, a solution would be to refresh the video and allow it to play in its entirety. Once the video has played through, it will allow you to mark complete."
