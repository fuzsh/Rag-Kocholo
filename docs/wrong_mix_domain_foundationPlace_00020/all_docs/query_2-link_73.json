Visit motorcyclesafetyca.com or call them at (877) 743-3411\n\nIf your training occurred prior to April 18, 2003 you will need to take another course to obtain a new completion card.\n\nIf your hands-on class requires the completion of an MSF eCourse, the Basic RiderCourse eHandbook or 3Wheel Basic RiderCourse eHandbook (both available for purchase on Amazon’s Kindle store in English, Spanish, and Korean) may not be required. Once you complete your eCourse, it is unlocked and can be used as an interactive digital reference book. You can purchase your own copy through the Amazon Kindle store, but it isn’t necessary to study it or make notes prior to attending class. The pace and content of your in-person class dovetails with the material covered in your eCourse.\n\nHowever, we can offer two booklets on our website that anyone is free to print out for themselves and their fellow riders:\n\nYou and Your Motorcycle Riding Tips (basic riding tips and exercises riders can set up themselves in a parking lot; often included with new motorcycles from the major manufacturers)\n\nMotorcycle Operator Manual (study guide used in most states in the U.S. for those preparing for the written portion of their DMV/BMV motorcycle licensing test)\n\nWe are glad to hear of your interest in promoting motorcycle safety. We have several self-contained curriculum products that can be taught by anyone, especially motorcycle enthusiasts and others who are concerned with traffic safety. Whether you’re a riding club leader, a schoolteacher, or just someone who enjoys the sport of motorcycling, you’ll find it rewarding to present our curricula to your peers, your students, or your community. Visit our online store to purchase the following safety kits:\n\nIntersection: Motorist Awareness Kit\n\nIntersection is MSF’s approach to enhancing motorist awareness of motorcycles. The program combines personal stories and character development with a dramatic look at a crash scene that’s all too common. The DVD contains three separate 13-minute versions to appeal to teens (via driver education classes), adults (via traffic schools), and commercial drivers (via employee orientation). Includes Leader’s Guide and ten Participant’s Guides.\n\nShare the Adventure: Group Riding Kit\n\nThis kit is essentially a group ride training event in a box. The video kit contains the MSF Guide to Group Riding video (16 minutes) and handbooks for a class of ten students. You’ll learn about ride preparation, standards for organization of the ride, and important knowledge such as proper formations in complex traffic situations.\n\nThe MSF cannot make specific recommendations regarding which motorcycle a rider should purchase. Riders may wish to consult with peers and dealership personnel, and research manufacturer publications (brochures and websites) and enthusiast magazines for reviews and recommendations.\n\nChoose a bike that is the right size and fit for you, especially as a beginner. You want to make sure that the motorcycle controls are within easy reach of your hands and feet. When seated on the bike and stopped, you want to be able to put your feet down and reach the ground to support the motorcycle. Also consider your size and strength and the comfort of the bike’s seating position.\n\nBe aware that some manufacturers note in their publications that certain sport-bike models are intended for experienced riders.\n\nThe MSF strongly recommends that you take a Basic RiderCourse in your area, to decide if motorcycling is right for you, to prepare you for riding in traffic, and to secure a waiver for all or part your state’s motorcycle operator’s licensing test, if applicable.\n\nPure statistics do not tell the whole story of motorcycle safety. Generally speaking, motorcyclists – as well as bicyclists and pedestrians — are more vulnerable than other roadway users to injury in traffic collisions since they don’t have the advantage of being cocooned within 3,000 pounds of steel. That’s why the Motorcycle Safety Foundation strongly encourages motorcyclists to minimize the risk by riding responsibly, wearing protective gear, taking a hands-on rider training course, getting licensed, riding within their personal limits, and riding free of alcohol or other drugs (note that 31 percent of motorcyclists who died in crashes were impaired). In our RiderCourses and in our safety publications, we stress the need to learn and use effective mental strategies such as SEE: Search, Evaluate, Execute. This strategy helps riders manage risk by detecting and avoiding potentially hazardous traffic situations. Some riders also use the strategy of assuming they’re invisible to other motorists, because other motorists may not be on the lookout for motorcycles. Wearing brightly colored protective apparel helps increase visibility, and frequent inspection of the motorcycle helps decrease the likelihood of a crash due to mechanical failure. The maneuverability and small size of a motorcycle can be used in some situations to avoid crashes. While there are many steps a motorcyclist can take to reduce risk, it can never be eliminated. More than 9,000,000 American motorcyclists enjoy the sport, and the trend is that more and more people are turning to motorcycles as a practical, efficient and enjoyable form of personal transportation.\n\nIf you haven’t ridden before, we suggest that you and your spouse/parent/whoever take our Basic RiderCourse and use that as a basis for discussion of the risks and rewards of motorcycling, before making a decision to purchase a motorcycle.\n\nOur permission policy depends on how much you want to reprint. Brief excerpts just require that you attribute the text to Motorcycle Safety Foundation, and you do not need to ask us for permission. Large portions require a license agreement.
