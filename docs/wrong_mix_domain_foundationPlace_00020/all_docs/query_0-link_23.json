Largely funded by individual donors, our donor base is as diverse as the community we serve. From donor advised grants to planned giving, we hope to provide our donors with impactful giving opportunities.\n\nAs an exclusively volunteer-run organization, we are able to dedicate a vast majority of donor funds directly back into our programs such as our scholarships, grants, and fellowship program."
