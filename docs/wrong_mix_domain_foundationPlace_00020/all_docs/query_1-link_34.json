Our Foundation accepts proposals on an invite-only basis and does not accept unsolicited proposals.\n\nFunding\n\nFunding for ABH | The Foundation has come through various donations including, most notably, the legacy of Dr. Eduard Boeckmann, a man remembered for his charitable contributions to medicine and unimpeachable character to practice, and for the development of surgical catgut treated with pyoktanin. The manufacture and proceeds from this suture were donated to the Ramsey County Medical Society to support and cover the expense of a medical library. Following the library's closing, these funds were transferred to the Boeckmann Fund maintained today by ABH | The Foundation."
