        "text": "To make file system resources readily available to your project, you can connect to folders on a local or network computer. You can connect to as many folders as you need.\n\nYou can connect to folders at any level of your operating system directory structure as in the following examples:\n\nC:\\ (the root level of the drive)\n\nC:\\MyData\\USA\n\nC:\\MyData\\USA\\Boundaries\\Generalized\n\nFrom a folder connection, you can access content within the folder and its subfolders. For example, from a folder connection to C:\\MyData, you can browse to C:\\MyData\\USA or C:\\MyData\\USA\\Boundaries.\n\nBy default, folder connections display only the name of the folder to which you connect, not the complete path. You can change this behavior in the catalog browsing options. You can also alias folder connections to give them useful display names.\n\nTip:\n\nOn the Computer tab of the Catalog pane, you can browse to content without making a folder connection.\n\nConnect to an existing folder\n\nWhen you connect to a folder, you can create and access items in that location without browsing through the entire folder structure.\n\nOpen the Add Folder Connection browse dialog box in any of the following ways:\n\nIn the browse dialog box, browse to and select one or more folders on your local computer or a network computer. Alternatively, type or paste the full path to the folder in the Name text box.\n\nYou must select folders, drives, or other locations in the contents window on the right side of the browse dialog box, not the navigation window on the left.\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe folder connection appears in the Folders container in the Catalog pane and the Contents pane of a catalog view.\n\nYou can also connect to a folder using the following methods:\n\nCreate a folder in the project\n\nYou can create a folder within an existing folder connection in your project.\n\nCreate a folder by any of the following methods.\n\nThe folder is created with a default name. The name is immediately editable.\n\nType a new name for the folder and press the Enter key.\n\nThe folder is updated with the new name and appears in its catalog location.\n\nCreate a folder in My Content\n\nYou can create a folder in the My Content collection of your active portal if you are signed in and have the privilege to create, update, and delete content. You can also rename and delete folders. You can't create folders inside other folders, or move or copy items between folders.\n\nYour portal content is accessible as long as you are signed in. However, folders in My Content are not folder connections. ArcGIS Pro doesn't index their content, for example, nor can you alias them.\n\nCreate a folder in My Content by either of the following methods:\n\nA new folder is created with a default name. The name is immediately editable.\n\nType a new name for the folder and press the Enter key.\n\nThe folder is updated with the new name and appears in My Content.\n\nAdd a folder to your project favorites\n\nIf you use the same folder in many projects, you can make it a favorite. A favorite can be added to any project from the Favorites tab of the Catalog pane or the Favorites container in the Contents pane of a catalog view. If your user profile supports roaming, favorite folders will be available on every computer you use.\n\nYou can create folders that are automatically made favorites. These folders are stored by default in the Favorites folder in your roaming profile.\n\nWhen you add a favorite folder to a project, it is added as a folder connection.\n\nTip:\n\nYou can make a folder a favorite by dragging it from its location in the Catalog pane, the Contents pane of a catalog view, or File Explorer to the Favorites tab of the Catalog pane or the Favorites container in the Contents pane of a catalog view.\n\nIndexing considerations\n\nBy default, ArcGIS Pro indexes the content of folder connections on local drives to make it searchable. Making a folder connection to the root level of a drive may significantly increase the time that indexing tasks take to complete. If you do make a connection to the root node of a disk, such as C:\\, the following folders, if present, are not indexed:\n\nProgram Files\n\nProgram Files (x86)\n\nProgramData\n\nWindows\n\nFolder connections to network locations are not indexed by default. Indexing network locations may significantly increase the time that indexing tasks take to complete.\n\nLearn more about indexing projects"
