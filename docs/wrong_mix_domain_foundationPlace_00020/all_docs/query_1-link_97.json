        "text": "When I lost my own son to gun violence a few years ago, the process of making funeral arrangements, writing a victim impact statement, trying to understand how to move forward without my child, was extremely hard for me, especially because I was doing these things alone. It was this experience that led me to start the BELL Foundation.\n\nI started the BELL Foundation with the intention of supporting parents who have lost a child to gun violence. I wanted to offer compassion and support in any way I could. Whether that be a phone call, going to lunch and lending a listening ear, or going to court to support through giving the victim impact statement. These are but just a few things I hope to provide for other grieving parents as they make their way in the world after tragedy.\n\nAnother reason I was compelled to start this nonprofit was because I want to help educate young people on gun safety and violence in the hopes of preventing more senseless crimes.\n\nI founded the BELL Foundation with the intention of supporting parents who have lost children due to gun violence. I feel it is important to offer compassionate support to these people from the perspective of someone who can empathize with the true grief of it all. Therefore, the BELL Foundation understands and holds a space to offer support for grieving or burdened parents fighting to keep their children safe from gun violence. The BELL Foundation offers love and support in many ways for victims and their families of gun violence."
