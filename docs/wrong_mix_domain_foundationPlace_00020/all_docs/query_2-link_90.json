The fee is $100 per semester for full-time students and $50 per semester for part-time students. In cases of financial hardship, individual students may have the fee waived.\n\nA Committee for Academic Technology Services (CATS) was formed in 2013 to coordinate the use of STF resources. This committee focuses on technological resources directly used by students, such as computers, software, networks, and internet access. Their recommendations prioritize supplementing institutional support, supporting general technology resources before specific ones, prioritizing direct student access over mediated access, and investing in academic or instructional technologies before non-academic ones. They also emphasize maintaining and upgrading existing resources before investing in new ones, while encouraging seeking funding from various sources.\n\nStudent Technology Fee Project 2022 – 2023\n\nStudent Technology Fee Project 2021 – 2022\n\nStudent Technology Fee Project 2020 – 2021\n\nStudent Technology Fee Project 2019 – 2020\n\nPursuing your education while balancing work, family and other responsibilities can be challenging, but you’re not alone; we’re here for you.
