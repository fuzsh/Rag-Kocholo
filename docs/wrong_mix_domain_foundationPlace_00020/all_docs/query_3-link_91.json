The joy, comfort and happiness that comes to a family adopting a rescued pet inspires us to continue our work.\n\nThings to know before you apply:\n\nWe are based in the St. George UT area and focus on local adoptions\n\nWe will verify home ownership via county records; if renting we will verify if pets are allowed\n\nWe encourage those 24+ and ready to make this life-long commitment to apply\n\nClick here to complete an adoption application.\n\nSay hello to Felix! This beautiful brown tabby boy is now living the good life in his forever home. He surely hit the jackpot with his new family but it wasn’t an easy journey for him. You see, Felix was found as a stray and ended up in a local shelter here in Washington County. Like most cats, changes in their environment can be really, really stressful. And Felix wasn’t a fan of his new digs. Everything was new – smells, sights, sounds - and a bit scary! As a result, he did not like being handled and would lash out because he just didn’t feel safe there. He was at risk of never finding a home. When we took him into our rescue, we placed him into PetSmart where we have all our cats available for adoption. Unfortunately, he didn’t like being there either. So one of our fosters took him home to see what he was really like. Well, in a matter of days he was a new cat! Purring, playing, getting pets, brushes and chin scratches! He finally starting to feel safe so we could see his true purrrsonality shine through! We knew it would be a little harder to adopt out Felix; he was a little older and not in a place where folks could interact with him readily. After about 2 months in foster, a little miracle happened. A family found Felix online on PetFinder.com where thousands of animals are posted from shelters and rescues across the country! And they wanted him! They were looking for an older kitty to keep their older cat, Billy, company. With proper introductions, they became great friends and are enjoying a wonderful life together!\n\nWe rescued Rogue from an apartment where he was crated for far too long every day. We immediately knew he needed us. That need became even more apparent after we took him in. Rogue was young and full of life but was completely unsocialized. He was terrified of men and would growl at them out of fear and distrust. One of our incredibly dedicated fosters met Rogue. For months on end, he sat with Rogue, walked him, hand-fed him, and showed him what it means to be loved. Eventually, Rogue began to trust. Another foster showed Rogue how to live with other dogs. A third showed him the world through hiking, kayaking and bicycling excursions. During his journey, Rogue chewed through four crates and too many toys, harnesses and leashes to count. He was the dog we all loved but no adopter showed interest in him. Five months passed. Rogue still didn't have a home. When an adoption application came in from a mother and her son who were eager to bring Rogue into their lives, we knew it was the perfect fit. Rogue now lives with them and his dog brother in his forever home. He wouldn't have made it without the fosters who set him up for success. Thanks to them, Rogue has learned to love and trust. He's finally home.\n\nThis is Lucky. He was 3 years old. He was owned by a US veteran. Unfortunately, Lucky was not well. We took him for veterinary services, but Lucky was not getting better. We realized his owner was not able to give Lucky the meds he needed in a timely manner. We moved Lucky to a medical foster. Lucky started to improve but only for a while. Two surgeries and many trips to the vet Lucky still was up and down. He received lots of love and steady medications. We were giving vitamin shots several times a week. He started needing fluids more often. It was at one of the trips to the vet that I saw Lucky give up. This boy had fought and smiled for all these months. He wanted to live and we could not find the answer. We took Lucky for ice cream, to the park, bought him the biggest bone we could find. Lucky left us much better and much sadder than we had been before. Lucky will always be a part of Jackson Day Animal Rescue and a part of our hearts.\n\nPolly came to us as a kitten in need of medical help. She had a skin infection and a bad eye infection. We knew we could cure her skin infection but we were not sure we could save her infected eye. While one of our expert fosters and local wonderful vets tried their very best, in the end we could not save her eye. She recovered from surgery quickly and in no time was playing, purring and being a normal sweet, loving, cuddly kitten. Cats, like most animals, are very resilient. And then a wonderful family who already had a one-eyed kitty saw her and fell immediately in love with her! And the rest is history!"
