This gift will continue to bring hope to the children of St. Jude today, tomorrow and beyond.\"\n\nCommon wording for further personalization within the card include:\n\n\"So sorry for your loss.\"\n\n\"Sending love and prayers during this difficult time.\"\n\n\"With deepest sympathy on the loss of (DECEASED NAME GOES HERE)\"\n\nDonations to St. Jude are generally tax deductible.
