        "text": "The SecondMuse Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit advocating for a relational approach to addressing complex problems at scale; called “relational wealth” that recognizes the interconnectedness of our world by prioritizing relationships. Our goal is to inspire ways of thinking and actions to drive societal change at scale rather than unconsciously replicating the status quo.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\n\nWe live in a time of profound contradiction.\n\nDespite the wealth and resources available in the world, instability is increasing, inequality persists, and the natural environment is in crisis. This is because we continue to value economic wealth creation over the well-being of individuals, communities, the environment and the planet, leading to an imbalance in relationships. What would happen if society valued all relationships?\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nWe need to fundamentally rethink wealth.\n\nSecondMuse Foundation’s approach views solving the world's problems through the lens of relationships, leading us to conclude that true change can only be achieved through a radical shift in thinking. And that is exactly what we are pursuing with the concept of \"relational wealth.\" Unlike economic forms of wealth, relational wealth is the foundation for creating a just and prosperous planet for all its inhabitants.\n\nCOLLABORATE WITH US\n\nWE PARTNER WITH OTHERS SEEKING TO DEEPLY UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICS OF CHANGE AND PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE.\n\nOur experience from impact and innovation projects with our partners has shown that working in partnership broadens our ability to create change at scale. We established the SecondMuse Foundation to further research, ideate, convene, and disseminate learnings on relational wealth creation.\n\nJoin us in this endeavor to refine and put relational wealth into practice."
