        "text": "This interactive map includes information on over 1,300 existing regional and city trails located in the state of Florida.\n\nTo find a trail near you, click to center the map on your area, then use the + and - symbols to zoom in and out. Here you can click to find more info on each trail, including the Pinellas Trail, the East Central Regional Trail, the Florida Keys Overseas Heritage Trail, and more.\n\nTrails are color-coded by use. Orange trails are multi-use paved trails. Brown trails are unpaved for hiking, biking, or equestrian use. Blue trails are designated paddling trails.\n\nThe features appearing in this map are compiled from local, state, federal and private agencies and organizations, and hosted at floridadep.gov.\n\nEmbark on your trail adventure with the help of the TrailLink app, providing access to over 40,000 miles of trails waiting to be explored. Wherever you are, the TrailLink app can guide you to nearby trails, making it easier than ever to find your next outdoor adventure.\n\nYou can utilize the app's features to plan your itinerary, save your favorite trails, and keep track of the trails you've explored. Whether you're mapping out your next trip or celebrating your completed trails, the TrailLink app is here to enhance your trail experience and be your trusted companion on the trail.\n\nThe Florida Coast-to-Coast Trail (C2C) was conceived as an ambitious effort to create a continuous paved multi-use trail across the state of Florida from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, the first cross-state trail of its kind in Florida. Upon completion, it will span approximately 250-miles and is currently 88% complete. The trail will link communities between St. Petersburg and Titusville along its entire length, allowing residents and visitors to explore Central Florida by bicycle or foot. The trail links several existing multi-use trails and is managed by a broad range of partnering communities and agencies. The Coast-to-Coast Trail Alliance is coordinated by the Office of Greenways and Trails."
