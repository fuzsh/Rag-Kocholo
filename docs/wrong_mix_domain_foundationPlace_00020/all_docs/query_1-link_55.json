        "text": "Overview\n\nAsset Factories allow users to rubber stamp new assets with certain configurations and content already in place. Asset Factories can be used to create assets from scratch or be based on an existing pre-configured base asset. Cascade CMS comes with seven built-in Default Asset Factories, and additional custom Asset Factories can be created.\n\nAsset Factories and their containers can be configured to be accessible only to selected groups in the Add Content menu. Containers for Asset Factories appear as sub-menus in the Add Content menu. For example, a \"Press Release\" Asset Factory might be filed in a container named \"News\", which would be accessible only to News contributors.\n\nBase Assets\n\nBase assets allow newly-created assets to inherit pre-configured properties. For example, if a page Asset Factory has a base page selected, new pages created using that Asset Factory will inherit the base page's Content Type, block and format assignments, metadata, and content.\n\nFolder Asset Factories with a base folder specified can be used to create entire collections of folders and assets, and links contained in those assets will be resolved relative to the newly-created folder. For example, when creating a new calendar year folder with month pages that link to each other:\n\nYear 1\n\nMonth A\n\nMonth B\n\nYear 2\n\nMonth A1\n\nMonth B1\n\nIf under the Year 1 folder, a page called Month B links to a page called Month A and this folder is the base folder for an Asset Factory, when Year 2 is created, Month B1 will link to Month A1.\n\nNote - To avoid confusing base assets with publishable content, it's advised that base assets be placed in a non-publishable, non-indexable folder separate from folders containing publishable content."
