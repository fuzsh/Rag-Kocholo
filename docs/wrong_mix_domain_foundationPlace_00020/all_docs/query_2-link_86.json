        "text": "1. What are the main goals of the ComPASS Health Equity Research Hubs (Hubs)?\n\nThe Hubs will support the research efforts of their assigned CHESI projects and extend the work of the CCC. The primary responsibilities of the Hubs are to 1) enhance the scientific rigor of their assigned CHESI projects; 2) support effective partner engagement by leveraging a multidisciplinary expert panel; and 3) collaborate with the CCC to provide localized and tailored scientific, technical, and collaborative support based on the needs of their assigned CHESI projects.\n\n2. What is the composition of the ComPASS Consortium?\n\nThe consortium is comprised of the three ComPASS initiatives (described above), the ComPASS Coordination Center (CCC), Community-Led, Health Equity Structural Interventions projects, and the Health Equity Research Hubs as well as the ComPASS Steering Committee. The PDs/PIs and NIH Program Staff will form the ComPASS Steering Committee (SC) immediately following the CCC award. Specifically, the ComPASS Steering Committee will be coordinated and administrated by the CCC and Consortium governance rests with the SC. The SC will work cooperatively and interactively, during all phases to promote collaborations, as well as information and resource sharing across the ComPASS Program.\n\n3. What are the Multidisciplinary Expert Panels (MEPs)?\n\nEach Hub will convene a Multidisciplinary Expert Panel (MEP) that will be comprised of broad scientific, methodological, statistical, and ad hoc CHESI-relevant subject matter experts. MEPs will be integrated within the Hub structure to support all Hub functions and activities and will serve as an integral resource for the Hub’s assigned CHESI projects. Core subject matter expertise will include structural and multilevel intervention study design, sampling and data collection, implementation science, team science, data science, biostatistics and econometrics, community engagement, and health disparities research. Additional expertise will be obtained based on identified needs of the assigned CHESI projects and may come from other Hubs and/or from researchers within and outside the ComPASS Program. Key personnel listed on ComPASS awards, may be named as a member of the MEP (in an attachment which is described in the Multidisciplinary Expert Panel (MEP) Resource section under SF424(R&R) Other Project Information of the NOFO). But keep in mind that naming all individuals for the MEP is not required at the time of application submission.\n\n4. How do the roles of the ComPASS Hubs (UC2) relate to the roles of the Community-led Health Equity Structural Interventions?\n\nThe primary role of the ComPASS Hubs will be to provide tailored scientific, technical, and collaborative support for sustainable community engagement, research capacity building, and training during the implementation and assessment phases of the CHESI projects (Phase II) and will employ strategies that are responsive and adaptive to the needs of the projects and the diverse communities they serve.\n\nThe Hubs will be responsible for connecting their assigned CHESI projects with expertise from relevant sources, including the MEP, other Hubs, the local or national HERAs. CHESI projects will have access to a wide range of scientific and technical expertise within and beyond the ComPASS Program.\n\n5. How do the roles of the ComPASS Hubs (UC2) relate to the roles of the Coordination Center?\n\nThe Hub investigative team will collaborate with the CCC to facilitate scientific progress, data compliance, and reporting of ComPASS activities including the measurement and evaluation of community engagement and health equity practice. In coordination with the CCC, Hubs will leverage, expand, and deploy subject matter expertise from multiple sources, including within the MEP and ComPASS, to provide localized scientific and technical assistance, skills training, and sustainability planning.\n\n6. Will the ComPASS Hubs be responsible for collecting common data elements or any other data?\n\nYes, but it should be noted that the Hubs will have two roles pertaining to common data elements:\n\nThe Hubs will provide CHESI specific data management support and facilitation by developing and/or adapting processes for CHESI investigators to help the investigators execute their specific project data collection (including standardized common data elements), data safety monitoring, data handling, data access, data annotation, data quality assurance, and data sharing, as needed, to ensure effective coordination with the CCC and harmonization across the ComPASS Program.\n\nIn coordination and collaboration with the CCC and other Hubs, each Hub may generate their own data and/or Hub-specific common data elements. This could include data related to ongoing needs, assets, and resource assessments across CHESIs; administrative processes and outcomes; aggregated CHESI project decision science, value of information, and health economic analyses; research capacity building and training activities; and community engagement and health equity metrics.\n\n7. The funding opportunity review criteria noted that clinical trials are not a requirement, is that accurate?\n\nYes, a clinical trial is optional and not required for this funding opportunity.\n\n8. What will the Administrative and Coordinating Unit do?\n\nThe Administrative and Coordinating Unit will provide leadership, expertise, and organizational infrastructure to support the entire scope of Hub activities. This Unit is charged with assuring active, systematic, and responsive engagement with assigned CHESI projects. Examples of responsibilities include, but are not limited to:\n\nProviding leadership, administrative infrastructure, management, and operational support for all Hub activities,\n\nDeveloping a plan for actively engaging with assigned CHESI projects and relevant partners to support their activities and establish the Hub as an accessible, valuable and trustworthy research resource, and\n\nCollaborating with the CCC to ensure efficient, timely, and responsive coordination, communication, and reporting of ComPASS activities, as needed.\n\n9. What will the Research Methods & Data Management Unit do?\n\nThe Research Methods & Data Management Unit will be responsible for collaborating with the assigned CHESI projects to provide tailored scientific support and intervention-related technical guidance for all research activities (including study design and adaptations, as needed; intervention implementation; data collection and management; data quality; data security; data analysis & interpretation; research dissemination).\n\n10. What will the Research Capacity Building and Training Unit do?\n\nThe Research Capacity Building and Training Unit will coordinate, design, and deliver tailored research and training support for their assigned CHESI projects. Based on needs identified throughout the planning, implementation, and assessment phases of the CHESI projects and in collaboration with the CCC, each Hub will leverage, expand, and deploy the subject matter expertise available within their established MEP to provide localized scientific and technical assistance, skills training, and sustainability planning. The activities of this Unit will strengthen the capacity of the CHESI projects to sustainably identify and address the conditions that affect the health and well-being within their local communities.\n\n11. What will the Community Engagement and Health Equity Practice Unit do?\n\nThe Community Engagement and Health EQuity (CEEQ) Practice Unit will provide scientific, technical, and collaborative support for their assigned CHESI projects and liaise with the national, local HERAs, and Hub MEP to facilitate and assess active and meaningful community engagement, research collaboration, and community translation using a health equity lens. By leveraging or expanding their established MEP, activities conducted within this Unit will also seek to ensure sustainability of community-led interventions that are informed by, responsive to, and ultimately serve the individuals and communities most affected by structural inequities. This Unit will also be responsible for designing, implementing, and assessing a mentored CEEQ Scholars Program.\n\n12. What are the expectations regarding the eligibility criteria, number of CEEQ Scholars, and budget allocations for the CEEQ Scholars Program?\n\nThe applicant has flexibility to design the CEEQ Scholars Program as they see fit, while addressing the required elements outlined in RFA-RM-23-012.\n\n13. Will Hubs be distributed across the country geographically?\n\nHub location is not a review criterion.\n\n14. In our application, should we refer to the CHESI projects we think we are best suited to work with, or should we focus on a particular theme(s)?\n\nThe NOFO requests applicants to address the required elements outlined in RFA-RM-23-012 which includes but is not limited to describing the social determinants of health/structural factor theme(s) for which the applicant can serve as a centralized research resource to assigned CHESI projects (see Overview under PHS 398 Research Plan in Section IV. Application and Submission Information). The NOFO does not request applicants refer to or specify specific CHESI projects.\n\n15. What are milestones?\n\nMilestones are intermediate steps towards the completion of concrete goals. They must include clear and quantitative criteria for success. Yearly specific and quantitative milestones are required to provide clear indicators of a project's continued success or emergent difficulties and will be used to evaluate the application not only in peer review, but also in consideration of the awarded project for funding of non-competing award years. The application should include clearly specified, well-defined milestones, quantitative go/no go decision points, and timelines for assessing progress. An example of a poorly defined milestone is \"have an external panel in 2020\" whereas a well-defined milestone would be \"have an external panel in 2020 that concludes which approaches are feasible\". The milestones and timeline should be included as an attachment, filename labeled as \"Milestones and Timeline” and submitted under the Other Attachment section of the R&R Other Project Information form. See related Notice of Clarification: NOT-RM-23-024.\n\n16. How can I use the PhenX Toolkit for measurement?\n\nThe PhenX Toolkit offers a way to standardize the collection of data to allow cross- comparison. The web-based catalog offers recommended measurement protocols in 29 research domains, including a collection of measurement protocols in the social determinants of health domain.\n\n17. How many letters of support can I include in my application?\n\nLetters of support are not restricted to a number. Include letters of support from partnering institutions, appropriate leaders of institutional component services, Tribal communities, or outside collaborators/subcontractors with clear statements of roles/responsibilities. Submitted letters should directly demonstrate the ability of the proposed Hub to fulfill the roles and responsibilities specified in the NOFO.\n\n18. Do I need to include a Resource Sharing Plan in my application?\n\nIndividuals are required to comply with the instructions for the Resource Sharing Plans as provided in the SF424 (R&R) Application Guide. The Resource Sharing Plan will be evaluated as part of the Approach criterion. Applicants are asked to describe a vision for how the valuable resources generated by the Hubs can be maintained beyond the funding period as part of the application.\n\n19. Do I need to include a Data Management and Sharing Plan in my application?\n\nIn accordance with NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing all applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must include a Data Management and Sharing Plan. For elements to include in the Data Management and Sharing Plan, please see the SF424 (R&R) Application Guide. Additionally, as described in the additional instructions listed in “Other Plan(s)” under PHS 398 Research Plan, the Data Management and Sharing Plan should include components related to public access; data security; and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIRness).\n\n20.
