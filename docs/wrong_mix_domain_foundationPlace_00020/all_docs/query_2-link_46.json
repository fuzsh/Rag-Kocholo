        "text": "Federal employees\n\nTheir children, step-children, and legal dependents\n\nTheir spouses\n\nWhether the federal civilian or postal employee is the applicant or an applicant sponsor, they must be a full- or part-time permanent employee with at least three years of federal service.\n\nSome associations and unions partner with FEEA to provide specific scholarship programs for their members, members’ children, grandchildren, or spouses, or retiree members’ children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.\n\nView our partner programs worksheet for the list of organizational sponsors and eligibility requirements.\n\nRedaction is the process of selectively editing or removing sensitive or confidential information from a document to protect the privacy and security of individuals. This is typically done by blacking out or obscuring specific portions of text or images to prevent them from being visible to others.\n\nFor more on redacting information including how to redact a document, check out our FAQ video.\n\nYou can redact information using various methods, depending on your preference and the tools available to you. Here are two common ways to redact information:\n\nDigital Redaction (using a computer):\n\nAdobe Acrobat: If you have access to Adobe Acrobat or a similar PDF editing software, you can use the redaction tools provided. Here’s a general guide:\n\nOpen your document in Adobe Acrobat.\n\nSelect the “Redact” tool.\n\nHighlight the text or areas you want to redact.\n\nConfirm the redaction action, and the selected information will be permanently hidden.\n\nSave the document with the redactions in place.\n\nScanner Apps: Some scanner apps and software also offer redaction features. You can scan the document and then use the app’s redaction tools to black out or obscure sensitive information.\n\nManual Redaction (using a black marker):\n\nIf you don’t have access to digital tools, you can manually redact information using a black marker and a scanner or photocopier.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nPrint a copy of the document you want to redact.\n\nCarefully use a black marker to cover the sensitive information you wish to redact. Ensure that it’s fully covered, so it cannot be seen through the marker.\n\nOnce you’ve finished manually redacting the document, scan it.\n\nThe scanned version will have the sensitive information blacked out.\n\nRemember to review the redacted document to ensure that the information you intended to hide is no longer visible. It’s important to take precautions to protect sensitive data, especially when sharing documents electronically or with others. Please also ensure that information meant to be visible is still available and legible. If any required information is not readable, your application will be disqualified.\n\nFor more on redacting information including how to redact a document, check out our FAQ video.\n\nAward winners will receive a large envelope via USPS to the home address listed on their application, as well as an email to the personal email address provided on their application. All applicants will be notified of their final status by mid-August through the email they used in their application. Please make sure to check your spam folder if you don’t see an email by August 15. The email will come from no-reply@webportalapp.com with the subject line “2024 FEEA Scholarship Application”.\n\nPlease make sure the email address you provide in your application is one you will continue to have access to through the summer."
