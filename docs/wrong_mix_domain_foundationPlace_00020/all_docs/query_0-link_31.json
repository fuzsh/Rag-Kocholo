        "text": "Values\n\nFleishhacker Foundation Values\n\nSince 1947, the Fleishhacker Foundation has been guided by values passed down by our founders: integrity, honesty, humility, thoughtfulness, intellectual curiosity, respect for all people, personal empowerment, self-determination, and “repairing the world” in the Jewish tradition of tikkun olam. Today, our operating values seek to honor that legacy to improve the quality of life in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nCommunity – We support initiatives that bring people together and increase connection among members of diverse groups. We value the arts as a means to promote understanding and strengthen community.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion – We have a strong tradition of supporting Bay Area nonprofit organizations that are led by, represent, or benefit historically marginalized communities and of providing Eureka Fellowships to a diverse array of local artists. We are committed to continuing to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in our grantmaking and fellowship programs.\n\nInnovation – We strategically invest in smaller and emerging groups.\n\nThese values guide all of our philanthropic activities."
