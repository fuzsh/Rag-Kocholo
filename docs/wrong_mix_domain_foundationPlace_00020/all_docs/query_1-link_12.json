Donating to the Haskins Foundation is a way for those with a love for college golf and the legacy of Mr. Fred Haskins to give back to the collegiate game and preserve the vision of the Fred Haskins Award. Thanks to our generous donors, the Foundation has been able to accomplish many of our strategic initiatives, including the addition of the ANNIKA Award Presented by Stifel in 2014.\n\nDonors also receive custom Haskins Foundation gifts as a thank you!"
