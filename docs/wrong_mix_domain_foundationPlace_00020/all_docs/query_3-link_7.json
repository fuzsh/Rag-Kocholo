I found the folder where the 'built-in' addons are installed, but not the folder for third party addons (I am guessing, as that folder doesn't have any of my other third party addons). I deleted the original addon zip file from where it was installed, which did nothing. I also tried restarting my computer, which did not affect anything. Is it possible to delete an addon from a file folder, since I can't open the software? Let me know if a crash log might help, and I'll upload one."
