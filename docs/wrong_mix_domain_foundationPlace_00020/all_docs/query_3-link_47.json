        "text": "Pritzker Traubert Foundation believes all Chicagoans should have equal access to economic opportunity.\n\nWhen all of Chicago’s neighborhoods thrive, the City works better for everyone. We partner with visionary leaders to implement their bold plans to connect talent to jobs, build an inclusive and growing economy, and strengthen communities in Chicago. Only when all our neighbors and neighborhoods thrive can Chicago reach its full potential. In addition to financial resources, we contribute our passion, time, and expertise to increase the impact of our investments.\n\nComplex challenges require bold, thoughtful solutions.\n\nThat’s why we embrace community partnerships as foundational to supporting strong leaders and transformational ideas. Since the foundation's inception more than 20 years ago, we have worked to increase opportunity by investing in community-led initiatives and civic institutions throughout Chicago, especially on the South and West sides. Pritzker Traubert Foundation has more than tripled its financial commitment to Chicago over the last ten years. We are proud to have committed more than $100 million to building a more prosperous and inclusive city."
