The folder type hierarchy is a component of a content model.\n\nPerceptive Content does not require that you specify a container type hierarchy for your users to create containers in a drawer; however, we recommend that you establish a hierarchy so that the containers your users create in your system follow a defined structure. A well designed structure enhances the storage and retrieval of items."
