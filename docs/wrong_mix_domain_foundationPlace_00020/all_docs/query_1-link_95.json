It does not depend on bootstrap.\n\nYou can use whatever you want in your application. The Radzen.Blazor components will only use the contents of default-base.css.\n\nNo.\n\nThanks for all your help\n\nBut I am not going to use the grid it's simple to slow.\n\nI am showing 500 items, yes it's a lot but the the amount changes very slowly and I would like my users to always have the customer at hand\n\nOkay I was a little to fast in judging the grid. I do thin it has a performance issue. I tried some of the others grid out there and also just using bootstrap and the Redzen grid is very slow.\n\nBut, but I set the page count to 25 and removed sorting and to my joy I can still filter all the 500 items and it is fast.\n\nI also really like your DialogService, NotificationService and TooltipService. Very similar to something I implemented in WPF many years ago\n\nSo thanks again and sorry for being short headed"
