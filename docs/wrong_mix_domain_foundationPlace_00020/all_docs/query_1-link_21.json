The vision is to bring together the outdoor and ocean communities, united by a passion for the outdoors and adventure, through the power of film. Our programs recognize films, filmmakers, professional athletes, artists, and change-makers to amplify their stories and build community with a platform for meaningful engagement and collaboration.\n\nOur Purpose\n\nTo promote and foster an appreciation for film, filmmakers, and their important stories that entertain, educate, and inspire audiences and influence positive social and environmental change. To make a positive impact locally and globally using the power of film and storytelling and support the next generation of filmmakers through programs, grants, and scholarships.\n\nFounded in 2019, “The Coast Film & Music Festival”, held in Laguna Beach, California in November, is an annual showcase of adventure and non-fiction films and stories from the mountains to the sea. Stories are curated to entertain, inform, and inspire audiences of all ages to push personal boundaries and be better stewards of the planet.\n\nA curated space with local environmental nonprofits and scheduled programs to connect and amplify the voices and educate the community about their work. United by a shared purpose, the joint objective is to motivate, educate, and enable individuals to make a lasting, positive difference in their surroundings, families, and broader communities by providing them with the necessary resources and tools.\n\nWe are committed to the next generation of storytellers and provide various ways to inspire and motivate young filmmakers.\n\nDuring our annual film festival, we offer a student film showcase and awards for filmmakers from local Orange County middle and high schools. This has inspired two local schools to start film education programs in which we are invited to judge and award films entered into our annual film festival.\n\nA student filmmaker scholarship of $1,500 is awarded to a graduating LBHS senior."
