        "text": "How do I register a lemonade stand or event?\n\nYou can register your lemonade stand or event here! Select the role that fits for your fundraiser best, and our system will walk you through the registration process - it takes less than five minutes to complete! Once registered, you will be assigned an event coach who will help you with the planning process.\n\nHow do I host a lemonade stand?\n\nMaybe you remember holding a lemonade stand in your front yard when you were a kid? It’s as simple as that! Set up a table outside your home, in a park or anywhere stands are welcome, with a blue or yellow tablecloth and sell lemonade. Rather than set a price, we suggest specifically asking for donations. Here is a helpful guide to get you started! If you would like to build a lemonade stand you can download the blueprints here.\n\nHow do I send the money in?\n\nThere are a few ways you can donate! Use the pre-addressed and pre-paid envelope in your event kit to send a check or money order in the mail. We do suggest to not send cash as we are unable to track it. Once received, it will take about 2-4 weeks to upload to your page. Or you can donate directly to your event page via credit card. Credit card donations are the fastest way to see your total updated. You can also send it to ALSF's Venmo account @AlexsLemonadeStandFoundation and include your event ID starting with \"E\" (ex: E1234567) under \"What's it for?\"\n\nI’m sending a check. Who do I make the check out to and where do I mail it?\n\nPlease make your check out to Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation and send it to the ALSF office at 333 E. Lancaster Ave, #414, Wynnewood, PA 19096.\n\nHow do I reschedule my event?\n\nRescheduling is no problem. Please reach out to your event coach to let them know you are rescheduling your fundraising event. Once you find a new date you can update the dates on your event page so you can share it with your friends and family.\n\nI held a stand last year and want to do it again. Do I need to create a new event page?\n\nWelcome back! We would love for you to host another stand or event. Each year you decide to host a stand or event, we suggest you register a new event page under your account. If you decide to keep your previous event page, please be sure to update the date of your event to let us know you are hosting another fundraiser on our behalf, and we can help with any event questions you may have!\n\nCan I hold a lemonade stand any time of the year?\n\nYes! Lemonade stands are welcome at any time of the year that works best for you.\n\nWhere can I hold my lemonade stand?\n\nYou can hold a lemonade stand almost anywhere! Most of our supporters set up in the front yards of their homes, but if you don’t live in a high traffic area, you can reach out to your local businesses (grocery stores, restaurants, community centers) to host your stand at their location. Check out this list of ALSF partners to spark some ideas.\n\nWhen will my event kit arrive?\n\nEvent kits are sent via USPS and take about 5-10 business days to arrive. If your kit doesn’t arrive in time for your stand, feel free to use our downloads section of the website and print everything that comes in the kit.\n\nIs lemonade included in the event kit?\n\nUnfortunately, lemonade does not come in an event kit. Please reach out to your event coach and they can supply a letter of support that states you are fundraising on behalf of ALSF with tax information. You can present the letter to your local grocery store to get supplies like lemonade and cups donated for your stand.\n\nHow do I reset my ALSF account password?\n\nYou can easily reset your password by clicking the “My Account” button on the top left side of the ALSF website. Choose the “Reset my password” tab and an email will be sent out with instructions on how to reset your password. (Sometimes emails from our website go to your junk folder, so please check there if you don’t see an email within half an hour.) Your event coach can also help reset your password. If you’ve lost or forgotten your password, click the “Request new password” tab under “My Account.”"
