        "text": "This article applies as of PRTG 20\n\nImportant: The following article will no longer be updated. For up-to-date-information, see the PRTG Manual: Data Storage and the respective section in the PRTG MultiBoard & PRTG app for desktop manual.\n\nHow PRTG Network Monitor stores its data\n\nPRTG Network Monitor writes data to several locations:\n\nInto the program directory (core installation)\n\nInto the data directory (monitoring configuration, monitoring data, logs, etc.)\n\nInto the registry (license key, admin login, IP settings, etc.)\n\nProgram directory\n\nBy default, the PRTG setup program stores the core installation in one of the following directories:\n\n%programfiles%\\PRTG Network Monitor\n\nor\n\n%programfiles(x86)%\\PRTG Network Monitor\n\nTip: To directly open an Explorer Window showing the respective directory, click on \"Run...\" in the Windows Start Menu (shortcut Windows+R), paste the path above into the \"Open:\" field and click \"OK\".\n\nHowever, the default setting can be changed during setup. To find the right path for your PRTG installation, please look it up in the Properties of your Start Menu's PRTG icons.\n\nNote: The Windows ProgramData folder is hidden by default. To show it, open the Windows Explorer, open the View tab, and select Hidden items (on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012, works similar on other Windows versions).\n\nData directory\n\nThe default setting of the data directory depends on the PRTG Network Monitor version you are using (deprecated PRTG 7/8, or as of PRTG 9), as well as on your Windows version. The paths are also different if you have upgraded from the deprecated PRTG 7/8 versus installed a new version as of PRTG 9.\n\nThe default data folder is located as follows, depending on your Windows version:\n\nWindows Server 2012 (R2), Windows Server 2016, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2:\n\n%programdata%\\Paessler\\PRTG Network Monitor\n\nThe path is the same for Windows Vista (deprecated).\n\nWindows XP, Windows 2003 (these Windows versions are not officially supported):\n\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Application data\\Paessler\\PRTG Network Monitor\n\nTip: To directly open an Explorer Window showing the respective directory, click on \"Run...\" in the Windows Start Menu (shortcut Windows+R), paste the path above into the \"Open:\" field and click \"OK\".\n\nNotes:\n\nDepending on the language and version of your Windows installation you might need to translate the substring Application data into your Windows installation's language (for example Anwendungsdaten for some German Windows versions).\n\nIf you set a custom path for the data directory, you must use folder names that only use ANSI characters. PRTG does not support non-ANSI characters in the directory data path.\n\nHowever, the default setting can be changed. To find the right path for your PRTG installation, open the PRTG Administration Tool and look up the path in the Core Server tab. You can also change the path there.\n\nNote: For the deprecated PRTG 7 and PRTG 8, the paths are the following:\n\nPRTG 7 (deprecated):\n\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Application data\\Paessler\\PRTG Network Monitor\\V7\n\nPRTG 8 (deprecated):\n\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Application data\\Paessler\\PRTG Network Monitor\\V8\n\nFiles and subfolders in the data directory\n\nThe following files and folders are stored in the file system:\n\nFileDescriptionFile Format Log Database.dbOnly versions before 8.2: Database with the recent event history for the whole system; \"Logs\" in the web interface.

See section Structure of the Logs Folder for more information.Text \\Logs (Web Server)HTTP server logfiles of the PRTG web server\n\nNote: As of version 18.3.43, the path is Logs\\webserver.

The exact location depends on both the kind of system you're running and the installed PRTG version (or which version was installed previously).\n\n32-bit systems:\n\nPRTG 9 or later:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Paessler\\PRTG Network Monitor\n\nPRTG 7 (deprecated):\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Paessler\\PRTG Network Monitor\\V7\n\nPRTG 8 (deprecated):\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Paessler\\PRTG Network Monitor\\V8\n\n64-bit systems:\n\nPRTG 9 or later:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Paessler\\PRTG Network Monitor\n\nPRTG 7:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Paessler\\PRTG Network Monitor\\V7\n\nPRTG 8:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Paessler\\PRTG Network Monitor\\V8\n\nEnterprise Console (PRTG 9 through 19)\n\nImportant notice: The Enterprise Console is unsupported and deprecated as of version PRTG 19.4.53. Please switch to PRTG MultiBoard & PRTG app for desktop, our new alternative interface that you can use to connect to the PRTG core server and manage your entire network.\n\nAll settings of the Enterprise Console are stored under the following node:\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Paessler\\PRTG Network Monitor\\WinGUI\n\nFor example, you will find all configured PRTG core servers there.\n\nPRTG MultiBoard & PRTG app for desktop\n\nBy default, the PRTG MultiBoard & PRTG app for desktop setup program stores the core installation in one of the following directories:\n\n%programfiles%\\Paessler\\PRTG Desktop or %programfiles(x86)%\\Paessler\\PRTG Desktop\n\nUser data, certificates, and database, for example, are stored in the following data folder: %appdata%\\Paessler\\PRTG Desktop\\data\n\nQt WebEngine caching and storage files are stored in the following data folder: %localappdata%\\Paessler\\PRTG Desktop\n\nRegistry\n\nAll settings of PRTG MultiBoard & PRTG app for desktop are stored under the following node: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Paessler\\PRTGDesktop\n\nHTTP Full Web Page sensor\n\nIf you use the HTTP Full Web Page sensor, files might also be stored in the following cache folder on the probe system:\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Temporary Internet Files\\Content.IE5\n\nNote: To see this directory, you might have to edit folder options to see hidden files.\n\nAuto-update\n\nDownloaded software versions are automatically saved in the PRTG program directory in the \\download subfolder. The prtg.zip that contains all necessary files is also cached in this folder.\n\nNote: If you receive the error \"Error reading ZIP-File\" while updating your PRTG version, this could be because the file has been corrupted by a virus scanner. To avoid such issues, we recommend that you make the appropriate exclusions for the PRTG program directory.\n\nMore"
