        "text": "The Kellin Foundation’s mission is to strengthen resilience among children, families, adults and communities through trauma-informed behavioral health services focused on prevention, treatment, and healing.\n\nWe provide free services that help clients break cycles of trauma that contribute to mental health and substance use challenges. Our team of highly-trained professionals helps people process what has happened to them, to practice new skills that contribute to healing, and to gain confidence that they can chart a different course for themselves and their families.\n\nTo achieve our mission, we provide evidence-based, trauma-responsive counseling, peer support, advocacy, and case coordination services. In addition, we provide training and facilitate teams working together to build a stronger Guilford County.\n\nOur History\n\nThe roots of the Kellin Foundation trace back to 2013 when Dr. Kelly Graves and Lindy Beauregard founded the nonprofit organization in Greensboro, NC. Starting with just two part-time staff members, their vision quickly grew in response to the community's increasing need for trauma-informed treatment services for individuals and families. In 2016, fueled by the support of dedicated donors, the Foundation took a significant step forward by opening its first clinic doors, extending behavioral health services to uninsured and underinsured community members who lacked access to essential care.\n\nSince those early days, the Kellin Foundation has grown significantly, now assisting over 12,000 individuals each year through free services aimed at supporting mental and emotional well-being. This dedication has led to recognition as a National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) clinic, highlighting the Foundation's importance as a valuable resource in North Carolina, and designated center of excellence for integrated care for mental health and substance use disorders, and a certified North Carolina Family Resource Center.\n\nIn 2022, a historic moment unfolded as Mental Health Greensboro, the longest standing local mental health nonprofit merged with the Kellin Foundation with the goal of improving access to free community behavioral health services. Mental Health Greensboro, originally established in 1940 as the Mental Health Hygiene Society, has been a strong advocate for those experiencing mental illness, creating a rich array of programs that have left a lasting footprint in Greensboro and beyond. The combined expertise of both organizations represents 84 years of unwavering dedication to mental health advocacy and support.\n\nBuilding on this legacy, the year 2023 marked a significant milestone for the Kellin Foundation. Recognized for its substantial growth and impact, the Foundation received a generous gift—a spacious 35,000-square-foot building to fulfill the next phase of our mission –The Kellin Foundation Hope Hub. The Hope Hub employs a comprehensive approach to prevention and treatment, providing a space for people of all ages to access both mental health services and additional integrated offerings from vital community partners—all conveniently housed under one roof. This facility will enable us to further extend our reach in collaboration with other nonprofits dedicated to supporting people across the lifespan, creating a unified space for comprehensive care."
