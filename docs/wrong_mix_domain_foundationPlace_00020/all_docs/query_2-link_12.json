We work tirelessly to empower our neighbors with knowledge and inspire them with opportunity so they can take positive action with confidence, creating a new world of possibilities for themselves and their families - and ultimately, the block, the hood, and the city, too.\n\nOur volunteering efforts.\n\nWe believe that the city reflects who we are, and we have a responsibility to what it is. Therefore we host multiple volunteer events per month through our Community Development Initiatives. We support Chicago communities by cleaning alleys, mowing lawns, shoveling for seniors, and more."
