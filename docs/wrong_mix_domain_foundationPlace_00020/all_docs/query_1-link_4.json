        "text": "Welcome to the PBDG Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization managing the Construction Business Training Center. Our core mission is to champion equity and inclusion within the construction industry, actively supporting, mentoring, and providing crucial resources to marginalized and underutilized business owners in the building trades.\n\nThe Construction Business Training Center offers comprehensive, construction-specific technical assistance services. These services are designed to meet participants at their current level and help build a solid, long-term foundation for their business. Our assistance covers a wide range, from basics like understanding costs, business operations, and accounting processes to more complex needs such as bidding, estimating systems, and construction software training. Additionally, we collaborate with other nonprofits, public agencies, and business community partners to give owners access to essential resources.\n\nThe Center caters to all minorities and MBE/DBE contractors and professional service firms in consulting, design, general services, architecture, and engineering. Importantly, businesses do not need to be members of PBDG to benefit from these resources.\n\nAll PBDG Foundation events are open to the public, and we welcome participation from everyone, whether or not you are a member. We look forward to seeing you at our events and helping you grow your business!"
