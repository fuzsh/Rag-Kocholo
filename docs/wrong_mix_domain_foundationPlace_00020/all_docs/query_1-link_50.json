I shouldn't have to use mkdir to create the target folder. (but that gets the job done nastily)\n\nPlease dont direct me to this as that does not do the above.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThanks to the answers below using robocopy I found a solution using xcopy that doesnt prompt either:\n\nxcopy /e /i folderA folderB\\folderA"
