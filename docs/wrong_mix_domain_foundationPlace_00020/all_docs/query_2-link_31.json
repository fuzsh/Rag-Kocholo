The After Hours Variance Map provides you with a tool to confirm whether construction projects on their block have the proper permits to work at night and on weekends.\n\nRequest Records...\n\nUse the DOB NOW: BIS Options portal to request drawings, plans or documents for properties located in New York City. For step-by-step directions, see the Record Requests in DOB NOW guide. Requests can be made for folders, plans, microfilm, docket books, reels, index/I-cards, and curb cut cards. Once a record request is submitted in DOB NOW, an email notification is sent to the requestor when the records are available for pick up at the borough office where the property is located.\n\nThe NYC Department of Records and Information Services also maintains plan, docket book and block and lot collections. The NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development maintains an online database at www.nyc.gov/hpdonline that contains I-card images for New York City properties."
