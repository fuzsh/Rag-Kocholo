        "text": "End cities are castle-like structures found on the outer islands of the End. They are inhabited by shulkers and hold loot among the most valuable in the game.\n\nGeneration[]\n\nEnd cities naturally generate all over the End's outer islands. They can easily be accessed by entering the end gateway portal, but it is possible to cross the gap between the islands in other ways. They generate on the large islands, where chorus trees grow. If the end gateway portal teleports the player to a small island, the player can get to the nearest large island by building, using elytra, or throwing ender pearls.\n\nEnd cities usually generate in flat areas, in \"midlands\" or \"highlands\" biomes, which are found on larger islands. One may find several cities clustered together, or travel for thousands of blocks before finding one. Unlike other structures, End cities are generated in a noticeable grid. They are located only in chunks numbered 0-8 ± a multiple of 20. For example one possible \"cell\" for an End city to be generated in is x_chunks=0-8 and z_chunks=80-88 which is equivalent to the coordinates x=0-128 and z=1280-1408. There can never be an End city at for example z=961-1279 or z=1409-1599 because it is outside any \"cell\".[note 1]\n\nStructure[]\n\nMain article: /Structure\n\nEnd cities consist of tall skyscraper-like towers constructed out of end stone bricks and purpur blocks. An End city may generate as a single tower by itself, or as a sprawling complex of inter-connected towers and pathways branching from a main tower. End rods and ender chests are the only source of light. Many shulkers spawn around the city, and guard its various treasures. Decorative banners hang at the tops of some towers.\n\nSeveral types of rooms can be found in an End city, and several different floors, including:\n\nBase floors, which are empty floors found at the base of every city; they are three stories tall, with each room wider than the one below it.\n\nBanner rooms that have banners hanging on the outside, and a shulker attached to the ceiling.\n\nSmall rooms that have nothing in them at all.\n\nLarge rooms that have precarious parkour-like staircases often leading up to another tower or a loot room.\n\nLoot rooms that consist of two chests with valuable loot at the end of a small parkour area; some rooms may have one normal chest next to an ender chest instead.\n\nThere are two types of towers:\n\nSmall towers that are hollow, consisting of a single purpur slab spiral staircase of sorts.\n\nSkyscrapers that consist of a treacherous double spiral staircase made of purpur slabs and end rods; many shulkers spawn here.\n\nEnd Ship[]\n\nFor the ocean structure, see Shipwreck.\n\nAn end ship is a floating, boat-like structure found alongside End cities. It is relatively small, but holds even more valuable treasure than the city itself.\n\nGeneration[]\n\nEach direction of every tower of the End city has a 50% chance of generating a bridge, and the bridge itself has a 12.5% chance to generate an end ship.\n\nWhen generated, the stern of the ship always faces toward the city and the bow always faces away. It generates in front of a bridge with a gated arch at the end, from which one can throw an ender pearl to reach the ship, or build a bridge.\n\nStructure[]\n\nMain article: End City/Structure/Ship\n\nThe end ship is made of end stone bricks and purpur blocks, just like the city's main towers. Their design resembles that of European square rig sailing ships, commonly seen during the golden age of exploration. Three shulkers spawn on the ship; one on the main deck, one behind the stern of the ship, and one in the treasure room.\n\nMain Deck[]\n\nThe ship's main deck amounts to less than half of the walkable space on the ship. A ladder leads up the mast to an empty crow's nest, about 20 blocks high. There are no sails connected to the mast.\n\nA dragon head sits at the bow of the ship, making this the only way to obtain the dragon head in Survival mode. There are two small staircases on the outside; one that leads up to the empty upper deck, and one that leads to the cabin below.\n\nAftercastle[]\n\nThe aftercastle contains a brewing stand sitting on a small table, with two Instant Health II potions. Another staircase leads below deck to the ship's \"hotspot\"; the treasure room.\n\nTreasure Room[]\n\nThe floor of the treasure room is lined with obsidian. There are four small windows on the sides. It contains two loot chests and an item frame holding a pair of elytra wings; this is the only way to obtain elytra in Survival mode. A shulker guards the elytra and the two loot chests.\n\nAn end ship.\n\nThe bridge that leads to the end ship.\n\nThe dragon head, with the city in the background.\n\nThe sterncastle of the ship. The doorway in the back leads to the treasure room. a brewing stand can be seen.\n\nThe treasure room, where a shulker guards the elytra.\n\nThe treasure room, only without the shulker.\n\nStructure details[]\n\nOne may access the individual structures of an End city by utilizing structure blocks to manually load city structures from the data/minecraft/structures/end_city folder in minecraft.jar. To do so, set a structure block to Load mode, enter end_city/StructureName and press LOAD. The names of these structures and a small description is provided below:\n\nStructure name Description Consists of Images end_city/base_floor A small room with 2 Shulkers guarding the entrance.

Java Edition 1.915w31aAdded End cities. As a leftover testing feature, a beacon with the Speed status effect can be found on end ships.[1] 15w32cBeacons in end ships have been replaced by pumpkins. End ships now generate with a dragon head at the bow. 15w33cPumpkins in end ships have been replaced by a hopper that contains a book, written by Searge, titled \"Work in Progress\". It reads: \"We will have something else here soon...\". 15w41aThe iron blocks, book, and hopper have been removed, so that the floor consists of obsidian and purpur blocks. A pair of elytra wings now hangs in an item frame above the shulker guarding the two treasure chests. 1.1116w39aCursed enchantments can now appear on items in End city chests. End cities can now be located using the /locate command. 1.20\n\n(Experimental)23w04aSpire armor trims are now found in end city chests. 23w05aIncreased the chance of spire armor trims from 4.7% to 6.7%. Pocket Edition 1.0.0alpha 0.17.0.1Added End cities. They spawn without banners and spawn with regular glass instead of magenta glass. Bedrock Edition 1.2.0beta 1.2.0.2End cities now normally spawn with banners. They also now spawn with magenta glass instead of regular glass. Legacy Console Edition TU46CU36 1.38 Patch 151.0.1Added End cities. New Nintendo 3DS Edition 1.7.10Added End cities.\n\nIssues[]\n\nIssues relating to \"End City\" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nSome End city rooms are structured similarly to traditional Asian pagodas. Jeb had visited the Summer Palace before the release of 15w31a.[2][3]\n\nThe banners atop the towers have a magenta and black pattern that resembles the missing texture:\n\nEnd cities can be over 100 blocks tall.\n\nEnd cities, ancient cities, and bastion remnants are the only places where players can find enchanted diamond gear, and one of only two ways to obtain them other than by enchanting, the other being trading with a weaponsmith, toolsmith, or armorer villager.\n\nOn the end ship, there is a hole in the crow's nest atop of the mast, which is directly above a piece of magenta stained glass on the ship's deck. This is a relic feature from the early days of the ship's development, when the main loot inside the ship was a beacon that shoots its beam through the magenta glass and the hole in the crow's nest, creating a magenta beam. Although the beacon was replaced with the elytra, the magenta glass and the hole remained unchanged.\n\nGallery[]\n\nAn image released on Jeb's Instagram reveals a mysterious structure now known as an End City.\n\nAn end city appears in the background of the official Java Edition 1.9 poster.\n\nAn end city and an end ship as seen from afar (before 15w32c).\n\nThe entrance to the city, which is guarded by two shulkers.\n\nA room with a complex staircase, which often has two treasure chests at the top.\n\nA treasure room.\n\nA hanging bridge with stairs, connecting one tower to another.\n\nAnother bridge, but this one is much steeper.\n\nTwo cities generated within a relatively short distance.\n\nAn end ship drifts lazily into the void.\n\nA single tower that generated by itself.\n\nA large end city.\n\nA view of an end ship from one of the bridges.\n\nA chorus tree generated inside of a room.\n\n5 end cities generated nearby.
