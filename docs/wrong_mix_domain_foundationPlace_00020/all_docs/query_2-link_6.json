        "text": "The Foundation supports institutions dedicated to humanist scholarship and artistic excellence through its Humanities, Performing Arts, Research Libraries, and Venetian Programs.\n\nHumanities Program\n\nThe Foundation intends to further the humanities along a broad front, supporting projects which address the concerns of the historical studia humanitatis: a humanistic education rooted in the great traditions of the past; the formation of human beings according to cultural, moral, and aesthetic ideals derived from that past; and the ongoing debate over how these ideals may best be conceived and realized.\n\nPrograms in the following areas are eligible: history; archaeology; literature; languages, both classical and modern; philosophy; ethics; comparative religion; the history, criticism, and theory of the arts; and those aspects of the social sciences which share the content and methods of humanistic disciplines. The Foundation welcomes projects that cross the boundaries between humanistic disciplines and explore the connection between the humanities and other areas of scholarship. Programs of institutions in Venice relating to the humanities are eligible in this category. The geographical concentration is primarily but not exclusively directed toward European and American history and letters, broadly defined.\n\nThe Humanities Program is primarily directed to institutions of higher education and humanistic enterprises such as learned societies, museums, and major editorial projects. The program may also consider, on a selective basis, projects that increase the exposure of those outside these institutions to the humanistic experience or that strengthen preparation for the humanistic disciplines. The prime criterion remains that of Gladys and Jean Delmas: a commitment to excellence, whether proven or promised.\n\nPerforming Arts Program\n\nDuring 2021 and 2022, the Foundation suspended its usual guidelines and open-door policy for grant applications. For 2023 the Foundation has restored its traditional open-door policy for requests and welcomes new applications that fit within our guidelines. However, it is important that all applicants be aware that the Foundation receives many more requests for support than it could ever fund, and for that reason most first-time grant applications are not successful.\n\nThe Foundation only supports not-for-profit performing arts organizations in NYC in the fields of music, dance and theatre. Only publicly supported organizations described in section 501(c)3) of the Internal Revenue Code should apply. The Foundation does not make grants to fiscal agents for the benefit of individual artists, special initiatives, start-up projects or emerging organizations that are not already tax exempt and publicly supported or to development campaigns or building projects.\n\nThe Foundation has a special interest in supporting:\n\nBallet and modern dance companies and the presenters who make the work of these groups available to the public and otherwise provide support to the dance field.\n\nTheater companies and presenters that have demonstrated a commitment to include the classics in their regular offerings.\n\nMusic groups and concert presenters committed to making early music or contemporary repertory available to New York City audiences.\n\nApplications are accepted on a rolling basis. Most performing arts requests to the Foundation are for general operating support, although we also accept proposals for targeted creative projects, or local season support from New York City performing arts organizations that generally tour outside of the city.\n\nWe are aware and appreciative of the sacrifices that our grantees and others in the field have made during the past three years to keep the performing arts alive during the pandemic as well as the challenges that they face today. We wish everyone a healthy year of creating and presenting great work.\n\nResearch Libraries Program\n\nThe Research Libraries Program concentrates primarily in those areas of its founders’ interests and aims to be fully complementary to the Foundation’s other program areas (i.e., humanities scholarship, performing arts, and Venetian history and culture).\n\nThe overall objective of the Research Libraries Program is to improve the ability of research libraries to serve the needs of scholarship in the humanities and the performing arts, and to help make their resources more widely accessible to scholars and the general public. Wherever possible, grants to libraries seek to promote cooperative cataloging projects, with an emphasis on access to archival, manuscript, and other unique sources; some elements of interpretation and exhibition; scholarly library publications; bibliographical and publishing projects of interest to research libraries; and collection-level preservation/conservation work and research.\n\nSmall-scale digitizing is eligible for support when the process is part of a clearly defined and timely scholarly project that incorporates recognized standards for metadata production, for preservation, and for distribution. The Foundation does not support massive digitizing projects of a general nature.\n\nThe geographical concentration is primarily but not exclusively directed toward European and American history and letters, broadly defined. Technological developments that support humanities research and access to humanities resources are also eligible. A limited number of modest grants will also be available for projects related to the history of the book, book culture, printing history, and related programs. Conferences designed to address these issues in collaborative ways and programs formulated to enhance or leverage similar activity by other institutions, consortia, or funding agencies will also be considered.\n\nVenetian Program\n\nThis program supports institutions engaged in the research and dissemination of scholarship on the history of Venice and the former Venetian empire as well as contemporary Venetian society and culture.\n\nResearch grants for individuals are available under the Venetian Research Program.\n\nTrustees’ Discretionary Grants\n\nThe discretionary fund permits each Trustee to initiate, with concurrence of the other Trustees, a limited number of grants outside of the Foundation’s established grant-making guidelines. Applications for Trustees’ Discretionary Grants are by invitation only.\n\nFoundation Service Organizations\n\nThe Delmas Foundation supports some foundation service organizations through membership contributions."
