        "text": "During the summer of 2019, Progress Bar banned rap music, Beatnix called the police on customers who objected to them selling confederate flag vests, and the largest LGBTQ+ center in the Midwest refused to fire a security firm owned by an off-duty cop with white supremacist ties. Lighthouse Church of Chicago UCC teamed up with Affinity Community Services and the Chicago Black Gay Men’s Caucus to host a protest that garnered 150 supporters. Progress Bar revoked the ban.\n\nIn July, Jamie Frazier launched Lighthouse Foundation as a stand-alone social justice organization by hosting a Racial Justice Summit that packed the room with over 100 LGBTQ+ nonprofit staff, clergy, and community members. The event built cross-racial solidarity and initiated a vision of LGBTQ+ equity across the Chicagoland area. By August, we had worked with Antifa members to write and hand-deliver a petition to the LGBT Center signed by 150+ people from 40+ institutions demanding that they fire Walsh Security. After many meetings and a press conference, the center eventually replaced Walsh with a Black LGBTQ+-owned firm trained in de-escalation. We had won our first racial justice campaign!\n\nIn the years since, we’ve decided to focus on systemic interventions, endeavoring to transform institutions for more widespread and long-lasting change. We launched the first Black Queer Equity Index in the US in 2020, using a consensus organizing model which builds on existing partnerships to deepen relationships among LGBTQ+ institutions, center Black LGBTQ+ leadership, and engage in sustained reparative work. Through our spirituality, arts programming, and workforce development programming, we continue to support Black LGBTQ+ people in seizing power for themselves by creating spaces where we can connect with one another, build power, and help our community thrive."
