        "text": "The Andrew McDonough B+ (Be Positive) Foundation honors the life of Andrew McDonough. Andrew battled leukemia, septic shock and complications of childhood cancer for 167 days before passing away on July 14, 2007, at the age of 14. Andrew’s B+ blood type became his family and friends’ motto throughout his fight against childhood cancer – to “Be Positive.”\n\nThe B+ Foundation is about Kids Helping Kids Fight Cancer – raising money through events on college campuses, local events like 5Ks and Golf Outing, corporate partnerships, merchandise sales, and more – to provide financial and emotional support to families of children with cancer nationwide and fund critical, cutting-edge childhood cancer research.\n\nProvide financial assistance to families of children with cancer\n\nWe have helped thousands of families across the country — financially and emotionally — as they care for their child with cancer. Through The B+ Family Assistance Program, The B+ Foundation is the largest provider of financial assistance to families of kids with cancer in the United States.\n\nFund research to find cures for childhood cancers and advancements in treatment protocols\n\nThe B+ Foundation has provided research grants to institutions both nationwide and globally such as St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (TN), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (MA), Seattle Children’s Hospital (WA), Children’s Oncology Group, and the Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research (DE). With your support, there are children and teens alive today due to research funded in part by The B+ Foundation.\n\nIncrease awareness of childhood cancer and advocate for increased research funds\n\nOnly 8.3% of the federal government’s cancer research budget is used for childhood cancer research. The B+ Foundation helped create the Coalition Against Childhood Cancer and is honored to be a member of the Alliance for Childhood Cancer to advocate for more government funds.\n\nSpread The B+ Message\n\nAs it says on B+ t-shirts, “It’s not a grade. It’s an attitude.” By spreading The B+ (Be Positive) Message through outreach efforts and talks, we share the lessons that Andrew taught us: have fun, set goals and try your best, show affection, and be comfortable with yourself. We all need to “Live Like Andrew.”"
