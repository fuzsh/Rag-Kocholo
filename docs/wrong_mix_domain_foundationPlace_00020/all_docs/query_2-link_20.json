I.e. project-based HUDVASH, other funder requirement, deed restriction, zoning requirement, etc.\n\nSupportive services must be provided\n\nDoes a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), count as “evidence of a third-party binding agreement that ensures the units are reserved for veterans”?\n\nNo, this document is not legally binding and therefore will not be accepted.\n\nHow do I submit a project proposal?\n\nPlease read through these instructions as our grant platform has changed.\n\nTo access the new grant platform CLICK HERE\n\nIf you have previously applied for a grant, select “Forgot Password” on the homepage and enter the email address associated with previously submitted grant.\n\nIf you are a new applicant OR you do not receive an email after using “Forgot Password”, select the “Register” button.\n\nOnce you are logged in, you will see a section titled “New Applications” and a button “Start a New Application”\n\n- Please ensure you select the application for the Veteran Housing Grant in the cycle that you would like to be considered for.\n\nWhen will I know if my project is approved?\n\nA THDF staff member will contact you no later than 45 days after the grant proposal due date listed below.\n\nIf approved to proceed to the next step, a THDF staff member will provide the link to the full application.\n\nIf your organization passes a third-party review, THDF Board of Directors will complete a final review.\n\nProposals are accepted year-round, but final determinations are made three times a year. If a proposal is submitted after the deadlines, it will be queued for the next funding cycle.\n\n2024 Funding Cycle Calendar Cycle Grant Proposal Due Final Determinations 1 12/15/2023 April 2024 2 3/22/2024 August 2024\n\n*NOTE: There will only be two cycles for 2024. Normal three cycle review cadence will resume for 2025.\n\nWhat is a third-party review, and who will be conducting it?\n\nA third-party review is a financial analysis and evaluation of business practices and proposed project, conducted in order to identify potential issues for further consideration by our foundation. Applicants may be required to participate in interviews with a third-party vendor. THDF is currently contracted with several providers to conduct these reviews.\n\nWhom should I contact if I have questions or concerns?\n\nPlease contact THDF_VHG@homedepot.com\n\nHow do I access a saved application?\n\nCLICK HERE to log into the grant portal and access a saved application.\n\nOnce on the home page, you will find your saved application under the “Existing Applications” header in the “Actions Required” folder.\n\nYou will find a status of your application by checking the “Submitted” folder or “Approved/Declined” folder.\n\nWhat if I am an individual veteran seeking assistance?\n\nOrganizations or individuals with projects focused on single home construction or repair would not qualify for this program. Single repair requests should view our partnerships to find partners who are already funded to assist qualifying veterans."
