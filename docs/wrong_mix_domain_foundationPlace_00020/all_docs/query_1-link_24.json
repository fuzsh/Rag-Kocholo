        "text": "Hi:\n\nThe name ECPRG193 is the folder name we used at least 3 years ago. I am not sure how you are still getting that folder name when we no longer have that e-learning class on our system. What you needed to do for your libname statement program was this:\n\n%let path=/folders/myfolders/ecprg193;\n\nlibname orion \"/folders/myfolders/ecprg193\";\n\nor\n\n%let path=/folders/myfolders/ecprg193;\n\nlibname orion \"&path\";\n\nYou needed to have the helper macro variable &PATH in place and defined because many of our programs used &PATH in the program.\n\nHowever, we no longer use the ORION data in our current classes and as far as I know, there are no elearning classes that reference that older data.\n\nSo I am concerned that you are following the wrong instructions and taking the wrong class. My suggestion is that you send mail to elearn@sas.com from the email address that you're using for e-learning so they can check how you have access to such an old class and so they can correct the problem and make sure you get access to the most current class.\n\nThat older class is not in sync with the newest Certification exam.\n\nCynthia\n\nPS... If you have a folder in SAS University Edition, left over from taking the Programming 1 course before, please DELETE that folder. Before you email us, please go back into the e-learning course and double check the instructions under #2 as shown below:\n\nYou should be seeing that you have to make a folder name of EPG1V2:\n\nYou CANNOT use the older data with the newer course -- nothing with match up. Please do NOT use any data from an older version of Programming 1.\n\nHello Reeza,\n\nThanks for replying!\n\nI am following Little SAS Book which was introduced by you in 2018 or probably in 2019 to learn SAS for job finding.\n\nThe books says create a lib. That goes through wizard or shortcuts and no code for now.\n\nI am trying to find out where lib/ file located, I can't find it.\n\nThis is what I get when I go to property:\n\nName:BIKES\n\nLibrary paths, engines, and LIBNAME options:\n\n/folders/myfolders/sasuser.v94 Engine:V9\n\nIn fact, when I go to the folders:\n\n/folders/myfolders/sasuser.v94, there is nothing by Bikes.\n\nOr when I go to: C:\\Users\\*****\\Documents\\SASUniversityEdition\\MyFolder\n\nOr When I go to: C:\\My Folder where I originally selecting the folder deliberately when I was installing SAS.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGN\n\nBlue Blue\n\nI have not looked at either of those books, but I suspect that for either you will need to adapt the examples to fit YOUR environment. You cannot literally do exactly what either one says.\n\nIf your question is what files and folders you have available to you in your SAS session when using SAS/Studio then use the \"Server Files and Folders\" area of the interface and look for yourself. Find the folder you want to use and select properties to see the name for that folder that you need to use in your SAS code. You can copy the path listed as the LOCATION and use it in your code. (My paths will look different from yours since I am using SAS/Studio with a real Unix machine and not the virtual machine that SAS University Edition uses.)\n\nTo use the path you have found to assign a libref you can either write and run a LIBNAME statement or use the New Library button under the \"Libraries\" area to do it for you.\n\nOne of you messages mentioned using SASUSER to store files. I generally prefer NOT to do that since that can cause trouble when working in multi-user environments. It also might be an issue with SAS University Edition as I am not sure that it points to an area where you can write things. I suspect that instructions that use that libref in their example code do so because they can skip the need to teach you how to create your own libref. Just adjust the example in the code to reflect the libref that you create.\n\nHi: If you are using SAS University Edition in a Virtual Machine (this is what you use if you need to start Virtual Box or VMWare Player) before SAS Studio opens, then your physical operating system location is the location you defined as your Shared Folder location in the last step of setting up SAS University Edition.\n\nFor example, on my machine, the physical location of my shared folder location on Windows is:\n\nc:\\SASUniversityEdition\\myfolders\n\nSo If I have THIS physical file in my shared folder location, the physical path for the file would be:\n\nc:\\SASUniversityEdition\\myfolders\\somedata.csv -- However, the path name INSIDE University Edition would NOT use the C: drive location. The path inside University Edition would be:\n\n/folder/myfolders/somedata.csv\n\nBecause, the shared folder location is a Unix path location, NOT a Windows path location and /folders/myfolders is the root or \"home\" path for SAS University Edition shared folders.\n\nOn the other hand, if I make a subfolder on the Windows side (or using SAS Studio) and have SAS data in that subfolder, like this:\n\nc:\\SASUniversityEdition\\myfolders\\mydata\\myclass.sas7bdat\n\nc:\\SASUniversityEdition\\myfolders\\mydata\\acct.sas7bdat\n\nc:\\SASUniversityEdition\\myfolders\\mydata\\shoesales.sas7bdat\n\nThen, I would issue a LIBNAME statement like this:\n\nlibname mystuff '/folders/myfolders/mydata';\n\nproc print data=mystuff.shoesales;\n\nrun;\n\nproc print data=mystuff.myclass;\n\nrun;\n\nproc print data=mystuff.acct;\n\nrun;\n\nWe offer a free Programming 1 course that explains about how to use LIBNAME statements and we have specific instructions for using SAS Studio with SAS University Edition and SAS OnDemand for Academics.\n\nIf you are using SAS Enterprise Guide, then you might need to speak with your SAS Administrator for more help. Frequently, Enterprise Guide users are working with server files and you'll need to be sure you have the right physical path for your session of EG. Your SAS Administrator can help you with that.\n\nCynthia\n\nHi:\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1 --Go to the Course Overview and Data Setup section of Programming 1\n\n2 -- Find your method of using SAS. Based on a screen shot you posted elsewhere, it looks like you use localhost:10080 to access SAS Studio. That means you are using SAS University Edition\n\n3 -- Open the instructions for YOUR method of using SAS -- for you, that means clicking on the SAS University Edition instructions\n\n4 -- Look in the instructions at the name of the folder you are creating for class. There are 2 possibilities: 1) EPG1V2 or 2) PG194.\n\n5 -- Go here: https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Creating-Data-for-Programming-1-and-Programmi...\n\n6 -- Read the beginning information\n\n7 -- Find the right orange button and click it. There are 2 orange buttons: 1) EPG1V2 or 2) PG194.\n\n8 -- Find the video for your method of using SAS. Watch the video. Reread the instructions. Watch the video again. Now, go back the instructions and follow them, step by step. Do ALL the steps.\n\n9 -- At the end of this, you should have a folder called EPG1V2 (or EPG194) in your shared folder location and you should be able to see the files that were created AFTER you followed all the steps in the instructions.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nCynthia"
