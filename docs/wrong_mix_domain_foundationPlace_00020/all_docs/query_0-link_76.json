        "text": "Throughout the year, SFPD officers based at the police headquarters, are assigned full-time to proactively engage with the community through relationship building, events, forums, panel discussions, participation in community events, working with community leaders, and leading a variety of special programs to benefit local youth. In addition, this unit promotes community policing and community engagement in support of District Station activities.\n\nCED officers participate in programs like backpack journeys with middle-school students, homework assistance, turkey giveaways at Thanksgiving, tree and toy giveaways during the Holiday Season and they also attend neighborhood events.\n\nThe CED works closely with all ten SFPD districts by collaborating with a designated liaison allowing each station to keep CED informed of upcoming community events and concerns. The CED is committed to its continued work with community leaders in order to build on reciprocity and shared understandings of the concerns within the diverse communities represented in San Francisco. As a department, we are dedicated to understanding the various concerns and needs specific to each group."
