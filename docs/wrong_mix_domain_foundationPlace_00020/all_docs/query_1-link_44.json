        "text": "I am missing something super basic here, if someone could please help I would really appreciate it. I have many custom made and downloaded materials in many different types of folders. It seems pretty straightforward to try and get SU Pro 2018 to look at the folder I want. I go to Preferences>Files>Materials and select the folder on my computer where I have all of my materials. But when I do this the materials browser doesn’t show what is in the folder that I have on my computer. I am at a loss, what am I missing?\n\nTried and it did not change what is displayed in the materials window\n\nYes, I’m aware of this. The materials are all saved as .skm. What is the most strange is that it is the folder structure that I’m pointing to in the Preferences is not even showing up. What I mean is that I am pointing to a folder called “Materials” and within that folder are many subfolders, it doesn’t even show these folders. It just seems to show the default folders.\n\nThe last couple posts have made me wonder if what I am expecting SU to do is not what you all are expecting. Take a look at the screenshots to see what I am seeing. To me it seems like the SU materials window drop down should match the folder that you select in the preferences dialogue. Can I only get my folders to show up in the favorites section? If so what’s the point of setting the path in the preferences section?\n\n{oops, here are the screen shots}\n\n!\n\n… or what the software itself is expecting (because it is programmed to do something else) ?\n\nExcept that it has never done this, and the User Guide has never claimed that it does this.\n\nSketchUp User Guide: Setting Software and File Preferences\n\nThose paths in the Files panel of the Preferences dialog only serve as the default path for the system Open and Save file dialogs. See the table here for specific information for each path …\n\nSketchUp User Guide: Setting Software and File Preferences > Choosing default locations for files\n\nSo to test:\n\nPaint something in a model with one of the distro’d materials.\n\nThen switch to the “In Model” materials collection.\n\nRight-click on that materials (or any within the model) …\n\n… and choose “Save As…”\n\nThe system Save panel dialog will open in the folder path you specify in Preferences > Files.\n\nIf you instead choose “Export Texture Image” from the right-click context menu, you’ll notice that the system Save dialog opens in the one of the other paths set there. (I notice it bugly opens in the “Watermark” path rather than the “Texture” path in SU2016.)\n\nThe same holds true for the other paths concerning components, etc. Whenever you need to open or save a file these paths are used. (It is sort of a override of Windows built-in MRU paths, which always take you to the last path you saved a certain file extension type. These overrides allow a stable place you can expect the dialog to open at. Sometimes desired sometimes not.)\n\nIf you want the Materials browser to automatically populate your Materials inspector panel, place your materials subfolders in your \"%AppData%/SketchUp/SketchUp 2018/SketchUp/Materials\" folder.\n\nIf you are an administrator, you can create a symbolic link in the parent directory that points at some other “Materials” folder. (This makes sense as the SKM files are really version independent zip archives. I would prefer to have support for base folders up a few levels under the \"%AppData%/SketchUp\" folder that are not version dependent and do not need migrating each year as we upgrade.)\n\nOtherwise for now you’ll need to create a collection / or add to favorites.\n\nThanks, I see now the purpose of the file path. I have an (incorrect) memory of being able to get SU to do what I described in previous versions of the program. I must just have confused this with something else.\n\nI was trying to avoid this just to make it a little easier moving from version to version but I suppose it’s not a very big deal. I will just copy over my materials or access them via. the favorites.\n\nIt always annoys me when programs don’t allow you to remove or hide certain features. My collection of materials is the one I want to use, having the dialogue show me the stock materials menu just takes up space and time.\n\nThanks for the help all."
