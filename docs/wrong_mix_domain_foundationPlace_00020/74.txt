The Foundation Center's mission is to strengthen the nonprofit sector by advancing knowledge about U.S. philanthropy. The Center is the nation's leading authority on philanthropy, connecting nonprofits to tools they can use and information they can trust. We operate a library-learning center in downtown San Francisco and offer free training classes.

We maintain the most comprehensive database on U.S. grantmakers and their grants called The Foundation Directory Online. It is a robust, accessible knowledge bank for the sector.
