Who We Are

Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Prism Foundation is dedicated to exploring critical issues that affect the Asian & Pacific Islander LGBTQIA+ community and supporting innovative programs and individuals seeking solutions to those issues.

Currently, we provide academic scholarships to non-traditional API LGBTQIA+ students and core funding to under-resourced and underrepresented local community organizations and projects.

In addition to the monetary support, we also seek to nurture and support these organizations for future growth and independence through infrastructural support such as mentorship and leadership development.

Funding

Prism Foundation is committed to providing accountability, transparency, and value to our donors and supporters who are integral partners in our stewardship of the API LGBTQIA+ community. Largely funded by individual donors, our donor base is as diverse as the community we serve. From donor advised grants to planned giving, we hope to provide our donors with impactful giving opportunities.

As an exclusively volunteer-run organization, we are able to dedicate a vast majority of donor funds directly back into our programs such as our scholarships, grants, and fellowship program.
