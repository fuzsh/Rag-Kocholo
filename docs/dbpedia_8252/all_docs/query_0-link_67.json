        "text": "Beyond our logo, color is the most recognizable aspect of our brand. Our color palette helps audiences identify us at a glance. The way we use color sets the mood for each piece and reflects our heritage and surroundings. Our communications draw on three color palettes to unite them.\n\nNote: Many of these colors should look familiar because most of them, including the primary orange and blue, have not changed. Several colors in the secondary and accent palettes have changed, so even if they look similar to those you’ve used in the past, use this guide to ensure that you are using the correct colors.\n\nOur color palette is bold and distinctive. It relies primarily on our heritage colors of orange and blue – and generous white space. Secondary colors are used for deeper content levels in layouts and for breaking up headlines. We create a modern look that elevates our momentum by leaning on our heritage colors and plenty of open space.\n\nNote: Always use the color values listed in this section when using color builds. They have been adjusted for the best screen and print reproduction and may not match Pantone Color Bridge breakdowns.\n\nAt our core, we are orange and blue. As part of our brand’s visual language, we express that in all its forms by expanding the flexibility of these two colors.\n\nWith that in mind, this palette unifies the brand’s colors, reflecting our institution’s philosophy and mission.\n\nNote: Always use the color values listed in this section when using color builds. They have been adjusted for the best screen and print reproduction and may not match Pantone Color Bridge breakdowns.\n\nTwo color gradients are available for use. They pair our Core Blue with Dark Blue and our Core Orange with Alachua.\n\nNote: Premade gradient swatches are available for download at our online brand center. Go to Downloads, and under Brand Toolkit, choose Color Swatches. To build your own, please follow the guidelines pictured below.\n\nOrange and blue should drive most marketing, campus, and alumni materials, but sometimes other colors are needed. For those circumstances, we have developed this secondary palette.\n\nThese colors are best suited for internal communications, but they may also be used in long-form communications where more colors are needed for variety, infographics, and icons. Large fields of these colors should be avoided. Be sure that our primary orange and blue are always the most prominent colors.\n\nUnder no circumstances should any of these colors become the predominant color for a school, center, institute, or department.\n\nNeutral tones can add depth, warmth, sophistication, and richness to our communications. Note, however, that white should be used more frequently and prominently than these neutrals.\n\nNote: White is an indispensable color. Rather than viewing it as a blank area, see it as a break. Please don’t rush to fill it: it can focus attention on what is there rather than drawing attention to what isn’t. Always balance color, typography, and graphic elements with open space.\n\nNote: We only use black for long passages of body copy. Never use it in any other way.\n\nLike printed colors, screen-based colors should be consistent across multiple pages and sites, and a limited color palette is well-suited for digital applications.\n\nAll communications should follow the brand’s core color palette. The hexadecimal values of our core palette have been optimized for accessibility on light and dark backgrounds, which can be found above.\n\nTo learn more about using the UF Brand Colors with dark mode, download the following presentation: Designing for Dark Mode.\n\nFor additional information, contact us using the form at the bottom of this page.\n\nColor Consistency:\n\nUse hexadecimal values to ensure that colors are consistent across print and screen applications. Hexadecimal values of our colors are adjusted for AA Normal Text Compliance (tested on webaim.org color contrast checker)."
