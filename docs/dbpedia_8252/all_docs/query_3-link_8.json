Restrictions are derived from international laws or directives, regulatory agencies, eco‑label requirements, environmental standards, and Apple policies. Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates except for AC power cords in India, Thailand (for two‑prong AC power cords), and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement.

Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances for new products where technically possible."
