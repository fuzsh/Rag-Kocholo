        "text": "Was this helpful?\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nThe feedback you submit here is used only to help improve this page.\n\nThat’s great! Thank you for your feedback!\n\nThank you for your feedback!\n\nAbout Formatting Answer Choices\n\nOnce you’ve created a question and formatted it the way you want, it’s time to add choices for your respondents to pick from. This page covers all the ways you can add, remove, and customize the answer choices to your questions.\n\nAdding Answer Choices\n\nTo add answer choices, select the question and then click the plus or minus sign beneath Choices on the editing pane to choose how many choices you want your question to have. You can also click directly on the number of choices and type the number of choices you want.\n\nEditing Answer Choices\n\nTo edit an answer choice, simply click directly on the text of an answer choice within the survey editor and type the choice into the text box.\n\nYou can start editing the next answer choice below it (or add a new choice if you’re at the end of the list) if you hit the return or Enter key while editing an answer choice, as seen below.\n\nQtip: Click the arrow next to your answer choice for more answer choice customization options, such as adding answer choice display logic or changing the choice’s font. See Additional Dropdown Options for more information.\n\nAttention: If you’ve already collected data, be careful when editing answer choices, as it may invalidate your data! See Editing an Active Survey for more information about what edits are OK.\n\nEdit Multiple\n\nYou can edit all of your answer choices at once with the Edit multiple feature.\n\nSelect the question you wish to edit.\n\nSelect Edit multiple within the editing pane.\n\nIn the text box, type each answer choice, separating new choices with line breaks.\n\nClick Apply to save your changes or Cancel to eliminate them.\n\nAttention: The Edit multiple feature is disabled as soon as you collect data on your survey. This is to prevent invalidation of your data. If you copy a survey where this feature has been disabled, the copy will also not contain the Edit multiple feature.\n\nSuggested Choices\n\nQualtrics has suggested choices that can help you build questions. These contain answer choices for common survey questions, such as demographics or asking satisfaction on a standardized scale. To add suggested choices:\n\nSelect the question you want to add these choices to.\n\nEnable Use suggested choices.\n\nSelect the choices you want to use from the drop-down menu.\n\nIf desired, select Reverse order to use choices in the reverse order, e.g., from “agree to disagree” instead of “disagree to agree”.\n\nUnder Choice display, choose from the following options:\n\nShow all: Select this option to add the suggested choices and give each scale point its own choice text.\n\nExample: In this example, we added suggested choices for “agree” to “disagree,” so each answer choice has text.\n\nShow first and last: Select this option to insert the suggested choices but only give the first and last scale points their own choice text.\n\nExample: In this example, we added suggested choices for “agree” to “disagree,” so only the first and last answer choices have text.\n\nIf desired, adjust the number of suggested choices you need. Since these are based on text provided by Qualtrics, you won’t be able to decrease the number of choices past a certain point. You can always add extra answer choices, in case you want to include an additional option, such as “N/A” or “Don’t know.”\n\nQtip: Suggested choices may appear on your question automatically. The software looks for key terms and builds out answer choices for you. For example, in the screenshot below, the software recognized the phrase “How satisfied” and built out a Likert scale accordingly. Disable this by deselecting the Suggested choices checkbox for the question, or click the drop-down menu to select a different choice list.\n\nAdditional Dropdown Options\n\nWhen you click to edit an answer choice, there’s a dropdown with lots of useful settings that can enhance your choices. For example, if your list of choices includes “Other,” you can add a text box to this choice so the respondent can elaborate; you can add display logic to a choice, so that respondents don’t see choices that are irrelevant to them; you can open the rich content editor, and change the font color and size of your answer choice; and much, much more.\n\nQtip: Some of these options will vary depending on the question type and format you are working with.\n\nAllow Text Entry, Text Entry Size, and Text Entry Validation: Enables text entry on the answer choice (e.g., an “other” text box) while also allowing you to choose the text box size and any specific requirements for the text entry answer.\n\nRich Content Editor: Allows you to edit the formatting of your answer choice by adding bolding and font effects, inserting images, and more.\n\nInsert Graphic: Allows you to insert an image as part of the answer choice.\n\nExclude From Analysis: Excludes the data for this answer choice from data analytics and reporting. The data for answers marked as Exclude From Analysis is still recorded; it is only ignored in analyzing the data.\n\nQtip: Sometimes, you may change your mind about excluding an answer choice from your response data. If you deselect Exclude From Analysis after your survey is live, you’ll be able to see the answer choice in your Data & Analysis tab.\n\nInsert Piped Text: Inserts piped text, which dynamically displays your desired text based on the respondent.\n\nAdd Display Logic: Allows you to add display logic to answer choices, so you can hide or show certain answer choices when conditions are met.\n\nAssign to Group: Allows you to group answer choices together.\n\nMove Up & Move Down: Allows you to move your answer choices up and down in the list.\n\nRemove Choice: Deletes your choice from the question.\n\nAllow Text Entry\n\nSometimes you may need to give respondents an option outside of your list of answer choices. Allow Text Entry lets you add a text box to your answer choice, allowing respondents to enter their own answer choice.\n\nExample: Let’s say you ask respondents to pick their favorite ice cream flavors from a list. If their favorite isn’t listed, you can create an “other” option for the respondent to specify their favorite flavor.\n\nAttention: Allow Text Entry is not compatible with dropdown multiple choice questions.\n\nAdding & Removing Text Entry on Answer Choices\n\nSelect the answer choice you’d like to add text entry to.\n\nClick the arrow next to the answer choice.\n\nSelect Allow Text Entry.\n\nTo remove text entry from a question, follow the same steps above.\n\nText Entry Size\n\nOnce you’ve allowed text entry on your answer choice, you can choose the size of the text entry box.\n\nSelect the answer choice with text entry.\n\nClick the arrow next to the answer choice.\n\nSelect Text Entry Size.\n\nChoose the size of your text entry box. Your options include:\n\nSmall\n\nMedium\n\nLarge\n\nQtip: Preview your survey to make sure you like the size of your text entry box!\n\nText Entry Validation\n\nFor answer choices that have Allow Text Entry enabled, you can force participants to input only a certain type of text response. For example, you might be looking specifically for a response that includes only numbers.\n\nSelect the answer choice with text entry.\n\nClick the arrow next to the answer choice\n\nSelect Text Entry Validation.\n\nChoose the type of validation to use. Your options include:\n\nForce Response\n\nQtip: If the respondent chose the option with text entry on it, they have to fill out the text box. For example, if you chose “Other,” you can’t submit the question without specifying your choice.\n\nValid Email Address\n\nValid Phone Number (You can choose the country)\n\nValid US State\n\nValid Postal Code (You can choose the country)\n\nValid Date (You can choose what format)\n\nNumerical Value\n\nQtip: This validation allows respondents to use periods (.) and commas (,) as part of their numerical value.\n\nText Only (Non-numeric)\n\nInsert Graphic\n\nInsert an image into the answer choice. See Inserting Graphics into Answer Choices for a full guide on using images in answer choices.\n\nQtip: You can also insert images into an answer choice using the Rich Content Editor.\n\nAdditional Graphic Options\n\nOnce you’ve used the Insert Graphic option, additional settings will appear in the dropdown.\n\nEdit Graphic: Choose the graphic to insert into the answer choice. This can be from your library, or you can upload a new image to your library.\n\nEdit Text: Text for the choice that displays with the graphic.\n\nText Position: Make the text display to the top, bottom, left, or right of the graphic.\n\nRemove Graphic: Remove the graphic from answer choice.\n\nGraphic Size: Change the size of the graphic. You can choose from preset dimensions, or choose Custom to adjust the size manually. If you’ve resized the image, you have the option to select Show full size when clicked. This means the image will change back to its original size when the respondent clicks it.\n\nExclude from Analysis\n\nWhen an answer is excluded from analysis, this means the data is hidden from data and reports (not deleted). The excluded value won’t be used to calculate averages, sums, or other aggregate metrics; won’t appear in filters or data exports; will be automatically excluded in Stats iQ; and will be hidden in recorded responses, Results-Reports, Advanced-Reports, and Results Dashboards.\n\nExample: Let’s say you’re collecting feedback from students about a training you ran, and you ask your respondents to rate the training on a scale from 1-10. You include a “N/A” option for respondents who may have missed the training. You can mark the “N/A” option as Exclude From Analysis so it doesn’t influence your data analytics, such as calculating the average score of the training.\n\nSelect the answer choice you want to exclude.\n\nClick the arrow next to the answer choice.\n\nSelect Exclude From Analysis.\n\nOnce enabled, the choice will be marked with a symbol. You can change this setting at any time without deleting your data; this option merely hides the data.\n\nThe following text isn’t case-sensitive and will automatically turn this setting on:\n\nNone of the Above\n\nNA\n\nN/A\n\nNot Applicable\n\nI Don’t Know\n\nDon’t Know\n\nMake Answer Exclusive\n\nSome questions let respondents select multiple choices at a time. However, sometimes a choice like “None of the above” is provided which doesn’t make sense to pair with any other choices. Make Answer Exclusive ensures a specific answer can only be selected by itself.\n\nExample: Let’s say you ask respondents to select which store locations they’ve recently visited. You include “None” as an option for respondents who haven’t visited your stores. You can then mark “None” as Make Answer Exclusive so respondents can’t select that option with other choices. In the below example, we can see the other selected answer choices are automatically deselected when the respondent selects an exclusive answer choice.\n\nSelect the answer choice you want to make exclusive.\n\nClick the arrow next to the answer choice\n\nSelect Make Answer Exclusive.\n\nQtip: If you don’t see this option, that means your question doesn’t allow multiple answers.\n\nOnce this option is enabled, that particular answer choice will be marked with a symbol, and it can’t be selected with other answer choices.\n\nAssign to Group\n\nYou can group your answer choices together to help keep yourself and your respondents organized. This is especially useful for long lists of answer choices.\n\nQtip: The Assign to Group option isn’t available for all question types and formats. If you want to use choice groups but don’t see the option available for you, try changing the question’s formatting.\n\nExample: In this example, we ask respondents to select what products and services they’ve purchased. We group together similar items to make organization easier.\n\nAssigning Choices to Groups\n\nClick the choice you’d like to categorize.\n\nClick the dropdown.\n\nHover over Assign to Group.\n\nIn the New Group field, type a group name.\n\nPress Enter or return on your keyboard.\n\nWhen you go to assign the next choice to a group, you can select the group you just made, or create a new group.\n\nQtip: You can add display logic to answers in a group. If all answers are hidden, the group title won’t appear.\n\nCustomizing Groups\n\nClick into a group’s name and click the dropdown to view additional options for customization. For example, you can make some groups single-select and another multi-select.\n\nHide Group Title: Hide the group title in the survey editor and when taking the survey. By default, this option isn’t enabled and respondents will be able to see your group titles.\n\nRich Content Editor: Edit the name of the group and any corresponding images or font effects using the Rich Content Editor.\n\nMove Up / Move Down: Move the entire group up or down the question.\n\nSelection:\n\nSingle Answer Within Question: When you choose an answer from the group, this is the only answer you can provide for the whole question.\n\nSingle Answer Within Group: When you choose an answer from the group, this is the only answer you can provide for the whole group. You can still select answers from other groups.\n\nMultiple Answer Within Question: You can choose any number of answers across the question, regardless of group.\n\nRandomization:\n\nUse Question Randomization: Use the question’s choice randomization settings. This also means that if you have no randomization settings, none will be applied.\n\nNo Randomization: Do not randomize the answer choices.\n\nRandomize the order of all choices: Randomize the choices within the group.\n\nRemove Group: Delete the group. When this happens, all choices in the group are saved, but no longer belong to a group.\n\nMove Choice Up & Down\n\nMove the choice up by 1 or down by 1 by clicking the dropdown and selecting Move Up or Move Down. This doesn’t affect your data, but merely rearranges your answer choices in the question.\n\nQtip: These options come in handy if you are adding new choices to a survey that’s already collected data. See Testing / Editing Active Surveys for more details.\n\nFormatting Answers in Different Project Types\n\nThe options described on this page are available in just about every type of project where you customize a survey. This includes:\n\nSurvey projects\n\nXM Solutions\n\nEngagement\n\nLifecycle\n\nAd Hoc Employee Research\n\nPulse\n\n360\n\nQtip: For details on customizing 360 surveys, see Creating & Editing Questions (360).\n\nConjoint\n\nMaxDiff\n\nQtip: For details on customizing MaxDiff and Conjoint surveys, see this page.\n\n'>\n\nOnce you’ve created your survey, you’ll want to test it to be sure it looks and behaves exactly how you need. Similarly, if you need to make changes after you’ve launched your survey and started collecting results, it’s important to understand what types of changes are acceptable and what types might not be best for your data collection. This page outlines your options for testing your survey and for editing an active survey.\n\nThe side by side question allows you to ask multiple questions in 1 condensed table.\n\nFor each question in a survey, you can enable behavior that enhances your survey design, such as randomizing answer choices, hiding the question based on certain conditions, adding default choices, and more.\n\nThe Emails section of the Messages tab in a Lifecycle project is where you will invite participants to take your Lifecycle survey and invite participants to view any dashboards you have shared with them. You can automate your survey invite so that newly added participants automatically receive an invitation email. After you’ve sent emails, you can view the history of your mailings.\n\nMaxDiff is dependent on setting up the features into coherent questions respondents can easily choose between. From this tool, you will also choose the format of the MaxDiff questions' presentation, and more.\n\nSometimes you'll need to reuse the same list of choices for many of your questions. Instead of copying and pasting the same choices over and over, you can create reusable choices."
