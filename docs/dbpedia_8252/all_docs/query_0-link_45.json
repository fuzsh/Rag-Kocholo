        "text": "Removing Nail Polish from Various Fabrics\n\nHow to Get Nail Polish Out of Jeans\n\nScrape off any excess from your jeans with a plastic spoon or knife before rinsing under cold, running water. Try not to rub the stain as this could force polish further into the denim fabric. The higher the water pressure, the easier excess polish will be to remove. Before beginning any treatment, be sure to check your jeans care label for specific instructions.\n\nSoak a rag or microfiber cloth in some nail polish remover. Non-acetone removers are less harsh on fabric, but you should first test by dabbing the soaked cloth in an inconspicuous area to see if any discoloration occurs. If there are no signs of discoloration or damage, place a white paper towel or cloth under the stain and work from the outside in, dabbing at the stain to transfer polish onto the towel beneath\n\nTo treat the remaining spot, use a cotton swab or clean white cloth with dish soap and, again, work from the outside in on the stain, replacing the swab with a clean one as it picks up color from the polish. Be careful not to saturate or rub the stain as this could cause it to spread, then wash your jeans. Select a cycle using the hottest wash temperature on the garmentâs care label using your favorite Tide Detergent.\n\nHow to Remove Nail Polish from a Shirt\n\nScrape off any excess from the shirt using a blunt edge or plastic knife. Once youâre satisfied youâve removed as much excess as possible, run the stained area under cold water, the higher the pressure the better. Be careful not to rub the stain as it could force the polish deeper into the fabric. How you pretreat and wash a nail polish stain on a shirt will depend on its fabric. Before beginning any treatment, be sure to check the shirtâs care label for specific instructions and consult a professional cleaner if necessary.\n\nSoak a rag or microfiber cloth in some nail polish remover. Non-acetone removers are less harsh on fabric, but you should first test by dabbing the soaked cloth in an inconspicuous area to see if any discoloration occurs. If there are no signs of discoloration or damage, place a white paper towel or cloth under the stain and work from the outside in, dabbing at the stain to transfer polish onto the towel beneath\n\nTo treat the remaining spot, use a cotton swab or clean white cloth with dish soap and, again, work from the outside in on the stain, replacing the swab with a clean one as it picks up color from the polish. Be careful not to saturate or rub the stain as this could cause it to spread. Wash the shirt on the usual cycle using the hottest wash temperature allowed by the care label. Always check the instructions on the garmentâs care label.\n\nWill acetone bleach clothes?\n\nAcetone is a clear, volatile, and strong solvent that can dissolve or break down materials like paint, grease, and stubborn oils. As such, itâs a common ingredient in nail polish removers and other cleaners. Due to its strength, acetone can bleach fabrics or strip garments of their dyes, so whenever youâre using acetone-based nail polish removers on fabrics, you should always test in an inconspicuous area to see if damage occurs before applying to any stains. As always, you should consult the care label on your fabrics before beginning any stain treatment.\n\nHow to Remove Dry Nail Polish from Couch Fabric\n\nScrape off any excess from the couch using a blunt edge or plastic knife to get nail polish out of the fabric. Once the excess has been removed, soak part of a clean white cloth in hydrogen peroxide. Be sure to test the hydrogen peroxide on an inconspicuous part of the sofa to ensure no color bleeding or fabric damage occurs. Blot the stain gently with the hydrogen peroxide, being careful not to rub or press it further into the fabric. Also, do not use acetone or acetone-based products as these can damage upholstery.\n\nUsing a clean sponge or white cloth, soak in warm water and use to remove the rest of the nail polish stain and hydrogen peroxide residue. If the stain persists, you can also try some white vinegar on the stain, then blot away with warm water. Repeat the process as necessary, using a little bit at a time, until the stain is removed.\n\nIf the stain still persists, you can try removing fingernail polish with a bit of liquid dish soap. Mix one tablespoon of soap to two cups of cool water, being sure to mix together thoroughly. Dip a clean white cloth or sponge into the solution and dab gently at the stain until the nail polish is absorbed. Continue until youâre satisfied the stain is removed, then sponge the area clean with cool water and blot with a white cloth to dry."
