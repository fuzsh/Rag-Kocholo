        "text": "Nail art has become increasingly popular in recent years with people of all ages and styles looking to add a little personality to their nails.\n\nWith so many different options available, it can be hard to know how much you should expect to pay at a salon. Despite the high cost of nail services, nail art remains a popular choice for many people who enjoy expressing their personality through their nails.\n\nHere is a quick guide to the range of prices you can expect to find for standard, deluxe, gel, and acrylic nails at salons in 2024.\n\nSee Related: 17 Insanely Easy Nail Art Designs To Accomplish At Home\n\nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO GET YOUR NAILS DONE?\n\nAN AVERAGE PRICE CHART FOR NAIL SALONS IN THE US\n\nHere's the cost breakdown of the average final price of professional manicures and pedicures in the United States, depending on the nail service type.\n\nSTANDARD NAIL ART PRICES\n\nManicure $20-$40\n\nPedicure $30-$50\n\nDELUXE NAIL ART PRICE\n\nManicure $30-$50\n\nPedicure $35-$55\n\nACRYLIC NAIL ART PRICES\n\nBasic Set $30-$60\n\nFull Set $50-$80\n\nFill $15 - $20\n\nGEL NAIL ART PRICES\n\nBasic $35-$45\n\nCeleb-Level Nails $60-$100+\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE GETTING YOUR NAILS DONE WITH A NAIL TECH\n\nWhen it comes to getting your nails done, there is a lot to consider. Not only do you have to choose the right color and style, but you also need to factor in the most important question: \"How much does it cost to get my nails done?\"\n\nThe price will vary depending on the nail technician and nail artist you pick, as well as the complexity of the nail design. If you're looking to get your nails done in 2024, here's what you can expect from a nail shop:\n\nA STANDARD MANICURE\n\nStandard nail art with nail polish typically costs between $15 and $35 per design. This includes simple designs on painted nails like stripes or polka dots, as well as more complex designs that use multiple colors and even colored powder.\n\nIt's important to note that every nail shop will have its own definition of \"standard.\" A regular manicure at one nail salon might include a French manicure with French tips, while another nail salon's basic manicure will simply cover a natural nail look.\n\nBe sure to talk to the nail artist and nail technician beforehand to understand how they price their basic manicure.\n\nDELUXE MANICURE\n\nDeluxe nail art includes detailed designs or 3D elements such as gems, rhinestones, fake jewels, nail charms, and more. Generally, a deluxe manicure will cost anywhere between $30 and $45 per design.\n\nIf you decide on gel polish or an artificial nail shape, you'll also need to factor this into the cost. Designs on natural nails will be cheaper for sure, but it all depends on the nail salon you go to and what type of design you're looking for.\n\nACRYLIC NAILS\n\nAcrylic nail prices can cost anywhere from $30 to $60 per design, depending on the complexity of the design and the number of colors used.\n\nTypically, long acrylic nails cost more than short acrylic nails simply because there's more room for the acrylic to cover. That's why acrylic manicures vary so greatly in price. On the other hand, acrylic fills that hide the regrowth from previous acrylic are much cheaper because they only less time and product.\n\nAdditionally, many prefer acrylic nails because they are more durable than gel polish. Acrylic nails also typically require less maintenance than gel nails or even regular polish, and are the easiest way to achieve a no-chip result.\n\nHowever, gel-based polish is significantly easier and more cost-effective to remove. The cost of acrylic nail removal can be up to $100 at any nail salon.\n\nSome people remove broken acrylics at home with a kit that can cost anywhere between $10 and $30. However, removing acrylic nails at home can be risky, causing damage to your natural nails if done improperly.\n\nUltimately, just know that the cost will vary across nail technicians and large or small nail shops. There's plenty to love about acrylic French tips. Just make sure you can save your nail tips after the fact.\n\nGEL MANICURE & GEL NAIL POLISH\n\nGel nail art is the most expensive option, typically costing between $35 and $50 per design. If you want to have celeb-level nails it can cost you up to $100 depending on the design.\n\nHowever, gel nails also last longer than other types of manicures. In fact, you can expect gel polish to last anywhere from 2-3 weeks. And to increase the longevity of a previous gel manicure, all you need is a simple gel fill.\n\nUltimately, you may save money by choosing gel nails as an option. Plus, it's far easier to remove gel polish yourself and doesn't cause nearly as much damage to your natural nails as acrylics do.\n\nBonus: 47+ French Tip Nail Designs To Try With Our French Tip Stamping Plates\n\nA STANDARD MANICURE GENERALLY INCLUDES:\n\nNail trimming, filing, and buffing to help your natural nails grow and remove any rough edges\n\nShaping your nail shape to match the nail look you're going for, i.e. short nails, long nails, coffin nails, etc.\n\nComplete cuticle care for your nail beds, pushing back and trimming dead skin from cuticles using nail oil to further promote nail growth\n\nApplying polish to the nail bed with either a clear or colored lacquer\n\nApplying additional polish to give your painted nails the final look\n\nMany nail salons also offer additional services such as hand and arm massages. This can make your manicure all the more relaxing and enjoyable.\n\nFor gel manicures, the nail salon will use an LED light or UV light to cure the polish and create a long-lasting finish.\n\nSTANDARD PEDICURES SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING SERVICES:\n\nWhen choosing a nail salon, make sure you ask how much their pedicures cost too. A basic pedicure will typically include the following:\n\nTrimming and filing the nails\n\nComplete cuticle care applied to your toes\n\nFoot exfoliation with a pumice stone to remove dry skin, followed by a foot massage with light oil\n\nFinally, polish to achieve the final look\n\nMost pedicures include a soak in a whirlpool foot bath to soften the skin and nails. While there are variations among different nails, this is generally what is included in a standard pedicure.\n\nAdditional services may also be offered for an added fee, including a paraffin wax treatment, an extra-long luxury massage treatment, or a stone pedicure, where a nail technician rubs hot stones along your calf to release tension.\n\nDELUXE PROFESSIONAL MANICURE\n\nThis option should include a wide range of services to leave your hands and nails looking and feeling their best.\n\nFirst, your nails will be filed and shaped to your liking\n\nCuticles will be trimmed and excess skin will be removed to allow for a neat and polished appearance\n\nNext, your nails will be buffed to create a smooth surface to prevent chipping and give your nails a glossy finish\n\nFinally, you will enjoy a relaxing hand massage before your nails are painted with your choice of color\n\nWith all of the steps listed above, a deluxe professional manicure is a perfect way to achieve beautiful and healthy-looking hands and nails.\n\nDELUXE PROFESSIONAL PEDICURE\n\nFor a deluxe professional pedicure, you should expect nothing but the best. This means that the nail tech should have plenty of experience.\n\nAnd they'll only use high-quality products to treat your nails. Here are some of the services that should be included in a deluxe professional pedicure:\n\nFoot soak in a relaxing foot bath\n\nExfoliating your skin to remove dead cells\n\nTrimming and shaping your nails\n\nApplying cuticle oil to nourish your nails\n\nApplying a luxurious foot cream to moisturize your skin\n\nMassaging your feet and lower legs to relieve tension\n\nPolishing your nails with a high-shine finish\n\nADD-ONS\n\nMost salons offer a wide range of add-ons for manicure and pedicure services. Common add-ons include paraffin wax treatments, hot stone massage, exfoliating scrubs, and aromatherapy, just to name a few.\n\nWhile these add-ons can help to enhance the overall experience, it is important to choose those that are right for you. For example, if you have sensitive skin, you may want to avoid harsh chemicals or exfoliating scrubs.\n\nInstead, opt for a paraffin wax treatment or aromatherapy, which can help to soothe and relax the skin. When choosing add-ons for your manicure or pedicure, be sure to mention any allergies or sensitivities you may have and ask about which services will best suit your needs and preferences.\n\nWith a little bit of research, you can ensure that you have a relaxing and enjoyable experience at the salon.\n\nHOW MUCH DO MANICURES COST?!
