        "text": "Wherever summer’s plot takes you, there is a manicure to match. Imagine the sun glistening on your metallic nails as you grasp a refreshing drink on a rooftop. Or perhaps you are enjoying some R&R in Turks and Caicos, and as you take a dip in the ocean, your glossy aqua-blue nails camouflage into the waves. Dreamy, no? “We’re shaping up for a vibrant season of nail trends,” says New York City-based nail artist Julie Kandalec.\n\nWith summer 2024 nail color trends taking inspiration from the liveliest scenes of the season, brands—including JinSoon, Olive & June, and Essie—are launching new collections to match. Vibrant shades like jelly pink, tangerine, and ocean blue “capture the essence, energy, and romantic allure of the warmer months,” says Kandalec.\n\nAnd electric shades aren’t the only option. A pastel butter yellow is a shockingly wearable swap for your usual paired-back neutrals—plus, the shade pairs beautifully with a classic summer white pedicure. On that note: Experts predict fresh whites will be just as popular on your fingertips as the color has always been on your toes. Ahead, discover a rainbow of nail polishes to have on rotation all summer long.\n\nMeet the experts:\n\nJinSoon Choi is a New York City-based nail artist.\n\nLonna Janee is a California-based nail artist and V Beauty Pure educator.\n\nJulie Kandalec is a New York-based nail artist.\n\nAlexandra Rivera is a Florida-based nail artist.\n\nAmy Ling Lin is the founder of New York City-based salons and nail brand Sundays Studio.\n\nButter Yellow\n\nLast summer, pool nails took over our feeds. This year, we’re headed to the shore. A coastal ocean-blue shade makes for a bold statement on its own or as an accent color. Florida-based nail artist Alexandra Rivera recommends a deep sea-inspired vertical ombré manicure, like the one pictured here—play around with different shades of blue to create a dimensional look. We love the Manicurist nail Polish in Ultramarine. For a gel option reach for the Madam Glam gel nail polish in Matty.\n\nManucurist\n\nManucurist Green Natural Nail Polish in Ultramarine\n\nMadam Glam\n\nMadam Glam Soak-Off Gel Polish in Matty\n\nChilli Pepper Red\n\nThe heat is on this summer—and we recommend a fiery, red-hot nail lacquer to match. Two favorites: No. 13 from Sundays (an Allure Best of Beauty winner) and Dior Vernis in 999 Rouge both provide an opaque, glossy finish in a warm, red hue. This chili-pepper shade is “an energetic and spicy mood booster that harnesses the vibrant energy of the season,” says Amy Ling Lin, Sundays Studio founder.\n\nSundays\n\nSundays Nail Polish in No. 13\n\nDior\n\nDior Vernis Nail Polish in 999 Rouge\n\nMolten Metallics\n\n“Metallics remain a summer favorite,” says Kandalec. In the coming months, purple will have its shining moment. Kandalec loves Lights Lacquer Birthday Wishes (a cool metallic lavender) and KB Shimmer What a Pearl Wants (a multi-colored metallic polish).\n\nLights Lacquer\n\nLights Lacquer Nail Polish in Birthday Wishes\n\nKBShimmer\n\nKBShimmer Nail Polish in What A Pearl Wants\n\nSummer White\n\nWhite linen sets, white sand beaches, a classic white pedicure…the fresh hue is practically synonymous with summertime. “It’s a versatile color that makes your skin appear tan and instantly brightens your overall look,” says Lin.\n\nAllure editors love Sundays No.1, a pure white polish that takes inspiration from fresh linens, and OPI Funny Bunny. Going on vacation and looking for even longer wear? A few coats of Aprés’ gel nail polish in Baby’s Breath will carry you through.\n\nAprés\n\nAprés Gel Coleur in N01 Baby's Breath\n\nSundays\n\nSundays Nail Polish in No. 1\n\nOPI\n\nOPI Nail Lacquer in Funny Bunny\n\nJelly Pink\n\nA popsicle is an idyllic treat on a steamy day—and it’s become the inspiration for one of our favorite new manicures. Jelly nail polishes are an easy way to mimic the “popsicle-stained” effect and the formulas are especially pretty in pink. “The summertime is the perfect time to take advantage of all the different shades of pink… a soft pastel or maybe something neon but jelly pink will be the most popular,” says Janee.\n\nAllure’s editor-in-chief Jessica Cruel recently traveled to Seoul where nail artist Park Eunkyung, aka Unistella, gave her the popular jelly nail treatment in a vivid shade of magenta. That said, you don’t have to travel the globe to get this look. We love JinSoon’s Whisper, a soft jelly rose shade for a subtle manicure, and Olive & June’s Jelly Baby for a slightly brighter jelly finish.\n\nJinsoon\n\nJinsoon Nail Lacquer in Whisper\n\nOlive & June\n\nOlive & June Long Lasting Polish in Jelly Baby\n\nTurquoise\n\nLooking for a shade that will pop with your favorite sandals or on a white sand beach? Turquoise is the answer. Lin predicts the minty blue-green shade will be on everyone's toes and is a big fan of the “happy, cheerful color.” Paint on Gucci Glossy in 713 Dorothy Turquoise or OPI Cactus What You Preach for a long-lasting pedicure that will hold up through several beach days.\n\nGucci\n\nGucci Glossy Nail Polish in 713 Glossy Turquoise\n\nOPI\n\nOPI Nature Strong Natural Origin Lacquer in Cactus What You Preach\n\nMore nail trends:"
