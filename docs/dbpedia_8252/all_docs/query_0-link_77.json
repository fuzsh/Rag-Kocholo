        "text": "Hair dye can stain along your hairline and face where the dye was applied. Because facial skin can be more sensitive than skin elsewhere on your body, you’ll want to avoid harsh or very abrasive cleansers in this area.\n\n1. Soap and water\n\nYour first defense when you notice hair dye on your skin should be to use soap and warm water to try to remove it.\n\nIf you start to wipe off the dye before it dries or shortly after applying the dye, this may be enough to remove it. If not, or if it has already stained your skin, you may need to try one of the additional methods below.\n\n2. Olive oil\n\nOlive oil is a natural cleanser that may help remove stains from your skin. This may be an especially good option for people with sensitive skin, but anyone can try it.\n\nTo use, pour a small amount of olive oil on a cotton ball, or use your finger and gently rub it into the stained area of your skin. Leave it on for up to 8 hours.\n\nIf you’re going to sleep with it on, you may want to cover it with a bandage or plastic so it doesn’t stain anything.\n\nTo remove, wash it off with warm water.\n\n3. Rubbing alcohol\n\nRubbing alcohol can be harsh and drying to skin, so this may not be a great option if you have very sensitive or dry skin.\n\nTo use as a dye remover, pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton ball or cotton pad. Gently dab it on the stained portion of your skin. Once the dye is off, be sure to rinse the area with warm water and soap.\n\n4. Toothpaste\n\nToothpaste can help remove stains from teeth, but it may also help remove hair dye stains from your skin.\n\nUse a non-gel toothpaste, and apply a small amount onto a cotton swab or your finger. Gently massage it over the dye on your skin. Leave on for 5 to 10 minutes, and then remove with a washcloth soaked in warm water."
