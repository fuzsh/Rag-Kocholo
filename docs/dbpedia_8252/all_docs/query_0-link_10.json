        "text": "This is Color Club Abyss, from the Color Club Kaleidoscope collection, one of two they have recently released with nary a whisper.\n\nTwo coats here, no top coat â€“ the formula was pretty good, there was the occasional blob but that was more about user error than the polish. And dry time was quick, too!\n\nNice and shiny without top coat, as well. I bought this one from Head2Toe beauty, online. Itâ€™s nice- a pretty mid green creme, almost emerald hued but with a lovely murky blue tone to it. Not teal, still green, but nodding in Tealâ€™s direction. These photos show this polish as more blue than it is, but in the sunlight (as here), it really does throw a lot more blue.\n\nThen I added one coat of Ozotic 509, a gorgeous silver super-holo which works as a top coat over almost everything as well as a gorgeous silver polish on itâ€™s own.\n\nSo pretty!\n\nRainbowsâ€¦ mmmmm.\n\nAnd then, one coat of Ninja Polish Alexandrite, topped with Misa BREAKneck top coat.\n\nThe shimmery glitters in Alexandrite were sheer enough that the holographic effect of the Ozotic polish was still clearly visible, as was the base colour of Abyss.\n\nI counted this as a layering win, even though I couldnâ€™t really capture the colour shift of Alexandrite (purple to green) as well as I would like, or the strength of the holographic effect of the Ozotic, we had NO sunshine when I was wearing this!\n\nAh well, shift happens regardless of photographic evidence ðŸ˜‰\n\nHave a wonderful day\n\nAmi ðŸ™‚"
