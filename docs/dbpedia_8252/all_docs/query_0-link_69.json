        "text": "Purchased by me, affiliate links used\n\nHi friends! Today I have a whopper of a blog post for you all. For Spring 2024 OPI said to themselves “Go big or go home baby!” and released TWENTY ONE nail polishes. This has to be one of the biggest, if not the biggest single collection that I have ever swatched. The sheer size is very reminiscent of 2022 PPU blog posts!\n\nThe OPI Your Way collection is available now at the following retailers, Amazon, Target, Sally Beauty and Ulta. I purchased my bottles from Polish Pick. This collection is available on Beyond Polish. If you would like to pick up this release at a discount as well as support the blog, use code NicoleLovesNails to save an additional 10% on Beyond Polish.\n\nIf you would like to see these polishes in a variety of light sources, be sure to check out my live swatch video on my YouTube channel!\n\nLive Swatch Video\n\nOPI is a US based mainstream brand. Their polishes are in 15ml bottles and 3 free.\n\nApricot AF\n\nDescription: the yassification of apricot. This creamy finish is bright AF\n\nApricot AF OPI’s official description of this polish is probably going to win the record for the funniest nail polish description EVER. I never would ever dreamed I would see “yassification” to describe a nail polish.\n\nThe color on this is so dang pretty. It’s not neon but it’s bright. Formula wise, I didn’t love this though. It’s kinda streaky and self levels a little slowly.\n\nDue to it self leveling slowly, it does NOT like to be overworked. You will want to employ careful application methods with this polish to get the best overall look.\n\nMy photos show Apricot AF in 3 coats plus glossy top coat.\n\nButtafly\n\nDescription: a soft yellow shimmer that’ll make your heart flutter\n\nButtafly oh how I wish the shimmer in this polish was stronger! This would have been so dang pretty with a more visible shimmer. I think the dash of shimmer in here is supposed to give the polish a glow from within.\n\nSadly because this polish is a pastel yellow, the formula is super streaky and hard to apply evenly. Even with floating coats on I couldn’t get this to get even coverage.\n\nMy photos show Buttafly in 3 coats plus glossy top coat.\n\nGlazed N’ Amused\n\nDescription: Glaze for days with a pearl sheer that can be layered over any color\n\nGlazed N’ Amused this is what I think that glazed donut nails trend (and the lip gloss nails trend) from last year was supposed to look like? This is a fairly sheer shimmer that is super glowy!\n\nThe shimmer does show brush strokes and has a slight pearly look to it BUT the shimmer is so strong and glowy that I am not at all annoyed at the pearly vibes. There’s also a very subtle peachy/orange to pink color shift.\n\nThe formula on this was pretty good, it does run down the stem of your brush a little bit but nothing so bad that it feels watery.\n\nMy photos show Glazed N’ Amused in 3 coats plus glossy top coat. I was able to see my nail line and various imperfections through the base so that’s something to note.\n\ngLITter\n\nDescription: top off any look with this LIT apricot sheer\n\ngLITter I love how shimmery and sparkly this polish is. So much so that I am going to look past that the name of this polish is glitter without actually having any glitter in it.\n\nThis is more of a sheer jelly with a ton of shimmer so you do need to build it up to get opacity. If you want to see the color you see in the bottle, you will want to go for three coats.\n\nI found this reminds me of the glass fleck polishes that were so popular years ago. I don’t think this is a glass fleck polish but it reminds me of them.\n\nMy photos show gLITter in 3 coats plus glossy top coat. Nothing in here will dry down textured but removal will be pretty messy.\n\nGliterally Shimmer\n\nDescription: a sparkly yellow sheer topper that’s gliterally everything\n\nGliterally Shimmer and finally we have some glitter! I had high hopes for Gliterally Shimmer since there was glitter involved. This is very much an iridescent glitter and shimmer topper. It’s not the most color shifty iridescent glitter, you will mainly see a yellow/gold to green color shift.\n\nThis had a fantastic formula, it was a little bit thicker than I expected but not at all overly thick. I do think I will likely add a little bit of thinner to it next time I reach for it though.\n\nI loved how this looked in one coat over Material Gworl. The polish is in a clear base so pretty much any base color will look good. The glitters and flakies are fairly dense so I don’t think it will be great over detailed nail art.\n\nAs far as toppers go, I feel like it’s not as impressively iridescent as my other toppers. I did however really like how this looked with a matte top coat!\n\nMy photos show Gliterally Shimmer in 1 coat over Material Gworl plus both glossy and matte top coats. You will want top coat to keep this one smooth, removal will be really messy if you scrub it off.\n\nMaterial Gworl\n\nDescription: a dark brown creme that’s nothin’ but fabulous\n\nMaterial Gworl talk about perfection! Everything about this polish was pure perfection, except for the name. That name is pretty cringey but the polish was amazing.\n\nThis was pretty much a one coater on me. It applied buttery smooth, self leveled perfectly, and again was perfect. This is one of the polishes that I was most looking forward to in this release and I am so happy that it wasn’t a letdown!\n\nThis shade of brown seems like a warm toned brown, that feels very much like a dark orange. If OPI had called this a burnt orange, I would totally buy that.\n\nMy photos show Material Gworl in 2 coats plus glossy top coat. While I didn’t personally experience any staining, I would highly suggest wearing base coat.\n\nSnatch’d Silver\n\nDescription: a silver sheer glitter that’ll snatch any color you layer it on\n\nSnatch’d Silver had a thicker formula but still applied easily. The glitter mix in here is all fairly small so won’t dry down super textured but you will still want top coat.\n\nWhere Gliterally Shimmer was a yellow/green iridescent, this is more blue/purple.\n\nOPI didn’t call this a topper but I was really disliking how it looked built up so I ended up using it as a topper on my ring and pinky nails. I opted to go for one of my favorite blues, Night Owl Lacquer’s Feeling Nauti. Either I still didn’t pick the right base color or this is just not the polish for me personally.\n\nMy photos show Snatch’d Silver in 2 coats on its own and 1 coat over a blue creme.\n\nSpice Up Your Life\n\nDescription: add a little spice with this rich caramel creme\n\nSpice Up Your Life this polish is inspired by the Spice Girls and no one will ever be able to tell me different!\n\nMuch like the other brown creme in this release, the formula and application were fantastic! Opacity was also superb, damn near being a one coater.\n\nI love that OPI has some atypical spring colors in this collection. While I wouldn’t describe this color as a caramel brown, to me it’s more warm toned camel brown. I could also buy someone calling this a burnt orange.\n\nMy photos show Spice Up Your Life in 2 coats plus glossy top coat.\n\nSuga Cookie\n\nDescription: like frosting sweeten up any shade with a sheer layer of purple glitter\n\nSuga Cookie I feel like it’s a bit of a stretch to call this a glitter polish, it’s definitely a sheer shimmery pearl in my book.\n\nI do think formula wise, this was pretty good. The base felt thicker than I expected not so thick that I needed to add nail polish thinner.\n\nFor me personally, I am starting to notice that I prefer pearls in 2 coats so I opted to swatch this one in two coats. You could add a third to gain opacity but you will still have VNL after three coats.\n\nSadly even when built up in three coats, it still doesn’t have the same color on the nail as it does in the bottle.\n\nI swatched Suga Cookie in 2 coats on its own and in 1 coat on my ring finger over Sweet & Sour Lacquer‘s Purple Blur Sauce (previous PR).\n\n$elf Made\n\nDescription: Today’s forecast: a 100% chance of $howers thanks to this green creme\n\n$elf Made despite all of the dollar signs, this isn’t really a shade of green that makes me think ‘money’.\n\n*Verified*\n\nDescription: a bright blue cream that verfiably’s iconic\n\n*Verified* is a standard baby blue cream.\n\nI found the formula on this one to be pretty good. It applied evenly and self leveled great.\n\nMy photos show *Verified* in 2 coats plus glossy top coat.\n\nWithout A Pout\n\nDescription: a hot pink creme\n\nWithout A Pout had a pretty good formula. It seemed to self level a little bit slower than I expected but it did self level. Overall coverage was pretty good.\n\nI am not sure if it’s because the polish self levels a little slower or because it doesn’t like being overworked but I did notice that I had some uneven spots after two coats. Do NOT overwork this one.\n\nMy photos show Without A Pout in 3 coats plus glossy top coat.\n\nI had originally thought this was going to be a lot more similar to the new Essie polish called Blushin & Crushin from the Essie Spring 2024 collection. They’re not similar.\n\nInfinite Shine Exclusives\n\nWe also have a few polishes in this release that are exclusive to the OPI Infinite Shine line. The Infinite Shine line is OPI’s version of “gel like” polishes. While the marketing calls these gel they air dry just like regular nail polish. I treat polishes in the Infintine Shine line the same as regular nail polish.\n\n24 Carrots\n\nDescription: make nails drip in a seriously shiny bright orange creme\n\n24 Carrots is a super bright and very cute orange creme. It’s a lot brighter than I would guessed from a spring collection but I am not mad at that one bit.\n\nUnfortunately, the formula was a little chalky and had that same slow self leveling application that quite a few polishes in this release have.\n\nCoverage wasn’t the best for me in two coats. I had a few darks spots on my nails so I opted to add a third coat for my photos. I do think with top coat that this would likely be ok in two assuming you aren’t super picky about dark spots.\n\nMy photos show 24 Carrots in 3 coats plus glossy top coat. I am going to call this one a 2-3 coater depending on your application.\n\nI originally questions why on earth we would have two bright oranges in this release. Seeing them side by side, they aren’t really terribly similar so I get it.\n\nBasic Baddie\n\nDescription: a basic that’s anything but basic. This creamy tan has extreme shine\n\nBasic Baddie is not at all a color that I really graviate strongly towards but for whatever reason, I love how clean it looks?? I am having a little “who am I?” moment wearing this polish because it’s so not me!\n\nBasic Baddie had a fantastic formula. It always SO smoothly and evenly. Coverage was also fantastic, not a one coater but close.\n\nMy photos show Basic Baddie in 2 coats plus glossy top coat.\n\nBleached Brows\n\nDescription: Y2K called and said this shiny beige creme is BACK\n\nBleached Brows I am by no means a fashion girlie (my Twilight tshirt collection can attest to that) but I was definitely more interested in such things back in 2000 so hearing that bleached brows were a cool thing that year is a surprise to me. I had thought bleached brows were like 2010s and overplucked brows were still in in 2000?\n\nAnyway, this polish also had a fantastic formula. Super creamy and smooth application with a not too think or too thin formula. Much like my reaction to Basic Baddie, I was so surprised at how much I loved this polish!\n\nMy photos show Bleached Brows in 2 coats plus glossy top coat.\n\nBubblegum Glaze\n\nDescription: a shimmery bubblegum pink glaze that’ll pop off on top of any shade\n\nBubblegum Glaze is the obligatory pale pearlescent in this release. The base didn’t feel overly thick or thin and it in generall applied decently. I tried really hard to get this one to apply evenly without dark spots or streaks but even after three coats they were still prevant.\n\nI preferred the level of opacity with this polish in two coats but I found I didn’t like the amount of unevness in the base so I opted to swatch it in three coats. You do get some brush strokes through the pearly shimmer which is typical with shades like this one.\n\nMy photos show Bubblegum Glaze in 3 coats plus glossy top coat.\n\nFirst Class Tix\n\nDescription: a turquoise creme that’s your first class ticket to shiiiiine\n\nFirst Class Tix I love this color so much! The formula was a little bit on the thicker side and it seemed to self level a little bit slowly but it did self level.\n\nIt was also super opaque, if you go in for thicker coats this could be a one coater.\n\nI originaly thought this was going to be similar to China Glaze For Audrey which is a Tiffany Blue shade. This is brighter and more saturated than For Audrey.

This is more of a chartreuse than a true lime green, in my opinion at least. I never really get why so many polishes that have lime in the name are never actually the colors of actual limes.\n\nThis is a bright and vibrant shade of chartreuse. It starts off fairly streaky with slow self leveling so much like the others, I would say do not overwork the polish. With careful application this will be good in two coats.\n\nMy photos show Get In Lime in 3 coats plus glossy top coat. All of my nails except for one was opaque in two coats, I only added three to all of them so that I had the same number of coats on all of the nails.\n\nI generally find colors like this are major stainers for my natural nails so make sure to wear base coat with this one.\n\nGlitter Mogul\n\nDescription: a glittery sheer topper that’ll make you an instant $uccess\n\nGlitter Mogul it is a crying shame that this polish lacks actual glitter in it. Glitter Mogul is a shimmer topper that shifts gold/yellow, green with blue a VERY extreme angles.\n\nThis had a really great formulation. The base didn’t feel overly thick or thin, zero application issues. My only complaint is WHERE IS THE GLITTER???\n\nI paired it in one coat over Without A Pout. Nothing in here will dry textured and removal will be very easy.\n\nOn Another Level\n\nDescription: a seriously shiny electric pink creme that’s giving main character energy\n\nOn Another Level I am sure it’s getting repetitive at this point but, like the other cremes this one has was a little slow at the self leveling and didn’t like being overworked.\n\nI’ll be honest, a pink creme is something. that from a brand like OPI I kinda expect to be 10/10 amazing as far as formula and application go. So It’s kind of a shock that this one was a little finicky.\n\nMy photos show On Another Level in 3 coats plus glossy top coat. I will call this a 2-3 coater assuming you apply it carefully without overworking it.\n\nI did have some deja vu when I swatched this one as I could have sworn I had swatched it already. It is not terribly similar to Without A Pout but in my mind they were very similar until I got them side by side.\n\nPearlcore\n\nDescription: the world is your oyster when you layer this shiny pearl sheer over color\n\nPearlcore had a pretty good formula. In typical pearl fashion, you do get some brush strokes through the shimmer. On the plus side, you do get a nice color shifty moment from Pearlcore. I was able to see a pinky purple to blue color shift.\n\nThis is a fairly sheer polish so even when building it up, you will still have some VNL with it. Coverage is fairly even so this has some topper potential.\n\nI generally find I prefer pearl shades in two coats over three so my photos for this show it in two coats on its own and in 1 coat over a black creme.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nHoly moly this collection was MASSIVE! I knew going in to swatching this collection what I thought were going to be my favorite shades. I love that this is an atypical color story for a springtime release. I especially love all of the brown shades.\n\nI do think that with a collection this big, with the intention to have layer-able shades more toppers would have be nice. I know I am seemingly in the minority of wanting glitter toppers but it would have been nice to have a couple more thrown in.\n\nMy biggest dislike from this release is just the size of it. I fully recognize that as a brand, OPI likely thought that the only people buying the full collection would likely be nail salon owners and nail techs and not nail polish collectors/reviews like yours truly but this collection was just so freaking big!\n\nI also wish the formulas were a tiny bit better. I wouldn’t do so far as to say they were bad but I do also think they could have been better. I have come to live the OPI creme formula so when I get a creme from them with a wonky formula it’s confusing.\n\nMy top picks from this release are going to be Material Gworl, Spice Up Your Life, Gliterally Shimmer, Without A Pout and First Class Tix. Basic Baddie and Bleached Brows are my honorable mentions.\n\nFeel free to leave a comment and let me know what you thought of this release!\n\nOPI\n\n15ml, 3 Free\n\nWebsite | Instagram | Twitter | TikTok\n\nSale Information\n\nThe OPI Your Way collection is available now at the following retailers, Amazon, Target, Sally Beauty and Ulta.
