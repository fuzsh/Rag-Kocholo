        "text": "(Yes, one of them is nail polish remover.)\n\nSorry, but what were you doing painting your nails on the carpet anyway? Friend, you know better than that. But hey, accidents happen. Maybe the cat stalked through and flicked over your bottle of Lincoln Park After Dark, sending shimmering, oil-slick splatters all over the imported rug that you paid a pretty penny for. Or you just forgot to put the nail polish lid back on all the way and enjoyed a post-pedi Dandasana, kicking that Game of Chromes across your thick, plush bedroom carpet. The hypotheticals are endless. It doesnât actually matter how it happened because weâre going to help you fix itâbefore anyone else even notices!\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nA few things: Best to catch the nail polish stain while itâs fresh. And donât freak out. Whatever you do, donât rub it in. The key to getting nail polish out of carpet is to blot, blot and blot.\n\nSo before you even attempt to remove the stain with any product, grab a rag or some paper towels (or, if itâs a lot of nail polish, you can scoop up the liquid with a plastic spoon) and gently dab at the spot until most of the excess nail polish is gone and youâre just left with a mark on the carpet.\n\nIf it does happen to be a dried nail polish stain (oops!), try scraping at it with a knife. Weâd go with a sharp paring knife or something similar. Mind your fingers. Use a vacuum attachment to suck up the hard, dried nail polish bits before proceeding.\n\nNow behold, our choose-you-own-adventure guide for cleaning nail polish out of your carpet. Select which technique works best for you, depending on what sort of cleaning supplies youâve got on handâor pantry items to use as DIY cleaning solutionsâthe type of carpet and how bad the spill is.\n\n6 techniques for removing nail polish from carpet\n\n1. Use White Vinegar To Clean the Carpet\n\nSoak the offending nail polish stain with a generous amount of white vinegar. Yes, this is going to smell super weird. Vinegar and nail polish, blech.\n\nLay a vinegar-soaked rag on top of the stain. Yep, more vinegar.\n\nLet the whole deal sit for about 10 minutes.\n\nBlot the stain with the vinegar-soaked rag.\n\nScrub (yes, itâs okay to do it now) the mark with a clean, damp rag. If youâre super offended by the smell, try mixing a drop of dish soap like Dawn with warm water and dab at the (former!) stain, then rinse with clean water.\n\nIf youâre still miffed by the odorous vinegar/nail polish combo, hit the spot with some Febreze Fabric Spray, which comes in a variety of fresh scents that arenât vinegar or nail polish.\n\nLet the spot air dry completely.\n\n2. Mix It Up With A Baking Soda & Ginger Ale Stain Remover\n\nDump some baking soda onto the nail polish stain, covering it completely.\n\nSoak the spot with ginger ale.\n\nLet the solution sit for about 10 minutes.\n\nBlot the stain with a clean, damp rag until the stain is gone.\n\nLet the spot air dry completely.\n\nVacuum up any baking soda residue thatâs left over.\n\n3. Repurpose Ready-Made Cleaning Products to Spot Treat\n\nSeveral store-bought cleaning products are known for getting nail polish out of carpet and can be used to spot treat the stain. As with all widely available cleaning products, be sure to follow the directions on the label. Most require a clean rinse to finish with a damp rag.\n\nWindow cleaner with ammonia\n\nAdhesive remover\n\nDry cleaning solvent\n\n4. CAREFULLY Use A Bit Nail Polish Remover\n\n(So obvious, right?!)\n\nOnce youâve successfully removed the nail polish from the carpet (congrats!), hit the spot with a quick soapy water bath to help get rid of any potential leftover residue from your cleaning productâand to help diffuse that pungent nail polish smell. (Oh, and in case youâre looking for more ways to make your house smell good, weâve got some ideas.) Add a small drop of dish soap like Dawn to warm water to dilute it. Scrub the affected carpet area with a sponge or clean rag soaked with the soapy water solution. Rinse the soap residue with warm water by blotting it with a clean, damp rag. Let the spot air dry completely.\n\nWe know you didnât learn your lesson. Youâll continue to paint your nails on the couch, in bed and splayed out on the carpet in front of the television, streaming Riverdale or whatever. We donât blame you. But now that youâre hip to the ways of how to get the nail polish out of the carpet, youâre really free to do as you wish. A lot of these techniques can be applied to upholstery, too. But you should still be at least a little conscientious about where you spill your nail polish, since you do risk discoloring the fabric with some, if not all, of our stain removing tricks.\n\nBut what better excuse to treat yourself to a mani-pedi at the salon? After all, you didnât want to risk ruining the carpet, dah-ling.\n\nOh and hey, when youâre done painting your nails, you should totally sanitize your makeup. Yep, thatâs a thing."
