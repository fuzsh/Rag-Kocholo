        "text": "Press Sample\n\nI have 6 previously released piCture pOlish shades to share with you today that are fairly well known and some classic piCture pOlish shades.\n\nWhile I love the flare of sparkle and shimmer in polishes, I was first drawn to piCture pOlish by their cremes and the beautiful shades and flawless application, but you really can’t dismiss their shimmer and sparkle either!\n\nLet’s take a look at these 6 shades and then some stamping I did.\n\nSky\n\nSky is a light sky blue creme. Flawless in application and I used 3 thin coats for these photos.\n\nTiffany\n\nTiffany is a flawless eggshell blue with a touch of mint. I used 2 coats for these photos and if you can only have 1 creme from piCture pOlish, this should be it.\n\nViolet Femme\n\nI have been eyeing this beauty for awhile and it was worth the wait. Violet Femme is an intense violet creme. I used 2 coats for these photos.\n\nVampire\n\nVampire is a shade that I don’t know how I missed! This is a blood red jelly that looks like blood on the nails. I know that sounds gruesome, but it’s true. I used 3 thin coats for these photos.\n\nElectric Dream\n\nElectric Dream was made in collaboration with Nail Polish Anon. Electric Dream is a coral scattered holo with gold sparks. I used 2 coats for these photos.\n\nBridget\n\nBridget is a deep red scattered holographic. I currently have this on my toes (don’t worry, I don’t do feet photos!) I used 2 coats for these photos.\n\nStamping With Violet Femme & Scandal\n\nI keep playing with the Vampy Chameleon shades I purchased and when I put on Violet Femme I thought it would be the perfect base to stamp over with Scandal! I love that it’s fairly subtle from a distance but has the right amount of shimmer and holo to give it some life.\n\nPrice: AU$11.00 – $13.00 Each\n\nWhere To Buy: piCture pOlish Website or one of the stockists in their Network from all over the world!\n\nSocial Media: Facebook | Twitter | InstaGram |Youtube|Pinterest|Google+\n\nWhat did you think of these shades? Do you own any of them?"
