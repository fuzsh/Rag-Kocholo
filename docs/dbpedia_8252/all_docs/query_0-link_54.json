        "text": "Concrete surface etching agent\n\nAmeripolish® EZ Etch cleans excess mortar, free latent lime, grease, oil, food stains and organic material from concrete floors and also opens up the pores/surface of the concrete to prepare it for penetrating products such as Ameripolish® ColorJuice E, AquaShield, overlay concrete systems and water or solventbased sealers.\n\nEZ Etch is enviromentally friendly and nonabrasive for use on polished concrete, stone, terrazzo, and other custom concrete surfaces.\n\nRapid surface prep agent for wet/dry concrete grinding\n\nAmeripolish® EZ-Kut Grinding Agent is a water- based grinding agent, used for the initial cut on hard, dense concrete and helps with exposing large aggregate faster than dry or wet methods.\n\nEZ-Kut also helps by dramatically increasing productivity of lower-grit diamond tooling. EZ-Kut Grinding Agent suspends concrete solids away from the surface for diamond tools to achieve maximum efficiency which reduces the project timeline, reduces labor costs, and extends the life of the diamond tooling. Can be used as part of a full flood wet process, or a mist as part of dry grinding.\n\nLiquid Grout Coating System for Dry Polishing\n\nAmeripolish® LG-7K mixes with the dust created while grinding concrete floors to create a super-durable matrix that automatically fills pinholes, small air voids, pop-outs, micro-cracks and other gaps in the concrete surface during grinding. LG-7K creates a monolithic surface that polishes faster, easier and more effectively. With gaps and imperfections filled, the floors accept Ameripolish® densifiers, protective treatments and color-stains more evenly.\n\nAmeripolish® LG-7K also makes floors easier to maintain by eliminating the tiny nooks and crannies in concrete that trap and accumulate soil and other contaminants. The easy-to-apply treatment dries fast and is suitable for any floor undergoing grinding, from warehouse-industrial to highly polished aesthetic floors.\n\nWater-based microbial stain remover\n\nAmeripolish® Oil Ingester is an enzyme-based product that consumes and breaks down oil-based materials and absorbs odors from the surface of the concrete without causing damage or affecting any existing colorant, sealer, or stain protector. The biodegradable product is environmentally safe and can be left on surfaces for several days if needed to deeply penetrate seeped stains.\n\nPenetrating curing agent\n\nAmeripolish® PCA is a penetrating curing agent that chemically hardens and dust-proofs concrete for improved abrasion resistance without forming a coating. PCA is recommended on newly placed concrete to add initial water and stain repellency while retaining slab moisture for improved curing. PCA requires no UV light for dissipation and can be used with integrally colored concrete.\n\nUnlike traditional cure and seal products, PCA does not form a membrane that must be removed via chemical strippers or aggressive metal bond tools prior to polishing.\n\nPolishable grout coating system\n\nAmeripolish® PG-7K is a fast-setting, polymer-modifed, high-strength cement with outstanding bonding properties formulated specifcally to fll in small cracks, pinholes, and surface irregularities in concrete ﬂoors. It also increases durability, gloss and distinction of image (DOI) on most ﬂoors. PG-7K readily accepts Ameripolish® concrete dyes and requires no special polishing procedures. Ameripolish® PG-7K Part A – Powder must be used with PG-7K Part B – Liquid.\n\nPolishing Abrasives\n\nThe SmartFloor™ Refinement System concept is engineered to provide a high-aesthetic floor that is an easy and economical way to utilize any polishing machines, including power trowels. The SmartFloor™ Refinement System consists of pads that have composite resin abrasive technology embedded in their design.

Classic Dyes can be used as a base color or touch up for concrete that has received integral color, dry shake hardeners, acid stains or even layered to create a truly unique, mottled effect.\n\nExterior concrete colorant\n\nColorJuice E concrete colorant is a fast, easy way to apply color to some types of interior and many types of exterior concrete. ColorJuice E is an improved formula of the old ColorJuice 3D and has an identical application process. It provides durable, rich hues by bonding color pigment directly into the concrete.\n\nColorJuice E is ideal for porous concrete finishes such as broom-finished or stamped concrete including pavements, porches, patios, driveways, sidewalks and pool decks. ColorJuice E can also used for interior concrete (at the appropriate grit stages) such as garage floors, and can be applied to other cementitious surfaces.\n\nSolvent carrier for Ameripolish® dyes\n\nAmeripolish® ColorSolve is a solvent carrier designed and recommended for use with Ameripolish® Classic and SureLock™ concrete dyes. ColorSolve is extremely easy to use and leaves little to no residual dye on the surface. Use of ColorSolve extends the dye coverage rate, increasing it up to 1,000 square feet per gallon!\n\nColorSolve should be applied by using an appropriate solvent sprayer with or without a microfiber mop. Due to the lower evaporation rate of ColorSolve, using an Ameripolish® microfiber mop reduces labor costs, saves time, and extends the square footage of your dye.\n\nUse of ColorSolve does not require taping and masking areas in preparation for the dye treatment. Another unique feature of ColorSolve is that it allows concrete dyes to be applied at higher grit levels such as at 800 and 1,500 grit for color enhancement or reapplication and refurbishing.\n\nChemically bonding dyes for polished concrete\n\nAmeripolish® SureLock Dyes formula has recently been updated making them the most vibrant concrete dyes Ameripolish® has ever produced. SureLock Dyes are versatile colorants for polished concrete that mix with water or Ameripolish® ColorSolve™. SureLock Dyes are to be applied just before densifying with 3D HS or HSL, helping the color penetrate and chemically bond to the concrete\n\nThe predissolved concentrate liquid is fast and easy to use. The formula includes UV stabilizers to resist fading as well as a penetrating agent to eliminate further mixing and develop deep, rich colors even on hard, dense concrete.\n\nFast-setting densifier\n\nAmeripolish® 2D PL is a multi-silicate blend, that is intended for use on extremley porous concrete. 2D PL sets up faster than other Ameripolish® densifiers, this keeps the majority of the 2D PL at the surface of the concrete in order to harden the wearable surface. Its ideal use is on open or porous concrete that will readily accept densifiers. When used in conjunction with Ameripolish® SR² Stain Resistor it is especially effective at resisting stains.\n\nHybrid silicate densifier\n\nAmeripolish® 3D HS (3 densifiers in one product) Hybrid Silicate Densifier improves surface performance and resists the harmful effects of traffic wear and weathering. By having 3 different size molecule silicates this product fully penetrates varying densities of concrete regardless of region or hardness. This improves the abrasion resistance for new or aged concrete. 3D HS is ideal for use for exposed and polished concrete, as well as cements with integral color.\n\nLow solids hybrid silicate densifier\n\nAmeripolish® 3D HSL (3 densifiers in one product) Hybrid Silicate Densifier is formulated with 3 different size molecule silicates to penetrate even the most difficult, tight floor cap. 3D HSL strengthens and densifies from within the concrete by providing strength at multiple levels of the slab. 3D HSL improves surface performance and resists the harmful effects of traffic wear and weathering by improving the abrasion resistance for new or aged concrete. 3D HSL is ideal for use for exposed and polished concrete, as well as integrally colored cements.\n\nFully-pentrating stain resistor\n\nAmeripolish® SR² is a penetrating stain repellent specifically formulated to protect polished, dyed and non-dyed concrete from oil and water-based stains.
