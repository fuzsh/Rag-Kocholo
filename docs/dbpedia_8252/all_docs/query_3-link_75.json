        "text": "Our Color to the Core™ Technology\n\nAll Sunbrella fabrics are manufactured with Color to the Core™ technology. This proprietary process means each foundational fiber is saturated with color and UV-stabilized pigments. Once saturated, the proprietary fiber is spun into yarns which are then woven into our long-lasting performance fabric. Color to the Core™ technology ensures years of beautiful living with color that stays true over time, maintaining the strength and integrity of the fabric through years of cleaning, wear, and exposure to the elements.\n\nMany products imitate the performance of Sunbrella fabrics with a “good enough” performance standard. However, none of these products offer the proprietary formulation, cutting-edge innovations, and extensive styles and textures of Sunbrella. Sunbrella fabrics are the complete performance standard, with best-in-class comfort, color retention, cleanability, and strength that lasts.\n\nWith Sunbrella performance fabrics, exceptional comfort, and unmatched durability go hand in hand. Our complete performance makes Sunbrella fabrics tough enough for the outdoors, and soft and cozy for indoors. Sunbrella performance fabrics include many different weaves and surface textures, still meeting the overall intention: long-lasting softness and comfort. Our yarns have softness and durability woven into each fiber, which makes Sunbrella performance fabrics perfect for creating comfortable spaces.\n\nComfort Soft Touch\n\nWith Sunbrella performance fabrics, exceptional comfort, and unmatched durability go hand in hand.
