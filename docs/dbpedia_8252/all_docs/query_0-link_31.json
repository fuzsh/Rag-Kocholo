        "text": "Flag With One Star\n\nNepal\n\nNepal is a country in South Asia. Nepal has a red, white and blue flag. The flag was adopted on the 28th of December in 1962.\n\nThe national emblem of Nepal consists of the snow lions supporting a stylized lotus flower with each lion facing outwards to symbolize protection from all four sides.\n\nCuba\n\nThe flag of Cuba is divided into three horizontal stripes of blue, white, and red.Â\n\nThe red stripe symbolizes the blood shed in the Cuban revolution; the white represents purity of ideals; and the blue stands for sky and sea.Â\n\nBonus: Flag coloring pages\n\nChile\n\nChile has a flag with a red background and a white star. The flag of Chile is inspired by the flags of the United States of America and France, which were also revolutionary countries at the time.\n\nThe Chilean flag has been in use since 1817, when it was adopted after Tupac Amaru II (the leader) death. It remained unchanged until 1925 when another star was added to represent Antofagasta.\n\nLiberia\n\nLiberia is a country located in West Africa. It was founded by freed American slaves in 1822, making it one of the first countries to be established by former slaves. Liberia is a republic with a presidential system of government; its capital city is Monrovia and English is its official language.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nIt shares land borders with China and South Korea, and also borders Russia.Â\n\nNorth Korea was established in 1948 and its capital city is Pyongyang. The flag of North Korea consists of three horizontal stripesâred, white, and blueâwith a red star in the center of it all.\n\nHorizontal Flags\n\nUnited State\n\nIn the United States, the flag is known as the \"Stars and Stripes.\" When it was adopted in 1777, it had 13 stripes for 13 colonies and a star for each state.Â\n\nSince then, new states have been added to the Union from time to time and thus more stars have been added to reflect this growth. There are currently 50 stars on our national flag.\n\nLaos\n\nIt is bordered by Burma and Thailand to the west, Vietnam to the east, and Cambodia to the south. With an estimated population of 7.5 million people, it is one of the least densely populated countries in Southeast Asia but has a high poverty rate due to its mountainous terrain and lack of industrial development.\n\nCabo Verde\n\nNetherlands\n\nThe capital city is Amsterdam. The official language is Dutch. The currency is Euro. The Netherlands is a founding member of the EU and NATO.\n\nThe Dutch Republic was the first modern country in Europe. It was also one of the worldâs most powerful nations during the 17th century. Today, The Netherlands is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy and a developed economy.\n\nThailand\n\nThe flag of Thailand is a red flag with a white elephant in the middle. The elephant is the national symbol of Thailand and can be seen on many flags and coats of arms across Asia.\n\nThe flag was adopted in 1917, and has remained unchanged since then despite several changes to the Thai government, including several military coups.\n\nRussia\n\nRussia is a country in northern Eurasia. It is the largest country in the world by area, covering more than one-eighth of Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with about 142 million people as of 2019. About 77% of Russians speak Russian as their first language.\n\nRussia has been described as an empire on its periphery that uses expansionism to protect itself from other powers over time (e.g., Ukraine). In recent years, however, some scholars have suggested that Russia should be considered an imperial state because of how it behaves internationally today; whether this is true or not depends on how you define 'empire'.\n\nSlovenia\n\nSlovenia is a country in Central Europe that shares borders with Italy to the west, Croatia to the south and east, Hungary to the northeast, and Austria to the north. It also has a small part of its territory on the coast of the Adriatic Sea in Dalmatia.\n\nParaguay\n\nWhat does Paraguay's flag look like and what does it represent?\n\nThe flag of Paraguay consists of three equal horizontal bands colored red, white, and blue. These colors are actually derived from the military uniforms used during the War of the Triple Alliance (1865-70).\n\nThe red stands for blood spilled in defense of the country; white symbolizes peace; while blue represents strength. The coat of armsâan arm wearing a lion's paw over a staff with five arrowsâis placed in the center of the flagâs white band.\n\nCambodia\n\nCambodia's flag is a horizontal tricolor of red, white and blue with a yellow royal insignia in the center.Â\n\nThe red represents the blood of the people; the white stands for purity of their beliefs, while the blue symbolizes liberty.\n\nLuxembourg\n\nLuxembourg is a small country in Europe. Luxembourg has a constitutional monarchy, and its head of state is Grand Duke Henri.Â\n\nThe monarch holds little political power as executive functions are carried out by the prime minister and his cabinet; however, the monarch does have some influence over foreign affairs and national security issues.\n\nLuxembourg's flag features three horizontal stripes: red on top (hoist), white in the middle and blue on bottom (fly). The colors represent their historic association with those of France's coat of arms: red symbolizes justice; white represents purity; blue stands for loyalty.\n\nCosta Rica\n\nCosta Rica's flag is a horizontal tricolor of red, white and blue. The colors represent the country's natural beauty and unity.Â\n\nThe blue means the sky, the white stands for the snow-capped mountains and the red for the blood spilled in defense of its land.\n\nVertical Striped Flags\n\nFrench\n\nThe flag of France is a tricolor featuring three vertical bands colored blue, white, and red. It is the only official national flag of France and is commonly referred to as the French Tricolor or simply the Tricolor.\n\nThe design of the French flag dates from 1789, when it was adopted by the First Republic.Â\n\nThe colors were chosen to match those used in coins minted at that time: gold for Louis XVI's royal coat of arms, silver for his queen Marie-Antoinette (to remind people she was Austrian), and red as a tribute to Saint Denis, who carried his head under his arm when he was martyred in Paris in 250 AD (a monk later found Denis' skull in a well).\n\nÂ Later versions had fewer stripesâthe current version has threeâbut have always included one white stripe which symbolizes freedom from despotism; today this color is often referred to as liberty blue.\n\nIceland\n\nThe flag of Iceland has a red field with a blue cross outlined in white that extends to the edges of the flag. It was first used in 1219 and is based on an existing flag from that time.Â\n\nThe center of the cross contains a red disk with an abstract rendition of Iceland's coat-of-arms as it appeared on coins during this period: A silver griffin between two smaller blue lions supporting an off-center crown above them.Â\n\nThe design is called a \"tincture\" and calls for two metals to be combined for a color other than black (when one metal is mixed with another).\n\nIn this case, we have red cloth made from wool; silver thread made from cotton; blue dye made from indigo plant extract; and white paint applied over all three tinctures together!\n\nOther Flags\n\nAustralia\n\nSamoa\n\nThe flag of Samoa is red, white and blue. A gold star sits in the upper left corner.Â\n\nA horizontal line separates the white field from the red cross. In the middle of this cross is a white circle with four 5-pointed gold stars that have blue borders on their centers. Blue represents peace while red represents valor, strength and courage.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nThe Czech Republic is a country in Central Europe, bordered by Poland to the north and Germany to the west. It's also a member of many international organizations, including the European Union (EU), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nThe Czech Republic has a population of 10 million people and a GDP of $280 billion.\n\nDominican Republic\n\nThe Dominican Republic flag is a red, white and blue vertical triband. The design was first used in 1845 and later modified in 1912 to add a coat of arms to the center.\n\nAt the time it was adopted, most countries had flags that were either red, white and blue or yellow, orange and green.\n\nFiji\n\nFiji is a country in the South Pacific, bordered by Vanuatu to the west and Samoa to the east. It's known for its white sand beaches and clear waters, which are perfect for snorkeling or scuba diving.\n\nThe flag of Fiji was adopted on 10 October 1874. The flag features three horizontal bands colored red, white and blue; these colors represent courage, purity and peace respectively (the same shade of blue is used on all flags).\n\nPanama\n\nThis flag is based on the flag of Gran Colombia, which was used from 1819 until 1830.\n\nThe three colors on this flag represent the three oceans that surround Panama: red is for the Pacific Ocean, white is for the Caribbean Sea and blue represents the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nâ\n\nCroatia\n\nCroatia is a country in Southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Slovenia to the northwest, Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the south. The capital of Croatia is Zagreb.\n\nThe country is divided into 20 counties and the city of Zagreb with each county having its own local government. Croatia's coastline stretches for more than 1785 kilometers (1,100 mi) along the Adriatic Sea.\n\nCroatian terrain is varied due to its geographic location on a continental shelf off both eastern Alps and Pannonian Basin in Central Europe; it comprises three main types of landscape: mountains (Dinaric Alps), hills (\"Velebit\") which are interrupted with numerous valleys; plains with river valleys (\"Lika\" valley).\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe Union Jack is the national flag of the United Kingdom. It consists of the red cross of St George, edged in white, superimposed on the Cross of St Patrick, which are superimposed on the Saltire of Saint Andrew.Â\n\nThe Union Jack can be traced back to 1606 when James VI (later James I), King of Scots and England, as well as Ireland (and thus also Northern Ireland), was granted a coat-of-arms by John Sigismund - Elector Count Palatine's son Johann Philip von SchÃ¶nborn - with three crowns representing the three realms he ruled over: Scotland (a blue lion rampant), England (a golden lion rampant) and Ireland (a red harp).\n\nIn 1707 these kingdoms were united into one Kingdom of Great Britain, thereby giving rise to what we know today as âThe United Kingdomâ or simply âThe UKâ.\n\nSerbia\n\nThe same design can be found on the coat of arms and flag of Belgrade, but with different colors: red above two golden fields (the first being charged with a Serbian cross and the second one with a Serbian eagle) and white below.\n\nThe national flag was officially adopted on November 11, 2004. It is based on the flag used by the Army of Serbia during World War I when it was still part of Austria-Hungary.Â\n\nThe current design dates back to 1903 when it was adopted as a symbol by an insurrectionist organization called \"Black Hand\". After World War I ended in 1918, Serbia became part of Yugoslavia where this design remained in use until 1992 before being replaced by another tricolor banner featuring only two stripesâred above blue; however this time around they were both equal in width instead of having one superimposed over another like they did previously while under Austro-Hungarian rule (see History).\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNew Zealand, a country in Oceania with a population of 4.7 million people, has red, white, and blue flags. The flag of New Zealand was adopted on July 1st 1902 and is based on the British Blue Ensign flag (with four red stars representing the Southern Cross constellation).\n\nThe Union Jack in the upper corner means that New Zealand was once a British colony (a territory controlled by another state). There are four Maori kiwi birds at each corner of their flag too!\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovakia is a country in Central Europe, with a population of 5.4 million and an area of 49,000 square kilometers.Â\n\nIts capital city is Bratislava. In the 14th century, Slovakia belonged to Hungary, but after World War I it became part of Czechoslovakia.Â\n\nIn 1993 it gained independence from Czechoslovakia and joined the European Union on January 1st 2004. The last country that joined was Croatia in 2013 which makes me wonder why we don't have more red white and blue flags these days!\n\nNorway\n\nWhile Norway is a part of the EU, it also has a red, white and blue flag. This means that Norway is not a member of NATO (or any other military alliance).Â\n\nThe flag's colors are very important in Norwegian history. They were inspired by the English flag and they represent peace and prosperity.\n\nNorway joined the UN in 1946 along with many other countries in Europe at the end of WWII.\n\nLast Words\n\nWith so many countries with red, white, and blue flags, itâs hard to know where this trend began. Some say that it started with the United States, while others argue that it began in France.Â\n\nRegardless of where it started, we can all agree that these colors are a beautiful way to show our pride!\n\nâ"
