        "text": "Welcome to the FENDER STRAT BLUES\n\nA page devoted to Fender Stratocaster BLUE colors that are standard and not so standard.\n\nLast Update: 2024.07.10\n\nDisclaimer: I did the best I could to find accurate color images but not all are perfect. Due to variances of lighting and such the colors on this page may not be an exact match but they are generally pretty close.\n\nMost of these are typical color issues. It’s not uncommon on the internet to have individual sellers that mislabel the color on their Stratocaster so the best TRUE reference is the Serial Number and verify on the Fender Website. if possible. I went to some effort to try to validate these colors when the models were not in production. I’m slowly starting to add years and models.\n\nA lot of these colors look very similar. I can tell you that web picture can vary wildly at tie. I did notice that many models look VERY similar, especial in the “Lake Placid Blue” color range so you’d almost need them side to side to compare. In some cases I included more than 1 photo to show the differences. Because of the pigment change of the top coat of polymer these can move toward the green side as time marches on. (Yellowing on the top coat of polymer)\n\nSATIN FINISHES: A LOT of these also come in Satin finishes, usually an FSR. Satin is simply an unpolished finish. In fact as it ages, it will get wear that will actually POLISH areas that you rub a lot against, lijke the top back area.\n\nNote: I’ve spent a lot of time pulling these together, give me a shout or link if you reference this page, thanks!\n\nAQUATONE BLUE\n\nReleased on Player II series in 2024 – Looks a bit like Miami Blue\n\nBELAIR BLUE\n\nOn the newly released Player Plus (2022+) – Not sure if this was released before but I’ve never found one otherwise.\n\nIt’s a mix of Electron Blue with Opal Spark with Artic White. Very unusual. As beautiful as it is, it’s a love it or leave it mix.\n\nBLUE BURST\n\nPlus Top – This look much better live than it does in the picture. – This has been an FSR favorite of Fender for years now.\n\nFender Player Stratocaster Plus Top (2020’s) and other years.\n\nBLUE AGAVE\n\nStandard Stratocaster – (Looks a bit like Iced Metallic Blue) – This color is heavily affected by Lighting.\n\nThis was very populate in the early 2000’s\n\nBLUE FLOWER (Fender Japan)\n\nBLUE FOTO FLAME\n\nThis color is on a JPN ST-54 Fender Stratocaster. Nice Neck on this one but the body has seen better days.\n\nBLUE FROST (1993)\n\nFender Deluxe Plus Stratocaster in the 90s\n\nBLUE GUNMETAL (rare)\n\nThis very much looks like a 2000’s color dunno what decade these were popular in. A darker Ice Blue Metallic. I’ve never seen one live.\n\nThese did show up on MIM 2000’s and other years and models.\n\nBLUE MARLIN\n\nH.E.R. Limited Edition color\n\nLooks a bit like Lace Placid Blue but with a strong hint of white – Looks nice.\n\nBLUE PEARL BURST (1994) (rare)\n\nI only found one of these. Nice color!\n\nBLUE SPARKLE\n\n1960s\n\nCALIFORNIA BLUE\n\nThis showed up on the Aerodyne Strats of the 2020’s – Looks a bit like Miami Blue but with more white. Nice color.\n\nFender ST43J JPN Standard\n\nCHROME BLUE\n\nAmerican Series – Looks a lot like Cobra Blue but without some of the underlying sparkle.\n\nCOBRA BLUE\n\nMore blue than Lake Placid Blue – A beautiful color. It has a “Mystic” undercoat that gives it a bit of sparkle.\n\nMaybe a new color. On the newly issued Ultra’s (2022)\n\nDARK NIGHT\n\nNew Fender American Professional II color (2020s)\n\nKind of like a reverse of a Blue Burst, fun color.\n\nELECTRON BLUE\n\nA standard color in the 2000’s for MIM – Good color.\n\nELECTRIC BLUE\n\nThis color looks a LOT like Lake Placid Blue. It has a slight Mystic look to it. Great Color.\n\nFADED SONIC BLUE\n\nI’ve never owned one of these but it looks fun, this one if very much a white with a hint of blue.\n\nThis was on a Kenny Shepard Stratocaster. Nice Soft Blue/White color.\n\nICE BLUE METALLIC (Deluxe 2012) FSR\n\nIce Blue Metallic (not the same as Blue Metallic or Ice Blue) is a lighter color of blue. This is a COMMON release/re-release color. It’s slightly whiter than the Blue Metallic.\n\nThe Metallic almost looks “buffed” but not all the way, sort of look. We aren’t talking “sparkles” in the paint like the MYSTIC colors. Bright light washes it out a bit.\n\nTHE one below appears very light and white influenced. Almost like it was a Sonic Blue but more white and buffed. This is a AM Deluxe.\n\nThis one looks like a buffed mystic blue. but it’s Ice Blue Metallic for sure. Vintera series. Notice how it has a dull sheen to it.\n\nJET STREAM BLUE\n\nClassic 50’s FSR – Looks a lot like a cross between Sonic Blue and Daphne Blue\n\nJUPITER BLUE\n\nThis was a Japan release only. never seen one live.\n\nLAKE PLACID BLUE\n\nThey’ve been making this one forever. I have two pictures here because the lighting makes a huge difference with some of these colors. These tints seemed to be all over the place.\n\nThey also make a SATIN version of this.\n\nVery confusing because it can be a light typical version (top picture) or a darker more blue version (see lower pictures) which looks more like COBRA BLUE but it just a lighting issue.\n\nStandard MIM\n\nAmerican Performer SATIN version of Lake Placid Blue (basically unpolished) – NEW\n\nNOTE: THIS PICTURE IS DARKER THAN NORMAL, other pictures show this is a much lighter blue. (see lower picture, same model guitar)\n\nSATIN\n\nA very TRUE picture of the Lake Placid Blue color – NOTE the difference between the top picture and this picture below!\n\nLUCERNE AQUA FIREMIST\n\nFender Eric Johnson Stratocaster\n\nRather a cross between Lake Placid Blue and Ocean Turquoise\n\nMAUI BLUE\n\nJPN Limited Edition Model (2023 to ?)\n\nAnother Aerodyne “matchy matchy” It looks like the CALIFORNIA BLUE\n\nMIAMI BLUE\n\nAmerican Professional II – New color for the most part. (2020s)\n\nMIDNIGHT BLUE\n\n(Popular in the 2000’s) – This one is VERY Unique and recognizable. It’s got purple mixed in with the blue. I’ve also notice that this color is VERY light sensitve and can appear like a deeper blue with less purple under low lighting.\n\nMYSTIC ICE BLUE\n\nCame on upscale American Strats and some upscale MIM like the Roadhouse, also on the Deluxe Plus in the 2010’s. Very much like the Ice Blue Metallic but the silver sparks are much finer in detail. Good color for a silver or aluminum pickguard.\n\nOCEAN BLUE CANDY\n\nThis is a Satin Blue finish, very blue, almost like Cobra blue. Sexy.\n\nOCEAN BLUE METALLIC\n\nLooks a lot like Cobra Blue with a hint of purple. Nice shade.\n\nOCEAN TURQUOISE\n\nThis is really green blue but because there’s blue in it I included it.\n\nOPAL SPARK (Player Plus)\n\nThis looks a lot like Lake Placid Blue but slightly lighter in color.\n\nSAPPHIRE BLUE TRANSPARENT\n\nThey also make a Sapphire Blue without the Transparent, and I believe they make this with a 2 tone paint. I’ll get a pic of that later.\n\nThis is a DELUXE MIM version, and came on Deluxe Players Strat.\n\nDAPHNE VS SONIC BLUE\n\nDAPHNE BLUE\n\nVery common “retro” color and very popular.\n\nSONIC BLUE\n\nNot quite as common as Daphne Blue but also a good Relic color. Lighter than Daphne Blue (like it was made with some added white)\n\nSKYBURST METALLIC\n\nFender Ultra’s color – Also found in Mod Shop (as are most color lines that are in any of the current strats) (2020s)\n\nSTRUCTURAL BLUE\n\nWacky name, It’s a custom shop\n\nTAOS TURQUOISE\n\nI found this in some custom shops and a 57 Eric Clapton Fender, might be in others but not a standard color. Looks a bit like Miami Blue (same color, new name??)\n\nTIDEPOOL\n\nNew for the 2022+ Player Series – Two different pictures, quite a color difference between them!\n\nTide Pool photographs a lot like Ocean Turquoise but the later has more green in it."
