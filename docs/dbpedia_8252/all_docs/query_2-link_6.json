Answer ABSOLUTELY let's find out why, It may even inspire you to rebrand......\n\nHave you ever considered the importance of color in branding? Coke is red. UPS is brown. IBM and I-PRAC is blue. These corporations understand the proper use of color is vital to creating a positive image among consumers. Furthermore, color plays a huge role in memory recall. It stimulates all the senses, instantly conveying a message like no other communication method.\n\nChoosing the right dominant color for your brand is crucial. This color should appear on all your promotional materials, including your logo and product packaging. As much as possible, the color you choose should set you apart, work with your industry and image, and tie to your brand promise. It should also take into account color psychology, which is fairly complex. Colors can mean different things depending on the culture, situation and industry. However, in most countries advertising at least, studies suggest some universal meanings:\n\nTrue-Blue Trust: Why the Colors Your Brand Uses Matter\n\nBlue: Cool blue is perceived as trustworthy, dependable, fiscally responsible and secure. Strongly associated with the sky and sea, blue is serene and universally well-liked. Blue is an especially popular color with financial institutions, as its message of stability inspires trust.\n\nI-PRAC is a brand that represents TRUST within the Short Term Rental Sector, and chose its BRAND colour BLUE....\n\nOur good friends Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn embrace blue. As well as trusty tools like Salesforce, Constant Contact, and Zoom. Even your favorite newsletter, THE LATEST.\n\nOutside of our marketing bubble, we have IBM, Samsung, Ford, Chase, Lowes, GE, Visa, and PayPal all choosing blue for their brands.\n\nBut why so blue?\n\nOur friends over at CoSchedule sum it up nicely:\n\n“Blue is known for its trust and dependability. It's reliable, responsible, and mentally soothing. For that reason alone, it's one of the most-liked colors across the entire world.”\n\nColors in the cool category, like blue, typically evoke emotions of professionalism, authority, and trust.\n\nSo How Do You Make Blue Work For You?\n\nFirst, understand what the color blue means for your audience.\n\nRemember that the shade chosen matters.\n\nThere’s a big difference between teal and “corporate blue” and baby blue, which means that there’s a big difference between the emotions that each of those shades is going to make your customers feel.\n\nColor plays a key role in directing users’ attention. In fact, when HubSpot A/B tested call-to-action (CTA) colors, they “...increased conversion rate without changing anything about the page except for the color of the CTA.”\n\nStrategically using blue on your website will help tell visitors how to feel about the information being presented.\n\nA dark blue background can give a page visual weight and set a serious scene for any content on the page.\n\nA striking bright blue against a lighter colored background, on the other hand, will help your CTA stand out against the rest of the content on the page.\n\nFor an example of this working well in the wild, check out ecommerce platform Shopifyusing periwinkle buttons over a tan background:\n\nWhat was your eye drawn to first?\n\nThe contrast of the blue helps the CTAs jump out at the viewer from a sea of tan, pastel, and otherwise warm, gentle colors.\n\nAlso, note the action that the buttons are asking the user to take - Start free trial.\n\nWe all know what’s on the other side of that click - a form asking you to give away personal and professional information so that you can get your test account set up. Which is to say: a form asking for your trust.\n\nHow best to subtly prepare website visitors for that sort of an ask? Make the button our favorite trustworthy color - blue!\n\nWhile we’re talking trust, let’s cover car loans.\n\nChase Auto’s website uses a trustworthy shade of blue in a graphic that aims to ease the fear of going through an auto loan process.\n\nWhat catches your eye?\n\nIn a grey, white and blue color palette, the green buttons pop and pull the eye first.\n\nBut check out the different shades of blue and simple, easy-to-understand illustrations that are waiting to help you feel safe before clicking that money-green button.\n\nCombined with phrases like “we hear you” and “stress-free,” blue is working hard to give site visitors a sense of ease.\n\nSo if you are looking for the TRUST FACTOR \" BLUE HAS YOUR BACK \"\n\nIs Blue The Only Colour to make an impact ? Lets find out !\n\nRed: Red activates your pituitary gland, increasing your heart rate and causing you to breathe more rapidly. This visceral response makes red aggressive, energetic, provocative and attention-grabbing. Count on red to evoke a passionate response, albeit not always a favorable one. For example, red can represent danger or indebtedness.\n\nGreen: In general, green connotes health, freshness and serenity. However, green's meaning varies with its many shades. Deeper greens are associated with wealth or prestige, while light greens are calming.\n\nYellow: In every society, yellow is associated with the sun. Thus, it communicates optimism, positivism, light and warmth. Certain shades seem to motivate and stimulate creative thought and energy. The eye sees bright yellows before any other color, making them great for point-of-purchase displays.\n\nPurple: Purple is a color favored by creative types. With its blend of passionate red and tranquil blue, it evokes mystery, sophistication, spirituality and royalty. Lavender evokes nostalgia and sentimentality.\n\nPink: Pink's message varies by intensity. Hot pinks convey energy, youthfulness, fun and excitement and are recommended for less expensive or trendy products for women or girls. Dusty pinks appear sentimental. Lighter pinks are more romantic.\n\nOrange: Cheerful orange evokes exuberance, fun and vitality. With the drama of red plus the cheer of yellow, orange is viewed as gregarious and often childlike. Research indicates its lighter shades appeal to an upscale market. Peach tones work well with health care, restaurants and beauty salons.\n\nBrown: This earthy color conveys simplicity, durability and stability. It can also elicit a negative response from consumers who relate to it as dirty. Certain shades of brown, like terracotta, can convey an upscale look. From a functional perspective, brown tends to hide dirt, making it a logical choice for some trucking and industrial companies.\n\nBlack: Black is serious, bold, powerful and classic. It creates drama and connotes sophistication. Black works well for expensive products, but can also make a product look heavy.\n\nWhite: White connotes simplicity, cleanliness and purity. The human eye views white as a brilliant color, so it immediately catches the eye in signage. White is often used with infant and health-related products.\n\nAll the colors above can be categorized into two basic categories: warm and cold. In general, warm colors, like red and yellow, send an outgoing, energetic message, while cool colors, like blue, are calmer and more reserved. However, brightening a cool color increases its vibrancy and reduces its reserve.\n\nSo now you have to ask yourself the question are you ready to rebrand ?"
