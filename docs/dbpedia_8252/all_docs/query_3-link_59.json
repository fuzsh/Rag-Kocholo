        "text": "New partner program investments, AI innovation and cloud outages are among the biggest headlines so far.\n\nNew partner program investments. Innovation in the artificial intelligence portfolio. And cloud outages and concerns around security.\n\nThese are some of the ways Microsoft has captured headlines in 2024 so far as the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant rides high on its role as one of the biggest companies in the growing AI space.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella – named in July as CRN’s No. 1 Most Influential Executive of 2024 – and his team are investing in its 400,000-plus partner-strong ecosystem solution providers to not only help stand up AI technology within customer environments, but to also make customers more cyber resilient and to continue migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.\n\n[RELATED: 2024 Year In Review (So Far)]\n\nMicrosoft News 2024\n\nMicrosoft is a member of CRN’s 2024 Channel Chiefs.\n\nIn July, Microsoft executives revealed that the vendor brought in $245.1 billion in revenue, an increase of 15 percent year over year ignoring foreign exchange. Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $135 billion, up 23 percent year over year.\n\nFor the 2025 fiscal year, CFO Amy Hood said that she expects “double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering differentiated value for our customers.”\n\nHere are some of the ways Microsoft has dominated headlines this year so far.\n\nThis list is part of CRN’s 2024 Year In Review (So Far) series. Other lists include The 10 Biggest AWS News Stories Of 2024 (So Far) and The 10 Biggest Nvidia News Stories Of 2024 (So Far).\n\n10. January Microsoft Outages\n\nOutages are always a part of the cloud story, and Microsoft wasn’t spared from headline-grabbing issues at the start of the year.\n\nAzure Resource Manager experienced degradation on Jan. 21, with users contending with issues for about seven hours, from 1:30 UTC to 8:58, especially users in the Central U.S., East U.S., West Central U.S. and South Central U.S.\n\nThe ARM issue affected downstream Azure services including CDN, Virtual Machines, Data Factory, Azure Container Registry and Service Bus, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe issue came from a June 2020 ARM private preview integration with Entra Continuous Access Evaluation, according to Microsoft. “Unbeknownst to us, this preview feature of the ARM CAE implementation contained a latent code defect that caused issues when authentication to Entra failed,” according to the vendor. “The defect would cause ARM nodes to fail on startup whenever ARM could not authenticate to an Entra tenant enrolled in the preview.”\n\nA ThousandEyes report said that “the saving grace for Microsoft was that it occurred on a weekend, reducing the impact on users.”\n\n“However, the critical nature of ARM in Azure operations meant that the users who were impacted could do little but wait for a fix,” according to the report.\n\nOn Jan. 26, Microsoft Teams had a widespread outage. Microsoft posted on X at 8:45 a.m. Pacific that “we're investigating an issue impacting multiple Microsoft Teams features.”\n\n“We've identified a networking issue impacting a portion of the Teams service and we're performing a failover to remediate impact,” the vendor posted on X at 9:17 a.m.\n\nRealtime outages monitor Downdetector reported receiving about 14,500 reports of a Microsoft Teams outage by 10:41 a.m. It received about 600 reports of a Microsoft 365 outage by around that time.\n\nA ThousandEyes report on the incident said that it “observed these failures starting at approximately 4 PM (UTC) (8 AM [PST]), and they persisted for more than 7 hours before the incident appeared to resolve for many users by 11:10 PM (UTC).”\n\n9. Microsoft Hires Inflection’s CEO\n\nIn March, Microsoft hired multiple employees from startup Inflection AI – including the startup’s CEO and co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who became a Microsoft executive vice president and CEO of the newly formed Microsoft AI organization.\n\nThe startup’s $1.3 billion funding round last year included Microsoft and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Suleyman sold DeepMind to Google in 2014. He left Google in 2022 to co-found Inflection.\n\nThe hiring appeared to have ripple effects within Microsoft’s leadership, with the vendor promoting Pavan Davuluri to lead a combined Windows Experiences and Windows + Devices team while its head of Windows Experiences left his job – days after he was moved to a position reporting to new Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman.\n\nMikhail Parakhin, identified as Microsoft’s CEO of advertising and web services on his LinkedIn, “decided to explore new roles,” according to Microsoft. In a May post to social media network X, formerly known as Twitter, Parakhin said he joined the advisory board of AI answer engine provider Perplexity.\n\nClose partnerships between tech giants and smaller AI organizations have led to scrutiny in the U.S. and in Europe. In July, the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) published a letter saying that it can “begin an investigation” into the Microsoft-Inflection deal.\n\nIn January, the FTC announced that Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Anthropic needed to provide information on their recent investments and partnerships.\n\nGoogle appears to have done a similar Microsoft-Inflection deal with the startup Character.AI.\n\n8. Microsoft Executive Accounts Breach In January\n\nThe year started with good and bad news in Microsoft world – around increased access for Copilot for M365, Microsoft disclosed that a Russia-aligned threat actor was able to steal emails from members of its senior leadership team as well as from employees on its cybersecurity and legal teams.\n\nThe tech giant attributed the attack to a group it tracks as Midnight Blizzard, which has previously been connected to Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence unit by the U.S. government and blamed for attacks including the widely felt 2020 breach of SolarWinds.\n\nCustomers known to have been impacted in the incident included multiple federal agencies, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed. Through the compromise of Microsoft corporate email accounts, Midnight Blizzard has “exfiltrated email correspondence between Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies and Microsoft,” CISA said in an emergency directive.\n\nThe breach, which is believed to have begun in November 2023, saw hackers initially gain access by exploiting a lack of MFA (multifactor authentication) on a “legacy” account, Microsoft said.\n\nIn June, Microsoft confirmed that it had sent out more notices to customers impacted by the compromise, which were notified that their emails were viewed. “This is increased detail for customers who have already been notified and also includes new notifications,” the company said in a statement.\n\n7. U.S. Government Criticizes Microsoft Security Practices\n\nIn April, the U.S. Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) said the Microsoft cloud email breach that impacted multiple federal agencies in 2023 “was preventable and should never have occurred,” in a report.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security board said it determined that “Microsoft’s security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul”— an urgent issue “in light of the company’s centrality in the technology ecosystem and the level of trust customers place in the company to protect their data and operations.”\n\nThe Microsoft cloud email breach, first discovered in June 2023, saw the compromise of email accounts belonging to multiple U.S. government agencies. The attack is known to have impacted the emails of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other officials in the Commerce Department, as well as U.S. Rep. Don Bacon and U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns.\n\nIn May, Nadella sent a memo to employees that responded to a recent scathing federal report on the company’s security practices by urging staff to prioritize security over new feature releases when necessary.\n\n“If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security,” Nadella wrote in the memo, as posted by The Verge.\n\n“In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems,” he wrote in the memo. “This is key to advancing both our platform quality and capability such that we can protect the digital estates of our customers and build a safer world for all.”\n\nThe world is still dealing with the fallout of the widely felt July 19 outage of 8.5 million Windows devices caused by a faulty CrowdStrike update.\n\nAlthough much of the attention has focused on CrowdStrike and its update release process, Microsoft acknowledged that it must “prioritize change and innovation” for Windows following the massive CrowdStrike-caused outage to the operating system.\n\nThe outage, which began July 19 and had lingering impacts for much of the following week, saw 8.5 million Windows devices suffer the “blue screen of death” and become inoperable until they were fixed manually by an IT professional. The societal impacts were wide-ranging and estimates have suggested the costs to major corporations will reach into the billions of dollars.\n\nIn a blog post, Microsoft executive John Cable wrote that the outage “shows clearly that Windows must prioritize change and innovation in the area of end-to-end resilience.”\n\n“These improvements must go hand in hand with ongoing improvements in security and be in close cooperation with our many partners, who also care deeply about the security of the Windows ecosystem,” wrote Cable, vice president of Windows servicing and delivery at Microsoft.\n\nNotably, Cable also touched on the role of third-party access to the Windows kernel, which is seen as having been a key factor behind the incident. CrowdStrike’s ability to impact the Windows kernel through its defective update has been said to have enabled the outage to occur.\n\nIn the blog post, Cable pointed to recently announced capabilities that “provide an isolated compute environment that does not require kernel mode drivers to be tamper resistant.” He also mentioned Microsoft’s Azure Attestation service.\n\n5. The Copilot+ PC Recall Recall\n\nThe May unveiling of Copilot+ PCs became mired in controversy as industry watchers dug into the “recall” search feature.\n\nIn June, Microsoft said it would delay recall’s public release to improve Recall’s privacy and security safeguards in response to customer feedback.\n\nSecurity and privacy experts have voiced concerns about recall periodically taking a screenshot of a user’s screen to build an explorable visual timeline of nearly every action they make.\n\nWhen Microsoft revealed the feature last month, it said the recall won’t hide any sensitive or confidential information captured in the screenshots unless a user filters out specific applications or websites or browses privately on supported browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Opera and Google Chrome. It was also confirmed at the time that Microsoft would keep recall on by default for Copilot+ PCs.\n\nThe decision was announced days after Apple revealed Apple Intelligence as its much-anticipated suite of AI features for iPhones, Macs and iPads in a move meant, in part, to challenge the rise of AI PCs in the Windows ecosystem. Microsoft’s rival said Apple Intelligence would set a “brand-new standard for privacy in AI.”\n\n4. Microsoft Budges On NCE License Transfers\n\nIn April Microsoft confirmed that it is changing one of the most controversial parts of its already controversial New Commerce Experience program: The tech giant will allow partners in its Cloud Solution Provider program to transfer end customer NCE subscriptions from one partner to another midterm.\n\nThe change applies to direct bill and indirect providers, according to documents shared with CRN and confirmed by a Microsoft spokesperson. The NCE cancellation policy of seven days still applies after the transfer and the changes only apply to CSP license and seat-based subscriptions.\n\nNCE garnered controversy when the Redmond, Wash.-based vendor began enforcing it in March 2022, putting a premium on month-to-month commitments of popular Microsoft offerings.\n\nMicrosoft partners have told CRN that some customers prefer to make annual commitments, which are 20 percent less expensive than month-to-month commitments. This, however, could leave partners paying out the remainder of the commitment should the customer go out of business, get acquired or no longer need the subscription.\n\nThe inability to transfer subscriptions from one partner to another meant that if a Microsoft MSP won a new customer from an old MSP it might have to work out a deal with the old MSP to take the customer, even forgoing months of revenue until the subscriptions end.\n\nOther solution providers have spoken positively on the lack of transfers, fearing that the ability to easily transfer licenses will incentivize solution providers to compete on price in a race to the bottom.\n\n3. New Fiscal Year, New Partner Incentives\n\nJuly marked the start of Microsoft’s 2025 fiscal year, and in a new event aimed at partners, the vendor revealed plans for more than $150 million in pre-sales and post-sales investments for its Azure Innovate offering, an incremental $90 million “to accelerate security growth” with partners and a tenfold increase to its Copilot partner investment.\n\n“Microsoft achieves reach, scale and success because of you,” Nicole Dezen, Microsoft chief partner officer and corporate vice president of the Global Partner Solutions (GPS) organization, told partners during the digital MCAPS Start for Partners event – named for the internal Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions group and held this year instead of the annual partner-focused Microsoft Inspire event.\n\nAlong with the $150 million for Azure Innovate, Microsoft said that it will increase by 50 percent this fiscal year its investments for the Azure Migrate and Modernize offering. More than 12,000 projects have been delivered through the two offerings.\n\nMicrosoft also revealed that it will increase incentives for Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners in areas including Microsoft 365 E3, E5 and Business Premium packages. Under the new investments, CSP partners can earn up to $120,000 for M365 E3 workloads per customer, according to the vendor.\n\nAs for the $90 million in incremental security investments, Microsoft said that it will continue threat protection assessments and bring back data security assessments.\n\nMicrosoft plans to add and update more than 20 new product licenses for Microsoft Copilot, Defender for Endpoint, GitHub and more into multiple benefits packages in the coming months, according to the vendor.\n\nThe vendor will hold 12 more in-person AI Partner Training Days this year. In a show of partner engagement with these training programs, Microsoft revealed that it has trained more than 818,000 people on Azure, Copilot and Fabric since launching AI workshops and boot camps in 2023.\n\n2. Microsoft Copilot+ PC\n\nJust ahead of Microsoft’s annual Build developer-focused conference in May, the vendor unveiled Copilot+ PCs, billed as “the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built.”\n\nThe PCs hit the market in June, bringing more AI processing to the device level as partners and their customers assess the value of new AI technologies and presenting a massive partner opportunity as Windows 10 end of support spurs customers into looking at buying new devices.\n\nCopilot+ PCs are available from Microsoft Surface, Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, according to the vendor.\n\nThe PCs are equipped with Qualcomm Snapdragon X Series Processors, which have neural processing units (NPUs) capable of 45 trillion operations per second (TOPS).\n\nPrices range from $999 estimated retail price (ERP) to upwards of $2,499.99 ERP.\n\nOn the July earnings call, Nadella was scarce on Copilot+ PC news but did tell listeners that “we are delighted by early reviews, and we are looking forward to the introduction of more Copilot+ PCs powered by all of our silicon and OEM partners in the coming months.”\n\nWindows 11 active device sales increased 50 percent year over year, Nadella said.\n\n1. Expanded Copilot Access In January\n\nAlthough Copilot for Microsoft 365 became generally available (GA) for enterprises in November, solution providers in the vendor’s Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program had to wait until January to sell Microsoft’s main AI assistant.\n\nAlthough at the time multiple solution providers voiced frustration at the wait, Copilot has gone on to become a fixture of customer conversations for many Microsoft partners. And for customers not yet ready to adopt the technology, their partners have told CRN about plenty of work around preparing customer data and customer processes for Copilot use in the future.\n\nOn Microsoft’s quarterly earnings call in July, CEO Satya Nadella described the Copilot software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering as “on a growth rate that's faster than any other previous generation of software we launched as a suite in M365.”\n\nThe number of Copilot customers increased more than 60 percent quarter over quarter, the CEO said. The number of Copilot customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter over quarter. The number of people who use Copilot for Microsoft 365 daily at work nearly doubled quarter over quarter and a majority of enterprise customers returned to purchase more Copilot for Microsoft 365 seats.\n\n“That to me is a healthy SaaS core business,” Nadella said."
