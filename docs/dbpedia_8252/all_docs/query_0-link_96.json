        "text": "Kid-Friendly Polish, Christmas Nails Idea, plus a Piggy Paint Prize Pack Giveaway!\n\nThis shop has been compensated by Collective Bias, Inc. and its advertiser. All opinions are mine alone. #PamperedPiggies #CollectiveBias\n\nMy girls love when I paint their nails, so the other night I gave them a festive Christmas touch with non-toxic, odorless Piggy Paint!\n\nAren‚Äôt they cute? My daughter was pretty excited about them and couldn‚Äôt wait to show them off to her friends and teacher at school.\n\nI admit, I don‚Äôt paint my sweet girls‚Äô nails as often as I should, but when I do, we go all out! While I painted, we had a blast talking about this wonderful season and our family‚Äôs holiday activity plans in the coming weeks.\n\nI just love colorful nail polish for little girls. My girls are fans of pink, can you tell? üôÇ\n\nSo many times when we paint, I have to open the door to the room and start the fan to circulate air because of the heavy fumes and odors, but not this time! I picked up some kid-friendly, non-toxic, odorless Piggy Paint at Walmart and we kept the door shut without being bothered by the funky smell, because there wasn‚Äôt one.\n\nI whipped up a fun washi tape-decorated jar to hold our new treasures, layered some cotton balls on the bottom, followed by our cute (and I might add, eco-friendly) Piggy Paints, a file and remover. We were set!\n\nMy two-year-old couldn‚Äôt keep her hands off the fun polishes, so I painted her nails first to appease her anticipation.\n\nShe gets a kick out of getting her nails painted, but she‚Äôs only two, and that means lots of wiggles, so mommy had to work fast! It was a good thing the polish dried really quickly, or we may have been in trouble. üôÇ I started off with a simple coat of pink.\n\nAnd then I let her choose a color from the stash to make polka dots.\n\nBlue was a perfect compliment! After I finished, she gave me a huge hug of gratitude for the pretty paint job and then ran off to play. So sweet. üôÇ\n\nNext, my older daughter sat down for a paint job. We started with a coat of green on every other finger.\n\nThen I painted a gorgeous vivid pink color on the in-between fingers for an alternating effect.\n\nNext, I grabbed a toothpick, snipped off the sharp end, dipped the point in pink polish, and ‚Äúdrew‚Äù on a candy cane shape. I did this to a nail on her other hand as well.\n\nThen, after it had dried, I drew a few blue stripes on with the sharp end of a toothpick that I‚Äôd dipped in the polish. Easy peasy!\n\nNext, I made a present shape by drawing the outline of a square with purple polish and a toothpick, then filling it in.\n\nI let it dry completely before adding the bow on top and ribbon stripes on the sides.\n\nNext, I drew on a Christmas tree using the same method-drawing the outline with a toothpick, then filling it in with little dabs of polish on the toothpick.\n\nI made a few more Christmas designs the same way and we were done! We had such a fun girl‚Äôs night in together painting nails and chatting. I‚Äôm no expert nail painter, but we absolutely adored the final results and now our nails are looking their best for upcoming holiday photos and parties!\n\nRight now through December 23rd, you can receive 15% off your online purchase at Piggy Paint with code ‚Äúpiggypaint‚Äù. These would make great gifts and stocking stuffers!\n\nAnd guess what?
