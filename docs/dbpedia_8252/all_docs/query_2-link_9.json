        "text": "Colors beautifully demonstrate how speakers of different languages often see the world through different lenses. Did you know that other languages donât always differentiate colors in the same way that English does?\n\nIn some languages, gray, black and blue are regarded as the same color - so thereâs only one word for them, while in other languages, light blue and dark blue are seen as two distinguished colors. Yet other languages have an entirely different organizing system, for example, mapping brown, red, and green as one.\n\nGetting to know the colors is an interesting and fun part of language learning. When learning and speaking German, it will make your conversations more vivid, more graphic and just more colorful, as adding colors to the things you say is like painting pictures while you speak. So weâve collected all the colors of the rainbow for you, plus some extra pretty shades in between.\n\nDownload our free paper chatterbox to help you learn German colors in no time!\n\nTable of contents\n\nWhy learn all the colors in German?\n\nColors in German\n\nPurple in German\n\nOrange in German\n\nBlue in German\n\nRed in German\n\nYellow in German\n\nBrown in German\n\nPink in German\n\nGreen in German\n\nBlack in German\n\nWhite in German\n\nFree downloadable paper chatterbox\n\nSongs about colors in German\n\nGerman colors FAQs\n\nTips for learning German colors\n\nWhy learn all the colors in German?\n\nMake precise descriptions\n\nBeing precise is imperative to communicating effectively and colors are often the most obvious attributes. So there is no better way of describing things. When youâre telling someone you lost an umbrella, itâs a broad statement.\n\nIf youâre telling someone âI lost my purple umbrellaâ (Ich habe meinen lila Regenschirm verloren), it immediately evokes a clear picture for them, and they will be able to help you find it.\n\nPoint without pointing\n\nWhen youâre trying to point out a single person in a group, you will often say something like âthe girl in the green romperâ or âthe one with the turquoise tie,â and the other person will know exactly who youâre talking about.\n\nKnowing the colors in German will come in handy when youâre trying to point something out without pointing fingers.\n\nTell better stories\n\nColors are key to vivid storytelling. You donât have to write a book to benefit from improving your storytelling skills. Good storytelling is great, even just for telling your friends what you did on the weekend or telling a funny little joke - and colors bring every story to life.\n\nTheyâre the most simple and effective storytelling device. So adding in some color is an easy hack to seem like a pro when conversing in German!\n\nColors in German\n\nColors in German is âFarbenâ [ËfaÊbmÌ©], and many of them are very close to the English ones. âRedâ is ârotâ, âblueâ is âblauâ, âorangeâ is âorangeâ. Others are different, like âschwarzâ (black), âgelbâ (yellow) or âlilaâ (purple), and youâll just have to learn those as new vocabularies.\n\nFor all the specific shades of different colors, German borrows names from similar things as English does, like fruits, flowers, the sea, and the sky - and all the other colorful things we find in nature.\n\nWeâve collected them all for you, from purple over orange, blue, red, yellow, brown, pink, and green to black and white.\n\nPurple in German\n\nPurple in German is âlilaâ [ËliËla]. The color might make you think of lavender fields or fresh fruit. Here is a whole bowl full of purple colors and fruits like plums and berries:\n\nEnglish Shades of purple in German German pronunciation Lavender Lavendel [laËvÉndlÌ©] Purple Lila [ËliËla] Violet Violett [viÌ¯oËlÉt] Grape Traube [ËtÊaÊÌ¯bÉ] Mauve Malve [ËmalvÉ] Mulberry Maulbeere [ËmaÊÌ¯lËbeËÊÉ] Plum Pflaume [ËpÍ¡flaÊÌ¯mÉ] Lilac Flieder [ËfliËdÉ] Indigo Indigo [ËÉªndiÉ¡o]\n\nOrange in German\n\nOrange in German is âorangeâ [oËÊÉÌËÊ]. Like in English, itâs the same for the fruit and the color. Tangerines are very popular fruits in Germany during the winter months as thatâs their peak season there and bronze might make you think of German Weihnachtsschmuck (Christmas decoration) - so itâs a pretty wintry category.\n\nEnglish Shades of orange in German German pronunciation Tangerine Klementine [klemÉnËtiËnÉ] Orange Orange [oËÊÉÌËÊÉ] Amber Bernstein [ËbÉÊnËÊtaÉªÌ¯n] Bronze Bronze [ËbÊÉÌËsÉ]; Burnt Orange Dunkelorange [ËdÊÅklÌ©oËÊÉÌËÊÉ] Marmalade Orangerot [oËÊÉÌËÊÉÊoËt] Mango Mango [ËmaÅÉ¡o] Rust Rostrot [ËÊÉstËÊoËt] Papaya Papaya [paËpaËja]\n\nBlue in German\n\nGermany actually has some beautiful beaches! The water here may not always have the cyan or turquoise colors it does on tropical islands, but theyâre charming, too: from babyblau (baby blue) to kÃ¶nigsblau (royal blue). Blue in German is âblauâ [blaÊÌ¯] and there are many variations of it:\n\nEnglish Shades of blue in German German pronunciation Royal Blue KÃ¶nigsblau [ËkÃ¸ËnÉªksËblaÊÌ¯] Blue Blau [blaÊÌ¯] Turquoise TÃ¼rkis [tÊÊËkiËs] Teal Petrol [pe.tÊoËl] Cyan Cyan [siÉÌn] Sky Blue Himmelblau [ËhÉªmlÌ©blaÊÌ¯] Navy Blue Marineblau [maËÊiËnÉblaÊÌ¯] Baby Blue Babyblau [ËbeËbiËblaÊÌ¯] Midnight Blue Mitternachtsblau [ËmÉªtÉËnaxtsblaÊÌ¯]\n\nRed in German\n\nAcross the board, red is a warning color - the color of blood, poisonous animals and the traffic lights you donât want to miss. Red in German is ârotâ [ÊoËt]. Remember it well. Itâs kind of an important one.\n\nEnglish Shades of red in German German pronunciation Burgundy Burgunderrot [bÊÊËÉ¡ÊndÉÊoËt] Red Rot [ÊoËt] Cherry Kirsche [ËkÉªÊÊÉ] Crimson Purpurrot [ËpÊÊpÊÊËÊoËt] Brick Red Ziegelrot [ËtÍ¡siËÉ¡lÌ©ÊoËt] Blood Red Blutrot [ËbluËtËÊoËt] Maroon Kastanienrot [kasËtaËniÌ¯ÉnÊoËt] Berry Beere [ËbeËÊÉ] Scarlet Scharlachrot [ËÊaÊlaxËÊoËt]\n\nYellow in German\n\nLemons, bees and sandy beaches - definitely a summer color! Yellow in German is âgelbâ [É¡Élp], and itâs as sunny as a pocketful of sunshine:\n\nEnglish Shades of yellow in German German pronunciation Lemon Zitronengelb [tÍ¡siËtÊoËnÉnËÉ¡Élp] Yellow Gelb [É¡Élp] Cream Creme [kÊeËm] Canary Kanariengelb [kaËnaËÊiÉnËÉ¡Élp] Chartreuse HellgrÃ¼n [ËhÉlÉ¡ÊyËn] Gold Gold [É¡Élt] Light Yellow Hellgelb [ËhÉlÉ¡Élp] Sand Sand [zant] Mustard Senf [zÉÉ±f]\n\nBrown in German\n\nHereâs an earthy color that might make you think of coffee or nuts: Brown in German is âbraunâ [bÊaÊÌ¯n], and it can be as delicious as German caramel candies.\n\nEnglish Shades of brown in German German pronunciation Caramel Karamell [kaÊaËmÉl] Brown Braun [bÊaÊÌ¯n] Sepia Sepia [ËzeËpiÌ¯a] Chestnut Kastanie [kasËtaËniÌ¯É] Chocolate Schokolade [ÊokoËlaËdÉ] Almond Mandel [ËmandlÌ©] Cedar Zeder [ËtÍ¡seËdÉ] Coffee Kaffee [kaËfeË] Walnut Walnuss [ËvaËlËnÊs]\n\nPink in German\n\nThe interesting thing about âpinkâ is that the word is used in German, too, but it describes what English-speakers might call âhot pinkâ or âshocking pink.â The regular pink in German is ârosaâ [ËÊoËza].\n\nEnglish Shades of pink in German German pronunciation Peach Pfirsich [ËpÍ¡fÉªÊzÉªÃ§] Pink Rosa [ËÊoËza] Coral Koralle [koËÊalÉ] Rouge Rouge [ÊuËÊ] Magenta Magenta [maËÉ¡Énta] Salmon Lachs [laks] Blush RosÃ© [ÊoËzeË] Hot Pink Pink [pÉªÅk] Strawberry Erdbeer [ËeËÉÌ¯tËbeËÊÉn]\n\nGreen in German\n\nGermany is a very green country. It has a political party dedicated to green matters such as environmentalism and stopping climate change, which actually has the third-largest parliamentary group in the German Bundestag! Green in German is âgrÃ¼nâ [É¡ÊyËn] and the party is simply known as âDie GrÃ¼nenâ (the green ones).\n\nEnglish Shades of green in German German pronunciation Sage Salbei [ËzalbaÉªÌ¯] Green GrÃ¼n [É¡ÊyËn] Jade Jade [ËjaËdÉ] Seafoam Meeresschaum [ËmeËÊÉs,ÊaÊÌ¯m] Lime Limette [liËmÉtÉ] Forest WaldgrÃ¼n [valt,É¡ÊyËn] Olive Olive [oËliËvÉ] Emerald Smaragd [smaËÊakt] Mint MintgrÃ¼n [mÉªntÉ¡ÊyËn]\n\nBlack in German\n\nBlack in German is âschwarzâ [ÊvaÊtÍ¡s]. It can describe pitch-black things like tar and ink but sometimes the lines between black and blue also blurr, as they do with âcool blackâ, which would be described as ânachtblauâ (nightblue) in German.\n\nEnglish Shades of black in German Pronunciation Ebony Ebenholz [ËeËbnÌ©ËhÉltÍ¡s] Black Schwarz [ÊvaÊtÍ¡s] Cool Black Nachtblau [naxt,blaÊÌ¯] Ink Tintenschwarz [ËtÉªntnÌ©, ÊvaÊtÍ¡s] Obsidian Obsidian [ÉpzÌ¥idiËaËn] Jet Black Kohlrabenschwarz [ËkoËlËÊaËbnÌ©ËÊvaÊtÍ¡s] Charcoal Kohle [ËkoËlÉ] Onyx Onyx [ËoËnÊks] Midnight Mitternacht [ËmÉªtÉËnaxt]\n\nWhite in German\n\nGermany is known for its bureaucracy, so after black, lastly, we also need to mention that white in German is âweiÃâ [vaÉªÌ¯s] and Germans sometimes tend to want things âschwarz auf weiÃâ (black on white) - or nicely written down on a piece of paper, so to speak.\n\nEnglish Shades of white in German Pronunciation Beige Beige [beËÊ] White WeiÃ [vaÉªÌ¯s] Ivory Elfenbein [ËÉlfnÌ©ËbaÉªÌ¯n] Eggshell Eierschalen [ËaÉªÌ¯ÉËÊaËlÉn] Coconut Kokosnuss [ËkoËkÉsËnÊs] Pearl PerlweiÃ [ËpÉÊlËvaÉªÌ¯s] Bone Knochen [ËknÉxnÌ©] Alabaster Alabaster [alaËbastÉ] Off white WeiÃgrau [vaÉªÌ¯s,É¡ÊaÊÌ¯]\n\nFree downloadable paper chatterbox\n\nThis fun paper chatterbox will help you learn German colors in no time!

Which one is your favorite? Green as grass or pink as a piggy?\n\nGrÃ¼n, grÃ¼n, grÃ¼n sind alle meine Kleider - Kinderlieder zum Mitsingen | Sing Kinderlieder\n\nThis one is a classic: The lyrics go âblue, blue, blue are all my clothes, blue blue blue is everything I have. I love everything thatâs blue because my baby is a sailorâ and follows this pattern with a number of colors.\n\nSo if youâre dating a chimney sweeper, be prepared to only wear black from now on. Might not make too much sense but itâs how a lot of German kids learn about the colors.\n\nKLAN - Rot Blau GrÃ¼n (Official Video)\n\nThe duo Klan consists of two brothers from Saxony. In their song âRot Blau GrÃ¼nâ (Red Blue Green), they sing about the heartache of a breakup and the fear of moving on and having to live as your own separate person, a whole falling back into its parts, like atoms or like colors that have been mixed and then separated again.\n\nGerman colors FAQs\n\nHow do you say colorful in German?\n\nThere are a number of words for âcolorfulâ in German, the most common one being âbuntâ. You can also say âkunterbuntâ, âfarbenfreudigâ, âfarbenfrohâ or âfarbenprÃ¤chtigâ, all of them meaning something has many different colors, or if the colors are really shrill, you can also say âquietschbuntâ, which means something is so colorful, it squeaks!\n\nHow do you use colors in a German sentence?\n\nColors are adjectives. So when they are used to describe a noun, they usually go right before the noun and they need the correct ending to go with that noun (blaues Haus). They can also be nominalized by adding an article to the color (das Blau) and stand alone that way.\n\nWhat do the colors of the German flag mean?\n\nThe colors of the German flag were used during the wars of liberation against Napoleon when soldiers first wore them on their uniforms. They symbolized the blackness of bondage, from which the golden light of freedom was to be achieved through blood-red battles: from black over red to gold.\n\nTips for learning German colors\n\nUse colorful memory aids\n\nColors are so memorable that itâs easy to make up little stories around them. If youâre trying to remember the word for Colors in German, itâs âFarbenâ [ËfaÊbmÌ©], just like when something is far away, plus the name Ben.\n\nSo if you need a memory aid to remember the word, just picture someone called Ben, who is far from you, somewhere on the other side of the street, for example, but you can easily spot him because heâs wearing such a colorful jacket. Youâll think of the colors, and youâll remember Far-Ben. You can try this with all the colors. Stories with colors tend to stick in our heads.\n\nUse reference points\n\nIn Korean for example, there is only one word for blue and green, but Koreans use the sky and the leaves as reference points, so a Korean speaker will say the color and then add âlike the skyâ or â like the leavesâ to distinguish between those shades. The same works if youâre missing the German word for a precise color - You can just use the general color and then add an attribute of your choice for specification.\n\nMake up your own colors\n\nIf youâre not sure how to say a color in German, you can always make up your own! Just come up with something resembling the color that you do know the word for and name the color after it, like an animal.\n\nOnce youâve mastered the animals in German, youâll have a wide range of vocabulary to choose from when naming a color. Just find an animal and add a â-farbigâ (-colored) to the word: âSchweinfarbigâ (pig-colored) could be pink. âPinguinfarbigâ (penguin-colored) could be black and white. Get creative.\n\nLearning in color\n\nGerman has multiple words for âcolorfulâ, the most common one being âbuntâ, but another one is âfarbenfrohâ, which literally translates as âcolorhappyâ. Itâs happy with color, which is a beautiful expression because it entails the notion that adding color to something - a piece of art or a flower bed, adds happiness to it - and thereâs definitely some truth to that.\n\nSo add some color to your language learning journey, and it will be a much happier one. There are a thousand shades of âbuntâ to enrich your German!"
