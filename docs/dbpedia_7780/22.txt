Established in 1899, The Hackley School stands as a distinguished private college preparatory institution.

Existing Conditions was chosen to laser scan the main building of the esteemed institution's campus, encompassing 85,000 square feet, and to provide a BIM model including over 100 interior elevations.

Existing Conditions collaborates closely with all clients, and although it is not formal, we see each project as a partnership, as we are both stakeholders in the success.
