        "text": "Biography\n\nIt was built on land donated by Julius Hackley, and was thought to be more than a hundred years old in 1958. It was originally closer to the road, but moved in 1903. In September 1904, the board voted to purchase and install a school bell. Hackley School was no longer listed in the Kalamazoo County school directories after 1956. Students may have transferred to the new Alamo Valley School, or Hackley may have been absorbed into the Otsego School District, to which it would have been annexed about that time. In 1968 it was being used for a rooming house, but appeared to be a private home in a 1981 photograph.\n\nAlthough it is not reflected in the records we have available, the school apparently maintained a small library. In 1880 the school board for Williams School voted to exchange libraries with Hackley School, an inexpensive way to provide new resources for both districts.\n\nFor images of the school, see the Kalamazoo Public Library webpage.\n\nFound in 1 Collection or Record:"
