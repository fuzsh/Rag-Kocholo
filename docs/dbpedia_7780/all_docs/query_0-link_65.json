        "text": "ASK Jason Hochfelder how he came to hit .419 and lead the county in runs batted in while helping the Hackley School to its first-ever independent schools state baseball championship this season and he'll mention ''playing baseball for as long as I can remember.''\n\nHe'll tell you how his father, John, got him started and was his first Little League coach, how the people at The Baseball Factory Inc. played a role and how Coach Steve Frolo and his teammates at Hackley in Tarrytown encouraged him.\n\nAnd he'll tell you about being a camp counselor for some special children this past summer.\n\n''About two and a half years ago I got involved with the Special Olympics,'' Jason said. ''Every month or so they would have indoor games or qualifying games for their track program and I'd help out, time some of the events and maybe talk to the athletes. But it was only once a month and I asked if I could help a little better.''\n\nHe was referred to North East Westchester Special Recreation, where he worked as a volunteer with challenged youngsters in basketball and swimming and as a lifeguard. Then last summer he was a counselor in the organization's camp.\n\n''Jason had a lot of enthusiasm and the kids really liked him,'' Donna Asher, the camp director, said.\n\nIt helped Jason, he said, more than it helped the children.\n\n''Working there was an awakening,'' he said. ''Every day I can do what I want, and in most any sport. These kids aren't able to do that. While helping them, I felt a big obligation to better myself, to get the most of my abilities.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
