        "text": "Located on a 285 acre woodland campus in Tarrytown, NY, Hackley School is a K-12 coeducational day and five-day boarding school. Visitors are drawn to the beauty of Hackley`s historic Quad, yet the School`s facilities libraries, technology classrooms (including Maker Space) athletics fields, cross-country trails, recently updated Lower School, the 115,000 square foor Johnson Center for Health and Wellness and our newly opened center for Creative Technology and Arts on our gracefully designed campus rival those of nationally known boarding schools. Here, we challenge students to grow in character, scholarship and accomplishment in a community that encourages all to \"Enter Here to Be and Find a Friend.\""
