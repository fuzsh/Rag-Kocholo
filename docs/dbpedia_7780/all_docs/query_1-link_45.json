Can someone name the private schools with the best reputations in the Larchmont/Bronxville areas please? Thank you in advance!!\n\nBest for what? And for what age? Many of the public schools in Westchester are \"better\" than the private schools in many parts of the country unless you're trying seek to insulate your kids from something.\n\nLast edited by kletter1mann; 11-07-2014 at 07:25 PM.. Reason: detail\n\nMy general sense in Larchmont/Mamaroneck is that the people who chose private schools either want French language education so they send their kids to the French American School of NY, or they want catholic school so they send them to St. John and Paul school in Larchmont. If you want single sex education, Iona prep and Ursuline are both next door in New Rochelle (catholic boys and girls schools respectively).\n\nBronxville also has a catholic school in town - St. Joseph school. I would hazard a guess that the majority of the kids come from Fleetwood (located in Mount Vernon school district) or in the Bronxville PO part of town, which isn't part of the Bronxville School district. Fordham prep in the Bronx also seems to get a lot of boys from that area - I used to take the train during school commute and you'd always see a ton of kids getting off at Bronxville.\n\nI'm sure that the more exclusive non-parochial prep schools nearby like Riverdale and Horace Mann also get more than a smattering of kids from Bronxville and Larchmont.\n\nIf you are talking private and not parochial, then there just aren't that many to talk about. The public schools in Westchester are generally some of the best in the country (see the post about the latest ranking for some more info). The private schools in lower Westchester are Rye Country Day (PK-12), and Hackley (in Tarrytown, K-12). You have a few other options for upper grades and/or in northern Westchester (The Masters School, The Harvey School, Rippowam Cisqua) and depending on your background or desires, there is the French American School (FASNY) in Larchmont/Mamaroneck, and the German International School in White Plains.\n\nThe Bronxville school district is one of the best in the country, and the Mamaroneck school district (which encompasses Larchmont as well) is extremely good as well but larger with more diversity. There is no real reason to move to a fabulous school district just to send your kids to private school, unless you have A LOT of money and simply don't care about the cost.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by streetsmart\n\nIf you are talking private and not parochial, then there just aren't that many to talk about.

There is no real reason to move to a fabulous school district just to send your kids to private school, unless you have A LOT of money and simply don't care about the cost.\n\nTo amplify on this - without context the private school question really doesn't have much meaning. The academic difference between the parochial schools and Riverdale or Hackley is vast. People sending kids to private schools generally have some reason for doing so, and it usually isn't the quality of public schools. These reasons typically include...\n\nmoney-is-no-object social positioning (Hackley, \"Hill Schools\" in Riverdale, maybe Rye Country Day).\n\nWant to keep my kids protected from hoi polloi or sex and drugs but can't afford the above or kids can't get into the above (all the parochial schools, but this is an illusion)\n\nkids are special snowflakes or so brilliantly creative that they can't tolerate the stifling conformity of a normal school environment (or parents think they are and buy in to all the exceptionalism stuff - Harvey, Thornton-Donovan, many others).\n\nIt's therefore a tough isssue to just skate by the question of \"whatever their reasoning may be.\" Comments in the absence of that reasoning aren't worth much. Otherwise just search the web.\n\nLast edited by kletter1mann; 11-08-2014 at 07:34 PM.. Reason: added examples"
