        "text": "Hackley has incredible athletic facilities and an expansive campus. In terms of comfort and resources, it is definitely strong. However, the workload, especially in English, is high and many students are very tired or stressed and may experience burnout when they reach college. Especially if a kid wants science/business, their humanities can be overwhelming. Many kids in the colleges they go to from regular good public schools may have more energy and still the same preparation and do well in careers when it matters. The school has great facilities if one wanted to focus on a sport or explore nature, but seemed to have no boost for college admissions even though the workload is so high. May not be worth it as the actual sports teams are average and clubs/ECs options are weak. Westchester has great public schools, while with a bigger class size, have great college placements and a more well balanced social and academic life given Hackley kids come from all over the area. My perspective."
