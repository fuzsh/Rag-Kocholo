        "text": "Walter C. Johnson Center for Health & Wellness is a 115,000-sq-ft, two-story addition to the Hackley School’s educational complex in Tarrytown, NY. The LEED Gold Certified supplement was developed as an athletic facility and student center for the K-12, Day and Boarding School campus.\n\nPositioned on the side of a forested mountain of rock, directly over a New York City aqueduct, the site’s beautiful campus topography proved to pose a significant access challenge. Project goals centered on seamlessly incorporating the new construction into the site’s natural landscape while saving as many existing boulders and trees as possible. However, due to the complex topography, the foundation had to be carved out and the crushed rock was used for fill material.\n\nMcLaren provided civil engineering services included site plan approval and civil design of the sites amenities, roadways, parking, and stormwater management."
