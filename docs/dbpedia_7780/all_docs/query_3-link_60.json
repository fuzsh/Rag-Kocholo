        "text": "Hackley School Hackley School, situated in Tarrytown, New York, is a prestigious private college preparatory institution and holds membership in the Ivy Preparatory School League. Initially established in 1899 by the notable philanthropist Frances Hackley, the school's original aim was to offer an alternative to Episcopal boarding schools through a Unitarian perspective. Over time, Hackley School has evolved, shedding its Unitarian affiliations and transitioning from an all-boys' school to a coeducational one.\n\nFor over a century and two decades, Hackley School has been instilling in students the mission to venture forth and spread beauty and illumination. Founded by Frances Hackley, a prominent philanthropist of her era, the school has flourished into an independent institution catering to around 850 students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Its picturesque 285-acre campus provides an ideal setting for academic pursuits.\n\nWhile Hackley School has embraced innovation through new facilities and programs, its core essence remains rooted in its people, relationships, and sense of community. At Hackley, the emphasis is placed on the significance of one's character, surpassing individual accomplishments. Character being esteemed higher than intellect is one of the school's core values.\n\nThe Hackley School campus, often referred to as the Hilltop, has been a nurturing environment for countless generations, fostering both academic and personal growth. The inscription \"Enter here to be and find a friend\" adorns the entrance of the main building, symbolizing the school's welcoming ethos. Prospective visitors are encouraged to witness the campus in action, observing dedicated educators collaborating with eager students within an atmosphere that venerates academic exploration and scholarship.\n\nPrograms in Hackley School Welcome to the Kathleen Allen Lower School at Hackley, where the guiding motto \"United, we help one another\" is a lived reality, underpinning the continuous growth of its young learners. The Lower School, nestled within Hackley School's educational landscape, houses a vibrant community of around 200 students ranging from Kindergarten through Fourth grade. Here, the emphasis on collaboration and compassion is interwoven with academic rigor, fostering an environment that promotes shared learning.\n\nAs one delves into the Kathleen Allen Lower School at Hackley School, an inviting atmosphere unfolds, fostering collaboration and kindness as essential companions to academic pursuits. Mutual appreciation and a spirit of cooperation are woven into the fabric of every subject we teach, cultivating a well-rounded educational experience.\n\nHackley School extends its commitment to educational excellence through the Lower School Associate Teacher Program (Grades 1-4). This initiative serves as a platform for aspiring educators to learn from seasoned mentors while honing their own professional skills. Designed as a four-year journey, the program prepares participants to assume leadership roles in both private and public school settings.\n\nAugmenting Hackley Schoolâ€™s robust professional development offerings, associate teachers engage in dynamic interactions and real-world scenarios during monthly cohort meetings. These gatherings facilitate a deep dive into best practices and pertinent education-related topics, enriching the associates' classroom effectiveness.\n\nThroughout their tenure, associate teachers are entrusted with delivering an array of social studies, math, and literacy lessons across multiple grade levels. Collaboratively, the Lower School Lead Teachers, Directors of the Associate Teacher program, and the Lower School Director guide and mentor associates in curriculum development and implementation. Associates also enjoy opportunities to further integrate within the K-12 faculty and student body through school-wide collaborative projects, after-school activities, and coaching roles.\n\nKindergarten and Grade 2 serve as the designated entry points for students entering Hackley's Lower School. Each year, 32 new students are admitted to Kindergarten, forming two classes of 16 students each. In Grade 2, Hackley introduces a third class, accommodating an additional 16 new students, thus fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment from the earliest years of schooling.\n\nIn the Middle School of Hackley, the vibrancy, dynamism, and inquisitiveness that characterize early adolescence are palpable. Amidst shared laughter, students support each other in maintaining balance, collaborate on composing musical scores, and dash to the gym for sports activities, transforming Akin Common into a flurry of activity. This spirited atmosphere thrives due to a faculty deeply attuned to the developmental needs of Hackley School's Middle Schoolers, a curriculum that ignites intellectual curiosity, and a steadfast dedication to the motto etched on the main doorway: \"Enter Here to Be and Find a Friend.\"\n\nSpanning ages from around ten to fourteen, Middle School students enter as fifth graders and exit as burgeoning young adults. Over these transformative four years, Hackley School nurtures both academic excellence and the nurturing of character in every student.\n\nThe Middle School faculty at Hackley School is committed to not just imparting knowledge, but also fostering the vital academic, organizational, and interpersonal skills that will serve students well as they progress through the Hackley Upper School and beyond. Acknowledging the importance of cultivating individual voices and connections, the faculty tailors the curriculum to meet these goals. In addition to traditional subjects like English, history, math, science, and foreign language, Hackley's Middle School curriculum embraces diverse learning avenues such as performances, debates, and scrapbooks. Visual arts, drama, music, health, physical education, and technology enrich the educational experience. While fifth graders convene in homeroom-based classes, sixth, seventh, and eighth graders engage in individually scheduled classes, along with an expanded range of extracurricular activities. Field trips, assemblies, community service endeavors, team sports, and social events enhance both learning and camaraderie among students.\n\nEngaged and active, Hackley Upper School students epitomize a collaborative approach, closely interacting with educators and peers. They thrive within a diverse and demanding curriculum that strikes a balance between mandatory subjects and elective options. The broader ethos of the Hackley School community further enriches their academic journey, contributing to an atmosphere of vitality and enrichment.\n\nWithin the Upper School, Hackley School students showcase an insatiable appetite for learning, displaying inquisitiveness both in their studies and about the world at large. Their willingness to pose thought-provoking questions to teachers, peers, and themselves reflects their eagerness for intellectual exploration. Importantly, the school's students understand that seeking assistance and posing inquiries to deepen their comprehension is a testament to their academic prowess, underscoring strength rather than vulnerability. The curriculum of the Upper School offers students a combination of structured framework and ample room for customization, progressively widening the scope of opportunities as they advance. Hackley School's academic programs are thoughtfully tailored to nurture skill development and intellectual maturity, adeptly preparing students for their collegiate journey and beyond. Beyond subject-specific knowledge, including a plethora of Advanced Placement (AP) courses, Hackley students also cultivate analytical writing, responsible research practices, adept participation in discussions and debates, collaborative problem-solving, and more.\n\nAccommodation in Hackley School While Hackley School does not provide centralized student housing for international pupils, the institution understands the significance of offering guidance and recommendations for students seeking comfortable and suitable living arrangements during their studies.\n\nTarrytown, with its captivating surroundings and accessibility to New York City, offers a range of housing options for international students to explore. These alternatives ensure that every student can find a residence that complements their lifestyle, preferences, and budget.\n\nFor those looking to immerse themselves in American culture and build meaningful connections, the homestay program is an appealing choice. Living with local families not only provides a comfortable living environment but also creates opportunities for cultural exchange. Additionally, Tarrytown offers rental apartments as well as homestay setups, enabling students to enjoy privacy and independence in an immersive environment. Rental costs typically vary based on factors such as location and amenities, ranging from $1,500 USD to $2,500 USD per month, while homestay ranges from $850 USD to $1,700 USD.\n\nShared housing is also a popular option, where students can rent a room within a shared apartment or house. This not only fosters a sense of community but also helps reduce costs. Shared accommodations usually fall within a similar price range as rental apartments.\n\nFuture Prospects after study in Hackley School Following your graduation from Hackley School, your academic path may lead you to post-secondary institutions such as universities or colleges. It is through these higher education endeavors that you can position yourself for avenues like the Optional Practical Training (OPT) or Curricular Practical Training (CPT) programs, which provide invaluable hands-on experience in your chosen field. These programs are only accessible to students who advance their education beyond the high school level, underscoring the significance of ongoing learning.\n\nWhile the PGWP may not be immediately accessible upon graduating from Hackley School, the pursuit of advanced education opens doors to broader possibilities. Post-secondary institutions not only equip you with specialized knowledge but also pave the way for practical training experiences that set the stage for a successful career.\n\nAs you set your sights on the future, consider the path to permanent residence status and even American citizenship. While the journey may be multi-faceted, the commitment to continuous learning and personal growth remains a constant. The United States offers a rich tapestry of opportunities across industries, and your education at Hackley School serves as a solid foundation upon which to build."
