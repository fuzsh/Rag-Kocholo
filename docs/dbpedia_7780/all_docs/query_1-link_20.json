        "text": "When you ask most newcomers why they put down their roots in Scarsdale, you’re likely to hear that the terrific public schools the top reason for the move. Along with the short commute to the city and the beautiful tree-lined neighborhoods, our top-rated schools are a huge draw for young families.\n\nStill, even with our great schools, there are some Scarsdale residents who choose to send their children out of the district for their education. Parents might choose a private school that can better accommodate their child with special learning needs, others may turn to a private school that will support their children’s religious education, or foster their child’s athletic endeavors, or perhaps they simply want a school for their child that has a philosophy that better suits their family’s goals and values.\n\nWhatever their reasons, parents in Scarsdale have no shortage of quality private schools to choose from. Any sort of education that one could imagine, from a progressive curriculum to a more traditional approach, from secular to clerical, a focus on special needs to a focus on different languages/culture, can be found just a stone’s throw away. Here is a list of local private schools that some Scarsdale parents have chosen for their children.\n\nHackley: https://www.hackleyschool.org/\n\nHackley School is an independent, college-preparatory, nonsectarian, day and boarding school for students in kindergarten through twelfth grade.\n\nMission: \"Hackley challenges students to grow in character, scholarship, and accomplishment, to offer unreserved effort, and to learn from the varying perspectives and backgrounds in our community and the world.\"\n\nThis mission challenges us to leave ourselves open to new possibilities--intellectual and interpersonal--with the option to change our minds.

Masters made adjustments throughout the pandemic to keep kids healthy and learning. In addition to the benefits of smaller class sizes and a Harkness-based approach, all students can participate in sports without the fear of getting cut. And if you ask the kids, the daily hot breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets are the best.\n\nOnce the worst of the pandemic was over, our child was thriving at Masters and did not want to go back to Scarsdale.” Scarsdale Parent\n\nUrsuline: https://www.ursulinenewrochelle.org/\n\nMission: Guided by our Catholic faith and the spirit of St. Angela Merici, The Ursuline School educates, inspires and empowers young women to become wise, active, globally-minded leaders by cultivating lifelong learning, spiritual growth, integrity, respect for all and dedication to Serviam – “I will serve.”\n\nLocation: New Rochelle, NY\n\nGrades: 6-12\n\nNumber of Students: 770 All Girls\n\nApplication deadline: High school December 16, 2022 / Middle School Entrance Test is scheduled for Saturday, December 3\n\nGreenwich Academy: https://www.greenwichacademy.org/\n\nMission: Greenwich Academy is an independent college-preparatory day school for girls and young women that seeks to foster excellence.
