        "text": "2023-24 Hackley School Season Preview\n\nRecruitTheBronx@gmail.com\n\nThe Hackley School is a high academic, private college preparatory school located in Tarrytown, NY, 25 miles up the Hudson River from New York City. It was founded in 1899 by a wealthy philanthropist, Frances Hackley.\n\nThe school is a member of the Ivy Preparatory School League. Given the high academic emphasis at the school, it made sense that four years ago they tapped Zach Kuba, one of the key mover and shakers in high academic New York City basketball to be their head coach. Kuba both coaches a high academic college prep AAU team for the Riverside Side Hawks program, he is also instrumental in organizing academic basketball showcases in the area.\n\nKuba has the Hackley program on the rise, last year’s 16-8 team finished the season strong before losing a heartbreaker at the buzzer against the Portledge School in the NYSAIS B Quarterfinals. Although the team lost five impact players from last year, don’t be surprised to see them making noise again at the top of the IVY League. Below are the guys for their 2023-24 season\n\nJelani Middleton (2026) 6’3 guard - Expect a big year from this sophomore that has matured physically and mentally since last season. Middleton will embrace a consistent ‘go to guy’ role after showing flashes of brilliance as a freshman. He will be a playmaker on both ends of the floor and we predict he will warrant All-IVY Honors this season.\n\nJack Perlman (2025) 6’2 guard - Perlman is primed to take on a leadership role statistically this year. A third year varsity player, he is now hitting his stride and feeling confident as a scorer and playmaker. Also a captain on the soccer team, Perlman is athletically one of the most dynamic players in the IVY and Coach Kuba expects him to make a name for himself this year.\n\nCaleb Bae (2024) 6’2 guard - Bae is another soccer player whose athleticism and skill translates nicely to the basketball court. He is constantly getting deflections and affecting the game on the defensive end. He anticipates the game extremely well at both ends of the floor. Offensively, Bae has incredible vision and is a high IQ cutter off the ball. He made a name for himself in the famous MSGR King Tournament last winter in Brooklyn with his dazzling passes and intense defense. Expect to hear his name again.\n\nJake Hendelman (2024) 5’10 shooting guard - Hendelman is pure shooter with quick release and range out to 25 feet. Confident ball handler and playmaker who is a good decision maker with the ball. As a third year varsity player, Hendelman continues to improve his leadership abilities and will set the tone for this year’s group.\n\nMac Broaddus (2024) 6’5 forward - Tough as nails and the most physical player on the roster, Broaddus is a Lacrosse standout committed to Haverford, but is a hooper too! Expect him to step up and embrace his ‘Draymond’ role with this smaller, scrappier Hackley squad.\n\nMatt Kearns (2024) 5’9 point guard - Kearns is a third year varsity player who is All League in Football at wide receiver will be playing collegiately at Hamilton College. He is the ”glue guy” for the basketball team that sets a positive example daily for his teammates.\n\nCharlie Perlman (2025) 6’5 forward/center - Perlman is the personality of the team. A big guy who can see the floor and pass the ball extremely well. He is pushing to become more in shape and last for longer stretches of game. Physical on the defensive end.\n\nAlex Nuzum (2027) 5’8 point guard - Nuzum is the one freshman that made the varsity team, and he brings a DOG mentality. He is scrappy and tough, handles the ball on a string and has solid range on his jump shot. He is great off the pick and roll. Expect to hear about the youngster this season."
