        "text": "Westchester County is known for a few things—famous families and former residents, its world-class dining scene, its unrivaled beauty, and its stellar public school system being just a few select areas of local excellence. However, the county’s public schools aren’t the only ones with impeccable records, and a new report from Business Insider has given some pretty good bragging rights to two of our best private schools: Rye Country Day and the Hackley School were both included in a list of the fifty “smartest schools” in the entire nation.\n\nWithin Westchester, Rye Country Day was named the number one private school—it was ranked 25th overall. Hackley School, located in Tarrytown, was the only other Westchester school on the list, and clocked in at 47th.\n\nEach school was judged by weighing SAT/ACT scores and the average number of graduates going into a four-year institution. Our neighbor, New York City, also had some schools in the top ten, including the Dalton School (10th overall), Trinity School (7th), and the Horace Mann School (5th). The so-called smartest school in the country? The girls-only Castilleja School in sunny Palo Alto, California."
