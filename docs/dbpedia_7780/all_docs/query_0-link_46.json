        "text": "After a successful Business Office Assessment and Leadership Search for a Director of Operations and Campus Planning for Hackley School (New York) earlier this year, Connor Associates was selected again for its executive search services.\n\nThis time Hackley is seeking a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to start in the Summer 2022.\n\nLeading the Leadership Search service is Connor Associates’ Finance and Operations Strategic Partner, Thom Greenlaw. Thom has served for over twenty-five years in varying senior roles in independent schools. He was most prominently the Special Assistant for Strategic Initiatives at Buckingham Browne & Nichols School (BB&N) from 2017-18 and Assistant Head for Operations/CFO at BB&N from 2001-2013. Thom also served as COO and Assistant Head for Strategic Initiatives at the Ethel Walker School and Business Manager of the Dana Hall School.\n\nThrough his consulting practice Creative Independents, Thom has served dozens of independent schools on a variety of initiatives, special projects, and executive search services.\n\nThom will be joined by Connor Associates’ Director of Special Projects, Carolyn Stiles in this search for CFO. Carolyn served as Connor’s Vice President for Client Relations and Market Research for more than 12 years. More recently she stepped into her current role which allows her to engage in assessing admission, communication, development, and marketing practices as well as support the leadership search effort for independent schools.\n\nMore About Hackley School\n\nEstablished in 1899 as a college preparatory boarding school for boys with strong ties to the Unitarian Church, Hackley has grown and evolved throughout its history. The school’s founder and initial benefactor, Mrs. Frances Hackley, partnered with leading area Unitarians to provide a nonsectarian school that embodied and embraced intellectual questioning and inclusiveness. Students of all religions, economic backgrounds, and national origins were welcomed, fully espousing the school’s official motto and core value, United, We Help One Another. These roots and values are found in the Hackley of today, perhaps best embodied in another of the school’s core values, Enter Here to Be and Find a Friend, which is carved over a door on the Main Building.\n\nHackley’s three schools make up its total enrollment of approximately 840 students coming from over 100 different zip codes in the tri-state area. Hackley has evolved from a 7-day boarding program for boys to be a co-educational school with a 5-day boarding program in the Upper School. Hackley’s 285-acre campus unites the entire K-12 community on a single campus, providing numerous resources that are integral to supporting the school’s educational mission.\n\nTo learn more about Hackley’s special community and the talented people who support it, please visit https://www.hackleyschool.org/."
