        "text": "Hackley has been inspiring students to Go forth and spread beauty and light for more than 120 years. Founded in 1899 by Frances Hackley, a leading philanthropist of her era, the school has grown into an 850-student, K-12 coeducational independent school situated on an idyllic 285-acre campus.\n\nWhile new buildings and programs have kept Hackley at the leading edge of the educational landscape, the School’s foundation rests upon people, relationships and community. At Hackley, who you are matters more than your individual accomplishments. Indeed, as one of our core values notes, Character is higher than intellect.\n\nOur campus, affectionately known as the Hilltop, has served as the setting for academic and personal growth for generations of students. Another core value, Enter here to be and find a friend, is carved above the entrance of our main building, welcoming all who come to the Hilltop. In that spirit, I encourage you to come see our campus in action. While you are here, you will find talented faculty working alongside enthusiastic students in an environment where academic inquiry and scholarship is respected and valued.\n\nThe School’s fourth core value, United, we help one another, serves to remind us that young people are best inspired in communities where they feel connected to something larger than themselves. Whether cheering on classmates at an athletic contest or performing arts concert, students at Hackley support one another on their journey through these transformational years and leave with lifelong friendships.\n\nThank you for visiting our website, and I look forward to seeing you on the Hilltop.\n\nGo Hack!"
