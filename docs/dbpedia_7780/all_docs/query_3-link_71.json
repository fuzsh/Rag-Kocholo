        "text": "This brand new interdisciplinary facility will soon welcome students, faculty, and visitors to the campus of this prestigious independent school located in Westchester County, NY. Designed by Pelli Clarke & Partners, the building will accommodate computer science, visual arts, performing arts, and music under one roof.\n\nFeatured spaces will include a 550-seat, multi-use auditorium, a 100-seat black box theater, a maker space, rehearsal and practice rooms, art studios, and finally, a beautiful art gallery. Creating a relationship between the arts center and the surrounding landscape will be a picturesque amphitheater on Akin Common, perfect for outdoor gatherings.\n\nKohler Ronan’s engineering professionals provided technology services, specifically IT, security, and audio-visual design, in addition to mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection building systems design to enable the diverse programming of Hackley School’s multi-purpose, multi-discipline facility. Kohler Ronan’s designs adhered to strict acoustical requirements to meet the noise criteria set forth by the acoustical engineers for the performing arts space, the rehearsal rooms, and black box theater. Additionally, careful coordination was required to accommodate the mechanical equipment and distribution as we sought to minimize the impact to program space. The project will pursue LEED Gold certification."
