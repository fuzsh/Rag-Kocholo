        "text": "Mobile network operators are counting on 5G to enable a wide range of indoor applications for both consumers and industries.\n\nHong Kong's communications watchdog has told telecoms operator SmarTone to submit a report after an outage on Thursday left many of its subscribers disconnected.\n\nHong Kong's incumbent mobile network operators could see improved financial performance next year, after the government concluded its much-anticipated public auction of radio spectrum on Monday.\n\nSmarTone Telecommunications Holdings, which has warned investors about a drop in net profit for the year to June, is likely to find its prospects turning brighter during this financial year after a lacklustre period in the mobile market.\n\nSmarTone Telecommunications, which saw its net profit fall in the six months to December, expects growth prospects to remain tough as the Hong Kong market awaits the 3G spectrum auction later this year and the release of a new smartphone that could boost consumer spending.\n\nSmarTone Telecommunications saw its shares drop 15 per cent in Hong Kong trading yesterday after announcing a cut in its payout ratio on Wednesday, citing the need to invest in its network to meet consumers' growing data demands.\n\nSmarTone Telecommunications has lowered its payout ratio to 60 per cent from 100 per cent, saying the move was prompted by the need to invest large sums in its networks to meet consumers' growing demand for mobile data and the government's 3G spectrum renewal policy.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has failed to appraise fully the negative impact that its plan to reassign 3G spectrum in use and impose a significant increase in license fees would have on mobile services, say local network firms.\n\nMobile network operator SmarTone Telecommunications has completed a US$200 million bond offering that will help finance the company's bid to renew its 3G spectrum licence in 2016.\n\nSmarTone Telecommunications, CSL, Hutchison Telecommunications Hong Kong and PCCW's HKT are to be invited by the legislative body's panel on information technology and broadcasting to discuss the issue on March 27, according to a Legco document.\n\nThe government, represented by the Communications Authority, is expected to decide on that plan in October, which would be exactly three years before the 3G spectrum licences of CSL, SmarTone Telecommunications, Hutchison Telecommunications Hong Kong and PCCW's HKT are due to expire."
