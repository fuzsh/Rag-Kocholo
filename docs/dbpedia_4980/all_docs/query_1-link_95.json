        "text": "If you already know what type of meter you have, skip to the right guide for taking a meter reading here:\n\nTraditional non-smart meters\n\nIf your meter has an analogue display or dials\n\nFirst generation (SMETS1) smart meters\n\nMost likely if installed before March 2018\n\nSecure SMETS1 smart meters\n\nIf your meter has a 'Secure' logo on the front and was installed before March 2018\n\nSecond generation (SMETS2) smart meters Most likely if your meter was installed some time after March 2018\n\nNone of the above?\n\nI'm not sure what kind of meter I have...\n\nWhy do I have to give meter readings?\n\nIf you’ve got a traditional analogue energy meter (not a smart one), you’ll need to send in regular meter readings so we can work out how much energy you’re using. Smart meters remove the need for meter readings (they send readings to us automatically - register your interest in a smart meter and we'll be in touch when engineers are available in your area) but there are a handful of situations where you might still need to take a manual meter reading from your smart meter.\n\nIf you're on one of our export tariffs, you'll have to provide 'export readings' from your SMETS1 or SMETS2 meter (not your generation meter, or your In-Home Display) so we can calculate your export payments. Below, in our guides to taking readings from SMETS1 and SMETS2 meters, we'll also explain how to take export readings from a range of different meters. If you're meter isn't included on the list, don’t hesitate to get in touch.\n\nElectricity and gas meters come in several different shapes and sizes, so before we can tell you how to read your meter, it’s important to work out which type of meter you have.\n\nWhat kind of meter do I have?\n\nTraditional (non-smart) meters\n\nAll households had meters like this up until a few years ago, when smart meters began being installed.\n\nIf your meter haven't been changed since before 2017, and either has dials or an analogue meter display with 4-6 black and white (and some red) numbers, you have traditional meters.\n\nHere's how to take readings from traditional analogue meters\n\nSmart meters\n\nThere are two different generations of smart meters – SMETS1, the earlier version, and SMETS2, the latest version.\n\nHow to tell what kind of meter you have\n\nIf you're already with us, you can head to your online account dashboard. In the section that contains information about your meters, click 'how to read my meter', which will take you to the correct section of this blog.\n\nTo be 100% sure which kind of meter you have, the best way to find out exactly which type (and brand) of smart meter you have is to contact the energy supplier that installed it. If that was us, don’t hesitate to get in touch!\n\nWe installed Secure™ branded smart meters up until 2018, they have 'Secure' logos on the front. (Secure™ also supplied meters to Utilita, Shell, OVO, E.ON and Bristol Energy - so if you have a first generation SMETS1 smart meter from them and it’s a Secure™ meter, this section is for you too!)\n\nFind out how to read your Octopus-installed Secure™ brand first generation (SMETS1) smart meter\n\nFind out how to read your non-Octopus first generation (SMETS1) smart meter\n\nFind out how to read your second generation (SMETS2) smart meter\n\nIf you're still unsure, the easiest thing to do is get in touch!\n\nHow to read a traditional analogue meter\n\nElectricity Meters\n\nDigital single meter\n\nLooks like this:\n\nHow to read:\n\nWrite down the five numbers as they appear. Ignore the red one.\n\nDigital dual meter\n\nLooks like this:\n\nThis is for those of you on two energy rates for different times of the day. The cheaper one is on top.\n\nHow to read:\n\nWrite down the five numbers as they appear, ignoring the red ones.\n\nDigital dual meter (single display)\n\nLooks like this:\n\nSome dual meters have a single display where you might have to press a button to view each rate.\n\nHow to read:\n\nWrite down the numbers as they appear.\n\nPress the button to see the next reading, then write that down too.\n\nDial meter\n\nLooks like this:\n\nHere you’ll see five dials, each with numbers 0 to 9. There may be a sixth dial on the right, sometimes in red, or with 1/10 next to it – ignore this.\n\nHow to read:\n\nWrite down the numbers the pointer has just passed, from left to right.\n\nIf the pointer lies exactly on any number, underline it (in the above example, you would underline the 4).\n\nNow, look at your five numbers. For any that are underlined, look at the number following it – if it’s between 9 and 0, reduce your underlined number by one. The above example would therefore be 1 3 9 7 0.\n\nGas\n\nLike electricity, there are a few different types of gas meter, but they’re all fairly simple to read.\n\nDigital imperial meter\n\nLooks like this:\n\nHow to read:\n\nWrite down the first four numbers as they appear. Ignore the red ones.\n\nDigital metric meter\n\nLooks like this:\n\nHow to read:\n\nWrite down the first five numbers as they appear – ignore the numbers after the decimal point (sometimes in red).\n\nDial meter\n\nLooks like this:\n\nThere might be more than four dials, you only need to read the bottom four.\n\nHow to read:\n\nWrite down the numbers closest to the pointer, as they appear. If it’s between numbers, put the lower number, but if it’s between 9 and 0, write 9.\n\nHow to read a first generation (SMETS1) Octopus installed Secure™ Smart Meter\n\nTo take a manual meter reading on a standard electricity tariff:\n\nPress 6 on the keypad.\n\nYou'll see the letters “IMP R01” appear on the screen.\n\nWait a moment – then eight digits will appear, followed by “kWh” towards the bottom right of the screen.\n\nTake the first 7 digits – this is your reading.\n\nTo take a meter reading on an Economy 7 electricity tariff:\n\nPress 6 on the keypad four times.\n\nWait a moment – your day/peak and night/ off-peak readings will show up on the screen one after the other, starting with off-peak.\n\nFor your off-peak reading, you'll see “IMP R01” onscreen. A second later, you'll see your meter reading: eight digits, with “kWh” towards the bottom right of the screen.\n\nFor your peak reading you'll see “IMP R02”. A second later, you'll see eight digits, with “kWh” towards the bottom right of the screen. You'll only need to take the first 7 digits when taking each of these readings (i.e. nothing after the decimal place).\n\nFor a smart gas meter, do the following:\n\nPress 9 on the keypad.\n\nThe word “VOLUME” will show on the screen.\n\nYour gas reading, in cubic metres (m3) will appear.\n\nTake the first five digits as your reading.\n\nTo take an export reading from a Secure SMETS1 smart meter do the following:\n\nPress 9 on the keypad.\n\nThe words \"EXP kWh\" will appear on the screen.\n\nYour reading will appear in kWh.\n\nTake the first 7 digits – this is your reading.\n\nTo take an export reading from a Secure SMETS1 smart meter with 2-rates (including Economy 7):\n\nPress 9 on the keypad until you see 'EXP kWh'\n\nYour reading will appear in kWh.\n\nTake the first 7 digits – this is your reading.\n\nHow to read a first generation (SMETS1) non-Octopus smart meter\n\nAt Octopus Energy, we can automatically read all second generation (SMETS2) and we can also read Secure™ branded first generation (SMETS1) smart meters. But if you switched to Octopus with a different brand of (SMETS1) meter, your meter will no longer be smart (and we’ll be unable to take automatic readings). This means you’ll currently have to take manual meter readings (although we’re currently working alongside other industry experts to remotely upgrade all first generation meters, so that they become ‘smart’ again!)\n\nFor the time being, here's our ultimate guide to taking manual readings from a non-Octopus first generation (SMETS1) smart meter:\n\nReading your non-octopus SMETS1 smart electricity meter:\n\nYour electricity reading will be a number followed by “KWH”. We don't need the numbers after the decimal place.\n\nIf your meter has more than one unit rate (for example, if you're on an Economy 7 tariff), you'll have to take a reading for each rate. The two readings will appear one after the other — generally followed by “R1” and “R2” (Rate 1 and Rate 2). There is no set rule as to which one is your peak rate reading and which is your offpeak. Your meter might have a sticky label indicating which is which, though.\n\nAfter R1 and R2, a third reading might appear onscreen — “T”. This is the total of your peak and offpeak readings combined. You don't need to give us this one.\n\nIf your meter has A and B buttons:\n\nPress the A button.\n\nKeep on pressing this until you get to “TOTAL ACT IMPORT”.\n\nThe number shown below this is your meter reading.\n\nIf your meter has a green A and a white B button:\n\nPress and hold the green A button for at least 2 seconds.\n\nPress A again and again to cycle through the displays.\n\nThe first row of numbers you'll see is your meter reading.\n\nIf your meter has three unmarked buttons:\n\nPress the middle button.\n\nThe number shown below “IMP” is your meter reading.\n\nIf your meter has an orange button and a blue button:\n\nPress the orange button.\n\nYou'll see a row of numbers followed by “KWH”, this is your reading.\n\n*If your meter has two buttons marked Reconnect and Display Select:\n\nPress the “Display” or “Display Select” button.\n\nKeep pressing until it scrolls through a number followed by kWh, this is your reading.\n\nReading your non-octopus SMETS1 smart gas meter:\n\nYour gas reading will be a number followed by “m3”. We don't need the numbers after the decimal place.\n\nIf your meter has A and B buttons only:\n\nPress the A button.\n\nKeep on pressing this until you get to “METER INDEX”.\n\nThe number shown below this is your meter reading.\n\nIf your meter has three square red buttons (they might be labelled A, B, and C):\n\nPress the A (or left) button.\n\nYou'll see a row of numbers followed by m3, this is your reading.\n\nIf your meter has a left arrow, a circle and a right arrow:\n\nPress the middle “circle” button.\n\nThe screen will show “current meter reading” at the top.\n\nYou'll see a row of numbers followed by m3, this is your reading.\n\nIf your meter has orange and blue arrow buttons:\n\nPress the orange button.\n\nYou'll see a row of numbers followed by m3. This is your reading.\n\nHow to read a second generation (SMETS2) smart meter\n\nIf you're switching to Octopus and already have a second generation (SMETS2) smart meter, we'll soon be able to connect to your meter and take readings automatically, but your very first reading needs to be sent manually.\n\nThere are a few different brands of SMETS2 meter – you'll be able to tell what yours is based on the logo on the front.\n\nThis guide will tell you how to take a manual meter reading from the most common types of SMETS2 meters. If you aren't sure whether you have a SMETS2 meter, or think you have a SMETS2 meter but can't find it on this list, it's easiest just to get in touch.\n\nHow to read your Aclara SMETS2 electricity Meter:\n\nTo read your Aclara electricity meter, press 'A' to wake up the screen.
