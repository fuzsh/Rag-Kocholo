        "text": "Content\n\nThe product is made from\n\nRecycled fibres\n\nChemicals\n\nThe packaging material is made from paper or plastic.\n\nMaterial\n\nRecycled fibres\n\nRecycling of paper is an efficient use of resources as the wood fibres are used more than once.\n\nHigh demands are put on quality and purity of recovered paper, considering each step of the chain (collecting, sorting, transporting, storage, use), to ensure safe and hygienic products.\n\nRecycled fibres can be produced from different types of recovered paper, such as collected newsprint, magazines, office waste, paper cups, drink cartons, corrugated boxes and paper hand towels. The choice of recovered paper grades is made for each product, depending on its specific requirements on performance properties and brightness. The paper is dissolved in water, washed and treated with chemicals under high temperature and screened to separate out impurities.\n\nBleaching of pulp, used for tissue, is primarily a process to remove substances that could have a negative effect on important properties of the finished product such as purity, absorption, strength and colour of the pulp.\n\nBleaching of the recycled fibre pulp is done using chlorine-free bleaching agents (hydrogen peroxide and sodium dithionite). Some of our products are bleached and some are not.\n\nFor bleached products we use bleaching agents (to increase the brightness of pulp from recovered paper).\n\nChemicals\n\nAll chemicals (process aids as well as additives) are assessed from an environmental, occupational health and safety and product safety point of view.\n\nTo control product performance we use additives:\n\nWet strength agents (for Wipers and Hand Towels)\n\nDry strength agents (are used together with mechanical treatment of the pulp to make strong products like wipers)\n\nFor coloured papers dyes and fixatives (to secure perfect fastness of the colour) are added\n\nFor printed products printing inks (pigments with carriers and fixatives) are applied\n\nFor multi ply products we often use water soluble glue to secure the intregrity of the product\n\nIn most of our mills we do not add optical brighteners but it often occurs in recovered paper since it is used in printing paper.\n\nWe do not use softeners for professional hygiene products.\n\nHigh product quality is secured through quality and hygiene management systems throughout production, storage and transport.\n\nIn order to maintain a stable process and product quality the paper manufacturing process is supported by the following chemicals/ process aids:\n\ndefoamers (surfactants and dispersing agents)\n\npH-control (sodium hydroxide and sulphuric acid)\n\nretention aids (chemicals that help to agglomerate small fibres to prevent fibre loss)\n\nCoating chemicals (that help to control the creping of the paper to make it soft and absorbent)\n\nTo reuse broke and to utilise recovered fibres we use:\n\nPulping aid (chemicals that help to repulp wet strong paper)\n\nFlocculation chemicals (that help to clean out printing inks and fillers from recovered paper)\n\nBleaching agents (to increase the brightness of pulp from recovered paper)\n\nIn the cleaning of our waste water we use flocculation agents and nutritients for the biological treatment to secure that no negative impact on water quality comes from our mills.\n\nEnvironmental certification\n\nThis product is certified with the EU Ecolabel with certificate number SE/004/001.\n\nThis product is certified for FSC® with certificate number SA-COC-008266.\n\nPackaging\n\nFulfilment of Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC): Yes\n\nArticle creation date and latest article revision\n\nDate of issue: 19-04-2019\n\nRevision date: 27-08-2024\n\nProduction\n\nThis product is produced at Hondouville mill, FR and certified according to ISO 9001, ISO 14001 (Environmental management systems), ISO 45001 and FSC Chain-Of-Custody.\n\nDestruction\n\nThis product is suitable to be taken care of in the normal sewage system of the community.\n\nEssity UK Ltd, Southfields Road, Dunstable, Bedfordshire LU6 3EJ, United Kingdom"
