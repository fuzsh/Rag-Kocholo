        "text": "Hiya everyone,\n\nI recently had the pleasure of accompanying my Long time friend Roberta Phillip from Hermosa, South Dakota and, then the next day our favorite Kearney college kiddo, Courtney Cox out for lunch. Both choices were Mi Ranchito. Located at 930 Flack Avenue in Alliance. It wasn’t a long drive, (for me) However, They both did the Road Trip for their Favorite Alliance place, Mi Ranchito!! And I got to go 2 days in a row!\n\nRoberta “Bert” was there the first day, so we enjoyed our chips n salsa and arranged for our food to take out. Then we met Betty Jo Garett at the fountain and had a wonderful lunch, while Bones the doggo enjoyed the shade of a tree. For lunch, we had, Tacos Al Carbon for me, and Bert had Enchiladas, We both were crazy about our meals. Betty Jo was sad she had already eaten. But the visit was great.\n\nNext day I was to meet the Cox’s and again enjoyed the chips and salsa. Me being the smart one got their early, as this is my favorite part of the meal. Dang those are good! And, I always manage to eat a couple to many. As there is no such thing as a small plate at Mi Ranchito. I don’t care what you order.\n\nFrom the minute you walk in the door there, you just waft on in on the wonderful smell. Then you hear Patrick somewhere toward the back laughing and folks laughing with him. He sure is a treasure to that place!!\n\nBy now Courtney and her folks Casey & Rhonda Cox had arrived, and we all ordered. We are serious enchilada plate fiends! We always say we are going to try something else fantastic, almost never do. Hot plates with Enchiladas, green sauce, rice and beans. What more can you ask for!!\n\nOur waitress also asked about drinks. Courtney now 21 thought she would like something. I suggested a margarita as they are so wonderful. She didn’t think she wanted tequila. I said there are so many flavors, so she tried a watermelon one, and her dad a yummy looking strawberry Daiquiri\n\nCourtney’s drink arrived in a cactus glass, she tasted it and fell in love. She thought they were sooooooo good. Yup, Aunt Tami knows good margaritas. I was surprised though, at how many flavors they have of them. Wow. Like a kid in a candy store, it would be so hard to choose!! The drink diffidently did not disappoint!!\n\nOur meal arrived hot and wonderful as always. I don’t know how they get it perfect every time. But it was awesome. Our waitress was so attentive, we knew her from another place, I wish I had asked her name. She took great care of us. I cant hardly wait for Courtney to visit home again. We will be back!
