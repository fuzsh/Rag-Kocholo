        "text": "With the Syracuse Orange football team ushering in a new era under coach Fran Brown, there’s a lingering question most fans likely have in the back if their minds.\n\nHow is Coach Brown going to be as an in-game coach?\n\nRecruitment success and strong culture building aside, it’s not like Brown brings zero experience to the table. He previously served as defensive backs coordinator for Temple, Rutgers and the national champion Bulldogs. He was under the wing of Georgia coach Kirby Smart, one of the most successful current coaches in the sport. Bringing him to the Orange was clearly an unconventional, but absolutely correct, choice.\n\nTwo things can be right at once: the on-field inexperience is a legitimate concern. It might be Brown’s only one. It might partly explain Syracuse’s rankings in the ACC preseason poll, among the oddsmakers and within the national outlets (namely CBS Sports).\n\nWe’re not going to speculate, but what we can do is look at the history of the program. What does past precedent say about how Syracuse could fare this upcoming season, Brown’s first at the helm?\n\nThe answer: there isn’t really a clear answer.\n\nDating back to the Ben Schwartzwalder era (for simplicity sake), the numbers look something like this:\n\nAmong the names, two coaches really stand out among: Paul Pasqualoni (for all the great reasons) and Greg Robinson (for all the wrong reasons).\n\nPasqualoni took the Orange to consective 10-win seasons in 1991 and 1992, which were Syracuse’s first two years in the Big East. After the results regressed slightly in ‘93 and ‘94, Syracuse rattled off this crazy stretch between 1995 and 2001:\n\nSix bowl games in seven seasons (4-2)\n\nFive AP top-25 finishes\n\nx1 10-win campaign\n\nx3 9-win campaigns\n\nPasqualoni not only had a great year-one, but that inevitably turned into a long tenure. Since the Orange became non-independent, Dino Babers (8 seasons) is the next-closest Syracuse coach to match Pasqualoni’s tenure (14 seasons).\n\nYou can’t say the same for Pasqualoni’s successor. Robinson shot out of the gate with a 1-10 record in 2005, then never surpassed four wins until he was canned for Doug Marrone just three years after his first season. Robinson’s first year included a nine-game losing streak, eight of which were by double-digit margins.\n\nPasqualoni and Robinson mark the end points for this analysis. The other six coaches, simply put, fall somewhere in the middle when you look at how things ended up playing out.\n\nFrank Maloney (1974 to 1980) started off with a 2-9 record in year one, then guided Syracuse to two winning records (both 6-5) the next three years. He peaked in ‘79 with a 7-5 record and an Independence Bowl berth, then was out after ‘80.\n\nDick MacPherson (1981 to 1990) started off really slow. After a 4-6-1 record in year one, Syracuse reached six wins twice the next three years but was a combined 14-19 during that stretch.\n\nOut of the blue, the wait was worth it: Syracuse reached its absolute highest peak (‘85 to ‘90) in program history outside of its 1959 championship season. That included five bowl games in six years and the iconic ‘87 team that went 11-0-1 and made it to the Sugar Bowl.\n\nDoug Marrone (2009 to 2012) had one of the lower winning percentages out of the list in his first season. His tenure lasted as long as Robinson’s, but Marrone’s success (two eight-win seasons and a pair of Pinstripe Bowl wins) ranks no lower than fourth among the eight coaches listed. Then came Scott Shaffer, who had the second-most wins among all first-year Syracuse coaches... and quickly faltered and eventually had the smallest tenure within the list.\n\nMost recently, there’s Dino Babers (2016 to 2023). He started off with back-to-back 4-8 seasons, then came the unthinkable 10-3 year, and lastly, a rollercoaster last half-decade of his tenure.\n\nBack to the initial question, what does this mean for Brown’s outlook in year one? In Syracuse football history, first-year results for coaches isn’t predictive of what happens after that. The numbers show that the first-year results are indeed all over the place.\n\nWith all that said, Brown does have the pieces in place to have that good first year. He brought in experienced coaches and players. He knows the issues, the stakes and the legacy of the Syracuse program. He’s clearly saying all the right things. He’s brought an energy to the team and a rebirth in confidence from the fans. The background and past experiences are impressive, and coming from a recent winner like Georgia is major for all sorts of reasons.\n\nSyracuse football history doesn’t say much, so we’ll have to just wait and see what Brown can accomplish in 2024."
