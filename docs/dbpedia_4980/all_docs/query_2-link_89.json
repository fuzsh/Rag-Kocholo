        "text": "This is frustrating. I continue to hear that Lightroom's collections and folders are both first class citizens and that Aperture's virtual folders are limiting. But my results are always that there are many things I can do with Aperture's folders that I can't do with Lightroom - either its folders or its collections.\n\nFor example:\n\n• Can't reorder collections (alpha sort only)\n\n• Can't reorder folders (alpha sort only)\n\n• Can't convert a collection to a collection set\n\n• Can't delete an image from it's collection, the catalog and the hard drive without some weird keyboard multi-fingered combination\n\n• Can't move an image from it's folder and have that change matched in it's mirroring collection\n\nBob\n\nAs I mentioned in your other post on Collection naming, Collections are always sorted based upon the sort order defined by the operating system. The Folder panel is a reflection of the filesystem which again uses the sort order of the operating system\n\nCollections are \"buckets\". Virtual in the sense that they have no relationship with the filesystem organization. An image file can exist in one and only one folder. This is a constraint of the filesystem. OTOH, in LR, an image can be a member of many collections. And many images can be members of one collection yet organized by the filesystem in many different folders\n\nThe file location of an image in LR in not important. The folder panel is available in LR only as a convenience so that file operations in Finder can be performed simultaneously with updates about the image path in the LR catalog.\n\nYou can dump every image into one folder on import. LR won't care. You can spend lots of time organizing your images into descriptive folder names before import and LR still does not care. You should be able to hide your folder panel and use keywords and smart collections to find any image in your LR catalog.\n\nI use a modified version of John Beardworth's \"Workflow Smart Collections\". Modified to extend to Smart Publish collections in the Publish panel. I have only one static collection named \"00.00 - Current Work Target\" All the rest are Smart Collections that used metadata and keywords to populate. Although I do occasionally create other temporary static collections outside of my workflow, these are for a temporary convenience. My workflow consists of three overarching steps:\n\nPress the {Import} button.\n\nAdd keywords, Titles, Captions and Develop adjustments.\n\nPress the {Publish} button\n\nIf you let it, LR can be your Image data organizer (DAM). Time that you spend not adding keywords, Titles and Captions and not doing post processing development is inefficient when you have to power of a tool that can do all of these things for you.\n\nComing from Aperture, you are struggling with the differences. These differences should not be described as better or worse, but just different. Aperture being an Apple product tends to hide the organizational complexity from you. Aperture tries to minimize the organization complexity by restricting how you can do things. Lightroom recognizes that there are different work styles and more than one type of organization scheme by trying to embrace all of them to some degree.\n\nOrganizing by filesystem Folder has some severe limitations imposed by the filesystem. Because of that, DAM tools were created. Aperture and LR are examples of different implementations of the same DAM principle. Both address the weaknesses inherent in the file system organizational structure by creating pseudo folder structures that don't contain these weaknesses.\n\nYou chose to come to LR from Aperture for a reason. Probably because Aperture development has been constrained for several years now and is beginning to fall behind other DAM tools. Both Aperture and LR (and Corel's AfterShotPro) incorporate image post processing with image organization. There are other DAM tools (like PhotoMechanic) that just do the image organization. I'm not going to say that LR is the only way or the best way. But it is a good solution and can be used effectively to permit you to find any image that you need almost instantly.\n\n...You can tell I'm not here for the Library module! If I could splice the Lightroom Develop module into Aperture's Adjustments pane, I would be happy indeed.\n\nThe development module is an integrated ACR with a custom LR user interface. You can get that same ACR version in PS or PSE. Aperture permits the use of External editors. Perhaps that is your solution. There is no reason that post processing needs to be tightly integrated with the DAM tool. There are other RAW converters and editors that have reviews that are comparable to those for ACR. You might investigate these too.\n\nFWIW, my first encounter with LR was not any better than yours. And I explored Aperture briefly after converting to LR. It and iPhoto come across to me as an obfuscating bloated POS. The HD is clogged with too many intermediate images and Aperture wants to hide your master originals from you and changing that aspect is not intuitive. Changes to Aperture have dumbed it down to iPhoto user levels which does not help advance it as a professional DAM tool. I'm sure that an experienced Aperture user can refute most of my negative observations about Aperture. But they represent truly my first impressions. Others and I are here to help you with your transition. Try to keep an open mind and look for ways to achieve your organizational goals instead of ways of trying to do what you have always been doing.\n\nGood! So you were experimenting and you used a Collection (many here call them \"dumb\" Collections as opposed to Smart Collections - but not to indicate they're useless) and you found you also need a Smart Collection to do what you want. That's good info. LR simply works differently but it can do what you want as long as you adapt to its way of doing things.\n\nNow this is just a tiny part of information about your entire workflow requirements. I'd like to know more. When I had built my own workflow Smart Collections in Lightroom (a series of SC's to figure out which images still needed work), and when I stumbled across johnbeardy's set of workflow SC's, they brought a smile to my face because they originated from the very same idea. However they were implemented completely differently.\n\nI would like to suggest you have a look at john's workflow smart collections. See what you think of the idea behind them and if this could be something you could use. Then build upon that to create your own workflow in Lightroom. It's just a suggestion to find out which total package of holes you are wanting to drill.\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nFWIW, when I first started working with LR seriously (about 6 months ago), I kept muttering (unmentionable words) under my breath and feeling I was running into obstacles because of design features I didn't like. What I soon realized was that I had created a nice workflow and organization before that worked with the software I then had, and what I was subconsciously doing was trying to make LR mimic the workflow and organization I had developed for the other software. Talk about drilling a square peg into a round hole! (sorry for the mixed metaphor...). I realized (finally?) that every piece of software has its own organizational structure and logic and trying to keep my old system going was worse than useless, because not only would LR not do that well, but I was failing to take advantage of all the nice things LR DOES do so well.\n\nI can't say that even after 6 months that I feel I'm fully taking advantage of all of the things LR does well to keep images organized, but once I stopped trying to force my preconceived ideas on LR and lurked around here (and asked lots of questions) to help me understand how people used LR to organize their images, I got to be a very happier camper.\n\n[Note: this is not a LR vs Aperture comment....I've only dabbled in the latter and claim no knowledge of its relative advantages/disadvantages]"
