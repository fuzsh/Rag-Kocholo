The choice of recovered paper grades, is made for each product, depending on its specific requirements on performance properties and brightness. The paper is dissolved in water, washed and treated with chemicals under high temperature and screened to separate out impurities.\n\nBleaching is a cleaning process of the fibers that is often used. The aim is then to achieve a bright pulp, but also to get a certain purity of the fiber in order to achieve the demands for hygiene products and in some cases to meet the requirements for food safety.\n\nBleaching of the recovered pulp is made with chlorine-free bleaching agents (hydrogene peroxide and sodium dithionite). Except for Natural Napkins that are unbleached.\n\nFor bleached products we use bleaching agents (to increase the brightness of pulp from recovered paper).\n\nChemicals\n\nAll chemicals (process aids as well as additives) are assessed from an environmental, occupational health and safety and product safety point of view.\n\nTo control product performance we use additives:\n\nWet strength agents (for Wipers and Hand Towels)\n\nDry strength agents (is used together with mechanical treatment of the pulp to make strong products like wipers)\n\nFor colored papers dyes and fixatives (to secure perfect fastness of the color) are added\n\nFor printed products printing inks (pigments with carriers and fixatives) are applied\n\nFor multi ply products we often use water soluble glue to secure the intregrity of the product\n\nIn most of our mills we do not add optical brighteners but it often occurs in recovered paper since it is used in printing paper.\n\nWe do not use softeners for professional hygiene products.\n\nHigh product quality is secured through quality and hygiene management systems throughout production, storage and transport.\n\nIn order to maintain a stable process and product quality the paper manufacturing process is supported by the following chemicals/ process aids:\n\ndefoamers (surfactants and dispersing agents)\n\npH-control (sodium hydroxide and sulphuric acid)\n\nretention aids (chemicals that help to agglomerate small fibers to prevent fiber loss)\n\nCoating chemicals (that help to control the creping of the paper to make it soft and absorbent)\n\nTo reuse broke and to utilize recovered fibers we use:\n\nPulping aid (chemicals that help to repulp wet strong paper)\n\nFlocculation chemicals (that help to clean out printing inks and fillers from recovered paper)\n\nBleaching agents (to increase the brightness of pulp from recovered paper)\n\nIn the cleaning of our waste water we use flocculation agents and nutritients for the biological treatment to secure that no negative impact on water quality comes from our mills.\n\nPackaging\n\nFulfilment of Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC): Yes\n\nArticle creation date and latest article revision\n\nDate of issue: 30-03-2023\n\nRevision date: 02-04-2024\n\nProduction\n\nThis product is produced at Hondouville mill, FR.\n\nDestruction\n\nThis product is suitable to be taken care of in the normal sewage system of the community.\n\nEssity Canada Inc., Cira Centre, Suite 2600 2929 Arch Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA"
