        "text": "You should not think that normal (static) Collections and Smart Collections as mutually exclusive. Their different characteristics are both useful.\n\nFor example I do all my image processing, development, keywording, etc. in normal Collections. These are project based, i.e. a specific shoot or event. After import I create a Collection Set \"Project_name\" and put all the images in to a Collection \"Project_name - all\". Then I switch the Collection \"Project_name - all\" to do my processing. This has the advantage that all stacking for HDR or Panorama series are visible and the results of any photo merge or external editing automatically added back into this collection.\n\nThere may also be some special purpose collections, for example a separate collection for a star trail sequence or light painting sets where I will do all the work for preparing the source images, send them to Photoshop for all the layering and masking. I then add resulting finished TIFF into the \"Project_name - all\" . I can then use that collection name as the basis for one or more Smart Collections such as 3Star to quickly find all my top rated images from the shoot.\n\n-louie\n\nOne other thing is the performance of Lightroom. For what i have understand is that lots of smart collections can have a negative impact on the performance.\n\nSmart Collections do not exist until you click on it to open in Grid view or what ever, Behind the Smart preview name entry in the list is a SQL query described by the criteria. It does not run until you open or refresh the Smart Collection. SO the only performance hit occurs when you open the Smart Preview.\n\nFWIW, I have only one standard collection and run a version ofJohn's Workflow Smart Collections. Occasionally when working outside of my normal workflow I will create temporary static collections. And of course, I have had to generate static collections for all of the sync'd albums in Lightroom (cloudy)\n\nSmart Collections do not exist until you click on it to open in Grid view or what ever, Behind the Smart preview name entry in the list is a SQL query described by the criteria.

I remember we've had this discussion some years ago. I don't think that smart collections cause a great performance hit, but they do get updated all the time, even if you do not open them. Try this: Create a smart collection that searches for a rating of five stars. Look at the number of images that the smart collection displays in the collection panel. Select another source, select an image and press the '5' key to give that image five stars. Look at the number behind your five star smart collection. It will increase instantaneously.\n\nYou should not think that normal (static) Collections and Smart Collections as mutually exclusive.

I should have clarified, and yes each has it's own use. I was just trying to convert some dumb ones to smart ones to sync to get into myportfolio. I found it easier to just filter and put in the target collection, and sync it.\n\nWhy would you edit from the collection instead of the imported folder? are the collections not updated if you edit outside the collection. I created folders mostly to stop filtering all the time Just filter once and send the results to the collection is what I do.\n\nAnyway I got things working. I just created the smart ones from scratch. The smart ones are always updating, that's why I like them better.\n\nNo, that is not completely true. I remember we've had this discussion some years ago. I don't think that smart collections cause a great performance hit, but they do get updated all the time, even if you do not open them. Try this: Create a smart collection that searches for a rating of five stars. Look at the number of images that the smart collection displays in the collection panel. Select another source, select an image and press the '5' key to give that image five stars. Look at the number behind your five star smart collection. It will increase instantaneously.\n\nNo noticeable degradation of performance. when you add a photo to a collection, you are not adding a copy, only a pointer to the photo. the main difference between the two types of collections is one is instantly and continuously updated (smart). Regular collections are not updated until you point to it from the photo. There is only ONE photo to work with. The collections just point to the small preview so you can see the photo.\n\nNo noticeable degradation of performance. when you add a photo to a collection, you are not adding a copy, only a pointer to the photo. the main difference between the two types of collections is one is instantly and continuously updated (smart).

Having lots of smart collections could in theory give a hit in performance, because -as I just described- they are constantly updated. I doubt you will notice it however, unless you really have hundreds of them.\n\nWhy would you edit from the collection instead of the imported folder? are the collections not updated if you edit outside the collection. I created folders mostly to stop filtering all the time Just filter once and send the results to the collection is what I do.\n\nAll of my import presets put all new images into date based folders so the images for a specific shoot or project almost always reside in multiple folders. Putting all the images in to one top level collection gives me one clearly identified place to to to see all the images captured for that event. This is done one time at the front so you almost never have to to go back and update it.\n\nYou do need to be diligent to select the specific \"all\" collection as your source when doing any organization. That way stacks, merges and derivatives created by external editors are automatically put back into the master collection.\n\nThere is one minor bugaboo in the handling of \"Rejected\" images. For normal working in use custom Filters that all hide \"Rejected\" images. That works well. However, when it comes time to actually permanently remove these from my catalog and hard drive. You can't do it when your source is a collection. The easiest way is to go to either the enclosing folder or the special collection \"All Photographs\" and do the remove from catalog and hard drive from there.\n\n-louie"
