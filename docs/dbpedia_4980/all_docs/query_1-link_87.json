        "text": "Matt Damon And Wife Make Rare Red Carpet Appearance With Their 4 Daughters\n\nThe Oscar winner attended the premiere of \"The Instigators\" with his family, including his mother, in tow.\n\nLOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nProud “girl dad” Matt Damon is celebrating the release of his latest film with his family by his side.\n\nThe Oscar winner and his wife, Luciana Barroso, turned up at the New York premiere of “The Instigators” with daughters Isabella, 18, Gia, 15, and Stella, 13, in tow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso in attendance were Damon’s 25-year-old stepdaughter, Alexia Barroso, and his mother, Nancy Carlsson-Paige.\n\n“The Instigators,” in which Damon co-stars with Casey Affleck, is a family affair for Damon in more ways than one. Luciana Barroso is one of the producers of the film.\n\nDamon credited his wife of 19 years with convincing him to sign on for the movie, which hits theaters Friday ahead of its AppleTV+ debut next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Casey likes saying she is the smart one in the couple,” he told Entertainment Tonight, “and he’s not wrong.”\n\nDirected by Doug Liman, “The Instigators” follows Rory (played by Damon), a former Marine and strapped-for-cash dad, who teams up with an ex-con, Cobby (Affleck), to rob a corrupt Boston politician (Ron Perlman).\n\nEarly reviews of the film have been mixed. Rolling Stone called it “a total flashback to a bygone era of filmgoing,” while The Hollywood Reporter said it seemed “designed to make critics grasp for new ways to say ‘Meh.’”\n\nAppearing on SiriusXM’s “Radio Andy” this week, Damon shared his parenting advice with host Andy Cohen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I just try to listen and be helpful,” he explained. “Ultimately, it’s about building self-esteem. You know, 99% of the decisions they make, you’re not gonna be there.”\n\nThe actor said he’s been “cool with” meeting his daughters’ boyfriends, noting that he and his wife “adore” the “incredible” man Alexia is dating.\n\n“To see that she’s making those kinds of choices, really, it’s as good as it gets,” he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Our Partner"
