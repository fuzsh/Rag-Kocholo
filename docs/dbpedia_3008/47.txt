In 1922 an incident broke out in the Balkans in a place called Chanak in Turkey. By the terms of the treaty ending the First World War, Britain was committed to maintaining troops there to protect the strait linking the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. When Turks threatened these British troops, Britain sent out a call to its Dominions for assistance.

Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King sent a cable to Westminster saying that he would have to consult Parliament before sending troops. This was a signal that Canada was no longer automatically at war on Britain's demand. Fortunately, the crisis passed before there was any further involvement, but the incident is important as an example of Canada's increasing independence from England.
