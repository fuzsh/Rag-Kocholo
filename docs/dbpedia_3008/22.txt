The Chanak Crisis was an Anglo-Turkish dispute in 1922 over control of the Dardanelles Strait that brought the two countries close to war. It was caused by Britain and Greece backing the Turkish sultan against Turkish nationalists led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk who wanted to overthrow the Treaty of Sevres. The crisis was resolved through a truce agreement between Britain and Turkey as British forces were outnumbered at the port of Chanak and neither side wanted war so soon after World War I.
