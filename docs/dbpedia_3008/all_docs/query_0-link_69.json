        "text": "Can any one help me with information on the 3rd Heavy Battery at Chanak in 1922 and 1923. A Captain Richard Shrive was there with the RGA and a battery of 8in Howitzers but although I have a number of his photographs taken over this period I have not been able to find details or diaries written by individual soldiers who were present. I was told that the troops spent their time behind barbed wire at Chanak and the Turkish troops marched up to the wire with rifles on 'a backward slope' so show that they did not wish to attack but that the British and their allies should go home. However, it did not seem to restrict the officers from going on shooting parties on the peninsular, shooting feathered game and going on wild boar hunts.\n\nThe three photographs are interesting but unfortunately the names of the men are not known to me. (The officer 5th from the left middle row is Richard Shrive)\n\nAll\n\nSince making these posts I have further information. Although the photographs do refer to the Chanak Incident, it seems they were all taken on the European side where the 8'' Howitzers were located not at Channak. All the men in the photographs were 1st World War RGA.\n\nWoolwich has kindly sent me some details of the history of the 3rd Heavy Battery which adds to the story. It seems that that there was also the \"4th Heavy Battery\" and possibly 2 others perhaps also \"1st & 2nd\". The Malta reference is a red herring as these new batteries were formed especially for this Incident.\n\nThe document details are as follows:-\n\nHistorical Record – 3rd Heavy Battery RGA\n\nFormation – The battery was formed under authority War Office Cipher ******** No 91156 dated 21-9-22 and CRGA Northern Command No GRNC 14459/9 RA dated 22 -9-22.\n\nThese stated that D. & C Coast Batteries were to be amalgamated to form 3rd Heavy Battery of 1st Heavy Brigade, to be equipt with 4-8 inch Howitzers then in charge of E Coast Battery.\n\nOfficers to be posted by GOSC Commands. Establishment 6 officer, 146 OR and one RAOC Artificer attached, and all to be ready for embarkation by 30th September 1922.\n\nOfficers – Major G A Hassells-Yates, Captain W A V Thomas, Lieuts Grundy, Crane, Shrive & Suddick.\n\nA priority telegram notified the O.C. that guns equipment were to be loaded on AMT \"Hunnie\" at Glasgow on 26th September leaving Catterick on 24th.\n\nVery few men being immediately available, 100 ORs of Green Howards were sent to Catterick Camp from Richmond to carry out entrainment on Saturday & Sunday 23rd and 24th of guns & stores.\n\nThese were despatched on 24th in charg of Lt Suddick & 4 other ranks by special train.\n\nBetween 23rd & 24th personnel to complete establishment joined from Dover, Sheerness, Portsmouth, Great Yarmouth, Tynemouth.\n\nEmbarkation – The battery entrained with full establishment (Less 'Hunnie' party, I officer 4 OR) at Catterick Camp on 29-9-22.\n\nArrived at Southampton & embarked on HMT \"Corsican\" for the Dardanelles.\n\nDisembarked at KELIA LIMAN (European Side) on 11-10- and encamped there guns & stores remaining on \"HMS Hunnie\"\n\nOn 29-10-22 the Battalion was moved to a covered position with guns covering the Asiatic Side at the entrance to the Dardanelles\n\nThe guns + one tractor were put ashore by means of a 50 ton floating Sheers and a small existing pier.\n\nThe guns were reported ready for action by 5-11-22.\n\nCommand – Major Hassells-Yates, having been notified of his pending retirement preceded to UK on 29-10-22 having handed command over to Cap. W A V Thomas.\n\nGeneral – The battery encamped close to the gun position under canvas & during the winter encountered some very severe weather. The men suffered somewhat from cold though there was very little sickness & no casualties.\n\nAll men were in Nissin Huts by 1-1-23\n\nRations were conveyed by the Sea & after a few modifications this arrangements worked very well.\n\nThe battery took from England the 6 – 8inch howitzers which had been held by 'E' Coast Battery & while at KELIA two howitzers with their equipment were handed over to 4th Heavy Battery who had up to then no armament.\n\nOwing to the international crisis which had brought the battery from England, war conditions were instituted in the battery. A loan enceinte & strong points for defensive purposes were constructed around the camp and a wireless apparatus attached from Royal Corps of Signals. W AV Thomas Capt **-4-23\n\nCONFIDENTIAL No. 781 Copy\n\nOfficer I/C\n\nR.G.A. Records\n\nDOVER\n\nHerewith Transcript from the Historical Records of H.Q., & D.E., R.G.A. Tyne & Tees Defences, and \"D\" and \"E\" coast Batteries R.G.A.\n\nSection. 8\n\n12-9-23. The Third Heavy Battery R.G.A., returned to Catterick Camp from Turkey.\n\n14-9-23. The 3d Heavy Battery R.G.A., was disbanded. Its complement was reformed into \"D\" and \"E\" coast Batteries R.G.A., and R.G.A., details Catterick Camp were also absorbed into \"D\" and \"E\" coast Batteries R.G.A.\n\nTynemouth\n\n26-3-1924\n\n(Sgnd) H.F.L.Grant\n\nMajor & Bt. Lieut. –Colonel .G.A.\n\nTyne and Tees Defences\n\nI still would still like to identify the men in the photographs and those mentioned in these documents (I am investigating the MICs) as they were all 1st War R.G.A.\n\nMike"
