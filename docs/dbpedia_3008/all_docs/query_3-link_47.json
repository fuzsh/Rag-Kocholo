        "text": "Introduction to the CD-ROM\n\nThe ICB Encyclopedia of Twentieth Century Crises, presented on the accompanying CD-ROM, provides the reader with direct access to the rich resources of the International Crisis Behavior Project. For readers familiar with the original 1997 publication of A Study of Crisis, the CD contains all of the material presented in Part III, pages 65–737. In addition to summaries of each of the 412 international crises, the CD goes further by presenting the case summaries and accompanying data sets in tabular form, corresponding to key concepts that scholars have used to better understand the dynamics of international crisis. A powerful search capability accompanies the summaries and tables, intended to assist the reader in navigating through this material, and a variety of printed reports can be generated. This information is organized using FileMaker Pro. Finally, the CD contains the ICB data sets in both raw and SPSS formats, allowing the reader to utilize standard statistical packages to delve more deeply into the data and to test hypotheses about crises in the twentieth century.*\n\nWe hope that readers will take full advantage of the ICB Encyclopedia of Twentieth Century Crises. A reader may scroll through the cases chronologically, by region, by specific country, issue, or trigger type, stopping to examine cases of particular interest more carefully by linking to the summaries and introductions to protracted conflicts. Alternatively, the reader may launch a structured search designed to create a subgrouping of cases—for example, all Middle East cases, or all Middle East cases in which the UN intervened, or all Middle East cases in which the UN intervened successfully, and so on. Once a group of cases of greatest interest has been identified, printed reports can be generated, or the data in table or summary form can be saved to files for further analysis.\n\nIn the sections below, we provide a guide to the format of the substantive elements of the CD—crisis summaries and protracted conflicts, Crisis Overview form and related tables, and the ICB data sets. Once the CD is loaded, the “Help” Page 66 →menu should be consulted for an overview of the capabilities and functions available.\n\nCrisis Summaries and Protracted Conflicts\n\nICB research has uncovered 412 international crises and 895 foreign policy crises since the end of World War I, that is, eruptions that met the defining conditions of these concepts as specified earlier (pp. 3–5). Almost 60 percent of the cases occurred in 31 protracted conflicts (PC) (see Table IV.36 below), the other 40 percent outside that context. A complete listing of all ICB crises appears at the end of this section.\n\nCase summaries begin with background information, including references to previous crises between the same adversaries, and the setting in which the international crisis erupted. The summary then specifies the crisis actors, the first trigger and trigger date, the triggering entity, and the duration of the international crisis. Crisis actors are those states whose decision makers perceive the three defining conditions of a foreign policy crisis: an increase in threat to one or more basic values; an awareness of time constraints on decisions; and heightened probability of involvement in military hostilities at some point during a crisis. Trigger refers to the act, event, or situational change that catalyzes a crisis. Trigger date designates the day these three perceptions became manifest for the decision makers. Triggering entity is the state or non-state actor that initiates a crisis. Duration is measured from the entry of the first participant in an international crisis to the exit of the last participant; in operational terms, from the first crisis actor’s trigger date to the last termination date; that is, when the crisis perceptions of the last state to leave an international crisis decline to pre-crisis norms.\n\nThe case summary then specifies the trigger for the other crisis actors, along with the content and date of their major response, namely, the act that captures the major thrust of each state’s behavior in coping with its crisis. The summary also contains information about the highest value perceived to be at risk, from limited military damage, through threat to political regime, territory, or influence, to the gravest value threat, a threat to a state’s existence. The crisis management technique employed by each state is also noted, with special reference to the intensity and centrality of violence. So too is crisis termination, both the content and form of outcome, for each actor and for the international crisis as a whole. Major power (in)activity during the course of an international crisis, too, is indicated, as is the extent of involvement by global and/or regional organizations to bring about crisis abatement. Finally, attention is drawn to the primary and secondary sources of the data assembled for each crisis and for the presentation of the case summary. The crises are presented sequentially by trigger date, and may be viewed in that format or sorted on a wide variety of other organizing concepts.\n\nAs noted, 60 percent of all ICB crises occurred in the context of a protracted Page 67 →conflict. Thus, in addition to summaries of each case, the reader can also access background information on each of these 31 protracted conflicts (enduring rivalries). This background material includes a listing of all cases associated with a particular protracted conflict, as well as information pertaining to the origins of the conflict, the individual participants, and how the conflict terminated.\n\nCrisis Overview Forms and Related Tables\n\nIn addition to the verbal description of the cases via the summaries, the CD presents data on each case in two formats: forms and tables. These features are organized into nine categories: crisis overview, crisis trigger and behavior, crisis characteristics, geography, great power involvement, superpower involvement, global organization activity, regional organization activity, and crisis outcomes. Each category, in turn, contains data on a number of distinct variables. For example, the crisis trigger and behavior form and table exhibit data at both the international and foreign policy crisis levels on triggering entity, trigger, major response, primary crisis management technique, overall violence, centrality and severity of violence, and timing of violence. The reader may view these data by form for each individual international crisis, or by table for the entire set of 412 crises. An icon next to each variable on the forms links to the ICB codebook containing definitions of the variable and coding rules. Finally, links exist so that the reader can move quickly from forms/tables to summaries of specific cases.\n\nInternational Crisis Behavior (ICB) Data Sets and Codebooks\n\nThe complete ICB data sets are included on the CD in both raw and SPSS formats. They are accompanied by two codebooks: ICB1—International Crisis Level Data Set; and ICB2—Actor Level Data Set. These data are also available from the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan as Study #9286.\n\nList of ICB Crises by Name and Trigger/Termination
