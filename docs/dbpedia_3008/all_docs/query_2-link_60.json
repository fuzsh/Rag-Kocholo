        "text": "The Ohio University History Graduate Conference kicks off with a keynote speech by Professor Emeritus Steve Miner on April 14 followed by a full day of panelists and speakers from around the nation on April 15.\n\nThe History Graduate Student Association at Ohio University organizes the annual graduate student research conference each spring, attracting participants from history graduate programs around the country. The conference is free and open to the public.\n\nMiner, professor emeritus of history in the College of Arts and Sciences, is a internationally known scholar on Russian history. The keynote, “Vladimir Putin and History,” is April 14, from 6:30-7:30 p.m. in Bentley 233.\n\nThe conference is sponsored by the History Department. Professor and Chair Brian Schoen said that he is very pleased that the conference is able to return fully in person this year.\n\n“The conference showcases our talented graduate students and attracts students from other programs around the country. It allows them important opportunities to network with students from other campuses and to get constructive feedback on their research projects. It is a source of pride for our internationally known M.A. and Ph.D. programs,” Schoen said.\n\nThis year attendees will get a very special treat, the opportunity to hear Miner deliver a timely talk that evidences the importance of learning about different cultures and societies, Schoen added.\n\n“Steve Miner is a leading scholar of Russian history and someone who has dazzled undergraduate students with his clear and thoughtful lectures over his three decades at Ohio University,” Schoen said. “Few people are better positioned to situate Russia’s current dictator into a broader historical context. Those able to attend will not be disappointed.”\n\nConference panel schedule for Saturday, April 15\n\nCheck-in arrival and breakfast is 8 to 9 a.m. in Bentley 233.\n\nSession 1: The Interpretation of Mediums: Reading Between the Lines of Visual Media\n\n9 to 10:30 a.m. in Bentley 009\n\nCommentator: Katherine Jellison, Ohio University, professor of history\n\nChair: Sukyoung Hong, Ohio University, Ph.D. candidate\n\nCaleb Fouts, Syracuse University, Ph.D. candidate: “June 10, 1940: Consensus or Crisis?\"\n\nPaul D.
