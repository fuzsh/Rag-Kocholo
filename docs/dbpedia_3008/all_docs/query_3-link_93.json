        "text": "The Edenton Tea Party and Alternative of Williamsburg cartoons depict petition signings that occurred on the eve of the American Revolution. The Edenton Tea Party occurred in October of 1774 as influential women came together to sign a petition to stop transporting of products such as clothing and tea from Britain. The Alternative of Williamsburg cartoon illustrates the signing of a petition, the \"Williamsburg Resolutions\", against the Intolerable Acts. The \"Williamsburg Resolutions\" called for the cease of transport of American tobacco into Britain until all taxes on imported goods were lifted. At first glance the political cartoons of the Edenton Tea Party and the Alternative of Williamsburg are relatively similar, with the exception of gender.\n\nWhen one thinks of Canada, he/she is most likely to stereotypically comment on a subject regarding hockey, beavers, maple syrup, and cold weather. However, not many stop and wonder about how Canada became the peaceful nation it is today. Throughout Canada’s relatively short and brief history, it has managed to flourish into a strong and powerful nation. Canada’s peaceful identity has been formed with meaningful historic events that have occurred throughout our history.It’s identity has been characterized by Lester B. Pearson's role during the suez canal, their involvement in the Vietnam war, and its engagement in peacekeeping missions around the world.\n\nThe early 20th century was a time where many canadians began to be more vocal with their opinions towards the government. Canada’s involvement in the war led many citizens to question whether their government was really looking out for their best interests. To ensure that the people of Canada would continue to support the war effort, Canada began to employ the use of propaganda, mainly in the form of posters. These posters would often depict our enemies to be ruthless savages who were intent on destroying our nation. The government would also hide the many of the negative aspects of war, and would instead focus heavily on the better aspects such as heroic acts\n\nOne of the best ways to judge the different political arguments in Canada from the early 20th century is by reviewing the different political cartoons that were released. These were an effective way of educating the masses because it did not require an advanced education or vocabulary to understand where each side was debating. One of the more popular conflicts that were ongoing in the first years of the 1900’s was the fight for women’s equality. This included the right to vote and the right to participate in government. By comparing political cartoons from before, during, and after the First World War the changing context of Canadian society also affected the public opinion and the power balance towards the evolution of Women’s equality.\n\nIndependence, the state of being free from outside control, and not subject to another’s authority. The 1920s and 1930s were a time for Canada to leave its British roots behind and forge its own identity, as well as take control of all matters relating to the preservation of the country and its people. However, this was not the case. Canada, although receiving some leeway from the British, remained a dependent country under the thumb of outside forces due to the fact that they were still under the British North American Act, thereby not having their own constitution, as well as the English monarch remaining as the head of state, and because it moved its economic dependence off the shoulders of one nation and unto another’s. Although the Chanak Affair showed that Canada’s military was no longer obligated to fight\n\nThe article “Race and Recruitment In World War 1: Enlistment of Visible Minorities in the Canadian Expeditionary Force*” Written by author James W. ST G. Walker that can be found in the Canadian Historial Review (March 1989 Edition) discusses the discrimination against minorities during World War 1. Outlining the events from 1914 through 1917 that depict this injustice against visible minorities. It gives a detailed view of changing attitutudes of government and recruiting officials towards visible minorities and their position and value to the war efffort. James W. ST G. Walker goes about trying to prove that while World War 1 may have been a step forward for both women and Eastern Europe it was\n\nPolitical cartoons are an illustrative technique that political cartoonist use to display a message to the viewers about government, world affairs, and politics. In 1754, publishers of the Pennsylvania Gazette published the first political cartoon illustrated by Benjamin Franklin (West, par. 1). Benjamin Franklin used his first political cartoon, titled Join or Die, to gain support from the colonies for the Crown’s war against the French (West, par. 1). Since the 1700s, illustrators use political cartoons as a medium to display political messages to its viewers (West, par. 1). On March 10, 2015, publishers of the Columbia Daily Tribune published a political cartoon, illustrated by John Darkow, titled Hillary Has A Primary Opponent (Darkow,\n\nThe political cartoons of the 1800s reflected the feelings of many laborers of the time. The American Revolution began in the early 1800s and continued through much of the 19th century. The low wages and high fees of being a laborer, added to the long hours many worked, made people desperate to find a better way of life. Despite their need for a better life, many laborers had little skill or ability to anything else. As the cartoon shows they are being crushed between their high rent that they are required to pay and the low wages being driven by the new monopolies and corporations of the time. Eventually riots broke out in the cities as the workers got more and more desperate to push for an increase in wages.\n\nFormer prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, believed greatly in what he thought Canada was to become. “The nineteenth century was the century of the United States. I think that we can claim that is it Canada that shall fill the twentieth century. “ was said by Laurier and his words passed almost without notice at the time. However, it did not take long before his words had somehow been transformed into the most famous phrase in Canadian history, “The twentieth century belongs to Canada.” His words showed great confidence and pride in the actions that Canada was supposedly to take to fulfill his vision. He believed that Canada would fill the century, not in size or military might but in progress, growth, and quality of life. Ultimately, he\n\nFollowing a decade of classy, conventional living, the 1960’s was a decade filled with the Beatles, turtlenecks, Barbies, and afros. A decade where days were filled with tie dye shirts, and coloured televisions determined your social status. The 1960’s was also filled with racism and many were faced with unjust judgements and consequences for their actions. Through all of this emerged three events that changed Canadian history and how Canadians themselves viewed their country as a whole. Through the acceptance of a new flag, hosting Expo 67 on Canada’s centennial, and the fulfillment of universal health care, the 1960’s was a decade that brought tremendous unity and national pride to Canadians.\n\nThis essay will show you how Canada was at the turn of the century in 1896 to 1919. A lot of points show how Canada was at the turn of the century such as how Canada was at a time of social change, the immigrants in Canada come from all over the world, Chinese were treated horribly, a lot of racism factored into this. Also, Canada was in a time of economic uprise, this can be characterized by electricity, inventions, the growth of cities, and some other contributing factors. Free trade laws with the United States were also in a heavy debate at the time.\n\nAs the 20th century comes to an end, Canada is a transcontinental nation whose interests and representatives span the face of the globe and extend into every sphere of human behaviour. However this was not always the case. When the four colonies of British North America united to create Canada on July 1, 1867, the new country's future was by no means secure. Canada was a small country, with unsettled borders, vast empty spaces, and a large powerful neighbour, the United States. Confronting these challenges was difficult for the young country. Though Canada was independent in domestic matters, Britain retained control over its foreign policy. Over the next fifty or so years, Canada's leaders and its\n\nWhat is Canada? What is a Canadian? Canada, to employ Voltaire's analogy, is nothing but “a few acres of snow.”. Of course, the philosopher spoke of New France, when he made that analogy. More recently, a former Prime Minister, Joe Clark, said that the country was nothing but a “community of communities”. Both these images have helped us, in one way or another, try to interpret what could define this country. On the other hand, a Canadian could be a beer, a hockey-playing beaver or even a canoe floating in a summer day's sunset. A Canadian could also be a “sovereigntyphobe”, refusing to see the liquefaction, albeit political, of the second largest country in the world."
