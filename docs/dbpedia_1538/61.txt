Comedy Central announced Wednesday it was renewing three of its comedy series, “Brickleberry,” “Key & Peele” and “Drunk History,” for new seasons to air in 2014.

Of the three shows, “Key & Peele” has had the longest run, with the network ordering a fourth season of the show. The sketch comedy series, starring Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, counts President Obama among its fans.

“Brickleberry,” the animated comedy series about the lives of park rangers, may have offended many TV critics, but it’s No. 1 in its time slot among young men, so that’s good enough for the network to give it a third season. It features the voice talents of Tom Kenny, Natasha Leggero and series executive producers Daniel Tosh, Roger Black and Waco O’Guin.

The newest series to get the second season pickup is “Drunk History,” which started as a series of shorts on Will Ferrell and Adam McKay’s Funny or Die website. Despite some harrumphing from some quarters about the series condoning drunkenness, it has actually been a critical and popular hit for the channel. Various guest stars, including Jack Black, Winona Ryder and Stephen Merchant, have participated in the show’s re-creations of momentous historical events, as narrated by incredibly intoxicated people.
