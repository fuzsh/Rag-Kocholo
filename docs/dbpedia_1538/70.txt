Comedy Central is handing out renewals to Key & Peele, Drunk History and Brickleberry.

The former, one of the network’s highest-rated series with young men, will return for a fourth season. Starring executive producers and co-creators Keegan Michael Key and Jordan Peele, the series has been faring even better with a lead-in from South Park.

After a strong September premiere, Key & Peele jumped 37 percent with adults 18-49 for a 1.0 rating and 49 percent with adults 18-34. Its third season is averaging 1.9 million viewers and tops cable in its hour among men 18-34. Comedy Central also credits the series with north of 400 million streams across multiple digital platforms since premiering. Ian Roberts, Jay Martel and Joel Zadak also serve as EPs on the series.

Drunk History, which debuted in July after an original incarnation ran as a web series on Funny or Die, averaged 1.2 million viewers over the course of its summer run. It was created for television by series host Derek Waters and director Jeremy Konner and has included the likes of Connie Britton, Michael Cera, Kristen Wiig and Jack Black in its sprawling guest cast.

Brickleberry, from Tosh.0‘s Daniel Tosh, will return for a third season — following an average audience of 1.6 million viewers in its current run.
