Brickleberry has ended its run on Comedy Central. The cable network has opted not to renew the animated comedy series for a fourth season.

The offbeat Brickleberry, executive produced by Comedy Central star Daniel Tosh, was an unlikely success when it debuted in 2012, airing behind Tosh’s highly rated Tosh.0 on Tuesdays. Its strength has been young male viewers, with the toon winning its slot among men 18-24 for the first two seasons. Brickleberry’s third, and now final, season ended its run on November 18. It averaged 1.2 million viewers, down from the 1.6 million average for Season 2. It continued to do best in the younger demos, averaging a 0.93 rating in adults 18-49 (935,000 People 18-49) and a 1.81 in Men 18-34 (480,000).

Brickleberry, created/executive produced by Waco O’Guin and Roger Black, revolved around a group of dysfunctional park rangers at a second-tier national park. It featured a voice cast that includes Natasha Leggero, Tom Kenny, Dave Herman, Jerry Minor, Roger Black and Tosh as Malloy, the cuddly yet vulgar and spoiled resident bear. The series was produced by Fox 21 TV Studios, with Bento Box executing the animation.
