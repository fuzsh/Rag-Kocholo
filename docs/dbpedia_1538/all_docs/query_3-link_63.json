They're on the level of Ren & Stimpy's Spike TV run.\n\nShit and cum aren't worth laughing at because you said \"shit\" and \"cum.\" There have to be jokes. These turds don't seem to bother with that.\n\nDisclaimer: I watched all of them.\n\nSo I was wondering if anyone actually thinks those are good shows or they really laugh at such jokes, because most of the jokes and themes feel like you would do in primary school.\n\nThe shows all have lots of anal sex jokes, fecal jokes, pedo jokes etc.\n\nI actually wonder how they can continue making shows and got a deal with Netflix for several shows for some years.\n\nMaybe they're cheap and quick to make? Never seen any of these.\n\nThese are kinda a guilty pleasure for me. I low key love them especially while i'm high. I wouldn't recommend to others though as they def are this weird acquired taste."
