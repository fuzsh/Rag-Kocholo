        "text": "Lance Reddick stars as Renzo, an egotistical human warrior who has liberated the planet Farzar from evil aliens — it’s all part of the new Netflix sci-fi animated comedy series, Farzar, created by Roger Black and Waco O’Guin, whose previous animated projects include Brickleberry and Paradise PD. Black and O’Guin have been making outrageous comedy since meeting in college at the University of Georgia, and I spoke with them about their journey from Yucko The Clown on Howard Stern to animation, and with Reddick about pivoting from prestige TV to prank comedy.\n\nYou can watch the NSFW trailer here:\n\nWant to discover other cool Substacks?

This is our third animated show. Super excited. We love the animated world system. We built it from Brickleberry. We started with a national park, then we went to an ensemble kind of workplace and now, the ultimate dream is working in space. Because we've always wanted to do a sci-fi show. We're huge sci-fi nerds and fans of that and He-Man as well. We grew up on all the cartoons in the 80s and everything.\n\nSo there is a natural through-line through all of your animated projects.\n\nRoger: Yeah. A lot of times we use the same cast and everything, too, because we get such a shorthand from working with them for so long.\n\nAnd how does Lance Reddick enter the picture?\n\nLance Reddick: Gingerly."
