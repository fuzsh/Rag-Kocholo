        "text": "Hello everybody, my name is JoyofCrimeArt, and legacy can be an fascinating thing in regard to animation. Since cartoons are made with the intent of being seen years or even decades after they're created, it can be interesting to see how the general consensus people have about a series can change over time. One day you can be on top of the world, and your series is loved by critics and audiences alike. But then, something happens. Sometimes it's a specific episode. Other times a season. Maybe it's a controversy within the fandom. But whatever it is, something happens that causes peoples opinions to turn. And suddenly your show has gone from being universally praised to becoming much more divisive. And when something like that happens, it can be hard to recover. It happened to Steven Universe. It happened to Rick and Morty. And it happened to Star vs. the Forces of Evil.\n\nCreated by Daron Nefcy, Star vs. The Forces of Evil premiered on the Disney Channel and Disney XD in 2015, and quickly became one of the hot cartoons that everybody was talking about. It makes sense, as it came outright around the time where more continuity based fantasy series were really starting to take off, so it's natural that it became a hit. While the series was generally well regarded upon its debut, as time went on the series became much more of a \"love it or hate it\" type of show. And while that's not too uncommon for any show that amounts a large flowing, what makes Star vs. so interesting is that it seems like nobody can seemingly agree when the show got bad, if it did at all. Some people say the quality dipped after the first season. Others say the third. Some say the fourth. Others say that the show was good until the finale. And some say that the show was solid throughout. This divide among fans is why I feel confident calling Star vs. The Forces of Evil one of the most divisive shows of the 2010's, even if the debate around it isn't nearly volatile as other series. But now that the series has ran its course I have to ask, does it hold up? Did the show really go down hill, or is the hate undeserved? That's what I'm here to find out.\n\nI feel like I'm in an interesting place to talk about this series because, while I tend to try to keep up with all the big name animated show coming out, I actually didn't watch most of Star as it was running. I watched the first season until my family cut cable right before the finale of season one (You know, around the time people started to care about the show.) And only caught up with the show in the last year or so while doing research for my \"Top 30 Cartoons of the Decade\" list. So I went into the series mostly blind with the exception of a few spoilers. I just felt like this was important to point out as I feel it may have an effect on my view of the show.\n\nAlso, while I usually try to go spoiler free when I do a general overview of a series, for this review I may have to go into some spoiler territory. Since this series features an ever changing status quo, as well as a lot of major characters who aren't introduced until late in the series' run, doing this review completely spoiler free would be difficult. So I'm going to be doing this review under the assumption that anybody reading this has already seen the show, and are just curious to hear my take on it, or don't care about being spoiled. So if you wanna go in blind I suggest you sign out now.\n\nBut to everyone else, let's dive in and talk about Star vs. the Forces of Evil.\n\nStar vs. The Forces of Evil stars (He, get it. I'm funny.) Star Butterfly. A princess from the dimension of Mewni who, upon her fourteenth birthday is given a wand of unbelievable magical power. However, after causing nothing but trouble with her new found powers in her world her parents decide to ship her off to Earth, where she can be somebody else's problem. There she befriends a human boy named Marco Diaz and the series mainly follow these two as they go on all sorts of magical adventures as they battle all sorts of evil monsters and ne'er-do-well who want to take the wand and use its power for themselves. Or at least that's how the series goes at first. As the series goes on it begins to focus more on the world building, as Star and Marco discover that the kingdom of Mewni isn't as great as they first believed, and are forced to battle political corruption, conspiracy within the royal family, and the generation spanning systemic racism against monster kind.\n\nThe best place to start when talking about the show are the characters. Lets start with the main leads.\n\nWe got Star, your typical fun-loving, ditzy, hyperactive action girl. Which seems to be a common trend in Disney Channel cartoons now that I think about it. But she does enough to stand on her own. She's a fun character, and an overall good lead for the series. I admit that her bratty nature and general stupidity could turn some people off, and there are times where it can get a little annoying, but I never minded it all that much. I think that's kinda suppose to be the point of her character. She's a royal, and spent her whole life with a silver spoon in her mouth. So it makes sense she would be a bit selfish and be unaware of the world around her. And she does improve over the course of the series, as she begins to take her job as a princess more seriously and spends much of the series actively fighting against monster prejudice. Though I'd be lying if some of these less desirable elements of her character don't continue to pop up every now and again, even later in the series and especially in the last couple of episodes. Also she's kinda a sociopath. Like especially early on in the show there are like...a lot of casualties to Star's antics. I'm kinda surprised Disney let them get away with that.\n\nAlso, can I just say that I am sick and tired of people asking \"When is Disney going to include their first LGBTQ+ princess, completely ignoring the fact that Star is bisexual as fu*k. Like, come on now!\n\nMarco is also a good lead. He's a neurotic, responsible, karate student who often acts as the straight man to Star's antics. However, I like the fact that he's not a total stick in the mud. Sure he's more cautious than Star is but he's still capable of getting in on the adventures as well. He comes across as a realistic teen with his own set of flaws. Namely his insecure nature and general social awkwardness. I also like that due to his expertise with karate he's able to hold his own in a fight even without magic. He always feels like Star's equal and never like a sidekick. He and Star have a great dynamic in general, and the two play off each other well. They contrast with each other and It feels like the two really cover each other's flaws. And it's kinda refreshing seeing two characters who are so different manage to genuinely get along with each other.\n\nBut of course, we also have the forces of evil that the shows title so clearly mentioned. Each season focuses on a different villain, and something that I really like is how all four major villains are introduced relatively early on. So the show doesn't suffer from that \"Dragon Ball Z\" type thing where it's like \"Haha! I know you just defeated the villain, but now's there's an even BIGGER villain who we just haven't happened to mention until now!\" They've always around in the world, and many of them even start out as joke villains only to become more serious later down the line. And they manage to do that in a way that feels very believable.\n\nThe best example of this is the shows first villain, Ludo. Who upon introduction is portrayed as a completely comedic villain who Star could easily take in a fight. But things change when a new more serious villain, Toffee, usurps him as the season one antagonist. Stealing his castle and army in the process. Come season two and Ludo is left alone, having lost everything, and is forced to toughen up in order to get back what he once had. He builds a new army, stronger than his first. He finds a new castle to form his base in, and becomes a genuine threat to our cast. Scrappy underdogs villains who lost everything might be one of my favorite tropes in fiction. Other examples of this trope used effectively would be Peridot in Steven Universe and Jamack in Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeast. However, while those shows use this trope as an opportunity to have these villains go through a redemption arc, Star goes the other way and uses it as an opportunity to make a character become more of a threat. That said, he never loses the comedic charm that made his fun to watch in the first place. Part of me honestly kinda wish that Ludo stayed the main villain of season two, instead of being usurped Toffee yet again. That said, the episode \"Princess Quasar Caterpillar and the Magic Bell\" does a good job giving his arc a satisfying conclusion.\n\nSpeaking of antagonist, let's talk about Tom Lucitor. Star's demon ex-boyfriend. While not a season spanning villain like Ludo or Toffee, he has several appearances early on as a recurring antagonist only to go down the more traditional \"redemption arc\" route later on. And I just want to say upfront, Tom is one of my favorite characters. Not in the show, but in fiction in general. It would of been so easy to make Tom your generic \"toxic boyfriend\" arch-type but even early on it's made clear that even though he's an antagonist, he isn't pure evil. His love for Star is genuine, but the problem is that he hasn't earned it. He tries to improve himself and become a better person but his own anger issues and jealousy keeps getting in the way. Specifically jealousy of Marco because he seems him as a romantic threat. But as time goes on, he does become better. He learns that he and Marco have a lot in common and eventually accepts that he can't make Star love him, and lets her have her space. And that, ironically, causes Star to becoming willing to open up to him again. They become friends and eventually get back together. But what I like is that while he has gone through efforts to improve and work through his problems, they still persist throughout the series. He's still very insecure and is looking for constant approval from Star. He still is jealous of how close Star and Marco are even though he has become friends with both of them. And it's shown several time that Tom tends to put his own problems above the problems of others. It shows that even though he wants to change and is willing to change, that doesn't mean that change come easy. It takes time and can be a long process. These are realistic character flaws that make Tom such a more complex and relatable character in my eyes. I relate a lot to Tom with his desire and constant struggle to improve as a person, and I feel like it's a struggle that's easy for a lot of people to relate to. Also...he's just such an edgy dork. He's...he is good boi.\n\nAnother fantastic character is Eclipsa. Introduced about halfway into the series, Eclipsa was a former Queen of Mewni who was imprisoned in crystal due to dabbling in dark magic and for running away from her arranged marriage and marring the King of the Monster, Globgor. The show builds up mentions of Eclipsa early on, with characters talking about how evil and dangerous she was. Eventually she becomes free from her prison (cause lets be real, whenever there's a villain sealed away somewhere you KNOW they're going to get out.) But surprisingly, when we see her she actually doesn't seem that evil. She's polite, kind, and is even willing to go through the proper legal channels to prove that she isn't as bad as people say she is. She is an excellent example of a morally ambiguous character cause for the first several episodes we the audience don't really know if she is actually a good person who's just been judged too harshly by society or if she is actually evil and this is all an act. As even as the show goes on and it becomes clear that Eclipsa is a good person at heart they still manage to keep the audience guessing. Much like Star, Eclipsa can be kinda selfish and impulsive, making her a bit of a loose cannon. Despite the shows title \"Star vs. The Forces of Evil\" Eclipsa goes to emulate one of the shows major themes. That life isn't that black and white.\n\nThe show deals a lot with shades of gray when it comes to its characters, as all characters have there own motives and backstories and relations with each other that can make them either allies or enemies depending on the circumstances. An example of this is the Magical High Commission, a group that monitors magic across all the dimensions. throughout the series it is shown that they stand on the side of Mewni. So in season two when Mewni is being conquered by Ludo and Toffee they're good guys. But just like most most people in Mewni they hate monsters and believe that Eclipsa is evil. Making them antagonist in seasons three and four. Their motives stay the same, but their role in the series changes.\n\nHowever despite my praise not all the characters are great. In fact the show can be kinda hit or miss with their cast. The characters that are great are really great, but then you get characters like...\n\n(Art by JelloApocolypse)\n\nYou know what, I have to be honest. I kinda like Pony Head. I know a lot of people say she's annoying and selfish and contributes next to nothing to the plot...and they're right. But I also just kinda like her. I think what makes her more bearable to me is that she's kinda disliked in-universe. Even Star, who is Pony Head's best friend, often times get sick of her crap. Real talk though, can we all agree that Pony Head is basically just a discount Lumpy Space Princess from Adventure Time? Like, they're nearly the exact same character.\n\nA character who I don't like as much though is Glossaryck, the magical spirit guide that lives in Star's spell book. I never really got his deal. Sometimes it seems like he likes Star and genuinely wants to help her become a better magic user, while other times it doesn't seem like he really cares. He dies in the beginning of season three only to come back a few episodes later acting like a wild animal and yelling \"Globgor\" over and over again without any explanation as to how or why. Than at the end of season three it's revealed that it was all an act and he was fine the whole time. Like...why? We later learn that is a highly recognized historical figure in Mewni. Why is he yelling his name? And why does nobody question why he's doing this? I can buy that Star and Marco might not know who Globgor is but most everybody else seems to. I keep expecting that moment for his motivations to click. Where it's revealed how everything he's done was all an elaborate ploy to help Star or something, but it never really happens. Though my opinion of him does slightly increase in season four, but that's just because Keith David took over the role of voice actor. And adding Keith David can make anything better.\n\nSome characters can even change in quality between seasons. Janna is this edgy punk girl who joins the main cast in season two as a new friend to Star and Marco. I liked her well enough in season two even if some of her more abrasive elements could be somewhat obnoxious. She's more or less absent for most of season three. Then come season four she returns and I found her more annoying. I don't know if her character got worse or if it was just the fact that her character didn't work as well in later episodes after the show had become more dramatic. But near the end of the season, they give her some long overdue character growth. Not a lot, but some. And I found myself liking her more.\n\nThere are other characters in the series as well, and they tend to vary. Star's mom, Moon is a BAMF and I like Buff Frog a lot. Jacki and Kelly are fine characters, though I admit there's not that much to them outside of being love interests for Marco, though they still have there own personalities. King River's kinda annoying but I've seen worse examples of the \"dumb dad\" trope and Alan Tudyk gives a great performance.\n\nAnd since I don't have time to go over my thoughts on EVER character in this series, I'll do what ever online review does when they don't have time for nuance. Create a tier list!\n\nIf It's not apparent by now, the characters in this show run the gambit. With the best ones being some of my favorite characters of all time, and the worse one's just being generally annoying. However, if there's one thing that this show excels at is not painting things as black and white. No character is evil without a reason and all the heroic characters have un-heroic flaws to their characters with unique motivations that make sense for their characters. (For the most part anyway.)\n\nThe shows animation is also really good. Featuring thick outlines and a lot of nice coloring on the characters. (Even if some of the background colors can be a bit drab at times.) Most of the first season is done in flash, but it's good flash, which does well to accentuate the character expressions and the fluid action scenes. Part way through season one though the show's animation changes to more traditional animation. I think there is a bit of a divide on which style people consider to be better, but I personally prefer the look of the later seasons. The bouncy look of the early season one episodes look good, but I don't know how well that would of worked in the more dramatic and somber moments that happen later on.\n\nI also appreciate the world building. The first two seasons are set mostly on Earth in the town of Echo Creek, but the last two seasons changes things up and focus much more on Mewni, allowing us to explore both settings. I know some people don't like the change as it resulted in several of the characters introduced earlier being written out of the show but I never really minded that. I think Mewni and the cast of characters who inhabit it are on the whole more interesting than the people of Echo Creek. (I mean does anybody really miss Sensei Brantley?) Plus the change in setting allows us to get a bit of a role reversal with Marco being the fish out of water, and Star having to show him how her world operates. And even if you do prefer the Earth setting we still cut back to it on occasion. And when you add it all up the total series runtime between the two setting is fairly evenly.\n\nI like how characters can kinda come and go in this series, as it shows that the world doesn't revolve around Star and Marco. And it allows the writers to see which characters people gravitate to and focus on them while keeping less interesting characters out of the way. It also allows for character arcs to actually have conclusions, without the need for them to be drawn out just for the sake of keeping characters around longer.\n\nLet's talk about themes for a moment. Specifically the main theme of prejudice and systemic racism in the show. It's handled...okay. It's kinda standard stuff and it doesn't go super complex on the issue, but for what it is it works though. That being said the show can be a bit confusing in terms of what counts as \"monsters\" and what are just regular races in this world. Which can make the metaphor a little muddled. I get that the idea is that there is no difference, and that monsters are only deemed as bad as an excuse for mewmans to justify their mistreatment of them, but it can still be confusing as to who's oppressed and who isn't and to what extent. I feel it would be even more confusing for a younger children watching who might not understand all the nuances of this stuff. However, the way the show tackles this isn't bad either. And the fact that the show tackles this element at all is admirable.\n\nBut who cares about systemic racism! That's not the real reason people are watching this show! We all know that everybody is really here for the shipping!\n\nYeah, as the series went on the shipping seems to become a much more major element within the series. So much so that to many the increased focus on the shipping is often cited as one of the main elements that caused the show to go down hill. However I never really minded it. I mean Star vs. has always been a bit of a love letter to the shojo/magical girl genre and romance is a very important element to those types of shows. So it makes sense that it would be used here. And I think it's used pretty well here overall. These are just kids struggling through these types of feelings for the first time, So it makes a lot of the stupid decisions that they make feel a lot more believable. But if this kind of thing isn't your cup of tea, it might end up bothering you. Because they do devote a good amount of time on it.\n\nBut you're probably wondering, who do I ship? Am I team Starco or team TomStar? And honestly, while shipping has never been something I've ever gotten too invested in, if I had to pick I would probably have to say team Starco. Which may be surprising as I previously went on and on about how Tom was one of my favorite characters of all time. But this is the way I see it. Tom's whole arc is about learning how to get over his jealousy and controlling nature regarding his relationship with Star. And it's shown that even after he's dating Star, and has everything he thought he wanted, he still couldn't fully get over his hangups. Even though he loves Star and Star loves him, it's clear that the relationship still isn't exactly the most healthy. And it's clear that they are going in different directions in their lives. Tom knows what he wants. To be with Star. But Star doesn't know what she wants. Not all relationships have to end because one person does something wrong or because one of the parties involved is a bad person. Sometimes two people just aren't compatible in that kind of way. And seeing Tom be the one to break up with Star shows just how far he's come as a character. Plus, like I said earlier, Star and Marco have great chemistry. And I do genuinely see them working as a romantic couple, beyond the fact that there the two main leads.\n\nBesides, StarTom is technically incest so....\n\n*record scratch!*\n\nOh wait, you didn't know about that.? Yeah, according to the official \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil Magic Book of Spells\" Star's Great Great Great Grandmother Rhina Butterfly was in a relationship with John Roachley, a second cousin to the Lucitor's. Now granted that would mean that Star and Tom aren't THAT related. But still. Incest none the less. Not that it even matters anyway since all of the Mewmans are descended from like five random people!\n\nSeriously, this is some Ishigami Village levels of incest we got going on here.\n\nBut despite how heated the flames wars can be, I think we can all agree that Tomco is the best ship anyway. Like come on now.\n\nSo yeah, even the shipping elements didn't bother me. To be completely honest, while the show did have some problems here or there, I found myself enjoying the show well into the fourth season. But I knew it was coming. Since I was watching the show months after the series had concluded, I had heard things about the finale. A finale that figuratively \"cleaved\" the fan base. But in order to talk about the finale we have to go a few episodes back and talk about the episodes leading up to it. Obviously spoilers ahead.\n\nTo briefly recap, at this point in the series Eclipsa had become Queen of Mewni along with her husband Globgor after Star relinquished the crown to her. And many of the Mewmans are upset by Eclipsa's new \"pro-monster\" policies had left to live with the former Queen Moon. Meanwhile Mina Loveberry, a legendary monster fighter from generations far gone, had begun building up an army to invade Eclipsa's castle and take Mewni back from the monsters. A lot of people I hear don't like Mina as a final villain, but honestly I was surprised by how threatening they were able to make her despite how goofy she is. And her backstory about basically being a magically altered super solider driven to the point of insanity really helped to make her sympathetic. (Like I said, in this show everyone is painted with shades of gray. Even genocidal lunatics.) She invades with a Solarian Knight, a giant magic powered mech and it takes all of our heroes working together to barely defeat it. Until it is revealed that it was only one of many. It's an amazing twist that really leaves you wondering \"How are or heroes going to get out of this one.\" Up to this point I was digging this final arc. But that's when I finally got to it.\n\nTo me, the moment where Star vs. the Forces of Evil got bad was the moment it was revealed that Moon was working with Mina to reclaim the thrown from Eclipsa.\n\nIt just doesn't fit Moons's character to do this. While it is shown throughout the season that Moon does not agree with Eclipsa more extreme policies, It was still shown that while Moon may be against Star's decision to give the crown to Eclipsa, she acknowledges that since Star was queen at the time and was within her right as queen to decide what was best for the kingdom. And in previous episodes she seemed generally happy not having the responsibility that comes with being queen anymore. But now she suddenly wants her kingdom back? If she wanted it back, all she had to do was say so from the start. At the start of the season most Mewmans still hate Eclipsa. It would not be that hard to stage a coup if she really wanted, especially since the magic high commission and all of Mewni would be on her side. Why would she work with Mina, who Moon knows is insane and racist even by Moons standard? Sure Moon and Eclipsa definitely don't see eye to eye on a lot of things but Moon still wouldn't want her dead, and Moon knows that Mina wants to kill her. I know she thought she could control Mina's army but that's still a big risk. It seems uncharacteristically reckless for a character as intelligent as Moon to make these choices.\n\nSo then, after it turns out that Moon can't control Mina's army, our heroes are basically screwed and are forced to hide out in a special tavern located at the edge of the universe to wait things out while Mina begins rounding up all the monsters in Mewni. They are all trying to figure out a plan on how to possibly defeat Mina's army when Star suddenly goes on a rant about how magic is bad. And this idea had been brought up a few times in the series, but overall had never really been portrayed as a major aspect. But suddenly the show treats this as if it's all the magics fault, and that everything would be better if it was gone. And that's when Star comes up with the genius plan to use go to the magic dimension to destroy all the magic. Thus making Mina's forces useless. And while I admit that yes, they are very much been pushed to a wall here, this has to be one of the most overkill ideas they could of possibly think of!\n\nNow, I've seen a lot of people online saying that by doing this, Star would be committing mass murder on a multiverse scale, potentially destroying many universes. And I think that is a bit of a reach. From what we see in the series, it seems to me at least that magic is kinda a rare thing in the universe. That's why so many villains are trying to steal the magic wand away from Star. And I see very little implying that there are whole universes that are reliant on magic outside of Mewni. THAT SAID THOUGH, this would result in the deaths of a lot of innocent people. But Star really only seems concerned with the fact that once magic is destroyed, all people who come from parallel universes will return to their home universe, meaning she won't be able to stay with Marco. Which makes Star seem beyond selfish and generally pretty horrible.\n\nHekapoo, one of the high commission members, despite being made of magic and knowing that she will die from this, is totally on board for this plan because plot. And our heroes travel to the magic dimension to destroy all the magic. Which they do. Defeating Mina's forces and leaving her powerless. She still manages to escape however because nobody decides to actually, you know, try to arrest the person who just committed a political coup and nearly whipped out an entire race. They just let her walk off, because she's powerless now. I mean what's the worse she could possibly do, right?\n\nSo yeah, Mina is defeated, but everybody is sent back to their home dimensions. But somehow, through the power of love I guess, the universes of Earth and Mewni begin to merge. Thus allowing Star and Marco to be together. Happy ending, I guess? I don't know. Like Star and Marco being together is treated as a good thing. But we also see humans screaming as there world have now been overrun by monsters. Is this suppose to be a joke? A bittersweet ending? I'm not really sure.\n\nIn concept the idea of a universe merge is actually a pretty interesting idea. As it feels like a natural progression of the shows themes of racial tolerance and mutual understanding. Now that we've gotten semi-tolerance between monsters and mewmans we could now have an arc about trying to bridge the cultural gaps between the humans and the mewmans. Plus it would be a good way to appease both the people who enjoyed the earlier seasons focus on Echo Creek, and fans of the later seasons who preferred the stories set on Mewni. It's not a bad idea, but it needed to A.) be set up better and B.) needed more time to be fleshed out. I get that it's designed to be a sequel hook, but it's not like this is something that the series had been building up to to the point where we the audience can put together what happens next. As is, it's just weird.\n\nSo yeah, the last couple of episodes of Star vs. where a total mess. It's fitting that the finale to Star happened to come out the same day as the finale of Game of Thrones. While I'm not going to act like there weren't some parts I liked or some good ideas sprinkled throughout, this finale was pretty bad. How do you have a show that preaches acceptance and equality and end it with a genocide?! But hey, genocidal problems call for genocidal solutions am I right?\n\nMy God, It's Dragon Ball Super all over again.\n\nAnd the worse part is that the series didn't have to end this way. Cause the show actually had a pretty good episode about half way through the season, \"Cornonation\" which would of acted as a great series finale! With the series ending with Eclipsa as Queen and ruling with Globgor by her side, with the mewmans finally accepting monster kind. You'd have to change a few things, like rap up Mina's plot and put Star and Marco together, but other than that it could of really worked. Admirably it may end up feeling more like a finale for Mewne as oppose to a finale for Star but it would thematically fit with the message of the series. Or if you really wanna keep this finale more in tack just don't have Star destroy the magic. Just have Star, Moon, and Eclipsa go off and do the one thing the three of them had never tried doing. Working together. And have them defeat Mina the old fashion way. They even allude to this idea in the tavern episode before Star goes on her whole \"We gotta destroy the magic\" kick.\n\nIt is a bit ironic to think that a show that's whole message is about unity could end up being so divisive with it audience. I genuinely believe that had the show ended on a better note, people would look back on the show more fondly. Despite the flaws. To the people who don't like Star vs. The Forces of Evil, I can understand where you are coming from. Even if you ignore the finale there are things to not like. A lot of things aren't very well explained and the show has its fair bit of plot holes. The series can be repetitive with its frequent shipping and \"racism is bad\" episodes. And some of the characters can be a bit annoying, including our main lead at times.\n\nThat being said though, I have to say, I can't bring myself to hate this show.\n\nI don't know what it is, but I just found myself getting really invested into this series. Maybe it was due to me hearing so much bad things about the later seasons that I had low expectations, and while that may be part of it I don't think that's the whole reason. When you watch as many cartoons as I have, and for as long as I have, it becomes harder for things to impress you. Sometimes it can feel like your just checking shows off of a box, which is something that I've been trying to improve upon. But watching this show, it brought me back to the way I felt back in the early 2010's when I first started getting into these types of series. For all of Star's flaws, and trust me there are many flaws, it felt like it was doing something unique. Like it was in it's own little world that wasn't quiet Adventure Time and not quiet Steven Universe. And the series stuck with me after I finished watching it, which is surprisingly kinda rare. It's why I became interested in doing this review in the first place.\n\nStar vs. the Forces of Evil is a flawed show. Very flawed. But I'd rather have a flawed show that's unique than a perfect show that's something I've seen a million times. And while I may not be a fan of how it ended, I don't think that should completely take away from all the good that this show has to offer. This show isn't going to be for everybody, and If you somehow made it this far into the review without seeing the show than I hope I've said enough to help you figure out if this show is right for you. But for me, despite everything, the series still has it's magic.\n\nWhat did you think of Star vs. the Forces of Evil? I really genuinely want to know on this one. Did it go downhill and if so than when? Leave those thoughts in the comments down bellow. Please fav, follow, and comment if you liked the review. And have a great day.\n\nRed vs Blue REVIEW: (With RacoonnBroVA)\n\nHello everybody, my name is JoyofCrimeArt. I know I talk about them a lot but it still never ceases to amaze me how much of a juggernaut Rooster Teeth has become. And this year has been huge for them. RWBY’s _gotten an official Shonen Jump manga series that’s fans seem to be loving, and a comic book by DC on the way. And _Gen:LOCK’s also proven pretty successful, having recently been acquired by _[adult swim] _to air on _Toonami! _That’s such a huge step for not just Rooster Teeth but web animation as a medium. Man, it’s like there’s nowhere for Rooster Teeth to go but up-\n\n_ … Tucker did it. _\n\nBut yes, with all the success and controversy Rooster Teeth has gotten over the years, it can be hard to remember just how it all started. Before they were the massive entertainment company we know today, Rooster Teeth started out from humble beginnings. As five guys just making fun of video games. And while _RWBY _might of been the series that launched the company into the relevance it has now, it may not have even made it off the ground if it wasn’t for a little series called Red vs Blue.\n\n_**Knock! Knock! Knock!\n\n**_\n\nWhat? A knock? How is there a knock in a review?\n\nOh, right! I forgot I installed that window in the middle of this never ending black void that I’ve found myself living in. I wonder who it is?\n\n_What? RaccoonBroVA from RaccoonBroVA at Deviantart.com? AND THEY SAID INFINITY WAR WAS THE MOST AMBITIOUS CROSSOVER OF ALL TIME! _\n\n**Yes, it is I you fools! I’m here to talk about my favorite web series of all time, and I’ve got a boner for murder to prove it. Thanks for having me on the review man!****\n\n**\n\nNo problem, man.\n\n** How easy it is to forget the phenomenon that truly put Rooster Teeth on the road to success. RWBY may have brought RT mainstream attention, but RvB laid the groundwork. Even better, this show is actually good!**\n\nMan, it just hit me that Rooster Teeth seems to have a thing with naming there shows after colors don’t they? Any who, let’s dive right into Red vs Blue. Also, given that this is a continuity driven show, we’ll be trying not to spoil anything major events that occurs. As a way to encourage you all to check the series out for yourself.\n\nRed vs Blue is a machinima series created by Burnie Burns that began running in 2003 and is still running to this day. Making it the second longest running web series of all time. Machinima, for those who are unaware, is basically the practice of creating animations using re-purposed video game footage. Think of it like the precursor to those source film maker videos you see all the time on Youtube. Machinma was fairly popular in the early internet days, and Red vs Blue stood atop as the most popular series to implement this animation style. Using footage from and being loosely set within the universe of the Halo _video game series. Luckily though, the series manages to act as it’s own completely self contained narrative that even a casual gamer scrub such as myself was able to follow despite never having played _Halo. Though from what I can tell, if you are familiar with _Halo _franchise there are a few nods and references that I imagine would add to the experience.\n\nThe plot of Red vs Blue, at least in it’s early days, is about as simple as they come. It’s a parody of Halo and follows two teams of soldiers stuck in an unending stalemate in the middle of a boxed canyon. Most of the run time is spent with characters standing around and talking, something this show has lampshaded multiple times. But as the series progresses we keep getting new characters, settings, stakes, and even gasp plot! Surprisingly complex plot at that.\n\n** **That’s honestly one of my favorite elements about the series. The tone is all over the place, yet somehow never ends up feeling jarring. The series starts out as a pure comedy with parody elements but as time goes on it gains a more serious tone. Adding in elements of action, drama, and genuine sci-fi adventure. But even as the show becomes more serious it never loses the original comedic elements that the show had in the beginning. Creating a tone that is really hard to describe, but manages to feel really unique. I don’t think it can really be compared to anything else that I’ve seen at least. The series is divided into six sagas. “The Blood Gulch Chronicles.” “Recollection.” “Project Freelancer.” “Anthology” “The Chorus Trilogy” and “The Shisno Paradox.” While each season has it’s own separate story and tone, none of them feel out of place. (Well mostly…we’ll get to that later.) They’re all linked together with a common theme about learning to let go of your past, and not letting it define who you are. A theme that really resonated with me on a personal level. But story and tone is one thing, how are the actual characters?\n\nOn one side of the canyon we have the Blue Team, unofficially lead by Leonard Church. The sarcastic, cynical, loud mouth jerk of the group. He’s acts as the straight man for the Blue team, due to him being SLIGHTLY more level headed than his peers (Though even calling him competent would be a stretch.) There’s also Private Tucker, Blue Teams second in command and hotblooded wannabe ladies man. And finally there’s Caboose, the lovable idiot with a habit of befriending non human entities. He acts as not only the comedic relief but also the heart of the series.\n\n** On the other side of our quaint little canyon is the Red Team. They’re led by Sarge, a war obsessed zealot who loves yelling at his subordinates and killing Blues. Simmons acts as second in command and never misses an opportunity to brown nose. Griff is a lazy slob who would rather be anywhere but here. Donut is a new recruit who progressively gets more and more… let’s say flamboyant whenever he’s onscreen. And Lopez, a cynical, deadpan robot who can only speak Spanish. Get used to that joke.**\n\n** And that’s not even mentioning the several other miscellaneous characters. Like Doc, a purple clad medic who works on both sides and devotion to pacifism makes him be seen as a liability by both sides. **\n\n**O’Malley, a dangerous AI who is bound to Doc most of the time and is essentially a Saturday morning cartoon villain from the way he talks to his plans of taking over the world with a weather machine. **\n\n**Tex is a badass freelancer who gets hired by the Blues and even used to date Church. Since Church is an asshole, it’d make sense that his ex is a bitch. But hey, bitch is the new black as they say. **\n\nThere’s also the freelancer’s Washington and Carolina introduced in “Recollection” and “Freelancer” respectively. Both are these cold calculated soldiers of questionable morality who act in complete contrast to the incompetent Reds and Blues. As time goes on though they become more and more involved in the story till they are basically main characters with their own struggles and character arcs.\n\nMany of the characters at first don’t start out seeming like much. And for a while they seem pretty one dimensional. And I do admit, the series is pretty slow paced when it comes to character growth. It takes several seasons before the characters really start to change in any meaningful way. But as the series goes on they really do become very well defined and developed characters with their own individual arcs. From Church’s arc of learning to let go. Tucker and Donuts arc of learning to step up and become real leaders when situations force them to. Caboose learning to accept misfortune and move on from it. Washington and Carolina learning to open up to each other. Grif learning to actually care about the comrades he use to hate. Simmons and Sarge…okay they don’t really get as much development. But we love them anyway.\n\n** And as I’m sure many of you won’t be surprised by this, it’s time for me, RaccoonBroVA, to talk about the voice acting.**\n\nThis is the part of the show that keeps me coming back no matter what kind of lows the series hits. For most cartoons, a lot goes into making each character expressive and distinct from the rest of the cast. It takes facial expressions, personality, designs, and voices all working in tandem. But Red vs Blue doesn’t have this luxury. Because everything is in machinima, everyone looks essentially the same model wise (with a couple exceptions like Carolina and Caboose who have unique armor). This means that the only reason we’re able to identify with these characters at all is through their voices.\n\n** Considering how little actually happened in the first few seasons other than just talking about the plot, Red vs Blue could honestly be a radio play and lose very little when it comes to presentation. With all that being said, you’d think Red vs Blue would be a really boring a** show. Well, it isn’t now thanks to the colorful cast behind the helmets! With all these limitations, each and every actor is required to put as much as they can into each character to make sure we can immediately identify anyone at any given moment. And with so many characters, you’d think this would be impossible.**\n\n** Nope! Every character has a distinct voice that illustrates everything we need to know about who they are. Caboose’s slow pace and odd articulations shows us how stupid he is. Simmons’ nasal shows what a big nerd he is. Sarge’s rasp and tendency to yell is perfect for his over the top method of combat. And so on and so forth. The voices are so distinct to the point where we associate each Halo color with their respective characters. Hearing Church’s voice come out of a red player model would be distracting to say the least.**\n\n** Even during dramatic scenes where the camera closes in on a character’s non existent face, I still get hit with the feels because of how impressive everyone’s acting chops are. The crappy mic quality doesn’t even distract me at this point. Oh yeah, that’s another example of this show working with its weaknesses. The guys are in a war, everyone’s always wearing their helmets, so let’s just say our bad microphones are the characters using their radio headsets. What more can I say about this show’s handling of the voiceover work? It’s nothing short of ingenious in my humble opinion.**\n\nThe comedy of Red vs Blue is also something that I want to hit on. This show is one of the funniest series I have ever seen. And that’s not something I say lightly. The show’s comedy relies on a lot of sharp, witty, dialogue based humor with several running jokes and call backs. Most of the show is just people standing around talking, which you’d think would get stale, but it never does. The characters are distinct enough that just seeing them bounce off of each other is all the fun you need.\n\nEven several centuries from now, this show will still be as funny as it was when it first came out. There’s a reason marketing posters for each character is filled to the brim with memorable quotes from the show. This approach to comedy even applies to exposition. For example, when we learn about how these two teams have been in the middle of a boxed canyon for years, we aren’t just given boring exposition. We also learn about each of the characters’ personalities and how they interact, while also getting some really funny jokes. Red vs Blue found a way to make exposition entertaining people! This show’s comedy lives and dies by the flawless chemistry between each team.\n\nExactly. I believe this dialogue heavy style of comedy was birthed from necessity. With such a limited budget early on and being confined mostly to the Halo engine, you are limited in terms of what you can do with the animation. So the best way around these limitations is to have a more dialogue centric approach that doesn’t rely so heavily on it. This style of comedy was really big in the early 2000’s with not only a lot of web series but with some lower budget main stream shows like Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Space Ghost Coast to Coast. This style of comedy is something I really gravitate to, as it has more of a chill vibe to it. Watching Red vs Blue now gives off a bit of a retro feel, as its comedy still feels the same way as it did in 2003 even all these years later.\n\nSpeaking of which, let’s talk about the animation. Animation is hard to talk about when it comes to something like a machinima cause the series is limited to whatever game it’s using footage from. The earlier seasons that use footage from Halo 1 and 2 obviously look kinda dated. However newer seasons that use footage from Halo’s 3, 4, and 5 obviously look a lot better. But what Red vs. Blue has over other machinima series is that it also incorporates action scenes using motion capture. With fights in the Recollection and Freelancer sagas being animated by this little known name in the animation circle known simply as…Monty Oum. Not sure if you heard of him. He created and animated the fights in RWBY. He’s basically the John Wu of web animation. Fun fact, his work on Red vs Blue is actually what got him his job on RWBY in the first place. His animations are just as off the wall insane in Red vs Blue as they are in _RWBY, _only mixed in with Red vs Blue’s comedy.\n\nLet’s also not forget his other works that put him on the map like ****Haloid and Dead Fantasy. What puts his style of action above so many others is the way he uses any environment to its max potential. Having a fight in a warehouse? Let’s incorporate anything and everything that could be in there from teleporters to rocket launchers. A fight in the tundra? Let’s throw in some bombs so that we can showcase the characters jumping from one falling rock to another Bayonetta style. A fight on the highway? Please, that practically writes itself.\n\nAs the show entered the Chorus Trilogy Monty left to go work on _RWBY _and the fight scenes became a lot more grounded in reality. A lot of people say that this is a downgrade, and while these fights aren’t as impressive as the ones that Monty could do, I feel the more grounded actions fits well with the tone the Chorus Trilogy was going for. And there is an in-universe explanation for why people aren’t dropping literal skyscrapers on each other anymore, so I don’t mind the change.\n\n** I agree. And it’s not like we haven’t gotten impressive fights since Monty left. Carolina and Wash vs the mercenaries, Doc vs Donut, any fight from season 14, etc. At the end of the day though, even if you don’t like the new fights as much, it doesn’t really matter because Red vs Blue, at it’s core, has never really been a show about over the top action. Even during the more complex story driven seasons, RvB has never lost what it was, and will always be at it’s purest core. A dialogue heavy character driven tale that came about from humble beginnings. I’ve always seen the action as merely a bonus feature.**\n\nPlus the mocap isn’t just used for fight scenes. It’s also used to allow for more character expression and movement for both sentimental and comedic scenes. As well as allowing characters to do things that they could never do in the _Halo _engine. It honestly looks pretty good. They even have some characters who are animated entirely in house without any use of the game engine and it looks-\n\n_OH GOD! THEY FLEW TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN! WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY’S VERSION OF ALFRED HITCHOCK MIXED WITH GRU FROM DESPICABLE ME?…AND THAN MICROWAVED? _\n\n** Let’s all be glad that this was merely a phase and that later seasons stuck with the good ol’ fashioned Mjolnir Powered Assault Armor V. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. The day we see any of the Red or Blue teams’ faces will be the end of the show. And also probably the internet.**\n\nThe nightmarish old man jowls aren’t the shows only problem though. Like everything, Red vs Blue has it’s fair share of flaws and nitpicks that are worth discussing. As mentioned earlier the audio quality and some of the animation early on was pretty rough. It’s excusable given the time it came out, so it’s kinda hard to judge it, but it does make binging the earlier seasons a little awkward to say the least.\n\nThis is an understandable curse when it comes to any show on the internet from that time period. Back in those days, people didn’t care as much about trying to be cutting edge or hopping on trends to gain popularity. It was normally just independent artists with an idea who just wanted to have fun. It’s how Arin Hanson and Eddsworld got so popular, and both of those creators have plenty of works that are a little hard to watch as well. But honestly, that’s kind of the charm if you ask me. That being said, seeing how far this show has come while still maintaining it’s roots is beyond admirable.\n\nThe show has some issues with pacing. Some elements and story lines feel like they can kinda be retreaded. It’s kinda hard to explain without going to spoilers though. Admittedly they are done in new ways but a lot of the time, but it sometimes feels like we see the characters come to the same realization several times before it sinks in. Also, the show often feels like it’s padding for time a lot with lots of filler that contributes next to nothing to the overarching story. (Like remember that time Simmons joined Blue Team? Or that other time Simmons joined Blue Team?) However, this isn’t that much of a problem because the characters are enjoyable enough that even the filler is enjoyable.\n\nThe show also has an issue when it comes to character focus. The Blue Team is given a lot more character growth and straight up just things to do while the Red Team is mostly comedic with only bits of character growth sprinkled here and there. I know their reason for doing this is probably to try to balance the comedy and drama, but I feel like it does hurt the characters of Red Team in a bit. And GOD help you if your favorite character is Donut, or ESPECIALLY Doc and Lopez. The show seems to go out of it’s way to write these three out of the show whenever they have the opportunity. However, I will say that the “Shisno Paradox” saga has done a lot to balance out the screen time of a lot of the characters. Giving a lot of members of Red Team, especially Donut, some much needed and deserved screen time.** **\n\n**_ _ I’ll be the first to admit that those are all valid points indeed. When you have so many characters, it’s only natural that some are gonna get more screen time than others. It all comes down to what the writers feel works best, and for the most part I believe it’s worked out. True, the Red team doesn’t get as much important screen time as the Blues, but not only has this been lampshaded a couple times, it’s not like the Reds could be written out of the story entirely. All these characters are so entertaining, and the show wouldn’t be the same without them. It’d be like cutting the other spider people from Into the Spiderverse. Sure, they don’t get that much development or screen time, but they also bring their own style of humor and emotion to the table, and it’s part of why that movie is so beloved. **\n\nAs for characters getting slow development, I chalk that up to the art of the flat character arc. This is when you have a character who changes very little throughout the run time of a story. That way writers need not focus on how much the characters can change, but instead on how said character can react to or change the world around them. For example, Wash and Carolina receive the most development in this series. But they only go through these changes after having met the Reds and Blues. Same goes for other characters like the inhabitants of Chorus. There are subtle changes, such as Sarge being more open to working with the Blues and Tucker becoming a leader, but at the end of the day these are still the same characters we remember back in ‘03 days. And for a show that has gone on as long as Red vs Blue, the flat character arc is imperative in keeping the audience’s interest and making sure these characters don’t become stale.\n\nThere’s also “The Shisno Paradox.” I’ll try to explain the best I can without going into spoilers. Basically, the Chorus Trilogy ended on the perfect note for Red vs Blue to possibly end on. Then they did a season of anthology shorts which was sorta hit or miss, but there were still more good than bad in my personal opinion. But then the show came back with a new story driven season and the show really started to go down hill. The show wasn’t bad per say, there were still a lot of good elements to it. Like I said earlier, the new seasons had a much more even balance between Red and Blue Team, as well as some fan favorite minor characters making a return. The comedy was still VERY on point, with some of my personal favorite comedic scenes being from the saga. But some things about the seasons just felt…off to me.\n\nThe characters felt like they had regressed from where they were previously. The story took on this much larger and grander scope that felt like too much of an escalation compared to the smaller, more personal plots of seasons prior. And the new characters that where introduced were mostly either forgettable at best or annoying at worse. The seasons weren’t bad per say. They just weren’t as good as they were before. I think part of the problem is a lack of direction. With most of the earlier plot points wrapped up and no end it sight for the series the show doesn’t feel like it has any firm direction to go. I don’t wanna be to harsh, cause there are good elements, but if the series has ended after Chorus or Anthology Red vs Blue could of been one of those rare shows to end at their high point.\n\n** And this is exactly the trap I was talking about that the show managed to escape for such a long time. But due to the nature of the ending of season 13, the writers wrote themselves into a corner. How can you possibly follow up an ending like THAT?! So the only thing they could do was essentially start from scratch and introduce more characters so that the Reds and Blues could have something to do. Most of them were indeed hit or miss. **\n\n** However, that doesn’t even come close to season 16. Hot damn was this one stupid. I’m not gonna spoil anything, but here’s the gist of it. The plot device they went with is one that any writer can tell you will always end in anguish. Most of my favorite characters felt like they were being written by different people. The humor felt more childish than usual. And probably most of all was that it didn’t feel like Red vs Blue anymore. Because Rooster Teeth has a bigger budget now, they feel the need to push the boundaries of how RvB can present it’s stories. What makes Red vs Blue so charming is how they’re able to tell such investing stories with so little resources. Limitation breeds creativity after all. But by making all these new environments and broadening the scope somehow beyond space, the show lost it’s identity. And that’s the biggest sin any long running show can commit.**\n\nHowever, both of the new show runners in charge of the newer seasons have seemed pretty open to the criticism they’ve received. The newest season honestly wasn’t that bad on it’s own. So maybe the show will be able to find it’s footing again. Only time will tell.\n\nHowever, none of these flaws I mentioned can take away from all the good that Red vs Blue has to offer. This series was a lot better than what I was expecting it to be when I started watching it. And it ended up becoming one of my personal favorite series. The comedy and drama are on point while balancing each other out. The characters are memorable. And the themes are strong. Sure it has it’s flaws, but that can be said for any show. I highly recommend you check Red vs Blue out for yourself if the show sounds at all appealing to you. I know the archive panic can turn some people off, but it’s a series that’s worth diving into. RaccoonBro, you have any parting words?\n\nI feel like I ended on a bit of a bummer note there, so allow me to bring the positive mood back before we sign off. Red vs Blue is not only my favorite web series, but it’s also one of my favorite shows period. Definitely in the top 10 or even 5. The characters are all memorable and distinct despite literally just being generic video game avatars. The voice acting has so much personality, and all the emotions feels raw and real. The dialogue is intelligent and has near-perfect pacing. There’s a reason we still quote lines from this show 16 years later. But what I love most about this show is just how humble it feels. Everything is taken straight from the games, and even the animated segments take some inspiration from Halo. It’s so damn fascinating to see how much this team was able to create with so little to work with. I may have been harsh on season 16, but that’s one season out of many. Season 17 even managed to fix a bunch of the gripes I had by bringing back the focus of the story to the characters themselves as opposed to how ‘epic’ the story is. I don’t care if you call it a space opera or a cheap hangout between buddies. To me, at the end of the day, it will always be a quaint tale no one saw coming about some lovable charac****ters who stand around and talk all day. At least, that’s the reason I’m here.\n\nVery well said. Now get out of my house before I call the cops. ** **\n\n_ Budda bup budda bye!_\n\nThe whole series can be watched on RoosterTeeth.com and Youtube has all but the most recent season. The first thirteen seasons can also be streamed on Netflix, formatted to play like thirteen long movies.\n\n** Also, if you’re watching the show on Netflix, make sure to also go to the RvB YouTube page so you can catch some miniseries that have significance to the plot. Why they’re by themselves, I honestly can’t tell ya.**\n\nI SAID GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!\n\nSo that’s our thoughts on Red vs Blue. If you have any thoughts or opinions we’d love to hear about them in the comments down bellow and get a conversation going. Make sure you check out RaccoonBroVA’s page to if you are so inclined. He’s a good review and voice actor and I think you’ll like what he had to offer.

But a foolish Saiyan warrior, wielding a giant sword, step forth to oppose me. Before the final blow was struck he tore open a portal in time, and ran away from the future, where my evil was LAW! Now the fool seeks to return to the past, and undo the future that is Zamasu!\n\nGotta get back. Back to the past, stop Goku Black. Wa-Watch Out!~\n\nHello everybody, my name is JoyofCrimeArt, and it’s been…a while since I talked about Dragon Ball Super. Long enough that my plan to review the arcs as the English dub comes out are pretty much dead. But I’m here now, and ready to review the next chapter in the Dragon Ball saga, the “Future Trunks” arc. Which honestly, is a stupid name cause we already had a “Future Trunks” arc. It was called the Android and Cell saga. Why didn’t they just call it the “Goku Black” arc? But whatever. With each arc in Super surpassing that previous one up to this point, will this arc be able to continue the trend? That’s what I’m here find out. Also, given that this arc is a bit longer than the previous ones, I’m going to skim over or abbrev certain things for the sake of time. (Trust me, when we get to the Universe Survival Arc you’ll be glad I’m doing this.) But with all that said, let’s dive in.\n\nThe arc begins in Future Trunk’s timeline years after he defeated the androids. And…things are somehow even worse. That’s right, there world has had TWO apocalypses in the span of about thirty years or so. The few remnants of humanity have been forced into hiding as a small resistant stands to fight against this new threat. This resistance, consisting of Future Trunks, Future Bulma, and a future version of Mai of all characters, has one mission in mind. Rebuild the time machine and travel back in time to get help from the past, to help them stop this new enemy. And who is this new enemy? It’s none other than Goku. Or at least, an evil villain impersonating Goku, known as Goku Black. A name that probably sounds a lot better in Japan than it does in a country that has with a sizable black minority, like America.\n\n…Big oof.\n\nBut let’s talk about Goku Black for a minute. Now, the idea of making a character that’s designed to be an evil Goku isn’t really anything new. (I mean look at Turles.) However what makes Goku Black, and this whole arc in general, really stand out is the mystery aspect. The whole first half of this arc is all about figuring out who, or what, Goku Black really is and where he came from? And they’re are clues hidden thought that hint towards a larger picture. While Goku Black sounds like Goku, even being played by Sean Schemmel, his cadence is nothing like Goku. His speech is more polite and flowery. Also he refers to Trunks as “mortal” and even “Saiyan” at several points, implying that he is none of those things. It opens questions and allows the audience to speculate. And speaking of voice, Sean Schemmel does an amazing job voicing Black in the dub. Managing to make it sound like Goku while also making it feel distinctly it’s own thing. It’s a really great performance.\n\nJust as Trunks, Mai, and Bulma are about to finish the time machine, Black shows up and attacks. He kills Bulma and injures Mai, but Trunks is just barley able to escape. And while all of this is going on we keep cutting back to wacky hijinks in the present timeline. Things like the Pilaf Gang in school and Goku and Piccolo harvesting lettuces…which really clashes with the incredibly dower tone of what’s going on in Trunk’s timeline. Regardless, Trunk’s time machine arrives in Bulma’s yard. However, they’re not in the clear yet as Goku Black was able to follow them back, briefly, using a magical object known as a time ring.\n\nGoku goes and battles Black. The fight is pretty one sided with Goku holding back, not going beyond Super Saiyan so he can gauge Black’s power and have a good fight. I want you all to remember this, as everything bad that happens in the rest of this arc wouldn’t have happened if Goku had just gone all out on Black from the beginning. After a bit of a brawl Black’s time ring flings him back to the future. But not before he’s able to damage the time machine. Whis notes that the time ring gives the wearers ability to travel between timelines, and are only meant to be worn by Supreme Kais. Not only that but Black’s energy feels remarkably similar to a Supreme Kai in training that exist in universe ten. So with this lead Goku, Whis, and Beerus head off to universe ten, leaving Trunks to explore the present.\n\nWhen this arc was first announced, I have to admit I wasn’t really looking forward to it. It felt like it was just going to be a rehash of the Android and Cell arcs, with Trunks going back in time to stop another apocalypse. personally, I was fine with the idea of never seeing Future Trunks again, as it felt like his story was over. However, what kinda turned me around on this is all of these neat little interactions that we get to see, which we could only get by having Trunks travel to the “Super” era of the Dragon Ball timeline.\n\nOne of these great interactions is between Trunks and Kid Trunks. Kid Trunks forms this almost sibling-esq rivalry with his future self, which is honestly pretty fun to see. And we get the most elaborate two person love triangle ever devised. You see Kid Trunks has a crush on Mai, who’s actually a forty year old woman trapped in a child’s body. (But Kid Trunks doesn’t know this.) Mai, being an adult mentally, has a crush on Future Trunks. Meanwhile, Future Trunks has a thing for Future Mai, who’s is actually a middle aged woman trapped in a young adult body. So…\n\nWe also get to see interactions like Trunks learning that Krillin married Android 18. As well as Trunks getting to meet adult Gohan. Now keep in mind, the last time Trunks saw Gohan he just unlocked Super Saiyan Two and had just completely decimated Cell. And this is what he sees when he meets him here.\n\nLet me explain why this image is the best scene ever. We got Trunks on the left, representing all the Gohan fans out there. We got Videl being all like _“MAI BAE!” _And then we have Mr. Satan who just looks like he’s completely high on Quaaludes and is just here for the ride.\n\nMeanwhile, Goku arrives in universe ten they meet the universes Supreme Kai, Gowasu, along with his apprentice Zamasu. Zamasu was the former North Kai of universe ten, and is now being trained to take up the role of Supreme Kai when Gowasu eventually dies. Whis senses that Zamasu’s energy feels very similar to Black’s, but they don’t wanna tip there hand just yet. So Goku challenges Zamasu to a friendly fight to see if they’re fighting styles are similar, without telling him about Black. Zamasu is hesitant to battle a mere mortal, but he complies.\n\nNow let’s talk about Zamasu. I’ll be honest, one of the main reasons for me doing these Dragon Ball Super retrospects in the first place was just so I could have an excuse to talk about/make fun of Zamasu. Zamasu is great, and let me tell you why. Zamasu is very different from other Kai’s in a multitude of ways. Unlike the generally peaceful Kais, Zamasu has a massive disdain for mortals. He believing that they are sinful by nature, and only cause destruction. As such. he also believes that the Kai’s should take on a more hands on approach to running the universe. When you really look at it, He’s not wrong in his assumptions. The Kai’s are pretty useless in general, and it seems like SOMETHING’S always putting the universe in danger every other week or so. So his way of thinking comes from a fairly rational place.\n\nThat being said though, it’s pretty clear from the beginning that something isn’t right with Zamasu. While he doesn’t seem outright evil, he definitely doesn’t seem nice either. And given the fact that he is the only suspect in the Goku Black mystery (and the fact that he is featured so prominently in the arcs theme song.) It’s pretty clear that he is involved in one way or whatever. Usually something like this would ruin the mystery, but it actually works here. We know Zamasu is somehow tied in with Goku Black and is probably up to no good, but we don’t know exactly how. The mystery is less about finding out WHO the culprit is is as it is figuring out HOW the culprit is committing the crime, and finding proof. It’s also a refreshing change of paste to have a villain with somewhat noble intentions, at least at the start. Most antagonist in this franchise are just evil from the start for no real reason, but it’s nice seeing a characters decent into darkness. But it’s not the motivation or the mystery that makes me love Zamasu as a character. _I LOVE HIM BECAUSE HE’S SUCH A FRICKIN’ EDGE LORD! AND THE SHOW ACKNOWLEDGES IT! _Zamasu is that emo kid who thinks he knows everything about the world and believes that he is above it all. “Cause he isn’t blinded like the other idiotic mass! He’s deep man!” And it’s just to great!\n\nZamasu is voiced by James Marster. At first I didn’t really like the voice, as it sounded a lot older than what I was expecting. But it really grew on me as time went on. James Marster has been a massive Dragon Ball fan for much of his life. Even agreeing to play Piccolo in the Dragon Ball Evolution movie. So to see him get a chance to finally be in a piece of Dragon Ball medium that’s actually…good. He does a really stellar job, capturing the pompousness and the insanity of the character really well. His performance is one of the arcs highlights.\n\nZamasu fights Goku and Goku is able to beat him in his Super Saiyan 2 form. Zamasu is disgusted that he was beaten by a mortal, and silently swears revenge on Goku for besting him. However, Goku isn’t able to make any firm connections between him and Goku Black. So he, Beerus and Whis head back to Earth.\n\nWith Trunk’s time machine was destroyed Bulma and the Pilaf gang began working on repairing Cell’s old time machine from all the way back in the Cell saga, which Bulma had kept in capsule form for all these years. As they wait for the time machine to be prepared it allows Trunks and Vegeta to do some good old father-son bonding.\n\n_See everybody, Vegeta’s great at helping people as long as he can do it by punching and threatening them!\n\n_ While all that’s going on Beerus and Whis get a message from none other than the Omni-King himself. And for some reason, he wants to see Goku. The two are obviously worried as Zeno is capable of whipping out entire universe in an instant and Goku…is Goku. But with no real option Goku, Whis, and the Supreme Kai head off to Zeno’s palace to see what he wants. They are greeted by Zeno’s Grand Priest, who Whis confirms is one of the five strongest people in the multiverse. He leads them down to Zeno’s throne room where Zeno tells Goku what he wants. He wants a friend.\n\nThe gods are shocked, but really it makes sense. Zeno is just a little kid, and it must get lonely at the top. All the other deities fear the Omni-King due to the sheer amount of destructive power that he possesses. But Goku is the only one who’s ever treated Zeno like an actual person, due to just how kind and thick headed he is. This lack of hesitation has earned him the Omni-Kings respect. Goku tells Zeno that he can’t play with him right now, since he’s a bit preoccupied at the moment. But he says that when he’s done, he’ll find Zeno a friend that’s even better than he is. Zeno agrees and gives Goku a button that can summon him directly once Goku finds this friend. Goku puts this very obvious Checkov’s gun in his pocket for latter and arrives on Earth just as Bulma is finishing the time machine.\n\nNow that it is fixed, Goku, Vegeta, and Trunks hop in the machine to face Black head on. They arrive and find they’re way to the resistance HQ, where Trunks is reunited with the Future Mai. But it doesn’t take long for them to encounter Goku Black, who through a combination of zenkai boost, and getting a better handle on Goku’s body, is much stronger than he was during his first encounter with Goku. He’s even able to transform into his own twisted version of Super Saiyan Blue known as Super Saiyan Rose.\n\nVegeta, ready to beat up anyone who looks like Goku, attacks Black. And as we know, every time Vegeta fights the arc’s main antagonist, it-it usually goes really well for him, so we shouldn’t have anything to worry about-\n\n_VEGETA! You’re suppose to learn from your past mistakes! _\n\nAnd if all that wasn’t bad enough, a time portal opens up in the sky revealing Zamasu. Or at least, a future version of Zamasu with potara and a time ring. That’s right, Zamasu isn’t Black, he’s working with Black. (Or so it seems at least.) The three try to battle the duo in a really well done fight scene, but they notice something about this version of Zamasu. No matter how much damage they inflict on him, he just heals from it seconds after. He’s somehow invincible. This, coupled with Goku Black’s new power, is simply to much for our heroes to handle. Luckily, they’re able to just barley about the escape in the time machine in the nick of time due to Mai distracting Zamasu and Black.\n\nMeanwhile, the present version of Zamasu is becoming more and more fascinated with Goku. Gowasu is as well, and even does some research on him on Godtube. The actual thing that actually exist in this universe and is an important plot point. That’s right, apparently the entire Universe Six tournament was actually live streamed this entire time!. Though I can’t speak to the validity of Godtube as a platform. Heard they’re copyright system is pretty bad.\n\nDang it, Toei!\n\nZamasu see’s Super Saiyan Blue Goku’s fight with Hit and is furious that a mortal like Goku is able to achieve such Godly powers. And it’s at this point that you realize that Zamasu is really just the Frank Grimes of the Dragon Ball franchise. And Goku is _Homer. And I’m okay with that…\n\n_But this is where Zamasu learns about the Super Dragon Balls. He goes to Zuno (The all knowing alien from the last arc.) and demands information from him. And this is where Zamasu comes up with his plan. He’ll use the Super Dragon Balls to swap bodies with Goku, than use the time rings to travel to a different timeline, and team up with a parallel version of himself. Then THAT Zamasu will use the Super Dragon Balls in order to wish for immortality. Than they will begin they’re plan to whip out all mortal life from the multiverse. Convoluted enough? But hey, at least unlike other villains he plans on wishing for immortality BEFORE engaging our heroes.\n\nBut before he can do this, he needs to kill Gowasu first. As only a Supreme Kai can use the time rings. Goku, Whis, and Beerus begin to figure out this plan. (They figure parts of it out later, but I’m abbreviating this for the sake on length.) They travel to the tenth universe and catch Zamasu in the act of murdering Gowasu, but Whis uses his time rewind powers to save him. It’s honestly a clever and unexpected twist. Seeing the ability again here makes it feel less like it was something only invented to get our heroes out of a jam in the Resurrection ‘F’ arc. Even if it still most likely was.\n\nBeerus, being sick of having nothing to do this arc, destroys Zamasu. They return to Earth to tell Trunks about the good news. Trunks tries to explain that time travel doesn’t work that way in this universe, but Beerus just wants this arc to be over with and buggers off. Trunks, Goku, Vegeta, and even Bulma decide to go to the future and see if everything’s all right. Now, I know what your probably thinking. Shouldn’t they have some kinda plan to fight Zamasu and Black just in case they are still in the future? Or at the very least, do some training first? But, y'know, they’ll probably just cross that bridge when they get to it.\n\n_GOKU! You’re suppose to learn from your past mistakes!\n\n_ Things come to a head when Black and Zamasu point out that all of this has been a self fulfilling paradox. If Trunks never went back in time in the first place, Goku would of never met Zamasu, Zamasu wouldn’t have become Black, and the future wouldn’t of been destroyed. And since I didn’t know where else to point this out, I just wanna praise that that fact that everything that has happened in this art does follow the rules of time traveling that the story established. Given how losey goosey Dragon Ball can be with it’s own lore and consistency, I was sure there would be some kind of plot hole regarding something as elaborate as time travel. But, surprisingly, they went through the effort to keep everything consistent. They forgot what color hair Trunks was suppose to have, but they got this right. So kudos.\n\nTrunks is furious when Zamasu and Black point out that, in a way, this is all his doing. He has a breaking point as the two mock him. And in his anger, he develops a new transformation. Super Saiyan…they never name it in the series proper. I know that it’s called Super Saiyan Anger or Rage or whatever the translation is, but they never name it in the series or explain what exactly it is beyond a form that is formed via anger. _AKA: ALL THE NON GODLY SAIYAN FORMS, CAUSE THEY’RE ALL FUELED BY ANGER! _\n\nThat being said though, despite the lack of real explanation on how it works and the fact that it doesn’t really add much to the plot, I have to say it’s one of the coolest looking forms in the series. Like Super Saiyan Blue Kai-o-Ken it has two aura’s, as well as incorporating elements from Buff Super Saiyan form used in the Cell saga. I wish they elaborated on it more, cause this design feel way too cool to be this quote unquote generic.\n\nTrunks holds Black and Zamasu off while the rest of the group travel back in time on more time in order to find a way to actually STOP Zamasu and Black for good. Goku goes to Roshi in order to learn how to do the Evil Containment Wave, in hopes of being about to seal away Zamasu rather than kill him. Meanwhile Vegeta goes to train for twelve hours in the hyperbolic time chamber. They return to the future to have they’re final rematch with Black and Zamasu.\n\nWhile this is going on Beerus realizes that he’s failed to kill Zamasu and actually feels bad. Not bad enough to go and help, but bad enough to send Gowasu and Shin to help in his place.\n\nThey arrive in the time machine, which Black immediately destroys, also damaging the jar they were planning on sealing Zamasu in. See, unlike other villains, Zamasu and Black are actually proactive. I like that. It’s up to Trunks, Mai, and Bulma to fix both the time machine and the jar. Fighting ensues as Vegeta just wails on Black. Black realizes that anger can result in him getting more strength, so he channels that anger into…a scythe…that he uses to open a portal in space time, that creates clones of himself….being angry did this. Ah, whatever, the arc’s almost over. Who cares?\n\n_So, could Vegeta and Goku do this too? I can’t think of any logical reason why they shouldn’t be able to.\n\n_ While Goku and Vegeta are busy with the clones of Black, Zamasu heads for Trunks. The only hope is for Trunks to preform the Evil Containment Wave. Luckily Bulma has a video of it on her phone for Trunks to use as a reference. Bulma goes out to buy him some time by trying to seduce Zamasu in one of the greatest scenes ever put to television, and Trunks is able to successfully preform the move, trapping Zamasu in the jar forever…\n\nOr at least he would of if Goku hadn’t forgot the seal! _TWICE! TWICE GOKU FU*K UP IN STOPPING THE VILLAINS! _Since Zamasu’s free, he realizes that it’s time to take these mortals seriously. So using the potara earrings he fuses with Black, becoming FUSED ZAMASU! Who manages to somehow be even more of an edgelord than he was before!\n\n_AND THIS…IS TO GO…EVEN FURTHER…BEYOND! IT’S SUPER SAIYAN EDGE!\n\n_The three of them simply aren’t strong enough to stop Zamasu in this state. They’re only hope is to use the potara themselves and fuse into Vegeto! Which is retconned into only being permanent with Kais. Cause fusions are popular and they’re going to milk it for all it’s worth. Even though they could of had them return to normal without the need for a retcon cause it’s been established that the dragon balls can undo a fusion…but who cares? Now they only stay fused for an hour, but the more energy they use, the shorter amount of time they can be fused. They fuse and go Super Saiyan Blue and we get one of the best fights we’ve had in the series thus far, despite it only being about two minutes. The fluidity of the animation is done in a way that Dragon Ball has never really done up until this point, and resembles a fight from _One Punch Man _more than Dragon Ball.\n\nIt’s during this fight that they discover how to beat Zamasu. While Zamasu was immortal Goku Black wasn’t. When Zamasu took Goku’s body he also inherited many of his Saiyan traits, including lust for battle and his desire to have a proper challenge. As such he never wanted immortality and now that he and Zamasu are fused together, he isn’t wholly immortal anymore, and his body begins going into flux. Unfortunately they burn up they’re energy to quickly and defuse before they’re able to kill Zamasu. Unable to even transform anymore due to how depleted they are, it’s up to Trunks to stop him. All the resistance members cheer Trunks on, and they’re hope and belief in him forms into a mini spirit bomb that he channels through his sword. He uses this energy to defeat Zamasu by slicing him in half. Dick first no less.\n\nThis ending seemed to be a bit divisive when it first came out, with many people saying it was a Deus ex Machina. And I have to say that I kinda agreed with a lot of the criticism when I first saw it. Trunks learning the Evil Containment Wave so fast via just one video he saw was one thing, but the spirit bomb is literally a move that he never learned. Nor even really had an opportunity to learn. However, while it doesn’t make sense logically, this ending does work really well in a thematic sense. It ties in to the arcs, and even all of Super in general, theme of mortals rising up to reach a power beyond the Gods. It shows that, when all of humanity works together for a common ideal, they is no limit to there power. Cause in the end, humans where able to do what the Gods couldn’t. Beerus’s plan to kill Zamasu failed. Shin and Gowasu’s plan with the potara’s failed. Even Goku and Vegeta’s plan of using God Ki failed. In the end it was all of humanity, giving they’re power to Trunks, they’re one hope, that was able to defeat Zamasu once and for all. And it shows that Trunks was able to save his own future, without needing to rely on Goku and Vegeta or Gohan or anyone else. Zamasu and Black where his problem, and he had to be the one to stop them.\n\nSo that was my review of Dragon Ball Super: Future Trunks arc. So what are my final thought…and wait. What do you mean they’re one more episode left?…\n\n…Oh no…\n\nSo Zamasu, being truly immortal, isn’t killed by his body being destroyed. He simply transforms into an ethereal state, in honestly one of the most horrifying things Dragon Ball has ever done. He turns into Gygas from Earthbound and in one attack levels the Earth and whips out all of humanity minus our heroes. Without a body there’s nothing for our heroes to fight, and all hope seems loss. Until Goku remembers Zeno’s button and calls him for help. This summons the Future Zeno, which is weird cause you’d think God would be like beyond the confines of space and time, but apparently he isn’t. Zeno see’s all the damage Zamasu has done and decides to deal with this by destroying the timeline completely. The gang escape in they’re time machine before being erased too. You know, I was joking around with the Samurai Jack comparisons at the beginning, but that’s basically what ends up happening. Goku returns to the void that was once Trunks timeline and grabs the Future Zeno and brings him to the present. He goes to present Zeno and tells him that he’s found his new friend. We also learn that the Grand Priest is Whis’s dad.\n\nAfter returning to Earth, our heroes discuss what to do now. Whis mentions that when Beerus killed the present Zamaus it created a new time ring, and that Trunks and Mai could use that to travel to a new future. One that never had Zamasu in it. That’s right, they’re taking the Rick and Morty approach. “Close enough, right?” They fly off in the time machine together and then the arc ends.\n\nNow, I will say this. Having the guts to have an arc like this end on such a bittersweet note is definitely a ballsy move. In a world where so many problems can be solved by just collecting the Dragon Balls, I like the idea of their actually being serious consequences that can’t be fixed. But because this all happens in the last episode of the arc, there’s no time to let this sink in. And the ending is just to depressing. The arc basically ends on-\n\nEveryone in Trunks timeline is dead. Not just dead but erased from existence completely. Trunks failed to save his future, making not just this whole arc pointless, but the Android and Cell saga pointless too! Why even go to a new timeline at all? Why not stay in the present timeline? At least you know these people! Everything Trunks said about the power of humanity working together was wrong. Humans couldn’t stop Zamasu. They needed the power of a God to save them. And the entire DESTRUCTION of an entire timeline could of been avoided if Goku hadn’t summoned Zeno. Or if he had just brought the dang seal. Or, you know, if he defeated Black in their first fight!\n\nSo yeah, in conclusion, I feel very mixed on this arc. There are a lot of pros. Zamasu and Black are both fantastic villains who in my opinion deserve more recognition. Also it’s refreshing just to have a new Dragon Ball villain, as appose to all the other arc antagonist who are rivals or…Frieza again. I appreciate the darker tone and the feeling of actual stakes, which is something the last two arcs felt particularly lacking in. And I also enjoy all the fun moments we get seeing Trunks interact with the older Z fighters. But man, does the ending kill a lot of what the arc had going for it. Also the arc drags a bit in parts, as personally I feel you could cut out at least one of the trips to the future. Overall, I think I’d say the arc is still the best arc the series has had so far, but it’s defiantly a case of higher highs and lower lows. But at least we don’t have any evil Goku’s to worry about.\n\nCause the one we have is enough trouble as it is.\n\nSo that was my review of the “Future Trunks” arc of Dragon Ball Super.

If you're just joining us I'm going over all the events that happened to the cartoon community thought the year of 2018. I'm also ranking all the new series from best to worse, and deciding which network was the quote unquote \"winner\" of the year. If you haven't seen part one, you can check it out here. 2018 Year in REVIEW: Part 1 But for everyone else, let's get on with the review. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So at the end of the last part, we had to deal with that whole \"Thundercats CalArts\" debacle. Not exactly the most \"positive\" stopping point. So why don't we start this part with something light? Oh hey, look, people are talking about Butch Hartman! He's always good for a laugh. What's he up too?\n\nOh no...\n\nSo Butch Hartman, America's dad, started a Kickstarter for his own streaming service. It's called Oaxis and is suppose to be a family friendly streaming service with original programming along the lines of Netflix. Butch asked for 250,000 dollars in order to get the basic groundwork for the site up and running. That's a lot of money to ask for, so there's no way he could actually...Holy crap, he actually did it! The madman pulled it off! Now, there's a lot to unload here. Butch Hartman's streaming service initially was met with controversy due to how vague everything about it was. There were a lot of unanswered questions. We didn't know what kind of shows it would have outside of a few failed pilots that Butch had pitched to various networks in the years prior. Were there other creators had plans to affiliate themselves with the project? All of these unanswered questions lead a lot of people to think that this was all just a big scam. If I had to make a guess, I have a feeling that part of the point of the Kickstarter was to act as a proof of concept. A way to show investors that there was an interest in the service. While a quarter of a million dollars is a lot, that's still not anywhere NEAR enough to run an entire new entertainment platform. However, I wanna be devil's advocate here. Butch Hartman has some experience in this field.The Noog Network, is an app that he developed that specializes in family friendly animated and live action shorts all created by Butch Hartman himself. Not exactly the same as a streaming service, but still. And consider that Butch has ties to people in the industry, and has experiences running a business in the form of his nonprofit charity The Hartman House, MAYBE he could pull it off? Maybe? Possibly... But that's not where the controversy ends however! As footage leaked of old Butch-y boi speaking at a church event promoting Oaxis. Here he made several claims that many found to be a bit disconcerting. Such as claims that his streaming service would feature \"Christian values\" which is something not at all mentioned in his Kickstarter. As a Christian myself I've always thought of Christian values as things like kindness, generosity, respect. All things that aren't necessarily exclusive to Christianity. So maybe he meant like that. However, the fact that he was invited as a special guest to a church to speak about the service...It's definitely a little bit suspect. There's nothing wrong with making a streaming service aimed at Christian families, but you should at least mention it in the Kickstarter. That way people know what they're donating too. He later specified in a tweet that while the service wouldn't inherently be Christian themed, but since Butch Hartman is a devout Christian himself, that would always carry over into his work no matter what he does. It should be noted that in the same speech he list his previous shows as containing the same \"Christian values\" and I don't think anybody was ever converted to Christianity by T.U.F.F Puppy. I don't know. Man, between this and last years Castlevania, I love being forced to talk about my religious views in a article that's suppose to be about dumb cartoon shows. He also made a controversial claim saying that suicides are more common now of days because of peoples addition to cell phones and technology. Saying that because of these technology people not talking to their parents as much as a result. I'm not a researcher on this, so I have no idea if this is actually true. I could definitely see that could at least be partially true with things like cyber bulling and the lack of communication with parents COULD possibly be a factor in the increases of suicides. But it defiantly feels like a disservice to just ignore issues like mental health being a factor. I can defiantly see how people could of taken offense. All of this backlash lead to everyone's favorite 2018 game! \"Attack people online until they apologize!\" Cause as we all know, nothing makes an apology more sincere than when it's forced out of them by an angry mob! But eventually all the heat died down when all the \"Butch Hartman Rant\" videos stopped getting views, I mean, when there was nothing left to talk about. Overall, I think that the situation was just bad on all fronts. Butch should of said something to explain himself, and not be so vague in his goals. But also, we live in a day and age where I honestly wonder if that would of been the smartest move. It feels like once people have their opinion set, there's no going back. I mean how often to celebrity apologizes even work? Still though, smart or not, it would of been the right thing to do. However, I would like to point out that all of this hate started simply because he reached his goal. All the stuff about the church and his suicide comments all came after he was already getting hate for being a scam artist. But the thing is, we don't even know if he is a scam artist or not. Sure, the fact that he's barely talked about Oaxis at all since the Kickstarter was funded doesn't bode well. But from what I could fine, he's given out most of the rewards he promised. And on the Kickstarter page he says the site wasn't expected to launch until mid 2020. Do I think Butch will be able to pull this off? Probably not...but I hope he does. I want Oaxis to be a thing, cause I am interested in some of the shows he's talked about putting on there, like Elf Detective. And if you hate Butch and hope for Oaxis to fail, that's your prerogative. But if you are hoping for it to fail, than you're hoping that nearly thirteen hundred people got scammed out of their money. Just saying. Ugh! I'm sick of this drama. I want more uplifting Kickstarter news! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHomestar Runner was one of the first big web series that existed B.Y. Before Youtube. The series has been running off and on for about nineteen years now. And the creators, The Brother Chaps, decided to make a Kickstarter campaign to make a tabletop board game based on one of there series most popular characters. Trogdor, the Burniator. A poorly drawn dragon with an affinity for burning down cottages. The Kickstarter was set up for a goal seventy thousand dollars. Which feels like a lot for a board game, but hey, what do I know. While Homestar still has a very loyal fanbase, the series defiantly is nowhere near as popular as it was in the early to mid two thousands. And seventy thousand is a pretty hefty goal? Would a board game based on an outdated internet meme from 2004 really be able to make that kind of money? It reached it's goal in less than a day. And by the end they ended up making over one point four million dollars! I don't know what exactly The Brothers Chaps are going to do with all that money, but it's nice to know that the Homestar fanbase is still alive and well after all that time. And it's also nice to just see a Kickstarter that reached it's goal, delivered everything it promised, and didn't get into any major controversies. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Anyway, back to controversy. Cyma Zarghami, president of Nickelodeon since 2006, resigned. And people hate her because of some...controversy. Something about unions I think? Yeah, I didn't bother looking into this one. Between the Thundercats Roar drama and Butch Hartman stuff, I just couldn't go through all of this again. Sometimes ignorance is bliss, so I'm perfectly happy to be the ostrich with it's head in the sand on this one! However, like I said last time, it'll be very interesting to see what happens to Nickelodeon in the next couple of years. Without Butch Hartman, Dan Schneider, and now Cyma Zarghami I feel like Nickelodeon five years from now could be something completely unrecognizable from what it is today. And hopefully it'll be in a good way. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- But hey, this year wasn't all drama though. I mean look at all the new shows we got. Like Pinky Malinky.\n\nDELAYED! Okay, well at least we finally have Young Justice season three...\n\nDELAYED! The new Harley Quinn Cartoon...\n\nDELAYED! FXX's Deadpool?\n\nCANCELED! TBS's Close Enough from Regular Show creator JG Quintel?\n\nWHO THE FU*K EVEN KNOWS AT THIS POINT? Seriously, what's with this year? It's like everything has been delayed! What the heck? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nickelodeon announced that they're making a reboot for the Rugrats. And just...why? Money- Yes, I know it's money! But it's a show about babies! When you make a reboot of something, the entire point is to update it. But when your show is about babies, how are you suppose to do that? Babies today are still doing the same things that babies did back in 1991. And with the first show having one hundred seventy two half hour episodes. What stories are left to tell? Then again, anything can be good. That Muppet Babies reboot (Which I didn't watch and isn't on this list) seems to be pretty well received. So maybe it could work. I don't know. I've never seen to much Rugrats growing up, so it's hard for me to get excited for this. But I'm sure someone will enjoy it. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So Netflix decided to drop all of their new series all at the end of the year. Their first one is Matt Groening's Disenchantment.\n\nThe series follows Bean, the princess of the magical kingdom of Dreamland. She's a bitter snarky alcoholic, cause AGAIN, NEVER SEEN THAT CHARACTER DONE BEFORE! The series follows her, as well as her personal demon Luci and her elf companion Elfo through various misadventures. Think what Futurama did with Sci-fi but with a fantasy setting and you have this show. Only...Comedy Centeral era Futurama. I didn't really enjoy the first seven or so episodes of this show that much. The show wasn't bad per say, but it wasn't really anything great either. This show is aimed slightly more towards adults than Matt Groening's previous works, having a TV-14 rating instead of a TV-PG. The humor is a bit darker and edgier, and it lead to this very mean spirited feel over the entire show. The cast aren't particularly likable, and Dreamland just isn't a fun setting to be around. One thing I did like however was the fact that the show had an on going continuity and changing status quo. This is refreshing considering that Matt Groenings other shows (mainly The Simpsons) are famous for almost always returning to their status quo. But here's the weird thing, starting with episode 8, the show suddenly has this MASSIVE spike in quality out of nowhere as all the plot points that have been building over the course of the season all start to pay off. The characters all become a lot more likable. The stakes are raised. Like, it's weird how different these last three episodes are. I'd go into more detail, but unfortunately I can't due to spoilers, but trust me, the show gets better. It's not \"classic Simpsons\" or \"classic Futurama\" good, but still. It's not THAT far off. This sudden spike in quality makes it hard for me to decide how to rate this show. But since most of the run is pretty sub par, I kinda just have to average it out. Unfortunately due to the continuity you "
