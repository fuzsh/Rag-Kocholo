        "text": "Grumpy Squidward Guy said:\n\nIts also sad how modern Cartoons go downhill in their 2nd season, Its probably because cartoon network has an addiction to making the first seasons so long usually 52 episodes\n\nI don't really agree. Sanjay and Craig has improved so much after season 2 and I still need to catch up on the show. Gravity Falls, Rick and Morty and Steven Universe are getting better and better. Bob's Burgers is still fresh in it's fifth season. Adventure Time continued to be amazing until season 5 but back uphill in second half of season 6 and Regular Show is slowly improving in season 7. I haven't seen most of new Clarence episodes, so I can't comment on that but I've seen Lil Buddy, In Dreams and Goldfish Follies and they are such amazing episodes\n\nDigitalDistraction said:\n\nSouth Park never went downhill IMO\n\nAgree on that. Last season was pretty strong.\n\nAngryKoopa2002 said:\n\nRen and Stimpy: Went downhill when John K got fired. Games took over in late 1993 with season two. Although the first season had some duds like Marooned or Mad Dog Hoek.\n\nArthur went downhill in season 4 and was all the down the hill by season 9, under the barrel by season 12, and went to heck in season 16.\n\nSouth park is a special case of this. The show went downhill rather early in season 3, which introduced us with two terrible episodes (RS and SC) although the meteor shower trilogy was pretty seasons 1 and 2 quality. Season 4 was even worse than season 3. That 4th grade arc in the second half was really stupid and gave us a lot of terrible episodes. Season 5 was a little better, and seasons 6 and 7 were actually decent. Though seasons 8 and 9 came another slump, and from season 10 on its been dead and gets worse with every single season.\n\nSpongebob went back up hill in season 8.\n\nUncle grandpa went downhill in season 2.\n\nActually John. K has involved with season 2. It's just some of later episodes were finished by Games.\n\nAngryKoopa2002 said:\n\nArthur went downhill in season 4 and was all the down the hill by season 9, under the barrel by season 12, and went to heck in season 16.\n\nSouth park is a special case of this.

A lot of episodes Seasons 4-8 were good in my book, Season 9 was lame (like Family Guy, but they did have good episodes in that), Season 10 was awesome, and the rest were good, however Season 14 was also a bit lame. Season 16 and on has terrible animation, and possibly meh episodes.\n\nDon't get it like that. Maybe some episodes are good, but another weird thing.\n\nYep, Season 8-present are much better for SpongeBob than Seasons 6-7. Some episodes might be bleh, but I've found a lot of episodes I'm satisfied with from both seasons. How will I ever say it's the worst season? Did \"Pet Sitter Pat\" and \"Demolition Doofus\" weigh it down in the \"everything counts\" world of the haters? :P The latter half of Season 4 was lame. Season 5 picked up, but a few things were shaky by the end (Atlantis Squarepantis, a few episodes).\n\nSB_DW_Fan said:\n\nLel, The Simpsons went downhill after season 9.\n\nI know, but I thought a lot of early Scully episodes (Seasons 9-10) were good. Season 11 was the bottom of the barrel, to me. While Seasons 12 and 13 improved (to me), the show peaked again around Season 15 (one of my favorite seasons!) and maybe kept it up on a slightly lower level for the next two-three seasons. Season 19 was another lowpoint, and so was Season 21 (albeit better). I'll just say it went all uphill from there.\n\nI'm surprised nobody has mentioned The Fairly OddParents! or Family Guy yet. The former show, maybe Season 5 wasn't as fun as the first four, but Season 6 was a decent improvement, especially with the cute baby Poof. Yeah, he might be a gimmick, but at least he's not that bad. Seasons 7 and 8 sound good to me (while having some stinkers), but Season 9 was just boring. Sparky sounds like a pimple-faced teenager, but to me, he's okay. I hope that Season 10 is okay.\n\nFamily Guy, I'm usually not very harsh on it (like I am). It's just that a lot of people feel a very special kind of harsh, but really, I would much, much rather prefer that show to something crude like Brickleberry or Mr. Pickles. Seasons 1-6 are the undisputable best seasons of the show. Season 7, while a step down, still has a lot of good episodes I like. Season 8 was fine, too. Season 9 went a little off on a tangent, but I haven't seen most episodes. Season 10 was cool (except for a few, as usual). Season 11 was okay, while Season 12 was really the pit of the show, to me. I liked more episodes from the 2013 half. Season 13 is a little improvement from the bottom, and I'm actually excited for Season 14."
