What are your thoughts on this show, if you have seen it?\n\nIt had its moments, but whenever they made an edgy joke it felt like they were just trying to be shocking.\n\nThe black baby names joke was gold though.\n\nhttp://www.cc.com/video-clips/0xpno9/brickleberry-antichrist\n\nI'm kind of surprised that it has actually gone for three seasons. I don't know if its garbage per se, but its not good enough for me to invest any time in it.\n\nI did not like it. I remember I was disappointed when it was renewed the one time while Jeselnik Offensive and the Burn were cancelled."
