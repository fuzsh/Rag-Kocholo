        "text": "Spoilers Below:\n\nWell well well, looky here, we got ol’ Gonzo Green back in Brickleberry town. Let me go ahead and get this out there: I’m not a regular watcher of the show. I’m not the dude that covers it. However, I also wasn’t the person who regularly reviewed it when I was assigned the Season 2 premiere last year, but I covered that anyway. Although then I had some warning and could watch all of Season 1 first. This time, not so much.\n\nNo, Gonzo Green got the call to cover this show randomly last night. “Why?” you might ask. Because I have Time Warner Cable. That’s right, the episode was only available online to people with certain cable providers, and I only got it because I happened to sign with the cable company Hitler would run if he were to delve in the business. Oh man, don’t get me started on how awful Time Warner is. I once received the entirely wrong cable box in the mail, and then received the right one a few days later without a power cord. They then mailed me a power cord but it didn’t fit the box I was sent. I actually told a representative of the company that trained monkeys could do a better job than their employees. And I stand by that.\n\nAnyway, did I mention that my Brickleberry call to action came in the middle of my regular weekend drinking bender? Because that’s kind of important. I mean, I was going to watch cartoons anyway, so I guess it’s not that bad. So, in honor of the one year anniversary of me randomly covering this show: please allow me to randomly cover this show.\n\nIn it, Obama came to visit, and Steve began to drive Woody crazy, since the latter believed the former would be an embarrassment. But after an accident, Steve nursed Woody back to health, and the two became best friends. Hilarity ensued, a lot of funky shit happened, and of course everybody won in the end and things basically went back to normal.\n\nMeanwhile, Bobby invented O’Bobbycare to compete with Obama and convince that other redneck, whats-his-name, to turn against the president. I don’t wish to give away the details of this plotline either, but let’s just say it went from extremely conservative to extremely liberal quite quickly, and in a very funny way.\n\nAlso, Obama is apparently obsessed with Connie, even though no one initially believed her. Things got even more awkward than usual.\n\nIn Case You Missed It:\n\n1) In Steve’s dream, the first award given out was for “most handicapped”\n\n2) Why did they censor Woody’s frank but not his beans?\n\n3) I don’t know about the regular state of her character in Brickleberry, but I feel like Natasha Leggero is always drunk.\n\n4) Steve killed Peter Dinklage. His trophy head joined the heads of Mini-Me, Tattoo, Warwick Davis, and an Oompa Loompa.\n\n5) Woody’s doctor’s really really bad news is that Ben Affleck is the new Batman.\n\n6) In case you were wondering, the cost for a doctor to pull a bunch of pens & pencils out of one’s eye is $1200.\n\n7) The biggest joke of the episode involved a gay, Mexican immigrant, and that’s all I can say.\n\nTo sum it up best: I was surprisingly entertained with the third season premiere of Brickleberry. The laughs weren’t rapid-fire, but came often and were quite hearty. The show continues to push the envelope in a way much like classic Family Guy, but without seeming like it’s trying to hard or going unnecessarily far – the drawbacks of current Family Guy episodes.\n\nAlso, the whole cast of characters pitched in equally for this episode. Everyone got a decent amount of attention, and there were essentially at least three separate storylines to keep the installment amusing.\n\nThe cast performed well as always, with Daniel Tosh continuing to be the smaller, more bear-like version of himself, and Natasha Leggero officially logging more seasons than Kaitlin Olson, the original voice of Ethel.\n\nIf the rest of the season is as funny as this week, I may need to reconsider how I infrequently I watch it. Might have to free up my Tuesday nights to tune into Comedy Central.\n\nSo how about that? Not bad for a drunk review, eh? Should be good practice, since I’ll generally be operating under the influence while at this year’s New York Comic-Con. Stop by and say hi. If you actually find me, I might buy you a drink."
