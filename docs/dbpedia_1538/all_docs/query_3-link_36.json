        "text": "Box Incorporated\n\nBending Unit\n\n« on: 12-12-2012 04:45 »\n\nAs you might've heard, their has been a new animated show on Comedy Central called Brickleberry, by the creator of Tosh.0, Daniel Tosh. It has recently finished its 1st Season and has been renewed for Season 2 with 13 episodes. Now in case you haven't heard about it, let me show you it's terribleness, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zpWXinvQ-I\n\nI really hate this show and by its ratings, it might replace Ugly Americans, or possibly Futurama, and judging by its animation, it's likely very cheap to make, so discuss on what you think of this show and it's Drawn Together/South Park like shock humor... minus the humorous part.\n\nFrida Waterfall\n\nProfessor\n\n« Reply #5 on: 01-27-2013 01:28 »\n\nThe show just isn't funny. Offensive, yes, but offensive isn't always funny. This show proves it.\n\nI watched an episode or two (by \"watching\", I mean the show came on on a television in the same room as I was using my computer). While I do enjoy the girl from \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" doing some voice acting (reminds me of Nicole Sullivan), Daniel Tosh's character is purely the selling point of the show. It is the only reason that show attracts and audience yet alone was considered to be produced by Comedy Central. And Daniel Tosh's character, the bear cub, has cultivated a hatred towards him for me. The character isn't funny. He has no flaws whatsoever, other than being gluttonous (which only makes the character \"cuter\" or \"funnier\"). The character is never really insulted in the show. Tosh's voice does not go well with the character, and he doesn't seem to even give an effort of acting to the role (other than being Tosh). It's basically Tosh playing a perfect version of himself. Tosh doesn't seem to take any bullets for himself. He refuses to play a character that isn't offensive or could be deemed \"uncool\". I hate it. I hate it. I hate it.\n\nIf \"Brickleberry\" gets renewed and \"Futurama\" doesn't, heads will fucking roll.\n\nFrida Waterfall\n\nProfessor\n\n« Reply #7 on: 01-28-2013 06:20 »\n\nI honestly don't care if either of them get renewed. Right now Comedy Central's only quality shows are Workaholics, Tosh.0, and to a lesser extent, new South Park.\n\nIf you're not a fan of Futurama, then why are you on a Futurama forum?\n\nI only like the first eight minutes of Tosh.0. And even then, I only like it for the spitfire funny videos. Tosh is just an obnoxious Bob Saget-like commentator- same level of hilarity and just less family-friendly. To add to that, I have to wait an hour after I eat to watch Tosh.0.\n\nJoshTheater\n\nSpace Pope\n\n« Reply #8 on: 01-28-2013 08:37 »\n\n« Last Edit on: 01-28-2013 08:38 »\n\nIf you're not a fan of Futurama, then why are you on a Futurama forum?\n\nOf course I'm a fan of Futurama. I'm just one of those assholes who think it sucks as of late. I mean, it doesn't necessarily suck, but after finishing this last half-season that just aired (in which there wasn't a single stand-out good episode for me), I think I'm finished with keeping up with new episodes. I'll probably at some point watch future episodes that air, but I'm not going to make any effort to see them while or soon after they air, since it's to the point now where I simply don't find it worth it anymore. I may change my mind by the time the second half of this season rolls around, but at the moment that's my decision since there are so many other shows that I follow rigorously that I enjoy so much more.\n\nSpaceGoldfish fromWazn\n\nUrban Legend\n\n« Reply #9 on: 01-28-2013 22:23 »\n\nI've just watched a few clips, and I'm thinking about watching the show for Connie. Maybe the actual show is worse and this is just what I've seen from the trailers, but they've managed to do what Family Guy tries to do but fails miserably at: make a gay character that's funny in a stereotypical way, but genuinely makes you care about her. She's funny, but at the same time I wanted to give her a big hug when I found out about her past.\n\nBox Incorporated\n\nBending Unit\n\n« Reply #10 on: 01-29-2013 03:08 »\n\nI've just watched a few clips, and I'm thinking about watching the show for Connie.

Not as bad as the Tosh bear, but still pretty terrible. And the show itself is funnier than current Family Guy, but it's a lot more grotesque and edgy in it's jokes and a lot of the time just acts gross and fucked up just to be gross and fucked up. It's slightly better than when the pilot aired, but it's still poorly done and has a lot of jokes that just miss, but if you want to check it out for yourself, watch the Gay Bomb episode (it's exactly what the title says) and see whether it's actually watchable or not.\n\nSpaceGoldfish fromWazn\n\nUrban Legend\n\n« Reply #12 on: 01-29-2013 15:50 »\n\nI've just watched a few clips, and I'm thinking about watching the show for Connie.
