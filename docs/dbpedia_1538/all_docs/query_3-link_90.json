        "text": "Yea, I was legitimately surprised to see if survived to the third season. It always felt more than a little forced, though it had its good moments.\n\nAnyway, I'm generally annoyed when shows are canceled between seasons, often leaving the series dead on a cliffhanger (I don't know if this is the case here, but it is frequently). Contracts should provide for a clause to allow one final episode upon not being renewed (kinda like Serenity)... shows need closure.\n\nSame. Tosh.0 was losing its appeal, at least with me. My wife claimed to like the show, but stopped watching after I did. None of these shows are very good, but at least America's Funniest Videos got in before YouTube. Tosh.0 got cloned by Nickelodeon or MTV (I forget which, but does it matter these days?) and both of them got undercut by Equals 3 (is that even still a thing?). So Tosh.0 was serving up the best of =3 and then its leftovers. The three of them cannibalized each other, and I didn't think any of the hosts were very funny.\n\nAs for Brickleberry, it was like a mashup of South Park and Parks and Rec, but not as funny as either. Wife and I watched the first season, but abandoned it after (and that might have been when we abandoned Tosh.0 as well). And then my wife got real big into anime, so we didn't go back."
