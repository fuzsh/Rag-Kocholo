        "text": "Let me explain this. In the behind the scenes for Samurai Jack season 5, Genndy Tartakovsky said that while he would take advantage of the show being on Adult Swim, it would still appeal to a general audience. When he said that, I thought the season would get a PG rating, and I was legitimately surprised that it got a TV-14 considering it's a huge jump from TV-Y7, and said season is wrapping up the story.\n\nIf someone were to revive kids shows like say Danny Phantom, Catscratch, Dexter's Laboratory, and Generator Rex (just to name a few examples) and continue their stories (whether for a movie or an additional season), could it be possible for them to get a TV-14 rating?\n\nA few thoughts for this:\n\n1. I'm not asking for shows to have darker and edgier revivals. This thread is entirely hypothetical.\n\n2. A reboot is different from a revival. The former involves starting from scratch while the latter involves continuing the story.\n\n3. If said kids shows got these darker and edgier revivals, should they still be called kids shows or adult shows?\n\n4. The reason I'm starting this thread is because some people might miss the reason why the new Samurai Jack season handles it's darker and edgier themes better, and just produce a bunch of shows with tasteless shock value.\n\n5. To get slightly off topic, some people are making guesses that the upcoming Batman and Harley Quinn movie could be set in the DCAU (composed of many of many shows from 1992-2006). I would've retorted with something like \"But the DCAU is for both kids and adults while this movie is just for adults\", but with the new Samurai Jack season, I don't know what to say to that.\n\nHow about the reverse:\n\nAn adult show being turned into a kids' show\n\nI shudder to think what a TV-Y7 take on Scandal or Law & Order would look like!\n\nHilariously, Hasbro's C.O.P.S (the late 80s-early 90s cyberpunk cop show by DIC Entertainment ) had to rename itself Cyber C.O.P.S to avoid being confused with, well, the OTHER C.O.P.S (\"whatcha gonna do..\").\n\nHonestly, much like how I feel about movie studios using Deadpool and Logan to bank on profitable R-rated superhero films, I'm anxious with the idea (though I'm not completely against it). The last thing I want is another \"Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon\" which is what happens when you don't make the transition to a higher age rating for creative freedom properly (the art is still good, but the writing, not so much).\n\nWhich is why I like Genndy's Samurai Jack Season 5: it doesn't force \"adult themes\" in a blunt manner like most \"adult cartoons\" (late season Family Guy, Brickleberry, most Adult Swim shows barring the usual exceptions). The transition to the TV-14 rating is pretty slick.\n\nI think it would depend on the show and where they air. The TV 14 rating for Samurai Jack works because it airs on Adult Swim and the violence fits with the tone of the series. It also helps that it doesn't feel too jarring compared to the original series. They do definitely take advantage of the different rating, but there are also moments that fit in right with the comedic aspects of the original series. It has more intense violence, but they use it sparingly.\n\nIf Nickelodeon makes a revival of Danny Phantom, it wouldn't make sense for it to become TV 14 since the audience would still be primarily kids and it would be airing on a channel for children too. If a show is aimed more at older fans like the Samurai Jack revival is, then that rating could potentially work for it. Again, it really does depend on the show and what kind of tone they're going for with it.\n\nThis could work for some shows but for others... Yeah that just would be an odd sight to see. I can't imagine other shows really go up here, knowing that a lot of them don't really have the advantage of Samurai Jack airing on Adult Swim. Also then there was Ren and Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon that really can be an example of how some shows should avoid changing their rating. Or again a creator might not be suited to make a show more mature. Which is why I think that for well intentions those shows should at least remain on their rating and just be like certain shows like Steven Universe that work well even if they are PG, since they know how to skirt some lines and work well.\n\nOf course they could but I feel that more often than not it is just going to come across as a cheap way to be edgy. The new Samurai Jack is TV-14 due to violence which fits into the show easily. I can't imagine what could naturally fit into a show like Dexter's Lab to bump the rating up that high.\n\nI could. You have Dexter, Dee Dee, and the rest age just enough, and have Dee Dee suddenly have a little too much cleavage for her body to handle.......\n\nThere are too many factors to consider. Does the show need a revival? Do the adult elements actually add something or not? Does the show even need to become \"adult\"?\n\nToo many people seem to think that cartoons suitable for kids are necessairely for them. That's not true. Just because kids can watch something doesn't mean only they can watch it - heck, sometimes, it's not even aimed at them.\n\nSeveral movies/shows considered \"for kids\" are actually just \"family-friendly\" - which means both adults and kids can watch it, even for different reasons. But they're definitely not for kids only.\n\nThis is one of those cases where one should really be careful what they wish for. There are a number of reasons as to why Samurai Jack was able to pull off the transition from kids' show to adult show; the chief ones are its unique style and mature themes, the fact that Cartoon Network and Adult Swim work closer together than any of the other kids' channels do with their nearest adult counterparts, and the timing with the show's original audience now young adults with more disposable income, as well as cartoons finding a new niche in teen/young adult popular culture thanks to the Internet.\n\nRen & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon is an example of this gone wrong. John K was given full creative control and the show was on Nickelodeon's adult stablemate, Spike, in the early 2000s. However, it was a massive failure both critically and commercially and got cancelled before its first season ended.\n\nThis is truly a quality-over-quantity case. The people with the money and the power to make the decisions have to understand the balance between making the revival that will blow up on social media versus what the actual quality of the show will be."
