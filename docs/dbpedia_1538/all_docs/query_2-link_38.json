        "text": "Hello everybody, my name is JoyofCrimeArt and God damn it! I said I wanted something better next time!\n\nSo it's come to this. Talking about Teen Titans Go! is kinda like talking about politics. In so far as it's rarely pleasant, it brings out the worst in people, and you're pretty much guaranteed to get hate regardless of what your opinion is. But like politics, I think it is something that it is worth taking about. Because Teen Titans Go! is a very interesting specimen of a series. Teen Titans Go! is, by far, one of the most talked about series in the cartoon community. Almost EVERY reviewer has talked about the series at one point or another, to the point to where talking about the series almost feels like a semi-rite of passage for any wannabe cartoon critic. If I were writing this review a few months ago I would say that the series was almost universally despised on the internet. However, in the past few months I have noticed this very vocal population of Teen Titans Go! defenders out there. And to those people I have to say...where were you for the last five years? Love it, hate it, or love to hate it, one thing is clear. This show is a show that many people feel passionately about. Not only that, but the show is successful! The series has been running for over five years, accumulating over two hundred episodes including two mini-series. It's almost always the most heavily aired and promoted series on Cartoon Network getting marathons for almost every holiday. INCLUDING AN EIGHT DAY ONE OVER CHRISTMAS 2017 THAT I'M STILL BITTER ABOUT! It's been promoted as \"You're new favorite show.\" It's gotten it's own blocks. And when Cartoon Network didn't have enough new episodes to air, they created there own \"Musical Cliptastic Countdown\" style clip-show and advertised those as new episodes. But all of that pales to the shows biggest feat. A theatrical movie, TEEN TITANS GO TO THE MOVIES! Which is coming out in just a few weeks as of the posting of this review. I have seen nearly every episode of this show, at least once. Most episodes, more than once. (Cause hey, that's what happens when you watch the Cartoon Network live broadcasts.) I've been wanting to cover this series since I started reviewing two years ago. But I knew I only had one chance at it, and I wanted to make sure I did it right. I wasn't ready then. But with a movie on the way, it seems like now is as good of a time as any to finally tackle Teen Titans Go! But the question remained, how do I go about doing this? Teen Titans Go! has been talked about so much. What could I possibly add to the conversation? I admit this was something I worried about, but I think I have found a solution.\n\nI want to do this right. I want to tackle nook and cranny of the show in a deep analysis, like I did all the way back in my Powerpuff Girls 2016 retrospect. I wanna cover the show honestly, the good and the bad. But for this review I also wanna do something a little different. Normally when I review something I try to cover just the series itself, and my reaction/experience with it. However, for a show like this, I wanna do something I normal avoid doing and talk about the more \"meta\" elements of the series. Because honestly, I think that stuff is just as if not more interesting than the show itself. And if I ignored these elements completely it would feel like I would be denying a lot of context in the Teen Titans Go! discussion. But since these are more \"meta.\" elements and not AS connected to series itself it made more sense to me to relegate that all to a different review. So that's what I'm going to do. This part will be me analyzing the series on it's own merits. And then part two will be analyzing the series wider influence and the fan reactions to the show. I think separating the these two elements is important, as I believe it would be unfair to judge a series for things outside of the creators control, and I want to be as fair as I possibly can. This is going to be a deep dive. And it'll probably be a long one, but there's a lot to cover. If your okay with that, than let's jump right in and talk about Teen Titans Go! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think it's important that before we discuss Teen Titans Go! I talk about my thoughts leading up to the show. Just for the sake of transparency. As a young kid, I watched the original Teen Titans cartoon and remembered liking it quite a bit. But by circa 2013 I didn't really have much memories of the show of the original series beyond \"remember liking it\" and a few stand out moments. I never went back and re-watched the series in the six years since it had ended. Since then I have re-watched some of the original Teen Titans, and while having it's own issues, on the whole it's really fantastic. If you haven't seen it you should really give it a watch. It has a great combination of comedy, action, and drama. And it's one of the best examples I have ever seen of teenage aged characters who actually FEEL like real teenagers I've ever seen on television. Prior to Teen Titans Go! release a series of Chibi Teen Titans shorts were released on the DC Nation action block. This was a sorta in-between phase between the original and Go! and these shorts were...fine? I guess? They had the problem all DC nation shorts had, being only ONE MINUTE LONG, they didn't have much time to set up jokes. But for what it what they were they were...passable. I bring all this up because I think it's important to note that I was both KINDA a new fan, entering the series with no prior knowledge of the original. And also KINDA an old fan seeing a series I loved get rebooted. So I could kinda experience both sides of the spectrum. However, there was something else that effected my view of the show. It was Young Justice.\n\nI was a BIG fan of Young Justice, and if you watched that show than you will know that it was not treated the best. The show aired at a crummy time slot on Saturday mornings, was never advertised, went on random month long hiatus's BEFORE that was the norm for cartoons. And to see this show being treated so bad, only to be replaced a month later with ANOTHER comedy during a time where action shows were dying out. And airing in a much better prime time time slot to boot? It was hard to not feel a little bit cheated. And I think this (in addition to Teen Titans season fives infamous cliffhanger.) was a major factor in why so many people were so against the idea of Teen Titans Go! right out the gate. However, Young Justice ended in February 2013, and Teen Titans Go! didn't come out until April. And during that month in between I began to think a little more positively. I went into the show with low expectations, but hoping I would be proven wrong. It wasn't Teen Titans Go's! fault that Young Justice had ended. Plus Teen Titans had comedy in it, so maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Oh, poor, young, stupid JoyofCrimeArt. Um-I mean, let's look at the results, shall we?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ep34ULG3w\n\nFirst just to get it out of the way, I'm briefly going to talk about how this show compares to the original. And I say briefly because, honestly, there isn't much point to it. When you think about it, Teen Titans Go! is a really odd and probably risky move for Warner Bros to make. Taking an action show that was several years old and turning it into an eleven minute comedy with a whole new demographic in mind? Now of days that's super common with examples ranging from Ben 10 to the upcoming Thundercats Roar! but in 2013 this was not a common occurrence. Super hero comedies were pretty rare, and even the ones that did exist still were usually at least action/comedies. So right from the get go it was going to take some time for audiences to adjust. There are some people who say that you shouldn't make any comparison to the old show cause, hey, it's a reboot. This is something I disagree with. Obviously they wouldn't attach the Teen Titans brand to the show if they weren't hoping to attract fans of the old show. Especially given that most kids in this shows target demo probably weren't even aware of the original Teen Titans. And given the fact that there using the same characters from the 2003 series, brought the voice cast back, and frequently imply that certain events from the old show had happened in this continuity, it becomes confusing on how to judge this show. Is it a sequel?.....Reboot?.....Cash grab? The point is, to do this show justice, I'm going to talk about the show both as a reboot and as it's own thing. Cause the faithfulness or a reboot doesn't always equate to the series overall quality. However, I honestly feel that if they had gone full reboot, with new voice cast, character designs, and maybe even different characters on the team the show might have been able to stand on it's own more and people might have been less harsh to it. I'm not saying it doing that necessarily improve the final product, but I do feel like it would of helped the show be received better by older fans. But I get why, from a marketing standpoint, they didn't do that. But regardless, let's talk about the characters. Well when the show started, they seemed mostly like they were in the old series. Just a bit exaggerated, which wasn't to big of a deal because yes, when doing a full comedy, your bound to exaggerate some things. Robin was the strict know it all leader. Starfire was the naive innocent. Beast Boy and Cyborg were fairly interchangeable idiot comic relief characters. And Raven was the sarcastic cynic. Traits were played up, like Robin's egotism, or Beast Boy and Cyborg's idiocy, but the basic structure of the characters from the old show was still visible.\n\nBut as the show progressed, the cast became progressively and progressively flanderized into characters that are not only completely unrecognizable from there 2003 counterparts, but completely unrecognizable from season one counterparts as well. And the big problem is that as the show goes on, they all become basically the same character, with a few caveats. By season two or three all the Titans pretty much act identical. They all yell all the time, they're all lazy and selfish, and they're all idiots. All the characters are pretty much interchangeable except for one or two small differences. Online anime reviewer SuperEyepatcheWolf once said something in a video that always stuck with me. [link] He was quoting a line from Tina Fays book \"Bossypants\" and it was something along the lines of \"The key to good characters, is to have it to where if they're all in a situation each character would have a different response to the situation.\" That was a quote that I always remembers, and is something I keep in mind when coming up with characters myself. I bring this up because Teen Titans Go! does not follow the principle at all. And by having all the characters act the same it not only becomes less accurate to the thing that the series is suppose to be adapting, but more importantly it limits the potential for character driven comedy. And when your series is all comedy limiting the kind of comedy you can do is never a good thing. The only character who is okay is Robin. He's the only character who (mostly) acts consistently. He's also the only character who acts as a foil to the rest of the Titans, and is the only character who has a reason for his behavior. He has an inferiority complex due to being the only Titan who was a sidekick. So he uses narcissism to mask his insecurity. He's also obsessive because he was raised by BATMAN. As odd as this sounds, Robin actually is a full realized and fleshed out character. And I know, saying Teen Titans Go! has a fleshed out character is really weird to say. (Also, as ashamed as I am to admit it, I kinda relate to Robin in some aspects.) However, just because he's fully realized doesn't mean he's necessarily likeable. Nobody in this show is likeable. They are all jerks with no sympathy for others. While in the original series the Titans really had this feeling of a family unit. Here, they all seem to just hate each others company. This element, in my opinion, hurts the series. I think this could of worked if they just toned it down just a bit. it seems like almost every other kids cartoon right now more or less follows the same \"nice, optimistic, adventurous but naive\" young hero archetype. So it's nice to see a show that is a little bit more cynical just for the sake of seeing something different. But I believe they go to far the other way with it makes it hard to root for our \"heroes\" when they literally are just jerks, and don't really even have reasons for being jerks or ever learn to be better. And without likeable or distinct characters it's really hard to become invested. As for the side characters, they all feel very underutilized. Especially in the case of the villains. Like, I know this show isn't about the crime fighting, but that doesn't mean you can't incorporate the villains in a comedic way. I mean if you look at other superhero comedies like Powerpuff Girls, the villains are usually the best part. Now, I wanna give credit where credit is due. Some villains like Trigon, Control Freak, and especially Brother Blood are great in this show. Other villains like the H.I.V.E and the Brain are nothing fantastic, but are serviceable. But what I wanna know, is that if this show is a comedy why don't they use any of the villains that are actually GEARED towards comedy. Mumbo was only used in a meaningful way in ONE episode. Mad Mod has yet to have any actually lines in the series. And Larry hasn't shown up at ALL. And the thing is that there are a lot of episodes where having more minor villains from the old show would make sense but they don't do it. Like in the episode \"Puppets, Whaaaaat?\" where the Titans get turned into puppets. Why not include Puppet King. Or in the episode \"Hot Salad Water.\" where the Titans are mind controlled by the Queen of England? Why not use Mad Mod instead? It feels like such a wasted opportunity. But y'know the show isn't about the characters! It's about the comedy! Is the show at least funny? For the most part...not really? While obviously comedy is subjective I just am not to much of a fan of the humor of this show. Like I said, since the characters are more or less identical there's no chance for character driven comedy to shine. So all the humor of the show is pretty much just loud goofy random humor. It's all just kinda...obnoxious. The humor just lacks any form of nuance, and after two hundred episodes jokes have become very predicable. Honestly, Teen Titans Go! is at it's best when it does just go for it. When you throw a billion jokes at the wall, somethings bound to stick. The funniest part of the show is just watching to see what the hell it'll do next, And I wanna give the show credit, that's not in any way an insult. The show is honestly most enjoyable if you look at it from the perspective of a giant shit-post. And while that sounds harsh, I think on some level that's what the creators of the show were KINDA going for? I have no proof of this, but that is just the vibe I get from both the show and the creators during interviews. So...props to you I guess? The show also excels at meta humor, though we'll dive more in the next part. Part of the issue that Teen Titans Go! has is that it puts comedy so FAR in the forefront, that it feels like everything else is just an afterthought. And granted, there are plenty of other shows like that. However, the downside to this strategy is that if you don't find the show funny, there isn't really anything there for you. Like take other CN show comedy's for example. If you don't think We Bare Bears is funny, you can still appreciate the shows charming atmosphere. If you don't think that The Amazing World of Gumball is funny, you can still appreciate the show's breathtaking visuals. But with Teen Titans Go!, what you see is what you get. And unfortunately, I don't see much here I haven't seen before. Well okay, how about the writing? Is the writing good?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy-7q8vmrXM\n\nHalf the time character's just do whatever the writers want them to do just to make the plot work! And the other half the times the characters seem like there actively trying to avoid the plot like it's some kinda horrific virus! Take the episode \"Booty Scooty\" where the Titans Tower has been bought land developers, who want to tear the tower down to build a mini-mall. But none of the Titans sans Robin care. Cause hey, they like shopping. So the episode grinds to a halt as Robin has to explain to his team why losing there homes is a bad thing, and tries to convince his team to do the plot. It's like the show is purposefully trying to avoid anything interesting. I know it's a comedy, but comedies still need conflict. Everything's a joke in this show, so it's hard to get invested in anything. There are shows that can pull that type of thing off. But to do that the comedy HAS funny enough to excuse the lack of tension. And to me at least, Teen Titans Go! doesn't pass this threshold.\n\nAlso, the show is really repetitive. Half the episodes follow this follow this basic formula\n\nTitan A gains some new hobby/interest and converts the other titans into said hobby/interest\n\nTitan go along with it. Except for one member (Usually Robin.) who warns them that getting into this hobby/interest will have \"dangerous consequences.\"\n\nTitans ignore the warning and become obsessed.\n\nSome supernatural Regular Show style BS happens.\n\nRaven reviles that the only way the fix this is to go on some kinda \"quest.\"\n\nPlot is resolved.\n\nAnd the other half of the series is just about food. Seriously, there are like...fifteenth billion episodes devoted to food.\n\nBut hey, a show doesn't need characters, comedy, or writing to be good....maybe it can be saved by the animation? Like RWBY.\n\nI will say this. The animation itself isn't as bad as a lot of other flash shows. The characters are all distinctly shaped and colorful. And I love the thick outlines. You can tell it's flash, but it's not BAD flash. And when the show want to the animation can look downright incredible, and even have some outstanding action scenes believe it or not.\n\nBut like I said. \"When the show wants to.\" For the most part the show looks good, but there are some glaring animation shortcuts that are often used, and are very noticeable. The show is, for the most part, always set in the same five or six locations. And that gives the show an element of blandness to it. The show uses stock photos as backgrounds. Which is a trend I've noticed a lot in a lot of modern cartoons...and I think this trend sucks. Gumball, so far at least, is the only show I've seen do it in a unique and creative way. Every other time I've seen it just looks jarring. And the show reuses animation fairly frequently, and it's not subtle. However, the show has toned this down a bit recently, but still. The fact that a show as popular as this that ISN'T Dragonball Super would so blatantly reuse animation in such an obvious way seems like either a sign of just corner cutting, or a sever lack of time given to the crew. Because of these short cuts the animation just sorta levels out to...slightly above average-ish? Also I have to comment on the character designs. Like this is more of an observation than a flaw, but why does everyone have such GIANT heads and such tiny necks and bodies? I mean, who would design characters like that?\n\n... How dare you? Let's talk about the voice acting. EVERYBODY says that the voice acting in the show is the one redeeming quality. And the voice acting...varies. And while I know just saying that will cause me to be struck down by the unholy wrath of Tara Strong herself, but just hear me out! Almost all of the voice actors from the 2003 series are back to reprise there roles. But the issue is...they don't sound the same. Everyone's delivery is so much louder and more over the top compared to the original. Not to mention all the annoying verbal tics like Beast Boy's \"White rapper-esq\" slang or Starfire's \"Saying all the the's.\" Both minor elements from the old show that have been escalated up to eleven in this series. Raven's voice in particular seems to vary scene to scene from \"fairly close to the old show's Raven.\" to \"Tara Strong just doing Twilight Sparkle.\" I have no problem with the cast going in a different direction with there delivery. I just don't understand what the point of getting the old cast back is if there not going to sound like the original. And this is coming from someone who honestly wouldn't of minded that much one way or another if they didn't get the original voice actors back. What is more of an issue is that the five actors who play the Titans ALSO voice, like, almost every other minor or one shot character in the show. If they weren't in the original series, there's a good chance that one of the five main voice actors play them. Some of the voice actors, like Tara Strong and Khary Payton have a decent voice range, and so it isn't to noticeable. Others, like Scott Menville and ESPECIALLY Greg Cipes have no range whatsoever, and ever time I hear them trying to sound different I just wanna stab my ears out with a rusty spork. And even for the actors who ARE good at hiding the fact that it's them, after two hundred episodes you become able to spot them at a moments notice. Basically, this show has completely ruined my ability to ever hear any of these voice actors as \"not there voice actors.\" However, before I'm lynched, I just wanna say that this probably isn't the voice actors fault. It probably is more an issue with casting and the voice directing crew. And to be fair I don't think that there are ANY voice actors who could come up with new voices for two hundred episodes without making it sound noticeable. And they do give it there best effort. Yes, that is one positive I will give the voice acting. They go for it. There's a kinetic energy to the performances, and it sounds like the voice actors had a lot of fun. And with a lot of the voices you can tell the actors are trying there hardest, and sometimes these deliveries actually succeed in making an other wise unfunny line funny just through the levels of ham presented. So I have to commend them on that. So hopefully that praise at the end will keep me safe from Tara Strong's unholy dark powers for a least a little while longer...\n\nThe show also has songs! A lot! These songs vary in quality. And that is because, according to official interviews, some of the songs are written and some are given to the cast to ad-lib on the spot. And I don't really know how to respond to that. If you put a voice actors on the spot \"put a song here.\" then yeah, it probably isn't going to sound good. Many of the \"improved\" songs tend to just have one A,A,A,A rhyme scheme, simple chorus, and generic lyrics. I'm not blaming the voice actors though, I couldn't do better. I'm blaming the people who thought this was a good idea! Though I will admit that a lot of these \"bad songs\" are fairly catchy. Which I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. BUT some of the songs are great! \"The Night Begins To Shine.\" is the obvious example, but there are other good ones too. \"Fade Away\" \"BBRae\" and \"Take it Down Low.\" being some of my personal favorite. It's a bit of a mixed bag all things considered, but when the songs hit they really hit. So I can commend the show for that... But the four \"all musical\" clipshow episodes are still stupid. I don't think this show was doomed to fail. Other shows like Space Ghost: Coast to Coast and RWBY Chibi...season one, prove that you CAN make a completely comedic spin-off of a more serious property, and do it well. But what I think those two shows, and other series like those shows, have that TTG doesn't have is the heart. It really like the creators of this show, really don't care about or even like the original 2003 series. This may not be the case, but that's how it feels. As I said ALL THE WAY back in my What Makes a Good Reboot Cartoon Thought, one of the major keys to making a good reboot is respect, or at least an understanding, of the source material. And honestly, it sometimes feels like the creators of this show didn't even want to make a Teen Titans show. This show feels like another unrelated superhero comedy, with the Teen Titans put in last minute. And maybe that would of been better overall. Sure, the series wouldn't of gotten the initial \"bump\" it got if it wasn't connected to a well known i.p. But clearly the people who like this show don't really care about it being like the old show anyway, and the show would probably be hated a lot less if it wasn't connected to something that many people consider a modern classic. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So overall, that is my rundown on Teen Titans Go! as a series as a whole. But we're not done yet. Come back NEXT WEEK, as we are going to analysis the more \"meta\" elements of Teen Titans Go! I'm going to talk about the reactions to the show, and the reaction the show has towards it's critics. And the impact Teen Titans Go! has had on both Cartoon Network and television as a whole. I think that important to bring these things up because I think these elements in particular have the greatest impact on Teen Titans Go's! reception. But what do you think of Teen Titans Go!? Love it or hate it I'd love to hear from you in the comments down bellow. If it's not obvious by now, I find this show fascinating and love hearing other peoples opinions on it, cause I think there is a lot to talk about. Leave a fav, follow, and comment and come back next week...as we get to the bottom of this case.\n\nI'll be the round....about.... Have a great day.
