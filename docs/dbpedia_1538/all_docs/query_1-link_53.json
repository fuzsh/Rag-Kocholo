        "text": "ShinyMetal***\n\nProfessor\n\n« Reply #41 on: 11-07-2013 21:57 »\n\nMan, I need to catch up with this show. I watched it when it was first on, basically up until Summerween, and stopped paying attention to it afterward because I figured it was cancelled, what with the strange absence of the show and all. I just now realized they came back from what I assume was a hiatus, and now I've gotta find time to finish Season 1.\n\nTell me, everyone; Are the further episodes as good as the first few were? I just want to be sure I'm not diving into crap here, you know?\n\nYea, I thought it was ending too, and yes there are some episodes still worth watching but I personally think that the originals are better.\n\nThis can also be used as response to Beamer.\n\nSolidSnake\n\nProfessor\n\n« Reply #58 on: 06-24-2014 07:22 »\n\nI'll agree it doesn't. But just saying, if they did work on Rick and Morty I willing to bet they'd keep the show as fresh as it was during the first season. They get to keep on using the same vulgar kind of jokes Later Futurama Seasons had, since it kind of fits with Rick and Morty episodes at times. Seeing Josh come in was definitely a surprise.\n\nAlso, Brickleberry is still trash BI. Sorry, not trying to offend, but I watched a couple from S1 and a few from S2 and didn't find em any better.\n\nSolidSnake\n\nProfessor\n\n« Reply #60 on: 07-27-2014 08:18 »\n\nI like the big sendoff we saw at the end of season one. I'm a bit interested on how they're going to tackle all of it, but I hope it doesn't become too much part of the show. Like I would enjoy it if they could balance it out with some big reveal episodes with Bill and stuff, and also have fun episodes like Carpet Diem. I mean the big reveal episodes with Bill and stuff are the highlight of the show, similar to how Fry discovering he's the most important person in the universe reveal happened in Futurama. But I would appreciate it if they balanced it out just enough to get one more season. (Since Alex Hirsch only plans on the show having three seasons and possibly a movie)\n\nScrappylive\n\nLiquid Emperor\n\n« Reply #62 on: 07-31-2014 09:20 »\n\n(Since Alex Hirsch only plans on the show having three seasons and possibly a movie)\n\nFrom what I heard, Alex isn't even sure if he wants to do a Season 3.\n\nThis is most definitely not what I like to hear. Now that Futurama is re-cancelled, Community and Gravity Falls are my two favorite current shows. Except Community has been put on hiatus, pushed to mid-season, downsized (half seasons), nearly cancelled, lost its original creator and executive producer (then regained him), cancelled, and shifted over to Yahoo! Screen. And Alex Hirsch doesn't want to do much more of this show.\n\nSad. Sad sad sad.\n\nJust out of curiosity... any links to him stating/insinuating this? Or does anybody know why he doesn't want to continue it much longer?\n\nScrappylive\n\nLiquid Emperor\n\n« Reply #66 on: 08-11-2014 19:39 »\n\n« Last Edit on: 08-11-2014 19:54 »\n\nI'm thinking Gravity Falls will be the next series I rewatch from the start, leading into Season 2. I look forward to seeing the new stuff.\n\nJust out of curiosity... any links to him stating/insinuating this?

That may be too many though. Perhaps 2 and a movie. Im more interested in quality than quantity. But I suppose anything can happen\n\nSource: Reddit AMA with _alexhirsh on August 16, 2013\n\nAlternate Link: Reddit AMA with _alexhirsh on August 16, 2013\n\nSolidSnake\n\nProfessor\n\n« Reply #70 on: 09-25-2014 06:41 »\n\nSo far I haven't found Season 2 to be as good as Season 1.\n\nI mean I loved the first two episodes, but the two after that were just kinda mediocre in my opinion. In \"The Golf War\" it only really focused on giving as much screen time to the putchians as possible. I kinda liked the main plot going on and the resolution of everything, but the rest was just meh.\n\nI also wasn't very fond of \"Sock Opra\", because I thought it was basically a ratings trap by putting Bill in it. He posed as no real threat, since all he was aiming to do was take Dipper's Journal. Like he wasn't making any deals to kill somebody or ruin somebodies life entirely. All he was going to do was just destroy the third journal (which Stan already copied in Scary-Oke, he'd probably just give Dipper a new one. Cause I don't think Dipper would tell Stan he made a deal with Bill).\n\nAlso, something that seems to be a recurring theme this season is Dipper making stupid decisions. I'm not saying dumb as in Homer Simpson dumb or Fry dumb, but I mean he just isn't learn his lessons. He keeps putting himself and others in danger just for the sake of trying to find/solve a mystery. I thought by the second episode he figured he'd take a step back and have a breather before looking for more mysteries. But nah.\n\nI understand that this is a cartoon and everything, but I didn't find Season 1 to have these kinds of problems. And I actually really like the last episode that aired, \"Soos and the real girl\". It was probably the most plot-focused episode this season, since the rest were either aiming for jokes or going all over the place.\n\nBut yeah, just my two cents.\n\nBox Incorporated\n\nBending Unit\n\n« Reply #72 on: 09-26-2014 00:33 »\n\nSo far, Season 2 has been fantastic, Soos and the Real Girl probably the best episode so far of the Season.\n\nWould've liked to have seen Bill keep more of his mysterious and thrilling tone from Dreamscapers, but I thought Sock Opera used him well enough, if just to see his amazing character again (him taking Dipper's body and destroying the original journal was fairly big enough for him I thought).\n\nAs for Dipper...eh. His character has always been tightly wound about those mysteries, I guess it wasn't the smartest thing for him to get help from Bill, but eh, it doesn't seem to out of it for him to forget those previous episodes to unlock possibly his only chance at figuring out more about the journal writer.\n\nSo far the Season has been just as funny as before, the plots have been interesting, there's still hidden things throughout episodes (those FBI guys have showed up a few times, also apparently might be tracking the Mystery Shack), and I look forward to what they'll try to do by the end of the Season.\n\nSolidSnake\n\nProfessor\n\n« Reply #73 on: 10-29-2014 20:11 »\n\nOkay, so far Season 2's been great. Had a rough start with episodes 3 and 4 but it got back on track after that.\n\nMonday night's episode was amazing, one of the best for sure. It disproved so many fan theories and gave us so many more questions to ask.\n\nAlso, the episode paved the way for a reference in a Rick and Morty episode. I put it all in the Spoiler box (just so I don't accidentally spoil anyone who hasn't seen it)\n\nSo, Old Man McGucket is NOT the author, as many assumed. This episode seems to have pointed the finger at STAN being the possible Author now. The episode even explains why nobody ever seemed to have known/cared about the mysteries of Gravity Falls. And for the first time all season, Dipper did something right.\n\nAt the end of the episode, we see more of Stan's Portal. It's getting really strong, and even sucks in a few items, which pop out of a portal during the Rick and Morty episode \"Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind\"\n\nAll I have to say to that is HOLY SHIT MINDBLOWN, how did nobody catch that??\n\nHonestly, I cannot wait to see where they go with this. Disproving\n\nOld Man McGucket\n\nas the author paved the way for SO MANY other opportunities. I hope they don't blow it. The Rick and Morty reference is something I definitely did not see coming.\n\nI don't know about you, but this one episode alone has seriously put me on the edge of my seat to see where the series goes. Don't fuck it up, please.\n\nSolidSnake\n\nProfessor\n\n« Reply #78 on: 02-18-2015 20:57 »\n\n*bump*\n\nLatest episode was great, the return of Nathan Fillion and the Northwest family, and a SPOOKY GHOST!\n\nMabel and her friends always fun, no more stupidly long gaps between episodes please, and a Season 3 announcement would be delightful, 2 seasons isn't quite enough for me.\n\nI heard all the creator of the show originally wanted to do was 2 seasons and a movie. Fair, I suppose. Quality over Quantity works for me.\n\nAnywho, I liked last episode, actually. The character development between Dipper and Pacifica was actually really nice, which is a surprise I was kinda expecting it to be bad or just there to please the fangirls. Anyways, I liked it alot and I am super pumped for the cliffhanger this episode left us on.\n\nTurns out the next episode is going to be about Dipper becoming suspicious of Grunkle Stan. FINALLY. The episode I've been waiting all series for! But it doesn't air until March 2nd or 9th I believe."
