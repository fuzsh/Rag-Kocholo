        "text": "Former Athens residents Waco O'Guin and Roger Black have come a long way since their days of assaulting good taste and gentility with their raucous \"DAMN! Show\" productions at the Georgia Theatre.\n\nO'Guin and Black, who met while matriculating at UGA, now call Southern California home, and their animated show \"Brickleberry\" began its second season on Sept. 3 on Comedy Central. O'Guin and Black are the creators and showrunners of \"Brickleberry,\" share executive producer credit with noted comedian Daniel Tosh (who also voices the character, Malloy, a talking bear), and are now awaiting word from their employers on a possible third season.\n\nThe show airs at 10:30 p.m. Tuesdays, wedged between the extremely popular \"Tosh.O\" and \"The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.\" \"Brickleberry\" delivered good enough ratings during its maiden voyage to stay afloat, always a dicey proposition in television.\n\n\"We're almost done with the second season,\" O'Guin said. \"We've finished eight of the 13 episodes. We basically write for six months, and then we're in post (production) for about six months, waiting for the animation to come back. Post is the easy part of doing the show. The writing part is panic attacks seven days a week and all that good stuff.\"\n\n\"Writing is the worst, the hardest part of the process,\" Black added. \"You have no free time. You're either working on next week's outline or a draft that was just handed to you. If we get something on Friday, that means we spend Saturday and Sunday working 12-14 hours a day locked in our bedrooms.\"\n\nIt's a far cry from the casual production schedule of the \"DAMN! Show,\" which, believe it or not, was hatched some 15 years ago when O'Guin and some friends (Black joined a later incarnation of the troupe) created a canon of skits and videos containing material considered by many to be an equal-opportunity offender.\n\n\"With the 'DAMN! Show,' we'd just produce it as we wanted,\" O'Guin said. \"If we had a good idea, we'd go out and film it, and we could take months and months to put together a 40-minute show. We'd start working really hard a week before a show because we were trying to get a lot of sketches done. And the only people we had to please were ourselves and our fans. Now there's a whole team of executives who have to sign off on everything we do. Since they're paying us this money, they have to like what we're doing.\"\n\nFor those who have yet to be exposed to the bizarre wonders of \"Brickleberry\" (and aren't familiar with the abrasive humor of the \"DAMN! Show\"), the show takes place in a B-grade national park with a cast of, frankly, frightening characters that set the stage for a host of edgy scenarios. After a previous stint on MTV with the short-lived (2005-06) sketch show \"Stankervision,\" O'Guin and Black like the setup at Comedy Central much more.\n\n\"You can get away with so much more on Comedy Central,\" Black said. \"On MTV our hands were pretty tied. But Comedy Central, with shows like 'South Park' paving the way for us, allows us to do the kind of show we want to do. It would have been great to be on a broadcast or network channel, but at the same time, it probably would have been the same situation as MTV, and we wouldn't have had the freedom to do the show we wanted to do.\"\n\n\"We definitely get paid a little bit more from Comedy Central,\" O'Guin said. \"At MTV, it was basically slave labor. We were getting paid the same thing as the guys in 'The State,' and that was when the show was on in 1993. And when that show was cancelled, we were basically broke. It's really bad to be broke when you've had your own TV show.\"\n\nAs the \"Brickleberry\" crew closes down the second season and tentatively plans for a third, both O'Guin (who's from Lakeland, near Valdosta) and Black (who's from Toccoa) find themselves occasionally longing for an extended visit to their old stomping grounds.\n\n\"Up until (last) October, I still owned a house there, so I went back once a month because my family was still there,\" said O'Guin, who has collected more than 4 million views on his YouTube channel. \"I haven't been back to Athens, but I want to come back. I want to get some Barberito's. I'm having withdrawals.\"\n\n\"I usually go back once a month,\" Black said. \"I grew up in Toccoa, and I still have a lot of friends in Athens. I hope to be able to go to a game this year because I really love Georgia football.\""
