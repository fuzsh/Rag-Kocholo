        "text": "Original Date: September 28, 2012\n\nSo…….in the first few shots of the first episode, there is that song (whose name I don’t know) that plays whether nature is involved and showing the wonderfulness of it and then there’s a lot animals humping and fucking, mostly having an orgy…………and this is funny how? Really, what the fuck is so funny about that?\n\nThis is BrickleBerry.\n\nThe series follows a group of never-do well forest rangers who are facing the shutdown of their National Park when a new ranger arrives to help transform them and save the park.\n\nThat’s partially it of the plot so far. The show is created by Roger Black and Waco O’Guin and as you may know (if you been living under a rock), the show is executive produced by Daniel Tosh, of Tosh.0 fame and is very well-known for his edgy, “envelope-pushing” style of comedy which means he’s possibly going to offend the fuck out of you, especially what happened over 2 months ago. Okay, I’ll openly admit I do watch Tosh.0 and occasionally find some of Tosh’s material kind of funny (come on, he’s no worse than Dane Cook) but when he tries to translate that into an animated series that’s basically the same shit we see in Family Guy and any show that Seth MacFarlane made after that and not even the decent American Dad style but more like style of The Cleveland Show, especially since both have bear characters and well, there’s more to read.\n\nThe characters in the show are basically having the bumbling moron architecture and/or playing the one joke of their character one too many times like the black ranger Denzel obviously want to bang old ladies and they show that a lot in the previews or Malloy the Bear being……you know what, Malloy is mostly Daniel Tosh in cub form just like in Bee Movie, the character Barry B. Benson is Jerry Seinfeld as a bee. Steve Williams is basically the main ranger who is actually seems like…….wait, no, he is an asshole. The new ranger Ethel is the humble one and the newest addition to BrickleBerry National Park but I didn’t think she was the Mary Sue I thought she was but yeah, both characters I really don’t care about or find not that amusing.\n\nAs a positive for the show, it is very well-casted with well-known comedic actors and voice actors like Jerry Minor (mostly known for being in SNL), Kaitlin Olson (aka Sweet Dee from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia), Tom Kenny (damn near almost any animated show but mostly Spongebob), David Herman (a lot of Mike Judge’s material i.e., King of the Hill, Office Space, Beavis & Butthead, etc.) and of course one of the show’s creators Roger Black voices Connie, a female ranger who isn’t exactly that feminine (yes, another guy is voicing a female character that sounds more hoarse than usual).\n\nThe animation for the show is provided by Bento Box Animation, whose only good show is still standing is Bob’s Burgers. Everything else they made (Neighbors from Hell, Allen Gregory– that Jonah Hill show) was canceled or not that great…..well, both.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Yeah, after watching one episode of this show, this show was something I expected from Daniel Tosh to be a part of, but the problem with it is that it is the one-note jokes, the blatant shock value and gross-out humor gets a little old too quick and I’m not turn off by most of that but I got a feeling this show is going to run that into the ground and not give a shit but hell, it might be renewed for a second season considering it is leading right after Tosh.0 and the ratings so far is decent for Comedy Central.\n\nI don’t know if I’ll watch the remainder of the show to see what it’s like but I hope some humor can change for the better.\n\nI give no rating as of yet but for the first episode, it’s a 4.5/10.\n\nUntil then, I’m MAK2.0 aka The Hybrid and………….Fuck, I need a new signoff."
