        "text": "The History of the Great Academic Dictionary of the Russian Language\" (История Большого Академического Словаря Русского Языка) is a massive monograph on Russian academic normative lexicography, starting from academician Jacob Grot's \"Dictionary of the Russian Language\" to the present edition of \"the Great Academic Dictionary of the Russian Language\" (GAD). It covers 175 years of history related to the theoretical and practical aspects of normative lexicography, pioneered by the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Institute for Linguistic Studies. The principle languages of the monograph are Russian and English. The text of Terminal Objectives is micrographically reduced to be read with a magnifying glass (included). In practice, \"the History of the GAD\" shall be considered as the first attempt of introducing this subject matter in English. The Monograph consists of 101 essays and treatises in Russian, English accompanied with essays in French, German and Armenian languages. More than 1,000,000 words were used to describe the subject matter in light of the latest achievements in world linguistics, lexicology and lexicography. The monograph is an introductory volume to the GAD. The entire work, as a single unit, is chronologically arranged essays, directly complementing the main subject. Each chapter can be read, used and lectured independently. Therefore, the work is formulated to appear not just as an appendix to the GAD, serving as a companion volume, but it is also composed and devised to perform as a textbook on Russian academic normative lexicography not just for Russian students of philological studies, or foreign students at Slavic Departments and russophiles likewise, but, in the interim, to play an essential role to function as a guidebook for professorial lecturers and as an illustrious Preface to the Great Academic Dictionary, as well.\n\nThe History of the Great Academic Dictionary of the Russian Language\" (История Большого Академического Словаря Русского Языка) is a massive monograph on Russian academic normative lexicography, starting from academician Jacob Grot's \"Dictionary of the Russian Language\" to the present edition of \"the Great Academic Dictionary of the Russian Language\" (GAD).

For such applications, plastic mold steels were developed that offer not only a good wear resistance due to the presence of carbides in a martensitic matrix, but also good corrosion resistance provided primarily by a sufficient amount of dissolved chromium. The common processing route for these high-alloyed materials is the hot isostatic pressing (HIP) of gas-atomized powders (PM-HIP). In this context, sintering plays an insignificant role, except for the processing of metal-matrix composites (MMCs). The development of novel wear- and corrosion-resistant MMCs based on plastic mold steels requires knowledge of the sintering behavior of prealloyed powders of such tool steels. It is well known that alloyed powders can be processed by supersolidus liquid-phase sintering (SLPS), a method leading to almost full densification and to microstructures without significant coarsening effects. In this work, two different gas-atomized powders of plastic mold steels were investigated by computational thermodynamics, thermal analysis, sintering experiments, and microstructural characterization. The results show that both powders can be sintered to almost full density (1 to 3 pct porosity) by SLPS in a vacuum or a nitrogen atmosphere. Experimental findings on the densification behavior, nitrogen uptake, and carbide volume fractions are in good agreement with calculations performed by computational thermodynamics.\n\nThe History of the Great Academic Dictionary of the Russian Language\" (История Большого Академического Словаря Русского Языка) is a massive monograph on Russian academic normative lexicography, starting from academician Jacob Grot's \"Dictionary of the Russian Language\" to the present edition of \"the Great Academic Dictionary of the Russian Language\" (GAD).
