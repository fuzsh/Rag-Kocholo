However, Fielder's marketing campaigns for each business can best be described as unorthodox, to the point where no traditional sales consultant would ever attempt what he does.\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 8 - The Colbert Report\n\nTune in to The Colbert Report, as Stephen Colbert gives his own take on the issues of the day, and more importantly, to tell you why everyone else's take is just plain wrong. The series is a variety/news show revolving around Colbert's TV persona, a parody of opinionated cable news personalities like Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and Joe Scarborough.\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 10 - South Park\n\nSouth Park is an animated series featuring four boys who live in the Colorado town of South Park, which is beset by frequent odd occurrences. The show grew out of a short film that Trey Parker and Matt Stone created called The Spirit of Christmas, and has become an award-winning show that is a unique blend of humor and satire.\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 14 - Strangers with Candy\n\n\"Hello, I'm Jerri Blank and I'm a 46-year-old high school freshman. For 32 years I was a teenage runaway. I was a boozer, a user, and a loser. My friends were dealers, cons, and 18 karat pimps. But now I'm out of jail, picking up my life exactly where I left off. I'm back in high school, living at home, and discovering all sorts of things about my body. I'm finding out that though the faces have changed, the hassles are just the same.\"\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 15 - Adam DeVine's House Party\n\nComedy Central gave Adam Devine a bunch of money to produce a comedy show, but each season he blows it all on a huge house party. Each episode features the Workaholics star in a series of scripted scenes, woven together with sets from some of the best up-and-coming comedians working today. The show has a little something for everybody and is -- to borrow a phrase -- very tight butthole.\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 17 - Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist\n\nDr. Katz is a divorced psychiatrist who lives with his son, Ben. While trying to help his patients (famous and not famous) with their traumas, paranoias, conflicts and problems, Dr. Katz also handles his own problems. His son Ben is all grown up but still don't know what to do with his life. His hobby is to waste Laura's (Dr. Katz's sarcastic receptionist) time with cheesy pick up lines and useless ideas and inventions. Dr. Katz also has a Cheers like bar called Jacky's 33 where he usually hangs out on his spare time, mostly chatting with his friends Julie and Stan. Julie is the bartender, who is studying to become a physical therapist and for whom Dr. Katz has a crush on. Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist was a cartoon based on Jonathan Katz's personal life. Originally running on Comedy Central, the show aired for 5 and a half seasons, and helped put Comedy Central on the map, along with fellow cartoon hit South Park. Halfway through its sixth season, the network cancelled.\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 18 - Stella\n\nStella , a comedic satire of everyday life, features the talents of Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter, and David Wain. Don’t let the suits fool you…the maturity level of these guys doesn’t always match their attire. As they go through their day they spread their sarcasm and wit-tinged non-sensical comedy to everyone they meet. The show is based on the stage-comedy of the same name by Black, Showalter, and Wain, who also write, produce and direct the show.\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 19 - The Man Show\n\nGrab a beer and drop your pants send the wife and kid to France It's The Man Show Quit your job and light a fart Yank your favorite private part It's The Man Show! It's a place where men can come together Look at the cans on this chick named Heather Juggy girls on trampolines Time to loosen those blue jeans It's The Man Show! The show celebrates all that is manly, from beer to women to porn, and though is at times less than tasteful, never takes itself seriously and does everything tongue and cheek along with a wink and a smile. After 4 season, the co-hosts Adam Corrolla and Jimmy Kimmell moved on, and were replaced by Joe Rogan and Doug Stanhope. This is beleived to be what killed the show, after it was cancelled after just one season with the new hosts.\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 23 - Drew Carey's Green Screen Show\n\nDrew Carey (\"The Drew Carey Show\" \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\") and his comic friends have a clever plan to shake up the concept of live improv comedy. The performers on this show act out quirky ideas suggested by the audience (\"You're getting married underwater and are attacked by a giant squid\"), but that's just a jumping-off point. The real fun begins with the technique known as green screen, which Drew's behind-the-scenes team will use to animate the skits, creating an actual improvised movie that brings to life the details going on in their vivid imaginations. This series is a fun and lively marriage of improv and animation, a concept only Drew Carey could pull off.\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 24 - Jon Benjamin Has a Van\n\nStep inside the van and get whisked away by H. Jon Benjamin and his investigative news team in COMEDY CENTRAL's new half-hour scripted series, \"Jon Benjamin Has a Van,\" as they journey to the heart of America, the streets of New York, foreign lands, even the depths of space, delivering reports in an innovative style unique to the show. Emmy(R)-nominated Benjamin (\"Archer,\" \"Bob's Burgers\") takes viewers on the ride of their lives in this inventive, irreverent fake news magazine/narrative show that will air Wednesdays at 10:30 p.m.\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 25 - Workaholics\n\nA single-camera comedy that features three friends who work together from 9 to 5, live together from 5 to 9 and party together 24/7. Dress codes, deadlines and waking up before noon are not things these guys are used to. They work as telemarketers and sometimes they even do their jobs well, but they show up late, leave drunk and always live for the day…even if they don’t know what day it is. Whether they're hanging out at their house in Rancho Cucamonga or getting ready to rage at a Renaissance Faire, the guys find trouble wherever they go.\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 30 - Tosh.0\n\nWith razor sharp wit and biting commentary, comedian Daniel Tosh delves into all aspects of the Internet from the absolutely absurd to the incredibly ingenious in this new weekly, topical series, Tosh.0 goes deep into the Web, spinning commentary about blogs and vlogs both popular and obscure, tweets and pokes, popular sites and new technologies.

I thought this was a comic strip?\"\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 36 - Michael and Michael Have Issues\n\nBest friends and collaborators for over 20 years, Michael Ian Black and Michael Showalter finally have their own TV show. There's just one problem: they are their own worst enemies. Sketches will be interspersed throughout the narrative thread of each episode. Behind-the-scenes of the show-within-a-show, viewers will get a first hand look at issues, both big (in an attempt to broaden their appeal, the guys turn their show into a frat house spectacle) and small (the two Michaels fight over the approval of a teenage intern writing an article about them for his high school newspaper) that the two misguided stars wrestle with as they confront their own issues of insecurity and jealousy as each attempts to undermine the other.\n\nView Episode Rankings\n\n# 37 - Threesome\n\nThe series is focused around three friends, Alice, Mitch and Richie who return home from a night out celebrating Alice's birthday and end up having a Threesome, which results in Richie getting Alice pregnant.
