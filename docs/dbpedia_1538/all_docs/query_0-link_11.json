        "text": "The last time we checked in with Paris Saint-Germain they drew their third consecutive match of the season and were sitting 13th in the Ligue 1 table. Showing just how fickle I was, I went home after the 0-0 draw with Bordeaux and canceled my trip to Lille. That was a mistake. Against Lille, PSG got their first win of the season as Zlatan Ibrahimovic opened the scoring after just 27 seconds to quiet the home crowd, and settled the match with his second goal after collecting Javier Pastore’s through ball. Friday night PSG returned to action and recorded its second consecutive win of the season behind goals from Ibrahimovic and Pastore. With the exception of the excellent Marco Verratti (more on him later), it was a workmanlike, no-nonsense performance. But if the victory was unimpressive, it was also never in doubt, as Toulouse rarely threatened and PSG controlled the tempo from start to finish.\n\nThe win moved PSG to fourth in the table, and they are now six points behind league leaders Marseille, who continued their perfect start to the season with a 1-0 win over Nancy.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti, for the first time this season, played the same lineup in consecutive matches and the performance had a hint of coherence that we didn’t see earlier this season. Finally, the grease is starting to touch the wheels and Ancelotti is accomplishing more by doing less. For now, he has shelved the idea of using Javier Pastore as a deep-lying playmaker and instead has given him a free role just behind Ibrahimovic. Blaise Matuidi remains a starter in spite of himself and Ancelotti seems to want him high up the field, which is understandable only if his thinking is that Matuidi is less of a liability to the team the farther away he is from his own goal.\n\nThe defense kept its third clean sheet of the season, but there will be changes at the back as club record signing Thiago Silva’s introduction to the side is imminent and the addition of Dutch right back Gregory van der Wiel will give Christophe Jallet some competition for the starting spot on the right of the defense. No matter what changes Ancelotti may introduce, the sure thing for PSG is Ibrahimovic’s consistency. Against Toulouse he scored his fifth goal in four matches, an easy tap-in after some good work from Jeremy Menez. Ibrahimovic still looks like he’s regaining his fitness and is not yet at his best, but he continues to deliver goals when he’s in the starting lineup. Javier Pastore’s first goal of the season, a delicate lob over the onrushing keeper, reminded everyone of his quality.\n\nBut the story from Friday night wasn’t the consecutive victories or the two goals. After the match all the talk was about PSG’s teenage midfielder Marco Verratti. Just five matches into the season, Verratti has already established himself as PSG’s best midfielder. While I’ve settled on calling Verratti “the Shadow” for his elusiveness, the Paris media has called him everything from le petit prince du Parc to le parrain du milieu, the godfather of the midfield.\n\nWhat separates Verratti from his more experienced teammates is uncertainty — the uncertainty of just how good he is. At 19, he’s not yet sure what he can or cannot do. He hasn’t yet found the limits of his talents, so he tries everything. Each time he touches the ball the game ceases to be 11 vs. 11 and becomes a one-man show. No matter how frenetic the pace of the match, once Verratti is on the ball everything slows down as he takes his time to invent something. Whether it’s a 30-yard lobbed pass like for the Pastore goal or a pirouette to leave a defender stranded, Verratti does it all while making it look as effortless and tidy as a five-yard sideways pass. The highlight of Friday night came when Verratti picked up the ball in his own box early in the second half. The easy and advisable thing to do would have been to either hoof the ball clear upfield or put it out of touch so the defense could regroup. Instead, Verratti looked up and decided to take on the defender. First he went around him, then fell to the ground, still controlling the ball, regained his feet, beat another defender, then started a passing sequence that brought the crowd to its feet for the loudest cheers of the night. The crowd might have loved it, but the opinion of the only man who matters was different.\n\n“He is very confident and comfortable on the ball, but he needs to take fewer risks when he is in front of the defense,” Ancelotti said. Ancelotti is an old man who has seen it all, and he knows that one day Verratti will get caught in possession too close to his own goal and PSG will pay dearly for it. Verratti also has a reckless side when he doesn’t have the ball that was evident in the 33rd minute against Toulouse, when he lunged in with an ill-intentioned two-footed tackle that earned him a yellow card. The tackle came just seconds after PSG were denied a free kick after what appeared an obvious foul, and it was silly for Verratti to take matters into his own hands, but those are some of the growing pains that Ancelotti will have to deal with this season as Verratti sorts out the boundaries of his own abilities.\n\nWatching Verratti, and then hearing Ancelotti voice his fears about Verratti’s cavalier style of play the day after the match, reminded me of the classic French film The 400 Blows, a kind of French cinematic equivalent of The Catcher in the Rye. The film and the novel are both about misunderstood youth, and Les quatre cents coups (The 400 Blows) chronicles the mischief of 12-year-old Antoine Doinel: smoking cigarettes, drinking liquor, stealing, acting up in class, landing himself in a jail cell with prostitutes, and ultimately sent to reform school by his parents. Much like Holden Caulfield before him, Antoine proves that, for better or worse, boys will be boys. On Friday night, Marco Verratti reaffirmed that. While he might have given old man Ancelotti a heart attack with some of the things he did, Ancelotti must accept that the occasional recklessness and precociousness is the price he pays for the defense-splitting passes that Verratti brings to the team.\n\nsource\n\nTime is go on, but playing this particular game is go on no matter how old we are hahaha…\n\nReview PES 2011\n\nWhen I tested it the first time, my first impression is PES has revolved. From old vintage pass and shoot to unlimited realistic football game. Although in this version the possibilies seems to be overstatement. You can shoot the hardest in any impossible movement. So the pro in this version is the new breaktrough PES with its many possibilites, and the con is there are too many unrealistic movement. The Goalie also unstoppable. There are also a chip-in penalty kick that 100% will be go in. You’ll be frustated against those opponents.\n\nThe Master League is actually great. There are many options that please us. So that we imagine that in the future version there will be more other option to play with.\n\nReview PES 2012\n\nWhen 2012 went out. I was grateful that the goalie wasn’t a God Keeper anymore. They are beatable. That’s my first impression. The second impression? Their freekick below 30 meter are not 100% go in, unlike in 2011! BUT and a big BUT, finally I was disappointed : 2012 is much worse than 2011 in terms of AI and bugs.\n\nYou will be stressed out to play against AI. You cannot take ball from your AI opponent without the opponent getting free kick. The Goalie is so much dumb. Also the AI defence is foolish. The algorithm for getting the shortest player to the ball is also suck.\n\nLazy Players\n\nIf you pass to the other player, your passer won’t help you run forward. OR if you attack the opponent, you will wind your attacking player (winger, striker, AMF, etc in front of you) just stay put in their place.\n\nNO. They are not lazy. Let’s say it not lazy, but the algorithm is just the way it is. They won’t move forward creating a space opportunity except you do one of this move :\n\n# One-two pass. I think I won’t explain it.\n\n# Click the right joy stick + direction.\n\nThere is manual control to let the player around you move. Unfortunately YOU HAVE TO MANUAL CONTROL TO LET THE OTHER PLAYER MOVE AND CREATING SPACE. There are two options in button setting : automatic or manual.\n\nYou set automatic if you want your directed player just run forward into the opposition goal. For example you click right joystick + bottom left. So that the bottom left player run direct forward into opposition.\n\nYou set manual if you want to control where the player go. When you set this you have to control two players. First the player holding the ball, second the player that need to go to.\n\nSteal the ball from AI opponent\n\nAfter googled it many times how to steal the ball from AI opponent, there are no elegant answer. The most pleasure answer is this :\n\nMastering the R2 and Patience.\n\nWhile the opponent attack you, what you do is just hold R2 + X. This will hold your guarding defence to stick into the holding ball opponent. This will reduce the opponent option to run through you. If you handle your other defence player right (can be done by add pressure [] or the other way is to patiently change the cursor everytime and made the opponent stalemate), It will help you better. Finally they (the opponent) are forced to just shoot blindly.\n\nBe careful. If you do this and there are other AI opponent want to help the holding ball opponent (HBO) by passing by, HBO can pass or even get a through ball that usually ended to be a Goal. The other AI’s opponent trick in this situation is to feint your defence. But keep your stance, your R2 + X. Keep it so that the defence can steal the ball.\n\nIt will be boring and tiresome sometime. So you’ll be tempted to release the R2 everytime. Against human opponent we won’t charge fault if we just rushed to the opponent by holding (just) X. The ball will be stolen most of the time. But against AI, that option won’t work.\n\nThe other combination of R2+X is this. Just call it Rizky Defence :p\n\nWhile you lock your opponent with R2 + X. Keep your R2, and change cursor. Then you will have the last player keep locking the opponent AI, while you had another player that you can control (with pad/stick). You can repeat the process. If you are used to two players, you actually can manage it to swarm the AI opponent up to 3 defence players. Make it impossible for the AI opponent to passing each other. Be careful to their winger though.\n\nI’m excited to hear that in 2013 there are better way to steal the ball 🙂\n\nOur AI defence players will swarm the AI winger opponent that run with the ball.\n\nAh, this? I had no solution at all. When you use 4 defensive player formation (4-4-2, 4-2-3-1, etc) You will often find this situation. It’s a situation that you found your defence players chasing the opponent winger player that running with ball in the side. I illustrate I stick my mid winger player with R1+X, and then I add the pressure by push the [] button. BUT, by default for some strange reason the Centre Back also running into the side chasing the ball that impossible to reach. At the time the opponent winger swarmed, the penalty box have already empty, oh… there are opponent striker there though. So he just cross it left our swarming defence saw that goal.\n\nPossible it’s solved by using 3 defensive line just like the problem below.\n\nSuck Defensive Line\n\nThe problem is illustrated by above picture. It will happen when you use the 4 defensive players formation, such as 4-4-2, 4-5-1, 4-2-3-1, 4-1-4-1, etc. The algorithm for the defensive line is very very wrong. Maybe some of you think that if you change the formation so that the full back (LB/RB) is moved a bit forward than the problem is solved. No, this strange defensive line will still happens.\n\nI found it by myself that there are three satisfying solutions :\n\n1. Manual offside trap\n\nYou can enable the offside trap, but it’s not enough. You can manually set the offside trap so that when the full backs in a bad shape. You can force the offside trap. (When you setting the movement with only pad, the left joystick will be able to do the shortcut like offside trap, swap player, and CB help with attack).\n\nWith this, at least your defensive line can be straight again. Be Careful. If you late to force the offside trap, the AI opponent sometime make a successfull through pass to the winger. In the illustration above, If you late to force the offside trap X2 can successfully through pass to X1. It will be a trouble because your full back has run forward, it will be far behind the winger to chase it..\n\n2. Sit deep, just break your defensive line\n\nIf your full back really really and reaaaaally at bad position. I will just break the defensive line. I will unlock the X2 and just run back to the penalty box. It will made the other defence also run into the penalty box. After that, just pray so that the Rizky Defence I described above works.\n\nSimilar to this solution, you can just set your formation with defensive line = 0 (Really really sit deep). It reduces the opportunity to find this problem.\n\n3. Train yourself with 3 defensive player formation\n\nSurprisingly the 3 centre back formation is really great! Just like Napoli, Udinese, Juventus, and Lazio in the Real World. The templates are 3-2-3-2, 3-1-4-2, and 3-2-2-3. I like the latter formation. It bring balance to the side and great defensive power. Also it allows us to launch a through pass into different channels.\n\nBecause of the issues of 4 defence players formations in 2012, it seems that the fullbacks is less useful for defence in that formation. So why don’t we use extra attacker rather than the vulnerable full backs if the 3 backs offer more stability?\n\nThe rest is depend on your tactic/formation. This formation need a dependable winger that has stamina, speed, and defensive ability to cover whole sides. It’s a classic formation that have been used several big teams in the past. In context of PES 2012, this formation won’t affected any at all by the strange defensive line I described above.\n\nThe weakness of this formation is of course the side of the pitch. If the opponent flood the tunnel(side of the pitch) with their players (whether it’s by formation or just the way opponent play), than the outside centre back will be forced to defend into the tunnels. When it happen the rest of centre backs will be to open and reluctant to attack. But if your centre backs is dependable (tall, strong, and has decent defensive tactic) then this problem is less a problem.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPro Evolution Soccer 2013 Demo\n\nAh, finally talk about this new exciting thing! They will be officially released at 21st September 2012 (Just a week before FIFA 2013 released >: ) hohoho).\n\nLet’s described it what I experienced in PES 2013 demo into list :\n\nThe movement is much more realistic, softer, and lighter than PES 2012.\n\nThe defensive line is GREAT! No more strange shape.\n\nThe goalkeeper movement is smarter, but still defeatable.\n\nWe can flick the ball then control the ball as we want it.\n\nOne-on-one against opponent player is more interesting. We can nutmeg them! (Pass the ball through their feet, then we run pass him)\n\nYeah, there are more manual option. The newest manual is manual move. We can set the high of the shoot or they say…\n\nUnlike PES 2012, the other player still make a run attempt to open the space. Well, you still can use the manual move if you want.\n\n“The Rizky Defence” is not really working, because the defence itself is already better :p\n\nThe R2+X is not really necessary because there is already X+X. We can steal the ball using X+X. It’s genius. (BUT I think they should add the mechanism to defend against it)\n\nBetter graphic (more or less).\n\nFox Engine initialization(?)\n\nWell…. another license-less PES just like before. Just wait and see for the patch :p\n\nLet’s see some tricks in PES 2013.\n\nSo how about you?\n\ncontinued…\n\nMy Countdown List\n\nParenthood 2012-09-11 0 Go On 2012-09-11 0 Sons of Anarchy 2012-09-11 0 X Factor (US), The 2012-09-12 1 Guys With Kids 2012-09-12 1 Glee 2012-09-13 2 Totally Biased with W Kamau Bell 2012-09-13 2 Awkward 2012-09-13 2 Downton Abbey 2012-09-16 5 Boardwalk Empire 2012-09-16 5 Bones 2012-09-17 6 Revolution 2012-09-17 6 Mob Doctor, The 2012-09-17 6 Survivor 2012-09-19 8 Up All Night (2011) 2012-09-20 9 Office, The 2012-09-20 9 Parks and Recreation 2012-09-20 9 Haven 2012-09-21 10 Treme 2012-09-23 12 2 Broke Girls 2012-09-24 13 Castle 2012-09-24 13 Dancing with the Stars 2012-09-24 13 How I met your mother, Season 8 2012-09-24 13 Mike and Molly 2012-09-24 13 Hawaii Five-0 (2010) 2012-09-24 13 Partners (2012) 2012-09-24 13 New Girl , Season 2 2012-09-25 14 NCIS: Los Angeles 2012-09-25 14 NCIS 2012-09-25 14 Ben and Kate 2012-09-25 14 Brickleberry 2012-09-25 14 Mindy Project, The 2012-09-25 14 Vegas 2012-09-25 14 Private Practice 2012-09-25 14 South Park 2012-09-26 15 Criminal Minds 2012-09-26 15 CSI: Crime Scene Investigation 2012-09-26 15 Middle, The 2012-09-26 15 Modern Family 2012-09-26 15 Law and Order: Special Victims Unit 2012-09-26 15 Animal Practice 2012-09-26 15 Neighbors, The (2012) 2012-09-26 15 Person of Interest 2012-09-27 16 Big Bang Theory, The , Season 6 2012-09-27 16 Two and a Half Men 2012-09-27 16 Greys Anatomy 2012-09-27 16 Scandal (US) 2012-09-27 16 CSI: NY 2012-09-28 17 Fringe , Season 5 2012-09-28 17 Kitchen Nightmares 2012-09-28 17 Blue Bloods 2012-09-28 17 Merlin 2012-09-29 18 Amazing Race, The 2012-09-30 19 American Dad! 2012-09-30 19 Revenge 2012-09-30 19 Homeland , Season 2 2012-09-30 19 Once Upon A Time , Season 2 2012-09-30 19 Good Wife, The , Season 4 2012-09-30 19 Dexter , Season 7 2012-09-30 19 Family Guy 2012-09-30 19 Bobs Burgers 2012-09-30 19 Mentalist, The , Season 5 2012-09-30 19 Simpsons, The 2012-09-30 19 Hart of Dixie 2012-10-02 21 Supernatural , Season 9 2012-10-03 22 Cleveland Show, The 2012-10-07 26 Arrow 2012-10-10 29 Chicago Fire 2012-10-10 29 Vampire Diaries, The , Season 5 2012-10-11 30 Whitney 2012-10-19 38 Community 2012-10-19 38 Nikita , Season 4 2012-10-19 38 Pretty Little Liars 2012-10-23 42 Burn Notice 2012-11-08 58 Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest 2012-12-31 111 .\n\nThe Great Fall TV Cram (2012 Edition): 7 Sophomore Shows to Catch Up On Now\n\nSummer is basically over, school is back in session, and fall premieres are right around the corner—but just because we’re all excited about the incoming freshman shows (and/or their potential for early cancellation) doesn’t mean we’re excused from keeping an eye on the season’s most promising sophomores. And thus it’s time for another preseason TV cram: Below, we make our case for why you should catch up on the seven shows whose second seasons we’re looking forward to the most. (Plus we’ll be covering all of them weekly… get up to speed now so you can talk about ’em with us once they return!)\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Asylum\n\nSeason 2 premieres Wednesday, October 17 at 10pm on FX\n\nCommitment: 12 highly addictive episodes\n\nWhy You Should Catch Up Now: If we’re being honest, you probably don’t have to watch the first season ofAmerican Horror Story, since Season 2 promises to be completely unrelated, story-wise. New characters, new setting, new horror genre entirely. But we’re guessing a major appeal for the upcoming Asylum season ofAHS will be seeing much of the same Season 1 cast playing new roles, and if Ryan Murphy‘s promises are to be believed, actors like Jessica Lange and Evan Peters will be playing “opposites” to their Season 1 counterparts, information that might inform our impressions of Season 2. And while viewers may not necessarily need to know what they all got up to in the Murder House, we think you may enjoy Murphy’s weird sensibility better if you know what kind of craziness to expect after Season 1. So, basically, consider this TV cram mostly just extra credit!\n\nCheat Sheet: Start with the pilot. You might be hooked immediately, but if not, skip to the two-part Halloween episode. If you’re not hooked after that, then this show may not be for you. —Price Peterson\n\nHomeland\n\nSeason 2 premieres Sunday, September 30 at 10pm on Showtime\n\nCommitment: A dozen thrilling, one-hour episodes that are as addictive as delicious crack.\n\nWhy You Should Catch Up Now: When Homeland was announced, I figured it would be good, but I didn’t know it would be THIS good. Easily the best new series of last season and definitely on my short list of the best overall series of last year, Homeland is a real post-9/11 drama that ditches flag-waving and stars and stripes in favor of paranoia and trust issues. The acting ensemble, led by Emmy favorite Claire Danes and Damian Lewis, is right up there with Breaking Bad‘s, but the show’s unpredictable twists and turns (best romance ever!) will leave you floored. I can’t recommend this show highly enough.\n\nCheat Sheet: You’re really doing yourself a disservice if you don’t watch all twelve episodes, so plow through ’em. And once you start, you’ll probably finish all of Season 1 in about three days. But I wouldn’t fault you for skipping Episode 9, “Crossfire.” —Tim Surette\n\nNew Girl\n\nSeason 2 premieres Tuesday, September 25 at 8pm on Fox\n\nCommitment: 24 half-hour episodes. Trust us, they’ll breeze right by.\n\nWhy You Should Catch Up Now: After the public’s wholehearted rejection of the “adorkable” meme, New Girl had to step up its game in order to remind us that it’s actually a really good TV show! Over the course of the season, Zooey Deschanel dialed back on her occasionally autistic-seeming quirks, and the result was a well-realized, extremely funny, and occasionally moving portrait of late 20-something life. Max Greenfield‘s Schmidt in particular stood out as one of the most singular TV characters of last year, and Schmidt’s burgeoning romance with the mind-numbingly gorgeous Cece (Hannah Simone) became the show’s most compelling through-line. New Girlis weird, inventive, and is as breezy and appealing as a Saturday bike ride. Get into it!\n\nCheat Sheet: Like most comedies, you probably don’t have to watch every episode. But here are the ones not to miss: “Pilot,” “Wedding,” “Jess and Julia,” “Fancyman (Part 1),” and especially “Normal,” in which the gang plays your new favorite drinking game, True American. (It is AMAZING.) —Price\n\nOnce Upon A Time\n\nSeason 2 premieres Sunday, September 30 at 8pm on ABC\n\nCommitment: 22 hour-long episodes, although there are plenty of skippable standalones if you just want to get caught up.\n\nWhy You Should Catch Up Now: The season finale left off with a devastating cliffhanger that’s been torturing fans all summer long. Still, we feel kind of guilty getting you hooked on Once Upon A Time, this show is basically crack for fantasy fans, romance fans, and/or anyone who likes cozy little towns. It’s the kind of world that inspires fan sites and marathon sessions and by now you’ve probably heard it’s from the same dreamboat team Kitsis and Horowitz who were behind Lost. The series at its best combines the familiar warmth of fairy tales with sinister threats and mind-bending dream logic, like a Disney version of Twin Peaks. At its worst, its still a loony WTF romp with a stellar cast. It’s impossible to follow a conversation about this show if you’re not watching, and Season 2 is sure to be a talker, so catch up while you still can.\n\nCheat Sheet: While it’s entirely possible that you’ll be so obsessed with the world you won’t want to miss a single minute, you can watch the following episodes as an “abbreviated version” of the first season: “Pilot,” “The thing You love Most,” “Snow Falls,” “The Shepherd,” “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,” “Desperate Souls,” “7:15 AM,” “Skin Deep,” “Hat Trick,” “The Return,” “The Stranger,” “An Apple Red As Blood,” and “Land Without Magic.” —Lily Sparks\n\nPerson of Interest\n\nSeason 2 premieres Thursday, September 27 at 9pm on CBS\n\nCommitment: Just one season! But it was kind of a long season, with 23 one-hour episodes.\n\nWhy You Should Catch Up Now: Going in, I didn’t think I’d like this show a whole lot—even with J.J. Abrams, Jonathan Nolan, Michael Emerson, and Jim Caviezel involved. It just had so many strikes against it: it had a procedural vibe, it was on CBS, and it was on CBS. But oh lordy it got really good really quick and became the biggest surprise of last season for me. The premise—a billionaire and a former special op team up with a super computer to help people in danger—is perfect for tackling the procedural aspect while also offering a rich, serialized backstory. Nolan brought his gritty Batman ideas to protagonist John Reese, one of 2011’s breakout characters, and Person of Interest exhibits a surprising amount of humor to keep things balanced. But it’s the relationship between the two main characters, and the guns and action followed by ’80s-style cheesy one-liners, that make the series so comforting.\n\nCheat Sheet: If you need a quick taste to determine whether the show is for you, watch “Pilot” and then “Cura Te Ipsum” (Episode 4). Other top episodes include “Judgment,” “Witness,” “Number Crunch,” “Super,” “Root Cause,” “Baby Blue” (for the lulz), and the final five episodes of Season 1—particularly the finale, which was one of the best episodes of any show last season. —Tim\n\nRevenge\n\nSeason 2 premieres Sunday, September 30 at 9pm on ABC\n\nCommitment: 22 deliriously awesome, hour-long episodes. But they’re all on Netflix Instant right now so holla!\n\nWhy You Should Catch Up Now: You’ve probably heard a lot about Revenge; it’s become a cultural soap addiction along the lines of Dynasty or Dallas. Based loosely on The Count of Monte Cristo, Emily Thorne returns to her small Hamptons town to get revenge on the Graysons, who framed her father for a terrorist act, and she sets out to systematically destroy everyone who assisted in her father’s downfall… and then things get complicated. Madeleine Stowe’s incredible depth as arch-bitch Victoria won her a Golden Globe, and the charisma and hilarity of Gabriel Mann anchors the show. It’s a soap opera on steroids, with all the production value of a film and moments of genuine dramatic tension, and once you plow through the episodes like potato chips you’ll be just like the rest of us: desperate for Season 2.\n\nCheat Sheet: You are not allowed to miss a single episode! Sorry, but Revenge is built on the premise that filler is antithetical to good TV. Every episode builds out the world or provides extremely necessary information. Plus, seriously, why would you want to miss any of the first season? Too much fun, and watching the episodes get more elaborate and better looking as the show actively gained a following is an enjoyable arc in and of itself. BUT IF YOU REALLY INSIST you can watch the premiere and skip directly to Episode 4, “Duplicity,” and watch from there. —Lily\n\nScandal\n\nSeason 2 premieres Thursday, September 27 at 9pm on ABC\n\nCommitment: One of last year’s midseason replacements, the first season of this under-the-radar drama is only seven episodes long. You can power through it over the course of a bottle of buttery Chardonnay.\n\nWhy You Should Catch Up Now: Shonda Rhimes‘ Scandal wants you to think it’s a tight, political thriller but it’s actually more like a super-captivating romance with the kind of sexual tension not seen sinceMoonlighting. As the title suggests, there is plenty of delving into mini scandals every week, thanks to its almost-procedural format, but the show takes pains to sidestep all the boring parts of politics and leave only the juiciest, most emotional, most adrenaline-pumping moments onscreen. Kerry Washington is incredible as main character Olivia Pope and even extras get powerful monologues. The writing and drama and soapiness have made this a secret favorite around the old Sparks household. And there’s a huge reveal coming up in the Season 2 premiere about one of the main characters, Quinn, so hurry up and watch so you can squeal along with the rest of us when all is (hopefully) revealed in Season 2.\n\nCheat Sheet: You don’t have to bother cheating, there’s only seven episodes, guys. But if you’re squeamish about Dexter-type torture, feel free to skip Episode 5, “Crash and Burn.”\n\nWhich returning fall shows are you most excited about? What should we be catching up on that’s not on this list?\n\nYes, Spoiler Detected. Ugh White Collar is on break (soon!), Breaking Bad has a an 8 episode break too. Suits also breaks on 10 eps. Each of them return on January. So what’s the news? Source\n\nBreaking Bad: How Much Cash Was in That Storage Unit?\n\nIn an exchange that seemed at least partially aimed at the internet, Skyler told Walt during Sunday’s Breaking Bad finale that he’d made too much money for one person to count, let alone launder. But the internet loves a challenge, and so it was probably only a matter of time before someone tried to come up with a better response to Walt’s inquiry of “How much is this?” than Skyler’s “I have no earthly idea.”\n\nKnowing that Walt gave a couple of duffle bags to Jesse—presumably the $5 million he was owed and not a cent more—you’d expect the total in the storage unit to be much higher. But how high? Walt previously turned down a $5 million payout from selling the methylamine to Declan and then worked for several months straight with Todd to cook for his own territory, for Declan’s territory, and for Lydia’s Czech Republic territory combined. That’s a lot of meth and lot of profit, even with Declan and Lydia taking a healthy piece of it.\n\nYesterday, a pair of tweets by Baseball America writer (and likely stats geek) JJ Cooper posited that Walt’s haul is somewhere between $17 and $25.5 million depending on the size of the denominations of the bills:\n\n“Random thought. If the stack of money on Breaking Bad this week was all $50s I estimate it would be around $17 million. Half 100s means 25.5”\n\n“Roughly a 15 x 15 x 15 cube. $5,000 per block for $50s RT @patsully: @jjcoop36 Gonna publish the math?”\n\nAnd a thread on Quora estimates larger dimensions for the cube, arriving at a total as high as $43.8 million in the (unlikely) event that every bundle in the block contained $5,000.\n\nHere’s a side-by-side look at Walt wrapping a bundle of twenties into a packet of $2,000, as seen in “Gliding Over All,” and a bundle of $100 bills that amounts to $10,000:\n\nSince Skyler mentioned mixed denominations, the total per bundle is somewhere in between. Depending on your opinion regarding the dimensions of the money cube, you can arrive at wildly different totals, from a floor of $15 million all the way up to $80 million.\n\nHere’s a side-by-side look at Breaking Bad‘s money pile and a pile that amounts to $205 million, from a 2007 drug raid in Mexico City.\n\nShow creator Vince Gilligan said in this week’s Breaking Bad Insider Podcast that $80 million might be a bit too high:\n\n“I asked prop master Mark Hansen, and he and his guys had tried, just for their own edification, to figure out how much that would be if it was roughly a half-and-half mix of twenties and fifties, and he guessed somewhere in the vicinity of eighty million dollars—eighty, eighty-five, ninety—that’s a lotta dough. I don’t know, we may have erred on the side of showmanship there instead of reality, I don’t know if [Walt] could’ve made that much that quickly.”\n\nSo how much would it take for Walt to walk away entirely? We know that Skyler was able to launder the money via the car wash when it was only in the single-digit millions territory. She likely waited to rent the storage unit until she was dealing with more than $10 million. So where did the total end up? I’d bet it’s somewhere north of $50 million.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Post your own calculations in the comments!\n\nWhite Collar “Ancient History” Review: Beta Banned\n\nWhite Collar S04E08: “Ancient History”\n\nFew things are as awkward as running into an ex, but in the world of White Collar it’s basically the opposite: It’s straight-up thrilling! See, in real life we tend to run into our exes in unglamorous places, like at grocery store, and we’re probably dressed in sweatpants. But in this show Neal runs into exes while wearing three-piece suits in five star hotels or swanky social events and usually the exes are international art thieves looking to ensnare him into elaborate double-cross cons. You know? Meanwhile WE would just be awkwardly explaining to our exes why we were staring at sheet cakes in a grocery store at 1 a.m. Anyway, this whole insanely-hot-criminal-mastermind-ex element is just one more reason why this is the best show through which to live vicariously!\n\nSo which gorgeous criminal mastermind from Neal’s past showed up in “Ancient History”? None other than Alex, the Greek femme fatale last seen in the Season 2 finale who’d basically been thrown under the bus, crime-wise, after the whole U-boat treasure thing first went down. She’d evidently been chilling in a Greek prison for a year and a half for attempting to steal ancient antiquities (do NOT call them antiques), but only days after her release had already become embroiled in some heavy-duty ancient artifact purloining. Not only did a heist Neal had infiltrated feel like Alex was somehow involved, she explicitly sought him out afterward using her ol’ yellow-origami-flower trick. It turned out she was indeed in town, which meant that the FBI now needed Neal to figure out her involvement in the new scheme. Or something. Did it matter? Neal and Alex were suddenly hanging out again!\n\nMeanwhile Mozzie had grown ultra-jealous after Neal received a secret Beta videotape which had been posthumously sent to him by Ellen on the occasion of her death. Neal decided that he only wanted to watch the tape with Sam, and not Mozzie, even though Mozzie owned A LOT of Beta players! I mean, that’s just rude right there. So that’s when Mozzie resorted to desperate measures: He contacted Peter to help him spy on Neal. (But only after generously bestowing upon Peter the gift of a 2-ton stone coin from his travels.) So yeah, our favorite odd couple teamed up to somehow infiltrate Sam and Neal’s relationship, as a couple of jealous, jilted besties are wont to do. But this led to a situation in which Mozzie got the wrong address for Sam’s apartment and ended up snooping around ALEX’s apartment. Which was being staked out by Peter and led to HIM joining Mozzie in Alex’s bathroom just before Alex and Neal arrived back from one of their high-chemistry banter-dates. It was all as farcical as it was HANDSOME.\n\nAfter Alex discovered that Neal had been infiltrating her goings-on, they understandably had a falling out. As did Neal, Peter, and Mozzie when Neal found out what they’d been doing. Seriously, Neal looked SO MAD at them. (Aw, I hate it when they fight.) But eventually Neal came around a bit after it became clear that he’d been unnecessarily keeping secrets also, and he agreed to help Peter continue with the Alex case. In their ruse, Neal would pretend to win back Alex’s trust by helping her knock over a local museum (the FBI agreed to this because it would lead them to Alex’s shadowy boss). And, in one of the broader schemes ever featured on White Collar, Neal impersonated BANKSY and got the museum to not only allow him to spray paint their walls, but also close it to the public AND shut off its security cameras. All that without even attempting a British accent. And you know what? It sounded plausible to me! Seriously, the art world is nuts. I wouldn’t put it past that gallery owner to be so gullible.\n\nThe twist was that ONCE AGAIN the heist was interrupted by the NYPD, meaning that someone aside from the undercover participants wanted the thieves to be caught. As it turned out Alex herself wanted the heists to be thwarted so that the police would confiscate all the valuables into their storage locker and she could just bust in and take them all at once! (Which, haha, okay show.) So yeah, it did appear that Alex was using Neal just as much as he’d used her. And because this was White Collar, just because someone is on the run doesn’t mean she won’t sneak into your apartment for one last farewell conversation. Sure beats an awkward goodbye in the grocery store dessert aisle, am I right?\n\nFinally, because we can only progress the over-arching story with the tiniest of baby-steps, the episode ended with Neal agreeing to watch his Beta tape with Mozzie and Peter after all. So he pressed play, and… CREDITS! Oh,White Collar, you big tease. Another solid episode in what’s turning out to be a solid season. (“Solid” is the correct term here, right? Nothing mind-blowing, just super dependable.) Only two more episodes until hiatus!\n\nAnd now some pictorial observations for you guys:\n\n… Do we like Diana’s ponytail?\n\n… Who WAS this guy? Can he be a new character please?\n\n… Whoa, it actually RAINS in New York?\n\n… Y’all gonna tune in next week for THIS?:\n\nThought so!"
