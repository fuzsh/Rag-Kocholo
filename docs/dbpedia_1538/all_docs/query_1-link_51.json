I was trying to get a physical copy when the preorder was up on the dynamite website , but never went through. So I was very and I mean very happy to see the Amazon carrying the digital comic for a $1.99 . Which is a dollar to two dollars less than what you would pay for physical copy of the first edition .\n\nI love that it starts off as season four right after the last episode ended Urian with the mad Max type of futuristic end of the world vibe . I appreciate the fact that everything is censored end the way the show should've been when you bought it digitally your devices, and/or DVD when it was a television show. And not censored . Anyways I cannot wait till the 30th for issue number two to come out along with three and four"
