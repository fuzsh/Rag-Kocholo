Simply put, the only thing that's not shocking about Brickleberry is its TV-MA rating. As far as the content goes, if you can imagine it, it probably has a place in the outrageous plot that attempts to find humor in alcoholism, racial profiling, and nontraditional sexual appetites. From the African-American ranger who's playing the affirmative-action card to collect a paycheck without an honest day's work to a masculine woman who drops hints about her bedroom tendencies and gets audibly aroused in the company of a certain attractive coworker, this is an office pool unlike any you've ever seen.

The show's anything-goes style undoubtedly will entertain some adults, but it's way too much for kids. While parents can reconcile its messages with how the real world works, teens won't be able to do the same because they lack the necessary life experiences, which means the messages they get will suggest something entirely different. Bottom line? Keep this extremely irreverent (and purposely offensive) show as your own guilty pleasure, if it's your thing, and find something that gives a better impression of adulthood for your impressionable teen.
