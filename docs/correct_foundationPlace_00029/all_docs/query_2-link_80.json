        "text": "Tom Siebel, founder, CEO and chairman of customer relationship management software giant Siebel Systems Inc. in San Mateo, Calif., this week talked with users about the company’s status and its direction during the next several years. He also took some time out from the Siebel User Week 2002 in Los Angeles to talk to Computerworld.\n\nCan you comment on Siebel’s current financial situation? Last quarter there was a $92 million loss (see story). Let’s call a spade a spade. We have $2 billion in cash and have been generating a half-billion a year in free cash. Does that look like an ongoing concern to you? At the end of the year in 2000 we had a half-billion more than in the beginning. In 2001 we had a half-billion more than in the beginning of the year. This year we have $400 million more.\n\nYour thoughts on the recent Nucleus Research Inc. report that indicated a majority of users weren’t getting return on investment from Siebel applications (see story)? Let’s look first of all at the [fact that] a number of these customer who were quoted in there are pretty upset that the comments were misrepresented and taken out of context. The work was methodologically unsound, statistically insignificant and factually incorrect. Look at some facts [it asserted]: The average per-user license fee [for Siebel] is $11,000 per user. Nobody in history ever paid $11,000 [for software]. This [report’s release] was one of the best pieces of guerrilla marketing [I’ve seen] in my 25 years in the industry. I was a little bit impressed.\n\nDid your comments during your keynote on integration and simplification reflect a major shift in strategy (see story)? It’s just a change in the customers. They’re interested in ROI. … We do these surveys and these people [interviewed] are suggesting they are getting a 12-month return on investment and increases in revenue between 8% and 12%, depending on how you count it. Another way to boost that ROI is to have some effect on the cost [of applications].\n\nEnterprise application integration is the biggest segment of the IT budget right now. That’s what UAN [Universal Application Network] is all about. And so we put the bulk of the development in the past year and alliances to build up UAN to dramatically lower the cost of these applications. The investment might not be as glamorous as in new applications, yet this is where everyone is spending their money. The enterprise applications vendors have done a horrible job of servicing their clients. They’ve left them big [integration] problems.\n\nHave you done enough to make the software less expensive, less difficult to install? I think so. Look at the economic returns customers get. Somebody is doing a pretty good job. In many ways, we’ve been our own worst critics. I think there is an opportunity for a big breakthrough in the cost of installation, configuration, deployment and testing [of applications] and we have some ideas we think will be very, very innovative. … We’re not so much fixing a problem as making the applications better and better and better.\n\nHow does Siebel compete on one hand against the big software suite companies such as SAP AG or PeopleSoft Inc. and on the other against smaller competitors like Salesforce.com? I am the largest enterprise applications software company, in terms of license revenue. These big competitors might not be that big. There is no market for integrated software. There is a market for accounting systems, manufacturing systems, human resources systems and CRM systems. Nobody ever set out to buy integrated software. I sell more CRM software than these companies sell integrated products. How many large customers does Oracle have in CRM? How many large customers are live on SAP, and they’ve been selling [CRM] since 1995?\n\nAs for Salesforce.com, [its CEO] Marc Benioff is one of the greatest media figures in history. He’s able to spin a great story. … [Salesforce.com] is not a factor in this space."
