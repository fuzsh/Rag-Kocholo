        "text": "Tom Siebel used his own software to anticipate the recession months ahead of rivals and economists, and braced for the worst in 2001. Now he's betting on a comeback.\n\nyear ago Thomas M. Siebel was revving up for the best year of his life. Sales and profits at Siebel Systems, the sales-automation software shop he founded in 1993, had doubled for the seventh straight year, to $1.8 billion and $258 million, respectively. Siebel had a 70% share of its core market, and its stock had shot up 50-fold since being offered to the public in 1996. He laid plans to double yet again in 2001, to $4 billion in sales.\n\nBut in February, a month before the recession began, Tom Siebel saw something that horrified him. At home in his sweats at 6 o'clock one morning, he logged on to his company's internal Web site to begin his morning ritual: a review of the sales force's forecasts for the quarter. For the first time, the figures laid out before him in crystalline pixels of blue, red and black showed that hundreds of potential deals, ranging in value from a few thousand dollars to several million each, had suddenly stalled. The backlog of pending sales had declined from just days before. Worst of all, individual sales reports were laden with ominous phrases: \"budget eliminated,\" \"all IT spending frozen,\" \"decision deferred to following quarter.\"\n\nAll of it could mean only one thing: a crash was coming. \"The recession was apparent. Here we were, pedal to the metal, and suddenly the pipeline looked really bad,\" says Siebel, 49. Hours later he met with his six senior executives and gave them the stunning news. He demanded an overhaul of the 2001 growth strategy, set in ink only weeks before. Then he dispatched them to visit key customers and close pending deals before the rest of the world could discover where the economy was headed. Siebel himself visited nine accounts in the following few weeks.\n\nAnd on Feb. 27 Tom Siebel warned Wall Street analysts, in a conference call, of a possible tech \"depression.\" He began bracing for pain, laying off 800 employees, cutting off three moneylosing business units, cutting budgets for travel, marketing and hiring--and lopping 20% off the pay of the top brass.\n\n\"By week one of April, we turned a $4 billion company back into a $2.6 billion company,\" Siebel says. \"We turned this Titanic around.\" The first quarter of 2001 was bad, but not devastating, for Siebel, with license revenue coming in at $335 million, off $30 million from the fourth quarter of 2000, its first-ever such sequential decline--though still up 72% from the first quarter of 2000. Wall Street pretty much took it in stride.\n\nEconomists took nine months to confirm that a recession had descended last March. The software that gave Siebel an early jump on them and his rivals is all the more compelling for what it shows today. Tom Siebel now says the recession bottomed out at the end of November--and that one hell of a comeback looms.\n\n\"I believe we will see the information technology market pick up in Q1 and Q2 and the economy at large by Q3 or Q4,\" Siebel declares.\n\nWhat? Silicon Valley still reels from the starkest downturn in its four-decade history. Hundreds of dot-coms have gone under. Some 600,000 tech workers have been fired. Real estate prices are depressed, restaurants are empty and luxury cars tool down the freeways with a sign of the times in the windows: \"For Sale by Owner.\" A trillion dollars has been lost in telecom stocks. Several leading indicators, from chip orders to hardware sales, suggest things won't improve soon. Some 55% of tech managers say spending will stay flat or decline in 2002, says Goldman Sachs.\n\nNot to worry, Tom Siebel says: \"The door has opened.\" In November and December Siebel reps hit clients with \"far more product evaluations, demonstrations and visits than in the entire third quarter, and the rate of deal closings was much greater.\" All of which, of course, is meticulously tracked by his software. Better yet, he says, Siebel is a good leading indicator for the rest of tech. \"Software is always the decision that is made first. The hardware and services follow.\"\n\nHis forecast could presage a powerful rebound in the economy, if not the stock market. The high-tech sector led the way in the wondrous economic boom of the last decade, suffered the most in the 2000-01 bear market, and by rights should lead the economy back up. With tech now accounting for half of all business capital spending in the U.S., Silicon Valley must revive before a recovery can take hold.\n\nOthers in high tech are betting with him. In telecom, entrepreneurs are buying billion-dollar fiber networks for pennies on the dollar (see story, p. 80); in e-tailing, founder Scott Blum just paid 17 cents a share to buy back Buy.com, insisting it can turn a profit (see p. 86); in software, PeopleSoft is pulling off a stunning turnaround (p. 90).\n\nAt Siebel the advertising budget for the first quarter will rise. The company is recruiting again, and it is even expanding its backshop, buying up newly vacated data centers in Utah. It doesn't occur to Tom Siebel to ask: Um, what if I'm wrong? His software is talking to him, and he believes it.\n\n\"Tom instruments his business better than anyone I've ever seen, and he manages accordingly,\" says Robert Austrian, a Banc of America Securities analyst who throttled back his optimism on software firms after hearing Siebel last February. \"He was way ahead in seeing the downturn, and he put the screeching brakes on.\"\n\nIf Siebel's forecast is premature, the risks to his company are high. This year Oracle, SAP and PeopleSoft are all intensifying their push into Siebel's core market. Worse still, license revenue in Siebel's market, once expected to grow 30% a year through 2005, now is forecast to expand just 6% annually in the next four years, to $5 billion, says Gartner. If Tom Siebel gets crunched between slow growth and competition, his shareholders will pay the price. So will he: He still owns 15% of the company, worth $1.9 billion.\n\nBlazing trails has been a hallmark of Tom Siebel's career. He was born in 1952 to an upper-middle-class family in the tony Chicago suburb of Wilmette, Ill., the sixth of seven children. Tom's father, a corporate lawyer, must have seen something special in him--or some special need. Tom, then age 15, was the only one to be sent off to the Shattuck Military School in Faribault, Minn.\n\n\"I wasn't an exceptional student,\" says Siebel, who still bears traces of a military bent for order and discipline. \"It was a great adventure. It forced me to think and act independently at a young age.\"\n\nHe earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1975, spent a few years baling hay and doing construction work in Idaho, then returned to the campus in 1979. By 1983 he had earned two master's degrees, one in business and one in computer science. His master's thesis, which extolled the virtues of algorithms that might make databases run faster, got him recruited to Larry Ellison's Oracle Corp., then a young vendor of relational databases.\n\nSiebel was 31 years old when he joined Oracle in 1984. A year later he was named salesman of the year, vaulting past colleagues on the strength of his deeper knowledge of the technical intricacies of the product. Siebel quickly won fame as the highest-paid salesman in the Valley.\n\nHis greatest contribution came in 1987, when he showed that Oracle's multimillion-dollar databases could be better sold over the phone than by reps pressing the flesh. Siebel designed Oasis (Oracle Automated Sales Information System), which streamlined lead-generation and accounting for Oracle's sales force. Soon Siebel's call center, Oracle's first, was the largest revenue unit. In 1988 Siebel was voted Oracle's Most Valuable Player.\n\nBut later, when Siebel proposed to Ellison that Oracle sell Oasis to its own customers, Ellison balked. In 1990 Siebel walked with millions of dollars in Oracle shares, but sold them shortly after. He's lucky he did: A year later Oracle was blighted by an accounting scandal that shaved billions off its market value and nearly bankrupted it.\n\nMeanwhile Siebel and wife Stacey (herself a former Oracle rep) led a new life of skiing and travel. It didn't last long. Just months into his sabbatical, Siebel accepted an offer to run multimedia outfit Cayenne Systems. Another 18 months later, in 1992, Siebel sold newly renamed Gain Technology to Sybase for $110 million, netting himself $10 million more.\n\nIt still wasn't enough. In July 1993, with the notion of an Oasis-like product still gnawing at him, Siebel rented cheap offices in East Palo Alto and founded Siebel Systems. He spurned offers of venture capital and funded it himself, letting a few former Oracle pals and others put up to $100,000 each, including lawyer James Gaither and brokerage titan Charles Schwab (both still sit on the board). \"I told them the only consolation was that [if we flopped] I would lose more money than they would,\" says Siebel.\n\nSiebel named the firm after himself not out of self-aggrandizement, he says with a straight face, but because \"I believed that my reputation would draw talent.\" It did. Oracle marketer Patricia House, now 46, joined as a cofounder (now retired, she still owns a 1.5% stake worth $190 million). David Schmaier, 37, left Oracle's struggling applications business to join Siebel in 1994. He now heads all product divisions and is the de facto successor, though Siebel says he will run the show for many more years.\n\nFrom the beginning Siebel Systems would be different. \"Serious and professional,\" says Siebel. \"No polo shirts, no dogs, no Frisbee in the halls.\" No extravagances, either. Nearly every penny of the company's $1.4 million in startup capital went to developing the software. For months Siebel, House, Schmaier, four engineers and an office manager did their work at a set of $60 metal folding tables. Despite the spartan office setting, everyone wore business suits. They placed calls to would-be clients like Ingram Micro, Wells Fargo and Pfizer to solicit advice on their future product and found the interest was huge. Siebel Systems was in the black from the day it sold its first product in June 1995.\n\nSiebel went public in June 1996. On their first day Siebel shares zoomed from an offering price of $17 to $31, valuing the company at $477 million and Tom Siebel's then-42% stake at $200 million. That year it had 213 employees, $39 million in sales and net income of $5 million.\n\nFor the next four years the company grew at a torrid pace. At the end of 2000 Siebel had 7,400 people in two three-building office complexes in San Mateo, Calif. and 133 offices in 40 countries.\n\nThen the bottom fell out. By early 2001 it looked as though Siebel's wild ride was over. Last year its sales growth slowed from 121% to a comparatively paltry 30%. Siebel missed First Call's earnings estimates in September, and by then its stock price had plunged 60%. Shares now trade around $28, or 56 times trailing earnings. The company is expected to close 2001 with $2 billion in revenue and net income of $235 million, off 9%.\n\nThat he saw the recession coming last February certainly gave Tom Siebel a head start on his competitors, but that is only half the story. Siebel's ability to redirect a then-$22 billion (market cap) global enterprise in weeks owes to a sophisticated set of management tools, all engineered around one thing: knowledge.\n\nUsing Siebel's own sales software, each of its 1,500 sales agents files weekly progress reports on current deals. They handicap the odds of a \"close\" in such meticulous terms as: \"5%, opportunity qualified\" or \"15%, proposal presented,\" all the way up to 100% when a contract is signed. The reports include details like date of last contact with a buyer, known competitive bidders and when a rival has been eliminated.\n\nThe data are funneled into a \"Flash Report,\" which is what Tom Siebel was reviewing on that fateful morning last February. Siebel found that \"close\" handicaps, which had always increased quickly, hadn't budged for days. Revenue targets for individual deals, which were usually steadfast (Siebel does no discounting), had suddenly shrunk. The slowdown had begun.\n\nThe data tracking provides fast insight but also stokes performance. By day 7 of each quarter, Tom Siebel posts his three-month objectives for the company on the Siebel intranet. By day 10, each of Siebel's 465 department heads is required to post corresponding goals for his or her respective unit. By day 15, Siebel employees--to a man--post their personal goals for the period on the portal. There they can be viewed at whim by anyone, the founder included. Fulfillment of these objectives figures into performance reviews. Every six months the bottom 5% are given walking papers.\n\nAs soon as he saw the end coming last winter, Siebel jumped on the intranet, retracted the 16 growth objectives he had placed there weeks earlier and replaced them with 3 simple and devastatingly clear ones: Keep customers happy, keep cash coming in and protect market share. Within six weeks all 8,000 employees tacked over to this new, bleaker outlook. \"Everyone always knows the goal and how they fit in,\" he says.\n\nSiebel insists on meticulous product knowledge, too. While most software companies train mainly their sales staffs, Siebel demands that every single employee--including secretaries and security guards--complete at least five Web-hosted tutorials on Siebel products, every quarter. Tutorials end in exams. Workers must score 90% or higher to pass. The test results, logged into digital personnel files, also figure into quarterly performance reviews.\n\nSiebel is just as disciplined about his external relationships with customers. He uses a rigorous third-party auditing service to let customers rate his company's performance every quarter. In an industry known for hyping \"vaporware,\" Siebel Systems has an enviable 90% customer satisfaction level. It had better. This stuff is expensive: typically $300,000 to $600,000 for a license that might serve 100 sales reps.\n\nHalf of the $1 billion in license revenue that Siebel booked in 2001 came from new customers. Not bad, considering IT spending across all industries sank through the floor. The auditing service proved so effective, in fact, that Siebel now resells the auditing system in its new software release, Siebel 7, which it launched in November.\n\nCustomer love is nice, but it can't offset flagging demand. Even if the economy picks up as Tom Siebel predicts, he will be hard pressed to show the rapid growth to which his investors have grown accustomed. With $1.5 billion in cash, Siebel could easily buy its way into new markets, acquiring, say, PeopleSoft.\n\nPeopleSoft, which dominates the market for personnel management software, is run by Siebel's former Oracle colleague, Craig Conway (see p. 90), and is rumored to be on the block. Conway denies the company is for sale, and Siebel scoffs at the idea that he needs to buy his growth. \"PeopleSoft has been offered to us,\" he says carefully. \"We didn't consider it very seriously. Why would I want to go into that business? It's a crummy market that is not growing, and it is very competitive.\"\n\nTo prove his point, Siebel waves a graphic that illustrates how his sector--software for sales automation and customer service--will grow faster than software for personnel departments or software for enterprise-resource planning, a market dominated by Germany's SAP.\n\n\"I will let the other guys beat each other's heads together in those markets while I run in this one,\" he says dryly. Besides, he adds, the market for his products is still a \"green field.\" Siebel's internal research suggests that just 3% of companies with $1 billion or more in sales use sales automation or customer service software today. (Verifying this unstintingly optimistic estimate with any outside observer is difficult.)\n\nBut Tom Siebel is eyeing forays into new areas to keep the company growing. The Siebel 7 release includes a new suite he has dubbed \"employee relationship management.\" It includes products like Siebel Learning and Siebel Performance Management, based on the very tools that Siebel has used to manage his own organization so effectively for years. \"The market is huge,\" Siebel argues. \"Any enterprise that has employees is a potential customer.\"\n\nWith his existing 3,000 accounts apparently happy, Siebel expects 90% of them to upgrade to the new Siebel 7 suite within 12 months. If he is right about that, Siebel Systems could very well return to thriving growth. And if Tom Siebel is right about his software's role as a leading indicator for the rest of tech, you can't blame even his bitterest enemies if they end up rooting for him. Siebel knows: High tech is on a comeback. Remember you heard it here first."
