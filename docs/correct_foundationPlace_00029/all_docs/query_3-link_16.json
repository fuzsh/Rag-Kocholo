Siebel\n\nSiebel Systems\n\n1993–2004\n\nSiebel Systems\n\n1993–2004\n\nIndustry: Computers & Electronics\n\nEra: 1990\n\nSiebel founded his firm in 1993 as a provider of sales force automation systems. Though his firm quickly became a major player in sales force automation, Siebel Systems achieved tremendous growth when its software was applied to customer service functions. In many ways, Siebel was a pioneer in the development of systems which have the potential to deliver the oft-heralded, yet mostly untapped potential of customer relationship management. As corporations sought to better service their customers, they often turned to Siebel Systems which was twice named one of the fastest growing companies by Fortune (in 1999 and 2000)."
