        "text": "[Honan] Do you have any views on the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, and I want to go even more broad on that. China has its own set of regulations on AI it’s looking at. If Europe has its own set of regulations, China has another. Pennsylvania has one. California has another. How, as someone running an AI company, do you try to operate around the country and internationally with this patchwork of [regulations]? “China is a very simple problem. We don’t do business in China. We just decided when our offices were being swarmed by Chinese SOEs with their cameras in 2014, 2015, we just decided to run and not walk. I’ve done a lot of business in China in previous lives, and decided I feel very comfortable with that decision.\n\n“I do a lot of business in Europe. I mean, our largest customer is Shell. Shell is realizing, I think, about $2 billion a year from our application across their entire value chain, including integration of renewables. This particular EU AI act you’re referencing I’m not familiar with, but I’m certainly familiar with GDPR, with which we’re complying.”\n\n[GDPR] is already causing problems for OpenAI. I think in Italy they used it to get OpenAI to make concessions in terms of what they do with age and in terms of getting information out of their systems. “Let’s look at data sovereignty. Some of these laws, they’re just criminalizing behavior. You have a data sovereignty law in Germany.\n\n“…Shell, for example, [and] our European customers make it very clear: they tell us the regulations they want us to comply with and we comply.”\n\n[Audience member] Do you think about how you can empower others who may be in other rooms [outside the C-suite] and may have less experience but a better perspective than you on ethical AI? “I think you’re asking a very important question. Today, my company has 1,000 people. Soon, it will be 10,000 — in Madrid and Munich and Muncie and Moline.\n\n“Before we do any project, we sit down with the CEO, CTO, chief data officer, and the customer representative and have a discussion. Is it doable? Can we solve it? Is it ethical? Is there a high-value proposition there? And we do this centrally. Now, when we’re 10,000 people in 29 countries, we’re not going to be able to do that. So, how do we distribute that decision-making and not end up with a situation like that was kind of a disaster, like [IBM’s] Watson, if you remember that? You had a bunch of customers who didn’t know what they were asking, or a bunch of sales people who said no matter the question was the answer was yes. And, they had 800 failed systems around the world.\n\n“So, this is a question I really face as it relates to the scaling of my enterprise, and I haven’t figured it out yet.”\n\n[Honan] I also think part of that question was how do you get a more diverse, under-represented set of voices in these bigger rooms? “We believe in diversity as much as anyone does. The people we have in our company is a highly diverse population of men, women, people from all around the world. Our company is not white males from the Midwest. I can assure you of that.”\n\n[Honan] You’ve discussed flaws in proposed AI regulations. Are there any you’re aware of that would work. What do you think good regulation would look like? “I think the right to be forgotten is a real good place to start. That looks like a no-brainer.”\n\n[Audience member] You spoke about human-computer interaction with the browser. The same concept can be extended to Alexa, Siri, and Hi Google in the sense that could be a voice-to-text layer that feeds to, maybe, a ChatGPT engine in the back. What’s your take on that? “We could have done this with our first generation of systems. It just would have come off as a little hokey with all the Alexa ads. Yes, a lot of it will be voice. But we chose in our first generation…to use text because it wasn’t quite so hokey. But unquestionably voice will be core.”\n\n[Audience member] I’m from Presidio Ventures, we’re a venture capital company. In insurance, we’re seeing a great deal of regulations starting to shape — mostly coming up with relatively straight-forward framework focused mostly on transparency — trying to show how algorithms calculated a policy. The other thing we’re seeing at the international level, we are starting to see a couple worlds forming. A China-related access to AI and then a non-[China] access. We see a similar world emerging with AI being drawn as a battle line. So, we see some natural and unnatural stimulation for regulation. What’s your comment on that? “We are developing two different worlds. I think we’re in open, hostile warfare as it relates to AI with China, and I’m not certain we’re winning. As it relates to these statements for ethical AI, we see on the inside covers of all these companies that will remain unnamed… and that [claim they] are not perpetuating cultural bias. And then the next thing we see in their products, it’s about neural networks and deep learning. Hey guys, they’re lying. They’re just lying through their teeth and they know they’re lying on the inside cover of their annual report.\n\n“There’s nothing explainable about deep learning, nothing explainable about neural networks and nothing explainable as… we get into generative AI and these large language models and pre-trained generative transformers. I think most of these ethical statements are a bunch of lies.”"
