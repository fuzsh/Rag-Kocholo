        "text": "Couple's gift will help children of Montana law officers\n\nHELENA - High-tech executive Thomas Siebel and his wife, Stacey, on Wednesday donated $1 million to the Montana Community Foundation to provide annual scholarships for children of Montana Highway Patrol uniformed officers and state game wardens.\n\nThe money will be invested by the foundation, and the newly created Dearborn Ranch Scholarship Fund will provide 40 scholarships a year, worth $2,500 apiece, to children of patrol officers and game wardens to attend a Montana school of higher education. The foundation will administer the program, and associations of patrol officers and game wardens will select the scholarship winners based on academic merit and leadership potential.\n\nAs a recent part-time residents of the state, Thomas Siebel said he and his family have been impressed by the work of the officers of the Montana Highway Patrol and the game wardens from the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.\n\n\"These are, in our experience in the state of Montana, incredibly professional, dedicated people committed to service that have made enormous personal sacrifices to contribute to the community, to the betterment of our lives and to the environment,\" he said. \"It is a great, great pleasure to be able to form this scholarship to contribute to families as they educate their children.\"\n\nSiebel, chairman and chief executive officer of Siebel Systems Inc. of San Mateo, Calif., and his wife, own two large Montana ranches, totaling 135,000 acres. They bought the Dearborn Ranch, northwest of Wolf Creek, in 1998 and the N Bar Ranch, near Grass Range, in 2000. He said they operate them as working ranches, spending $10 million on them combined yearly and hiring 500 contractors for construction, fencing, environmental cleanup, riparian and wildlife development, he said. Siebel said they have 2,500 pairs of cows and calves.\n\nThe check was handed over at a ceremony in the governor's reception room. Gov. Judy Martz thanked the Siebels for their generosity.\n\n\"These are real people that care about other people, and the valuable asset that they bring to the state of Montana in their philanthropic giving is something we don't often see,\" Martz said.\n\nThe governor added, \"The Highway Patrol officers and the game wardens, they're faced with incredible challenges each and every day of their life as they walk the face of this wonderful state. So in establishing this program, you're honoring the sacrifices that they make every day to serve others.\"\n\nThomas Siebel particularly praised Highway Patrol Officer Frank Nowakowski of Craig, and Game Warden Bruce Knutson of Cascade. Siebel said he and Nowakowski discussed the possibility of setting up the fund last summer while kicking around gravel in the corrals of the Dearborn Ranch last summer.\n\nSaid Nowakowski: \"This is just a wonderful, selfless act on Tom's part.\" The patrol officer said his family, like those of other officers, struggles financially to put their children through college, and the scholarship would be a great help.\n\nKnutson called the generosity of the gift \"immeasurable\" and echoed the comments about the need for such a program for families of the state officers.\n\nA former top salesman for Oracle, Thomas Siebel founded Siebel Systems in 1993, and he was ranked as the 110th richest American by Forbes magazine last year with a net worth of $1.3 billion. Former Gov. Marc Racicot is on the company's board of directors.\n\nSiebel Systems is the world's leading supplier of e-business application software. It has 7,400 employees in 33 countries and last year reported net income of $254.6 million on revenue of more than $2 billion.\n\nSiebel has donated $32 million to his alma mater, the University of Illinois to build the Siebel Center for Computer Science. And he donated $3 million to Stanford University to create a new endowed chair in business leadership to be shared by the law and graduate business schools.\n\nAsked if he had any plans to move part of Siebel Systems to Montana, Siebel said he has no current plans to do that because most of the company's expansion is outside the United States.\n\nYou must be logged in to react.\n\nClick any reaction to login.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
