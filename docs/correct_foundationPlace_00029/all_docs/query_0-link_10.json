COPl'RIGHT BY HENRY CAREY BAIRD & CO. 1884. ^.W^ COLLINS, PRINTER. PREFACE Considering the importance of the leather industry, it seems strange that up to the present time it should in technical literature have been so much neglected. There is not in England nor is there in America a single current book broadly treating all the branches of this subject, and the object of the present volume is fully to explain the details of manufacturing all kinds of leather in common use, and produced from hides and skins by the agency of the usual tanning substances. The author has not been satisfied to make use of the matter found in obsolete books, but has preferred to present a view of the state of the art as it to-day exists in the United States. The tools, machines, and in fact nearly all the mechanical appliances illustrated in the present treatise are of American origin, and in common use in the numerous tanneries and leather-finishing shops of the country. The collection, compilation, and collation of the vast amount of technical and detailed information attainable relating to the various processes, and to the construction of the numerous ma- chines herein described, have required almost herculean labor. But the work has been greatly aided by many of the leading tanners and curriers of the United States, who have not only placed at the author's disposal every opportunity for personal observation, but have promptly and courteously responded to IV PREFACE. his letters when containing requests for information. It is doubtful if such facilities as have been extended to him would be granted to a like professional writer on technical subjects in any other country in tlje world. The enormous development of American leather manufactur- ing industries is a source of much congratulation. There are of course in this manufacture, as in all others, times of depression, but the natural facilities for obtaining the raw material, the great ingenuity of our people, and the steady increase in the export demand, added to the large home consumption of leather, are certain to keep the United States in the position of the leading leather-producing country of the world. The invention and employment of a large number of mechan- ical appliances have done much to stimulate and cheapen leather production in the times just passed, and those manufacturers who have clung to the old-fasliioned metliods of tanning and finishing leather by hand have found their business absorbed by more enterprising firms. Sucli results were only natural, and it is therefore in the future very desirable that those now in the business should keep fully abreast of the improvements in the art. When a machine or process has, after fair trial and investigation, proved to be an improvement upon old methods, it is simply suicidal to a busi- ness not to employ it. Every new method or contrivance is not necessarily an improvement: but the success of small tanners and curriers in the future lies solel}^ in the discrimi- native adoption of labor-saving machines and time-saving processes. It is among those who j)roduce leather on a small scale that many chemical experiments in depilating, bating, and tanning could be conducted without serious loss or inconvenience, and it is urgently recommended that in the future more attention be given to this subject than it has received in the past. Every PREFACE. V process or machine used in leather manufacture that has been patented in the United States since 1790 to the close of the year 1883 is mentioned in this work. Ten volumes of the size of the present one would not have been sufl&cient to describe them all in full, but a printed copy of any patent issued since the year 1866 will, on receipt of twenty -five cents, be sent by the Com- missioner of Patents to any address in the postal union. The patents issued prior to 1866 require to be copied in manuscript, and are therefore charged for by the United States Government according to the number of words contained in them. Thus there is by means of the present volume placed at the disposal of any person who desires it, an opportunity to become fully acquainted with every step and improvement in leather manu- facture made in the United States during nearly a century. The author desires to acknowledge the assistance which he has received from Dr. Thomas Antisell, Mr. John P. Chapman, and Prof. Benjamin S. Hedrick, examiners in the United States Patent Office, all of whom have most kindly and willingly aided him in many ways. The numerous and valuable lists of patents contained in this volume could not have been perfected but for the facilities which the above-named gentlemen have extended. Prof. William H. Seaman, assistant examiner, early mani- fested his interest in the work, and his suggestions from the first have proved valuable. Col. Weston Flint, and his assistants in the scientific library of the United States Patent Office, have also greatly aided the author in his researches, and to them also he desires to ac- knowledge his indebtedness. To the enterprising publishers of this volume much credit is due. They have most kindly responded to every suggestion of the author, and have cooperated with him in every particular, sparing neither time, labor, nor expense. VI PREFACE, The chernistr}'- relating to leather, skin, and tannins has been compiled from the best German and French authorities, and due credit is given for all such matter in the proper places in the volume. It is earnestl}^ hoped by the undersigned that his long labors will not prove unfruitful, and that many persons will be bene- fited by his work. CHARLES T.

PART I. CHAPTEE I. HIDES AND SKINS — THE VARIETIES OF HIDES AND SKINS USED FOR LEATHER — REMOVING- HIDES AND SKINS FROM ANIMALS — SELECTING HIDES AND SKINS — FRAUDULENTLY INCREASING THE WEIGHT OF HIDES — PRESERVING- HIDES — LIST OF AMERI- CAN PATENTS FOR PRESERVING HIDES — COMMERCIAL CLASSI- FICATION OF HIDES. From a very early period the hides and skins of animals have been doubtless much employed to contribute, first, to the neces- sities, next to the comforts, and finally, to the luxuries of man, being easily obtainable and adapted for shelter, apparel, and for a large number of articles of general utility. The origin of their use is more likely to be traced to moun- tainous than to low and warm districts, as in the first the animal food was desirable, and warmer clothing more necessary than in the latter, where man originally lived, between the tropics, under wide-spreading and protecting palm-trees, where food came spontaneously from the earth, and clothing was neither used nor requisite, and was not employed until circumstances finally compelled him to gradually migrate towards the poles. Then, as necessity has always been the mother of invention, mankind acquired sufficient knowledge to select the tender por- tions of plants and form them into clothing, and when they 3 34 THE MANUFACTUEE OF LEATHER. reached greater altitudes and colder districts to slaughter ani- mals, using the flesh for food, and the hides for shelter or cloth- ing, and, appreciating the use of plants, agriculture was prac- tised, and for the same reason animals were valued and the breeding of them received much attention. This branch of industry was carefully cultivated ; but, accord- ing to the economy of nature, mammiferous animals, as a class, seem destined from earliest times to have preserved a constant equilibrium in the number of animated beings that at all periods have held their existence on the surface of the earth. The quarrel between Laban and Jacob, in 1739 B. C, gives us an insight into the manner of conducting the cattle business, and the class of animals that were considered profitable. The same disposition to make contracts and then to seek to break them was just as common then as now. Laban, for a consideration of service, sold to Jacob a certain interest in the sheep and other animals, and then, when he saw that the pur- chaser was getting the best of the agreement, he changed 'it, and again he found that he was the sufferer. Jacob was the shrewdest cattle-trader of history, and was more forbearing than is the custom now, as he allowed Laban to change his inte- rest ten times in their dealings before he took his part of the cattle, camels, asses, and other chattels, and departed secretly from the Syrian, turning his back on the East, and his face towards Beersheba, which he had left about twenty-one years previously. In 1918 B'. C, when Abraham and Lot went up out of Egypt into the south, we are told in the thirteenth chapter of Genesis that they were both rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. After reaching Bethel, because the land was not large enough to con- tain their vast herds, and also on account of the strife between the herdsmen of their separate cattle, the same as the \"cow- boys\" of our plains to-day, they divided. Lot journeyed east- ward, and chose the watered and rich plains of Jordan, and pitched his tents near Sodom. Nothing seemingly pleases the herdsmen or \" cow-boys\" of the present time so much as to be convenient to a wicked city, and doubtless those in Lot's employ were gi'eatly elated at being HIDES AND SKINS. 35 SO near to Sodom and Gomorrah. Human nature has been the same in all ages; the wicked delight to dwell in iniquity; it is their life, their happiness. After the departure of Lot the plain of Marare was selected by Abraham, and the land further than he could see in all directions was his. In our own day we have great ranches, containing enormous herds of cattle, distributed through Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Southern California, and other portions of the coun- try; but for extent of territory and number of animals it is not probable that there are any to compare with the possessions of either Abraham or Lot. From the omission of the census to include the business of the retail slaughtering establishments in its statistics, and from the manner in which the exports of cattle are recorded at the ports of exit, it is not possible to form an accurate estimate and classificatioli of the annual production in this country; but as cattle-breeding is one of our principal industries, it is important to that interest, as well as to that of tanning, that some such record and classification should be made. In accordance with the universal assent of mankind, the em- pire of nature has been divided into three kingdoms : — 1. Mineral. 2. Yegetable. 3. Animal. With each of these we shall have more or less to do; of the first in the preparation and use of mineral tannins, the second of vegetable tannins, and of the third the hides and skins of the mammalia order of animals. The mineral kingdom comprises all substances which are without those organs necessary to locomotion, and the due per- formance of the functions of life. They are composed of the accidental aggregation of particles, which, under certain circum- stances, take a constant and regular figure, but which are more frequently found without any definite conformation. The vege- table kingdom covers and beautifies the earth with an endless variety of form and color. It consists of bodies organized, but destitute of the power of locomotion. They are nourished by 36 THE MANUFACTUEE OF LEATHER, means of roots; they breathe bj means of leaves; and propagate by means of seed, dispensed within certain limits. The animal kingdom consists of sentient beings, that enliven the external parts of the earth. They possess the power of voluntary mo- tion, respire air, and are forced into action by the cravings of hunger or the parching of thirst, by the instincts of animal pas- sion or by pain. The skins of the most important of the mammalia class of animals, and the alligator of the fish family, are all with which we shall have to do of the six classes into which Linnaeus li<as divided the animal kingdom. The bodies of nearly the Avhole species of animals belonging to the mammalia class are covered with hair bestowed in proportion to the necessities of the animal and the nature of the climate which it inhabits, and it is chiefly with the removal of this hair and the preparation, or rather the conversion, of the skin into leather that it shall be the object of this book to deal. There is no way in which to ascertain at what period the art of removing the hair and wool and manufacturing a fabric from them was acquired ; but the art was not unknown in the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates before the date to which any. of our histories reach, and Goguet plausibly conjectures that the earliest fabrics were felted, not woven. But the distaff and the loom before a great while again revolutionized the manufacture, and we are told that Abraham, in 1913 B. C, five years after parting from Lot, as has been previously mentioned, refused to take anything from the King of Sodom, \"from a thread even to a shoe latchet.\" It was centuries, however, before the inventions perfected on the plains spread towards and finally reached the scattered tribes of the colder places, and still longer before the sheep with straight hair, bred on the plains of Africa or Mesopotamia, could be acclimated to those colder countries, in which the straight hair was converted into the matted, curly wool which we find to-day on these animals. During all this time, among these remote tribes, the skins of animals continued to form the dresses or apparel of the people, and necessity taught the method of preparing them in some HIDES AND SKINS. 37 manner, and thus the use of skins beyond the limits of higher civilization continued to he general. Herodotus tells us that the tribes of the Caspian Sea used seal skins for clothing, Strabo speaks of the Massagette wearing fur dresses, and both Ctesar and Lactantius mention the reindeer clothing of the German tribes ; and, in fact, so general was their use among the less civilized tribes, that the classical authors used the term \"skin dressed\" as descriptive of the savage. The barbarians clung to this style of dress, which added to their savage expression of features, and made them terrible to behold. The British Museum contains a marble bust of one of these characters found in Trajan's Forum, Eome, the expression upon the face of which is that of the most repulsive and savage character, and which has probably increased to a much greater degree by these strange garments. The nature of the preparation with which the skins were treated, in order to secure their preservation, we have no accu- rate way of ascertaining; but they were subjected to some pro- cesses of treatment, in order to prevent their putrefaction. Goguet has surmised as to the manner of the origin of the art of tanning, and he has made some very ingenious conjec- tures as to its discovery, based on the method used by the- North American Indians, Greenlanders, and Icelanders in. the preparation of ^ skins. Among all these people and tribes, depilation by maceration in water is common, and it may have been suggested, as Fost- rooke has stated, by the natural process of depilation or removal of the hair, as in the cases of drowned animals,' when macera- tion is plainly observed. Advancing civilization gradually superseded the use of hides and skins for the construction of boats and tents, and their use for clothing and other purposes, in a greater portion of the world. Still so great is the continuously increasing employment for the products of hides and skins, that many of the chief industries of the world are supported from these useful and bountiful supplies of nature. When these materials are intelligently cared for and treated, they become wealth by contributing to the necessities, comforts. 38 THE MANUFACTURE OF LEATHER. and luxuries of man, who cannot create; but only take that which God has placed at his disposal, and by the labor of the body, or an effort of the mind, impart to it a value, and make it exchangeable, either into money, or convertible into other things which he desires. If the buffalo or other valuable animal be slaughtered on our own plains, those of South America, or any other portion of the globe, and the hide or other marketable portion be not removed and preserved, then it is simple waste, but this is one of the conditions inseparable from the absence of man, from whom .all value comes, and of diversified industries, which admit of a growth of the power of association, and a utilization of what have before been regarded as waste products. Then again, if the hides or skins of such animals be not prop- erly cured or treated, so as to arrive at the place of marketing in a perfect condition, it is again waste, and the punishment for such lack of intelligence is visited upon the vender by the pur- chaser in the shape of loss or deduction from the price. So through each step in the production of leather, from the moment of the slaughtering of the animal, until the finished product reaches the final purchaser, it is the duty of owners, managers, and employes in every branch to preserve the value, and economize at every point, both in the use of best processes and machinery, and in utilizing the offal, for in these days of close competition there is no room in the tanning or currying industries for extravagance. VARIETIES OF HIDES AND SKINS USED FOR LEATHER. The varieties of tanned leather are classed as hides, kips, and skins. The parts of hides are called butts, backs, flanks, etc., and form grades of thickness and quality. Hides are the skins of the larger animals, such as those of oxen, cows, and horses. Kirs exceed the size of calf-skins, and are the skins of small or yearling cattle. The East Indian kips are exported both HIDES AND SKINS. 39 raw and tanned, from Calcutta and Madras, in such large quan- tities as to form a distinct branch of the leather trade. Skins are those of calves, sheep, goats, deer, pigs, seals, and various other kinds of fur-bearing animals, which latter, of course, usually preserve their hair. To man, mammiferous animals are immediately useful in various ways. The bodies of some afford him food, the skin shoes, and the fleece clothes. Some of them unite with him in participating in the dangers of combat with an enemy, and others assist him in the chase, in exterminating wilder sorts, or banishing them from the haunts of civilization. Many, indeed, are injurious to him; but most of them, in some shape or other, he turns to his service. Of these there is none more subservient to his purpose than the common ox, of which there is scarcely a part that he has not been able to convert into some useful purpose. Of the horns he makes drinking vessels, knife-handles, combs, and boxes ; and when they are softened by means of boiling water, he fash- ions them into a variety of other things. Glue is made of the cartilages, gristles, and the finer pieces of the parings and cuttings of the hides. Their bone is a cheap substitute for ivory, and is employed for the production of bone-black for clarifying sugars, and a carbonaceous substance employed in the manufacture of Prus- sian blue, also for the production of ammonia, and for fertilizing. The hair is used in various valuable manufactures; the suet, fat, and tallow are moulded into candles, or used for a variety of other purposes ; the tallow for instance is largely used in con- nection with fish oil for \"stufl&ng\" tanned upper-leather, and there are but few steam-engines on land or sea for which tal- low is not used as a lubricant in the cylinders, and in addition it proves a valuable item in the American export trade. Thus is every part of this animal valuable to man, who has spared no pains to bring it to the highest state of perfection. In proportion to the advancement in improving the breed of cattle, which is now so much practised in Europe and this coun- try, do the hides become less thick and degenerate into thin and spready pelts. 40 THE MANUFACTUEE OF LEATHER. So generally has this improvement been practised in many portions of Great Britain, that the English tanners now make but little effort to obtain butt hides from their home cattle, and look mostly to South. America, Spain, and Portugal for the slaughtered butt hides which they use. The unimproved original stock on our plains will probably sup- ply us with thick hides for a long period yet to come, and with Mexico so conveniently connected with us by railroads, there is no immediate danger of our suffering for the want of butt hides from the improvement of our breeds of cattle. Cattle-skins form the chief source of supply for tanneries, and it is not necessary here to enumerate the purposes for which they are employed. Their former uses for shelter, boats, armors, shields, etc., which have been mentioned before, are of course obsolete ; but modern demands far more extensive and in accord with our ad- vancing civilization have arisen, and new employments are all the while being discovered. Besides the domestic hides, large quantities are imported from the East and West Indies and from the Cape, but especially from South America. From the East and West Indies we re- ceive light dried bullock hides, called kips, which possess a greater or smaller value, according to quality and the thick- ness of the coating with which they are provided upon the flesh side. Dried kip-skins freed from flesh and prepared with arsenic are also brought from Java, the East Indies, and other places. Hides from Central Africa and the east and west coasts of Africa, as also from China, are used for upper leather. The conditions of temperature generally prevailing in South American countries, i. e., hot days and comparatively cool nights seem to impart to the hide of the cattle greater insensibility to sudden changes of temperature. The different varieties of South American hides are gene- rally known by the name of the port from which they are shipped. The best hides come from Buenos Ayres and Montevideo, both bringing in commerce about the same price. They differ externally in that the head of the Buenos Ayres hides is trimmed off rounder and the fore part is narrower than HIDES AND SKINS, 41 in the "
