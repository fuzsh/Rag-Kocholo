        "text": "Siebel CRM Systems, Inc. was a software company principally engaged in the design, development, marketing, and support of customer relationship management (CRM) applications. The company was founded by Thomas Siebel in 1993. At first known mainly for its sales force automation products, the company expanded into the broader CRM market. By the late 1990s, Siebel Systems was the dominant CRM vendor, peaking at 45% market share in 2002.[1]\n\nOn September 12, 2005, Oracle Corporation announced it had agreed to buy Siebel Systems for $5.8 billion.[2][3] Siebel is now a brand name owned by Oracle Corporation.\n\nSiebel Systems, Inc. began in sales force automation software, then expanded into marketing and customer service applications, including CRM. From the time it was founded in 1993, the company grew quickly. Benefiting from the explosive growth of the CRM market in the late 1990s, Siebel Systems was named the fastest growing company in the United States in 1999 by Fortune magazine. With the growth of electronic commerce, Siebel formed strategic alliances and made several acquisitions to provide e-business solutions for CRM and related areas. One secret to Siebel's success was its ability to form alliances; as of late 2000 the company had more than 700 alliance partners.\n\nSiebel Systems uses a Customer Experience (CX) Blueprint, which is a user-centered approach to product strategy that ensures the needs of customers are met regardless of channel or delivery model. As a physical artifact, the CX Blueprint consists of a set of user experience, technical, and product blueprints that together are used to set product direction.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Competition\n\n2 Key dates\n\n3 Major releases\n\n4 Notes\n\nCompetition\n\nPrincipal Competitors: Oracle Corporation (now Siebel's owner); SAP America Inc.; Vantive Corporation (subsidiary of PeopleSoft Inc.); SalesLogix Corporation; Clarify Corporation (subsidiary of Amdocs); SAS Institute Inc.; E.piphany Inc.; Broadbase Software Inc.\n\nSiebel System competed directly with Oracle and SAP. These competing software suites gradually developed HR, Financial and ERP packages that were readily integrated and thus did not require specialists to deploy, enabling them to steadily erode Siebel's market share.\n\n1993: Siebel Systems, Inc. is founded by Thomas Siebel and Patricia House.\n\n1995: Siebel delivers Siebel Sales Enterprise software for sales force automation.\n\n1996: Siebel becomes a publicly traded company.\n\n2000: Revenue surpasses the $1 billion mark.\n\n2006: Oracle acquires Siebel Systems.\n\nMajor releases\n\nOracle CRM On Demand\n\nOracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition Plus (released 2007)\n\nOracle Business Intelligence Applications (Formerly Siebel Analytics) (released 2007)\n\nOracle Siebel 8.1 (Released in 2008)\n\nOracle Siebel 8.0 (Released in 2007)\n\nOracle Siebel 7.8 (Released in 2005)\n\nSiebel 7.7 (Release in 2004)\n\nSiebel 7.5 (Released in 2002)\n\nSiebel 7.0 (Released 2001, was the first web-based version)\n\nSiebel 6 (also known as Siebel 2000)\n\nSiebel 99\n\nSiebel 98\n\nSiebel 3.0 (Release Feb 1997)\n\nSiebel 2.0 (Release end of 1995)\n\nSiebel Sales Enterprise\n\nSiebel Customer Relationship Management (CRM)\n\nIntegration with Oracle's Fusion TBD"
