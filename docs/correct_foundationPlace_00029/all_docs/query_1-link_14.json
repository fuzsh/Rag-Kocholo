He went on to serve two years in the US Air Force as a logistics officer at McChord, AFB. He started graduate school at the University of California, San Diego Department of Bioengineering in 2006 and began research under the guidance of Dr. Richard Lieber. His thesis project, ìskeletal muscle adaptations to spastic cerebral palsy,î investigates the mechanisms leading to muscle contractures, a major cause of disability. To augment the clinical basis for this research, he received a grant to participate in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ìMed-into-Gradî program; through which he attended cerebral palsy clinics and collaborated with Dr. Henry Chambers, an orthopedic surgeon. Lucas plans to pursue a career in translational muscle research after graduate school. Away from lab he enjoys recreational sports, outdoor activities, coaching, and mentoring through Big Brothers of San Diego.\n\n2010\n\nTerrell Green\n\nTerrell earned her Ph.D in Bioengineering from the Jacobs School of Engineering at UCSD. She studied molecular bioengineering under Professor Amy Sung. Using a gene knockout mouse model, Terrell investigated how a single gene contributes to the organization and nanomechanics of cell membranes. Such studies will lead to better understanding and treatments of blood and heart diseases. Terrell is originally from New Orleans, Louisiana and obtained her B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Tulane University in 2004, graduating magna cum laude with departmental honors.\n\nCurrently, Terrell is a Teach For America 2010 Corps member and is teaching Biology and Genetics at an Atlanta public high school.\n\nAmy Lee Hsieh Yuan\n\nAmy received a Bachelor's degree in Bioengineering: Pre-medical at the University of California, San Diego in 2006. She is received her Ph.D. under the guidance of Dr. Andrew D. McCulloch, Dr. Robert S. Ross, and Dr. Michael W. Berns on her project, 'The role of vinculin in cardiac mechanotransduction,' in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego. Over the years, she has developed a strong interest in translational cardiovascular research and hopes to pursue these interests through the development of therapeutics and diagnostics.\n\nRoy Lefkowitz\n\nRoy received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from UCLA in 2005.
