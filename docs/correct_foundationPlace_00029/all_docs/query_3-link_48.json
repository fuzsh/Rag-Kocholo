        "text": "Thomas Siebel, once one of Oracle CEO Larry Ellison's brightest rising stars, is now among the biggest thorns in Ellison's side.\n\nSix years after Siebel founded software company Siebel Systems, the vitriol is flying between the two battle-hardened competitors.\n\nLegal letters have been shuttling back and forth between Oracle's headquarters in Redwood Shores, California, and Siebel's in nearby San Mateo. Each company has accused the other of illegal marketing and making false claims.\n\nBehind the personal feud is a struggle for the booming market for customer relationship management software, which helps companies manage and streamline sales leads, marketing, customer service, call center and sales force functions.\n\nSiebel is No. 1 in the market, which should grow to US$2.9 billion this year and to $16.8 billion in 2003, according to Boston-based AMR Research. Oracle is pushing hard to supplant its rival at the top of the heap.\n\nCustomer relationship management, or CRM, is the fastest growing part of the software industry for a compelling reason. Helped by the phenomenal growth of the Internet, businesses are able to automate vast swaths of their firms and tie together different computer systems and software programs.\n\nSiebel has been hard at work since 1993. In its second quarter ended 30 June, sales surged 83 percent to $164.4 million from a year ago. In Oracle's fiscal fourth quarter, ended 31 May, it said sales of CRM software rose 138 percent to $44 million from the year-earlier period.\n\n\"Siebel has been tremendously successful,\" said analyst Steve Bonadio at Framingham, Massachusetts-based market researcher Hurwitz Group. \"They know what they're doing.\"\n\nOracle surely knows what it would like to do.\n\nWith its own CRM offerings, Oracle will surpass Siebel \"by the end of this year,\" Ellison said in a recent interview. Already he claims Oracle is No. 2 after Siebel, having surpassed Clarify and Vantive Corp.\n\nAnalysts say the claims are typical of Ellison, one of Silicon Valley's most outspoken CEOs and highly competitive in business and in his leisure time, where he is an avid sailor.\n\n\"Sometimes it's hard to parse the facts from the fiction, the marketing from the product,\" said one analyst who asked not be identified, when asked about Oracle's claims.\n\nSiebel told Reuters in an interview, \"One of these CEOs is looking you straight in the eye and lying through their teeth. This is about [Oracle's] conviction that unless these guys are stopped quickly, they might be unstoppable.\"\n\nIn June, Siebel's company struck out at what it considered false claims in Oracle ads. Siebel lawyers wrote a 14 June letter, hand-delivered to Ellison's office, that carried \"a formal demand that you and Oracle immediately cease and desist your unlawful campaign of false, deceptive and disparaging statements about Siebel Systems and its products.\"\n\nA few weeks later, Oracle lawyers shot back with their own letter, leveling the same accusations against Siebel and denying any wrongdoing.\n\n\"We've got more lawyers than they do programmers,\" Ellison told Reuters when asked about the dispute.\n\nSiebel said the issue was now behind them.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is they stopped the mudslinging ads that were illegal,\" Siebel said.\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle and Siebel are slugging it out in the CRM market, which Siebel said will surpass the enterprise resource planning software market in the next year to 18 months.\n\nSAP AG, PeopleSoft Inc., Oracle and other makers of ERP software, which helps manage the back end of businesses such as payroll and manufacturing, have all seen sales growth slow because of the Y2K problem and market saturation.\n\nThis is another reason, analysts said, for Oracle's urgency in moving headlong into the CRM market. \"Oracle's marketing has gotten very aggressive recently,\" Bonadio said.\n\n\"A year and a half ago, Larry made the decision to invest heavily in CRM,\" said Mark Barrenechea, who is leading Oracle's CRM charge. \"It's taken us three years to build what we have now and our products are stronger than they've ever been.\"\n\nBut whirling above the warring Oracle and Siebel sales forces, it appears the spat between the CEOs will continue.\n\n\"Who's got the bigger sailboat, that's what it comes down to,\" said an analyst who asked not be identified. \"I hate to say this, but it's an ego match.\"\n\nCopyright 1999 Reuters Limited."
