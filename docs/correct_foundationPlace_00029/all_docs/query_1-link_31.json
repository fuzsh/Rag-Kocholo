        "text": "Siebel: What does the surname Siebel mean?\n\nSiebel is a German surname which has its origins in the Middle Ages. It is derived from the Old Germanic personal name Siegbald, which is itself made up of two elements: \"sigu\", meaning victory, and \"bald\", meaning bold or brave. Thus, the name can be interpreted as \"victorious and bold\" or \"brave victor\". Over time, Siegbald evolved and simplified into Siebel. Like many surnames, it was initially used to identify individuals, especially in regions where the population was growing and it was becoming difficult to distinguish people by just their first names. Individuals would be referred to by their profession, place of origin, or father’s name, etc. In the case of Siebel, it was likely used to refer to descendants of a person named Siegbald. Today, people with the last name Siebel can be found in various parts of the world, although it is most common in Germany.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nSiebel: Where does the name Siebel come from?\n\nThe surname Siebel is of German origin. It is derived from the Middle High German term \"sib\" which means \"related\" or \"kin\". This term was often used as a personal name during the Middle Ages, which eventually evolved into a surname.\n\nIts variants include Sieb, Siebe, Sieben, and Siebler. Like many surnames, it was likely originally used to identify someone based on their family, their father's name (patronymic), their trade, or their place of residence.\n\nToday, the Siebel surname is most common in Germany and the United States. In Germany, it is widely distributed across the country, but it's particularly prevalent in the regions of North Rhine-Westphalia, Bayern, and Baden-Württemberg. The large concentration of people with the Siebel surname in the United States can be attributed to German immigration during the 18th to 20th centuries. It is common in various states, but particularly in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Missouri. The Siebel name is also found, to a lesser extent, in Canada, Australia, and some European countries.\n\nVariations of the surname Siebel\n\nThe surname Siebel is of German origin. Alternate spellings or variants may include Siebeling, Siebels, Siebe, Siebert, Siebertz, Siebolt, Siebelink and Seibel. Some of these variants may have developed due to regional dialect differences or geographic relocation of families bearing the surname. Siebelink, for instance, is a Dutch variant of Siebel, while Siebert or Siebertz might indicate a patronymic (\"son of Sieb\").\n\nSurnames like Siebelink or Siebeling, with the suffix \"-ink\" or \"-ing\", often suggest a place of origin or familial home. For example, in the Netherlands, the surname Siebelink might signify someone from a place named Siebel, or from a family home known as Siebel-huis.\n\nFor any variant, localized changes in spelling may have been adopted over time to better fit the phonetics of a particular language or dialect. It's also worth noting that immigration and transcription errors can also be responsible for variations in the spelling of surnames. Translations of the name or misspelling during emigration, naturalization, or other official procedures often resulted in changes to the original surname.\n\nFamous people with the name Siebel\n\nThomas Siebel: An American businessman, philanthropist, and founder of two software companies: Siebel Systems and C3.ai.
