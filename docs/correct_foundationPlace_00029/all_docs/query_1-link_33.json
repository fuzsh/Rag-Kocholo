Oracle Siebel CRM provides comprehensive CRM solutions tailored with industry needs along with pre-built integrations makes it a widely used CRM software.\n\nSince companies compete to attract new businesses, increase customer loyalty through CRM tools, the demand can scale rapidly, forcing datacenters to expand system resources quickly to meet increasing workloads. Oracle Siebel CRM allows datacenters to scale horizontally (adding more servers at each tier as they grow), vertically (adding more powerful servers (CPUs and RAM)) or both, since it is built on Service Oriented Architecture foundation.\n\nOracle Siebel CRM applications, running on the Cisco Unified Computing System, can reduce the total cost of ownership at the platform, site, and organizational levels and increase IT staff productivity and business agility.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nThis document is intended to assist Solution Architects, Sales Engineers, Field Engineers and Consultants in planning, design, and deployment of Oracle Siebel CRM hosted on Cisco Unified Computing System servers. This document assumes that the reader has an architectural understanding of the Cisco UCS servers, Oracle Siebel CRM software, EMC® VNX5500™ Storage array, and related software.\n\nPurpose of this Guide\n\nThis Cisco Validated Design demonstrates how enterprises can apply best practices for Cisco Unified Computing System, Cisco Nexus family of switches and EMC VNX5500 storage array for Oracle Siebel CRM implementation.\n\nDesign validation was achieved by conducting tests for Oracle Siebel CRM workloads using HP's LoadRunner tool. Workloads were defined as small enterprise sized workloads of 600 concurrent users, medium enterprise workloads of 3000 concurrent users and large workloads of 10000 concurrent users with proportionately increased data volumes.\n\nBusiness Needs\n\nThe business needs for Oracle Siebel CRM on Cisco UCS servers are:\n\n• As companies compete to expand to new businesses and improve customer satisfaction using CRM tools such as Oracle Siebel, it can result in high system resource demands in shortest possible time.\n\n• Large Oracle Siebel CRM implementations require high compute, highly available system resources as optimum service levels are required to ensure business continuity.\n\n• Cost containment and reduced complexities when adding new system resources to meet the ever increasing Siebel CRM demands.\n\n• Ability of the system resources to upgrade/adopt to newer technologies such as cloud computing etc. without a significant impact on TCO (Total Cost of Ownership).\n\nTo meet these business needs the Cisco Unified Computing System™ server platform provides a new data center architecture that is ideal for supporting and managing mission-critical applications. The Cisco UCS is the next-generation data center server platform that unites compute, network, storage access, and virtualization into a cohesive system designed to outperform previous server architectures, increase operational agility and flexibility while potentially dramatically reducing overall data center costs.\n\nTesting exercises conducted at Cisco labs using a well-defined Siebel CRM workload have shown that, the Cisco UCS servers scale easily to accommodate a wide range of workloads - thus validating the Siebel CRM performance requirements can be adequately met in enterprise deployments.\n\nCombined with EMC VNX5500 storage array, Cisco UCS servers provide a compelling proposition for Oracle Siebel CRM implementation, as VNX5500 offers unified storage (both block and file access together) along with optimal response time suiting Oracle Siebel CRM requirements. EMC VNX5500 is high-performing Unified Storage with unsurpassed simplicity and efficiency, and offers new levels of performance, protection, compliance, and ease of management.\n\nSolution Overview\n\nThe Solution demonstrates the ease of deployment of Oracle Siebel CRM version 8.1.1.4 on a fully configured Cisco UCS system with an end to end deployment of a typical Oracle Siebel CRM implementation. The solution describes the following aspects of Siebel CRM deployment on Cisco Unified Computing System:\n\n• Configuring Cisco UCS for Oracle Siebel\n\n– Configuring Fabric Interconnect\n\n– Configuring Cisco UCS Blades\n\n• Configuring EMC VNX5500 series storage enclosures for Oracle Siebel CRM\n\n– Configuring the storage and creating LUNs\n\n– Associating LUNs with the hosts\n\n• Installing and configuring Oracle Siebel CRM 8.1.1.4\n\n– Provisioning the required server resource\n\n– Installing and Configuring Oracle Web Server, Siebel Gateway Server and Siebel Application Server\n\n– Configuring the Oracle RAC database\n\n• Performance characterization of Oracle Siebel CRM on Cisco Unified Computing System\n\n– Testing and tuning Cisco UCS hardware components for Oracle Siebel CRM\n\n– Tuning OS level parameters\n\n– Tuning Oracle Siebel Components - Web server, Siebel server and Database server\n\n• Sizing guide for Oracle Siebel CRM applications on Cisco UCS\n\n– Sizing criteria and guidelines\n\nThe solution is limited to a typical, minimally customized Oracle Siebel CRM application which deals with Order Management workload. However, Oracle Siebel CRM has several modules and diverse workload characteristics which can be configured to meet the requirements of broad range of enterprise demands. Although this solution does not address all those scenarios, it provides metrics and guidelines which can be used as a baseline for extending this solution to include specific Oracle Siebel needs to deploy using Cisco Unified Computing System.\n\nTechnology Overview\n\nOracle Siebel Customer Relationship Management Solution\n\nOracle Siebel 8.1 uses a multi-tiered application framework. The Oracle Siebel environment consists of client, application, and database tiers. The client tier comprises of devices that access the application via the Web. The application tier can be broken down to two different functions, services that terminate client connections and Application Object Managers (AOM) that perform the business logic. Multiple application components can reside in the application tier providing different business functions. The database tier contains the Relational Data Base Management System (RDBMS) and shared file system. The database serves as a repository for data collections. The shared file system is for storing attachments such as Adobe Acrobat files, fax quotes, and other documents. The Oracle Siebel architecture is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1 Oracle Siebel Architecture\n\nMulti-Tier Architecture\n\nClient Tier\n\nThere are multiple client types available on the Oracle Siebel platform. The major client types are Web client, mobile client, and dedicated Web client. Wireless and handheld clients are used in specialized applications such as retail and manufacturing.\n\n• Oracle Siebel Web client—Oracle Siebel Web client uses a Web browser on the local PC. It connects to the Siebel Web server via http (port 80) or https (port 443). No additional software is required. The Web client is easy to maintain since it does not require any software upgrades.\n\n• Oracle Siebel mobile client and dedicated client—The mobile client and dedicated client require additional software installed on the PC. The additional software provides faster throughput with less data transfers for a given transaction by sending only changed data between the client and the server. For remote users, the dedicated client allows disconnected mode and synchronizes with the database when network connectivity is restored.\n\n• Oracle Siebel wireless client and Oracle Siebel handheld client—These two clients are specialized clients for vertical applications. The wireless client has a translator for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), which is suitable for mobile phones. The handheld client can accommodate information on smaller screens.\n\nApplication Tier\n\nThe application tier contains two functional areas, services that terminate client connections and business logic.\n\nThe former component is called the Siebel Web Server Extension (SWSE). It is an add-on to Oracle HTTP Web server. SWSE is responsible for handling Web requests from users. It forwards user requests to the Application Object Managers (AOM) via Siebel Internet Session API (SISNAPI) protocol. Oracle Siebel provides native server load balancing for highly-available Web servers. Third party load balancers are supported as well.\n\nThere are numerous Siebel application servers that provide different business applications. Each Oracle Siebel application component can be run on a single or multiple physical servers. Application components can be load balanced at the component level across different physical server pools. Load balancing can be configured with native Siebel load balancer or a third-party load balancer.\n\nDatabase Tier\n\nThe database tier provides a repository to Oracle Siebel application data. It consists of a RDBMS and a separate file system store.\n\n• File system—The Oracle Siebel File System (SFS) is a server with a shared directory that provides NFS access to other Oracle Siebel servers. The SFS is a shared storage area for images, reports, documents, and other data. A pointer in the database record locates the file in the SFS.\n\n• Database Server—The database server is the main data store for the Oracle Siebel application. The Oracle Siebel application servers connect directly to the database server. Oracle Database 11g is used in this deployment.\n\nGateway Name Server\n\nGateway name server is a repository for configuration information for each Siebel server. It has configuration information about the Siebel Enterprise.\n\nCisco Unified Computing System\n\nThe Cisco Unified Computing System is a next-generation data center platform that unites compute, network, and storage access. The platform, optimized for virtual environments, is designed using open industry-standard technologies and aims to reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) and increase business agility. The system integrates a low-latency; lossless 10 Gigabit Ethernet unified network fabric with enterprise-class, x86-architecture servers. It is an integrated, scalable, multi chassis platform in which all resources participate in a unified management domain.\n\nThe main components of Cisco Unified Computing System are:\n\n•Computing—The system is based on an entirely new class of computing system that incorporates blade servers based on Intel Xeon 5500/5600 Series Processors. Selected Cisco UCS blade servers offer the patented Cisco Extended Memory Technology to support applications with large datasets and allow more virtual machines per server.\n\n•Network—The system is integrated onto a low-latency, lossless, 10-Gbps unified network fabric. This network foundation consolidates LANs, SANs, and high-performance computing networks which are separate networks today. The unified fabric lowers costs by reducing the number of network adapters, switches, and cables, and by decreasing the power and cooling requirements.\n\n•Virtualization—The system unleashes the full potential of virtualization by enhancing the scalability, performance, and operational control of virtual environments. Cisco security, policy enforcement, and diagnostic features are now extended into virtualized environments to better support changing business and IT requirements.\n\n•Storage access—The system provides consolidated access to both SAN storage and Network Attached Storage (NAS) over the unified fabric. By unifying the storage access the Cisco Unified Computing System can access storage over Ethernet, Fibre Channel, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), and iSCSI. This provides customers with choice for storage access and investment protection. In addition, the server administrators can pre-assign storage-access policies for system connectivity to storage resources, simplifying storage connectivity, and management for increased productivity.\n\n•Management—The system uniquely integrates all system components which enable the entire solution to be managed as a single entity by the Cisco UCS Manager. The Cisco UCS Manager has an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), a command-line interface (CLI), and a robust application programming interface (API) to manage all system configuration and operations.\n\nThe Cisco Unified Computing System is designed to deliver:\n\n• A reduced Total Cost of Ownership and increased business agility.\n\n• Increased IT staff productivity through just-in-time provisioning and mobility support.\n\n• A cohesive, integrated system which unifies the technology in the data center. The system is managed, serviced and tested as a whole.\n\n• Scalability through a design for hundreds of discrete servers and thousands of virtual machines and the capability to scale I/O bandwidth to match demand.\n\n• Industry standards supported by a partner ecosystem of industry leaders.\n\nCisco Unified Computing System is designed from the ground up to be programmable and self integrating. A server's entire hardware stack, ranging from server firmware and settings to network profiles, is configured through model-based management. With Cisco virtual interface cards, even the number and type of I/O interfaces is programmed dynamically, making every server ready to power any workload at any time.\n\nWith model-based management, administrators manipulate a model of a desired system configuration, associate a model's service profile with the hardware components, and the system configures automatically to match the model. This automation speeds provisioning and workload migration with accurate and rapid scalability. The result is increased IT staff productivity, improved compliance, and reduced risk of failures due to inconsistent configurations.\n\nCisco Fabric Extender technology reduces the number of system components to purchase, configure, manage, and maintain by condensing three network layers into one. It eliminates both blade server and hypervisor-based switches by connecting fabric interconnect ports directly to individual blade servers and virtual machines. Virtual networks are now managed exactly as physical networks are, but with massive scalability. This represents a radical simplification over traditional systems, reducing capital and operating costs while increasing business agility, simplifying and speeding deployment, and improving performance. Figure 2 shows the Cisco UCS components.\n\nFigure 2 Cisco Unified Computing System Components\n\nFabric Interconnect\n\nThe Cisco® UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnect is a core part of the Cisco Unified Computing System, providing both network connectivity and management capabilities for the system. The Cisco UCS 6200 Series offers line-rate, low-latency, lossless 10 Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and Fibre Channel functions.\n\nThe Cisco UCS 6200 Series provides the management and communication backbone for the Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers and Cisco UCS 5100 Series Blade Server Chassis. All chassis, and therefore all blades, attached to the Cisco UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects become part of a single, highly available management domain. In addition, by supporting unified fabric, the Cisco UCS 6200 Series provides both the LAN and SAN connectivity for all blades within its domain.\n\nFrom a networking perspective, the Cisco UCS 6200 Series uses a cut-through architecture, supporting deterministic, low-latency, line-rate 10 Gigabit Ethernet on all ports, 1Tb switching capacity, 160 Gbps bandwidth per chassis, independent of packet size and enabled services. The product family supports Cisco low-latency, lossless 10 Gigabit Ethernet unified network fabric capabilities, which increase the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of Ethernet networks. The Fabric Interconnect supports multiple traffic classes over a lossless Ethernet fabric from a blade server through an interconnect. Significant TCO savings come from an FCoE-optimized server design in which network interface cards (NICs), host bus adapters (HBAs), cables, and switches can be consolidated. The Cisco Fabric Interconnect is shown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3 Cisco 6200 Series Fabric interconnect\n\nThe following are the different types of Cisco Fabric Interconnects:\n\n•Cisco UCS 6296UP Fabric Interconnect\n\n•Cisco UCS 6248UP Fabric Interconnect\n\n•Cisco UCS U6120XP 20-Port Fabric Interconnect\n\n•Cisco UCS U6140XP 40-Port Fabric Interconnect\n\nCisco UCS 6296UP Fabric Interconnect\n\nThe Cisco UCS 6296UP 96-Port Fabric Interconnect is a 2RU 10 Gigabit Ethernet, FCoE and native Fibre Channel switch offering up to 1920-Gbps throughput and up to 96 ports.

It has 40 fixed 10 Gigabit Ethernet, IEEE DCB, and FCoE SFP+ ports.\n\nTwo expansion module slots can be configured to support up to 12 additional 10 Gigabit Ethernet, IEEE DCB, and FCoE SFP+ ports.\n\nCisco UCS 2100 and 2200 Series Fabric Extenders\n\nThe Cisco UCS 2100 and 2200 Series Fabric Extenders multiplex and forward all traffic from blade servers in a chassis to a parent Cisco UCS fabric interconnect over from 10-Gbps unified fabric links. All traffic, even traffic between blades on the same chassis or virtual machines on the same blade, is forwarded to the parent interconnect, where network profiles are managed efficiently and effectively by the fabric interconnect. At the core of the Cisco UCS fabric extender are application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) processors developed by Cisco that multiplex all traffic.\n\nUp to two fabric extenders can be placed in a blade chassis.\n\n• The Cisco UCS 2104XP Fabric Extender has eight 10GBASE-KR connections to the blade chassis midplane, with one connection per fabric extender for each of the chassis' eight half slots. This configuration gives each half-slot blade server access to each of two 10-Gbps unified fabric-based networks through SFP+ sockets for both throughput and redundancy. It has four ports connecting the fabric interconnect.\n\n• The Cisco UCS 2208XP is first product in the Cisco UCS 2200 Series. It has eight 10 Gigabit Ethernet, FCoE-capable, and Enhances Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP+) ports that connect the blade chassis to the fabric interconnect. Each Cisco UCS 2208XP has thirty-two 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports connected through the midplane to each half-width slot in the chassis. Typically configured in pairs for redundancy, two fabric extenders provide up to 160 Gbps of I/O to the chassis.\n\nCisco UCS Blade Chassis\n\nThe Cisco UCS 5100 Series Blade Server Chassis is a crucial building block of the Cisco Unified Computing System, delivering a scalable and flexible blade server chassis.\n\nThe Cisco UCS 5108 Blade Server Chassis, is six rack units (6RU) high and can mount in an industry-standard 19-inch rack. A single chassis can house up to eight half-width Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers and can accommodate both half-width and full-width blade form factors.\n\nFour single-phase, hot-swappable power supplies are accessible from the front of the chassis. These power supplies are 92 percent efficient and can be configured to support non-redundant, N+ 1 redundant and grid-redundant configurations. The rear of the chassis contains eight hot-swappable fans, four power connectors (one per power supply), and two I/O bays for Cisco UCS 2104XP Fabric Extenders.\n\nA passive mid-plane provides up to 20 Gbps of I/O bandwidth per server slot and up to 40 Gbps of I/O bandwidth for two slots. The chassis is capable of supporting future 40 Gigabit Ethernet standards. The Cisco UCS Blade Server Chassis is shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4 Cisco Blade Server Chassis (front and back view)\n\nCisco UCS Manager\n\nCisco UCS Manager provides unified, embedded management of all software and hardware components of the Cisco Unified Computing System through an intuitive GUI, a command line interface (CLI), or an XML API. The Cisco UCS Manager provides unified management domain with centralized management capabilities and controls multiple chassis and thousands of virtual machines.\n\nCisco UCS Blade Server Types\n\nThe following are the different types of Cisco Blade Servers:\n\n•Cisco UCS B200 M3 Server\n\n•Cisco UCS B200 M2 Server\n\n•Cisco UCS B250 M2 Extended Memory Blade Server\n\n•Cisco UCS B230 M2 Blade Servers\n\n•Cisco UCS B440 M2 High-Performance Blade Servers\n\nCisco UCS B200 M3 Server\n\nDelivering performance, versatility and density without compromise, the Cisco UCS B200 M3 Blade Server addresses the broadest set of workloads, from IT and Web Infrastructure through distributed database.\n\nBuilding on the success of the Cisco UCS B200 M2 blade servers, the enterprise-class Cisco UCS B200 M3 server, further extends the capabilities of Cisco's Unified Computing System portfolio in a half blade form factor. The Cisco UCS B200 M3 server harnesses the power and efficiency of the Intel Xeon E5-2600 processor product family, up to 768 GB of RAM, 2 drives or SSDs and up to 2 x 20 GbE to deliver exceptional levels of performance, memory expandability and I/O throughput for nearly all applications. In addition, the Cisco UCS B200 M3 blade server offers a modern design that removes the need for redundant switching components in every chassis in favor of a simplified top of rack design, allowing more space for server resources, providing a density, power and performance advantage over previous generation servers. The Cisco UCS B200M3 Server is shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5 Cisco UCS B200 M3 Blade Server\n\nCisco UCS B200 M2 Server\n\nThe Cisco UCS B200 M2 Blade Server is a half-width, two-socket blade server. The system uses two Intel Xeon 5600 Series Processors, up to 96 GB of DDR3 memory, two optional hot-swappable small form factor (SFF) serial attached SCSI (SAS) disk drives, and a single mezzanine connector for up to 20 Gbps of I/O throughput.

The Cisco UCS B200 M2 Server is shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6 Cisco UCS B200 M2 Blade Server\n\nCisco UCS B250 M2 Extended Memory Blade Server\n\nThe Cisco UCS B250 M2 Extended Memory Blade Server is a full-width, two-socket blade server featuring Cisco Extended Memory Technology. The system supports two Intel Xeon 5600 Series Processors, up to 384 GB of DDR3 memory, two optional SFF SAS disk drives, and two mezzanine connections for up to 40 Gbps of I/O throughput. The server increases performance and capacity for demanding virtualization and large-data-set workloads with greater memory capacity and throughput. The Cisco UCS Extended Memory Blade Server is shown in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7 Cisco UCS B250 M2 Extended Memory Blade Server\n\nCisco UCS B230 M2 Blade Servers\n\nThe Cisco UCS B230 M2 Blade Server is a full-slot, 2-socket blade server offering the performance and reliability of the Intel Xeon processor E7-2800 product family and up to 32 DIMM slots, which support up to 512 GB of memory.

The Cisco UCS B440 M2 supports four SFF SAS/SSD drives and two CNA mezzanine slots for up to 40 Gbps of I/O throughput. The Cisco UCS B440 M2 blade server extends Cisco UCS by offering increased levels of performance, scalability, and reliability for mission-critical workloads.\n\nCisco UCS Service Profiles\n\nProgrammatically Deploying Server Resources\n\nCisco UCS Manager provides centralized management capabilities, creates a unified management domain, and serves as the central nervous system of the Cisco UCS. Cisco UCS Manager is embedded device management software that manages the system from end-to-end as a single logical entity through an intuitive GUI, CLI, or XML API. Cisco UCS Manager implements role- and policy-based management using service profiles and templates. This construct improves IT productivity and business agility. Now infrastructure can be provisioned in minutes instead of days, shifting IT's focus from maintenance to strategic initiatives.\n\nDynamic Provisioning with Service Profiles\n\nCisco UCS resources are abstract in the sense that their identity, I/O configuration, MAC addresses and WWNs, firmware versions, BIOS boot order, and network attributes (including QoS settings, pin groups, and threshold policies) all are programmable using a just-in-time deployment model. The manager stores this identity, connectivity, and configuration information in service profiles that reside on the Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnect. A service profile can be applied to any blade server to provision it with the characteristics required to support a specific software stack. A service profile allows server and network definitions to move within the management domain, enabling flexibility in the use of system resources. Service profile templates allow different classes of resources to be defined and applied to a number of resources, each with its own unique identities assigned from predetermined pools.\n\nService Profiles and Templates\n\nA service profile contains configuration information about the server hardware, interfaces, fabric connectivity, and server and network identity. The Cisco UCS Manager provisions servers utilizing service profiles. The Cisco UCS Manager implements a role-based and policy-based management focused on service profiles and templates. A service profile can be applied to any blade server to provision it with the characteristics required to support a specific software stack. A service profile allows server and network definitions to move within the management domain, enabling flexibility in the use of system resources.\n\nService profile templates are stored in the Cisco UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects for reuse by server, network, and storage administrators. Service profile templates consist of server requirements and the associated LAN and SAN connectivity. Service profile templates allow different classes of resources to be defined and applied to a number of resources, each with its own unique identities assigned from predetermined pools.\n\nThe Cisco UCS Manager can deploy the service profile on any physical server at any time. When a service profile is deployed to a server, the Cisco UCS Manager automatically configures the server, adapters, Fabric Extenders, and Fabric Interconnects to match the configuration specified in the service profile. A service profile template parameterizes the UIDs that differentiate between server instances.\n\nThis automation of device configuration reduces the number of manual steps required to configure servers, Network Interface Cards (NICs), Host Bus Adapters (HBAs), and LAN and SAN switches. Figure 8 shows the Service profile which contains abstracted server state information, creating an environment to store unique information about a server.\n\nFigure 8 Service Profile\n\nCisco Nexus 5548UP Switch\n\nThe Cisco Nexus 5548UP is a 1RU 1 Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Ethernet switch offering up to 960 gigabits per second throughput and scaling up to 48 ports. It offers 32 1/10 Gigabit Ethernet fixed enhanced Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP+) Ethernet/FCoE or 1/2/4/8-Gbps native FC unified ports and three expansion slots. These slots have a combination of Ethernet/FCoE and native FC ports. The Cisco Nexus 5548UP switch is shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9 Cisco Nexus 5548UP switch\n\nI/O Adapters\n\nThe Cisco UCS Blade Server has various Converged Network Adapters (CNA) options. The Cisco UCS M81KR Virtual Interface Card (VIC) option is used in this Cisco Validated Design.\n\nThis Cisco UCS M81KR VIC is unique to the Cisco UCS blade system. This mezzanine card adapter is designed around a custom ASIC that is specifically intended for VMware-based virtualized systems. It uses custom drivers for the virtualized HBA and 10-GE network interface card. As is the case with the other Cisco CNAs, the Cisco UCS M81KR VIC encapsulates fibre channel traffic within the 10-GE packets for delivery to the Fabric Extender and the Fabric Interconnect.\n\nThe Cisco UCS M81KR VIC provides the capability to create multiple VNICs (up to 128 in version 1.4) on the CNA. This allows complete I/O configurations to be provisioned in virtualized or non-virtualized environments using just-in-time provisioning, providing tremendous system flexibility and allowing consolidation of multiple physical adapters.\n\nSystem security and manageability is improved by providing visibility and portability of network policies and security all the way to the virtual machines. Additional M81KR features like VN-Link technology and pass-through switching, minimize implementation overhead and complexity. The Cisco UCS M81KR VIC is as shown in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10 Cisco UCS M81KR VIC\n\nVIC1240\n\nThe Cisco UCS Virtual Interface Card 1240 is a 4-port 10 Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)-capable modular LAN on motherboard (mLOM) designed exclusively for the M3 generation of Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers. When used in combination with an optional Port Expander, the Cisco UCS VIC 1240 capabilities can be expanded to eight ports of 10 Gigabit Ethernet. The Cisco UCS VIC 1240 enables a policy-based, stateless, agile server infrastructure that can present up to 256 PCIe standards-compliant interfaces to the host that can be dynamically configured as either network interface cards (NICs) or host bus adapters (HBAs). In addition, the Cisco UCS VIC 1240 supports Cisco Data Center Virtual Machine Fabric Extender (VM-FEX) technology, which extends the Cisco UCS fabric interconnect ports to virtual machines, simplifying server virtualization deployment.\n\nVIC1280\n\nThe Cisco UCS Virtual Interface Card 1280 is an eight-port 10 Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)-capable mezzanine card designed exclusively for Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers. The card enables a policy-based, stateless, agile server infrastructure that can present up to 256 PCIe standards-compliant interfaces to the host that can be dynamically configured as either network interface cards (NICs) or host bus adapters (HBAs). In addition, the Cisco UCS VIC 1280 supports Cisco Virtual Machine Fabric Extender (VM-FEX) technology, which extends the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect ports to virtual machines, simplifying server virtualization deployment.\n\nEMC VNX Storage Family\n\nThe EMC® VNX™ family of storage systems represents EMC's next generation of unified storage, optimized for virtual environments, while offering a cost effective choice for deploying mission-critical enterprise applications such as Oracle Siebel. The massive virtualization and consolidation trends with servers demand a new storage technology that is dynamic and scalable. The EMC VNX series meets these requirements and offers several software and hardware features for optimally deploying enterprise applications such as Oracle Siebel. The EMC VNX family is shown in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11 The EMC VNX Family of Unified Storage Platforms\n\nA key distinction of this new generation of platforms is, support for both block and file-based external storage access over a variety of access protocols, including Fibre Channel (FC), iSCSI, FCoE, NFS, and CIFS network shared file access. Furthermore, data stored in one of these systems, whether accessed as block or file-based storage objects, is managed uniformly via Unisphere, a web-based interface window. Additional information on Unisphere can be found on emc.com in the white paper titled: Introducing EMC Unisphere: A Common Midrange Element Manager, see:\n\nhttp://www.emc.com/collateral/software/white-papers/h8017-unisphere-element-manager.pdf.\n\nEMC VNX Storage Platforms\n\nThe new EMC VNX family of unified storage platforms continues the EMC tradition of providing some of the highest data reliability and availability in the industry. Apart from this they also include in their design a boost in performance and bandwidth to address the sustained data access bandwidth rates. The new system design has also placed heavy emphasis on storage efficiencies and density, as well as crucial green storage factors, such as a smaller data center footprint, lower power consumption, and improvements in power reporting. The VNX5500™ model was used in this Oracle Siebel implementation exercise. All models in EMC's new VNX storage family now support the 2.5\" SAS drives in a 2U disk array enclosure (DAE) that can hold up to 25 drives, one of the densest offerings in the industry. For example, compared to the older-generation technology of storing 15 x 600 GB worth of data using the 3.5\" FC drives in a 3U DAE, the new DAE which uses 25 x 600 GB drives in a 2U footprint means an increase of 2.5 times. The power efficiency of the new DAEs also makes it more cost-effective to store the increased data in this much more compact footprint without the need to increase power consumption and cooling. For more information on VNX Series, see: http://www.emc.com/collateral/hardware/data-sheets/h8520-vnx-family-ds.pdf.\n\nKey efficiency features available with the VNX series include FAST Cache and FAST VP.\n\nFAST Cache Technology\n\nFAST cache is a storage performance optimization feature that provides immediate access to frequently accessed data. In traditional storage arrays, the DRAM caches are too small to maintain the hot data for a long period of time. Very few storage arrays give an option to non-disruptively expand DRAM cache, even if they support DRAM cache expansion. FAST Cache extends the available cache to customers by up to 2 TB using enterprise Flash drives. FAST Cache tracks the data temperature at 64 KB granularity and copies hot data to the Flash drives once its temperature reaches a certain threshold. After a data chunk gets copied to FAST Cache, the subsequent accesses to that chunk of data will be served at Flash latencies. Eventually, when the data temperature cools down, the data chunks get evicted from FAST Cache and will be replaced by newer hot data. FAST Cache uses a simple Least Recently Used (LRU) mechanism to evict the data chunks.\n\nFAST Cache is built on the premise that the overall applications' latencies can improve when most frequently accessed data is maintained on a relatively smaller sized, but faster storage medium, like Flash drives. FAST Cache identifies the most frequently accessed data which is temporary and copies it to the flash drives automatically and non-disruptively. The data movement is completely transparent to applications, thereby making this technology application-agnostic and management-free. For example, FAST Cache can be enabled or disabled on any storage pool simply by selecting/clearing the \"FAST Cache\" storage pool property in advanced settings.\n\nFAST Cache can be selectively enabled on a few or all storage pools within a storage array, depending on application performance requirements and SLAs.\n\nThere are several distinctions to EMC FAST Cache:\n\n• It can be configured in read/write mode, which allows the data to be maintained on a faster medium for longer periods, irrespective of application read-to-write mix and data re-write rate.\n\n• FAST Cache is created on a persistent medium like Flash drives, which can be accessed by both the storage processors. In the event of a storage processor failure, the surviving storage processor can simply reload the cache rather than repopulating it from scratch. This can be done by observing the data access patterns again, which is a differentiating factor.\n\n• Enabling FAST Cache is completely non-disruptive. It is as simple as selecting the Flash drives that are part of FAST Cache and does not require any array disruption or downtime.\n\n• Since FAST Cache is created on external Flash drives, adding FAST Cache will not consume any extra PCI-E slots inside the storage processor.\n\nEMC FAST Cache used in this Oracle Siebel architecture is as shown in Figure 12.\n\nFigure 12 EMC FAST Cache\n\nAdditional information on EMC Fast Cache is documented in the white paper titled EMC FAST Cache - A Detailed Review which is available at:\n\nhttp://www.emc.com/collateral/software/white-papers/h8046-clariion-celerra-unified-fast-cache-wp.pdf.\n\nFAST VP\n\nVNX FAST VP is a policy-based auto-tiering solution for enterprise applications. FAST VP operates at a granularity of 1 GB, referred to as a \"slice\". The goal of FAST VP is to efficiently utilize storage tiers to lower customers' TCO by tiering colder slices of data to high-capacity drives, such as NL-SAS, and to increase performance by keeping hotter slices of data on performance drives, such as Flash drives. This occurs automatically and transparently to the host environment. High locality of data is important to realize the benefits of FAST VP. When FAST VP relocates data, it will move the entire slice to the new storage tier. To successfully identify and move the correct slices, FAST VP automatically collects and analyzes statistics prior to relocating data. Customers can initiate the relocation of slices manually or automatically by using a configurable, automated scheduler that can be accessed from the Unisphere management tool. The multi-tiered storage pool allows FAST VP to fully utilize all the storage tiers: Flash, SAS, and NL-SAS. The creation of a storage pool allows for the aggregation of multiple RAID groups, using different storage tiers, into one object. The LUNs created out of the storage pool can be either thickly or thinly provisioned. These \"pool LUNs\" are no longer bound to a single storage tier. Instead, they can be spread across different storage tiers within the same storage pool. If you create a storage pool with one tier (Flash, SAS, or NL-SAS), then FAST VP has no impact on the performance of the system. To operate FAST VP, you need at least two tiers.\n\nAdditional information on EMC FAST VP for Unified Storage is documented in the white paper titled EMC FAST VP for Unified Storage System - A Detailed Review, see: http://www.emc.com/collateral/software/white-papers/h8058-fast-vp-unified-storage-wp.pdf.\n\nFAST Cache and FAST VP are offered in a FAST Suite package as part of the VNX Total Efficiency Pack. This pack includes the FAST Suite which automatically optimizes for the highest system performance and lowest storage cost simultaneously. In addition, this pack includes the Security and Compliance Suite which keeps data safe from changes, deletions, and malicious activity. For additional information on this Total Efficiency Pack as well as other offerings such as the Total Protection Pack, see: http://www.emc.com/collateral/software/data-sheet/h8509-vnx-software-suites-ds.pdf\n\nDesign Considerations for Oracle Siebel Implementation on Cisco Unified Computing System\n\nIn this section, the key design considerations such as scalability, high availability, and performance are addressed for Oracle Siebel Implementation on Cisco Unified Computing System. Since most organizations use Siebel as front end application dealing with their customers/partners, the demands on non-functional aspects are very critical.\n\nScalable Architecture Using Cisco UCS Servers\n\nThe target workloads for the small, medium, and large enterprise were modeled based on the real world CRM implementation for this exercise is as shown in Table 1.\n\nThe classification is based on a typical deployment scenario in an enterprise, keeping in mind the load and data size requirements. These broad classifications can be taken as framework for sizing the Cisco UCS servers.\n\nThe deployment configurations for small, medium and large Oracle Siebel enterprises are shown in Figure 13. These configurations were built by leveraging the modular architecture of Oracle Siebel as well by the choice of a range of Cisco UCS servers based on their capacity. In order to achieve high availability, redundancy at the level of the database servers, Siebel application servers, web servers with gateway servers are considered.\n\nFigure 13 Oracle Siebel Deployment Options for Small, Medium and Large Enterprises\n\nFigure 14 shows a deployment topology configured for a small Oracle Siebel Enterprise, which uses Cisco UCS B200/B230 servers, Cisco 6100 series Fabric Interconnects, Nexus 5000 series switches and EMC VNX5500 storage. The B200 M2 blade server is an entry level blade server which is suitable for low to moderate compute/ memory workloads such as web servers and gateway servers. However with increased CPU capacity, it can also serve as Application server in small enterprise Oracle Siebel setup.\n\nFor medium size enterprise setup, an additional blade is added at database tier to facilitate for a two node Oracle RAC (Real Application Cluster) implementation. With a typical customer scenario having 3000 concurrent users and 150 GB of database size, high availability of database is critical which is achieved using Oracle RAC. Since redundancy is essential for every critical component (such as network and I/O paths) within the database nodes, full width B250 blade server is chosen to host individual Oracle RAC nodes.\n\nFigure 14 Small Oracle Siebel Enterprise - Topology\n\nFor large deployments, additional application servers are added as shown in Figure 15. Each of the components (Web, Application and DB server) can be scaled for increase in the workload.\n\nFigure 15 Large Oracle Siebel Enterprise - Topology\n\nBoot from SAN\n\nBoot from SAN is a critical feature which helps to achieve stateless computing in which there is no static binding between a physical server and the OS / applications hosted on that server. The OS is installed on a SAN LUN and is booted using the service profile. When the service profile is moved to another server, the server policy and the PWWN of the HBAs will also move along with the service profile. The new server takes the identity of the old server and looks identical to the old server.\n\nThe following are the benefits of boot from SAN:\n\n• Reduce Server Footprint - Boot from SAN eliminates the need for each server to have its own direct-attached disk (internal disk) which is a potential point of failure. The following are the advantages of diskless servers:\n\n– Require less physical space\n\n– Require less power\n\n– Require fewer hardware components\n\n– Less expensive\n\n• Disaster and Server Failure Recovery—Boot information and production data stored on a local SAN can be replicated to another SAN at a remote disaster recovery site. When server functionality at the primary site goes down in the event of a disaster, the remote site can take over with a minimal downtime.\n\n• Recovery from server failures—Recovery from server failures is simplified in a SAN environment. Data can be quickly recovered with the help of server snapshots, and mirrors of a failed server in a SAN environment. This greatly reduces the time required for server recovery.\n\n• High Availability—A typical data center is highly redundant in nature with redundant paths, redundant disks and redundant storage controllers. The operating system images are stored on SAN disks which eliminates potential problems caused due to mechanical failure of a local disk.\n\n• Rapid Redeployment—Businesses that experience temporary high production workloads can take advantage of SAN technologies to clone the boot image and distribute the image to multiple servers for rapid deployment. Such servers may only need to be in production for hours or days and can be readily removed when the production need has been met. Highly efficient deployment of boot images makes temporary server usage highly cost effective.\n\n• Centralized Image Management—When an operating system images are stored on SAN disks, all upgrades and fixes can be managed at a centralized location. Servers can readily access changes made to disks in a storage array.\n\nWith boot from SAN, the server image resides on the SAN and the server communicates with the SAN through a Host Bus Adapter (HBA). The HBA BIOS contain instructions that enable the server to find the boot disk. After Power OnSelf Test (POST), the server hardware component fetches the designated boot device in the hardware BOIS settings. Once the hardware detects the boot device, it follows the regular boot process.\n\nEMC VNX5500 - Block and File Storage Required for Oracle Siebel\n\nOracle Siebel data is traditionally stored in any of the supported RDBMS such as Oracle using block storage. In our current implementation, the EMC VNX5500 storage system is used for block storage. The EMC VNX5500's capability of storing files and block access in unified manner is leveraged in this solution. LUNs are carved out using heterogeneous storage pools (FAST Virtual Pool with Flash drives, SAS, and NL-SAS disks) to ensure meeting the Oracle Siebel CRM storage capacity and performance demands. FAST Cache is enabled for the entire array to ensure faster response times for both read and write operations.\n\nStoring files such as PDFs, Word Documents etc., is also common requirement along with captured data. Familiar examples are adding resolution steps of Service Requests in MS word document format (or) generating an invoice document (typically a PDF) for a newly captured order. The EMC VNX5500 has datamover components which allow accessing these files using NFS/CIFS protocols and hence reduces the data management challenges.\n\nInfrastructure Setup\n\nThis section describes the configuration and setup details for:\n\n• Cisco UCS with and without boot Policy\n\n• EMC Storage\n\n• Nexus Switch\n\nConfiguring the Cisco Unified Computing System\n\nThis section details the Cisco UCS configuration that is done as part of the infrastructure build for deployment of Oracle Siebel. The racking, power and installation of the chassis are described in the install guide: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/unified_computing/Cisco UCS/hw/chassis/install/Cisco UCS5108_install.html.\n\nOne of the important aspects of configuring a physical blade in the Cisco UCS 5108 chassis is to build a Service Profile through the Cisco UCS Manager. Service profile is an extension of the virtual machine abstraction applied to physical servers. The definition has been expanded to include elements of the environment that span the entire data center, encapsulating the server identity (LAN and SAN addressing, I/O configurations, firmware versions, boot order, network VLAN, physical port, and quality-of-service [QoS] policies) in logical service profiles that can be dynamically created and associated with any physical blade in the system within minutes as compared to the considerable time consumption in a conventional approach. The association of service profiles with the physical servers is performed as a simple, single operation. It enables migration of identities between servers in the environment without requiring any physical configuration changes and facilitates rapid Cisco UCS Server provisioning for replacements of failed servers. Service profiles can be created either from an existing template or from cloning an existing profile or from a new service profile.\n\nLogging into the UCS Manager\n\nTo log into Cisco UCS Manager, perform the following steps:\n\n1.

It leverages the FAST Cache as well as FAST Virtual Pool and Unified Storage capabilities of the VNX5500 as well the EMC best practices to carve the LUNs required for this exercise.\n\n• Oracle Siebel CRM data stored in Oracle database accessed randomly and requires fastest for read/write operations. For such access pattern a storage pool with SAS drives and Flash disks (SSD disks) are chosen with RAID level 5. SSD disks provide faster response time for Random access and tiered storage with SAS disks provides the necessary capacity.\n\n• Oracle Database Log is sequential write intensive operation, hence SAS drives with RAID level 10 is chosen.\n\n• For the Siebel File System where sequential writes are more than the reads (based on the workload designed in this exercise), SAS drives alone without Flash disks in the storage pool are used with RAID level 10. However based on the actual access pattern and I/O mix, appropriate drivers and RAID level can be chosen.\n\n• For boot LUNs, since the I/O operations are mostly sequential, SAS drives with RAID level 1 is chosen.\n\nLocal hard disk partitions are used for OS level /swap and /tmp partitions in this exercise; however it was observed that they were not used during the test executions.\n\nFor Back up LUNs, NL SAS drives are chosen since speed is not very critical with RAID level 10.\n\nTable 2 provides Storage Pool/RAID Groups and Figure 25 shows the same.\n\nFigure 25 Disk Layout - EMC VNX5500\n\nTable 3 lists LUNs that were created for Oracle Siebel small setup:\n\nTable 4 lists LUNs that were created for Oracle Siebel Medium and Large setup:\n\nFrom the above table, it is clear that you need to choose an appropriate storage processor as the default owner, so that the IOs are evenly balanced.\n\nCreation of Storage Pools/RAID Groups\n\nTo create storage pools/RAID groups, perform the following steps:\n\n1.
