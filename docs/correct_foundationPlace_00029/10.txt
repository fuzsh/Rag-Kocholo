In order to support the scholarly and research activities of an outstanding faculty member in the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science, the Thomas and Stacey Siebel Foundation established the Thomas M. Siebel Chair in Computer Science with a $2 million gift.

Thomas M. Siebel (BA History ’75, MBA ’83, MS CS ’85) is the chairman and CEO of C3 Energy, a software company that helps utility companies realize the full promise of their investments in smart grid technologies. Siebel was the founder, chairman, and CEO of Siebel Systems, one of the world’s leading software companies, which merged with Oracle Corporation in January 2006. Before founding Siebel Systems, he served as CEO of Gain Technology. From 1984 through 1990 he was an executive at Oracle, where he held a number of senior management positions.

An active philanthropist, Siebel is the founder and chairman of the Siebel Foundation, which supports efforts related to education and research programs, the homeless and underprivileged, public health, and energy solutions. His generosity to the University of Illinois has included major funding for the Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science, the Thomas M. Siebel Chairs in Computer Science and in the History of Science, and the worldwide Siebel Scholars program (which annually recognizes five Illinois graduate students).

Siebel serves on the board of advisors of the Stanford University College of Engineering, the University of Illinois College of Engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, College of Engineering. His University of Illinois honors include the Presidential Award and Medallion (2001), an honorary doctorate of engineering (2006), induction into the Engineering at Illinois Hall of Fame (2010), and the Alumni Association’s Alumni Achievement Award (2013). In 2013, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
