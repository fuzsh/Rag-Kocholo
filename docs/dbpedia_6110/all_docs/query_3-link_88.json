        "text": "Revenge movie “Peppermint “ starts to make a lot more sense when you realize that it was directed by the man who brought us “Taken” (Pierre Morel) and written by one at least partially responsible for “London Has Fallen” (Chad St. John).\n\nIt’s a movie in which the central character, Riley North (Jennifer Garner), is called a “female vigilante” by a local news anchor and a “soccer mom” by Los Angeles police. She uses a maxi pad as a makeshift bandage to sop up the blood from a gushing knife wound and may do more killing than John Wick by the end of the film.\n\nWhy, you might ask, all the bloodshed? Riley is just a regular middle-class mom juggling a job and parental responsibilities in a sensible midi skirt and conservative sweater until she sees her husband and young daughter get gunned down by agents of a powerful Latin drug boss at a public fair.\n\nRiley survives the ordeal, barely, awakes from a coma, gets a grief pixie haircut and immediately identifies the three men with the face tattoos who killed her husband and daughter. But a deeply corrupt system lets them walk, and Riley goes rogue, disappearing for a few years to learn how to be a killer and return on the five-year anniversary of the incident to execute all who wronged her.\n\nThe movie doesn’t show much, if anything, of her training, which is summarized in exposition by an FBI agent (Annie Ilonzeh). Instead, it just picks up with her killing spree and her life operating out of a skid-row home base. It’s a bit of whiplash, her transition from Laura Ashley to Lara Croft, but you get used to the new Riley fairly quickly.\n\nAnd goodness, she is not kidding around with these killings, which are not only bloody and gruesome but also psychotically theatrical. The funny thing about “Peppermint” is that even in spite of its over-the-top script, it starts to lull you into submission when the revenge moments start picking up. There are a few twists and turns (some eye-rolling, some not) as you wait for her inevitable showdown with Diego Garcia (Juan Pablo Raba).\n\nIt’s a movie that is really best seen with a big, rowdy crowd that’s there to laugh and cheer at all the bravado. “Peppermint” is not some model of equality. It’s just violent escapism that happens to have a woman in the lead role. And, frankly, as long as this genre continues to entertain audiences, Garner is as compelling a lead as any, and more so than quite a few of the men who get so many parts like this.\n\n‘Peppermint’\n\nTwo stars\n\nout of four stars\n\nRated R; violence, language\n\n1 hour, 42 minutes\n\nOpens with screenings Thursday"
