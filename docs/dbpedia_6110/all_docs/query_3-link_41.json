        "text": "The history of human civilization is full of examples of human destructiveness towards human. Some occurred at the individual level, while others were at the mass level. Some others overflow and become objectivized only as works from the inner world of artists in fantasy. It is seen that the sense of revenge, which has the potential to reveal remarkable stories, has a significant effect on ordinary people and is closely related to the concepts of justice, faith, violence, and morality. The stories of individuals or societies with a desire for vengeance have appeared throughout history in myths and artistic works. Vengeance is one of the remarkable themes in many cinematic works in which the relations of crime violence, and moral problems in the individual and social fields are processed. South Korean director, Chan-Wook Park’s revenge trilogy called Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002), Oldboy (2003), and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005) presents a multilayered view of revenge, problematizing its representations in cinema. In this study it is aimed to reveal the feelings created in the audience with the sense of revenge that drives the characters (affect) imaged through Chan-Woo Park’s Oldboy film and how they produce a cinematic experience as an aesthetic strategy. In this context, it is seen that the director stylizes the sense of revenge throughout the film through many characters as a deep philosophical problem and as a morally impeccable-looking emotion that drives the narrative of the film. In Oldboy, the radical critique of revenge suggests that purification and redemption with deliberate images will be impossible because the act of revenge will only lead to its perpetuation. The film presents the nature of the connection of revenge to the myth of Oedipal incest and its punishment with reference to Freud’s conceptualization of the Oedipus complex.\n\nThe index to the 2018 VideoHound Guide to Films suggests that under the broad heading of “revenge” there have been something in excess of 1000 films. This appears to be the largest category in this comprehensive guide and suggests that this is, indeed, a theme which permeates the most influential sector of popular culture. These films range from influential and lauded films with major directors and stars like John Ford (The Searchers (1956) and Alejandro González Iñárritu (The Revenant (2015)) to “straight to video” gorefests with little artistic merit and a specific target audience (The Hills Have Eyes (1977)). There is, as the Film Guide numbers suggest much in between like Straw Dogs (1972) and Outrage (1993). The making and re-making of “revenge” films continues with contributions in 2018 from such major stars as Denzel Washington in The Equalizer 2 and Brue Willis in Death Wish. Within this body of film is a roster of films which allow us to speculate on the nature of the legal...\n\nIn this exegesis I discuss the context, rationale and methods involved in the development and production of Firebird (2016), a film created as the studio component of my Doctor of Visual Arts degree. The film, along with this exegesis, serves to address the research question: How can anti-violence and anti-vengeance themes be communicated through images in a revenge film? Revenge films often gain audience sympathy for the protagonist through the presentation of an initial wrongdoing or harm, which gives licence for viewers to enjoy the portrayal of violent acts that the protagonist subsequently enacts on his/her revenge-targets. As a filmmaker and film researcher, I have a particular interest in revenge films that provide a more critical approach to the portrayal of vengeance and violence. For the purposes of this exegesis, the terms &#39;anti-vengeance&#39; and &#39;anti-violence&#39; will be used to describe films, or aspects of films, that portray violent vengeance in a disapprov...\n\nRevenge is a complex notion with many facets and not an easy subject to discuss. However, investigating and understanding this challenging topic may prove to be an important endeavor. This book contains the proceedings from a conference on revenge, covering themes that vary from revenge in history and society, to philosophies of revenge, to revenge in literature and many subjects in between. Each one of the authors contributes ideas to the study of revenge, its meaning and its motivations. The papers on the philosophy cover thoughts from Bacon, Nietzsche and Bataille on the concepts of revenge. The papers on the history of revenge showcase prominent wars and legal systems that formed ideas of revenge on a national level. The papers on revenge in society examine how revenge creates social norms, and therefore, influences peoples' behaviour. Finally, the papers on revenge in literature discuss how prominent authors write about revenge, partially as a reflection of their times, and partially as a reaction against their times. Though this study is by no means complete, it forms a solid foundation upon which more research into the topic of revenge may rest.\n\nWe pursue a multi-leveled phenomenological exploration of revenge. Revenge’s puzzle is to give an account of what exactly revenge accomplishes when it apparently cannot alter the past or remedy the initiating harm. The structure of revenge consists of one harmed, the perception of harm and suffering, and one perceived as responsible for the harm. The situation is apperceived as a negatively saturated experience; as such, it binds and has a hold on the one harmed, constituting her as enthralled. Revenge seeks to remedy the situation by the intentional act of objectifying, constituting, and finitizing the infinite situation. This is accomplished by constituting the guilty one as guilty, thereby mastering, in some measure, the saturated situation. We suggest that the realm and machinery required for this process is found in the realm of the imagination, where similarity and association of ideas and concepts are at play. Saturation plays at the edge of this realm as alien. It is by way ..."
