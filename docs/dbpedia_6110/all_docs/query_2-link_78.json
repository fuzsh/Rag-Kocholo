        "text": "What is arguably Shakespeare's greatest play, \"Hamlet,\"​ is often understood to be a revenge tragedy, but it is quite an odd one at that. It is a play driven by a protagonist who spends most of the play contemplating revenge rather than exacting it.\n\nHamlet’s inability to avenge the murder of his father drives the plot and leads to the deaths of most of the major characters, including Polonius, Laertes, Ophelia, Gertrude, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. And Hamlet himself is tortured by his indecision and his inability to kill his father's murderer, Claudius, throughout the play.\n\nWhen he finally does exact his revenge and kills Claudius, it is too late for him to derive any satisfaction from it; Laertes has struck him with a poisoned foil and Hamlet dies shortly after. Take a closer look at the theme of revenge in Hamlet.\n\nAction and Inaction in Hamlet\n\nTo highlight Hamlet’s inability to take action, Shakespeare includes other characters capable of taking resolute and headstrong revenge as required. Fortinbras travels many miles to take his revenge and ultimately succeeds in conquering Denmark; Laertes plots to kill Hamlet to avenge the death of his father, Polonius.\n\nCompared to these characters, Hamlet’s revenge is ineffectual. Once he decides to take action, he delays any action until the end of the play. It should be noted that this delay is not uncommon in Elizabethan revenge tragedies. What makes \"Hamlet\" different from other contemporary works is the way in which Shakespeare uses the delay to build Hamlet’s emotional and psychological complexity. The revenge itself ends up being almost an afterthought, and in many ways, is anticlimactic.\n\nIndeed, the famous \"To be or not to be\" soliloquy is Hamlet's debate with himself about what to do and whether it will matter. Though the piece begins with his pondering suicide, Hamlet's desire to avenge his father becomes clearer as this speech continues. It's worth considering this soliloquy in its entirety.\n\nTo be, or not to be- that is the question:\n\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\n\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\n\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\n\nAnd by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-\n\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\n\nThe heartache, and the thousand natural shocks\n\nThat flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation\n\nDevoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.\n\nTo sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!\n\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come\n\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\n\nMust give us pause. There's the respect\n\nThat makes calamity of so long life.\n\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\n\nTh' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\n\nThe pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,\n\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\n\nThat patient merit of th' unworthy takes,\n\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\n\nWith a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,\n\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\n\nBut that the dread of something after death-\n\nThe undiscover'd country, from whose bourn\n\nNo traveler returns- puzzles the will,\n\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\n\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\n\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\n\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\n\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\n\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment\n\nWith this regard their currents turn awry\n\nAnd lose the name of action.- Soft you now!\n\nThe fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons\n\nBe all my sins rememb'red.\n\nOver the course of this eloquent musing on the nature of self and death and what actions he should take, Hamlet remains paralyzed by indecision.\n\nHow Hamlet's Revenge is Delayed\n\nHamlet’s revenge is delayed in three significant ways. First, he must establish Claudius’ guilt, which he does in Act 3, Scene 2 by presenting the murder of his father in a play. When Claudius storms out during the performance, Hamlet becomes convinced of his guilt.\n\nHamlet then considers his revenge at length, in contrast to the rash actions of Fortinbras and Laertes. For example, Hamlet has the opportunity to kill Claudius in Act 3, Scene 3. He draws his sword but is concerned that Claudius will go to heaven if killed while praying.\n\nAfter killing Polonius, Hamlet is sent to England making it impossible for him to gain access to Claudius and carry out his revenge. During his trip, becomes more headstrong in his desire for revenge."
