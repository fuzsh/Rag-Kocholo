Created by Mike Kelley, the series features a compelling lineup of actors, including Emily VanCamp, Madeleine Stowe, Gabriel Mann, and Josh Bowman, among others.\n\nThe plot revolves around a young woman who adopts a new identity and returns to the Hamptons, an affluent beachside town, to exact revenge on the families that wronged her two decades ago. As she embarks on her mission, she unravels a web of secrets, lies, and affairs that could potentially shatter the town's tranquility.\n\nMadeleine Stowe's exceptional performance earned her a nomination for the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a TV Drama. The series was honored to be named Favorite New TV Drama at the 2012 People's Choice Awards. Additionally, it achieved the remarkable feat of becoming ABC's highest-rated series in the Wednesday 10pm time slot since the 2006-2007 season of Lost. It was the only new series in over four years to achieve the 18â49 demographic ratings success that Lost had in its time slot since it ended.\n\nRevenge Locations\n\nThe TV series Revenge was filmed in several picturesque locations across the United States, with most scenes shot in Los Angeles, California; Southampton, New York; and Southport and Wilmington, North Carolina. The pilot episode was mainly centered around Wilmington. These locales provided a stunning backdrop to this gripping drama, with their unique architecture, breathtaking landscapes, and charming streets setting the scene for the show's intricate plotlines.\n\nAmanda Clarke/Emily Thorne's house, a central location in the series, is at 6249 Pebble Shore Lane in Southport. This idyllic coastal town also hosted the pilot's Porter's Stowaway Tavern, located at 106 Yacht Basin Drive, which later shifted to Marina del Rey in LA once the series was in full swing. Just a stone's throw away from Emily/Amanda's house, Barry Cox's residence is another key site in the storyline.\n\nWilmington, home to The South Fork Inn (The City Club of Wilmington, 23 S 2nd Street), is another must-visit spot for fans of the series. This charming city, known for its vibrant riverfront and historic architecture, added a touch of authenticity to the show.\n\nA trip to these locations would be worthwhile, especially for fans of Revenge. Not only do they offer an opportunity to walk in the footsteps of your favorite characters, but they also provide a chance to explore some lovely parts of the USA, each brimming with its history and attractions. Whether you're exploring the bustling streets of LA, taking in the maritime charm of Southport, or admiring the historic beauty of Wilmington, there's something to entice every visitor.\n\nThe arrival of Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) in the Hamptons marks the beginning of a thrilling tale of retribution. As the summer season commences, Emily gains entry into the elite social circle of business tycoon Conrad Grayson (Henry Czerny) and his sophisticated wife, Victoria (Madeleine Stowe). However, it is soon revealed that Emily, whose real name is Amanda Clarke, harbors a dark past.\n\nA key location in the series is Amanda Clarke/Emily Thorne's house. This grand beachfront property, symbolizing Emily's deceptive infiltration into the affluent society, is located at 6249 Pebble Shore Lane in Southport, North Carolina. This location serves as the backdrop for many pivotal scenes in the series, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.\n\nAlthough the house is privately owned and not for sale, fans can still admire its exterior from a respectful distance. Southport, North Carolina, is a charming village and a gateway to the beach, ferries, and islands. Here, you'll discover many activities and attractions to keep you entertained and enthralled.\n\nTo reach this iconic filming location, you would likely need to fly into Wilmington International Airport if coming from afar. From there, it's about a 40-minute drive to Southport. Once in town, you can use local transport or a rental car to navigate to Pebble Shore Lane.\n\nFilming Locations Directory\n\nIn the pilot episode, viewers are introduced to Porter's Stowaway Tavern, a family-run bar located in Montauk, New York. This tavern, run by the Porter family, serves as a crucial setting for the series, hosting numerous pivotal scenes and interactions.\n\nWhile the series portrays the tavern as being in Montauk, the scenes for the pilot were actually filmed at Fishy Fishy Cafe in Southport, North Carolina. This casual, dockside seafood spot, known for its live music and stunning views, was transformed into the rustic and cozy Stowaway Tavern for the show. After the pilot, the production moved to Los Angeles, but the essence of the tavern remained intact. Today, fans of the series can visit the real-life location of the Stowaway Tavern at Fishy Fishy Cafe. The place has retained its charm and looks much like it did in the pilot episode.\n\nIf you're traveling a long distance to Southport, your best bet would likely be to book a flight landing at Wilmington International Airport. It's approximately a 40-minute car journey from the airport to Southport. Once you have arrived in the town, you can find Fishy Fishy Cafe on Yacht Basin Drive, which is reachable by both car and boat.\n\nUncover Video Shoot Locations\n\nAfter years of meticulous planning, a gripping pilot episode also shows us that Emily Thorne plans to avenge her father by bringing down those who wronged him. One memorable scene that stands out is when Emily cunningly spikes Conrad's soup at an inn, leading to his subsequent health crisis.\n\nIn reality, this scene was filmed at the City Club of Wilmington. This stunning property, dating back to the 1840s, has been beautifully restored and now serves as an upscale reception venue. It is much more than just a venue, offering its members a 'home away from home' experience with fresh, chef-prepared meals complemented by a selection of fine wines.\n\nTo reach the City Club of Wilmington, you would likely need to fly into the nearby airport. It's approximately a 10-minute drive to the club from the Wilmington International Airport. Located conveniently in the city, it is not far from other filming locations like the Fishy Fishy Cafe in Southport.\n\nFind Raleigh Filming Locations\n\nIn the episode \"Guilt\" from the first season, the Open Arms Charity Benefit is the backdrop for a tense exchange between Victoria and Lydia (Amber Valletta). In a manipulative move, Victoria feigns a desire to rekindle their friendship. However, her motive is to prevent Lydia from revealing their joint involvement in a terrorist act.\n\nThis pivotal scene was filmed at the historic Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel. Opened in 1923, the Biltmore was once the largest hotel west of the Mississippi. Designed by renowned architectural firm Schultze & Weaver, the hotel features a mix of Mediterranean styles. The interior boasts stunning murals by Giovanni Smeraldi, an artist whose works can also be found in the Vatican and the White House.\n\nOver the years, the Biltmore has been featured in hundreds of films and TV shows, adding to its allure. It also holds a special place in Hollywood history as the location where the Academy Awards were conceived in 1927. The hotel has hosted the prestigious ceremony eight times over the years.\n\nToday, fans of Revenge can visit the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel to experience the grandeur firsthand. The hotel continues to operate and offers a luxurious stay for those interested. Visitors flying into Los Angeles International Airport can take a 40-minute car ride, depending on traffic, to reach the Biltmore.

The backdrop of this scene offers a breathtaking view that seemingly resembles New York City; however, the actual filming location is quite a distance away in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe dialogue unfolds at The Blind Donkey, a whiskey lover's bar in Pasadena. Finding The Blind Donkey is a breeze. If you're coming by air, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is approximately a 40-minute drive to Pasadena, depending on traffic. Once in Pasadena, you'll find The Blind Donkey conveniently situated on East Union Street, easily accessible to all.\n\nSearch Pasadena Filming Locations\n\nIn the climactic finale, \"Two Graves,\" fans are finally treated to the long-awaited marriage of Emily and Jack. As Emily and Jack prepare for their wedding day, the scene carries an uncharacteristically sweet and happy tone that contrasts with the show's typical mood.\n\nThis memorable scene was filmed at the historic Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, a testament to the luxury of early 20th-century Los Angeles. Built in 1928 for Edward Doheny, the son of an oil magnate, the mansion boasts stunning architecture and lush grounds. In 1965, the city purchased the property, transforming it into a public park and historical site.\n\nToday, fans of Revenge can visit the Greystone Mansion and relive the magic of Emily and Jack's wedding. The grounds are open to the public, and visitors can tour the mansion. Although the estate's appearance remains unchanged from its depiction in the TV series, it might be wise to purchase tickets to secure your visit.\n\nGetting to the Greystone Mansion is relatively simple for those flying into Los Angeles. Los Angeles International Airport is, depending on traffic, about a 40-minute drive to Beverly Hills. Once in Beverly Hills, the Greystone Mansion is located off Loma Vista Drive and is easily accessible.\n\nBrowse Beverly Hills Filming Locations"
