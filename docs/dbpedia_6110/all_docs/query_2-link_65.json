Howard Goldblatt. 1993 Viking Penguin. New York: Penguin-Viking, 1994.\n\nThis novel began as a short story published in 1986, so well received that it later was expanded into five chapters and published as “a family saga” in 1987, by the People’s Liberation Army Publishing House, Beijing. It was also made into a film, released under the English title Red Sorghum, in 1987, directed by Zhang Yimou.\n\nhttp://www.usc.edu/isd/archives/asianfilm/china/zhang.html\n\nAt the publisher’s request, Mo Yan added further episodes and published the novel in its entirety in 1989. Translator Howard Goldblatt is editor of Modern Chinese Literature and professor at University of Colorado; his translation of Red Sorghum was partially funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. At Mo Yan’s request, Goldblatt’s translation was based on Taipei Hong-fan Book Co., 1988 Chinese edition Hung kao liang chia tsu, which restores cuts made in the 1987 mainland Chinese edition.\n\nAlso by MO YAN & available in English translation:\n\nT’ien-t’ang suan t’ai chih ko.The Garlic Ballads (also trans. as Song of Wild Garlic). Trans Howard Goldblatt. 1995, Viking Penguin. NewYork: Penguin, 1996.\n\nMo Yan (b. 1956 in Shandong province, People’s Republic of China) is a member of the cultural affairs department of People’s Liberation Army (PLA). He is the author of four novels, several novellas, and many short stories; and winner of many national literary prizes. Mo Yan has been judged one of China’s “most innovative and creative novelists in recent years” (Li). In an interview reported by Peter Li, Mo Yan describes how he came to write Red Sorghum. He joined the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) in 1976, and was admitted to the literature department of the PLA College of Literature and Arts in 1984. There he studied military fiction written since “the liberation,” but became “disgusted with it.” Under the dictates of the Cultural Revolution, writers were required to “write about gigantic events and projects, as well as very positive and very negative characters. All of it was fake.” Mo Yan’s writing soon underwent a “drastic change”: “…I wanted to explore new modes of expression.” Jeffrey Kinkley, of St. John’s University in New York, calls Mo Yan\n\na young, defiantly experimental writer, and his story takes a modernist track, interweaving past and present fragments of a main plot and several subplots into a slightly mystifying yet cinematic and classically suspenseful grand narrative—cinematic because of his mesmerizing red symbolism: red sorghum (the original color the crop, modern hybrids are colorless), red blood, red sunsets, red bridal veils, red wine.\n\nIn Red Sorghum, Mo Yan portrays the “brutal realities of war, which had not be portrayed before”; he “spare[s] us none of the brutalities of war, which the other writers have sanitized from their works in order to show the revolutionary ideals of a just war” (Li). The key characters of Red Sorghum “do not consider themselves to be part of any organized fighting force, nor do they consider themselves to be fighting on the side of righteousness . . . . In fact, even their very survival from day to day is in question. For these fighters there is no PLA, no Communist Party, no Chairman Mao. They fight to survive, they fight for their land, their native soil (xiangtu). To be a hero is to fight the Japanese” (Li). In this novel, “even a local bandit can become a hero,” “local home-grown ruffians like Command Yu and Detachment Leader Leng . . . become the heroes of Red Sorghum” (Li). The “hit and miss” of guerrilla warfare fought on Gaomi sorghum fields is “quite different from the battle founds by the PLA” in earlier Communist socialist realist novels; we no longer find a “totally devoted, selfless soldier lead[ing] a heroic attack…without suffering a wound.” Instead, Red Sorghum presents “a lot of blood and gore. One’s own men are hit as frequently, if not more so, as those of the enemy and in the same horrible way” (Li). And the victory of the Battle of Black Water Bridge is costly and short-lived. Six days later, the Japanese viciously counterattack, kill hundreds of villagers, and torch the village before withdrawing.\n\nAnother key decision Mo Yan made was to write of the place where he grew up, “Gaomi County,” because “I had a deep understanding of its history, customs, and habits.” The novel is “authentic” in reflecting “the attitudes and actions of a large majority of the Chinese people who live in the rural areas. The themes of internecine fighting, differences of opinion, the interplay of local personalities, gender relationships, intergenerational conflicts all make Red Sorghum an unusual and interesting work, as do the local customs and habits of the Gaomi district in Shandong” (Li). Gaomi is a contradictory place, evincing mixed love-hate emotions. “But this is the soil to which the people are attached, and where life-giving crops of red sorghum are planted each year. The people depend on the sorghum for their livelihood, and it is synonymous with life itself” (Li).\n\nA third inspiration for writing Red Sorghum was that “I had heard many stories that were orally transmitted in my district”:\n\nWhen the peasants took breaks from their work in the fields, the older people would sit on a rock and begin telling tales. Someone might say that in 1937, it was at this very spot that the Japanese killed, or that so and so had been killed by a bullet that ran through his stomach, making a big hole in it. The following day, another person might retell the same tale differently, and so on. Every time the tale was told, something was added. The more times the tale was told, the richer it became. The images became more and more colorful. Gradually, history became myth.\n\nFrom this oral and enriching form of storytelling, Mo Yan’s Chinese kind of “magical realism,” reminiscent of Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Columbia), was born. According to Kinkley, magical realism is evidenced in the mythic proportions of Mo Yan’s tale, its fantastic plot, and its rapturous imagery of “’crushed and broken sorghum,' ‘sorghum corpses,’ ‘sorghum everywhere…crying bitterly.’” From the point of view of a subjective first-person narrator, colorful and dynamic characters come to life. Marxist “socialist realism,” requiring larger-than-life heroes glorified for fighting the just revolutionary cause, gives way to “psychological exploration” of complex characters, with complicated commitments “to family and children and other humanitarian concerns” before nationalist ideals, present new forms of heroism (Li).Peter Li identifies Grandmother Dai [called simply Nine by her family] as the true heroine of Red Sorghum: a casualty of war, she emerges as “the most interesting and colorful character in the novel and the protagonist who links the entire story together.” Her heroism stems from “a strength of character and integrity that defies [the usual heroic] physical characteristics” such as “exploits of strength and courage” (Li).\n\nSources:\n\nKinkley, Jeffrey C. “World Literature in Review.” Rev. of Mo Yan.

Born to a poor family ca. 1899, Yu Zhan’ao’s history is violent and varied. As a young bearer for the Wedding and Funeral Service Company, he first meets Grandma and falls in love with her.

At 16, Grandma is betrothed by her father to Shan Bianlang, leper son of Shan Tingxiu, (ch. 1.5, p. 39). One of the bearers of her bridal sedan is Yu Zhan’ao (Grandfather): their attraction to each other catalyzes a chain reaction: Zhan’ao saves her from a bandit, rapes her three days later in the sorghum fields, kills the Shan father and his leprous son (her new husband), and thereby positions Grandma, the young widow, to become the rich new owner of the Shan sorgham wine distillery.\n\n“UNCLE ARHAT” LIU:initially works for Shan family distillery, and, after the Shans’ untimely deaths, he continues as Grandma’s foreman of the family sorghum winery.
