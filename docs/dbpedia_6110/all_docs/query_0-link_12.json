        "text": "Liam Case (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a garbage collector -- and a hero. Several years ago he ricked his own life and rescued a little girl from a flaming car wreck. It is some time since his heroic efforts when Liam finds himself in the middle of an armed bank robbery. He ends up taking a bullet trying to protect a bank teller. Waking in the hospital, he vows to put things right by seeking vengeance against the thieves that left him for dead. Unfortunately for him, Detective Terry Subcott (Ray Liotta) is eyeing him as the prime suspect in several brutal vigilante killings and closing in fast.\n\nLiam ends up racing against the clock to enact his own form of private justice, battling a gang of vicious criminals dominated by Derek (Tommy Flannagan) and the Brothers McGraw (Kim Coates and Steven Kozlowski), all while dodging the authorities hot on his trail."
