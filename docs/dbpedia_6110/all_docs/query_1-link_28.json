        "text": "Have you ever sat in lonesome silence, accompanied by nothing but your thoughts and an open road ahead of you? The vehicle gliding directly ahead at a steady speed as you look out of the glass frame to see the nocturnal shimmering of winking neon lights and a glowing full moon half covered by black clouds. A song you love comes on the radio and you are a sent into an existential thought process. You become something else at night.\n\nNicolas Winding Refn’s Drive (2011), takes that thoughtful concept and glamorously coats it in a beautiful ‘hyper-reality’ (a ‘heightened reality’, as the Danish director would call it). For Drive is the exploration into our deep, unsaid motivations and our personal perceptions of what the world is and can be. Told through the minimal interactions of our unnamed hero protagonist – The Driver (played elegantly by Ryan Gosling) – Winding Refn takes us on a romantic Los Angeles tour of pure feeling, existential angst and genre influenced exploitation.\n\nThis is a neo-noir; a classical western; a modern fairy tale; a heist thriller; an exploitation movie; an existential drama and a love story. If it means placing Drive into a specific genre, categorisation is far from easy. With a director as fetish-like and primordial as Nicolas Winding Refn, he uses genre and auteur influences (which range from Michael Mann, Walter Hill, Wong Kar-Wai, William Friedkin and Sergio Leone) only as a basis for his own unique and artistic vision. One goes as far to say that Drive is the perfect bridge between art-house and mainstream – a perfect fairy tale subversion of the werewolf mythology about heroism and romance. It is a quintessential postmodern experience.\n\nOne of the many inspired creative choices Refn made to tell the narrative of Drive was through the synthwave pop soundtrack that has become synonymous with the film as a whole. “Have you seen Drive?” someone would ask, to which the response tends to be “Yeah. Awesome soundtrack” No analysis would be worthy without mentioning the significance of the songs and sounds that have already become ingrained in the popular consciousness. Despite being insanely catchy, the featured music goes beyond providing an aesthetically euphoric edge; it is deliberately used to set an 80’s influenced, techno tone and hammer home the themes of the film. ‘Nightcall’, the opening track by musical artist Kavinsky, expertly asserts the tone of the entire experience in one montage. The track chimes through the dreamscape of L.A as the aimlessly wondering Driver navigates the streets like a patrol car, or nocturnal wolf. It is indicative of his meandering life at this point in the narrative. It is difficult not to recall Tom Cruise’ wolf-like assassin character in Michael Mann’s L.A set thriller, Collateral (2004) – a nonchalant character draped in grey and blending into his city environment like a predator. The song title, ‘Nightcall’, and the lyrics within, relate to our protagonist’s nocturnal preference, and a howling wolf at the start of the song is nicely appropriate for a character who transforms into something else at night: a getaway driver. As Little White Lies critic, Adam Woodward, so eloquently puts it, ‘Drive’ is a “high-sheen (wheel)spin on werewolf mythology”. The lyrics – “There’s something inside you. It’s hard to explain” – are belted and resonated to the sight of a thoughtful mute; there is clearly something more to this character than what meets the eye. We find out later in the film. We will learn of his motivations and discover his psychopathic tendencies.\n\nMuch like the ever moving, circular wheels of the Driver’s car, the film starts and ends with The Driver navigating the roads. Him and his relationships are the in and out when it comes to analysing the deepest core of Drive. Those relationships being between himself and Irene (Carey Mulligan) – a romance – and the relationship between The Driver and the driven: his car. Our central character finds meaning and solace in the workings and operating of his vehicle when there is none to be found anywhere else. In the aforementioned opening sequence, the Driver comes ‘home’ to his flat after cruising through the pensive, orange glow of the L.A detritus; he stands in the door, looks around and walks out. He goes back to his real home: his vehicle. Where life is simple and makes sense.\n\nClearly under the indifferent facade, this Driver is a complicated character. Star Ryan Gosling once described the Driver as being a man who “watches too many movies”; someone who is “confusing his life with a film”. Much like the L.A population, the Driver is consumed by the ideology of Hollywood and the glamour of the movie industry. He finds it difficult to separate the movie world from the real one (which rings true of a city that is directly influenced by its fictional cinematic incarnation.) He is a stunt driver for films but he is also a getaway driver for criminals. It sounds like a good set up to a movie, right? The Driver knows it. He wants to be the hero he see’s on screen. It’s the reason the character would inexplicably wear a Michael Myer’s-esque mask in the final act of the film. It seems like the appropriate thing to do, if you go by the movies. It could even be a statement on the Driver’s transformation into action superhero. Superheroes wear masks, and it seems deliberately evocative of an action star like Bruce Willis or Jason Statham. Not only do mute, tough guy heroes like Clint Eastwood inspire Refn and writer Hossein Amini’s central protagonist, but our fictional protagonist in the narrative is susceptible to this influence too. It’s no coincidence that the character is taciturn, nonchalant and mystical like The Man With No Name character that features in Sergio Leone’s Spaghetti Westerns.\n\nAs with The Man With No Name, The Driver has no origin. Such a creative decision is interesting because the novella of the same name by James Sallis, which the film is based on, does detail the characters home and upbringing. Refn has removed any back-story to conform to the traditional tough guy, mystical hero image. We don’t know where he comes from. What matters is where he is going – represented perfectly by the open road and a vehicle floating forward. “Where are you from?” Yul Brynner’s hero is asked in the classic western, The Magnificent Seven. He points behind him. “Where are you going?”, the man inquires. He points ahead. “I drive”, The Driver plainly puts it.\n\nLike his favourite action stars, The Driver takes little thought to committing violent actions. When he gruesomely crushes the head of a mob assassin with his boots, protecting the damsel the way he has seen it done in the films, Carey Mulligan responds with a look of horror at his actions. He reacts to this with the glare of a puppy, or a child, who does not understand it has done wrong. They never see each other again. The Driver is a troubled character; his social ineptness is matched only by his violent tendencies and warped distinction between real and fictional. He never fully appreciates the ramifications of his life of crime until he is forced to gun down invaders in a motel room. He has been blinded by the romanticism of L.A, Hollywood and his life of crime.\n\nThe most recurring piece of symbolism throughout the film has been an ever present indicator into this eventual realisation. The insanely cool jacket Gosling wears features the unique image of a scorpion on his back. As mentioned by numerous critics and analysts, this seems to be a clear reference to the fable of the Scorpion and The Frog. In this fable, a scorpion convinces a frog to transport him across a lake by promising he won’t sting him and drown them both. The Frog agrees, naturally thinking that it is not in the Scorpions interest to die. So he lets him jump on the frogs back. However, the Scorpion does in fact sting the frog, who in his paralysis, just before they are both about to die, asks “why?”. The Scorpion responds “It’s in my nature”. There are a number of ways to read the relevance of this fable in the context of the story of Drive. Ryan Gosling is arguably the Frog character, carrying Scorpions (the criminals) around in his car. Until they inevitably sting and he has to deal the consequences of that. Alternatively, he could be the scorpion, whose life of crime eventually stings his love interest. He could even represent both. Or, it could just be a really cool jacket.\n\nThe Driver only transforms into a full-fledged, indestructible superhero once he has committed these acts of violence. Refn is commenting and playing on the age-old tradition of heroes becoming that through violent acts. The jacket becomes his superhero costume – his shining armour – and his vengeance a chivalrous act of protection. Before this, he was nothing but a simple criminal. When he does finally transition into that desired being, Refn uses the heroic, powerful low angle consistently to create images that are quickly becoming iconic. The Driver becomes a protector of the innocent, as represented by Irene and her son. This is what motivates The Driver: his will to be the hero.\n\nThis pursuit of righteousness seems to come more from an idolisation of cinematic heroes rather than an innate moral desire. He looks at his life as if he were the protagonist in a movie, and he makes the existential decision to live his life by this samurai code of influence. The funny thing is, he is in a movie. For us, at least. The film blurs the line between reality and fairy tale. The Driver comes in and out of the horizon to save damsels in distress, and the beautifully satisfying ending shows this bleeding, blonde hero shining his car lights down a long, empty road, looking for new people to save to the lyrical chimes of “a real hero” – College’s ‘A Real Hero’ track. He does not look back to go and embrace his love; he is too cinematic a character and person – he is mythical, just like the whole film. This is an incredibly stylised version of our reality and a beautiful portrait of heroism. Nicolas Winding Refn continues his tradition of making films about mute, violent men who have deep inner meaning.\n\nDrive even has room to tell a story about pure, uncontaminated love that is deeply reminiscent of Wong Kar Wai’s beautiful Hong Kong explorations into the concept (see the fabulous In The Mood For Love and Chungking Exrpess). It is a love story as pure as the fairy tale’s Refn was influenced by. Again, coming back to the thematic relation of the music, the track ‘Under Your Spell’ by Desire evokes fairy tales connotations, as well as being indicative of the desire that The Driver and Irene feel for each other. This is not a gross Hollywood definition of love. It’s not made melodramatic, or filled with clichés; more something that we can relate to. The non-awkward silences, the glares and moments of intimate connection. It’s intensely romantic. It portrays love as something more than a declaration. When they finally kiss to the beautiful ambient music of Cliff Martinez, you swoon. I go as far as to say it is one of the most romantic films I have ever seen. Of course, after the romantic kiss, The Driver then proceeds to stomp someone’s head in. It continues the grand cinematic tradition of exploring the relationship between violence and love.\n\nRomantic: a word that nicely sums up the film. Winding Refn came up with the idea for the crux to the film when the song ‘I Can’t Fight This Feeling’ by REO Speedwagon came on in a silent car drive with Ryan Gosling. He started crying and singing to the top of his lungs and proclaimed “this is what the movie will be about! A guy who drives around at night, listening to pop music because it is the only way he can feel!” In that true story, the style and essence of Drive is perfectly summarized: pure feeling, pure action, pure romance and pure cinema."
