        "text": "Measure for Measure is currently studied in VCE English under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nINTRODUCTIONâ\n\nAhh William Shakespeare. That guy. Youâre probably thinking, âGreat. More fancy language. Hasnât he been dead for centuries? Why does he keep popping up in our English curriculum?â\n\nAt least, thatâs how I reacted.\n\nShakespeare is actually a huge figure in the history of the English language, and really no high school English curriculum is complete without a mandatory dose of him. In fact, the current VCAA study design demands that one of his texts must be on the text list. What a legend.\n\nShakespeare doesnât only influence our world in the classroom. The Bard coined many words and phrases that we use today. We can thank this playwright for âbe -all, end-allâ, âgood riddanceâ, and my personal favourite, âswaggerâ.\n\nThe Bardâs play âMeasure for Measureâ was first performed in 1604; over 400 years ago. So why do we still study his works today? In fact, the ideas and themes that are evoked in his plays are universal and timeless; pertinent to his contemporary counterparts, as well as todayâs audience. Shakespeareâs plays are like soup (bear with me, this is going somewhere). One could say the playwright is a master chef; he mixes tales of the human condition and experience and asks us to question people and ideas. Everyone, regardless of their time, will gobble up the story.\n\nSo, what is this soup- I mean âMeasure for Measureâ about? The play is known as a âproblem playâ and/or âtragicomedyâ. Thatâs right, itâs both a tragedy and a comedy. Dire trials and tribulations are intertwined with humorous gags and jokesters. I guess Shakespeare couldnât choose just one. Â\n\nâMeasure for Measureâ is also a problem play. Critic W.W Lawrence defined a problem play as one in which \"a perplexing and distressing complication in human life is presented in a spirit of high seriousness ... the theme is handled so as to arouse not merely interest or excitement, or pity or amusement, but to probe the complicated interrelations of character and action, in a situation admitting of different ethical interpretations\".\n\nOk, crazy, but he also said that \"the 'problem' is not like one in mathematics, to which there is a single true solution, but is one of conduct, as to which there are no fixed and immutable laws. Often it cannot be reduced to any formula, any one question, since human life is too complex to be so neatly simplified.â\n\nIn short, a problem play presents lots of complications and issues that are open to different ethical interpretations. As in âMeasure for Measureâ, the âproblem(s)â is/are not always solved.\n\nSo, what actually happens in this play that is problematic? What are our ingredients in this problem soup?\n\nâP(L)OT SUMMARY\n\nGet it? Cause soup is cooked in a pot. Sorry.\n\nThe Duke of Vienna appoints his deputy, Angelo, as the temporary leader. This Duke then pretends to leave town but instead dresses up as a friar to observe what happens in his absence. Angelo, strict and unwavering in his dedication to following the rules, decides to rid Vienna of all the unlawful sexual activity; including shutting down the brothels. Prostitutes like Mistress Overdone (pun alert) and her pimp Pompey are poised to lose their livelihoods. Laws against this activity exist, but theyâve gotten lax over the years. Angelo, a stickler for the rules, has Claudio arrested because young Claudio has gotten his engaged wife-to-be (Juliet) pregnant before they were officially married. Claudio is to be executed.\n\nThe virtuous Isabella, Claudioâs sister, is poised to enter a nunnery. Upon hearing of her brotherâs arrest and sentence, she goes to Angelo to beg him for mercy. He hypocritically, in an absolutely dog move, propositions her, saying heâll pardon her brother if she sleeps with him (with Angelo, not Claudio). She immediately refuses, being the religious and chaste woman that she is. At first Claudio is upset because he wants to live, but then he calms down and accepts death.\n\nLuckily, the Duke (secretly dressed as a friar) helps in their sticky situation. He brews up a plan; Angeloâs former flame Mariana was engaged to him, but he broke off their engagement after she lost her dowry in a shipwreck. The Friar (Duke) plans to have Isabella agree to sleep with Angelo, but then send Mariana in her place. In theory, Angelo would pardon Claudio and be forced to marry Mariana by law.\n\nThe old switcheroo goes off without a hitch. But come morning, Angelo refuses to pardon Claudio, fearing he will seek revenge. The Duke, in collaboration with the Provost, send Angelo the head of a dead pirate (Ragozine) who died of natural causes. They claim that itâs Claudioâs head, and Angelo is satisfied, thinking him to be dead. Isabella is also told that her brother is dead and is encouraged by the Friar (Duke) to complain about Angelo to the Duke, who is returning home. Â\n\nThe Duke makes a grand return to Vienna, saying he will hear any complaints immediately. Isabella tells her story, and the Duke feigns disbelief, despite having orchestrated the plan himself. In an act filled with more twists and turns than a Marvel movie, everything comes out; the Duke reveals he was a friar all along, Angelo is forced to confess, and Claudio is pardoned amongst other things. To top it all off, the Duke proposes to Isabella. Crazy!\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nItâs important to acknowledge what was going on in the world during the writing of a text. This may help give insight into why the author has included (or not included) some aspect of their work.\n\nThe Divine Right of Kings\n\nThis holy mandate states that a monarch derives his right to rule from the will of God and is not subject to earthly authority. The âkingâ or monarch is hence practically divine, and questioning his orders is also questioning god; blasphemy.\n\nThe Great Chain of Being/Class divides\n\nThis chain is a hierarchy of all life forms and matter in the following order:\n\nGod\n\nAngels\n\nKings & Royalty\n\nNobles\n\nCommoners (Gentry, Merchants, Yeoman, Laborers)\n\nSlaves\n\nAnimals\n\nPlants\n\nNon-living things\n\nHence, alongside The Divine Right of Kings, this ideal gave monarchs huge power over their subjects.\n\nIn early 1600s England, there was a defined social hierarchy and class system. Everyone had a place in the hierarchy, and there was little movement between the classes. Within each class, men were considered superior to women.\n\nShakespeare encourages us to ask a few questions of our supposedly holy leader and his actions. According to the Divine Right of Kings, the Duke is godâs right-hand man, and thus all his decisions are holy and backed by heaven. However, the Duke is pretty shady when he plots his bed-trick plan with Isabella and Mariana. Is this deceptive behavior still holy? Furthermore, is it not sacrilege to pretend to be a holy friar when one is not truly a holy man?\n\nMoreover, when the Duke assigns Angelo as his deputy, would this transform Angelo into a divine ruler too? Could he be divine, considering his cruel rule and despicable request to Isabella?\n\nWomen\n\nWomen were considered subservient, lower class citizens then men. Alliances were forged between powerful families through arranged marriages of daughters. These girls may have received an education through tutors attending their homes (there were no schools for girls), but their endgame would be marriage, children and maintaining the home. Women and girls of a lower class did not receive any formal education but would have learned how to govern a household and become skilled in all housewifely duties. Impoverished and desperate women (Mistress Overdone) would turn to prostitution to stay alive.\n\nShakespeare perhaps highlights the struggle of women in his female characters; Isabella, Mistress Overdone, Juliet, and Kate Keepdown. Their futures appear bleak; Isabella is poised to enter a nunnery, Julietâs husband (her only source of income and protection) is to be executed, while the brothels that facilitate Mistress Overdone and Kate Keepdownâs livelihoods are being closed down by Angelo.\n\nJacobean Audience\n\nIt was a tumultuous time when Shakespeare penned âMeasure for Measureâ in 1604. A year earlier came the end of the 45 year long Elizabethan era and began the Jacobean era under the rule of King James. Since the late Queen Elizabeth had no direct heirs, King James of Scotland (a relative) took to the throne. Little was known by the English people of this foreign king.\n\nPerhaps, as Shakespeare portrays the ruler in âMeasure for Measureâ as clever and good-hearted, the Bard sought to appease the king by calming the people and encouraging them to trust in their new monarch.\n\nThe playwright characterizes the Duke as loving his people, but not enjoying being before their eyes and in the spotlight; much like King James, a quiet ruler who relished studying privately in his great library.\n\nâPlayhouses and Brothels\n\nThe general public (commoners) paid a penny (could buy you a loaf of bread back in the day) to see Shakespeareâs plays, standing in the âyardâ; on the ground, at eye-level of the stage. The rich (gentry) paid 2 pennies for seating in the galleries, often using cushions. The really rich (nobles) could watch the play from a chair set on the side of the stage itself. Shakespeareâs plays were performed at the Globe Theatre. Playhouses in Shakespeare's time were often close to brothels, both in terms of their physical locations in the suburbs and the way they were viewed by some of polite society. Thus, Shakespeare's relatively sympathetic portrayal of sexual deviance in âMeasure for Measureâ may also constitute a defence of other suburban entertainmentâhis playsâand a way to humanize lower classes who patronized them.\n\nWRITING ABOUT 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE'\n\nIf youâre lucky enough to study this interesting piece, the study design requires you to prepare âsustained analytical interpretationsâ¦discussing how features of the text create meaning and using textual evidence to support (your) reasonsâ. Basically, youâll be given a topic; this topic could surround themes, characters, etc., and you must write analytically.\n\nWhile you may choose to structure paragraphs around themes, ideas or characters, make sure to embed some historical context in there; thatâll show the examiner that youâve done your research and have a thorough and deeper understanding of why Shakespeare put this or that in. Talking about authorial intent in your analytical essay leads to a more in-depth analysis.\n\nâShakespeare portrays characters that are flawed as a result of pre-destined circumstances. These characters, such as bawd Pompey and prostitute Mistress Overdone, lived in a time when there existed strong class divides, and movement within the social hierarchy was rare. As per the âGreat Chain of Beingâ, a contemporary religious dogma, there was a hierarchy of all living things and matter, from lofty God and his angels down through the ranks of men and finally to animals and non-living things. In some cases, attempting to move up the social ranks was even considered a blasphemous rejection of the fate chosen by God.â\n\n- embedding historical context (The Great Chain of Being) into a paragraph that discusses characters being flawed because of their circumstances\n\nâShakespeare offers characters such as Isabella and The Duke who strive for self-improvement through understanding and temperance. Perhaps the playwright suggests that perfection is very difficult if not impossible to attain, even for a ruler like the Duke and a pure soul like Isabella. However, he posits that it can be strived for and that perhaps this attempt to become better is what truly matters.â\n\n- talking about authorial intent - what is Shakespeare trying to tell us?\n\nThink of it as an opportunity to make your very own soup! Add some themes, stir in character analysis, sprinkle in some quotes and serve with historical context and authorial intent. Just like with a soup, thereâs got be a good balance of all your ingredients; test out different structures during the year to find what works for you. (Just try not to overcook it, like I have done with this soup metaphor).

Well...). Keep on reading this blog post, where weâll delve into themes, characters and symbols/motifs. In the meantime, letâs have a break. Grab a snack, a drink, and enjoy this tasty Shakespeare meme.\n\n...Aaaaand weâre back!\n\nAre you ready for part 2 of the Shakespeare train? Hop on board as we explore themes, characters and symbols/motifs.ââ\n\nTHEMESâ\n\nThese are the major themes in âMeasure for Measureâ.\n\nAs you can see, the themes are interconnected. (Do you like the diagram? Made it myself :)) Why does this matter? Well, if you get an essay topic about Justice, for instance, you can also link it to Sexual and Gender Politics as well as Social Decay/Cohesion.\n\nSo, why is any one theme an important theme?\n\nWhich moments and characters are these themes related to?\n\nIs there a link to historical context?\n\nWhat are some key quotes?\n\nWhat could be Shakespeareâs potential message? (Keep in mind that depending which pieces of evidence you look at, the Bard could be saying something different. In this piece, weâll only discuss one or two authorial messages. The beauty of Shakespeare is that much is open to interpretation. You can interpret characters and ideas in so many different ways!)\n\nThose are some great questions. Letâs explore some of the biggest themes...\n\nPower and Authority\n\nPower not only dictates the Viennese society, but we see it is a basis for moral corruption (Iâm looking at you, Angelo!). The Duke is the leader of Vienna, ordained by God. He hands this power to his deputy Angelo, who misuses it in his request of Isabella. Now consider Isabella - she has power too, but a different kindâ¦ Also consider characters who have little to no power - Mistress Overdone, Pompey etc.\n\nThis theme could be linked to the Divine Right of Kings, the Great Chain of Being and Women.\n\nâO, it is excellent to have a giantâs strength, but it is tyrannous to use it like a giantâ - Isabella when she pleads to Angelo to not kill her brother (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 130-132)\n\nâHe who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severeâ - The Friar (Duke) to himself, not happy with Angeloâs dog move (Act 3, Scene 1, 538-539)\n\nâWhen maidens sue, men give like godsâ - Lucio to Isabella, encouraging her to convince Angelo not to kill Claudio (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 87-88)\n\n\"Hence we shall see, if power change purpose, what our seemers be.â - The Duke lowkey suggesting that once Angelo gets power, heâll change into something evil (Act 1, Scene 4, Line 57)\n\nâSome rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.â - Escalus is sneakily hating on Angelo. This quote shows that power and authority often involve corruption (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 41)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare is suggesting that power is a dangerous weapon and that in the wrong hands, it could be deadly.\n\nMorality and Sin\n\nThis is an interesting theme. What defines sin? For instance, if Isabella sleeps with Angelo sheâs sinning before God. But if she doesnât, then sheâs letting her brother die, which is not good either. Bit of a pickle that one. Some characters to consider include Isabella, Angelo, The Duke, Claudio, Lucio, the Provostâ¦. jeez just about everyone! So many of the characters take part in questionable deeds. Was it immoral for the Duke to pretend to be a holy friar? Is Claudioâs sin of impregnating Juliet really punishable by death if both parties were willing, and no one else has been punished for the same âcrimeâ? Are Pompey and Mistress Overdone being immoral in being in the prostitution business, if itâs the only way to survive?\n\nDeep stuff man. This can be linked back to class divides, women and the contemporary playhouses/brothels.\n\nâWhat sin you do to save a brotherâs life, nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtueâ - Claudio begs his sister to sleep with Angelo (immoral, especially since sheâs poised to enter a nunnery), saying that itâs for a good cause, and will actually be a virtue/good deed (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 146-148)\n\nâMight there not be a charity in sin to save this brotherâs life?â - Angelo asking Isabella to sleep with him and trying to paint the act as a charitable deed (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 65-66)\n\nâI am a kind of burr, I shall stickâ - Lucio, who represents sin and immorality in Vienna (weâll talk more about this later in symbols/motifs) (Act 4, Scene 3, Line 182)\n\nâTo bring you thus together âtis no sin, sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit.â - The Friar (Duke), encouraging Isabella and Mariana to do the dodgy bed-trick and trick Angelo (Act 4, Scene 1, Line 79-81)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare tries to tell us that there is a fine line between something moral and something sinful. Maybe heâs asking, âwho are we to judge?â, since we all do questionable things sometimes. Everyone from the almighty Duke to a lowly prostitute has committed potentially immoral acts. Perhaps audiences are encouraged to be more understanding of others, and their reasons for these deeds.\n\nJustice\n\nMmm, this theme ties in nicely with just about all of the others. How does one define justice? The play explores this idea; does justice mean punishment? Or mercy? How do we balance the two to deliver the right punishment/lack thereof? Characters that dispense justice include The Duke, Angelo (although they have differing ideas of justice) and Isabella. Since Vienna is a religious place, consider the divine justice system (ie. a perfect, flawless system meted out by God) and the earthly one (ie. the flawed, human justice system). Laws exist in an attempt to ensure justice. But does it always work? Consider also the Old and New Testament ways of thinking - the former strict and punitive, while the latter is more measured and merciful (see symbols/motifs below for more info).\n\nThis theme can be linked to the Divine Right of Kings, Great Chain of Being, Women, and Jacobean Audience.\n\nâJustice, justice, justice, justice!â - (Wait, are you sure this quote is about justice?) Isabella pleads for (you guessed it) justice to the Duke (no longer dressed as a friar), thinking Angelo has, in fact, killed her brother (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 26)\n\nâThe very mercy of the law cried outâ¦ âAn Angelo for Claudio, death for death!â Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure, like doth quit like, and measure still for measureâ - The Duke, explaining that itâs only fair that Angelo die for âkillingâ Claudio. (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 437-441)\n\nâliberty plucks justice by the noseâ - The Duke tells Friar Thomas that the laws have slipped over the years, and the citizens of Vienna are not being punished for immoral deeds (prostitution, sex before marriage etc)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare says that since we humans are inevitably flawed, that any justice system created by us will too be imperfect. Who are we to decide the fates of our fellow man? Furthermore, the Bard may be encouraging us to be kind when dispensing justice, leaning more to mercy than punishment.\n\nSexual and Gender Politics\n\nWho run the world? Gir- no itâs a bunch of men. This theme contributes to why âMeasure for Measureâ is a problem play. The exploration of the female characters in this play are very interesting, and kind of sad. Of 20 named characters, only 5 are women. Together, their lines make up only 18% of the play. Yikes! There is a lot to unpack here. Our female characters are Isabella, Mariana, Mistress Overdone, Juliet, Francisca (a nun who speaks twice) and Kate Keepdown (who we never meet). Their situations: a maiden poised to enter a nunnery, a prostitute, a pregnant girl about to lose her husband, a nun, and another prostitute. Quite gloomy, isn't it? Meanwhile, the men are leaders (The Duke, deputy Angelo, and ancient lord Escalus) and gentlemen (Lucio, Claudio, and Froth). Over the course of the play, our female characters are put into worse situations by men. Their experiences are dictated by men. Consider taking a âfeminist perspectiveâ and exploring âMeasure for Measureâ from a female point of view.\n\nThis theme links to the Great Chain of Being, Women and Playhouses/Brothels.\n\nâsee how he goes about to abuse me!â - These are the last words we hear from Mistress Overdone, as she calls out Lucio for betraying her even though she kept secrets for him. All this happens while sheâs being carted off to prison in only Act 3! What do you think Shakespeare is saying to us? (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 481)\n\nâThen was your sin of heavier kind than hisâ - The Friar (Duke) says to Juliet that she sinned more than Claudio, even though their sin was âmutually committedâ. Even though they were both consenting, the woman is blamed more. Consider what would become of Juliet if Claudio was executed. Sheâd probably end up like Mistress Overdone... (Act 2, Scene 3, Line 31)\n\nâWho will believe thee, Isabel?â - Angelo says this after Isabella threatens to reveal his disgusting request. Ouch. It really goes to show how untrustworthy women are deemed. Â (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 163)\n\nâWhy, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?â - The Duke says this to Mariana. Basically, he says a woman can only be those 3 things. Jeez. (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 196-197)\n\nâWhen maidens sue, men give like godsâ - Lucio to Isabella, encouraging her to convince Angelo not to kill Claudio. So, perhaps women do have some power. But, itâs due to their sexuality; something evaluated by men. Peachy. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 87-88)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare suggests that women are treated unfairly in society. Maybe he posits that women are afforded so few opportunities in a manâs world. The Bard potentially says that such sexual and gender politics do not create a cohesive and just society.\n\nMercy\n\nThis theme, again, connects to many others. It can link to all groups of people (The wealthy, the poor, women, criminals etc). Most of the mercy is dispensed at the end of the play when the Duke does his grand reveal. Characters who choose to mete out mercy over punishment include The Duke and Isabella. Also consider Angelo, who instead of choosing to spare Claudio, decides to kill him to uphold a law that hasnât seen anyone punished for the same deed. We might think this is harsh, but it a legal and lawful decision.\n\nConnect this idea with historical context, specifically Jacobean audience and playhouses/brothels.\n\nâI find an apt remission in myselfâ - Apt remission = ready forgiveness. The Duke says this after pardoning Angelo (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 539)\n\nâpray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to comeâ - The Duke pardons murderer Barnadine, asking him to use it to do better. How lovely! Â (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 525-526)\n\nâlet us be keen (shrewd/sharp), and rather cut a little than fall and bruise to deathâ - Escalus says this to Angelo, who wants to enact all strict laws immediately. The ever-reliable Escalus advises Angelo to be lenient and merciful. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 6-7)\n\nâMercy is not itself that oft looks so, pardon is still the nurse of second woeâ - Escalus says this, defending Angeloâs decision to punish Claudio. He suggests that sometimes being merciful can encourage further wrongdoing. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 282-283â)\n\nâI show it (pity) most of all when I show justiceâ - Angelo says to Isabella that he is showing Claudio pity/mercy by punishing him. A firm believer in the law, Angelo thinks heâs doing the right thing and teaching Claudio a lesson by punishing him. Â (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 123)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare encourages us to look at mercy and punishment from different perspectives. Angelo believes he is punishing Claudio for his own good, and cleaning up Vienna of lechery too. Maybe we ought to be merciful in our opinion of the deputy. Nonetheless, the Bard shows that in the case of young Claudio, mercy and forgiveness is the right path to choose. Finally, consider why Shakespeare may have portrayed a merciful leader to his Jacobean audience. Maybe if he were to portray a leader as fair and merciful, the Jacobean audience would trust that their new king (a man similar in character to the Duke) could be kind and merciful too. Earning the favour of the king and writing a killer play? Heâs killed two birds with one stone.\n\nHuman Frailty & Fallibility\n\nIâve encountered many essay topics about how humans are flawed and imperfect. Itâs a pretty big theme in many texts, not just in our friend William Shakespeareâs. Human fallibility is to blame for a lot of the going-ons in âMeasure for Measureâ. Angelo takes the law too seriously, he gets heart eyes for Isabella and kills Claudio even though he thinks heâs slept with Isabella. Why? He wants to save his own ass, fearing Claudio will seek vengeance. The Duke is flawed too. Heâs a leader, but he just avoids his problems, leaving Angelo in charge to deal with them. Then he plans to swoop in and look like a hero. Kinda dodgy. Consider Claudio and Juliet too. They, like Angelo, succumbed to lust and slept together before they were officially married. (Sigh, humans just canât get it right.) Itâs also worth thinking about the âlow-livesâ and poorer characters. Are the poor frail in a different way? For example, Mistress Overdone keeps Lucioâs secrets for him. In that way she is virtuous. However, she sells her body to survive. Perhaps she is not prone to desire like Angelo, but serves another desire - a desire to survive?\n\nIn terms of historical context, consider the Divine Right of Kings, the Great Chain of Being and Playhouses/Brothels.\n\nâThey say best men are moulded out of faults, and for the most become much more the better for being a little badâ - Mariana pleads to Isabella to support her in begging the Duke to pardon (her new husband) Angelo. She is optimistic for man, believing our bad deeds can lead to self-improvement. (Act 5, Scene 5, Line 473-475)\n\nâWhy, all the souls that were were forfeit onceâ - Isabella pleads to Angelo to pardon Claudio. She states that all souls were flawed before Christ offered redemption. (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 93)\n\nâI speak not as desiring more, but rather wishing a more strict restraintâ - Isabella is speaking to a nun as she is poised to enter the ranks of the nunnery. We usually think of a nun as living a very strict life, but Isabella wants it even stricter! Here we see her flaw is that her thinking is too singular and blinkered. (Act 1, Scene 5, Line 3-4)\n\nâLord Angelo is precise, stands at guard with envy, scarce confesses that his blood flows, or that his appetite is more to bread than stone.â - The Duke talks about how unhuman Angelo is. The deputy follows rules very closely, almost to the point where heâs like a machine. His nature is too strict. Â (Act 1, Scene 5, Line 53-56)\n\nâI love the people, but do not like to stage me to their eyesâ - The Duke says this to Angelo and Escalus as he hands over power to his deputy. Even the Duke is not perfect, in that he does not like being before crowds of his people (Act 1, Scene 2, Line 72-73)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare suggests that no one is truly perfect, not even a leader supposedly ordained by God, a law-abiding deputy, or a maiden who is poised to enter a nunnery. Yet while Angelo is overcome by his lust and emotion, the Duke and Isabella attempt to better themselves by showing mercy and temperance. Maybe Shakespeare suggests trying to improve oneâs flawed self is most important.\n\nGod, Religion and Spirituality\n\nPhew, weâre at our last theme. So, society in Vienna is very much religious. Their beliefs dictate actions and laws within the city. Some very religious characters include Isabella and Angelo. However, our novice nun, who is obsessed with virtue and chastity, agrees to and takes part in the bed-trick, a deception that is not particularly Christian. Our lusty deputy also succumbs, hellishly propositioning a maiden to sleep with him in exchange for her brotherâs life. Even The Duke, supposedly semi-divine, makes some dubious choices. He spends most of the play posed as a holy man, even though he is not. He plans the bed-trick to deceive Angelo and lets poor Isabella think her poor brother is dead, instead of saving her so much pain. Furthermore, the title of the tale, âMeasure for Measureâ, comes from the Gospel of Matthew. (See symbols/motifs for more deets). The question of how much we should let religion dictate us is another reason this piece is a problem play.\n\nThe theme of God and Religion can link to historical context such as the Divine Right of Kings.\n\nâmore than our brother is our chastityâ - (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 194) and âBetter it were a brother died at once, than that a sister by redeeming him should die foreverâ - (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 111-113) show that Isabella values her chastity and virtue over her brother!! Damn girl!\n\nâAy, but to die, and go we know not where, to lie in cold obstruction and to rotâ - Claudio tells Isabella that he fears the uncertainty of death. Perhaps his belief in a heaven has left him in the wake of his impending death? (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 129-130)\n\nâLetâs write good angel on the devilâs horns - âtis not the devil's crestâ - Angelo is talking to himself about his lust for Isabella. Itâs an appearance vs reality (ooh another theme!) kind of idea, where you can try to pretend something is something else (ie. Angelo doesn't lust after Isabella), but it doesn't change the thing (ie. heâs still keen). The deputy is comparing his emotions to these religious extremes. (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 16-17)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare criticises religious extremism in his portrayal of characters like Isabella and Angelo. Or maybe he just wants us to remain open-minded about ideas and our spirituality.\n\nYikes, there are so many themes in this play! Letâs move it along, and talk a little bit about characters.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nEach character can be viewed in different lights, even more so than themes can be. Weâre going to discuss characters very briefly because itâs up to you how you want to read them.\n\nHere are the characters, in order of how much they speak in the play. To keep things short, letâs pretend these are all tinder bios. Who would you swipe right on? (Hint: not Lucio)\n\nThe Duke\n\nsuper chill (the benevolent ruler of Vienna whoâs let the laws slip a little)\n\nloves dressing up (actually spends most of the play disguised as a friar)\n\nclever/cunning (secretly counteracts the injustices decreed by Angelo)\n\nIsabella\n\nstrong morals (would rather her brother die than she lives in shame)\n\ncan get wild (conspires with the Duke to complete the bed-trick)\n\nholy gal (poised to enter a nunnery)\n\nLucio\n\na gentleman (well, his title is. Heâs rude about the Duke and abandoned a prostitute that he got pregnant, so maybe heâs not that kind of gentleman)\n\nloves attention (legit! Heâs a minor character but he has the third most lines of them all! Lucio loves to stir the pot!)\n\nloves some symbolism (Lucio represents all the bad stuff in Viennaâ¦..see symbols/motifs)\n\nAngelo\n\nplays by the rules (a little too much)\n\nhypocrite (Sentences Claudio to death for sex before marriage, while asking the same thing of Isabellaâ¦. wow weâve found our antagonist)\n\nDeep (Angelo is a bit of a complex character. He seems aware of his misdeeds and struggles to deal with these desires. Itâs hard not to pity him at times)\n\nEscalus\n\nreliable (consistently counsels Angelo against acting too harshly)\n\nvirtuous (heâs merciful, lets Pompey go with a warning in Act 2 Scene 1)\n\nloyal (trusts in the Duke)\n\nProvost\n\nhard worker (heâs a prison ward)\n\nvirtuous (does whatâs right by him, disobeying Angeloâs orders to behead Claudio)\n\nmagician (not really, but he makes Angelo believe that pirate Ragozineâs head is Claudioâs)\n\nPompey\n\nclever (philosophically debates whether prostitution is worse than murder)\n\nfunny (his character is the clown, and heâs got some sassy comebacks)\n\npoor (Pompey is a bawd employed by Mistress Overdone. Not the best dating bio)\n\nClaudio\n\ndown for a good time ;) (impregnates Juliet before they are officially married)\n\ncool family (heâs Isabellaâs brother)\n\ngood hearted (initially is horrified at Angeloâs request of Isabella, saying she shouldnât do it. Unfortunately, his fear of death getâs to him. After heâs calmed down, heâs accepting of death)\n\nElbow\n\na man in uniform (a policeman)\n\na little dumb (he speaks a lot of malapropisms - hilariously using similar but incorrect words)\n\nnot like Pompey (Pompey is a clever poor man, while Elbow is a policeman whoâs a little bit all over the place)\n\nMariana\n\ndedicated (still in love with Angelo even though he called off their engagement because her dowry was lost)\n\na willing accomplice (participates in the bed-trick)\n\nMistress Overdone\n\npoor (sheâs a prostitute, who fears for her livelihood when Angelo announces heâs destroying all the brothels)\n\ngood hearted (kept Lucioâs secret. What secret? Read onâ¦)\n\nAbhorson\n\nworks for the Duke (as an executionerâ¦. thereâs no way to make that sound nice)\n\ndoesn't have a great name (câmon itâs true)\n\nJuliet\n\nalso likes to have a good time ;) (pregnant before official marriage)\n\ndependent (if Claudio dies she will probably end up as a prostitute to survive)\n\nBoy\n\ncan sing (Mariana asks him to sing a sad song about how she lost her beloved Angelo)\n\nFrancisca\n\nholy gal (she is a nun)\n\nKate Keepdown (we never actually meet this character)\n\na colleague of Mistress Overdone (a prostitute)\n\nsingle mum (Lucio got her pregnant and then ran away. He thinks marrying a prostitute is akin to whipping and hanging)\n\nRagozine (we never actually meet this character)\n\ndies (legit thatâs all he does)\n\nSYMBOLS & MOTIFS\n\nThese are people, objects, words etc that represent a theme or idea. For instance, the fact that Iâve used a bad soup metaphor AND a tinder reference means I need to go outside more. But letâs move onâ¦\n\nTitle\n\nThe title, âMeasure for Measureâ draws from the gospel of Matthew. The idea of heavenly justice vs earthly justice is prominent throughout the text. Moreover, itâs worth exploring the Old Testament ways of âan eye for an eyeâ and âmeasure for measureâ in comparison to the New Testament teachings which lean towards forgiveness and mercy. Now, where do the Dukeâs actions fit in? Is he harsh and equalising? Is he just and sympathetic? Â\n\nNew Testament vs. Old Testament\n\nWhen the Duke sentences Angelo to death, he makes a fancy speech which includes the playâs title.\n\nââAn Angelo for Claudio, death for death!\n\nHaste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure.\n\nLike doth quit like, and measure still for measure.â\n\nAct 5, Scene 1, Line 439-441\n\nThis mimics the Old Testament views, which famously states âeye for eye, tooth for toothâ (Exodus 21:24). These ideals teach that the person who committed a misdeed shall have the same misdeed done unto them. (For example, if you donât like my new Facebook profile picture, Iâm not liking yoursâ¦..but way more severe.)\n\nIn comparison, the New Testament states that we âBe merciful, just as your Father is merciful. Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.â (Luke 6:36-37)\n\nSo, when sentencing Angelo the Duke employs the words of the Old Testament. However, he doesnât go through with Angeloâs execution, instead showing the mercy encouraged by the New Testament. Heâs not really following either way. Perhaps heâs instead choosing a middle road; one of temperance and justice.\n\nLucio\n\nWait, who? We havenât mentioned the âgentlemanâ Lucio much in the plot and in this blog post. Thatâs because he doesnât really do that much other than buzz around and annoy everyone. Maybe thatâs why his name rhymes with mosquitoâ¦.\n\nRegardless, we do see enough of Lucioâs character to learn that heâs not a very nice person. He treats Mistress Overdone and Pompey poorly, makes visits to the brothel, doesnât take responsibility for his actions (getting Kate Keepdown pregnant) and bad-mouths the Duke. So yeah, we donât like Lucio, whatâs the big deal? Well, in Act 4, Scene 4 Line 182, Lucio says something very intriguing.\n\nâI am a kind of burr, I shall stick.â\n\nBurr - those little brown prickly things that get stuck to you.\n\nWe can think of Lucio as representing all the sins and misdeeds in Vienna - lechery, immorality, lack of justice, selfishness etc. Hence, Lucio is saying that these shortcomings and flaws will always be present to people and in Vienna, sticking to the city like a nasty burr. Damn, thatâs deep.\n\nProse/Verse\n\nThe metre of the verse (ie. the classic Shakespeare writing) in ââMeasure for Measureâ Â is iambic pentameter. This means that each line is divided into 5 feet. Within each foot, there is one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed one.\n\nConsider:\n\nIâll TELL him YET of ANgelOâS reQUEST, And FIT his MIND to DEATH, for HIS soulâs REST. (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 195-196)\n\nVerse does not have to rhyme, as the above lines do. Shakespeare often employs a rhyming couplet to close a scene and add some drama.\n\nVerse is usually reserved for the higher class citizens, with those who are less fortunate speaking in prose.\n\nProse is language in its ordinary form, with no metre.\n\nCertain characters, such as Lucio, switch between verse and prose depending on who they are speaking to. This could allude to Lucioâs duplicity, or perhaps a deep understanding of class divides in Vienna.\n\nNames: Escalus and Angelo\n\nEscalus is the ever reasonable and loyal lord and close confidant of the Duke. His name gives connotations of scales and balance - characteristic of the rational man.\n\nAngeloâs name has connotations of âangelâ. If we judge him only by his name, he should be a pure and heavenly being. Bah! Thatâs so fake! We can see that appearance is very different from reality. Isabella notices this too, stating that âthis outward-sainted deputy...is yet a devilâ (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 95-98).\n\nAngeloâs Words/Actions\n\nThere is so much to unpack about this douchebag. Let us briefly consider 2 ideas. When he propositions Isabella to sleep with him, he requests that she âlay down the treasures of (her) bodyâ (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 100).\n\nFirstly, thatâs weird. Perhaps Angelo can be seen as someone who is obsessed with the physical - Isabellaâs body and treasure. Maybe this obsession leads to his immorality and poor leadership.\n\nSecondly, Angelo struggles to directly say, âhey, letâs sleep togetherâ. He weaves his way around the request, propositioning Isabella so indirectly that at first, she does not even seem to understand his request! However, once she threatens to tell everyone about his vile demand, he speaks bluntly; âWho will believe thee, Isabel?â (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 163). Perhaps this shows Angelo is self-aware that heâs being an ass. Or maybe this scene is yet more evidence of a patriarchal society, with the men knowing very well the power they hold.\n\nRagozine\n\nWe never actually meet this fellow. Ragozine is a pirate who dies in jail while âMeasure for Measureâ unfolds. His head is used in place of Claudioâs to convince Angelo of the formerâs execution. Fascinatingly, Ragozine is the only person who dies in the entire play. ALSO, he dies of natural causes. Interesting. It feels like the play is full of death, grief and many heads on the chopping block. But curiously, there is only one death, of a minor character, of natural causes. Perhaps this says something about fate and justice or offers some commentary on life and hope.\n\nElbow vs. Pompey\n\nElbow is a silly policeman who speaks in malapropisms (using a similar but incorrect word for humorous effect). Pompey is a clever pimp who seems to have a deep understanding of justice and the Viennese people. The comparison of these characters, fortunate and dumb to unfortunate and clever, perhaps serves to show that the law is not always apt and that sometimes those who break the law are more clever than it.\n\nMistress Overdone (or lack thereof)\n\nMistress Overdone is a pitiable prostitute. She worries for her survival when Angelo begins pulling down the brothels, and she keeps Lucioâs bastard child a secret, only for him to throw her under the bus to save his own skin. The last we see of Mistress Overdone is her getting carted off to prison, crying âSee how he goes about to abuse me!â (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 481) Yes, the last we witness of one of five speaking female characters is of her imminent incarceration. Furthermore, this happens in Act 3 of 5, around halfway through the play! The audience never hears from Mistress Overdone again, and her future is left uncertain. Even Barnadine, a convicted murderer, is given freedom and a happy ending.\n\nConsider writing a few sentences of your essay from a feministâs perspective. Think about the events of the play from the female charactersâ points of view. What is Shakespeare saying by portraying Mistress Overdone (and other women) in such a way? Perhaps he is pointing out the injustices of the patriarchal system, or how uncertain a womanâs life was in his contemporary time.\n\nâMeasure for Measureâ truly is an incredible text. This blog post is by no means an exhaustive list of all its quirks and complexities. This playâs relevance has survived centuries, and I believe it will continue to be pertinent to audiences well into the future. You are very lucky to be studying a text with such universal themes and ideas that you can carry with you even after high school.\n\nMeasure for Measure is currently studied in VCE English under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nINTRODUCTIONâ\n\nAhh William Shakespeare. That guy. Youâre probably thinking, âGreat. More fancy language. Hasnât he been dead for centuries? Why does he keep popping up in our English curriculum?â\n\nAt least, thatâs how I reacted.\n\nShakespeare is actually a huge figure in the history of the English language, and really no high school English curriculum is complete without a mandatory dose of him. In fact, the current VCAA study design demands that one of his texts must be on the text list. What a legend.\n\nShakespeare doesnât only influence our world in the classroom. The Bard coined many words and phrases that we use today. We can thank this playwright for âbe -all, end-allâ, âgood riddanceâ, and my personal favourite, âswaggerâ.\n\nThe Bardâs play âMeasure for Measureâ was first performed in 1604; over 400 years ago. So why do we still study his works today? In fact, the ideas and themes that are evoked in his plays are universal and timeless; pertinent to his contemporary counterparts, as well as todayâs audience. Shakespeareâs plays are like soup (bear with me, this is going somewhere). One could say the playwright is a master chef; he mixes tales of the human condition and experience and asks us to question people and ideas. Everyone, regardless of their time, will gobble up the story.\n\nSo, what is this soup- I mean âMeasure for Measureâ about? The play is known as a âproblem playâ and/or âtragicomedyâ. Thatâs right, itâs both a tragedy and a comedy. Dire trials and tribulations are intertwined with humorous gags and jokesters. I guess Shakespeare couldnât choose just one. Â\n\nâMeasure for Measureâ is also a problem play. Critic W.W Lawrence defined a problem play as one in which \"a perplexing and distressing complication in human life is presented in a spirit of high seriousness ... the theme is handled so as to arouse not merely interest or excitement, or pity or amusement, but to probe the complicated interrelations of character and action, in a situation admitting of different ethical interpretations\".\n\nOk, crazy, but he also said that \"the 'problem' is not like one in mathematics, to which there is a single true solution, but is one of conduct, as to which there are no fixed and immutable laws. Often it cannot be reduced to any formula, any one question, since human life is too complex to be so neatly simplified.â\n\nIn short, a problem play presents lots of complications and issues that are open to different ethical interpretations. As in âMeasure for Measureâ, the âproblem(s)â is/are not always solved.\n\nSo, what actually happens in this play that is problematic? What are our ingredients in this problem soup?\n\nâP(L)OT SUMMARY\n\nGet it? Cause soup is cooked in a pot. Sorry.\n\nThe Duke of Vienna appoints his deputy, Angelo, as the temporary leader. This Duke then pretends to leave town but instead dresses up as a friar to observe what happens in his absence. Angelo, strict and unwavering in his dedication to following the rules, decides to rid Vienna of all the unlawful sexual activity; including shutting down the brothels. Prostitutes like Mistress Overdone (pun alert) and her pimp Pompey are poised to lose their livelihoods. Laws against this activity exist, but theyâve gotten lax over the years. Angelo, a stickler for the rules, has Claudio arrested because young Claudio has gotten his engaged wife-to-be (Juliet) pregnant before they were officially married. Claudio is to be executed.\n\nThe virtuous Isabella, Claudioâs sister, is poised to enter a nunnery. Upon hearing of her brotherâs arrest and sentence, she goes to Angelo to beg him for mercy. He hypocritically, in an absolutely dog move, propositions her, saying heâll pardon her brother if she sleeps with him (with Angelo, not Claudio). She immediately refuses, being the religious and chaste woman that she is. At first Claudio is upset because he wants to live, but then he calms down and accepts death.\n\nLuckily, the Duke (secretly dressed as a friar) helps in their sticky situation. He brews up a plan; Angeloâs former flame Mariana was engaged to him, but he broke off their engagement after she lost her dowry in a shipwreck. The Friar (Duke) plans to have Isabella agree to sleep with Angelo, but then send Mariana in her place. In theory, Angelo would pardon Claudio and be forced to marry Mariana by law.\n\nThe old switcheroo goes off without a hitch. But come morning, Angelo refuses to pardon Claudio, fearing he will seek revenge. The Duke, in collaboration with the Provost, send Angelo the head of a dead pirate (Ragozine) who died of natural causes. They claim that itâs Claudioâs head, and Angelo is satisfied, thinking him to be dead. Isabella is also told that her brother is dead and is encouraged by the Friar (Duke) to complain about Angelo to the Duke, who is returning home. Â\n\nThe Duke makes a grand return to Vienna, saying he will hear any complaints immediately. Isabella tells her story, and the Duke feigns disbelief, despite having orchestrated the plan himself. In an act filled with more twists and turns than a Marvel movie, everything comes out; the Duke reveals he was a friar all along, Angelo is forced to confess, and Claudio is pardoned amongst other things. To top it all off, the Duke proposes to Isabella. Crazy!\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nItâs important to acknowledge what was going on in the world during the writing of a text. This may help give insight into why the author has included (or not included) some aspect of their work.\n\nThe Divine Right of Kings\n\nThis holy mandate states that a monarch derives his right to rule from the will of God and is not subject to earthly authority. The âkingâ or monarch is hence practically divine, and questioning his orders is also questioning god; blasphemy.\n\nThe Great Chain of Being/Class divides\n\nThis chain is a hierarchy of all life forms and matter in the following order:\n\nGod\n\nAngels\n\nKings & Royalty\n\nNobles\n\nCommoners (Gentry, Merchants, Yeoman, Laborers)\n\nSlaves\n\nAnimals\n\nPlants\n\nNon-living things\n\nHence, alongside The Divine Right of Kings, this ideal gave monarchs huge power over their subjects.\n\nIn early 1600s England, there was a defined social hierarchy and class system. Everyone had a place in the hierarchy, and there was little movement between the classes. Within each class, men were considered superior to women.\n\nShakespeare encourages us to ask a few questions of our supposedly holy leader and his actions. According to the Divine Right of Kings, the Duke is godâs right-hand man, and thus all his decisions are holy and backed by heaven. However, the Duke is pretty shady when he plots his bed-trick plan with Isabella and Mariana. Is this deceptive behavior still holy? Furthermore, is it not sacrilege to pretend to be a holy friar when one is not truly a holy man?\n\nMoreover, when the Duke assigns Angelo as his deputy, would this transform Angelo into a divine ruler too? Could he be divine, considering his cruel rule and despicable request to Isabella?\n\nWomen\n\nWomen were considered subservient, lower class citizens then men. Alliances were forged between powerful families through arranged marriages of daughters. These girls may have received an education through tutors attending their homes (there were no schools for girls), but their endgame would be marriage, children and maintaining the home. Women and girls of a lower class did not receive any formal education but would have learned how to govern a household and become skilled in all housewifely duties. Impoverished and desperate women (Mistress Overdone) would turn to prostitution to stay alive.\n\nShakespeare perhaps highlights the struggle of women in his female characters; Isabella, Mistress Overdone, Juliet, and Kate Keepdown. Their futures appear bleak; Isabella is poised to enter a nunnery, Julietâs husband (her only source of income and protection) is to be executed, while the brothels that facilitate Mistress Overdone and Kate Keepdownâs livelihoods are being closed down by Angelo.\n\nJacobean Audience\n\nIt was a tumultuous time when Shakespeare penned âMeasure for Measureâ in 1604. A year earlier came the end of the 45 year long Elizabethan era and began the Jacobean era under the rule of King James. Since the late Queen Elizabeth had no direct heirs, King James of Scotland (a relative) took to the throne. Little was known by the English people of this foreign king.\n\nPerhaps, as Shakespeare portrays the ruler in âMeasure for Measureâ as clever and good-hearted, the Bard sought to appease the king by calming the people and encouraging them to trust in their new monarch.\n\nThe playwright characterizes the Duke as loving his people, but not enjoying being before their eyes and in the spotlight; much like King James, a quiet ruler who relished studying privately in his great library.\n\nâPlayhouses and Brothels\n\nThe general public (commoners) paid a penny (could buy you a loaf of bread back in the day) to see Shakespeareâs plays, standing in the âyardâ; on the ground, at eye-level of the stage. The rich (gentry) paid 2 pennies for seating in the galleries, often using cushions. The really rich (nobles) could watch the play from a chair set on the side of the stage itself. Shakespeareâs plays were performed at the Globe Theatre. Playhouses in Shakespeare's time were often close to brothels, both in terms of their physical locations in the suburbs and the way they were viewed by some of polite society. Thus, Shakespeare's relatively sympathetic portrayal of sexual deviance in âMeasure for Measureâ may also constitute a defence of other suburban entertainmentâhis playsâand a way to humanize lower classes who patronized them.\n\nWRITING ABOUT 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE'\n\nIf youâre lucky enough to study this interesting piece, the study design requires you to prepare âsustained analytical interpretationsâ¦discussing how features of the text create meaning and using textual evidence to support (your) reasonsâ. Basically, youâll be given a topic; this topic could surround themes, characters, etc., and you must write analytically.\n\nWhile you may choose to structure paragraphs around themes, ideas or characters, make sure to embed some historical context in there; thatâll show the examiner that youâve done your research and have a thorough and deeper understanding of why Shakespeare put this or that in. Talking about authorial intent in your analytical essay leads to a more in-depth analysis.\n\nâShakespeare portrays characters that are flawed as a result of pre-destined circumstances. These characters, such as bawd Pompey and prostitute Mistress Overdone, lived in a time when there existed strong class divides, and movement within the social hierarchy was rare. As per the âGreat Chain of Beingâ, a contemporary religious dogma, there was a hierarchy of all living things and matter, from lofty God and his angels down through the ranks of men and finally to animals and non-living things. In some cases, attempting to move up the social ranks was even considered a blasphemous rejection of the fate chosen by God.â\n\n- embedding historical context (The Great Chain of Being) into a paragraph that discusses characters being flawed because of their circumstances\n\nâShakespeare offers characters such as Isabella and The Duke who strive for self-improvement through understanding and temperance. Perhaps the playwright suggests that perfection is very difficult if not impossible to attain, even for a ruler like the Duke and a pure soul like Isabella. However, he posits that it can be strived for and that perhaps this attempt to become better is what truly matters.â\n\n- talking about authorial intent - what is Shakespeare trying to tell us?\n\nThink of it as an opportunity to make your very own soup! Add some themes, stir in character analysis, sprinkle in some quotes and serve with historical context and authorial intent. Just like with a soup, thereâs got be a good balance of all your ingredients; test out different structures during the year to find what works for you.

Well...). Keep on reading this blog post, where weâll delve into themes, characters and symbols/motifs. In the meantime, letâs have a break. Grab a snack, a drink, and enjoy this tasty Shakespeare meme.\n\n...Aaaaand weâre back!\n\nAre you ready for part 2 of the Shakespeare train? Hop on board as we explore themes, characters and symbols/motifs.ââ\n\nTHEMESâ\n\nThese are the major themes in âMeasure for Measureâ.\n\nAs you can see, the themes are interconnected. (Do you like the diagram? Made it myself :)) Why does this matter? Well, if you get an essay topic about Justice, for instance, you can also link it to Sexual and Gender Politics as well as Social Decay/Cohesion.\n\nSo, why is any one theme an important theme?\n\nWhich moments and characters are these themes related to?\n\nIs there a link to historical context?\n\nWhat are some key quotes?\n\nWhat could be Shakespeareâs potential message? (Keep in mind that depending which pieces of evidence you look at, the Bard could be saying something different. In this piece, weâll only discuss one or two authorial messages. The beauty of Shakespeare is that much is open to interpretation. You can interpret characters and ideas in so many different ways!)\n\nThose are some great questions. Letâs explore some of the biggest themes...\n\nPower and Authority\n\nPower not only dictates the Viennese society, but we see it is a basis for moral corruption (Iâm looking at you, Angelo!). The Duke is the leader of Vienna, ordained by God. He hands this power to his deputy Angelo, who misuses it in his request of Isabella. Now consider Isabella - she has power too, but a different kindâ¦ Also consider characters who have little to no power - Mistress Overdone, Pompey etc.\n\nThis theme could be linked to the Divine Right of Kings, the Great Chain of Being and Women.\n\nâO, it is excellent to have a giantâs strength, but it is tyrannous to use it like a giantâ - Isabella when she pleads to Angelo to not kill her brother (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 130-132)\n\nâHe who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severeâ - The Friar (Duke) to himself, not happy with Angeloâs dog move (Act 3, Scene 1, 538-539)\n\nâWhen maidens sue, men give like godsâ - Lucio to Isabella, encouraging her to convince Angelo not to kill Claudio (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 87-88)\n\n\"Hence we shall see, if power change purpose, what our seemers be.â - The Duke lowkey suggesting that once Angelo gets power, heâll change into something evil (Act 1, Scene 4, Line 57)\n\nâSome rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.â - Escalus is sneakily hating on Angelo. This quote shows that power and authority often involve corruption (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 41)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare is suggesting that power is a dangerous weapon and that in the wrong hands, it could be deadly.\n\nMorality and Sin\n\nThis is an interesting theme. What defines sin? For instance, if Isabella sleeps with Angelo sheâs sinning before God. But if she doesnât, then sheâs letting her brother die, which is not good either. Bit of a pickle that one. Some characters to consider include Isabella, Angelo, The Duke, Claudio, Lucio, the Provostâ¦. jeez just about everyone! So many of the characters take part in questionable deeds. Was it immoral for the Duke to pretend to be a holy friar? Is Claudioâs sin of impregnating Juliet really punishable by death if both parties were willing, and no one else has been punished for the same âcrimeâ? Are Pompey and Mistress Overdone being immoral in being in the prostitution business, if itâs the only way to survive?\n\nDeep stuff man. This can be linked back to class divides, women and the contemporary playhouses/brothels.\n\nâWhat sin you do to save a brotherâs life, nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtueâ - Claudio begs his sister to sleep with Angelo (immoral, especially since sheâs poised to enter a nunnery), saying that itâs for a good cause, and will actually be a virtue/good deed (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 146-148)\n\nâMight there not be a charity in sin to save this brotherâs life?â - Angelo asking Isabella to sleep with him and trying to paint the act as a charitable deed (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 65-66)\n\nâI am a kind of burr, I shall stickâ - Lucio, who represents sin and immorality in Vienna (weâll talk more about this later in symbols/motifs) (Act 4, Scene 3, Line 182)\n\nâTo bring you thus together âtis no sin, sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit.â - The Friar (Duke), encouraging Isabella and Mariana to do the dodgy bed-trick and trick Angelo (Act 4, Scene 1, Line 79-81)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare tries to tell us that there is a fine line between something moral and something sinful. Maybe heâs asking, âwho are we to judge?â, since we all do questionable things sometimes. Everyone from the almighty Duke to a lowly prostitute has committed potentially immoral acts. Perhaps audiences are encouraged to be more understanding of others, and their reasons for these deeds.\n\nJustice\n\nMmm, this theme ties in nicely with just about all of the others. How does one define justice? The play explores this idea; does justice mean punishment? Or mercy? How do we balance the two to deliver the right punishment/lack thereof? Characters that dispense justice include The Duke, Angelo (although they have differing ideas of justice) and Isabella. Since Vienna is a religious place, consider the divine justice system (ie. a perfect, flawless system meted out by God) and the earthly one (ie. the flawed, human justice system). Laws exist in an attempt to ensure justice. But does it always work? Consider also the Old and New Testament ways of thinking - the former strict and punitive, while the latter is more measured and merciful (see symbols/motifs below for more info).\n\nThis theme can be linked to the Divine Right of Kings, Great Chain of Being, Women, and Jacobean Audience.\n\nâJustice, justice, justice, justice!â - (Wait, are you sure this quote is about justice?) Isabella pleads for (you guessed it) justice to the Duke (no longer dressed as a friar), thinking Angelo has, in fact, killed her brother (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 26)\n\nâThe very mercy of the law cried outâ¦ âAn Angelo for Claudio, death for death!â Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure, like doth quit like, and measure still for measureâ - The Duke, explaining that itâs only fair that Angelo die for âkillingâ Claudio. (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 437-441)\n\nâliberty plucks justice by the noseâ - The Duke tells Friar Thomas that the laws have slipped over the years, and the citizens of Vienna are not being punished for immoral deeds (prostitution, sex before marriage etc)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare says that since we humans are inevitably flawed, that any justice system created by us will too be imperfect. Who are we to decide the fates of our fellow man? Furthermore, the Bard may be encouraging us to be kind when dispensing justice, leaning more to mercy than punishment.\n\nSexual and Gender Politics\n\nWho run the world? Gir- no itâs a bunch of men. This theme contributes to why âMeasure for Measureâ is a problem play. The exploration of the female characters in this play are very interesting, and kind of sad. Of 20 named characters, only 5 are women. Together, their lines make up only 18% of the play. Yikes! There is a lot to unpack here. Our female characters are Isabella, Mariana, Mistress Overdone, Juliet, Francisca (a nun who speaks twice) and Kate Keepdown (who we never meet). Their situations: a maiden poised to enter a nunnery, a prostitute, a pregnant girl about to lose her husband, a nun, and another prostitute. Quite gloomy, isn't it? Meanwhile, the men are leaders (The Duke, deputy Angelo, and ancient lord Escalus) and gentlemen (Lucio, Claudio, and Froth). Over the course of the play, our female characters are put into worse situations by men. Their experiences are dictated by men. Consider taking a âfeminist perspectiveâ and exploring âMeasure for Measureâ from a female point of view.\n\nThis theme links to the Great Chain of Being, Women and Playhouses/Brothels.\n\nâsee how he goes about to abuse me!â - These are the last words we hear from Mistress Overdone, as she calls out Lucio for betraying her even though she kept secrets for him. All this happens while sheâs being carted off to prison in only Act 3! What do you think Shakespeare is saying to us? (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 481)\n\nâThen was your sin of heavier kind than hisâ - The Friar (Duke) says to Juliet that she sinned more than Claudio, even though their sin was âmutually committedâ. Even though they were both consenting, the woman is blamed more. Consider what would become of Juliet if Claudio was executed. Sheâd probably end up like Mistress Overdone... (Act 2, Scene 3, Line 31)\n\nâWho will believe thee, Isabel?â - Angelo says this after Isabella threatens to reveal his disgusting request. Ouch. It really goes to show how untrustworthy women are deemed. Â (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 163)\n\nâWhy, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?â - The Duke says this to Mariana. Basically, he says a woman can only be those 3 things. Jeez. (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 196-197)\n\nâWhen maidens sue, men give like godsâ - Lucio to Isabella, encouraging her to convince Angelo not to kill Claudio. So, perhaps women do have some power. But, itâs due to their sexuality; something evaluated by men. Peachy. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 87-88)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare suggests that women are treated unfairly in society. Maybe he posits that women are afforded so few opportunities in a manâs world. The Bard potentially says that such sexual and gender politics do not create a cohesive and just society.\n\nMercy\n\nThis theme, again, connects to many others. It can link to all groups of people (The wealthy, the poor, women, criminals etc). Most of the mercy is dispensed at the end of the play when the Duke does his grand reveal. Characters who choose to mete out mercy over punishment include The Duke and Isabella. Also consider Angelo, who instead of choosing to spare Claudio, decides to kill him to uphold a law that hasnât seen anyone punished for the same deed. We might think this is harsh, but it a legal and lawful decision.\n\nConnect this idea with historical context, specifically Jacobean audience and playhouses/brothels.\n\nâI find an apt remission in myselfâ - Apt remission = ready forgiveness. The Duke says this after pardoning Angelo (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 539)\n\nâpray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to comeâ - The Duke pardons murderer Barnadine, asking him to use it to do better. How lovely! Â (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 525-526)\n\nâlet us be keen (shrewd/sharp), and rather cut a little than fall and bruise to deathâ - Escalus says this to Angelo, who wants to enact all strict laws immediately. The ever-reliable Escalus advises Angelo to be lenient and merciful. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 6-7)\n\nâMercy is not itself that oft looks so, pardon is still the nurse of second woeâ - Escalus says this, defending Angeloâs decision to punish Claudio. He suggests that sometimes being merciful can encourage further wrongdoing. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 282-283â)\n\nâI show it (pity) most of all when I show justiceâ - Angelo says to Isabella that he is showing Claudio pity/mercy by punishing him. A firm believer in the law, Angelo thinks heâs doing the right thing and teaching Claudio a lesson by punishing him. Â (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 123)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare encourages us to look at mercy and punishment from different perspectives. Angelo believes he is punishing Claudio for his own good, and cleaning up Vienna of lechery too. Maybe we ought to be merciful in our opinion of the deputy. Nonetheless, the Bard shows that in the case of young Claudio, mercy and forgiveness is the right path to choose. Finally, consider why Shakespeare may have portrayed a merciful leader to his Jacobean audience. Maybe if he were to portray a leader as fair and merciful, the Jacobean audience would trust that their new king (a man similar in character to the Duke) could be kind and merciful too. Earning the favour of the king and writing a killer play? Heâs killed two birds with one stone.\n\nHuman Frailty & Fallibility\n\nIâve encountered many essay topics about how humans are flawed and imperfect. Itâs a pretty big theme in many texts, not just in our friend William Shakespeareâs. Human fallibility is to blame for a lot of the going-ons in âMeasure for Measureâ. Angelo takes the law too seriously, he gets heart eyes for Isabella and kills Claudio even though he thinks heâs slept with Isabella. Why? He wants to save his own ass, fearing Claudio will seek vengeance. The Duke is flawed too. Heâs a leader, but he just avoids his problems, leaving Angelo in charge to deal with them. Then he plans to swoop in and look like a hero. Kinda dodgy. Consider Claudio and Juliet too. They, like Angelo, succumbed to lust and slept together before they were officially married. (Sigh, humans just canât get it right.) Itâs also worth thinking about the âlow-livesâ and poorer characters. Are the poor frail in a different way? For example, Mistress Overdone keeps Lucioâs secrets for him. In that way she is virtuous. However, she sells her body to survive. Perhaps she is not prone to desire like Angelo, but serves another desire - a desire to survive?\n\nIn terms of historical context, consider the Divine Right of Kings, the Great Chain of Being and Playhouses/Brothels.\n\nâThey say best men are moulded out of faults, and for the most become much more the better for being a little badâ - Mariana pleads to Isabella to support her in begging the Duke to pardon (her new husband) Angelo. She is optimistic for man, believing our bad deeds can lead to self-improvement. (Act 5, Scene 5, Line 473-475)\n\nâWhy, all the souls that were were forfeit onceâ - Isabella pleads to Angelo to pardon Claudio. She states that all souls were flawed before Christ offered redemption. (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 93)\n\nâI speak not as desiring more, but rather wishing a more strict restraintâ - Isabella is speaking to a nun as she is poised to enter the ranks of the nunnery. We usually think of a nun as living a very strict life, but Isabella wants it even stricter! Here we see her flaw is that her thinking is too singular and blinkered. (Act 1, Scene 5, Line 3-4)\n\nâLord Angelo is precise, stands at guard with envy, scarce confesses that his blood flows, or that his appetite is more to bread than stone.â - The Duke talks about how unhuman Angelo is. The deputy follows rules very closely, almost to the point where heâs like a machine. His nature is too strict. Â (Act 1, Scene 5, Line 53-56)\n\nâI love the people, but do not like to stage me to their eyesâ - The Duke says this to Angelo and Escalus as he hands over power to his deputy. Even the Duke is not perfect, in that he does not like being before crowds of his people (Act 1, Scene 2, Line 72-73)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare suggests that no one is truly perfect, not even a leader supposedly ordained by God, a law-abiding deputy, or a maiden who is poised to enter a nunnery. Yet while Angelo is overcome by his lust and emotion, the Duke and Isabella attempt to better themselves by showing mercy and temperance. Maybe Shakespeare suggests trying to improve oneâs flawed self is most important.\n\nGod, Religion and Spirituality\n\nPhew, weâre at our last theme. So, society in Vienna is very much religious. Their beliefs dictate actions and laws within the city. Some very religious characters include Isabella and Angelo. However, our novice nun, who is obsessed with virtue and chastity, agrees to and takes part in the bed-trick, a deception that is not particularly Christian. Our lusty deputy also succumbs, hellishly propositioning a maiden to sleep with him in exchange for her brotherâs life. Even The Duke, supposedly semi-divine, makes some dubious choices. He spends most of the play posed as a holy man, even though he is not. He plans the bed-trick to deceive Angelo and lets poor Isabella think her poor brother is dead, instead of saving her so much pain. Furthermore, the title of the tale, âMeasure for Measureâ, comes from the Gospel of Matthew. (See symbols/motifs for more deets). The question of how much we should let religion dictate us is another reason this piece is a problem play.\n\nThe theme of God and Religion can link to historical context such as the Divine Right of Kings.\n\nâmore than our brother is our chastityâ - (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 194) and âBetter it were a brother died at once, than that a sister by redeeming him should die foreverâ - (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 111-113) show that Isabella values her chastity and virtue over her brother!! Damn girl!\n\nâAy, but to die, and go we know not where, to lie in cold obstruction and to rotâ - Claudio tells Isabella that he fears the uncertainty of death. Perhaps his belief in a heaven has left him in the wake of his impending death? (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 129-130)\n\nâLetâs write good angel on the devilâs horns - âtis not the devil's crestâ - Angelo is talking to himself about his lust for Isabella. Itâs an appearance vs reality (ooh another theme!) kind of idea, where you can try to pretend something is something else (ie. Angelo doesn't lust after Isabella), but it doesn't change the thing (ie. heâs still keen). The deputy is comparing his emotions to these religious extremes. (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 16-17)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare criticises religious extremism in his portrayal of characters like Isabella and Angelo. Or maybe he just wants us to remain open-minded about ideas and our spirituality.\n\nYikes, there are so many themes in this play! Letâs move it along, and talk a little bit about characters.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nEach character can be viewed in different lights, even more so than themes can be. Weâre going to discuss characters very briefly because itâs up to you how you want to read them.\n\nHere are the characters, in order of how much they speak in the play. To keep things short, letâs pretend these are all tinder bios. Who would you swipe right on? (Hint: not Lucio)\n\nThe Duke\n\nsuper chill (the benevolent ruler of Vienna whoâs let the laws slip a little)\n\nloves dressing up (actually spends most of the play disguised as a friar)\n\nclever/cunning (secretly counteracts the injustices decreed by Angelo)\n\nIsabella\n\nstrong morals (would rather her brother die than she lives in shame)\n\ncan get wild (conspires with the Duke to complete the bed-trick)\n\nholy gal (poised to enter a nunnery)\n\nLucio\n\na gentleman (well, his title is.

For instance, the fact that Iâve used a bad soup metaphor AND a tinder reference means I need to go outside more. But letâs move onâ¦\n\nTitle\n\nThe title, âMeasure for Measureâ draws from the gospel of Matthew. The idea of heavenly justice vs earthly justice is prominent throughout the text. Moreover, itâs worth exploring the Old Testament ways of âan eye for an eyeâ and âmeasure for measureâ in comparison to the New Testament teachings which lean towards forgiveness and mercy. Now, where do the Dukeâs actions fit in? Is he harsh and equalising? Is he just and sympathetic? Â\n\nNew Testament vs. Old Testament\n\nWhen the Duke sentences Angelo to death, he makes a fancy speech which includes the playâs title.\n\nââAn Angelo for Claudio, death for death!\n\nHaste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure.\n\nLike doth quit like, and measure still for measure.â\n\nAct 5, Scene 1, Line 439-441\n\nThis mimics the Old Testament views, which famously states âeye for eye, tooth for toothâ (Exodus 21:24). These ideals teach that the person who committed a misdeed shall have the same misdeed done unto them. (For example, if you donât like my new Facebook profile picture, Iâm not liking yoursâ¦..but way more severe.)\n\nIn comparison, the New Testament states that we âBe merciful, just as your Father is merciful. Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.â (Luke 6:36-37)\n\nSo, when sentencing Angelo the Duke employs the words of the Old Testament. However, he doesnât go through with Angeloâs execution, instead showing the mercy encouraged by the New Testament. Heâs not really following either way. Perhaps heâs instead choosing a middle road; one of temperance and justice.\n\nLucio\n\nWait, who? We havenât mentioned the âgentlemanâ Lucio much in the plot and in this blog post. Thatâs because he doesnât really do that much other than buzz around and annoy everyone. Maybe thatâs why his name rhymes with mosquitoâ¦.\n\nRegardless, we do see enough of Lucioâs character to learn that heâs not a very nice person. He treats Mistress Overdone and Pompey poorly, makes visits to the brothel, doesnât take responsibility for his actions (getting Kate Keepdown pregnant) and bad-mouths the Duke. So yeah, we donât like Lucio, whatâs the big deal? Well, in Act 4, Scene 4 Line 182, Lucio says something very intriguing.\n\nâI am a kind of burr, I shall stick.â\n\nBurr - those little brown prickly things that get stuck to you.\n\nWe can think of Lucio as representing all the sins and misdeeds in Vienna - lechery, immorality, lack of justice, selfishness etc. Hence, Lucio is saying that these shortcomings and flaws will always be present to people and in Vienna, sticking to the city like a nasty burr. Damn, thatâs deep.\n\nProse/Verse\n\nThe metre of the verse (ie. the classic Shakespeare writing) in ââMeasure for Measureâ Â is iambic pentameter. This means that each line is divided into 5 feet. Within each foot, there is one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed one.\n\nConsider:\n\nIâll TELL him YET of ANgelOâS reQUEST, And FIT his MIND to DEATH, for HIS soulâs REST. (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 195-196)\n\nVerse does not have to rhyme, as the above lines do. Shakespeare often employs a rhyming couplet to close a scene and add some drama.\n\nVerse is usually reserved for the higher class citizens, with those who are less fortunate speaking in prose.\n\nProse is language in its ordinary form, with no metre.\n\nCertain characters, such as Lucio, switch between verse and prose depending on who they are speaking to. This could allude to Lucioâs duplicity, or perhaps a deep understanding of class divides in Vienna.\n\nNames: Escalus and Angelo\n\nEscalus is the ever reasonable and loyal lord and close confidant of the Duke. His name gives connotations of scales and balance - characteristic of the rational man.\n\nAngeloâs name has connotations of âangelâ. If we judge him only by his name, he should be a pure and heavenly being. Bah! Thatâs so fake! We can see that appearance is very different from reality. Isabella notices this too, stating that âthis outward-sainted deputy...is yet a devilâ (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 95-98).\n\nAngeloâs Words/Actions\n\nThere is so much to unpack about this douchebag. Let us briefly consider 2 ideas. When he propositions Isabella to sleep with him, he requests that she âlay down the treasures of (her) bodyâ (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 100).\n\nFirstly, thatâs weird. Perhaps Angelo can be seen as someone who is obsessed with the physical - Isabellaâs body and treasure. Maybe this obsession leads to his immorality and poor leadership.\n\nSecondly, Angelo struggles to directly say, âhey, letâs sleep togetherâ. He weaves his way around the request, propositioning Isabella so indirectly that at first, she does not even seem to understand his request! However, once she threatens to tell everyone about his vile demand, he speaks bluntly; âWho will believe thee, Isabel?â (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 163). Perhaps this shows Angelo is self-aware that heâs being an ass. Or maybe this scene is yet more evidence of a patriarchal society, with the men knowing very well the power they hold.\n\nRagozine\n\nWe never actually meet this fellow. Ragozine is a pirate who dies in jail while âMeasure for Measureâ unfolds. His head is used in place of Claudioâs to convince Angelo of the formerâs execution. Fascinatingly, Ragozine is the only person who dies in the entire play. ALSO, he dies of natural causes. Interesting. It feels like the play is full of death, grief and many heads on the chopping block. But curiously, there is only one death, of a minor character, of natural causes. Perhaps this says something about fate and justice or offers some commentary on life and hope.\n\nElbow vs. Pompey\n\nElbow is a silly policeman who speaks in malapropisms (using a similar but incorrect word for humorous effect). Pompey is a clever pimp who seems to have a deep understanding of justice and the Viennese people. The comparison of these characters, fortunate and dumb to unfortunate and clever, perhaps serves to show that the law is not always apt and that sometimes those who break the law are more clever than it.\n\nMistress Overdone (or lack thereof)\n\nMistress Overdone is a pitiable prostitute. She worries for her survival when Angelo begins pulling down the brothels, and she keeps Lucioâs bastard child a secret, only for him to throw her under the bus to save his own skin. The last we see of Mistress Overdone is her getting carted off to prison, crying âSee how he goes about to abuse me!â (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 481) Yes, the last we witness of one of five speaking female characters is of her imminent incarceration. Furthermore, this happens in Act 3 of 5, around halfway through the play! The audience never hears from Mistress Overdone again, and her future is left uncertain. Even Barnadine, a convicted murderer, is given freedom and a happy ending.\n\nConsider writing a few sentences of your essay from a feministâs perspective. Think about the events of the play from the female charactersâ points of view. What is Shakespeare saying by portraying Mistress Overdone (and other women) in such a way? Perhaps he is pointing out the injustices of the patriarchal system, or how uncertain a womanâs life was in his contemporary time.\n\nâMeasure for Measureâ truly is an incredible text. This blog post is by no means an exhaustive list of all its quirks and complexities. This playâs relevance has survived centuries, and I believe it will continue to be pertinent to audiences well into the future. You are very lucky to be studying a text with such universal themes and ideas that you can carry with you even after high school.\n\nUpdated 24/12/2020\n\nContents\n\nSummary\n\nThemes, Motifs and Key Ideas\n\nComparative Essay Prompt Example\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\n1. Summary\n\nThe Crucible is a four-act play that portrays the atmosphere of the witch trials in Salem. As an allegory of McCarthyism, the play primarily focuses on criticising the ways in which innocent people are prosecuted without any founded evidence, reflecting the unjust nature of the corrupted authoritarian system that governs Salem. It starts off with the girls dancing in the woods and Bettyâs unconsciousness, which causes the people of Salem to look for unnatural causes. People start scapegoating others to escape prosecution and falsely accuse others to gain power and land, facilitating mass hysteria which ultimately leads to the downfall of the Salem theocracy. The protagonist John Proctor is one of those that decides to defy the courts and sacrifices his life towards the end of the play, ending the play on a quiet note in contrast with its frenzied conflict throughout the acts.\n\nThe Dressmaker shows the audience the treatment towards Tilly Dunnage upon her return to fictional town Dungatar years after she was wrongly accused of being a murderess. Rosalie Ham critiques the impacts of rumours on Tilly and Molly, also establishing her condemnation of the societal stigma of this isolated town. Tilly starts making haute couture outfits to transform the lives of the women in the town and help them present themselves as more desirable and elevate their ranks. However, the townspeople still see Tilly negatively, except for some individuals who are able to look past the opinions of others and get to know Tilly themselves. Hamâs gothic novel garners the audienceâs sympathy towards the outcasts of the town and antagonises those who find pleasure in creating drama and spreading rumours about others. Â\n\n2. Themes, Motifs and Key Ideas\n\nThrough discussing themes, motifs, and key ideas, weâll gain a clearer understanding of some super important ideas to bring out in your essays. Remember, that when it comes to themes, thereâs a whole host of ways you can express your ideas - but this is what Iâd suggest as the most impressive method to blow away the VCAA examiners. Throughout this section, we'll be adhering to the CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy to help us easily find points of similarity and difference. This is particularly important when it comes to essay writing, because you want to know that you're coming up with unique comparative points (compared to the rest of the Victorian cohort!). I don't discuss this strategy in detail here, but if you're interested, check out How To Write A Killer Comparative. I use this strategy throughout this discussion of themes and in the next section, Comparative Essay Prompt Example.\n\nSimilarities and Differences (CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT Ideas)\n\nSocial ClassÂ\n\nBoth The Crucible and The Dressmaker talk extensively about class. By class, what I mean is the economic and social divisions which determine where people sit in society. For instance, we could say that the British Royals are âupper classâ, whilst people living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to get by are âlower classâ.\n\nUltimately, both The Crucible and The Dressmaker are set in classist societies where there is no opportunity for social advancement. Whilst Thomas Putnam steals the land of poor Salemites accused of witchcraft, the McSwineys are left to live in absolute poverty and never leave the âtipâ where they have lived for generations. Dungatar and Salem view this social division as a âgivenâ and reject the idea that there is anything wrong with certain people living a life of suffering so others can have lives of wealth and pleasure. As such, for both Salem and Dungatar, the very idea that anyone could move between the classes and make a better life for themselves is inherently dangerous. What we can see here is that class shapes the way communities deal with crisis. Anything that overturns class is dangerous because it challenges the social order â meaning that individuals such as Reverend Parris in The Crucible, or Councillor Pettyman in The Dressmaker may lose all their power and authority.\n\nFor The Crucible, thatâs precisely why the witchcraft crisis is so threatening, as the Salemites are prepared to replace Reverend Parris and deny his authority. Although Abigail and the group of girls thus single-handedly overturn Salemâs class structures and replace it with their own tyranny, Parrisâ original intention was to use their power to reinforce his authority. In The Dressmaker, Tilly is threatening because she doesnât neatly fit in to Dungatarâs class structure. Having travelled the outside world, she represents a worldly mindset and breadth of experiences which the townspeople know they cannot match.\n\nFor this theme, thereâs a DIVERGENCE of ideas too, and this is clear because the way that class is expressed and enforced in both texts is vastly different. For The Crucible, itâs all about religion â Reverend Parrisâ assertion that all Christians must be loyal to him ensures the class structure remains intact. More than that, to challenge him would be to challenge God, which also guides Danforth in executing those who donât follow his will. In the case of The Dressmaker, thereâs no central authority who imposes class on Dungatar. Rather, the people do it themselves; putting people back in their place through rumour and suspicion. However, by creating extravagant, expensive dresses for the townspeople, Tilly inadvertently provides people with another way to express class.Â Â\n\nIsolated Communities\n\nCONVERGENT:\n\nThe setting forms an essential thematic element of The Crucible and The Dressmaker. Both communities are thoroughly isolated and, in colloquial terms, live in the âmiddle of no-whereâ.\n\nDIVERGENT:\n\nHowever, what is starkly different between the texts is how this isolation shapes the respective communitiesâ self-image. For Salem, its citizens adopt a mindset of religious and cultural superiority â believing that their faith, dedication to hard work and unity under God make them the most blessed people in the world. Individuals as diverse as Rebecca Nurse and Thomas Putnam perceive Salem to be a genuinely incredible place. They see Salem as the first battleground between God and the Devil in the Americas, and as such, construct a grand narrative in which they are Godâs soldiers protecting his kingdom. Even the name âSalemâ references âJerusalemâ, revealing that the Salemites see themselves as the second coming of Christ, and the fulfilment of the Bibleâs promises.\n\nNot much of the same can be said for The Dressmaker. Dungatar lacks the same religious context, and the very name of âDungatarâ references âdungâ, or beetle poop. The next part of the name is 'tar', a sticky substance, creating the impression that Dungatar's people are stuck in their disgusting ways. The townspeople of Dungatar are acutely aware of their own inadequacy, and that is why they fight so hard to remain isolated from the outside world. Tilly is therefore a threat because she challenges their isolation and forces the men and women of Dungatar to reconsider why their community has shunned progress for so long. In short, she makes a once-isolated people realise that fear, paranoia, division and superstition are no way to run a town, and brings them to acknowledge the terribly harmful impacts of their own hatred.\n\nOn top of that, because Salem is literally the only Christian, European settlement for miles, it is simply impossible for them to even think about alternatives to their way of life. They are completely isolated and thus, all of their problems come from âwithinâ and are a result of their own division. For Dungatar, itâs a mix of societal issues on the inside being made worse by the arrival of people from the outside. The township is isolated, but unlike Salem, it at least has contact with the outside world. All Tilly does, therefore, is show the people of Dungatar an alternative to their way of life. But, for a community used to the way they have lived for decades, it ultimately contributes to its destruction.\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\n3. Comparative Essay Prompt Example\n\nThe following essay topic breakdown was written by Lindsey Dang. If you'd like to see a completed A+ essay based off this same essay topic, then check out LSG's A Killer Comparative Guide: The Crucible & The Dressmaker, written by 50 study scorer and LSG tutor, Jordan Bassilious!\n\n[Modified Video Transcription]\n\nCompare the ways in which outcasts are treated in The Crucible and The Dressmaker.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nBefore writing our topic sentences, we need to look at our key words first. The keywords in this prompt are outcasts and treated.\n\nSo, who are considered outcasts in the two texts? Outcasts can be those of traditionally lower classes, they can be characters with physical flaws, those that are different to others or those who do not abide by the standards of their respective societies.\n\nIn The Crucible: Tituba, Abigail, John Proctor or even Martha Giles can be considered as outcasts.\n\nIn The Dressmaker: We can consider Tilly, Molly, The McSwineys, etc.\n\nWe also need to look our second key word âtreatedâ. How would we describe the treatment towards these characters? Are they treated nicely or are they mistreated and discriminated against? Do ALL members of that community have that same treatment towards those outcasts or are there exceptions? Remember this point because we might be able to use this to challenge the prompt.\n\nWeâre going to skip Step 2: Brainstorm today, but if youâre familiar with LSG teachings, including the THINK and EXECUTE strategy discussed in my How To Write A Killer Text Response ebook, then youâll be good for this part.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nARGUMENT 1\n\nBoth texts portray outcasts as victims of relentless accusations or rumours, seeking to engage the pathos of the audience towards those who are marginalised.\n\nIn The Crucible, Tituba the âNegro slaveâ is the first person to be accused by witchcraft in Salem. Her âconsequent low standingâ is also shown through her use of language âYou beg me to conjure! She beg me make charmâ which is fraught with grammatical errors, compared to Judge Danforth who uses legal jargon and the Putnams who are much more well-spoken.\n\nSimilarly, the McSwineys are also those of lower class and are seen as the outcasts of Dungatar. Their names show us their position in the social hierarchy because they are associated with swines which are pigs. This is confirmed by Sergeant Farrat who said âTeddy McSwiney was, by the natural order of the town, an outcast who lived by the tipâ. Even when Teddy McSwiney died, the townspeople still did not reflect on the impacts that their prejudice and bigotry had on him, eventually forcing the McSwineys to leave the town because they could not find a sense of belonging living there.\n\nTilly is also poorly treated due to the fact that she is fatherless, being bullied by the kids at school especially Stewart Pettyman and also used by William as a leverage to marry Gertrude, threatening Elsbeth that âitâs either her [Gertrude] or Tilly Dunnageâ\n\nAlso discuss Giles Coreyâs death and the significance of his punishment as the stones that are laid on his chest can be argued to symbolise the weight of authority\n\nARGUMENT 2\n\nMiller and Ham also denounce the ways in which outcasts are maltreated due to their position in the social hierarchy through his antagonisation of other townspeople.\n\nThereâs also a quote on this by Molly âBut you donât matter â itâs open slather on outcasts'. Herein, she warns the audience of how quickly outcasts can become victims of rumours and accusations as the term âslatherâ carries negative connotations.\n\nSimilarly, the theocracy that governs Salem dictates the rights of their people and children. He specifically states 'children were anything but thankful for being permitted to walk straight, eyes slightly lowered, arms at sides, and mouths shut until bidden to speak', which explains the girlsâ extreme fear of being whipped. Salem is very violent to children, slaves and helpers and it can be seen that this is the result of the social hierarchy and the Puritan ideology.\n\nFor The Dressmaker, also discuss the ways in which they name others in this quote âdaughter of Mad Molly is back â the murderess!â Likewise discuss how Goody Osbourne the âdrunkard half-wittedâ and Sarah Good an old beggar woman are the first ones to be named. You can talk about Martha who is accused of being a witch just because she has been âreading strange booksâ, and Sarah Good due to the mere act of âmumblingâ. The normality of these actions underlines the absurdity of the accusations made against these individuals, furthering Millerâs chastisement of the fictitious nature of the trials and also the ways in which outcasts are the first to be scapegoated.\n\nARGUMENT 3\n\nHowever, there are still characters that are driven by their sense of morality or remorse instead of mistreating the outcasts of their community.\n\nBoth Sergeant Farrat and Proctor are motivated by their remorse to make amends. Proctorâs evasion of âtearing the paperâ and finding âhis goodnessâ is motivated by his desire to atone for his sin (having committed adultery with Abigail), and Sergeant regretted sending Tilly away. He, in his eulogy, says âif you had included [Tilly], Teddy would have always been with usâ, expressing his regret for the ways outcasts are treated in Dungatar. Similarly, Teddy McSwiney also has a pure relationship with Tilly and treats her differently instead of judging her based on the rumours about her being a âmurderessâ.\n\nWhile those who can sympathise with outcasts in The Dressmaker are either outcasts themselves or are remorseful (or both), there are those in The Crucible that are purely and solely motivated by their moral uprightness. Rebecca Nurse is neither an outcast (as she is highly respected for her wisdom) nor remorseful (as she has remained kind and pure from the beginning of the play). She is always the voice of reason in the play and tries to stop authoritative figures from convicting and prosecuting outcasts. A quote you can use would be âI think you best send Reverend Hale back as soon as he come. This will set us all to arguinâ again in the society, and we thought to have peace this year'.\n\n4.
