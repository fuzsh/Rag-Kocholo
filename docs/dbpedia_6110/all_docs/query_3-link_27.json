        "text": "When I sat down to watch this film, a film to which I had been invited, and, the sort of film I would not normally watch of a Friday night, I mentally prepared myself for every eventuality. Was this film going to be gore porn schlock à la video nasty of the 1980s? Was I going to have to use my popcorn box as a make-shift sick bucket? The audience in the foyer had been murmuring excitedly about this film, though....perhaps, contrary to my thoughts, it actually would be a well-conceived and methodic piece of work. The answer is: predominantly, yes it is.\n\nRevenge is a feminist horror/thriller film by relative French newcomer, Coralie Fargeat. Matilda Lutz plays a girl called Jen who is enjoying a getaway with her boyfriend at his luxury desert pad until their romantic plans are cut short by the unexpected arrival of his two male friends proposing a hunting trip. While the situation starts off as amicable between the three men and Jen, considering the abruptness of the change of plan, tensions start to mount in the house after certain drunken antics lead to misconstructions. The next morning, Jen is suddenly raped by one of the male friends while her boyfriend is absent. When the boyfriend returns, all three males become intolerant of her distressed pleas to call the helicopter so she can leave. With tension reaching peak-level, the boyfriend pushes Jen off a cliff, after which she is left in a gruesome state, which she miraculously survives. Beginning the process of self-medication, she moves stealthily through the desert, determined to exact her revenge on this misogynous assemblage.\n\nThis film is perceptively shot, and the editing of the breathtaking showdown of the film is inspired. What's more, this film is accompanied by a great 80s-esque electronic soundtrack by \"Rob\" which sounds, at times, like a cross between Vangelis' score for Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and that of Wendy Carlos for Stanley Kubrick's 70s thriller, A Clockwork Orange. The actors are more than convincing in their roles, with Lutz showing enough resilience and raw emotion as the female action heroine to put Lara Croft in the dark. That said, I do not mean to trivialise the film. This is a movie with much black humour, but it is also wincingly shocking and serious. It's release could not be more timely in a society where women are belatedly getting rights they have so long fought for, and we are coming to terms with the horrible reality of rape and the controversial idea of the \"male gaze\" which cinema has so long engendered.\n\nThis film flips stereotypes on their head, and so it should. This film needs to be seen. My only hope is that the film will not encourage the lesser-known idea of misandry, i.e. prejudice towards all men, in some circles. Speaking as a man, I wish to say that we are not all like that.\n\nGo and see this tour-de-force experience but this promotion comes with a disclaimer - it's not for the faint of heart. Watch the trailer below, if you have the stomach..."
