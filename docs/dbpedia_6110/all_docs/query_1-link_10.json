        "text": "At the start of the journey, he was doing it for his people because they wanted their homeland back but when he got there, he didn’t care about his people but only care about the gold and the Arkenstone. Once they could not find the Arkenstone, Thorin began to not trust anyone including the dwarves that had followed him on the journey. The strong bond Thorin had with his dwarves was not there anymore, he even accuse them of stealing the Arkenstone. Building up strength and finding out the villain’s weakness during the journey was not for Thorin.\n\nThe concept of a hero has been around for many generations, and the meaning of a hero is defined in ways people grasp its idea. A hero can be a person who has a superpower and is willing to make a personal sacrifice for the benefit of others or can be an ordinary everyday person who just wants to help people out of his or her own heart. Linda Seger’s article, “Creating the Myth,” tackles the idea of a “Hero 's Myth,” and shows the ten steps of how heroes are transformed from an ordinary person to the Savior. On the other hand, Robert B. Ray piece titled, “The Thematic Paradigm,” emphasizes that in modern films, it is either having an “Outlaw Hero or an Official Hero,” which he uses three stages to demonstrates how they are different each other in the way they perform in the society. Further, the article, “Out of Character: Wonder Woman’s Strength Is Her Compassion - What Happened?” by Stevie St. John, explains how Wonder Woman was viewed as a compassionate woman in the 1940s and 1950s, and in the 2000s she changes into a more violent person. In this essay, I argue that a hero is subjective, and is defined by the villain or event that they had to adapt to suddenly.\n\nAccording to the Norse Mythology for Smart People in the article, “THOR,” Thor is the thunder god, who protects Asgard from the giants, “Thor, the brawny thunder god, is the archetype of a loyal and honorable warrior, the ideal toward which the average human warrior aspired. He’s the indefatigable defender of […] Asgard from the encroachments of the giants […].” Thor is described as having similar characteristic of Finn: Loyal and honorable. Thor is also strong and courageous: “His courage and sense of duty are unshakeable, and his physical strength is virtually unmatched,” (THOR).\n\nIn the movie, Odin sits on a throne, makes decrees, and appears to be a warrior. In the myth, because Odin is the giver of human souls, he spends much of his time on earth as a wise older man. This time spent on earth, instead of in Asgard, also lead to Thor being born of a Giantess, not the goddess Friga. This shows that Thor was meant to be made part of the heavens (Odin) and part of the earth (earth giantess), this explains why midgard (earth) was Thor’s domain in the myth. When the writers of ‘comic Thor’ changed his parentage, they directly broke Thor’s connection to the earth, showing that they had no regard for what the actual myth had to say, this is clearly showing that Thor is only being used as a way to grab the readers’\n\nThor has many personal issues he needs to resolve and overcome, but his heart is not one of those. He certainly does not lack heart in the film. He shows so many instances of heart and laying it all out on the line for himself and his friends. However, he is very hard-headed and prideful which he lets get the best of him sometimes. Those two reasons are exactly why he was banished from his homeland Asgard by his father Odin. In the beginning of the film, thor is being formally recognized as the crown prince of Asgard, as he was the next to be the king of Asgard when his father passed away, which his brother Loki did not like one bit. As the ceremony is going on, thor and all\n\nThere are not too many times that Thorin felt hopeless. But, after Smaug’s demise, Thorin became egotistical, always trying to find the Arkenstone. An example of this happens on page 286, when Thorin declares, “‘The price of the goods and the assistance that we received of the Lake-men we will fairly pay in due time. But nothing we will give, note even a loaf’s worth, under threat or force.’” (Tolkien, page 286, The Hobbit) Selfish, Thorin is, for he acknowledges that the Lake-men need to be paid, but he does not give a single\n\nOne of the most dominant characteristics in any villain is a craving for destruction, whether it is the annihilation of a specific hero or of an entire world. Occasionally, however, the heel possesses a quality that contradicts this nefarious tendency. Rarely does a story include an evildoer whose actions end up benefitting those around him. This “doer of good and... doer of evil” (“Far Away and Long Ago” 1) is Loki of Norse mythology. While some of Loki’s actions qualify as heinous, many of those who read of his misgivings are too quick to criticize the undervalued deity. This harsh judgment has spun into a popular culture that paints a misconstrued image of Loki in film. Although interpreted by modern media as inherently evil, the Norse god Loki is simply a misunderstood mischief-maker who helps on his own accord, corrects his misdeeds, and ultimately causes the dawn of modern man.\n\nThe Thor: Ragnarok story involves the mighty Thor finding himself imprisoned in a different part of the universe. Hence, in a race to safe is home Asgard from the powerful Hela, he leads a quest for survival that involves him fighting the Hulk. Taika Waititi directed the movie, and his trademark is seen all over the movie with the movie's sense of humor and vibrant nature. The movie time frame is after the Avengers: Age of Ultron, which explains why both the Hulk and Thor are not present in Captain America: Civil War. The movie is a quirky cosmic adventure comedy that features some of the most colorful supporting characters in the Marvel universe such as Loki, the Incredible Hulk, and Valkyrie. The movie through the assembled cast translates very well on the screen throughout their performances.\n\nThor had been the most popular super hero film with respect to the critical aspects. This film had been associated to the presence and control of a mythical God, Thor. This was initiated in 1962 in Marvel and now it had been dependent upon the legendary Norse God of thunder. This is related to the Marvel comic and this character had become the member of The Avengers, accompanied by Iron Man and Captain America.\n\nThor did not recognize his unbelievable superpowers right away, in fact, he did not realize that he was even Thor until later on in his life. He was first a psychiatric nurse called Thorlief Golmen. One day he suffered a nervous breakdown before his 30th birthday. During the 18 months he spent institutionalized, he claims to have realized who he was and why he has been sent to Earth. This is when he realized he was Thor, the Norse God of Thunder, to save the planet. After getting in many fights he figured out his most useful power was his magnificent strength. He is so remarkably strong that his strength level is officially rated at Class 100 in the"
