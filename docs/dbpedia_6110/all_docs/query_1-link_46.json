        "text": "\"Vengeance? That's what you think this is about? Vengeance?\"\n\nThe Villain: Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler), the eponymous \"law-abiding citizen,\" is a former CIA contractor who specialized in creating elaborate assassination plans. When his family is slain during a home invasion and the prosecuting attorney makes a plea deal with the man responsible in order to guarantee a \"win,\" Shelton begins planning an elaborate revenge scheme.\n\nThe Target: Shelton's main target is Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), the prosecuting attorney who let the man who killed Shelton's family off with a light sentence in order to secure a conviction. But Shelton's beef isn't just with Rice - it's with the entire system that he sees as having failed not only him but the very concept of justice.\n\nWhy So Vengeful? Shelton's wife and daughter were slain during a home invasion, but that isn't what ultimately drives him on his vengeful quest. Instead, it's the injustice of seeing their killer walk free due to a plea deal that pits Shelton against both the attorney and the justice system itself.\n\n\"We belong dead.\"\n\nThe Villain: Monster, creature, Adam Frankenstein, Boris Karloff - whatever you call him, Frankenstein's creation never asked to be made, and when he was, he was rejected by his creator and met with horror, disgust, and violence from just about everyone he encountered. Little wonder, then, that he ran a bit amok.\n\nThe Target: While the \"man who made a monster,\" as the movie's tagline called him, was usually named Victor Frankenstein, as he was in Mary Shelley's 1818 novel, the 1931 film, directed by James Whale, renamed him Henry. Regardless of what he's called, his story is every bit as familiar as that of the being he creates. Frankenstein set out to make a perfect creation, and in the process, his hubris led him to create something he regarded as imperfect. Rather than seeing his achievement as a grand success, he rejected his creation, in the process making it into the monster that he saw it as.\n\nWhy So Vengeful? It's one thing to go after someone because they hurt you, wronged you, were responsible for the demise of a loved one. In the case of Frankenstein's creation, however, his drive for vengeance is more existential. Frankenstein is the cause of his suffering in a much more literal way - had Frankenstein not brought him to life in the first place, then rejected that which he had made, there would be no suffering to begin with.\n\n\"I don't want to go to sleep. And you can't make me!\"\n\nThe Villain: When she was alive, Aggie Prenderghast was just a little girl \"who was different from the other people in her village,\" as Norman says, able to see and do things that no one else could. Unfortunately for her, this made the townsfolk scared of her, and when people are scared they sometimes do terrible things. Aggie's own death terrified her so much that it left behind a powerful imprint on the town, one capable of raising the dead and wreaking untold havoc.\n\nThe Target: While Norman Babcock - a young boy in the present day who can see and converse with those on the other side - may be the protagonist of our tale, he's not the real target of Aggie's wrath. She's angry at the town who turned on her and executed her as a witch some 300 years earlier. And she'll make the whole town suffer for what they did if she has her way.\n\nWhy So Vengeful? When you get right down to it, Aggie is just a scared kid, lashing out at what scares her, which is the people who took her away, tried her for witchcraft, and put her to death back in the 1700s. And really, there's no vengeance quite like vengeance from beyond the grave, is there?\n\n\"But it is told by the fishermen, and their fathers and grandfathers, that when the fog returns to Antonio Bay, the men at the bottom of the sea, out in the water by Spivey Point will rise up and search for the campfire that led them to their dark, icy death.\"\n\nThe Villains: In 1880, a clipper ship sank off the coast of the fledgling town of Antonio Bay. Now, on the centennial of that dread event and the town's founding, the drowned mariners who were the crew of that ship are back for revenge... but what dark secret has the town been keeping all these years that might prompt such a visitation from beyond the grave?\n\nThe Target: The town of Antonio Bay and everyone in it seem to be fair game, though the revenants are really only after six lives, to make up for the six conspirators who led them to their doom a century before.\n\nWhy So Vengeful? It's all about that doom, you see. The revenants were formerly the crew of the Elizabeth Dane, a clipper ship whose wealthy captain was unfortunately afflicted with leprosy. He planned to use his fortune to establish a leper colony near the town, but the town's founding fathers had another idea. They instead kept the gold that he had paid them and intentionally wrecked the ship, in order to prevent the colony from being established and doing the 1880s equivalent of wrecking property values. So it's no wonder the crew of the Elizabeth Dane is back from their watery graves with a bit of vengeance on their minds...\n\n\"You were not content with the stories, so I was obliged to come.\"\n\nThe Villain: Say his name five times in front of a mirror and he appears behind you, ready to split you from groin to gullet with his hook for a hand. That's Candyman, the vengeful specter played by Tony Todd in Bernard Rose's 1992 adaptation of Clive Barker's short story. By the time the film takes place, Candyman has become an urban legend, \"whispered about at street-corners,\" and he's willing to do whatever it takes not to be forgotten.\n\nThe Target: When it comes to killing, Candyman is largely indiscriminate. If you say his name five times, there he'll be. But the target of his obsession, at least in the first movie, is Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen), a grad student who calls his existence into doubt, forcing him to appear. The film also heavily implies that Helen may be the reincarnation of Candyman's lover when he was alive... or at least that he thinks she is.\n\nWhy So Vengeful? Slasher films, at least as we came to know them during the height of their 1980s popularity, were the subgenre of retribution. The vast majority of slasher villains - from Jason Voorhees in the Friday the 13th franchise to Ben Willis in I Know What You Did Last Summer - were wronged in some way that spurred their later sprees. Few had as much cause for righteous vengeance as Daniel Robitaille, however, a Black man whose love affair with a white woman led to his being slain by a mob of angry bigots who cut off his right hand with a rusty blade, covered him with honey, and staked him out to be stung to death by bees. Little wonder that, as Candyman, he's out for a little payback from beyond the grave.\n\n\"They start eating each other, until there are only two left. The two survivors. And then what? Do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees, but now they don't eat coconut anymore. Now, they only eat rat. You have changed their nature. The two survivors. This is what she made us.\"\n\nThe Villain: Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), born Tiago Rodriguez, was a former MI6 agent who was captured by the Chinese government and tortured for five months. When he survived, he rebranded himself as Silva and became a cyberterrorist-for-hire, before eventually carrying out a plan of revenge.\n\nThe Target: While Bond finds himself in Silva's crosshairs, he isn't the actual target of Silva's revenge. Instead, Silva wants to take out M, the woman in charge of MI6 and the person who allowed him to be captured as part of an exchange.\n\nWhy So Vengeful? Silva blames M for allowing him to be captured, which resulted in his torture and an attempt he made on his own life by taking cyanide hidden in a false tooth, an attempt he survived but that left him disfigured. More than that, though, he seems to blame M for turning him into what he is in the first place - making him into a tool that is good only at causing damage, the same kind of weapon that he sees Bond as being."
