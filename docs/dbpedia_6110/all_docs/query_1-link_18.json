        "text": "As social awareness and the importance of representation have become increasingly more popular in recent years, film companies such as Disney aim to change the way they present the ‘Other’. The Walt Disney Company wants more inclusiveness by the end of 2022, as a result of which they have introduced more non-Western and feminist heroes to the silver screen. Developments in representation have been previously researched in heroes, though Disney mostly depicts the ‘Other’ in the role of villain. The representation of villains has, thus far, been overlooked. As Hollywood mainly uses The Hero’s Journey in their storytelling, which is a narrative structure that is fundamentally flawed in its representation of minorities, this study aims to evaluate what impact the recent trend of social awareness has had on the portrayal of the villain in Disney films that follow The Hero’s Journey. A cross-period content analysis approach was chosen, where 15 classic Disney films were compared to 15 modern Disney films. The results of this study show that, in recent years, the archetypical roles of the hero and the villain have changed within The Hero’s Journey. The hero and the villain are no longer two extremes that stand opposite each other, as the villain has become more relatable and less ugly whereas the hero has become more flawed and less traditionally beautiful. As of yet, Disney has not achieved their goal of inclusiveness. Recent films still promote the anti-feminist sentiment that women who step outside of their gender boundaries are evil, and the existence of queer-coded characters is linked to fascism. If Disney wants to achieve inclusiveness, feminist and non-Western heroes are not enough. Disney needs to reflect on how they present the villain in the story.
