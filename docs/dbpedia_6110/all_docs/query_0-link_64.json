        "text": "#10: Simon Peter Gruber\n\n“Die Hard with a Vengeance” (1995)\n\nHaving learned nothing from the events of the first “Die Hard,” terrorists are back for a piece of that John McClane action in this third film of the series. This time around, it’s still the Germans and it’s still a guy whose last name is Gruber. As it turns out, Simon is the brother of Hans, who was killed by Bruce Willis seven years ago. He wants to steal a lot of gold, but also get some revenge if there’s time. Luckily, John is joined by none other than Samuel L. Jackson for some all-out action-packed goodness to make sure Simon gets what’s coming to him.\n\n#9: Professor Robert Callaghan\n\n“Big Hero 6” (2014)\n\nIf you’re watching this film and wondering who the guy behind the mask is, then a SPOILER ALERT is in order, because he was the old man that seemingly died in a fire – also known as the head of San Fransokyo Institute of Technology’s robotics program. Professor Callaghan uses telepathically controlled microbots that he steals from the film’s protagonist Hiro in order to exact revenge on industrialist Alistair Krei. Blaming Krei for the loss of his daughter during an experiment gone awry, Callaghan attempts to suck the pioneer entrepreneur into another dimension… but considering this is a Disney movie, we all know that our “Hiro” will eventually save the day.\n\n#8: Captain Hook\n\n“Peter Pan” (1953)\n\nSince his first days as a fairy tale character, Captain James Hook has always been trying to catch that pesky Peter Pan. Our gravitationally impaired hero lopped off Hook’s hand in one of their many swashbuckling duels, thusly giving the malicious pirate his name and the metal extremity he uses as a weapon. Apart from only having one hand, Captain Hook doesn’t have any of that magical pixie dust to get him off the ground, which makes catching Pan that much harder, but it also makes the character’s rivalry that much more entertaining to watch.\n\n#7: Buddy Pine / Syndrome\n\n“The Incredibles” (2004)\n\nWhat happens when you don’t let the snotty show-off hang out with the cool kids? Syndrome built his entire empire on the idea of revenge. He wasn’t special like all the heroes of his time, so instead he built devices that could make him powerful and kill most of the real heroes. His plan was then to sell the devices so that anybody could have super powers. The super-villain’s one big misstep? Adding a cape to the costume.\n\n#6: Amy Elliott-Dunne\n\n“Gone Girl” (2014)\n\nIf you’ve seen “Gone Girl,” then you know Amy is about as crazy as they come, if you haven’t seen “Gone Girl,” then here are some spoilers for you. Motivated mostly by sheer insanity, Amy sees everyone around her as an enemy, but most of all her husband Nick, since he has been unfaithful. Any sane person would start thinking about divorce, but Amy instead sets up an elaborate trap to frame Nick for her murder.\n\n#5: Harry Osborn / New Goblin\n\n“Spider-Man 3” (2007)\n\nIn what few consider to be the best Spider-Man film of the trilogy, James Franco is looking for revenge, thinking Peter Parker seemingly killed his father. Osborn gets all trippy on goblin gas and fights Spidey in an aerial brawl. After a super convenient concussion, Osborn loses his memory and all is good. Until he gets his memory back, then his revenge mission is back on again until the worst butler of all time reveals Spider-Man’s innocence and the true culprit behind Norman Osborn’s death.\n\n#4: Alec Trevelyan\n\n“GoldenEye” (1995)\n\nSuper-villains bent on world domination always have to make time for revenge on the greatest spy in the world, see “Skyfall” for a good example. But this time around, we’ve chosen the baddie from “GoldenEye.” Alec Trevelyan and Bond are former allies in MI6, but as it turns out, Trevelyan was double crossing them all along because he blames Britain for his parents’ deaths in World War II. One thing led to another and Bond accidentally burnt some of Trevelyan’s face off. Whenever you see Sean Bean in a movie, you can save yourself a spoiler alert and just assume that he dies epically… which is exactly what he does here.\n\n#3: Koba\n\n“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” (2014)\n\nMistreated at the hands of his human masters, Koba has grown to hate mankind with a murderous vengeance. In what might be the coolest imagery since Optimus Prime rode a giant robot dinosaur, Koba the scarred bonobo picks up an assault rifle and gets crazy. Luckily for the humans, Caesar steps in to show Koba and ape-kind that they cannot make the same mistakes that humans have made, which results in the two having an epic battle atop a tower.\n\n#2: Freddy Krueger\n\n“A Nightmare on Elm Street” (1984)\n\nMotivated by the fact that he was burned by all the angry townspeople for murdering their children, Freddy Krueger’s spirit survives and turns him into an all-powerful dream creature. Instead of putting his powers to any kind of use, he decides to dream-kill all the townspeople’s kids as payback. Things go pretty smoothly at first because Freddy is a horrifying hell monster, but the kids gain the upper hand and send him back to hell… or so they think. The great thing about Freddy is that he never learns his lesson.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions:\n\n- Murad Hoxha\n\n“Taken 2” (2012)\n\n- Mrs. Voorhees\n\n“Friday the 13th” (1980)\n\n- Miranda Tate / Talia al Ghul\n\n“The Dark Knight Rises” (2012)\n\n- Hans Kieslowski\n\n“Seven Psychopaths” (2012)\n\n- Ivan Ooze\n\n“Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie” (1995)\n\n#1: Khan Noonien Singh\n\n“Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan” (1982)\n\nAfter being banished on two separate occasions, once by their creators for being murderous super men and the second time also for being murderous super men, Khan and his crew seek revenge against Captain James T. Kirk. Like Captain Nero from the 2009 reboot, Khan is motivated by the death of his loved ones, which he blames on Kirk, and so he attempts to destroy the Enterprise. Kirk out-captains Khan, but it would appear that Khan is ultimately successful as Kirk’s best bro Spock is seemingly killed at the end of the “Star Trek” sequel.\n\nDo you agree with our list?
