        "text": "I think there is an unspoken commonality for those of us that grew up in the 1990s. Yes, we grew up on Cartoon Network, Dunkaroos, Nickelodeon and having high desires of being slimed. That is not exactly what I’m addressing, but rather grandparents. I know, it seems something so random to target for 90s kids. Most of us, if not all, grew up with grandparents. For me, both my mother’s father and father’s father loved westerns and war movies. Nearly every trip my sister and I took one of those two genres were playing in the background. My grandfathers introduced me to the likes of John Wayne, World War II and Clint Eastwood before I was even old enough to comprehend what was going on. Likewise, my father did the same thing with the Rocky franchise and subsequently, Sylvester Stallone movies as a whole. I was probably way too young to see Judge Dredd when I did.\n\nThe experiences shaped my early perception of the film medium. Of course, I grew up around the traditional films like the Lion King, Batman Forever, Space Jam and other 90s gems. Yet, these films were played at nauseum for my sister and I. To be honest, I understand it from their point of view, now as an adult. You want to pass along your passions to the next generation in hopes of a stronger bond. For me, personally, it might be why I sort of loathe these genres today. Westerns and war movies are extremely rare for me to watch. Of course, as I’ve grown older, I have tried to give these movies another chance to see if I feel differently. With the occasional anomaly, such as 1917, these movies continue to bore and fatigue me.\n\nIt’s a burn out that has lasted my entire life. I’m continuously open to seeing new films set within those genres but it’s rare to find me actually enjoying them. Then along comes a film like 1917 or A Soldier’s Revenge and I have a restored hope for said genres. The latter is the latest film from writer-director, Michael Feifer. The film fixates on a civil war soldier turned bounty hunter (Neal Bledsoe) coming to grips with his past. Along that journey, he encounters two children that place him on the path of vengeance, justice, and self-discovery. One of the things that is immediately gripping about this film is its opening. From its opening frame, viewers are introduced to the heavy burden of PTSD that Bledsoe carries. Viewers are met immediately with depth and sympathy for this character. Bledsoe manages to entice viewers the entire way through.\n\nIn my experience with westerns, such as this, I often find a formula. Yet, that’s not quite the case here with Revenge – there is a depth within the film’s narrative that goes deeper. As the film unfolds, Feifer, manages to consistently throw viewers off with twists and turns. The film has a natural grace with its’ narrative. Revenge continuously takes its time to breathe and fleshing out its small, supporting cast which also boast the likes of Val Kilmer and AnnaLynne McCord. Yes, the film will embrace the tropes of the genre. Yet, there is enough from the protagonist in Bledsoe and antagonist, Rob Mayes, to keep viewers interested. Mayes, much like Bledsoe, commands the screen intensely. His ability to walk the thin line between charisma and ruthless is uncanny. His performance could go down as one of my favorite villains of the year."
